“I don’t judge. Come on, tell me how you’re getting Coulson to cover our expenses?” Clint stared at Tony wondering what he was meant to say. ‘Turns out Coulson has a bigger crush on Steve than you do and does anything he asks’ didn’t seem like a good start. Clint itched the palm of his hand that had been gripping the bow earlier, when he forgot his hand guard it often resulted in the skin being irritated from the tight grip.
Kat’s eyes were wide, and they had tears of their own as she asked, “He threw me off the Tower?”
“I’s actually not uncomfortable,” Kat answered. “The suit’s joints move with mine and it’s not constricting so it feels like a thick outer skin!”
Thankfully, Steve seemed to sense Tony’s growing panic over his runaway mouth, and he stepped closer, reaching up to cradle Tony’s face between his palms. The touch itself was enough to cut off Tony’s words, but looking up into Steve’s eyes, Tony was left totally speechless. Steve looked so relieved, a small smile pulling at his lips. It was better than any grin at the end of a video because, well gosh, it was just for Tony.
Tears made their way to Steve’s eyes as he held Kat. He should’ve been there for her. Tony say the distress of both his husband and daughter, so he pushed himself onto his knees and wrapped them both in his arms. They sat like that for a while. Finally, Kat calmed down and she was able to speak.
Steve swore and started pushing Clint towards the door. "Go! Take the escape route!"
Kat stood and walked over to her dad. She pulled Tony close and hugged him tightly.
Peter squeezed her, “Where are you?”
The first week, after they bumped into each other for the first time and Steve shyly introduced himself, Tony hopped onto the interwebs to see if he could figure out this guy’s deal. Was he single? Did he like men at all? Was he out? The videos Tony found were pretty self-explanatory. At least in the fact that, yeah, Steve probably knew he looked good working out.
First day of school with the Avengers and their resident twins.
“Do what?” But she knew what he meant.
He huffed out his nose and looked down at his sheets. He was going to kill Sam. "I'm fine."
Because Tony liked Steve’s videos, Steve actually suggested Tony come have dinner at his place and see how Steve put his episodes together. He needed to re-film a section because he’d messed up in his original shooting. There was no rush, as he could finish editing easily enough on Friday. He figured Tony could watch, and it would be fun to show someone else this thing he enjoyed – especially since Tony enjoyed it as well.
“Sounds good.”
Thor immediately began to swing Mjolnir, conjuring up a storm. He focuses the energy and struck the Asgardian warriors that were under Loki’s manipulation. They dropped like stones, unconscious. Kat pumped her fists in the air from her excitement. But it was short-lived. There was the sound of clapping behind her – slow, sarcastic clapping. She slowly turned herself around to face the roof of the Tower – and Loki.
“I love you, too, baby.”
They had all left one by one the next morning. The doctor had told them that they had put Kat out for a while so that she could sleep and recover a bit more before having company. He assured them that she would be safe. Thor had been the first to leave, preoccupying himself with finding his brother. Bruce soon followed, needing to go home and clean up. Clint and Natasha left soon for the same reason. But Tony, Steve, and Peter stayed for most of the morning. Peter had fallen back asleep with his head resting on the side of Kat’s hospital bed. Tony had taken the young man home so that he could clean up, and Tony needed to put the suit away.
"Cap, what about you?" Clint tried to stop his pushing.
"I've been... keeping tabs on you guys since the first one."
Steve was slower to follow but hugged her similarly, “You should work on your landings more, but the rest was great!”
“But that’s such an amateur mistake!”
“No,” Tony answered, maybe a little too quickly. He would’ve noticed if Steve was in a crop top. He probably would’ve combusted. “He wears crop-tops?”
Sam was scared. As soon as Steve had switched off his comm, Sam had started flying over the building. When the first explosion had gone off, he'd tried Steve's comm again. No answer. He'd been flying as low as possible, trying to catch the moment Steve ran out of the base. But it didn't happen. Now... now they were all just praying that he wasn't dead.
“I hope it’ll be fun.”
“Mumbled ‘Goodnight’ and was out as soon as his head hit the pillow. I pulled his jeans off and covered him with the blanket.”
“Bruce, when you Hulk out just try and smash their heads. I’m sure that with your strength it’ll be almost enough.
Kat slowly woke up from the dream she’d been having. She felt well rested and ready to face Monday. She pulled off her covers and dressed. She made her way downstairs. The lights came on as she made her way downstairs. Mornings like this were few and far in-between. Normally Steve or Tony was down before her and the lights were on and coffee was in the pot. But there was nothing. Her parents weren’t out on a mission, so where was everyone? And Peter was normally up by now, though he did sometimes have his slow wake-up days.
He opened the door wider, stepping back to let Tony in. “They’re lovely, Tony. Thank you. Come in!”
Sam laughed, and reached across Bucky to give Steve’s shoulder a squeeze. “No reason you should be, he’s been antsy about it all weekend.” Sam picked up a slice of pizza and took a bite before adding, “But so have I. So, spill.”
Loki chuckled again, “And he still is, yes?”
Rhodey sighed, again, and Tony could imagine him shaking his head. “Tony,” he let that word, saturated in disappointment, linger before continuing, “this is because you like him, right? You’re not becoming a stalker or anything?”
“Really?”
“No, I changed in my office,” Steve said, starting to sound pretty frustrated. “I… There’s equipment in the gym I needed for something, it doesn’t matter. Tony, just give me a second to-”
Kat hugged Clint next.
Kat laughed, “Yeah, no.”
For half a second, Tony considered that his kids had done something. But he was pretty sure they wouldn’t. Would they?
Tony and Steve frowned.
Steve smiled sadly and kissed Tony again, and again. He'd make the most of their privacy while they had it. It wasn't enough time. They pulled away quickly as the door unlocked and opened.
Tony frowned a little to himself, chewing on his bottom lip. “Well, only if you come over to eat ice cream and watch
Steve rolled his eyes and shook his head, sending Kat an apologetic look.
They marched Steve down the hallway, dragging Tony along. They took the men outside into the cold and stood Steve at the edge of the cliff. Tony was held back, just to watch.
“Maybe,” Steve allowed, stretching out his arms a little as he walked back over to his player to fast-forward the track again.
“Peter,” Kat said one day while she sat sketching under a tree in the orphanage yard, “what are you doing?”
Harley did laugh at him, but turned to his work. “Yeah, alright, whatever. You know we’re right.”
Kat frowned, “Pop. Dad. I need to ask you to let me be to study. I have to pass these tests, and these study guides are specific to the tests and I know what I need to do to catch myself up on everything else. Please?”
“That’s fine,” Tony said, “as long as you plan to join us for dinner.”
Kat and Peter smiled. This would be fun.
“Is that all?”
Kat flicked the spider off Peter’s shoulder. It went forward and crawled into the grass. They finished watching the demonstration and moved on around the expo. It was late when they decided to get home.
“Yes!” Peter cried, throwing his hands in the air.
“I want to thank you.” Kat yawned.
After a few minutes Steve pulled his head up. He touched his cheek to his daughter’s and they sat like that for a few moments before Steve pulled back and kissed Kat’s forehead. He looked her in the eye and spoke confidently.
Kat laughed out loud, “You really are a spider-man!”
“Guess I’m ready, Dad.”
School sucked. But it wasn’t just school. It was all the tests. Kat’s homework load became non-existent, but the amount of stuff she had to study was insane. No, the amount of pressure she put on herself to study it was insane. She locked herself in her room for hours, working on papers and reading over her textbooks. She often considered calling on one of the Avengers for help. They were all intelligent; all had graduated college. But they were all busy training and researching. Kat didn’t want to be a bother.
Steve swallowed hard, Tony heard his throat click, and nodded. "Okay."
“He’s acting weird, too,” Peter said, softly, and all heads turned to him.
The coffee was taking too long in the percolator, and Tony didn’t know why he bothered to make it there in the break room instead of bringing his own. It was the only thing that could get him properly functioning in the morning. But if nothing else, he sighed, pushing his glasses back up his nose, it forced him to take a couple minutes to pause – and maybe look over some of the papers he was supposed to grade a month ago. The door to the break room opened, and his eyes immediately flicked up to see if it was Mr. Tall Blonde and Gorgeous on his break. It was not, and Tony could focus back on the papers in his hand. Sort of. His eyes kept turning towards the door.
Peter released the ropes, and the two scientists were immediately all over the silk, pulling off samples to study. Steve took the kids and led them out into the commons room. Steve knew he had to talk to Peter about this early. But Peer beat him to it.
“And how much of it have you read?”
“My dear Steve,” Tony started, voice low, “are you intending to proposition me?” Steve’s answering smirk seemed to be enough of an answer, and Tony’s cheeks lit up again. “
“There’s a couple sections, and I’ll do them twice just to be sure,” Steve explained. He grinned at Tony over his shoulder, “Part of the reason it’ll be so helpful to have a cameraman.”
But there came one day, the Monday of finals week. Finals would be much easier than all the other tests that were for graduation. But Kat was stressing out even more. She wasn’t thinking about how easy the test was. She was just thinking about how there were more tests to study for. She planned on spending another afternoon and evening completing study guides. She made it home as normal, making sure she grabbed some food before hurrying to her room.
Steve returned the small smile and mock-saluted with his good hand. "Yessir."
Thor smiled and moved on to crush Peter in a hug.
Half an hour before class was supposed to start, M.J. walked in, sitting over on a bench and pulling out her sketchbook. Steve didn’t like to say he had favorite students, but M.J. was definitely a favorite. She wasn’t a wellness major, just taking his class to fill her general education requirements, but she always arrived early to sit and draw. Steve had been an art student at one point, and still liked art. He also enjoyed expressing that in new ways – like wacky, old-fashioned aerobics videos.
“Your fifteen now. Do you think you want to learn to drive this summer?”
“This is Loki. It’s Asgardian energy. He’s up to something again!”
The other Avengers crowded around. Thor had to avert his eyes, but Natasha and Clint couldn’t take their eyes away. Hulk was off to the side, much less calm than he was only a few minutes ago.
Steve gave a sad smile and wiped the tear stains from his and his daughter’s cheeks, “There is absolutely nothing to apologize for. You had the right to say what you said, and you needed it off your chest.”
The AI did so and Kat watched Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman run around during the 19th century for three episodes – four and a half hours. It was about ten o’clock before anyone else made their way downstairs. Kat had finished her show about fifteen minutes prior, and was sitting in the kitchen – at the island – eating a quart of ice cream for her breakfast.
After Tony let go of Kat he grabbed Peter and gave him a noogie, saying, “Peter I swear if you give anyone any trouble – and girls – I will fly you up as high as you can tolerate and drop you and catch you five inches before you hit the ground.”
Tony grabbed Kat from her brother and quickly flew her to the hospital. She should have woken up again two or three minutes after losing consciousness. It was dangerous otherwise.
"I'll be fine! Just... get yourself to safety."
“Don’t stop stretching those legs!” Steve grinned and winked from Tony’s computer.
“Hi Rogers, bye Rogers, got shit to do, have a good day, etcetera, etcetera,” Tony babbled, rushing past Steve and out of the room. He didn’t look at Steve’s face, barely resisting the urge to check out his legs and ass as he left.
“Tony! I can’t get ahold of Kat!”
“I saw you go over,” Peter explained. “I didn’t know what was going on up top. Dad and Pop could have been busy, so I caught you and brought you down to street level. Pop and Dad were down soon enough, but you weren’t waking up so Dad flew you here while the rest of us followed.”
Of course.
"We do this every year! Why did you make other plans?"
Peter held up his hand and showed them all his bite.
“What’s your visual like?” Bruce questioned.
The class period passed just fine, but Steve couldn’t seem to get M.J.’s words out of his head. Really nice. It wasn’t “really nice” of him to give a lame excuse or be rude and walk out on Steve every time he tried to have a conversation with Tony. It wasn’t “really nice” of him to be kind to everyone in the building except, apparently, Steve.
"You never beat me at this game, Tony."
“Peter, you’ve read this a billion times. I’m surprised you haven’t memorized it yet!” Kat scolded. “You’re just going to stress yourself out.”
He looked up as Tony gasped, scandalized, “But Steve, that’s a 70s record!”
Bruce reached out to touch the ropes, “Oh my God, Tony. It’s spider silk. It real, actual spider silk!”
The first few weeks of Kat’s summer vacation were spent learning how to use her suit. It was easier than it had been for Tony, since she had someone to guide her and who knew how the mechanics in the suit worked. She’d asked about what she might need to learn about said mechanics for maintenance and other things, but Tony said he would take care of maintenance so she only needed to know some basics – which he was happy to teach her.
Tony and Steve shared a look. Kat watched them.
Tony sighed as he looked over Steve's face and arm and legs. "Why do you let these things happen to yourself, Steve?"
Kat leaned in and put her head on Steve’s chest, “I know, Papa. I love you guys, too.”
“If he wants to.”
“How did you do that?”
Steve sighed, “I had hoped that we would all celebrate together.”
Kat could not meet her parents’ faces. She was afraid of what she would see.
“Sure, right, whatever.” Tony’s eyes flicked over to the laptop. Steve would say no at some point, when he found out about the videos, even if he did say yes to one coffee date. The videos. Steve was putting out a new video today. Damn it, he’d almost managed to let it go. “Rhodey, hey, can you stay on the phone with me for a bit? Or come over?”
Kat laughed, "I liked them."
“Yeah,” Tony answered, quickly. “I’m fine. Ready to film.” He gave Steve a small salute, and a smile.
Kat did as she was told and balanced herself before shooting three blasts up into the air. She had kept her balance perfectly and grinned at her success. She took the opportunity to look over and not to Clint. The archer understood and shot a few of his arrows into the air. Kat aimed, fired, and hit each one of them. Tony then motioned for her to follow him and they flew side-by-side over New York, causing civilians to look up and point and take pictures. They continued for a few minutes before turning back to the Tower. Tony landed and then watched as Kat made her almost-perfect landing next to him. She wobbled a bit, but she steadied herself and kept from falling over.
Every morning for the past two weeks, Tony filled and packed two thermoses of coffee before heading to work. Now, he might have been awake all night to try and catch up on his grading, but there was no way he’d forgotten his second thermos. Except, it wasn’t in his bag. It wasn’t on his desk. It wasn’t in his office, or in the lab. It certainly wasn’t in the break room, even though Doreen and Harley suggested he look there while Riri and Peter snickered with each other.
Grading the tests took him less than an hour, including putting in the grades. Last night, he’d managed to get caught up on the project grading, so all his grades would be in on time this semester. Good thing, too, because he was pretty sure T’Challa was sick of getting complaints from Dr. Richards, the department head, about Tony’s tardiness. He’d manage to keep himself around for another couple years probably if he could keep this up.
Tony put a hand on Peter’s shoulder, “See? He knows what’s up.”
“Almost five minutes, sir.” That was two minutes too long.
As everyone made it out to the street – or the air in Tony and Kat’s case – they were met with the sight of rampaging Asgardians. Luckily, they didn’t seem so occupied with terrorizing the humans, Rather, they were intent to bring down the buildings. And they weren’t very good at it, either. They were attacking the structures from the top, down. Anyone knows that the logical thing is to take out the base and let the building fall. But, as always, the Avengers were glad for the little bit of ignorance that their adversaries had.
Tony’s jaw dropped at his student’s audacity, but the others’ laughter kept him from saying anything. They were working again, too, so he couldn’t in good conscious interrupt them. He sighed and sat back down, continuing to grade papers.
"I won't."
The fact that it allowed him to ignore Steve was just a convenient coincidence. A perk. Well, not a perk, but it was a good thing. Probably. Especially after the way he’d run out on Steve last time.
Peter snatched the book and looked at the last page. There was a sketch of him and the girl he'd been dating for a while: Gwen. They were sitting in the park, staring up at the stars together. Peter looked incredulously at his sister.
“Can I join you?”
“We have the next two weeks off,” Steve told her. “Tonight we’re doing a movie night. Gwen’s here, too. Wanna come join?”
“Are you trying to kill me?” Tony burst, hand dramatically clutching at his chest. “You’re trying to kill me, Steven. Aren’t you?”
He kept working with the computer, sending out the codes to the Wakandan database for analysis.
Tony rolled his eyes, but had to ask her a question, “Is there anything you need me to change about the fit at all? Maybe around the chest, hips, or head?”
“Peter!” Kat warned. “Peter there’s a spider on your leg!”
Kat smiled, “I love you guys, too.”
Kat giggled, “It’s fine, Papa. I’ve been spending a lot of time with Daddy lately and I haven’t seen you as much as I would like.”
“Kat, baby. You picked up on how to use that suit so fast that it made my head spin. You may not understand all the mechanics or science behind it, but you pick up on things very quickly. You have good instincts and reflexes. And we are all lucky just to have you in our family, much less our team.”
Kat was a little proud of her brother. But she also felt a little pang of jealousy. Being an Avenger would be so cool. Too bad she was the only one in the family without powers or special training – or super-smarts in her Dad’s case. But that didn’t matter. She could help by just supporting them.
They stopped by the nuclear waste demonstration one more time to that Peter could talk to the scientist who had presented. The same man wasn’t there, but there was a woman they could talk to. As they talked about the possibility of these scientists’ idea actually getting anywhere, Kat noticed something in her peripheral vision. She looked down and saw the spider from before climbing up Peter’s thigh, nearly reaching where he had his hand in his pocket.
“JARVIS, it’s Monday. It’s the start of a school week. Where is everyone else?”
– let him know they had noticed. Their worry was unwarranted, of course.
Graduation has it's advantages. Free time to take up whatever occupation you so choose.
It was the 4th of June. Peter and Kat were finally going home with Steve and Tony. Each twin had maybe six to eight boxes filled with clothes, toys, pictures, mementos, and any technology they owned – including Peter’s amplifier for his guitar. Tony drove to the orphanage with a van – followed by Steve in a car – and loaded all of Peter and Kat’s things into the back. Kat and Peter tried to help, but Steve and Tony insisted that their time was better spent saying goodbye to the other kids. And it wouldn’t take long with Steve’s super-strength.
“Michelle,” he sighed, but was unable to hold back his nervous smile. He tried to cover it with his hand.
Steve just held her for a while. He didn’t want to do anything else. She was safe now, and that was all that mattered – to him anyway. It wasn’t long before Kat started asking questions. Steve told her to wait for Tony and Peter to return because they would want to help answer her questions. The two men in question soon arrived, and were delighted to see Kat awake and well – as well as she could be at that moment. Peter hugged her as tightly as he dared. Tony settled for a kiss on her cheek, knowing that she would receive enough doting between Peter and Steve.
The End
Peter helped Kat to her feet and they hurried inside the Tower. They ran into the elevator and Kat pressed the button for their family level. As soon as the doors opened again, Kat ran into the room pulling Peter with her and calling out:
“Anything, Papa,” Kat said, wiping the tear-stains from Steve’s cheeks.
Finals week had been stressful, not only with testing and getting his grades finished and submitted, but with his Tony situation. He kept trying to find him, or run into him by ‘accident’ to see if they could talk it out. Tony kept away pretty well though. That was before M.J. brought a large thermos into the final. Afterwards, she handed it to Steve, saying he needed to give it back to Tony in the break room. It was terribly suspicious, but if it
Kat’s hands flew to her mouth. She looked around at her family.
“As soon as I teach you to fly it, you are part of the Avengers! Well, if Fury approves your training. But I’m sure he will, you’ll have the best teacher.”
“You’ll watch your back and be safe. I can’t be there with you all the time, and neither can Tony. And we hate it. But please just promise me that you’ll keep yourself safe.”
A few hours later, after two movies and dinner, Tony and Steve went to check on Kat. She had finished her two study guides, but was now working on another one for science. And there was one for math sitting off to the side, waiting to be done. Tony walked over and pulled her book and paper away from her.
“M.J., one of my students, her boyfriend is in your engineering class, she told me to give this back to you. I don’t know why she had it. She said I needed to wait in here.” He shrugged a little, and Tony couldn’t believe the blush on Steve’s cheeks. “Said I could thank her later as an apology for being an ass the last couple weeks.” He smiled, sheepish, “Wouldn’t usually let a student talk to me like that, but I know she’s right. I just-”
Fury gave a short chuckle, “Welcome to the Avengers, Kat.”
. “Yeah,” he breathed. “D-Don’t stop…”
“Dad! Pop! We need you! Now!”
The men and Ms. Cordova laughed quietly. Steve extended his hand to the shocked teenage girl in front of him, and Kat let him help her up. Peter stood as well and put an arm around his sister to keep her from falling over. Talk about being star-struck. Peter was excited, too. He shook Tony’s hand and then Steve’s. Ms. Cordova was the first to speak.
“Tony?” he hears, blinking away the black spots floating in his vision. Steve leans over him, cowl pulled off as he stares down worried.
“Hi.” He tries, nervous at the sight of her.
“No. I mention it and he goes and uses his puppy dog eyes on Coulson because he thinks he’s doing everyone a favor.”
“Roger that.”
Coincidently, it turned out, the day that Peter took his first steps he also learnt his first swear word.
‘I’m sorry the music was so loud’
Steve can’t.
"My normal arrows just aren't working as well anymore."
“You…you ne-knew it was me?” he chokes out, Tony tries to push down his smirk.
“All clear.” He confirmed before sending a detonating blast right at one of the walls. He doesn’t wait around, jetting off as the building explodes behind him.
“Honestly Cap you’re acting like I’ve never blown something up before. I’m just rigging his system, shame it has to explode it’s magnificent.” Steve looks up to see a bomb dropping towards him, he hides under his shield, firm as it explodes. When he tries to stand he finds himself stuck, a dome of hard foam surrounding him. He tries to push with his shield against it, using all his force. The foam doesn’t budge, it grows thicker, the small space he has getting smaller. Steve tries not to think of the ice, slowly freezing around him until he’s too still to move, too still to breathe.
He closes his eyes, tries to breathe, sees Tony sitting crumpled on the floor, fingers sticky with blood. Blood Steve had put there.
“Hi...” He scowled, trying to fix the mess he had made. Steve smiled at him, small, warm, earnest. Tony reached for a spare rag and scrubbed violently, standing up, feeling his back crack and wondering when he got so old. “What can I do for ya cap?” Steve lingered in the doorway just a moment longer before stepping in.
Steve chuckled and released Kat so he could look at Tony.
“Yeah.” Steve decided to change the topic of their conversation. “So, where do you guys go to school? What grade are you in?”
”Tony Stop!” Natasha says sternly and he does, again he does. He stops breathing, thinking, the music, his work, he just stops.
And wait he did.
Wrong.
“Sounds like quite a night.”
That’s a silly thought though because his dad is Iron man and probably has some sort of levitating device to do that for him. Peter almost smiles at the situation they’re in and then remembers why he’s in the situation in the first place. He all but frowns at his dad who is sleeping soundly, a hand over Steve’s that is resting above Peter’s head. When Peter tries to move and Tony’s eyes shoot open they both stare at one another awkwardly, silence falling over them.
It becomes a bit of a pattern after that, Steve will let his fingers dial Tony’s number, count the rings – it normally takes seven for Tony to answer, long enough for him to hear his phone and stop whatever he’s doing to pick it up – he hears Tony’s voice across the line and then hangs up in panic, heart beating fast at the amused tone that answers.
“Hey there big guy. I think we’ve already talked about how you shouldn’t eaves drop on people’s conversation.” He tried to sound like he was mad. Really he did. He tried so hard but the Hulk snorted and let out a small growl.
Peter wakes up in a bed, his parent’s bed.
“It was because something shifted. It wasn’t you and it wasn’t me but there was something different, you had this new energy that I hadn’t seen before. It wasn’t until they all moved into the tower that I realised what had caused it.”
“It is.” he replies shortly and Tony knows that he learnt this from him because everything good in Peter is from Steve, this tone, this attitude, this anger is all from him.
Despite his absence, he and the team still fought in a beautiful dance of crumbling buildings and exploding fire hydrants. Natasha - who was looking like she wanted to kill him more than the twenty robots buzzing around them, dropping bombs full of sticky glue and hardening foam – leaps off of one of the bots, it’s head in her hands, and flips next to Steve.
“Me?”
“Can you guys fuck somewhere else maybe?” Clint says from the door. Steve doesn’t jump away, he stays firm with Tony pressed against him and looks up at Clint standing in the doorway.
“Hulk no like tricking Philson.”
Clint had wanted the arrows since Spain.
Requests for an Avengers photo shoot- not after last time
Coulson was his last chance. With a speech ingrained in his mind he knocked on the heavy wooden door four times. Then four more just incase Coulson hadn't heard him.
Government visits notifications
Steve’s towelling off form a shower, drying his hair and desperate for a pop tart because after all his metabolism was super human. Tony seemed to have the same idea, he was standing at the toaster in track pants and a hoodie, tapping his fingers on the bench as he stared at the toaster.
, Steve’s hands moved to Tony’s waist, he let out an approving moan at the touch, desperate to be pulled tightly against Steve’s warm body.
Clint re-read it one more time and smiled at himself. He was going to hand deliver this letter to Coulson and watch his expression as he read it. Yes Clint was definitely getting those arrows.
I’m from is so different, people courted one another in public, you never went into a dames apartment after a date, and men didn’t…didn’t date other men, it wasn’t proper. There were moments, during the war, but they weren’t anything just…a way to let off steam, and you were kidding yourself if you thought it was going to come up again after.” Steve’s face is serious, his eyes desperate as they stare right into Tony’s. “It’s not an excuse, not for what I did, for how I h-hurt you. I’ll never forgive myself for that, for just leaving you there on the floor when you looked so…I’ve never seen you look at anyone the way you looked at me in that moment.”
Kat had developed a routine. Wake up at four, finish homework from the day before, eat breakfast at six, say high to her dads as they go into the kitchen, get dressed, leave the Tower, walk an hour to school, survive the school day, walk home, grab something from the kitchen to eat later, do some homework, eat for dinner what she’d grabbed from the kitchen, do some more homework, and go to sleep by 8:00. It worked for her.
Kat smiled, “I just can’t see him as Thor or Iron Man.”
"What'cha doin'?" a voice asked from the kitchen door.
“That would be so awkward though!” Tony insisted. “I keep avoiding him whenever he tries to talk to me because I’m embarrassed about the videos. There’s no way he’d say yes.”
They figured it would be a while before anyone adopted them. Most couples wanted kids that were younger, but Peter and Kat were fourteen – eighth graders. People wanted kids that they could raise and bond with, not kids that were getting to an age where they would want to be more independent. But maybe they would get lucky and be adopted before they graduated. Pietro and Wanda had been adopted, and Wade spent most of his time in the hospital anyway, so he might not get the chance to be adopted. But Peter and Kat were still stuck. They liked where they were. It wasn’t a bad place, but they wanted parents.
“That’s ridiculous!” Steve was becoming very angry with the god.
Peter shrugged, “I don’t know, I didn’t have time to try anything else.”
So, the next day, at lunch, Steve waited in the break room, hoping to run into Tony. He was fairly certain they had the same break on Tuesdays, so he waited, watching the clock. Half an hour passed, and there was still no sign of Tony. Steve was beginning to wonder if maybe he was confused when the door opened, and Tony walked in, looking over his shoulder into the hall as he closed the door. He turned and made eye contact with Steve, and nearly jumped six feet.
"I'm fine," he repeated, sharper than he'd intended. He took a deep breath. "I'll heal up in a couple days and everything will go back to normal."
“It wasn’t your fault Papa. I should have told you that he was up there. He just… got to me a little.”
They sat there for a while longer before getting up and walking again. They stopped and got ice cream before turning around and making their way back to the Tower. They’d make it before ten o’clock, but it never hurt anyone to be early. As they made their way back they stopped a few times and looked in windows, pointing out things they’d like but never actually buying anything. They made it back to the Tower nearly an hour early. Kat went to her room and showered in her bathroom. She pulled on some pajamas before leaving the bathroom and was glad she did. Steve was waiting for her, sitting on her bed and looking at a picture of Steve, Tony, Kat, and Peter that Kat kept on her bedside table. It was from the day that Tony and Steve had brought the twins home. It was the four of them watching “Raiders of the Lost Ark”. Tony had gotten into his security footage and taken the image.
“How’s Kat?” Peter asked.
Tony smiled back at him, sadly. "Hey, Cap. Glad you're alive."
Steve smiled and put an arm around Kat. They walked for a bit before coming across a dress shop. Kat looked in the window at the dresses. Of course, they were beautiful. She smiled. Tony had bought her several of these dresses for special occasions, but she couldn’t wear any of them anymore. She’d grown out of several of them, being a growing teenager. Steve looked as well, smiling at how Kat’s eyes took in the beautiful fabrics.
“Peter, hold still.”
They sat like that for a while, Kat just putting the finishing touches on her sketch. The Avengers had just saved the city again a few days ago. The damage hadn’t reached as far as the orphanage, but it had been a scary day, cooped up in the basement with all the crying little ones. But it had been enough for Kat to be inspired by the heroes. She’d drawn her brother and their friends and the Avengers. Wanda – of course – was Black Widow, Pietro was Hawkeye, Peter was Captain America, and Wade was Hulk. Peter looked it over again and chuckled.
Steve’s head tipped back, and he gripped Tony’s elbows, pulling him over to the bed. Tony didn’t lift his mouth from Steve’s skin. He started to suck marks up Steve’s throat, and Steve couldn’t hold back a moan. Impatiently, Steve tried to undo Tony’s belt, his hands already trembling with anticipation and making it difficult. Tony simply chuckled against Steve’s jaw, reaching down to steady Steve’s hands.
Loki was back.
The cell was old, and cold, and moldy, and just so gross. Steve sat in the corner with Tony, keeping the smaller man warm.
A shower was in order. Once the sweat of Steve’s day and workout were washed away, he pulled on a pair of sweatpants and a loose crop top. It was one of the first ones he used in videos, but it was too loose to really work with the leotard anymore. The soft, faded blue with a white star on the front was kind of comforting though, so he’d kept it. He ambled back into the living room, and checked his laptop again as he called to order a couple pizzas. One or two assignments had been turned in and he was able to grade them both before the pizzas arrived.
Tony let his mask up and faced her frowning, “And just when did you figure that out?”
He couldn’t say much else, either, because as he almost made it to the door, Steve blocked his way. The movement forced Tony to look up, away from the tights, and meet Steve’s eyes. Steve’s cheeks were flushed, and he looked about as red as Tony felt, but much angrier. Tony was almost afraid for a moment, but Steve just stayed back against the door, his hands clenched in his jacket pockets.
“You okay?” Rhodey’s tone immediately shifted to concern, and Tony couldn’t help a smile.
“How about we discuss this inside?”
Steve laughed and kissed her forehead. Kat kissed both her fathers on their cheeks and followed Peter into the school. Tony and Steve got back in the car and drove home, spending their first day in about two months without the twins.
"I'm sorry!"
Peter laughed, breathlessly, “Okay! I get it! Let me up! Uncle!”
“I’m sorry, Papa. Daddy. I… I didn’t mean to snap like that.”
Steve stared at him, his jaw clenching. Tony gave his hand a small squeeze.
Peter looked at the drawings again and saw that is was him, Wanda, Pietro, and Wade as superheroes. He smiled, “It was at the middle of her back. Wavy.”
Kat smiled, lazily, “I’m glad you did, though.”
Realization dawned on him slower than he was proud of, but he felt himself flush from a little more than his workout. “Are you alright?” he asked, instead of calling more crude attention to it.
“I love you, too, Daddy.”
Steve heard himself make a noise, feeling rather pathetic, and watched Tony’s eyes dilate. He decided that he couldn’t wait after that, and pulled Tony out of the office towards the bedroom.
Steve didn’t look up at Tony until after he finished speaking. With his arms crossed, and his shoulders slumping, he looked more hurt than angry. Tony didn’t really know what to say.
Steve turned and addressed Thor, “How do we take these guys on without getting ourselves killed, or killing them if we can help it?”
“And?” Bucky pressed. “What did he say?”
“He was a bit busy.”
"Sherlock."
Kat turned her head to see Peter in the doorway. He was still in his pajamas. His hair was ruffled and he looked tired.
Kat giggled, “Well, I was just drawing my friends and Peter and then a comparison.”
Thor surveyed them a moment before answering, “They are brainwashed, but I believe if we hit them hard enough over the head they may revert back to their previous state of mind. This will require hand-to-hand combat, and you must be aware at all times lest they strike you down.” He leaned in closer, “I do not suggest that Peter and Kat engage.”
Steve smiled, “That’s my girl.”
End Chapter Five
The twins turned around and saw Natasha standing in the other doorway to the kitchen. She sauntered in and put a hand on each of their shoulders.
“Ooh!” Loki made a face. “Do you kiss your father with that mouth?”
Steve laughed and pressed a kiss to the side of her head, “You’re welcome, Kat.”
Twins Peter and Kat had been waiting forever. Literally. Their entire lives they’d been waiting to be adopted. It was hard knowing that they hadn’t been wanted by their parents and that no one wanted them, still. But they coped. It wasn’t like they didn’t have friends. They had friends, several that also lived at the orphanage. Like, Wade. Wade was a good friend of theirs, and so were the other pair of twins: Pietro and Wanda.
Out of the corner if his eye, he saw Tony frown. "You know, that's, like, the universal saying that means you're not okay. Talk to me."
“I was going to finish these and study other materials tomorrow.”
“Yeah, but Peter says Dr. Stark is just as bad as you are, so maybe you just need us to talk you guys into it.” She closed her sketchbook, smiling. “Besides, Peter promises Tony’s really nice.”
Kat worked hard on her landings and getting used to the tech of her suit – which Tony had made the necessary changes to, adding a hole for Kat’s high ponytail. She was finally ready to show Fury what she could do.
Steve blinked at him, looking a bit taken aback at the rudeness, but he let it slide. “My scheduled final time was today. I had to give a test.”
End of Chapter Six
“So, um, I was wondering-”
He finished writing out the routine and then pulled his leotard up the rest of the way, making sure the low cut was centered and the straps weren’t twisted. Steve felt himself settle into his video persona, his shoulders loosening and his smile widening. A pack of water bottles sat just out of view of the camera, and Steve set his boombox up right next to it, picking out a good CD. He grabbed one water bottle and took a good drink, setting it within reach, and then turned on his camera to get to work.
Tony scoffed, “You could have been me!”
Loki smiled and moved his wrist. Kat jerked forward and fell on the roof, hard. The backplate of her armor popped off from the impact. Kat pulled herself up and faced the god.
“You only call when something’s wrong,” Rhodey huffed, though his smile was evident in his tone. “Otherwise, you text and demand I come over to give you attention.” Tony couldn’t really argue, and there was a beat or several of silence, before he heard Rhodey sigh, “Is this about the gym teacher again?”
Tony had asked for everyone’s attention and led them all down to the lab. Kat wondered what was up, since everyone else seemed to know what was going on. Clint had a telltale smirk on his face. Thor was grinning the widest she had ever seen him. Bruce was clearly trying to hide his jitters. Natasha seemed cool, but she wasn’t making her classic “why the hell are we doing what Stark says?” face so Kat knew she was in on it. Peter and Steve were trying not to grin like idiots.
Tony smiled, and waited until Peter and Steve had joined them. Tony pulled his camera out his pocket and took a picture of the twins. Steve opened the door to the back seat and Kat and Peter slid inside. Steve made his way to the passenger side of the car and Tony got in the driver’s seat. They pulled out into the street and braced themselves for New York City traffic. It would take them at least 20 minutes to get to the school. They talked on the way.
“I bet,” Kat smiled and squeezed him back. “You have a good day. I know Dad’ll be insufferable without Peter there.”
They all sat for a few moments, silently enjoying each other’s company.
“Fantastic,” Loki called to Kat. “All the others went straight to fighting.”
Peter smiled shyly and walked with Harley over to their lab table. Harley just grinned over at Tony, and then turned to Riri and repeated his question. Doreen answered him, though, her grin still plastered wide on her face.
Steve sighed and kissed Kat’s head.
“Do you want one?” Steve asked.
Summer vacation is important after a stressful school year. Especially to Kat.
Steve took another shaky breath before continuing, “When… when Peter first joined the Avengers, Tony and I were so worried. Kat, we were terrified. But we let him… try it out; let him fight without us being at his back the whole time. It was… hard – to say the least.” A tear made its way down Steve’s cheek. “Kat- “his voice broke and he tried again. “Kat, the first time he was injured you were scared, yes?” Kat nodded. “I promise you, it was ten times as worse for me and Tony. We berated ourselves for not protecting him and keeping him out of harm’s way. We were scared and it was hard to let him back out on the field.”
“I wonder what that meeting with Fury will be about today?” he asked casually. Natasha snorted.
“Look at you gorgeous!” she laughed, slapping a kiss on his cheek.
“Physically he is.” Natasha sighs.
“You’re pining.” She accused, moving forward in her seat, forcing him to look at her.
“It’s this oval ball and you play on a field and tackle people.”
"I see. Should I do it?"
“Tony.” Her expression was soft, fond almost. Pepper had always found his defiance endearing. “You should bring someone, get some photos, show the press you haven’t turned into a monk since we broke up.” It was teasing, he knew it was. Pepper had left him six months ago, and for five months and two weeks he had been jerking off thinking of Steve’s perfect arse, or his hard abs, or the way his voice sounded when he said his name.
“You’re going to marry him?” she asked slowly, Steve couldn’t help his large grin growing larger.
Pepper knocks on his door on a Tuesday. He’s surprised at first, expecting Mrs. Lahey from down the hall needing help with her groceries again.
“Caller ID Cap, we’ve gone through this one before.” He can see the embarrassment on Steve’s face turn to realisation, and then switch back to embarrassment.
“You’re hurting me.” She let go of him quickly, looking at Steve’s hands and then back at his face.
So Clint may or may not have mentioned in passing that Puppy purses were really popular these days and would be great for the team. Steve may or may not have gone to Coulson and asked for an order of six puppy purses.
“Tony.”
It had to be the sewers.
“Nothing.”
Then there was Bruce. He wouldn’t even think of asking for anything in return. He doubted that Bruce would agree to make him acidic arrows though. After avoiding living in Stark Tower for so long Bruce had been forced to move in after his room had been damaged in the sewerage accident- after he had calmed down enough to return to Bruce Banner though. He had hulked out of four days. Clint's pretty sure that Bruce doesn’t even think he should be using normal arrows anymore.
Clint was almost certain that Steve was going to kill Tony for that.
“When I’m tall I’m going to marry Tommy Winkle.” He said determinedly, his mother’s hand slipped on the antiseptic, the bottle falling to the floor.
“Philson buy Hulk oven?” Clint nodded slowly and watched as the Hulk smiled at him. A large green hand came and ruffled his hair, jarring his neck in the process. That was going to need to be looked at by the nurse.

“Pretty sure Tony can fuck wherever he wants in his house.” He says and swears he feels Tony’s cock twitch against his hip.
The building shook around him as another giant cockroach slammed into it, letting out a roar and seriously, since when did cockroaches roar?
Unless it was an accident.
“Sorry big guy.” He said quietly. Thor frowned and shook his head, looking down at the purse affectionately.
“You really think so?” Peter had asked, leaning away from Thor’s neck.
“So how are you doing it?”
Tony tried, and failed.
“Steve you can’t talk like that, it’s not proper do you hear? Boys don’t marry boys and girls don’t marry girls. You don’t ever say anything like that again, not to anyone Steven.” He tried not too flinch at the sharpness of his mother’s words, her fingers pressed deeper into his scrapes and tears pooled in his eyes.
“I love you Tony. I’ll always love you, but I’m not the love of your life.” He couldn’t even argue with her, didn’t beg her to stay when she kissed him softly on the cheek or so much as cry when she finally shut the door behind her.
Firstly, Clint didn't understand how buying arrows to help save the world were a de-vestment. He really thought that they would help save money because acidic arrows meant he would have to use less arrows to destroy things...right?
“How do you know?”
“Coming, coming…your home!” he said happily, stepping into the hallway. Peter didn’t smile like he usually did when his dad showed up, covered in oil and smelling of sweat.
“Steve. I’m really sorry, it’s ok I’ll talk to Fury all right? I can fix this.” Steve didn’t even look at him and Tony put a comforting hand on Steve’s shoulder…so were they a thing then?
“You clean up nicely.” Tony said, announcing his presence on the balcony where Steve is tucked away. The air is chill against his champagne flushed skin, he welcomes it.
"Fine." he sighs standing up and dragging his feet from the room. Coulson doesn't even laugh at his dropped shoulders, fallen head and slow walk. He just sits there impassive and reminds Clint to shut the door behind him.
“Tony didn’t tell you?” Pepper shakes her head, leans back in her seat and stares Steve down. Steve admires her confidence, it reminds him of Peggy, two women not afraid to make themselves comfortable and do whatever the fuck they wanted.
“So you’re using Cap to trick Coulson?” Tony did not look impressed. How on earth was Tony Stark- the man who did what ever the hell he wanted regardless of what people said, not even a little impressed?
“I’m sure you will be, twice as tall more than likely.”
“You better fix this.” She stand standing up and leaving. Thor gave a huff, stomped his foot and turned on his heel following Natasha and leaving Clit alone in the kitchen, no longer hungry for eggs.
“It was a bit of a mess without our fearless leader there. Turns out we don’t make a great democracy. Clint kept telling Thor he’d vote to keep the flying around if he gave him free lifts around the city, then Darcy decided she deserved a say and got on board that band wagon and suddenly it was the three of them against me Nat and Bruce. We argued for hours before finally deciding to flip a coin for it.
"Hey Cap."
There’s radio silence across his coms, he distantly hears the sound of something blowing up.
“Wait!”
“I have no idea what you’re talking about.” He lied. Tony chuckled and began listing things off of his fingers.
“Right. Ok” he nods, and then he just goes, walking down the hall way again, his shoes clicking against the floor. He needs to breathe, he needs to sleep and he needs a good drink. But first he needs to find Steve because if he can’t see Peter then he needs to see Steve. Steve is important and right now he knows Steve needs him because he needs Steve.
“What about the plutonium?” Tony’s smirk faltered for a moment.
“No. You just don’t know the affect you have on people. Really Steve I didn’t meant to use you…just…well…just see if you had a better chance than I did.” Steve shook his head looking like a kicked puppy.
“Wha-”
“You have every right to love Steve, and you deserve to be loved.”
At nights he would lay awake in bed, listening as Steve beat the crap out of everything in the gym, worked himself to breaking point. He would listen to the sobs that followed, that shook him to the core but he wouldn’t move. Natasha’s lullaby would echo through the house as she sung to Peter who would be stirred by his pops sobs. Clint would go to the kitchen and continuously throw darts and Thor could be heard sneaking to check on Peter and Natasha.
“Coulson won’t get him the plutonium.”
“Peter is out of surgery and in recovery, his vitals are good and the swelling has gone down bu-“
“Swelling.” the doctor nods.
Pepper wasn’t the love of his life. No one was. Tony didn’t love.
a cruel voice supplies. Steve doesn’t notice when time speeds up, but suddenly Tony and Pepper are standing right there at their table and Sharon is insisting they join them for a drink.
“Emphasis on the
The fight was not going well.
His skin feels like it’s on fire with Tony being so close, his dick is half hard in his pants, and he can feel the heat of a blush on his face. No matter how hard he tried nothing would make him feel that way Tony did, he knew that. No matter how hard he tried he couldn’t seem to fix himself.
“The purse that you bequeathed me with.”
He keeps walking down the hallway, through the door to the stairwell, down four flights of stairs, out a door, along a balcony, through another door, down another stairway and then he’s there. Sitting in the corner of one of the platforms between stairs, Steve is clutching a clipboard, his knees pulled up to his chest and his shoulders shaking as he sobs into arms. He hasn’t noticed Tony yet, not until he feels a hand gently raking the hair at the back of his neck.
“Don’t ever do that again.” Then Steve’s gone, so fast Tony doesn’t have time to blink away the tears burning his eyes.
“I cant…I can’t remember if he broke his leg or his arm…I can’t...” He stutters out. Tony takes the clipboard and sits it next to Steve before squeezing himself between Steve’s knees and burying his head in Steve’s neck.
When Peter was eight Thor found him crying in the cupboard. At first he had overlooked him, in desperate need for the pop tarts that Tony had hidden away. However when his eyes fell on the small boy Thor frowned and crouched down.
“He doesn’t need a stuff up, that’s what I’m doing stuffing everything up. He has Steve.”
“Thanks.” Steve shifted as Tony strolled over, leaned his back on the balcony and looked Steve up and down.
- Six puppy purses
“Not for putting pickles in his sand which he doesn’t.” Steve let out a long sigh and sat on the bench, twiddling his thumbs and looking down at his lap. Clint moved to sit next to him and noted how when sulking Steve really did look like that scrawny kid from Brooklyn. He wondered if Tony actually felt bad for yelling at Steve about something as ridiculous as pickles- knowing Tony he was probably sulking around as well.
“They came from a diner down the road, owner was pretty upset about his failed health rating. I’m serious.” Steve adds when he catches Tony staring at him, astonished. “I can get you out of the debrief if you want?”
“No.”
Hell. Yeah.
“Come on Barton I’m all for a little rule breaking. How are you getting Coulson to pay for all this stuff.”
“Why did I have to do something?”
“He yells at you all the time.”
“Of course Captain. I suppose I can let it slip just this once.” And then he promptly left the room. Everyone stared after him in shock and Clint allowed himself a small smirk.
“Doing what?” Tony rolled his eyes.
“Jesus Christ.” Clint gapes, looking from Steve to Tony. “You’ve broken him, you’ve completely rebooted the Captain America hard drive.” Tony doesn’t get a chance to reply, Natasha suddenly has one arm around Clint’s neck, holding him in a tight headlock.
The staring at Steve couldn’t be helped.
“Stevie?” His mother called from the kitchen, he walked in forgetting the sting of his hands and knees as his heart swelled in his chest.
“So you’re not…I mean…you’re not ashamed of me?” Tony shakes his head and looks into Peter’s hopeful eyes.
Steve can’t find the strength to speak, he’s too focused on how close Tony is, he can smell his after shave if he breathes deep enough, feel the air shift when Tony moves his arm or shakes his leg under the table. Steve feels as though the air between them is crackling with electricity, he’s desperate to reach out and put a hand on his knee, to hook his foot around Tony’s ankle, to just touch him.
“You don’t have to explain…I understand you know. I’m the son of Iron Man and Captain America, the Avengers baby it must be hard to have something so important broken and not fix it. I just…I wish…don’t you love me?” Peter asks broken, ignoring the anger and instead sinking into despair, Tony gives a choked sigh and cups Peter’s cheek, wiping away a stray tear.
Secondly the sewerage incident was not his fault and he was going to stick by that until the day he died. If anything, S.H.I.E.L.D should be blaming Tony. It was his stupid idea to go into the sewers and play ‘Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles’ because Steve liked the show and they had to do something special for him. Clint had been the one who suggested that they just play it in the mansion and cover everything in black sheets so it’s dark and dreary looking.
“No names over coms” Tony scalds, teasingly. Steve is still focused on trying to find him, he leaps over crushed cars and giant pot holes.
“Poochy?” Thor flushed but otherwise kept his own.
Steve doesn’t see Sharon again, she tells him to call her and when he doesn’t she stops coming over for scrabble and jeopardy and Steve finds himself alone.
"Clint. Can I help you with anything?" Clint shrugged-yes- and sat on the ledge of the roof, feet dangling above the ground far below.
Arrows were harmless- well sort of…not really but Clint wasn’t going to hurt anyone who didn’t deserve it.
“He’s in surgery? Who signed the release papers? Was it Steve? Wait…Steve…where…where’s Steve?” The desperate tinge to his voice didn’t go unnoticed and Pepper fought a wince at Tony’s pleading eyes.
“I’m making you a new phone. One you can’t squish to pieces with those giant hands of yours.” Tony said, eyes on those hands wishing desperately they were in his pants right now, grabbing his arse, stroking him hard, biting into his hip as Steve fucked him. His eyes flickered to Steve’s face to find a soft blush dusting his cheeks.
“It means that Peter might not be able to walk again.” Natasha tells him gently, suddenly behind him, her hands on his shoulders. Steve almost cries, he almost does but Tony beats him to it and before he can register his own emotions Tony’s body has collapsed onto Steve’s and there is a strangled sob coming from his throat as Steve pulls him tightly to his chest.
Peter was almost at the kitchen when he heard the scurrying and sounds of pots and pans crashing. He almost screamed for his dad before he heard the familiar groan of Thor and a few Asgardian swear words such as ‘Curse the frost giant toe’ ‘Frost giant sandwich’ and ’nose of a green frost giant’ just to name a few. Smiling fondly he wheeled himself into the kitchen where Thor had his head stuck in the cupboard under the sink.
“Yes.”
“Ah.” Steve’s eyes drop to the floor, Tony feels guilt clench in his stomach
“Hulk keep puppy, puppy is Hulks.” The team collectively sighs, Steve wonders how long they had been debating with Hulk about the puppy before they found his pod. By the resigned looks on everyone’s face he was guessing a while.
“Very. Thanks for caring sweetheart.” Tony shouts back.
“What is it?” Steve asked gently, his palm cupping Peter’s cheek. Peter leaned into his dad’s hand, even though he had often said he was too old for such affection. Peter let out a jagged breath and looked into Steve’s eyes.
“They are, cleaners are pretty annoyed I keep breaking them. I’ve started cleaning up the messes myself but still…” Steve trails off, giving his shoulder a small shrug. There is a lot of space between them, Tony feels every inch of it, desperate to close the gap just a bit but unwilling to trust himself to do so. “What are you doing here?”
“No.” a beat.
“That was…admirable?” Tony chuckles, he steps further into the room so he can lean against the wall, Steve shifts just a little, his shirt is so tight it could be painted on, could no one in this building get the man clothes that fit him?
Under the hard glares of his colleagues Clint decided he had to confess because Tony looked like he was about to grab him by the neck and strangle him. Just as he had opened his mouth, however, Steve had stood up and looked up at Fury with large wide blue eyes. Oh God, not on Fury! Clint thought desperately as Steve held the Colonel’s gaze.
Clint hadn't meant to get Natasha mad. That was the last thing he wanted to do because a mad Natasha meant no sex so really it was just going to punish himself if he said something to annoy her.
"Why not just ask for new ones?" because I've already been told no five times.
- One Barbie Easy Bake Oven
"Well I was thinking of getting her this vodka she likes- Russo-Baltique."
He didn’t come in for a few more hours.
“I am so insanely proud of you Peter. You are a strong brave man and I will never be disappointed in you. You could never disappoint me because you are so much like your pop, you are so good and you have so much strength and I have so much belief in you. Don’t ever doubt that Peter.” Peter gives a small timid smile and curls into Tony’s chest, strong arms wrap around him and his head is slightly pressed against the arc reactor. Tony holds Peter tightly, feeling his son in his arms and giving a wide grin as tears fall down his face.
“Mr. Stark, during the operation we noticed some serious swelling on the L2 through to L5 vertebrae.”
“Peter…I want to tell you…about what I was doing in the lab…it’s not…”
“Hulks coming, just…” Steve is obviously searching for something to say that isn’t ‘hold on’ or ‘hang tight’. The spinning and jerking stops, and for one sweet moment Tony feels relief, until he suddenly realises he’s falling 20 floors and is still 30 seconds away from firing up his blasters.
“That was NOT MY FAULT! JUST BECAUSE TONY’S IN LOVE WITH YOU OR SOMETHING!” Steve blushed a bright red and Tony looked at Clint angrily, glaring at him over the table.
“He’s bee-”
“No idea.” She supplies before catapulting the head she’s holding at a bot flying towards them
“Please.”
“Fine.”
“You’re sorely mistaken if you think I’m going to let you start eating my pop tarts again.” Tony says, eyes flicking up to him. Steve laughs, throws his towel over his shoulder.
“Its just…Tony’s mad at me.” Dear God those two needed to be locked in a room together. Clint was going to make sure of it because really this was getting ridiculous.
“My brother who is part Frost Giant. He is small for his kind but filled with power. You will meet him I predict.”
“Dad’s getting grumpy.” Clint jokes and Steve sighs, throwing himself into tearing apart as many bots as he can.  Hulk roars through the city, swatting the bots away like they’re flies.
“What did you do Clint Barton?” Ok so maybe she didn’t know…but she still knew…he was never going to understand that woman.
Sitwell said no.
Each time Clint tried to explain that it really wasn’t his fault and Tony should be blamed, some S.H.I.E.L.D agent would start yelling about how they were never going to get the smell out of their room or Fury would mutter about how much it cost to have the entire cafeteria redone.
"Yeah." Steve frowned and rubbed the back of his neck.
These apologies meant little to Peter, he had never been one to hold a grudge and it wasn’t surprising when Peter had apologised for ruining Harry’s chance of football that year.
“Steve wait!” Tony called standing up and running after him. Clint let out a long sigh and looked at Thor and Natasha.
Thor comes over once and Steve lets him in because he genuinely seems to think Steve’s body has been taken over by some alien race and insists on monitoring him for 24hrs. He enjoys it a lot more than he should, Thor is loud and friendly and doesn’t ask the wrong questions.
“Ste-” Tony’s cut off by two phones beeping, because of fucking course evil takes six weeks off and then decides to come back the exact moment he’s pretty sure Steve Rogers is confessing his love for him.
“How’s your head?”
“I hear you at the gym, in Peter’s room, in the kitchen, getting into bed early in the morning and then just lying there not really sleeping. Just go to bed, Peter will be fine.”
“What are you doing?” He had asked, knowing full well why Thor would be searching the kitchen in the early hours of the morning.
“I don’t need sleep Tony- serum remember? I need to see my son, now if you’ll just” There was a grunt, a bit of banging, a hiss and then a loud groan. Peter sighed, and tried to cover his ears with his pillow like he had when he was a child. But he couldn’t ignore it, the cry of anguish outside his door, the yelling, the arguing, the pain of his fathers words.
Tony closed the distance between them by reaching forward and trailing his fingers along Steve’s jaw in a feather-light touch. Steve stared at him intensely, breath stuttering out of his parted lips, leaning forward just the slightest.
“Hulk no like lying to Philson. Philson buy Hulk Band-Aids!”
that must mean something.” Steve felt hot tears slide down his face, Pepper’s hand came up and lightly brushed one away.
Regardless, Clint was not going to accept that as a reason for why he could not get those arrows. It’s not like he was going to end the world with them. Quite the opposite in fact, he was going to save the world from evil forces that just liked to pop up and try and make everyone fear their impending doom. And besides, it wasn’t as if he was asking for plutonium like Stark was.
Hill said no.
“Do you want to come in.”
“You would know that how?” Tony shrugs, gives a sigh, opens him mouth a few times to speak, shrugs again and then groans, sitting back in his chair and frowning.
“It’s a…a…tear uncle Thor…I’m…I’m Crying.” Peter had hiccupped, not looking up from his knees as he did so.
What had been going on while he was away?
He had been bowling on the Wii, bored out of his brains as he waited for Natasha to come home with dinner. It turns out that as great as Stark Tower was it wasn’t baby proof so someone had to stay home with the eleven-month-old Peter who refused to do anything but roll around on his stomach.
“Steve’s somewhere filling in paperwork, he needed space to breathe.” Tony nods. Or maybe he shakes his head, or maybe he just rolls his neck. Either way he feels dizzy as he gives a strangled yes and tries to keep breathing. He can already feel the effects of Pepper’s mystery pills on his mind as he keeps breathing. Just keep breathing he tells himself.
“How is he?” Steve asks in a strained tone, his eyes wide in desperation. The doctor clears his throat.
“So if Tony got his plutonium he wouldn’t be mad at me any more?”
“You don’t mind do you Stevie?” She asks, not noticing his wince at the nickname.
Tony touched his fingers to the back of his head, brought his arm around to stare at the crimson blood on his fingertips.
“Tony!” Steve calls, stepping into the house, Pepper pushing Peter through the door with a very small knitted blanket on his lap. He didn’t care if it was only big enough to cover a baby because Pepper had made it for him, and he loved it.
“I...I didn't know where to start .” Steve’s hand twitches at his side, Tony wants to reach out and feel it on his face, he can’t though, won’t, terrified to push the boundaries between them again.
“Legs?” He asks like he’s interested even though he’s not.
“Hey” Steve called from the doorway. Tony runs his roach gut and oil coated hand through his hair.
The thing about being a superhero is you know pretty quickly where the quickest and most discreet exits are from a building. Steve bypasses the bathroom altogether and heads straight for the staff exit. He spots two cooks smoking by the back alley wall, they don’t stop talking to look at him so he leans against the wall and just tries to breathe.
This was going to be the last. He swore it. Buying Thor a puppy purse just seemed like to good an opportunity to let pass.
“Look Tony’s just stressed because of his work.”
“I think that would be best.” Steve regrets the decision, picturing all the things in his house she can use to maim him. Pepper comes in and heads straight to the small table in the kitchen, sitting on a rusted fold out chair, placing her bag on the floor next to her.
“Well…what if…what if I got Philson to buy you oven you wanted?”
“No.”
“Indeed. I once told him of how whilst battling a frost giant my good friend fell through the cracks of ice. His spine was implanted with frost giant ice and he could not walk. So we built him legs as he was a fine warrior and such injury would prevent him form walking in the footsteps of our ancestors.” Thor says it proudly. Natasha, Jane and Pepper just glare at him, Clint clears his throat awkwardly and Bruce shakes his head.
The date August 17th had never meant much to Peter.
Fury had laughed in his face.
“You need to sleep Steve!”
“Not off the top of my head. Pass the salt Steve?” Quick as lightening Natasha grabbed Steve’s wrist in her hand and held it there, hovering over the salt. Her ees turned dark.
Once she tries to corner him at S.H.E.I.L.D with a fierce determination on her face, luckily Fury needs him to sign some paperwork and Steve has never been so happy to be locked in a room with a flickering light and creaky chair.
Steve and Tony sit in silence amongst the others as the two women answer the questions thoroughly and precisely. Has he broken bones before. Allergies. Past operations. Age. Side effects of any past injuries. Blood type. Things that never really seem important but suddenly are.
“We miss your presence at the tower Steve, our brothers and sisters in arms will be glad to know you are still you.” Thor tells him, warm hand on his shoulder.
“Funny.” Tony replies before throwing his full force into the blasters. The foam around him shakes and slowly begins to crack away. Steve reaches out again to punch it, breaking through. The sun burning on his face as he takes deep breaths of air. The team all stand around him, worry and relief mixing on their face.
“You built him legs…because he wasn’t good enough.”
Peter awoke to the sound of hushed arguing outside his door.
“Hulk save puppy!” the big green man said, standing tall with a tiny dog in his palm, the animal seemed barley phased as Hulk made cooing noises at it.
So when Steve drops to his knees and whispers his name Peter replies with a gentle ‘papa’ and Steve pulls him form the stupid chair and into his lap. Cradling him in his arms and rocking him back and forth, slowly, gently, carefully.
Pepper had gotten out before she had become broken, before she didn’t work quite like she used too. Tony couldn’t even be mad when she had packed all her things one day and left.
Harry had been with Peter every step so far. His first day at rehabilitation, pushing him, telling him not to give up.
“Yeah?” he turned around slowly hoping Steve wasn’t smart enough to have caught on to his sign.
"Knock one more time Barton and I'll give you a years worth of paperwork to file." Coulson said as the door opened. He stood there firmly, shorter than Clint but watching him with skeptical eyes. His suit was immaculate- as if he hadn't just helped stop doombots from once again taking over New York City.
“Tony?!?” Steve called a little louder, his voice somewhat sterner.
“He’s lost it.” Peter declares as they look around the house, and they all knew it’s true. Everything, literally everything had been redone. All of it wheel chair compatible, all of it making Peter’s job a little easier, a little less noticeable. The counters had been moved down, the floors all smooth, the carpets ripped up, bars in random parts of the hallway and that was just what they could see from the door.
“It’s really not as bad as you think…”
No. Definitely not Tony.
“It will be alright.” Tony whispers and it’s a blatant lie. They both know it. Nothing is going to be all right because for all they know Peter could be bleeding out on an operating table right now and they might never see him smile or laugh or make some witty science joke again. And that is most definitely not all right.
"Because I want the acidic ones from Spain." Steve took in a sharp breath. He probably didn't think Clint should have arrows either. It was all Tony's fault. Bloody sewers, he would never ever go and play any sort of game in them again. He didn't care how much fund it was going to be.
Clint stared down at the letter in his hands from S.H.I.E.L.D that had arrived for him that morning. Tony had brought it in from the hallway with a large smirk on his face.
Steve spends all his spare time in the gym; breaking weight after weight, bag after bag, turning the gym into a pile of scrap metal and sand.
“Indeed, power is important in the house of Odin as is mobility. He was a fine warrior once fixed.”
Three days later Clint got a letter asking to come and check the design for the acidic arrows.
“Captain.” Tony replied. Steve doesn’t move, he tries desperately to just take a step back and then another so he can keep going until he’s as far away from Tony as possible. He can’t though, his feet glued to the ground, still close enough that he can smell Tony, all oil and sweat with an underlying tang of aftershave.
Literally.
“Because of…well…”
“Can we see him?” Tony asks, springing up from his seat and picking at the skin on his thumb with his forefinger, a nervous habit he never really dropped.
“Nah. He’s just being Tony.”
“No. Why am I always the one who gets blamed first?” He shouted, chucking perhaps a little bit of a hissy fit. But really, this was going to stop now because even if he did do something this time that didn’t mean he had done something the other gazillion times he got the blame.
"No. It could trace back to her or me, which could cause huge issues with the reds. The only one that could probably get it without alerting anyone of our identity is Coulson but I'm still trying to thank him for the arrows." Steve nodded and joined Clint on the ledge.
Until the year 2022 that is.
“Pepper came to see me.” That was not what he was expecting, Steve’s eyes flick across his face and he’s sure the surprise is clear. “She, well she said somethings that I needed to hear, things about…me and my
"What can I help you with Barton?" Clint falters for a moment.
On these nights, with sleep nowhere in sight and temptation too close for comfort he heads out in the crisp air, runs to the tower and stares up at the windows, wondering if Tony is staring back down at him.
Tony doesn’t hear Natasha enter the room, but that’s not surprising because it’s Natasha. When he does notice he jumps out of the air and burns himself with his blow torch.
“I know where dad hid the pop tarts.” Peter whispered, eyes wide and darting around to make sure Tony wasn’t around.
“Fuck.” He said, just before a large crack formed where his hand was.
he tries to remind himself.
“Steve.” He tries to push down the bile that slides up his throat at how broken Tony sounds, he turns just slightly, enough to see the pain etched all over Tony’s face, and then walks away without looking back.
“Coulson will do anything if Cap asks him for it.”
Steve can’t help the laugh that bubbles through his lips, leaning his forehead against Tony’s when he feels the man’s chest shake in response.
The date starts smoothly.
“I know” it’s filled with more certainty than anything Steve has said  “Tony I…where I’m from,
.......
He swivels in his chair to see Steve standing there, hands in pockets, rocking back on his feet.
“We want to see him now.” Steve mutters and the doctor nods pointing to a room down the hall.
“Felt a bit bad for the guy when we won, almost decided to do a best of three thing, But Nat took the coin before anyone had a chance to mess it up.” Steve’s still got a wide grin on his face, shaking his head at Tony like he’s something else entirely.  Tony’s not sure if Steve means to step closer to him but he does, the air comes alive with electricity. “Why do you keep calling me?”
“That’s a lot.”
“Thor wanted to see Jane, I said I’d drive him.”
“Are you ok?” Sharon asks, clearly taken aback from his outburst. Pepper smiles but her eyes ask him questions he doesn’t want to answer.
“Building I’m…I’m helping Peter, I need to do something so I’m going to fix him.”
“Pepper…” he gulped, his gut twisting with a familiar wave of anxiety. She gave his hand a tight squeeze before pulling away.
"Steve? Dear God! Get off of there before you drop to your death or something!" Tony yelled from behind them. Both men turned to see Tony standing there standing at Steve, pale in the face and eyes wide. Steve chuckled.
“Oh thank God.” Tony gasped, tears filling his eyes that he desperately held back before hugging Peter as tightly as he could without hurting him.
When she mentions a new Thai place she’s been dying to try he asks her to go, and when she looks up at him from under her eyelashes any hope that she might have thought just as friends leaves and he tells her he’ll pick her up at 7 o’clock.
“I…” Tony stared up at Steve’s twisted face, he watched one shaking twitch, as though Steve was about to reach out to him.
“Some things make days’ worth staying.” It’s the look Steve gives him when he says it that makes Tony think, just for a moment, he’s one of those things.
“ttttttssssit!” Peter gurgled and Natasha froze. Peter might not be able to say his ‘Sh’ but she definitely knew what that word was.
“Tony” Steve goes to touch him, he really does, his hand reaches out to grab the belt loops of his jeans and pull him close.
“Tat Tat Tat!” Peter said sloppily, his feet moving him around in all directions before he took a rocking step, turning himself around and facing Natasha who was standing in the doorway, smiling at Peter widely and looking like she was…
“I’m going to make this quick. I have no idea what you have done to Agent Coulson or how you got him to agree to purchasing these things. So I will give you five minutes to sort out your stories and tell me exactly what’s GOIN ON.” The Avengers all sat in the conference room awkwardly. Clint was reminded of the time he and Barney had let out the horses at the circus and been scolded. Looking up from his lap he saw Tony, Natasha and Bruce glaring at him while Steve looked at the table miserably and Thor was- Clint blinked…was Thor actually crying?
“I could set yo-”
“Alcoholism, crippling self-centeredness, constant neglect?” he supplied, wishing she would make true on her word and leave him alone. Pepper sighed, her hand reaching across the table to take his own.
“Colonel Fury sir, we are all very sorry for what happened when you were away and understand it was a breach of conduct. I hope that you won’t punish Agent Coulson as it was all my fault for what happened and I wish too take the blame for me team.” Clint hissed as Natasha kicked him under the table. ‘Stop this’ she mouthed and Clint looked at her helplessly. Tony pinched his arm hard because Tony wasn’t going to let his lover boy take the blame was he? That would mean a sulking Cap, which would mean Tony would sulk because the Cap was sulking. As it turned out, Clint didn’t have to take the blame because Fury blinked a few times and then nodded slowly.
When he dropped Steve at his door he pulled out a butterscotch and turned on his heel with a wink. Steve was smiling so wide his face hurt when he stepped inside, the candy slipped into his pocket.
"Wouldn't dream of it."
“I can’t live with myself if I let you carry that monstrosity around for a moment longer.” Tony snatched up the phone and turned to leave.
Invoice for twelve dozen acidic arrows
Natasha could always use that scary voice of hers that has everyone hold their breath and hide- even Steve who’s her favorite. She wouldn’t though. Clint could already see the way she would make that noise in the back of her throat, which everyone knows is a laugh, and walk away rolling her eyes. Maybe he could withhold sex until she got him the arrows. No, that always backfired when Natasha agreed with him and kept a good distance between them in the bed. Clint normally caved two days later.
“I never doubted you.”
Once the jar of desperate want had been opened Tony couldn’t manage to put a lid on it. He found his eyes trailing to Steve constantly, studying the line of his jaw, following his arse has his walked, eyes raking down long firm legs, sweeping over his broad shoulders, lingering a little too long on his lips.
“Holy Shit.” His screens go blank before a small loading bar appears on the screen,
“I should…” he goes to move, tries to step as far to the side as possible to avoid brushing up against Tony.
Thanks everyone for reading this little fic, I had fun writing it.
Quotes on how much it would be to repair the sewers- that was coming out of Barton’s pay.
Music is blasting through the house when Bruce and Peter get back, the heavy metal causing the walls to vibrate as each guitar cord shakes the frame, sends a shrill tingle up everyone’s spine.
He had been reaching for a glass on the top shelf, leaning forward, using one of his arms to support his weight. It all happened very quickly then. One minute the chair was rocking, then it was rolling from under him, Thor turned in time to cry and leap to catch him and Peter closed his eyes. But nothing happened. Thor wasn’t holding him, he hadn’t hit the ground, he was just standing there. Eyes shut tightly, he heard the scrambling of feet down the hall- a result of Thor’s loud call of “PETER!” There was a gasp though, a loud gasp and then Peter opened his eyes. One hand braced on the kitchen counter, the other stretched out in front of him Peter was standing, not leaning, not holding himself up by his arms but firmly standing on two feet. He looked at the floor where Thor was lying, eyes wide, his fathers standing in the hallway, hands clasped as tears swelled in their eyes.
Clint was almost certain that if it wasn’t for his random kicks when he was grumpy that he couldn’t actually use his legs. Tony and Steve had been at a SHIELD meeting with Fury, Bruce was in the middle of a break through and Thor was off with Jane. Peter had been lying on his interactive mat that Tony had made for him.
“Ready guys?” Steve asked.
Spiderman. Spiderman. Does whatever a spider can.
Tony smiled and hugged her again.
Okay? Steve was
One more after this, guys!
“You’re welcome,” said a voice from behind.
Kat smiled widely, “Thank you, Director Fury. I won’t disappoint.”
"I couldn't take any chances."
With Christmas a week away and Steve going to spend the majority of the holiday at his Ma’s apartment, he and Tony had decided it might be best to get together beforehand. Nothing fancy, just to see if this was something they really wanted to pursue. Steve wanted to. He’d worked so hard to get to at least this point; he really hoped it didn’t end here. So, Tony was coming over the Thursday after finals. A week seemed appropriate, just to give them both time to relax after the stress of it all, and to think about what they wanted to do.
Tony sighed, “He- he taunted us, and we tried to get you from him. But he, I’m not sure what it is he actually does. He teleported to the side of the building, tossed you over the side, and then he disappeared. I tried to follow you, to catch you. But Peter already had you safely on the ground, so I flew back up to get Steve.”
“I already grabbed something to eat.”
“Tony, you’re our air support. But keep it low. I need you to be close enough for your blasters to have enough force behind them.
End of Chapter One
Steve rolled his eyes again as Sam sat down on Bucky’s other side. “For some reason, I’m not very reassured.”
"Goddammit, Steve."
Silence continued to stretch between them, Steve’s eyes still wide with surprise. Tony sighed and ducked his head, setting aside his thermos.
Tony laughed, “I get it, Steve. Just don’t worry about it. But maybe you could help me ta-.“
“Just Dr. Stark.” She glanced down at the page, and gasped in exaggerated shock. “Oh, and you’re there too.”
He shut off his comm and then focused on his work. He finished with the files and then hurried to get out of the room. He heard the first explosion go off farther away in the building, and started to run faster. Another explosion went off and shook the ground a little. It was closer, and Steve was starting to panic. No, no he needed to get out! He kept running, pushing himself harder. A third explosion rocked the hallway and he fell forward. He caught himself and then pushed himself up and started running. Just another turn... one more and he'd be out.
tights. And a leotard. Tony could imagine the crop top he was probably wearing, but it was hidden under Steve’s winter coat. Steve gave him an awkward smile and wave, and then pointed over at the thermos.
"You have the team. You have other people that care about you. Tony, I don't know how many people you've lost besides your parents, but I...." He couldn't finish the sentence. He'd lost both his parents. He lost his only friend in the world, and then got a different man back. Peggy just died. He'd woken up in a different time, leaving everyone he'd known behind. He didn't even belong in this century. "I couldn't handle losing someone else."
“-if you might be free this weekend. I have a friend who works at this café-”
“Not quite. I mean, after last week, I thought you filmed at the school.” He walked around the back of the desk, looking at the camera over Steve’s shoulder.
“Now remember, make sure they all know you’re not to be tangled with.”
“Before I take the test.”
“I’ll do my best.”
“Tony! We’re looking for the wrong thing!”
Peter nudged her and whispered, “Watch it.”
Peter led Tony into the building. Kat turned to Steve and they just looked at each other for a few moments.
(See the end of the chapter for
Peter smiled, “I’m your big brother! I’m supposed to worry about you!”
"I was going to!" Peter explained.
(See the end of the chapter for
“It just kind of happened.”
"Steve I can't...."
It took them nearly half an hour to get to the hospital. Once there, they had to wait about an hour to see her. When they were finally let in, Kat’s family never left her side. All seven of them stayed all night while Kat slept.
Steve and Tony loved it and said they looked forward to hearing more from their new musicians. Then, both twins looked at each other and started to play the song Steve was teaching them in the car. Steve clapped his hands and laughed. Tony’s eyes widened and he stared at Steve who was still laughing as Peter and Kat continued to play.
Loki held the girl against his chest. He used on hand to hold her arms behind her back and the other was resting over her throat. He began to walk forward, stopping halfway across the roof. There, Kat’s parents could clearly see the extent of her injuries. She was not putting weight on her left leg, leading them to assume that it was injured in some way. Her arms were both scraped and bleeding through the under-suit she was wearing, and so were her legs and face. She did not look as though she’d been hit, but rather had skidded across the pavement several times.
"Sam called me. Said you'd been in the middle of an explosion. I wanted to make sure you were okay."
“I won’t,” Kat lied.
"Tony, they'll be back any moment and demand our answer," Steve reminded him, weakly.
They drove the rest of the way in companionable silence. When they finally got back to the tower, they realized that they’d lost Steve and Peter in traffic. Instead of waiting, they loaded some boxed onto one of the elevators and took them up into their correct rooms, depending on if they were Kat’s or Peter’s.
“I am so proud of you!” Steve cried.
“Did I fall asleep?”
For a moment, he wondered if the comment was a little too much, too fast. But Tony blushed prettily, and Steve couldn’t help as his smirk grew into a grin.
“You know, these are really good, but where are Thor and I?”
Bruce chuckled and turned to wish Peter well. Kat moved on to Natasha, who hugged her.
That didn’t mean Tony was proud of what he did with that privacy. He resisted his laptop as long as possible. It stayed in his bedroom while he set up in the dining room to grade all the papers he’d been forgetting in his office for a month. Dinner was ordered and consumed as he graded. He forced himself to think of his students; Peter, Doreen, Riri, Harley… Everyone was expecting their papers back before their finals and he really needed to get this done. As the temperature dropped quickly with the sun, Tony grabbed a blanket instead of turning up the heat. Anything to remind him that crop tops were not appropriate things to think about right now. It was too cold for that.
“Ah, but you were only helping; analyzing. You saw a quicker way out. Even Stark did not think of this.”
Monday morning, Tony brought coffee from home, shame heating his cheeks at the mere thought of running into Steve in the break room. But by lunch, his thermos was empty and he needed more. He fidgeted with his glasses as he stared at the clock, trying to decide if he had time to make a pot in the break room without being caught. If he waited any longer, though, he’d be late for the lab section of his engineering class. He took a deep breath and slipped out of his room. The hall was pretty empty. Sweet.
Tony looked up from his paperwork, sighing softly. He really needed to get his grading done before he gave his final exam. “Yes, Peter?”
There was a patch over one side of his forehead, and scars healing on his nose and cheek. His arm was in a sling, and he could see the outline of the casts on his legs under the blankets. It made him sad to see Steve like this. Steve never let himself get hurt like this on missions. Safety was priority number one. Always.
Clint sat on the couch sulking.
“No idea. Maybe something to do with the bug. Gonna have to get some samples to know for sure.”
“Hulk no tell Clint’s secret. Hulk get oven!” Clint chuckled.
“Hey Clint.” He mutters, shoulders dropped as he moves to attach another bag to the chain. Clint watches the way he drags his feet the grab a broom and sweep some of the sand into a large pile in the corner.
“Okay.” Steve choked out behind him, Tony threw him a look over his shoulder, certain that Steve’s eyes had flicked up from his arse, the thought made him take a quick detour in the bathroom before going back to work.
He wonders,
Then he was careening back, thrown with such force he didn’t have time to catch his footing as he fell, head clanging on the corner of his desk before he crumpled to the floor.
Steve hated hearing about him more than Tony, he suspected that it had something to do with him finding out that the Howard who had made him who he is wasn’t the Howard he thought he was.
“Avengers.” Fury spoke as he walked in all in black- as usual. He looked menacing and dark, his coat swooping behind him like a cape as he came to stand in front of them all.
"That's correct sir." Coulson passed him a bottle of water and Clint smiled appreciatively, washing the taste out of his mouth.
“B-but Michael Connors says you can’t be small and play football.”
with Tony, its freaky arm has him trapped as it scrambles around headless.
“You’re not sick, Steve, there’s no evil spirits inside you controlling your actions, you’re not broken or damaged, you’re not an embarrassment. I know that waking up from the ice mustn’t have been easy, you were alone and lost in a way no one had ever experienced, but when you woke from that ice you woke up in the future. You got to see the hard work that came from the war you helped win, experience the magic of modern medicine. You woke up in a time where you can love, Steve, where there’s a stronger voice for people who spent so long suffering, hiding, hating themselves, turning away love because it was wrong.” Pepper gave his hands a tighter squeeze. “Don’t let this second chance go because you were told by so many people there was something wrong with you. The serum Steve, the serum healed every one of your illnesses, so if you’re feelings are still there than surely,
“Well I had no idea why you got that but I know it was you. So spill. Are you screwing him?”
“Yeah.”
“It’s two am. They should be out with another update shortly.” Right on cue a man in green scrubs walks out.
“Bruce and Jane helped.” he admitted smugly.
Even after hours in the gym there are nights where he lays in his small bed, an anxious hum keeping his awake. If he does fall asleep nightmares grip him, he’s falling into the ice, drowning as cold water pierces his lungs.
“I’m just being a good leader.” He tries and Tony laughs, loud and clear and happy because Steve is still holding him up and when he leans his head onto the mans bicep he doesn’t pull away.
“It’s Steve.” He expected a gasp, maybe a head shake, even a ‘what the fuck’, but Pepper just gave him a soft knowing smile. “You don’t look surprised.”
“I love you.” Steve whispers against Tony’s hair, Tony gives a small smile into his neck.
“I…” the words wouldn’t come, the anxiety in his chest rose into his throat, choking him up, his mouth going dry.
“Pete?” Tony whispered, suddenly at Steve’s side, holding his hand tightly.
“And what evil has brought you pain! In the name of Asgard I Thor from the house of Odin shall not rest until you are Avenged!” Peter had stumbled over a laugh then and reached his small arms up, begging to be lifted. Thor, feeling a flutter in his heart, obliged, picking up the young boy who nuzzled his neck.
“Pe – Ow!” he grabbed his arm where she had pinched him. “If I tell you will you leave me alone…I do have a company to run.” Pepper gave him a look that made it very clear who was actually running the company between the two of them.
That wasn’t good enough for Tony I-will-not-recognise-the-massive-crush-I-have-on-Captain-America Stark.
“I’ll leave you alone for the rest of the working day.” That was an offer too good to pass up.
“I’m okay with the phone I have now.” He motioned to the brick flip phone sitting on the table.
“Loki?” Peter questioned and Thor nodded.
“Maybe you don’t, but they do.” Peter looks at Bruce who is staring over the lake, not even moving his eyes to look at him.
“It’s hard, for all of us it’s hard. What’s the point of having super powers if we can’t use them to save the ones we love?”
"See you Clint!" Steve called and Clint rolled his eyes.
“Well you do get us in trouble a lot…like the sewerage incident…” Clint looked at Steve who was very deliberately staring at the table. His wrist still in Natasha’s hand and hovering over the salt.
Occasionally Pepper would show up and sleep in Peter’s room, or on Steve’s side of the bed, just holding Tony’s hand as he tried to understand exactly what was happening. Everyone was on autopilot, just going through the motions of living.
“Had a few false starts.” Tony waves behind him, Steve turns to see twelve smashed foam prisons.
She would come over during days he was home and play slow games of scrabble with him, watch Jeopardy, laugh at his bad jokes that he knew were bad because Tony always told him they were, and even brings him a casserole that he can freeze.
There’s a smear of oil on his jaw from Tony’s touch, his lips are still stinging from the feel of Tony’s against his.
Life falls into a rhythm of lonely meals and empty nights spent in the gym, running until the treadmill breaks from his speed, lifting weights until the floor is dented from him dropping them on the floor, and breaking boxing bags until the gym floor is more sand than wood.
“I love you too. I was thinking McDonald’s for dinner…Pete’s addicted to the crap.”
“Steve I’m not here to dance around truths or find out who hurt who. Frankly I think you’re both idiots.” She takes a long sip of her water. “ I’m going to tell you something and then I’m going to leave. You can do what you want with the information, I won’t come back here though. Not again.” Steve nodes in understanding.
“Tony.” Steve nodded when he entered the kitchen, poured himself a coffee and watched Steve eat a slice of toast, thick with PB&J.
“I’m always worried about you.”
"Fine is not what I'd be calling a flattened out Captain America. Come to my lab I have some designs I want to show you." When Steve looked like he would protest Tony grabbed his hand and yanked.
“Your heart stop for me Steve?”
“Jarvis?” There’s silence, and Tony can’t help but groan.
, which again you can thank me for.” Tony grabs a pop tart and takes a bit, smiling up at Steve through his teeth. “Strawberry’s not even my favourite flavour.” Steve knows there’s still post fight adrenalin coursing through his veins, there’s also pure relief at not be encapsulated in foam.
“Already here Cap, I got this one.”
“I do the shopping.”
Steve’s puppy eyes worked on Nick Friggen Fury.
“Honestly?” Peter doesn’t even grace this with a response, instead he rolls his eyes and Bruce gives him a small smile, placing a hand on his shoulder.
The disappointment of Stark men to those around them seemed to be a generational thing.
“What? No! I’m dating Natasha.” Clint blushed and frowned at Tony’s chuckle.
“Yeah?”
“The weather’s finally shaping up.” he tries, filling a glass with shaking hands.
True to her word Pepper doesn’t come back.
“Shit Nat” he chokes out. Natasha keeps him firmly tucked to her.
“I meant what I said that day Tony. I’m not the love of your life, that doesn’t mean no one is.” He watched her go, silently closing the door behind her.
“You sure do.”
"Nat's feeling pretty home sick at the moment." he started. God what a lie.
Maybe they’re not the two best people to love, but together they’ll learn.
Thank you Steve.
“What’s got you down soldier?” he nudged Steve’s shoulder with his own, desperately supressing the urge to bury his head in Steve’s neck and just breathe.
“Are you alright?”
And he had.
“Why not?” Clint sucked in a deep breath, it was now or never right? And if it meant Tony was going to stop snapping at Cap and walking around like the entire world had ended then it was worth it.
“Have you got a date?” Tony sighed, pushing his paper work aside.
Form after form he had filed in- writing what the arrows were like, the size, feather count, angle of the tip- everything that he would need so that S.H.I.E.L.D weapons could make them. But everyone had said no.
The decision to move back to his S.H.E.I.L.D mandated apartment wasn’t one he meditated over. The first week after the…the moment in the lab he had stayed in his room, only emerging when he was sure no one else was around and Tony was safetly anywhere else but where he wanted to be. JARVIS was more than happy to let him know when Mr. Stark wasn’t around, Steve wondered if the machine knew what he had done.
It was a normal August morning, somewhat warm but Peter still felt the need to use the blanket Pepper had made for him. He wheeled himself into the kitchen slowly, it was early in the morning and he was sure no one else was up, the snores coming from Clint and Natasha’s room somewhat confirmed this.
When Steve wakes up a few hours later they’re still lying like that.
"Well that's annoying."
There had been loud music.
“Not dad and pop. Not like this.”
He couldn’t go online and order it himself because Tony would find out which would lead to teasing. Then he would have to let Tony in on his plan and Tony would stupidly let it slip to Steve because of that ridiculous crush he has on him. Steve would frown at Clint and give him a lecture about tricking teammates into awkward situations which would result in Clint having to cancel the order and Thor not carrying around a puppy purse because he was told it was ‘the next thing since pop tarts’ was just disappointing.
He ends up on his knees, bent over the toilet, heaving into the bowl.
“I didn’t ask her too…”
“Clint!” “He’s been using Coulson to get us things!” Natasha and Tony yelled at the same time. Steve, who was a bright red and avoiding Tony’s eyes looked up at Clint and raised an eyebrow. Thor looked at them over his pop tarts and Bruce just shook his head.
“No.” he answered too quickly.
Two weeks later when he found himself staring at Steve in the gym like he was a shiny new toy wrapped up with a bow he knew she was right.
“Send the  bugs my way team, rigging this thing to blow.” He flew around the building, loading it with explosives.
“But can we see him?” he says more forcefully, with a sigh the doctor clears his throat and nods.
“He knows he’s asking Coulson…he just doesn’t know that he’s like…”
Tony hated hospitals, he always had and she was sure that he always would. This was just going to amplify his hate.  Tony had ran straight past the large group of heroes standing in the waiting room looking not too super at all.
“Language.” Steve scalds, earning him a snort, two laughs, and a raised eyebrow from Nat.
“Nothing?”
“Ah…hey” he manages, Tony flicks him the smallest of smiles.
For a moment he thinks that his pops moved him but then he opens his eyes and sees his dad laying on his right, his pop on his left and himself in the middle. He wonders how his dad managed to get both of them to bed without waking anyone.
“Of course.”
Tony found him sitting at the bench that morning, the tower still with sleeping heroes. Steve was an early riser and Tony kept odd hours, enjoying the moments he found Steve alone.
“Of course I love you. I love you so much and I am always going to love you because you’re my son, and that won’t change.”
“What?” Pepper reached out, took both of his hands in hers and held them tight.
"Relax Tony, I'm fine." nonetheless he turned off the ledge and walked forward. Tony visibly relaxes.
“Number 380. Not all of you can go in there at once.” He starts but Natasha throws him one of her glares and he wisely shuts up, stepping aside so that Steve can help Tony slowly walk towards the room.
“No one picked me to…to be on their team in s-sport because I’m t-t-t-oo small!” Peter wailed, more tears falling from his eyes. Thor sighed, frowned and then held Peter a little tighter.
“I guess Coulson feels like being a good guy.” Tony snorted.
“Mr Stark, Mr Rogers.” the man greets with a nod for the fourth time that night.
“Uncle Thor…do you think I’ll be small forever.” Thor laughed, it boomed throughout the house.
“Well…not exactly…”
“Fifteen kilos.” Steve let out a low whistle.
“Tony!” Pepper had called as he kept running, skidding to a halt and barely missing an old lady and her walker. He turned on his heel and ran back.
“Peter you have returned! Father Stark is building legs.” Thor declares and Peter rolls his eyes because sometimes his uncle Thor can just not know what he’s talking about.
“Only some?” he prods, Steve meets his gaze again.
The space between them was thick with tension.
“Sure.”
- Fifteen kilograms of Plutonium
“Tash and Clint weren’t sure if they should come home.”
“Pepper? Where…Peter…Steve…Pepper…I…Um…Hospital…Peter…You said…”
“Tony, that day in the lab when you kissed me. I’ve never wanted to be kissed by anyone more than I did in that moment.” Steve notices the tension in Tony’s body evaporate, he leans further in, Steve can feel Tony’s head on every inch of his body, his dick hardens in his pants. “You said you wished it had never happened and I respect that, I get it I reacted…well badly is an understatement but badly. I understand if you don’t want whatever this is, but I’ve had time to think. A lot of time actually, it’s been pretty miserable, but I know that if now, in this time I can love someone, anyone, you’re the only person I’d want to give that love to.” Steve reaches out again, lets his hand brush over Tony’s cheek, trail down his jaw, he hooks it under this chin and tips it towards him.
“Were you worried about me cap?” he teased, taking another step forward. Steve doesn’t make to move towards him, he doesn’t make to leave either.
“You know.” He states, deflated, shoulders sinking.
“Aye aye Cap’n”
He saw Tony on his eighth day of solitude. He was leaving the gym when he bumped into him in the hall way. He darted his arms out in reflex, one grabbing Tony’s wrist and the other on his hip.
“Puppy eyes?”
it tells him.
"I'm sure everything will work out." he told him. Clint shrugged and stood up.
“I don’t understand what that means…” Steve says, his eyebrows still furrowed as Tony leans into him. Everyone in the room looks at him sadly, seeming to understand the strange medical talk.
“I know, I know.” he said and then Peter grinned widely as he wrapped his own arms around Tony’s waist, legs shaking.
“They don’t want to see me.”
“Some hospital benefactor night, she took me as her date which was embarrassing at the time, I think she just wanted a chance for me to eat some real food, hoped all the cakes would fatten me up. I had to borrow one of Bucky’s suits and it didn’t fit me at all, I was swimming in it and I had to stuff his shoes with newspapers so they’d fit me properly. It was awful and I couldn’t believe my ma was dragging me to this thing full of boring adults, I had never wished harder for an asthma attack in my life.” Steve smiled with a small shake of his head, “So I’m ready to start wheezing and ma walks into the living room all glammed out. She had this old dress that she had altered and was wearing pearls – not real ones but still. So I thought ‘Roger’s you have to suck this up because your ma deserves a dance’ and I did, suck it up I mean, we tried dancing but it was horrible and I kept tripping over Bucky’s shoes but ma just laughed. “ Steve fell silent, rubbed the back of his neck as he stared off in the distance.
And there was only one way to get Tony the Plutonium. Turns out Clint didn’t even need to be the one pouting.
"Hey Clint, is every one else out? I just abou- are you ok?" Steve asked, walking into the living room with genuine worry on his face. Clint worked on keeping his face empty and sad and tried really hard not to laugh as Steve sat next to him.
“Do you question the knowledge of Thor son of Odin?” Peter shook his head incredibly fast and then smiled.
“A water would be lovely Steve, thank you.” He’s pretty sure people don’t use their manners when they’re about to kill you, but Pepper was an exception to most rules he supposed.
On Monday morning Fury arrived back form his mission. He was tired, annoyed and had a large cut on his thigh from when a sea urchin had been fired at him from a gun. These new villains were really just becoming a pain in the neck to deal with. Sighing, he sat at his desk and looked at the paperwork that had piled up from when he had been away.
“It is always you.” Bruce chimed and Clint glared.
“H’llo gorg’s” Steve’s worry slowly starts to ease off his face.
“Hulk no like tricking Philson.” He snarled and Clint swallowed.
“Of course not.” He supplies, gesturing weekly to the spaces next to them. Tony slides in next to him and at first, he’s thankful that he doesn’t have to look straight at him every time he lifts his head from the table.  Tony sits a safe distance away, enough room that not a single part of him is touching Steve.
“In Asgard being small is not a bad thing. For even my brother Loki is small but one of the most powerful.”
The next few weeks passed by in a painful blur.
“Suit up.” Steve tells him, straightening up, no longer Steve but in full Captain America mode. He walks past Tony, heading for the door. “I…I want to finish this.” Steve says from the door, letting his guard down long enough to give Tony a soft smile.
It’s well into the afternoon when Peter wakes up. No one - not even Thor- had slept. Blinking and squinting and letting out a loud groan Steve had rolled off of the bed in shock and then scrambled to stand up, watching as Peter awoke to the world around him.
“Iron Man are you there? What’s your location?”
“I’m starved, I’ve been dreaming about the food here since you asked me.” She winks before scanning the menu.
“Well how much does he need?”
It turned out the only thing that could make Tony Stark smile in the morning was either Steve shirtless or an official letter from S.H.I.E.L.D that was addressed to anyone but him.
“I’m just going to go now…” Tony muttered, sneaking past the Hulk how was still glaring at Clint. He let out a large huff that nearly knocked Clint off of his feet.
“Tony shut up. Clint. Tell me what Tony means?”
Steve’s eyes would dance with light when he read the comics in the paper and sparkle with triumph whenever he understood a reference past his time. In the mornings Steve would sip on his coffee with the rest of his team and speak with a husky voice, still thick with sleep, hair tousled and soft.
“We both know I’m not here to talk about the weather Steve.” Pepper watches him as he places the glass in front of her and slowly takes the seat across from her
Steve shows up at her door at 7pm sharp with flowers she takes gleefully, giving him a small peck on the cheek with lips that are too soft. They walk to the restaurant with her hand on his arm, her perfume is sickly sweet and Steve is grateful for the fresh air that washes it away before it can linger too long in his nostrils.
“Honestly the guy disappears for six weeks and then comes back and tries to change the rules.” Clint throws in, Steve hears an arrow whistle past his ear.
his mind threatened and he deepened his frown just a little bit more.
“That new?”
“Just fess up Barton.” Tony muttered. Clint wondered why he wouldn’t just tell them what he knew. Then again, Tony Stark liked to make everything difficult- even his torrid obsession with Steve.
“I need to finish this.”
“He’ll be alright.” Clint whispers, it echoes around the room and no one really replies because they’re not sure how. Instead they stay there taking turns at stroking Peter’s head, talking to him gently, tucking the covers tighter. Tony, Bruce and Jane inspect the different gadgets his plugged into, making sure that they’re working properly. Pepper starts knitting a blanket, claiming that ‘he can’t be comfortable with that plastic crap. Steve lies on one side of the bed, with an arm that doesn’t have hundreds of needles stuck into it, and gently strokes Peter’s hair as he rests. Tony is certain that the bed is going to break but it doesn’t, and no one has the heart to comment on how Steve is pressed against the bed bars, and his feet are way of the end and that he can’t possibly be comfortable. Natasha just sits in a chair on the other side of Peter, singing the words to a Russian lullaby that seems to soothe everyone.
“Yup. We’ll be husbands and have a family like you and pa.” his ma took his hands in hers, squeezing them tight enough that his scrapes started to burn.
“You still owe me a conversation.” She tells Steve before dragging Clint away “we told you not to go in the kitchen.”
“Peter is sedated at the moment during the operation w-”
“Okay” Tony breathes, so Steve leans in and kisses him. It’s soft, just a brush of his lips that fills his body with a warmth that had been missing from his life the last month and a half. Tony shifts and then his hand is coming up between them, fisting in Steve’s shirt, pulling him close. Steve feels Tony’s tongue dart out and opens his mouth, breathing him in, one hand still on Tony’s face, the other arm snakes around his waist. Steve’s not sure if there’s so much as a breath between them, but he still tries to pull Tony closer. It’s not enough, especially not when he shifts his hip and feels Tony’s cock pressing against his hip. He gives a slow push against him and smiles when Tony’s lips break the kiss to let out a gasp.
“Yeah?”
But Tony Stark was someone who was just plain bitchy when he couldn’t finish a project. And that said project needed 15 kilos of plutonium that Coulson was not going to let him have. So really the only way to stop him from sulking around was to either:
He doesn’t blame either for what he does next.
”Yeah.”
“Peter needs you, I know he does.”
“Do you still feel like that?”
“Does my near-death experience not mean anything to you?” He tries for flirty, not sure if it translates because Tony just smirks at him.
He had fascinations, obsessions, something similar to a child with a new toy. They played with it, fell asleep with it, kept it tucked safely in their back pack. Then one day another toy, a toy that’s shiny and new, comes along and their attention shifts, their obsession starts all over and the old toy is forgotten, locked away in a chest with all the rest.
Steve laughed, "Well, then Peter can take it to his date tonight."
Steve shut Tony up with a kiss and pulled him into their room.
No sooner had he done so than two white ropes shot from his wrists and stuck to the ceiling. Peter stared up in shock. Kat gaped. Tony, Steve, and Bruce’s eyes went wide.
Steve was silent for a few moments. He didn't know if he should tell him the truth, or if he should give him an excuse. He wanted to. He wanted to give him an excuse, something that wouldn't make him worry. But Tony could tell. He could always tell when Steve was lying.
“Why are we failing Williams and Green?” Harley asked, drawing everyone’s attention as he and Peter walked into the lab.
“Still feel the need to protect me?” Kat taunted.
Tony's smile widened just a little and he nodded, opening the door. He looked back at Steve, "Take care of yourself, Cap."
“I think you may have to adopt us,” Kat said, straight-faced. “Peter and Tony would never forgive you if you didn’t want to.”
End of Chapter Nine
Peter and Kat finished what they remembered of the song and then looked to Tony and Steve. Steve was still getting over his giggles and Tony was smiling, trying not to laugh at his husband and new children. Peter smiled and Kat started laughing. It was humorous to see that their new parents enjoyed their little attempt at a joke. And they were proud of themselves for being able to pick up the tune so quickly on their instruments.
Peter shrugged, "She was stressed the past few weeks for finals. It's been hard and I guess she was letting it out. I didn't mean for this to happen."
“Superheroes. Do you remember what length Wanda’s hair was the last time we saw her and Pietro?”
His team had found a HYDRA cell in their area, a few miles outside Wakanda's border. Steve was leading everyone in with help from T'Challa. They'd been up most of the night working on a plan. Hopefully, this would be over by lunchtime. He was slinking with Clint down the hallway. They were making their way toward the control room, where they could hopefully shut down the base. They found the door and Clint cracked the lock open. They snuck inside and started going through the computers. It was all going perfectly according to plan.
Kat squealed at the sudden lift and laughed at Steve’s exclamation. When he set her back down, she stood on her toes and gave her father a kiss on the cheek.
“She thinks so,” Peter confirmed, shrugging. “I’m inclined to believe her. She’s smart about this stuff.” After a moment of Tony giving him a
Today was the first day, and Kat was very nervous and excited. It would be her first time in a school building. When her alarm clock went off, she nearly fell off the bed in her surprise. And being tangled in her sheets didn’t help. She had showered the night before so she had a bit of extra time to get ready. She pulled out her favorite, long t-shirt, one with a “Lord of the Rings” movie poster on it, and a pair of skinny jeans. She pulled her black flats from her closet and slipped them on her feet before going down the stairs and into the kitchen. Summer had been nice, spending time with each of the Avengers and doing all sorts of things around town to occupy herself, but she was ready to try school.
Tony was the first to come out of his stupor, “Well, ah, that was interesting.”
“Nuh-uh!”
“Watch yourself.”
"Kat there's no need to raise your voice," Steve reminded.
He raised his voice, so everyone could hear. "I love you, Tony."
“I’m sorry, baby doll. I didn’t mean to snap.”
Peter chuckled, “I hope so. Wade always said that the friends he made at the hospital hated school. I thought science and math classes sounded fun. Kat always liked the idea of a writing class.”
The look on Tony’s face as his eyes flicked between Steve’s boombox and his camera was interesting. He looked like he might be taking them apart with his eyes. In all honestly, it was kind of hot. But Steve just kept stretching, trying to keep his mind in the right place while he got ready to film.
Kat laughed.
Steve finished his stretches and got into his correct position, checking his board one more time before asking Tony to start the camera. As he worked through the sets, he kept his focus on the camera, trying not to blush too hard at the thought of Tony watching him. Between his sets, he asked Tony to hand him a water bottle. Tony didn’t say much at that point, but he did nod at Steve appreciatingly. Steve stood to change the board for the second sets, and noticed how Tony shifted, almost hiding himself behind the desk and camera.
“Mr. and Mr. Stark-Rogers, these are our resident pair of twins, Peter and Kat Parker. I think they know who you are. I’ll let you alone to talk for a bit.” Ms. Cordova walked back into the building.
version of the engineer that was undressing Steve with his eyes and making his skin burn. Steve whimpered softly and Tony was quick to drop his belt. He kicked off his shoes and pushed off his slacks, gloriously naked, except for his briefs. Steve wanted to ask him to take them off, but the words died on his tongue as Tony’s fingers skirted the hem of his tights. His breath hitched again, and Steve’s eyes screwed shut in anticipation.
Tony stroked one of the ropes, “Jesus, you’re right! Pete, can you let them go?”
“Are you kidding? I could never play guitar as well as he does,” Kat told Tony and Steve.
When Peter and Kat had finished saying their goodbyes and shedding tears, they climbed into the vehicles with their new parents and watched as the orphanage disappeared behind them. Peter was riding with Steve and Kat was riding with Tony.
Tony changed the topic, “You excited for summer break?”
Kat finished her rant and snatched her book back from Tony. But her hands were shaking so much that she dropped it and it landed on her foot. She yelped and bent down to pick it up. But she collapsed onto her knees and held her face in her hands, sobbing from stress and anger. Tony and Steve were shocked frozen for a few moments. Steve was the first to snap out of it, sitting next to Kat and pulling her onto his lap. She fought against him, weakly before letting him hold her as she sobbed into his shoulder.
He reached over to take Steve's uninjured hand in his own. Steve wished he could've flinched away, but touching Tony again after a year was... too good to fake hating it. He swallowed hard, staring at their hands.
“Go change back? Sure. Jesus, what the hell are those?” He couldn’t stop it. Tony felt all his defenses going up. Damn the kids, he was going to fail all of them, honest to God, for cornering him like this. “Rogers those look like they walked straight out of the 80s. Did you make them? You can’t have bought them.” He hurried to grab his thermos as he babbled, backing towards the door, away from Steve, once he had it. His face was burning. “Did you steal a carpet from a roller rink? Or was it seat covers off a bus? Honestly, what do you have to say for yourself? Those are just… the ugliest tights I’ve ever seen.” And the most fabulous tights he’d ever seen, especially on Steve. But how could he say that?
Tony nodded, “I can fix that. Come down to the lab and take the suit off.”
On the contrary, crop-tops were Tony’s favorite thing to see Steve in. He just didn’t think he could ever handle seeing it at school. “Never seen him in one in the break room. Sorry.”
“And Kat,” Steve began, “you’ll like their music and art programs. You learn quite a bit more in the art classes and it’s great to play in an orchestra. You do learn a lot more if you’re with a group of musicians.”
Steve blushed, “I was not going to pull off a lady’s pants!”
“Black,” he blurted, after a moment of silence. Steve blinked, obviously unsure what Tony meant. Tony cleared his throat, “That’s how I like my coffee. Sometimes with sweetener, but only with breakfast.”
Steve put a hand on Peter’s shoulder, “What else can you do besides jump six feet in the air, Peter?”
Steve smiled, “Yeah, how about a demonstration when we get back to the Tower?”
Kat couldn’t up at their faces as she explained, “He was saying that you didn’t want me.”
“What?”
His whole body was sore. His legs and left arm, especially. Steve groaned a little when he tried to open his eyes. Why did hospital lights always have to be so damn bright? Someone shuffled beside him and he turned his head to look. He blinked a few times, not really trusting his eyes.
“It is the first Monday in June, Miss Kat. The school year is over.”
Tony wouldn’t give them the satisfaction of looking during class hours. It didn’t matter that Steve shouldn’t be in the building today, because Tony knew he didn’t have Thursday classes this late. Something hinky was going on. He wasn’t going to fall for it.
Steve and Tony looked up as they were joined by Peter and Clint.
“But you don’t have a mother, do you?” Kat froze again, making Loki smile wider. “You never had a mother. She abandoned you and your brother to die on the streets. You were lucky, having been taken in. No one wanted you.” Kat’s blood started to boil. “Does anyone, really? Why did they adopt you, hm? Why let you join their team? Because they felt sorry for you?” Kat felt tears beginning in her eyes. “You have no powers. Nothing that makes you special. Even Stark is perhaps the most intelligent man on the planet. You? What do you have? A suit your ‘Daddy’ built for you? And look. It’s already breaking apart. Daddy must not have been too concerned with your safety. Or perhaps- “
Steve laughed softly and finished his glass of water, “Every time I hear about Dr. Richards, I simultaneously feel bad for him, and like he might deserve it.”
Steve was also in the kitchen, cooking something on the stove. Out of habit, Kat went to the cabinet to retrieve a cereal box.
Ahem.
“Sure.”
you like him. And I
"Steve. Steve, come in."
Tony reached up and brushed away Steve's tears, cupping is cheek. They sat for a while, just like that. When Tony could feel that Steve had stopped shaking, he pressed another small kiss to his lips, like he used to, and then pulled back, noting the look in Steve's eyes. It made him not want to stand, to leave. But he knew he needed to.
“Steve, Pop, you don’t need to. Besides, I still have to finish packing by bag. This is faster.”
Tony raised an eyebrow in a way that made Steve’s face warm, but he handed over his glass, “Sure. Thank you.” He leaned over on the table as Steve stood at the sink. “So, I thought you were just filming a section. How long are we going to be in there?”
“No! No, I’d never… I’d never
Was an Iron Woman suit.
"Nothing!"
1, 2, 3, shoot. Tony rock, Steve paper.
“Don’t stop stretching those legs!” Steve would say, grinning and winking at the camera, capping off each episode with his foot stretched up over his head, showing off his impressive calf and thigh and…
. Why did Steve have it on at school, anyways? There was no way he filmed his content here. That would be insane. There’s no way that would be approved. “You didn’t give a
But Tony didn't slip any handcuffs on him. He leaned in. He reached over and held Steve's one hand between both of his. He rubbed his thumb gently over the back of Steve's hand. Steve couldn't help that he leaned over a bit to meet him, his eyes closing a little. It had been so long since he'd been this close to Tony. And even longer since they'd had a moment this... intimate. He thought he might cry.
“I hate to break up this wonderful moment, but we should get to the hospital. I’m sure you’ll all want to know how she is.”
Leaving work unnoticed was pretty easy, even wearing the large bright red and gold jacket Rhodey had given him for Christmas last winter. Tony slipped out of his office at the end of his day, his classes finished, and his office hours concluding at three o’ clock. He locked his door at exactly that time and speed walked out to the garage, only breathing easy once he was safely inside his car. He drove home to his family’s old mansion. The one good thing about living alone in such a big place, he supposed, was the privacy it afforded.
