“Ok, yeah, I totally understand. I could get dizzy on the stairs and the extra effort on my body to try to balance and keep the forward momentum up the stairs is not good for my injured brain right now, I get it, man.” Dean replied in a cool, even voice. He had been working with his therapist, Pam, on accepting help from others and recognizing that he wasn’t less of a man for asking for help, or that he was unworthy of the help that was offered him. Besides, it was totally worth the look of utter shock and admiration that spread across Castiel’s face when he realized what Dean had said and that he wasn’t going to have to fight with the man for his own good
“Of course I do, Dean” - Cas closed his eyes and tightened his grip in Dean’s hair - “I love you too. Thank you for moving here with me. It means the world to me.”
Dean’s foot hit the pavement from the nearby T stop, a gentle breath of fresh air blew across his face. The initial harsh warmth of the day had given way to the crisp autumn evening air. He inhaled deeply, rolled his shoulders back, and began the short walk home. The relaxation and rejuvenation he usually felt after a long day of work did not come today. Instead of pleasant thoughts of Cas waiting for him at home, Dean was preoccupied by a troubling incident at work. The vibrant oranges and reds of the turning leaves went unnoticed as Dean was lost in thought. He chewed the nail on his thumb and his stomach churned.
Dean shook his head and crutched his way into his kitchen, thoughts swirling around in his head. He knew that he would drive himself crazy if he sat around dwelling in this all night. Rather than wallow, he decided to try distracting himself with chores. He leaned the crutches up against the wall and leaned down to grab some food from the fridge. His plan was to make a chicken pot pie and meal prep for the week. Some good, hearty comfort food would be perfect.
“Gotcha, be right back,” Dean replied, snapping his fingers in a finger-gun motion and winking at Cas as he slid out of the booth.
“Dean, what are you doing with my shoe?” Cas asked, head still tilted to the side.
Of course, Dean. I have a couple of free nights this week if that was what you had in mind? Or would you prefer to meet for coffee again?
Dean used this temporary distraction and slowly started to step towards the man, raising his hands slightly to try to grab the knife from his hands.
“I mean, it was a trip to the emergency room so it went about as well I  guess it could have gone. I went in, got patched up, and came back home.” Dean said, meeting Charlie’s curious gaze and sighing deeply, “ but storytime is not why I called you over, I’ve been dying to watch sci-fi movies but if it isn’t something from the discovery channel, Sam has no interest.”  Dean shifted to face the TV and  picked  up the remote.
Dean took a deep breath, his eyebrows furrowed and his fists clenched at his sides. He turned and grabbed a water bottle out of a cooler sitting on the floor near them.
wow two chapters in a week?? Thanks for the kudos and comments!
“Sure Jo, why the hell not” - Dean took the phone from Jo -” Heya Sammy, so don’t worry or anything, but I kinda, sorta went to the ER today for stitches, a broken bone, and a concussion…” Dean trailed off at the end, looking down at his lap.
“Castiel, what the FUCK?” he screamed to an empty car. He pulled back from the steering wheel until he was upright in the seat, his head and back pressed against the seat. He smacked the steering wheel, screaming with each hit.
“A chai?” Castiel asked, raising an eyebrow, “since when do you drink anything besides black coffee with an obscene number of espresso shots?”
He snatched a dirty t-shirt off the floor and used that to wipe himself clean then stumbled out of bed. He didn’t bother with his crutches, opting rather to hobble to the bathroom on his one good leg. He started the water and sat down on the toilet lid as he desperately attempted to sort his thoughts and process what he did.
“Did you not want to go on a date with me?” Dean asked in a small voice, so quiet that Cas wondered if he’d actually heard it.
Dean stuck his tongue out at Castiel and the two of them sat in silence, their eyebrows raised at each other, a small grin on their faces as they waited for the other to crack first. Finally laughter erupted from Dean, spilling from his mouth, the kind of laughter that comes from the depths of your stomach, the kind of laughter that leaves your sides aching. The infectious kind of laughter that pulled Castiel in.The kind of laugher that Castiel had been waiting for years to hear again. As soon as the melodic sound filled Castiel’s ears, he felt the pin prick of tears against the backs of his eyes and he fought them back. He reveled in the sound of Dean’s laughter and at how utterly at home he felt knowing that he  was the reason for his laughter.
Maybe he would tell Dean, just confess and get it all out in the open. Maybe that way they could work through this together and find a way to keep Dean safe.
“Heya, Cas'' Dean's voice broke through the cloud of thoughts raging through Castiel’s mind. He looked up at the voice and was stunned. Dean looked radiant against the sunlit backdrop of the windows behind him. The light reflected the gold coloring in his eyes and pulled attention to the freckles splashed across his cheeks. Cas thought about the old saying, that freckles were angel kisses, and he was unsurprised that Dean had garnered the attention of angels. Dean sat down across from Cas and the smell of wood and leather rolled off of him, filling the air around them.
Dean crawled on the mattress until he was over Cas, eye to eye, his hands on either side of Cas’s face with Cas’s fingers back in his hair. He bent down and gently kissed Cas, his best friend, his lover, his partner.
“That’s not fair, that’s not what I said and you know it,” Cas responded quickly as though he had anticipated Dean misinterpreting his words.
Wow guys I can't believe it took me so long to get this chapter out. Between the end of the semester and starting two jobs, I've been facing some massive writer's block and a lack of motivation. I'm really glad that I could get this out of y'all now and thank you so much for sticking it out with me!!
Hey, I just wanted to check in and see if you were free/still wanted to meet up sometime next week?
As soon as the words left his mouth, Castiel wished he could pull them back. His eyes widened in fear that he had come across too strong, that this guy didn’t want anything more than someone to email him a missing lecture.
“I cannot live with myself if something else were to happen to that kid because I made the wrong call here.” Dean said, his voice cracking.
“How have you been, Dean?” Castiel asked, breaking the silence. He picked up his  mug, raising an eyebrow at Dean as he took a sip.
He dropped the phone onto the table in front of him and fell back onto the couch. Dumbfounded, Cas sat in silence. As he was able to piece together everything Benny told him, his anxiety bubbled into anger. Something was wrong. Dean didn’t trust him enough to have a simple conversation about his past but he trusted Benny enough to tell him that he saw his own mother die? What. The. Fuck.
“You got a job in Boston?” Cas asked, barely aware of the words as they left his mouth.
“Uh, uh, yeah, yeah, I’m good,” Cas said quickly, looking up at  Dean as he sat down and waved his hand dismissively the air in front of him, as though that would clear up the situation.
“I dunno man, it’s not fighting disease, for one thing,” Dean said dismissively. “No one’s ever really cared much about what I want to do. My old man for sure thought that I would follow in his footsteps and just be a mechanic like him. But what if I wanted something that was mine? What if I didn’t just want to be someone who just does whatever his dad tells him to do?” -Dean was speaking faster, his words coming out in a harsh pant as the color rose in his cheeks and Cas could see the watery appearance his eyes were developing- “I always looked up to my dad and listened to him, but recently I’ve found out that he never gave a shit about me, that he wasn’t someone who’s footsteps I should follow, that just because he didn’t care about me, doesn’t mean that I can’t care about me.”
“Hey Charles! Everything’s good,” Dean replied, hoping that his voice sounded steadier than  he felt. “I was wondering if you  wanted to come over and marathon old sci-fi movies  with me?”
“WHAT??!! Wai- wha- hang on-'' Charlie unfolded herself from the couch and jumped up. Pacing around the living room, she continued “Castiel was your doctor? The dark haired greek god that walked out 2 years ago, Castiel?”
Gabe sat silently for a minute, watching Castiel and Tucker, trying to figure out what to say next. The words sat on the tip of his tongue but he refused to give them air.
Dean looked down to find Uhura from Star Trek wrapped around him.
Sam looked over his shoulder and saw Castiel clinging to the bench like a drowning man to a life raft. Quietly, he turned back and took a seat. He ran a hand through his hair and scratched at the back of his neck.
“Castiel listen,” Dean said, getting Castiel’s attention as he exited the booth, “I had a great time, I’m glad you suggested this. Let’s do something next week or something, ok?”
“Ok,” -Cas closed his eyes and took a deep breath, before opening them again and continuing- “I’ve been thinking about this a lot and please hear me out before you cut me off. But I think you should consider visiting your mother’s grave for Mother’s day with me this year.-”
“Dean-” Castiel took a deep breath, “I want to apologize, I think we got off on the wrong foot today. There’s a lot unsaid between us and I don’t want us to part again on bad, or any sort of unpleasant terms. Please, let me just say that I want to be on good terms with you again. I want to know who you are, again.” Castiel could see Dean’s eyes widening.
By the time Cas found Dean, he was blitzed.
Dean lifted his head and met Cas’s eyes. He opened his mouth to respond to Cas and found that no words came out. He shook his head, swallowed hard and tried again.
“I’m not sure I want to talk about it,” -Dean placed a hand on Cas’s cheek and Cas leaned into the touch- “Honeybee, you just seem so stressed, I really don’t want to pile on, besides, I should be able to handle it, I just need to think it through.”
“Why do you think she might say no?” Dean finally asked.
“Well,” -  Cas slapped his hands down on his thighs for effect - “I picked up the dirty laundry, folded the clean laundry in the basket, took all the trash and recycling out, cooked and meal prepped next week’s lunches for you, then cleaned all the dishes and the kitchen.” Cas whipped his head around to look at Dean, a small smirk on his face.
“I understand. Would it be possible that we could have a few minutes to talk privately?” Castiel asked, clenching his jaw.
Castiel was working in the emergency room on his trauma rotation when the call came in that there was a man coming in from some street side altercation. The man is in his mid-20’s with a slash wound to his abdomen and side, a broken bone in his leg, and a possible concussion.
Dean closed his eyes, feeling exhausted and lighter at the same time. His stomach churned in anticipation of Charlie’s response, but at least he could think more clearly now after getting that off his chest. A soft hand rested on his shoulder brought him back to the moment; Dean opened his eyes to look at Charlie and blinked away the tears yet to spill. He looked at her with glassy, watery eyes, trying to get a feel for what she was to say. She moved her hand from his shoulder to his cheek and he leaned into her touch.
How about The Bunker? It’s new and supposed to be pretty low-key and good. I can meet you there around 7?
“I got a job,” Dean said with a shaky breath, “I’ve been sending out tons of applications and basically pleading with schools to interview me over the phone. I finished my teaching portfolio from student teaching early and I’ve sent it out with my applications. And Cas? Baby?” -Dean closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and opened them again- “I got a job, in Boston.”
Cas fell asleep next to Dean hoping that he meant what he said, that he would follow him anywhere and through anything.
“Sam, of course I do,” Cas said, his voice firm and even, as though he was stating an obvious fact like the sky being blue, “I have been in love with your brother since the day we met 9 years ago.”
Dean’s heart dropped as Cas wrapped him up, guilt flooded his mind. This man was too good for him, here was a shining star that had his own stress and difficulties to deal with and was still willing to take on whatever crap Dean has. Ashamed that he couldn’t handle his own problems, Dean buried his face in Cas’s shoulder and gripped the man tightly in his own arms.
“I’m doing fine Sammy, peachy even,” Dean replied, averting his gaze away from Sam’s face.
“Damn it,” Castiel muttered as his house keys fell out of his hand and into a puddle.
Cas’s mind was reeling. There he stood in their master bathroom, staring at his husband of 5 years in the costume of Cain, his archnemesis. The same supervillain that had just kicked his ass up and down Market Street and the Financial District earlier that night. How could he not have known? How had Dean been able to keep this secret from him? How long had this been going on? Once Castiel stopped to think about it, he had been fighting Cain ever since he was strong enough to fight on his own, after Balthazar, his mentor and trainer, had retired. God that was nearly 10 years ago. Well, if Cas had been able to keep his double life a secret, he shouldn’t be surprised that Dean had been able to do the same thing.
Cas sat in stunned silence, he watched as Dean caught his breath and saw the realization of what he had just shared wash over him. He watched Dean turn his head away from him and wipe the forming tears from his eyes. When Dean turned back to face Cas, his eyes were red-rimmed but dry. Cas took a couple of deep breaths and remained silent, his head tilted to the side as he waited for Dean to continue talking.
“Alright I don’t have time to unpack that right now, come here,” Cas roughly grabbed the shoulder of Sam’s jacket and pulled the larger man down the hall.
“Well, uh, you never asked me to go with you. But I assumed it’s because you didn’t want to be saddled with an out of work education major, so I decided to come to you when I had a job and I was worth something and I could hold my own financially.”
Dean sat in Castiel’s car in silence, the two of them cruising through the small streets of Boston with only the soft music coming out of the radio to interrupt the otherwise deafening quiet inside the car. His seat was pushed all the way back so he could stretch out his injured leg. He lounged in the passenger seat, one arm propped on the edge of the windowsill. After a few minutes of gazing absent-mindedly out of the window, Dean allowed his eyes to wander around the inside of the car.
“She and I got close when you started your law classes. I was still putting myself back together and she would come over on her days off and have lunch with me.” - Dean’s voice caught and he swallowed hard, pushing himself to continue- “Things were still hard for me for a while and she just wanted to make sure I was doing ok. I was so worried for so long that you felt obligated to be here with me and that I was holding you back, that you would resent me and hate me like you do Dad. But Jess was here to remind me that you actually, really fucking care. That you have a big heart and that family means the world to you.
He shook his head, quieting this train of thought. In a desperate attempt to redirect his thoughts, he grabbed his backpack and retrieved the folder with yesterday’s biology notes. He placed them on the table in front of him along with a small pad of post-it notes. He shuffled the notes around, double-checking that he had printed all of the pages, unable to silence that nagging feeling that there was something more than he was willing to admit.  He read the first page of notes, and reread them, and reread them, trying to pull his mind away from the pit sitting in his stomach, away from his true intentions of this coffee date.
Dean’s thoughts carried him the entire walk home. He was still struggling by the time he was outside his apartment door, his keys in his hand. He slowly raised his hand up and as he slid the key into the lock, Dean’s heart clenched and his mouth went dry as sandpaper. He turned the key and stepped through the door.
Gabe sat in silence, his eyes locked on his brother, searching for any indication that he was joking, or lying, or mistaken, or just plain messing with him. ~wow if this is a joke, then that is what I would get for replacing his shampoo with Nair back in high school, Gabe thought.~
Dean laid his head back on Charlie's shoulder and felt her questioning gaze boring a hole into his scalp.
“Well I’m glad that I was able to help you locate him. He’s been here for a few hours now, since about 12:30 when he came in all hot about some fight y’all done had, went straight to my fridge and downed quite a few drinks pretty damn quickly too,” Benny said very matter of factly, as though this was not the first time this had happened, and it very easily wasn’t the first time.
“What do you mean?”
“Yeah! Wait, it's the angel of… Tuesday?” -Dean bit his bottom lip and Castiel could practically see the wheels turning in his mind- “Shoot! Thursday! The angel of Thursday, which is fitting since today is a Thursday.” Dean said, winking at Castiel.
“I guess,” -Castiel looked up at the ceiling and took a deep breath- “that I’m just feeling guilty about leaving.”
I'm excited to be getting back to work on this piece! thank you for all your comments and kudos!
“Heya Gabe, are you busy? If you’re not, could you come over for a bit?” Castiel said, fighting to keep the tension out of his voice. He closed his eyes and gripped the phone tighter in his hands. He was determined not to break down until Gabriel got his ass over there.
“Thanks, man, you were always telling me that I should consider it. Now that I have, I see what all the fuss is about,” Dean said, a flash of something, almost apologetic, filled his eyes. Castiel got a glimpse before Dean dropped his gaze to the cup between his.
Cas turned his hand over on Dean’s thigh so his palm was facing up; Dean laid his own hand in Cas’s and intertwined their fingers together. The rest of their drive was spent in a comfortable silence with only the gentle crooning of whatever song was playing through the car radio.
“Cas?” Dean’s voice broke as he looked back at the other man. He had experienced nightmares like this one before, but it had been years and Cas had never seen one before.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Dean,” -Cas pulled his hands out of Dean’s and placed them both on Dean’s cheeks, cupping his face, tracing his jaw- “Baby I don’t have words for how proud of you I am, why didn’t you tell me that you were applying there?”
“Dean, I would move heaven and hell for you. We’re going to get through this.” Cas whispered as he crouched down to look Dean in the eyes.
“Ok Dean, I’ll be back later tonight but if you need anything just let me know!” Sam said, getting in the last word as Dean closed the front door behind him.
Now that they were stopped at a light, Cas was able to turn his head and take in a full image of Dean. He was wearing his black Led Zeppelin shirt (he had managed to steal it back from Cas this morning) and a pair of his best faded jeans. They were the best because they clung to his ass the best but Cas wasn’t going to let on to that fact, it was just for him. Dean was looking out the window at the historic brownstones that lined the streets, his right arm propped up on the windowsill, he was chewing on his fingernails. Sitting here in Cas’s car, about to start their lives together in Cas’s favorite city, the two of them on the cusp of their careers, Cas couldn’t help but think that Dean Winchester was the most beautiful human he had ever met.
“Of course Dean, if you need me to explain something in my notes, just call me,” Cas said.
Dean hadn’t been expecting that last question. He whipped back around to face Cas and was shocked to see how defeated his lover looked. Cas sat on the corner of the bed, head down and cradled in his hands. Dean leaned back against the dresser and took a deep breath.
“No, Cas, I think you meant to tell me that I should butt the hell out of this and YOU know I can’t do that.”
“Dean Winchester, you are just confused because you haven’t seen him in a while, and now you’re seeing him again and everyone is asking you about him. You never got proper closure when you broke up,”- he forced himself to meet his eyes in the mirror-” you are confused.”
“What a fight today, huh? Also, that was an impressive last speech you gave, declaring your defeat and all.” Cas teased from the kitchen as he grabbed two beers from the fridge.
“Hi Dean, how was your date?” Sam asked, clicking the volume down on the tv but not pausing his show.
“Dude! What did I do? I’m just laying here bleeding  in the street and you’re hitting me??”
Castiel’s stomach dropped, creating a pit deep inside him. He wanted to ask who Pamela was but the words caught in his mouth. He knew that it had been too long since either of them said anything and they were falling into an uncomfortable silence, he needed to say something, needed to respond.
Dean choked on a cry, closing his eyes and dropping his chin down to his chest as he swallowed back tears. He looked back at Cas, the dark haired man gripping the folds of Dean’s jeans around his thighs, heartbreak evident in his stormy eyes.
“Yeah, thanks, I’ll be seeing you,” Cas quipped, hanging up before Benny could respond.
(See the end of the chapter for
“So, honey, huh?” Dean asked, sitting up straighter in his seat. Cas noted the shift in Dean’s posture and wondered if his moan had anything to do with it. Shaking off this thought, he responded.
When Dean took his next step, he was only a little surprised to find that Castiel had taken most of his weight off his feet. Dean taking steps up these stairs was only a formality because Castiel was essentially carrying him. He was thankful that Castiel left his feet on the floor, while he recognized that he would not have made it up to his apartment without Castiel’s help, he still felt a little ashamed that he was still relying on this man to carry more than his fair share of weight. He was glad that he could at least pretend to do something for himself.
“Heh, thanks anyway Charles, anything would do right now,” Dean replied, his voice cracking and rough.
“Yeah while I was getting patched up, Castiel asked where you were and when I told him that you and your girlfriend were visiting our folks back in Kansas, he asked me if it was Jessica Moore by any chance, because wouldn’t you know it? Castiel and Jess work together!” Dean said, pulling the phone closer in until Jo was no longer in sight of the camera.
“Ok Dean, perfect. Now, forget about calling that Uber, you were my last patient so as soon as we can get you a cast, I will be driving you home.” Castiel said, clapping his hands once and standing up.
Dean’s eyebrows raised until they were practically in his hair and he felt his jaw drop open slightly.
“Castiel, he and I got coffee?” -He slammed the refrigerator door shut- “Why? Who’d you think I said?” Dean replied carefully, holding his voice steady so as not to betray his anxiety at letting Cas’s nickname slip.
Please be safe in the snow, see you soon.
“Well, now we wait, I guess,” he said before tossing the phone back on the bed and standing to get dressed.
“Ugh, you do know me well.” Dean said, dropping his head back before taking a deep breath, and returning his attention to Charlie, “Dude things are weird, I feel lonely and none of my dates in the past 2 years have worked out. I don’t know how I feel about it, I don’t think I’m ever going to feel about someone the way that I felt about Castiel. I’m having trouble connecting with people with when I go out with them and I deserve that, I deserve to feel that connection again.”- Dean paused to catch his breath-
“Don’t apologize, or be embarrassed,” Cas smirked and tore off a corner of notebook paper. He scribbled his name and number down, “I tend to have that effect on guys, especially those I deem worthy of my time and phone number.”  He winked and held the slip of paper towards Dean.
Notes at the end of the chapter
No more than a few steps into his walk, Castiel felt the phone buzz in his lab coat pocket. He checked the notification on his Apple Watch to see if this text was important enough to fish his phone out and balance all these files. Huh, Dean was texting him. Castiel furrowed his brow, surprised that Dean was up this early in the morning.
Dean knew what happened next, he remembered his mother rubbing small circles in the back of his hand with her thumb, singing Hey Jude under her breath. Dean softly sang along with her even after her chest stopped rising and the circles stopped. Dean kept singing until the paramedics arrived and wrapped him in a soft blanket for the ride to the hospital. Dean remembers all of this but this isn’t what keeps him awake, this isn’t the event that he relives.
Butterflies fluttered in his stomach now and his mind  quickly bounced from thought to thought, not settling on one idea for very long. What would he wear? What were they going to talk about? They were meeting to catch up but he hadn’t thought about how much of his  past two years he wanted to share with Castiel.
“Dean, you know I hate it when you say hurtful things about yourself, you know I value everything you do around here,” Cas replied softly.
“So, what happened?” Cas asked, his face heavy with concern.
“Jess, Dean went to the ER today and this is the first I’m hearing of it.” - Sam whipped his head back from Jess and stared intensely at Dean through the camera- “Wait, Jo called me to tell me about who she found in your apartment, what does that have to do with you going to the hospital?”
“HELL YEAH LITTLE BRO! Did you expect anything else from me?” Gabe’s over-enthusiastic voice chirped on the other end of the line. “How the hell are you on this fine American holiday?”
“Ah, yes. Well, I'm done stitching you up but we still need to get a quick X-Ray of your leg and a scan of your head to check for a concussion. I can have my techs do that and I’ll meet up with you when you’re done so I can get you discharged.”
“How could you think that I didn’t want you to come with me?” Cas asked, horrified that he had ever given Dean that impression.
Castiel let the car door slam behind him. He slumped into the driver’s seat and slid forward until his forehead hit the steering wheel.
“Dean. I am going to propose to Jess but, “ - Sam lifted a hand to his mouth and chewed on this thumb nail- “what if she says no?”
“I love you, Dean, and I’d follow you anywhere,” Cas whispered.
trouble in paradise? the cracks are becoming more apparent in our boys' relationship, what happened to these two back in the day?
Dean finally looked over at Charlie and knew in his gut that he had made the right decision in asking her to come over. To be honest, he did need to talk about what the hell was going on with Castiel and this pit that was growing in his stomach about it.
“Oh, fuck yeah, you’re not stopping now on my account,” Dean said, pulling Cas back in by his tie.
I met you when you were with Cas, so my Dean foundation up here” - she pointed to her temple- “is you when Cas is in your life, you seem looser somehow, you carry yourself differently,” She responded, sitting back against the armrest.
“What the hell did you do?” he whispered to himself. He suddenly remembered where he was parked and quickly snapped his head to look up at Dean’s window. A soft prayer wishing that Dean hadn’t been looking out his window during Castiel’s temper tantrum rolled off his tongue.
“You’re right,” Sam said, sitting up straighter, dropping his hands into his lap, “I don’t know the full story, I got some of it from Dean, but I don’t know what you went through. I was there to pick up the pieces after, but I didn’t see how they fell apart. Can you tell me what happened?”
“Huh, I was wondering if you were going to remember that part.” - Castiel looked up at  Gabe - “I drove him home, that’s how I knew that his apartment looked the same.”
Castiel pulled himself together and entered Dean’s room to give him the results.
“Yeah, sure thing man, I’ll keep that in mind. Thanks for bringing me home and helping me with the stairs,” Dean replied, tilting his head up towards Castiel’s, meeting his gaze.
“Heya Babe! What’s going on?” Charlie’s upbeat, cheery voice rang out. She pushed the hair out of her face revealing a wide smile that was spread across her face, created by the unexpected visit of her best friend.
“Ahh I dunno Sammy, I can’t put a finger on it,” Dean said curtly, hoping that Sam couldn’t see the lie pouring out of his mouth. That he wasn’t as obvious as he so desperately was. That he knew exactly why this date and all the dates that came before it were nonstarters and he hoped that Sammy hadn’t guessed it.
“Wait, if Sam is out of town, why are you in town alone?” Castiel interrupted, momentarily forgetting that he was the professional in this situation, and that Dean didn’t owe him any explanations.
“Wow, I am sorry about that, I was not expecting to have a reaction like that,” Castiel said in a fake, upbeat tone.
“Hello, Dean,” Castiel responded, reaching out and clapping Dean on the shoulder once, “it’s my pleasure to be here. Wanna sit down?” He gestured to the cafe to his right.
“Ha wow,” Dean said finally, taking an exaggerated inhale, “I did not mean to share all of that with you, I guess everything is still a little fresh from yesterday.” -Dean clapped his hands together once- “Anyways! I love history, always have. I enjoy reading and piecing together what really happened in the past. I want to be able to share with people that just because someone won a war or whatever, that they were the hero of the story. I remember how shocked I was to find out what a dirtbag Chris Columbus was and I want to be there to see the spark ignite in people and prompt that discussion about where we really came from. But dude, it’s super dull compared to you fighting death.”
“Jerk! What the hell was that for?” -Sam rubbed the back of his head, shooting a bitch face at Dean-  “You sound so excited and then you hit me?”
“He seemed to go along with it, I mean, as best as he could given that he was in the hospital.”
The man didn’t respond at first and did not seem to even notice that Dean was talking to him. Instead, he kept his eyes trained on the woman who was fumbling with her purse. Dean looked around to see if there was anyone else on the street that could back him up, but of course there wasn’t. It was 9:30 am on Thanksgiving, no one was just walking the streets when they could be with their family. The only help Dean might have hoped for were Meg and Jo inside the shop, where the hell were they?
“I just think that you should bring in people that have been trained to help kids in this situation-”
“Well, I got into this… altercation with this guy on the street - wait, hear me out first,” Dean was quick to add, he could see Castiel’s shoulders tense and already knew that what look was plastered across his face. It was one he had seen many times before, Castiel’s eyebrows were raised, the skin above his nose scrunched up, eyes wide, all in disbelief that Dean had put himself in such a situation.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Honeybee, I have something to tell you,” Dean lifted Cas’s hands up to kiss the backs of them. Castiel’s stomach dropped in anticipation. He took a deep breath and steadied himself for what was coming next.
“Yeah, we will not be doing that but A for effort.” Dean spat out, getting up from the bed and patting Cas on the back as he passed him. Cas turned, mouth agape, as he watched Dean pad over to the dresser and pull out a clean t-shirt.
Gabe crossed the room, unbuckling Tucker from the baby carrier as he took careful steps towards Castiel. His mind quickly recalled the memories of the first month or so after he collected his brother’s belongings from Dean’s apartment. Castiel had asked him to take his key and retrieve his clothes and textbooks, that he couldn’t go back and do it himself. Armed with a list of supplies and Dean’s schedule, Gabe dumped the contents of his brother’s drawers in the dresser into a laundry. He gathered Castiel’s clothing from the closet, and his books from the bookshelf in the living room and gently placed them in the duffel bag he brought along.
“You do not still love Castiel Novak,” -he closed his eyes and gulped hard, taking a deep breath, he opened his eyes and continued- “you met him at a pivotal point in your life and you haven’t let anyone else in like you did.”
“Before you ask, no I’m not surprised that you feel this way. I had my suspicions about what you wanted to talk about today.” Charlie answered, cutting him off before he could even form the thought to ask.
She pulled her hand back from Dean’s face and moved to wrap an arm around his shoulders. Dean leaned into her and allowed himself to be held, thankful for the warm contact.
“Cas, this kid is my responsibility,” -Dean closed his eyes as he spoke- “I can’t just pawn him off on someone else to deal with, there’s a reason he trusted me with this.”
“Ok, fine, we don’t have to talk about that any more, on one condition…” Charlie said, her voice picking up at the end.

Dean is struggling with his love life but is there light at the end of the tunnel???
“Take a breath, Cas,” -Castiel closed his eyes and inhaled deep, slowly releasing the air from his lungs in a long exhale- “you made it through the day.”
Castiel sat dumbfounded, the connection between his brain and his mouth fried as brain short circuited. Dean got a job in Boston? They could go together?
Cas felt bad that he had made Dean uncomfortable and that he was forcing his  care and attention on a man that obviously did not want to spend that much time with him. But a large part of him didn’t care, he had really missed Dean the past couple of years and there  was nothing more that he wanted to be doing than catching up with the one and only, Dean Winchester.
The time was 2:27 am and it was pouring rain. Castiel’s day had kicked his ass, then his archnemesis kicked it some more. After yet another unsuccessful attempt at bringing this man to justice, Castiel just wanted to be home in his warm bed with his husband, Dean, curled up next to him. He knew that another late night away from home without a decent excuse meant that Dean was going to be dead asleep on his side of the bed by the time Castiel got up these stairs to their apartment. All the lies and excuses about where he was spending his time resulted in Castiel being constantly on edge around Dean. On the rare occasion that he did go to bed with Dean, on those nights that he could lay in bed and hear Dean breathing next to him and feel his warmth, Castiel felt guilty and undeserving of such an incredible human being.
“Hi Becky, you weren’t interrupting and I’m ready if you are?” Dean said looking over to Castiel for confirmation.
As soon as Castiel stepped outside, he knew something was off. He could hear the man in the ambulance chatting up the EMT, Garth, and his heart dropped. There was no way that -
“Totally understandable, have fun with Sammy, give him my best,” Castiel said, fiddling with the empty mug in front of him.
“Take me home?” Dean asked, the hickies darkening on his neck.
“Dean?” Cas said, his voice uneven and unsure, “I’ve been wanting to talk to you about something. It's nothing bad don’t worry-” he added in a rush.
The two finally pulled themselves together, holding their sides and wiping imaginary tears from their eyes.
“What exactly are you asking me, Cas?” Dean asked, his voice barely audible and dripping in apprehension.
Dean’s day was going great; his term paper was coming along nicely, his favorite barista was working today so his cappuccino was made perfectly, and his brother just let him know that everyone would be able to attend Christmas at his place that year.
“Well,” Benny started and Cas held his breath, “he did say that y’all got in a fight about his mom but he didn’t get too into detail about the fight itself.”
--One Week Later--
“Huh” - he shook his head - “ I didn’t know I was that easy to read.” Dean took a deep breath, “Yeah, we had a big fight tonight and I’m just feeling kind of lost. I don’t really want to talk about the fight itself right now.”
“Ooooh, you saw them after your shift??? Who? Who? Who?” Gabe asked and Castiel could practically see him bouncing in his seat.
“Uh, Hi,” Castiel said, stumbling over his words as he hurriedly wiped the palm of his hand on his jeans to dry off the sweat. “My name is Castiel Novak and I just moved here from Pontiac, Illinois.” He held his hand out for the man to shake.
Dean spit the last few words out and looked away from Charlie, ashamed. His neck turned a bright pink color from the embarrassment of admitting how his partner treated him. The combination of anger at his position and of his admission of a problem turned his stomach, all he wanted was to curl into himself and hide.
“Oh shit, that’s right.” -Dean reached over to Cas and placed his hands on his shoulders- “I got distracted before but here goes.”
Man, Castiel really hated lying to him about where he was at night. He wasn’t cheating by any means; he just couldn’t tell his husband where he was, or who he was with, or what he was doing.
“Castiel,” Dean said, even toned, as he stood up from the bed, “if I report this to someone, there is going to be an investigation that involves Nick. And if that happens, then Nick is going to know that Jack told someone and only God knows what’s going to happen to him then. Oh wait, not just God, I know what would happen to Jack if that were to happen, Cas.”
“That’s why you shouldn’t be the one to help him, Dean!” -Cas threw his arms out and leaned forward at the hips- “You’re too close to this!”
“Dean, at least to me, and when it comes to Castiel, you’re like an open book,” she reached across the couch to lay a hand on his arm, “you have more to say.”
“Yes, fine, whatever you need Castiel. Take the entire last hour of your shift, I’ll cover it. But I will be rescheduling you to another time of my choosing,” Anna said, “and you, Mr. Winchester,” -she turned to face Sam- “you ever pull this crap in my hospital again, and I’ll revoke your lounge access.”
Exasperated, Dean retreated to his bedroom to lesson-plan for the upcoming semester. He had been a teacher for long enough that all of his lessons were basically written, he just needed to sit down with a calendar and fill in dates. The act of organizing and the anticipation of educating today’s youth always settled Dean down and filled him with a sense of purpose. As he settled into his chair and opened up his excel sheet, he felt the tension release from his shoulders.
“Ok, I hear you,” Dean said, conceding that Sam was right, “I just don’t feel the need to have those conversations with you. I feel like it's pretty straightforward, I’m going on dates and I just have a fine time when I’m out. They’re nothing spectacular, not bad by any means, just I haven’t gone out with anyone that I care enough to  go out with again. There’s nothing noteworthy to talk about.”
“Dean Michael, if you don’t behave then I’ll just have to get started without you.” Cas replied in a sing-songy tone.
Well, it would have been perfect had Dean not ruined everything. First, the pie crust was too thin and tore in several places, forcing him to piece it back together and ruin the perfect lines of the pie. Then, he overcooked the chicken to the point that it was rubbery. Then to top it all off, he burned his hand pulling the pie out of the oven and dropped the dish on the floor, shattering the pie pan and splattering pie all over the kitchen.
“Oh, you think you really beat me today? Babe, I could take you any day, hell I have! I just went easy on you, I couldn’t do this if you went to prison.” Cas said snarkily before pulling Dean down the hallway with him and into their bedroom.
“What the hell took you so long to get out here??” Dean asked, inhaling sharply as Meg pressed a rag against his abdomen to stop the bleeding.
“Dean.” Cas started and then stopped to take a deep breath before continuing.
Castiel finally got his front door unlocked and walked into a darkened apartment. Pausing for a moment in the doorway, he shrugged off the lack of light as his roommate’s feeble attempt to conserve energy. As he dropped his keys in the dish by the door, the gentle aroma of crisp, fresh flowers and clean linen greeted him. Following the smell, Castiel walked into his living room to find Dean sitting on a barstool surrounded by candles and flowers. Castiel stood motionless with his jaw dropped slightly. The tension fell from Cas’s shoulders as he took in the scene before him; the candles burning brightly, the soft white string lights Dean had hung, the sunflowers and lavender flowers, and the Thai food from their favorite restaurant sitting on the coffee table. Finally, his eyes returned to Dean and saw a small smile spread across his face, his eyes lighting up the room.
“Do you think he knows you feel this way? Have you told him?” Charlie said, leaning forward and down to meet Dean’s eyes, “and I mean really told him, not just passive-aggressively grumbled around the apartment until he noticed.”
“Erm, well,” -Castiel fidgeted in his seat, thankful that Gabe had left the mustache behind. It was simple and silly enough that it took the air out of his anxiety, bringing it down to manageable levels- “I just got back from coffee with Dean.”
“Dean, what is your address? Where am I taking you?” Cas twisted in his seat to look at Dean.
The words hung in the air, suspended by Castiel’s anger at the situation, by his anger at Dean’s absolute refusal to open up.
With most of his friends out of town, Dean was able to focus more on his school work and get a head start on this term paper. He was nearing the end of his first semester in graduate school and he was loving the work. He was working to obtain his master’s in Psychology with a concentration in childhood trauma. When he announced his plans to enroll in this program to his friends a year ago, everyone was worried if this was a good idea, that he was trying to take on too much at once, that the subject matter would be too overwhelming for Dean. He heard everyone’s thoughts and concerns, and even admitted that they were all valid. Dean was still in a fragile headspace but he had thought this through and knew that this was the next step in his life and that he would have the support system to work through whatever came next.
“Oof, what a line of questioning,” Dean replied as he inhaled deep, stealing a few moments to collect his thoughts. “Up until recently, Cas was incredibly supportive of my work and what I was doing. He would come home and seemed to be genuinely interested in my day. He would sit and eat dinner with me, then get up to clear the table and wash the dishes before retreating off into the office to do more assignments. He was everything I could have hoped for and more in a partner, he understood my need to take care of people but wasn’t afraid to tell me when I needed to back off and let him take care of himself.” Dean paused and worried the hem of his shirt between his hands, anxiously looking for anything to distract his hands from this conversation. Charlie looked down and quickly brought her head up to scan her nightstand for something to replace Dean’s shirt. She handed him a hairband and he began twisting and untwisting it.
He stood in his kitchen, running on autopilot to brown the meat, dice tomatoes, and stir the noodles, the familiar motions of a meal made many times removed Cas from the situation. All that occupied his mind was the proper seasonings to add to the sauce, when to rinse the pasta, and how thick to slice the garlic bread. The warm aroma of a rich bolognese sauce permeated the room, filling Castiel’s nostrils with the comforting smells of past memories. As he reminisced on previous dates and meals, the tension fell from his shoulders and the weight of that morning was lifted. He stood in front of his stovetop, eyes closed, and replayed the first time he and Dean had cooked together. They both agreed on something simple and of course this ended in both of them covered in sauce and naked on the floor of the kitchen. This was the first meal they had ever made in this new apartment, in this new city, in their new lives together. Cas’s stomach finally settled from their argument and instead growled in anticipation of a fulfilling meal.
“My class is known to be difficult, but I do have students that do exceptionally well, meaning that if you work hard enough, it will pay off for you. So take the next 5 to 10 minutes to get to know the people sitting next to you, talk to them, learn from them, don’t discredit them when it comes time to study and review the material. You will learn better working with others, I can almost guarantee it.” Crowley stopped in the middle of the floor and turned to face the class, “I mean it, take 10 minutes then I’ll go over the syllabus.”
“Of course, Dean,” he responded softly as he watched Dean turn and crutch away.
“So we met up this morning, at Trident, and,” -Dean swallowed hard and gave a shaky exhale- “And I had a great time with him.”
Notes at the end
“She’s watching House Hunters, she likes to criticize the couples for the kinds of houses they want. I’ll close the door and please, sit.” Charlie replied, pointing out her bed.
“If you hurt Dean again, I’ll stomp you into the ground Castiel. Hell I’ll kill you. I know several good lawyers and I’ll get away with it too,” Sam spat the words out.
“Yeah, I met her when I visited Jess for lunch here,” Sam said, shrugging his shoulders.
Cas stood before him in the living room and Dean was able to appreciate fully the effort that Cas had gone through. He hadn’t noticed before, but Cas was wearing dark blue slacks with a white button-down and a matching dark blue tie. The top button was undone and the knot of his tie was loose. Cas’s eyes were red-rimmed and his shirt sleeves were rolled up, revealing his forearms. Dean ran his eyes up and down over Cas, understanding that his night had been just as rough as his own.
“We’re on this shit STILL?” Cas cried out in disbelief, he looked up from his textbook and ripped his glasses off his face, “Dean, I told you a week ago what I thought you should do, you need to call CPS and let them handle this! This is not on you, nor should it be, please if there is something else that I can do for you just let me know, but in the meantime please don’t bother me with this again.”
“Hey, uh, thanks for bringing me home, you didn’t have to go through all that just for me,” Dean said, turning towards Castiel and resting his arm on the edge of the couch, “I know you have a life and better things to do than make house calls.”
We finally get the story for how our two boys met!
After Dean left, Castiel dragged himself back into their bedroom, buried himself under their comforter, and let the wall that barely suppressed his anguish break. His sobs racked his body, leaving his eyes puffy and his abdomen sore. He sobbed until the pillow under him was damp and the tears and snot ran together, until he couldn’t breathe. He released all the feelings of inadequacy that he hid and suppressed; the hopelessness he felt when he begged Dean to let him help. As the tears flowed, he felt the pain he was holding for Dean flow out of him. It broke his heart and removed a piece of him whenever he watched his lover battle his past. Dean’s refusal for help was enough to kill him.
In the handful of breaths that the two stood in the living without saying a  word to each other, Dean was finally able to place the music in his head. Cas pulled out his Sam Smith record, one of his favorites. Dean never listened to this album on his own, blame it on the emotional trauma, but he always thought it was too sad for him to truly enjoy. He’s brave enough to admit that while it pulled on his heart, Smith was talented and had a beautiful voice.
Warnings for mentions of child abuse
Cas cupped his hand under Dean’s chin and tilted his face towards him until their eyes met. Cas pulled Dean down to his lips a tender, almost chaste kiss. Cas broke the kiss, but left his hand on Dean’s face. The two laid there for a second, their shallow breaths deepening as they took in the full view of their lover laying before them. Cas took a deep breath and opened his mouth to speak.
The muted chime of Charlie’s phone timer went off in the other room. Dean sat up in the bed and waited for her to come tell him that it was time to go home, to confront Cas. He dressed and retied the laces of his boots. Charlie pulled him down to her height and wrapped him in the tightest hug she could give, and sent him on his way with good luck. Little did she know that the decision Dean made was not the same one she had in mind. Dean decided while laying in her bed, that he would stay silent on the issue. That he would rather stay in an unequal partnership than be alone. His perception of what he deserved left him with only those two options. The depths of his mind told him that no one who stayed with him this long would tolerate being asked to change or consider his emotional needs. Not when his only job was to care for others, to protect them, and to provide for them.
(See the end of the chapter for
“CASTIEL” - SMACK-
“Look, this is not an attempt to ask you out. We used to be great friends and I have to say, I’ve missed you. I would like to attempt to be your friend again, Dean Winchester.”
Finally, Jess took the phone from Sam and squared her shoulders to answer Dean.
“Hey little bro! To what do I owe this pleasure?” Gabe’s voice rang out through the phone.
“What did you call me?” Castiel asked, the lead weight sitting in his stomach lifted, his heart clenched.
God, he hoped that Cas felt the same way.
“Shit Cas. How can you love me? Knowing what I am? Cas, all I do is hurt people, hell I hurt YOU! I don’t deserve this kind of treatment from you, I don’t deserve you.” Dean desperately gasped out, tears filling his own eyes.
“Dean, I’m just stuck on the fact that you and I seem to fight every night and neither of us noticed for years. I mean, for god’s sake we started dating after we started fighting each other and we still didn’t notice.”  Cas said quietly as he undid Dean’s zipper, his hands lingering on his husband’s hips. “How can we be so out of touch that we went 8 years without putting the pieces together?”
“I know,” Sam responded, raising his hands in silent surrender, “I tried asking Dean to explain it to me, but he won’t talk about it.” -he cleared his throat- “You have every right to tell me to shove it right now, but can I ask you to tell me what happened?”
Cause if we don’t leave this town, we might never make it out -
Cas slowly looked back up at Dean. His eyes scanned Dean up and down and took in what his husband was wearing. Standing there in an equally tight, deep blue suit, Dean Winchester was immaculate. Dean’s perfectly sculpted muscles were clearly defined through his protective armor. Cas could tell that Dean was still recovering from their fight earlier, his brow was still glossy with sweat and his cheeks were flushed pink, just enough that his freckles stood out.
“Dean, that’s incredible, what made you decide to go back to school?’
“Hi, wow I’m not sure what to even say here,” the woman said from behind Meg. Meg turned and shuffled back a little so that she wasn’t between Dean and this woman.
Castiel sat back in his seat, eyes wide in surprise. He had always hoped that Dean would go back to school, that he would recognize his potential and push his limits. Not that he thought that Dean’s work as a history teacher wasn’t good enough or meaningful, but he knew that Dean didn’t feel challenged in his job, that he didn’t feel fulfilled in what he was doing. A Masters in Psychology was perfect for Dean. Castiel swallowed his surprise and flashed a bright smile at Dean, his pride glistening in his eyes.
While he was proud of himself for opening up, for sharing that part of himself with someone who had been to hell and back with him, he couldn’t believe Charlie accused him of still being in love with Castiel. He didn’t say anything to her at the moment, he neither confirmed nor denied.
“Ok, look Dean, before you get mad at me and yell, just understand where I’m coming  from” Sam said, breaking Dean’s train of thought. “I watched my big brother, my best friend and protector, have to put himself back together over the past two years. I have watched you combat and overcome so many aspects of your past and I am so proud of you. But yet when  it comes to  dating, it doesn’t seem like you’re trying? Does that make  sense? I have watched you go from being a “shove it down and cover it with booze, I’m fine” kind of guy to someone who is willing to have conversations about what you are going through but you’re not going to talk to me about the people you’re dating?”
“Yes! I do rather enjoy honey, the bees are magnificent creatures and they are dying far too quickly.”
When Gabe arrived at Castiel’s apartment, his knocks went unanswered. He used his own key and rushed into his brother’s bedroom. He breathed a sigh of relief to find that Castiel was alive and breathing, just stuck in his own mind and world, oblivious to his surroundings.
“If you could tell that he was hurting, why didn’t you call me?” Sam asked, his voice small.
“I want to be happy with someone, I’m tired of feeling so alone and I don’t know what’s wrong with me.”
Dean stood to look at his own reflection in the mirror.
“Dean-” Castiel’s voice came out in a sharp hiss- “this is why I wanted someone with you for a couple of days.” He stabilized Dean on his feet then dropped his hands back to his side. “It’s common for people with concussions to become very dizzy, especially when they exert themselves trying to go upstairs.”
Every time Dean found a response, his body refused to cooperate, his mouth dry, his tongue heavy, his lips sealed. His eyes remained locked on Castiel’s, his chest rose and fell with every breath as he focused on keeping his breathing even and controlled. Dean studied Cas’s face for any insight into what was going through his head, any hint as to how he should handle this going forward.
“I mean what the hell are you doing getting some chick’s number while you’re lying here in the street bleeding?? And who the hell is she to be giving guys her number while her son is over there, probably in shock from having a knife to neck not 10 minutes ago???” Meg responded, raising an eyebrow at him.
“Uh, yeah” -Dean took a deep breath- “my head just hurts and I can’t believe we’ve only done like, 6 freakin stairs,” Dean replied, matched Castiel’s tone and volume.
“Well this was supposed to be a date but you don’t seem to be having a good time! You’ve kinda been acting like an ass to everyone and I don’t know what I did wrong!” Dean shouted in response then slumped back against the bathroom door, exasperated.
Cas sat back in the booth in a stunned silence, his mouth agape. That whole interaction went by in a blur. He had meant to tell Dean how he felt. He practiced it this  morning in the mirror.
Dean and Cas stood, hand-in-hand, on the sidewalk outside their Boston brownstone for several minutes. The immensity of the moment they were in sat heavily in both of their minds.
“Cas?”
“Heya Jo! Happy Thanksgiving” - Sam waved into the camera -” Uh, I guess I don’t even know where to guess?”
He released the breath he had been holding and laughed in relief. Castiel was just as interested, he wasn’t just being nice when he told Dean that he wanted to get together sometime.
Castiel hung his head, eyes boring a hole into the floor between his feet. He concentrated on slowing his heart, on taking deep breaths. Count to 3 on the inhale. Count to 5 on the exhale. Repeat.
“Heya there Doc Novak!” Garth called out across the carport with a friendly wave, “See man, what did I tell ya? Didn’t I promise a fantastic doctor with hair that just won’t quit?!” Garth looked back towards Dean and said with a clap to his left shoulder.
“Shit,” Dean said, dropping his eyes from Cas’s and shaking his head, “I forget how well you know me, you’re right.”
He reached out and rubbed small circles in his younger brother’s back. Gabe looked up at the ceiling and took a deep breath. It had been a long time since his brother last looked the way he did now. Sitting on the bed holding his son, he seemed to be a shell of himself, the light that normally shone in his eyes was extinguished today. He knew that Castiel blamed himself for leaving, that he tortured himself for “abandoning Dean”, that he wished he had been strong enough to stay.
“I am not going to be able to return to studying genetic heart conditions knowing that you’re suffering on your own in here,” Cas responded, a sharp bite to his tone, “just, please, let me in, tell me what’s going on.” Cas gripped Dean’s hand reassuringly in his own.
“I was asking if you were ready?”
He read over the message and couldn’t believe what he had written. What was he doing, talking about his feelings like this? He scoffed and went to delete the message and accidentally hit the ‘send’ button instead.
Unfortunately, Dean was busy with other plans tonight and could not be here to play guest to Castiel’s pity party. Cas hadn’t actually seen Dean in a couple of days, in between Dean’s shifts at the Roadhouse and Cas practically living in the library and studying for finals, there hadn’t been a lot of time for just the two of them. And tonight? Even though Castiel was finally free of his undergraduate course work, Dean had plans that he could not get out of.
“I’m going to drop you,” Dean had stopped walking, they were in the bedroom now. Cas had been able to find a couple of pallets outside and brought them in to set the air mattress on top of so that they wouldn’t sleep on the floor.
“Thank you, Dean” -Cas flashed an award-winning smile- “I’d love a honey latte.”
So here he sits on Thanksgiving, term paper chugging along and an excellent source of caffeine to fuel him through it. Everything was going swimmingly until Dean heard a commotion outside the coffee shop. A shrill screaming and a deep, male voice yelling at the top of his lungs. Dean stood up and walked over to the window in hopes of an explanation for the noise, and what he saw chilled him despite the unusually pleasant weather outside.
Satisfied with himself, he copied and pasted the text and off it went, a little ~whoosh~ to let him know that it was now sitting in Cas’s phone. Dean gripped the phone in his hands, running his tongue over his back teeth.
“Come on Winchester, just send the stupid text,” his whispered harshly under his breath.
“So Sam’s in Kansas, with Jessica?” Castiel inquired, grabbing the suture kit off of the small table next to him.
Castiel was so caught up in thought that he didn’t notice that his bedroom light was on until he was in the room.
“Are you sure you’re going to be ok? I mean I feel like I can’t let either of us leave today without knowing that I’m going to be able to make this up to you someday?”
“Oh, I was just getting coffee with Cas,” Dean said, his heart clenching as he pieced together what he had just said. The words rolled off his tongue so effortlessly that he didn’t realize Cas’s nickname had slipped out. He nearly dropped the orange juice in his panic.
As he moved around the apartment, he looked at all the photographs that were hanging on the walls, at the happy, blissful memories of his brother and dear friend as they started their lives together. He couldn’t stop the weight from settling in his stomach, or the pain he felt in his heart for these two men that were obviously head over heels for each other. He knew that their feelings would not change for each other, that while someday they may put themselves back together, they would never be whole until they found each other again.
“Yeah, I do, thanks,” Sam said, leaning forward to grab his book off the coffee table.
“Hi, Dean? What’s going on?” he asked hesitantly.
After an agonizing minute of silence, Sam knelt beside Castiel and helped him to gather the scattered papers. He handed the files back to Castiel and gave him a hand to stand back up.
“Dean… what are you wearing?” Cas asked in a voice barely above a whisper.
Castiel rolled his shoulders back before standing up. He began to pace up and down the locker room, the repetitive movement helped him to think, to settle his nerves.
Dean looked over at Charlie, his eyebrow raised.
“I do know you, Dean, please let me in, let me help you.”
“Cas-” Dean started as he pushed Cas’s hands off his face.
Hello, Dean. I would love to get a cup of coffee with you. How’s tomorrow at 11? We could meet at Trident Cafe? Let me know :D
“So? Boy troubles?” She asked softly, almost whispering.
“Yeah man it’s Benny, I have Dean here passed out on my couch if you were lookin for ‘im,” Benny said, his drawl was so painfully obvious in his words that Castiel couldn’t believe it had taken him so long to recognize it.
Dean processes the news Charlie gave him
“Dean, is the air ma-” *whump*  “-ttress going to hold me?” Cas asked as Dean dropped him onto the air mattress  that did hold him.
Luckily for Dean, the driver of the car was paying attention to the fight on the sidewalk and was already slowing his car down by the time Dean was in the street. When the car hit Dean, it wasn’t going very fast. Unfortunately, it was still going fast enough to crack the bone in Dean’s thigh, but at least he wasn’t run over. The driver jumped out of his car and ran over to Dean, already dialing 911. The driver finds a bloody Dean and a scared woman and child, the driver looks up to try to find the man that attacked Dean but found that he had already run off.
“Ok,” -Dean took a deep breath and turned so that he was sitting and facing Charlie- “obviously, you know that I broke my leg and Castiel was the doctor that stitched me up at the hospital. Well, I texted him a couple days ago about meeting up and getting coffee today.” Dean paused, trying to gauge Charlie’s reaction to what he was saying, but her face revealed no indication of her thoughts. He continued,
“Why would I want you to leave? Do you want to leave?” Cas’s voice broke.
“I do know! This was my life, Cas!” -Dean cut off Cas, gesturing with both hands towards his chest- “I know what this kid is going through because I fucking lived it! Who else is going to know how to help him other than me?”
“Yeah, ok, you said that you saw him after your shift?” Gabe asked, pulling his head back up.
Dean was overwhelmed. His brain tried to fit the pieces together. His stomach churned with the guilt of not giving Cas enough credit, of assuming that this angel would rather toss him out on the street than be asked to treat him as an equal. John’s words about the kind of man Dean was roared in his mind throughout most of his life and their only equal, their only true adversary, were the words that left Castiel’s mouth every time he talked about Dean. With every declaration of love and gratitude, the volume of the roar diminished.
“Dean?” Cas called from the living room, “are you home? How was work today?”
“Wow, Sammy, someone sounds defensive,” Dean said, sarcasm filling his voice.
Jo shut her mouth, her eyes locked on Castiel as she dropped her bag in the living room. She turned on her heel and left the room to busy herself in the kitchen. Dean and Castiel sat in silence in the living room and listened to the clattering of flatware and slamming of cabinet doors in the kitchen.
“Hell Yeah! Thanks, man! You’re like an angel-in-disguise, Cas.” Dean replied, a bright smile lit up his face.
“Wow, haha” Dean chuckles out “I cannot believe you’re still driving this death trap on wheels”
“Hell yeah, this is better,” Dean said before kicking the door closed behind him.
“You’re still in love with him.” Charlie whispered as silent tears ran down Dean’s cheeks.
He only had a few minutes of browsing before he heard the click-click of crutches entering the front door. Castiel turned towards the sounds, knowing that he would see Dean, and was still awestruck by the sight before him. Suddenly he was 18 again, speechless at the beauty that was Dean Winchester. There were snowflakes resting in his soft, honey-colored hair, the cold air turned his cheeks red, creating sharp contrast to his freckles. Dean crutched over towards him and Castiel could see that the green of Dean’s scarf brought out the color of his eyes. Castiel’s heart seized, his breath caught in his chest, and an ache settled in his stomach at the love he felt towards this other man. He smiled at Dean, watching as a smile spread across Dean’s face and Castiel could feel the layer of sweat form on the palms of his hands.
“Shoot, what’s up?” Castiel said.
Gabriel nodded along with his brother’s words, not having a clue on how to handle the situation that was unfolding in front of him. Castiel’s reaction to seeing Dean today undoubtedly confirmed Gabe’s suspicions that he was still madly, irrevocably in love with Dean Winchester.
“Yeah, Dean! They are exactly where you left them. If you need anything just yell.” Sam said quietly, not looking up at his brother.
“Ah haha, yes there is,” Sam said, chuckling, “I am nervous as hell to be around Jess because,” -he took a deep breath and laid a hand on Dean’s shoulder- “I’m going to propose to her soon and I am so totally freaked.”
Dean stepped out of Charlie’s building and into the cold. He fished his cell phone out of his pants pocket and sent Cas a message.
This thought snapped him back into the moment and he felt his chest tighten as he realized that Cain’s costume changed from a dark grey to this deep blue color about 5 years back.
The wall there wasn’t structurally important and only served to separate the two rooms rather than allowing an open floor plan to exist. The only thing on this wall was a small nail that protruded over a bare splotch of slightly discolored paint. Dean swallowed hard when Castiel paused in front of this space. There was no way for Dean to know for sure what was going through Castiel’s head but he could see from the way that his smile didn’t make it to his eyes and the false light behind those beautiful, blue irises that he had been surprised by this one change to the apartment. The only thing that Dean had been able to remove had been a framed photograph of the two of them on the day that they moved in. The photo that Dean had taken in front of the apartment taunted him in the months following their breakup, he couldn’t begin to move on and repair himself with the constant reminder that despite all of the hope and love and dedication that they had started with, that they had failed each other.
Castiel turned away from the bare nail and crossed the living room in swift strides and with a strained smile spread across his face. He sat down in the chair off to Dean’s left.
“Sounds like a plan, cowboy. And thank you again,” Lisa replied softly, digging through her purse for something with her number on it. “Here you go, and I’ll be expecting that phone call, Dean.”
The apartment was dark except for a soft, warm glow from the living room. Dean stepped into the front hall, toeing his boots off and leaving them behind on the entry mat. He crept through the darkened hallway, following the scent of vanilla and the quiet plucking of gentle music. Dean recognized the music, the acoustics, and the singer’s voice, but he couldn’t place it immediately. He turned the corner into the living room to find Castiel sitting on the floor with his back resting against their overstuffed armchair, his hair wet from a recent shower and his lower lip red from his anxious picking.
“Dean,” Cas said softly, “come on, let’s go in the other room.” Cas took Dean’s hand and gently pulled him into their bedroom.
“Ok, now that we have that one out of the way. Why do you love him? How is he contributing to this relationship? How does he meet your expectations and perceptions of a partner?” Charlie asked, leaning back and crossing her arms across her chest.
Dean stared at Castiel for a moment. He had a witty response queued up about how Castiel just wanted an excuse to get his hands on him, but he refrained; this was not the time for casual flirting. He finally tore his eyes away from the concerned look plastered on Castiel’s face for long enough to unlock the front door of the building. The two made their way inside and stopped at the bottom of the main staircase.
“Number 2.”
“Dean,” Castiel started, losing his words along the way, his mouth suddenly going dry  as if he had stuffed it full of cotton.
Castiel’s eyes glistened as he realized that Dean welcomed his help. He grabbed Dean’s arm and shifted Dean next to him so that more of his weight was on himself. He tightened his grip around Dean’s waist and waited for Dean to start them up the stairs again.
Dean remained silent while he was wheeled into his room, listening to Castiel’s nurses as they briefed him on Dean’s condition.
After another hour of cast fitting, receiving a laundry list of discharge instructions, and paying for his hospital visit, Dean and Castiel were leaving the Boston Medical Center and crossing through the employee parking garage to Castiel’s car.
“Dean you WHAT?? You went to the emergency room?! And you didn’t call me?” Sam looked off-camera and waved someone over. Jess sat down next to Sam and entered the frame.
The hour passed in what seemed like the blink of an eye. Dean hadn’t slept, not that he expected to. He asked Charlie for the time to gather his thoughts, to prepare himself for this conversation with Cas. His mind whirred like a broken machine, flashes of the potential outcomes for this conversation danced through his brain. Dean knew that he should give Cas the benefit of the doubt, that he would probably take this conversation and Dean’s concerns seriously and not storm out. Or he would decide that Dean wasn’t worth the trouble, that he wasn’t the push-over caretaker that he had signed up for. Despite his better judgment, this was the conclusion Dean had settled on.
They had been at the party for about 2 hours and Cas found his slumped on a couch with a beer, questioning how he found himself at this stupid frat house. Dean was nowhere to be seen, it seemed to Cas that he disappeared as soon as they arrived. Dean was probably caught up with his actual friends, Cas thought, and he was probably only invited as a partner to Dean’s costume.
Dean sat, watching Charlie, hoping that she would say something and give him an excuse to not continue. He sat there, silently pleading with her to not force him to say what was bubbling within him. As he felt the pressure behind his eyes build and the blood rush to his cheeks, Charlie sat, patiently waiting for Dean to finish what he was saying.
“Look, man, there was a woman and her kid on the sidewalk. This guy came up to this and grabbed the kid. He was demanding money from the woman and was going to cut her kid if she didn’t pay up. I had to do something, I was the closest one there and I wasn’t going to let some hyped drug addict ruin that family’s holiday. So do what you need to do so I can get out of here.” Dean spat out with his arms crossed.
I should do something about this, Dean thought to himself. He turned and climbed into the shower, working up a nerve to reach out to the man and ask to see him again. As he worked body wash across his chest, Dean realized that he wasn’t ready to share his maybe-feelings with anyone else until he was sure about them. What if he was wrong or even worse, what if Cas didn’t feel the same way anymore? Knowing how badly this could end, he settled on asking Cas out for another cup of coffee, maybe a sandwich too. But purely to confirm his feelings, this was solely for science and not for the enjoyment of spending time with Cas.
Sam leaned back and huffed in amusement. He may be in law school and at the top of his class, but he never felt as stupid as he did right then. How could he not have seen this?
“I’m ashamed to say that I don’t know what happened,” Sam said, “that last night.”
Hey, I was thinking about you and what you said. I’d be down to get coffee sometime soon if you were still interested. Let me know what you think, I’d also like to get back in touch and reconnect,  hope to see you soon :)
“You’re right, you’re right,” -Castiel set his mug down and leaned forward, mimicking Gabe’s body language- “You definitely deserve answers, so here goes.
Castiel blushed, he turned his head away from Dean as he felt the blood rush to his cheeks and neck. Dean’s praise nearly put him over the edge. He had always been Castiel’s biggest fan and support system during school, he pushed Castiel to study and to be the best that he could be. Dean was the one who stayed up all night with him going over flashcards and letting Castiel teach him about ATP production and creating MCAT practice questions. It was always expected that Dean would be there to celebrate him graduating med school, that Dean would also be recognized for all his work along the way. Castiel thought back to graduation day, to how he felt as he scanned the crowd, looking for Dean’s dazzling green eyes and smile.  It broke Castiel’s heart again remembering that Dean hadn’t been there.
“-Babe, please, I asked you to hear me out.” -Cas dropped his hands, finding one of Dean’s and weaving their fingers together- “I want to meet your mother, I know I can’t physically talk to her but I want to know where she is, I want to talk to her and thank her for giving me this wonderful person. We’ve been together for 6 and a half years and we hardly ever talk about her, Dean” -Cas squeezed Dean’s hand lightly- “I barely know anything about her.”
“Who the fuck am I kidding, I am still head over heels for that man and I always will be,” Dean finally whispered, his admission cutting through the thick air. He let out a watery chuckle as a weight was lifted from his shoulders. A smile crept across his face until his teeth showed and his eyes lit up. Looking at himself in the mirror, he almost didn’t recognize himself. It had been years since he felt as good as he did right then. His body felt lighter, his heart ached less, and he wasn’t ashamed to be thinking about Cas.
“Uh, thank you, I suppose,” Castiel said, brushing off the bottom of his lab coat, “what are you here to talk about? Can I help you with something?”
The two of them remained in silence for a couple of minutes while Gabriel busied himself in Castiel’s kitchen making hot chocolate for the both of them, something that he always did when he could tell that Cassie was going through something. Gabe reentered the living room with two giant mugs filled with cocoa and topped with a pile of whipped cream. He had even topped the beverage with crushed peppermints, tis the season and all.
And by the time she wakes
Cas was left with his thoughts, watching Dean’s bow legs carry him across the shop. He studied Dean as he stood in line and wondered what he was doing here. Sure, it would be nice to have a friend in his classes, someone to study with, and who would understand the stress of the course. But was that why he was here? Cas heard a small whisper in the back of his head, telling him that he knew his motive for being there, and it wasn’t to find someone to study with.
His stomach flipped and his neck was hot. Grinning like a teenager he pictured meeting Cas for a quiet drink out, the lights dim in the bar and the music loud enough that they have to lean in close to hear each other. Maybe they’d get some bar snacks, like nachos or something to split, and their hands would meet, leading to more physical contact.
“Dr. Novak, you better have a good reason for disrupting my emergency room like this. Want to explain to me just what on Gaia’s green earth this is?” Dr. Milton stood before Castiel and Sam, her eyes shooting daggers, her lips drawn into a tight line across her face.
“OH-” -Cas pushed Dean’s hands off his shoulders- “But you’re allowed to just leave me in the company of strangers! You blew me off the moment we got here, what the hell Dean?!” Cas yelled back, drawing the attention of a small crowd of people standing near them.
(See the end of the chapter for
“What?” - Dean snapped his head back towards Castiel, completely unaware that the man had been talking to him - “Sorry, what did you say?”
Dean looked away from his phone blushing, he was still clad only in his underwear and couldn’t  pull himself away from the text thread. Butterflies filled his stomach and he couldn’t remember the last time that he was so excited to see someone again. The ease of the conversation and the afterglow that he was in confirmed his earlier suspicions. He did have feelings for Castiel and needed to figure out what to do about them.
She took the jacket from him and dropped it on the floor. Placing her hands on his shoulders, she turned him around and pushed him to sit on the corner of her bed. She bent to remove Dean’s salt-covered boots. He moved up into the bed and Charlie covered him with the comforter on her bed. He pulled the blanket up to his chin, an act that pulled on her heartstrings. She walked over to the other side of the bed and added another blanket on top of Dean, one that was large and plush. She scooted into the bed next to him and sat with her back against her headboard. Dean curled up next to Charlie and rested his head against her shoulder. They sat there for a while, with Charlie’s arms wrapped around Dean and her head resting on top of his. She ran one hand through his hair and the other was rubbing his shoulder.
Dean looked at Sam, dumbfounded, he moved silently to the chair in front of him and took a seat. Never taking his eyes off Sam.
Dean and Meg watched as Lisa sat down on the curb next to her son and placed her jacket around his shoulders.
Dean lifted his head up towards Cas’s face, his face contorted in disbelief, his eyebrows scrunched and his mouth agape.
Dean began moving down Cas’s neck, leaving kisses and bites down to his shirt collar. He sat back on his heels and lightly gripped the bottom of Cas’s shirt.
“... uh, oh Yeah, haha thanks man for the pep talk on the way here. And Hey, don’t forget to shoot me a text when you get off later.” Dean replied somewhat distractedly, quickly shifting his eyes from Castiel back to Garth.
We’ll have driven through the state
“Yeah Dean, of course! You know I’m always down for cheap chinese food!” Garth said while giving Dean a hardy high-five. “And you!” he pointed at Castiel, “You take good care of my man, Dean here, bye Doc! Until next time!” Garth turned away and hopped back into the ambulance, leaving Dean in the care of Castiel and his nursing team.
Castiel balanced the files in one hand and managed to slip the phone out of his pocket without dropping anything. He read the message and couldn’t fight a small smile from spreading across his face. Dean was asking him to get coffee or drinks sometime in the near future. While delighted to see Dean again, Castiel was surprised to hear back from him so soon. They just saw each other socially yesterday for the first time in years, he thought it had gone well and he was pleased to find out that Dean also thought that.
“I have gone through enough shit, I refuse to let this blame be laid at my doorstep any longer. I hate myself enough for what I did, for leaving, I don’t need you to hate me too,” Castiel choked on his words, his voice watery. He swallowed hard, forcing back tears.
“I’ve loved him since the day I met him,” Castiel answered without hesitation.
“So? Say something, Dean. Can we please have a conversation about this? Will you let me help you?” Cas pleaded, reaching out to hold Dean’s hands.
Surely he didn’t still have feelings, he was just caught up in seeing the guy yesterday and overthinking what Charlie accused him of last night. Right, that was it.
Dean stood in the silence of his apartment wishing that he hadn’t just sent away his only company. He cursed under his breath at his inability to talk through what he was thinking and feeling. All Sam wanted was to be there for him, to be a shoulder for Dean to lean on and all Dean kept doing was pushing his brother away. And now that he had something that he needed to work through, there was no one around.
Dean’s smile faltered and he looked down at his lap briefly, as if to collect himself. Castiel could feel the grin fall from his face, the butterflies in his stomach instantly turned to lead. Had he overstepped? He thought. He had been known to get too comfortable too quickly with people, that he didn’t have the best record of making new friends, that his “people skills” were “rusty”. As if they had ever been anything but.
“Yeah princess I know, that’s why I’m concerned, I don’t want you rushing into anything and while I want you to get out there again, I’m not sure that a traumatized, single mom is the move for you right now.” Meg said, grabbing Dean’s hand to give it a soft squeeze.
Cas pulled out of Dean’s grasp and grabs Dean’s shoulders to turn him around. The two of them are facing each other now, Cas sets his cup of coffee down and gently places both hands on Dean’s face, he gazes deep into Dean’s eyes, taking in the green color and the flecks of gold staring back at him. The air between the two of them is electric as they stand in their new kitchen in silence. Cas pulls Dean down and closes the gap between them until their lips meet. Their kiss deepens and Cas’s hands find their way into Dean’s hair. Dean blindly finds the counter to set his coffee down on and wraps both arms tightly around Cas.
The cool, even tone of Cas’s voice hit Dean like a truck. The lack of emotion, the palpable silence that filled the room afterwards. Dean’s stomach dropped and he worked his fingers in and out of fists at his side. A wave of inadequacy washed over Dean, his partner was no longer interested in what was going on in his life. His boyfriend was now too busy for him and didn’t care to help him through his issues anymore. The heaviest blow was Cas’s stab at Benny. It became painfully obvious to Dean that Cas was jealous of Benny, that Cas trusted Dean so little that he considered Benny to be a threat.
A blowout between our boys and the introduction of a fan favorite <3
Cas’s voice broke on the last word. He clapped a hand over his mouth to stifle the cry that threatened to erupt from his person. His knees buckled and he almost fell. Sam jumped up from his seat and guided Cas down to the bench off to his side.
Castiel looked over to Gabe, his eyes red rimmed and his cheeks hot.
“Yes, Dean?” Cas replied, lifting his head off Dean’s shoulder.
“Cas, you know why. You changed yours for the same reason, I can’t believe we didn’t put the pieces together sooner.” Dean whispered. And there it was, Cas’s breath hitched and he had to stifle a cry as he pieced together that the two of them chose suits that matched each other’s eyes.
“I do, baby, this.” -Dean gestured broadly to the room around him- “I had something to tell you and something to ask you and I knew that today was going to be a long day for you, so I wanted to do something nice for you.”
With his drink plans for tomorrow solidified, Castiel knew that he needed to get back to work. He reluctantly said goodbye to Dean and flipped the file on the top of the stack open. He took off at a brisk pace, head down, skimming the patient chart when he turned the corner-
Just an hour and a half longer, just a simple 90 minutes and Castiel was free for the night. Well, pending any emergency or disaster that might surface between now and then. Castiel stood from his small desk to take a quick lap around the hospital floor. He enjoyed the break from staring at a screen and his route allowed him to peek in and check on various patients that had been admitted to a room.
“Dean, I work with her, she’s usually my trauma nurse but she’s on vacation this week. Apparently visiting your family in Kansas for the holiday.” Castiel quipped, he returned to Dean’s suture, shocked that someone he thought to be one of his closest work friends had kept such an important piece of information from him. He couldn’t wrap his mind around the fact that she didn’t tell him that she was dating - hell, ready to spend the rest of her life with the brother of someone he dated…
Dean took a deep breath, hoping to slow his heart rate down when his phone chirped, alerting him to a new text. His stomach flipped and he reached a shaking hand across his bed towards his phone. He closed his eyes and held his breath as he read:
“I’ll get there Dean! GOD-” Sam shook his head, returning his attention to his book.
He looked out the windshield and saw the large group of people forming outside the scene, they were all screaming, and pointing, and they were yelling at him? Dean finally looked at where they were pointing and saw the small blaze starting near the pickup several yards away. He heard people right outside his mother’s door but he couldn’t be bothered to pay attention to their calls. He was focused solely on Mary, his heart rate accelerating as he became more aware of their situation. The nearing fire, the useless car doors, and his injured mom.
“Dean, of course I will, how could you even think you need to ask?” Cas responded, his eyes twinkling in wonder at the man sitting in front of him.
“Yeah, Deanie Beanie, of course, what’s up?” Charlie answered, turning around in his bed and crossing her legs underneath her.
As Benny continued talking, Cas felt the floor fall out from under him. Dean told Benny about his mother’s accident? That he had been there to see her die? His heart raced, why hadn’t Dean told him that before?
“I’m just having difficulties with a student in my class,” Dean answered.
Today had been the longest day of his life and there was nothing he wanted more than to be in the comfort of his own home right this minute. Ok, that might not have been true. What he actually wanted more than anything was to be wrapped up in Dean’s arms, the two of them curled up together on his couch eating takeout and watching one of Dean’s dumb history documentaries.
Castiel stopped dead in his tracks.
“So what, you’re going to ignore any thoughts that I have on this?” Cas asked, his eyes watery and red-rimmed, “do I not get to have an input whenever you go through something? When are you going to let me start helping you, Dean? I care about you and I care about your student, just because I personally didn’t go through the same things doesn't mean that I don’t have advice to give you.”
“Actually, since you brought her up earlier, I might stop over at Jess’s and see if she wants to go out and get something to eat. You sure you’ll be ok on your own?” Sam said, standing up and gathering his things, “I have some work to do also so I might end up at the Law Library for a little bit too, but only if you’re sure you don’t need me here.”
He moved his thumb to the first letter, watching as it trembled. He huffed and finally hit the first letter, his resolve strengthened and he found it easier to finish the message.
“Hello, Dean” Cas spoke with false confidence. His mouth went dry and his tongue felt like sandpaper in his mouth.
“So, thanks again for taking notes for me yesterday and for offering to help me through the material that I missed. I can’t believe I had to miss a lecture this early in the semester. I hope the coffee was payment enough for helping me out.” Dean said, gesturing to the coffee sitting untouched in front of Cas.
“I -uh, hm, would like to know more about your mother and I would like to be someone that you can open up to about her. I’m uh” -Cas broke eye contact, instead focusing on Dean’s hand in his own- “I’m, well, I’m worried about you Dean. I feel like you’re carrying this weight on your own and you don’t have to be.”
“We watch the old Dune movie from the 80’s, the new one is in the works and I want to be reminded of how the original one was so I can put all my expectations in order.” She said, practically vibrating with excitement.
“Dean, wait please” Castiel snapped out of it, grabbing at Dean’s arm as he made his way towards the front door, “please don’t leave, let’s talk about this please, I didn’t handle that correctly and I just want to be a partner with you and I feel like you haven’t let me do that, Dean, please-” Cas stumbled over his words, desperate to get them out before Dean could leave.
“Hey-” Cas warned “Zeke has gotten us through a lot of hard times, he’s reliable” Cas said as he slapped the roof over the driver’s door.
The man lunged at Dean with the knife, waving his arm in wild, erratic slashing motions. Dean had  been in his fair share of fights before, but always with men that he was able to track and predict, this man was unpredictable and dangerous. Dean is able to dodge and avoid his slashes well enough until he hears the woman’s crying again and tries to look for her. By the time he looks up at the man again, no more than a second later, the man is too close to evade. The man slashes once more and catches Dean across his abdomen and up his left side towards his elbow. Dean stumbles back out of the slash and out of the man’s reach into the street behind him. In all the commotion, Dean wasn’t paying attention to the road and didn’t see the car coming down the street until it made contact with his right leg.
Despite pulling all nighters earlier that week, Cas still felt drastically unprepared for his last two exams. His last two finals were, coincidentally, for his hardest courses, and they were scheduled back to back.
“Don’t worry, Mommy, I’ll come to you,” Dean said, unbuckling his seatbelt and climbing over the console to his mother. Carefully avoiding the glass, he settled into the seat next to her.
“Yes, Dean, I’ve thought about this a lot and I know I don’t usually bottom but you mean the world to me and you made such a big sacrifice for me and I never want anything or anyone else. I just want to feel you, and only you.” Cas said, confidently, as if he had rehearsed this statement 10 times before.
“Uh-huh, sure it wasn’t” -Sam raised an eyebrow, not believing a word from his brother- “But seriously, how are you doing?”
-Pack yourself a toothbrush dear, pack yourself a favorite blouse.
“So, you have a large incision wound to your abdomen, a broken femur, and possibly a concussion? Want to tell me what happened to you?” Castiel asked pointedly, his back to Dean while he snapped on fresh gloves.
Dean didn’t respond. Cas stood still for a moment, his back to Dean. He clenched his fists and inhaled deeply before turning to face Dean. When he turned, the rage he had been fighting all night died in his chest. Dean’s eyes were downcast, shame and disappointment clouding his usually bright features. A heavy weight settled in Castiel’s stomach. -Shit, he thought. -
“What pose should w-” Cas tried to ask but couldn’t because Dean had run over and swept Cas off of his feet and was holding him in his arms, bridal style.
“As I was saying, I could ask Jo to stay over for a couple of nights. She was planning on coming over and watching football with me after her shift at Hellflame tonight. Sammy is out of town but I am not alone.” Dean said sharply. “I’ll give her a call on my way out of here. I’ll have to call an uber as I am not going to get on a bus with crutches.”
Taking a deep breath, Dean pushed away from the desk for a minute. He closed his eyes and forced a smile on his face. He had read somewhere that forcing yourself to smile for 20 minutes a day raised your serotonin levels and helped to reduce stress. Desperate for a mental reset, Dean dragged his cast back into the kitchen to steal one of the kombuchas that Sam stocked in the fridge but of course he would deny ever drinking one.
Dean gripped his phone tightly in his hand, nearly giddy at the prospect of getting coffee in the morning. The satisfaction of putting himself out there and then being rewarded with Castiel saying yes washed over Dean, bathing him in gentle anticipation for the next day.
Jo returned to the living room and silently sat in the same chair that Castiel had just vacated. She sat there not saying a word until Dean took a seat on the couch. Dean shifted uneasily in his seat, feeling the intensity of her accusing stare.
“So, what do you want to be when you grow up, Dean?” Cas asked, he raised his mug up to his face with both hands, raising an eyebrow over the lip.
“Things really started to fall apart when he started having those nightmares again, the ones about your mom dying?” Castiel said, looking to Sam for approval to continue, their eyes met and Sam gave him a small nod,  “he was having these nightmares and was barely sleeping. This was around Mother’s Day that last year. I tried asking him about them and he avoided every opportunity to answer me, trying to say that I was exaggerating how bad they were, that he was fine and handling it. But of course, he wasn’t fine, of course he wasn’t handling it. I tried to help him, and he wouldn’t let me in. Things got worse from there, his anxiety was near debilitating, and I could tell that he was starting to question why I was still there in the relationship.”
“Uh, well,” Cas spoke in a near whisper, he hadn’t been asked this with such genuine interest before. “I’m not entirely sure yet, but I was thinking about maybe cardiovascular surgery.”
Anna turned back to Castiel and flashed him a small smirk before moving swiftly and silently back towards the ER.
“Yes.” Castiel responded, to the point.
“WHAT” -SMACK- “THE” -SMACK- “HELL” -SMACK- “were you thinking?” His screams died out, he sat in the seat breathing heavy.
“There was no way that light had been green for more than a second! Damn, Cas, the people up here really are Massholes.” Dean said angrily, turning around in his seat to glare at the driver behind them.
“Cas, the worst part of this was how Jack was tripping over himself apologizing to me, that he was going to try harder in my class. He begged me to not fail him on his assignments, saying that he didn’t know how he would explain a poor grade to his shithead father.” Dean said in a near whisper, “of course the kid didn’t call his dad a shithead, god he was the most polite kid. I just don’t know what to do here, he reminds me so much of Sammy, he’s so smart and has so much potential and he doesn’t have anyone to protect him from his dad. Cas, what do I do?”
