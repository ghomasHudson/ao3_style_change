For a second it was awkward, but Dean didn’t turn his gaze away – instead, for once, an understanding seemed to melt the two of them together, breaking the tension, and Castiel found his lips capturing Dean’s again.
not the hex,” Dean repeats, nodding down towards the general direction of his groin. There are a few grating seconds of awkwardness as Cas narrows his eyes at him, looks down, back again, rinse and repeat. It’s worth the awkward, though, seeing Cas’s face as it dawns to him.
Fading – Dean notices that he is, in fact, more transparent; which is freaky, but if he’s fading from the Empty… does that mean he’ll wake up
They both breathe heavy as Dean breaks the kiss to draw in air.
Sometime during hour four, Castiel gave up and tiptoed closer to the reading area to find Dean still there, reading. Usually, they are dead by the end of hour three. It’s closing on five and a half hours, and Dean is nearing the last pages of the novel. Castiel is starting to wish he wasn’t reading so slowly, doesn’t know if that’s just who he is as a reader, or if it’s the library’s effect on him, making him study each paragraph closely. Fact still remains that
, and then there is darkness.
The library chooses the people.
Cas opens and closes his mouth. Dean snorts, smiling, an inexplicable fondness taking over his features for a moment before his face settles into an earnestly serious look. “Cas, listen to me. There’s obviously something going on in this place. And the ‘something’ is not
for you..."

Castiel’s eyes landed onto the handprint on Dean’s shoulder, still there, the claim he had left years ago, not by choice, yet he now looked at it fondly.
Save for what he tries desperately to bury and never let his brain make him see, ever again.
. He’s still subconsciously expecting to be judged. And the surprise of Cas just taking him as he is? It fills his heart with such warmth it hurts a little, every single time.
“That’s not gonna happen.”
Dean looks him up and down, attempts not to let him mimicking Cas’s form bother him, only half succeeding, even if his focus is elsewhere, his frown deep.
Cas breathes against his lips, whispers, “Green.” Doesn’t complain about Dean treating him like he might break; as Dean had when they first started playing with the idea of dominance and submission. How Castiel ended up being
Cas nodded, still holding on to Dean’s waist.
Cas seems to be having nearly as much trouble getting his words out, his eyes half shut as he gazes at Dean. “
“What do you want to do?” Dean asks, because it’s easier than
“Hey,” he goes on, hands landing onto Castiel’s shoulders again, firmly, holding onto the fabric in a suggestion to slide the trench coat off his shoulders. “Cas, look at me.”
“No, I was messing with you with
“Dean,” he says, when the other has spent a long while swearing at the chains under his breath, “I’m — I am not going to blame you if...” He trails off at the glare Dean shoots him. Sighs. “It’s not worth it. I think my fate was determined a long time ago. I don’t think you are able to—”
He hates her for robbing him of his words now more than ever because he needs them to love Dean.
Dean replied with pulling him into another breathless kiss.
Gabriel didn’t look at Sam, he couldn’t. “Nothing, nothing is wrong.”
It was dark except for a red light, which didn’t make him feel better. There were two jump scares and someone grabbed his leg, that one was the worst. After the zombie grabbed his leg he bumped into a guy, “Oh crap sorry.” He shrugged, “You get grabbed too? I don’t think these people like me.”
After that Dean almost melted again, he got called out and he knew it. “Mean, but yes. I’m glad you think I'm cute though, the feeling is mutual.”
All the present were opened with a good size pile of paper bags in front of Dean. He had gotten a present from almost everyone, and he thanked anyone who got him something. “Thank you everyone I will definitely be drinking ALL of this, but excuse me I need to use the restroom. I’ll be right back.”
Castiel came forward from the crowd, "You like it Dean? I made Sam get a bunch of alcohol to outweigh the decorations. And Jack helped put everything up!”
“Yes I want you to, respectfully of course. I'll take the couch.”
There was a pause, a calmness. “You, you what?” A break in Gabriel’s voice.
‘I wish I could get enough courage to tell Castiel how I really feel’
“Open your eyes.”
After almost an hour Dean walked out, beat to hell. The door closed behind Dean and Cas ran up to him. He was bleeding real bad on his forehead, his lip, and his knuckles. Dean had the start of some really bad bruises all over him, and those were the visible ones.
Morning voice, Sam had waited to hear that. “Morning.” He stayed there for a second before moving to sit up. “You’ve been sleeping for awhile, Dean and Cas left already.”
Castiel laughed, “You are very lucky Dean. Should we get started?”
Most of their day was filled with more walking and talking, domestic-ness. It was unusual for both of them, getting to just relax. They decided to end the day with dinner, nothing fancy. They picked up some food and headed back to the motel to eat with Dean and Castiel.
Gabriel sat up just a bit, laying his head on Sam’s chest. “Anything you want to do today?”
Dean nods. “Just... just... let me see what I can do.”
Because they might not know what the fuck happened to Castiel, but considering how it ended...
“You could become a chef,” Cas says, and it’s more the content look on his features than the commentary that makes Dean graze him with a warm smile. “For just... us. Charlie, Alex, Cain, all of us. I...” But instead of completing the sentence, he shoves another, slightly more aggressive spoonful of stew into his mouth.
“Look at you,” Dean mumbles, “you are absolutely beautiful.” His own eyes escape to see the reflection of Cas’s wings.
, no, just… the bits of you entangled with your archangel buddy’s grace, being pulled here when he ended up here. Alas, you’re
“You’re flushed,” Cas comments with a sober, worried tone, as he stands up.
There never was anything
He shifts, moves his legs, tries to do damage control.
He might be only an observer, but among what he observes, are his own hands, painting sceneries, painting others’ fates, whether he likes it or not.
, notes from behind him.
Because Cas is one to talk. But instead of continuing the argument, Dean closes his eyes and rubs his forehead. “
Change of plans.
,” he says, with determination. “I could never hate any part of you.”
Cas knocked at his bedroom door gently, speaking in a quiet tone, as it was past midnight. He knew he was welcome in any case, but if Dean was sleeping, he didn't wish to disturb him. He didn't exactly get the chance to get a good night's sleep that often. The past couple of days had been unordinarily quiet and serene with no immediate worries. It was good – to get to take a break from everything that went bump in the night.
The Entity cocks his head. His grin fading, replaced by his eyes narrowing (still, far from how
this guy.
And he still has at least ten pages left. The library still has time to devour him.
Dean waves a hand. “
Cas remains silent. Three times, now, Dean Winchester has visited the library. Three.
“That... I...” He ends up nodding. Staring, not yet daring to believe it.
“I’m coming back for you. I’ll see you tomorrow. OK? Tomorrow.” Cas can nearly hear the real intention behind what Dean is saying.
Cas doesn’t blink, but rolls his eyes slightly as a response. “I know prolonged eye-contact can make you uncomfortable but I’m not taking unnecessary risks. It’s my job, right now, to, yes,
He stills under Dean's touch, tense, blinking his eyes open to gaze up at him, trying not to look too scared, too wide-eyed. Apparently he fails; Dean withdraws his hold just a bit too fast for it not to make Cas wince in regret.
“You’re a romantic sap.”
Some days, Cas feels like he’s moving in slow motion. And some days, that can be a good feeling, too. Days of calm, spent with Dean, just the two of them. They are ticking to the same rhythm. Some days, Cas thinks he’s content, happy, just like this. Just pressing his body close to Dean’s, their arms around each other. Just breathing. Just being. The gentle forehead kisses, the reassuring touches to each other’s backs. The quiet smiles exchanged at breakfast, the feel of Dean’s hair against Cas’s palm.
“Yeah.”
on this; Dean gathers himself, just goes for it, suppresses his hesitation.
It never gets easier.
He bears it for a handful of minutes before giving up.
here,” the Entity falls back a few steps. “Not your
“Dean.” His tone more determined, this time.
With Cas’s hand around Dean’s cock, lips searching for lips, and the tie still secure around his wrists, Dean is exactly where he wants to be in the universe. Trapped in the safety of everything Cas is to him.
. “I’m not actually dead. I’m not actually here.”
It doesn’t feel familiar, the touch of the fabric tightening against his skin. This surprises Dean. He’s been restrained plenty, and he wouldn’t have thought it made a profound difference, the material. But it’s in Cas’s deliberate and gentle manners of wrapping the tie against Dean’s skin. It’s in the warmth of Cas’s skin against his, as he holds a wrist in place. And it’s in how Dean’s agreeing for this to be happening, probably; to think of it, he’s never not fought back, in situations like this, sans when he’s been unconscious. Even with a gun to his head, he knows the subtle ways of tensing his muscles so that there’s at least a chance of working his way free. Now? He keeps his arms relaxed, and the softness of the fabric and the gentleness of Cas’s hands direct his mind from the instinct of fight or flight. Cas is doing a commendable job, too, knowing his way around enough to effectively render Dean’s arms useless. He supposes he was the one who taught Cas things like that, years and years ago. He flexes his fingers, rolls his wrists about enough to both get a sense of being unable to free himself, and how no amount of straining actually as much as slightly scrapes his skin. Instinctively, he checks if he can find the ends of the tie, for a chance of loosen the knots on his own, despite knowing he doesn’t need to be doing that.
Cas, up on the cross, even as he grips his hair, on his knees, still on the unforgiving floor of the church, pulls onto his hair violently to force the image away, only it refuses to leave. He keeps seeing Cas, even though Charlie and Cain and Jody and Bobby are all there, and the cross is bare, save for the blood, Cain carrying the broken body of Dean’s everything towards safety, someone’s hand on Dean’s shoulder, he thinks Charlie’s, maybe, but all he can do is keep wailing, as he shoves her away. They’re making him walk out, too, and he only goes with them to be able to stay with Cas.
to Dean, but he keeps the remainders of his cool, holding Cas still as much as he manages while prepping him.
His prayer changing from
He knows. No real danger of losing Cas, by this point.
He has long since given up keeping a track of the time passing, but he thinks it might have been a little less than five months, since the last human entered the library.
“You’re doing beautifully,” Cas offers gently as he turns to face forwards again. And,
Dean repeats what he’s done with the first wing to the still free one. Slowly, slowly lays caresses on the structure, lips brushing against feathers, before starting to drape the rope among them. He has never been very artistic, but even as he wants to move along and
Dean shoots him yet another, oddly protective glare, that has him grow silent, again.
“I know--”
He looks so content, in this moment. Dean drinks in the sight, his hand returning to brush against the feathers, fascinated by the effect – he’s possibly never seen Castiel so relaxed – and taking the circumstances in consideration, his shame and disgust by the very part of him he’s now letting Dean touch freely being what gives him serenity like that... it’s very strange, and very beautiful.
“A little,” Dean replies, all the fight out of him as he curls himself into a ball under Cas’s clothes, under Cas’s arms.
Dean, as if knowing exactly what he’s thinking, continues, “Listen, don’t even worry about — I just figured...” He lifts his hand off of Cas’s forearm, retreats a little, still crouched to Cas’s level. “No stalkery intentions, just... there’s something that bothered me about this place. Call it a paranoid instinct. And now, whatever just happened...” His lips press against each other as his eyes wander around, as if assessing the safety of their surroundings.
“I...” Dean’s turn to ponder on whether to complete a sentence, or leave it. He huffs a sigh, averting his eyes. “I am done. With the job. I am... done, Cas. No more. Charlie’s got us both covered for the rest of our lives, and I can still be of use for her, just... in other ways.” No more murder. “...After we— after one last...” And this is why he’s keeping his eyes averted. It’s not that it’s news to Cas, that Dean wants to be the one to kill Naomi, if Charlie ever tracks her down. But he doesn’t like it. And they both know that, as well.
“No, that’s— quite all right.” He attempts to gather himself, sets the book aside, walks to the counter again, lifting a hand to his head, frowning to himself before facing Dean again. “You... uh.” What is he supposed to
, his brain offers, incoherently. Because how could it be? How hasn’t he
But before he has enough time to process through his confusion, his chest is contracting again. The chains are digging into his flesh, making him gasp and groan, and this time he is unable to keep his balance at the pull of his limbs, ending up sprawled on the floor, grasping for a hold of something, anything, to drag himself in compliance of the chains, to regain his ability to breathe. Once gulping in air again, he startles at a hand squeezing his forearm, wide eyes staring up at Dean.
is Castiel’s concern — he still can’t help but return the warmth, mirroring Dean’s smile as he glances down at the phone number on the paper.
. "Wasn't — your — fault."
“Cas—”
“And you are in a sex haze,” Cas points out with a low chuckle. “If you are going to clean us up, you are
Cas lets him guide himself so that he’s standing with his back towards the mirror hanging on the wall. “Hang on,” Dean mumbles, retrieves the one inside the wardrobe.
Even through the darkness, Dean can hear Castiel’s quick breaths. His own heart hammering. Smell the fight and the fear in the air. Feel the cold of the floor against his knees, even through his clothes, even as he finds himself tucked in on Cain’s sofa, with Charlie fussing over him, and his first woken thought is to snap at her for looking after him, when she should be looking after Cas, because obviously Cas needs her more, needs all of their attention and care, and what the hell was Dean doing unconscious, when Cas
. It’s tugging him
. But maybe if you had touched me… say, attacked me...” He shrugs, smiling. “Who knows, maybe I could’ve pulled you in, soul and all.”
“Anytime, Cas.” Dean strokes Cas’s cheek with his fingers. “If it made you feel any... better, then I’m glad. If not, at least... no complaints about some hot sex?”
,” Dean groans, taking a loose hold of Cas’s wrists as he presses his eyes shut for a second. Opens them again. The damage has already been done. “Yes, I meant it,” Dean said with a softer tone.
The human knew him well enough to be able to tell there was no way he’d actually

"Sorry," he mumbles, half-incoherently, at Cas, who is holding him securely in his arms, holding him even as Dean is trying to pull away. "Sorry, sorry, sorry..."
“No, I...” Castiel replies, a slight frown flashing across his brow before disappearing as the corner of his lips tugs upwards, slightly. “I would like that.”
Dean's voice is so
“You opposed to
“Then...” It’s starting to make a little bit of sense,
So he uses all of his willpower to keep repeating Cain and Charlie’s words in his thoughts. Adding his own, from all that time he has spent with the love of his life.
It’s that he seems to, honestly,
“Castiel,” he corrects, still staring, nearly dropping the book as he takes it from Dean’s hands.
“I just can’t think of anything else — I’ll hit the lore again, I’ll ask around, I will, I just... need more...” he trails off, glancing at Cas before covering his face with a tired hand. “I won’t give up on you.”
on anyone... except maybe Dean Winchester, considering. He’s too happy to hear that said out loud to make fun of it.
“Cas — what happened?” He keeps holding Cas’s eyes with his own, and something tugs at his very soul. “That didn’t look like — I don’t know what that looked like, but it’s not gonna freak me out, OK?” He’s still holding Cas by his forearm, thumb brushing reassuringly. “Look, this might be a long shot, but — if you think it’s something no one would believe. I would. I will.” He lowers his chin very slightly, emphasising the last four words with a seriousness.
If he’s in? He is all in.
of Dean’s heartbeat, he sets his eyes towards the horizon again, gazing at the waning sunlight. They’re good. A bit lost, maybe – literally and metaphorically – but
At least it’s just the two of them home. If Dean had to pick, he’d still rather it be Cas, present when he’s vulnerable, than Sam, or Jack, or Eileen. There’s less shame involved, less sense of responsibility, even, than with his younger brother or someone who at the end of the day is all of their, including Dean’s, kid. Cas isn’t someone Dean’s ever needed to be a parent figure to - Cas is a
Castiel is too taken aback to stop staring.
, most of the time, with Castiel. Sex, for him, Dean’s figured, is more about the build-up than the act. Dean’s learned to appreciate it; the restraint he’s learned from Cas, the prolonged moments of pleasure. Cas has adapted too – giving it to Dean rough and fast when that’s what he needs. Strangely, despite their problems when it comes to being on the same page outside of the bedroom, with sex, they naturally echo to a similar frequency. They communicate better.
, so he settles on giving Cas a grumpy look.
But then there come the days when Cas is slightly out of sync with the rest of the world. When something, any stupid damn thing (the noise of a coffee mug resting against a table a little too loudly, the doorbell, the black wings of a bird fluttering past the window, the touch of his lover’s digits resting against his nape at the wrong time), sends his brain to overdrive. They learn, with time. Cas learns not to be ashamed of his triggers, Dean learns not to feel guilty of them. But it doesn’t make them OK, even so.
“You can’t make it ‘right’, Dean,” Cas says, and his voice might be gentle, but the words are daggers at Dean’s abdomen. His hold of Cas tightens. Cas’s hands massage calming patterns at his back. “That doesn’t mean you can’t make me
He let his hand hover over the scarring for a moment before landing his touch there, light and gentle. He could feel Dean shiver, and he took a hold of the human’s waist again, settling himself on his back onto the bed, pulling Dean on top of him.
Dean gasps for breath in desperation, fights the firm hands holding him down, because
Castiel is still gazing intently at Dean, as the latter huffs a sigh, closes the book on his lap.
And he was enjoying this too much to stop now.
“Your heart is racing, Dean.”
"Dean. It's all right," Cas repeats in return, soothing, calm, steady. "It's all right, my love. This hurts you, as well. I'm not the only... You've gone through too much. You get to cry, too."
He doesn’t know if he hopes Cas is conscious or not.
of all the people, willingly lower himself on his knees in front of him as a sign of submission, only adds to the beauty of it.
Cas seems to hesitate for some time before he nods.
He pauses, still staring at the page on the poetry book, rather than looking at his husband.
Dean took in a breath, as if about to reply, but then just pressed his lips together, his eyes starting to wander, so Castiel, wanting him to look at him, took a hold of the human’s chin. “It doesn’t matter. I just... I am not fragile, Dean.”
. Would you?”
Maybe it’s that, the love, the bond they’ve shared for long enough for Dean to notice the slightest changes in his lover — but he can sense it in the air more than actually see it;
. Inferior. I’ve been in his
Castiel has very little control over falling asleep. When the victims' stories need to be written, he dreams. And what little control he might muster over trying to force himself to stay awake, he has no control over what happens in his dreams. He’s merely a vessel, through whom the stories flow, adding up to the shelves of books in the library.

a little tired.” Dean’s skin is so cold against his lips. Why hasn’t he said anything? Obviously the trenchcoat isn’t enough.
The invisible chains holding him captive have gotten several feet less lenient.
A ray of sunlight sneaks in from the crack of the front doors of the library opening; Castiel feels his heart lurch before picking up its pace in agitation and false hope —
“Dean. The eyes...” Opening them briefly as Dean pulled away. They studied each other for a while, then the human nodded, and Cas closed his eyes again before nodding back at him.
“Dean.” His name, just his name, but in it a promise. The familiar voice instantly prompts Dean to stop struggling the hands holding him and open his eyes.
“Hm, yeah thanks. Are you my protector now?”
“Hm yeah must have,” Dean’s face looked like a tomato at this point.
--------------
The guy chuckled, “Yeah I did, creepy.” He looked around making sure no one was gonna jump for a minute, although he was sure he probably would not see anyone even if they were there. “I’m Dean, do you want to go through the rest of this together?” He smiled half-assed, that's as much as he could do while waiting to get attacked.
------
“Yeah I guess we have to.”
“Um, I don’t know. Sorry.” Castiel looked away, he really was not registering Dean’s smirk.
------
“Yeah Cas, okay.” He paused, “Cas why does it have to be like this, why is my dad like this? I just want to be gone, but even then I can’t leave Sam. He deserves better than dad, he does. I wish I could just blink my eyes and be somewhere else.” Dean was starting to tear up, still processing what had happened.
“But you do Dean.” Cas shrugged, “You really do.”
Cas’ best-friend Charlie is trying her best to convince him to go do something fun. “Not everything HAS to be for couples, go do it yourself. Take yourself on a date, go to a haunted house!” She had on her convincing smile the one she always uses to get him to do things. The you-should-and-you-will-smile.
“Damn that was something.”
“Yeah Dean, very boring. I’m doing homework for trig, I don’t have a lot today though.” Cas was spread out on the ledge of a walkway, he looked up and showed Dean the math homework he was doing.
“Nope just really cute,” Dean very obviously looked him up and down. Cas was still in boxers and an acdc shirt Dean gave him last night. “I wanna see you in my shirts more often, how’d you sleep?’
He stayed outside, he couldn’t hear much but brief yelling. He heard something about Dean being ‘impure,’ John said that the ‘devil was inside him, and he is going to hell.’ All the classic homophobic things John could think of to say.
“Let them eat, Dean.” Cas was used to it by now but it was already getting worse with Sam and Gabriel.
Dean answered, “Yeah sure Cas, what is it?”
“Hey Sammy, how’s your day going?”
“Yeah Dean, you almost died. I was scared for you, really.” He smirked so big, he loved messing with Dean already.
“I like you Dean, like romantically. I’ve liked you for years.” Castiel was staring deep into Dean’s green eyes, perfect eyes.
Dean’s breath stalled for a moment, “Damn.” It seemed stupid to him but that’s all he could say for a few minutes.
Once Castiel got up Dean was already halfway done with breakfast, which was eggs, and greasy bacon.
Dean opened up the door to his apartment, gave Cas a little tour. He set Castiel up in his room, grabbed a blanket and almost left. “You know you could sleep in your own bed, I don’t mind. I’m not really that drunk just come lay down, we’re only sleeping.” Castiel was about half passed out at this point so his speech was kind of muffled.
“Can we talk in private?”
They kept walking and all it took was one more jump scare, this time it wasn’t a real person. They both jumped back, Cas held on to Dean. He grabbed his hand and they kept going, now halfway through.
-----------
Castiel grabbed his phone, drafted a message and showed it to Dean. Once Dean okayed the message Cas sent it. Sam would always be the first person Dean checked on and Castiel would always think it was great.
“Yup, I’m ready. Lets go.”
“Dean-- Dean are you okay?” Castiel knew it was a stupid thing to ask, especially when he looked the way he did. “Shit Dean.”
Dean always called Sam during free period, it’s easier than trying to find Sam in the hall. He had five minutes and used it to talk to Sam before he had to walk into class.
Dean looked down at Cas and nodded towards the door. Castiel got the message and he left, shutting the door behind him.
Dean laughed a little, then Sam took the opportunity to bring something up. "Hey Dean, if I heard correctly you said you would hug whoever thought of the alcohol. And as you now know that was Cas' idea." Sam smirked and moved out of the way to not get hit by Dean.
“Lets go.” Cas smiled, he started to think Charlie was right and that pissed him off.
“I hate to cut this short, y'know talking about me being cute and all. We have a topic to get back to though, nicknames. I know you've got one, just tell me. I will make you melt again.”
They also went with Charlie and her girlfriend to a haunted corn maze. They made it almost all of the way through before letting Charlie and her girlfriend walk ahead so Dean and Cas could make out.
Sam thought it was funny when Dean got so drunk, he would become really polite and happy. But he also knew Dean couldn’t keep his words back, and Dean has a major crush on Castiel. Dean with no filter, plus Dean crushing on Castiel, equals confessions.
“If you want me to, do you?” Cas stared at Dean the way that he does, the way that makes Dean melt. The angelic blue eyes almost directly looking into Dean’s soul.
Gabriel looked completely shocked, “Hold on, did Dean Winchester just say sorry.”
Dean had the dorkiest smile on his face, “Sorry, I’ll stop.”
“I like you too Cas,” he moved a little closer to Castiel. “Can I kiss you?”
Dean filled both their plates and sat down, “Yeah Ellen doesn’t mind, I can drop you off later to get it. How bad do you think Charlie’s going to be, coming home the day after and all?”
Cas would hate to admit it but he owes Charlie now, a lot.
“You serious, like actually?” There was hope, he had hope and the same dorky smile Dean had.
They made their way over to a bench and looked out at the ocean, the boats too. “I don’t know about you but this might be the calmest day I’ve had in awhile.” Sam looked down slightly, at least he wasn’t too much taller than him.
“Um Cas.”
“Yeah that’s fair, she was right. Wanna crash at my place then?” Dean was not so secretly hopeful, he was also trying his best to be a gentleman. He knew he’d take the couch and make breakfast, he liked Castiel a lot and it showed.
“So, what? I think we should do this more often.” He laughed a little looking directly at Gabriel, shifting his gaze from his eyes to his lips and back.
“Can’t that just count?”
“Calm down there huckleberry,” Cas smirked. He leaned in and held Dean’s face with his hand, Dean was looking straight down at his plate. “Hey, are you okay? Don’t be nervous, look at me.” Dean looked up with his face still red, they both knew Cas staring into his eyes would work for everything. Cas kissed him and they both forgot about the world for a minute. When Cas pulled away Dean’s face wasn’t red anymore and he had the biggest, dorkiest grin.
The last of the Halloween fun was the couples costume. Dean’s pick of course was something dorky. Castiel had no idea what his costume was but Dean loved it so he didn’t bother to ask.
“I guess I am, thanks though.” He gave a smile then walked back towards Dean. “So what do you think, you want to get out of here, maybe go get a burger?”
“Damn Cas.”
"Fine, whatever Sammy. Bring it in Cas." He held open his arms, for Cas to hug him. Castiel hadn't hugged many people, so he was squeezing Dean a little too tight. "Woah there cowboy," he pushed Cas away to get out of his tight grip. Dean turned to the group of people, "Let's get this party started!!" He smacked Cas on the back, "Let's get you a drink!"
“Just a little bit, that looks great though.” He sat down fully ready to devour some breakfast. “My car is still at the Roadhouse.”
Dean looked down at Cas, “We could go back to my house and eat, over thirty minutes left this period.”
--------------
“Why are you always so polite Cas?” Dean looked over with the dorkiest smirk on his face.
“Gabe?” Sam asked, grabbing his shirt and throwing in on. “What’s wrong?” he crouched in front of Gabriel.
“Yeah that sounds good Cas. Where are you thinking?”
Cas stopped shoving his face, “So you're going to tell your brother about me.” He had the widest smirk Dean had ever seen.
“Yeah that sounds good, I might need you to drive me after though.”
A few hours after their conversation Cas was driving to a haunted house he looked up. Five stars, should be fun. When he arrived there were maybe four cars, one caught his eye. He saw a 67 chevy impala, Cas loves old cars.
“Oh I forgot, I’m sorry.” Cas sat down next to Dean, all he wished is that he could protect him.
Sam was stuck for a second, “I thought angels couldn’t feel things, have feelings in general.”
--------------
-------------
“Thanks,” Cas tried to smile back no matter how nervous he is. He turned toward the place and headed in.
“Well obviously.”
“Yeah,” Cas had a feeling Dean was going to be around a while and he was glad. Shit now he has to thank Charlie, but he didn’t mind this time. Dean was worth Charlie being right just this one time.
When Cas and Dean talked, Dean always had Cas’ full attention. Even when they would walk in the hall bumping into people, Cas never paid attention to anything but Dean. “We only have another year, perks of being juniors.” He smiled, Cas was always trying to make sure Dean had a good day. “Come on, it won’t be that bad. We don’t have a test today or anything else that would make you suffer. It’s forty-five minutes, you will survive.”
Dean stood up and walked over towards Sam, “You guys got me presents too? Aw I love you guys!” He heard a few laughs in the crowd of people, but not many because most people had already seen Dean this drunk.
“Yeah he has manners, that’s what Cas does to him.” Sam added, trying his best to piss Dean off.
Dean had not realized the decorations until now, blue streamers and blue balloons. Both the color of Cas' eyes, almost perfectly. Not that he payed attention to Cas' extremely blue eyes...
Sam chuckled a bit, "No I can tell they both like each other. For years they have just been drooling over one and other, neither have gotten the courage to admit it." He smiled down at Mary, thinking it was funny that she had realized already.
Once Dean and Cas had walked over towards the alcohol, Mary walked towards Sam. She looked up at Sam and then back at Cas and Dean, she whisper "Are they dating? I never thought to ask, but they look like more than friends."
------------
“Okay I’ll remember that then.” Castiel was blushing even more than Dean, their eyes were locked on each other.
Sam tried to catch his gaze, almost succeeding. “Hey, can you look at me? Please?” He barely got Gabriel to look at him, finally. “Now, can you tell me what’s going on?”
The desks in the room were set up in twos, facing the board. “Board says we have a paper to fill out today and a computer activity. You normally have no trouble staying awake for that and we are in partners.”
“Okay Dean,” they kept walking with Cas in front. Dean said he’d protect Castiel but Cas protected him. He wouldn’t admit it either but he only lets a few people call him Cas, apparently Dean is one now.
“Yeah and maybe you’ll meet him sometime. Y’know if you like me that much.”
Dean couldn’t say anything, if he did he would start crying. Dean really didn’t want to cry in front of Cas if he didn’t have to. He just nodded, trying not to look directly at Castiel.
“What shut up, I do not.”
--------------
Sam went to the kitchen to grab a knife, and brought Cas with him. He waited until he was alone with Castiel, “Are you going to tell him?” Sam smiled a bit as he grabbed a knife and the bags of plastic forks.
“Okay Cas, can we sit?”
Cas took a breath, “I don’t know if I want to go back to my apartment tonight. Charlie’s going to be all smug because I got back late. She was right so i’m screwed.”
“Are you sure?” Castiel was leaning up a bit, maybe he didn’t mind the idea of finding someone or enjoying his own company.
-----
It took him a second, everything hurt. Dean was sore, his head the most. His stomach was almost worse, Dean was sure he had broken a rib. John had him on the floor, kicking him, spitting on him, calling him every name in the book. Dean went through hell, he just needed Cas.
“The nickname is huckleberry. I know it’s lame but there's a backstory, I’m not willing to tell the backstory.”
“I think we would get along, she seems like half of my friends. She seems like my brother too, I know what he’ll say when I tell him I had you over.”
“It’s okay, take your time.” Sam tried for a small smile.
“No, a lot of people come alone. You get to meet people. I can’t count how many times people go in alone and come out holding someone's hand, it gets scary in there.” She chuckled and gave him a nice smile, “Goodluck don’t be nervous!”
“Okay huckleberry I won’t make you.” Cas winked, and leaned back “This is fun.”
Dean's eyes almost immediately lit up, he had a huge smile on his face. "Who's idea was that? Because I swear I will hug them."
Dean cleared his throat, “Yeah, yeah i’m fine Cas.”
He smirked, “Wow so you're smart-smart Cas, you want to give me some of that knowledge.”
“Wow it’s that bad?” He laughed, Dean’s been told he snores loud but damn he didn’t know it was that bad. “Well then I’m glad I look cute when I sleep at least. Breakfast, eggs and bacon?” He held out the pan, “greasy bacon in case you're hungover.”
It was a little while later, Dean and Castiel had left. Gabriel started waking up, his eyes opened and he smiled. “Hey, good morning.”
‘Oh shit Cas, he did it. I can do it, I got this, just tell him.’
-----
Castiel relaxed a little at that, “Thank you, Dean.” His eyes traced Dean’s face over every freckle and eventually landed on his eyes.
Once the song was over Dean reached over to blow out the candles, he thought of a wish.
Castiel does not like halloween or autumn really, he calls them “couple traps.” The reasoning behind the nickname is that his last boyfriend broke up with him on halloween. He says that autumn is built for couples, pumpkin picking, pumpkin carving, apple picking, baking, and haunted things. Last year he was all by himself and now this year too, but there’s still time.
Castiel is Dean’s best friend, he always made Dean smile when he was ‘dying from knowledge.’ Cas caught up to Dean in the hallway, “Hello Dean. Are you ready to die in class like you always do, or are you not as tired today?”
He was still confused, “I- no, I’m not ob-”
“Thanks Cas,” Dean laughed a little. The first time he had since what happened, it hurt a little but he didn’t care. He turned his head slightly towards Cas with blue eyes staring back.
“Hm can’t think of one, too bad I guess I don’t get a nickname. It really sucks.” Dean smirked even though he knew Castiel would fight against that. He can only think of one nickname, a really dorky one, ‘Huckleberry.’ He’s not gonna say that though, Cas will definitely roll with it.
“Dean what are you talking about, it’s not your fault. You didn’t do anything wrong, this is John’s fault. All you did was kiss me, that’s not wrong. I’m the one who’s sorry, you shouldn’t have to deal with a dad like that.” Cas sighed, “Dean can you look at me, please?”
“It’s okay Cas, not your fault. He’s at work and we aren’t going to be here for long.” He handed Cas the chips he had just opened, “Want some?”
“Do you want to stay with me tonight, please? I can’t leave you like this, even if you want me to.”
“Yeah of course,” Castiel helped Dean sit down. He took Dean’s jacket and put it behind them folded on the ground, to use as a pillow. Cas took off his jacket and laid down with Dean, using his jacket as a blanket.
Dean nodded and followed Castiel to the kitchen, “So what’s up Cas?” Immediately Dean got nervous, he started looking down and fiddling with his hands.
“Cas I, I’m sorry. You shouldn’t have had to be there for that.” Dean was staring hard at the ground.
“No it can’t count Dean.”
Castiel heard parts of the conversation, he tried not to pay too much attention to it. He always tried his best to let Dean talk to Sam in private, he knew that was the most important thing to Dean. Castiel thought it was cute and all together caring, Dean’s soft spot.
“So couple trap season is what I call autumn, and all things related. Things like pumpkin picking, pumpkin carving, apple picking, baking, and all haunted things. It’s designed for couples, plus my last boyfriend broke up with me on Halloween.” He tried not to make it seem depressing but it totally went that way.
Dean looked up shyly, “Yeah I’m fine Cas.” He lied a little on that one, Dean was nervous. He was pretty sure John wouldn’t come back, but he wasn’t positive. After a fight they had a week ago Dean was probably pushing it bringing Cas over.
“Dean.”
She knew Cas was just being like that because she was right. “Yes, you can call me and tell me all about how horrible it was. It’s a deal.”
“I don’t know, won’t that seem kind of weird? A grown man going to a haunted house by himself, weird.” Castiel was pushing back as hard as possible, he really just wanted to do nothing. Just be lonely and bored during couple trap season.
“Yeah same, we aren’t even halfway through yet. You ready?” Dean tried to sound encouraging but damn he was scared.
“This isn’t either Dean just come lay down.” He moved the blanket up long enough for Dean to lay down, “Go to sleep.”
Dean even convinced Castiel to make pumpkin pie, which was pretty cute. Cas got a bunch of flour on his shirt so he took it off and wore Dean’s apron. That was Dean’s favorite part, besides the pie of course.
A few hours later they were out sightseeing. Just walking around and talking, enjoying each other's presence. Dean and Castiel were out on a hunt, probably being very couple-y without Sam there. Sam had already texted to make sure they were cool without him. He got a sarcastic response about how they didn’t need him to hunt a vamp nest.
“I’m Castiel and uh yeah sure, i’m scared enough already.”
“Okay, just checking Dean.”
“C’mon let’s get away from here.”
“I slept great, you snore really loud by the way.” He smirked because he couldn’t get across the full point that he snores way more than just really loud. “I thought I was gonna smother you, but you look cute when you sleep so I couldn’t.”
“Okay Dean,” Cas was waiting patiently he was trying to give Dean some time. “You will be okay, but you don’t have to act tough.” He looked over Dean’s face at his busted lip, his bloody forehead, and black eye. “You look rough.”
“What?”
“Dammit Cas I do not. I’m gonna need proof on that one.”
“Really Cassy, right now?”
Sam was the first to say anything, “What did you wish for Dean?” He smirked a little because he really hoped Dean wished something about Castiel.
Dean chuckled a little at the confusion on Cas’ face, “Nothing bad Cas. Your eyes are just so damn blue.”
"It was Cas' idea so just enjoy the party, there is plenty of alcohol."
“Ok fine, i’ll go tonight. I’ll call you after and tell you if I absolutely hated it, or if it was somewhat okay.” Even though that was snarky, he meant it sort of as a joke.
They all laughed a little, Cas didn’t seem as amused though.
It was the morning after the love confession that was last night. Dean was back, he and Cas were eating breakfast. Gabriel and Sam had fallen asleep talking on Sam’s bed. Sam had his back turned to Dean and Cas, he was awake and watching Gabriel sleep. It was weird he thought, their two favorite angels were human and they hadn’t even known.
All that he needed Sam just gave him. The little words that could calm down even a broken angel like him. “Okay,” he cleared his throat, “Okay, so. I’ve been thinking a lot, about everything, about you. I wrote things down and I said them out loud, thinking it might help me figure it out. But,” He paused, Sam looked up at him with his puppy dog eyes and made it that much easier. “I think, well… I think I might love you. I know it might sound weird and I don’t want to freak you out. I didn’t really know how to tell you.”
Dean started walking with Castiel right next to him. They only made it less than a minute before something jumped out. “Son of a bitch,” he grabbed Cas “um sorry.”
Right then Dean almost died, he melted. He tries to pretend he's all tough, but damn the right person could make him speechless.
“Yeah I know, it would be boring if I wasn’t.”
They were in a field Dean recognized, it was an hour away from Dean’s house. They had their first date in the field, a picnic. Far away from John, and anyone else who could hurt him.
“Yeah I think so, might eat though.” Dean walked a few feet away so Cas could do his work in mostly silence.
Castiel put his arm up pointing at a cluster of stars, “That one there is ursa major.” Cas looked over again, checking to see if Dean was looking. “See it?”
There wasn’t a line, only a person at the ticket booth. Castiel was a little nervous, he doesn't like doing things by himself. “Are there a lot of people that come alone,” he started biting his lip “is it weird?”
“Okay so what’s the nickname dork?”
“Of course, my protector.” He laughed, “No but serious I will.”
Sam got up from the floor and moved next to Gabriel on his bed. Sam was still in his towel, but neither one seemed to care. He went to pull him back in, again. They didn’t quite make it though. They heard the door open and pulled back, glancing in that direction.
Dean tried to keep in a laugh, “Maybe I'm not really sure, I’ll protect you.” He smirked, Dean doesn’t flirt with strangers often.
After class they had a free period. Castiel would normally study and Dean would check on his little brother Sammy. “Same today?” Cas asked.
“No Cas, don’t say sorry.” Dean put his hand on the side of Cas’ face, “I think it’s cute.”
“Aw yeah, my little brother Sam fell and banged himself up three times a day until he started high school.”
“No,” Liam responds, but he’s already smiling bigger.
Castiel’s smile flashes quickly, and Dean knows they’re both on the same page. “Would you like to sit and rest first? I saw how hard you were working out there. You took my breath away all over again.”
Knowing this is the best offer of friendship he’s had in months makes it hard to turn them down altogether. “I’ll think about it.”
“The goods!?” Castiel repeats, scandalized. “We’ve barely known each other for three days, Dean. If word got out that we were together and down to our underwear already—”
“Do you wanna play dinosaurs with me?” Liam asks, popping his head up over the back of the couch.
“Did Castiel know he was agreeing to marry a man?” Sam asks next.
Liam’s eyes flick to the screen, then back to him. “Can we go to daycare now?”
this thing between them is going to be special.
Dean’s type.”
“You know, a ‘nola bar?” Seeing that he’s clearly not getting it, Liam explains, “With um, chocolate chips or—or—the crumbly stuff on top? It’s a—a—a rectangle?”
Castiel murmurs into his ear, “Maybe you’re drunk on me.”
“Oh fuck, just do it,” Dean begs, tilting his head back onto Castiel’s shoulder.
Castiel thinks.
For some reason, that feels like a kick to the nuts, and he has to drop his gaze so that Cas doesn’t see his reaction. How has it only been ten days? Logically, he guesses he knows that Cas hasn’t been in his life all that long, but when they’re together it feels like they’ve been friends for years, like they’ve been hanging out for as long as he can remember, like it was always like this.
“How do you know?” Liam asks.
“You are such a nerd, doc,” Dean says fondly.
With Dean’s blush already deepening while he huffs, Cas isn’t surprised to see Dean turn to look out the window. “Shuddup. And you deserve nice things, Cas. I’m gonna give you as many as you’ll let me.”
Cas, I’m so sorry. I shouldn’t—”
“You should shower while you can,” Dean says. “I’ll get us some snacks and water to stock up for the night so you don’t get dehydrated, make sure dinner’s put away and everything’s all locked up.”
He pulls a rasping breath from Cas, and the hands that haven’t moved from his ass for the past god knows how long now drift up just enough to slip beneath the waistband of his pajamas and push them down. Dean leaves wet, open-mouthed kisses to Cas’s neck at the same time he lifts his hips in invitation, moaning quietly when he feels his cock spring free. He looks down between them when he feels Cas shift around, and watches raptly while Cas pushes his own pants down. Dean lowers himself again purposefully, carefully lining them up until he feels the hot length of his husband’s cock pressed closely against his. The first dry drag of their cocks together has sparks shooting up his spine and a sharp exhale leaving his mouth. Cas reels him in by the side of his face and captures his lips in a deeply passionate kiss, and they go right back to rutting together like a couple of horny teenagers.
Castiel is so far beyond words at his point he can’t even answer to tell her they don't do
“Right after you pick up your blocks,” Cas tells Liam, and Dean takes the chance to duck into the bathroom.
Dean isn’t sure what to say to that, so he turns his attention to his food and starts making his way through it. Jo brings Cas out his meal and the two of them eat in a slightly uncomfortable silence until their plates are cleared. Only after Cas has wiped the crumbs from his scruff does Cas say, “Not the same kind of energy we used to have when we came here, huh?”
“Did you cry?” Cas asks, shooting him a knowing smile.
Privately, Castiel brings up 'Lock and Key,' but Dean shakes his head, telling him he doesn’t want to sell that song because it’s
Dean turns to Cas and hits him with a sideways smile. “Nailed it.”
“Yep.”
“Just for tonight... can I hold you? Or let you hold me?”
And his wonderful, amazing, truly spectacular daughter doesn’t make a peep.
Freeing Dean’s lips means he hears a cacophony of sounds spilling from above him, sizzling in the air between them like sparks and sinking into his skin like tiny brands all over his body.
Before Dean can start to sputter out some kind of explanation (besides the truth) for why he’s barely been able to string more than two words together since they kissed, Cas pulls out and begins thrusting shallowly. He starts slow, only moving the slightest bit, gently but deliberately increasing his pace with every thrust. By the time Cas is moving seamlessly inside of him, he’s settled into a languid rhythm that has the two of them rocking together like they’ve been doing this for years. One of Cas’s hands is on his ass, switching between rubbing his skin in time with his thrusts and fingers digging into his flesh, and Dean presses and arches into every touch.
Dean looks down at the table, feeling his face heat. He knew Cas was still following him on social media, and he hoped that Cas would see the pictures of the sunset, the stars, and the moon he would post every summer when he was thinking about their first kiss, their first date at prom that was never supposed to be a date but turned into one anyway, and their first time. But he never thought he’d come back here with half a face and be half the man he wanted to be in order to win Cas back.
Dean curses so quietly he barely hears the broken,
“We do kiss on the lips sometimes,” Cas answers.
“Will you humor me for a moment?” Castiel asks. His voice must be
“You push me over, kiss me, then cuddle me?” Cas asks, sounding amused.
Before he can complain, Cas’s finger is circling his hole, stimulating the sensitive skin in a way that has him remembering exactly why he liked this so much the last time. Cas watches his face with an intense gaze, making Dean blush as he twitches and groans while Cas slips his finger over and around his opening. Cas dips just the tip of one finger inside before withdrawing and beginning to circle again. He does it once more, rubbing around and around his anus until it’s sloppy wet and Dean’s writhing beneath him, and then just barely slipping inside before he pulls away.
Though he has no memory of actually deciding to do it, he finds himself tracing the shape of Dean’s face with his fingers, running his finger tips over the freckles under Dean’s eyes and the bridge of his nose. Because Dean only looks back at him with a soft look in his eyes and a slightly more pronounced blush on his cheeks, he also brushes his fingers over Dean’s eyebrows, down his jaw, and across his lips. They’re too tempting to resist once he feels them beneath his finger tips, so it’s him who initiates their next kiss, finding himself no less awed at how beautifully their lips align now than he was at any point last night.
They undress each other slowly, taking the time to sample each inch of newly uncovered skin with exploring hands that learn, memorize, and exploit as they continue. Their lips come together as often as possible for long, passionate kisses that soothe his soul and pulse arousal through him while Cas gradually opens him up, one tortuously patient finger at a time.
(See the end of the chapter for
There’s something in the glint of her eye that makes Castiel feel as if she knows
Alright, if that’s how it is, two can play at this game. “Remember that time Sam had to go to the hospital because you tried out a new position and broke his—”
much, but he also hasn’t had this much to drink in ages, and based on Sam, Jess, and Cas all wobbling around him, he’s guessing he isn’t alone.
He knows Cas has caught his second wind some time later when he surges up and pushes him back onto the mattress with one hand on Dean’s shoulder so he can dominate his mouth. It’s a fiery kiss that has his fingers digging into Cas’s firm shoulder blade as he tries to hold on for dear life while Cas takes him apart one kiss at a time. Cas kisses him for so long his lips start to burn, but still, Cas is so fucking good at it, changing it up from hot and heavy to soft and gentle often enough that it never stops feeling new and exciting. By the time Cas drags his mouth down to his neck and starts claiming every little spot that makes Dean’s breath hitch with a love bite, he could definitely be persuaded into a second round, and when Cas kisses down his chest to suck his nipple into his mouth, he’s officially hard again.
chuckle at that, and he’s pretty damn pleased with himself knowing that Cas thinks he’s funny. It’s not like he laughs at his jokes or anything, so this is the first he’s heard of it. His head turns in surprise when Cas pulls open the passenger door. For some reason he’d been expecting him to get in the back as usual, but it makes sense for him to ride shotgun considering Sam isn’t here. They both have to take off their hats to fit in the car, and Dean’s eyes take in the crazy haphazard mop of dark hair on Cas’s head. It’s not styled the way he usually has it these days, and it kind of reminds him of when they first met and Cas’s hair had been all over the damn place. That’d been
No - wait. He actually can’t breathe.
“That almost sounds like an offer,” Dean replies.
“Jesus Christ,” Dean says breathlessly, and then the head of his cock is parting Castiel’s cheeks in seconds. Dean spreads him open with one hand as he sinks inside, and Castiel grits his teeth through the slight burn as Dean pushes into his unprepped hole. “Takin’ it so good,
With Cas now moving on his own, Dean lets his eyes skirt up the shape of Cas’s body to drink in the sight of his gorgeous face. And god, is he pretty when he’s turned on with his cheeks tinged rosy pink, his teeth sunk into his lower lip, and his eyes heavily lidded. Their eyes hold a heated gaze for several seconds before he breaks it, cups Cas’s face in his hands and pulls him down to meet his lips. He sucks Cas’s bottom lip into his mouth, soothing the teeth marks with a swish of his tongue that meets Cas’s when it joins the party, and he gladly slides their tongues together in a drawn-out but still scalding hot kiss.
“Hello to you, too,” Dean says, amused by her grumpiness. “You got big since the last time I saw you. You’re like a whole new baby.” She squawks again, so he says, “Somebody’s not a morning person, huh?” She settles down a little bit as he gets her more comfortably into his arms, but he swears she has an annoyed little pinch between her eyebrows when she opens her eyes. “I know the feeling. Too bad you can’t have coffee to help wake you up like me.” She makes another unhappy little squawk, and he chuckles again. “Alright, let’s go see if your dad is ready to feed you your bottle.”
“I have to say, I’m shocked by this wildly unpredictable turn of events,” Cas deadpans. “Especially after you spent every minute after your second glass of wine hanging off of me in front of your entire family.”
“That gonna be a problem for you?” Dean asks him.
“With my car,” Dean answers, then stops pacing as that sinks in. He smiles over at Jo, who’s smiling back knowingly. “Thanks, Jo. I’ll be back—”
Castiel sits up straighter in the armchair he has been lounging in. “That’s the third time today I’ve lost you mid-conversation. I sincerely hope you’re not about to tell me that you’re getting bored of me already.”
Sam laughs and turns to the both of them, signing as he speaks. “She’s got a point. I’ve bunked with buddies before and it wasn’t weird. Hell, you and me have shared a bed more times than I can count.”
“Think you better get your ears cleaned out, old man, ‘cause that is so
doesn’t leap with excitement when he hears a knock on the door. He’s not expecting any deliveries and he certainly isn’t expecting company, and as unlikely as it is, he’s pretty sure the only person who would come over to visit is Dean.
“That’s not the point,” Cas says sternly, his already low voice harder than usual as he scolds him.
Dean is Sam’s brother?
“Explains the bowling ball arms that were wrapped around me a minute ago.”
he must have heard him singing “Simple Man” on Wednesday.
“Got a couple of condoms in the trash here. Castiel has been back since Sunday? Handsome young fellas like you, gotta say, I expected to see more.”
“Do you wanna go? On Saturday?”
Dean keeps fingering him until his ass feels open and sloppy, and it’s only after several long minutes of his increasingly persistent reassurance of, “Dean, I’m ready. I’m prepped, I’m ready.
“You might be surprised,” Cas tells him. “Sam’s been so overly supportive trying to get me to start dating again that he might be more comfortable with gay culture than I am at this point.”
“Can I take your jacket?” he asks instead.
Dude, no. It was all me.
Dean’s eyebrows almost hit the roof, but he looks almost impressed. “You little horndog.”
that Castiel could weep just looking at him. “Gotta say, there was no part of me that thought I’d be standing here like this a week after our first date.”
Dean nods as relief continues washing over him. It’s a huge weight off his shoulders to know he doesn’t have to try to get along with Cas’s ex, but at the same time... now he has to try to get along with a cat. From what little he knows about cats, they bite and attack people for absolutely no reason, knock shit off of shelves just to be assholes, and generally ignore the humans who take care of them. Why anybody would want one is beyond him.
together.” When saying that much doesn’t make him feel stupid or needy, he keeps going and gets (almost) everything off of his chest. “I want to introduce you as my partner instead of my roommate, and I want you to stay in my bed as often as you want to.”
Like the last two times he’s come in, Liam doesn’t look at them, but he does respond, “Good.”
“Would you like that?”
“I have no idea,” he says honestly.
Dean’s almost as tall as he is - probably will be taller than him when he’s done growing - but his body’s smaller. His hips are soft and curvy, and his frame is slight, though still large for an omega. Cas feels his eyes roll up into his head when Dean presses even closer and their erections slot together.
Cas’s forehead droops to rest against his temple, his breath coming out every bit as harsh and ragged as his own. Cas’s big hand is stroking the back of his neck, teasing through the short hair there while he nuzzles into his cheek. He fucking
He can’t even begin to convince himself that didn’t come out sounding like a greedy, desperate little whine, but he can’t find it in him to be ashamed, either.
There’s only one other person in the store when they walk in, but Gabriel doesn’t hold back when he gets a look at Dean for the first time in a month.
Dean says again, but he knows it’s a warning this time and the flame catches deep inside of him because of it, spreading faster and further with every powerful thrust.
“We just had some of the best sex of my life, I don’t have to worry about whether or not you’ll call after because I know I’m going to see you at Sam’s next week, and instead of sneaking out and being awkward about it now like every other hookup, we can clean up and watch the new season of Unsolved Mysteries instead.”
Hell, he still doesn’t if he’s into the person now, and he’s
he’s not here for that. He’s here to help Cas. He knows Cas has to sleep and for that to happen, Grace has to keep sleeping, but there’s a few things it looks like Cas could use some help with around the house, too, and Dean can’t do that with a baby in his arms—no matter how soft and warm and unfairly adorable she is when she sleeps. So it’s with no small amount of reluctance (and maybe a little trepidation) that he extracts himself from the couch and oh-so-gently places Grace in the baby swing.
Dean snorts a laugh. “Believe me, it’s new for me, too.”
“Yeah. That sounds like a plan.” He goes to walk away when Cas’s hand slips into his. He stops at the doorway so he can peek out and see Liam still dancing in front of the TV, then says to Cas, “I know it’s no accident that you’ve been extra sweet lately.”
Castiel turns to prop the bouquet up on top of his dresser, then turns back to Dean. “So what’s the special occasion? Do we have guests?”
"I'm gonna shake his damn hand."
Dean dips his head to align their lips for another long, soft kiss that makes Cas melt like butter on a hot day even though it’s cold as hell outside. “I think you’re gonna like the next surprise I have in store for you, then.” Dean punctuates that with a cheeky, shit-eating grin that makes Cas groan out loud.
Dean nods and sits back down where he was, absentmindedly thinking that Cas is every bit as nerdy now as he first thought he was five years ago before he blew his fucking mind in bed, but also taking care to keep his legs closer together so he doesn’t accidentally brush Cas’s when Cas sits in the seat right next to him.
“Please tell me she didn’t ask you about having more kids so she can have more grandkids,” Dean says, sounding pained.
“I did. For the—”
(See the end of the chapter for
To his surprise and Cas’s credit, he can
He’s surprised by the offer, but pleasantly so. Most of the friends he made in school moved away to pursue their own careers, so there aren’t many people left in town he’s friendly with. “Really?” he asks. “It wouldn’t be weird since I’m technically Jess’s boss?”
Cas looks awfully interested by this information. “Really?”
what else has been stuck in my head since I was in the shower this morning?”
“And I still forgive you. Please don’t spend all day beating yourself up over this.”
“And you have a king sized bed. What’s the big deal? You’re obviously not a homophobe,” she jokes.
“He probably turned right back around once he got there so he could come back as soon as possible,” Sam finishes. “Are you scared?”
All he can do is nod as his heart overflows in his chest, because that’s a first he wasn’t expecting. Somewhere along the way, they started telling Liam that they love him before bed, and every single time, Liam says, “Goodnight, Dean. Good night, Cas,” but Liam has never said that he loves them back. And now Liam just said it like it was no big deal when Dean feels like the whole world just narrowed down to the little boy currently speed walking through his bedroom, and he knows in that instant that he’d die for him if he had to. He’d kill to protect Liam, would give Liam the shirt off of his own back if it meant he was the tiniest bit warmer, would do absolutely anything and everything just to make sure he lives a long, happy life.
“Who’s gonna blow first, Chastity?” Meg asks.
“You know The King’s going to hit the roof when he comes back,” Bobby guesses.
They both watch while she walks over to press the lip of a glass to a tap, tilting it a little until it’s full. She places it in front of Castiel with a smile, shoots the man next to him a single raised eyebrow that makes the man’s cheeks turn a little pink, and then goes back to whatever she was doing.
he wouldn’t be surprised if there are little cartoon hearts floating around his head. Maybe because he’s concentrating so hard on not looking like an animated character, the first thing his brain fully latches onto is, “You talked to Charlie?”
And it’s the lingering scent of him on his pillow that helps him fall asleep, along with the knowledge that if they have any luck at all, this will be the last night he sleeps in this bed alone. Ever.
Cas’s eyebrows narrow. “I think I need this Charlie’s number.”
“Dean,” Cas whispers, dropping his arm from the back of the seat to wrap it around his shoulders. “She shouldn’t have treated you like that, even if she did just find her soulmate. Your worth doesn’t depend on being somebody’s soulmate, it comes from who you are, and you’re
“I don’t know,” Cas says quietly. “I don’t want you to think that because I’m holding you right now that I’m not still hurt and, well, angry with you,” he admits. “But Dean?” And Cas pulls away now, brushes his thumbs through the wetness beneath Dean’s eyes, which is when Dean realizes that he must have started crying at some point. “I want to work this out, okay? I’m not going anywhere, and I’m not breaking up with you. I’m still in this.”
The pressure is unbelievable, but once Cas pushes past the first tight ring of muscle, he sinks in the rest of the way easily, like Dean’s body was meant to do this, and the thought alone has him relaxing into it.
“Because I’m not sure Jess could’ve kept a straight face, and I wouldn’t want a customer laughed out of my store.”
“Maybe it’s time for a vacation,” Sam suggests. “It’s been years since you took any real time off. Might be starting to catch up to you.”
His attention is pulled away from Sam when Liam exclaims, “Dean! What’re ya’ doin?”
“Right over here,” Cas says. “Slowly.”
“Son of a bitch,” Dean complains, stopping right in front of the Impala and frowning at it.
Cas glances down at the clothes he’s wearing. “You don’t like the way I look?”
Dean nods his head in permission. He trusts Cas, easy as that.
“Jesus,” he says breathlessly, slumping forward against the wall so his legs don’t give out on him.
Nobody says anything for a while, and though it’s not as quiet in the emergency department as it would be at home in Liam’s room, Liam falls asleep as fast as he always does. Dean watches him with a pit in his stomach, wondering if he’ll ever be able to look at Liam unmoving with his eyes closed without remembering how it felt in the ambulance when he realized Liam lost consciousness.
He wrenches the door open and is ready to run into the living room to die trying to clobber his brother (and maybe Jo while he’s at it) when Cas says his name. The way Cas says it demands his attention, so Dean stops just long enough to look over his shoulder.
“They also have a princess looking to marry.”
“I apologize, Dean,” he says lowly. “I believe that was my first experience with jealousy, and it certainly wasn’t very becoming of me to treat somebody you care about in that fashion. When we’re done here, I’ll find Cain and apologize to him, as well.”
Immediately thinking of the events of the night before, Dean’s nervous and already blushing. “We, uh, didn’t really have time to clean up since we weren’t expecting you.”
It was easy enough to lose himself in the movie and the strange mix of comfort and simmering arousal he’d felt from Dean’s thigh slotted along his, and even the cautiously flirtatious banter in the Impala had done a good job of distracting him away from the real issue. But once he got home, he started spiraling.
“I’d like to, but it was hard enough finding a doctor to help a thirty-year-old unmated omega along the first time, so I don’t know if I’ll have much luck once I get older.”
Donna turns to him for his answer, and though his face is as red as it’s ever been, he replies, “Few times a week, yeah.”
Dean takes a step back with a grin, shaking his head a little to stomp out the urge to kiss him one more time. “I’d kiss you again, but I’m afraid if I do, I’m never gonna go back to work.”
“Cas should probably go first. You need to get home to David anyway, right?”
He circles his hips just to feel Dean hot and tight all around him, then he gives into the excruciating urge to push inside of Dean. He starts slow with small, half-aborted thrusts that feel good without a doubt but are more to get Dean used to the length and girth of him than anything. He continues moving in and out in a careful rhythm until Dean starts moving with him. Seconds later, Dean’s eagerly arching into his touch, wrapping himself around Castiel shamelessly, needily meeting each thrust with a roll of his tiny hips that seems to connect them more firmly, more completely with every one.
“That makes two of us. I don’t know if it’s because I’m so into you or what, but I’m pretty sure that was the best sex I’ve had in years.”
get that out of what I’ve said, that works for me.”
“Still un-freakin’-believable,” Dean admits. “Every single time, no matter who does what. I’m talkin’ like,
“You look pretty today,” he tells her.
“Cas,” Cas corrects her. “And yes, that’s where I went to school.”
having his body painted, Dean’ll let him do it without complaining (too much) because it turns out Dean loves him, too.
“Yeah, but you loaded it, too. I didn’t ask you to stay here to be my housekeeper.”
“We can’t fuck like this.”
“Still my favorite person either way.”
He’s on his feet before the music comes to a complete stop. For the first time since he’s met Dean, he follows his heart instead of his brain, and without overthinking every move he makes, he finds himself sitting directly next to Dean on the bench. He looks Dean in the eyes, seeing so much affection and hope inside of them that Castiel forgets absolutely everything else except for how strongly he feels for Dean. The next thing he knows, he's cupping his hand around the back of Dean’s neck and pulling him in until his mouth meets another for the first time in his life.
“Yep.”
He locks up as it rips through him, his cock kicking between them with the severity of his pleasure, his head thrown back with a low, throaty moan torn from his lips that fills the air.
“‘s probably just you,” Dean says, making Cas grin.
Jess cuts in quickly. “Point made. We can’t stay long, so let’s get down to business. Did you two talk suits before we got here or...?”
let Dean get up in the saddle and take him for a ride when he was 16.
him, and he’s not gonna let him go.
He feels like he was just stabbed in the heart with a dull knife. The pain is harrowing, spreading from his chest to his stomach and all the way to his toes in a single heartbeat, and now he can’t make words for an entirely different reason.
“And you’re certain you’re okay with Sam making this stand on your behalf?” Castiel checks. “Because I know how much he means to you, how much you love him, and just how much you were willing to sacrifice to make him happy. We need to be sure this is the best plan moving forward for all people involved, not just you and I.” Dean lets that sink in for a second, feeling unsure now that Cas has raised his doubts. “Do Sam and Jess want children? Will not having them be the same kind of sacrifice it would have been for you to marry a woman for him?”
Cas crouches down like Donna, and says, “Good morning, Liam.”
That’s when he hears it. From his left comes the lowest, filthiest moan he’s ever heard in his fucking life, and his eyes slip closed for just a second to concentrate better on the sexy tone of the guy’s voice. His thumb pulls down on his bottom lip, stretching it a little before he switches it up for his index finger to close his lips around it, and
There’s what feels like several very heavy seconds of silence after that, and although he’s too cowardly to look at Dean for his reaction, he imagines Dean’s looking at him like people looked at Steve Carell’s character in The 40-Year-Old Virgin. He knows it’s odd to be 29 without going on a date or having sex, but that’s his reality, and if Dean’s going to judge him or like him any less because of it, he’d rather know now than later.
“Probably just as well. Who’d lead anyway?” Dean quips, earning himself a twitch of Castiel’s lips and a smile that’s all in his eyes.
“Maybe I’m just lacking the proper motivation,” Dean flirts.
Dean can’t wrap his head around this. “You want me to marry Cas even though he’s a guy, and not tell dad until... what? We’re standing at the altar!?”
“She’s known you too long. She’s used to you,” Sam reminds him. “And fair warning, she
I suppose. Before I started touching you.”

“Sorry there’s no suspenders this time,” Cas quips.
Dean and Cas fuck a lot. Again. And, uh,
Dean considers lying for a second, then admits, “Reminded me exactly why I haven’t been able to get him outta my head for the last five years, that’s for damn sure.”
without sounding like a clingy, unhinged scorned lover? “I don’t... God, Cas—I can't lose you for real, okay?”
“Okie dokie,” she replies. Then, “You’re at work, yeah?”
“I choke down the beef and broccoli if I have to,” he admits.
and Dean hasn’t even touched him yet.
Ellen gives his shoulder a friendly squeeze. “Start with your mama,” she suggests. “I don’t know how she does it, but if anybody can get the king on your side, it’ll be her. Now stop your worrying and eat up.”
“I’m glad you think so,” Dean finally says. “But you ain’t seen nothin’ yet.”
Gabriel shakes his head, but Castiel says, “Tea would be welcome if it’s no trouble.”
his body locks up, and when Cas prods that same spot deep inside of him a second time and grinds his fingertips against it, Dean is suddenly hurtling towards his orgasm at such an unbelievable speed that he can hardly make words to ask for what he needs through the onslaught of pleasure.
Well, except maybe that adorably geeky thumbs-up and the possible blush on Castiel’s face after their eyes locked...
Everything is going without a hitch until there’s a small scuffle when the bill arrives and Cas tries to take it, but Dean holds his ground for once.
Something pointy glints in the light where it pierces through his dad’s chest.
He’s glad he said it when he had the chance.
“Not just a pretty face,” Dean jokes. Because Cas knows that better than most, he’s agreeing with a nod of his head when Dean changes the subject. “I’m starving. What do you wanna do for dinner?”
Because they’re together.
He never thought he’d have his first kiss with
Dean somehow missed half a step and damn near tripped over his own feet right there in the hallway of Sam’s apartment building. “No, Christ,” Dean replied, breathless with embarrassment. “I’m not an animal.”
he forgot about that. “I’ll make sure to roll you over at the cabin anytime I start fantasizing about smothering you with your pillow.”
Castiel winces before Dean can look up. “Sorry. I didn’t mean to. I only said that as a roundabout way to make sure everything’s really alright.”
Already rattled by the short but heavy interaction, he doesn’t bother to hide his annoyance with the blatant staring he gets from the kid behind the counter once he gets there. He’s sure the kid doesn’t mean to stare, but when Dean has to straighten his outstretched arm
“Considering I sent him half of what he has in that drawer, I feel pretty good about it,” Cas laughs huskily, nuzzling into his neck. “Those magazines are responsible for some very good memories, aren’t they, gorgeous?”
“You know that’s the complete opposite of what we teach them here,” Ruby says.
Today was only the beginning of our happily ever after.”
“Yeah?” Dean’s glad to hear it after smelling how thick the stress was in here at first. He wasn’t sure if Cas had been struggling all along or if tonight was the first time, but if Cas thinks they were doing okay before now, it would make him feel much better.
“All the damn time.”
“Well, well, well,” Benny says, his smile a lot more friendly now. “Looks like we got ourselves a shiny one.”

The man makes a face of mock horror. “Who doesn’t eat sweets?”

thing, fill the chasm inside of him.
“Yeah, because you turn into a desperate, flustered mess around guys you think are hot.”
“When we break up?” Castiel repeats.
“Well I don’t know about that,” Jess replies with a flip of her hair that makes Dean laugh. “But if I had to guess, I’d say there’s a blue-eyed hunk just down the road jumping out of his skin every time he hears a car drive by,” Jess says knowingly.
“I—I’m sorry,” Cas gasps. “I couldn’t—it was too fast—and—sweet
“Sorry,” he whispers quietly.
makes him feel so much better he can’t find it in him to be embarrassed.
“Then I guess you have to go,” he grins. “Come on, Cas. What’s the worst thing that could happen?”
Dean cricks his neck back and forth as he thinks about that, and because he hates that they’re standing so close together but not touching, he reaches out to wind his arms around Castiel’s neck. “Guess we had some other things in mind lately.”
Dean nods, too shocked by how quickly all of this is moving to say much of anything. “From what I was able to have translated, I understand the Princess has a very serious nature. She’s quiet. Old fashioned. She likes flowers, nature, and books, and dislikes anything flashy. I trust you will take this into consideration when you meet her,” he says sternly. “You’ve sat in on enough meetings with me to understand the importance of a good first impression.”
“Oh, you’re taking it,” Dean threatens. “You’re taking it, and some day when you get your head out of your ass, you’re gonna thank me for making the hard choice so you don’t have to start your life and try to have a family when you’re thousands of dollars in debt.”
Cas parts his lips in a silent shout of protest, but Dean has his back turned towards him. He sits up, stops breathing, fights his own broken psyche.
Dean hums against his neck. It is a win, in his books, too – he doubts Cas will ever again take pride in his wings, doubts that either of them can ever permanently fix one another’s broken parts. But moments like these – they’re
