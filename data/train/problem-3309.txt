Dean stopped sketching for a second. "Maybe... we can just see how it goes?" There was a hint of pleading just under the surface in that question.
“Oh, this looks wonderful,” Castiel says genuinely, and Dean stands nearby and smiles, looking pleased with himself. He lets Castiel eat his breakfast and drink his coffee in peace, leaving Cas’ office to hunch over his own computer and check his to-do list. Castiel’s mood has improved greatly, largely thanks to the meal and the company, and he sighs contentedly. The way his desk is angled to the doorway when the door’s open, he has a perfect view of Dean’s face and the back of his computer monitor.
“Through here. Take a seat,” Victor calls to him, and he looks to see him pointing at an office. Dean slips inside feeling suddenly exhausted, an unfortunate norm for him lately. He plops down in the chair and rubs at his eyes. He knows he needs to be sharp right now, but his body is just not cooperating. “You look pale.” Victor reaches in his desk and pulls out a chocolate bar and bottle of water.
“Hello, you need help finding something?” Dean offers in his normal customer service voice. He’s run his father’s hardware store for a few years now but still likes to work the floor and help with customers when he can.
“I don’t!” Castiel interrupts, feeling a wave of disbelief ripple through him. “I’m asking this because I want to be yours and I want you to be mine. Why can’t you believe that?”
,” Gabriel agrees with a sideways look. They spend the next few minutes engaged in small talk, discussing the menu before ordering lunch. It isn’t until the menus are cleared away and Castiel has taken a long swig of his ice water that he finally looks at his brother fully. It’s only been a few months since Christmas, but Gabriel seems more joyful than usual—boisterous and giddy.
, come painting his baby bump. His release is sticky and warm, his hole constricting tightly as Dean orgasms, and Castiel’s knot begins to form. His heart is racing as his mouth seeks out Dean’s neck, sucking a hickey in lieu of a bite—Castiel won’t allow himself to bite Dean while he’s pregnant, much to his mate’s disappointment—and continues to thrust
“Long brown hair. Tall and gangly. Looks like he can take a pounding.” Luc licks his lips, sneering at Sam. Castiel feels his stomach twist.
“Hello, Dean,” he whispers lowly, fixated on his eyes…such a mesmerizing shade of green, he can never seem to look away.
"No I don't hate it, but if you tell anyone I said that, you’re a dead man." Dean gave him a warning glare.
“If only you could see yourself, laid out in front of me like a buffet.” He alternates between fast and slow pulls on his cock, varying up the tempo so he lasts longer. His hand is slight damp and sticky from all the food play, which doesn’t feel fluid and slick like he’d prefer, so he pauses briefly to search for lube. Once his hand is thinly coated, his eyelids flutter closed, his breathing labored. “Do you want to know what inspired me to do this scene?” He hears a whimper in reply. “I was baking a few days ago and I imagined you in an apron, at the oven, on your knees in front of me…” Castiel feels his balls begin to tighten, a fire growing in his belly, and his hand speeds up. He hadn’t intended to tell his sub this part, but he finds the truth stumbling out of his mouth before he can stop himself. “If you had been there, my gorgeous pet, I would’ve taken you right then and there. Would have fucked you against the stove.”
Luckily Cas just reaches out and squeezes his shoulder. Dean bites his lip before grabbing the key under the mat and pushing into the house. The first thing that hits him is the familiar alpha smell of his father, smoky and a bit whiskey sour, though he could never tell if that scent came from the actual whiskey or not. The house hasn’t had the major repairs it needs, but Dean had always managed to keep it clean, at least. Now though, it looks completely forgotten. Dishes are piled in the sink and boots scattered by the door, and a funny smell coming from the fridge.
“Remember the time we picked up Sammy from a Halloween party? Our junior year?” Dean says, and Castiel thinks back for a moment, then nods.
Castiel sighs, suddenly fighting the urge to chuckle. “I see your inclination for impatience is not only prevalent in scenes, Dean.”
“Yes, you have been, but you haven’t been submissive. I’m willing to do what it takes to get you there. Or I can have you pack your bag and take you to the public training facility tonight. It's your choice,” Cain steps back a moment and gestures to the open bedroom door.
, Castiel thinks, watching Dean writhe around on the Saint Andrew’s cross. The past thirty minutes have passed in a rush of lust, the temperature in the room skyrocketing as the sub moans and pleads and cries out. Dean’s cock has turned a shade of reddish purple, the orgasm within building and building and
It’s the first week of June when Castiel beats his personal record. His hands are sweaty and shaking when he types:
Dean sighs, flipping the blanket off and pulls himself out from under the pillow. He blinks owlishly up at the smiling Alfie and nods his head. He pulls on his stupid submissive pants and buckles his collar before finally tugging on his white tank. Alfie waits patiently at the door with a nervous smile on his face, and Dean suddenly remembers Alfie scened with
Dean steps in even closer, letting the group behind them play through. “You up for a little wager, Novak?”
“So, you guys race horses here?” he asks, knowing next to nothing about horses other than what he learned from watching
“Alright, sweetheart, I trust you. We stick together, though. I want you near me. You're mine now.” Castiel pulls him into a tight hug, making Dean laugh.
Castiel feels his heart thump in his chest every time Dean uses that word. The trust and love and lust behind it, all packed into that one word. They reach the top of the hill and halt the horses to look down at the barn in the valley below.
“Dean!” he cries in a desperate whisper, burying himself in deeper, his knot forming and catching on the rim. “Omega, my sweet, sweet omega…”
smell good—his cinnamon scent is strong and mixing with Castiel’s, and he can barely smell Roman anymore. “Can’t wait to fill you up, fuck you full,” Castiel growls in his ear, and Dean thinks that sounds like an excellent idea.
It’s a stroke of luck that they have the manor to themselves tonight, a fact Castiel is happy to take advantage of. Dean cleans up quickly, showering and slipping on a change of clothes before spraying on his scent blockers again. Castiel can’t help but rub his nose into the crook of Dean’s neck, seeing if there’s any remnant of cinnamon sweetness on his skin—but it’s been completely covered. Of course Dean smells good, like he often does—a blend of fresh laundry and body wash—but Castiel already misses his omega’s delicious scent. He has a fleeting thought of throwing both of their prescription blockers in the trash, allowing them to enjoy each other’s natural scent anytime they wish. But that could only result in them tangled up in bed at every hour of the day…at least that’s what it seems like now, since Castiel is so charged up—giddy at the thought that he’s allowed to have this now.
“I will also be adjusting our dynamic, and would prefer that you call me ‘Master’ going forward, so you know that I am your Dominant and the only one you call Master. No one else will call me that name but you. Do you understand?”
“Cocksluts like my sub love for every hole to be full,” Castiel says brashly for the crowd. “Don’t you, slut?”
has done more for your son in three months than you’ve done in a decade!” Bobby shouts. “He’s here to help, so stop shootin’ the damn messenger!”
“Come on, you little shit.” Gordon grabs the back of Dean’s neck hard, shoving him toward the cruiser.
Dean finds his aptitude test quite surprising, but all he needs is a helping hand. Castiel tries to get back to business as usual, but some things are easier said than done.
“I’m not gonna want you to stop,” Dean huffs out, since he’s pretty sure he won’t ever want that. Castiel smiles as he dips in, capturing Dean’s mouth in a kiss. Dean gives in to the kiss, letting Castiel lead, an unhurried give and take. A hand skids outside his shirt, till he’s cupping Dean’s pec, running a thumb over a nipple that is hardening quickly. Without any conscious control his legs fall open, parting to make way for Castiel as he slowly crawls over him. He feels drunk off one kiss, lost in the sensation of it, and lets his worries slip away as he feels this man above him.
"He is paranoid as fuck, so I would just give him space. He is a shoot first ask questions later kinda guy," Ruby whispered to him.
Lucifer turns halfway down the hall to look at Dean. “Get him on his feet,” he barks, and Dean feels hands grasp his arms, dragging him up to standing. He wavers a little, thinking he must’ve banged his head pretty hard when he went down.
“You’re not stupid,” Castiel interrupts fiercely, moving to put his hand on Dean’s shoulder, but the sub takes a sharp and aggressive step back.
Jo has already stumbled into her bunk to pass out, and Dean collapses on top of his sleeping bag and stares at his boots, feeling almost too tired to take them off. Looking at them, he can’t help but think of FlyBoy again. Those fucking black combat boots. The ones Dean wears now are a lighter weight and have a zipper for quick on and off. The ones FlyBoy had on were more classic leather lace-up. Dean wishes he could have know what kind they were, but the boots were out of focus in the picture. He’d obsessed about them all night, having visceral flash backs to licking come off boots very similar to those.
He nods, though he feels his heart rate spike at being exposed like this. She’s going to see the bite…she’s going to know he’s tainted. He bites hard on his cheek, closing his eyes while he feels her stethoscope move, listening to his heart. He’s surprised it's not jumping out of his chest at her like some cartoon character.
Castiel can practically see his brother smirk, and he shakes his head ruefully. “You never change, do you?”
Castiel scrambles for a moment to remember what he was doing before seeing that email. All he can think is
“No, you don’t. I promise, you don’t.” Her voice is genuine, but there’s an edge there he can’t quite place. “Castiel, from what I know about you, you’re reliable and determined. Qualities that I deeply value. But you’re also compassionate to a fault, and impulsive when you care about someone. It’s how you found yourself in a predicament with your previous sub.”
“This cafeteria food is pretty good,” Dean says lightly, once all the toast is gone and he’s had a full glass of water. “That toast was…really fucking good, Sir.”
“Thanks, Bobby.” He smiles, grabbing the guns and hollering for Sam who is playing with Rumsfeld in the yard. “Come on, bet you can’t beat me. Best two outta three!” he calls and Sam runs over to him, taking the other gun. They head to the back of the property where Bobby has some old cans set up. Sam wins the first round and Dean the second but they tie on the third. It feels good and powerful to have the gun in his hand, to focus on the weight of it centering him. He starts thinking of another weight, of the pull of ropes and the press of strong hands and he lets out a shuddering breath just thinking about it.
“An alpha tantrum?” Castiel repeats, actually finding enough energy now to sound aggravated, though truthfully he’s more amused. He adjusts his hips and his knot catches on Dean’s rim, making them both moan. “I’m thirty-two-years-old, Dean. I do not have tantrums.”
When they eventually begin to quiet down again, Dean asks in a quiet voice, “So, did you mean what you said earlier? About Lucifer being a dick?”
Cas lets out a sigh, “I will be happy to see them again, but gaining something doesn’t take the sting of loss away.”
Sad this fic is over? Well, don't forget we're doing the 2020 Fic Facers Auction! You have a few more days to place bids, and we're totally open to writing timestamps of this story, if requested. ❤️
Castiel laughs, but doesn’t have time to react to that admission before Dean is pulling him down again, kissing him within an inch of his life and wrapping him up with the sleeping bag.
The words in his head bring up bile in his throat, and he chokes it down. He doesn’t know as much about mating bites as he should. He’d researched true mates, but those were pretty rare, and he now wishes he’d spent a little more time on the other kind of mating bonds.
“If he’s such a prize, then why did you let him go?” Cain shouts, red in the face, spit flying from his mouth. The words take some of the self-righteous anger out of Castiel’s sails. This is his fault, too—if he had never abandoned Dean, he wouldn’t have ended up in the hands of such a careless man.
“Did you imagine this moment?” He licks his lips, wanting to move those panties away, but keeps his composure. “Did you imagine all the filthy ways I’m going to make you come?”
“As I was saying, your body is truly a wonder. For instance, your skin is stronger and more elastic than that of a Dominant. It has better blood flow and heals faster. This makes it easier to handle impact play and makes your skin pink up beautifully. Did you know that?” Castiel is sitting next to him on the bed, rubbing at his pec muscles and making him want to hum at the warm touch.
Castiel pulls his hand back, exhaling, and picks a point on Roman’s neck where he’s going to sink the edge into his flesh. He’s ready, he has to do this no matter the consequences. He has to make Dean feel safe and protected. He has to be rid of Roman once and for all.
“Really? Finally got the balls to ask her out, huh?” This is exactly what Dean wants—Sam being a normal teenager.
“Aren’t you supposed to be working?” Sam asks, as he perches cross legged on the grass next to Dean. Kid is growing like a weed—he’s only an inch shorter than Dean now.
Cas gives John one last shove into the wall before he turns to Dean and follows him out the back door. Dean manages to make it halfway down the driveway before he suddenly slumps over the nearest bush and proceeds to vomit. His stomach heaves and twists, making his head spark with pain again. He feels arms lifting the bag from his shoulder, and then petting over the top of his head.
Catiel’s face flames red, a mixture of flattery and irritation swirling inside him. The rest of the drive passes in heavy silence, both of them too lost in memories, in emotions from the past.
“I was hoping to see if I could commision you to build a piece for me?” Castiel asks as his eyes travel over Dean's body. He’s not even hiding checking him out.
“Do something fun tonight, or at least get some sleep, okay?” Sam gives him a worried mother hen look. Hell, it’s his job to worry about Sam, not the other way around.
Cas hesitated a moment, feeling suddenly crestfallen. "I- I dunno, I assumed he was leaving him but I didn't ask."
Castiel still was the most beautiful person he’d ever seen. He didn’t know when it had happened, but there had been a shift within Dean. He needed Castiel, he needed him like he needed air. The very thought of being without him again took the breath from his lips. Dean felt frozen in place, stricken with a fear he couldn’t place, a growing pressure in his chest was making it harder to breath. Castiel moved forward and cupped Dean’s face in his hands, watching him.
“Hey, the needy little omega slut is waiting for us.” One of the guys chuckles and smacks his friend on the back. Dean swallows hard, stepping slowly off the wall as they move in closer.
Days turn into weeks and pretty soon it’s July—right in the middle of the hottest summer in years. When he’s not working night shift or waking up at the crack of dawn to go running, Castiel is messaging constantly with ‘67. While they’re still sharing their usual day-to-day updates, they’re also flirting on a regular basis and enjoying very satisfying sexting sessions most nights. Cas has learned that, when it comes to anything sex-related, ‘67 loves being told what to do, when and how to come, which Castiel’s dom side is all too happy to provide. It’s actually a little surprising how much sexual chemistry they seem to have just by messaging. Mostly they get off through dirty talk, but sometimes they’ll swap links to their favorite pornos and watch together, commenting on how good and wet and tight the fucking is. Castiel wants to ask his friend for more photos of himself, maybe even a video or two, but he’s scared to frighten him away. ‘67 is the one setting the pace of their developing relationship, it seems, and Castiel is just along for the ride.
“Well, Dean acting like a blushin’ bride can only mean one thing,” Bobby announces. “You’re Castiel, huh?”
Castiel’s hand shoots out so fast he hardly even registers it before he feels fingers grip around his throat. Castiel places his other hand over Dean’s mouth effectively silencing him and steps up into his space. Standing so close their noses nearly touch, he feels his heart hammering in his chest. “Enough,” Castiel’s voice is calm yet hard as steel. “Take off the apron, and go kneel in the living room while I decide your punishment for breaking the rules.”
But he can’t get Chuck's words out of his head, though, even now. He wants to trust this relationship with Castiel so badly, to hope that he might be a submissive worthy of a good Dominant. For the life of him though, he can’t understand why someone as successful and balanced as Castiel wants a fuck-up like Dean. He still pictures Castiel fucking that beautiful red-haired woman, and wonders if she wouldn’t be a better fit for him than Dean.
“We can keep things brief, then. We have a lot to go over at home and I would like for us to have a scene before bed tonight.” Cain’s face doesn’t give anything away.
Dean lets out his own growl, unable to take the slow, stimulating torture any longer. He pulls out of Castiel’s grip, tossing back the covers. Castiel flops onto his back in surprise with a plume of feathers flying around him. He gives the alpha a feral grin, deciding he isn’t the only one who can be a tease. He crawls over till he’s straddling the alpha’s legs, running his hands up those muscular thighs that his slacks do such an injustice of hiding normally.
“Yes. This was an exercise in self-awareness as well, and I’m pleased to see you acknowledging some of your positive attributes.” Castiel wonders in the back of his mind what kind of persona Dean would’ve picked a few weeks ago, when he was at his most defensive and most sickly. His sweet boy has come a long way in a short amount of time.
“Happy to serve,” Dean grins at him, and so what if he lets the words out a little long and slow? The only indication it has an impact on the man is his eyes going wide for a just a second before the cool mask is back in place. He doesn’t say another word, just sweeps out of the aisle toward the register, coat billowing out behind him. Dean leans against the metal shelf for a moment, catching his breath and hoping that encounter won’t be the last.
He suddenly has the image of himself strapped down, naked and open while Castiel sits at the kitchen table having dinner. He shivers at the prospect and moves to follow Castiel toward a staircase.
He nodded at her and she turned on her heels and marched off. He took a chair next to Kevin, feeling grateful not to be left with Meg or Frank.
He spends the next few holes doing his damndest to distract Castiel off his game, and actually manages to win a few of them. They are within three strokes of each other as they come to the last hole. Dean swings and gets his first hole-in-one of the night, jumping in the air and whooping at the top of his lungs. Eventually he turns, nervous that he might find an angry dom glaring at him, but all he sees is a warm, happy smile on Castiel’s face. Looking at him in that moment, Dean sees his friend—really sees FlyBoy83, laughing at his antics, happy just because he’s happy. He blushes a little at the thought, and stands out of the way for Castiel to set up.
Suddenly the image he’d seen on the billboard all those months ago pops into Dean’s head. The business man and the omega by the huge oak desk, not unlike this one. With a plan in mind, he tries to keep a straight face as he turns his back to Castiel and leans over the desk on his elbows, clicking off Castiel’s computer. He innocently—well as innocently as Dean Winchester can—arches his back and sticks out his ass as he pretends to look for something.
Dean hurries up the stairs and into the shower. He doesn’t miss the nozzle and cleaning supplies set up and makes sure he is thoroughly cleaned before toweling off.
Dean pulls out the pots and pans he needs to cook spaghetti and meatballs while Amy and Sam sit hunched at the kitchen table finishing homework. He thinks that he would almost like to stay and watch the movie with them but not even
“Promise?” he asks, suddenly desperate to hear the answer. He can’t help fearing what his post-baby body will look like and if Castiel will still want him. Castiel pulls back to look into Dean’s face, hand cupping his stubbled chin.
Castiel moves to walk around him in a circle and he clasps his hands behind his back, chin up and eyes down because he’s not a fucking amateur. He lets Castiel inspect him and watches as his shoes come back into view. He watches the fingers come out and drag up the length of his silk clad erection and he whines with the need for more, much more.
“Last night, when you were saying all that sciency stuff about omegas…” Dean blinks, bites his lower lip, then continues. “I just wondered why you knew all that. Did you know one once?”
Castiel chuckles, shaking his head, and rolls out of bed to head towards his dresser. His erection has already softened a bit, but maybe they’ll get a chance to have some private time tonight. They usually do…
“What a perky little ass,” Castiel purrs and Dean wiggles it. He is rewarded with a hard smack. “Stay still and be a good boy,” Castiel admonishes him and he does stay still but grins to himself all the same. He feels the brush of leather against his back as Castiel brings the straps together, buckling them in place. He draws in a deep breath, feeling his ribs expand and push against his new confinement. It settles something in him and he closes his eyes, letting himself slip a little deeper into his submission.
“I know that look,” April says offhandedly, stretching and standing up. “Just let me go downstairs and grab some food for you, okay? Then I’ll be back, and you can fuck me into oblivion.”
“You know…the shrink couch, where I’m supposed to lay down and tell you all my feelings?” Dean circles the two chairs, already feeling a bit closed in.
Castiel shakes his head, clearing the thoughts of Becky and Chuck momentarily from the forefront. That’ll be another discussion for another day, but in the meantime…
There is a louder smack sound and Dean can’t help but flinch at it. “A little jumpy, are we?” a man who has slid onto the seat beside him asks.
Dean nods along, eyes looking a bit heavy as he leans against Castiel’s side. “So the big day came and since I was thinner than Bal was back then, we decided I would get on her first. Mind you were doing all of this in the paddock with the other two mares loose. So we got her tacked up and Bal held her bridle for me while I swung up on top of her.”
“Well, your Norepinephrine was very high…at levels that tell me your mind and body is under a great deal of stress. You also have dangerously low levels of the Subamine hormone, and this is likely the cause of weight loss, low blood pressure, and your low blood sugar. Not to mention the effects on your state of mind, confusion, irritability, and depression.”
“Does next Saturday night work for you?” Castiel asks and all Dean can think is its not soon enough. He thinks about his schedule though, and maybe it does make the most sense.
Dean hesitates a moment. “He will be.” It's the best answer he can give because he isn’t gonna let it be any other way.
Castiel can’t gasp, can’t even choke—his head is spinning, his vision blurred. His chest begins to ache, and it feels as if a fire is creeping up in his veins as he fights for breath. His hands struggle, beating Lucifer’s chest and arms.
“Don’t pout sweet boy,” he whispers, kissing Dean’s cheek as he settles against his dom’s chest. Cas lays him down in the bed and snuggles up behind him under the covers and Dean drifts off to sleep before Cas even turns off the light.
Sam shrugs, muttering something about going to get a snack at least—before he’s wandering off towards the main house and leaving Dean and Castiel alone together. It’s strange, how nervous this makes Castiel—they’re alone together in a professional sense quite often. But never in the morning sunshine, both of them dressed casually, exerted from exercise and standing so close. They could just be any alpha and omega, drawn to each other inexplicably.
“If I can carry you up the stairs, I can manage the luggage. Why don’t you get the door?” Castiel huffs a breath out and starts up toward the master bedroom.
Castiel hides his reaction behind his cup of coffee, taking a long sip before answering. “He’s doing well,” he says vaguely.
“Not a beating, Dean. Your body is built to handle your submissive needs. Over the past few days, you’ve proven to be a masochist, and your body is built for it. Impact play and abusive violence are two different things, and helping you learn the difference is one of the most important aspects of your training.” Dean thinks on that. He never really felt like he could tell a difference till Castiel spanked him. It had all felt a bit violent and wrong before that, but with Castiel it had felt right, good, even—though it still hurt.
Dean snorts. “I got you, man. Take a seat.” He gives Cas a quick peck to his lips, a lightning-fast kiss that ends far too quickly. Still, the motion is reassuring, and some of the anxiety in his chest begins to loosen. Once Gabriel sits, Dean looks at Castiel and adds in an adorably bossy voice, “
“Thank you, Dean,” he answers softly, turning his eyes up to meet Dean's. There’s an apology there in his eyes and Dean nods, an unspoken forgiveness. He feels some of the tension in his chest ease having delivered his peace offering, and heads back to his desk. He hopes the rest of the day goes just a little bit smoother.
“Fine, but you need to deal with this, okay? And you can’t chicken-shit out. I told you about Jo, now it’s time for you to go figure your shit out.” Sam releases him, stepping to the side.
Castiel processes all this new information and shakes his head. “No, you’re not. Under no circumstances should Lucifer be allowed anywhere near Sam.” After a pause, the rage begins to fully set in. “Hand me my phone.”
“But you’ve had some time to think now…” He leaves the sentence open-ended. He feels sick with the dread of rejection. Even now, he’s ready to bolt up out of his chair and run out the door before Cas can say,
“Dean, in no universe do you have anything to apologize for… My foolish, pigheaded omega,” Castiel grumps.
“Please, please make me come, Sir. Please, I need it,” he whines, and Castiel’s fingers fuck into him faster and faster.
Dean returns in the same surly mood and drops the mat on the floor, his knees quickly following. He looks up at Castiel with narrowed eyes, looking pouty and mischievous and absolutely gorgeous.
Okay so I know I took a while to update but my horse is all settled in at his new barn and we are all moved in to our new place and work is sorta slowing down so I finally got this chapter pulled together. I know its not as long as I was hoping but bigger stuff coming soon. I hope you guys enjoy thanks for bearing with me and all the support.
“Shh, baby, sorry,” Castiel mutters softly, running a hand through Dean’s sweaty hair and kissing his neck. They’re both covered in hickies, on their collarbones mostly but Castiel has left three around Dean’s scent gland. Hours ago, in a quiet lull before the desperate need overtook him again, Dean had joked that Cas was basically acting like a dog peeing in the same spot to mark his territory. Castiel hadn’t loved the comparison, but had to admit the parallels were there.
“You could say that. But it hasn’t been helping as much lately.” He wonders just how much he should really tell this guy.
He cuts the stalks, making every incision perfectly straight in a way that he finds aesthetically pleasing. “I’d certainly like to think so.”
The door creaks open as Dean is putting the casserole on the counter to cool. He already laid out a plate for Cain, and set one aside for himself. He wasn’t allowed up at the table but Cain wasn’t into hand-feeding, so he usually ate on the floor with a towel in his lap. Maybe that was a point to bring up.
“Are we ready to begin?” she asks briskly, staring at the three men like a teacher getting a class’s attention. They all nod and she pulls out the first packet. “Well, first thing we will deal with is your father’s estate. As we discussed, Mister Winchester, you still wish to sell the property in Lawrence and the business in order to pay off the debt against your contract? Is that correct?”
Castiel looks up at the ceiling, breathing deeply. “It’s rare, but not impossible…particularly for true mates, which Jimmy was convinced Amelia was his.”
“Master, please, please,” his sub cries, when the pads of Cas’ fingers graze his prostrate. “Fuck me, please, please I need your cock, please fill me up, fuck me so good, please Master…”
“So, how ya feeling?” Charlie asks Castiel casually in a low whisper, drawing him back from his thoughts.
“Are you…” Castiel’s breathing is erratic, and he touches a cautious hand to his sub’s zipper, finding the firm curve of metal buried beneath. “Fuck, are you…wearing your cock cage?”
“I’m s-so sorry, so sorry, please forgive me,” Dean begs and Castiel just shushes him and rubs his back, placing kisses on his dampened cheeks.
Since his meeting with Crowley, Castiel has been looking for the right opportunity to tell Dean about his contract. But with Kevin relying on him more each day, Dean’s desk has been increasingly empty during business hours. And after work, there’s always a dozen people buzzing around the manor, including Sam, who has plenty of free time on his hands and wants to spend it all with Dean. Mostly, the only alone time they’ve had together are those precious moments in bed, just holding each other. Castiel can’t bring himself to ruin those times, to disrupt what momentary peace they’re given.
“I’m so sorry to disturb you, Sir, but your brother is here and he said there’s been a family emergency,” Tessa says quickly, eyes wide and full of concern. Gabriel smirks as he walks past her, hands in his pocket.
Dean bites down hard on his lower lip, resisting every urge to run and flee, find a release from this suffocating ache in his chest.
Dean flushes a little at the compliment. Benny had asked him out once in high school, but Dean hadn’t really been able to see Benny as anything more than a friend. Still, the alpha had been cool with it. He took the rejection with a lot more grace than Dean has been with the whole Castiel situation.
The next few hours pass in a blur. As soon as he gets dressed, Castiel and Balthazar load into the helicopter, transporting a patient from Mass General to the Baptist hospital in Brookline. The patient is stable for now but terrified of flying, so Castiel keeps the man occupied with stories and chatter until they land. He makes sure the hospital staff take him in and get him set-up nicely, and it’s only when they’re on their way back to the break room that he checks his phone.
He made his way to the cafe a few blocks down the street, cursing the cold weather as he tugged his hat down over his ears. Balthazar had already ordered the usual and was waiting for him at their usual back table.
“Second, you will be an obedient dog and follow my instructions, no matter what they might be. I am, after all, your Master.”
“Yeah, but I think you like guys too and I am trying to say I’m cool with it. You know I like both too, right?” Sam adds as an afterthought.
He looks up at Castiel, and feels like there’s something else the Dom is trying to say—but isn’t saying.
“I’m sure it's been stressful being a sub so in distress, with your levels so low. Plus, you must have felt intimidated coming into a high-end facility coming from your...background. I know you struggled a lot when you first came here. Attacking one of our trainers, fighting with a contractor, being resistant to many of our training methods.” Dean shrinks a bit in his seat at the mentions of what a bad submissive he was. “Most submissives wouldn’t have been allowed to continue the program, but my Castiel saw something special in you. Some subs just need a firmer hand, and I am glad Castiel was able to give that to you, even if it has taken its toll on him working these long hours. My son loves a fixer-upper, and he never ceases to amaze me with what he can do. I’ve seen him bend over backwards to meet his submissive’s every need. I can’t tell you how many submissives fell for him during training.”
He breathed through his bubbling anxiety, continuing his pacing till the doorbell rang. He tried to look through the peephole but it was too grimy to make anything out. Taking a deep breath, he opened the door a crack seeing a pizza box, but it was not being held by a pizza boy, but by Castiel. Freezing in terror, he felt the gooseflesh rise up his arms.
No, the only way to justify getting space from Dean would be admitting that he apparently spent his entire rut fantasizing about his cock being buried the omega’s slick, tight hole… Definitely not an option, even if it is a beautiful image. He feels his cock give a stir beneath the sheet and rubs his hands against it, sighing at the immediate relief. He may not be at the “broken bed” stage of his rut, but the need to breed and fuck and come certainly hasn’t left him yet.
. “It's just, well… You don’t think I’m fucked up for liking it last night when we—when you hit me?”
"You'll get there. Maybe Sam can try and help you out with it. Why don't you show him the ropes? I have to touch base with the boss." Ruby patted Sam's arm, and pulled him in to whisper in his ear, "Don't forget our agreement."
“Heavens be, Castiel, you did not tell me how handsome our latest addition was.” The woman flashes him a brighter smile and sweeps him into a surprising hug. “Look at that face. How will you get any work done?” She chuckles, winking at a very shocked-looking alpha. Dean stands a bit flabbergasted, unsure how he’s supposed to respond to that.
“Fuck, Cas,” Dean says in a garbled voice, after they’ve been making out for what feels like hours. “When you
The waitress dropped off the check and they both shuffled out of the booth. They walked shoulder to shoulder out to the parking lot by their cars. His eyes immediately tracked to Dean’s baby.
Dean takes a deep breath and moves to follow him. Orders he can handle. The man leads the horse to an area with rubber mats and rings along the wall. Dean watches the hands move almost too fast to track as they tie the horse to the wall and he gives a few soft pats the horse's neck.
Finally at the entryway, he goes to pull the door open and gestures outside with a flourish—watching as the female alphas and Raphael pass him with a sneer. Dean looks back to see Luc approaching him, while Castiel is stopped by the short British alpha just down the hallway.
“Hidden for your protection,” Hannah says, grabbing a clean glass from the dishrack and pouring Castiel a large cup of water.
Dean’s gaze down on Castiel’s lips, and Cas wants so badly to kiss him, to banish the last hour of mayhem into the recesses of his mind. “Dean, I want you to know that this is real for me. I never meant to hurt you.”
“Of course it's okay. I can’t wait to meet him!” Dean smiles genuinely, excited to meet the man he’s heard so much about.
Dean holds out his hands, still cuffed, and Castiel quickly takes a sample, putting the drop of blood in a small tube. “We can drop that off with the doctor later this afternoon.”
“Mystery of the universe,” Castiel answers, raising Dean’s hand to his lips and kissing the back of his knuckles. It’s a small gesture but it takes Dean’s breath away. He feels infinitely better knowing he can just be himself and not worry about being a good sub for his master.
“You’re having him scene at nearly ten o’clock, after being abandoned by his previous Dom? Don’t you think he needs some rest and security?” Castiel can feel his blood pressure rising. “And what do you mean by
“Much better,” Castiel moves above him and he feels the straps come across his thighs, ankles, and finally his wrists. It’s just as he imagined, and yet so very much better. He is spread and exposed now, putting all his trust in this one person. He hears a contented hum over him as fingers dance along his spine. They never leave his skin as they trace over him, light and soft grounding him.
“Morning, boss man. So where’s the newb I keep hearing about?” She smiles, looking around the room till her eyes land on Dean. “Hey there, you must be Dean.” She extends a hand, tucking a laptop under her other arm.
“Long time no see, Cassie,” Gabriel chides, flashing him a toothy grin as Castiel slides onto an empty barstool. It’s packed tonight, with large clusters of people at either end of the bar.
“In fact, one bee has to fly about ninety thousand miles—three times around the globe—just to make one pound of honey.”
comment. He wonders just how tall he is, anyway. Dean doesn’t really care if a guy is taller or shorter, but he does like it if he’s strong. He has a thing for thick thighs and broad shoulders. Kinda like his dom. He shakes the thought away and goes back to his signal app.
Castiel flips through the beaten up National Geographic on the side table. He just skims the pictures, unable to absorb any of the content as he waits for Dean. He did much of his own research into this form of treatment. Most of what he gathered is that the first few sessions could be extremely taxing, to say the least. He tries not to let the worry seep in, knowing it won’t help Dean to have Castiel stressed as well. Still, it tears at him knowing Dean is on the other side of that door reliving his most traumatic moments and Cas isn’t in there.
“I, uh…” The man looks away, but it’s different this time. It’s not a show of respect but a wandering mind, his brain obviously trying to work out a complicated emotion. “I’m sorry, you just reminded me of…someone…” He exhales a shuddering breath and stands up, looking pale. “I don’t know—I’m just so—”
“Well then.” She flips open a folder on her desk, and Castiel sees his first and last name flash on the side. “You’re a little under halfway through your six month contract. Is that correct?” Castiel nods again.
He pulled up in front of the house to see Castiel on his front steps, spreading what looked like salt. He glanced and noticed that Cas had done his steps as well. He needed to talk to Castiel. To make sure he wasn't gonna out him for who he was, but the thought twisted his stomach in knots. Taking a few deep calming breaths, he slid out of the impala and walked up to Castiel.
“Oh, of…of course,” Castiel replies, grabbing the lantern and setting it next to his backpack. On the top, he finds his folded towel first, and grabs it before he can second-guess himself. “But can I dry you off first?”
“I need to swing by my old house, is all. Sam left some stuff there that he needs and I just want to check up on the place.” In other words, make sure his dad hasn’t burnt it to the ground.
Dean gave a little sarcastic bark of a laugh but let Castiel pick him up. Dean’s skin felt clammy under his hands and he resisted the urge to press his face to the crook of his neck and smell the sweet scent of mate. He set Dean down in the water where he had added some bath salts. Dean visibly relaxed the second his body hit the warm water.
They chat for a few more minutes before ‘67 says goodnight, and once the message turns quiet Castiel flattens himself against the couch, staring up at the ceiling. He needs coffee and snacks if he’s going to make it till dawn. He stands and stretches, heading into the kitchen, but his mind is preoccupied by the events of the day. Wherever they are, he hopes his sub and his friend are both tucked away in bed, feeling his care and attention for them as they drift off to sleep.
at the moment. Thank goodness Castiel ignores his comment and puts his duffle bag in Dean’s lap to cover him for the moment, all while thinking of baseball and cold showers.
This is the sixth, maybe seventh time they’ve done this now, and Castiel can’t find enough self-control not to lose it every time. Dean’s hole is hot and wet and Castiel’s cock throbs inside him, wondering if he’s as overwhelmed by Dean’s heat as the omega is. It’s not the same thing—going through a heat as an omega, and being an alpha surrounded by the delicious scent of slick and arousal—but Castiel feels like his brain has been offline for hours now. Whether they’re having sex or sleeping or holding each other, Castiel keeps returning to Dean’s scent gland again and again, rubbing his own scent over Roman’s and claiming his omega in everything but blood.
Castiel rests on the heels of his feet, considering that for a moment. He’s still partially wet from the shower, though the towel Dean had found him in is long forgotten, discarded on the bathroom floor.
“It wouldn’t be just for you, though you’re certainly the main motivator,” Castiel admits, watching a gorgeous pink blush work its way onto Dean’s cheeks. He rubs his thumb over one cheek admiringly. “I’ve worried for years that Jimmy wouldn’t approve of what I’ve done to get ahead in life. I’ve just suppressed the guilt, buried my feelings so deep that I couldn’t feel anything at all. Not until you came along.”
“Can you hand me that wrench?” Dean asks, hand outstretched. He feels the tool hit his hand and pulls it back under to try and get the bolt loosened.
He reads over the test one more time and feels a sense of relief to have it all laid out like that. So much that he wouldn’t have been able to express verbally, but on the paper it was easier. He sends it back to Castiel and grabs himself a beer as reward for getting through all the questions.
Castiel breathes through his nose, knowing how little room he has in his swim trunks and trying very hard not to let Dean’s flirting get a rise out of him. Literally.
He grabs a towel and walks away from the pool, out toward the lawn. He finds a spot in the grass far away from everyone, and lays the towel out, crawling onto his stomach and stretching out. Sun warming his skin, he tries not to think about his scent. He thinks he’s starting to drift off, smiling at the sounds of laughter and splashing in the pool.
Dean looks indigidant, opening his mouth as if he wants to argue. But Castiel can’t stand to be alone in this room with Dean for another second, sweat forming on his temple, his skin hot and rashing. He’s half-hard, he realizes with overwhelming embarrassment, just from being in this omega’s presence.
“I can grab your old collar for you while we’re there as well.” Castiel smiles broadly at the thought. Dean smiles back automatically, but feels a rush of panic in his gut. He doesn’t know if he can handle a collar—even Castiel’s—but he decides to push that down and deal with it later.
“Thanks, Sammy.” He leans over to ruffle his brother's hair, and receives a scowl before they both head out to find the family.
“I could do so many things, Dean,” Castiel practically purrs against his ear. “I could tuck you up under my desk where no could see you. Unzip my fly and take out my cock, feed it into your mouth. Bet you would like that. Let you keep me warm while I work, staying good and quiet for me while I take conference calls. Would you like that Dean? Being my perfect little cock warmer?”
“I’m sixteen now. You don’t need to take care of me,” Sam argues, as if that isn’t a load of horseshit. Who would do his laundry and make sure there's food in the fridge? Who would help him with his homework? Granted, he has struggled to help his brainiac brother with his AP classes lately. He accepts that he isn’t smart—his GED barely holds a candle to Sam’s advanced Trig homework. Still he is the only one who knows how to make mac and cheese the way Sam likes it, and that has to count for something.
“It seems you three have misunderstood me. Just because I don’t go about in public, threatening others and ignorantly declaring myself the superior gender, does not mean I’m not capable of doing terrible things to protect the ones I care about.” He lets that sink in for a moment, taking his time. “There are only a few things preventing me from taking care of you permanently, and inviting every omega you’ve ever assaulted to dance on your graves. Then, clearing out your bank accounts and giving those omegas copious amounts of money. I’d donate the rest to a nonprofit of my choice, of course. Perhaps one dedicated to omega rights.”
“I walked. It’s not a bad night out, plus like I said, my brother has my car.” He isn’t sure what the hell is upsetting Castiel so much.
“Mmm, that’s an understatement,” Dean murmurs, bringing Castiel’s hands to his lips. “And don’t think I didn’t notice you say
“You’ve earned a break, you’ve worked hard.” Castiel plants a kiss on Dean’s forehead as he grabs the dishes to bring to Ellen.
Dean scrambles since he has no actual idea about any kind of job. “I’ll tell you tonight once I know more, okay?”
“And you must be Ellen. It’s nice to finally meet you.” Ellen sweeps him into a firm hug, and Dean can see the tension ease from Cas’ shoulders. Ellen gives one hell of a hug.
“Do I get a reward for being a good boy?” He glances up at Cas now from under his lashes, watching the lust play across his face. Whoever thinks the sub has no power, doesn’t understand this dynamic at all, Dean thinks ruefully.
“There, there, Dean, all done. You did very well. All is forgiven, sweetheart.” Castiel pulls Dean up to his feet and into a hug, tucking Dean’s tear-stained face against his shirt. Dean sucks in a few shaky breaths, and marvels at the way his muscles loosen and his skin stops feeling so tight and just
. Castiel grins and mouths at his cock, hands on either side of his hips, holding him down. He can’t take his eyes off the man as he licks and kisses up and down his shaft. It feels amazing but not nearly enough. Castiel finally moves his hands, pulling the panties down just enough to free his cock to open air. Castiel looks up at him in the dark of the car, licks his lips and proceeds to swallow him down.
“I’m fixing this, I just need to make a few calls. I might not be able to get you out until Monday, but I can make damn sure they take you out of that cell.” Castiel has regained that confident, reassuring tone, and it does wonders to soothe Dean’s nerves.
“Is the Dom here?” Dean ignores the question. Of course he didn’t eat. His stomach was five seconds away from crawling up and out his throat.
, for your protection.” He opens his mouth to argue but Billie continues. “If you can do that successfully, when your contract ends, Pamela and I will…mediate a conversation between you two.”
asked about you,” she replies suspiciously, as if it’s the most obvious answer in the world. Before the alpha can even sigh in relief, she adds, “And because it’s
Of course, the more he has to control himself, the harder it is. Just the thought of being a good boy, of making his master proud of him, gives him a warm feeling in his chest and a rock hard dick. He’s going to be so good, but it may just be the death of him. He’d been foolish enough to stroke himself the night before when it was well below thirty out, and almost came before he remembered himself. He’d jumped in a cold shower and shivered his way back to soft, but the ache in his balls never really went away.
“Dean,” he breathes, unable to keep the pleasant shock out of his voice. The man in front of him, sporting a pair of form-fitting black scrubs that leave little to the imagination, is even more gorgeous than Castiel remembers.
Lucifer kneels down and looks at Dean with a soft, pitying look. “You got a few good licks in, Winchester, I’ll give you that. Told you you’d regret it though. Every hit you inflicted on us is gonna be double for little Sammy in there. You remember that when you hear his cries, you little whore. You're the reason he’s going to hurt when I take him, and there isn’t a damn thing you can do about it.” Lucifer's voice is calm and cool, no hint of anger. As Dean looks at the alpha, he realizes what a true sociopath he is. “Maybe I’ll even claim him, sink my teeth into that milky white flesh and make him mine for good. Would be nice to have a pretty young thing to bounce on my knot whenever I want.”
“Seriously?” The sound of a refrigerator door shutting is palpable on the other line. “I better go to the window…”
A fresh wave of anguish overpowers him, and he turns over in bed. On his dresser, he can see a small, velvet jewelry box placed there. Dean’s promise ring, finally sized by the jeweler and retrieved by Alfie just yesterday. The box mocks him, reminding him of a time when he felt nothing but secure in his relationship with Dean. Now they’ve only exchanged a few texts and nothing more. Castiel has no idea if this separation is temporary or permanent, but the more days that pass, the more he fears this breakup is going to take hold. At this point, he’s not sure he can live without Dean at his side.
“My brother and his girlfriend thought the same thing at first,” Dean says. “Luckily, Cas brought me flowers and charmed the pants off of them.”
“Must have been an oversight,” he mumbles, though he very intentionally did not put this meeting on his calendar. He hadn’t even told Missouri about it.
He whips his head around to find his dad standing across the room from him. He moves quickly to his dad’s side as Edgar shuts the door, blocking the exit.
“It does if you’re in love with Dean Winchester,” Castiel points out, trying to sound light and airy. He pulls into the Roadhouse parking lot, grateful it’s such a quick drive, when he glances over and sees Dean staring at him—emotion in his eyes.
“For that little outburst, boy, you’ll have to start over,” he says calmly, bringing his hand down again with a substantial smack. Dean begins counting again, his voice labored and breaking, his arms still struggling against the tie. Five hits later, Dean’s ass is a gorgeous cherry red color, and he’s stopped fighting his bound hands. Ten hits later, there are tears coming from the corner of his eyes, streaming down his face. Anna swings the office door open at some point to check in with Victor, and her eyebrows raise in clear surprise. It’s not the act of a public spanking that’s surprising—Castiel would bet there’s another sub getting spanked somewhere on the property, right this very second—it’s the fact that it’s
When Castiel spies Dean by the fence his face breaks into a warm smile. “You could say that. It's why I wanted to get him out for a little this morning.” Castiel digs his heels in as Cash bucks and runs on the line again. All that muscle and power is just mesmerizing, and the horse is pretty impressive too.
“Come now my pet, up in the bed and panties off, let me get you all cleaned up.” His voice is soft now and Dean only nods, climbing into the bed and flopping down, feeling more wanted and used and owned then he ever has in his whole life and it feels pretty damn amazing. “Happy, sleepy pet aren’t you? You did amazing. You are best sub I have ever known,” he purrs, kissing his shoulder. Dean can’t help but whine and reach out, pulling the man toward him until he’s laughing and gathering Dean into his arms. He holds on to the moment of bliss and the man who gave it to him, and thinks he’s the luckiest sub on earth.
float over him, adding to the euphoric haze wringing out all the energy he has to give. It’s like he’s tumbling away, parts of him breaking away, and it’s terrifying and yet he feels safer now than he has in his entire life. The press of Castiel’s warm cock against his hip grinding down as skilled fingers work against his prostate. He feels it bubbling up in his chest and he comes on a cry as he feels a splash of come hitting his stomach and chest and he knows, can feel it in the vibration of muscle that Castiel is coming too.
“What? No, no.” He waves a dismissive hand. “I didn’t even give him my name when he asked for it.” He can’t keep the regret out of his voice, and he bites his lip, looking away.
Castiel manages a small smile, and opens his mouth to reply…when Sam doubles over, clutching his stomach. On instinct, Castiel swoops the young omega into his arms. Sam writhes as the cramps hit his stomach, moaning out in pain. Castiel deposits him back onto the bed, noticing how damp the sheets feel. He tries to think back over a decade ago, when Jimmy was experiencing his own heats.
Dean nods dimly, taking a step closer to the alpha. Castiel forces himself to relax, to not push anything, to only offer whatever comfort Dean needs from him.
“I have a scene in a few minutes. How about you?” He figures he has a second or two to make small talk, and Alfie has been pretty nice to him so far.
“Rest for a little, my good boy, then I will feed you, hmm?” Castiel’s voice is a warm rumble from his chest.
It takes twenty minutes for the knot to go down, and by then, Dean is sleeping soundly on the edge of the bed. Castiel drags himself to his feet, grabs a warm washcloth, and cleans Dean up best he can. Just the sight of Dean’s red, puffy hole seeping with Castiel’s come has the alpha in a frenzy, a spike of arousal burning in his gut. But he swallows it down, knowing Dean will appreciate the hour or so of sleep before he rolls over and impales himself on Castiel’s cock again.
“But you did get in,” Dean says, his voice breaking a little. Castiel’s eyebrows crease, so Dean stares down at his hands and continues. “I heard you. They tried to tell me it wasn’t you, but…I just knew.”
“We can always do that, pet.” Warm lips graze his own, and he stretches up to meet them in a soft and easy kiss. He takes the comfort where he can get it, and for just a little, lets his dom take care of him.
“I’ve never seen you go ‘all alpha’ like that, Cassie,” Luc says excitedly. “This omega needs to stay with you, I’ve decided. If you can’t get it up for him, then you won’t be able to get it up for any omega,
“That’s alright, we can take a training skiff and you can just keep me company. Meet me out front at ten?”
He licks Dean’s hole with a flat, wet tongue, once, twice, three times, more eager and desperate with each pass. Dean’s slick tastes decadent, like a syrup made for the world’s richest dessert, and Castiel’s heart races the more he swallows. He begins to spear his tongue into the rim of tight muscle, and Dean whines and lets out a breathless
“—with a few tweaks to the updated policy, our projections are estimating a rise in enrolled clients, up to two-hundred percent by next year,” the head of operations states proudly.
“I mean…did you only come back because you realized the numbers were messed with?” He doesn’t really want to know the answer to this, but knows he should. If Castiel is just following some stupid registry result, then he doesn’t know if he will ever trust that—or trust him.
“Heya, sweetcheeks,” Gabriel calls from the kitchen table, and she gives him a half-wave of recognition before grabbing Castiel by the elbow.
“Well, hello there.” A deep, unfamiliar voice draws his attention, and he looks up at the man he decided to hide behind. “Avoiding someone?”
He turns around so Dean doesn’t see his expression, marching slowly back toward the house, his mate’s eyes boring into the back of his head. He shuts the door with a sigh, running a hand over his face and feeling a little shaky. He heads into the only place that calms him down lately, and flips on the lamp of the nursery. The walls are painted a deep maroon, the rocking chair is old antique Bobby gifted them, and Castiel walks to the shelf where he placed a framed photo of Jimmy. He wants his son to grow up knowing who his namesake is, hoping that he’ll inherit Jimmy’s love of life and sense of humor, rather than Castiel’s awkward demeanor and inability to connect.
"Well, uh... you always talk about Omega rights and how injustice so many of the laws are these days. I know that you also said if we ever needed help for an Omega that you had, uh… connections?" Sam was fidgeting from foot to foot.
“Do you have something to say, John?” Castiel asks cooly, slipping a large bite into Dean’s mouth before he can interrupt.
“You must be Dean’s partner and Sam’s girlfriend,” Castiel comments, and Jo looks surprised by how much Cas already knows. He stretches out his hand and she shakes it steadily. “I’m Castiel.”
Castiel takes himself even lower, the cockhead hitting the back of his throat as he swallows, and a high-pitched cry resounds in the room as come shoots down his throat. He keeps sucking and licking until the cock is soft and shiny with spit, and his sub is still breathing ragged through the aftershocks. After a beat of silence, though, he lets out an unexpectedly chuckle. Taken off guard, Castiel asks, “What’s funny?”
. “Sam is passed out in the backseat. He—” Dean swallows, dropping his voice lower. “He presented, Bobby…he’s in the last few days of his heat.”
The door swings open and Castiel strides into the room, hanging up a tan trenchcoat by the door. His suit coat shortly follows, and he rolls up his sleeves before turning to look at Dean. He quickly redirects his gaze to the floor, holding as still as he can.
Castiel sits back on his heels for a moment, thinking hard, before flipping Dean onto his back so they can be face to face.
“Oh, hey, I saw an air pump in the garage—I’ll go grab it!” Sam offers, then looks down at the stack of packaged food in his hands and frowns. “Um, Cas, maybe you could…?”
“He said that exact thing about an hour ago,” Jo explains, grinning. “But he made sure to stock it just in case you came inside.”
He slides in behind the wheel of the Impala and checks the address on his phone. He still can’t believe he’s really doing this. He catches a glimpse of the worn siding on his home in the rearview and tells himself it’s not forever. He hasn’t bothered to dress up for the drive to Novak’s place. He knows he doesn’t really start till Monday and he only has one dress shirt to his name—he isn’t gonna make it dirty now.
He eases into a rocking chair before taking out his phone. Hitting Castiel’s number, he only waits a few rings before his alpha answers, “Dean?”
“Fried chicken is messy,” Castiel complains, passing Dean another drumstick coated in dry ingredients then dredged in a wet concoction. They’re almost done assembling the various elements with dinner,
“We can’t…do this…here,” he pants, struggling to maintain any semblance of control. His hips jut forward instinctually, though, when Dean’s hand lightly touches his balls. His cock shoves in Dean’s mouth fully, and he goes to utter an apology when he sees Dean is revelling in it—swallowing Castiel down like the intrusion is a gift.
“One phone call, Winchester.” Gordon shoves him toward what looks like a pay phone on the wall, mumbling something about “pushy entitled alphas” pitching hissy fits. He can’t wait for Cas to sick his lawyers on this douchebag. Gordon surprisingly turns and walks a few steps away to talk to another officer.
His muscles went rigid and a possessive growl started low in his chest. The sweet smell was coursing through his lungs and before he knew it he was out the house and standing in the sleet and snowy rain by Dean’s front door. He couldn’t think straight, all that was running through his head was
The guy just sneers at him, but Dean can hear sirens now in the background. The man freezes, Dean’s heart racing as he sees the dude hesitate. He can’t help it, he gives the shit head a triumphant smirk. This seems to be the deciding factor as the guy crawls through the window, brandishing his knife and coming at him. He swings once, hard, ducking a swipe of the blade and nails the guy on the upper arm. He goes down with a howl like a sack of potatoes.
“That's not good enough, Dean. My…my heat is over, and we are perfectly safe. Can we please just go home now?” Sam looks at him questioningly. Dean grips the counter, fighting another wave of vertigo. He can’t sleep and can hardly keep anything down. It feels like he’s withering away.
eating habits.” He nods with finality, taking another big messy bite of his bagel. “I just love food.”
“Oh, same old same old, you know how it is,” Benny replies in his soft, soothing voice. “Knight over there is giving you his best ‘fuck me’ face…or in his case, ‘let me fuck you face.’”
“I know that. It’s just…” He bites his lip, quieting down as the server drops their drinks onto the table and leaves again. Castiel waits patiently, sipping his merlot and waiting for Dean to continue. “This whole, my dom-is-best-friend thing just fucks with my head, man. I see you sitting there, drinking wine and nerding out about honey, and I have no trouble acceptin’ that you’re Flyboy83. But all I can see is my dom, and all the sexy ass shit I associate with you, and it’s like…”
“Fuck that.” Dean turns to run, a strange anger coursing through him—but he forgot about the leash. Castiel catches him, giving him a firm tug backward. He gasps as he stumbles into Castiel’s arms.
Dean closes his eyes and thinks of the most unsexy thoughts he can till finally he can adjust himself enough to hide any lasting chub. Castiel is watching him carefully over his coffee once he finally opens his eyes. “Better?” Cas asks, a twinkle in his eye now.
“Let me know when it's all done?” He just wants Dick Roman as far away from him and the people he cares about as possible. If he never sees the man again, it will be too soon.
Finally disentangled, he gets up and presses fingers to the bridge of his nose, fighting off a headache. He shuffles to the door, opening it and squinting at the sour expression on his brother’s face.
Dean’s mind can’t wrap around it—fuzzy and tired, imagining Castiel’s soft crooked smile as he comes against the sheets. His body twitches with his release and he feels like his body turns to lead, sinking into the mattress. He gently eases out the toy, though his body protests, wanting something to milk. He’s decided he simply can’t handle a conversation with Castiel with a toy shoved up his ass.
“So you’re saying, after being an investor of SucroCorp for years,” Roman begins in a deep and dangerous voice, “that you’re…what, exactly? Done with us?”
“Good boy. Now, most importantly, you are not allowed to come till I say so. Do you understand?” Castiel asks sternly and Dean nods with a quick “yes sir.” He thinks holding off tonight will be especially difficult. “Don’t worry sweetheart, I plan to help you,” Castiel replies as if reading his mind. He reaches into a box Dean hadn’t noticed and pulls out a simple cock ring. He rolls it over Dean’s cock swiftly till it's snug against him, pulling down the other ring to wrap around his balls. It feels surprisingly good, if not a little intense as he feels his hard cock straining against the pressure.
Speaking of curveballs, we'd be totally remiss if we didn't take an extra second to once again thank our beta readers,
“You're right, Dean, we should discuss what we are doing here before continue talking. I don’t want you stressed or unsure about what to expect from me or what I expect from you.” Dean nods at that, thinking it sounds fair. “I am a Dominant, and I am not currently in any kind of relationship with anyone. I was, as you know from the club, not looking to enter into a romantic or Dom/Sub relationship because I am only in Kansas for the next six months on business.”
He waited a second before knocking on the bathroom door. He peeked in and Dean was flush-faced, arms gripping his knees under the water. Castiel knew how exhausting his rut could be and it wasn’t nearly as incapacitating as a heat. He could only imagine how tired Dean must be feeling.
The pair he’s chosen is a black, transparent lace thong, and Castiel fights a shudder when the curve of that perfect ass fills up his vision.
“I’m glad you're doing okay. You really looked rough in the hospital,” Sam adds, sounding a bit relieved.
Castiel’s hand cradles Dean’s cheek. “You might have to work with other Doms occasionally, sweetheart, but I’m your Lead Dominant. If I ever intend for another Dom to train you, I’ll let you know ahead of time, and we can discuss it. Would that be sufficient?”
“Now that’s taken care of, I will go get these papers notarized and send you my bill.” She grins at them, throwing Dean a little wink before packing up the papers and floating out of the cabin.
“Oh yeah,” she says with an aggressive nod, coming to sit on Castiel’s bed but not touching him. Despite the intimacy of their arrangement, their physical interactions are only ever rut-related, which he appreciates.
