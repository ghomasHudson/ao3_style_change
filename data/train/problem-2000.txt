I make the bed, taking more care than I would if it were my own.  Then I shower and dress before installing myself in my chair to break the no screens rule long enough to check my email.  It would be just my luck if a great mystery presented itself while I’m not looking out for it.
I get up and try to follow the instruction that John left me with when he went to work.  I am supposed to stay home and rest, to nap and relax and not look at the computer or my phone too much and behave myself.
“Well, when you work it out, let me know.  I’m not good at feelings.  You’ll need to… spell it out to me.”
John takes his time rubbing the shampoo in leaning over me and picking through my hair.  I was right, there is still plenty of evidence of being at close range to someone who suffered a close-range ballistic trauma to the head.  I try not to think about it and to lose myself in the sensation of his finger on my scalp.  It feels quite intimate with John standing so close by my side.  I let my eyes close and I sink down in the chair further so that the edge of the bench supports my head.  I am almost relaxed by the time he has worked his way through most of my hair.
“That was the first time he raped me.”  Sherlock said, his voice breaking from the flat monotone that he had held throughout his whole speech.
“Male, 42, assaulted by this guy,” I gesture towards the bed with my chin, “multiple bleeding head wounds, he was struck repeatedly with the torch.  Declining GCS.  Initial presentation of 15 declined to 13 within a short period of time.  Pupils appear equal, I don’t have light to check reaction, or a blood pressure cuff or bloody anything.  Heart rate is 120, respiratory rate of 35.  Suspected dislocated shoulder.”
“Yeah, ok, but look around.” He says looking around theatrically.  “Not exactly the Shangri-La, is it?  Hardly the place to stage a burglary.”
He leaves it at that.  I lay tense and annoyed with myself.  I hate that the shit things that were done to me without my control continue to control me.
I do my best to doze but I am woken every half hour by an irritating, well-meaning, rule-following, question-asking nurse.  Each time she raps on the door frame the noise reverberates through my head like a slap, and I wake with visons straight out of Serbia.
He waits for me to collect my thoughts.  His face against my neck.  I push away the thoughts of Rimac and try to focus on John’s steady breathing.  Hoping it will help to reassure me.
Anyhoo,  It is a rare treat to interact with all you strangers on the other side of the internet.  I am loving all your beautiful comments.  They are my seven percent solution, truly addictive and a great buzz.
I never requested it.  I had asked them to throw everything that could not be donated into the rubbish.  I thought that they couldn’t bare to throw it away, but now I wonder if perhaps he wanted me to have it.  One last dig at me from beyond the grave.
“Text me later when you decide.”  He says.  “Drink some water today.  Dehydration won’t help your head any.”
It is long moments before I can drag my eyes away from the photo to read the letter.  I place the photo face down on the arm of my chair.  I don’t want to see it.  I don’t want it to see me.
I nod and he rucks up my t-shirt.  I sit up to pull it over my head.  I pause.  My body is a mess but that is not what really bothers me.
“Phone charger, at the very least?”  He asks, he looks so utterly forlorn that I confess that it is in there.  I plug his phone in, well out of reach, I put yesterday’s newspaper on top of it, in hope that if it is out of his sight, he might forget about it.
I feel him hard against my lower back.  His breath fast against me neck.  Knowing that he is enjoying this just spurs me on.  I push back against him.  My mouth open, panting.  “So good.”
John comes closer.  Crouches down in front of me.  He tilts his head to try to catch my eye.  I tell myself to harden up.  I sit up a little, look up a little.  Breathe a bit deeper.  Meet his eye.  What I see there gives me the courage to start.
“What you did last night was....”  I begin as he trails a single finger along the length of my twitching cock.  Regaining my thoughts, I have to speak in a rush to get the words out, “I was, um, I was worried about you all night.”
My worst fears are realised the next morning; when I wake up Sherlock isn’t there.  My blood runs cold.  I have ruined it.  No, I ruined it a long time ago, but Sherlock has finally realised.  I am still reeling from the look on Sherlock’s face when I broke the coffee mug.  Even after the promises I made, I still don’t think there is any way he can ever forgive me.
I hear footsteps on the stairs.  Greg couldn’t have got here that quickly so it must be the ambulance crew.  I call out loudly to let them know where we are.
“That was different.  That was for Mary.  That was for you.  That was worth it.”  Sherlock says as if it is the most obvious thing in the world.
“Course not.”  She says, clearly unconvinced, heading for the door.  “Eat that and I’ll bring you some scones for afternoon tea.”
“Me too.” I cut him off, I don’t want to think about it either.  “Are you finished at Baker Street?  I want to get it cleaned up”
“Yes, yes, it is necessary.  I know you claim you can look after yourself but… Rosie.  I won’t have her put at risk.  He has killed two kids already.”
“Night, John,” I say, while I am still facing the mirror.  I see his reflection as he turns.  Emotions slide across his face.  He goes from quizzical to worried to disappointed all in a brief moment.
I go to the other side of the bed.  The sheets are cool, and it feels foreign to lay on this side of my own bed.  I don’t know how to feel about this.  Does it mean anything, is it weird, should it feel strange to share a bed with my best friend?
Tomorrow we will check retail companies with delivery drivers.  Tedious leg work.  The day after it will be fast food delivery drivers and the day after it will be couriers and then truck drivers and patient transport and any other damn thing we can think of.
“Enhanced interrogation techniques were used,” I begin, if I talk about it clinically maybe I can explain, “Water, especially on my face triggers a stress response.  The position I was in and the addition of the towel were too…familiar.”
“No, he is usually… gentle.”  I am a bit surprised by the truth of my own answer; I have never considered Sherlock as gentle until the words were out of my mouth.
“Good luck.”  Greg says grimly as the lift arrives.  As I step inside, he adds, “John, just don’t leave the country, alright?”
“We need to find a new way to do the assessment.  No pain, no personal questions, definitely don’t ask his name.”
As John is finishing up I get to the final page.  He joins in from memory as I read; “he was a spunky hanky panky cranky stinky dinky lanky honky tonky winky wonky donkey” while Rosie claps her hands.  John’s breath huffs on my neck as he laughs at the ridiculousness of it all.
Mycroft leaves the room and Dr. Pawson and I follow him.  Pausing outside Sherlock’s room, down the hall far enough to be out of earshot both Dr. Pawson and I agree that Sherlock’s agitation has more to do with the traditional style of questioning and the sedation than the head injury.  It makes sense as all the other findings indicate that the head injury is not a serious one.  It is agreed that we will continue with creative questions until the sedation fully wears off and see how Sherlock is coping then.
I hear soft footsteps behind me.  I turn my head; moving slowly and deliberately, but I cannot see anyone there.  I wonder if it was a hallucination.  They happen sometimes, a gift from the past.  Too many indulgences with chemicals that are best not forced into the blood stream.
But he doesn’t.  He would never admit it, but I think it comforts him to have me here while he is feeling so dreadful.
I laugh a little at her blunt statement and oversimplification.  True to her nature; saying it exactly how it is.  But when I say, “yeah.”  I sound as deflated as I feel.  She makes it sound so simple.  It can’t be that easy, can it?
On the fourth day he ignores my questions and the top of my head that I have thrust towards him.  Instead he drops Rosie into my lap and heads straight into the kitchen with the bags of groceries.
The water is warm, and surprisingly comfortable.  We breathe in sync with one another.  That is how it feels now, and has for a long time, like we are in sync.
“I know.”  He breathes into my ear.  His hands run up my thighs, ghost along my hips and across my stomach.  My skin ripples under the warm water.  I suck in a breath.  It sounds sharp and hollow, bouncing off the bathroom walls.
I hate this god damned brain for all the crazy shit it can cook up.  I can’t stay in bed any longer.  The new sheets are scratchy, and the mattress doesn’t feel right yet, it all serves as a reminder of what happened here.  Of how close I came to being killed or worse yet, raped again.  I had told myself, repeatedly; that what happened in Serbia was an isolated event, that nothing like that would ever happen again, could ever happen again.  I hinged everything on that notion and now that it came so close to happening again, I am doubting everything I thought I knew.  And that scares  the hell out of me.
The water is cool when I clamber awkwardly out, waking him up as I fumble to my feet.  The bathroom mat is soaked and there are puddles and bubbles.  I help him out of the tub, careful that neither of us slip.  I get more towels from the beneath the sink and wrap them around him.  He grunts as I push him towards the bedroom.
The card is for Metro Forensic Cleaners.  I sigh.  I will probably need them.  Sherlock’s room had looked like something out of a B grade horror film.  I could only be worse now that the blood has dried.
Seeing him so unwell, grey and gasping, knowing how close he came to needing to go onto a respirator, had taken its toll on me.  On the second day of hospitalisation I had been so sure that he wasn’t going to make it out of there, that I went to our solicitor to make sure that his will was in order.
I slip out as quietly as I can.  He needs to rest, and I need to get to Greg’s office and give a statement before he has me arrested.
It is late; well after dark when I come up the stairs.  The trips to Sherrinford always take up most of the day and they are always draining.  The familiar sight of John sitting in front of the fire with a newspaper on his lap greets me as I enter the living room and it makes me yearn for the old days when John still lived here, and this was an everyday sight.
‘Well, congratulations.’ I mutter under my breath as I turn the envelope over.  “You figured it out.”
“It’s beautiful there.”  I say, remembering the brief visit there from our honeymoon.  Mary had loved it there.
“I knew something had happened while you were gone, something serious.  You were different.  Quieter.  Less self-confident.  Sadder.  I was so caught up in my life.  I should have asked you, but there was a part of me that really didn’t want to know.  I was scared to know what it was.”  I am rambling; the words gush out faster than my brain can work.  Then I realise.  My heart sinks.  And a moment ago I didn’t think it could get any lower.  “Oh God.  I hit you.  Oh, no.  I’m awful.  I was so angry when you turned up at the restaurant.  You tried to tell me why and I wouldn’t listen.”
Eyes shut I search for the hem of his nightshirt.  The distraction of his mouth freeing my hands to move.
Sherlock’s right hand moves slowly.  He points multiple points on his own neck chest and abdomen.  His fingers catch on the heart rate monitor cables and Mycroft moves swiftly to untangle him.
I stop were two pages are stuck together.  The tacky surfaces turn them into one thick page.  I prise them apart gently.  Something is stuffed between the pages.  A sealed envelope.  My heart thumps when I see that it is addressed in shaky writing to Sherlock Holmes.
As I wait for my taxi to deliver me to Baker Street, I consider the last few days.  Each day at work has felt like it had lasted an age.  I don’t want to leave Sherlock alone while he is still struggling with the concussion but I had to; Robert has been great, taking on all my urgent patients and rescheduling the others, but he needs a day off.
“It never occurred to me, in all honesty. It wasn’t as though the connection had done me any favours. He was stubbornly persistent about keeping me out of here entirely until he was sure that it was without risk or flaw. Besides,” Sherlock wryly raises a brow. “I hardly had much of an opportunity, even if I’d thought to; my brother isn’t exactly a topic that I care to discuss mid-shag.”
“Mrs Hudson leave Baker Street?” Sherlock elaborates, reaching down to wrap his arm about her shoulders and tug her affectionately against his hip. “
He does indeed get his hands on it in the end, though the means rather outweighs the end. As the hours creep by, everything slowly devolves into a blur of pain and exhaustion. He’s subjected to examination after examination, and what begin as cheery check-ins slowly morph into tense affairs that leave their doctor and nurses frowning and concerned. He asks endless questions at the start, but by the next day, it becomes no different than anything else; just something to lie back and endure. He’s never felt so bone
In a busy server bay at HLMS Systems, a small fleet of robotic arms work diligently, transferring cylindrical memory cells into permanent storage. The walls of the bay twinkle like the night sky, the lights of thousands upon thousands of cells flickering in the walls of their system housings. A distinguished older gentleman leans on an umbrella at the end of the corridor, overseeing the installation of a new consciousness into a panel of the casing labeled SAINT JUNIPERUS 1895. The newest cell, SJ 221B - 1023, plugs neatly into it’s place on the panel, the LEDs ringing it’s faceplate oscillating in a circuitous motion all the while.
It’s an unimaginably heady thought; that this very moment, his child is growing, right there, inside of Sherlock’s body.
It's a week before he sees Sherlock Holmes again. He's just finished his shift, and the moment he exits the staff changing room to head for the tube, he's accosted by a tall, vaguely familiar shadow.
“Right! Yeah,” Lestrade grins and fishes a thick folder out of the plastic carryall dangling from his arm. “We think we had fresh lead pop up on this cold case. Was thinking you could take a look.”
“God, there’s a horrifying image,” John grimaces in a deliberate attempt to distract from the small burble of unease creeping up inside of him at the thought of
As they make their way down the sidewalk, alphas sniff the air and turn their heads to stare appreciatively at Sherlock as they pass. In the face of such disconcerting attention, he flips up his coat collar and burrows deeper down into it. Angelo, thankfully, has more tact that that.
So, while the shower starts up behind the closed bathroom door, he clambers out of bed and locates his clothes from the four corners of the bedroom. He briefly considers dashing up to his room for a change of clothes, but another loud grumble of his stomach has him deciding against it. Instead, he rummages through the fridge and sets to making them a proper fry-up, carefully avoiding so much as a glance in the direction of the barstool over which he’d bent Sherlock just the day before.
Between the suppressants and a diligent use of scent neutralizers, he could conceivably conceal the pregnancy for as long as five months— well into the second trimester.
How strange it is, that he’d once thought of bonding as the very height of subjugation. Not a physical act of dedication or devotion. Just a way for an alpha to keep him under their thumb; show the world that their ownership of him.
Irritated that she’d managed to so thoroughly fool him; what with his attention so badly compromised by his distracting little secret. Pleased that her story hadn’t turned out to be another disheartening, precautionary tale about the dangers of straying from one’s expected role, after all. Entirely indifferent to the matter in the face of his far more…
“Good morning; I like your funny hat; I’m sad tonight. Let’s have dinner…” She reads the messages aloud in a tone of mild amusement. “You looked sexy on ‘Crimewatch’, let’s have dinner. I’m not hungry, let’s have dinner.”
John laughs ruefully at that shameless admission. It’s almost refreshing to hear something honest out of her. “Sherlock doesn’t
“Yes, well.” Mycroft curls his fingers around the bed-rail and cuts his gaze away uncomfortably. It puts Sherlock in mind of when he woke up in the hospital after his first overdose, to find Mycroft perched stiffly at his bedside. Granted, this is a significantly more positive occurence, but nevertheless— their own humanness has never been something they've been able to share comfortably between them. Mycroft clears his throat. “I imagine you’d prefer John’s presence during the event nearly as much as I’d prefer not to bear witness to it.”
to him that John might feel that way. Not put off by, or even merely tolerant of his present state, but
“Fuuuuck,” John groans, limbs twitching under the onslaught. “You’re... um... a natural,” he adds haltingly, gasping for breath when Sherlock gives a pleased hum around him. For a short while he lies there pliantly; trembling and moaning in response to Sherlock’s dedicated ministrations. “Wait-” he pants after several long minutes. “Sherlock, you’ve got to... um- stop, or I- ah!” He taps frantically at Sherlock’s shoulder, until he finally deigns to flick his pale verdigris eyes up at John questioningly over the slope of his belly. “
The back of his neck prickles as he shifts restlessly from one foot to the other. His own feelings on the subject certainly don’t help matters. He hates how much he
,” Sherlock sniffs superciliously, and runs a fingertip over the rim of his glass as he considers whether he should be a bit more honest. Probably. “Also, you walked by me outside and I heard you arguing.” Clearly not a disastrous choice, as John merely chuckles good-naturedly and rises to his feet.
“John!” Sherlock follows closely on his heels, calling after him, and reaching out to pluck at his coat sleeve when he manages to get close enough. “John, wait!”
enough data off of Mycroft at the moment to determine the answer conclusively, but he files the hypothesis away for later consideration.
He often finds himself sharing details of his life, and thoughts that he’s never before uttered aloud to any other living creature. Any sense of hesitance or self-doubt drowned out by the undeniable faith that Sherlock seems to place in him in turn, entrusting even the darkest of truths to John’s ears.
Hamish Alfie Holmes finally makes his way into the world at 4:17 am, after 39 hours of labour and one emergency cesarean, and wastes no time whatsoever loudly notifying the world of his displeasure over the harrowing ordeal.
No longer forced to content himself with mere fantasties of John's body, he spends tireless hours reacquainting himself with the warm planes of it, so often hidden away under deceptive grandfatherly jumpers. While John isn’t quite as fit as he’d once been in his army days (there are several substantiating photographs squirrelled away in his mind palace, discovered while casually perusing John’s belongings early in their cohabitation, that have admittedly featured heavily in Sherlock's wanking fantasies) he’s hardly let himself go.
“What,” Sherlock pants, raising his head in confusion from the pillow at the non-sequitur. He blinks down at John’s mouth, and it’s torturously close proximity to his cock, dumbfounded.
“Please, John,” Sherlock rolls his eyes dismissively. “Imbeciles have children all the time. In fact, I’d never thought of it before but, while the Philip Andersons of the world run about reproducing without thought, my own
“Yes,” John offers dreamily without thought, than catches himself and clears his throat, “It would be my utmost pleasure my lord,” he hastily adds.
Some nights he listens to Sherlock ramble for hours about an extraordinary array of topics; from the mundane to the macabre. Others they sit in silence; the omega lost in the fathomless depths of his own thoughts, or stubbornly entrenched in an extravagant sulk. Still others they play games and exchange stories, like children whispering in the dark of the nursery, whilst the adults of the house engage in reveleries below.
Without any conscious thought, he reaches out and clutches at John’s hand, then realizes his mistake and starts. Just as he’s about to carefully retract his hand — in the hopes that the gesture has gone unnoticed in the excitement of moment — John squeezes back, turning to shoot him an exuberant grin before gluing his eyes back to the monitor.
Lestrade is waiting for them outside the Cavendish house when they arrive, leaned up against the hood of his panda, leafing through a folder in his hands. Sherlock leaps out of the cab as soon as it pulls to a stop, leaving John to pay the driver. Lestrade looks up and grins, relief washing clearing over his face. “Finally,” he calls, pushing off the car, “I was beginning to think you weren’t going to show.”
"Of course, yes. Enough for a lifetime." John squares his jaw, carefully adopting the stoic, regretful expression that he knows everyone expects from a veteran. "Far too much."
it, but even he can agree that the alternative is significantly worse. I’ve also crafted an entirely synthetic generic Beta version, which is especially effective in situations when I want to go unnoticed.”
With an irritated huff, Sherlock speeds through an in-depth elaboration of his deduction, then rises from to hand the phone back to Irene. “Please don't feel obliged to tell me that was remarkable or amazing,” he informs her tetchily, “John's expressed that thought in every possible variant available to the English language.”
“You’re very quick, Mr Holmes.” The Equerry lauds in admiration, and Sherlock can hardly keep himself from rolling his eyes.
“What exactly do you propose then? Are we meant to choose a name that’s proportional to his physical size?” Sherlock sneers. “Do we add letters as he grows?
“Getting you out of all these posh things,” John carries on as he undoes the shirt’s cuffs and slips it off, helpfully narrating for Sherlock while his brain attempts to reboot. “I didn’t really get to last time. I've dreamt about it.”
“Like a baby,” the alpha declares as he palms his mate’s shoulder and beams down at him with indulgent affection. Clearly the man is well accustomed to his mate’s theatrics.
wants, no matter what makes his heart race and his Alpha posture proudly, he’s not going to do to Sherlock what’s been done to him his entire life. This is something that
“So what were we doing there?” John questions, trying to ignore the way his heart picks up speed in his chest.
A few days later, he and John host Christmas Eve at the flat. With the fuss of the Cavendish case, and everything
“I’ll say,” John agrees. “Like a frightened horse on a frozen lake back there! I'm kidding,” he tilts his head, considering,”...
“There will be two passcodes,” he informs his brother bitterly. “One to open the phone, one to burn the drive. Even under duress, you can’t know which one she’s given you, and there will be no point in a second attempt.”
“Yes, well I…” John shifts uneasily on the edge of the bed, and then turns to make a bit of a shooing gesture in Sherlock’s direction. “Ah hell, you may as well budge over; if we’re going to make a proper slumber party out of this.” Sherlock sputters a bit, but shuffles to the far side of the bed to make room for John regardless. John clambers up onto the duvet, plumping one of the pillows up before settling back against it with a sigh. “Much better.”
given consideration to ensuring your safety— I have no illusions about my brother and the... unpleasant actions he could take. I’d planned to avoid anything that might attract his attention before the second trimester, as that is when the risk of losing the child drops significantly. Doing away with you at that point would no longer carry any guarantee of ‘solving’ the issue and
.” The velvet heat of John’s mouth envelopes the tip of his cock, and while his brain is quite possibly in the process of evaporating, he can’t be arsed to care.
Of course there’s the small added benefit that, should Sherlock be successful, Mycroft will be positively
antiquated. Everyone is well aware that this,” he angles his fork to point toward his abdomen, “is perfectly achievable via clinical means if I weren't receptive to... the more traditional method.” He peers up through his lashes at John as he pushes his food about his plate, hesitating for a moment before shyly adding suggestion. “Though given how well we get on, I expect most will simply presume Mycroft made an effort to procure an alpha I would find agreeable.”
“Hm, I may not actually be a mind reader, but I suspect something occurred at that juncture to make the relationship go awry?” Sherlock wagers cynically. John's always had terrible taste in women, as far as he can ascertain.
“Could you please stop it?” The man requests tersely as he walks ahead of the woman at a brisk pace, clearly trying to evade her. He’s perhaps a year or two older than the young man himself, and slightly below average height; though sturdy-looking, as if there’s more compact muscle hidden beneath his t-shirt and leather jacket than one would expect of a man his size. His purposely tousled hair is dishwater blonde, and his face thoroughly British and unremarkable.
“Sleep now,” John encourages, conscious of the short, exceptional heat that his bite will induce within the coming hours.
“There’s always something,” Sherlock reminds him ruefully, and there's a flash of something in his eyes before they shutter. “My apologies,” he offers crisply as he steps back. The only sign of emotion is the slight tremble of his hand as he buttons his suit jacket. “Please disregard my misstep.” And with that, he turns on his heel and starts up the stairs, ignoring John when he calls after him.
For the very first time in his life, he’s found himself tempted by the small row of blue pills in his suppressant pack. Considering taking them as prescribed, allowing himself to go into a mild heat on schedule, so that John might be convinced to...
The meeting of their mouths borders on violent, both of them gripping hard and crushing the other close. The culmination of every protracted moment of longing that’s built up between them over the last several months, it’s a simple thing to lose one’s self in; air becoming little more than an inconvenient obligation. He explores the bewitching curve of those lips worshipfully, savouring the indescribable taste of Sherlock’s mouth. Sweet, but tart; as decadent as biting into a ripened plum in the dead heat of summer.
making sure to eat even if I’m not around to make you.” He points an accusatory finger and flattens his mouth. “
The fact that he'd deliberately worn a vest of John's beneath his shirt, to mimic the scent of a bond whilst travelling in the more conservative countryside certainly doesn't help matters.
could make time to attend the appointment at the family barrister’s with Mycroft, the very least his infuriating brother could do in turn is actually show up on time. As he turns to begin his fourth lap of the street, he spots the black town car pulling up alongside the kerb ahead. He picks up his pace, covering the distance as quickly as possible with a stride that’s mortifyingly begun to take on an undeniable hint of
He looks up at Sherlock, who’s finished his meal and is sitting, silently sipping his tea while staring blandly at something just past John’s shoulder. Probably thinking about how best to explain to John and his simple mind that what they’d done was under no circumstance to happen again. Possibly contemplating how best to inform John he was to pack his things and vacate Baker Street, posthaste. Seized with a sudden, blind panic to preserve their friendship, and to salvage whatever might be left of Sherlock’s opinion of him, John speaks up.
He knows full well that his behaviour has begun to grate on John more than usual, but he’s unable to force himself out from his slump. On a daily basis he veers between an anxious desire to tell John, and a crippling fear of the potential reaction. This, of course, inevitably leads to his traitorous brain extrapolating the various negative outcomes of John somehow making the discovery for himself, and that fear rapidly balloons into panic.
For all their camaraderie, there is one subject that they never address directly: the profound divide between their circumstances. They only ever come close the once, owing to the Lord and Lady Stamford’s ability to host an exceptionally diverting rout.
After what feels like an age, Sherlock’s hands finally trail lower, to where pale gold grows darker and coarser. He gives a pleased hum and shuffles backward slightly, to rest his bottom on John’s thighs instead. Long fingers don’t hesitate as they unfasten the falls of John’s pantaloons, and peel the fabric down to expose the Alpha’s thick, engorged member for the first time. His eyes widen at the sight of it.
“Now,” the young man cuts in suddenly, “as I believe that John’s made it quite clear that he has no interest in a further dalliance with you, I need to speak with him.
” He cuts himself off before he can say it; the one secret he’s been so carefully guarding for all these weeks now. Aware of just how near hyperventilation he’s come, he presses his shaking fingers to his temples and focuses on bringing his breathing under control.
“He said you do that,” she divulges as her smile deepens. “What’s Coventry got to do with anything?”
for him. Also, the potential for data collection on sexual response was too compelling to resist. And so, in the usual progression of things, we began engaging in a number of progressively more intimate sexual acts on a regular basis.”
As soon as the door silently falls shut in her wake, Mycroft jabs a finger toward the camera phone where it lies between he and Irene on the table top.
“It can’t quite hear you yet,” Sherlock smiles down from his pillow, lifting his right hand to rest it softly over John’s forearm, tracing his fingertips in nonsensical patterns over warm skin. “According to my research, fetuses don’t generally begin to hear sound until around 18 weeks, and it isn’t until roughly 20 that they begin to respond to distinct voices.”
How humiliating; to find oneself in a situation that’s generally the purview of insipid sixteen-year-olds who neglected to utilize contraceptives.
we have you two down for a twin instead of a double.” He clicks about furiously before offering an apologetic smile. “And we haven’t any doubles available until halfway through your stay, I’m afraid. We’ve been just swamped as of late.”
“You're especially bothered because you've just discovered that your Alpha husband is having an affair with a younger male Omega, and we put you in mind of them. You'd be fine with him working off some of his sexual needs on the side— particularly his more
“I see,” Mycroft bites out tersely, carefully setting his tea cup aside before continuing in a clipped and dangerous voice. “And given the apparent
,” John happily obliges him, hands pressing Sherlock’s hips upward to better maintain the angle. “And not…the bit about your suppressants?” He huffs with amusement.
He supposes she had to find out eventually that there’s only ever been John for him; the way it counts.
. I’m just going to find them, but you’re moderately clever and we’ve got a moment, so let’s pass the time.” He squats down before her and resumes piecing together the puzzle for her, eager to see if she’s quite as clever as she seems.
motivation for abstaining to himself, the two have maintained a frustrating dedication to their task. In his more reasonable moments he’s endlessly appreciative, but during the peaks of his cravings... well, he’s decidedly
Inside, the club is loud and dimly-lit, bustling with young people laughing, nursing drinks and dancing along to the music blaring over the speakers. A large, garish neon sign dominates the wall behind the bar; the pink word ‘Bart's’ nestled between two bright palm trees. The young man meanders stiffly through the crowd, aloof eyes roving over every detail of information on offer.
He walks hesitantly, pausing now and again to peer into various shop-windows with a slightly overwhelmed expression. Behind him, the strains of a man and woman arguing grow closer, and he turns curiously toward the noise.
“Didn't think you were capable of miscalculating anything other than social situations.” John teases, before visibly transitioning back into Doctor mode with a small, firm shake of his head. “When did you stop taking them?” He moves his hand from Sherlock’s cheek to press two fingers against his pulse point. The continuing contact sets Sherlock's already fluttering heart to racing, and he squirms helplessly, squeezing his eyes shut to help focus as he responds.
So when Lestrade shows up with the case of the dead Alpha and his missing Omega, John’s eager for the distraction.
“Nine and a half days ago. I began feeling symptoms after about three days. But…it's too, ah…” Sherlock trails off, fighting against a creeping flush of mortification. He knows that it's foolish to feel embarrassed about this; he’s an adult and John is a medical professional. But he feels oddly exposed, discussing something so openly that he’s tried for so long to repress. “I shouldn't have gone into heat until next month at the earliest. Not according to my usual cycle.”
His body's grown used to John’s, and all the lovely things that it does to it. But he grits his teeth and follows through, refusing to allow John to continue to slavishly subject himself to his selfish desires. No— he’s above such neediness and physicality. He's lasted years without John's touch, and is perfectly capable of abstaining from it again until he's returned to a less ungainly state. It’s all just transport after all.
I wake to the silence in a cold sweat with my skin crawling.  I kick the blankets free before I can control myself.
John turns the spout to the side and runs the water until he has it at the right temperature.  The sound of the rushing water echoing around the basin sets my heart racing.  He uses a mug to wet my hair, just like he does for Rosie in the bath.  He starts on the left side of my head, as far away from the stitches as possible.  I tense automatically as the water runs through my hair.  I will myself to relax, I will my throat not to not lock up.  It takes every effort.
It’s ridiculous but so are most things he suggests, and he is already unbuttoning my shirt.  His tea forgotten on the edge of the tub.
“I’ve made you a sandwich, dear.”  She says as she comes in.  She takes my laptop off my knee and replaces it with a plate, on which is a sandwich on a bed of crisps.  She puts the laptop under her arm and gives me a look that says, ‘I know you’re not meant to be using that.’
““No, I wouldn’t expect… Damn.  I’m making such a mess of this.”  He says in a tight voice.  We a both on edge.  Terrible at this.
He takes a gulp of beer, then kisses me again.  I can taste the beer on his lips this time.  He breaks off and stands up, leaving me slightly logy.
I grab his beer off the table and sip at it while I wait for him.  He comes back with his medical kit and takes his drink back, takes a swallow and then passes it back to me.
I have serious trepidation about this, but what can I say?  ‘John you can’t wash my hair because I was tortured and now, I’m scared of getting my face wet.  Oh, it was, like, over five years ago and I just never bothered to mention it.’  No, better to just keep my mouth shut.  I’ve been doing better; I’ve hardly thought about it in ages and I trust John.  It will be ok.
I wake up and I don’t remember where I am.  Why does my head hurt so much?  I bring my hands up to cover my eyes; the light from the doorway is too bright.  My shoulder screams.  I do too.  I remind myself that I’m not in Serbia anymore.  Mycroft helped me escape.  Was that yesterday or the day before?  I look for the American man in the Hawaiian shirt.  The doctor: the one Mycroft brought along instead of John.  What was his name?  Doc, how original.  I call out for him.  He must not be too far away.  He has barely left the room since I woke up.
“I thought you didn’t care.”  I tell him, but I realise that I am so wrong.  That I have been so wrong for a long, long time
He scoffs.  “Even if you knew it was my fault?  Because it was my fault that I got caught.  I was impatient.  I wanted to come home.  It was so close to the end.  I took too many risks.  I put myself in that position.”
I shut the door behind me.  Slip off my coat and my shoes.  I take the letter and go to the mantelpiece.  I collect my knife and take it to my chair.  I turn the envelope over and over in my hand.  Cheap generic stationary, cheap blue ballpoint pen, stationary supplied by the nursing home, no doubt.  Shaky writing.  Closed with spit.  Smells musty, like the album.
I nearly shut the book there and then, but I decide to bask in my success.  I flip absently through the pages, hardly glancing at the photos.  I know them all anyway.
I sag with relief.  How can I be so lucky to be getting another chance?  After all the chance I have been given.  I know that I cannot bank on getting another one.  I really need to sort out my shit.  I need to never give him another reason to fear me.  I have been the source of far too many.  Why is that?  How is it that he is so capable of making my blood boil?  No one else has ever had that effect on me so often.  Except maybe Mary.  Maybe that’s the link.  The two people I love the most.
The room is silent, absent of Rosie’s snuffling snores.  John has been here for nearly a week and I am embarrassed that I don’t even know where Rosie is staying while my life implodes.  Perhaps she is downstairs with Mrs Hudson.
I’ve seen his skin; the marks that he never mentions.  I asked him about it once.  He told me he’d had a night with Irene Adler.  I had been so surprised by that that I nearly choked on my cuppa and then he changed the subject.  I don’t know if I believed it, even back then.  Not that they had been together, they might well have been, there was clearly some chemistry between them.  What I didn’t truly believe that she had left those marks on him.  Now, I am sure he was deflecting.  That he clearly did not want to talk about what had really happened.  Shit, it must have been bad.  He is private by nature, but to outright lie about it shows he really must have been motivation to avoid the subject.
“I’m still cold, warm me up.”  He requests   I don’t know whether he is or if he is just manipulating me.  He would never be so plain as to simply ask me to lay down with him.  Either way, it is a good excuse to spoon around him, one I would not miss.  I put my hand on his chest so I can feel every breath and every thrum of his heart.
He turns to Sherlock.  He is professional and calm as he introduces himself to Sherlock again.  “Hi there.”  He says touching Sherlock on his right forearm to get his attention.  I’m Doctor Pawson, I’m one of the doctors looking after you.  Can you open your eyes?”
Harry had always seemed to know she was gay.  From the age of fifteen she was out and open about her sexuality.  It never once seemed to bother her, even when she was teased or ridiculed, even when she got thrown out of bars for being there with another woman, even when she got bashed at a club by an irate guy she turned down with a snappy retort.  She just knew.  I thought I did too.  Now, I’m not so sure.  I wish it was as easy for me now as she made it seem back then.
John is snoring; it is rather loud.  Between the racket and the need to use the bathroom, going back to sleep isn’t an option.  How can John bare the long walk down to the loo at night?  Urgh, what a pain.  We will have to swap rooms eventually.
He takes a deep breath, blows it out.  Continues on, building up speed as he speaks.  “I’m struggling with it, a bit.  Quite a lot, truth be told.  I never considered that I might have feelings for a man that weren’t exactly… platonic.  I think what I’m trying to say, is that I would want us to be more than just friends, I just don’t know how to do that.  I don’t know if I can do that.  I don’t even know if you feel the same way.  It’s fine, if you don’t.”
„John, god damn it, do something!“ He demanded as he got pulled agonizingly slow down the stairs now. There was no room to stand up and he could only lie there and pull on his coat like an idiot. People were gathering around now and watching the pair as Sherlock lay there struggling against the metallic steps, trying to get the upper hand but it was no use. Sherlock grabbed now, pulling hard with his hands, his black leather gloves helping him get a better grip on the edges of his coat as it was there getting eaten by the esculator in front of his very eyes.
He grabbed sherlocks shoulders and pulled, but it did not work as he could not pull him up. Above their futile struggle, seemingly unaware of the surrounding world or simply uncaring, an old lady with a white cane now steps on the escalator to get to her destination. She is holding a cake.
„He is getting away Joh-!...“ Suddenly Sherlock got swept off his feet and got pulled back completely. -he was confused and bewildered as he realized he was stuck in the esculator, getting dragged down it on his back, further and further away from his goal which was now succeeding in fleeing the consulting detective. „what on earth…my coat!“ Sherlock pulled at the source of his discomfort, his great coat now stuck in the edge of the esculator in plain sight as if mocking him. He did NOT have time for this nonsense, the man was getting away! He almost roared in pure frustration and at the betrayal of his dearest fashion accessory, which has failed him so royally in a crucial time like this.
The old lady hears this and immediately starts beating on John with her cane now blindly, showing him no mercy. „Gah!“ -John looses his footing now in the escalator and accidentally pushes the woman and her cake over the rail into a water fountain down below with a loud splash. John sighs in relief, horrified at his own actions, but thankful at the same time to be rid of her.
Sherlock looks at his nemesis now under him, growling in annoyance. He stares up dumbly and then leans up in a kiss unexpectedly. „No, fuck off!“ Sherlock says to him and turns his head away. A news reporter is now recording them and Sherlocks deduces that John might throw up on him.
He groans and struggles as he slides down the moving stairs just like his opponent is doing, now the hems of his jackets getting stuck too and he is completely immobilized. He eventually moves down to the end of the escalator, sliding on top of his enemy in the most shameful manner, stuck like that on top of him now. „John!“ Sherlock looks over his own shoulder trying to get help from his best friend. John comes running down towards him but trips and knocks himself out! Eventually John also slides of top of Sherlock and his enemy as they lie there stuck in a sandwich. .
John looks down at where Sherlock is still struggling, almost having reached the bottom of the escalator now but they are not yet out of danger it appears. John looks up and sees to his utmost  horror that the blind old ladies club is coming down the stairs now straight out of the bakery. Sherlock finally manages to break free now and stands up victoriously!
Sherlock jumped on the esculator  swift on his feet and it was at that very moment the man they were chasing made eye contact. He looked straight at the pair and grinned a toothy grin, as if he knew they had been on his heels this whole time, simply toying with them. The look on his face was primal, predatory even as he promised with his eyes alone that they would regret ever crossing his path.
The crowd gasps and parents cover their children’s eyes. The murder suspect covers his mouth laughing at their misfortune, now having the time of his life clearly.
Sherlock smirked to himself as his pale blue eyes studied the man up and down from a safe distance, hidden by the crowds going on about their daily lives completely unaware of the monster among them.
He immediately looks up to the suspect that had been too vain to make his escape, having wanted to watch the events unfold on his enemy. The man visibly gulps and then backs into the crowd again ready to make a run for it. Sherlock runs up the escalator towards the man amongside John, showing old ladies and their cakes out of the way. „Move you old hags!“ Sherlock yells having lost his patience long ago as he bolts up the stairs and runs at the murder suspect whom now is retreating.
” John exclaims, tea sloshing over the rim of his mug as he startles. He dabs half-heartedly at the newly damp knee of his trousers and leans forward to thump the mug down on the coffee table with an irate huff. Mycroft very nearly loses his grasp on his own mug, but manages to retain it, only the small rattle of cup against saucer betraying his fumble.
John nearly rolls his eyes, but thankfully manages to maintain an outer calm. The last thing he needs is for someone to catch him both setting off the alarm
All things considered, he thinks he’s doing a rather excellent job of affecting nonchalance, especially given the veritable miasma of anxiety wafting off of John. At least one of them has to keep up appearances if they have any hope of manipulating Mycroft into agreement.
“You’ve a fiancé,” he reminds Sherlock with a hint of amusement, as if perhaps he’s possibly forgotten the fact.
“Hello Mycroft. Lord Wycombe, Fitzmaurice.” He smiles smugly before swanning from John’s lap to slouch against the arm of the chair, casually crossing his ankles as he makes introductions. “John, might I introduce you to my brother; the Duke of Westminster, and the Earl of Wycombe and his son, the Viscount Fitzmaurice; my intended betrothed.”
He builds his courage slowly; first draping his feet over John’s lap, or tucking his toes beneath a warm, sturdy thigh. With each successive evening in which John
“Mm,” Sherlock hums for lack of a better response, the fight going out of him immediately as his Omega fights its way to the forefront if his mind and frantically reminds him of the fact he needs to secure John's
“You berk. Fair enough.” John huffs, hitching Sherlock’s knee up over his right arm as he braces himself down on his left. “Suppose we can always roll over it gets too much.” Sherlock wraps his arms around John’s shoulders, pulling him close, and lifts his legs to encompass his waist.
“Okay, that’s actually pretty unusual.” John’s voice takes on a concerned note again, and Sherlock doesn't even need to open his eyes to know that he's frowning. He finishes assessing Sherlock’s heart rate, but he doesn’t pull his hand away, just leaves it resting over his collarbone. Sherlock’s certain it’s meant to be comforting, but it’s anything but. Even the casual contact between their bodies feels maddening.
“I’m not.” John states matter-of-factly, and Sherlock’s heart thumps anxiously against his sternum over the neutral tone.
“She doesn’t want anything.” Sherlock turns back to face him slowly, eyebrows arching delicately with renewed interest. Mycroft raises his own brows in a subtle challenge. “She got in touch, she informed us that the photographs existed, she indicated that she had no intention to use them to extort either money or favour.”
“And yet here you are,” Sherlock replies. A crooked, bashful smile of his own tugs at the corners of his mouth, as the first hesitant stirrings of hope start up inside his chest. John tilts his head agreeably, his grin growing impossibly brighter and warmer. So bright, in fact, that it’s almost painful to look at.
“It was,” Sherlock acknowledges with a small twitch of his lips. “Scotland Yard would have almost certainly fallen for it. Pity for you that they called me in on it. To be entirely honest, I might not have quite put it together myself if it weren’t for the baby.”
“I’m certain that whatever you like yourself would more than suffice in that… area. But I don’t expect you to, um
pleased.” Mycroft pauses for effect, casting a disparaging eye around the room. “Well, to see you finally settled at least.”
John joins in with a low chuckle, reaching discreetly with his free hand to gingerly make an adjustment in his own lap. He doesn’t mention it— doesn’t draw attention to it in the slightest— but Sherlock’s eyes flick unconsciously to the movement, and he finds himself pressing his teeth into his lower lip. Ever considerate John, carefully obscuring his own involuntary arousal, so as not to make Sherlock feel any more self-conscious than he already does. The thoughtfulness inexplicably causes that unnamed something inside his abdomen to throb again.
“Is that so?” John moves the phone to his shoulder as he surveys the sparsely populated fridge of Harry’s new flat for dinner possibilities of his own. “Should I be worried Mrs. Watson?”
“Expecting? Expecting what?” Lestrade cuts him off with a look of alarm. “Oh god, please tell me someone hasn’t threatened to sue again.”
John leans against the kitchen doorframe and levels a long look at him. “Oh, okay then,” he agrees dryly, “
“Why would I want to have dinner if I wasn’t hungry?” He feigns ignorance and slides forward slightly in his seat, twisting his hand in her grasp to press his fingers against her wrist. Irene’s leans forward on her knees, her gaze fixedly pointedly on his mouth.
“Lord Sherlock,” John bows respectfully, then rights himself with his cane. “Forgive me, but how did you know?”
It wouldn’t be false to define it as such; an experiment on both his own nature and the worth of sentiment. He inclines his head in agreement.
of bother, and you know it. As John and I are unbonded, in the eyes of our noble judiciary I’ll be giving
Sherlock frowns and looks down in surprise to where his hand has instinctively come to rest, in a protective gesture, over his abdomen.
“As you command,” Stamford draws himself upright and taps his heels together in a mock salute. He cocks his head toward a nearby doorway. “This way Watson. The library here is well-appointed, and open to all, though most forgo it in favour of dancing and gossip.”
“I don't know how to do this,” Sherlock mumbles insecurely, removing his hands from his pockets. His fingers clench and unclench anxiously at his sides.
fancied herself in love him, that hardly meant that he had to return the sentiment. Why would he? He can understand Mycroft’s delusion on the matter; given his quaint assumptions about both Sherlock’s chastity, and experience with… interpersonal relations. But as to why
“You’ve known since the Cavendish case, haven’t you,” John sighs, rubbing his palms against the arms of his chair and staring down at the hearth. “When I pointed out that Marie was probably pregnant, and you sort of… shut down.”
“You’re serious.” The Duke leans back in his chair, visibly incredulous. His eyes narrow. “And if I were to do as you say, and draw up a contract this very moment, ensuring that not so much as a sixpence goes toward anything besides his keeping, you would not protest?”
“Sorry—" John pauses in his perusal of the eccentric collection of clutter blanketing the table in the center of the room. "You stopped her husband being executed?”
“John,” Sherlock whines plaintively as he attempts to follow. He grasps John’s hand in his own and drags it downward to press it against the hard bulge in the front of his pantaloons, as he had in the library. “I want you so badly.”
appetites— but you suspect that it’s much more than just a fling. He always wanted children and you never cared for them, so you’re worried he's going to leave you to start a family with his young lover.” He doubles over to clutch at his middle when another labour pain comes on. “You’re right by the way,” he adds between pants. “He is.”
it that no one ever expects John's stubborn streak? He may be recognized as an Alpha, but his inclination to behave like one seems to be constantly underestimated.
To John it seems as if mere moments have passed when a footman appears at Sherlock’s shoulder, leaning down to whisper in the omega’s ear. John spares a glance at the mantle clock and is startled to find it gone midnight. Sherlock pouts slightly at the man’s words but obediently rises from his seat regardless. John and Stamford respectfully follow suit.
He’s so wrapped up in his own thoughts that he’s caught off guard when Irene Adler struts into her sitting room. She’s reeking of unsuppressed Alpha pheromones and wearing nothing but a wicked smile, and Sherlock finds himself momentarily stunned. It’s partially owing to his own completely unavoidable biological reaction to her scent
The words settle over and about John as he considers them, like the gentle embrace of warm counterpane. Indeed, had things gone differently, Sherlock might very well be long since bonded; already in the midst of his confinement with some other alpha’s heir.
This synopsis of their current circumstances catches him off guard, and he ruminates on it briefly, weighing the evidence.
“You were sick after eating this morning!’ John argues in return, pressing the edge of the plate insistently against Sherlock’s crossed arms. Alright, so he had been
Lestrade is in the midst of helping John stagger upright in the depths of an overflowing skip beneath the fire escape, while the third officer presides over a groaning lump whom Sherlock assumes is one Timothy Beckett. When Lestrade catches sight of Sherlock he lets out a sigh of relief.
Sherlock wrinkles his nose in mild distaste and moves away from her to sit across from John at the table. No need to feed into
“We haven’t engaged in intercourse since the child’s conception, and will certainly not be doing so again. Besides, as you well know, a heat is required for bonding to take place. And I’m hardly about to return to the appallingly untenable lifestyle of managing heat cycles after the child is weaned.”
“Well, that hardly matters for an Omega,” Sherlock snaps back with no small amount of bitterness, and John has no good argument to present in reply to that.
Sherlock finally emerges just as the kettle clicks off, immaculately dressed and perfectly coiffed, looking like nothing so much as a bloody advert for Savile Row. He swans into his usual chair at the table silently, and as John fixes their tea he catches himself staring out the corner of his eye, trying and failing to suppress the incredulous mantra of
“Fuck, Sherlock,” John pants urgently after a short while, the frantic pace of his thrusts growing shaky and uneven. “It's been too long... I’m gonna—“ He grimaces, and bites his lip, a deep flush staining his face ruddy. Three more hard thrusts and his body tenses, hips stuttering to a jerky stop. He tucks his face into Sherlock’s neck with a sob, arms trembling as his hips make tiny involuntary twitches forward. Sherlock feels the accompanying gush of heat inside himself and moans brokenly, sinking his teeth into the curve of shoulder beneath his lips.
Infinitely better; refocusing on the case is just what he needs to get his mind back on track. As he reads, the phone buzzes again. Then again, and again.
His mouth goes dry with anxiety as his thoughts veer off, and he takes a sip of tea to wet it enough to continue. “You can just… delete it, yeah?”
Head tilt forgotten entirely, Sherlock watches the exchange from behind his dishcloth, utterly agape and helplessly transfixed by the sight of John lathered into a fury in his defense; his traitorous inner Omega practically
“So, are you going to wear a dress?” He asks her cheekily, and she giggles again, shaking her head ruefully.
He tucks his chin in contemptuously, not unlike that of an offended turtle. He’d assumed from her silence throughout the drive that his scent hadn’t yet grown distinct enough for her to detect through the small openings in the safety partition. Clearly, however, he's progressed somewhat farther along than he’d gauged.
“I believe also mentioned that my suppressants were responsible for the disparity in my libido, which is quite clearly not an issue at this point in time.”
.” He rolls his face toward the other man, his breath slowing as the laughter peters off. “Why’d you tell me six?”
. “I heard you, don’t bother denying it. You need something in you before we leave the flat, or you’re going to collapse. Doctor’s orders.”
“Yes. I do believe we covered that. And neither have you. You know how much I abhor repetition.” Sherlock replies without even looking up at John. He feels a flush creeping up the back of his neck. He can’t recall undoing his own bloody trousers ever being this difficult. His fingers feel oddly thick and clumsy— as though finer motor control is quite beyond them.
” He gasps in pleased surprise, leaning his forehead against Sherlock’s milky thigh to watch his fingers work. “Does that feel good?”
Downstairs the front door opens and shuts, the distinct tap of an umbrella accompanying the footsteps that make their way to the base of the stairs. He draws in a deep, bracing breath through his nose as they reach the stairs and opens his eyes.
He imagines it for a moment: all the same scents and sounds, but with addition of a small infant's delighted burble. It's surprisingly easy. He doesn’t know why, but he imagines that John will talk to their child, long before they can truly comprehend. Replying to their burbles as if carrying on a very important conversation and, in all likelihood, good-naturedly complaining about some misbehavior or experiment of Sherlock’s. The thought brings a smile to his face.
A poorly-timed raid on Beckett and his mother’s home had turned up his little collection of gruesome souvenirs, but the man himself had gone to ground.
“Oh thank god.” John releases a puff of air with the words and the rigidity drains out of his body again. “I’d thought that maybe… well. As much as it pains me to say this, thank goodness for Mycroft’s interference.”
John had made them a full English, and after the startlingly vigorous activities of the previous two days, Sherlock had found himself surprisingly famished. Once they’d both devoured their meals, they’d sat, awkwardly sipping their tea and studiously avoiding eye contact. Sherlock had been mentally reciting his statement, in an attempt to galvanize himself, when John had broken the silence.
“Oh.” John blushes and ducks his head a little. Absolutely absurd, considering where his hands and mouth have just been, but painfully endearing nonetheless. “Yeah, that’s uh, good.” He shuffles forward on his knees between Sherlock’s legs, then hesitates. “Are you sure? Afterward we’ll be…”
“No! What are you doing? There’s nothing to run from now!” Sherlock tried keeping his grip but John eventually got free, barely giving Sherlock enough time to grab hold of his arm.
“Nothing. Nothing, here, let me get that for you.” John grabbed a dust pan and swept up the mug pieces.
Sherlock smiled from where he had been leaning against the wall. John needed looking after, and admittedly, he had missed the DI as well. Perhaps it was time he started branching out and trying to contact others.
"Well you broke the beaker. But yes, there are several positives. You don't have to buy food anymore since you fill up on crumbs, we don't need to pay rent for two rooms, you wont have to chase me down an ally or rather I wont have to look back to make sure you are following, and I'll always know where you are." Sherlock smiled.
“Odd.” John’s heart sped up a bit. In his dream where he was drowning, there always seemed to be storm. He had never feared the water or bad weather before, but these dreams were relentless.
John took one look inside the flat and found he was able to regain his footing if only momentarily. “Kitty!”
John found the tapered edge of the tentacle and slowly started to pry it off. The grip immediately loosened, Sherlock’s full attention on the rain now. “We can get you everything you need, food, water, whatever. Just stay here with me?” He made the mistake of stroking his hand a bit over tentacle’s tip.
“Erm, Mr. Holmes?” he took a step closer but was still a good distance away. The forensics team had already started dusting for prints and looking for any scrap of evidence as to what happened that they could find.
Lestrdae bit his lower lip nervously; at least he was pretty sure it was still him. He reached out, lacing his hand with Mycroft’s. He could swear those solid black eyes softened at that.
John cleared his throat loudly. Thank goodness Lestrade had offered to spend the night with him, not that he wanted to admit that he was already getting spooked. But now that ghosts were more then something in a cheesy horror film to him, he didn’t really want to find out if there were vile spirits floating around the world. Especially in bedrooms he planned on sleeping in. “Well, I’m sure it will all be sorted out soon enough.”
No, he couldn’t do that. Neither of these men mattered, only Sherlock did. He would gather his calm and do the only thing he thought he could do. Lie.
It was just past midnight when John decided to turn the telly off and bid his flatmate goodnight. Sherlock often stayed up into the wee hours of the evening working on various experiments, John gave up learning what they all were. He didn't mind so long as Sherlock didn't blow anything up, although the body parts in the fridge often enraged him as well.
Sherlock’s head whipped around just in time to see someone, perhaps something mere meters away from them. It was humanoid, but entirely cast in inky shadow.
Usually the emails by this point came twice daily, sometimes more. This time two days passed without one. Molly was worried she had said too much.
"Careful!" John didn't want anyone to know this had happened to him, but it was especially frustrating that he was tossed all over the place.
Sherlock scrunched his nose in defeat, “Well, it might also…” the rest of his sentence became an unrecognizable mumble “Not a big deal.”
When Mrs. Hudson came home she heard an assortment of odd noises coming from upstairs. She knew John hadn’t been home in nearly two months despite paying the rent.
“So you wouldn’t mind if I got ride of the skull-“ John’s voice was breathy as he leaned his head against Sherlock’s pale forehead, knowing he had caught Sherlock in a lie.
“No, I don’t. I’m not the John Watson you think I am.” John turned to leave; it would be the last crime scene he ever showed up at.
“Shit, you two better take a look at this” Lestrade uncapped the coffee cup and brought the two miniature men out to see the damage.
Every case that Greg had gotten in the past few days he wanted to run by the consulting detective, only to remember that those days were far gone. He knew that Sherlock had his problems. But suicide? It hardly seemed like him at all. He had lived a risky lifestyle, not just chasing down criminals but the drug abuse as well. But even then, Greg couldn’t fathom that he wanted to end things. Especially since life had finally begun looking up for him. He had friends, himself included. Even a best friend. Lestrade refused to believe the things the press had been printing about him. That he was a fraud that made up being a genius. Those people didn’t know him, couldn’t know the real Sherlock Holmes. But Lestrade knew. Sherlock was an absolute genius that could solve nearly any case. If only someone was smart enough to solve the late detective’s death.
John looked around. There was nothing that would have caused it to just open like that. Could it have been? “S-Sherlock? Is that… is that you?” Did he want him to investigate it further?
John sighed. Sherlock would be Sherlock no matter what state he was in. He smiled all the same when the long pale hand came down beside him offering a lift.
Tears were rolling down John’s face, “I just want to be with you. Please Sherlock, just let me. I need this. I need you. I can’t keep going without you Lock.”
Mycroft considered his options, he wasn’t joking when he had told John all that time ago that he worried about Sherlock constantly. As much as they bickered he was still his little brother and he would be damned if he let anything happen to him knowing he could prevent it. Even now he noticed Sherlock wore a miniature blue scarf in placement of the one he wore almost daily. Mycroft highly doubted his brother had ever told a soul that the original has been a gift from him when Sherlock was in high school and got a cold. Mycroft knew Sherlock was only sick because he never took care of himself, he didn’t even own a scarf before that not realizing he needed the added warmth on cold days. It was why through all of Sherlock’s cutting remarks about his weight and intelligence he knew his brother secretly cared as well.
John knew from his expression he had just solved the case, or least had a major break through in it. His whole body was suddenly surrounded by ten long swooping digits.
“Whoa whoa whoa, I am not killing someone Sherlock! I refuse to take part in this again if you so much as suggest I-“
Lestrade nodded. “You’ve been sleeping in his bed, haven’t you?” It wasn’t judgmental, just a statement of fact.
“Er, yea, just out in the hall.” Greg quickly moved to grab the bags, feeling more then a bit embarrassed that he had brought the violin. What if John was more triggered by it then comforted?
Sherlock was now fascinated about every aspect of John, he was just so unbelievably small. His actions and expressions so fragile. Sherlock felt his face warming and turned away.
Sherlock tried blinking, there was something moving inside one of the wooden rooms but he couldn’t make out what it was through the tiny window. The rat sniffed around and began walking about the clear room he had been freed in. The movement was so fast that it barely registered in Sherlock’s mind. The creature bolted out of the wooden room and into the clear one attacking it’s prey at lightning speeds. The bite was deep and steady but the rat still kicked it’s hind feet in a desperate last attempt to get away. The long hair legs wound themselves around the rat quickly and hauled it back to the wooden room next to it to feed.
Sherlock had run out of deductions about the body from the lake house, there was simply nothing left to deduce about it. He had let go of John who remained silent and solemn where he sat on the counter. Sherlock stood and raised his hands so the palms touched just under his chin in his preferred thinking pose.
“Well how am I supposed to know. Frankly there’s a slight gap in my memory from how we got here and I don’t like it one bit.”
“You don’t know what you’re doing do you?” It sounded sweet coming from him, not harsh like when a police officer accused Sherlock of not knowing what he was doing, but that had been the only context anyone had ever used the line on him before, as an accusation.
John’s teeth chattered as his jar shook, every second brought him a bit more off the ledge. He tried standing at the far end in hopes of balancing the glass as long as possible.
“John!” he pounds up the stairs to John’s room and walks in, he’s asleep in his bed, looking distraught.
221B was in a chaotic mess of over turned furniture, ripped apart drawers, and paper strewn across the floor everywhere.
Curiosity got the better of the doctor. “What other things can you do?” really he should have known better then to ask that.
“You do?” The tension immediately left John’s voice again. “I mean, good. I… I just don’t want to not hear from you and start worrying is all.” End up like Greg pinning over him.
“It doesn’t matter how much someone drinks! That only affects the amount of time it takes!” Moriarty had gone over Sherlock’s notes on the chemical profusely.
“Ah, that must be Lestrade” Sherlock brought out his own phone in an attempt to mask the evidence against his flatmate.
“More,” he manages to force out on a gasp, arching his hips more sharply backward to provide John’s fingers greater access. “Please.”
The rattle of the fire escape draws Sherlock’s attention, and he casts a look over his shoulder to find John cautiously peering over at him, his face a mask of alarm.
Sherlock replies dumbly, all higher thought evaporating in the heat of John’s gaze. He hadn't thought… It had never even
“Hmm, yours too.” John hums, “Like… smoke, and pipe tobacco, and a hint of something tangy, but sweet— blood oranges maybe? Smells good. A little too good,” he gestures down to the incredibly obvious bulge in his trousers, finally acknowledging the elephant in the room. “Sorry about that.” He blinks rapidly, looking a tad gobsmacked. “I have
"Yes," he twists in his seat to face John. He tugs off one buttery-soft leather glove and extends his naked palm. "Give me your phone."
“What I mean to say is that... It will be endlessly interesting to document what traits and behaviours they inherit from you, as opposed to myself. They may even exhibit a mixture of characteristics! And there are further possibilities based upon our input…” he trails off momentarily, his mind caught up in envisioning it for the first time, entirely free from anxiety. Finally unsuppressed or dampened, excitement doesn’t so much creep as
“I’ve been asking this one,” the Alpha gestures to Mrs. Hudson with the muzzle of his gun. “She doesn’t seem to know anything.” Sherlock’s eyes catch on a tear on the shoulder of her cardigan as the man continues, then the small cut on her cheek. He flicks his eyes to the ring on the Alpha’s gun hand, and the droplet of blood still congealing in the setting. He stares at it, feeling the slow roil of rage inside of him as the man continues. “But you know what I’m asking for, don’t you, Mr Holmes?”
time is pretty bloody unusual,” John points out with an amused quirk of his lips. Sherlock inclines his head in consensus, flipping through the remaining stills. Sure enough, the second-to-last capture features a slightly fuzzy view of one of the tall french windows of the lounge area leading to the pool deck. Just visible through behind the gauzy curtains are Eddie and Marie, Philip's limp form slung between themselves. The final image is of Eddie alone; frozen in the act of lowering himself back down from Marie’s window ledge, just before six.
Sherlock’s heart takes up residence in his throat at the suggestion, and he swallows against the painful thump.
“Well, no one knows about even half the shite I get up to,” John shares in turn, hopping up to perch next to him, sitting close enough that their shoulders and thighs brush together. ”With your folks, though, it's from a place of love, right? They worry.”
When he gets arrives home to Baker Street, the screeching of Sherlock’s violin assaults his ears the moment he opens the street door.

John isn’t terribly pleased about being awoken so abruptly, muzzily squinting up at Sherlock from his pillow when the detective gently jostles his shoulder.
— I could argue with them until I get my way, but I simply do not have time to deal with it at the moment.”
the attention that it requires at the moment. With an immense effort, he shoves into a corner in his mind and refocuses himself with determination on the matter at hand.
“Wait,” he gasps, pulling back. Sherlock sways forward in a fruitless attempt to follow and reclaim John’s mouth with his own. John loosens his fingers and spreads them wide against the flat of Sherlock’s chest. “Maybe we shouldn’t, um, dive into anything too hastily.”
experience could scarcely hold a candle to their visit to the prestigious clinic on Harley Street that Mycroft had insisted upon.
Either way, it sets John’s teeth on edge. More than anything, he just needs to escape the flat; to escape Irene Adler and her smug, cat-like presence. He texts Stamford and arranges to meet him at the pub for a pint. It takes some time, but he manages to locate his keys in the kitchen, beneath a pile of mangled… circuit boards? He’s not sure he wants to know what Sherlock’s going to attempt to do with those.
Try as he might, he can’t find it in him to even be irritated with Sherlock over their infiltration of Baskerville.
Absolutely ridiculous of him in hindsight; John Watson is, after all, a doctor and caregiver first and foremost. Clearly the pregnancy hormones have been interfering with his reasoning.
control when he does it, some sort of measures will have to be taken. He reaches for his mobile and begins scanning through all the available data he can find. He needn’t discontinue his suppressants immediately— it's apparently common practice for newly expectant carriers to gradually reduce dosage over time, to prevent extreme hormonal fluctuations.
He sighs and turns the screen back off without replying, dropping it back onto the coverlet before he foists himself up off of the bed.
“That,” he giggles uncontrollably, “wasn’t just me.” He turns to look at Sherlock with a curious smile as something occurs to him. “Why aren’t we back at the restaurant?”
always been fairly susceptible to Sherlock’s arguments; if he chooses the right time to broach the subject and presents it well, it should be quite simple to argue his case for keeping the child.
you’ve noticed that my living situation and lifestyle is remarkably unusual as compared to most Omegas“
When everyone assumes you’ve had a do-over for every less than perfect moment of your life, on the other hand, nothing you achieve is all that impressive. And your failures?
he means he quit taking them as an experiment, and quite predictably went into rebound heat.” John interrupts to add, clearly past the initial embarrassment of his verbal blunder, and over his fear of Mycroft’s potential retribution. Well, he supposes that seeing Mycroft in person
Surrounded by a sea of gaudy nineteen-eighties fashion, his black overcoat is even more curiously conspicuous indoors than it had been outside. Men and women alike turn their heads as he drifts along, drawn by both his unusual attire and his beautifully sculpted face. He pays them no mind, ice blue eyes never lingering on any one person for more than a handful of seconds before moving on.He orders himself a tonic water to occupy his hands, and finally in a booth in a mirrored back corner of the bar he spots what he’s been hunting for.
There’s no crime scene to investigate as of yet; the Cavendish Omega having been pulled off the street and into an commonplace grey sedan with obscured plates whilst shopping. The ransom note that arrived at the house shortly thereafter was similarly unremarkable: typed and printed on ordinary printer paper, delivered by a teenage boy who’d received anonymous instruction online. Whoever was responsible had taken care to remain as untraceable as possible.
He’s off before anyone can stop him, exploding from the back of the van and breaking into a run down the street while Donovan shouts after him. He rounds the corner quickly, coming to a stumbling halt as he comes face to face with the heavy black gate closing off the small car park to the back of the building. He’s just determining how best to scale the smooth steel when the clang of a metal door crashing open sounds out somewhere up above.
Despite his brief experimental foray, Sherlock has never been overly interested in the intricacies of copulation and gender dynamics. A basic understanding of sexual relations was useful for the work, but given how unbelievably mundane it all was, he’d never bothered to take his research any deeper. John, on the other hand, had a manifest interest in such matters, and as a Doctor, a greater insight on the pertinent physiological details. Brilliant! Perhaps he’d be able to corroborate some long discarded hypotheses for Sherlock.

“There you are, brother mine,” he murmurs quietly, brushing his fingers affectionately over the new cell’s closest neighbour; SJ 221B - 1908. “I trust the good doctor will keep a close eye on you. Though
“Good afternoon, Detective Inspector,” Edward rises smoothly when the Butler shows them inside and announces them, holding out a hand in greeting.
I found I was unable to take the risk that you… you might leave.” He lifts his eyes anxiously to meet John’s shell-shocked gaze.
Sherlock stares down at her in complete bewilderment, and is relieved to see that John looks even more befuddled than himself.
“Right,” John says, his expression more warm and open than Sherlock’s ever seen it. “Well, I’m going to, uh…” He waves a hand over himself then rises from the couch, carefully wrapping the afghan around his waist as he does, and begins collecting the rumpled clothing scattered over the floor and coffee table. “And then, tea?”
As if Sherlock’s eating habits weren’t already lackluster, they grow worse over the next few weeks following Irene’s demise. He rarely, if ever, touches the breakfasts that John or Mrs. Hudson present him with, and picks at his dinners even more disinterestedly than usual. John tries to reason with him that he can hardly subsist on tea alone, but his pleas go unacknowledged.
“My heart weeps for you,” John fires back dryly. “But take it from me— Hamish isn’t any better. You can’t even shorten it! And then you have this tiny baby with a name that makes him sound like he’s ninety. At the very least, if you’re going to insist on something so ridiculously old fashioned, you could choose something with a decent byname!”
the blood rush to his face. His heart flutters in his chest over the unintended slip, and his eyes shoot sidelong to John, anxiously gauging his reaction. Thankfully, neither John and Lestrade seem to think anything of it, apparently misinterpreting the comment entirely. John casts his gaze skyward, sighing dramatically.
Sherlock jolts with surprise when he feels a socked foot brush his ankle, working itself beneath the hem of his trousers. Heat floods his cheeks, and across the table, John smiles innocently over the rim of his glass as he sips his wine.
at him right now, the game will very immediately be up. Considering Mycroft’s likely reaction would be, the gesture would hardly end up being very comforting to John at all. So he keeps his hands and eyes to himself, and listens impassively to Mycroft as he continues blathering on.
gift had been the ability to draw a perfect circle every go, but that’s hardly what anyone remembers him for.
“There you are Dr. Watson!” She greets the man with a bubbly smile as she trots over to join him at the kerb. “I just had to finish signing out one of the travel pods for us. Don’t you look sharp,” she comments warmly, taking in in his neat cardigan and button-down shirt. “It’s lovely to see you so excited! The trip shouldn’t take us more than an hour and half, and we’ve the pod until six o’clock, so that leaves us
“Well, alright then,” he speaks up suddenly one peaceful Friday evening, startling the young nurse, companionably perusing a magazine in the armchair across from him.
“It's an alpha,” Sherlock announces, throwing down his trump card as he swoops from his chair to collect his violin from its case.
Unable to roll over to face his new mate, Sherlock presses himself backward as best he’s able, turning his head to nuzzle at John’s cheek.
They’ll hardly make any progress if they spend the entire afternoon trying to see which of them is more stubborn.
“What?” He freezes, turning to John in surprise. The doctor is cradling his chin thoughtfully in one hand as he considers the evidence scattered across the desk, but when Sherlock turns to him, he glances up and smiles. Sherlock ignores the odd flutter that the smile triggers in his belly, drawing his eyebrows together and frowning instead.
“Ah.” John blanches, the gears in his head almost audibly whirring, and his body goes suddenly stiff. “Was it- it wasn’t while you were… using, was it?”
“Mm,” John hums in approval at the discovery that Sherlock hasn’t any pants underneath his bottoms. He runs his palms appreciatively up Sherlock bare thighs, stooping to press an open-mouthed kiss to the sensitive skin before clambering up on the bed. “Smarter than I look.”
When John pesters him for the details about the rabbit as they leave, and implies that Sherlock’s coat and cheekbones make him look cool and mysterious, his Omega can’t help but preen delightedly, despite Sherlock’s flustered outward denial. He can’t recall a more pleasantly diverting afternoon in recent memory.
at least.” He sips at his tea and frowns, mulling over whether or not to share his latest discovery on the very subject. “That being said,” he clears his throat delicately, “it’s recently come to my attention that he perhaps never
Watching John crumple in on himself in front if him, Sherlock has a blinding moment of clarity: this is his only chance. Right now, this moment; if he lets it slip away, lets John explain it away — retreat back behind his impenetrable fortress of British stoicism — it will never come back again.
“Round back,” Lestrade tilts his head toward the small alleyway to the side of the building and begins leading the way as soon John joins them. “There’s a Christian ministry that runs out of one of the suites upstairs. One of the staff found it when she brought down the rubbish after a prayer meeting. All carved up, just like the two in Islington last month.”
“Mm,” Mycroft lowers his gaze back to his phone and hums with polite disinterest, saving Sherlock from further embarrassment. Sherlock squirms in his seat, loathe to disrupt the polite fiction of his independence.
Just because some ridiculous, backward la— ” Sherlock cuts him off with a staying hand before he can work himself into a lather.
“No Sherlock. We agreed— if you want to do this, we’ll do it. But if you’re going to take unnecessary risks with our child’s life before they're even born, you need to consider whether this is something we really
So it’s a welcome enough diversion when an old schoolmate calls his name in the park, in spite of the humiliation of being seen as he is now; a crippled shadow of his former self.
... It's real,” he gestures to the world around them at large. Then he take John's hands and brings them up to frame his own face, folding his own hands over them to keep them in place. “
And anyways, so far as addictive substances go, caffeine is really quite low on the list of his poor habits.
“Are you jealous?” She smirks; that same goddamn smirk as always, the one that says she’s better, smarter, more Alpha-like than him, and she knows it.
“Hey you,” John murmurs, pushing up onto his toes to brush their lips together in a warm kiss hello. “And you,” he adds with a glance downward to where he's braced a gentle palm against Sherlock’s belly.
As promised, John joins him an uncomfortably cold quarter hour later and exchanges the peas for a steaming mug of tea. Sherlock sips delicately as John returns the peas to the icebox, savouring the delicious warmth after the chill of the makeshift icepack. Before John seats himself to enjoy his own tea, he carefully checks Sherlock’s face over one more time, cradling his jaw in his fingers to tilt it this way and that. Sherlock lets his eyes drift shut for a moment, savouring the soothing sensation of John’s touch, just as much as he had the hot tea.
seem more to your taste than usual.” Sherlock offers as dryly as he can manage, only to see John’s face light up with mirth; his laughter sounding out an encore as they reach the end of the hall. John presses Sherlock up against his bedroom door to kiss him again, running his hands down along Sherlock’s ribs to clutch at his hips. Once he’s snogged Sherlock well and truly breathless, he trails his lips down to mouth along the taller man’s jawline.
"Y-yes," Sherlock pants, bearing down with his inner muscles to squeeze John in turn, making the alpha hiss appreciatively.
He strides back to the fireplace and runs his fingers beneath the mantelpiece, searching out the switch he’d suspected the presence of earlier. The mirror glides upward, revealing the safe hidden behind it, and he turns to look mockingly back at her. “Really hope you don’t have a baby in here. I mean, there’s subverting Alpha stereotypes, and then there’s just being terrible at it.”
“The same way that I know the victim was an excellent sportsman, recently returned from foreign travel and that the photographs I’m looking for are in this room.”
“So you slept with him… as an experiment?” John concludes incredulously, eyebrows drawing back together again as he visibly digests the information. It’s really a wonder that the wrinkle between his eyes isn’t significantly more pronounced, with how often he repeats the action.
Sherlock likewise avoids thinking about the actual occasion in question as much as possible. The doorbell continues to ring insistently, in a preposterously irritating manner. He swivels his head to shout angrily down at it.
inaccurate either,” Sherlock acknowledges with a pleased curl of his lips. John’s own simple sort of observation, while nothing at all like his own, is so often charmingly clever in it’s own way. “I began taking suppressants shortly after I presented, and the dosage has always substantially subdued my libido. Later, the addition of more...
“Officer in need of assistance!” A garbled voice shouts over a frenetic background din. “All units respond! Suspect headed toward the east exit of the building— armed and extremely dangerous!”
Sherlock swallows, forcing down the sudden swell of primal emotion, and smiles coolly at his brother. “There will be no hazard to my health whatsoever as I have no intentions to ‘resolve’ the situation, as you so tactfully put it.”
John’s face lights up in pleased surprised at the endorsement, and Sherlock covertly savours the sight as he returns to his confessional tale. “As I was saying— he was bright and not at all unattractive, and to my complete surprise, I grew to enjoy his company. Despite my expectations.” Sherlock quirks the corner of his mouth in a smile as his fondest memory of his time with Victor comes to mind. “Also, Fairfax and I became quite stalwart companions— once we overcame the unpleasantness of our initial encounter.”
Sherlock hums agreeably and resumes poking at his own breakfast with a good degree less enthusiasm. He ruminates on the one glaring issue he has with John’s plans, and for the first time considers the merit of simply being honest with John about it. It’s seemed to be… surprisingly less disastrous than expected thus far. He carefully swallows his mouthful of egg and quickly speaks before he can think better of it.
When Mycroft fails to respond with a witty rejoinder, submissively lowering his eyes and turning away, the bottom of Sherlock’s stomach swoops away. Shame burns hot and heavy in his belly, and the Omega inside of him curls up miserably in contrition over having failed their kin.
, John refusing to do little more than press his hips up slightly at the very peak of penetration, forcing Sherlock to do all the work to get himself off. It’s the most torturous,
