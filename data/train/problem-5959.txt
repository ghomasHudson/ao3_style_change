Tony had asked him countless times now whether he could also hear the faint buzzing sound sometimes. Steve told him he didn't, but he heard other voices. Tony had been hearing voices too. But they lingered for a few minutes before fading away. That night, they were louder and felt closer. He couldn't understand what they were saying. Tony woke up with a start and turned to look at Steve who slept next to him. He took a deep breath and bent to kiss his boyfriend before going back to sleep. His heart was heavy and he felt a strange kind of weightlessness.
Steve looked shocked, just when he'd started to like this man.
"This is it," Bruce shouted, "That's the device. But so far what he's doing is creating blasts."
"Can't believe how quick you can turn back into an asshole," Tony snarled, running a hand through his hair, messing it even more.
Bucky's face split into a charming smile.
"Sir, he's gone. But, he said he'll be back again." JARVIS said.
Steve stared, shocked.
S.H.I.E.L.D. had sent their special task force, led by Captain America to retrieve a device that had been stolen from a S.H.I.E.L.D. scientist last week. The scientist had been murdered in his lab. Natasha's intel had led them to this building where the device was being kept. The mission had gone wrong as they were made. Now they were being fired at from all directions by a legion of enemy agents.
What happens in Tony's workshop, remains in Tony's workshop.
Steve stared at the figure now standing in front of him. It took him a while to recognize him, he was older. When he'd last seen him, he had been a young man.
"This can't be good," Clint gritted his teeth. After Loki, he had a reason to despise everything extraterrestrial. "Should we talk to Thor?"
It made sense. Loki looked calm as ever but the supersoldier's enhanced vision didn't miss the slight nervousness, even worry flickering on Loki's face.
He fired at a spot just a few inches away from Steve and laughed. He was hovering in front of the tower, smiling brightly with a fearless glint in his eye. Sam flew towards him and fired repeatedly, only to have the god fire back at him which he missed as Steve's shield flew towards him just the moment. Catching the shield again, Steve shouted instructions at everyone.
"I'm almost out of juice," Tony sighed, but as he said it, there was a blast and smoke filled their vision for a minute. When the view cleared, they saw Loki sprawled unconscious. The Avengers had their injuries but nothing serious.
"I mean, Steve and I almost died because of it. Mostly Steve," Natasha suddenly spoke and heads turned towards her, Tony's mouth opened a little, he obviously didn't know about it, "So, I think you should answer Stark's question honestly." The spy's eyes were twinkling, her hand rested on the table. Gone were the days she'd walk into hellfire for Fury.
Before Steve could even move, there was a blast and the last thing he heard before his consciousness fell into bitch black was "Hail Hydra!"
"Tony," he called. He wasn't sure if he'd actually said his name out loud this time.
Natasha tried to say something to Fury but stopped. There was something on the director's expressions that terrified her. The man looked way older than he was. His eyes bloodshot and face pale. He stood, facing them, looking at their faces like he was at loss for words.
"What do you mean?" Fury asked, "You can't walk away, Steve. Nobody is safe, especially not alone."
"What?" Tony hasn't realized he had been internal monologuing out loud.
Natasha's eyes widened, a look of horror at her face. Bruce felt his knees going weak, he extended an arm to brace himself, holding the table. Thor looked as if his worst fear had come true. Loki's face was oddly unreadable.
"So, did you two find out anything?" Clint poked Bruce, handing him a mug of coffee. Bruce looked as if he was about to collapse.
And then one day, he showed up at his parents' place; the great Captain America. One more proof of there being something terribly wrong here. This mad had been dead for years. He found it very annoying to be stuck in this reality with the one person he hated, but there was no time to dwell on these feelings. Besides, there was something familiar and kind about the way Steve had looked at him.
"I 'am' alone," Steve said through gritted teeth, "Ever since I've been out of the ice, I've found myself in a battle that's never going to end. I didn't sign up for this." His voice was low and words bitter. He said what he had to and walked away.
Sam Wilson didn't need permission from Steve 'Captain America' Rogers. He'd flown straight into the life and heart of the American hero, without even his badass wings, and Steve was going to have to deal with it.
Seconds passed.
“Bambino.” Tony sobbed and it was the first sound to escape from him since his son had stopped breathing. “Hey…it’s okay. I’ve got you.”
Step 2: brushing his teeth. He was determined to do it on his own.
La mucca e il vitello,
Step 6: His spider plushie gets a kiss too. Daddy has to kiss four legs; Papa has to kiss the other four.
Tony felt small and immature. Tony Stark, genius, billionaire, playboy, and philanthropist, was frightened of relationships. Stupid. Stupid, stupid, stupid.
Peter wanted to yell. Wanted to shake his head, but it was too much. Moving was too much and so was talking. The chains around his body were rattling when he tried to get them off him again. He regretted his movement the following second when another sharp pain ripped through his body. It was hopeless. They only strangled him more. Nothing he could do. Just watch as the water rose.
“Hey, it’s okay baby. Accidents happen.”, Tony kissed the top of his head and played with one of Peters thick curls. His son smelled like strawberry shampoo and vanilla like he always did. His poor little baby wet himself because of the reoccurring nightmares that haunt him every night. Dreams about his parents, about his aunt and uncle. Dreams about death and pain and fear. About helplessness and abandonment. Things no four-year-old should have to endure.
“Hey…shh…it’s alright…I am sorry for besetting you…”
“Oh, that’s calamari! Didn’t you tell me about this last week? You know Pepper, in the 1940s we used to boil everything. Terrible way of handling food!”, he grabbed Tony’s wine and took a big sip. “I never told you about the 1940s, I believe? Oh, what a time to be alive! I mean, the war was horrible, and we lost a lot of lives, but life was just different, you know? Did I ever tell you-“
Peter looked up at the sky, his head still in his Dad’s lap, his Papa’s hand in his hair. He just tried to focus on his breathing, as his Dad told him to. Every breath seemed wrong, reminded him of all the death and sorrow that followed him everywhere, but at the same time, every breath he took brought him closer to his family, instead of ripping him away from them.
“No! I’ll choke!”, fresh tears welled up in his eyes. “Please, just leave. Please.”, the next sob that escaped him sounded almost inhuman, full of raw emotions, full of pain and terror.
He could hear his Dad in the background. And AC/DC. A small smile appeared on his face and for just a second, he didn’t think about the cracking of the sinking ship, the pain in every cell of his body, or the face that he would soon be dead. He laughed, even though it hurt him to do so, it was just too ridiculous. Dad and Papa were at home, in the lab, playing air guitar along with AC/DC, while he got choked to death from the chains around his neck and abdomen. They were debating about who played which part and Peter was debating what would kill him first. The chains or the water. Wasn’t that hilarious?!? But his laugh died out into another sob when the music stopped and his Dad asked Jarvis for his location.
“Of course we’ll stay. We’ll always stay baby.”
“you are WHERE?”, he heard his Dad.
“Oh shit, shit, shit.”, Peter hid behind one of the walls of the hold inside the tanker. “Okay Spiderman keep it together. The world needs you.”
“Tony, I know that you are scared…”, he began, his voice low and a little raspy. Tony couldn’t deny it, he loved his voice. But he COULD deny this stupid allegation!
Tony knew that he could. He could save his little boy. Adopting this little bundle of joy had been the best decision in his life, the first step in the god-damn right direction everyone he knew was always talking about and he would never forgive himself for not trying everything to save his little ray of sunshine. And so would Steve. Steve loved Peter dearly.
*2 hours ago*
He was worried sick about his kid. Of course he was, but why was Peter even on that boat? On the way he decided to call Fury.
“Shh, it’s okay Baby. We’ll make sure it’s okay. Just take a deep breath sweetheart, can you do that for me? Dad will cut these chains in no time.”, Steve cooed and stroked Peters's hair. Papa was calm and collected. He always knew what to do.
“What? No of course not.”, Fury answered. “I sent you.”
He wasn’t sure why, but Steve just made his façade crumble. Steve made it possible for him to finally show his weaknesses and his fears. God, that was a lot to handle.
“Lost who?”, Steve sounded alarmed right away, but he stayed calm. Peter was so thankful he did. His Pops was calm and collected. Exactly what he needed right now.
The shield on his face closed and Tony grabbed his husband, flying off in the direction of the big tanker ship.
“Baby?”, Tony asked.
He would die. He would die alone.
“-electrocute me.”, he gasped, struggling to take another breath.
“Don’t you dare tell me you sent Peter off on a mission.”, he hissed. His grip around Steve got tighter with his upbuilding anger.
The second Peter saw his Dad and Papa, his walls collapsed. He let out a heart-wrenching sob and squinched his eyes shut. He really hadn't had wanted to die alone.
On a ship, Peter thought. Chained to a mast, to be specific. Hilarious, right Dad?
That’s when Tony realized. Peter had taken his phone when he left the house this afternoon. Another call came in.
It was too much. This whole situation was too much for him to handle. He couldn’t just tear down the walls he’d built up so long ago. Tony could feel his throat closing and his heartbeat picking up speed. Steve deserved his honesty. Steve deserved the world. He couldn’t…that was too much to ask for.
Both of them had noticed the wet spot on his pyjama pants. Steve gave Peter a little kiss before heading to the bedroom to change the bedsheets and get a new pyjama.
* * * * * * * * * *
Step 3: Saying good night to every Avenger, no matter where they are. Order: Thor, Clint, Bruce, Natasha and Loki.
* * * * * * * * * *
Ognuno ha il suo papà,
“Scared? Of what?”, the billionaire tried to laugh, he tried his best to sound as conceited as the world made him out to be, but he could feel the heat crawling up his neck and spreading across his cheeks. Tony quickly avoided eye contact, but Steve saw it.
“Peter, where are you? Are you still out with your friends? And why are you crying so much sweetheart?”
“You stupid donkey.”, Tony let out a little laugh and pulled Steve closer to finally kiss him, to finally get rid of the tenseness in his body. Maybe Steve was right and it was okay to feel overwhelmed…
Oh god, Papa panicked. Papa was not in control anymore. He was going to die. He was going to die in front of his parents, his family. For once, he’d be the one leaving his loved one’s behind, but being in this position was worse. Peter would rather have everyone leave him behind, leave him suffering, than for his family to endure this pain. This pain of being the one being alive, while dying inside.
"Wh... what?" Steve sat up quickly, "Bucky? Where are we? How'd I get here?"
"Are you okay?" Steve asked, his voice unknowingly raised.
Steve sighed.
Tony was shivering, on the verge of a panic attack, but still resolute. Ty looked into his eyes.
"A hero? Like you?" (I wish you weren't Captain America)
Tony nodded, frowning, "Nothing personal against your national hero. My dad was obsessed with him. Wouldn't stop talking about him."
"You mentioned Hulk just to pressurize her," Steve said in an accusing tone.
"Bye, Mr. Stark," Steve said.
"Call me Tony," the brunette stared into Steve's eyes and for a moment, he felt as if his heart was stopping. Tony broke the eye contact and walked back into the kitchen. Steve didn't see him at dinner. Howard told him he sulked a lot. Steve had a feeling Tony didn't like him.
There were some chuckles and Stark threw a dirty look on all of them.
"Shit, Pepper, I told you I was too sleep deprived for social calls." He muttered, blinking.
Steve was baffled. What was this man?
"Steve?" Peggy called him from behind. She looked beautiful in a red gown. But his mind was still caught in unholy thoughts about another brunette.
Okay, so kind of trying to understand what the characters are going through right now. Will get to action in the next chapter. Tony doesn't hate his dad, or even Cap for that matter, but he's had an absent father and likes to blame Cap for it. Will also shed more light on his toxic ex in the next chapter.
He didn't expect that the moment Tony's eyes will set on him, seeing him in Captain America uniform for the first time, he'd find himself wishing that he was still frozen.
Steve bit his lips. Sometimes, he couldn't help treating the younger colleagues as children.
Tony noticed that too and looked up with a start, their eyes met for a second. For a second, he thought he saw a familiar kindness in those baby blues.
"What do you want?" Steve held his shield in front of him and asked the Asgardian.
"Widow!" Steve called, "Secure the device. I'll deal with these bastards."
"If there's only 1% chance to save him, I'm going to take it." He snapped at Fury.
The characteristic smirk was wiped out from Tony's face.
Tony froze, "What did you do? Tell me." He found himself pleading.
"I have eyes everywhere, my dear archer." Loki's eyes had a maniac glint in them.
“You can’t.”, Peter winced. “When you move them, they-“
kind of interrupting our date…”
‘Okay Spiderman. You can do that. No need to put Dad through this emotional trauma again, you can do it on your own. You can safe
“Good night Pete.”, he smiled.
“Peter, would you like me to contact Mr. Stark?”, he heard Karen’s soft voice. No! No, his dad couldn’t see him like this. Even if his thoughts just centered around the fear of dying alone, he couldn’t bear talking to him right now. It would break his heart to hear Tony. Even if it was just on a screen. He’d rather die alone than for his parents to see him like this.
Why couldn’t Steve just leave him alone? This was not a talk Tony wanted to have, because talking about their date meant talking about his feelings and that was not gonna happen.
“Tony…”, he mumbled softly and gave his trembling hand a little reassuring squeeze.
He cradled Peters's head in his lap and ran his fingers gently through the boy's curls.
Peter closed his eyes, imagining the rain. Yes, it was raining. That’s why his suit was wet, that’s why there was water surrounding him and that’s why his face was wet. It was not the blood dripping from his wounds, neither was it because hot tears were streaming down his face. It was the rain. He loved the rain. It always calmed him down and made him relax.
La chioccia con il pulcino,
for once.’
“Awesome.” The super-soldier took Peppers fork right out of her hand and started eating from her plate.
“Hey, aren’t you supposed to be dead?”, he asked, voice controlled, and fear faded away. ‘You can’t be weak right now Spiderman. You are not a child anymore. You can’t be.’, he thought and approached the Russian.
and missed his chance. Now he would pay the price. This would be the day that he died. At the age of 17. Trapped on a sinking ship. Alone. God, he was alone.
“Dad.”, another sob fought its way outside.
Steve always answered the phone by asking if he was okay. He always did, it was nothing out of the ordinary, but this time Peter wouldn’t be able to answer with a light-hearted ‘Sure Pops!’
“Hang on Fury. Hello?”
“I’m sorry.”, the five-year-old mumbled and shuffled closer. His voice was calm, but Tony could tell Peter was close to crying, which is why he sat down on the couch and opened his arms. Tony’s father hadn’t been emotional at all, no talking, no hugs, no comfort at all, so when he and Steve had decided to adopt Tony had sworn to be a better father. To be a dad.
But he wasn’t delusional. Sadly not…
Ognuno ha il suo bambino,
“Hello? Peter? You okay?”
They both smiled and settled down with their son.
“Peter might die.”
E tutti fanno la nanna!” (*changed from 'Ognuno ha la sua mamma')
He just wanted to save his dad. Didn’t want him to suffer from meeting this bad guy again. He knew about his Dad’s nightmares, he knew how terrified he could get. And god knows he would save his Dad, because his Dad had saved him so many times. Because Peter would save what was left of his family. He was too strong to let life take someone else from him.
It had been horrible for all of them. It’s been almost a week since then and neither Steve nor Tony had had the heart to try again. It was fine if Peter needed more time. They wouldn’t pressure him.
Tony could barely see them under Cap’s shield, but he felt the sting in his heart. His sunshine was fading away. Oh god.
“Steve, go away. We were just enjoying New York’s best calamari and you are interrupting us, grandpa. Go take your walker and fuck off.”
“Stark. Good to hear your voice.  Do you remember me? Heard you are on your way to save him. Funny thing.”, the voice laughed. But it didn’t sound amused at all. “I got your boy here and I am thinking about changing his name. What do you think about ‘Aquaman’?”
His last meltdown had been intense. Hours of screaming and crying till his throat was sore and his tears subsided. Yeah, the first day of kindergarten had been intense.
Tony was doing the laundry while listening to AC/DC. Why was that something Iron Man had to do?
“Fury, I’ll call you later.”
“I swear he told me he’d just go out with his friends. He wasn’t even on patrol today…”, Steve defended himself.
But Steve was completely unbothered from Tony’s presence.
Their baby…
Maybe it was Peter. Peter, Peter, Peter, all of his thoughts circled around the boy. His little boy was hurt. His baby.
“Finally.”, the Captain smiled. “I didn’t want to mention it, but you
“C-c-can’t.”, he coughed, unable to inhale, but at the same time unable to just pass out.
He was just a kid. Just a small, frightened child. Still scared of making phone calls, still too anxious to sleep in his own bed with a thunderstorm over New York, and god knows mortally terrified of death.
“Yes honey.”, he mumbled without looking up. “Or you could use your incredible wealth of knowledge and invent something that does the laundry.”
* * * * * * * * * *
“I decided to work on the thrusters, they are still too weak.”, Tony mumbled and sipped on his wine. Even when he didn’t work his ass off in his lab, he couldn’t focus on something else. The iron man suit and everything revolving around it was something he was familiar with. Something he knew. And with a father that didn’t show him any form of affection whatsoever, he had always had science to rely on. Numbers are consistent, they are reliable and unvarying.
“If you excuse me, I’ll just go to the bathroom.”, Pepper decided, ready to leave this awkward talk with Steve behind.
“The media.”, Steve just shrugged and removed Tony’s fingers from his button-up shirt to hold his hand in his.
“PETER!”
Tony was sure Steve had never talked that much in his entire life. What was he trying to achieve? Bore them out of their mind with his boomer talk? Make Pepper swoon? Ruin all the hard work it took to calm his mind? Well that was certainly working out. His blood was boiling! Tony was sure he made himself VERY clear earlier, but apparently, with Steve’s enhanced strength, his ability to hear and process sounds must have been weakened.
Step 1: a bath with Papa and Daddy, either of them had to sit in the tub with him.
“My dear, breathe.”, Steve mumbled. “Tony, we need to get these off!”
Step 4: Snuggling up to Loki, while the god tells a story using his magic. (Loki would never admit it, but he enjoyed this little ritual very much.)
Peter whimpered and clutched onto them. “Please don’t leave me alone.”, he begged. “Stay.”
Tony, who had been just as dumbfounded as Pepper, finally found his voice again, still trying to trace back and understand how in the world Steve was suddenly here.
* * * * * * * * * *
He was cut off by another wave of hot pain in his abdomen, in his chest, everywhere. God, it hurt everywhere! A scream fought its way out of his throat, his body seized and the chains got impossibly tighter, cutting off every last bit of oxygen.
“I- I wet the bed Daddy. I’m sorry.”
“Peter…”, Tony, who had had a hard time processing what the kid had gotten himself into, slowly lifted his hand and cupped the Spiderlings face. “We won’t leave you here. I’ll get you out of these chains, I promise.”
Tony took a deep breath and tried pulling himself together. Steve deserved this.
His body convulsed with every shaky breath he took, barely able to open his eyes.
“Oh hey!”, Steve put on the brightest toothpaste-advertisement smile he could pull off and walked over to Tony and Pepper. “What a coincidence!”, he laughed and gave Tony a strong clap on the back before he placed a kiss on the back of Peppers hand. ‘The stupid-‘
“Papa.”, he sobbed. No, he couldn’t be weak right now. It was his own fault he was trapped here.
“You…I-“, Pepper stammered. She glanced at Tony, grabbed her purse, and left.
So Jarvis didn’t tell them what was going on with him. Ah right, he forbid Karen to do so.
Peter had had a hard time adjusting to living in the compound when Tony and Steve had adopted him at age three. Since then he had made wonderful progress, but every once in a while, there was a relapse.
“Contacting Mr. Stark.”
“I am sorry.”, he whimpered, opened his tear-filled eyes and looked at his parents. This wasn’t right. No, they shouldn’t be here. “I’m sorry I answered Fury’s call. I’m sorry I went on a mission without calling you guys. I’m sorry that I am so weak and called you. Sorry, Dad. I know you were busy.”, he sobbed harder. “I am so so sorry that I am putting you through this. That you must see me like this. Pathetic.”, Peter wanted to ramble on, but he felt like he was suffocating. God, these chains were getting tighter and tighter with every second, every word, every breath.
"Rhodes is on a mission of his own. It's called courtship. He's dating a lawyer, sooo... "
Peggy was as young and beautiful as Steve had remembered. She'd moved next door recently and although Tony had pointed out that her house didn't even exist a day ago, Steve had started to feel that everything was going to be fine. He hadn't asked Peggy out just yet, though Bucky had pushed him to do it, but he was positive she was going to say yes whenever he did. Tony would scoff and click his tongue every time Steve would act like an idiot around Peggy.
-----
"Don't... don't want to see him" Tony gasped, "tell him I'm busy."
"I need to tell you," he found himself speaking, "before I forget everything. I love you. I think I always have, Iron Man! And I think... I think other half of the device, I think it's inside me. Or maybe, it is me."
"Stark isn't making any sense. I've sent a team, with Clint and Wilson to the workshop. Once we've seen the... b... body... "
"Yes," he said, in a solemn voice, but Nat could tell he was holding back sometime, maybe a sob, "Stark called."
"I'd rather marry Pepper's grandma."
Bruce looked up at Steve and smiled knowingly, "Cap, I know he's a pain in the ass, especially these days, but I'm sorry you'll have to check on him yourself. I'm so drained I might accidentally let the other guy out if he agitates me. Go to his workshop. Take something to eat, pretty sure he hasn't been eating." Bruce yawned.
"Where are we, Buck?" He asked again.
One day, they came by a graveyard. There were few nameless graves there.
"Are you out of your mind, Stark?" Fury growled, "You're letting this abomination trick you into suicide."
Sam walked towards them with trembling legs. He'd been Steve's first friend in this century. The man who was a soldier to everyone else, had been just a boy to Sam. A friend and a brother.
"Yes, yes," The man said, bemused, "I... live with my wife, not very far from here. You should come visit us sometimes. I still can't believe my eyes. Why don't you have dinner with us tonight? In fact, come with me now, if you're not very busy that is." The man looked fairly excited.
"Erm..." Tony coughed, "I don't think it has anything to do with Asgard. But we might need to give Pointbreak a call once we've figured out the location."
Tony's mind had been a giant mess since the Chittauri attack. He was torn between missing that shy, blue-eyed artist to hating their stoic and determined team leader. He had nothing against Cap, really. He could work through his resentment and manage a decent team dynamics with the man, but the loss of the man he'd started to have feelings for made him bitter. He felt betrayed, too. Wondering if Simon's whole personality had been an act, too. Because, the Captain was so different from the man who looked lost and lonely in the cafe that day. Their team leader had the nerves of iron. He always ready for a war.
The rest of the day went away in a haze as well. The Chittauri attack brought them on the same side again. Steve forgot about his own issues for a while and became who he was supposed to be. Captain America.
"Shut up, Cap. Just let me concentrate." He raised his hand, pointing it towards the device.
There was nervousness, too. Captain America himself was a sort of a huge persona to commit himself too. But it was okay because at least he'll get to be Steve Rogers.
"Maybe," Natasha raised her eyebrows, "He might be lying. Might be telling half truth. He's Loki. If only we had a way to understand the device."
Nat and Sam ordered pizza that night and they gathered to eat in front of the TV. It had been a tense day, with their minds constantly revolving around the current mission at hand. Nat had decided they deserved the break.
"Sir, there's something going on with the device," JARVIS spoke.
He had been up all night. Had been very frustrated about the recent (lack of) development in the project he was working on. And, he'd rather watch Happy take a shower than visit Pepper's grandma in the hospital. To add insult to injury, Tony Stark had been sent to pick up flowers from this flower shop, in person. Obviously, she was punishing him for something. He sighed, chin raised, and glasses on, walked in the flower shop, and almost had a heart attack. Captain America's ghost was staring at him.
"You'll find the device, of course. Once it's location has been discovered. You, and Iron Man. It might be too dangerous for the rest of the team."
He said none of it from his mouth. The darkness only heard it.
He sat on a chair in the kitchen while Bucky started cooking.
"You've... met Amelia," Steve didn't know what else to say so he commented on Tony's Not-Date, the new intern Nat had tried to set him up with. He didn't know she was Miss Potts' cousin, "she's a good kid."
3. Loki/Clint
When he did look, it was too late. She was walking away, the sounds of her heels foretelling the incoming silent treatment.
Stark sighed. Putting hand inside his pocket and looking around.
It's getting sillier, but I really want to develop their relationship more. Also, Tony's is going to find out who Steve really is soon. But not in this chapter.
"I don't know. But he'll regret it. There's some sort of switch, on the skull, though. I'm studying the skull right now. And if I can figure out a way to contain the round object without the skull, I can try to separate it." Tony pressed his thumb on his temple.
"Stark, Tony, I know, it's going to sound strange, but..."
"Yes," Tony helped himself to a chair he realized was made by Steve, "Gets a bit lonely here. Thought I'd... "
"And Clint here is no virgin when it comes to surviving dangerous missions," Sam licked his finger.
He'd stayed there for a few hours. They chatted about movies, football, and Black Widow. Steve had been careful to not let Tony get a hint about him not being who he was pretending to be. A part of him wanted to get rid of this fake identity. Bury Simon Edwards with the friendship, or rather feigned friendship of Natasha. Leave all connection to S.H.I.E.L.D. behind. But then, what? It's not like he could escape what was coming for him. Fury wasn't wrong.
Steve looked at him incredulously, "So she's in your head, too? Why can't you see her?" He felt frustrated. This was his chance to be with Peggy. What was Tony's problem.
He didn't expect that seeing those dark eyes widen in shock, disgust, and a knowledge of betrayal will make him want to jump off the helicarrier.
How do you tell a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent that you kinda sorta have a crush on him? Especially when the said agent is in a drug induced slumber in the ICU of a hospital after having been shot three times? Well, you don't. You just fuss around, bullying nurses and doctors, telling them they better be able to revive your not-boyfriend before dawn, or you'll buy this hospital and replace everyone with more capable professionals, or even robots, because you're Tony Stark, for God's sake.
"He met him at a flower shop today. Romatic, right?"
"I'm not afraid of hitting an old man." (To think that I hit on Captain America)
"Kill me and you'll never find out what happened to your paramour," Loki sighed, "cut him open all you want."
The doorbell rang. Steve's heart skipped a beat. They'd never had visitors ever since they'd started living here. He looked quizzically at Bucky, who shrugged.
"Stark," she said, with a mischievous glint in her eye.
"Snitch on you? Didn't need to. Hydra knows everything." He laughed like a manic.
"Sir, it's Tiberius Stone. He wants to see you right now."
2. Steve/Bruce
"Sorry, I don't know what you... "
I can promise you a first kiss in the next chapter, and some heartbreak. But for now, bear with these dummies.
"I know, Sam." Steve looked at his friend, his eyes soft and full of concern, "Once Tony and Bruce figure out the device's purpose and location, we'll need to plan accordingly."
"We'll get to work. Once, you tell us what this 'device' is and why doesn't it have a proper name, for God's sake?" Tony was obviously not buying into it so easily.
They'd been walking for a few minutes after getting off the boat. They soon reached a small house and Bucky told him they lived there.
Howard grinned, "I was just taking a walk, looking around, and look who I found. Invited him over for dinner. I guess it's being prepared already?"
There was silence.
"You can't be expected to remember everything about everyone." Steve blinked those marvelous blue eyes.
"Yes, you have the stuff I was supposed to pick?" Tony said in a dull voice.
"Damn, JARVIS," Tony muttered, "Tell him he can leave or I'll kick his ass out of here."
"Once Bruce and Tony have decoded the message," she growled, "We'll do it together. As a team."
"Everything okay, Simon?" Tony couldn't help but ask, "You look a little upset today."
"Mom?" He rushed and hugged his mother. They stood there for a while and cried.
They both started giggling.
"I'm sorry, Tony," he looked down, embarrassed, "I shouldn't have. Not now, not in the lab back then. You're my teammate, it was a mistake."
"Easy, Widow! " Sam grabbed Steve's coffee, "Too early in the morning to kill Captain America with your eyes."
"What are you looking at, punk? Want to fight the clouds?"
"Who would do this to him?" Tony looked helplessly at Natasha, who obviously knew the answer but stayed quiet. She'd already informed Fury. Fury was underground himself since there's been an attack on him as well and everybody thought he was dead. Steve had cut off all connections with everyone so he didn't get the news. Natasha felt responsible for not having been able to warn him.
"Why? Are your geniuses on earth so useless?" Loki stared into Thor's eyes. He seemed excited and scared at the same time. Nat walked few steps forward but Bruce stopped her. Loki's face seemed devoid of colour for a second. Before the Hulk could come out, Fury walked inside.
Steve blinked and the movement of those wonderful lashes almost broke Tony's heart. ('Honestly, what's going on with you, Tony? You've hated this face all your life.')
"Looks like he's found his boyfriend," Loki chirped.
Steve sighed, "Maybe it's the trauma from Afghanistan."
"Sam, what happened?" He stood up as fast as he could and ran towards the elevator.
(See the end of the chapter for
"That doesn't sound good," Fury sighed, "Try to find out what you can. Even if you have to unleash the Hulk on him."
"Maybe, it's trying to open a portal. God, I hope that's just a hunch." Tony bit his lower lip. "JARVIS, read the energy signatures."
Tony kept howling with laughter throughout their walk to his house. Steve could see it was mere coping mechanism. He wasn't drunk but didn't took him long to get there once they were inside Tony's workshop. Steve could feel the pain Tony must be feeling, the pain caused by Howard's venomous words.
"What should we do?" Nat asked hastily.
"I understand," Steve nodded, "It's okay, Tony," there was something soft about the way he said his name that made Tony look straight into Steve's eyes, "I'm sorry I was hard on you. This whole fiasco has been tiresome and confusing. Ever since this thing has come into our lives, there's been trouble." Steve smiled.
Steve's face changed. A pained expression ran through it. Stark has the eyes of a scientist, he couldn't possibly missed it. He'd also noticed how tired and battered this Simon looked today. Like he'd run a thousand miles or hadn't eaten or slept in days.
"Sharon's aunt," Steve said hastily, "She wanted a portrait of her, to hang in her room."
"Let them in," Tony said, with an oddly emotionless voice.
"Tony?" Steve's voice tried to achor him into reality.
"This." Nat produced a flash drive from her pocket. This is what 'I' was retrieving the other day. I'm sorry it almost got you killed. The device isn't real either. The scientist had it hidden before he was attacked."
Thank you for reading so far. I didn't expect this to take this turn either.
"Maybe," Fury grimaced, "You make sure to sort things out with Stark. Can't have your sexual tension jeopardise the mission."
The soldier looked around with his usual smile, reassuring and powerful in a strange way. Tony's expressions were unreadable. Fury didn't acknowledge Steve much and started the debriefing. Turned out the device Hydra had been after had resurfaced. The SHIELD scientist had managed to record a coded message with the location of the device before dying.
Thor considered Tony for a while, his face contorted in confusion and hope.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Have the supersoldier and playboy decided to bail out on us together?" Fury gritted his teeth. He wasn't in a pleasant mood.
"You probably get that a lot," Tony wasn't sure why he was trying to continue the conversation.
"I just," he sobbed, "I thought it'll be motivation enough for you. I thought I could bring my mother back."
"I'm sorry," Thor said, looking at his feet, "I was about to say that Steve seemed a bit off. There's something I can't put a finger on, but... Did Loki attack him?"
Steve had nothing against parties. He hated crowds but could perform when he had to. Though this party was more about being totally unable to win an argument from Natasha and Sam and less about having to put up a visage. This was a party Pepper Potts had thrown and nobody knew he was Steve Rogers. So, all good. He was here as Nat's plus one and Sam had volunteered to come as Sharon's. Mostly, so he can test a theory and see if Natasha would be jealous. Turned out, you can't break a spy like Widow.
Not gonna lie, I'm absolutely floored at the response the first chapter got. Thank you to all of you who commented, bookmarked, subscribed, left kudos, hell, thank you for even just
What of it, indeed. Tony doesn't know what they're doing or what this thing between them even
Tony chuckled, the laugh sounding hollow in his chest. “Over you, actually. And Bruce.”
, he couldn't help thinking,
to help them was tearing him up inside. On Vormir he had wanted to grab onto Natasha and hop back to their original timeline, mission be damned. Only the thought of the remaining stones being left in Skull’s possession stayed his hand.
Once again comments, kudos, and bookmarks aren't necessary but they're much appreciated and let me know what you guys want to see more of, less of, etc. Thanks again for reading and see you soon (hopefully 👀).
And that’s how Rhodey had found him; a scrawny 15 year old who looked like he was 100 pounds soaking wet, sitting hunched in on himself as if he were trying to make himself smaller.
"What's your location?" Natasha asks curtly, cutting off whatever Steve was going to say. Tony can hear gunfire in the background, and hurried commands barked out in Russian.
“To take the stone, one must give up a soul. To return the stone, one must face a soul.”
"What I miss?" he says with a breathless grin, holding onto one last stuffed animal.
“Not really, no,” Bucky said.
Kind of have a plan for this fic now but it's still mainly just vibes lol. I'm having fun though and really that's all that matters. Thank you to everyone who commented on the first chapter, I'm happy to know that there's some people who would be interested in seeing more of this fic 💖.
Steve gets help. Meanwhile, Tony and Pepper's relationship is on the rocks.
So instead of sneering or spitting in disgust at Steve’s feet, Tony nodded. “Yes, sir.”
“Why, of course, sir,” JARVIS says indignantly. “It’s a part of my programming.”
A scream.
“Be honest,” Steve said firmly. “You have nothing to fear from me.”
“Give him my thanks,” Pepper says. "Is it just Bruce? What about the others? How do you feel about them?"
Tony gets whipped cream on his nose and his lips and Steve kisses it away. Tony tastes like chocolate and coffee and cream. He’s never tasted anything sweeter in his life.
Steve sinks to his knees, looking at Tony the entire while. His jaw drops like he’s in some cheesy over-acted high school play, but
“I know,” she repeated with a sigh. “Just one more dance? You certainly owe me more than one given how long you’ve made me wait, Captain Rogers,” she sniffed.
She reminded him of Peggy in the best way possible. She had her wit and this deep inner strength to her that Steve had only encountered one other time in his life.
“No, not fair! Only two of us can fly,” Romanov says.
Steve sighed, pinching the bridge of his forehead, letting some of his anger leave him.
Tony froze.
Pepper marched down the stairs, Mark 42 close behind her.
“...Okay, I may or may not have slipped up on that,” Tony mutters, rubbing the nape of his neck.
“Well, then it’s a pleasure to meet a knight who holds such esteem,” Tony replied with a genuine smile. Dugan returned the smile; You could always trust him to be a friendly face.
In that first month, he couldn’t help but feel lost. It was just him, Bruce, and Tony in the tower, with Pepper and Rhodey occasionally stepping in to check on Tony. Thor was still traversing the Nine Realms in search of Loki whom they hadn’t seen hide nor hair of on earth. Clint would occasionally stop by in between missions, usually in the wee hours of the morning, nearly always inhaling a bowl of cereal or chugging a pot of coffee before disappearing off to God knows where. (Was he with Laura yet?) Natasha, like Clint, was also a transient being in the tower; Steve would never see her, never hear her, but sometimes he’d walk into a room and something would be
That wouldn’t do. Tony, while working out, had already come out with three new ideas to improve Mark 42 and if he stopped now, he’d lose all his progress.
, Steve could see that
. The stench of it threatened to choke him, the scent of rotting earth and decaying bodies and blood, so much blood. As he crept across the rock, looking for steady ground, he swore he could hear screaming in the distance.
“So us retrieving the stones, me returning them, fighting my younger self, all of that led to…my brain leaking out of my nose?”
And it’s fine, really. Being cool with terrorists blowing up your home and experimenting on you without your consent is a lot to ask of anyone, even if that person is Pepper Potts.
Steve works him over with quick strokes of his hand, breaking their kiss to murmur in his ear, “Come on, baby. Spread these legs for me.”
"Says who?" Steve asked.
“Yeah,” Tony had said after a minute. “It was a dick move. It was a huge dick move.”
“And the food, is there enough?” he asked. Perhaps he could speak with his father…
“Bruce, if you think this is about the Hulk—”
Heat slammed into his gut. He wanted, no,
But Asgard had been beautiful and Morag, mysterious and Vormir…Vormir was
It had nearly been two weeks since she had done…whatever it was she had done and as each day passed, Steve waited with baited breath for something to give this hallucination or hell-scape or dream up. But each day passed by normally and painfully slow. And nothing, aside from New York dealing with the aftermath of an alien invasion, seemed out of the ordinary. Steve woke up everyday in his sad little SHIELD issued apartment, trained, and tried to help New York heal to the best of his ability, both as Captain America and just as plain old Steve Rogers.
Tony can't help himself as his eyes flit down to Steve's lips. "You begged too, Rogers."
He cleared his throat, mind racing to find anything else to talk about, anything at all.
Bucky grumbled under his breath, and Steve felt the tightness in his chest loosen. His father hadn’t denied him an audience outright. He would make sure his father heard what he had to say. But first, he would enjoy the lovely day before him with friends. Well, mostly friends.
He held out the scepter to her. Natasha nodded gratefully to him as she took a hold of it. “Thank you. I’ll make sure after lunch that this gets safely into SHIELD’s custody.”
Tony’s eyes softened. “In all seriousness, though, thanks Cap. It means a lot. Truly. And,” Tony looked down. “I’m sorry, too. You weren’t the only one who said awful things on that Helicarrier. The serum may have made you all,” Tony did a hand wavy gesture, “but it didn’t give you your heart. That’s all you.”
to my birthday celebration, embarrassed not only me but my parents, your
,” he thinks. “
Tony waits for his brain to start sending him signals of "
“I’m not a tech genius like you. Just trust me, get down here.”
“Five,” Tony continued. “The year is 2012. You’re at Stark Tower. Clint wants to call it Avengers Tower because he’s an asshole.”
“Is that cool with everyone?” AJ asked and at their agreement, she pumped her fist. “Sweet! I can’t wait to see what you guys did! Who wants to go first?”
Tony grins and takes off the goggles and gloves he had thrown on. “Why the long face, Agent?”
Out the corner of his eye, Tony sees Thor lean down to whisper something in Bruce's ear, blue eyes dancing. Whatever he said makes Bruce laugh, a real one, not the sharp little chuckle that's usually full of self-loathing or sarcasm or both.
"Tony, this is serious."
Even though he knew what to expect from Tony's kiss, the moment their lips touched still left him gasping. Tony's lips were just as soft as they were the night before. Soft and sweet and maddening.
"Not just any man," Tony breathed. "I don't just want to see you begging. I want to see you
be happening.
"It's because of you," Tony confesses. "I'm
"Yes," he says, wrapping his legs around Steve's waist, effectively trapping him. "I wanted you."
“Tony,” Steve began, stepping deeper into the room. “I don’t think it’s just the gauntlet that’s giving you trouble.” He motioned to the whiskey bottle. “You’re drinking in the workshop. You never drink in the workshop.”
So instead of saying I love you, he just lifts Steve's head up to look him in his face. He loves seeing the utter desperation in Steve's face, the euphoria right before he comes, loves knowing that he was the one to bring him to such heights. He sees it now. Steve's on the edge, his hair falling into his eyes, his lips all red and bitten like a smear of blood.
As he stepped out, Tony breathed deeply. This day had gotten unexpectedly beautiful. He closed his eyes and let the feeling sink in, and then he heard it, eyes snapped open.
"The war is over, Stevie," Bucky smiled, "We can live in peace now."
"Really? Great. You two boys have fun chatting. I'll be back in a bit." Pepper ran like she was being chased by something. Stark said something under his breath.
"Sir," His AI called, "You need check on Captain Rogers."
He might've felt helpless but he wasn't stupid. He'd kicked Ty out of the house, explaining all the terrible things he'd have no problem doing to him.
He visited his mother every day. Even if this wasn't real, he wasn't going to let this fade away without spending more time with her. His dad was just the way he'd remembered, aloof and distant.
"Let's not overthink," Steve grinned, the characteristic kind gleam on his face. Natasha knew that even now, the soldier's mind was busy calculating and strategizing.
"Have... have you tried to... um... interrogate Loki about the whole fiasco?" He gulped and addressed Natasha, he didn't like the look of pity in her eyes.
"Tony, I think I know... "
"I'm cooking your favorite," She smiled at her husband as they sat down, "Oh, and Howard, he's here." She said in a whisper, motioning towards the kitchen. Steve could hear someone humming softly and he thought of Bucky.
"Who?" Steve was confused and then he realized it, "Captain America?"
Also, in which I demonstrate I suck at writing sex scenes.
Fury couldn't finish what he was saying as without even them noticing, Hulk had thrown a table against a wall. He was banging against Loki's chamber to get inside. The god looked terrified. It took some coaxing form Natasha and Thor to calm him down. When he turned back into Bruce, Natasha held him in her arms and they sobbed together.
"So, Cap, you do realize I'm more than just a pretty face?" Sam snatched the sandwich from Clint's hand and wolfed down a huge bite. They were all in the kitchen that morning.
"Sometimes, I have nightmares, you know?" Tony whispered, "There's this strange buzzing sound I hear. People that I don't know. Screaming. Calling my name. And... your name." He swallowed.
Anthony froze in his tracks, his eyes fixed at Steve. His lips curled in something that wasn't a smile.
The Chittauri attack happens. The day was saved. What's next for the boys?
Sam and Clint walked in. Both looked shaken and devastated. Tony sat near Steve's lifeless body, staring at the soldier's face.
He banged a fist at the table and ran hands through his hair frantically. There was silence for a minute.
"Eww. No, of course not. I was thinking of setting you up with him. The girl at the flower shop was more than happy to offer her services as a pimp. I think you need a pastime other than "Let's-poor-Tony-hitched-so-he-doesn't-drink-himself-to-death." Tony went on, talking way too fast, without looking at Pepper's face that was wearing a murderous expression now.
"Captain, I can take care of myself. Go find the device." Natasha called.
Everything was still. They could hear the sounds of breathing in the hellicarrier. Sam started at Tony with his mouth opened. Nat and Bruce, who had entered the room during Tony's outburst looked wary. Fury had a quizzical look on his face as he stared from Tony to Steve.
It made sense now. He didn't know why or how. But the missing few seconds after Loki had pointed the skull at him but seemingly hadn't shot, the few second Steve couldn't remember, they carried everything. He didn't feel any pain at that moment. Or even now. Those few seconds were nothingness. The nothingness he was going to turn into.
"Hydra has infiltrated S.H.I.E.L.D., Steve!" Fury sighed.
He still couldn't help crying when his mother hugged him. His father also had tearful eyes and a solemn expression. He couldn't stay with them forever - he had to find out what was going on.
"Pepper." Tony hadn't meant to cut her off in such a sharp tone but he couldn't help himself, "I'm in love with grandma. Can I have her number, please? "
"Anything interesting in there?" A familiar voice said. He looked up and saw none other than Tony Iron, Iron Man standing in front of him. He sat on the chair next to him, smiling sadly. Steve was surprised to see that kind of expressions on his face.
"I don't really know," Bucky sighed, "I think we're home." He pointed a finger in front of him and Steve saw the boat was already near the shore.
Red sparks erupted from where Iron Man was firing and Loki lost his balance. A smile appeared at Tony's face.
Tony rushed towards the device. The orange glow had disappeared and now the round object inside was pitch black.
Loki was flying towards the tower. Iron Man beaming at him. He seemed too terrified to fire back at him.
"Oh, great," Anthony sighed, "So you won't leave me alone in the afterlife either?"
"PEPPER, HONEY... "
"With it's other half?" Bruce breathed. The rest of them just stared at each other.
"I think I might've just the answer to your question, Cap." Tony was standing besides him, looking exhausted and thoughtful, "My theory is he's not as smart as he thinks he is. And even he doesn't know what device is capable of. I think he wants to use us to unleash it's powers. See? Don't need a superspy to figure it out."
That night, a certain tech genius found himself awake at 3 am, thinking about someone's blue eyes.
"My dear Iron Man, I have no clue how did this brother of mine escaped Asgard," his voice was full of anger, "I wish I were here when he attacked. Please tell me no one got hurt."
"I can't have my fr... teammates lying to me." Steve spoke in a cold voice, even Fury felt a chill running through his spine. Nat looked upset.
"I think, we should try the switch," Tony whispered.
"Yes?" Steve gasped, reality fading back in, "Sam?"
"Sure, fine, whatever." he said, waving a hand. He was in his tank top, unshaved, with his hair disheveled. Classic overworked Tony Stark.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Brother, please, there's still time to right your wrongs," Thor's pleading eyes stared at his brother who was looking at some distant point, smiling.
"Why would Loki intentionally let us have it?" Steve said thoughtfully.
Then the colours changed, he was looking up at a dull sort of blue. It was better than the grey. And then there was a voice.
That guy had turned and was talking to the young shopkeeper who stood at the counter. Tony took a deep breath and let out a nervous whistle. The girl looked up,
Tony raised an eyebrow, "Sorry about that. Wasn't expecting to... um... My dad is a bit too fond of you. Realized he was going to be unbearable that day, having discovered Captain America  all of a sudden." He smiled, apologetically. He realized Steve was looking at him with a dreamy expression.
"Let me cook you something, one of your mom's recipes?" Bucky had his usual charming smile on. Steve laughed, "Yeah, I'm starving."
"There's no point arguing," Steve ignored Tony's sass, "We need to get to the tower. Bruce and Natasha will keep an eye on Loki. Iron Man, go straight to the tower with Thor and Falcon. Find the other half of the device and get back here." The Captain stood resolute, without a crease on his forehead. All business. Tony looked at his face. That moment was long gone. The brief moment he'd had with Steve, and now the Captain was back.
Steve drove Tony's car and got him home safely. Tony was already better by then and asked Steve to come to the workshop with him. He had no reason to decline, so here he was, sitting on a sofa in the workshop, while Tony talked non-stop about his projects.
"Sorry, you, um... look a lot like the good old dead Captain America." He managed to say.
"You okay?" Steve asked softly. The genius had clearly not slept in some time.
The noises gunshots and agents shouting filled the building.
"Sorry, I couldn't make it that day," Stark said, "You know, business and all."
Clint and Tony exchanged a quizzical look.
"Well, so far all we know is that our dead scientist didn't invent it. It's probably alien tech, he was merely investigating it." Bruce sighed deeply.
"You're an honourable warrior, brother Steven," he smiled openly.
"Sir, Captain Rogers wants to know if you're okay. He promises not to talk about the device." JARVIS said and Tony could swear that bastard was feeling sympathetic towards Steve.
Tony Stark. Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist. To Steve he seemed like just another spoiled rich boy. He had come to respect Howard for his kindness and contributions. His son, however, from what the footages have helped him conclude, was a narcissistic and shallow brat.
Sam couldn't dare to say anything else. Nat and Bruce looked at them, exhausted.
"Don't think that's a good idea." Bruce shook his hand. But Tony had already pressed the switch. The device buzzed and hummed and started hovering. The ball inside was still black but now the skull had started to open. It snapped open in half, still hovering and the ball inside was uncovered. Slowly, it gave out a high-pitched sound and also opened in half. It was hollow. But as the two sides hovered, facing each other, electric pulses started running one half to the other. A blue triangular shape appeared from the pulses. It was blinking. Appearing one moment and then disappearing.
"You don't see anything wrong here?" Tony said one day, "Look at my parents. Peggy should've been just as old by now. She was alive the last I remember. Even if this is some sort of paradise, this is a bit suspicious. Maybe, she's in your head."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Take off that suit. What are you?" (You're adorable and I think I like you.)
"I know you're afraid, all of you. We lost Cap today. If I were you, I wouldn't want to lose anyone else either," Tony ran his tongue across his hips, his throat dry, "Steve was more than our friend. He's my... our... friend. And I won't hear another word. I've made my decision." He looked around, all of them looked hopeful and frightened at the same time.
"We're fine," Bruce assured him, "What we're worried about is that what Loki has to do with this device and what was he trying to achieve by attacking?"
"Natasha had Loki spill the beans. This skull thing is just one part of the device. The other one, well, Loki says it's in the tower. When Iron Man attacked Loki, the other half got lost due to that blast. It's probably at the tower."
"Nah, screw it," Tony waved a hand, "Tell me, though, you do realize you're, um... supposed to be dead? We all are, I suppose. Something's not right here."
"Drop it," Tony drew closer, "I saw it. I saw you looking at me."
And most of all, he didn't expect to come to a horrifying discovery at the very moment: he had a crush on Tony Stark.
"Cap, we have a situation. Looks like we won't have to go look for the device." Sam was speaking an oddly loud voices. There were bangs and shouting at the background. He realized that he could hear faint noises even without the phone.
Tony bit his tongue. His eyes bloodshot. He'd just told them what he'd found out from Loki but they could tell from their faces that they thought he'd gone crazy.
But even when he did, he'd find something to whine about how Tony should this and Tony should that. Tony was far from the ideal of perfect which was Captain America. He remember cosplaying as Captain America, uniform, plastic shield and all, just to make his dad happy. Edward had just squinted, and managed to smile.
"Visiting your friend's grandmother in the hospital doesn't make you saint all of a sudden."
Steve straightened his back, "I think we all know it, at a deeper level. Bucky doesn't talk about it. Neither does my mother. I know they were both dead. I don't know, Tony, afterlife? Not sure I'm a believer, anymore. This seems to be some sort of joke. But, it isn't that bad. It's an existence, whatever it is." He bit his lip and looked at Tony's thoughtful face.
"We know what Steve meant to you Tony, believe it or not, we do, all of us," he started, "It was way too obvious. And I won't stop you from trying to save someone you love. I'd have done the same. But, as Thor said, we can't trust Loki. We'll have to plan this thing through."
"WHAT ON EARTH?" A startled voice the spell and they saw Howard Stark standing at the door.
"Fury?" Natasha's heart was trembling, "You have some news for us?"
"I don't get it," Tony paced around, "I distinctively remember he had the skull and nothing else. He's playing with us."
"Don't you dare cut him open or something," Tony's voice was still devoid of emotions, but the glint in his eyes was threatening enough. Fury tried to reason with him about how an autopsy and some scans were required so the cause of death could be found out. He was not having any of it and refused to talk to Bruce or Rhodes who'd just arrived. Before they could figure out what was happening, he was rushing towards Loki's chamber, ready to fire his repulsors at him.
Also, tell me in comments what non-Stony one-shot you'd like me to write next.
Tony started going through the sketchpad. He's good, he thought. There were portraits of his friends in there, Sam, Sharon, and Natasha. Sketches of cars, statues, buildings.... and then, was it... Peggy Carter?
Tony Stark felt as if his whole existence had been set on fire. He didn't know if he could trust the god. Nonetheless, he found himself saying, "What will I have to do?"
!”, Tony yelled while putting on his suit.
“You stupid donkey!”, Tony yelled and grabbed Steve’s collar. “I told you I am done with us and this is how you react? Yeah, really mature. How did you even figure out where I am?!”
Minutes full of fear and panic and attempts to get their son back. He was just a child. Just a little boy.
“I am scared.”, he whispered, his voice nearly drowned out by the loud noises around them. “I am…I can’t…god…I really, really like you, but…just the thought…”
“You’re okay.”
“Sounds like a good idea. But let’s not focus on-“, Pepper suggested. Tony didn’t hear the rest of the sentence. He must be seeing things! ‘Dear God, please tell me this is not Steve marching around like this is a battlefield…’
“Who was that? What’s going on honey?”, Steve asked, looking up to his significant other.
It was silent for a moment. Unbearably silent. “I think he is hurt, Tony. He cried.”, he added.
Steve's eyes have always been a weakness of Tony's, and right now, when they're so big and blue and so fucking
He knows they're right, but being confronted by all of them at once has his hackles rising. Carmen's words are getting all tangled up with Pepper's, and he can't. Stop. Thinking.
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve had thought it was another one of Tony's jokes. The thought of a man like Tony Stark, with the life and energy of a burning star,
Steve laughs. "I guess we did get a bit carried away."
He repeated the mantra in his head the entire ride to meet the others.
Tony lifted his head up from Steve’s thigh to gaze up at him. The super-soldier looked all too smug for someone who hadn’t even come yet, a cocky smirk gracing his face. “Let me show you,” Tony said and finally,
“And none of us want to be defined by our jobs,” AJ replied. “I’m an art therapist and that’s a part of my identity but it’s not the only part of my identity. Art therapy is important to me but I’m more than just my occupation. And so are you. You are all more than your occupations, just like you’re all
Bucky pointed a finger at him. “Ha! I knew you would find it funny.”
They didn’t speak until both of them had finished their cups, just enjoying the relative peace of the morning.
"Actually," Tony begins, his brain chugging along at its usual speed of light. "I have some requests…"
It’s not like Tony was unfamiliar with anxiety attacks. Hell, he had helped Steve come down from one. But Steve was a soldier who had fought in one of the most brutal wars known to mankind, only to wake up in entirely new century where nearly all of his loved ones were dead. If anyone was going to be having anxiety attacks, it was Steve. And Tony…Tony was a Stark.
“Would you like some wine?” He asked, mentally cursing himself. There was no wonder that Tony had wanted to leave. If Steve were forced to entertain himself, he’d want to vacate the premises as well.
Rhodey shook his head, saying, “No. No, look I’m not trying to be a dic—”
All too soon, they let go of each other, Bucky going to stand by Sam's side and
For all the space in his chambers, Steve felt as if somebody had shoved him into a cell. Sweat beaded under his collar that had less to do with his blazing fireplace and more to do with the courtesan eyeing him with the curious gaze of a scholar.

Tony's jaw went slack, and Steve, somewhat reluctantly, withdrew from his mouth.
"How does she make them?” Tony asks and makes sure he’s listening carefully.
“You are
He's not going to try to put a word to their
Clint shrugged. “I knew someone would catch me, Tin Man.”
Tony's voice startled him out of his reverie. "What about when you're with me? Do you feel like you're playing a role then?"
Instead, Steve raises his sunglasses so they rest against his forehead and there they are. Those eyes. Those thrice damned blue eyes. Tony’s not an artist, not by a long shot, but he wants to draw those eyes. He wants to immortalize them in charcoal and oil paint just the way they are in this moment, all fire and heat for such cool eyes, the flecks of green burning like embers in a dying flame. He wants to scratch them out with his bare hands.
When Tony righted himself, all that was left was his face plate. Tony narrowed his eyes. “Come on. I ain’t scared of you.”
Baths were still an obstacle for him, but showers he could do on a good day.
"Penny for your thoughts," Tony murmurs so as not to startle him.
to do.
Steve wanted to pull the both of them into a hug but he settled for a quick nod in return. He couldn’t be over familiar with them. Tony and Bruce may have not been super-spies, but they were geniuses in their own right and would pick up on his odd behavior if he were to act like he had known them for years.
Tony placed his hands in front of him, sinking even lower to the ground and crawled the short distance to Steve who looked so devastatingly handsome and in charge, his bright blue eyes never straying from Tony’s once. He settled himself in the space between Steve’s legs both of his hands resting on the corded muscle that made up Steve’s thighs underneath the rough kevlar of his tac suit. Steve’s eyes burned with electricity. Tony felt another shiver wrack his body.
. Was he being punished? That’s what this was, wasn’t it?
It had been a
As his euphoria fades, all Tony feels is loneliness.
“As much as I enjoyed that soldier, I’ve got a heart condition. You can’t just kiss me breathless like that,” Tony jokes.
“And then there were three,” Tony said, as he and Bruce slowly ambled over to Tony’s car. “Where are you headed, Cap?”
prayers?
,” Steve’s foot pressed down cruelly on Tony’s cock and just like that, Tony was coming in his uniform.
Tony had slung an arm around Clint’s shoulders. “How about a nest? A roosting point? What
Steve and Natasha show up with Clint right behind them. They’re still healing from their injuries, but overall they’re okay. Aside from dumping hundreds of SHIELD/HYDRA’s secrets onto the world wide web.
He knows enough about trauma and its effects on brain processes to know that, but it still doesn't make it any easier to accept. He wants to be better, and he wants to be better
Hailey reach for a box sifting through the magazines until she found a few that were to her liking and got to work. Conversation had started out slowly at first, usually a murmur for scissors or someone whispering to pass them the glue. An indie song played softly on the bluetooth speaker AJ had brought with her; a woman’s light, breathy voice echoed around the room and Steve felt an ease within himself that he hadn’t felt in years as he idly flipped through magazines. AJ had also chosen some magazines but Steve could see her glance up every now and then to observe them. As they all searched for pictures, AJ had broken the silence with a question; “If you don’t mind me asking,” she said. “Aside from your doctor, what brought you all to art therapy?”
"Without me? Without us?"
An old enemy re-emerges.
“You made me wait five minutes to finish up your gauntlet?” she asked, crossing her arms in front of her chest.
“Okay, Brita. What the hell did you do to me?”
More pressure on his thigh now. Tony was prepared this time, resuming his conversation with Bruce. He took a sip of his water to hide his smirk as he caught Steve's furrowed brow out the corner of his eye.
“Like hell it is,” Tony snaps, anxiety creeping up on him like a thief. “You’re not the only one who was worried today. If you’re willing to lay your life down for me, at least respect me enough to let me do the same.”
And so here they were, in the Shawarma Palace (self-proclaimed shawarma capital of all of Manhattan), sitting around the exact table Steve had sat at with them eleven years ago. Or now? He still couldn’t wrap his head around the mechanics of time travel.
“Fine with me,” Rhodey said happily enough, but Tony knew he was probably going to pay for it later.
That’s all the permission Tony needs, and his own hands work at the fly of Steve’s jeans until he’s pulling Steve’s cock loose. Steve catches on quick and shucks his jeans down to his thighs. He yanks Tony’s sweatpants down in one swift motion. This is the most exposed Tony has been in front of anyone since his relationship with Pepper burst into flames. And listen, Tony knows he’s not ugly (he’d been named Sexiest Man Alive twice, up there with George Clooney
On his way home from the session, he felt significantly lighter than he had in years.
, inside of your tight, slutty hole,” Steve snarled. Tony clenched down around Steve involuntarily. Steve’s hips stuttered, curses that would make a nun blush slipping out of his mouth. He pounded Tony in earnest now, one hand clenching Tony’s hip, the other wrenching his head back by his hair, forcing Tony to look up at Steve.
Also for my bilingual readers, if I have any, please excuse my shitty Italian in this chapter, I'm literally just working off of Google Translate
Then he realized he
Clint and Natasha make their way to the sharpshooting booth, Thor and Bruce walking along behind them.
Usually, Tony's quick with a quip, but Pepper's question makes him pause. Last week, Steve asked Tony if he wanted to join him on his run around Bryant Park, and what had Tony said?
"You kiss your mother with that mouth?"
“You’re a genius, Shellhead,” Steve said softly. “I’m sure that big brain of yours will figure something out.”
"I believe it might be related to what you found. Follow me."
Steve shrugs. "No one's forcing me. Spending time with you isn't a chore. This actually works out."
. I'll also put a content warning at the beginning of the chapter that the sex scene will be in so those of you who aren't into smut won't be subjected to it. For those of you who do enjoy smut, I literally already have the scene written out and it's a good one.
Mark 42 rose from the couch and clanked towards her. “Just breakin’ it in. You know, it’s always a little pinchy in the gooey bag at first.”
“You don’t need to finish if you don’t want to,” AJ said.
"...Why did you leave?"
Tony’s eyes had a strange glint in the wavering light, the gold flecks bright and taunting.
“Is it short for something?” he asked.
She had followed in her parents' footsteps, designing luxury clothes and even starting her own separate fashion house right here in Manhattan.
him to. It was something they both got off on, not a thinly veiled excuse to break down Tony's self-worth.
Thor had never even gotten the chance to stay a night at the tower, instead still on the hunt for Loki. The thought of Loki on the loose, with the Tesseract no less, left a bitter taste in his mouth. He had had limited contact with the demigod, but the next time he saw him it would be too soon.
That’s when he starts collecting Avengers like a kid collecting those little trading cards when Tony was in college. Digimon? Pokémon? It was something that ended in -mon, he was sure of that.
Tony was uneasy. Not even seven months after the clusterfuck that was New York and the relative peace that had settled over America was being disturbed by the latest megalomaniac with delusions of grandeur; The Mandarin. The American public was left in mystified terror after the terrorist, seemingly arising from nowhere, had taken credit for the bombing of a military church in Kuwait.
“Not a good idea,” Steve said, panic slamming into him like a tidal wave. Tony wasn’t supposed to go back to Malibu, not when he nearly
“Listen, War Machine was a little too aggressive, alright? This sends a better message.”
Tony’s begging for Steve to leave him behind, to find the others and get the hell out of there. As if that were possible. Steve’s lost a lot in his short life; friends, family, a lover, He’ll be damned if he loses another. Instead of saying as much, Steve just laughs, a bit hysterical, and says “In your dreams, Stark. Can’t get rid of me that easily.”
“Thank you all for sharing,” AJ whispered. “I just want you to know while you’re in this room, you will
“Nothing’s been the same since New York,” he admitted. The words had a sense of finality to them. Tony had heard that the first step to getting rid of a problem was admitting you had a problem, but he didn’t feel relief. He just felt exhausted. Exhausted and jittery and terrified.
“I was being a good host,” Tony says. “Steve wanted to see the tower. Or...what’s left of it.”
Tony’s suddenly aware that they’re just standing there in their towels, nothing else separating them from seeing each other’s bodies. This time feels noticeably different from all the other times they’ve seen each other in the nude. It’s more than his body being laid bare. "Can you...can you stay with me?"
Chuckling and holding up his hand, Steve said, “I get it. The eighties were superior to the forties and you think I’m an old fuddy-duddy.”
The impact still rattles his bones, and for an awful second, Tony swears his brain is shaking around in his skull. Whatever guns HYDRA were using
"Mr. Rogers," Carmen says. Natasha starts humming "Won't You Be My Neighbor" until Steve shoots her an exasperated look.
Peter’s eyes grew wide. “Sire,” he started.
Some days, when Tony smiles at him (one of his real smiles that lights him up from the inside out), Steve figures that he’s close to figuring him out.
“Aw, you love me,” Steve said. He settled his hands on Tony’s hips.
Natasha had looked into the past of the poor girl they had found flayed and charred beyond recognition.
“No,” Steve said softly. “That’s just for me.”
They settled back into the easy rhythm until AJ said, “Time’s up! Now there’s two ways we can do this. We can either do a round robin, if you guys are comfortable with sharing with each other. Or,” she looked around, “I can meet with all of you privately so we can discuss your work.”
Steve pursed his lips like he was biting back a smile. “I’ll let you guess,” he murmured before closing the gap between them.
Tony's always liked puzzles, and right now, the biggest puzzle of them all is what exactly made Steve's face go slack, his eyes all clear and soft and staring directly at him.
“The human experiments. Why are they doing them in the first place?” He looks from side to side, but they still don’t seem like they’re following him.
“Hemorrhaging? As in ‘internal bleeding’ hemorrhaging?”
Steve paused in the middle of his chambers and turned to fixate on Bucky. His friend, and he was questioning the validity of that term at the moment, sat at Steve’s table where he took meals when he didn’t feel bothered to attend family dinners. His head was bowed, his shoulders shrinking in on themselves. He looked properly chastised, but Steve still had the urge to throttle him. As children, whenever Steve could convince him to actually try, Bucky could easily overpower Steve. However, now that Steve was grown, he was of a height with Bucky and much more of a threat.
harder for Steve to relax. “It’s like,” he spoke up, “you’re constantly on edge. Just waiting for the other foot to drop and for everything to go wrong.”
was a personalized emblem meant to represent each one of the Avengers. Mjolnir for Thor, Cap's Shield for Steve, a bow and arrow for Clint, and so on so forth.
“It’s not about the Hulk. It’s about me. Just me. Every time I think I can settle down, everything always goes to the dogs. It’s like I jinxed myself.”
“It had to be because he based it on Erksine’s research,” Tony states, confirming Steve's suspicions.
“It’s a carnival classic,” Clint says. “It’s a giant wheel that lifts you into the air. Perfect way to end the day.”
"You must eat," Thor says gently. "A warrior such as yourself must maintain your strength."
Steve starts to object, but Natasha is one second faster. "I did want to beat Clint at Shoot 'em Up," she says with a smirk.
Thor had looked ready to protest but, in true Tony fashion, Tony just patted him on the back, steering him away from the others with a “Come on, Billy Ray Cyrus, you’re killing me here.”
Look at me being somewhat consistent. In case you didn't read my first note, I'm tentatively setting a goal to have Chapter 5 up by February 7 at the latest. Feel free to yell at me if it takes longer than that.
“Please, sir,” Tony repeated. “Please let me suck your cock.”
Regardless, I know things are getting really stressful right now (like they weren't before 🙄) and I hope this chapter gives you all a little break from reality. Chapter 3 which is really just part 2 of chapter 2 is already written, it just needs to be revised and edited. You guys are getting a special treat in that one. 😉
“And what kind of world would we have without chocolate chip cookies?” a familiar voice asks teasingly. One Ana Jarvis makes her way into the kitchen, her heels
It was his media smile. Years of interacting with Tony had taught him the difference. His real smile made his eyes crinkle and even though they were currently shrouded by rose-tinted sunglasses, Steve knew the skin around his eyes was smooth.
They toss their trash and pick up their respective prizes they won throughout the day, Natasha with her light-up sword, Clint with his stuffed dog. Thor's lion hat from the strongman game sits proudly atop his head. Tony wants to make a joke about Hercules, but he also doesn't want to deal with the guaranteed headache he'll get when Thor replies with some mind-bending statement like he and Hercules are gym bros or other. Tony and Steve walk side by side, far behind the rest of their little group, bears in one hand, their free hands brushing with each step.
Tony shuts off the shower and loans Steve one of his towels. He shuffles into his bedroom, his exposed skin prickling as it meets the air. Steve stands in the middle of Tony's bedroom, hunched in on himself, almost as if he doesn't know what to do with his body. An uncharacteristic display of shyness from him.
"Every painting, every sculpture, every drawing, is an artist baring their soul for the world to judge for generations to come," Steve says. "And isn't that just the scariest thing you've heard?"
Steve gives the idea some thought, a muscle in his jaw working. "Tony and you could fly ahead and scout for assailants."
“Rumlow is a coward masquerading as a knight and unworthy of his title,” Bucky said. “He preys on the weak to make himself feel strong.”
The Tesseract was next. He

“No,” Tony says, raising his voice so Steve can hear him over the rush of the water. “Made a promise, remember?”
“Did I like it,” Pepper repeated.

It’s just Tony, Jarvis, and Ana in the mansion. They dine on macaroni and cheese and
Tony swallows down the sudden lump that arose in his throat and scrambles to come up with something,
When Steve gets up to leave, part of Tony wants to reach out his hand and pull him back to bed. Like Steve’s a sailor lost at sea and Tony’s the lighthouse meant to bring him home. But Tony’s light is broken and Steve…he’s convinced Steve doesn’t want to come back to shore. So Tony watches as Steve gets dressed, pulls up his pants and throws his shirt over his head. Standing there in his disguise from earlier, Steve looks and feels like a complete stranger. Steve stands at the edge of the doorway and their eyes meet for a split second. He looks like he wants to say something to him. Tony wants to grab him by the shoulders and shake him, kiss him, scream at him, or all three at once.
One more dance,” he acquiesced. And if one more dance turned into two, then three, then four, well it was nobody’s business but theirs in the end, really.

Hill blinks rapidly, but she recovers quickly with a smirk. “Did I just hear an expression of gratitude from the great Tony Stark?”
Tony was making excuses. Even he could see that. Hook-ups? Hook-ups Tony could do, specialized in, even, but Steve's question had ventured dangerously into "date" territory. The last time Tony had tried to seriously date was when he was with Pepper, and that had been a piping hot mess in the end.
Tony has to give it to Steve. At least he had enough sense to dye his hair. A small part of him hates how the dark color suits him. An even smaller part misses the way his hair glinted like beaten gold in the morning sun.
me to make things work with Pepper.” Spreading his hands out, Tony said, “This is me making things work. Look, I thought about it all night and called her this morning and she agreed to it. I’m trying to do the right thing, Cap.”
“Hello?” Tony heard, rather than saw Happy speak.
Steve had to give it to him, Thor always knew how to make an entrance.
Rumlow muttered under his breath, “I’ve wondered the same thing.”
“Is this fine?” Steve asks when Tony shows no signs of moving.
Clint runs off to the bathroom, and something catches Steve's eye. Tony follows his gaze to the herd of children trying (and failing) to watch them eat without freaking out. Steve rises from the table, taking his prizes with him, leaving just Tony and Natasha behind.
Aldrich Killian was the founder and CEO of Advanced Idea Mechanics or AIM, a scientific research and development organization. And, as Tony zoomed in on a picture of him, was very handsome. His face was long and square, but not overly so, avoiding the horse-like look less than fortunate people with long faces had. His dirty blond hair was long but neat, a single strand falling into his clear blue eyes. He was smiling in the picture but something about it didn’t sit right with Tony. His smile…it didn’t reach his eyes. Tony didn’t fault the man, though. Tony’s own smiles never seemed to feel real in photographs either.
“My sentiments exactly, sir.”
The next time Tony cooks, it’s on a plane halfway to California from Monaco. Pepper sits across from him, regal and golden in the sun’s rays parting through the clouds.
. They needed to be scared.
He crept up the stairs slowly, not wanting to startle Tony. It was strangely silent as he made his way to the workshop, the stairs creaking with each step. Usually Tony had some rock song or another blaring as he worked. Honestly, sometimes Steve was amazed that the man wasn’t deaf. The windows of the workshop were completely blacked out.
He lets Steve push him down and spreads his legs and soon Tony doesn’t have to imagine what it would feel like to have that beard scrape against his thighs. Steve starts out slow, pressing hot, wet kisses on the inside of Tony’s thighs. Tony’s breath hitches as Steve starts to suck a bruise into the meat of Tony’s thigh. He knows what it is; a claim. A reminder. That this little rendezvous of theirs isn’t something that either of them dreamed up on a night when the loneliness gets to be too much to bear. His cock is hot and heavy against his stomach but something inside of Tony
“Yes! I knew you’d come around.”
, and really that’s all that mattered.
his greatest feature. But he decides to forge on. “That’s hurtful, honey bear,” he says. “Why are you being mean to me? Are you hungry? You’re only mean to me when you’re hungry.”
He wasn’t sure if it was the extended trips through time or being in such close proximity to a younger version of himself, but with every step he took towards his younger self, Loki’s scepter in hand, he felt a skull-crushing pain in his head, like someone was slowly screwing needles into his brain. Gritting through the pain, Steve carried on, placing the scepter in his younger body’s hands before dragging him off to a nearby closet, away from prying eyes. He’d probably awake with a hell of a headache but at least the scepter would be safe. All that was left was the Time Stone.
, after all) and his hair is product free. Steve feels slightly overdressed in the dark blue button-down Natasha said matched his eyes and black slacks.
"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Save the world a few times, and suddenly you have no time for your friends," she says, grinning, so Tony knows she's joking. She turns to the Avengers, who've all been standing there awkwardly like they're the new kids in school.
Tony's
"Not necessarily," Tony mutters, still avoiding Rhodey's eyes.
To be fair, Tony doesn’t remember. All he remembers is basking in the fact that Rhodey’s parents actually seemed to
That night as Steve packed up the small amount of items he had accumulated his short time in Stark Tower, the hairs on the back of his neck stood up like tiny pinpricks; He wasn’t alone.
Natasha simply...sticks out her hand. "It’s nice to meet you,” she begins.
Lieutenant Colonel Rhodes had proved himself to be just as fun as his best friend and the three of them found themselves near inseparable because of it. Rhodey was just as smart and just as funny as Tony and when the three of them were together, somewhere on the opposite side of the country Pepper Potts felt a migraine forming.
Steve sighed, leaning his head against the cool metal walls. “Don’t I know it. JARVIS can you take me to my floor?”
look tired. Dark, damn near purple, circles surrounded his eyes and there was a gauntness to his face that reminded him too much of what Tony had looked like when Carol had brought him home.
Don't get him wrong, the desperation was there as Tony wraps his legs around Steve's trim waist, but there wasn't a selfish bite to it.
He's not the type to place too much stock in dreams. He works better with numbers and facts, always has, and the facts tell him that Steve Rogers is a good man.
Hill huffs out a breath in what he assumes is a SHIELD agent’s version of a laugh. “Will that be all, Mr. Stark?”
“Hey, Tony?” he asked, not even sure what he was going to say.
“To be honest,” Steve said, rubbing the back of his neck sheepishly, “I don’t even think you’re capable of pretending. Being Iron Man comes as easily to you as breathing.”
