Locks click and the door opens on Dean’s pouting face. He’s pulled his paint-stained pajamas on, and has the television playing cartoons as Castiel steps inside and sets the bag down on the bedside table. When Castiel turns around, he sees Dean giving him the same appreciative once-over Mildred did, but there’s a lot more heat and intent behind it that forces Castiel to suppress a shiver.
Castiel smiles and drops a kiss into Dean’s hair. “I could visit you, if you go. It’s not like I’ll have much to do here.” Even if Pam and Charlie come home for the summer, Castiel doesn’t have high hopes for retaining their friendship after his encounter with Jo last night. He’s sure Dean probably has some nasty texts waiting for him too. “Maybe we can hit some of those milestones then.”
“I thought I’d come rescue Cas,” she says, brushing dirt from her shoulders. “It looked like you were about to drop a loogie on him, and I know from experience how much those suck.”
Castiel glances at Dean again, but he only moves to toss his bottle away, refusing to meet Castiel’s eyes.
But there’s still so much anger. At Lucifer, for abandoning them, and now at Michael, for driving him to do so. And the more Castiel thinks about it, the angrier he becomes. Because maybe if Mother and Father had been around more, Michael wouldn’t have had to become their de facto father, and would’ve have driven him to argue with Lucifer like he did. Maybe if Gabriel didn’t harass Lucifer with his pranks. Maybe if Anna didn’t play her music so loud.
I'm hoping to update again by my birthday in February, before Vegascon :) keep me honest by leaving a comment/kudos, or hitting me up on
Seriously, this is not how he wanted his next encounter with Castiel to go. There was supposed to be embracing and earth-shaking kisses and the intoxicating smell of wildflowers and honey. Why can’t the baby realize that? Alpha-daddy’s not exactly in the picture yet!
Fear takes over Cas’s face, eyes widening and nostrils flaring as he tugs away from Dean’s grip. “No. I don’t want to do this.” He turns, clearly attempting to run away again, but Dean is ready this time: he grabs Cas’s wrist again, flails to get a grip on his shirt, trying to keep him close.
Something must be stuck in Dean’s ear, because there’s no way he heard that right. “Bela,” he repeats. “Bela
But he’ll also sleep with another boy for several months and claim that it was for Castiel’s own good. And his friends are so loyal that they will defend him even if it means ignoring Castiel’s own pain.
He keeps smiling as Dean takes over his room, setting up a tiny portable DVD player to watch the movies on.
“Yes, please,” Aaron says, and it takes everything Castiel has not to throw the bag in his hand against the wall and storm out. Even
But then he sighs again. Pipe dreams.Trapped in this gilded cage with no phone, he’ll never see Dean again at this rate, and eventually will become nothing more than a fond memory to the small-town boy with summer green eyes. He wonders, briefly, if Dean could ever become just a memory to him, once he goes back to school and finds other people to talk to, trust fund boys and girls his mother would approve of.
“Will I?” Dean smirks, but his tone of voice is peculiar. “It’s one thing for me to fall in love once. It’s a whole other thing whether or not the girl I love loves me back.” Pam sits up straight, lips pursed in surprise. “Can you see that? Will she love me too?”
"I'm... I would certainly like to see you all again. If you'll have me." As soon as the words are out of his mouth, Dean has his phone out and is shaking it in Castiel's direction. "What-"
Cas shrugs, earning a soft protest from Bela. “I need a break sometimes. Besides, I don’t want them stealing you away from me.” He pauses to take a drink, and Dean peers at him, trying to figure out what that means.
But when he lowers his hands, turns around, and opens his eyes, the first thing he sees is Cas, laid out on the Bradbury’s couch, with Bela sprawled on top of him. They’re not kissing, but there’s still something intimate about it, about Cas’s hands rubbing up and down her back, whispering into her hair as she gently clutches his dress shirt, then compulsively smoothes it out against his chest. Dean can’t see her face, but a few locks of hair, golden highlights, are curled around Cas’s nose, his cheekbones, his eyes, and Dean feels like he’s just been punched in the gut.
“You couldn’t make it easy on me and stay in the bungalows again, could you?” he teases, his voice rough enough to make Cas’s eyes flicker with concern. “That lady downstairs was watchin’ me like a hawk.”
In all honesty, Castiel is a little surprised to hear that his father is willing to appear in Sileas because of Castiel’s alleged deviancy. Lucifer’s disappearance wasn’t enough to tear him away from his writing desk, but Castiel’s insistence on hanging out with a poor boy is. Castiel is beginning to wonder if he’s the only one in his family with any real priorities.
Lucifer, still looking like someone just informed him the sky is actually red, finally stands up and half-heartedly ruffles Castiel’s hair as he passes him on his way to the stairs. “Don’t stay up too late,” he warns as he heads back up to bed. Castiel just smiles, pleased with himself, and pulls his phone back out.
Charlie considers it, then nods slowly. “Good point.” She sways her head from side to side, then purses her lips. “I told Cas last week. Do you think he’d do it?”
Dean shoves him playfully. “Stop talking shit about my truck. Tell me about school. What did you do all year besides run around a track and win medals and ace all your classes?”
“It’s true,” Charlie pipes up. “I saw them at Dean’s birthday party. They went out on the porch while the rest of us were eating cake, and Dean told me that he was coming out to his dad and mentioned you specifically.” She twirls a strand of hair around her finger, nodding slowly. “John’s going to want to meet you someday.”
If Dean were sober, he’d notice that awful leer Alastair is sending their way. He’d notice that Lisa isn’t thinking clearly, and he’d take her home to sleep it off.
The little robot’s eagerness just to hold hands makes Castiel so distraught that, despite the flash of nausea he feels at the image of Dean and Aaron cozying up on dates just like this, he lays his own hand on the armrest between himself and Dean. Palm up. An open invitation. When Dean notices and slots their fingers together, like a key in a lock, his smile is a little sad, but he doesn’t look at Castiel.
“Take a picture and put it on MySpace,” Dean says, laughing softly. Castiel shakes his head, studying the drawing again. He’s hesitant to damage it in any way, but with the wind beating at his face, he doesn’t think he has another choice. Almost as if he can read his mind, Dean rolls his eyes and takes the drawing back, folding it in thirds before he hands it back. “It’s not a fucking Monet,” Dean teases as Castiel takes the drawing back and slips it in his back pocket.
“Don’t tease him,” Cas whispers, and Dean’s not sure how to react to that. Something flutters in his stomach and expands in his chest, to think about Cas being protective of him, but at the same time, Dean’s not used to that.
“Oh!” Aaron turns to look at Castiel, finally, taking him in. Castiel does the same, all the while trying to convince himself that what he’s thinking has to be wrong. “I’ve heard a lot about you,” Aaron says, holding out a hand. Castiel hesitates before taking it.
“If you need to chase after someone, you go ahead and do it.” Mary takes the plate of pancakes and stands up, winking. “You won’t be officially grounded until you get back.”
Instead, as soon as Bobby decides to send Dean home, Dean will be stuck by himself in an empty house.
Also, I want it on record that a certain scene has been in my head and in my notes since I first started this story a million years ago, ages before the character actually returned and sort of confirmed my headcanons on her. You'll know what I mean when you get there! :)
“Oh, but it is.” He turns his gaze back to the intricate carpet under their feet. “I was already serving a king when you picked up your first sword.”
“Yeah, yeah, yeah,” Bela drawls, cutting him off. “We get it. You’re also in love with Dean and you’re jealous that Cas got there first, get over it.”
It’s a bit of a blur after that. Castiel lets himself fall into the rhythm of their movements, the symphony of sounds pouring from Dean’s mouth, the heat of their bodies as they rise closer towards the peak. Castiel is making noises too, little wounded gasps as he loses himself, for the first time not even the slightest distracted by his own potential shortcomings. There’s just Dean’s mouth, Dean’s cock pressed against his own, seeking friction in his hand, and the way all these things make him feel.
“Is that so?” Jody crosses her arms over her chest and gives Dean a once over. “Then you want to tell me how your hands got all busted up?”
, but Dean is distracting, breathing warm puffs of air against Castiel’s skin, which feels like it’s burning up from the inside. Dean leaves a kiss just above Castiel’s navel, deftly unbuttoning his trousers as Castiel leans his head back against the door and tries to catch his breath. Dean is so infuriatingly
Dean steps up to two fingers easily enough, dropping his forehead to the bed and groaning softly, moving his hips against the movements of his hand. Icy fingers press gently against his neck, and Dean moans again, even though he wants that hand to hold him down and keep him steady while a knot works its way inside him. Soft touches serve their own purpose though, especially when they trail down Dean’s spine, stopping just a few inches short of where he’s breached himself.
Dean takes a deep, shaky breath, and nods. That’s a good stopping point. Clear his mind. Don’t worry about it. Set it all aside until he can see Missouri.
But sometimes, he can't help worrying that the way Michael and Lucifer fight, with teeth bared and claws drawn, will permanently damage their family. Leave them scarred and broken. It's possible that Lucifer's threats to leave are just bluster from an arrogant boy, that Michael's taunts to go ahead are the same, but Castiel dreads the day may come that he wakes up to find his brother lost.
. If Dean calls in distress, Cas is ready and willing to be there. “Fuck,” Dean chokes out, pressing his thumb and forefinger into his eyes. “Fuck, Cas, I’m sorry. You’re too good for me, I’m sorry, I’m gonna go home.”
Servants start to bring out the first course, and Castiel waits patiently for a prayer, or a blessing, but the family starts eating as soon as the soup is placed in front of them. Surprised, Castiel can only watch them, and for the first time he wonders if John is a usurper - these people have none of the cold politeness of the royal family in Cielo, and while John is clearly the decision-maker and alpha-in-charge, he barely gets any sort of regard for that position. Dean is actively undermining him, with his mother’s help, and although Sam is an alpha, he has, strangely enough, refused to be John’s heir.
“Because that’s not how it works!” Dean says, almost pleading. “Cas, I’m not… some tortured animal waiting to snap. I…” He pauses to swallow, turning his gaze to his hands, where the knuckles are cut and glowing red. “When I lived in Topeka, I ran around with this bunch of other kids causing trouble. We’d pick fights and steal things and they’d get me to graffiti walls… all that stupid shit.” His hands clench into fists. “I did it to protect Sam. I knew, if I made a name for myself like that, no one would fuck with my little brother. But Mom got tired of the cops bringing me home, and that’s why we moved out here last summer. So Ellen and Bobby and Jo could help her keep an eye on me.”
“You’re both right,” Pam says, wrapping her arms around each girl’s shoulders and giving a friendly squeeze. “Dean’s energy has always been vibrant. Even on bad days, there’s always a touch of red and yellow on the edges.”
Lisa’s the only other one not laughing. Instead, she’s looking at Dean, her eyes climbing over his face and neck, as he pointedly avoids looking back at her.
The way she stresses that, and the way Jo is nodding enthusiastically behind her, clues Castiel in to the fact that his drama with Dean has never really been just between the two of them. Whatever fight they were having, whatever feelings were being dealt with, Jo and Charlie were on the front lines as witnesses. And, all things considered, Castiel can’t really blame them for being tired of it.
Cas shifts uncomfortably, glancing over his shoulder at where Charlie has just disappeared, but then he shrugs. “Sure. If you want.”
“Nothing,” Dean answers quickly, shaking his head and plastering on a more familiar, confident smile. “C’mon, my phone just buzzed again. The longer we take, the more pissed Jo’s gonna be.”
Lisa lifts her head, blinking up at him, and for the first time in a long time, Dean feels the urge to draw her, to capture this expression on paper. She smiles and presses a chaste kiss to his lips.
Dean tilts his head as Cas scoots so that his back is resting against the headboard, the notepad braced against his thighs. After a moment of watching Cas scribble and frown, clearly taking this seriously, Dean chuckles to himself and collapses back on the bed, his head pressed up against Cas’s side.
Dean raises his eyebrows. Seven years is a long time to be so isolated. It’s impressive that Castiel has managed to keep his mind for so long, though he supposes the animals helped a little. Dean’s still not really sure if he believes Castiel is
Instead, when he’s pushed into laying down on something soft, he groans in misery and takes it as his cue to finally,
“I’m not going to knot you,” Castiel says when the omega leans back on his hands and pushes his chest forward. “You can stop trying.”
Castiel feels his mouth drop open in surprise, but he can’t be bothered to try and change it. He can’t wrap his head around what’s happening here, and Naomi’s own expression is… almost pained. She takes a breath, squeezing his hand between her own before continuing:
Castiel is so preoccupied, he doesn’t even notice where they’re going until they’re well past the tree line. “Um,” he starts, but Bela shushes him. She’s carrying her strappy black heels in one hand, moving forward in a pair of flats, and Castiel doesn’t even remember her stopping to change her shoes. Up ahead, he can hear laughter, shouts, and glass breaking. “Um,” he tries again, but Bela just turns and glares at him until he bites his lower lip and watches the ground instead.
Jess gestures at his dirty clothes and skin, hidden under the cloak. “Dean said he couldn’t smell you ‘cause of the mud. So how could
Ellen kicks them out around one in the morning. Mary is wiping down tables by the window, but she stops and goes to hug Cas as soon as she sees him, cooing about his height and how badly he needs a haircut. Charlie, Jo, and Pam all snigger amongst themselves until Dean takes Cas’s wrist and drags him away, telling his mom that Cas’ll be around all summer for her to fawn over, which makes Mary blush and smack his shoulder.
“You’d think you’d never been kissed by a girl before, Pinky,” he teases. “Or are you just worried about what Sarah’d think?”
Castiel frowns, anger starting to warm at the back of his neck, but Naomi raises a finger to silence him.
Mary arrives just then, beaming and carrying a couple boxes of pizza. Lisa manages to smile back at her, to initiate a conversation, and Dean takes comfort in the fact that she didn’t just walk away. She wouldn’t put this kind of effort into getting along with his mom if she wanted to break up. That’s good.
“I’ve never had it out of a box before,” Cas says, and even though it’s just another reminder that he and Dean aren’t exactly equals, Dean still finds himself laughing and telling Cas to eat up.
Mary leaves for work. Dean makes dinner, and soon after eating, Sam leaves, and Dean and Castiel quietly do the clean up. When the last dish is put away, Dean asks, “Do you want to watch a movie or something first?”
“Get your mind out of the gutter, Sammy,” Dean snaps, but he’s blushing a pretty pink that makes Castiel think he did want privacy for some reason.
Dean rolls his eyes. “Because Cas is going to have a sexual crisis just like this, right? It’s just going to work out for us, like some gay little romcom?”
Tonight, however, is turning out to be particularly unbearable. Anna, who usually finds company with Castiel during the blow-outs, has just retreated to her room, and Cas can hear Kelly Clarkson singing faintly through the wall they share. Hopefully, the music is keeping Anna from hearing most of the arguing; tonight has moved beyond veiled threats and into genuinely cruel insults, and Cas is pretty sure he just heard a plate smashing against a hard surface. Which is really just going to infuriate their mother, seeing as they don’t own any of the basic furniture in the bungalow.
It’s a doo-wop song, and though Castiel allows Dean to drag him out into the open space of the blacktop, it takes him a moment to recognize it. Castiel huffs, though it’s hard to suppress a smile when Dean puts a hand in the small of his back and wiggles his eyebrows.
Once the dishes are done, Cas follows Dean down to his basement bedroom, and immediately heads for the old record player, carefully flipping through Dean’s records. He chooses Boston’s self-titled album, and Dean flops down onto his bed with a grin as music fills the room.
Aaron shrugs. “It wasn’t my relationship. Dean made the offer, and I figured he wouldn’t have offered if it wasn’t okay.”
Cas is quiet for a long moment, which leaves Dean feeling uncomfortable. There’s shifting static and soft breaths coming through the speaker, so Dean knows he hasn’t been hung up on, but he still feels an urge to apologize. Especially when he remembers Charlie.
“It’s my fault Dean is the way he is.” She says it very plainly, as if it’s something she’s known for a long time but has never had the chance to admit out loud. “The way I worked, the way he grew up, how he had to help me take care of Sam… I kept giving him responsibilities, and when he rose to them, I gave him more, because I had no one else to help me. And that was wrong.” Castiel watches, unsure of what to say, as Mary takes another pull of her beer, then pushes her hair back from her face. “I didn’t really want him to work, in my defense. Not as young as sixteen, anyway. I wanted him to focus on school, and his artwork, but--”
Dean takes a sip of his coffee, trying not to be hurt or disappointed by this news. It’s already late June, so he’s a little surprised at himself - he already knew that Cas should’ve been in town a month ago. There’s just something a little different about having it confirmed. Cas won’t be coming back. Dean drove him away.
“That’s not entirely true,” Charlie begins, but when Dean stumbles closer, ends up leaning against the porch railing, Charlie starts heading down the front stairs. “Dean, please-”
“‘Pretty bad?’” Dean repeats, but he relents when Castiel glares at him. “Okay. Is it just those two?”
Castiel groans, dropping his arm off Pam’s shoulder so he can rub his hands over his eyes. “I knew you guys were up to something.”
And Dean's expecting anything but Cas standing up and moving away from him, because that's not really an answer, let alone an encouraging sign. Dean's heart sinks as Cas goes into the main bedroom, but he returns quickly, with a new t-shirt on, and a brightly-wrapped package in his hand.
Still. Even if Castiel doesn’t bite, Dean wants to have sex with him. If only once. Because he’s sure he’ll regret it if he doesn’t.
Dean parks on the gravel lot across the street from the Roadhouse, and as he’s walking towards the door, his phone goes off again. He doesn’t even look at the caller ID before answering: “I’m literally five feet from the door.”
At least he doesn’t see Cas grinding on Bela to shitty top 40 music. That image just makes the sizzling heat rise up into his throat, and it tastes like bile, and he has no idea why he feels so jealous, so possessive, but he immediately tries to prop it up with protection, with the thought that Bela is a power-hungry shrew who just wants to tear out Cas’s heart and eat it, and it’s Dean’s job to stop her.
When Dean cheerfully suggested mating Castiel and keeping his crown, John had stormed off into his private chambers to rage, while Mary followed in an attempt to talk some sense into him.
Dean laughs again, then sighs. He’s such a joke. Just a pathetic, weird, waste of space. He’s cut off from Cas for a day, and he’s already starting to lose it. That’s not normal.
“Yeah.” Dean looks at the floor, shuffling his feet. “That’s, um… when I get upset, that’s kind of what it’s like, I guess. Fighting monsters.”
, over and over again. Jo and Charlie join in, and even though the crowd is still glaring at them, Sam and Gabriel pick up the chant as well. Soon, Lisa is the only one in their little corner not screaming at the top of her lungs, but she is laughing hysterically, all the more when Dean sneaks up behind her, picking her up and spinning her around in time with his chants.
Cas exhales slowly, shoulders slumped. “Yeah, I do. I have a lot to think about, and I can’t do it with you around.”
“Woof.” Her blue eyes are alight with glee when Castiel kisses her cheek and makes her squeal. And this time, Dean seems to be enjoying the attention Castiel’s getting, which makes the whole thing more fun. Still, Castiel finds himself taking a seat next to Dean when Garth and Ash arrive and bogart Jo’s attention.
Still, Naomi manages to hold onto herself, if only for a moment. “Dean, you need to leave. Please. Take the crate with you, and don’t come back. Michael, take Castiel to Portland with you today, and maybe he’ll get an idea of why I have to be away so much. And you, Castiel?” Her eyes briefly meet his own before glancing away; guilt rests itself solidly on Castiel’s shoulders. “I think I’m going to call your father. Maybe you’ll listen to him.”
Dean takes a deep breath and clears his throat, trying to sound gruff and unaffected as he says, “You got any jobs tonight?”
Besides, when Castiel finally turns back to Dean, he catches him smiling fondly, adoration alight in his eyes. “What’s that look for?”
Dean doesn’t even have to think about it. “You mean Cas,” he says. “Lisa, Cas is on a whole different plane from you-”
Cas's stare turns almost mournful as he looks at Dean, as his free hand gently touches Dean's face. "Let's not be so middle school about it," Cas answers.
Finally, Dean snorts, rubbing a hand over his face. “You just get right to the heart of it, don’t you, Cas?” He starts to laugh, and so do the others, and though the tension is starting to drain out of the room, Castiel feels a little hurt that Dean would laugh at his attempt at comfort. Then he meets Dean’s eyes, which hold nothing but gratitude, and Castiel starts to smile as well.
Castiel frowns.“What kind of deal?” When Dean’s jaw tightens, Castiel rolls his eyes and throws his hands up in frustration. “No, you need to tell me what I just saw back there, I deserve to know.”
And yet, Castiel stares at the empty half of this queen-size bed, one arm stretched out towards the untouched pillow, and wonders what it would be like to have a warm body next to him every night. To wake up and see Dean’s sun-kissed freckles first thing every morning. He remembers Dean being a bit of a cuddler in his sleep, but that’s not a surprise, all things considered.
Cas cringes when he opens the door, and reaches for the volume knob as soon as he’s settled in his seat.
Not that Dean actually expected differently, but by the time Mary dropped him off, he had worked himself into a serious state, and it had taken a few moments for Missouri to calm him down enough to actually talk to her. But once they’ve gotten over that bump in the road, Missouri actually has a lot of information and support to share.
Castiel smooths his tie down against his chest and shrugs. “I can’t promise anything, but I want to talk if he does.”
Cas purses his lips, eyes darting away before coming back. “You said you wanted a kiss. Fine. If you really want it,
Charlie hurries to take Cas off speaker and presses the phone to her ear, but Dean tunes out the rest of the conversation. He fucked it up. Again. And a small part of him feels guilty, for making Cas uncomfortable and pushing him away again, but the larger part feels cheated. All Dean wants to do is make things right. If Cas wants to yell at him or call him names or explain how he felt, Dean will take whatever Cas wants to give. He’ll apologize and listen and learn and apologize again, and if that’s not enough, then he’ll go ahead and let Cas shut him out. Fine. At least the wound will have been cleansed.
“And I said your name,” Dean continues, leaning onto the rock next to Castiel. “I understood your question and answered correctly, and now I even remember it. Does that sound like heat fog to you?”
They find Gabe and Anna already in line, and Gabe quickly confides in Dean that while he doesn’t hate the band, he’s starting to regret agreeing to go with Anna. The reason why becomes apparent when Jo and Anna immediately launch into a possessive sort of trivia challenge revolving around this band, and other bands they both enjoy, names that Dean doesn’t recognize. Even Sam is a little weirded out by this territorial display, and quietly scoots away from both girls, into the blackjack circle that Dean has formed with Gabe and Cas.
“Lisa’s all the way in Portland, and she heard about it.” Dean scowls down at the cold, gooey food in his bowl. “Missouri’s only in Seaside, so I’m sure the news has made its way there too.”
Dean actually looks nervous, glancing at Castiel as they follow her to the bench and take a seat. Castiel is still confused, watching Dean for cues. Missouri rolls her eyes and sighs.
,” Cas spits, rolling his eyes and turning back to the table, bringing the rest of the world back into existence around them. And that’s close enough to the Cas he knows that Dean is able to settle.
Since I'm here and I've been thinking about this and it is suddenly right around the corner: knowing how unreliable I've been about updating on time, I'm curious about preferences when it comes to part 6. There are still two super fluffy and sweet and positive chapters to go here, but part 6 is centered entirely around a certain person's funeral, and it won't leave you feeling so happy as you wait for new chapters to arrive. So, while there's time to think about it, do you want to wait for me to finish the whole bit and post updates regularly once it's done? Or continue as I've been doing and post chapters as I finish them? Let me know!
Still, she takes Castiel’s rejection in stride, shrugging before putting a hand on her hip. “C’mon, Dean-o, don’t tell me you’re ashamed of your work.” She smiles wolfishly, dragging a hand through her hair. “You’re doing it for sweet little Sammy, isn’t that noble?”
It’s a pretty place, as places that feature the ocean often are. Smaller, slimmer rock formations, dubbed “The Needles,” rise high from the water, artfully disturbing the horizon line. Blue sky or gray, the ocean reflects the color, and a thick carpet of trees overlooks the scene.
When Dean wakes up, he’s only half-hard, but that ache in his chest remains. It’s terrifying to think about missing Cas when the guy is less than a mile up the road, but it’s the truth. Dean wants to see him. He wants to touch him and draw him and maybe kiss him, but those all seem a little out of line with Meg in the picture, so Dean will have to settle for just seeing him.
Gabe sticks his head out, and he smirks at Dean. “Cas isn’t interested in talking right now, bucko,” he says. “You’re better off moseying on home.”
“Congratulations,” Cas drawls, finding something interesting in the dull gray wallpaper. “Guess that completely overrides a couple kisses between friends.”
For some reason, Lisa initiates an aggressive make-out session in the back of the theater. Dean actually hasn’t seen the new X-Men film yet, and even though Charlie had nothing good to say about it, he’d still wanted to watch it himself and come to his own conclusions.
“Castiel,” and as annoying as that patronizing tone was a few years ago, it’s worse now that Castiel is an adult heading off to college, now that he’s the same height as Michael. “I’m going to need you to be completely honest with us so that we can handle this situation properly.”
"None of your friends were there, Dean!" Cas yells, leaning into the couch, and that's when Dean realizes he's doing the same, that they're yelling in each other's faces. "Your friends, your
Gabriel eyes him for another moment, then sighs, lifting his hands to the sky. “Alright then. You’re a big boy now, so I guess it’s your funeral.” When his hands drop, he’s smiling, but his eyes aren’t dancing when he adds, “I’m here for you, bro.”
Dean shakes his head, closing his eyes against the images his mother is creating. The last thing he wants is for anyone to cry over him, especially Lisa and Cas. He doesn’t deserve them, and they don’t deserve the shit he puts them through. Not to mention that makes twice now that Cas has come out to rescue Dean from a mess of his own making, and Dean just repays him by making bigger messes. Maybe it would be better for everyone if Lisa dumped him and starting dating Cas instead. They’re both such incredible, caring people. Why should they waste all that love on Dean? All he’ll do is break their hearts in the end.
“No, no, no, Castiel, don’t do this to yourself. I mean,” Sam sighs dramatically, rolling his eyes towards the ceiling. “Dean didn’t deserve that whole Cinderella moment you pulled on him, but I didn’t know what he was getting up to with Aaron either. That changes things.”
Castiel doesn’t understand what that means, so he just follows Dean’s lead, even though Dean’s breaths are shaky. His hands are quaking too, and despite everything Castiel just said, he still places one of his hands steadily over Dean’s, and Dean manages a smile.
So, Castiel spends the next day and a half laying on the couch in his hotel room, staring at the ceiling, clutching his Blackberry to his chest. Anna pushes him aside at one point, and he recognizes Michael’s voice in the background once or twice, but generally everyone gives him a wide berth.
“My car is right downstairs,” Dean offers, laughing when Castiel frowns. “Kidding, kidding. But you started it, and this ain’t exactly slow.”
Dean sighs heavily, lifting his head to glare at Charlie. She blinks innocently at him, crossing her legs and resting her chin in her hands like she didn’t just ask about something she knows Dean hates discussing.
There’s tension in the room now, and it’s sweltering. Dean can actually feel his heartbeat speeding up as he reaches into the hat and pulls the first two names.
Because he misses him. Bottom line. It’s been over ten days since they spoke last, and Castiel misses his friend. It was like this after everything went to hell back in 2006 too: a lingering ache in Castiel’s chest that offered up Dean’s name or face whenever Castiel felt particularly lonely. However much Dean has hurt him, Castiel can’t let go anymore. He’s in too deep. That’s all she wrote.
“You deserve better too, fuck, I’m sorry,” Dean slurs, rubbing a hand over his face and ignoring the blood as he leans back against the wall. Someone trips over his feet and swears at him, but Dean’s already been through enough tonight, so he ignores it, curling up on the floor. “Cas, I’m so sorry.”
Here we are! I hope it was worth the wait! If there are any errors, please let me know - it copied twice for some reason, and I think I got it all, but if anything is missing or double, just tell me and I'll fix it ASAP!
. His knuckles connecting with some stranger’s cheekbone, leaving bruises and drawing blood, it’s such a
But within twenty minutes, after listening to Dean’s story in his own words, Missouri had set her clipboard aside and said, “You’re not really a violent boy, are you?”
“Michael wouldn’t hurt me.” The thought alone is almost insulting; sure, his oldest brother likes to yell, likes to guilt, and maybe occasionally throws things, but no physical fighting has ever occurred.
It’s only a few more seconds before Dean is crying out and coming, and between the clench and the sweet, satisfied omega pheromones, Castiel loses control. He loses whatever sense of rhythm he was still holding onto, high-pitched gasps bursting over Dean’s neck, before his knot finally reaches full size and his come starts pumping into Dean’s hole.
“Your best friend?” When Dean looks up, Lisa has a small smile on her face, and he feels a rush of affection for her. “The one you haven’t seen in months? Who you never shut up about?” Dean feels heat rising up from his throat, and he turns away as she laughs. “I’m not heartless, Dean. It’s fine. Go see him. We’ll hang out some other time.”
Meg doesn’t look back at her boyfriend. Instead, she appraises Dean, one perfectly-formed eyebrow raised as she crosses her arms across her chest. “
Castiel actually winces, staring down at the painting in his hands. “Really?” he asks softly, frowning at the blood and smoke.
“He’s thirteen,” John finishes, and he even manages to laugh a little. “I’m sure you had an attitude problem at his age too.”
“Mom’s not here,” Gabriel says with a roll of his eyes. “Who knows if she’ll even be back tonight, and Mike’s too preoccupied to notice.”
Castiel shushes him, then realizes that they can make this better even without the lubricant. He stops briefly, ignoring Dean’s whining to push their waistbands down low enough that he can push their hips closer together and take both cocks in one hand.
Something is going on. Not that Castiel can get anyone to tell him what, but he’s not stupid. His siblings have been in and out of the room all day, even though the older two have their own place. Anna keeps sending him strange little smiles whenever she’s in, and the last time he saw her, she told him, “I’ll be back for you in a bit.”
But he meets Cas’s eyes, and while they’re not the same electric blue he sees in his dreams and draws in his sketchbook, there’s still a strength and a power in them, a well that Dean can draw from. So when Cas nods reassuringly, Dean takes a deep breath. “I quit,” he says into the phone. “I’m done. That’s it. Good-bye.”
Long after Dean had hugged him goodbye and shuffled out the window, Castiel finds the drawing still on his bed. His first thought is to set it aside, return it to Dean later, but when he flips the paper over, there’s something scrawled on the back:
“Of course,” Lisa responds, her nose twitching with offense. Dean slips an arm around her waist and gently shoves Cas’s shoulder.
But while Mary had a quiet conversation with the healer, their backs turned to him, he had pressed both hands against his belly and smiled, hoping that this meant he could keep Castiel after all.
"You could've suggested something else." Dean stumbles slightly, reaching out to grab Cas's shirt to steady himself. Cas yells in surprise, flails for the wall, then blushes when Dean grins at him.
“See you, Cas.” Dean flips his phone shut and throws it on the bed, surprised at how light he suddenly feels. Joyful, really. Just from finally receiving a phone call from Cas. He’s smiling as he kneels down to retrieve his jeans and pull them up, when someone clears her throat.
“G’night, Mom,” Castiel slurs against Dean’s t-shirt, burrowing in under the blanket. The lights go out a few seconds after that, and Castiel is lucid for long enough to realize that means it’s night time, before he falls asleep again.
But he can’t tell Mary that. She won’t understand, and if she thinks that Dean or Sam could be in danger, like when Dean ran around with gangs back in Topeka, then she might pack them up and move somewhere else, and Dean doesn’t want that. He doesn’t want to leave Charlie or Jo or Lisa. He doesn’t want to be somewhere where he can’t see Cas during the summer.
Dean moves his hands down to Cas’s hips, kicking the door closed before guiding him across the suite. He needs to taste every corner of Cas’s mouth, and he can’t do it like this, so when Cas’s knees catch the edge of the bed, making him lose his balance and fall onto his back, Dean’s immediate response is to climb on top of him, bracketing Cas’s thighs with his knees, then leaning back in to pick up where they left off. Cas doesn’t seem to mind, and even hums appreciatively against Dean’s lips, which just sends all kinds of sinful thoughts into Dean’s head, making him shudder and his cock starts to thicken in his boxers.
go around with other people, and Castiel grabs onto that, holds on for dear life, before Dean can sweep him off his feet again. “You said you had feelings for me,” Castiel says, trying to keep his voice steady. “I don’t-... how can you have feelings for me, and still go have sex with other people? It’s basically cheating!”
“You don’t really believe that, do you?” Lisa smirks, and it actually reaches her eyes this time, like she thinks there’s something funny about Dean flailing all alone in the ocean of his confusion. “Besides, it doesn’t matter if he’s here or not. My point isn’t that Cas exists, it’s that I’m no good for you.”
“No,” Bela says primly, shaking hair off her shoulders. “I invited him, and he said no. I mentioned you might be here, and he still said no.” She grins again. “He told me you two had a row, after all. I was trying to help.”
Pam takes another long look at the cards in front of her before saying, “You’re trapped. Lonely, like Gilda pointed out.” At that, Jo hooks an arm through Dean’s and nestles pointedly against his shoulder, which makes him laugh. “You’re frustrated because you can’t see the whole situation, but if you just remove your blindfold,” Pam points to the card with the swords, “and look at things a little differently, you’ll see your way out.”
“I do love your cooking,” Castiel says instead, picking up his own fork. Dean blushes darker, but at least he looks up and gives Castiel a shy smile. Jo giggles like there’s something funny about this, and Benny clears his throat.
It feels like a long time before they start to compose themselves. Before Gabe picks a sleeping Anna up and carries her to her room, while Michael collects the pizza to reheat in the microwave, because he and Gabe haven’t eaten all day. Castiel sits for a moment longer, then heads to his own tiny room, locking the door behind him and pulling his phone out of his pocket.
.” Dean rolls his eyes. “There's no way he could've done anything to justify that. He’s the sweetest alpha I’ve ever met.”
Unfortunately, Dean is still at work when they get back, and Mary has just enough time to shower and change before her shift at the Roadhouse starts. Castiel doesn’t feel like bothering Charlie again, so he orders a pizza to be delivered, for him and Sam to share as they spread out over Castiel’s uncomfortable couch-bed and watch TV all afternoon. There’s nothing on except Christmas specials and trashy daytime shows, so they settle on Rudolph and spend the entire time discussing shows they prefer. They both like How I Met Your Mother, though they disagree on whether or not Ted will end up with Robin in the end; Castiel doesn’t understand how Sam can still like Lost, and Sam gives Castiel a stink-eye when he admits that he still enjoys CSI; however, they can and do commiserate over the abrupt and unfair cancellation of Pushing Daisies.
“D’you wanna drink?” Dean yells over his shoulder. He’s sweating, a little short of breath, because there are too many people here and most of them are already drunk, and he doesn’t want to leave Lisa alone and unprotected but at the same time, he’s not going to make it through this without a drink or five. This is his third party since his fight with Cas. He’s gotten into the routine now.
Dean swallows. “So when are you gonna meet Lisa?” he asks, his voice too loud. Cas withdraws his foot, and Dean pretends it doesn’t feel like a loss.
That difficult first day of their road trip comes to Castiel’s mind, all the fighting and bitterness and resentment, and what it exploded into once the lights were out. He remembers further back, months ago, the unjustified, blinding red outrage that drove Castiel to travel thirty minutes by train to Balthazar’s apartment seeking something like revenge, but it wasn’t as sweet as promised in the aftermath.
It’s a joke, but Dean is the only one who smiles. John grumbles something Castiel doesn’t hear, Mary glares at her husband, and Sam seems more interested in his food than in anything else.
It’s like spiders in Dean’s throat, climbing up out of lungs and leaving poisonous bites the whole way. It’s like Dean’s heart is cold glass under boiling water, and he’s stuck watching as it cracks and splinters in the heat. Dean is so torn between fury and pain that he wants to claw at his own face until it all pours out and leaves him empty, and the worst part is that Cas has to know how much Dean would hate to hear that
“Are you alright?” Cas asks, seeing right through Dean’s attempt at humor. That’s when Dean realizes he’s been standing in the middle of the boardwalk, staring intently at a stack of menus, completely unaware of the crowd around him.
Dean puts his hands behind his head and leans back, closing his eyes. It’s comforting to him too, just being back in Cas’s presence. And maybe that should be weird, or something that’s alarming, but even considering his fight with Lisa, Dean still feels happier than he has in days. Why challenge that?
“Wait,” Dean laughs into the phone, tucked between his shoulder and his ear. “You’ve never been to a concert before?”
“Lisa broke up with me. Because of you.” Dean huffs, shaking his head. “She actually admitted that. So I’m not blaming that on you just to be a dick. I’m blaming you, because it’s your fucking fault.”
He’s out of control. His head is, at least, spinning these wild dreams. And the scariest part is that this one didn’t even include Lisa. He could excuse the other ones if Lisa was there, if he was pleasuring her or watching her receive pleasure, but this was just
“I was worried,” Cas says quietly, staring at his shoes. “I’d never seen you that bad before. And Lisa…” Cas swallows, shaking his head. “Lisa was really scared.”
Now it’s Castiel who has to close his eyes, because he can’t handle the way Dean is looking at him. “Why?” he demands, and Dean releases his neck to gently grab his wrists before he answers:
Technically, Dean shouldn’t be anywhere near the kegs. He’s very underage, for one thing, and for another, he would be the first to say that he shouldn’t be trusted with alcohol. But Ellen had just glared at him and made the very good point that Bobby would just throw his back out trying to lug those things downstairs, so Dean’s going to have to do it.
When an hour passes and Dean’s upstairs putting together turkey sandwiches for Sam and himself, his phone is out on the counter, and Dean checks it obsessively.
Her question isn’t one Castiel is sure he can answer anyway. Sure, Dean lights him up in a thousand different ways, makes him feel things that he’s never felt before, but that doesn’t mean he’s never been interested in girls. He never really wanted to go beyond the handsy making out that he and Meg engaged in, but that doesn’t mean he didn’t enjoy it, and honestly it doesn’t mean he wouldn’t have eventually developed an interest in trying more.
They’ve been dating since March, so Mary and Lisa have managed to pass each other a few times, like ships in the night, but with Mary’s work schedule, and Dean and Lisa still in school, and Dean himself working at the garage, there hasn’t really been time for them to do more than say hello and good-bye. This kind of get-together is such a rarity that Dean had even invited Cas, hoping to kill two birds with one stone, but Cas’s mom was around for the day, and there’s no sneaking out when Naomi’s watching.
Bela raises an eyebrow, the corner of her lip twitching up. “He’s a big boy, Dean, he can take care of himself. You, on the other hand?” Her eyes flick over him, and she wrinkles her nose again. “You need help.”
"Wait." Castiel puts a hand on Dean's shoulder (touch, always touch), and furrows his brow when Dean turns to look at him. "Your father forgets your birthday?" Castiel's own parents may be distant, but he can always anticipate a nice card and either a new book or some extra spending money when September 18th rolls around.
Castiel tilts his head. He never rejected- oh. The omega left himself vulnerable, bared his neck and arched his back and smiled, and Castiel walked away. Now that Castiel thinks to look for it, he smells tears underneath the scent of come and heat, and he takes a few steps towards the bed, ashamed that he’d acted so carelessly. He knows better than this.
“Nothing, just…” Cas glances at Dean briefly, then shifts, rolling over onto his side. “You never told me how you finally asked Lisa out.”
, after all. Even if Castiel has felt drawn to Dean since they met, even if Dean makes his stomach float and his heart flutter, even if it’s nice sometimes to think about a couple years down the road, owning a white-paneled Victorian home with a front porch and brick chimney, eating Dean’s cooking by the fireplace and going to a soft, warm bed together… Castiel is trying to be realistic here. Most high school sweethearts don’t get married, and those that do don’t always stay married. It’s silly to think that this could be forever, especially with the way Dean has behaved in Castiel’s absence.
“I know.” Dean smiles back as he stands. Benny ends up joining him, which earns a peal of laughter from Charlie, especially when Benny makes a point of sending their table a cheeky thumbs up just before the door closes behind them.
“Oh please,” Dean scoffs. “I’ve done the crush conversation with Jo and Pam and Garth, but I’ve never gotten to do it with you, so come on.” Dean nudges her elbow and wiggles his eyebrows again. “Spill.”
Not that having a girlfriend stopped Dean from having weird fantasies, but Dean really doesn’t want to worry about that yet. He’s got too much on his plate as it is.
Dean takes a deep breath, wondering if he should just ignore it, but he figures that maybe Alastair will leave him alone if he tells the truth. He flips his phone open and says, “Hello?”
Lisa’s on the bed now, smiling and running her fingernails over Cas’s belly, watching it twitch and jump under her touch. “That was a good show, boys,” she comments, voice low and dark, and that’s when Dean notices the red robe is gone, all her tanned skin on display. His cock jumps, happily reminding Dean that he still needs to take care of himself, now that Cas is done. Lisa giggles.
“He’s here, and he wishes to be part of Dean and the baby’s life,” she says, and her tone is more than a little bitter when she adds, “That’s more than one could say for
The beaten boy is curled up on the ground, and he whimpers when Azazel and Alastair pick him up again. Dean swallows visibly, purposely avoiding Castiel’s horrified gaze as he draws his hand back again.
Castiel’s eyes sweep over the omega prince in his arms. High-spirited and stubborn and generous, maybe a little spoiled but certainly not unkind. For a moment, he allows himself to think back to Cielo, to picture what Dean would have been if he had grown up there.
also reminder, in case you didn't know: dean is a completely unreliable narrator. if you're ever worried about something, well, keep that in mind!
Castiel sits down next to Dean, staring at him curiously as he tries to puzzle this out. If Dean wanted darker pieces, he could have cooked them himself, to his own preferences. Why make Castiel do it?
Both girls gape at him with round eyes, but he refuses to shrink under their judgmental horror. So he’s not as pop culture savvy as his public school friends, so what? They know this by now, it shouldn’t be such a shock. So he stares back at them, waiting, until Charlie finally tightens her jaw and nods.
The smile drops off of Dean’s face, and he’s so confused and hurt by this that he’s completely unable to keep his expression under control. He leans towards Cas, who only scoots away, putting more distance between them. “Why not?” Dean asks, hating how pathetic he sounds.
“Sorry I share a name with a fictional character, how would you feel if it was you?” Castiel furrows his brow, and Dean laughs again. “Never mind. Guess that’s not something you have to worry about.”
Sam waves one more time before shutting the door. Dean clears his throat, and now he’s obviously blushing, clutching his sketchbook to his chest.
They both jump at the knock on the window, and Dean pouts dramatically as he zips himself back up before reaching to roll the window down. “Sheriff Mills!” he says with a charming grin. “How are you on this fine evening?”
, Dean hopes that this becomes a regular thing. Cas’s lips are pink and swollen, sliding up and down Dean’s dick, and it looks as fucking incredible as it feels.
“Fine. Be this way.” He can hear her moving around the mini-kitchen, then heading back towards the bathroom. “But don’t say I didn’t offer.”
Castiel never knew he had this kind of self-control. His own cock is throbbing painfully, and he’s desperate for a taste of Dean’s slick, to know if he tastes as incredible as he smells… but thinking about it just makes it worse, and he refuses to take advantage of Dean. The omega is
Castiel seems to catch on at this point. He leans over to grip Dean’s shoulder while his other hand carefully traces the curves of Dean’s face, allowing him smell and touch at the same time. And, as if to prove that he is the greatest alpha in the entire world, Castiel actually dips down low enough to whisper against Dean’s ear. “You’re doing so good,” he says, and a purr rips its way through Dean’s chest. “You’re so good, you’re close aren’t you?” Yeah, yeah, Dean’s so close, he’s chasing the end of it now, and with Castiel’s smell and touch and voice right here, this might be the closest thing to satisfaction Dean’s body has felt since this whole fiasco started.
“Maybe you finding him prompted him to move,” Charlie suggests. “There are transportation spells that can move an entire area of land, and if he’s on the run-”
"I won't," Castiel promises, just as he realizes he's actually going to do whatever it takes to be there. If he has to run into town and back, he'll do it. Dean is right; his family wants him to be friends with Bela, who has only shown an interest in him while he's been on the phone. Maybe it is time for Castiel to start finding and taking things for himself, to start making his own decisions.
Dean laughs softly, turning his gaze to the gift card as he loosens his grip, spinning it between his fingers. It would be nice to have a book with thicker pages, maybe some cheap watercolors. Just to figure out how the whole thing works.
“What,” Castiel groans, finally pushing himself up, but only enough so he can roll over onto his back. The moon is full, or almost full, and light is escaping through the treetops, just enough to see each other by.
But as they approach the table, Castiel notices a large, bearded man is already seated at the head. He smells of fir trees and cloves, and he glances up as the rest of them approach the table, eyes immediately settling on Castiel.
Dean had opted out of dressing up; the long wait is easier when you’re not wearing a black cloak, itchy dress pants, and weird shoes. Not to mention, he knew Cas was coming and wanted to look good. Even if Cas may not appreciate it, it made Dean feel a little better, a little less nervous.
Dean hesitates, then chuckles to himself. “She’s hot. I get that. She’s a bitch and you have nothing in common except your trust funds, but hey, she’s hot, so why not hit it and quit it?”
“I just thought…” Dean stands up and runs his hands through his hair. tries breathing through his nose. His eyes are burning and he doesn’t want to be the kind of person who falls apart over being turned down, but that seems to be what’s happening. “I don’t know, we’re so close, and you kissed me at the concert last year, and Anna said-”
Dean slings an arm around Castiel’s shoulders, laughing slightly. “C’mon, Cas. I’m sure the girls are sick of waiting for us to get our shit together.”
As soon as she hangs up, Dean goes to the contact right above her’s and dials Lisa, who answers almost immediately.
“Jesus,” Dean chuckles, pushing past Cas and back out into the hallway. “I fucking missed you, man.”
Dean swallows, because the next thought is harder to deal with but impossible to ignore: maybe he kind of wants to fuck him, too.
“Bye, Cas. Don’t make me trip over you next time,” Sam says playfully. Castiel ruffles his hair, then gives him a gentle push towards the door.
Castiel’s face flushes with heat, and he stutters out a good-bye before shutting the car door on Mildred’s delighted laughter at throwing him off-balance one last time. She waves at him through the window before taking off, and Castiel heads back inside with his food.
“Cas was on a date that went haywire,” Dean says quickly, and it sounds like a lie even though Castiel knows it’s essentially the truth. “We met up and I was gonna take him back to the resort.”
Dean laughs again as he pulls away, and he cups Cas's face in his hands, playfully squeezing it, enjoying the red blush on Cas's skin, the pleased little smile on his face, as he pushes Dean back hard enough that they both almost lose their balance.
Gifts from the Winchesters are less plentiful, but make up for it in personalization. Dean receives new paints and canvases from Mary and Sam, Dean gifts portraits in return, and Sam gets new cleats and shin guards.
“Listen here,” and Mary steps forward, thrusting a finger in Alastair’s chest. There’s a significant height difference, but Mary, in her maternal fury and Dean’s drunken awe, seems several feet taller than normal. “You stay the hell away from my kids, or I swear to God, the cops will be the
with Matthew Broderick, I basically owe you a slap in the face. Because that’s what that movie was.” He pushes past the crowd at the door, waving to Ellen behind the bar, and heads up the spiral staircase.
“Good,” Alastair says, standing up as soon as Dean’s phone is tucked back in his pocket. “Now we can get started.”
“Not just that.” Charlie sits up straight and fidgets in her chair, refusing to look directly at Dean. “And you can say no to this if you want to, I wouldn’t blame you for it.”
Naomi had picked up the mail after dinner today, and dropped Castiel’s copy of the book on his bed. She’d lingered there for a moment, but when Castiel finally met her eyes, she had only sighed and made him promise to give the book to Anna as soon as he was done.
“I told Dean it was a bad idea,” Charlie says quietly, still glaring at Jo as an excuse not to meet Castiel’s eyes. “That if he really loved you, he should wait. But.” She shrugs and sighs, gently swaying back and forth in the swing. “He decided he didn’t want to taint your relationship with his own insecurities, so he’d get over them with someone else.” Rolling her eyes, she tilts her head to look at Castiel. “So technically, he did it all for you. And, also technically, you weren’t actually together. So. Don’t be Rachel.”
It’s such a cliche, but Dean literally feels like his heart has stopped. His lungs too. His eyes widen and his lips part and then his whole body hits pause as his brain tries to process what he’s seeing.
Castiel blinks, still trying to balance the bag in his arms. “We’re at the Red Lion. It’s just a couple blocks,” he says. “I don’t want to bother you.”
It’s his room. Dark, except for the small sliver of moonlight coming through that tiny window near the ceiling. And he’s all alone in his bed.
He cuts himself off when Dean’s head jerks up, when Dean turns to stare at him with round eyes. Sonny blinks a few times, studying Dean’s expression, then holds his hands up in a gesture of peace. “Sorry. Didn’t mean to imply anything.”
“How’s Adam?” Dean mumbles. There’s muffled voices coming from upstairs, probably Sam and Mary fighting about the phone call, so Dean carefully slides the kitchen doors shut and blocks it out.
And it’s nice, until they remember Sam is still there. Sam, who is watching them like they’re a fairy tale come to life, grinning from ear to ear as he says, completely sincere: “You guys are disgustingly adorable.”
And Castiel smiles, all his tension rushing out of him at the thought of Dean’s immediate concern. If this is what it’s like to trust someone, and to have that someone actually be deserving of that trust, then Castiel’s not sure there could be a better feeling in the world.
that guy? Like anyone’s gonna say no to someone who looks like that. Hell, I bet even a straight guy would say yes. Dean is
And before Castiel can figure out what that means, Dean has grabbed the collar of his soaked t-shirt and dragged him in for a kiss. There’s a faint groan of exasperation behind them, but Castiel ignores that because Dean’s kiss is gentle and sweet, perfectly chaste. Castiel brings his own hands up to cup Dean’s face, and can feel the resulting hum vibrating through Dean’s throat, against his lips, but Dean doesn’t make any moves to change the nature of this. Which Castiel appreciates. And at the same time, it makes Castiel want more.
“I’d like to call her.” Castiel’s heart drops, and it must show on his face, because Mary smiles crookedly. “I should inform her that her son is a smartass.”
. Tells himself that that’s all he really wants, and discovers that it’s the truth: even if Cas rejects his apology, if Cas ends up happy in the long run, then that’s okay. If he’s happier without Dean, well, Dean will be hurt, but he’ll accept it. Whatever Cas needs.
, Castiel thinks, and straightens his back. Dean’s eyes sweep over his body before darting away, and he rocks on his feet once again.
Castiel clenches his teeth, glaring at his mother, but she glares right back, unfazed. “I understand your distrust,” she says carefully, “but I would like to help you, if I can.”
“It’s windy on the Oregon coast, I’m shocked,” he drawls, self-consciously running a hand through his hair anyway. “Between that and the length, I didn’t have a lot of options.”
"I love all your work, Dean," and Cas says this with such sincerity, like what happened last summer could never change that fact, and for a moment, Dean wonders if that's it, if he shouldn't worry about forgiveness, because Cas won't hold any of this against him.
“He was clear about what it was,” Aaron continues. “He thought it’d give me a chance to figure myself out, and it’d give him a chance to figure out gay sex without putting you at risk. Nothing more than that. He knew you were it for him, and that never changed.” He snorts, leaning back in his chair. “We’d try something new, and as soon as it was over, he’d be talking about how excited he was to share that with Cas. Y’know, way to make your partner feel appreciated, Winchester.”
“I was hoping we could watch a movie,” Charlie says after hanging her jacket up. There’s a blue DVD case in her hand, and she tilts back and forth on her heels, smiling weakly, until Dean raises an eyebrow.
“She’s a bitch,” Dean spits, his hand slowly turning into a fist. “She’s crazy and bloodthirsty and all she wants is your dick and your money, you have to know that.”
Castiel tosses his phone aside and slumps back into the pillows with a sigh. Okay. They’re getting together. They’re going to talk. This will make everything better, and everyone can leave them alone, and Castiel can get rid of this guilty feeling tugging at his stomach, the one that’s at war with the anger in his head and the pain in his chest.
Dean finally pulls the blanket off and glares at Sam before rolling out of bed. “C’mon, Cas,” he says as Sam’s face lights up. “You can help.”
Leaving his relationship with Cas in tatters hurts, it hurts so much worse than hearing Lisa tell him they won’t work out. But this is for the better. That’s what Dean tells himself, chants it over and over again in his head. He hurt Cas. Like the scum he is, Dean hurt his best friend for no reason, and all this boils down to is that he never deserved Cas in the first place. Never. And it just figures that of course, at some point, Cas would hit his limit and cut Dean off. Anyone would.
Castiel isn’t stupid. Naomi can sit there and stare at him all she wants, but her retirement doesn’t change anything. It’s always about the betterment of the family. It’s always about status and what other people will say.
“You can stop now,” Castiel sighs, rubbing both hands over his face. “I just… Can I just ask one more thing?”
“Do you realize you’re trespassing, Dean?” Naomi says finally. Michael imitates his mother’s stance and nods quickly.
, dinner, we’re gonna be late,” Dean snaps, grabbing Castiel’s arm and dragging him out to the staircase. He can hear Cas laughing behind him, so once they reach the main hall, he slows down a little, sliding his hand down to interlace his fingers with Castiel’s. Now it’s just a casual stroll, hand-in-hand, and Castiel’s laughter has faded into an uncertain-but-pleased little smile.
“Driver picks the music, backseat shuts her cakehole,” Dean snaps before turning the volume up. It’s a useless effort, considering they pull into the resort’s parking lot just a few seconds later, where Cas is waiting on the curb.
“Ask her out,” Castiel says with a nod. “She’s not out of your league, you’re just making excuses. If she says no, that’s her problem, not yours.”
Sam is still awake, watching TV on the couch, when they make their way into the house. Dean frowns. “Hey, isn’t it a school night? You should’ve been in bed an hour ago.”
Cas chuckles in his ear, and Dean looks up at the second floor to see a shadowed figure waving down at him. He waves back as Cas says, “I watched a lot of movies in the past year, Dean. I don’t expect you to approve of all my choices.”
“Dean-o,” Alastair drawls. His voice is lilting and pleased, which sends goosebumps racing down Dean’s arms. “Are you free tonight?”
Then Cas does something odd. He tucks his head into his own bicep and smothers what sounds like a sob, before releasing Dean’s shirt and taking a few shaky steps back.
The look Dean gives him is mournful, his eyes speaking volumes that Castiel doesn’t understand. “You’ll just have to wait and see.”
Maybe he can’t. Maybe he really did take things too far this time. Cas is his best friend, the one person he’s really and truly been able to trust recently, and Dean practically spat in his face. One of the best things in Dean’s life, and he pushed him away.
Bela cocks an eyebrow, then snaps her compact shut, tucking it back in her purse. She leans across the table, closer to Castiel than she's ever been; he can feel the warmth exuding from her skin, and his heartbeat skips slightly.
Dean nods. Takes a breath. And with an abrupt little wave, he turns and heads west towards the setting sun. The castle and the village and all Dean’s friends and family and his normal life wait there, but he can’t help feeling like he left a part of himself with Castiel, and will have to return someday to make himself whole again.
“Dean,” the alphas chastise in unison, but even Mary laughs at that, so Dean just grins and squeezes Cas’s arm. Mary ruffles Sam’s hair affectionately, then takes his arm when he politely offers it. In these pairs, they finally enter the great hall for dinner.
Dean takes off across the ice to share the plan with Sam and Meg, while Cas stubbornly continues on his way towards the gate. Meg frowns a little when Dean tells her, and wonders if maybe they should all take a break, but Sam, bless him, begs her to stay out for a little longer, since he’s so close to getting the spin right. Meg’s frown deepens, but she nods, telling Dean, “You owe me,” before focusing her attention on Sam again.
!” and Castiel revels in the chaos and loves the way everything finally feels like it’s back to normal.
“I know.” Dean laughs, but the sound is hollow, muffled by his hand. “I know. I fucked up. This is all my fault.”
“Leave him alone, Vic,” Charlie reprimands with a roll of her eyes. “Dean already chewed Benny out about this, and he’s probably doing the same to Jo right now. Do you
Sam grins and shakes his head. “Mom promised me a laptop next year. And you have to let me borrow yours in the meantime.”
A door clicks shut. Castiel takes a deep breath, but leaves his head burrowed in his arms. The darkness is safe and silent.
Dean smirks at her. “Except you.” He playfully wags a finger at her, then waves Castiel over. “Your ingenuity pays off again. Jess, this is Cas. Cas,” and here he reaches up to pull Castiel’s hood off, the girl’s smile widening as she takes in Castiel’s face, “this is Jess. She’ll probably be in charge of you.”
Cas stares at him again, but he’s not nearly so tense this time. His fingers clutch right back at Dean’s hands, and he uses that to pull himself up. They shift awkwardly until Cas is sitting up, with Dean practically sitting in his lap, knees pressed into the mattress, and they both blush at the position, their hands crushed between their chests.
in those jeans, God, no wonder Dean keeps having those sexy dreams. Cas is fucking gorgeous and it's driving Dean crazy, and that is
Naomi raises an eyebrow. “I might as well, considering you can’t seem to discern who is good company and who isn’t.”
Castiel smiles slightly, nudging up next to Sam to open another tray, revealing a cheeseburger and fries. “And the world didn’t end?”
Dean opts not to answer, shoving his food away to rest his head in his hands instead. It’s too early for this, and he has too much to think about to worry over grades he can’t change. Mary sighs, apparently realizing that she’s lost Dean to his headache.
They end up sprawled on the couch for a couple hours, watching trash TV and catching up on everything that’s happened while Cas was out of reach. Cas is upset when he hears that Jo knows the kissing game was rigged, and mentioning that everyone just seems to be angry at Dean doesn’t help to calm Cas down. Deep in his heart, Dean is pleased by this, as he always is when Cas is protective of him. It’s nice to know that someone cares.
When he re-enters the house, nose pink and fingers aching, Dean and Sam are on the phone as well. Sam is sour-faced, but Dean is smiling wide as he waves Castiel over, pressing the speakerphone button.
“Let’s go out into the hallway,” Dean suggests to Cas, and when Charlie starts to stand as well, he shoos her back to her seat and gently brushes Cas’s bicep to direct him out of the theater.
“So this is why you and Dean didn’t want to have a bonfire tonight?” Jo spits. She’s whispering, avoiding the echo of this chamber, but her voice rings accusatory in Castiel’s ears. “You haven’t had enough sex the last two weeks, couldn’t make some time for the rest of us?”
He almost misses Dean’s wince, but he does catch the way Dean awkwardly tries to shove a few other canvasses back out of sight under his bed. Castiel frowns at Dean, then kneels to grab those canvasses himself, and is surprised to find they’re just flowers. Nothing fancy or unusual, just… pretty flowers.
“Hey.” Jody reaches into her jacket pocket as Castiel starts to step inside, and hands him a business card. “Call if you need anything.”
On the other end of the line, Charlie is silent. It stretches on just long enough for Dean to get nervous, but then she makes a strange little noise.
“Why’re you doin’ this?” Dean asks, surprised by the rough tone of his voice. Bela shrugs and stands up.
Cas opens his mouth, but clearly thinks better of whatever he was about to say. Instead, he moves further away, out of Dean’s reach, before he says, “Bela. I told Bela.”
“Because of Lucifer.” Castiel glances at his father, just long enough to see his expression turn somber. And maybe that should be what they’re talking about, his runaway brother, but before Castiel can think of anything else to say, Chuck is sighing and shifting in his seat.
“Jo wanted to have a bonfire.” Teeth dig into Castiel’s neck, and he tilts his head in acquiescence. “I told her I’d think about it. Why?”
Castiel scowls without meaning to; she makes Dean sound like some pretty plaything to be pitied. "Winchester. Yeah."
“No, no, it’s…” Charlie laughs softly. “It’s kind of cool that you’re asking, actually. This is what I was prepared for when I first told you.” She clears her throat, and Dean can hear something creaking in the background. “Um. Well. I’d never really had any crushes on boys. I like you and Sam and Kevin, but those floaty, la-la, fireworks feelings never really showed up for me.”
Dean blinks, then laughs softly. “‘Cause they were assholes about you. I harassed them into it as a way of making up for that.”
He hangs up the phone, and reaches across the table to take Lisa’s hand, but she moves away before he can. “More work?” she says, voice clipped and cold.
Castiel shuts his door and smirks at Dean from across the Impala’s hood. “Bela.” He waits for Dean’s face to fall before he adds, “The one you hijacked, remember? Our first kiss?”
“I’m sorry,” she says after a second, hurrying out to the register and offering up a smile that doesn’t quite meet her eyes. “Dean and his friends don’t usually come here, I’m a little… surprised to see you.” She clears her throat, shooing him off the counter. “Especially at this time of day. In fact, I thought Dean was at work?”
“Don’t be stupid,” Dean mutters. “How could you…” But he trails off, putting his head in his hands as an ache forms at his temples. It’s hard to be angry at Lisa for letting the cat out of the bag when Dean was the one who put the cat there in the first place.
Sam starts arguing the virtues of having breakfast for dinner, in a way that has Castiel affectionately thinking that he’ll make an excellent lawyer, when they’re both surprised by what sounds like the Impala pulling up the street outside.
Dean’s fingers are already fumbling with the buttons on Castiel’s shirt, but Castiel pushes him away, unbuckling his seatbelt and opening the door. Dean has a small pout on his face when Castiel slides into the back seat, but it quickly gives way to understanding, and he scrambles to catch up.
Dean blinks at her, then sighs, all his aggression flowing out of him as he stares at her. She’s gorgeous and rich, and her family is full of opportunities and connections. Of course Cas would want to date her. His family must love her. “You two are dating, then?”
It’s only when Castiel pulls himself away, leaving Anna to bogart Gabe’s comfort, that he notices Michael, standing next to the couch, watching his siblings with red-rimmed eyes. Emotions war in Castiel’s chest: it’s Michael’s fault, entirely Michael’s fault that Lucifer left, but maybe Michael knows that already. Maybe he’s already beating himself up over it. Maybe it’s not Castiel’s place to do so.
“I didn’t know you liked this kind of thing,” Lucifer mumbles, leaning forward to rest his chin in his hand.
Cas stands up, eyes wide, and holds out his hands to gently grip Dean’s forearms. “Dean, it’s not that important. Please, calm down.”
Then, the long moment is over, and the opportunity is gone. With a high-pitched battle cry, Jo appears, and tackles Dean back to the dirt, leaving Castiel free to sit up and start shaking the sand from his hair. Dean roughly, easily, tosses Jo aside, but she’s giggling about it even as he scowls at her.
When they arrive at the theater, Dean’s stuck parking near the back, but no one seems to mind. He’s a little surprised by the line of kids around the venue (most of them, like Jo, with brightly colored hair and heavy eyeliner). He never expected a band of teenage crooners singing about broken hearts to get this much attention.
Castiel has to laugh at that, at Charlie still screeching Dean’s name, and at the way Victor is now trying to get the girls to shut up, stumbling in the sand and wrestling with Bela, trying to fit a hand over her mouth and failing. Dean finally comes to see what the commotion is all about, and Bela yells, “Victor is harassing your boyfriend!” while Victor yells back, “I didn’t do
“You don’t have to do this, you know,” Castiel says, his eyes locked on Dean’s. “They recruited you because they’re afraid of you.”
Dean misses Cas. Like an ache, like a missing piece. It wasn't this bad last year, when at least they were sending letters, MySpace messages, exchanging phone calls. When he was allowed to send Cas all the little sketches he made late at night, when he was lonely. Dean might deserve being shut out like this, but it doesn't make it any easier on his end. Whenever he calls Cas's number and gets an automated voice saying the number is no longer in service. Whenever he draws a picture of Kyriel and gives him Cas's stark nose and full lips. Whenever he has a dream that's just him and Cas in a bed, making soft noises.
?!” And Dean groans, because now Sam is pulling that wounded puppy look, big hazel eyes and pathetic little frown. “C’mon, Dean! You can just take Lisa with you and make out in the back for all we care, all we need is a ride!”
Dean meets his eyes, trying to decide if Cas is serious, or just trying to make him feel better. He knows, in the back of his mind, that it's stupid to wonder - Cas isn't the type to lie, especially not to spare someone's feelings. But he can't help himself. How can someone like Cas see anything of worth in someone like Dean?
Dean turns back to his sketchbook, so Castiel takes another longing look at the Moon and Sun painting before reaching for the next few paintings.
Castiel blinks, and all eyes around the table are on him. Sam and John look suspicious, but Mary has her chin resting in her hand, apparently ready for a good story. Dean smiles almost imperceptibly, before turning back to his soup, making himself absolutely no help at all.
He did, but Castiel has a feeling that Dean wouldn't appreciate him sharing the story with anyone. Dean had been especially angry when Castiel decided to room with Balthazar for their junior year. He hadn't particularly cared to listen when Castiel argued that he and Balthazar had spent plenty of time sharing living spaces in boarding school. All Dean knew was that Castiel and Balthazar had slept together a few times freshman year, and while he trusted Castiel, he would probably never trust Balthazar. "It was sudden. An accident. No one could have seen it coming."
