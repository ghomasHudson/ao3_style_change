They huddle together on a corner of one of the secret rooms, only found thanks to Carter’s impressive skills and fortunate previous knowledge of the House – and if that advantage comes from personal experience or SHIELD interference, there will never be a right time to ask, now. They cry and sob and hug each other, trapped like abused animals in a cage, behind a table that provides little to no cover in case of an actual attack, much less one like the crowd that roared outside just mere minutes before, had they been able to get past the gates before the Jet had arrived. Tony’s entire body shivers in fear for what might have happened to these people had they gotten here too late; because he doesn’t even know what would have happened. He can’t even imagine. There’s no logic to be applied here to rationalize this, because this is just…

He coughs and coughs and it hurts, his eyes water and he can’t breathe right, and Nebula calls his name in a panicked voice when he starts to go red in the face, exertion and lack of oxygen nearly making him topple, his head fuzzy and unfocused. His throat is completely raw. He tries to blink away the water in his eyes, but they’re the only thing allowing him to see past the thick fog of dust, the absolute dryness of the air, and his stomach hurts so much he can’t stop tearing up even if he wanted to.
“It’s not SHIELD business.” He quickly corrects. “And I know. It’s not that. It’s something personal, and no one else knows about this, not even Peggy or Obie. It’s just us. I want you to keep it safe, and keep it hidden, until the time is right. Can you promise me that?”

He’d tried. He never succeeded.
“Who was he?” Natasha asks, her voice uncharacteristically raspy, and Tony doesn’t miss the way she slides the correction softly into her question, so smoothly Bruce doesn’t even realize she’s doing it, her eyes locked to Tony’s in search for an answer.
Natasha scoffs, throwing him a knowing look. “You like danger, Rogers. It keeps you on your toes. You wouldn’t have it any other way.”
The thing spins, faster and faster, creating an enormous glowing circle in the air before them – and with the loud, sharp sounds of it slicing through nothing, that so ominous sound of

It’s the most awkward Tony has felt in a very long time.

Her projection is almost as large as JARVIS was when displayed in open space, but on the screen, she looks tiny, a fragile little thing. If Tony didn’t know any better, he would say she’s shy. But no. She’s never been shy about anything, but she is hesitant. Brave, his baby girl, but still learning. Still young. “Ultron was different because it was meant to interfere in outside problems without inside initial order, but that’s why it was still on the board and not out there. Too many variables.”
The bubble bursts, silent, undetected. It’s drowned by the sound of the blood roaring in Tony’s ears.

But then Steve puts it in a frame in his office, and Tony forgets all about the mishap, and just smiles.

“Tony.” Steve tilts his head, playfully, like he can’t believe Tony’s surprise. “Ma practically adopted you the moment you stepped a foot inside her house. If I hadn’t stopped her, she would have trapped you there and never let you leave.”
“I can see how this could have turned against us… But I can see how
“I’m going with you out there today, Tony.” Pepper unexpectedly says, and Tony startles, both by the surprise of her voice breaking the silence and the meaning of her words.
And— And that is making all kinds of conflicting feelings bloom in Steve’s heart, feelings that are a mix of fondness and curiosity and concern, fear and hope walking side by side, wishing he could do something to make sure this won’t end in tears for either of them. But he can’t do that. And

Tony chokes on nothing when he tries to answer, and he has to try again.

The Quinjet cuts through the skies as fast as it dares, drowning in the midst of the foggy cloud of ash and dust, the panels and radars unreliable and unhelpful in every way. Rhodey and Clint have to pilot because they are the only ones who can be trusted with these conditions, the only ones who have the skill and expertise to navigate hostile skies in such speed. And all the while – black is the only thing that greets them. Black, black, and more black, no city lights or stars, not a single beacon to guide them in the night into a safe place; And it’s awful, an experience not even being stranded in space can replicate, this feeling of absolute darkness, like they’ve dropped over the edge of the world into an endless abyss. The cold from outside seeps in through the walls even though the Jet is well insulated, and Tony shivers in his T-shirt, resisting the urge to run his hands through his arms to try and gain some warmth by friction.

The way Pepper stops and waits for him to continue says a lot about how far they’ve come in this relationship. Years ago, she would have interrupted him. She had, before. Her distress would be far closer to her skin, much easier to set off, the mounting concern for hers and Tony’s safety unfamiliar and unclear though the first couple of years, making every disagreement like it was the end of the world itself. But now it isn’t. It helps, he knows, that they’ve had more talks about this than perhaps about anything else, except for Stark Industries-related subjects. It helps, that they’re older, that they don’t have some misconceptions about each other anymore, and that this… has just become one thing they are both aware is a part of their lives now. Has been, since Tony claimed the suit in front of the public. Maybe even before then.
They’ve been over this.
They shouldn’t divide, but it would be a
For someone who makes such a strong distinction between right and wrong, Steve is coming to understand he lives in areas that are far less clear-cut than he’d like to admit, a line he’s been tiptoeing on since forever, and he never realized it. Violence as peace, lying in the name of truth.
All he knows is that
“You don’t. If Stark had trusted me, he wouldn’t have tried to keep me locked in the Compound.”
Rocket must see something in his face that’s telling enough of Tony’s thoughts, because he scoffs and interrupts right off, even if a little awkward, aiming for irreverence but not quite making it. “Listen, I know we’re not ones to talk, but she does have a point on this.”
Poor MCU. I will leave no stone unturned.
The coffee machine is fixed, so he doesn’t need to go upstairs anymore; So now, Tony invites Steve down so they can spend some time together.

He wraps his arm around hers and pulls her closer, nearly squishing her to his side, and he hopes she understands.
There were times before, he remembers, where he tried to get her to understand. That he’d hoped, with all his strength and might, that she could once day see the world through his eyes, to understand exactly why he did what he did, and why he couldn’t stop, why, no matter how many suits he explodes or how many documents he signs, Iron Man is etched into him in a way he can’t ever remove, and even if he steps out, the lingering, quiet concern will always be there. Always at the corners. Always waiting to strike.

T’Challa has given him the key to a private connection, as he promised he would, and Steve occasionally uses it, so he and Bucky can catch up. He tries not to overdo it, trying to be mindful that Bucky still wants some time for himself, but sometimes he just needs someone to talk to; someone he knows he can say some things to and it won’t end up in a fight. Steve and Bucky have fought over many things through the years they’ve known each other, sometimes to the point of acquiring bruises and split lips, but they’ve never thrown insults or punches when what the other needs is support.
He forces himself to loosen them up a little bit. And when he does, he realizes he has to do almost double the effort to loosen up his shoulders.

“I did, before Rogers removed them.” Tony clarifies. “You think he didn’t know where the trackers were?”

There are no fights. There are no tears. If they didn’t know better, it would be a day like any other, inconspicuous and stilted, the very same normal day in a normal life they all pretend they have, even if they all know it’s a lie. It’s not a lifestyle, it’s a

Home is very fragile, though. Home is a sheer veil placed haphazardly over the broken furniture, to hopefully keep the dust and debris away from the reach of bystanders and third parties. Like a construction site, that promises great things to come but it is, still, just the ruins of something that is being taken apart piece by piece. Tony has never feared construction – it would be nonsensical to, as an engineer. He sees it as an improvement. Sometimes you do need to break down some walls or maybe something even bigger to create something better on top of it – but he’d be lying if he didn’t admit that sometimes, just sometimes – he wishes home was… complete. That the work was done, that it was all done, and they could just enjoy it. That there was no struggle to overcome anymore and they could just love and be.

other members of your team will affect how well you work together. Sure, I dig the 'when we fight together, we just fit' trope as much as the next person, but as I said, we're going for realistic here - do you have any idea how hard it is to fall back into rhythm with someone you've had to leave behind and now have adjusted to living without? If you do, I'm sure you can imagine where my frustration comes from, seeing how... put together is not the right term, but how easily they accept each other's improvisations, shall I say. How understanding they are, how there's barely any frustration or difficulty in understanding why someone did what they did.

The problem is not Iron Man. The problem is that, at the very core, Tony and Pepper are driven by the same force - but they fly in different paths.
“Something happened.” Steve interrupts, and it might be only the depth of his agony that makes them stop, because his voice is low, barely audible, refusing to leave his lips any louder or more imposing. Steve does not feel imposing. He does not feel justified, even though he has told himself over and over that he was. The words no longer ring true, even inside the protection of his own, biased mind. “In Siberia.”
“We also have some notes on it.” Bruce remembers, and then turns to Tony with focused eyes. “Remember when Loki ordered them to get Iridium?”

“You’re the one who makes the speeches.” His voice is sarcastic, nearly dismissive, and when Rogers’ jaw squeezes tight in that old quirk of his, the one Tony has come to associate with the imminence of an argument, he nearly regrets poking at this sore wound right at this moment, but in all truth, he’s too tired to care. “You’ll be better at it than any of us will.”
“Oh.” Steve pauses. “Can’t we order from somewhere else?”

Or maybe that’s just his way of trying to get something through Steve’s skull, even though all he seems to be doing is trying to shut himself off. “It’s not your fault Barnes fell off a train.

He thinks he is dying.
“If he can wish half the Universe was dead with a single snap, why can’t he wish them to go away just like that?” Barton asks.
Tony can’t help but reach for her hand, toying with her fingers and grazing the engagement ring. He looks up at her, and the way his heart stutters is just as powerful as it was years ago, and he wonders, when she looks back, if his eyes feel as unguarded and fond as he feels inside, if she can see the depth of his guilt, of his sorrow, if his body is even capable of translating in expression the nameless pit of sensation that storms within.

His eyes, the beard, the dark uniform - it gets under Tony's skin, somehow. “What happened out there? When he snapped his fingers?”

He gets into the elevator with a steaming fresh mug in his hands, feeling awkward and a little guilty, because he feels like he somehow misstepped in their earlier conversation, and he doesn’t like that idea.

The jealousy in her voice, her eyes, her everything – it’s so overwhelming.

Wanda is leaving. And so is Clint.
It has changed him, Steve recognizes. Not completely, not to the point where he doesn’t recognize himself, even though at some points, it almost looked like it did.

much like a kid would – it was natural, the protectiveness and care Tony developed for him, much like he had for DUM-E, despite the little twerp’s flaws. JARVIS had been the dream, too, the dream of taking technology farther than it ever had been. Maybe Jarvis, the human Jarvis, the man with all the answers and no nonsense from Tony’s memories, would have hated the idea of being transformed into a disembodied voice – it sounded like something he would say. But Tony’s need had been too big.
His eyesight starts to get dark at the edges, like a bad photo filter, and in a completely stupid move to keep himself awake, Tony brings his heavy, heavy head forward and slams it back again, much softer than he’s intended, because his neck can’t seem to be firm enough to hold the weight of his skull after all. But sure enough— There it is, the distant, dull sound, something that Tony seems to hear not by his ears, but by the back of his head, like it comes from the inside, and for some reason it

He can only watch, heaving and helpless, as Bruce lays down the book and runs his hands over his face, pushing his glasses up until they almost fall off his face, and he has to take them off before they break on the floor. He looks like he’s thinking so hard there should be smoke leaving his ears. He pulls up a chair and sits by the table, like he doesn’t have the strength to hold himself up anymore, and Tony jitters in place as he takes in a breath, clearly steeling himself for whatever he’s about to say, and Tony has no idea what that’ll be.

Why couldn’t he just pretend it hadn’t happened? No one would have to know. Not now. Not before he had the chance to make amends.

It throbs low, the way an old wound does, or like a fresh one, numb beneath a thick, foggy layer of haziness and emptiness. Or exhaustion. He’s not sure. All the knows is that the walls are too bare, his skin is hot but he still feels cold, and that the silence is suffocating.
“Okay.” Steve says, in a soft, incredulously happy tone. “Okay. We can… Where should we go?”
A haze of smoke swirls above their heads, moving along the air of the turbines like a whip, and even with the protection of the armor and the aid of his scans, he can’t see more than a few feet beyond the opening of the ramp.

“Where did he drop it that you found it and the government didn’t?” Rhodey asks, and when Tony averts his gaze and bites his lip, he says again, “Tony.”, with the tone that is a dangerous indicator that Rhodey is getting far too close to a subject Tony does not want to touch right now.

And Steve was fine with that. But then, when he woke up this morning, a blinking light informed him someone on the other side was trying to reach him for a call. And when he opened de comm, what King T’Challa told him was this:

He stopped when he discovered that Bucky was the Winter Soldier. But he didn’t stop because he decided to; he just threw himself into a different kind of fight, a different kind of pain, hurting and hurting and thinking it was normal. Then— trying to sacrifice himself in Sokovia. The Accords. The fight. So many instances in which he took violence as a necessity, and he hadn’t realized it.
Why can’t he? Why is he being punished for it? Why is the world trying to make him sound like a villain— When all he ever wanted was to be a hero?

With the way he— He has relied only on himself for almost his entire life, and he’s so damned afraid of repeating the agony that was caused by Bucky’s apparent death that doesn’t allow anyone to come as close to his heart as he should?

He can’t do it now.
“No one asked you.” Tony quips back, humorously. “You want me do to my magic on your suit, or are you just gonna sit here and complain about my children?”
Natasha makes a surprised sound, and her rings make only the tiniest bit of sound against her glass of champagne when she taps at it with her fingers, curiously. “That’s incredibly self-aware of you, I’m actually kind of proud.”

“Alright.” He backtracks. “I trust you.”

There were times, like when they took a break right after the Ultron attack, that the journals and papers got the whiff of their troubled relationship and were very quick to assume things about their personal life.

Steve, paying him a hundred bucks for a kiss? That’s funny. It is! Steve is much more of a bastard than most people would give him credit for, and despite what you might think, these kinds of comments are not unusual in the Tower. Every single one of the Avengers has a bit of a money problem, it seems, thankfully Tony has a lot of it – though he will be nice and admit that Bruce is very responsible when he wants to be. But the others? Fiends, heathens. Even Steve. In fact, Steve might be one of the worst, and Tony’s thankful Steve keeps his bets confined to their little band of misfits, or else he’d be completely bankrupt by now, from betting on every single team playing against the Yankees out of pure spite.

“Did you want it to be?”
the same.”
Tony clicks his tongue. “Right. And their escape is gonna be part of that report?”
“When you have a limited number of allies, organizing teams is more efficient.” Thor calmly arguments “It’s what we did, after we fled from Asgard.”
But they have to work.
(In his chest.)
Nothing too serious. They couldn’t do much, being in such a large group. They didn’t even have proper gear, making due with civilian clothes as they could, trying to blend in as much as possible. But now that there’s only three of them, Steve is sure they will get bolder, go deeper, act with more purpose – because he couldn’t make Wanda, who was still fragile, and Clint and Scott, who Steve still regrets to have brought to the fight, taking them away from their families, and get them back into conflict -, and it makes a strange kind of buzzing tingle beneath his bones, knowing he will go back to the fight, knowing he won’t be forced to stay still much longer.
But we'll go through them all, one by one - Starting in the next chapter, where we'll begin at the only possible starting point: the one and only, Pepper Potts.
“And that was all he said?” Jarvis insists.
It’s too fucking late for that. “We destroyed New York, Sokovia, and everywhere else. Nigeria was an accident— an accident I should have prevented. I wasn’t quick enough. She shouldn’t pay for that. It was my mistake.”
“You can't keep doing this, Tony.” She tells him, in a sharp, firm tone. “You can't do this. Not again.”
(He can’t.)
, but there’s no place safer than here. Not for us. I know you guys are superheroes or whatever, but I don’t
(He has to fix it.)
“You know.” Bruce says, when the silence stretches too far. “I – I gotta be honest, when I saw Wanda arrive at the Compound with you guys I was very surprised. I wasn’t expecting her to stay after what happened with Sokovia and Ultron. And it’s weird, that she stayed here, of all places, when…”
what I just said.” Pepper insists. “I’m not sitting here while you go out there and risk your life. I can help. So, I’m going too.”
And Tony thinks really, really hard if what he’s about to do is
(I guess this is it.)
“You know that if it’s changing the metal from one element to another, it’s Gamma Rays, right? Ionizing radiation.”
They would insult and hurt each other and then get distracted with the next shiny, explosive thing; They would face aliens and terrorists and Nazis and monsters, but they wouldn’t face each other.
He’s a hypocrite.
“So he got that one sometime in between the Reality and Time, because that’s what he took from Strange when we were up there.” Tony points out.
Jarvis is about to ask him what kind of
“Let’s do it then.” Rogers decides, like it’s just that simple.
“You went running?”
You see, that’s the thing with Howard Stark. He is
“What happened between you two?” Bruce asks, softly, almost like he’s afraid of startling Tony is he speaks too loudly, worried, and so, so kind, and Tony wants so badly to trust him, even though he’s
Now that he thinks about it, that he sees the book pass from hand to hand behind him under the scrutinizing gaze of his teammates, it doesn’t seem right, to have something that can simply control Time existing out there – and that this book, sitting here right in front of them, is an instruction manual on how to use it. That the Time Stone was just hiding here, and any crazy person who learned some magic and decided they could just pull on the threads of reality itself could simply have grabbed the Stone and changed everything.
(He must be strong.)
So strange… that feeling all of this would somehow equate to
ask Tony to stop for her, because Tony is saying that she
He can see it in his mind’s eye, still. It hurts now, it’s not pure and untouchable, it’s not
He died on the street.
That fucking monster. That – Tony has never felt anger such as this before.
They’re not the most functional people, but it’s nice. They fit nicely, together. They’re both men of action, but they’ve learned to use words so differently in their lives – Steve to attack, Tony to deflect, it’s strangely fitting that they would meet in the middle by doing the exact opposite.
to talk to him.”
and he doesn’t understand what’s going on.
They steer the conversation to another direction after that, deliberately avoiding all topics that might be too painful to approach. They talk for hours. It’s hard to keep the conversation light after that kind of beginning, but they do try. They talk about Bucky himself, and how he feels. They talk about Wakanda. They talk about time.
“Did you trust everyone you fought with?” Natasha questions in return. “Did you trust me, from the very beginning?”
of it. It has been a pleasure diving into Steve's mind and learning more about it, making connections and plotting what I feel like is a pretty realistic character development for him, and hopefully you have felt the same.
