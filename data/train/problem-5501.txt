"The burgers are good, just sit down."
"What the hell?"
They kept enthusing about the new gear as children with new toys on Christmas day and before long everything was ready for Load-Off.
"Yeah, Cas. You tell who you want to tell. We were just playing."
They arrived at the O'Hare International Airport, buzzing with people already. Dean was dropped off behind a neverending row of cars in the Departures section. Leaving the driver with a thank you nod, Dean shuffled inside, trying not to bump into anyone.
"I'm sorry. We don't have twin rooms available."
He leaves the mug to Sam as he speaks, running back to the bedroom, searching frantically for his phone. He comes back with a desperate look, his phone dead in his hand.
It was the afternoon before one of the shows in Chicago. Charlie had joined them a while ago, being in charge of merchandising. They had a blast later on the day after the shows, which got tiring pretty fast. It was fun having Charlie around, but Dean was starting to feel worn out from going to sleep so late every night, waking up at ungodly hours every morning. Since she was on merch, Charlie could wake up a little later than the rest of the team and be on her own schedule, loading and unloading the stands, checking inventory throughout the afternoon. Her busiest hours were actually when the doors opened since that's when fans usually bought t-shirts and other memorabilia while still making sure nothing ran out.
"Somebody has a little crush."
This chapter references smoking.
Castiel complied, feeling festive, and went back to find Dean, still with Penny and Kevin (whom Dean had told him about). Recognizing the grin on his face, Penny greeted "Hi chuckles! What are we celebrating?" grabbing a whiskey bottle. "I'm staying on tour!"
Castiel was reading a magazine, and he looked down at Dean casually, affirming with a small smile.
"Dean. Calm down. You didn't do anything. Yeah, you texted a little, but I stopped you before you could ruin things too much."
On the drive to the airport, Sam decided to try and have an essential conversation with Dean.
Sammy eyes their friends - crying for help - and after about 15 minutes and one last text, Dean finally gives his phone away to Anna.
The show was finally over, the fans were almost all outside, and everyone in the crew rushed over inside the stage for disassembly. A crowd of people stormed the stage, picking up pedals, cables, amplifiers, microphones, and everything else on it, wiping it clean in minutes. Everyone had their own target which made this a quick, though laborious, process.
What was supposed to be "a couple more shows" turned out to be two whole months after Dean's bickering. Michael kept saying, "I'm gonna book you a flight tonight. You deserve some time off." which never happened. Despite pleasing Dean, he missed Sammy and finally gave in to Michael's pressures.
Already walking back inside Dean yelled, "I'll be waiting."
"Not much of that going around.", and as Cas tilted his head in confusion, he added, "With living on a bus with 18 others and all that." Even after two months of getting to know this guy, he still didn't understand how clueless he was most of the time.
They said their goodbyes, Dean went through the check-in, and had a quiet flight. He listened to a newly made playlist, as to avoid thinking about Cas.
"What?"
Dean smiles, trying to catch a breath, at the same time he hopes Michael doesn't understand he thought he'd only be on the American leg of the tour.
In his matter-of-fact tone, Cas replied, "Didn't want to invade your personal space."
Cas was startled by this sudden reaction as she kept going.
"Because! They are oddly shaped and fall off my ears. Plus, these ones are just better quality."
"And we absolutely don't think women are sexual objects."
Dean swatted Castiel’s hands away, “Cas, stop.”
Castiel was already on his feet pulling on his khaki trench coat. “Let’s go.”
“Yes.” Dean screwed up his face, “Cas is gone, so what is the point!”
They approached the front barn doors and kicked them wide open. The children were quickly found in a feed closet and released. Dean was surprised when they turned and five vampires dressed in black with grinning skull faces barred their way to the exit.
Dean’s eyes shifted looking for what to say next, warring with continued honesty or assuagement. The angel’s tone scared him. Then the angel snorted. Dean’s eyes shot back to Castiel’s face. He tried to maintain the gravity of his expression, but couldn’t. A full, head thrown back laugh erupted from Castiel. It surprised Dean. Castiel was freely laughing like he hadn’t seen since they were teaching Jack the finer points of pop culture.
“He was seeing you in danger every day of his heaven.” Castiel pointed up, “That is the manifestation of hell’s atmosphere here in heaven.”
Castiel stepped through the doorway into the cozy home with the late afternoon sun streaming through the large pane windows into the wood paneled family room. In the hospital bed was the aged form of his dear friend Sam Winchester. Sam’s wrinkled and liver spotted hand was held in the hand of his adult son, Dean Jr. The angel brushed the back of his fingers across Sam’s brow to smooth out the grey hair. “It’s time.”
Dean’s eyes searched Sam’s face. “What?”
“Okay, good.” Sam threw a poignant glare at Castiel who entered behind Dean and gestured at the refrigerator and pantry “There’s no food and no coffee.”
---***---
Castiel stepped closer so that his knees touched Dean’s. He leaned over and kissed Dean atop the head at the hairline. He smelled of pine forests and smokey whiskey. Dean closed his eyes and let the warmth of Castiel’s lips melt into his skull. The next kiss landed between his knotted brows. Again, the kiss’s warmth melted past his skin. A tingling sensation danced over his scalp and he tilted his face up.
Castiel disappeared with a woosh.
When they were able to comfortably separate, they both hit the head to clean up. Dean pretty much scampered across the hall thinking Sam could come out of his room. Castiel thought it funny and strode with confidence. In the washroom, Dean fussed in the toilet stall for a moment making some odd noises then started to the communal shower. Castiel followed with his angelic sight reading all the mixed, unclear colors of Dean’s aura.
“Stable?” Castiel pointed to the sky that was struggling to clear.
“Help.” A weak breath exhaled from Dean’s unmoving lips.
Zack leaned back in his chair. “Sam Winchester is in heaven!”
The black, windowless commercial van pulled up to the house about fifteen minutes after Dean parked the Impala at the side of the property. The two vampires dressed in burglar black and rubber skull hoods that Sam expected got out and walked up to the front porch steps. Dean and Sam came up behind them. Dean beheaded one with his machete and Sam double tapped the other. A short session of interrogation got them the location of the nest.
“Knock it off, it's fully stocked.” Dean pulled out a plate with rolled food stacked up like Lincoln logs.
The t-rex juked to the side with a roar to dodge the glass grenade of holy water Dean flung. Dean took the opening to go to his brother. Sam was grey.
The dominating bulk kicked in Dean’s ribs. “You think you can just hunt us down with a couple of pig stickers and a pair of balls! Bullshit!”
---***---
Dean nodded and they both got into the impala.
“Shouldn’t we wait until morning, when they’re not as powerful?”
The janitors fidgeted with their bucket and wet floor sign as if they were highly sensitive pieces of equipment.
Dean balked, but obeyed. He slowly got up and turned himself over so that he was on his hands and knees on the mattress. Castiel left the bed to get the bottle from the bedside table. Dean watched him closely.
Dean stood. No situation was going to have control of him. He was taller than the angel and the perspective shift, and his memories of his time as a demon, gave him a jolt of lewd confidence. He brought his lips down upon Castiel’s, this time parting the angel’s mouth so that his tongue could explore. Castiel tasted like honey.
Sam smiled. “You know, this being technically alive thing might actually come in handy in my new role.”
“This night happened thirty-eight years ago!” Sam released him with a shove and threw up his hands.
“Rowena?” Sam approached the bird.
Castiel turned with eyes glowing but the mass engulfed him and drug him out the barn door.
---***---
---***---
Castiel glowered sideways at Sam.
Dean rolled to bring his knife up, having difficulty securing a target from the stars in his vision. He slashed and kicked like a feral cat. The knife found a sheath in one of the vampire’s chests, but the vampire jerked itself to the side using its own body to wrench the knife from Dean’s grip. Dean kept swinging until both his arms were broken and his face bloody. Dean was dragged screaming his futile rage to the center of the barn and tossed alongside the bodies of the children he and Sam had come to save. Dean spit blood from his quickly swelling lips. “I’m going to kill every one of you sons of bitches.”
“Who in the hell do you think you are? John Wayne? John Wick?” The largest of the vampires dressed in black leather biker jackets and cheap Halloween skull hoods stood over Dean.
In the corridor of Ward 2020, a couple of angels in janitorial jumpers waited with a yellow commercial mop bucket in front of Dean Winchester’s door, shining the soot like dust off the columns of brass date plaques marking the date of his death. Most of them were the same date on a Tuesday. The door suddenly opened and Castiel was vomited out into the corridor covered in black ooze. A moment later Naomi stepped out of the wall of black miasma framed by the door jamb as if she were walking in waist deep water.
“Yes, the war is over.” Castiel leaned over and kissed Dean atop his head. “But sometimes those fighting don’t know that.”
The angel paused. “I’m sorry Dean.”
“I can make him sleep.” She offered, “He will just close his eyes and rest until the second coming.”
Castiel stepped up and stood at a distance behind Naomi kneeling with the frantic soul in her arms. Castiel looked at Dean the way a tired parent looks at a very sick and troubled child, with deep love tinged with heart ache.  Dean’s eyes grew wide. The puddles of black puddles from the paused storm outside the barn roiled and coalesced into a thick, black wall of ooze. It moved with an amorphous sentience, creeping into the barn toward the angels and Dean.
“Come with me. You look tired.” Castiel took Dean’s hand and they went to Dean’s bedroom. The place was a mess. The bed was unmade. Clothing covered the floor and left-over takeout boxes; beer and liquor bottles covered every flat surface. Dean looked ashamed.
“I am an archangel now, Dean.” Castiel answered plainly, “Like Michael, Lucifer, and Gabriel were.”
Thunder shook the barn. Lightning split the sky and defined every warped gap between the slats of the walls. Rain fell in large, crude oil drops that evaporated from the ground into a fog as thick and acrid as the smoke from a burning tire. The night had started high and clear with a full moon, but out of nowhere the weather had turned sinister. The two young boys Sam and Dean had come to rescue were looking from the maelstrom outside to the desperate fight between the monsters and their would-be heroes. Somehow, the howling wind blustered backwards, sucking the inward swinging doors to slam shut. The wood-splitting bang and the children’s frightened cries turned Dean’s attention momentarily.
Dean drove like a bat out of hell. Sam unbuckled as Dean parked the car neatly in front of the spooky, abandoned barn at the end of an overgrown, nearly invisible country driveway. His brother got out and slammed the door. Between the rumble of the engine and the slamming of the driver’s door one might as well play shave and a haircut on the car horn.
“And what news do you bring us?” Jowls asked. The severe looking woman next to him narrowed her lackluster eyes.
Sam was straddling the center line. His knife was in his hand, but it felt inadequate. Squinting didn’t help to define the large shadow looming under the pine canopy. The flexible trunks of the trees swayed. Sam moved his fingers in an intricate circle. Nothing happened. Sam rolled his eyes and tried again. Magic worked in hell. It would be a real inconvenience for it not to work in heaven.
Dean’s eyes said
Memories of their last moments together, of Jack walking away, of his own death clawed at his heart. He was weak and he was stupid. He remembered his last job with his brother; how he had purposely gone into the fight not intending to come away from it and to not die alone. His grief had clouded his judgement. Castiel put a soft palm on Dean’s cheek. The memories of his hellish nightmare loop washed over him and the many, many times Castiel had been before him only to be wrenched away. Dean’s breath caught in his throat.
Naomi expanded her radiant influence and from the blinding light her voice was even toned. “One. Two. Three.”
Dean eased the kiss to an end and looked into Castiel’s eyes. Those ice blue eyes were bright with his inner light. His emotions were up. Their hands were quick to help each other out of shirts, shoes, trousers and jeans. Dean placed his hands on Castiel’s shoulders and made sure he fell to the bed first pulling the angel over top of him. Castiel rained kisses over Dean’s face and down his neck. Both of them were flush and breathing deeply of each other. Castiel ran his lips over Dean’s collar bone. The skin reminded him of the finest suede he had ever touched. Dean’s heart was thundering just behind his sternum. Castiel could feel Dean’s member pressing up against his stomach. It was like a nightstick, throbbing. Castiel trailed kisses down Dean’s chest and over his navel.
“Oh, shit…” Sam wasn’t scared. This was just going to be very disadvantageous.
“Good morning Dean.” Castiel said and laid a hand on Dean’s head.
Dean brought him up and kissed him with a soft, happy smile on his face. “What about you?”
“Yes, to Canton.”
“You two need a moment. I’ll see you tomorrow.” Sam left the room.
Castiel had just enough time to raise his head halfway up the mast so that the rush spilled over his tongue and didn’t choke him going straight down the back of his throat. It was a mouth full tasting of Dean’s essence and the ocean. Castiel let Dean’s body down easily from the shuddering orgasm, slipping his finger out and cleaning up every last trace of it with his mouth.
“Overkill?” Dean mocked.
Castiel tasted the faintly sweet promise from the tip. Dean let his head fall back and his hands worked the sheets while Castiel’s head bobbed. It felt amazing. The angel’s soft lips ground down around his cock while his exacting tongue wrapped down one side then the other. On the upward motion Castiel sucked, making the blood rush from Dean’s brain to his lower head.
“Are you crying?” Sam asked.
“Yes. So, you need to find a way out.”
“No way!” Dean said incredulously, yanking open the fridge.
Castiel hushed him with a kiss, “I want you on all fours.”
Dean stopped in front of the fridge. Sam looked like he got the rise, but not the shine. “I sure did.”
“Ah, I was wondering where you acquired your taste for the better things in life.” Dean waggled his eyebrows.
His desk drawers had a gun that looked functional on first inspection and a collection of various burner phones like it ought to. The dresser had his clothes in it. The night stand had his water glass and an old bottle of over-the-counter pain pills and vitamin supplements on top. However, the drawers were oddly staged. His stash of very personal possessions were there but missing items or items were represented with generic replicas.
“Cas lived!” Sam snarled, “When have Winchesters ever stayed dead!”
Castiel continued his explanation, “I have all the terrible powers Michael and Lucifer had to smite and destroy. I have all the amazing powers to heal and build like they did too. Lucifer at one time could and did bring light and joy to the world. And like Gabriel, I can experience the world like humans do. I think that is the best perk. Though, I wasn’t expecting you to accept me so, um, much.”
Dean closed his eyes, trying to let himself enjoy Castiel’s touch. The angel knelt behind Dean and worked the knots out of the muscles so that Dean’s breath was long and even. Dean could hear the click of the lube being opened and then the cool, slick massage between his buttocks. His ass took the first digit easy.
“Castiel.” Naomi, once the fierce corrective psychologist of heaven, knocked respectfully on the glass door to the gleaming office that was once hers. “It is happening again.”
Dean interrupted. “I am so sorry! I was just driving and thinking that if this is heaven then I could change it to more than just what I can remember. So I was thinking about Jurassic park…”
Sam excused himself from Dean and found a park bench. Dean militantly went on a mission to obtain happiness in the form of fruit and buttery crust. He rejoined his brother on the bench with a large box top in hand. Inside was a slice of pie from every pie on offer. Sam felt bad for making a comment on Dean’s emotions. They were both in a machismo stalemate on who would break down first. Sam pied Dean in the face, a forced act of levity.
He scooted up to the table, rested his forearms on the table’s edge and interlaced his fingers. “I have some excellent news.”
“Oh.” Dean croaked when a finger slick with Castiel’s saliva wandered from the cupping of his balls to the puckered entrance behind. Dean spread his legs wider. The finger played around the opening, over the balls, around the base and then back down moving more of the wetness from the front to the back. When the back was slick, Castiel eased a single digit into Dean down to the last knuckle. Dean’s whole body shivered and he hissed, “Cassss...”
Sam saw the plate and became very unsettled. It held breakfast sausage links rolled in thin crepe-like pancakes on a nest of shredded hash browns. Dean put it in the microwave where it heated almost instantly. Dean presented the plate of sausage rolls with a flourish, one already shoved into the pocket of his cheek.  Sam recoiled from the Pig’n a Poke rolls.
“You done?” Dean stepped around to the front of his glossy black 1967 Impala in pristine condition while adjusting the waistband of his jeans. He pulled out a bottle of sanitizer from his pocket and offered it to Sam.
Sam followed his brother to the trunk of the Impala. Dean was playing with a flea market ninja star. Sam remembered how Dean joked and didn’t take this night seriously; pressuring Sam to only take a machete instead of the gun. Sam had always wondered if Dean had intended for both of them to die tonight. Sam let Dean’s weapon selection play out exactly as it had with him settling only on his trusty machete and pressuring himself to do the same. Sam took the machete he remembered, but also took the pistol with the deadman’s blood rounds.
“Have a good day at work!” Dean said cheerfully and accepted another kiss from Castiel on his cheek.
“Cas, help Sam.” Dean knelt over the mess that was his brother.
“Yes.”
Dean’s hand fumbled for the off button on the antique brass alarm clock and he sat up stiffly from another night of hard, alcohol induced sleep. Tail wagging, Miracle wasted no time in sharing his enthusiasm for the day. If it wasn’t for Miracle’s exuberance, Dean wouldn’t have purpose to rise in the morning. He gripped the blonde terrier tight against his chest.
Dean drove well above the speed limit as the sun sank below the horizon. Sam found his phone in his back pocket. It was a nearly 40 year old model. He nearly gave the voice command to unlock it and then remembered that he had to use a pin number. He couldn’t remember the pin exactly but the phone opened on the first try, which Sam was certain was wrong since it was Dean Jr’s birthday he had entered. The phone opened and Sam brought up the GPS app.
Dean shoved another sausage roll into his cheek.
---***---
They made it to the house outside of Canton that Sam remembered. It was just far enough from the burbs to be considered rural and still accessible by the highway the previous murders and abductions occurred on. Both children in residence were in the proper age range according to the homeschool roster Sam had hacked into.
Once Dean was out of earshot Sam drew up to his full height over Castiel. “Do you have any idea what you have done? What is at risk here?”
“No.” Sam said coldly. If he was going to be forced to relive this awful night, it was going to play out much differently.
“I haven’t been fucked in a very, very long time.” Dean grinned and reached for the nightstand’s top drawer. He pulled out a serious sized bottle of intimate lubricant.
Dean dallied at the table with his breakfast. Sam gave a pointed nod to the dishes and got up to do the chores Dean didn’t have a care to do. Reluctantly, Dean finished his meal and mechanically started to wash the cookware and plates. Miracle got to help take care of the egg bits stuck to the plate.
Sam drew the pistol with his free hand. Five precise shots later and each vampire was on their knees with a weeping hole between their brows. Astonishment had Dean moving to cover the young boys’ eyes as Sam stomped forward and methodically beheaded each vampire. When he was done he tossed the blade to the bloody straw and left the barn.
A tittering in the tree line distracted him from his thoughts. It sounded like the squirrels were frantic about something. A bird of prey most likely since he had heard a hawk call periodically almost repetitively intermixed with the usual sounds of the woods. It was odd that Dean’s heaven omitted things in the bunker but remembered the specific sounds of nature. The commotion grew and the birds started calling out too. A cardinal shot out and swooped low across the highway, its wings fluttering in distress. It landed on a low pine branch and chirped insistently.
“When did you start caring about that? We’re Winchesters and this is what we do. Are you going to leave those kids to those monsters for another night?”
“Remember when I was a demon?”
---***---
Sam sat up and let Dean pull him to his feet. “Cas…”
Sam entered the galley and flicked on the light. It was clean and everything was in order the way he had liked to keep it. He picked up the carafe from the coffee maker and filled it with water. Then he reached for the canister of ground coffee. It was empty. Sam tilted it toward the light and there wasn’t even the dust of grounds in the bottom. He put the canister down and opened the lower cabinets to refill the canister from the pantry stock. The cabinet looked fully stocked, but every box, can and bag of staple goods was empty or oddly a solid object like set props. Maybe Dean thought that breakfast kind of made itself every morning. It would make sense because usually when Dean cooked, he made a big production of buying the ingredients and following the recipe exactly even if they had the ingredients already in the pantry. That’s how they had ended up with so many bottles of partially used spices. At least most of the extra spices could be used in simple witchcraft and extra table salt never went to waste.
The beast swung his maw over Sam’s head. Dean fired his pistol. “
Dean tentatively reached out and took Castiel’s hand. His grip was masculine in the way that could be received as romantic or dismissed as just brotherly love.
---***---
“Come on.” Sam led Dean inside their old home. Dean followed with his eyes cast down in heavy thought.
Dean stopped him and smelled the angel’s hair and eyed his crotch. He smelled spring fresh and was perfectly unsullied. “Cas, you don’t need a shower. Let me have a moment.”
“Is there anything else?” Sam nudged the plate away.
Dean ushered the children out and into the backseat of the car. He met Sam at the trunk where he was just tossing his gun back into the trunk instead of putting it back in its place. “Did you have to do that in front of the kids?”
“Great!” Dean jumped out of bed and grabbed a t-shirt and lounge pants from the dresser. When he turned back around Castiel was up and assembled, clothes pressed sharply and him smelling fresh.
“No!” Naomi took a measured step back at the force with which Castiel spoke, “You are not to do anything more than reset his heaven.”
“I know.” Castiel stood with his hands in his pockets. He didn’t bother to bless away the filth clinging to him. His subordinate crossed her arms. She was being particularly grating.
Castiel stepped down from the dead beast’s skull. The animal’s blood faded from the angel’s trench coat. When he got to Sam’s prone body his ensemble was gloriously dry cleaned and the surrounding gore and carcass had disappeared. A single caress from the angel had Sam put back together.
The ground rumbled. Sam backed up from the shoulder of the road away from the tree line. Rowena flitted into the opposite tree line. “See you later, your majesty.”
Castiel was gone. Dean came up behind Sam. “He didn’t stay after that?”
“Sam. Dean.” Castiel greeted them as they came down the iron staircase to the situation room. When Sam saw the angel, he knew this was not the dreamscape of a jin or any other reality bending fiend. This was heaven, Dean’s heaven. Castiel ignored Sam’s glare of daggers and took in Dean’s rigid form standing a few steps up behind Sam.
“Okay.” Castiel started to move past Dean.
“You and Crowley!” Both Castiel’s eyebrows shot up.
Sam stopped in front of Dean’s bedroom door. He could hear the murmurs of conversation inside. It sounded peaceful and domestic like the conversations he and his wife Aileen would have on a lazy Sunday morning. The rage simmered down a bit and a soft smile played across his lips. He silently wished Dean a very good morning and went to the galley to wait for Castiel with a cup of coffee.
“Dean.” Castiel had used his free hand to moisten his cock and was forcing it to be patient.
Jowl’s hefty hands wrapped around his fountain pen which he tapped impatiently.  “And the other order of business?”
“With Crowley, I don’t know.”
“Castiel, I have done everything I can. He doesn’t belong here. If this keeps up, he is going to become a demon and we might as well just leave the gates wide open and install an escalator.”
Castiel straightened from his kneeling position and fervently kissed Dean again. With a hardy appetite, Dean returned it. The angel took a moment to scan his beloved soul with his angelic sight. Dean’s aura was still muddy with a black, brown and grey fog swirling about him near the floor, but around his heart and head grew an optimistic ray of sunshine yellow with fringes of courage flickering in campfire orange. From his heart to his loins snaked a ribbon of lustful red. Castiel blinked his angelic sight from his eyes so he could see Dean’s ivy green eyes without the glow of his soul washing them out. His crying had left them red rimmed, but the early crows’ feet at the corners were impishly suggestive.
The young nephilim had gotten hung up on the idea that Darth Vader was actually a good guy working within the empire because he used evil as a tool to create a hostile work environment that hampered the free sharing of information. From Jack’s perspective Darth Vader also allowed for the flaw that led to the Death Star’s destruction based on the same tactic he used as a kid to destroy the droid command station and may have even had a hand in leaking the schematics to the rebel forces since it was destroyed in episode six, Return of the Jedi, after Darth Vader reveals he is Luke’s father in episode five, The Empire Strikes Back. The argument had made Dean suddenly question his own strict dichotomous understandings of one of his favorite fandoms. Dean’s spluttering attempt to refute Jack’s reasoning had Castiel in stitches.
“I hope you lead the Men of Letters to a brighter future than your father did, Director.”
“Where am I? Where are we?”
Castiel laughed.
Sam sucked the wind back into his lungs and backwards elbow crawled out from between the tree sized legs. The thing ignored him to snap its massive jaws upwards trying to dislodge the blade. Sam tried to stand, but dizzily stumbled, falling on his bad arm. Blood coated his entire left side. Shock had definitely set in because he couldn’t feel any pain past the freezing fingertips.
---***---
Castiel left the washroom concerned. He paced the hall briefly and then went to the hall closet. While Dean was busy, Castiel retrieved extra pillows and the plushest duvet he had ever seen, obviously sourced by Mrs. Butters at one time. He took the haul back to Dean’s room.
The table looked to the young woman, the only one standing. She smiled nervously, “I’m sure Mr. Smith will be in shortly.”
Dean stopped in front of the shower room entrance and turned to Castiel, “That’s the second time you’ve looked at me like that.”
“You have been sick for a very long time.” Castiel answered and laid two fingers on Dean’s brow.
“Cas no.”
“Shhh Dean.” The angel turned and knelt by Dean on the floor. She took the mess of a man in her arms and let the light of heaven make him whole again. “Sam’s not here. He never was. Remember he is alive, you are in heaven? You’ve got to stop this.”
“Let’s hope they’re not early risers.” Dean gave the engine more gas.
Dean kissed Castiel.
“Now?” Sam questioned, “In the middle of the night?”
“I did not expect a demon dinosaur.” Castiel considered. “And it wasn’t Dean’s?”
The severe looking woman with hawkish eyes sitting next to the man with the jowls tapped her long claws. They were painted to suggest artificial nails, but were not fooling anyone. She sniffed. “There is nowhere you need to be Gregory. All the channels to Earth are still closed tight. Queen Rowena has seen to that.”
Sam shook his head. “No.”
Before the jowls could waggle again, the elevator at the end of the conference room dinged. The rusted doors squealed in their tracks. The fluorescent lights inside the car flickered spastically. All eight pairs of jet black eyes turned in unison. Out stepped Mr. Zack Smith with his trademark smirk pulling at one side of his smug mouth and his own eyes a fiery red.
“No.” Dean blinked his wet eyes, dispelling a memory that would never be made. Sam was still seeing Eileen, but she refused to come anywhere near the bunker or Dean. Jack and Castiel were gone, and he knew deep down, for good this time.
Castiel glared at her.
---END---
“Ok. What is the point?” Castiel got serious.
“Dean.” A woman’s voice came from the light before a slim silhouette manifested.
Sam stepped off the landing and crossed the room to Castiel. The angel stiffened at the imposing man. Sam brought him into an embrace with no warmth in it.
“Sit down.”
Dean’s body went limp in Naomi’s arms, defeated.
Lecherous grins split the faces of all around the table.
Sam braced himself for the teeth to sink in, but the thing stopped to chuff on the back of his neck. Sam twisted, letting his shoulder rip under the creature’s foot. Their eyes were black orbs for a split second before they cleared to reptilian yellow. The four-inch folding knife sank into the beast’s nostril. The t-rex scattered back shaking its head and snorting. A trickle of blood ran freely over its lips and teeth.
“Shhh.” Castiel ran a firm, warm palm over the back of Dean’s neck, pressing where the spine met the skull and then caressing down the spine.
“So what kind of things exactly?” Dean looked like he expected laser eyes.
Then the pause button on reality was pressed. Dean eyes, frozen in the wide eyed stare of a man on the edge of death, beheld a glorious, pure light force the barn door wide open again.
Dean took the book from Castiel’s chest and put it back on the shelf. “The war is over.”
“You and your tiny bladder are in the way of progress. We need to get to Canton before those vamp mimes strike again.”
A young man with dark hair and warm hazel eyes sat on the edge of the bed, “You can come in Castiel. He is asleep.”
“Are you not just the smartest ass there ever was!” The bird chirped out.
Dean gives Sam a look as if he is insane. Of course, it's not worth finding out. Castiel is very much straight, he could never feel the same way, and he would feel awkward around Dean if he ever found out about this crush.
Okay so here is the first chapter! I made this one as a way to introduce the reader to Dean's (alternate) world and how he's living in this story, and I thought I'd make him meet Cas in this one so it wouldn't be too technical or boring for you guys. I hope the language used is accessible for everyone, if there's something you missed I'll be glad to explain what things are in the comments. I don't write much and I'm also not a native English speaker but I had this idea in my head and really wanted to try it out. If no one reads it at least it's taking my mind off things, but if you do read it I hope you enjoyed it <3
Arranging the pillows to accommodate all three of them, Penny informed: "We're watching Coyote Ugly."
By the time he arrived at the front porch, Sam's ugly car was already in front of the garage, so he had to park near the sidewalk. His plan to help mom make the roast beef had gone down the pipe; at least Bobby hadn't arrived yet.
Halfway through the song, Anna gave up while each of the participants struggled to keep up with the song.
The food arrived, and they dug in, Dean making fun of Sam's mimosa - "That's a chick's drink." "Well, I'm not the one with a crush on a guy." as he sipped at with a satisfied grin. - and Dean decided to change the topic once again.
Dean came back alone - Gabriel stayed back flirting with some random person - smiling dumbly at his phone.
"Yeah don't worry about it. Anyway... Nick decided to step out to build a family or something. A bunch of bullshit if you ask me. I loved the guy, we were pretty good friends, but leaving this? All of this? For a normal life? It doesn't make any sense to me. Yeah this life is hard and we travel a lot but I mean.. I always manage to spend time with Sammy and my parents every time we go through town. Hell, I even get holidays and stuff. And we talk on the phone almost every day so it's not that bad you know?" Dean beamed when he said the words "This. All of this" and his eyes showed how much he loved his family, even though one might think differently the way he talked about being on tour. Castiel thought he was a beautiful man right when he saw him but after this hearty confession, he started to believe Dean was a very good person, which made him even more attractive. The guitars were strung, the amps were ready and the pedals were plugged in so they had a small pause before Soundcheck. Castiel was about to go get some coffee and ask Dean if he wanted something from the cafeteria when Dean got a facetime call. "You mind if I answer this?" Castiel assented with his head.
Cas gives him a lost look, so he explains: "The song? It reminds me of my biological father. My mother... she died in a fire when I was young. After that, our dad started drinking... he stopped feeding Sam." The words were coming out dry, visibly difficult to say. He paused a moment before continuing, "He kept looking for whoever set the fire, started going insane. There were times we didn't even have a place to sleep, had to crash in the car. Other times we stayed at crappy motels. This lasted for a while until he, supposedly, found the arsonist. And he went off, leaving Sam and me alone, again, he was about four then. I raised him all that time. And then John, our father, died. When he didn't come back, I assumed that's what happened, at least. I used to do it before, too, but after a few hours, I went to a grocery store to steal some food for us. I was caught that time... They sent us to the foster care system, and, eventually, we were adopted by our family. So Sammy got to go to college, and I got to play guitar, which I loved. And here I am today. They put me in therapy. I was in pretty bad shape. After a few years of it, I understood none of it was my fault."
Dean waited, but as he didn't get an answer, he decided to get on with his afternoon plans - he had already spent enough time thinking about his childhood for one day.
Dean sat down, saying hello to everyone: Garth, Anna, Rowena, Gabriel, and Crowley. Rowena and Crowley were actually cousins, and they were the biggest helpers of Dean's "rock trade" in school. Garth and Anna were, like Sammy, theatre kids, and that's where they met. Oddly, Gabriel was part of both groups and brought the gang together with his fun personality. Though they had several other friends in common, most of them were out of town, so they fell apart a little.
"You're getting a month off whether you like it or not. You'll meet us back at the end of the American leg and join us for Europe."
While Dean rummaged through his old records, he remembered how he had acquired them. Back then, he had been going to therapy for a few years, so making friends in school was becoming attainable, even after all the trauma he had been through. He finally felt he could talk to his parents to some degree, which he hadn't been able to when they were adopted, too afraid they would hurt him, but mostly Sammy. He had been responsive to music, and that was when Harry gifted him the record player, taking him to a record store so he could choose a few records. He knew a few covers from the cassettes on the Impala (which he had inherited except he didn't know yet); he chose Led Zeppelin and Metallica as his first and buried himself in the music, hoping it would take the pain away.
"Let me check... Ah yes. Double room, 102."
"It's fine. We'll make a pillow barrier if you're uncomfortable. I don't move at all in my sleep so I promise I won't bother you."
"What's it about?"
"Yeah, but not a bed!"
--------------
The worst part of it all was the 2-hour flight to New York, and then the 7-hour flight to the UK the following morning. Sam had offered to get him to the airport again, but since he had stayed home for the night, Dean offered (or forced, rather) to drive the Impala and have Sam bring it back home.
"It's awesome.", Charlie said while setting up the TV.
"Yeah, I've been working locally. This is my first big gig though.", Castiel answers happily. "Why did your friend Nick leave?"
"A little? Wow... Don't want to imagine how it's gonna be when you fall in love, then."
A while later, Castiel came outside the bathroom fully dressed after Dean had reconsidered and gathered his things to hop in the shower next. Cas moves to the farther side of the bed, getting ready for his usual reading before sleep, feeling more refreshed now and a little less tired.
"Good night, what can I do for you?"
Sam gives him a little smirk as they start crossing the street towards the building.
Penny gets super excited, getting up on the bed instantly.
As Ruth puts down her amazing roast beef, Sam shows Dean some stuff on Instagram, and Bobby talks with Harry about something far too specific for them to understand. They dig in, chatting lively, Ruth asking Sammy about his work - he couldn't give out details because of confidentiality issues - the subject changes to Dean's job.
Sam was a little uncomfortable but answered, "Well, I just... in psychological terms, we want to know how much it actually affects kids. On the law side of it, we want to protect them... So no kid ever gets to the point we did."
Dean was pleased to hear this. Not hearing complaints meant Cas was doing an, at least, satisfactory job, and he was friendly, so that meant a lot to everyone so the chances of him getting fired were slim.
He goes to the bathroom, leaning on Garth, and Sam announces to the others, "Okay, I'm gonna have to take him home. You guys have to help me." Now looking at Crowley, "No bargaining for him to stay."
But it was Harry, asking if they were going home in the afternoon or not.
--------------
Sipping his coffee, he looks up confused... until...  "Oh my god." His hand is suddenly on his forehead, worry spreading rapidly, "Oh fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck. No... What have I done."
After a while, the show started, everything going according to plan. Enjoying the show from backstage, Cas looked at Dean several times. He liked to see him that relaxed after working so hard to have everything going smoothly. He knew the pride he felt when Ben came down the stage every night telling him he did a good job with his guitars when he asked to review some things for a different setlist. It was the same pride he felt when Mark or Michael told him he had done a good job with the bass. Cas wasn't very close with Mark yet since he and the bassist had only known each other for a few months. But he was getting there, and it felt good to bask in the fruits of their work every night. He was going to miss Dean this next month, though stepping up his game to make him proud would definitely keep him busy. Plus, he has a lot of people to hang out with, who he's sure won't let him feel left out. Another song starts, and he notices he's been staring at Dean for a long time. He goes out to give Ben another guitar, bringing back the black one he was using. Setting it down while humming the beginning of the song, he took longer than usual to get back to his place, and Cas found that odd. His attention is brought elsewhere when one of the technicians asks for his help on a bass-related matter. Leaving for a few minutes, he comes back during the second chorus, and he finds himself looking at Dean involuntarily. His heart twisted for a moment when he caught a glimpse of Dean's green eyes, wet, while he was mouthing the words along "You make me wanna die / And everything you love / Will burn up in the light / And every time I look inside your eyes / You make me wanna die." closing his eyes slightly. Cas hurried to him "What's wrong?". Dean smiled at him, eyes closed, still crying, banging his head, "It's nothing, it's an awesome song, that's all."
"A gift? Cas, you don't have to do that." Although his words didn't show it, he felt entertained.
Sam's singing is mocking but affectionate, and Dean smiles a little but still snaps, "Cut it off."
"But what if he likes you back? Isn't that worth finding out?"
"Hey! That was Charlie, she's joining us in Seattle." Before Castiel had the chance to ask who Charlie was Dean started picking stuff up while saying "Let's go, time for Soundcheck."
"Hey! Michael."
thanks for reading and I'll see you (hopefully) next week
i just want to address the events happening in the us and syria right now: it's really hard to see all of this unfold while being here unable to help in any way but i hope you guys are staying safe <3
(See the end of the chapter for
"Yeah, when our bass tech left, that's how I was for months. But Cas been managing well?"
"I don't know, man. Why do you think I stay in America? It's 'cuz I can drive everywhere."
At the end of the meal, Dean got a text so Sam took the opportunity,  "Is that your boyfriend?"
"She was doing pretty good, huh? Didn't even faint or anything." Cas answered in a serious voice, "Dean." but broke down laughing right after.
He got some flowers nearby and got inside the old cemetery. Reaching his parent's graves, he carefully put the flowers on top of Mary's grave, standing in silence. He didn't know what to say. All he knew was all his words would be for his mother. He felt a lump in his throat as if he was about to cry, and he wouldn't be able to stop.
Sam said jokingly, "And you didn't invite us?"
Cas' bags were already in a corner of the bedroom, where he promptly walked to retrieve his toiletries so he could have a much-needed shower.
His last few days in town were spent between family and friends. Bowling, having brunch with Sam (Dean didn't want to admit he actually liked that), going out for drinks with the gang, family activities with Harry and Ruth, going to the movies (he missed that so much). But what he had missed the most were the little things he didn't have on tour. His mother's homemade meals, staying in one place for a while, the sense of familiarity, hanging out with his dad and hearing his jokes, chilling out in the back garden without the rush of tour life.
"Dude, that's a lot of times. Have you ever heard the song?" Sam looks horrified, but Dean, Gabriel, and Rowena are in right away. Anna is reluctant but joins in while Garth and Sam stay back, watching this horrible, horrible decision unfold.
"Great! We'll keep you working with Dean for a couple more shows and then I'll send him home for a few days so you'll take over the whole station for two shows. Dean won't like it so let me be the one to tell him."
It was getting nearer to 11 a.m., and Dean was getting nervous each minute. The night before, he had taken Cas' help, and they both made a playlist so he'd have something to listen to on the plane. Just before boarding, another text came in.
"Metallica." "Good. Then get your sandman on!" Cas says this happily, believing he did a good Metallica reference. "Did you just say 'Get your sandman on'?" Dean bursts laughing. "What the hell does that mean?" Shortly he's tearing up, incapable of speaking. "Don't they have a song called Enter Sandman?", this only makes Dean laugh even more, getting Cas equally confused but delighted he at least made Dean laugh when he was so worried about his flight tomorrow.
"I have to go talk to him." and with that, he bolted after Michael, leaving Cas perplexed.
The elevator gets them to the fifth floor pretty quickly. The group walks down the corridor to the two-bed hotel room. Charlie opens the door and Castiel sees it's not too different from his own room. It was an old-fashioned room with pastel walls, two beds in the middle of the room with a window directly in view from the door. The biggest difference from his room was the bathroom, which was bigger, and the television, which he didn't have at all. The beds, in bright white sheets and old-fashioned bedframes, could be brought together, or Charlie and Penny made it seem that way since it was the first thing they did. The bathroom contrasted with the overall look of the room, being more modern and minimalist.
She was wearing a crew jacket that seemed too big for her small figure. Her red hair shone with the sunlight hitting her back while she was putting batteries in the camera. She looked up, recognizing Dean's voice, stating playfully:
"I'm sorry to be calling, but I don't have enough time to text. Can you give me your address? I saw something that reminded me of you, and Charlie told me you would like it, so I want to send it to you."
"So, dearie. How have you been?"
"Oh.. I know. It's just.. I didn't have a dark coat and it was a bit chilly out." he promptly removes the trenchcoat, setting it aside, and Dean notices how well defined he is behind the plain black shirt he's wearing underneath. "He just got in and you're already drooling over the man get a grip on yourself Dean.", he thought.
"Oh, I've never seen it." Castiel broke out of his trance.
"You're really afraid of flying?" Cas is struggling to say this without laughing, remembering how worried he got about nothing. After a very small "yeah, I told you." and a shameful look, Castiel asks, "Why?"
Dean's smile turned even more mischievous, assuming Cas found the scenes hot as he did. He slapped his friend on the shoulder, jokingly, "Way to go Cas. I'm telling you, there's only one reason to watch that movie and it ain't the plot."
"Hey. Dean! What are you doing?"
Dean was beaming with happiness. Having all of his family together and getting to drive Baby all in one day? Plus having an awesome job that allows him to be near music all the time? Dean had all he could ask for.
"Yup. I have time for dinner tomorrow." Sam, who was returning from the kitchen, presumably had heard Dean's question.
The next morning they left for the airport, stopping at the 24h hotel bar for Dean's cup of coffee - "I'm already afraid of planes, Cas, you want me to be annoyed too?"
"Hey Cas, come check this ou..."
"Sammy, give me a charger. Please."
"Man, I can't believe this." Dean seemed worried.
Dean's stomach had some sort of reaction at how Castiel said his name, or maybe it was just the thought of flying.
"So dad's been playing Beethoven lately?" Dean smiled with fondness.
"Sam... I can't."
"Alright let's get you started then! First of all, you gotta lose the trenchcoat, man"
"Anyway... It's just a crush, right? I'll get over it soon, I always do." Dean made up his mind, standing up. He finished his coffee while Sam glanced at him disapprovingly.
"Who are you?", Dean questions, still confused.
Sam got up and headed to the kitchen, still hearing his brother say in the background, "So I'm not getting the famous Ruth roast beef today?"
"My.. father.. was a very religious man." Dean gives him a puzzled look. "Castiel was the name of an angel." He brushes it off but finds himself thinking "Well he got that one right." and blushes a little, immediately turning to the guitars again so Castiel doesn't see it. "So what do you need?" he manages to say while starting to string a bright red guitar, trying to sound casual.
Dean wakes up, cranky as usual. He gets down from his bunker, puts on some black jeans and a black t-shirt. He starts walking down the bus, saying a small hello to everyone he passes, getting his shoes and a shirt on the way out. That's how tour life is: busy, from the moment you wake up until you go back to sleep. As Dean steps out of the bus he sees some of his co-workers and friends chatting, smoking, or drinking coffee near the venue. Dean walks inside the building and finds Alejandra, the tour manager, setting up signs to where everything is. He mumbled a quick "Morning" as he thought "I need to get some coffee, fast". Fortunately for him, Alejandra had already set up the signs for the bar area and he quickly found some coffee to ease his morning moodiness. He knew this was the quiet part of the job, only having small moments of rest throughout the day. Dean walks around, familiarizing himself with tonight's venue, looking at the stage, crew members already up and ready, looks up where each area is, and starts to mentally note everything while finishing his coffee. This is the little routine he has, in a place where things change every second.
“Wait.” Dean came down the last steps and stopped equal distance between the angel and his brother who had already started for his bedroom.
A clear snick let Sam know that the lock on his old bedroom door finally disengaged. Sam got up from the bed with his clothes and boots from the day before still on. His gut ached and his bladder complained as it had been over twenty-four hours. He was furious with Castiel, and as soon as he could get the angel alone, he was going to have some strong words with him.
By that evening, Sam and Dean were at a pie festival two counties over. When they got out of the car Dean felt what little joy he was able to muster leave him. The smell of fresh pie of every kind hung in the air. For a second, Dean imagined Jack’s bright eyes and wondrous grin as he and Castiel followed him from booth to booth with Sam and Eileen trailing after. Castiel couldn’t enjoy the pie the same way Jack and Dean would, but he would have tasted each one at Dean’s urging. Eileen would have gone with Jack to stock up on the homemade jams and candies to take home.
“I will take care of Dean.” Castiel beat his otherworldly and unseen wings once and was gone.
Castiel continued, “Jack, God, before he left, set some things right and made a few changes. Since all the archangels are either dead or missing, he asked if I wanted to keep watch over heaven. I accepted and so I am now capable of, um, all kinds of things.”
Castiel watched Sam head off toward the executive bunk rooms and didn’t turn back to Dean until he heard Sam’s door shut. The lock on the door clicked loud enough to be heard in the situation room. When Castiel turned back to Dean, who stood just outside of arm’s length from the angel with a confused and worried look on his face. “I thought I would never see you again.”
Castiel tossed the funky clothing from the bed and retrieved the pillows from the floor without a word about the condition of the room. He fluffed the pillows and smoothed the sheets with the top corner on the right side of the bed pulled back. With tender motions Castiel ushered Dean to the edge of the bed and guided him to sit. The angel knelt and undid the laces on Dean’s boots and slipped them off. He stood and placed his hands on Dean’s shoulders to lay him down.
Castiel poured a steaming cup of coffee from the empty carafe behind Dean’s back while grinning at Sam. Sam’s head ticked to one side and then the other in a nearly imperceptible movement.
“I know.” Castiel gripped Sam’s upper arm with challenging hand strength.
Dean glanced over, “How much farther?”
“Yes.” Dean dreamily mumbled.
“I have to go.”
“I meant it.”
Naomi’s form sharpened from the silhouette. The glorious light pulsed and all the vampires, each a gruesome statue, crumbled to ash. The children’s ravaged bodies faded like morning fog before the sun. Dean followed the angel the best he could with his unmoving eyes and could see her approach his brother in his periphery. Sam didn’t raise his head. She considered Sam. This Sam was the same as all the others; a responsibility, a yolk, a lifeline, a hope covered in the blood of failure, pain and abandonment. The image of the dead man melted off the hook and was gone before it hit the floor. Dean screamed without making a sound.
“I need a shower.”
“No.” Sam was terse.
Castiel pulled the cereal, Raisin Bran, from the cupboard and gave it to Sam with a bowl, spoon and carton of almond milk. Sam thanked him in front of Dean and made himself a bowl. Castiel didn’t answer the thanks. He stood still and listened to something Sam and Dean couldn’t hear. He sighed, “Duty calls.”
"...Yes."
"She's not doing anything wrong."
The reception clerk had a friendly face and - even though they were about to fall asleep - got up to receive them.
As they arrived to the porch, Dean looked at the quaint home with nostalgia. It looked displaced in the neighborhood, too cozy-looking for it, with light gables and wooden frames. It was smaller than most houses in the area, a garage in front, where Sam parked.
"Okay. C'mon. Give me the phone."
"At work? They're testing the speakers, but the venue has their own sound techs." This made sense - often, the local sound techs set up certain venue equipment before the guests arrived.
After what looked like a planned dialogue, Charlie finished with an embarrassed look.
They moved on to lighter subjects and even remembered stupid funny stuff Sammy did in school that made them all laugh; Christmas together; Bobby showing up for Thanksgiving because he liked to spend time with them even though he had Jody and her family to keep him company. They were Bobby's friends, and they met them a few times when they stayed over, a long time ago.
"Can I get your address?" It was Cas.
Again, it took me so long to write this one. I'm really sorry but I hope everyone is doing well and is enjoying this little story <3
"What do you mean? I ain't doing jack shit."
He decided to get dressed instead of dwelling on thoughts like these, that would lead nowhere but false hope and maybe even despair.
Dean chose to open the small box before he had his coffee, which he actually could skip afterward because of how cute and thoughtful the gift would turn out to be.
A long waited catching up talk ensued, where Dean found Garth was having twins with his wife - still a dentist; Rowena had a pretty successful recording studio in the city; Crowley was still in his band Kings of Hell, with whom Dean started as a guitar tech, and they were going to record a new single soon; Anna had pursued acting - the only one in school, in fact - and she had been on a few tv shows; Gabriel was, well, Gabriel, so he's always on a bunch of different projects involving every kind of art - right now he was preparing an art exhibit in a local museum.
He popped over to the bathroom to clear the mess he had left behind and returned shortly, getting into bed silently and with utmost care as to not wake Cas - he was used to being quiet in the tour bus but he felt a certain fondness in this situation. Laying down beside Castiel he turned his back on his friend - "just friends, Dean." - careful not to touch him the slightest, trying not to think of the warmth emanating from Cas' body, and whispered "Night Cas." before drifting to sleep himself.
"Dean." with a soft tone, his brother hugged him without hesitation.
Brushing the thought off, he grabs his bag and his old leather jacket and leaves the bus quietly. He crosses last night's venue parking lot, getting to the next block where his Uber must be waiting. He checks the app while walking, trying to remember the car model.
"You could have helped me put the groceries away, Harry." She said while hitting him jokingly with a kitchen rag.
"Thank you. Good night." Castiel grabs Dean by the arm pleading for him to walk along.
"Not really.. You took more time than you thought in your little morning tradition. The Load-In is about to start, I want to capture some backstage stuff."
Penny simply added: "You're only allowed to watch because you're not a sexist pig."
But as the month came to an end, and even though he had talked to Charlie and Cas a few times, his heart missed the tour life. He was happy to go back to that frenzy, at last.
"But are you afraid of the plane crashing? Because you know, the rate for car accidents is actually higher."
"But you know... girls. Dancing."
"Dude, what happened here?"
"So, how you been holding up anyway? Missed me?"
He told them about a story involving a couple of beers and a group of old friends he got together for a barbecue at home.
"What's it gonna be this time? Wordplay? Truth or Dare? Game apps?" he eyes Sam, who made them all play an awful drinking game from a mobile app once.
After a moment of reflection, Charlie understands.
"Yeah... I don't know what would've happened to Sammy and me if I hadn't been caught stealing."
"I'll walk with you. Listen, I don't want those tickets. Thank you, but it's fine.", though he's struggling to keep up, he doesn't let it show.
The flight was quite stable and went by surprisingly fast. Before long, Dean found himself at the airport searching for someone carrying a sign saying "Dean Winchester". It wasn't hard to find, though, her ginger hair standing out in the crowd.
"So... you're going to see Cas after a month of being apart."
"Damn it. I can't believe this, man..." he kicks the side of the table, which hurts, and lets out a face but tries to look strong. Cas grows worried, "What is it?" "I can't believe this. I'm going home tomorrow." "Dean, I know. Look on the bright side: you'll get to see your family again, hear about your brother's stories, spend time with your parents." At this, Dean realized he talked a lot about his family with Cas, sharing fun childhood moments of him and Sam, the fun they had on Christmas when the whole family joined at their house and how they even had Bobby over sometimes, even though he hadn't told him anything about that side of things. And here he was, about to overshare again.
"And what's that?" she pointed at the card.
Charlie brushes it off, "Don't worry about it."
Michael stops in his tracks, with a stern look on his face. "Yes... You didn't know this was a World Tour or something?"
Dean knew, all too well. Sam seemed to want to avoid the subject so as to not hurt Dean's feelings, but he also seemed to be really excited about the possibility of doing the thing. Dean asked what he intended to do specifically, trying to encourage him. He had been dealing with it for years, after all.
Roughly an hour passed, Dean walking around the shops, wasting time before the boarding call when he got a text.
Dean took advantage of the small holiday to get some more sleep than he did on tour. His body didn't love the idea, though, and he was up a mere two hours later than usual. Resigned, he went downstairs to find some breakfast and found Ruth already pacing in the kitchen, busy with various small things.
“Dean?” Sam blinked rapidly until his vision cleared. It hadn’t been clear in years. The air was sweet and easy to breathe. The rattle in his chest and the ache in his bones were gone. The steady beeping of medical machines were replaced by birds chirping. He could see clearly without the fog of cataracts. Before him stood his older brother
Changing the subject, Dean grinned, “So, if you’re the boss man, then delegate. Hand it off and kick back with me all day today.”
“That looks delicious Dean.” Castiel complimented. Dean looked pleased with himself even though he hadn’t actually cooked a thing.
Consciousness came to Dean like an incoming tide on a summer beach. He roused slowly, languidly. The memory foam mattress cradled his body and Castiel’s arm cradled his head. He really didn’t want to leave the velvet bliss.
“Is this meeting going to start? I’ve got places to be.” An older gentleman with waggling jowls grumbled.
Dean’s hand fumbled for the off button on the antique brass alarm clock and he sat up stiffly from another night of hard, alcohol induced sleep.
Behind the love notes he kept a pleasure sleeve he had bought on the sly at a truck stop adult store and stored in a discrete empty cardboard ammo box. The ammo box was there, but the inside held nine-millimeter ammo, not his toy. Sam made the “fair enough” face and tossed it back in the drawer. The room contained exactly what it should contain from Dean’s memory or the best his memory could imagine. He was just going to have to wait the day out.
The highway was just two lanes with a half shoulder on each side and bordered by thick grass that went into the tree lines on each side. The pavement was level with no rumble strips at the edges and no litter anywhere. Sam strolled with his hands resting in his front jacket pockets. He made a mental note to set his alarm for tomorrow morning and try to obstruct his bedroom door’s lock so he could get out at dawn for a jog.
“Me?” Castiel followed Dean’s eyes down to his own member hard, but resting patiently against Dean’s thigh.
Dean beheaded the snitch, “Let’s go.”
Around the large, water damaged table sat a gathering of well turned out men and women whose suits were out of place among the rot. Some conversed in low voices; most sat silently as the reception in Hell was shit. At the head of the table stood a smartly dressed young secretary waiting beside an empty, sodden executive chair.
