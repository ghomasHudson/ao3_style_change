“Any news?” Natasha asked as she took a seat and picked up an out of date magazine to flick through, more to have something to do with her hands than to read.
“Smooching are we?” Tony mock growled at his Son, “And you are a little sneak, and do you know what happens to sneaks?” He asked advancing on his Son, “They get tickled!” Shrieking Zach tore off with Tony running after him, leaving Steve laughing and finishing the last few bits of unpacking before he went to join his family.
Tony looked at Steve over Deadpool’s shoulder, a pointed look on his face. Clearly he was still blaming Steve for all of Deadpool’s behaviour.
“No.” Peter said finally lifting his head and wiping his face, “You don’t have to be sorry, don’t be sorry. You’ve done nothing wrong.”
“Here I go!” Clint yelled and charged into the sea, a blow up tire held in front of him, which he belly flopped on once he was knee deep.
“I’m gonna need you to let go for a moment baby.” Tony said biting into his left wrist and drawing out a small piece of metal which he placed into Zach’s pocket. He cupped Zach’s cheek and gazed down into eyes that were so similar to his own that it was like looking into a mirror, “I love you baby.” He said to Zach, “Never forget that.”
“Now remember, both of you, if you get upset or stressed you call us immediately.” Tony said and dropped the boys off, “Don’t hesitate or try to deal with it yourselves, just call me or Steve.”
“Lame ass, we can totally work our schedules to conquer the world before we graduate with honours.” Harley called back and flinched as Grace scolded him for his language.
A late night burger and seeing Peter relaxed and smiling was what Tony needed to soothe his own anxiety. After eating in the lab with Peter and Steve, Tony headed back up to bed and stretched out, watching shamelessly as his naked super soldier came in from the shower.
“This is a soft approach.” Fury said, “If its not you two, then the WSC will assign their own team, likely headed by Rumlow.”
“Thanks for the protective stance in there.” Tony said as they got in. “I don’t think I could have fought off all of them without the suit, even if those guys aren’t Hydra they are all creepy as fuck.”
“Master Zach used your override code Sir.” Jarvis replied apologetically, “He is certainly your Son.”
“I’ll take your word for it.” Steve said lifting his cup and wrapped both hands about it as if to warm them. “I was dreaming.” He said staring down at the table, “The ice.”
“There is still no word of Tony Stark or Iron Man. CEO of Stark Industries, Pepper Potts was lifted out of the mansion by one of Tony Stark’s suits just seconds before the mansion plunged into the ocean with the billionaire still inside.” A Reporter said into the camera. She was dishevelled, her suit stained, hair falling out of the French twist it had been in, make-up streaked down her face, and the hand she held her microphone in was trembling.
Guilt still ate at Peter when he went for what had become a regular sleep over at Ned’s. He hated lying to his parents, hated lying to Ned’s parents, hated lying in general. He wanted to come clean, to admit to everything, but if he did then he knew his parents would ban him from being Spiderman until he was older and he couldn’t risk that.
“I’d have expected this behaviour from Zach, but you are supposed to be a responsible adult.” Steve scolded as he handed Tony a cup of mint tea to help settle his stomach.
“Meh, I’m the King of showing off.” Tony said, “But when it comes to you and your Brother I am over-protective.” He shrugged, “It’s what happens when you become a parent, you can’t bear the thought of your kid getting hurt.”
The natural thing to do would be to get up and go to the bathroom, but Bucky didn’t feel right about doing that, he was scared that if he moved then he would wake the others and… well he wasn’t sure he knew what would happen or even why he was scared, he just knew that he was, so he stayed in the chair, ignoring his bladder and bouncing his knees as he counted the seconds that slowly passed into minutes, watching the sleeping faces of the men before him, maybe he could sneak to the bathroom without them knowing?
“It’s called knocking.” Tony said blanking the screen as swiftly as he could and wrapping his dressing gown tighter about himself, “What can I do you for?”
“Are you sure about this?” Bruce asked the Doctor, “It couldn’t have been a natural occurring mutation?”
“Not right now.” Steve said, “I think this is something your Mamma needs to work out with Zach alone.” He rose from the counter and put an arm around Peter’s shoulders, “How about we see if we can find something on the TV to watch?”
Walking in the snow. Such a simple task for most, but to Steve it seemed daunting to face going back out into the frozen winter, but he had only to think of Zach’s tear stained face to know that he was going to do whatever it took to get past this, so that when winter came next year he’d be able to have as many snowball fights as Zach wanted without there being any issues at all.
“Uncle Clint says he doesn’t need brains.” Zach stated, “He makes up for it by being super hot and badass!”
“Then you can prove it by going to bed and quietly looking at your picture book while I clean up and your Mamma goes and takes a shower.” Steve gently said, then leaned forward to whisper conspiratorially to Zach, “There might even be a sneaky double chocolate chip cookie in it for you later.”
“It does also explain why the Sceptre was replaced after the fight.” Thor mused, “My Brother would not have relinquished it so easily.”
At first everything was a bit fuzzy, his head felt heavy, his whole body seemed floppy and uncooperative, he couldn’t speak, or was advised not to until the Doctors had finished checking his throat and making sure he could swallow water without choking and had no lasting damage from the intubation.
“There are three who stand out, Andrew Grey. He has resigned, however, his resignation may well be to avoid being prosecuted for dipping his fingers in the departments kitty upon which he was questioned after money went missing for the second time and he was the most likely suspect.”
She wished she could see his face in person, see his pain, hear him screaming physically as well as mentally, but, until their paths crossed again this would have to suffice.
“A smoking hot Mother, and a sweetie pie of a sister, he was also being bullied.” Tony said, “Now, I don’t like bullies. Nobody likes bullies, least of all Captain America, who is here with us today and with give you all his opinion on bullies.”
Killian staggered up onto his knees trying to pry Zach from his body, but the boy held on tight, was unaffected by the heat Killian was giving out and only channelled it back at him. From behind them both Natasha and Clint began to shoot at Killian with their remaining bullets, peppering his back with continued fire further weakening the man as he struggled against the enraged Zach.
“Something to do with Hydra I think.” Steve said, “He wouldn’t say much over the phone, Tony’s going to have Happy and Pepper stay with the kids while we’re there, and um you, if you don’t mind.”
“Well, I think, with what you’re planning, put together we might have chance of defeating Thanos this time.”
“Howard Stark had something in the boot of his car that night which Hydra wanted, so, one of our most useful assets was deployed to retrieve it and eliminate all witnesses.”
Peter looked thoughtful, “So, one day Aunt May and Uncle Ben could be reborn, and we could be reborn too.”
“And we’ll help you.” Happy said, “I may not have training in rehabilitation but I can learn, and I taught your sorry ass how to box.”
Steve was eager to get his hands on them, to make them pay for that they had done to Tony. Yes he was recovering, he was progressing and wasn’t letting his injury defeat him but that wasn’t the point.
That was definitely one of the best parts of the twenty-first century, the abundance of food, and so much variety too. He didn’t have to feel guilty now that he ate more than anyone else, because no one was before forced to make do with less.
“Many Nazi scientists with strategic knowledge were hired after the War, not just by America, but Russia, Britain, any of the major powers looking to advance after the War.” Tony said, “Zola, being Skull’s right hand man, would have been a snapped up.”
“How about we take the day off?” Steve said, “Just leave work alone for a day and go to Central Park, or Coney Island, or just sit around watching movies all day?” Tony frowned,
Peter was anxiously bouncing on the balls of his feet as he came into the lab, Tony was oiling Dumm-E and checking his joints but rose immediately.
His Son had to be strong, had to be iron strong or he would crumble under the weight of the pressures that would be lain upon his shoulders. He had to be smarter than the rest of the world, a genius, he had to capable of things that no other could achieve.
“This will do for now, but you’ll need to see a Doctor.” Steve said taking Tony’s arm and carefully immobilized the limb, securing the spoons with the bandage.
Even if they didn’t, Peter and Zach’s lives would never be the same again, already their schooling had been interrupted, possibly permanently, the schools might refuse to ever allow them back, the other parents might protest against their inclusion, even attack them for simply being different. People might attack them anyway for being enhanced, the anti-mutant brigade were already coming out with their banners declaring the boys unholy abominations. Monsters that should be done away with.
Steve frowned at Tony, making a show of covering Lily’s ears. “As for the X-Men, I have spoken with Professor Xavier from time to time. Helped him create a collar to dampen mutant powers for students that need to learn control slowly, and to stop those that abuse them from hurting others. The Defenders I’ve heard tell of, The Devil of Hells Kitchen is one of them I believe.”
“Tony, I don’t know what to say.” Steve said looking around the place, he could feel tears pricking in his eyes. He didn’t deserve this much kindness, Tony had no reason to show him this much generosity.
“My Friends!” Thor boomed and the entire kitchen froze upon seeing the God with pink foam curlers in his hair, pink nail polish on his nails, and wearing a bright pink velour tracksuit.
Tony was still getting the Tower back together, so he went there everyday, taking Bruce with him to introduce him to his R&D division and get his input on the labs.
“An excellent likeness.” Tony said grinning at Rhodey and narrowed his eyes at him but thanked Zach enthusiastically. “Hey, guys, did I ever tell you about mine and Rhodey Spring Break fun back in 89?”
“A schematic layout came onto the HUD and Tony looked through it, the lab spaces he wasn’t interested in, it was the bio signatures that he wanted and thankfully, since becoming enhanced Peter’s bios were unique, his body temperature was slightly higher than average and his heart rate was slightly faster due to his metabolism running at a greater rate than the average mans, or boys.
“Make that two.” Steve added, the waitress took a note on her pad and left them to get the drinks order.
“Thanks bottle-Cap! I was starting to get a head rush from hanging around like that,” Deadpool said, dusting himself off, “And not the good kind of head rush either, you know?”
Besides her Clint let out a grunt, “Who can blame him, we all nearly got nuked for Christ sakes. Who’s stupid fucking idea was that?”
Giant spiders, like the size of an dog with menacing eyes and wicked looking fangs moved about under a heat lamp.
Steve’s brow creased and he reached up to cup Tony’s face, wiping the tears away with his thumbs, “It isn’t your fault.” He said again, “Blame Stane, blame, the Ten Rings, blame Fury for not giving you Howard’s property sooner, blame Howard for not taking better care of you and being more cautious in his friends. Blame all of them, but do not blame yourself.” He smiled faintly, “I admit I would love to have a child with you, I would love to see you heavy with my baby, but if it is not to be, then it is not to be, and we are not childless, we have two beautiful sons, strong, intelligent, wonderful sons, and I love them with all my heart. As I do you.” He kissed Tony fiercely, “Even though we can’t have a baby together we will be happy and have a happy life.”
Tears were welling up in his eyes once more and his nails were sinking into his skull as he tried to shut out the sounds, sinking down to the floor with his knees up against his chest.
“Shut up, he’s not.” She snapped back continuing to buzz the intercom until na security guard appeared.
“Will you stop?” Steve snapped managing again to shut Tony up, “What Howard did to you was cruel and perverse, and just plain evil, and if I could go back in time and break both of his arms for him and wring his neck then I would.” He sighed and let go of Tony’s hand to reach up and cup his cheek, “But I can’t do that,” He said stroking his thumb over Tony’s stubbled cheek, “What can do is be here for you, and make sure you don’t destroy yourself because of what that bastard did to you.”
“Cap don’t move him, if he has spinal damage moving him will only make it worse.” Natasha warned her voice breathless and strained.
“We do.” Steve agreed, “But…well it’s complicated.” He wasn’t sure about letting Natasha know about Sam, he wanted to trust her, but he was wary of doing so and didn’t want to put Sam in danger if he could help it.
Tony could melt into this kiss, he could turn to nothing but a puddle of squirming and whining Omega on the bed sheets, could happily bear his neck for this Alpha, get down onto his hands and knees and present himself ready for knotting, oh to be mated and bred by such an Alpha, to be filled with strong, handsome Pups… But he couldn’t, he couldn’t do this,
Dizziness came next, a weird lightheaded feeling, followed by a nausea and a cold chill that spread a cold sweat over his skin.
“It is!” Peter cried, wincing since it made his chest ache, “I should have done what you said, if I had then I would never have been in oscorp and none of this would have happened.”
“I swear, every time Dr Dickwad shows up, Reed and his merry band of jackasses are off in some other dimension and we’re the ones who have to deal with whatever clusterfuck Doom has planned.”
“I don’t care, so long as all he’s doing is looking,” He lowered his voice, “But I’m the only one whose going to be doing the touching.” The low timber of his voice and the sultry lowering of his dark lashes had the unfortunate effect of going straight to Steve’s groin, which in a pair of tight cut suit pants was not very comfortable.
“What, to get pregnant before you told me, so if I got mad I’d feel guilty about it?” Steve barked at him, “And not risk upsetting you because it might endanger the pregnancy?”
“That sounds wrong?” Tony exploded at the archer, “Whats wrong is the fucking media making me out to be some kind of manipulative whore, and Steve to be some kind of brain deficient idiot.”
“Peter!” Steve barked as Tony reeled back looking like Peter had hit him. Peter’s eyes widened as he seemed to realize what he’d actually just said and immediately regretted it as he saw the hurt and guilt blossoming on Tony’s face.
“For our first dance.” Tony said, “Its one of the most romantic love songs in the world, or so Pepper and Jarvis tell me.” He leaned forward and stage whispered, “I think they are having a secret affair that they think I don’t know about. I am sure Pepper is going into Jarvis’ private server and sexting him!”
“Fiction written about fictional or even real people, it’s posted at online websites, they aren’t making any profit from it so they can’t be charge with plagiarism.” Tony explained, “There are even some fics written about me out there. I’ve been paired with Rhodey and with Pepper, they’ve even had us in threesums!” He shot a glance up at Steve, “There are even some about you, you are slashed with Bucky mostly, but sometimes with Howard which grosses me out in so many ways, a couple even have the entire Howling Commandos having an orgy!”
He could ask Steve, but the Captain had his own life to lead, and likewise, Bruce had his work, as did Happy, and while they might not mind a few days of baby sitting, they weren’t prepared to take on a growing child twenty four hours a day seven days a week.
Bruce wrapped his hands about Zach’s back afraid he would fall if he didn’t, he glanced up at Happy hoping that the man would come to his aid, but Happy was in an argument with Peter over ordering Pizza.
Despite all of this, the family had just about fit into the bed and after a goodnight story for Zach they had settled down and gone to sleep.
“As always, Sir.” A British voice said making both Thor and Steve look at the Billionaire in surprise,
“Cowards.” Tony spat at both of them, his eyes narrowing when something attacked his feet, looking down he saw a black bundle of fur that was having a whale of a time scrabbling around at his shoe laces.
“Traitor!” Tony grumbled, but did not put up a fight, he was dead on his feet, his entire body was aching, and he felt completely rung out, as if he had been put through an old fashioned mangle.
These people Peter had learned were the jealous ones. The ones who felt slighted by the fact he had been adopted by a billionaire and not just ended up in Care. Were envious over the fact that Peter didn’t have to worry about affording things and would likely never have to worry about finances for the rest of his life.
“One that is easily removed with a couple of bullets.” Natasha reminded him, “Not even you can survive a bullet to the head, Cap.”
“Clint used it to block the bots when they were throwing plums and peaches.” Natasha informed him, her face and hair were sticky from fruit juice and she had seeds stuck to her chest and sliding down between her breasts.
Tony spluttered with laughter as Steve rolled them over and pinned him down onto the mattress, parting his thighs and slapping at his butt again before sinking inside of him.
Steve’s fist met his agents face shattering his nose and front teeth, he then picked the man up and threw him across the room, body slamming him into the remaining agent who was calling for back up.
“Practice making a baby sex of course.” Tony said tugging on Steve’s jeans, “We should make sure to put a lot of practice in so that we’re perfect.”
Steve groaned, “You’ll get me shot.” He took a breath and nodded his head, “Okay if we’re going to do this, we’re going to do it carefully and slowly, increasing the weight 50lbs a time.”
“Uh huh.” Zach said nodding his head, he gave Tony a cheeky grin, “Can we has pancakes now Mamma, boobewwy pancakes?”
Steve smiled, taking off his jacket and tossing it to one side, he kicked off his trainers and gestured for Tony to scoot over enough for him to get on the bed. He stretched out besides Tony, who was staring at him in surprise, “Do you need a bedtime story?” he gently teased,
“Whats okay?” Tony asked, getting off the bed and pulling the sheet after himself so he had something wrapped around his body, “What are you talking about?”
The great sea battle of 2013 was just finished with Thor celebrating his victory having dunked Clint and Sam more times than they had dunked him. By the time they went back up onto the sand to dry off and settle in the sun for a bit, Tony finally came down from the villa.
“So I just need to wait for a life and death situation where I end up sharing a bed with her in a complete strangers house.” Peter deadpanned, and he was definitely channelling Tony with the sarcasm, little shit. Steve reached out and ruffled Peter’s hair getting batted away by the teen which made him grin.
“He didn’t even know his name.” Steve murmured, reaching out to trace the bruising on Tony’s throat, “How could he not know that at least?”
“Aye, we shall dine on Midgardian cuisine and drink deep of Asgardian ale.” Thor declared, “For I have no doubt that our battle shall be most worthy of song and dancing.”
Clint and Natasha followed their fellow Avengers and Colonel Rhodes to camp Leheigh, keeping a discreet distance so they were not discovered and watched as Tony and Steve went into the defunct base.
“Congrats man, I didn’t know you’d become a Father. But hey, if they grow that quick them you must have super sperm!”
“About the Avengers? You are probably right.” Tony said, “In fact you are definitely right, it’s only going to be so long before the next super villain shows up, best to be prepared.”
“No, Tony, why would I be pissed, when you actually gave me the greatest gift ever.” He got right into Tony’s face as he spoke, “Desperation. You know, after you agreed to meet me on the rooftop I actually believed you, continued to believe you’d show for the first twenty or so minutes. Then after that I thought about taking that step down to the lobby, the short cut, know what I mean?”
Tony smiled, “Well think about what happens when Stars die. Towards the end of their life they swell up and swallow the closest planets to them, consuming them and all their matter. Then, when they finally produce Iron in their cores they go supernova, all the matter, the atoms, everything gats scattered throughout the galaxy, some of said matter and atoms goes crashing into a nebula and kicks off the whole process of a solar system forming once again. Thus rebirth, reincarnation.”
Steve nodded, “Whatever it takes.” He said, “So I can be with you both,” He paused and looked into Tony’s eyes, “So I can earn back your trust.”
“I do not yet know,” Natasha admitted, “This Steven Rogers is different to you, very different, and hard to read. I think that at heart he is a good man, but…”
“Advice?” Rhodey rose an eyebrow, “Dating advice, surely you’ve been on a date before.” At Steve’s shame faced blush Rhodey gaped, “Holy crap. Well, uh, I assume I don’t have to explain everything…you know about how Alpha’s and Omega’s….work right?”
Shaking his head to clear it, Rogers rose to his feet and advanced on Steve, kicking him in the shins, the thighs, and the stomach.
“See, even she agrees.” Steve said, handing her over to Tony who glared at him as he took the girl, wincing when her grabby hands latched onto his beard and began tugging,
Orchestral music was playing as Rogers walked into the reception and people were dancing, or standing off to the side, watching the dancers and talking animatedly as they sipped their drinks of choice that were being mixed to order by the bar tenders.
“No!” Zach raged, he could feel a heat building up inside him, it felt like the fire inside him was going to erupt like a volcano. As he looked at his fists he saw them glowing with heat and saw the wires nearest to him spark. “Jarvis take me back to Mamma.” He said with increased determination, “Override code Delta57298Fotxtrott372Omega.”
“Smart move, Nicky.” Tony said, taking a seat and slouching like an ill mannered adolescent. Steve sat straight, feeling the need to appear smart before the director. “So, I assume you dragged us down here for a good reason, lets get to it.”
“I don’t think so, his stomach is just a little upset I think.” The nurse said as she wiping Tony’s face with tissues before pressing the call button for assistance. “How do you feel now, Mr Stark?” She asked, “Do you still feel sick?”
Snickering and choking on laughter Tony twisted his head to look at Steve, his eye bright with mirth, "We stand ready to repel all assaults." He said his voice wobbling with laughter, "We stand firm and shall be very hard to best!" he broke down into laughter which became gasps as Steve's other hand left his wrists and closed about his cock.
“Got a nice deal for yourself haven’t you, Doctor?” Tony purred, prowling the bed and looking over Curien’s trashed body. The Detective hadn’t been exaggerating, Curien looked like hell, minus an arm, his leg swollen and sporting the marks of a knee replacement and bone pinning, and then there was the stoma bag on his side that was collecting his bodies waste.
By the time Steve was ready to go Peter was waiting for him at the lift, “Do you think this will help?” He asked Steve bouncing on the balls of his feet.
“Jar…, Friday, are there any messages?” he asked, nearly calling her Jarvis again, God he missed Jarvis. He didn’t resent Vision, was proud of what the last of Jarvis had become, but he still missed his AI.
“Because it hadn’t activated.” Tony said his excitement growing and as it did his hands began to motion about as he spoke, “There was a theory some time ago, about how mutations like the serum needed a trigger to activate in the blood, massive amounts of adrenaline. When you were exposed to the vita rays it hurt like hell didn’t it?” Steve nodded, recalling that agony all to easily, “And it’s safe to say you were scared out of your mind, more than you’d ever been in your life.” Tony said, “Your adrenaline levels would have been going through the roof, just as Barnes’ would have been when he was falling. He’d have been terrified, knowing he was going to die and that it was going to hurt, that would have been enough to trigger the serum and with it’s healing factor he might just have managed to survive.”
“Then I’ve had more than enough time to rest haven’t I?” Tony said, he clapped his hands together, “Chop chop people, get everything prepared, its time to feed the masses with information.”
“I can’t believe I thought he was a few too many mince pies.” Tony chuckled as he rocked CJ who was happily sleeping against his chest, dressed in an adorable Captain America onesie.
It was Christmas day, he should have been happy and excited, the entire family (Team) were going to be at the tower, his impossibly gorgeous Super soldier boyfriend was cooking breakfast and Bruce was taking charge of dinner, piles of presents were sitting under the absurdly large and overly decorative tree in the common room, the sun was shining, the sky was a clear winter blue, everything was good.
Tony was relieved by that, he wasn’t ready for a litter, wasn’t sure he’d ever be ready, and quickly swallowed the first pill.
As he sat down at the table to have his breakfast, Peter sent a text to Ned to let him know that they were on for Friday night. He had to force his breakfast past the lump in his stomach that came from hiding things from his parents. He always felt bad about doing so.
How could this mewling wretch be perfect? He cried constantly, pissed and shit himself ten or twelve times a day, wouldn’t settle, screamed with colic. He was already showing his weakness, the weakness that Howard would eliminate from him.
Zach immediately brightened, thrilled to be asked to teach Steve something so important, “Cause I can, I’ll teached you everything!”
“We’re not getting married, Stellina.” Tony said. “We’re not together, like that. We’re just friends.”
“Great, now take a seat and you can fill up on energy for the morning.” Steve said serving up breakfast.
“He mistook you for someone else.” A lie, the asset could read lies too, he was always being lied to. No one ever told him the truth.
But the face shape, the caffeine addiction, the incredible generosity, they were all painfully familiar.
"Peter will be fine." Natasha said to him, sipping her coffee, her own sundae, a tropical fruit surprise long since eaten, as was Bruce's strawberry's and cream whip. "He'll be home soon, along with your parents."
They sat in silence for a while until Tony spoke again, “You miss Ned don’t you, your other friends too?”
“We lived so we could punish them.” Winter grunted, “We lived to make them pay, the ones who hurt us, and made us hurt others.”
Tony covered him in calamine to take the inflammation down and soothe the itch, and bulk bought a load of oats which he made up into a bath for Zach to soak in after Jarvis told him that it helped with the itching.
I had to get the Sceptre into Hydras hands somehow or there wouldn't be a Civil War rewrite as the Maximoff lunatics would never be given their powers.
“A Starfish!” Excitedly Zach jumped up and ran over to the rock pool, kneeling down to have a look, “See those shells sticking to the rocks? Those are limpets. And you see right down on the bottom, there’s the Starfish.”
The damage in the mansion was impressive, there were puddles of water, egg, flour, and torn pillows all over the ground floor, save for the library that Bruce had put off limits.
“Close enough rugrat. Anyway,” He turned back to the school kids who were looked bemused and confused by the interaction between the famous Iron Man pilot and the school nerd. “Once Mr Potato canon had decided I wasn’t a thief, or any threat to his little sister, he graciously allowed me to stay and even allowed me the use of his lab and helped me fix the suit and my AI Jarvis.
As a reward for Peter successfully going back to school since they’d sorted things out with the school board and principal, they had agreed that both MJ and Ned could stay over at the tower Friday and Saturday.
“It’s very rich food though.” Bruce said, “You don’t need much, the flavours make up for the lack of mass.”
Steve and the boys were allowed to go into Intensive care to see Tony, the others had to wait outside. There was a risk of infection so the Doctors only wanted the least number of visitors at Tony’s bedside.
“So, what has you up and about?” Tony asked getting a double chocolate cookie which he dunked into the tea smirking as Steve’s nose wrinkled at the sight of it, “Adds a minty taste.” He said, “Its good.”
Fury also put in requests for everyone else too, giving Maria quite a shopping list of supplies to keep them going for the next few days.
When the three awoke they were all in what looked to be a cellar, their wrists bound to metal frames while a few thugs looked on.
“It was a bomb with the name Stark printed on the side. But it was not mine.” Tony said, a small smug smile on his face, “I thought that it was one of the defective bombs that Stane sold under the table, or one stolen from the US military, which has happened in the past. So I chased up the leads and tracked down the serial numbers of the bombs used in Sokovia during their civil war, and guess what? The bomb was never mine to begin with. It was old, very old in fact, circa 1970 and issued to Vietnam during the war.”
“Great, I’ll use his extinguisher on Natasha’s fire.” Steve drawled, somehow picturing Clint with yellow feathers tweeting as he spoke, and the thought of Tony in a corset should not be turning him on so much, not when he had already come.
“We might.” Steve said, “If you’ll be willing to furnish us with details of everything you know about Ross, Stern, and Osborn.”
“Yes, thank you Bob.” Tony cleared his throat and sat up as straight as his back brace would allow, “As you are aware I suffered severe injuries while on an avengers mission two weeks ago. I was outside of my armour and exploring the lab that belonged to Hydra when I was shot by an enhanced individual at point blank range while my back was turned.
While this did not stop the curiosity and general interest in their bidding romance, it did help ease the frenzy somewhat and gave everyone at the tower some breathing room; which was very fortunate as a very important day arrived.
Eventually Tony’s tears dried, and he was able to sit up shakily, wiping at his face with his fingers and sniffing hard.
Shortly after defeating Thanos, Steve and Tony married in a small private ceremony, attended only by their friends and family.
“Because you ordered me to, and I quote, “Butt out of my culinary endeavours, I know what the fuck I am doing!” FRIDAY replied sounding smug,
Natasha took her phone from her belt and scowled, “I can’t get a signal, whoever sent those drones has blacked out the whole area I’ll bet.”
“Steve,” Vision corrected, “The similarities between are worlds should not be ignored. If Thanos attacked in his world, then there is every reason to think that he will do so here.”
“Alright then, Peter, you ready?” Steve called, picking up the backpack and slipped it onto one shoulder,
“You are going to recover fully.” Tony said gripping his hand and squeezing it, “You’ll need to rest but you will recover. Which is a damn sight more than Osborn will when I get my hands on him.”
Whenever they published then and now pictures Steve always thought that Tony looked better now than he had back then. He was far less tense, when he smiled his eyes lit up, there was a general looseness in his posture that had never been present when he’d still been under Stane’s control.
Besides which, Tony’s test results had come in from the Doctors and he needed to speak with Steve about them.
“These Elves were not like those depicted in your fantasy moving picture, Hawkeye.” Thor said gravely, “These were Dark Elves, beings of great malice and spite, intent only on destroying all in their path.”
“The Doctor is an alien.” Peter explained, “He’s a time lord of Galifrey, he has a machine called the Tardis which travels anywhere in time and space. He regenerates his body when he dies and becomes someone else, this is the Eleventh Doctor. Amy and Rory are human and they travel with him, he always has human companions that he meets and takes them on adventures through time and space. River Song is an enigma, she’s a time traveller and knows the Doctor from the future, they keep meeting in the wrong order. She first appeared in two episodes of season four, with the Tenth Doctor and she died saving him and a lot of other people.”
Swiftly Tony surveyed the room he was in. The only exit was too far to reach, he was running out of material he could throw in Killian’s path, not that it was helping to slow him down much anyway. He needed to get some distance between the two of them. Scowling, Tony looked up and spied a catwalk above them. Ignoring Killian he calculated the trajectory and took aim with the repulsor, blasting it at the floor which propelled him up into the air and smacked into the catwalk on his side, just between his ribs and pelvis. Scrambling madly he managed to hook his arm over the metal grate of the walk saving himself from what would have been a fifteen foot drop.
“Witness protection is an underfunded and over stretched government program, people fall through the cracks all the time, and accidents happen, gas leaks, car crashes, falls down the stairs.”
Natasha lifted her chin in defiance, “Your employers too, Captain. Remember, they are paying for your apartment, bills, and groceries.”
“I don’t think it was just the gamma radiation that has affected you, but also by the spider itself.” Bruce typed out on a tablet after the incident.
Sam had to pull him away when the EMT’s got there, Steve was then taken to the nearest hospital, where he underwent surgery for internal bleeding and had his broken bones set. Were it not for the serum he’d probably have been looking at months of being immobilized, certainly weeks being bed bound, but thanks to the serum he’d be fully healed in a week and probably wouldn’t even have a scar from his surgery.
“Petty thief, he’s not likely to be it.” Tony said dismissively. At Steve’s look he shrugged, “We won’t take it further because of the bad publicity, and taking it further will cost us money, court costs etcetera.”
“Now there are ten journalists who will be receiving this link live.” Pepper said, “It is also going to be broadcast in a few hours time. If you feel uncomfortable or want to stop you can at any moment.”
“It’s perfect boys thank you.” Tony said hugging them both and heading back to the common area where a buffet was waiting for him, with pizza and cake!
“No, Peter, we should have done better. We’re the adults, it’s out job to take care of you and we screwed up this time. We’re sorry.”
“Jay I need to narrow this down.” Tony said heading up the stairs, a couple of guards fired at him from the third floor, the bullets bouncing off harmlessly, Tony returned fire blowing up the balcony forcing the guards to run for cover or be blown to pieces.
“Stark’s really milking this, huh?” Sam said, shaking his head, “Then again, after Ultron, I suppose he needs all the good publicity he can get.”
“This is preposterous.” Steve said adding his own voice to the conversation, “How can such a man be given immunity and witness protection. He doesn’t deserve to be protected, not after what he’s done, and not just to our Son, but to those other people he experimented on.”
He had also become aware that the numbness was not wearing off, the floppiness in his arms had lessened and he was regaining coordination there, he could squeeze the Doctor’s hands, squeeze a pressure ball, hold his hands out in front of him, he was also able to answer the simple questions put to him with a yes or a no, he knew his name, date of birth, place of birth, etc.
“Is that a polite way of saying you want us piss off?” Tony drawled. “Isn’t it lovely, you raise them, give them everything they could ever possibly want and what do they do, do they appreciate it, give you any gratitude?”
Tony wasn’t having that, fuck no! he wasn’t letting Steve beat himself up for their leaving Barnes, Christ it wasn’t like they’d had a choice in the matter, the man had been waling on them they’d had to get out of there!
Coughing raggedly Tony saw the night nurse asked he helped to sit him upright, “How long have you been feeling sick?” She asked pressing the back of her hand to his forehead, “I don’t think you have a fever.”
“I mean what, what do I have to do to convince you that I am in this for the long haul?” Steve asked gesturing at Tony, “Saying I love you isn’t enough, asking you to marry me doesn’t work, building a relationship with the boys hasn’t convinced you, being at your hospital bed every day for three months doesn’t change your mind and get you to believe that I love you and won’t leave you. Just tell me, what do I have to do to get you to trust me?” It was anger in Steve’s voice, that would have been easier to deal with, it was hurt, deep hurt, just as Steve had felt when he’d found out about Tony’s fertility treatment.
Steve’s face creased with sympathy for Tony while his eyes blazed with fury over what Killian had done. He pulled Tony back into his arms, mindful of the burns and held him close.
“No!” Ebony cried in utter shock, even Glaive was given pause as they stared at the fragments of their ship which floated in the air, raining down into the street like metallic hail.
“Tony, you don’t need a miniature bowling alley, laser quest, or paint balling range.” The red head protested, batting away the holographic screens Tony had pulled up.
Tony panted and moaned, he was beyond speech, beyond anything but fulfilling his bodies desire, he writhed beneath Steve, trying to pull him in closer and hold him in deeper. Steve’s alpha was strong, wanting to utterly posses Tony but he still had enough sense to be careful and not unleash his full strength not wanting to damage the Omega, he came swiftly and paused panting, his knot only half formed and Tony still in the throes of heat, he wouldn’t come until Steve’s not had fully expanded which could take another couple of ejaculations with Tony in heat. The Alpha’s body would ejaculate more semen to further ensure a conception, and once Steve had regained his breath his cock began to harden again for the second bout.
His Mamma wasn’t crying now, so Zach got closer, stepping into the kitchen doorway and listened to what his Mamma was saying.
Steve winced, he could recall vomiting like that when he’d been sick as a kid, not able to reach the privy in time and ended up being sick on the floor. He’d felt humiliated back then, when he’d been a teenager, felt pathetic for being too weak to reach a toilet or sink before he lost his stomach. For Tony, as a grown man it must be even worse.
"And the invading force shall overwhelm you completely." Steve purred into his ear beginning to thrust again, harder and faster, "After the submission negotiations can begin, hard long hours in which the terms for such submission will be thrashed out."
Somehow Bucky found himself slowly relaxing into the warm and friendly atmosphere in the hotel room, a movie was put on the TV, an animated cartoon, Disney’s Aristocats, which had cute singing cats that made the others laugh and try to sing along with the songs with varying degrees of success as they ate their meals.
“Hey Son, I need you to help Tony okay?” Steve said gripping his forehead and rubbing at his temples as he tried to keep calm himself. “He’s having a panic attack, I need you to help him get his breathing under control.”
“No it isn’t,” Steve said, “Its about finding Tony.” He uncrossed his arms, letting them fall loosely to his sides but his fists were balled. “Where is he?”
“Don’t you do that.” He said reaching out and cupping Steve’s face with his good hand, “This was not your fault and we didn’t have a choice, he would have killed us if we had stayed, or we’d have been forced to kill him.”
“And why me and Zach aren’t allowed outside or on the internet.” Peter said, guessing that there would be a lot of posts on social media asking where Tony was and speculating if he was dead, not something he or Zach should read.
Zach beamed happily all the way through to the living room and automatically took his place on the sofa giggling as Espresso and Gingerbread jumped up to join him.
He had also learned that nothing was sacred to children, not even their parents bed, which had led to several embarrassing moments when he and Tony had been walked in on.
“Am I gonna have a little brover or sista?” Zach asked, resting his chin on Tony’s stomach while looking up at Tony with huge eyes.
How he was going to explain all this to Pepper and Rhodey, never mind the Avengers, Tony had no idea, but for tonight at least he would concentrate on getting Steve and Lily settled, then face the rest of the world tomorrow.
“No.” Tony sobbed covering his ears with his hands, not this again, why did he keep coming back to this, why couldn’t he escape this hell?
Peter chose an Iron Man theme, wanting the wall paper, bedspread, lamp shades, and curtains in Iron Man colours and images. He was also thrilled by the miniature Iron Man action figure that Tony made for him which had a very weak arc reactor powering it so it could fly about the rooms and had voice controls for Peter to tell it what to do.
“Well, at least I have you.” He said to the infant stepping into the tunnel only to lurch back as Vision appeared in front of him.
Stretching, he got off the bed, and someone groaned from beside him. Steve paused and saw a sleepy and rumpled Tony Stark coming too from where he’d fallen asleep on the bed besides Steve the night before.
Peter wore a pair of Hawaiian trunks and had a short sleeved cotton shirt on, undone but serving as a cover up for the sun when he wasn’t swimming. Zach was in a pair of Avengers themed trunks with a Captain America t-shirt and was practically jumping up and down in excitement. To stop him from running straight into the sea, Steve carried Zach on his shoulders down to the beach and made sure to keep hold of him until everyone was settled. Only then did he take Zach down into the sea.
“Yeah but he doesn’t just want to beat us, he wants to be seen doing it, the guy is a full tilt Diva.”
Rhodey fired again and Ebony Maw joined the ship leaving just a burn mark on the ground when he had been. Seconds later Tony and Steve disengaged from Glaive and he too was taken out.
“I’ll tweet out that you were scared you were going to grow four new limbs when you first got your spider powers!” Tony threatened. Peter’s eyes widened,
The thing was, Tony and Maria had not been close the way a Mother and child should be. Maria had tried her best, but she had her own problems, she’d struggled with her grief over losing so many babies before Tony, had been racked by self doubt that Howard’s neglect of her and his only Son had not helped. Anxiety and depression had set in and the Doctor’s back then, not realizing how addictive Valium was, had cheerfully prescribed Maria bottles of the damn pills, leaving her in a drugged haze, too disconnected with the world to truly be a Mother to Tony.
“Little soldiers?” Tony offered with a wry smile, “Yeah that’s not a bad idea, we should both get checked out first, make sure everything is as it should be. Although if there is anything wrong then it most likely will be with me.”
“Hopefully he won’t take after me completely.” He murmured, at Steve’s frown he shrugged as much as he could, “I wasn’t always great, Cap, I did some stupid stuff, used drugs, drank way too much, turned a blind eye to my company and it cost thousands if not millions of lives.”
The teen shifted uncomfortably and took a deep drink of his coke before clearing his throat, “Guys I’ve got something really huge to tell you.” He said avoiding looking directly at MJ and Ned. He’d gone over this in his head several times but now he was actually doing it he was freaking out, was terrified that they’d reject him, call him a freak and never want to be his friend again.
It was going to be a long process of healing and likely multiple expensive surgeries that without Osborn’s wealth, Curien had no way to pay for.
“Well, I think I can make a story for you.” Steve said, lifting Zach down from his shoulders and carried him over to the sofa to put him on his lap, “So, you want to hear how Iron Man and Captain America defeated the big bad Hydra?”
“Mamma please!” tears leaked from his eyes and more blood rose at the back of Peter’s throat, Oh God, oh, God, he was going to die here, die in his Mamma’s arms buried under a building.
Thor shot Steve a reproachful look, tugging his arm free and marched forward seizing Zach and holding him to his chest, “Open the window!” He shouted at Sam who swiftly pulled it open allowing Thor to fly out with Zach blazing in his arms.
They ate on the patio watching the sun set, a brilliant ball of fiery orange and red dipping down into the ocean.
“I wish I knew.” Tony said. “But what I can tell you is that no matter what you and Peter do Steve and I will always love you.”
“I hope so spidey.” Clint said, as he expertly handled Lily. After three kids he knew what he was doing, and had dealt with a grumpy baby more times than he cared to remember.
Scrambling from his seat Harry took his Father’s arm, “Dad, come on!” He urged, stumbling when Norman shook him away and with what was left of his pride got himself to his feet, “This isn’t over.” He spat, spinning around and dragged Harry out of the room with him.
“You are not going to get killed.” Steve said getting out of the car and heading around to the boot to get the equipment out.
Carefully, Steve began to extract his arm, tugging carefully at the limb, trying to slide it out from under Tony without disturbing the Omega, not an easy task when Tony was moved every time he pulled on his arm.
“Yeah but the cars only went at like twenty mph back then, my baby does zero to sixty in like half a second, there is no way your ancient self can handle that.” Tony teased, nudging at Steve like a pre-pubescent tormenting a friend.
“What..?” Tony glanced down at his chest and was shocked to find a hollow wound when his heart should be. The empty space sat open and gaping in his chest but oddly enough no blood was flowing from the wound and he was not struggling to live without his heart.
“Not a munchkin, you’re a hobbit.” Tony grinned at the familiar squabble and Peter managed a small smile but was still looking down at his feet, which were cased in filthy trainers. Tony really needed to get him new ones, but Peter adored his scuffed, ripped, and dirt covered ones, preferring them to getting some that were new. “It’s okay to be mad at me.” Tony said to him, “You are allowed to be mad.”
“Should we contact Fury?” Clint asked, covering his mouth with his arm and sleeve, coughing at the smoke billowing out of the wreckage.
“It is.” Steve said, having to fight past the lump in his throat to get the words out. But it wasn’t okay, he knew it wasn’t okay that it wasn’t going to be okay, Tony was paralysed and Steve had no idea how to deal with it, how Tony would deal with it when he woke up and found out.
Tony couldn’t help but wince at the mention of Sokovia, he might not have been completely responsible for Ultron, but he was partly responsible and would always carry guilt over what had happened there. However, it seemed he was the only one who did. He couldn’t say for sure what Banner was feeling since he’d disappeared, but Maximoff clearly didn’t feel any guilt for what had happened and the part she had played in it.
“Alright.” Steve squared his shoulders and headed into the workshop, spying Tony doing something unfathomable with the suits inner wiring and scolding Butterfingers for getting in the way.
“The only neighbourhood you’d be friendly in is a morgue you deranged blow up doll!” Tony shot back at Deadpool, who placed his hands over his heart as if hurt, then grinned,
“The nuke I carried through the portal you mean?” Tony ground out, his jaw tight and eyes glassy, “And I can tell you from what I saw. That Nuke succeeded in destroying one ship. Just one, and there were many more besides it.” He looked around the table, at the Avengers, “There is no reason to think that we succeeded in achieving anything but slowing them down for a while.”
Steve sighed. Apparently, this worlds Wade Wilson was very similar to how his own had been. Bracing himself for what would be an exasperating conversation, filled with sexual inuendo and inappropriate comments, Steve moved to open the window and let Deadpool inside, deciding not to ask how the maniac had gotten up there since it would no doubt be ridiculous.
“Let her in, Fri,” Tony said. Blowing a raspberry at Lily who squealed in delight, curious at the miniature human, the Bots milled around, chirping at her, and tilting their claws as they watched their Father playing with a tiny human.
Giving up he got to his feet when a sudden gush seemed explode out of him splattering his thighs, trousers, and the floor.
Steve however did not continue to stretch him, in fact he removed his finger altogether and sat back on his knees. “Steve, c’mon!” Tony whined, reaching for him, but Steve held him off,
“It does give us time to have another “Practice session” in the shower.” Steve said getting off the bed, “And like you said, we should practice as much as possible.”
Clint muttered something uncomplimentary about Tony’s parentage but was soon dropping down from the vents. “That’s a good look on you Stark.” He snickered at the foam, “But then the less I can see of you the better.”
Multiple Doctors and Psychiatrists testified on his behalf, as did Tony. Who had been paying for Bucky’s psychiatric treatment and rehab. Bucky had made excellent progress in the six months. It had not been easy but he had started coming out of his shell and slowly but surely regaining his memories and rebuilding his life and mental health.
Getting together with Steve almost a year ago had been an unexpected delight. They had been dancing around each other since the fall of Shield, but it had taken an attempted kidnapping by a parole released Justin (The dickhead) Hammer, an exchange of bullets, Steve getting a graze across the thigh, and Tony just about having a melt down in public as he screamed at Steve to never take risks with his life for him, that he wasn’t worth it, and Steve should never put himself in danger.
Tony made a face, “That is a terrifying thought, considering the fact he’s had children!” he sighed, “His wife’s asked me to find him something to do to get him out from under her feet all day.”
“No, and yes that’s pretty much definite.” Steve replied, he ran a hand through his hair and looked back to Peter. “I wish he’d wake up. But when he does, I’m not sure I know what to say to him.”
Tony gave Clint a shark like smile, “Feel free to drop dead of Ebola, Barton!” Trying not to eye Steve up as they went to the lift, he turned and called over his shoulder, “Don’t mess up my tower!”
Tony snuffled a snort at the image of Steve twirling some grey hair geriatric around a dance hall and having to rush them to hospital because they’d hurt themselves.
Of course Curien could never be allowed to talk to the police, he might be able to implicate Osborn, and even if he didn’t have evidence to support it, Norman didn’t want to risk anymore suspicion. As it was this would cause his company to loose even more stock points, he was dangerously close to financial ruin, if he couldn’t turn things around soon then he’d be forced to put his company into liquidation.
“And after you save me from my wicked Robot Step-Mother/Witch, you will carry me away in your arms, Sir Steve.” Tony said.
He would be stuck there then, trapped in his powerless suit, watching with eyes that he couldn’t close as the Chitauri who’d survived the Nuke swarmed towards him, weapons ready to rip him apart, if he would lucky the lack of air would kill him before they did, but he was never that lucky, it never ended until he was in their grasp, his last piece of protection from the vacuum being ripped off him, exposing his damaged body to space.
Natasha smirked at him, “You’ve revealed plenty already. Hydra took Stark, they’ve likely been planning to try and take him prisoner for some time because he is a genius that they could use, but unlike the Ten Rings, they are not entirely stupid. They know that if Tony Stark disappears then the world will tear itself apart looking for him. They need someone, something to take his place, hence you.” She gestured to the Skrull, “How am I doing so far?”
Thinking about Steve put a smile on Tony’s face and he resolutely ignored his aching back and unsettled stomach, making his way down to the kitchen for breakfast.
Tony beckoned the boy further into the garage and the torch the boy was carrying revealed the armour. “OHMYGOD!”
As he welded the helmet Tony called Happy on his mobile ordering him to keep the kids away from the Tower and if possible to get out of New York altogether.”
“I tried to stop it.” Peter offered, “But he charmed Steve with his big eyes and pouting, you know they are evil and no one can resist.”
“You are not, finish stuffing your face and then get your butt into your room and put on your school pants and shoes.” Tony ordered him, “And you,” He pointed at Peter who froze, a deer in the headlights look coming over his face, “Wow!” Tony said, “You haven’t done anything and you look guilty.” His eyes narrowed, “Why do you look guilty, what have you done?”
“Thank God for small mercies, because you sure as hell ain’t mine!” Matt shot back at him, “And don’t call me Door Matt.”
Tony sighed and took Pepper’s wrist, leading her to a corner so they could speak privately, “I’m not pregnant.” He said, “But I am trying to be.”
They had carried her bags up the stairs for her, and changed some light bulbs for her, and when there had been a power cut, had gone round to make sure she was alright.
Tony delivered the placenta at the hospital and was checked over as was the baby, whom he and Steve decided to name Christian James, both of whom were fine. CJ as they nicknamed him was found to be full term and a little small for a Pup but would quickly make the weight up and had no other difficulties.
The screaming would start then, Tony would scream and scream until everything went black and for a time he would know nothing until it all started up again, replaying with torturous monotony until….
“Stark Man, stop this!” Sam cried, unlike Rogers, Maximoff, and Romanoff, he was the only one not suited up, reluctant to join the fight after hearing what Tony had said, what Rogers and Romanoff had admitted to.
Normally if such a thing happened Peter would have rushed to MJ and hustled her away to make sure she was alright. But with his nerves wearing thin after having to keep extra control of his sense all day and Flash’s comments about Ned riling him up, along with the comments about himself, Peter just snapped and without even really consciously thinking about it he had leaped off the bench and tackled Harry to the ground.
“I don’t care.” Steve said firmly, “I don’t care about sex, I can live without it. So long as I can hold you, kiss you, talk to you, and be with you, then nothing else matters.”
“Little Prince Stark, I believe you have increased in size since last we met, I would swear you are twice the boy I recall, soon you shall be taller than I!”
“I’m thinking that you will die after eating all that.” Sam said looking faintly disgusted at the mountain of food.
“I’ll be back soon.” Steve said, giving Tony a peck on his cheek and hurriedly headed out of the lab to see to Lily.
“Well that’s settled then.” The Principal said happily, he extended his hand which Tony shook as did Steve.
Tony felt a rush of love for Steve’s understanding and support, it bolstered his confidence and helped him take more and more steps, getting deeper and deeper into the lake, until he was up to his waist.
Tony blushed at the compliment and ducked his head while a smile curved his lips. He cleared his throat trying to ease the tension, “I’ll bet the fanfic writers will be going batshit insane over this. A new and hot Q, the perfect slash partner for Bond.”
“Calm down.” Steve said, putting an arm about Tony and drawing him into his arms so he could hold him and kiss his head. “This has nothing to do with your ego and everything to do with Hydra. Don’t let them, let Killian get the satisfaction of upsetting you.”
But humans were stupid, they thought that it could be achieved bloodlessly, as if anything in human history had ever been bloodless. Of course there had to be sacrifices made, people like that Stark boy were going to be the casualties who would help pave the way for the future. Honestly, were a few dozen or a few hundred lives lost really too much to ask when their loss could lead to the save of billions of lives?
Howard scoffed, sneering at his wife, but his eyes held a trace of fear at being charged for harming his infant Son.
The thought of the Alpha daring to hurt Tony made Steve’s Alpha instincts boil inside him, only the most despicable of Alphas could harm their Omegas, he knew that the marriage had been arranged by Howard but that didn’t mean that Stane had a right to hurt Tony as he had.
Steve was trying to appear collected but even he was showing strain, it would be the first time the Avengers had attended a public setting like this, one that was going to covered by the media and would be scrutinized by everyone who saw the coverage, they were also going to be mingling with high society, something that only Tony had real experience with. Steve had some but that was seventy years ago, and Natasha had only ever been on the fringes when she was working as a honeytrap or a double agent trying to smoke out a villain.
“Now wait just a minute,” Rogers said, rising to his feet, his chin jutting forward, an air of self-righteous authority about him. “You do not have the right, to come here and start telling us how to act. This is not your home, you have no business even being here..”
“Just for the record, you do know there will be no sex while we’re here, right?” he said to Steve as the super soldier took the keys from the ignition.
“Jarvis, find me someone to sue, hell! Call the lawyers, I want to sue everyone; the tabloids, the paps, the fucker who took the photos, all the wankers on twitter and facebook, fuck I want to sue the makers of social fucking media!”
Rumlow rolled his eyes, “For the last time, he whispered into my ear, “Hail Hydra” That was why I gave him the Sceptre, he knew who we are, he has to. I thought he was one of us.”
“Can’t!” Tony rasped, there was the sound of metal clanging and stumbling and Tony fell to the ground his breathing getting worse.
Steve sighed and nodded, “Do you think taking Peter for a run would help him, maybe clear his head?”
“Ice cream?” Tony pretended to be shocked, “You want ice cream as well as pancakes? I don’t know about that, we’ll have to have a very serious discussion before I can agree to that.”
Tony flushed and looked down at Lily trying to hide his embarrassment, “Well I.. guess that’s what we are, isn’t it?”
Zach wasn't fooled by how Bruce and Natasha tried to play down how serious Peter's condition was. He was too intelligent for that, they tried to make it seem that Peter was just a little sick and it was nothing to worry about. But Zach knew better, he knew that unless it was very serious, his Mamma or his Daddy would have come to collect him from school while the other remained at the hospital.
“Do you want to be worrying about flower arrangements, ordering food, drink, the cake, bands, photographers, table arrangements, and a dozen other things, or just hire someone to worry about it for us?”
Zach shook his head, “Not going.” He said finally lifting his head from Steve’s chest. He had been clinging to Steve like a limpet, not making any attempt to leave him, but he had been staring at Tony the whole time and now he had seen him he didn’t want to leave him any time soon.
“No, you don’t understand,” Tony sighed, worrying at his bottom lip with his front teeth, “I fucked up, I really fucked up. Ultron was my doing, they are right not to trust me.”
“Hey you don’t have to say anything.” Tony said, “Although I never get tired of hearing how brilliant, sexy, and amazing I am!”
On and on they dig with more bodies coming out, these terrifying as they had at one time been human but were now mutilated and changed into something else, parts from other creatures had been grafted onto them or they had been subjected to experiments that had changed their physiology resulting in horrifying alterations and mutations.
Thankfully he’d been able to hide this from Steve, even the ten pounds he’d gained, most of which was water from the amount he was retaining and he was making the effort to bite his tongue so that Steve wouldn’t suffer from his mood swings.
Steve deliberately kept the pace moderate, while he and Peter could manage a fast pace with ease Tony and Zach couldn’t, Tony wasn’t enhance and Zach’s legs were much shorter than everyone else’s.
Bruce had thoughtfully brought moist hand wipes down to the beach with them so everyone could clean their hands before they ate.
Steve felt like a knife had been thrust into his heart at Tony’s broken admittance. Was that what he thought, that Steve hated him? When had that happened? Why did he think that?
The Gardens too were in good condition, Tony had employed a gardener since he’d moved back to New York to maintain the grounds. They and the building itself would be perfect for photographs and for a reception, the manor could certainly hold a great number of people as well as wait staff without it being crowded.
Lila had brought a new colouring book and pencils and sat with Steve to draw, while Clint helped Cooper set up scale-electrics, which of course got Tony and Peter’s interest and soon they were racing Car’s about the tracks at high speed, and Nate took to Thor, who bounced the toddler on his knee and made growling and roaring noises that had the little boy shrieking in delight.
“You came here very severely wounded, Mr Stark. You shouldn’t have lived, your aorta was ruptured and you should have bled out, you also responded very swiftly to treatment, far swifter than you should have given how gravely ill you were.” He explained, “We decided to run a blood panel on you to see what was going on and we found that your white cell count was far greater than normal yet you had no prior injury or illness to have caused this. So we have looked further into your blood work and found similarities to the blood work of Captain Rogers.”
After that it was just a matter of dealing with Thanos’ forces on earth, which the united teams were handling and within a day it was all over.
After relieving himself, he pulled on his boxer shorts and made his way to the kitchen, coughing a little as he was greeted by a cloud of smoke.
One or two of the board members looked like they agreed with Norman while the other’s look disgusted at Norman saying such a thing, Steve’s reaction was similar.
For second or two there was nothing, and then there was the most magical sound Tony had ever heard in his life.
Tony set about making the kid a decent suit to wear so he would actually have some protection on his body rather than the spandex crap he was currently wearing, he was going to make sure that the suit was flexible as well as durable so it wouldn’t hinder Peter’s abilities or weigh him down, while still providing him with protection from injury.
“Sorry.” Steve said uselessly, there was nothing he could do, even with Super strength he couldn’t shift the weight from his back, he couldn’t move an inch.
“Do you have anything?” Steve asked, sitting up for a moment, giving Tony a good look at his washboard abs and firm pectorals. He couldn’t help but to feel a little intimidated by Steve’s perfect physique. While he was not over-weight, Tony was well aware that he was not as fit as he used to be, nor did he have a six pack. When he was eating properly his abdomen tended to have a slight roundness to it these days, thanks to his metabolism slowing with the onset of middle age.
“Clearly the boy is a danger.” Norman stressed, “Look at my Son, look what this delinquent did to him!” He gestured to Harry’s bruised and swollen face.
“No there isn’t” Rogers said, dismissively, “We destroyed the Chitauri, Thanos will not come here, he was probably killed on the mothership the nuke destroyed,”
The school, (Clearly hoping to avoid being sued) offered their deepest apologies to Tony and Steve, wishing Peter a speedy recovery. They also organized a card to be signed by all the students which was sent in to the hospital along with balloons.
"Oh yes, long hours of cunning linguistics and master debates are made." Tony gave up composure completely, giving into his giggles,
With clothing they also went slow, Peter wore nothing but pure cotton at first, only adding different materials as he grew more comfortable with them.
“Holy fuck!” Tony gripped Steve’s shoulders tightly and shamelessly moaned as lightning bolts of pleasure ran through him. “Fuck me that’s fucking perfect, I can fucking feel that, I can feel all of that!”
Peter tripped over a gap in the pavement and stumbled, coming to a stop and panted, resting his hands on his knees, “Seriously?” He asked when he’d gotten his breath back.
Steve couldn’t agree more, although part of him hoped that Natasha caught up with him first, the bastard would suffer more at her hands than the police.
“And Peter paid a heavy price for it, with what Doctor Curien did to him.” The host said shuddering.
Steve was laughing between pants for air, "But if you surrender then negotiations may begin and mercy may be shown."
“So far as we know.” Bruce said, “He and Steve are laying low right now. Your Mamma’s car was found abandoned at the road side, damaged. His and Steve’s disappearance has caused a stir with the media, hence the reporters outside.”
“Go ahead,” Steve said passing Tony the sweat pants and rising up, politely averting his gaze while Tony changed out of his dress pants. Steve took them from him, putting them to one side and gestured for Tony to get into bed.
“Tony, why didn’t you tell me sooner, why have you been keeping this secret?” She asked, “Fertility treatment is a bitch, the side effects are horrible.”
“Uh huh, I should think you are sorry.” Tony said, bringing Toby a couple of new slices of bread, “Now, just make these slightly brown, not blackened, not smoking, just browned, okay?”
“Cap’s got a super fast metabolism.” Tony explained with a grin, “He needs to eat every few hours, and the lucky bastard never gains and ounce.”
“Well hire him then,” Steve said, “We can always offer him team membership, it’d only activate on the if and when, not a daily basis, so he’d only come out of retirement if the world was in peril.”
“Oh yeah, I’m getting a wonderful load of cocktails fed to me right now.” Tony chuckled lifting his arm that had the IV in it.
Steve rolled his eyes, “Jarvis, what are Rhodey and the boys doing?” he asked, wondering if making a retreat now might be the best idea.
Tony was in no better shape, his left arm was broken, like Steve he had a bloody nose and lips, his throat was badly bruised and swollen from where Bucky had been strangling him. His left side was bleeding too, some shards of metal had pierced his skin when the suit had caved inwards.
“We can try IVF, doner eggs, maybe find a surrogate.” Tony said glumly, he had already said once that he didn’t want to go through the brutality of IVF treatment, but now that was looking like it was his only option.
“Yes, and that’s what we need to talk about,” Rogers said, “You and your obsession with this imagined threat coming from space. You reaching out to other enhanced people, putting together some kind of army, don’t you see how dangerous that is?”
Tony gave an almost hysterical sounding laugh, “Where the fuck do I even start?” He said, “With the psycho who turned himself into a fucking AI? My Parents assassination, Hydra being alive and kicking, and let’s not forget Cap’s bestie, being shoved in the freezer and used as a Murder doll.”
“The police are investigating now.” Steve went on, “Clint thought the explosion was a self destruct.”
Steve took a shaky breath and watery eyes met Tony’s, looking painfully young and innocent, “I should have done better.” He whispered, “Tried harder,” His eyes flitted to Tony’s throat, “He could have killed you.”
“And it’ll leave a hell of a mess on the side walk.” Spider Man called, holding Lily with one arm while dangling spider silk over her head which he waved back and forth as she made grabby hands for it.
“After I’ve dropped the munchkins off at school.” Tony replied, “Give or take on traffic I can be back here for 9.30 am?”
Making their apologies to Clint and Pepper, MJ and Ned filed to the lift with their parents their heads hung low.
“Hopefully you’ll be out here soon.” Steve said patting Peter’s good leg, although the other was nearly healed, the fractured bone was almost completely knitted back together and the gunshot had already scarred over and was starting to fade.
“And we need more information.” Tony said, “We need to keep those hellicarriers from ever becoming airborn and we need to expose Hydra.”
The Skrull smiled and morphed into Tony, “Natashalie.” It greeted using Tony’s voice, even the posture was correct, the smirk, the sparkle in dark brown eyes, had they not known that it was an imposter then they would have thought they were talking to Tony Stark.
The Captain yelped and flushed while everyone laughed, after that Tony tried to pick things up with the grabber with varying degrees of success depending on what they were, he also got into a claw/grabber wrestling match with each of the bots beating them all into submission.
Zach ran through the darkened room and scrambled up onto one crate then pulled himself up on top of another, standing up he looked over the darkened hall seeing multiple crates lined up and huge storage bins. The door rattled behind him and Zach hurriedly ducked down, climbing back down onto the small crate and wedged himself into the shadows so he wouldn’t be spotted as the lights were flicked on.
Steve was now pretty sure that his bottom jaw was on his shoes. Pepper patted his back, “Don’t worry.” She said encouragingly, “You do get used to his eccentricities after about a decade of being around him.”
Tony brightened at the thought, which made Steve snort in amusement, “Where have you been anyway, Jarvis said something about a defunct facility?”
“You’re not guilty Tony, I already told you that,” Steve said, “Wanda admitted that she invaded your mind in Sokovia, that she showed you your worst fears and goaded you into making Ultron with the sceptre.
As it was he was being crucified by the media, along with Wanda for her past affiliation with Hydra.
“You know, I think I grieved more for Ana, and the human Jarvis, than I did for my parents.” Tony admitted to the AI. “I couldn’t have cared less about Howard. That bastard deserved all he got. But my Mother, I should have cared more about her, I should still care more about her than I do.”
“But we also need to protect Shield.” Natasha said, “Not all of Shield or the WSC are Hydra, the families of the innocent must be protected, their details cannot become public, nor the identities of those undercover.”
“There are too many civilians around.” Natasha noted keeping herself turned to the side and observing the agents out the corner of her eyes, “We can’t risk this becoming a gun battle.”
While the Doctor kept babbling Tony pinched at his sides with his fingers and thumb, he could feel beneath his ribs, he could feel his waist, he could feel something around his belly button, then things became dull, it was like he was feeling something through a thick layer of clothing from his belly button to just above his groin, then nothing.
Tony eyed him uncertainly for several moments but was then distracted by Zach giving Steve the chance to escape from his scrutiny. It wasn’t that he wanted to hide anything from Tony, he really didn’t. He was happy to be sharing everything with the Omega, emotionally and physically.
“Because I would rather have a quick painless death than one that is lingering and agonising.” Curien shot back, “And that’s what Osborn and his boss’s would offer.”
Once the presents were open, Bruce disappeared into the kitchen with May and Laura to cook the dinner, while Natasha curled up on the couch with Pepper to talk, leaving Rhodey and Sam to discuss past missions from the air-force.
“I hate you Mamma.” Zach said filling his palms with flames and threw them at Tony who’s body instantly ignited…..
Tony paused considering it. It was a huge secret to ask a boy of Peter’s age to carry, Ned and MJ were trustworthy, especially Ned whom Peter had known for years, really it wouldn’t be fair to expect him to hide this from them, they could help him as he learned to adapt, would help him grounded so he didn’t lose himself in this new identity.
"Where's the fire?" He laughed good naturedly, only for his humour to dry when he saw Tony's ashen face, "What's happened?"
“I do, Friday is extrapolating it as we speak.” Jarvis replied, “It may take some time as she is still learning to integrate with all the systems and it would be best to allow her several hours in order for her to fully grasp everything and not miss any data.”
“No details.” He repeated and looked up at Steve, “What the hell am I supposed to say to him? That his Father was a murderous bastard, that he tried to kill me three times and would have succeeded if I hadn’t killed him first?”
“My God you are actually rationalizing this and I think I am developing Stockholm syndrome as this is actually making sense to me. So, I am going to go to my lab and hang myself!” Tony said.
“Fine,” Pepper said, then she grinned, “No gimme all the details of your relationship thus far, I want to know everything!”
When Howard had been running the company it had always been a rather formal event. Howard had been a snob, had wanted to be thought of as society and loved every chance he got to dress up in black tie and rub elbows with the rich and entitled.
Pietro grinned at her kissed her cheek, “Hold that thought.” He suddenly sped off far too fast for anyone to see, Wanda smiled and continued walking, meeting up with Pietro at the end of the road where he was holding several wallets and purses having picked peoples pockets too fast for them to notice.
Wolverine had died next, then Rhodey with the air force, T’Challa fell soon after, as Wakanda was overwhelmed. Black Widow and Hawkeye had taken after that, and Hulk had died trying to avenge his friend.
Tony nodded, “Okay. That sounds good.” He said. He got up from the couch and noticed for the first time that he’d been sitting on Steve’s lap! “Umm… That is… I…” He was rescued from his brain freeze by FRIDAY being an angel and alerting Steve to the fact that Lily was awake and in need of a nappy change.
“I think Sharon hasn’t really dealt with her aunt’s illness. She was very close to her at one time.”
On the second day into Tony’s coma Friday had downloaded and extracted the information that had been collected from Strucker’s base and Jarvis displayed it for the Avengers in the quinjet, temporarily leaving his bedside vigil of Tony and having a Legionnaire take his place at standing guard over the slumbering genius.
Killian chuckled, “Would you like to see?” he tossed three holograph nodes across the floor, “You know, since Bern I’ve been desperately wanting to bestow on you the same desperation you gave to me, I just couldn’t figure how to do it.”
He spoke to the boys every morning New York Time, while they had their breakfast, and every night before they went to bed.
“Mamma,” Peter croaked, “Mamma wake up.” More blood filled his mouth and he spat it out, “Mamma please wake up!” He pleaded, he tried to move, tried to get his limbs to work but he felt so weak and the armour and debris were too heavy.
“No.” Ross said, “What I am saying is, Pride comes before a fall. An old adage but a true one. Tony Stark is a very prideful man an arrogant man, and look at what has happened.”
“Zach, baby I know, and I wish you could,” Tony said wrapping his arms about Zach’s body, “But you have to go to school, you’ve missed too much as it is, and I can’t leave here yet, I have to stay for a few more weeks.”
“It isn’t real, it isn’t real, it isn’t real.” Tony was chanting the same thing over and over again as if they were a mantra.
His car had been found and he and Steve had been declared as missing, Pepper and SI had not made any comments to the press, but they were congregated outside the Tower, Bruce and Happy were going to keep both boys indoors and away from the news channels so they wouldn’t get upset.
Rogers stood for several moments, watching as Tony, Vision, Rhodey, and Steve faded into the distance. His nose was healing now, the blood drying on his face and tasting horrible from where it had dripped into his mouth.
His Brooklyn apartment could have fit inside the floor Tony was giving him four times over and still had room to spare.
Steve sighed and began to pull away, he knew that there was no point in arguing with Tony when he was in this mood. He also doubted that after the day they'd had that Tony would be feeling overly amorous. However, as he pulled away Tony reached out and stopped him.
Steve guided Tony back into the penthouse, taking him to the kitchen and switching on the kettle, he rummaged through the pretty much bare cupboards until he found some hot chocolate mix and then set about making them both hot chocolate.
“Steve then. So Steve, it’s been quite an adjustment for you over the past two or so years, not so long ago you were engaged in the greatest war this world has ever and hopefully will ever see. You were fighting against the Nazi regime, trying to protect the freedoms and liberties that really, did not fully come into play until after you had gone into the ice. Can you tell us what it is like to suddenly wake up in such a very different world to the one you remember?”
“Tony’s gone on ahead,” Steve explained, bracing himself as Clint took off, “He’s going to kill anyone who gets in his way.”
“Romanoff and Rogers.” Tony snarled, as the assembly bots placed the suit onto him, “They knew about this, and now they’re going to pay.” Before anyone could stop him he was blasting off the landing pad, heading for the compound.
He managed to keep from shedding tears by sheer will alone. Just thinking about Tony was heart breaking, he still saw him as clearly as if he were right by his sider even now. Could remember every detail, how his eyes crinkled and creased when he smiled brightly, the wicked cackle of his laugh. How his hair curled in the nap of his neck if he didn’t cut it, how it would flop over his forehead and caress his brow. How his eyes would darken, and his pupils expand when he was aroused.
“Well you shouldn’t go alone.” Rhodey said, getting back to his feet, thankful he hadn’t yet taken the war machine armour off. “I’ll go with you in case there is trouble.”
The he was being lifted, being made to sit up and face Sam as the other man spoke to him in clear but gentle tones. “Just focus on me Man, just focus on my voice and do what I am telling you. Now I want you to breathe, slowly inhale through your nose and hold it, one, two, three, now exhale counting backwards from ten as you do it. Now again through the nose, hold it, one, two, three, and exhale through the mouth counting backwards again.”
She’d blurted out that she had invaded Tony’s mind in Strucker’s base in Sokovia, as she sat at the kitchen counter with Steve, sipping at hot chocolate and munching on cookies.
“Can I have another one?” Zach asked, he wasn’t allowed to do his own marshmallow, enhanced he might be but Tony wasn’t comfortable letting Zach get so close to naked flames, so he was being assisted in toasting his marshmallows.
Tony whimpered, how was he supposed to get through a day with Steve wearing that and not jump him the first chance he got?
Sadly for Tony before his heat came he had an engagement he had to go to, or rather all the Avengers had to go to.
When morning came Steve awoke first, which wasn’t unusual since he required much less sleep than Tony. However, what was different was that he was wrapped right around the Omega, their legs tangled and Tony’s head was tucked under Steve’s chin, he was laying on Steve’s left arm and Steve’s right arm was wrapped about his waist hugging him close.
Sam shrugged, “Gone. They bolted soon after you left. Natasha knew that the cops would arrest her and Cap for hiding the Stark’s murder, she convinced him that they had to run, Wanda went with them.”
“Aye, we well discuss all after we have vanquished our foes!” Thor declared jumping back into the fray.
Cautiously he approached the sceptre, unaware of Wanda watching from the shadows or the magic that burned in her hands. With flash of crimson Wanda’s magic invaded Tony’s mind and took him into his nightmares.
“So you actually think so little of me that you assume I’d go elsewhere?” He spat, his pride stung, “Just because you’re not in your twenties, just because you can’t immediately fall pregnant, you really think I am so shallow, so callous that I would cheat on you with a younger model?”
The thing was, he was already insecure about Steve, or rather of his ability to keep Steve’s love. He was brutally aware that he was much older than the super soldier, was rapidly heading into Middle-Age, his body was scarred and battered after Afghanistan, Vanko, the Mandarin, the Avengers. The fact he couldn’t even give Steve a child just made all of his body issues feel so much worse.
After two years of dating Steve proposed to Tony and the Billionaire accepted. They were still planning their wedding when Bruce returned to Earth with news of Thanos, via Stephen Strange, Sorcerer Supreme.
Pepper’s expression went from anger on Steve’s behalf, to disappointment, to concern in a few seconds, “Tony, you can’t go through this alone. This is huge, you need support.”
“Alright, I’ll get a wheelchair and portable oxygen.” He said in defeat, “Make sure he stays put.” He said to Natasha as he went past her.
He was learning to distinguish scents from people, MJ always smelled of vanilla from her perfume, and a sweet scent that was unique just to her. He couldn’t really describe the scent beyond sweet, it wasn’t like honey or chocolate or cake, it just smelled sweet.
Tears burned in Tony’s eyes as he looked up at Steve, “But you want a baby.” He whispered his voice hoarse, “You deserve to have a baby of your own.”
“Jarvis is still rebooting.” Tony said, “I trust you to keep an eye on that for me and I’ve done all the patch up I can for the suit, it’ll be ready to go when J is back online, now get your skinny little ass home and stay near the phone, because when I call, and I will call, you need to be ready to jump, got it?”
The Asset would have to think about this, but first he needed to be fixed. Get his arm fixed and get his mission accomplished, then he might have time to think.
He lay the infant down onto the bench stripping off the baby grow he was placed in, revealing his chubby body and securely bound nappy that for once was clean.
“Right.” Steve’s reply was mechanical, he was barely functioning, was just holding himself together by sheer stubbornness, that was all that was keeping the shock at bay. He’d just seen his best friend, be attacked by him, and the man hadn’t even known who he was himself let alone who Steve was.
“Thanos,” Steve said, “The mad Titan. He was hell bent on destroying our world, along with half the universe, and he had an army, the Chitauri, and many allies capable of doing it.”
“But just as fair warning.” Peter added, “If you hurt him, then my Aunt Pepper has killer shoes and I’ll stab you to death with them and then dissolve your body in the bath tub with acid, and I aced my chemistry so I know the exact formula to use to turn your body to nothing!” With a bright smile Peter patted Steve’s arm and trotted off to join his Mother and Brother leaving Steve with a bleeding lip and a stunned expression on his face.
“I don’t have any glad rags,” Steve said, so far the only clothes Tony had bought him were casual, with three modern suits for press conferences and such, but no tuxedos or anything.
“Feels pretty good.” Tony said linking his arms about Steve’s neck, he braced his forearms on Steve’s shoulders and lifted himself up and down eliciting a groan from Steve, “Sounds like its pretty good for you too.”
This of course had Tony making several lewd comments about Steve checking his ass on a regular basis which had the Captain flushing and the Doctor rolling his eyes.
“Lets shower and go out for something to eat.” Tony suggested, relishing the soreness he felt, his body ached in the best way, he felt like he’d run a marathon, was throbbing but exhilarated and euphoric, he’d never felt like that with Stane, he’d always felt empty and used after his heats, with Steve he felt cherished, desired, and secure.
“We need to debrief.” Natasha said when Tony and Bruce joined the others back up in the Penthouse. “We should head back to Shield.”
By the time they were all done it was dawn and Tony had to be heading back to the Mansion before his Sons woke up.
“Please stop encouraging his mouth.” Tony pleaded, he swiftly held a hand up to Wade, “Not one word about mouth sex.”
