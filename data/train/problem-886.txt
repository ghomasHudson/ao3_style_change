"Oh is that his name."
"Sort of the point."
"Sherlock Holmes, surprised...that's a first. What you couldn't deduct what she was going to do?"
I told him about growing up, about wanting to be normal, about observing people and their stupid insidious behaviors. Another smile and nod. I had begun to suspect that he really didn't fuck his patients and yet for some reason I continued my verbal vomiting. It was horrible. So sentimental. I was appalled at my behavior. This was unacceptable. Finally I pulled myself together and told him to FUCK OFF. I was done being his afternoon entertainment. He smiled, nodded and left.
“Afghanistan on Iraq?” I repeated.
"That's a pity," I said to him.
John was confused or was it aroused. At this point he really had no fucking clue.  All he knew was that he was in an abandoned warehouse at 3 fucking oclock in the morning with his barmy best friend. His barmy best friend who at this moment was trying to figure out how to get them out of the abandoned warehouse. So it was a normal Tuesday night or was it Wednesday morning for the good Dr. Never mind that he really should be in bed next to his lovely wife. Never mind that he had to go to the clinic in about 5 hours. Nope it was all good. John H Watson was all good. He was sitting on a pile of boxes in a damp warehouse in the middle of nowhere in the middle of the night and it was all good. Well it was all good until a certain consulting detective decided to remove his beloved coat. And then it all went to hell in a hand basket.
Consulting Detective Sherlock Holmes and his partner Dr. John Watson were seen out and about in a London park yesterday. The pair who are rarely seen being affectionate in public  were spotted having a heated discussion. It is rumored that Dr. Watson  is secretly seeing another Alpha and that he is the father of the Omega’s unborn pup.. According to an anonymous source Dr. Watson and the other Alpha are using Mr. Holmes for financial gains and that the consulting detective needs the illusion of a bondmate in order to further his career as a consultant for the Metropolitan Police.
"Might have?????"
"You're not gay" squeaked Sherlock. This time it was definitely a squeak.
"Always something"Sherlock relaxed into John and began to card his fingers through the good doctors hair.
Sherlock had been working a case for the past week and had finally solved it. He had stumbled home to a crying Will and an exhausted John."Go John. I am here. He will be fine."
"Afghanistan." John replied standing straight up," Captain John Watson, formerly of the 5th Northumberland Fusiliers."
“Oh Lolamae you know I will always be the one doing the sucking.”
"Bi-sexual"
John had finally got them settled into the seats without too many death threats being uttered at his large cranky companion. The plastic was safely stored between their seats. The light dimmed and the play began. ‘Showtime’ giggled John to himself. Martin Freeman walked out on stage and beside him John heard a quick intake of breath. 'Gotcha', thought John. He watched the detective's eyes go from a cerulean blue to almost black with arousal. John should feel jealous of his partner's response to the actor on the stage. Normally he would except in this case it was like the good doctor was looking into a mirror, albeit a bearded one. Sherlock had hated his mustache but it appears he might not be so adverse to a beard.
“John! What is it? Is something wrong with the baby,” panted a very out of breath consulting detective as he sprinted into the room, coming to a very sudden stop when he encountered his angry and very naked pregnant mate to be.
I hadn't practiced much in the past years but it is amazing what rage and a hand full of steak knives can do for a man's confidence. In the end I had Victor pinned against the wall under the picture of the Confederate flag, his body surrounded by knives. Not once did I hit the man. I was impressed. I know yall would have been impressed if you had seen me. Victor and Miss Butterfly were not impressed. The local police were not either. The only reason I was not immediately arrested and sent to rot in the local was my relationship with the Police Chief. I helped him solve his messy crimes and I kept my mouth shut about how he was the real father of his sister's child.
Hmm that's what I thought then I wasn't sure so I went with latex."'
"So you were dreaming you and Sherlock were on a case?"the flannel wearing non nipple pierced female asked tentatively while stealing a glance at the good doctor's banana clad crouch which appeared to be pitching some sort of banana tent.
"John is upset."
"Dr. John Watson," John said extending his hand to the star," and this is my partner Sherlock Holmes," he said pointing to the detective. Martin shook his hand and took in the obviously aroused 6 ft detective next to him, an evil grin spread across his face. Martin looked at John.
Leaving the city was easier than Sherlock Holmes had thought it would be. The Alpha never thought he would ever want to leave his beloved London but for his family he would do anything. The last few months had been quiet with the skeptics after John had contacted some hacker friends. He and John had managed to get William Scott Watson Holmes baptized without much fan fare. There was a photo in the Daily Mail of the family going into the church but nothing else. It was in the six month of young Will's life that things went to hell.
The boys had decided to take a stroll around Regent’s park and perhaps feed the ducks. It was a beautiful day. They had been indoors for the morning planning their upcoming wedding. Mummy had come over to fuss over John and aggravate her youngest son. Mrs. Hudson had made biscuits. All in all it was a lovely morning. They were wandering through the park discussing some of the options they still needed to decide upon. The biggest sticking point had been the colors of the serviettes. John had wanted lilac. Sherlock wanted a deep emerald blue to match the Omega’s eyes. They were walking side by side shoulders barely touching except when they would inevitably bump into each other. By the end of their walk all remaining decisions had been made and of course the serviettes would be the emerald blue.
All was going splendidly which John knew was never a good sign. He had noticed that the comments section of his blog only had positive notes to him and Sherlock. The Omega decided he did not want to know what Sherlock had asked of his brother to make that happen.
"Just yours and apparently you were hung like a horse the way I kept lusting after it."
At the end, John smirked and grabbed Sherlock by the sleeves and dragged him backstage. Mycroft had thoughtfully arranged for them to meet the cast after the performance. John made small talk with the cast while patiently waiting for the play's star to emerge. Sherlock quietly vibrated beside him not saying a word. Finally Martin Freeman emerged freshly showered wearing a fitted suit with an open neck shirt. Sherlock let out a sound that sounded very much like a moan and then quickly looked down with a faint blush beginning to creep up that alabaster skin. John chuckled softly beside him. The doctor quickly manhandled his detective over to where Martin was speaking with a few cast mates.
"John…."
“What things are your referring to?” I inquired innocently. I knew damned well what she was talking about. My mother referred to women she deemed promiscuous as ‘old bats’ and homosexuals were referred to as ‘one of those things’. I obviously was ‘one of those things’ and an ‘old bat’ on good days.
John Watson managed to regain some of his brain function shortly after he got his 6 foot something porn darling pretty much naked. The boots had remained on because well the good doctor had some kinks. Actually the good doctor had a shit load of kinks but as of right now he was focused on just the one. The detective had been demeshed and the vinyl not latex pants had been removed. That had been a bitch. Apparently Sherlock had been a wee bit nervous about how the whole evening was going to go down and had begun to perspire in his black shiny tight vinyl pants. John had not noticed due to the materials' non absorbing nature. There was a brief suggestion that involved scissors that was shot down in John's opinion a bit prematurely. He had been a surgeon for god's sake. His hands did not shake that much and did Sherlock really think he would in any way harm that mouth watering specimen between the detective's legs. In the end a brief tough tug brought the whole shebang down and it was quite fortunate that the consulting detective/former porn star had remembered to keep up his waxing regime. Now that he had the man as naked as he wanted him the good fun could begin.
"No regrets I hope"
"Yes John."
Sherlock needs to get out but his plans are sidelined by a crazy Suga. As always all mistakes are mine and I do not own these lovely characters, am merely playing with them.
"Yes that one. For the record there was no dragging of anyone. I believe you met me at your door moments after I texted you.'
"So you're...."
"Right...so I remember doing um I mean taking a body shot and......."
"Top drawer in night stand. Can you reach it?"
"Fuckity fuck fuck"The good doctor was thwarted in his attempt to yet again take the oversized detective in his mouth. This time it was not  by vinyl not latex trousers but by handcuffs. This was getting ridiculous. How hard can it be for two overly aroused individuals to get off. Apparently when you are Sherlock and John....very!
The decision was made that evening. They would leave London. The Holmes family had a small estate in Sussex. It would be a lovely place for Will to grow up. Sherlock would be able to raise bees and John could write. The small family left the next month. The criminal classes proved to be more imaginative in the country and the neighbors were quite protective of the Watson-Holmes. John and Sherlock finally bonded when Will was nine months old and nine months later came Emily and Violet. Their family was completed 2 years later when Max was born.
"My mother  has an itch and it appears to be caused by tiny tiny bugs with sharp teeth," I replied attempting to appear to be the sane one in this organization. I do not think I was too successful but the good doctor nodded and began to examine Suga and the case of the invisible bugs.
“Yes Sherlock he is.”John knew when he had been beat.”….let’s get you home, you sentimental sap and you can touch and look…”
"With lots and lots of whipped cream...."
"Sherlock please stay and solve this case."
"We can't bond until after the pup is born. I want to show everyone that you are mine. That I am yours. That this was not an accident."replied Sherlock shakily unsure of what the older Omega's response would be.
“Don’t go teasin’ an old lady like that. You either put up or shut up.” She laughed batting away my hand.
"Will it burn genitals when applied?"
He put on his long coat. Yeah John was a brave man but he was not stupid. He really was not feeling getting  beat up on his way to get laid.  While the world had indeed changed. some folks still  had trouble with grown men in vinyl and those old ladies had really heavy purses and boy could they swing them. No thought John it is for the best if he tried to blend in on the street.  He bid Giovanni a farewell with the promise to give Sherlock "his thlove" and began the arduous walk to Baker Street. The shoes were to die for and he was convinced his feet would be dead before he got there. He soldiered on...thinking of the lovely marks that would be left on his deceased limbs. He  might have fondled a nipple now and then and well a moan or two might have escaped but fortunately there were no little old ladies with large handbags near by. The few large and burly men near him didn't seem to mind and by the time he reached 221 there appeared to be quite a few of them near the now almost 6 foot tall Doctor. He shooed them off with a curt. "Thorry boys this arse is taken." They smiled nodded and wandered off. John needed to get a handle on himself or at least on the lisp. Good god what was going to happen when he actually got naked with the detective. Avoid all t's and s's. That eliminated a lot of John's favorite words. The most favorite being "Sherlock".
John was frozen in front of his laptop. Sherlock knew that John Watson. That was the soldier John. The John that had killed a man for him the first day they met. This was not good. Sherlock knew better than sneak up on this John. He cleared his throat to get the omega's attention.
"No thank you we are fine."
"And???"
"No I haven't. Hello, pleasure", he said trying to keep his hand from shaking.
“She explained that they are very comfortable for an Omega in your stage of your pregnancy and for this climate. She assured me the material would breathe and that there would be no chafing.”
“Yes, I have come home to take care of Mother.” And I can’t step foot back in the great state of Mississippi but the good doctor really did not need to know that.
"Oh dear god no.."
“Private, no one will see,”mumbled the detective from the now fully aroused Omega’s arse where he had buried his face.
"No Sherlock it really can't"
If you were to ask John Watson the most horrifying noise he had ever heard he would have answered mortar fire in Afghanistan but that was before he awoke to his mate sobbing. John woke to an empty bed which was pretty much standard fare when one slept with Sherlock Holmes. The Alpha was known for his aversion to sleep. The only reason to went to bed now was the promise of a little something extra involving a very pregnant John Watson and ample amounts of nudity and body fluids. John put on his dressing gown and waddled out to the lounge to seeing his beautiful mate hunched over in his chair, tears streaming down his alabaster face.
” The video has over 75,000 hits. It has gone viral.”
"oh thank god it's back"John then lunged at his new toy/snack and then abruptly stopped mid air, mouth open, drool descending....
"Oh no, not that...that was a surprise."
“Well Suga needs me and I needed to get the hell out of dodge.”
"I dont."
"I'm serious, Sherlock"
"You're not gay."
"Oh dear god"John had created a monster. But it had been awhile since they had played and Mrs. Hudson had been clamoring to watch the little one."yes we can get some rope."
"I need air," he whispered to her.
"Have you been looking at the porn on my laptop?"  John asked innocently.You see somewhere in John's reptile brain he had remembered where he had seen the current ensemble his flatmate was sporting right down to the silver nipple rings. John had many a good night with that particular video. He had chosen it for the sole reason that the actor had an uncanny resemblance to his mad flatmate
'Drugs usually,'I answered,"uppers mostly but I must say going to war and getting shot at did a mighty fine job of shutting the fuckers up for awhile." He smiled and nodded.
"The address of our new flat."
"Of course don't all the good parts of my life include you."
The stairs to the second floor were steep and hand rails were for the weak. Suga and my daddy  had their bedroom on the first floor along with my grandmother. She lived with us after my grandfather passed. I had the run of the second floor. There was one bathroom on the first floor that was added sometime in the 1920s. Each bedroom had a chamber pot and yes of course I used that fuckin’ thing. There was no way in hell I was going to freeze my ass off attempting to pee and take the chance of breaking a limb.
" I merely observed.” I smirked.
Dr. Sex chuckled and I blushed and the heavens smiled upon me as the curl sprang free just as the good doctor glanced my way. Of course the demonic one could not deal with someone else getting attention and decided to butt her big fat nose into the proceedings.
"Disarray and really John do you really need to get all shouty."
John has had enough.
"Of course John."
"I really don't know. The last thing I remember before I woke up was Sherlock telling me he knew Lestrade's name was Greg." John realized that point alone should have alerted him to the fact he was dreaming. Sherlock would never have said that!
As part of my ongoing therapy I am to write in a journal to express my thoughts and feelings in a more constructive (socially acceptable) way. My therapist is named Amber and that pisses me off  more than the damned journal.  I am curious if it would be considered constructive to write how much her fucking name bothers me.
“Does this mean we will be gay together.”
"No John, I could not. No context. I have never had the opportunity to observe a woman having her upcoming nuptials cancelled due to the fact her intended husband eloped with his best man. I now know for future reference to duck."
This was a problem. Not that John was gay. Sherlock was not homophobic. That would just be ridiculous seeing as he too was gay. The problem was, could 221 B really hold two flamboyantly gay males. Sherlock was the drama queen. He was the one who swanned. He was Mr. fucking Cheekbones in the tight pants. But for John. All for John.
"Neither am I, but my god look at that arse."
It was opened to the Tumblr site and the search tag indicated 'Sherlock Holmes and John Watson', John's heart briefly stopped when he realized what he was looking at. It was a post by some random person stating that they had the 'tea' on the couple. The tea was that Sherlock was in fact not a recovering addict but was still an addict. The post went on to state that he had begun using again when he found out that John was pregnant. It also stated that Sherlock was devastated about that news and did not want to be saddled with the Omega when he still hadn't found his 'soulmate'. John was livid. He knew that many considered him to be an old broken former Army surgeon but this was different. Sherlock was committed to his sobriety and to his marriage and life with John. There was no question, John Watson and Sherlock Holmes were destined to always be together. This 'truther' bastard was going down. No one makes Sherlock Holmes cry and question his relationship. Not on John's watch.
"Just like that. I bump into you and now I am supposed to run out on my fiancee to do god knows what with a madman in a very expensive coat?"
"What do you remember?"
“Sherlock”
Now I had spent a year perfecting my oral skills as well as other skills. My magician friend was a knife thrower. You know the guy who throws knives at his scantily clad assistant at the fairs that travel around the south in the summer. Well I was the scantily clad assistant. When I wasn't blowing the magician or getting knives thrown at me, he would teach me his technique.
Oh dear god why is there an earthquake in my bed when I am just trying to get off with my best mate. John then registered that it was not an earthquake but rather the good doctor was being shaken to within an inch of his life.....
"Hmmm"
Martin licked his lips and returned his focus to John  and said, "You know I'm not gay."
“Afghanistan. But how did you know?”
He rattled off in rapid fire."Oh and Dr. Watson the only thing that is the matter with you is you are bored." And with that Sherlock got up and left me and the sputtering idiot formerly known as Dr. Hottie alone and speechless.
"Yes,  I am well aware of that. Didn't  you hear the part about the  wearing of banana pjs!"I explained hoping he would understand my confusion.
“Sherlock?”
"Why are you yelling? I told you I knicked them from Giovanni."
Sherlock could not believe he was doing this. This was absurd. He should just go home and lock himself in his room. But he couldn’t. This was for John. Ever since his mad flatmate had decided to come out of the closet, his mind palace had been in shambles. The consulting detective always figured the good doctor was bisexual but no apparently that would have been too simple. Nope the former straight three continents Watson was now GAY. As in rainbow pride gay. Wearing of small speedo gay. Truth be told Sherlock was kind of betting on the speedo part.
"What? No I don't think so. She was pregnant although I don't think it was mine and she was some sort of trained killer. Kind of fuzzy on that."
"You don't believe me?"
"Brother mine I am so sorry."
This whole mess came to a head when I tracked the happy lovebirds to the local Golden Corral. Now I have personally never set foot into this particular establishment. I have heard rumors about what small children stick into the chocolate fountain. I also tend to avoid anything with the words 'all you can eat' unless it involves men with bare asses.
"Fine. borrowed."
"Understandable,  you have just awoken from some sort of nightmare. You were thrashing about yelling my name and I might be mistaken but you might have lisped."
How Sherlock got into this mess.
“Oh for god’s sake...quit touching it...and do not rub it.”
I really should have seen this mess coming. Victor had been distant with me for months now. I just wrote it off to the new semester starting and the pressure with a new University President. I had no idea that the real reason was Butterfly Cassandra Wilson. Sometimes I really hate living in the South. I mean I thought Locky was bad but Butterfly. Miss Wilson was from some hog waller in southern Mississippi. She was the first one in her family to go to college. I suspect that Victor and her mama were the same age but I could be wrong. Butterfly was in Victor's freshman composition class. I never understood why Victor continued to teach freshman classes. Apparently it was not the classes but the freshman in the classes.
“Goodness gracious I never thought I would ever see your skinny gay ass around here again.”
"No latex. Allergy.'
Baby's first pap walk.
“Relax old gal. There is enough aqua net in that bee hive to light you up like a roman candle. That hair is not going anywhere.” Though to be honest mine wasn’t going anywhere either. Might need to help that wayward curl to escape before we got to the good doctor.
"Giovanni, Giovanni, Giovanni........"
"Sister, I have a sister not brother." I replied
"OK, well good for you."replied the older man," want to meet up this weekend and watch a game and catch up."
“At least it looks like you had a good night,” I replied.
I met with Dr. Hottie again today, except this time I wasn't alone. There was someone else in the room with us. A patient slouched low in his chair, fingers absently drumming on his thigh. As if he were playing an instrument....piano..no violin, based on the finger placement and callouses on his fingers. interesting. This man, no really a boy wore a scowl on his chiseled face, his grey blue eyes staring into me. It was as if he could read my deepest darkest thoughts. "Good luck with that" I scoffed.
"No god dammit I was thinking we might want to use a plug on me......"To be honest Sherlock's mind kind of went offline right after the word plug came out of the pretty doctor's mouth. His vision began to blur at the edges and he quite frankly thought he was in the beginning stages of a stroke. Fortunately however for his horny doctor it was this very same moment that a certain large detective appendenge decided to perk up and join the party. The good dr squealed that his new favorite toy/snack had decided to return.
"We have matching tattoos and now we have matching gun shot wounds. Although yours is much more impressive."
"I'm sorry..."
Just as suddenly the door swung opened and the tall curly haired sex god formerly known as Sherlock stuck his head in and asked, "Did I get anything wrong?"
"I heard you the first time John. I would have thought it was perfectly clear what I was wearing."
"Tedious. I will text you my findings. I need to get John home before he turns all of Londan gay."yelled Sherlock as he was stuffing John and himself into a taxi.
Oh look it is an update! Don't know how that happened!
"But why?"
"Sherlock Holmes, and come along John. The game is on!"
John winked at the taxi driver and he slid out of the cab. He thanked him for the offer but politely explained his heart belonged to another. John sprinted up the 17 steps to the flat hoping the consulting detective had decided to join the land of living. As he opened the door to the flat he noticed that while the lump was indeed gone it had apparently decided to leave the flat all together.
"Oh sorry...sorry,"John mumbled to the coat struggling to remain upright.
Today we had group. A good time was had by all. Amber was in pink today. Of course she was. It was a fucking rainy Monday and she works in a loony bin. So pink it is. I would love to talk to her about this rather unfortunate wardrobe choice. Perhaps I could analyse her and find out exactly why in god's name she decided to wear a pink shirt with fucking kittens on it. Honest to god kittens. WTF?  We are already suicidal. Do we really need more to egg us on.
"Once again John don't be tedious. It is for your stag night."
"Who?"
“Oh good no chafing. How the hell could anything chafe. There was nothing to rub against anything. His arse cheeks would be out and about and oh dear god he would need to apply sunscreen or rather Sherlock would need to apply sunscreen to them. Yup he definitely was going to kill the Alpha, but maybe it could wait until after his mate  buggered him. John had found himself going from a teeny tiny bit aroused to a great deal aroused. The blasted red fabric was incredibly soft and he noticed he had been fondling it a bit and well maybe he had begun to rub it across his increasingly interested appendage. Oh what the hell, they were on vacation.
Brad had suggested that John wear a very tight and very small black v neck t shirt with his very tight and very small shorts. He also suggested that the former soldier polish up his army boots. He had said that every boy loves a soldier. John had also rimmed his baby blues with a dark kohl eyeliner which made them pop, according to Brad.
John limped out of the banquet room heading for the nearest door. That was until he bumped into someone. A rather tall and dark someone wearing a most impressive coat.
"Hmm...."
Surely the shorts will fit now!
"Um, yes.....How?" stammered John
"Hey Pete leave the boy alone, we don't want to get Doc in trouble with his man." added another player.
Nor would he admit to his brother the great sense of envy he felt for the younger man. Mycroft had never once in his life yearned for a mate and a pup but at that very moment he felt that perhaps in the end alone does not protect you.
“Sherlock, honey is that you,” yelled a familiar voice.
It had been a quiet couple of weeks for the boys of Baker Street. John had encouraged Sherlock to take a few non-dangerous cases to get him out and about. He had actually joined the Alpha on one that according to Sherlock was a 3 at a minimum. It felt good to be out running through London with his madman by his side.
"God I love you, you git. Come here so I can show you how much."
"I'm sorry?"
"Why are you wearing shiny black tight vinyl trousers on a Tuesday?"
"For the love of god...PLEASE STOP TALKING!"
"Well sir we have not received any complaints of that happening that I am aware of."
It was two weeks later before Sherlock went out on another case for Lestrade. John had persuaded him to give the Di another chance. Mostly it was the fact that the Alpha was running him crazy. The pregnant Omega could not move without running into the possessive git. John was beginning to show a bit more and Sherlock's favorite thing in the world was to rub his nose along his bump and scent him. The consulting detective could not keep his greedy paws off of it. The Alpha had also become extremely randy and John was convinced that if it was possible, Sherlock would stay buried in him constantly. The Omega enjoyed the attention from his mate but the time had come for him to shower and actually put on clothes and perhaps even update his blog. He had not updated it since he posted the announcement of their pending marriage.
"So guys this is Sherlock Holmes, my partner. Sherlock, the guys."John motioned to the half drunk men who were quickly becoming interested in the proceedings.
"221B Baker St,"Sherlock quickly jumped in the cab leaving Lestrade and the reporters standing on the sidewalk wondering just what the hell had happened.
“Hmm….”
“Oof,” grunted John from position atop the consulting detective who was now sprawled on the dance floor.
God why do they always have to deal with decomposing bodies when it is bloody hot. How 'bout January? Hmm....here is an idea serial killers....kill in the winter months. It will take the Met longer to find the bodies and just think of how many you can get before they catch on. Jesus John needed to sit down. God it was hot. When did it get so hot? Christ it is hot.
"Yes, John."
“Um Mr. Holmes, may I have a word with you?” Oh yes Dr. Sex you may have anything you want with me.
Aqua Net is a hairspray. It comes in a can and is highly flammable. It also guarantees your hair will not move!
"Your wife. The trained killer who put a hole in my chest. Ring any bells in that pretty blond head of yours."
"Sherlock?'
"Sherlock?" asked John
"We are done here Lestrade. I believe you can solve this one on your own."quickly responded the consulting detective. Sherlock pulled up his collar and drew his coat closer to his body and quickly left the scene. There was no way he was going to let those imbeciles see how Donovan's words had affected him. They did not understand. John loved him and he loved John. The good doctor saw beyond his prickly exterior and loved all of him. He wanted to bond with the high functioning sociopath. He wanted to have pups with him, Sherlock Holmes. The Alpha needed to return home to his Omega. He needed to scent him, to lay with him, and just be with his pregnant mate to be.
"What about your family? Did you ever think about us? Do we even matter to you?"Asked my alcoholic estranged sister. It is always so nice when siblings can bond over substance abuse.
The decision is made to leave London.
John Watson did not want to be gay. He had seen the abuse thrown at Harry over the years. He saw the look of disappointment in his father's eyes. Nope John Watson would not be gay. He would be normal. He would be a doctor, go to war, find a nice girl and have a family. Instead he met a madman, fell hopelessly in love with the man and the madness. Madman died so that John could be normal. So now John is standing on the edge of 40 living in a semi-detached in the suburbs with a woman he doesn't really know with a child that isn't his.
"It was for a case."
“Not volia my arse. A fucking thong. A red fucking thong!” John had begun to lose what little precious patience he had. When they had departed London it had been cold. Bitterly cold and John had dressed for bitterly cold. Now in Bora Bora it was warm, very very warm and John was not dressed for very very warm. He had taken off his bitterly cold appropriate clothes so that he might put on some clothes for the new very very warm weather.
Shit just got real for the horny doctor and his consulting porn star. Dr. Watson was so done. Really he thought this is what finally does me in. Not the death faking, the sham baby, the killer wife, the shooting. Nope a pair of questionable quality handcuffs and satin sheets.Nope. Not gonna happen. This was not his fucking fault.
“ I need you to forward me that link.”
“And kiss”
“Sherlock dear come out and let Daddy see you,” he lisped.
"Still holding on to your fantasy I see," snarked Sherlock.
“It was a dark and stormy night….once upon a time….”
Valentine's Day was extra romantic this year when Alpha Sherlock Holmes and Omega Dr John Watson were married in the garden at the Holmes family home. Dr. Watson wore a custom wedding suit designed and made especially for him by the house of Valentino. The design house was pleased to have been chosen to help commemorate such a special occasion.  The couple to be had visited several designers during  Paris Fashion Week. Mr Holmes had made an inspiration board and  felt Valentino most closely represented the aesthetic he was looking for in the dressing of his Omega. Mr. Holmes had said of his wedding to Dr. Watson " There is a narrative of the individual and the occasion  and the setting that is utterly unique. "
"?????"
"Key love?"
John was beginning to show and had invested in some paternity wear. He made the fatal mistake of allowing that clothes horse he lived with to pick the pieces out. John did not even want to take a guess at the amount they had spent at the Omega store. John would never admit it out loud but it felt good to be fawned over by the Alpha. He enjoyed modeling the outfits in the store and  had  managed to sneak in a surprise for Sherlock which was modeled after they had returned home. Sherlock was very appreciative of the new undergarment and went back the next day to purchase a whole week’s worth of the garments. John was currently sporting a red pair with an embroidered Monday in gold thread.
“Right there in front of you,” smiled Sherlock a little too smugly if John was being honest with him self.
"what?" It was at this point things got a bit weird. Weirder than dancing bananas. We are talking what the fuck just happened. John realized that while he was in a bed in questionable sleep attire his bed partner was not the python hung vinyl clad nipple pierced male he was expecting. Oh no. It was a flannel wearing enormously pregnant blond non nipple pierced female.
Sherlock had returned home, successfully solving yet another case for those imbeciles. It was good to get out but he had missed the doctor terribly. Not that anyone needed to know that. He could not wait to remove all of his clothing and take his pregnant Omega back to bed.
"Mary?" He squeaked slowly turning in the direction of that rather annoying voice.
"Yes John I am here."
"Always Sherlock."
“Observed?” Oh goodness gracious this man was adorbs. His eyes got all squinty and his little brow furrowed. I just wanted to scoop him up and well…..I wanted to do lots and lots of things.
"What is the acidity of your Pina Colada personal lubricant?"
It all started with a pair of shorts. John supposed they were shorts. They were so very small they could have been underpants. They were leather and black and very very soft. Like butter. They had called to him from the shop window. The mannequin was wearing them with black laced up boots and a tiny black billed hat. No shirt. John was mesmerized. He stopped and stared and then he did the unthinkable.
"Research obviously."
"Tomorrow at 7 ok?' asked Martin.
John and Brad  had met outside the club and after some flirtatious banter with the bouncer made their way into the dark space. The cab ride over had been interesting for John. He had never in his life felt more exposed but fortunately based on the leers, he looked fucking good. The good doctor puffed up his chest, adjusted his teeny tiny leather shorts and went into battle.
My grandmother had only one child and thus the house went to Suga. I lived the greater part of my life in this house. It did not have central heating or air. It was hot in the summer and cold in the winter. At some point someone put in gas heaters in the ancient fireplaces but they were unvented which meant you either needed to open a window or die in your sleep.  Needless to say the heaters were not on at night. Thank god to whoever invented the electric heating blanket. I know they say it can kill sperm but I knew at an early age reproducing was not in my cards. I would rather be toasty warm at night even if I did not find the female form arousing.
"Fine. Go. But please let me call one of Mycroft's cars to take you back to Baker Street."
Tart? Fall to their knees? Well! I did not think the old gal had it in her. Hmm... this was certainly interesting. The old bat had it bad for Dr. Sex. Too fucking bad she would lose. I have no doubt the good doctor was straight but honestly that really is not a deal breaker. Many of my conquest used to be straight but once you have been sucked by the best well everyone else just sucks!
"Home in bed with me."
“John,” breathed Sherlock who was attempting to move from said floor and grope the good doctor’s arse at the same time. Apparently Sherlock needed to work on his multitasking skills.
"Are we really locked in this warehouse?"
“Sherlock, get your arse in here RIGHT NOW!”, shouted a very angry and teeny tiny aroused Captain Watson.
"Oh Brad you certainly know how to flatter a man,"John gathered up his purchase,"Um Brad are you busy right now."
"Absolutely. Get some rest. Your mother will sleep for some time now." He replied shaking my hand.
John was going to kill the Alpha. No, strike that John was positive he was going to kill that mother fucking Alpha. He shouldn't have been surprised. I mean really when was the last time Sherlock offered to pack. John knew there wasn't really a case but he quite frankly didn't care. The resort was gorgeous and private. And he should have known better. Mr. Sherlock Holmes doesn't just randomly do something out of the goodness of his heart. Nope. Not gonna happen. Which is how Dr. John Watson got to this point. A grown man standing around starkers looking into his supposedly packed suitcase only to find, red. Lots and lots of red fabric. He couldn't really call them clothes. That would imply that these pieces of fabric were intended to actually cover something.
"Sherlock?" John opened his eyes and looked in the direction of his dear friend's voice which was up not straight. Straight ahead was the warm wet bulge which so happened to belong to a certain consulting detective. Fuck! thought John, it is really bad form to attempt to suck your flatmate through his shiny black tight vinyl trousers.
"So you made a porno and did not bother to tell me."
I miss my Daddy. He never made any judgments about what stupid idea I got in my pretty little head. He would just smile and say “whatever makes you happy Locky’. Suga did not give a rat’s ass about what made me happy. She was perfectly content for me to park my ass in Mississippi and never set foot in Georgia again. Oh she was going to be sooo happy to see my smiling gay self coming home to nurse her back to health.
"Burning"
"Oh daddy these lovelies will certainly maximize your assets,"chirped a rather blond and fit young man named Brad as John was paying for the shorts.
"Hmm, what shall we do my dear?"
“Hey mama, how you feelin’”
"Mmm..." replied his mostly naked handcuffed slightly sprain detective.
Today Sherlock was wearing black trousers that looked like they had been painted on and an equally tight dark green button front shirt that looked like he had forgotten to button most of. I was in loose pajama pants and a old t shirt. I would be lying if I hadn't picked out the shirt on purpose. The shirt was from when I played rugby as a lad. It too looked liked it was painted on.  Sherlock began humming and shifted slightly in his chair, legs opening to an obscene position. Now the fun was to begin. Dr. Hottie cleared his throat in obvious discomfort.
Dr. Hottie cleared his throat in obvious discomfort. Sherlock chuckled and Dr. Hottie blushed.
Since it takes roughly eight hours to get back home we might as well get to know one another. My name is William Sherlock Scott Holmes.Yes, that is my real name.  I go by Sherlock  but my family has always called me Locky.  For the love of god I have no fucking idea why they can’t just call me Sherlock. I would even take Will or Bill or even Willie. I believe this proves my theory that my mother is indeed the spawn of Satan. I mean who the fuck names their child William but calls him Locky. I know what you are thinking, people with no teeth and married to their first cousin kind of folks. I will have you know that my mama has all of her own teeth. Pretty sure my daddy wasn’t her first cousin but not positive. I know that Sallie Mae my mama’s mama was married to her first cousin. My mama’s sister Dottie was married to kin too. Anyway my point being, my folks aint some white trash kind of family yet they go and call their only son Locky.
“A little less what Mother?”
"Hold on....what is going on?"
I did however end up in the anger management therapy and now I am heading home to a special kind of hell.
"Lestrade called. It's an eight John,"Sherlock responded.
It really was an accident. I didn't mean to take so many...they were small. I was desperate and that was that....lying in a pool of piss and vomit...staring into the eyes of disappointment.
"Thure no problem." John really needed to ponder this interaction with Giovanni. Was this all a dream? Was some of this real? How does Sherlock know this man? Does this mean Sherlock really has vinyl trousers and nipple piercings? Is all of this going to go very pear shaped? And most of all where the hell did this lisp come from? John really didn't have time for all of this shit. If this was a dream he really needed to get to the detective to start getting naked and busy and if this was reality...he then really really needed to get to the detective and start getting busy. John figured it was a win win for him.
The cat is out of the bag and Sherlock loses his cool.
"Sherlock I can stay. It is fine. You just got home. I know you haven't eaten or slept in the past week." John was wearing a navy blue fitted suit with a white shirt with the neck undone. He had been invited to an arts exhibit. Annie Leibovitz had taken John's photo as part of an exhibit of Omegas who had served in the military. He was photographed naked while 6 months pregnant with Will. It was Sherlock's favorite photo of his mate. The juxtaposition of his pregnant body with the gunshot wound brought tears to the Alpha. There was no way John was to miss this. "John, we will be fine. I want you to go. I want everyone to see the wonderful man I have chosen to spend my life with."
“Where exactly am I to put my hand John?”
He had been convinced that the whole night had been a dream. John had thought his dream started with the bit in the warehouse. That theory had gotten blown to hell when he was trolling high street and  came upon Giovanni's Sex Emporium and Piercing Parlor. Perhaps he had passed by this fine establishment on one of his many chases with Sherlock and simply placed it in his dream. That could happen. So John went with that theory. He also for some bizarre reason found himself drawn to Giovanni's. Most likely it had to do with it being a sex emporium. Who was John fooling. he was horny as hell and eager to get off with his very male former flatmate. So down the rabbit hole he went. Upon entering the store John was hit with the overwhelming smell of vinyl and his mouth began to water. So much vinyl. The doctor apparently had died and gone to some sort of smut heaven or hell. Where to begin? Fortunately Giovanni smelled blood or arousal or perhaps a man with a wad of cash. He was most helpful. Showing John where to find the vinyl trousers of his dream. How to accessorize said vinyl trousers and the piece de resistance. The shoes! The bloody to die for fuck me please shoes.
John and Brad spent a giggly morning out getting all freshened up for their night out. It was decided that they would hit up the TomKat first. Brad assured John that the shorts would be well received there. The music was good and boys were just delish Brad had purred. John attempted to picture Mr. Cheekbones at the club. He pictured Sherlock as a 'dark fuck prince', all leather and smoky eyes. It was a good thing John was sitting down during his wee fantasy as a certain part of his anatomy was having a hard time staying seated.
"It is ok sometimes I lisp too."
“Relax, Maybe you will get squirted with some of the blood.”
"Of course"
“What would you daddy say if he was still alive?”She asked.
“Did they run you out of Mississippi?”
"Of course we are don't be obtuse.."
"No what?" John then noticed that he was not alone in the being done party." Shit, shit, shitty shit shit!" So close and yet so fucking far. The python of his dream had deflated and appeared to be hiding. To be fair satin can be a bit chilly in the winter months. Focus Watson, you invaded Afghanastan. How hard can it be to invade Holmestan. John chuckled to himself, like he was going to be the one invading anything. Oh Johnny sometimes you are too funny. Ok one more time. Here we go.
“Is there something I should look out for?”
"Borrowed."
"No burning!"
what got me in the trouble. The voices always the god damned noise in my head. If they would just be quiet all would be well. I would be home. Safe, happy.....all right I'll go with home and safe. If I were happy the noises wouldn't have come. Even in my state I know that. I had been warned repeatedly. Been told what happened to  bad boys who played at being good. And now I was paying the price strapped into a bed wearing a diaper so I wouldn't try to harm myself. FUCK!
"Salt. Margaritas."
“Sherlock quit looking at my stomach. People are going to suspect.”
"What?What the fuck is going on."He slurred and slowly opened his eyes. He was not naked and handcuffed to a bed. He was in a bed but was clothed in some sort of pajama set. "Really dancing bananas John! " he muttered to himself, "no wonder people question your sexuality. "
“Where are my clothes?”John pleaded hoping to some form of deity that his actual clothing was in the detective’s bag.
John shook his head and decided that he would man up and look his friend in the eyes as opposed to where his eyes were currently residing. And yes for the record John H Watson is a total size queen. So sue him! So he looked up but fate being a bitch decided that at that particular moment the overheard warehouse lamp would catch the detective's right nipple ring and it would sparkle. In John's aroused addled mind he would say it winked at him and well....John decided at that moment to throw the baby out with the bath water, to jump the queue on the ride to hell. He leaned forward licked his lips for good measure and attached himself to the detective right nipple and began to for a better word....nurse.
"You must be Peter, John has mentioned you are quite the flirt," replied the detective
Mr. Sherlock Holmes(A) and Dr. John H Watson(O) are engaged to be married. The couple who are expecting their first pup in the spring plan to marry shortly and will bond after the birth. It is expected to be a small family affair.
Oh yeah keep forgetting to put the bit where I don't own these guys. Yall know that. If I did own them I wouldn't be writing fanfiction. Oh no these bad boys would be all vinyl upped and prancing across BBC1 and PBS screens all over the world. This is probably why the licensing gods have decided that I am completely untrustworthy with the boys. So yeah don't own, don't profit...just playing with them for awhile.
John finds a way to get rid of the middle.
For Vex for her lovely words of encouragement.
"The video, porn actors were being murdered and well the only way was to go undercover. They assured me I wouldn't need to do anything with anyone. They said I would be fine on my own..." Yes he was fine on his own John thought very fine. That thing he did with the plug fueled John's wank for a month.
“A thong, don’t be obtuse John it doesn't suit you. The saleswoman at the Omega boutique said it would be perfect when I rang her about appropriate attire for this trip. I explained where we were off to and volia.”
“What video?’
First of all a big thank you to everyone who has left kudos on my little story. I have gotten a wee bit behind since Babybatch is now with us. As always I do not own nor profit. This is a work of fiction. This chapter, I am sure has errors and misspellings, I apologize in advance. Also in case there is any confusion I am pro-Sophie and am tickled pink about her and our dear boy becoming a family.
John could not breathe. How dare they question anything about his relationship with Sherlock. Another Alpha!! That is a joke...never mind that there isn't a lot of demand for a wounded ex Army Omega Dr. Oh yes thought John darkly I have them lined up around the block waiting for their chance to mount me.
"We need to talk."
"John i really don't want to talk about Mary while we are handcuffed to a bed, naked and aroused."
"John?'
(See the end of the chapter for
"Was she a pre op transsexual or something."
“Yes, your haircut and mannerism. You stand at attention even though you are unaware you are doing it. Your hair is cut precisely and very well I might add. Otto always can be counted on to give a superb cut(Otto is the only decent barber in a 100 mile radius, he also gives spectacular head). Also,we sent a lot of boys out of Ft. Stewart so you would have been familiar with the area. We don't get many Brits in these parts and very few folks outside of Jeff Davis county have even heard of this hell hole so you would have had to have known someone from Gertmond and well we don't travel much so….Army. And the only two areas we have sent troops to in the last 15 years were Afghanistan and Iraq”
"hmm" he said around the pert nipple in his mouth causing a certain detective to emit a interesting noise a cross between a squeak and a moan. Sherlock would deny any noise had escaped those perfect cupid shaped lips...
As always all mistakes are mine!
"I am assuming since we are about to take our friendship to a more physical level that you would want to talk about your pending infidelity"
"Fucking hell Sherlock! Kindly explain to me  how exactly we ended up in bed together and married!"
"Disarray? ....and yes I really do need to shout since we are due to fly back to London for my wedding to Mary but I am apparently already married to my best MAN. A MAN! Me not gay John Watson, am married to a BLOKE."
“I woke up dressed like a floozy coming home after a night of caterwauling.”
"Gladly John."
“I am getting the feeling that you are not taking this very seriously.”
This was a problem. He needed the detective home. The plan was Sherlock would see John in the booty shorts and get all hot and bothered that John would never make it to the club. John did not tell Brad this version of his plan. He did not want to disappoint his new friend and also he needed a back up if it all went tits over arse. I suppose he really just cares for me as a friend, thought John. On to battle it would seem. John needed to accept this and move on. He would take his hotness and his mighty fine arse and find someone who would appreciate it, hopefully a someone who was hung as a horse. Hey a boy could dream and if he couldn't have the one he wanted well he would have one who could make him forget.
As always no beta, mistakes all mine. Do not own these characters merely playing with them.
"I do."
Sherlock finally succumbed to lung cancer shortly after their 50th wedding anniversary. John followed shortly after.
"Mycroft"
"Sherlock,"he said placing his oh so warm hand on my bare arm,"we need to talk about your mother." Now that is a statement to cause permanent erectile dysfunction.
John finds out he is pregnant.
"What was for a case?"
"Oh Jawn I do love banoffee pie...."
"????"
"Wednesday."
"Although Mary pulling a gun was a bit of a surprise."
Saturday was John's first day off in over a week and he was looking forward to his morning out with Brad and even more to his evening out. He told the lump on the sofa that he was going to run errands and would be back after lunch. He really hoped the lump was his moody flatmate and not just a lump of blankets. It was so hard to tell since he would have gotten the same response from blankets, nothing. That was not anything new. Sherlock frequently ignored John and then got all indignant when he could not find his blogger to procure whatever he was too lazy to get.
The rest of the day passed uneventfully. Mother ignored me as best she could. She watched her stories on the tv and played solitaire.  I unpacked and surveyed my room. I do not know how my sexual orientation could have possibly been a surprise to my mother. This was not the room of a straight American male. Scarlett O’Hara would have been at home in this room. I could never understand how that woman let Rhett ever leave her bed. I would have never made that mistake.
(See the end of the chapter for
For those of you who do not know Golden Corral is an all you can eat buffet restaurant. In my opinion it tends to attract folks you normally only see working at county fairs. Never in anyone's imagination would Sherlock Holmes set foot into one, even as a campy gay Southern man. There are limits.
"Body shot."
"John,John love wake up. John please wake up. I am here love. I am here. You are safe. John please wake up,"said a gravelly sleep laden male voice.
"JOHN!"
“Locky, put up the damned top. My hair!”
"Of course. Because we don't really have a baby we have a doll. Lovely."
“Really? What do they say.”
“In your pockets.”replied John getting a bit touchy now.
"John?"
"Really?" he asked.
London Times:
"It is always something. Oh and John the address is 221B Baker Street."
"And we couldn't have researched online from the privacy of our flat..."
"Oh Gregory, I look fucking good and you know it."John couldn't resist. His new favorite thing to do was make straight boys blush. Bingo. Interesting though perhaps the DI isn't as straight as he thought. Hmm...no, thought John he already had his baby blues set on a certain someone. A someone that was proving to be a bit difficult. No problems, Three continents Watson did like a challenge.
John runs across some ugly rumors while out and about......
John approached the situation with military precision. He needed to capture the good detective and hopefully lure him into those delectable shorts. God, he needed a good shag. It had been months since he had seen any action and years since he had had a nice fat cock up his arse. John called up his new bestie Brad to find out the best places to dance and possibly get shagged. Brad was ecstatic to help the good doctor and the pair spent Saturday morning getting all prettied up for their evening .
"John are you awake?'
"What? Why didn't you say anything?"
John explains all to Sherlock.
"What key"
“Sherlock, I am good….you have covered me in sunscreen.”
The boys finally get married.  The quote at the end is taken from Sophie's Vogue article about her dress(which I thought was just about perfect).
“Do you think we could go home and maybe continue this with less leather on. I am beginning to sweat in areas I was unaware had sweat glands.”
"Why, exactly? It is because I am a bloke?"
"Then why the fuck do you insist on calling him Giovanni."
“Honey that was quite the show with Victor in the Golden Corral. I had no idea you were so good with a knife. I need to keep that in mind when Bobby gets out of hand.” Bobby was DJ’s husband. They had been together since grammar school and she had him so whipped and even I couldn’t ever imagine him getting out of hand.
"Semantics. It was decided that salt was a necessary ingredient to the night's activities...and well I might have underestimated that velocity of my pushing and the irritation of the surrounding soft tissue....."
I am not really happy with this chapter but i need to quit rewriting it and just move one. There is no excuse why no one is naked yet in this fic!
"Sherlock?"
"You suspecedt my fiancee might try to shoot you?'
"John don’t be ridiculous. Surely these imbeciles can handle this case without us."
My inspiration for this chapter is still the ugliness on the 'sophie' tag. I was going to have the boys get married but..decided to deal with some ugly rumors...
"John, I need you."
John did not know what Mr. Cheekbones problem was. In his heart he was afraid that he had misread the entire situation and that perhaps Sherlock was indeed straight. And after John finally quit giggling over that theory he thought perhaps the consulting detective simply wasn't into John. That was a sobering thought and one that the good doctor did not want to dwell on. Nope, not going there. He was an attractive ex Army doctor who had just come out of the closet. He had a fantastic arse and a pair of buttery soft leather booty shorts. It was time to put those bad boys to use. Besides he really really needed to get laid.
"Right not embarrassing at all..."
"Mary!" he spoke loudly this time with his captain voice.
"I need you to entertain me"
"I want them to go away. I want you to hunt down these animals and make sure they do not ever distress the father of my child. Do I make myself clear, brother dear."
The club was just as Sherlock expected. Dark, loud and smelly.  It did not take long for Sherlock to feel a hand against his backside and a strange voice mumbling pornographic phrases into his left ear. All the consulting detective could register was that neither of these things belonged to his John. He turned around and growled at this presumptuous not John. It was then he saw his John.
