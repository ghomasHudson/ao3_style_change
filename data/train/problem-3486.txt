The Seraph’s lips pull thin in a tight frown; though, he pointedly keeps his eyes averted. “You are not my prisoner, Dean,” he states, almost convincingly earnest, while endeavoring to sidestep the entire drugging him accusation. “Considering, your willingness upon our agreement.”
The Seraph’s lips pull back in a snarl, ire scarcely bridled. “You know nothing of which you speak," he says, voice lowered an octave. Then, pivots on his heel to storm from the room; the door remaining open in silent invitation.
Once she’s seen they’re nowhere to be found, she digs into a grocery bag near his leg and collects a bottle he immediately recognizes. His heart rate spiking at the mixture of drugs and the results Mary’s aiming for.
“Give me a damn minute!” Dean snaps, wrestling to breathe past the panic clawing through his chest. Refusing to admit to either the reaper or himself that he’s actually frozen in fear rather than just stubbornly defying orders.
Mary yanks him forward with clear expectation of him to do as she desires. But Dean’s never been one to give in to whims and demands so easily—not as a child and, certainly, not now. His legs go slack, crumpling to the ground. The action forcing her to make a split decision; to which, she releases him and permits his fall. Leaving Dean to wonder if this counts as another win when his right side slams down onto frozen, rugged earth.
Cautiously, he steps around Cas. Searching desperately for signs of life, but finding nothing. Cas’ eyes remaining shut, his skin blanched, and hand left outstretched as though reaching for Dean.
“Don’t flatter yourself,” she all but sneers, her professionalism momentarily lapsing. “It’s standard procedure. We require you to enter your checking account information in order to transfer funds to be kept in escrow until a winner is determined. Otherwise, the game will not commence.”
Leaving Dean with a sinking suspicion he’s just signed a contract with the devil.
“True.” Setting the rook down with a
Without hesitation, Dean opens his mouth. Attempting not to panic as she slips the medicine between his lips. Watching him intently until he’s swallowed them dry.
“I don’t—” Swaying dangerously on his feet at a sudden rush of heat, Dean dejectedly drops his gaze in a reflexively submissive gesture. “I don’t have enough money—”
“I have a choice?” Dean returns, his brows lifting expectantly at the way her expression sours.
“Okay, okay.” Dean raises his hands in surrender. “I’m going.”
A wave of nausea overcomes him the moment he clambers out of the Impala, prompting him to scrunch his eyes closed briefly to orient himself before collecting their bags from the backseat. Finding it a tremendous effort to sling them over his uninjured shoulder, and each step an exercise in control, as his knees threaten to give out under the additional weight.
“H-6,” the reaper barks impatiently, banging his scythe against the wall to regain Dean’s attention. “Comply.”
Dean inclines his head a fraction in acknowledgment, reaching for the offered cellular device in the reaper’s outstretched, leather-gloved hand. And is grateful when there’s no protest to return it, even after abruptly turning his back to gain some semblance of privacy.
“One-on-one, usually.” Dean issues a challenging grin. “More personal that way.”
The possession and the implication of future punishment sends a chill racing down Dean’s spine. Still fighting futilely as she lugs him through another door and yanks him without care down a single, concrete step. Dean’s vision exploding white as the back of his head cracks against the edge.
“Understood, sir,” the bartender acknowledges, and without further ado, moves on to attend other patrons as they begin congregating near the opposite end of the bar.
“Walk, Deanna,” she says, somewhat winded, and Dean mentally scores a tally for himself. “Get up on your feet. I’m not carrying you.”
He squirms in his bindings until the pull of the drugs tug him downward. Sapping him of energy until his eyes slide shut of their own volition. Consciousness a fleeting affair as he groggily wakes for several, precious minutes before unwillingly slipping back into slumber.
“Charlie Bradbury.” Offering him an air handshake, she says, “Or if you prefer, you could call me Number One.”
A noticeable gloom overlays the perpetual grey as the sky overhead darkens with new intensity. Storm clouds sweeping and curling angrily, foretelling the worst is yet to come.
Sighing in resignation, Dean trudges onwards, thankful for the respite from the bitter wind as the blizzard conditions mercifully abate the minute he steps into the field. Trudging tiredly on until he’s able to distinguish the beings for himself. Remarking each one’s appearance, and surprised to find their conduct mirroring those of their kind on the recording.
Dean tenses when the footsteps approach the bedside, and jolts when something soft and lightweight partially settles over him. Belatedly recognizing it as a thin blanket while Mary wordlessly retreats. The squeal of a door inordinately loud before it shuts with a sense of finality. Leaving Dean with nothing but the company of pain, the senseless night, and the gut-wrenching memory of Cas’ lifeless features.
“Come on boys!” She called, “wake up!”
Dean's mother was everything Cas missed in only growing up with a father. She prepared them the most wonderful feast. Turkey and mash and a whole bunch of fall vegetables.
That was it. Cas brought himself forward. No more cowardly blue eyed boy. His lips crashed into Deans. They moved fast, but not fast enough. Their arms came around each other. Grabbing and pulling at whatever they could get a hold of, in a desperate attempt to be closer to one another. Their bodies hummed. Dean’s lips tasted so sweet, and he bit his lip as his fingers found his face and hair.
He could zip up his jeans, get his things and go. But he knew it would be pointless. He knew that as much as he didn’t want to admit it, this was the road he wanted to take. He was on the gas now. There was no stopping or denying it.
‘Oh.’ Dean nodded.
It was always hand jobs and blow jobs. Sometimes Cas would moan to be fucked, his mouth saying the words without thought, but Dean would just take him deeper into his throat and leave again when they were both finished.
Cas remembered he was at work and it was a quiet day as it wasn’t a peak time shift. Classes had just begun and he made his way around the tables, cleaning them and kindly giving top ups for the few people that were in there. He remembered they were quiet enough that he could sit behind the till on his phone, texting Meg and that his boss was able to stay out back pretty much the whole time.
Dean shook his head and pinched the bridge of his nose.
“Hello?” It was silent for a moment, and then a whisper.
‘The only reason I went to the hospital was to see if you were alive and ok. I don’t care about that Dean, you know I don’t.’ Cas kept his voice steady, knowing as soon as he raised it to shout he would unintentionally cry too.
‘It’s just so
‘But still, I’m part of the group I suppose and I really just came to see these people.’ Castiel gestured at the people chatting around the table.
Cas didn’t care about the pace. Maybe he would have liked it slow sometimes but he liked the way Dean pushed him down on the bed, or against the wall. He liked being told to be quiet, to get on his knees, to swallow Dean's cock. It left him weak and somehow full, letting Dean decide how he would come and when.
‘You can say I’m your boyfriend.’ Dean finally said. ‘Just for today. But I don’t wanna do any of that other crap. No PDA, no holding hands like a pair of girls.’
He had spent the weekend hopelessly trying to gather sources for a paper he was writing and finally by Sunday evening he was making progress. This week he would finally clear his head, maybe get some of his energy out at the gym and get some good work done.
‘What?’ Castiel laughed as Dean’s strong fingers gripped his thighs.
Cas crawled up to lie beside him, giving him a small kiss on the forehead.
They admired each other’s faces in the glow of the moon and the street lights. Cas watched while Dean took him all in, his eyes wondering from his hair and then his cheeks. When they landed on his lips they hovered for just a moment. Neither of them moving, Cas could almost tell what was coming. For a moment Cas thought he could see something in Deans eyes. A questioning glint but also a spark of desire.
“Not at all,” Cas' eyebrows narrowed, puzzled.
Also he knew no one. He could be anyone here. Or more importantly he could finally be himself. So he agreed to let one of the guys in his dorm bring him along to this party.
Dean pulled on jeans and a t, kneeling down to sit in front of Cas.
Dean played the part of boyfriend the best he could, he was actually pretty good at it. His charming smile and quick jokes had all of Castiel’s friends laughing and asking about him.
‘Can we just forget it?’ Dean moaned, his hands in Cas’s hair and Castiel’s body went cold.
‘I know what this is. I know you don’t want a relationship. Should I tell my friends we’re together?’
If not for his army training, Castiel would have been more cautious. You never knew these days who you might be going home with. But he knew he could defend himself, he almost wanted a basher to try him, he would soon leave them regretting their choice.
He leaned forward to press a harsh kiss onto Castiel’s lips as they stoked each other. Their knuckles brushing, over and over.
Breathless and still a bit dizzy from alcohol they steadied themselves upright.
By the end of October and into November, when Cas wasn't working they spent half their time in classes and the other half in bed with each other. A happy concoction of kisses and laughing and touching. Eventually every night rolled into one is Castiel's memory.
“Please?” Cas asked.
‘Dean.’
. His hand lingered on the handle until he finally opened the door and stepped forward.
Cas just shrugged and continued to enjoy it. However before the song had even finished they were both belting their hearts out. “... if I have to crawl upon the floor, come crashing through your door, baby I can't fight this feeling anymore!”
‘Go on,’ Dean chimed from beside him. And reluctantly Cas put down his glass and got up to join Balthazar.
They stayed like that, just watching one other. Dean finished another shot, his gaze barely faltering and the stranger took another sip, his eyes not leaving Dean.
‘Yeah, he’s one of my professors.’ Sam laughed. ‘Why?
There was blood on his Henley and on his knuckles like maybe he’d been in a fight.
.’ He laughed and Benny joined in.
. He knew though, that it was Sam's choice and he downed another tequila as he let his mind drift to Cas.
‘You don’t have to.’ Cas said, sitting up to find his underwear.
Cas didn't know a lot about cars but it was handsome and so... Dean.
A few days later he got a package. It was from Dean.
Dean shook his head. “REO Speedwagon?” he laughed, “Seriously?”
.’ Gordon said.
To hold his hand in the grocery store and kiss him out to dinner and stand in the pits, with his team and close friends and hold him so tightly when he stepped out of the car elated, another win under his belt.
‘You wanna get out of here?’ The tone was simple. It wasn’t sexy or sensual. It was as if he had asked Dean for the time.
He didn’t order anything else. The man took another sip of his drink and Dean finally said, ‘Hey.’ His voice low, his hands fiddling with a cocktail stick in front of him.
Silence again.
‘Is that
‘Who cares? You’ve won plenty. You’re prepared for this, Dean.’
“Well she's open, so hop in, we best get going.” Dean said, moving towards Cas and the driver’s door.
“Let’s go,” Cas said, taking Deans hand and turning towards the door.
Castiel didn’t follow motorsport. Occasionally, in passing, Dean would mention needing to be up early for a practice session or a race the following morning as he would leave Castiel’s. But even if Cas wanted to ask there was never the chance. Dean had made it clear he wanted to fuck first, talk never. And Castiel, as with everything else hadn’t pushed him.
“No... I want to.” He stared at the wall.
the more it pushed itself to the surface of his fantasies like a car gaining speed.
He nodded. And from the corner of his eye he watched the stranger finish his drink and get up from the bar.
He stood against the wall, drink in hand. Although he was alone he was kind of enjoying himself. Just watching people and the music was good. Eventually the alcohol would do its job and he was sure he'd get talking to some people. It was at this point he clocked a girl staring at him. He fidgeted, feeling a little uncomfortable. He could tell by her expression that she was more than interested. Cas felt almost guilty. It wasn't like that for him.
And that was how it began.
Castiel said nothing, just offered the scotch and when Dean shook his head he put it away. While he was facing the cupboard he said quietly, ‘That’s not an answer.’
Dean said nothing.
When he woke again it was dark,
The air seemed to catch in Dean's throat at this.
‘Wow.’ Was all Dean could say before-
‘I’m sorry Dean.’ Was all Cas said, his eyes wide, his deep frown boring into Dean.
The drive home was a silent one. Cas mostly slept as they drove through the night. Stopping only briefly in St Louis and then again in Nashville. Cas was glad to finally be alone with Dean again but he had so many questions.
‘Dean, let me reciprocate-’ Cas urged, moving his lips to Dean's neck but Dean shook him off.
‘Well I’ll be able to catch up now. Some of my professors are lending me their books that I can’t get from the library.’
Dean froze, his lips turned down. Cas thought he was going to cry. People moved and buzzed and laughed around them but they just stood there. Waiting…
He took another shift at the shop, he needed to busy his hands. Tweaking cars, fixing engines, that always soothed him. He made a note to find Bobby later and remind himself of the practice sessions and rallies they had discussed. Races that Dean could get good laps in and an easy win to ease himself back into the season.
‘Smart is smart.’ Dean tapped the wheel with his thumbs.
‘Ok, I think we’ve talked enough.’ Dean declared, and he pushed his lips down to Castiel’s open mouth, his words lost in a stifled moan.
. To go home and call Lisa or Jo but he didn’t.
Castiel let Dean lead. It was very clear that Dean knew what he wanted and Castiel just wanted to be wanted. He let Dean pull him toward the bed, before he turned and pushed him down onto it.
Breathless Dean shook off his jacket and plaid shirt beneath so his chest was just in a T-shirt that fit his torso well, hugging at the curve of his muscles.
‘Wait-’ was all Dean could say. His throat suddenly hoarse and letting in only trace amounts of air.
“Yeah,” Dean bit his lip. Dean was petrified. The last relationship he had had was with Joe. And this was so different.
He sent, and Cas got a reply almost immediately.
Dean laughed, kissing Cas’s check and thrusting himself against his hip.
And as if by some sudden change of heart he said, ‘Fuck. Cas. I’m sorry. I’m sorry.’ He stepped forward to reach for Cas but he stepped back. ‘I know. I’m so stupid. I accept your apology, of course I do. I shouldn’t have said that. I’m sorry-’
“We need to talk Castiel.” It wasn't menacing or scary. It was caring. She got up and walked out of the bathroom without looking back.
He flirted.
But there were moments he couldn't remember. And that pained him too. This was one of those memories. So important but yet blotched out by other memories. Slithers of gold that Cas held to for dear life and memories that hung over him like ash clouds, fogging all the rest.
Cas decided he didn't want to leave Meg alone so he took her back to her dorm. They actually lived in the same building; she was just two floors down. He sat in the corridor while she hurled in the bathroom and then tucked her up in bed with a glass of water.
Fuck.
‘Roll over.’ Dean said.
“Emily looks like our mother – they're both beautiful. She's older than me, and although she's out numbered, she's still tougher than me and my brother put together.” He breathed a laugh. “And Sammy well, he's four years younger than me so he'll always be my kid brother. But I’m sure he's making out to be taller than I am. I'm closer to him than Emily. My Dad used to take us out hunting a lot y'know, whenever he was home. Sam is still in high school but I know he's going to do well.” Dean kept his eyes on the road. Cas noticed how this whole thing, talking about yourself, seemed almost foreign to Dean. Which was sad because he loved his voice.
Cas frowned too, sad at the fact that he'd worried her. He could see the panic in her eyes as he had woken up, the same time in which she noticed that the blue flecks in his has faded. Expressions in each other they didn't recognise. “I'm sorry,” was all Cas said.
They laid side by side, Cas' curtains still open, watching the snow fall outside.
‘Dean you’re too drunk. Just stop.’
Cas didn't realise how often he used his hands for Dean and rather than sitting and fiddling with them he helped Mary out as much as he could. She protested but he wouldn't have it, and Ellen took a shine to him. When Dean introduced Cas to Bobby he liked him immediately. He seemed stern and sullen but once they got talking he was so sarcastic, Cas loved it. Commenting about how he had no idea how Dean got into college with a brain like his, the ‘idjit’. However at one point he overheard the pair talking like he had at Emily's. For some reason Bobby was warning Dean. Asking him what on earth he was doing and that if his dad found out he was going to need to get the hell out of dodge.
‘Hey.’ Sam bundled into the car. His long legs finding space to stretch. ‘Thanks for the ride.’
It was all of Cas' things neatly packaged, mailed back to him: clothes and music and books, photos of them both and Christmas cards.
He put the phone face down on the desk and put his face in his hands.
With every kiss Dean placed on Castiel’s body, he let out a little moan. Dean kissed his neck, his collarbone, even letting his tongue flick against Cas’s nipples. Each time Cas let out a little whimper, Dean's dick grew again and he thrusted against Castiel, still in his underwear and aching to have Dean on him, inside him, whatever he wanted.
“Okay,” Cas nodded, making Dean smile. Cas wished he'd said no, but it made Dean so happy. Dean pulled Cas into a hug, wrapping his huge arms around him. Eventually Cas pulled away. For some reason he wasn't in the best of moods. He knew it was probably due to him being jealous of that beautiful Joe girl, and Cas felt so tense about meeting more of Deans family. Would Joe be there too? And then of course there was the F word that made Cas feel sick to his stomach with the idea that Dean didn't feel the same way as he did. But how could he not? With everything he's said and done. Cas didn't like being so unsure all the time.
“Of me?” Dean asked. Cas shook his head.
thank you for reading!!! it is much appreciated! :D :D
Back at The Roadhouse, everyone piled Dean with shots and handshakes. Benny, another driver on their team had qualified too, just a few seconds behind Dean, and he, Charlie and Gordon were all playing some drinking game while they huddled around the Jukebox, filling it with change. Bobby and Rufus and the guys at the garage had worked so hard to get the car right. Their team was smaller than most, but they were a family and as Dean looked around at all the faces his heart felt somewhat empty,
In the week that had passed Cas was slowly coming to terms with the end of their relationship, and now here Dean was again. Wanting to act like nothing happened. Just so he could fuck Cas and leave?
They put on their coats. Dean washed back the last of his drink and rather badly balanced, navigated his was out of the place behind Cas. He stumbled as they walked out the door and Cas caught him, making the pair of them laugh and Dean almost fall over again. Cas put an arm around Deans waist, and Dean leant on Cas, putting his own arm around Cas' neck.
Cas sat on the edge of his bed, waiting for Dean to come out of the shower. He was jittery, and he felt like crying. But he had to do it.
Dean stood awkwardly in the entryway, unsure whether to follow Cas to the kitchen.
He walked back to his apartment numb. Where Meg nursed him like a broken bird. First there were tears, the sobbing, and the constant calling with no one picking up on the end of the line, then nothing. He couldn't eat, he couldn't sleep. He tore into his studio, picking up pieces. Some he left untouched, while the ones he painted while we was with Dean got the black paint, while others just got torn in the fray.
Cas shook his head. So yeah, maybe Dean's hand had found its way into Cas' underwear at one point, but besides making out, that was pretty much as far as they'd gone.
‘Dad was there. He’s getting better you know?’
He thought that if he just had an experience - one experience with one man - he could put all the wanting to bed. He could close the lid, tick the box that was homosexual activity and say he had been there, done it, and moved on.
“Hi... Dean isn't it?”
. Pictures of him with guitars or looking sulky as he donned headphones that were too big for him. Smiling as he sat in a field of a bed, wearing glasses. There were pictures of Emily too, and Sam. Cas smiled at how cute they looked. That was his past, and now Cas hoped he was his future.
Cas could hear rustling. “I miss you too,”
“It smells like you,” he blushed.
Did Dean want an address?
“Yeah,” he smiled; meeting his eyes again, those green eyes that would haunt him.
. He could feel himself blushing and then Sam was climbing into the car.
He checked the time. 1AM.
Why was he haunting him? After everything, after all this time. It slipped back to him in echoes and flashbacks. Everything crumbled around him again. He would lay there until morn.
Dean finally stepped back. His clothes were still around his ankles and he pulled off his boots and stepped out of them.
"Actually," Ellen corrected him, "Lupin sent an owl explaining about how he was having a tough time choosing between his family and here. So I said his family could come over too. The Potters and Lupin's son will be joining us as well."
Dean put his stuff away, placing Dr. Whoo on the empty seat across from the boy. The Winchester sat down next to his owl before facing the boy again. "I'm Dean Winchester. I'm a first year," he introduced himself.
"Yes," Aaron said after a moment, "that is some helpful information. If there isn't anything else, we should be on our way."
Castiel follows Dean through the trees, pushing past some branches that were in his way. When they made it out of the trees, Cas almost stopped in his tracks. There in front of them, was a wide river that was completely frozen over by thin ice. The ground was gently layered with old snow that made the frozen lake glisten.
The Winchester chuckles. "I won't disappear on you. Promise. That means I'll have to make a costume by tomorrow evening..." Dean thought to himself for a moment, trying to come out with some outfit he could make out of the clothes he already has. "What will you being going as, Cas?"
Dean was the first to speak.
He led the way out of the main room. Dean glanced over at Cas but the angel still acted a bit uncomfortable around him and didn't return Dean's look. Sam showed the pair to his room. Once there, he took out one of the many phones he has in his little phone collection. He opens up the phone and enters an app that doesn't look familiar.
"Good," Garth compliments. "Now, comes the tricky part. This is the part that I can't show you how to do." The professor pauses to make sure that Dean is ready for what he's about to say. "When you start off, it may be hard. But once you get a hang of it, you'll be great at it."
Also, it’s August 20th today, so happy birthday Misha Collins!
"Are you sure we should call Cas?"
Dean and Bobby stepped back from Cas. Bobby had to pull Dean back because the Winchester refused  to leave his friend's side.
Sam gave them a name and address.
Remus smiled. “Thanks. Truthfully, I don’t like them much, they bring too much attention to my face. And they don’t exactly match my eyes.”
You changed me too
The two mates worked on their school stuff together in the next few hours. They finished most all of their work, with very few things left undone. It wasn't until the doorbell rang that Dean and Cas took a break.
Cas and Dean stood watching from behind as Bobby conjured up a mattress for Cas to sleep on. It was late at night by now. Sam had made everyone watch this muggle movie that was actually pretty good in Cas' opinion. The two boys stood in their pajamas. Cas had his wings out and relaxed. Bobby didn't care, and Bobby's a Professor, so Cas trusts him.
The students follow Donna into the Great Hall. The Great Hall was filled with five tables. Four were vertical but the one in the front was horizontal. The one in the front was filled with adults, teachers. The other four were filled with students. The tables were decorated in different colored themes.
"They slept together," a quiet voice whispered.
However, before they could start to wait for their meals to arrive, Michael The Prefect came over to them. "Hey, guys, I'm really sorry to do this but it's a rule when there is a feast that all students must sit with their own houses. Sorry again."
Dean grins. "I'm glad. Are you excited for your first game as seeker?"
“Okay.”
Cas stepped aside, allowing Sam and Dean to leave the house. When the front door closed, Castiel started.
Charlie left the compartment but Dean stopped Cas before he could leave. Castiel looked at him, confused and tilted his head.
Dean turns to him. “Sure, Cas. I can help. Let’s see... how about you come over here and sit on the floor in front of me so I can easily reach your wings?” He suggests.
Eventually, Cas arrives at the Gates of Heaven. Right in front of the entrance, is a note being held down from the wind by a rock. Cas walks over and picks the note up, placing the rock off to the side.
With Cas' permission, Dean had explained to Bobby Cas' situation. Bobby took the information well and informed Cas that he would not have to hide his wings while at his house, though he could if he did not feel comfortable. Cas thanked him.
Slowly, more and more students poured into the Great Hall. Bobby left the kids alone early on and eventually left his shift.
After talking a deep breath, Cas decides to start his explaining.
Dean nods, even though Cas can’t see him. The Winchester continues to straighten out Cas’ feathers, Castiel occasionally humming in enjoyment. After a while, Dean finishes up and pulls his hands away.
Cas walks out of the classroom only to get scared shitless when Dean stepped out from behind him and greeted him. Dean laughs at him and Cas frowns.
The older Winchester brother looked to his side to see Castiel still sleeping peacefully. Dean's head turned and he looked at Sam with a 'don't you dare' look.
Dean froze in his place, seeing the boy. It wasn't until Dean felt a soft hand on his shoulder, that he raised his wand and cast the spell, looking away from the body of his younger brother. The boggart changed into a clown getting pied in the face. Dean turned to look at Cas, who had a sincere look on his face. Dean stepped out of line and wordlessly walked to the back of the line.
The charms Professor smiles. "Well, consider me excited and nervous to have you in my class. You seem like someone who could either get into a lot of trouble or will be a really well-behaved student. Or maybe both."
Right now, Cas and Dean sat on their beanbags, chatting about how they would be spending the vacation. Dean was really excited about introducing Cas to Sam, he had a feeling his best friend and brother would get along.
Sam looked awestruck at Cas' wings. "Those are so cool!" Sam says after a moment. "Can I touch them?"
Gabriel and Castiel thanked her, payed and then went to wait for their drinks and pastry.
A scrawny-looking man that stood about six feet tall, stood over the students. He called out over the large crowd of students. "First years, first years this way!" Dean and Cas looked at each other before going over to the man and following him with a group of other first year students.
Dean walked through the halls of Hogwarts with his new friends. Charlie was talking on and on to Cas about his new Quidditch position and Cas was quietly listening to her ramble. Meg had run off with Maze and a couple other Slytherin girls after lunch was finished, so it was just the three of them.
Currently Cas sat outside. It was now early spring and the weather was beginning to feel warm again. The final games of Quidditch were coming up soon and Hufflepuff was going to be going up against Gryffindor. Ravenclaw and Slytherin would be competing, whoever won that game would face whoever wins the Hufflepuff/Gryffindor game.
"Did you two have fun?" Ellen asks when the two boys walk into the kitchen.
This one took a lot of thinking. Finally, Cas remembers the first time he smiled around Dean. The two of them had been sitting at a playground. And Cas is lucky enough to remember exactly where that playground is located.
"Hello," they greeted. "My name is Quil and I will be your waiter today. Have you thought of your drinks already or do you need some more time to decide?"
When the majority of students had finished their meal, the food was replaced with dessert. And, oh wow, was there a lot of dessert. There were candy apples, bowls of candy bars, cupcakes, cake, crumbed Oreo that was in the design of a graveyard (some people call this dessert 'dirt' because of its appearance), candy corn stuck into chocolate pudding, chocolate-dipped marshmallows, triple mousse chocolate cake, cookies, and so much more. It all looked wonderful. And tasted even better.
Castiel finally arrived at the owlery. He grabbed a piece of paper that was waiting for students to take, as well as a ink-lasting quill. With the quill, Cas wrote a letter to his family at home.
Young and painfully
Sam obeys and looks up the people who have recently gone to jail for killing someone and were sent to jail after the police were called by the partner of the one killed. There were seven people who had gone to jail for that. But there was no way of telling who was affected by Freyja and who wasn't.
"Stop apologizing. It's what any of us would do," Dean assures him. If Dean had only been able to  do the same for Cas, this reunion would have happened a lot sooner. "Besides, I should be sorry. I let you rot in that place for so long."
Cas glanced at Dean, a frown on his face. Dean had a similar on his own expression.
Dean and Cas stood up quickly followed by Sam. The three boys followed Sam into the kitchen where Ellen was using magic to set up the pie making. Ellen smiled softly at the boys when they entered understanding what they had just been asked about, while also knowing this would probably cheer them up.
But sure enough, you did come into sight
Inside of the library, thousands of old books were out for borrowing. Gabriel looked around at the grand showing. There were so many books and all the decorations around the room looked expensively beautiful. Some of the books were in newer shape, while others were much ancient.
Celebration for the Huffmepuffs started immediately after the game finished. They had a chance to win the house Quidditch cup! It was a night full of drinks and foods from the kitchen. It was the first time Castiel stayed late up in the Hufflepuff common room. Somewhere after midnight, Cas left the common room and went to meet up with Dean. Only to find Dean wasn't there. Frowning, Castiel went into the hidden room and curled up on the cushion, wrapping his wings around him as he fell asleep alone.
The elder Winchester looked at the figure who stood at the door. It was Castiel, in his trench-coat  and everything. The angel had somewhat of a worried look on his face and he didn't dare look at Dean.
Castiel nodded, not saying anything in response. Maze looked at Castiel for a moment before looking over Dean and Charlie. She hummed when she looked over Dean. "Not a bad choice of friends, but I have to say, you could've done better."
Gabriel had some of his candy with him and was sharing with Sam. They sat in a comfortable silence. The two of them had become good friends in the time Gabriel was visiting with his brother. Gabe was glad to know someone like Sam who would be going to school with him. Sure, there were times when his older brothers would bring their friends over and their friends had younger siblings his age. But Gabriel never really liked any of them. They were all bitchy. So it was nice to have Sam as a friend.
The pure-blood got some breakfast and left the Great Hall rather quickly. He made his way back through the halls of Hogwarts, trying to find the charms classroom. It didn't take Cas much time to find the classroom.
Knowing it was probably going to be a yes, Dean made his way back over to his friends. The friend group made their way outside. They found a nice set of grass and sat down. Before long, Cas joined them. The group talked and talked, playing a few muggle games to pass the time.
The year was almost coming to an end, but there was still one thing that needed dealing with. There were still the end of the year exams to do. Castiel was not at all excited for this. No one was. Even Charlie looked tired from all the studying, and that was saying a lot.
"Oh." A grin spread on Jo's face like she was about to talk about something she was really passionate about. "Code 9-18. It's basically our way of telling the other workers that we find one of the customers hot. No idea why it started, but it just started happening one day and it stuck," she explains.
You chose to fall in love with a human,
Stay tuned for Angel Within Hogwarts (Year 2-3)!!
Even in the dark, Charlie and everyone else could tell Dean was blushing.
Sam, however, is standing by the stairs. Miracle, the dog Dean had adopted, had a leash wrapped around his neck. When Miracle sees Dean and Cas appear, he runs forward, yanking the leash that Sam had been holding right out of the Winchester's hand. Sam shakes his hand out, the leash having left a rope burn-like mark from being pulled out of his hand so quickly.
Jody chuckles a bit. "You had some breakfast, right? I don't want you skipping any meals now." Jody had a mother vibe to her and Castiel didn't mind it, having not really having a mother figure in his life.
So... it is currently Saturday, November 7th, 2020. Despair, 15x18, came out three days ago. And when I tell you I sobbed when *it* happened, I mean I SOBBED violently.
Jody smiles and gets back to preparing for her first class of the day. "Every year at Hogwarts is an adventure. There's always something exciting and most of the time dangerous going on. You can't have a bunch of magically advance kids in one place without there being danger."
Sam looked torn about this idea. "I don't know, guys. By changing the timeline we could be making things a lot worse."
Dean smiled and each of the other four boys smiled back at him. There wasn't much conversation as each of the boys unpacked their things and one by one, got into bed. John and Amendiel talked wizard stuff and Poe tried flirting with Finn while Dean watched with an amused look as Finn had no clue what Poe was trying to get across.
With his things ready, Castiel made his way over to the common room before leaving the Hufflepuffs' shared room to go get some breakfast.
Loyal to those above you in power
"Oops," Charlie whispered quietly. The witch was biting her lip. She felt had. She had been the one who forced Dean to kiss Cas without thinking of how Cas might react.
Cas laughs quietly at his brother, already knowing where this will be going.
"Perhaps. But you know me, sis, I'm a good actor. The stupid angel will just fly by it without a single question and not even give it a thought. He'll probably assume it was from Jack absorbing all that power," Chuck responds.
Cas and Dean both nod. "It is. Was the killer caught?"
Cas nods. "Yeah, we should probably go back and warm up some."
Lupin listened to Castiel's rant. "If it is really bothering you, I can get the headmistress and ask for a private room?" He suggested when Cas took a breath.
The professor walked rather speedily through the halls of Hogwarts. He eventually made it to the outside. Briefly, he checked the sky. He already knew the full moon didn't come for a couple more weeks, but he had to look.
Cas smiles, "our profound bond."
Meg bit her lip. "Sorry, Maze. Guys, this is Mazikeen Smith, she's a second year. Maze, this is Dean Winchester, Charlie Bradbury and Castiel Novak."
Remus looks over at Dean, “does he now?”
Dean takes Cas’ hand in a friendly, no-homo way and they walk back to the party together. They find Charlie at the food table (there’s even more Halloween sweets at the party! Ft. A very happy Charlie). The red-head glances at their connected hands and smiles at the two of them.
"So you know about my brother's secret?" Gabriel asked, finally bringing up the subject that hadn't left his mind.
"No," Bobby responds. "We'll get your Professor Fitzgerald over here. If anyone would know how to help Novak, it's him." Bobby raised his wand. A Rottweiler patronus appeared. "Garth- we have Castiel Novak here, injured one of his wings. Could use the help." Bobby gave his patronus a message and the white, shining ghost of a dog disappeared.
“Leave them alone, Ishim,” a voice says.
"You'll do great," Dean assures him. "Whether you win or loose."
Like Garth had said, the boats started moving on their own. The boats slides smoothly across the lake. The boats turned a corner and multiple students gasped.
Dean and Cas met up with their friends and walked together towards the Great Hall. When they arrived at the Great Hall, they noticed that it was far more decorated than the night before.
“I’m doing good, I think. I haven’t met the Potter family before, but Bobby talks a lot about them. So does Ellen,” Dean answers.
Lisa thinks for a second. "Herbology, History of Magic, Transfiguration, and Flying," Lisa answers. She looks at Dean, "what about you?"
The pair of boys arrived outside and just like Cas had said, Charlie was outside talking to a brown-haired girl and they seemed rather close already. They walked up to Charlie and Dorothy and sat down. When they arrived, Dorothy looked up at them, before making some excuse and leaving. Apparently she didn't want to talk to Dean or Cas.
The deva looked back on his first year at Hogwarts and sighed to himself. What a year it had been. And he knew that he had a bunch of adventures still yet to be experienced while at Hogwarts.
Professor Mills called up a few more students before saying the name "Charlie Bradbury". Charlie walked over to the stool, visibly excited. The sorting hat was placed on her head. However, the hat stayed quiet, not calling out a house just yet. After about six minutes of absolute silence (Charlie getting more and more anxious by the moment) the hat called out "HUFFLEPUFF".
"Oh, another Novak. Except, this ones different from the other two. Shy and- oh! Loyal. So very loyal. You'd risk everything for the ones you care about, wouldn't you? Over and over again until you have nothing left. But you would do it all for them. And oh, dear, you have a secret, don't you?" The hat whispered in Castiel's ear. The mention of a secret made the pure-blood tense up. "Right, right. Now, I've seen many secrets in my time at Hogwarts. Even your professor Lupin has a secret similar to yours. But it's not quite the same, is it?" The hat chuckled. "Well, then. I believe you will do best in... HUFFLEPUFF."
Once on the train, Bobby quickly separated from Dean and made his way over to the teachers' section of the train.
"Mount your brooms," Madam Hooch commanded.
As tears of happiness filled your eyes
(See the end of the chapter for
Sammy smiles at that. "And you and Cas will be an amazing official couple."
Cas was gripping the sleeves of his trench coat tightly, in fists. His jaw was clenched and he was still on obvious pain.
Rowena called on Castiel, "yes, dear?"
And then there was Gabriel, Anna and Balthazar's mother, and the other boys' step-mom. Her name's Jewell and she's just as bad as Chuck. Jewell Novak was almost never around. When she was around, she never talked to her children. Instead, she would just go up to Chuck's room and drink herself drunk with him and then leave early the next morning.
"Well, I would hope so," Gabe muttered to his plate.
"I told you that a few teachers would be coming over, right?" Bobby asked, directing his question at Castiel.
(Castiel's wand)
"The game doesn't start until after lunch. What are your plans for the first half of day?" Dean asks, deciding to make some conversation while they travelled along the ever changing staircases.
A large castle stood there. The castle was beautiful and had multiple lights from inside. The boats moved slowly towards it. Most students stayed silent, taking in the sight of the beautiful school. A few others were whispering amongst themselves.
Bobby and Ellen greet Gabe, he says hello back.
Out loud, "Jack" speaks to Castiel. "No. Quite the opposite, actually. I called you here because I think it's better if you let him be. He only died a month after you, I bet he's still healing from your departure. It's best if you keep your distance for now. Keep working on making sure our new Heaven is working correctly."
The game goes on as Cas watches and tries to spot the snitch. A few times, a random bludger would chase after him but he would be saved by either Rivera or Carlson, the other beater.
Charlie hummed when she saw all of the different sweets. "Oh I'm going to gain so much weight by the end of this year," she said, shaking her head and digging in to a chocolate cupcake.
It was Dean. Of course it was Dean.
“Amara?”
The Bunker seemed quiet. Dean sat in the map room with a drink in his hand. His chin rested in his free hand and he was half asleep. Dean jolted up when he heard the Bunker's door open. He almost spilled his beer over his flannel as he looked to see who it was.
The kids got to work, following Ellen's instructions and making sure to have the right measurement of ingredients. Before long, the apple infested pie was put into the oven to cook. Ellen had succeeded in distracting her boys.
She was pregnant and tried while running away from some man she didn't even see in the middle of the night. Vicky was due in less than a month, and all she wanted to do was make sure her child was born safely.
The snow wasn't the easy to throw, but that made it more challenging and fun.
You left midway through a song,
Gabe nods, “yup. Ran off as quickly as he could. It was almost like he couldn’t stand to be around me for another minute.” Gabe laughs.
“Right now, I’m asking you for one thing. I know it is unfair because of what has happened in the last day or so, but I still think I should ask. I want you to try to be brave enough to talk to someone. Talk about your thoughts and your life, the good parts and the bad parts. Castiel, what I’m asking you to do, is trust someone. There’s a good chance that this person will listen and care. All you have to do is try.”
Lupin clapped, "good job! Next!" He called the next student up. "Go ahead, James. It can't hurt you if you do spell."
The Potters were introduced to everyone and everyone was introduced to the Potters. Sam, Gabe and the twins had come upstairs from Sam’s bedroom by now to see what all the fuss was about.
Jody started to call names. The first student called up was Millie Abbott. Millie went up and sat down on the wooden stool. Jody placed the old hat down on her head and a split second later, the hat yelled out "RAVENCLAW", causing many of the first year students to jump.
The inside is neat and cozy. Moving pictures of Sam, Dean, Bobby and Ellen line the halls. Both Novaks looked at each picture as they passed. Gabriel makes a few jokes, commenting on pictures of toddler Sam.
Cas and Dean sat in Dean's room. They sat on the mattress together. Cas' Back was turned to Dean and the Winchester was cleaning his wings when a small frown forms on Dean's lips as he notices something he probably should have noticed before.
-        //A/N: did I make that part just for the bottom/top thing? Maybe..\\
Once breakfast was finished, Cas excused himself to go to the owlery. The others said it was fine and that Cas could meet up with them outside on the school lawn.
Ishim, Cas and Dean all turn to see Professor Lupin standing there, with a nasty look on his face. “Five points from Slytherin.” Lupin says, eyeing Ishim.
Cas sat still, gripping the side of the chair he was sitting on and waiting for his wing to be healed. He should never have tried to fly again. He knew something like this was going to happen, yet he did it anyway. Cas went up there and he grew confident and cocky, only to let that make a fool out of himself. And he didn't feel like flying again for a long time. So now he was sitting on a chair, silently waiting for Dean to figure out whatever Garth was trying to teach him.
The elder Winchester stilled to a quick stop when the screen changed. The tv screen now had all three members of Team Free Will’s attention.
"You get off watching other people sleep?" Cas asks, smiling tiredly up at Dean.
However, on the way over to Baby, something happened. Dean blinked and he and Cas were not in the street, instead they were in some sort of abandoned building. "Was that you?" Dean asked, looking over to the angel.
Theme: crush (destiel.fanfiction November One-Shot Contest)
"Oh yeah? What's your brother like?" Charlie asks.
Before we start the book, this chapter will consist over the “cast”, the cast is for the main students to give an idea of what the canonical characters would look like if they were younger. This is only to give an idea, the facial features as well as other features of these “cast members” will not effect the story. I will be use the features from the canonical cast.
"Good luck," Dean said softly, with a kind smile.
Amara shakes her head. "I think you underestimate your son, brother. Castiel is practically a Winchester, after all."
There are a few seconds where Castiel doesn't answer. "The man in the corner, the one who I code 9-18'd. His name is Dean Winchester."
So, Dean travelled through the halls of Hogwarts on a journey to find his friends. It was only then did Dean realize how big the whole school actually was. There were so many places to hide and to visit, the options were endless and the magic was non-stop.
Dean nods, "of course."
The Winchester finished up writing his letter. He looked over his work and nodded, satisfied. Amendiel watched from his bed as Dean rushed out of the room.
"Dean!" A small voice calls over the crowd.
Dean walked over to them. "Hey, Charlie, Cas. Nice costumes." He eyed Cas' wings.
“Gabriel and I are staying here the whole vacation,” Cas answers.
The fallen angel's head tilts in confusion. What are these numbers and why was he given them?
"Did it go well?" , "I didn't see you give him your number.", "Think he's interested in you?", were all questions asked. But instead of answering them right away, Castiel asked Gabriel to speak with him privately. The archangel, in response, gave a nod and excused himself and his brother from the group.
Dean chuckled. "Yeah, she's likely upset about that. I wouldn't be surprised if she went to the teacher 'my friends been murdered! My friend's been murdered!'" He laughs, shaking his head a bit.
About six months passed of the two angels working at the small coffee shop in Wayward Road. Ellen was nice enough to get the pair a small apartment that they could stay in until they could afford one of their own. Castiel and Gabriel had explained their situation- without mentioning the angel part and with minimal detail- when Ellen asked them about where they were staying.
The two boys looked up when Castiel entered the room. Cas walked over to the third and last bed where his stuff was already set down. The boy who had claimed the middle bed smiled at Castiel.
Donna nods. "Well, I'll let you two get back to your classes." Donna leaves them be and Castiel goes back to his flying lessons and to Dean, while Dan goes back over to his class.
Dean leaned over to Cas when Sam started to talk with Gabe. “I was going to tell him, I just didn’t get the chance. Either Bobby or I will tell him on the way home.”
The next morning, Poe jabbed a finger into Dean's shoulder, causing the Winchester to jump up, suddenly awake. Amenediel and Poe both laughed at his reaction while Dean sent them glares.
"Dean, no."
The beverages and pastry that they split between themselves wasn't much. But it was enough for now. It was enough to get them through however many days to come until they could get food again.
"Netting, Tessa"
Dan, the Quidditch Captain from before, came over to their small group. "Castiel, are you ready to go over the rules?" He asks Cas.
After a bit of walking, Dean and Lisa arrived at the Great Hall. Loads of the other students were arriving around the same time they were. The tables were already filling up with kids and the teacher table was already full.
There was a knock on the door that startled Dean. He looked up to see Gabriel, with a lotion bottle in his hand. "Er, is Cassie in here?" He asks Dean.
When Cas Caen to and realized the pair of boys weren't alone, he instinctively jumped back in his beanbag chair, his wings being pulled against his back before disappearing. Dean made note to ask Cas how exactly he did that. Dean was still new to the whole wing thing.
After about ten or minutes, the boats arrived at the other side of the lake. Garth ordered the students to get out of the boats and they obeyed. Garth led the students up to the school. Once inside the school, Garth introduced the students to another teacher.
“It’s okay, Professor. He knows,” Cas says simply.
Cas let his angel blade fall from his sleeve. The angel looked at the sharp edge with enchanted eyes. He turned the blade, pointing it at himself, towards his chest. The angel closes his eyes, ready to stab the blade into his chest, ending all the pain, the emotion and the feelings. Cas stretches out his arms and starts to move the angel blade toward his vessel.
Almost hesitantly, Dean and Cas make their ways over to their younger brothers. Sam and Gabe have probably already looked over all the gifts and spotted which ones belonged to them and which ones didn't.
So Cas tried again. "That spell is used for turning people into devas. Devas have a human appearance except for the wings on their back."
Dean frowned. "Do you want to talk about it?" He asks slowly.
Just to make this clear, Dean and Cas are not officially dating. In my opinion, 11 is a bit young to date so everything they do (the hand holding, the comforting after a nightmare, the going off alone together) is all platonic and in a friend way. But don't worry, that will change soon!
"Yes, Dean?"
The fallen angel walks over to his hunter. Silently, Cas looks Dean over his head tilting slightly as he does. Cas saw what everyone else saw. That Dean was broken. But Cas could do something no one else could. He could fix Dean, fix the hole in his heart. Castiel looks at Dean for a few moments longer before doing what Dean usually does and pulling the hunter into a hug.
"You've been in the air before today?" Madam Hooch asks him.
Castiel walked alone through the halls of Hogwarts. He had a pretty good memory so it was easy for him to get to the Great Hall for some food to start the long day ahead of him. He found himself quickly surrounded by other incoming students on his way to the Great Hall.
"She was," Dean agrees.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Wow," Harry breathed out. And the Potter thought loosing his Godfather was bad, try loosing a lover and a to-be fiancé.
Once she was done and all the students had their brooms in hand, the teacher told the students to mount their brooms. She informed them to stay close to the top of their brooms, but not too close.
There's a pause. Gabriel gives Castiel a look that translated to something of 'so what exactly did you want to talk about'.
Charlie huffed. She quickly changed the subject, though. "Dorothy was telling me about this house sleepover thing where we all can go into the Great Hall and apparently there are sleeping bags laid out for us to sleep in. And it sounds fun. Would you guys be down to joining?"
pie). Ellen took the pie out of the oven. With a wave of her wand, Ellen made she that the pie was cool enough to eat before allowing the kids to each take a slice.
Dean chuckles humorlessly. "Well, I have a younger brother. His name is Sam. Though he's out in college. Harvard Law School. The kid's really smart. My father and I work in the family buisness but we travel around a lot so we don't usually stay in one place for a long time. But he recently found someone he likes, some woman who lives around here. So we rented a house and we're staying around here for a while."
The adults in this have the same portrayer as the ones in the show
Cas let out a small groan of pain. Usually, he would have to let his wings out four times a day, he would keep them out all the time at home. But here at school, he couldn't. It had been something close to 48 hours and Cas had only let his wings out once before now. It seems that not letting his wings out to stretch at least four times, caused pain. And lots of it.
"The curse, it was 'facti sant cherubi', it's the curse one would use if they wanted to curse someone into becoming a monster." His voice cracked slightly. "Dean... the spell turned me into this. A monster."
"Would the Edleberry Lake be frozen over?" Dean asks.
Charlie stands up. "C'mon, you've got a Quidditch match you need to practice for." She extends her hand and Cas takes it and stands up with her help. The pair of friends journey away from the front of the castle over to the Quidditch field. There, Castiel gets out his Quidditch outfit and his broom.
"Hello, Dean," Jack greets.
The Winchester chuckles and playfully hits Castiel's arm. Dean gets up off of the blow-up mattress. The two boys had been sleeping on that since Dean's bed wasn't quite big enough to hold the two of them. "Come on," Dean said, "it's Christmas Eve and Bobby invited most of the Hogwarts staff to come over to celebrate." Dean stretched out a hand to Cas and helped pulled the pure-blood onto his feet.
“Usually, we aren’t. But it does happen occasionally.”
The next morning, Cas woke up with Dean's arms around him. The deva's face went dark pink as he remembered the events of last night, as well as his nightmare. He had dreamed about his mother, when she (technically Cas himself) got cursed. Dean woke up shortly after Cas and smiled softly at the other.
Dean barely even noticed Cas was more human that he was supposed to be. Neither did Sam, but he and Sam weren't that close.
Curious, Cas walks over to the note and takes it down. He reads through the note after seeing that its Dean's handwriting.
Cas looks down at the man. This guy was shorter than him. "Yes, I am," the angel responds.
Charlie catches up to them. She had a sweater on. The sweater had a muggle roleplaying logo in the middle of it, Charlie wore it proudly even though most students had no idea what the logo was from.
Cas couldn’t help but feel his wings flutter each time Dean laughed. And who knows? Maybe Dean will be the first person Cas will truly trust.
Yes, Jody and Donna are together. Sorry not sorry.
With Lupin gone, Dean sat Cas down at one of the desks and pulled a chair up for himself to sit in. The two of them sat silently, Castiel with his eyes on the floor. After a few minutes, Dean decided he should try to find out if Cas wanted to talk about it or not. Dean moved so he could catch Cas' eye.
The last class of the day came along rather quickly. It was History of Magic with Professor Singer. Bobby had a few decorations up in his classroom, but not nearly as many as everyone else's classes.
Castiel and Dean teamed up and went over to the corner of the field to practice together. The two of them got onto their own brooms and flew up into the air. They raced each other higher and higher into the air.
Secondly, I want to thank everyone who helped to create Supernatural. In particular, Misha Collins. Like so many others, Castiel has been my favorite character. He's a comfort character and just a wonderfully created part of the story. Misha did an absolute incredible job as Cas and I'm so glad I got to see his performance as this character. Thank you everyone who created SPN and thank you Misha.
Dean nods, frowning at the way Cas' father used to treat Cas. Dean would probably never get over the fact that abuse was the way Cas grew up.
"CAS!" Dean shook his friend's shoulders.
Castiel responds almost instantly. "It's a month after Dean's death."
"Please don't do that again. I can't loose you too. You're supposed to always be there, you're supposed to be the one who never leaves. Please don't leave me." Dean's voice breaks.
Gabriel hits Jo's arm to tell her to quiet down. "Shush!"
"Good. Now, everyone get into a line and we'll start. Remember, it isn't real and everyone has their fears," Lupin reminds them as the students shuffle to get into a straight line.
Dean glanced over at Cas when the other boy had started to move.
"Well, during my sorting, the sorting hat mentioned you," Castiel starts.
Eventually, the day of the game came. It was Gryffindor against Hufflepuff. Cas was, honestly, worried for this game. Dean was there outside the Hufflepuff changing room- Lisa by his side- to wish him luck before his game.
Castiel gathered his clothes and quickly left the shared dorm room to go to the even more shared bathroom so he could change. Cas didn't really feel comfortable changing in front of other people, so he went to change privately into his Hufflepuff school uniform.
You will be taken
Cas went to the common room with everyone else (of course, after briefly stopping and thanking the house elves for such a good meal). He told Charlie "see you in a bit" before going up to his room to get ready. In his room already, Adam and Benny were getting ready. It would seem that they were going too. The pair of them helped each other out with their costumes while Cas went over to his clothes and got out his trench-coat.
The deva doesn't respond. He doesn't know how to.
A warrior of Heaven
Castiel felt his stomach drop. He had lost. Worse, he had let down his whole house. The Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw team flew down to the ground.
Ellen comes out from her hidden office and gives a small laugh at the childlike behavior of her workers. "I'm sorry to tell you this, Castiel. But it's mandatory that the first code 9-18 you get, you have to go over and give that person you're number."
Cas had no idea what was going on. But whatever was happening, it was bad. And painful. So very painful.
Dean nods and goes over to one of the beanbags and sits down on it. “Whoa, these are way more comfortable than I thought they would be!” He exclaims, smiling. “These don’t feel like they’re that old.”
Castiel pulled his coffee shop uniform vest off and put on his trench-coat. His trench-coat is much more comfortable than the green vest he has to wear that has the "Harvelle's RoadHouse Coffee" logo on it.
For a moment, Castiel thought to how his brothers were celebrating the holidays. There were probably watching a couple Christmas movies and trying- and failing- to make muggle sugar cookies without magic. The Novaks were definitely not having a big feast like this. It was likely that the Novak siblings were just spending the holiday break by themselves and not seeing any of their friends. The Novaks didn’t really have any other family. Vicky Novak was an only child and both her parents were dead. Chuck Novak’s family was even worse than Chuck himself. Besides Auntie Amara, but AuntIe Amara was always somewhere else.
When the trio arrived at the Hogwarts Express, the train was just as amazing as it had been when they first stepped foot upon it.
Dean walked through the train halls, trying to find an empty compartment to sit in. He traveled with three suit cases and a brown owl whom Dean had gotten for his eleventh birthday that Dean called 'Dr. Whoo' per Sam's request, so Dean could have a reminder of Sam when he's gone.
A sacrifice you decided to make
“It looks like the Slytherin beater, Jackson, is aiming for Dan. He hits the bludger towards Espinoza but he doesn’t see it. Lucky for him, the Hufflepuff beater steps in just in time. Nice job, Rivera!”
It was nine o'clock in the morning, so there was about three hours until Lupin would show up.
Dan shrugged and let him be.
While being harassed by his father to be the best?
//MORE GARTH\\
Still daddy’s little soldier,
Castiel woke up later that morning to feel that the pain hadn’t gone away. In fact, it had gotten worse, just like Garth had said.
Anna nods her small little head.
"I'm afraid that won't be helpful. Once Chuck realizes we're gone, he could easily come and interrogate everyone who knows where we are going and why you are leaving," Cas explains. "I wish you could give them an explanation and I wish this wasn't happening, but it's just not something you can do."
Sam didn't have much news to offer them. The information on if Freyja was killable was hard to find. And there wasn't a way to reverse the spell Freyja puts on people. That news made Dean a bit worried.
Cas opened his eyes as Dean pulled away. Cas was still unsure of what to make of the moment. He looked down at his feet awkwardly, but a small smile played on his lips. Dean put a finger under Cas' chin, and lifted it so their eyes met.
That Dean would smile and be happy to see him and tell him he didn’t need to worry and that all he needed was kisses from Cas and he’d feel better?
“Yeah, I just... I changed my dorm room. I thought it would be easier for us.”
‘It’s ok.’
“I can't really sleep...” Dean said.
It was still exciting, the way Dean would show up in a flash, and have Cas hard and moaning in seconds, moving like the world was going to end. It was still so fucking fun and hot and Castiel could keep it up for a while.
‘What? No!’ Dean shook his head. ‘Shit.’ He moved more into the office but still kept Castiel’s desk between them.
Castiel had planned a quiet evening of more reading and a relaxing shower before bed. He wasn’t expecting guests. He quickly finished tidying the kitchen and flipped up his phone again.
‘It’s not your business anyway.’ Charlie said as she got back under another car and as Bobby came in to speak to Gordon about something the conversation was over.
Dean rubbed his cock against Castiel’s bare ass, it
The dark haired man took another sip and looked up towards the dance floor, not noticing Dean's heavy gaze. He couldn’t have been much older than Dean, but his permanent frown made it harder to judge.
‘But I did it Cas. I fucking qualified, I’m a fucking pro now.’ His voice was tinged with a hint of anger.
“Dean. Come back to me-”
A week or perhaps two later, he saw him again. A part of Cas wished that he couldn't remember any of it, because whenever he did it washed over him again. Not like a projector just playing the events back in his mind, but a wave. A wave that brought not just the images but the thoughts and the smells and tastes and memories and if Cas wasn't in bed (which was what he did mostly now a days) the moment would rush back to him, and just for a brief second, the same second just as he woke up in the mornings, he would forget. Forgot that then wasn't now, and it would take his legs from under him.
He picked it up to show to Dean. “Is this my scarf?”
‘What was that?’ Dean asked, continuing to massage the head of Cas’s dick under his thumb.
Dean sighed at the other end of the line. He cleared his throat.
‘Cas!’ Dean yelled and Cas pulled on a sweater and rushed downstairs to find a drunk Dean, dark circles under his eyes, gripping the bottle of whiskey Cas kept in for him.
‘Dean-’
Then Castiel groped at Dean's jeans, hoping he would let Castiel finish what they had started the last time they were together.
He rubbed hard at the tears which streamed from his eyes. Swallowing back sobs the best he could.
. He didn’t think he could deal with the blazing light that had come through the windows earlier. His headache was more dull and he was suddenly starving.
But Cas had no place in Dean’s life.
This fic was HEAVILY inspired by the songs:
He heard the bell of the door open and close and slipped his phone back in his pocket. When he looked up, there he was. Plaid shirt guy. Only this time he wore a dark shirt with something like another shirt over that and then a leather jacket. He remembered layers. And something he hadn't noticed before, a small faded pendant that hung around his neck. He gave Cas a smile with all teeth which made him nervous again. Cas knew he had an odd voice but he didn't want to sound like he was reading from a script to this guy. That’s if they actually did speak and Cas hoped he wouldn't just order coffee and go.
But when they were together, just the two of them alone it was as though everything else washed away. There were no labels or declarations just clean slates. And above all Dean had promised he wouldn't hurt Cas. Cas turned away from Dean's confused expression and the pair stood in silence until Castiel noticed something red poking out of Dean's bedside drawer.
“Hey I've been meaning to ask you,” Dean said. “What are you doing for thanksgiving?”
He had been restless all night. His dreams of qualifying on pole were peppered with glimpses of skin and the feel of fingers on his hips in the back seat of his Impala.
“You saved me Clarence,” she gave a hazy smile; a little tired, a little drunk. And then she was out. Cas chuckled, he wasn't sure why she had called him Clarence. Perhaps she had it confused with Cas? Later on she would explain to him that Clarence was the name of an angel in her favourite Christmas movie, and that she thought he had the face of an angel, but more importantly, he acted like an angel to her that night and somehow she made some connection.
John was beaming. He came to races when he could. He would smile and pat Dean on the shoulder, but this time he pulled Dean into the roughest hug and held him so tightly that Dean forgot for a moment it was his own father.
“He's... just so smart. Not like me,” Dean blushed. He cleared his throat. “What are your brothers like?”
Cas laughed.
‘Dean, I'm fine.’
“Why do I have to tell you? Haven't I shown you? You've met my entire family for Christ's sakes,”
But he had done it. Reached out to find the lube he kept in his car and coated both their hands with it.
Cas sat up, leaning himself on his elbow. “Dean...”
‘Who? Professor Novak?’
And Cas was hit once again with the truth that they actually had a relationship, even an almost healthy one that only existed within the confines of his walls.
He stood up properly so that they were face to face and their eyes met in the dark.
‘Who is your brother?’
It was as though their bodies moved as one. It was a little painful at first for Cas. But after a while it was good, and then
“Anywhere!” Dean was quite breathless at this point and he broke away from Cas to stand still for a moment. Cas turned to look back at him, a little breathless himself. He stepped forward to help him forward again.
When Dean came he couldn’t bring himself to move. Instead he let the tight nerves that had formed in his muscles since he saw Castiel yesterday, dissipate until he fell asleep.
‘You’ve done it Dean.’ Her voice was steady. ‘You're over the line and in the time.’
Cas turned on a lamp and watched him, the huge grin lit up his face. Dean didn’t smile enough around Cas. Castiel knew he was always having a good time but he hardly smiled, hardly laughed.
‘It’s not a problem Sammy-’
His glass was empty and he had energy to burn. Perhaps a gay club wasn’t the best place to pick someone up, especially as he only had experience with women but if he was being totally honest, he was bored. The girls were great but it never worked and as much as he tried not to think about the other side of himself, the side that whispered,
‘Sam.’ Castiel gave a small smile. ‘How are you?’
That green, those lashes, his teeth biting down hard on his bottom lip and Cas was gone too. His hand still tugging until Castiel’s back arched up from the seat and he moaned into a kiss, their lips pressing together fast.
But not this time.
The name on the screen hit him like a bullet in the back:
As soon as Dean was in the car he was racing. His foot pressed the gas a little too hard, and the speedometer ticked just over the speed limit. But he didn’t want to stop, weaving in and out of cars to get to his street.
It had always been Dean, to show up at his house, his office, to peruse him. Dean took what he wanted and maybe Cas shouldn’t have stopped him.
Cas shook his head, a tired smile on his face. ‘Not tonight.’
They mostly pulled off their own pants, what with the car being small and romantically undressing their partner wasn’t what either man was going for. Dean pushed up his shirt and moved his lips down the man's stomach, relishing every moan as his tongue travelled down the skin.
“Where?”
Dean swallowed. “I am I just-”
“Don't worry about it,” Dean said. “I'll get it back for you next time I visit.” He assured Cas. He didn't really need to, it wasn't like Cas was emotionally attached to the scarf. It was just a scarf.
Sam gave another appreciative smile and thanked Castiel before moving out of the lecture hall to join a group of his friends.
‘Dean!’ Was all Cas could say, trying not to raise his voice too loudly, but Dean was speeding away, down the corridor and he was gone.
Dean sighed. ‘Sorry it was a lot. Then I was drunk and I’m still getting over it.’ He forced a snort of a laugh through his nose.
Dean pulled Cas away sobbing himself. He put his hands on Cas' shoulders.
‘I said I’m fine.’ His voice was more stern now. Cas took a step back, holding his hands up.
‘How did you...?’
‘You’re to the point.’
Benny looked away but Gordon continued.
It may be a spoiler but I just want to preface this chapter with the fact that none of the characters in this fic go to hell after confessing their gay love - so if that's what you came for I'm sorry :'D
Then Dean stepped back, letting go.
He sent the address and nothing more.
Dean looked on as Castiel poured through his things in his tiny dorm room, taking his time over his CD collection. His room was only a little smaller than Cas', or maybe that was because Cas' bed was a little bigger. A tiny cupboard for clothes, a sink, desk and bedside cabinet.
Over the year the pair became fast friends. It was an odd pairing but they complemented each other. They had so much fun in their first year together. They joined a bunch of societies and Cas found that he could actually open up to this girl. She was the first person he ever came out to. Honestly she already knew. Cas was sure she knew from the night they met. But in time he felt safe enough to share some of his deepest secrets with her, and she did too.
(See the end of the chapter for
“What is it?” Cas asked, looking up at Dean as he closed the trunk and walked back towards him.
‘I’m a female mechanic!’ Charlie threw out her arms, gesturing at herself. ‘I am literally a quintessential lesbian stereotype.’
Finally Dean pulled down the waistband. Both men moaned and Dean took the hard cock in his hand, gently stroking, while moving back to press his lips firmly into the strangers neck.
‘My brother is one of your students.’
‘He’s fine.’ Dean finally looked back at Castiel. ‘I’m here about me.’
The hot and cold was suddenly jarring.
Castiel did up his shirt buttons, readjusted his tie and sat back at his desk.
“Then why aren't you here?” he questioned. “Why aren't you here Dean?”
The alcohol and the win had really given him a sense of overwhelming courage and he suddenly didn’t realise why he was holding back.
‘You don’t want to dance?’ Cas asked, nudging Dean with his elbow.
Everything was there… except his red scarf.
“I trust you Dean.” he said stroking his hair as Dean sat up to look at him. “I want you to be my first,” he nodded, smiling. “I want you inside of me.”
Thanksgiving came and the pair didn't have to tell each other what they were thankful for, they already knew. They set off Wednesday afternoon to make the drive for Lawrence. Dean's home was big, with a large open plan kitchen and dining area, and big archways that led to a sitting room. Dean's family we're the sweetest people. They were all there – except John, but Mary made sure they said a prayer for him at the table. Sam was so witty, as funny as his brother. So smart – like Dean had said. Cas talked to Sam at length about high school and college and his aspirations for Stanford. There was no doubt that he wouldn't be making his way to sunny California in a few years’ time. Cas caught up with Emily and thanked her for their stay at her place, he was sure they talked about more but he couldn't remember.
‘You kidding? You must be the smartest guy in there?’
It was Christmas Eve and neither Cas nor Dean had gotten each other anything. Dean asked over and over but Cas told him that he already had the best thing, and nothing could top it. So they agreed no gifts.
Cas went back into the kitchen to make tea for his nerves. He moved about the room slowly, placing the kettle on the stove and listening to the quiet simmer of the water coming to the boil. He sat and sipped and waited. He knew he shouldn’t have. He should have read, or watched TV. But he sat at the kitchen table and waited.
? He couldn’t tell.
, Dean thought and then mentally scolded himself.
‘So kinky, Cas.’ Dean cooed as he pulled out an odd shaped dildo.
‘Hello Dean.’
“You don't understand, you don't...”
‘Cas-’
Meg seemed apprehensive of this when Cas told her about it.
Cas’s head rolled back onto the bed as he let the pleasure sweep over him.
‘Cas don’t be like that.’ Dean stepped forward again, swaying with how drunk he was and Cas moved to the other side of the dining table.
“I'll be gentle,” he spoke, coming forward to kiss Cas again. An intense kiss that still clung on their lips as Dean pulled away.
Was all Castiel wrote back.
a small voice hissed.
They weren't too far from Deans building now, and they turned the corner to walk alongside it towards to the entrance.
. Just getting his rocks off.
Castiel knew this probably wasn't true. Dean probably had friends and family that loved him, but sometimes people don’t realise that. They don’t feel they can be totally themselves with their loved ones. And they truly feel alienated. Castiel knew what that was like.
“You open it,” he spoke, staring at the wall.
‘Not like what?’ Dean asked.
Something about the way the light fell through the window from the nearby street lamp, casting them in yellow tones and black shadow felt so right.
‘Upstairs?’ He asked and gestured that Castiel should lead the way.
But Castiel left the army suddenly when their tour was finally over and for his own peace of mind he couldn’t speak to them. Balthazar, Anna, Uriel, any of them.
He put his glass down. The beautiful song was already transitioning into a conga line but Dean didn’t care. He needed to leave. To be out of this room somewhere where he could breathe.
When they arrived back at Cas' place Meg was still away visiting her family so they made love right there one the hall floor. Everything they had pent up finally released.
‘Not happy to see me?’ Dean smirked, trying to lighten the mood.
Finally Dean kept up the speed. It was so hot, the way Cas’s brows furrowed, and his hands reached to squeeze Dean's thighs.
With no feelings he could shirk the shame. He wasn’t dating a guy.
Without hesitation Dean stepped forward, his face inches away from Mr Trench Coat, their eyes locked and he pressed a kiss down onto waiting lips.
He couldn't fathom why he felt so empty. Until lying on his cold studio floor it hit him. He felt a gaping hole in him because that was what Dean had left: the absence. He more than loved Dean, Dean had become a part of him. Now that part was gone, missing, taking some of him with it.
“Hi,” Cas mimicked, internally scolding himself for his originality.
Dean was confused, his hands left to grope the air, then with the click of the lock, he smirked at Castiel.
On a better day, after Mary’s death, John took Sam and Dean to their first motorsport event. NASCAR and kart racing was one of the only things that seemed to pull John out of a slump. And if Dean could just qualify, if their team could make it to the big leagues, maybe John would finally realise there was life to be lived again.
“I'll see you around Castiel.” He concluded. And with that he continued walking on as he had before. Cas' eyes still trained on him. “I'm sure I will,” He spoke quietly. But it was too late; Dean was already out of sight.
Cas paused. “Shit,” he declared. Wiping his face with his jumper sleeves. “I miss you,”
“Are you okay?” Cas walked towards him, playing with his hands so that they brushed Dean's stomach.
Driving usually soothed him but this time he was restless and his palms were moist.
‘Really?’ Dean made a face at Castiel who was blushing.
“Cas please talk to me,” Cas looked Dean in the face. Cas hated remembering this moment. It was prickly in his head, making him feel sick.
“How much did you drink?” he asked.
Castiel had long admitted to himself that he was lonely. He wasn’t ashamed of it. He enjoyed solitude. But occasionally he craved the intimacy of another. The ability to share parts of his life with someone special.
Except this time his feet never find purchase.
He outright admitted to the boy that his dad was an abusive assbutt and his siblings were of no help during his childhood. He almost told him that he had had a crush on him when they were in high school.
Dean's scared to take the risk, but he glances behind him to see if that holds a path. What he sees behind him makes his breath catch and his eyes start to water.
"I just need about an hour to unwind and relax," Sam says with a relaxed shrug that brings Castiel, once again, back to the present. Castiel’s therapist has mentioned to him that he does zone out a lot. Maybe he shouldn’t do that. "If you're there, you'll complain the entire time about my music and insult me which is the exact opposite of why I'm doing it," Sam avoids eye contact with Dean. Castiel tenses up when Sam's eyes land on him and a slow smirk spreads across the Winchester's mouth. "Besides, Dean," Sam turns away from him. "You need more friends." Sam winks at the older Winchester and then walks away with a spring in their step. Castiel furrows his eyebrows as he watches them walk towards the other end of the dorm hall. Isn’t their room at the
"You're kicking me out of this seat so you can read Flirting for Dummies? For real, dude?" Castiel shrinks away from the sharp look that Dean gives him. Maybe he shouldn’t have said anything. Dean dramatically stands up from the recliner. Despite his words, Dean’s voice has a playful lilt to it. “Whatever. You can have it."
"Anything?" Gabe hums victoriously at Castiel's dejected yes. He opens the door as little as possible to shove a book into his brother's arms before slamming it shut again. Castiel swears he hears a laugh from someone that was definitely not his brother. He brushes off the odd feeling and he turns to go back to his recliner. He squints his eyes when he sees a familiar face occupying his seat.
Castiel should be surprised when he sees Sam Winchester step out of his dorm with disheveled hair and a bright blush on his cheeks. But, unfortunately, Castiel knows his brother and knows his tastes. He also knows Gabriel had been sporting that crush since Sam was Lucifer's. It makes Castiel a little uncomfortable to say the least. However, his shock was nothing compared to Dean's.
Why were they here? Unless his theory about Jack using Castiel’s remaining Grace was the answer. It would make sense, Dean muses, because Bobby spoke in the present tense about him. Dean rounds the corner, and he slows down on the bridge. This view was it. This is what he was looking for. He parks the Impala, but he doesn’t turn her off. This is supposedly Heaven, after all. Gas shouldn’t exist. He turns up the radio as it plays one of his favorite songs and he hums along. He gets out of the car and he leaves the door open. The music pours out and floats gently in the tranquil air.
Castiel gives the boy no time to respond as he jumps up out of the recliner. He’s going to go insane if he can’t occupy himself. He makes a snap decision to bother his brother.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I need a moment.” Dean takes a step back and he breathes in a deep breath. “Know of a place I can just…” He gestures vaguely with a sigh.
"I'm dead anyways. Fuck it." He runs towards the boulder as fast he can, knowing that he'd have to jump the growing gap. Dean swears he feels a gust of wind pushing him forward but he can't think much of it as he takes the leap of faith. Dean does the dumb thing and he glances down as he jumps; he sees the nothingness of blue sky and pink clouds for miles upon miles.
"Socializing is important too." The younger boy says. He studies him carefully as if Dean knew the telltale signs of abuse and neglect. "Even if it's not romance, friends are important. Family is important."
Of course, they're not friends, Castiel thinks bitterly as he throws himself onto his bed. He pulls his stuffed bee into his arms and he presses his nose to the soft material.
“I do believe that there are two people that would disagree with my being your best friend.” Castiel hums. “Do you want to see one of them?” When Dean smiles, Castiel rests his hand on Dean’s left shoulder. They both vanish instantly, leaving the Impala singing alone in the wind.
Dean Winchester was boring. He knew that, his brother knew that, hell, even his late girlfriend had known that. He was a boring mechanic in a boring Midwestern town with a boring future. Most of his days consisted of airing up tires for folks that didn't know how
Jack showed up towards the end of the luncheon; Jo was just serving dessert when he showed.
Castiel couldn't look Dean in the eye so he focuses his gaze on the ground and hugs his legs even tighter.
“Baby’s over there,” Jo pokes him in the side and turns his attention towards the beautiful car.
"Are you... okay?" Dean whispers. He stands up from the couch and kneels in front of him. "Hey, kid. I didn't mean to make you upset. Really. I know I suck at this comforting shit so I'm... sorry." Castiel lifts his head and he's shocked at how close Dean is to him.
"Yes. Family is important." Castiel barely manages to choke those words out. It wasn't a complete lie. Gabriel was important. His cousins Samandriel and Anna were important. He just couldn't wrap his head around his dad being important. His dad provided for him and kept a roof over his head, but the other things he did, the damage he inflicted, was not out of love.
Cas helped what? Build heaven? If Dean’s theory was right, it was probably just a metaphor for Jack making Heaven in honor of the deceased angel. Or, god forbid, Jack using what little of Castiel’s grace remained once he had been consumed by the Empty.
Castiel curls up in the huge chair, bringing his knees to his chest to make himself as small as possible. It was a leftover comfort habit from when he was a kid; when Aunt Mara and Dad would fight loud and unafraid in the kitchen.
“Dean, it’s me. It’s really me.” Castiel whispers softly and he tightens his grip on Dean’s wrists. “Jack pulled us all out; me, Gabriel, Anna, Balthazar. The Empty doesn’t exist anymore.” Upon seeing Dean’s confused and terrified look, Castiel yanks the eldest Winchester into a fierce hug. “You’re safe now, Dean. You’ve been saved.”
When Dean died, he thought he would go down swinging full force. Maybe, just maybe, he'd end up skewered on the end of some demon bitch's knife. I This was rigged. This had to be Chuck's final laugh. Yeah, the guy wasn't God anymore, but it could've been one last, cruel joke. He was so, so close to finally being free. He was so close to being able to sit down and process everything that's happened in his damn life.
“You are the most caring man on Earth. You are the most selfless, loving human being I will ever know.” Dean’s fingers were ghost white against the steering wheel now. He has never heard anyone say anything like that to him before. It felt like it came straight out of a Hallmark movie; the epitome of chick flick moments. He was reliving his memories of his best friend. At first, it was just his voice. As Dean progressed down the road, he started noticing flickers.
Kevin. Ash. Missouri. Pamela. He couldn’t pinpoint all of them, but they were all people they’d helped over the years. People that met bullshit fates. However, this meant that Dean could spend all of eternity with them and have fun. Get to know everyone again.
if it had nothing to do with the rest of us. Dad would punish us all just in case one of us had helped.” Castiel freezes when he feels arms around him.
“Suure. Sure. I wouldn’t be surprised if you tripped and hit your head on the foot board of your bed.” Charlie laughs and she calls out to some friends that Dean recognizes.
Dean was never a religious guy. He knew when he did wrong and when he was supposed to ask for forgiveness (not that he did.) But in this very moment? Dean wishes he had been religious. If he was, it would explain what he was currently seeing.
“That’s bullshit,” The air from Dean’s voice brushes against the side of Castiel’s neck and he nearly starts crying. When was the last time someone other than Gabriel had given him a hug? When was the last time Gabriel had given him a hug? “That’s total bullshit,” Dean repeats and he pulls away from Castiel to look into his eyes. His hands are still on Castiel’s shoulders. “My dad would’ve just punished me and been done with it. Sammy’s the good kid, not me; but at least it was
Castiel knows that chewing on his nails is a bad habit but it’s one that has never been able to break. He usually starts it up when he’s anxious; like right now.
be happy, relax, grow.
and filling up the wiper fluid for their windshields. After work, he'd stop by Ellen's bar and check up on her.
Dean cringes at the nickname of ‘Bob’ for his godfather, Bobby, but he nods along with the rest of what Ellen said. The reason fit what he knew about Jess, but the change of Sam’s values was a little weird. But what Sam did was none of his business, he made that perfectly clear two years ago.
Dean stumbles a little when he feels solid footing under his feet again and he lets out a relieved breath.
“Uh, ya know, just the usual. Killing gods and monsters.” Dean lies through his teeth and he messes her hair up. Castiel coughs and he covers his smile at Dean’s lie. Dean missed that sound more than anything he missed in his entire life.
Castiel forces a sympathetic smile and he hopes that it’s enough for Dean. Anything more and Castiel is going to start crying. He turns his eyes to the TV to avoid more heartfelt conversation.
, Castiel thinks to himself,
"I'm not trying to flirt with anyone," Castiel says softly with a frown. "I just want to study my major and graduate. I don't care about romance."
, Castiel prays quietly to God.
Dean growls and he shoves the spectral. However, he’s unable to push. His palms are met with a solid form and he shoves harder. “Jack, you did this, didn’t you? You couldn’t let him go, dammit!” Dean shoves the ghost’s shoulders, and it stumbles back in shock. The ghost grasps both of Dean’s wrists gently.
"Wait, how do you know?" Dean asks indignantly. "Do I really look that young?" Castiel laughs with a small hiccup.
“My dad was always strict,” Cas explains. “If any of his kids got off script or did something wrong, it was punishment for all of us. Needless to say, our siblings were not fond of Gabriel… or Lucifer.”
"That's awesome," Dean replies automatically, staring off into the wilderness. He was in too much shock to respond.
The rest of the drive was full of every moment Dean could remember experiencing with the Angel; although, some of the memories weren’t his. At some point, the memories seemed to be from someone else’s point of view; a point of view that focused on the shape of Dean’s lips, his eyes, the way his eyes crinkled when he made a stupid joke. It was Castiel’s memories.
"You have to make a choice, Dean." A voice, not feminine nor masculine, whispers in the wind. "Otherwise you will be stuck here..."
A pat on his shoulder tells him that, yes, the smile was enough.
“Even if it had nothing to do with you?” Dean’s voice is soft and his eyes are intense. At some point, the two of them had moved to the couch and sat at a respectable distance. It gives Castiel a clear view of those beautiful green eyes.
It takes a moment of brain racking concentration for Castiel to remember when he last saw it
”They wanted different things, I guess. Bob was telling me how Jessica wanted to be a big city psychiatrist but Sammy wanted to come home. He also expressed interest in having children, something she definitely did not want.”
They speak occasionally about small things. Castiel asks Dean about his family, how growing up in Laurence was, and how the Winchester Auto Shop was doing. Castiel knows Mary Winchester died in a fire while they were in high school; it had been all over the school and the school newspaper. Castiel knew what it was like to lose your mother so young, and yet he never thought to reach out to him and tell him he wasn’t alone. What a sad pair of fools were they.
"Anyway, could I convince you to switch to the couch?" Cas tries again, meeker but angrier. "My brother kicked me out of my room and that recliner is my favorite place to read." Dean's green eyes flicker over to Castiel with disinterest and then they drop down to the book in his arms. The expression that flickers across Dean’s face makes Castiel’s heart leap. What is this feeling? He shouldn’t be counting the freckles that dot his cheekbones, but here he is. Did his eyes always dance with such mirth? Has Dean always had such a breathtaking smirk?
Dean pulled his brother into a hug. Sam hugged him back. "I'll be back soon, Sammy," Dean says to him quietly.
"Through here," Dean said, making a turn and walking off of the pavement and heading toward some trees. "Be careful through here, the trees can get in the way."
His second guest came a little bit later. Cas was prepared for when he arrived. He had the trench-coat on over his hospital wing shirt. His new trench-coat worked really well and suited him even better. His wings were well hidden underneath it.
"I'm sorry," Meg pops her head out from the back. "Did fucking Castiel just say he had a code 9-18?" She had an interested look in her eye.
Cas and Dean exchange a look. Neither of them would admit that they knew what she was talking about, but both had an idea.
"Kids, this is Professor Jody Mills, she's the deputy headmistress. She will be explaining the sorting ceremony to you and leading you to the Great Hall for the start of the year feast," Garth explains before leaving.
"No no, you're welcome at my house! It's not problem, I promise." Dean assured Cas.
The brothers' father was John Winchester. John had died when Dean was eight and Sam was six and that day was four years after Mary Winchester's death. Four years to the day. John was a muggle, someone who was not born magical. Mary, on the other hand, was a pure-blooded witch. She went to Hogwarts just like Dean would be.
Dean and Cas walked into Bobby's class together and sat down at their regular table. The Winchester gave a greeting smile to his adopted guardian and Bobby nodded back.
Cas gave his brother a look.
Castiel takes a breath, preparing himself for the multiple outcomes of telling the professor about what the Sorting Hat had told him.
That chapter was fun and painful to write.
Cas sighed, he knew that having people over meant he likely had to hide his wings. He had gotten used to having his wings out around the Winchesters. He was able to have them out and not feel like he was secretly being judged, which was a change from the Novak household.
There was a small silence for Cas as he debated on if he should tell Dean everything or not. After some thinking, Cas decided to tell Dean part of it. If Dean reacted well, then Cas might tell him the second part later.
I’ve watched you make countless mistakes
I know it's a bad description but can anyone guess who was in that moving picture Cas looked at?
The said Winchester shakes his head. "No, Cas. You don't need to give me any explanations." Dean takes a deep breath. "Look, I never said anything because I didn't think I had a chance. I mean: you're a freaking angel, man! You've lived for millions of years. Why would you ever want to settle down with a mortal human like me?" He pauses. "I've wanted to tell you for a long time, I just couldn't find the courage. Each time I lost you, I regretted not telling you before. But whenever you came back, I was... I couldn't bare loosing you. But, Cas, I..."
She nods, "yes, I do now. It used to by my family home, but they all left. I used to live here with my girlfriend, but she was recently killed." The woman shook her head, tears forming in her eyes. "I'm guessing this is why you two are here?"
Castiel's head tilted at Charlie. "'Btw'?" He repeats.
However, when Castiel saw the picture, both of his hands grabbed Dean's arm. Dean's head  turned sharply towards Cas when he did this. "Cas?"
"Well, I have two options for hiding my wings. One of them being hiding them under my clothes. Which has gotten a bit complicated with the new set of wings I have. Or, I can hide the, on a different plane of existence; where they are invisible but still there. I use the other plane of existence to phase my wings through any clothes without destroying them. I usually hide my wings under my clothes because putting them in the other plane is energy draining. But I think I'm getting better at having them that way, in the other plan of existence." Castiel explains his wing situation.
Hopefully I will be posting again soon. Feel free to add comments, it’s always great to hear from readers and know that people are actually reading my book.
"No," Jack answers, "Cas is staying here. He's staying with us."
Madam Hooch watched as more and more students succeeded in commanding their broom. Five minutes later, Madam Hooch went to help the students who were having trouble getting their brooms to obey them.
Sirius turned to Remus. His hand reached up and he carefully traced the claw mark scars on Lupin’s face. “Y’know, I’ve been wondering how you got these? Did you fall onto some weird ass gate when you were a kid or something?”
Castiel thanks the man and reads the note.
The Novak flapped his wings once. He didn't move off the ground. Cas frowned a bit.
It was a nice Sunday when Meg decided to take a quick break from working and let Castiel handle the customers for a few minutes. Castiel was doing fine, staying calm and speaking with the humans that came in the cafe.
Cas, along with the other Hufflepuff team members, kicked off the ground and flew up into the ground. Gryffindor got the first couple of points, putting them into the lead.
Giving a nod, the black haired female writes down her number and gives Gabriel and Castiel their drinks and pastry. She hands Castiel the napkin she just wrote her number on and offered a smile to him.
Be left without his own mother?
(See the end of the chapter for
Cas sent him a 'no shit Sherlock' glare, causing Dean to chuckle in response.
Cas spent a good fraction of the time on the train thinking about how he had not yet told Charlie about his wings. He wanted to, yes, but he just couldn't do it, y'know?
Gabriel and Castiel may not have been on Earth for more than a month, but they had watched humans for millions of years and knew that it was customary to wait in line for one's turn. So that's what they did. They only had to wait a few minutes before it was their turn to order. Gabriel, who had always wanted to try one, ordered a hot chocolate. While Castiel asked for a simple black coffee and a small pastry.
"Are you supposed to be a Disney Princess?" Dean retorted. Charlie gave him a look, he shrugged. "What? I know muggle things. But, no, I'm not a lumber jack. I'm a hunter! Hunters are a kind of auror and you have to have a very specific number of qualifications to be one. It's so strict that the last hunter died like fifty years ago and there hasn't been one since. My dad used to tell me and my brother about them."
Dean watched Cas’ face as the Novak looked up at the sky. The Winchester’s eyes softened a bit, seeing Cas’ relaxed expression. Dean reached over and took Cas’ hand, feeling a nice warm th when he wrapped his hand around Cas’. It felt nice. More importantly, it felt right.
"Meg! Language!" Ellen calls from her secret hidden room behind where the drinks and pastries were made and out of sight from any peering customers.
"Cas?"
The next question was quite similar. "Did you teach Harry Potter?"
Lupin called on the first student. "Yes?"
The half-blood listened to Cas intently. "You have a big family," Dean comments.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Cas is here?" Sam asks. "Have you... talked to him yet?"
The next student stepped up. The boggart turned into a big, fat germ. The student squirmed when he saw it and quickly changed it into a bunch of bubbles and a rubber ducky.
Sam Winchester- Pierce Gagnon
"You... you did this to yourself?"
Cas reached out further and finally came close to the small, golden ball. Cas’ hands close around the fast moving snitch and he slowed to a stop. He looked down at his hand and smiled. He had caught the snitch and won the game.
But he did. He felt things for Dean that no other human nor angel made him feel. And Dean didn't even care for him. Dean only used him so he could get what he wants, so he could be healed magically, so Dean could use his mojo for his own needs. Dean didn't care about Cas.
The students all listened to Professor MacLeod go over her rules, saying stuff they could do and couldn't do. She went over the rules about if cauldron mishaps when the cauldron is ruined.
Inside, Hogwarts was just as beautiful as the outside. Though, in different ways. Through most of the corridors, there were moving pictures hanging on the walls. There were also multiple other, simple decorations around as well. Vases, pottery and occasional trophy (as well as other trinkets) stands were placed throughout the halls too.
"Cas will be able to tell you are not Jack, you know," Amara warns.
The marriage officiant goes through the blessings and all the wedding vows before finally turning to Eileen. "Do you, Eileen Leahy, take Samuel William Winchester to be your lawfully wedded husband?"
That chapter... did not end up the way I thought it would. The whole “would you rather” stuff didn’t come to me until I was in the middle of writing. As did the peck. So we’ll see where this takes us.
Soon enough, the pair sits down and Dean catches Cas up on everything he missed. Dean told Cas everything from how Jack defeated God to every hunt Dean went on. Cas listened the entire time, a content look on the angel's face. Castiel was back. Whether Dean loved him in return or not, he was back with his best friend. Cas was back with the human who made him stronger than he ever was, even if Cas is no longer a full-powered angel.
When Castiel gets back, Dean is looking around for him, looking worried. Dean spots Cas and smiles at him. Cas goes over to him.
It takes Cas a few hours to get to the barn. The sigils and wardings are still on the walls of the barn. The markings are all faded but evidence of them originally being there is present.
"Is this where Sam and Dean Winchester live? We are from the Ministry of Magic and would like to question them about a few things," one of the men said.
Sam huffs. "Cas, should I at least try to keep the timeline I lived going or are we just going to say 'fuck it' and leave that timeline behind us?"
Cas stands up. His wings, now tidy and cleaner than before, stretch out behind him. The Panic Room is just big enough for Cas to completely stretch his wings out.
Dean gives a chuckle. "Castiel, this is Miracle. Miracle, this is Cas."
“Novak is getting closer and closer, but can he catch the snitch or will he loose it?”
Teddy had been living with the Potters, since Lupin couldn’t watch over him and teach Hogwarts lessons at the same time. But Lupin didn’t choose his teachings over Teddy, Lupin believed that Teddy would be more safer with the Potters than himself.
"I'm Amendiel Canaan."
The deva looks up at the sky, blinking a bit whenever a soft snowflake would land on top of one of his eyes. The sky was now dark but the snow was visible and bright. Oh what it would be like to fly up there.
By now, Castiel had woken up. The deva stirred in his spot, his black wings ruffling beside him.
And it went on like that for another few months. That same scenario had been happening for the past six years. But it stopped when Michael- because of his friends forcing him to do so- threatened to call the police and rat him out for harming one of his own boys.
The Hogwarts Professor moves around Cas to examine his wings. "I'm guessing someone tried to heal his wing?" Garth asks, looking around at everyone to find the culprit. Everyone turned to Ellen.
The two boys walked into the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom together. Instead of the regular setup inside, the desks were all pushed to the side of the room and in the center of the classroom, a teacher's desk that wasn't Lupin's was there.
Things were going great back outside. Castiel had started to move around up in the air. It took him a few tries, but he figured out how to direct himself with his wings. Before long, Cas was racing around the perimeter of the yard, Dean following his every move.
Most of the Hufflepuffs were upset that they hadn't won the game, but all of them were understanding and knew no one was perfect.
Dark, terrifying and blacker than the blackest night
The pure-blood's head tilted, "why would they not be feeling fine, sir? Is there something I should know?"
"Collins, Misha"
Gabriel looks over his brother's shoulder at the napkin. The archangel gives a laugh when he sees Castiel's confusion. "Little bro, you just got that girl's phone number, it means she's interested in you!"
The room was quiet and no one said anything.
"You CHOSE to fight Hitler?"
"Everyone, I want you to step up the left side of your broom. Raise your right hand above the broom and say 'up'," Madam Hooch ordered her students.
Cas let out a pained yelp. Ellen's spell had made it worse. Much worse. That's when everyone began to panic. If Cas' wings didn't heal like a human set of bones would, how the hell were they supposed to heal them? No one knew what they were doing or how to heal a deva's wings.
Castiel smiled and walked over to Dean. The two of them sat down, admiring the view. They sat like that for a while, occasionally making conversation but mostly staying quiet. Somehow, they didn't get frostbite.
Cas noticed his friends coming over from the stands and grinned at them. Charlie congratulated him first, with a large smile. Dean high fives him, smiling as well. Cas smiles back at them.
"SLYTHERIN"
Despite it being a childish thing, Dean made a wish when he blew out the fire. He wanted his Castiel back, Dean would do whatever it takes to get Cas back. Yet there wasn't anything to do to get him back, because Dean can't. He can't get him back.
The teacher walked to the front of the class. "Hello, students," he greeted, "my name is Professor Lupin and I'll be the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher."
That was another thing. Dean never got to tell Cas that he loved him back. The only person- or rather angel- that ever made Dean feel completely human, died thinking that Dean didn't love him back. That was probably the most painful thing of all.
Even though it was late, the kids in the Great Hall were discussing the events that would be happening tomorrow. There had been an idea to have an event very similar to a muggle Halloween party. Students were allowed to create their own costume for a celebration after the Halloween feast. Of course, doing this and dressing up was optional.
"May I take a look at your wings?" Garth asks him softly.
A moment later, Garth almost cheered. He stood up, now knowing what was going on with Cas and why his wings hurt so much.
Clapping came from down below and Cas looked to see that Charlie and Dean were standing behind Dan and watching Cas practice. The deva’s face went pink.
Dean leaned over to Castiel while the four of them walked and whispered to him, asking Cas if it was okay that Dean told Meg and Charlie about Cas' new achievement. Castiel said it was okay.
Charlie examined Cas' wings. "Those look so real! Great charm work on those!"
To calm his nerves, Dean decided to go out that night. And after a LOT of convincing, Sam decided to go with him. And where did they go? A strip bar!
"Alright. Then I'll keep my costume a secret from you two, and we'll surprise each other."
Professor Lupin started to call names from the attendance sheet, each student replied with "here" or something of the sorts. When the professor got to Castiel's name, he looked up and made eye contact with Cas when the pure-blood said "here".
When Dean finally got into bed, the mattress under him felt so nice and he sunk easily into it, falling asleep quickly.
“Oh, he was Lupin’s mate. Er... Lupin is a werewolf. The sorting hat mentioned him to me when I got sorted, so I got up enough courage to talk to him. I told him my secret, he told me his,” Cas answered. “He really seems to have loved Sirius.”
Though the Winchesters were raised with wizards, they still both enjoyed muggle things. Sam was quite fond of multiple fictional television shows, Dr. Who being one of his favorites, and Dean enjoyed old muggle music that his father used to listen to.
"That's a good idea. It'll be nice to see the people we haven't talked to in a long while." Sam agrees with the idea.
Charlie’s costume was pretty hard to put together. Because they costumes are all supposed to be made of what the students already had and I was debating on if Charlie just brought a cosplay along with her or not. So I decided a regular Halloween costume would go well and made her get a fancy mask and a dress. But then I thought I could put that into any movie. So I looked up movies/shows/books with an outfit like that and the Labyrinth came up. The Labyrinth was a solid movie so I put it in.
Sam looks over at Gabriel, suddenly getting an idea. "Hey, I want to show you something," he says, a large smile spreading across his face.
The journey to the strip bar was a bit less of a ride. He got there in about an hour and a half.
Castiel and Gabriel exchange a look. Gabriel grins at his brother, giving a 'let's try it out' look.
- Time Skip -
The Winchester starts to turn his back and walk away from Jack. However, Jack uses his wings and quickly reappears in front of Dean to stop him from walking away. "I think you'll like this gift," Jack says.
Both Winchesters were grinning as they stepped out of the Impala. There were so many old faces. Bobby stood with Ellen, Jo and Ash. Next to them stood Rufus Turner, Pamela Barnes and Kelly Kline. Charlie Bradbury who had a large grin on her face. Kevin Tran who was standing beside Charlie. Finally, Mick Davies and Arthur Ketch. The two British men were the outcasts of the group, but that wasn't going to stop the, from getting Dean and Sam Winchester, legends even in the afterlife.
Dean walked past the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom before doing a double-take and peaking his head in through the door. Cas stood there, discussing something that seemed to be very... emotional with Professor Lupin.
The trio walked over to their usual spot at the Gryffindor table. Meg, Maze, Morningstar and Chloe all sat at the table already.
"Oh, and White starts off his first Quidditch game by grabbing the Quaffle first. Oh my, he's a fast flyer. That looks like a Nimbus 5003 to me. White passes the ball to Lopez, Lopez passes it to Morris. But- ooh, the Slytherin Palmer intercepts it and passes the Quaffle to his teammate Kason. But White takes the ball in a swift move. That was a really advanced move they just did, folks. Bravo, White!”
Packages and letters dropped all around and fell into their designated owner's hands. Castiel caught a letter. Dr. Whoo perched himself down next to Dean and had a letter attached to his leg. Dean untied the letter from Dr. Whoo's leg and opened it. A small package dropped into Charlie's hands and the red-headed girl grinned, glad that her parents had found the correct way to message her. Meg sat with a frown on her face and her arms crossed.
On the opposite end of the field, the Slytherins came marching out of their own changing room.
"Come on," Dean stood up, "we should probably get dressed and go down to the Great Hall so we won't be late. We don't want to raise any more suspicion. A couple people are probably already suspicious that we didn't show up at our common rooms."
When the last day arrived, Castiel went around and thanked his teachers. Some he talked with, Lupin in particular. Lupin asked if he would be okay over the summer break. Castiel would nod in response and told the professor that his father wasn't as bad as he used to be.
Gabe and Cas quickly went downstairs, both brothers dreading their father’s rage when they appeared. And just like they suspected, just like always, their dad was mad. Lucifer was currently in a fight with him, so he didn’t pay much attention to Cas and Gabe.
Dean nods, "yeah." Dean looks over at Cas. "What about you? What's your family like?"
Cas' head tilts. "Sam...?" He didn't understand.
Castiel looks right at Dean. "Every word. I have
"You wouldn't mind if I take a shower, would you?" Castiel asks, looking over at his mate.
"I know I may not be the face you two want to see, but I wouldn't show up unless I was called or something important came up," Cas says. "I've cast a spell so we won't be overheard, as I am going against orders to not see you two, this meeting will have to be short if we do not agree. But I fear something bad is beginning and the Winchester brothers would most helpful down on Earth."
The Professor nods before letting Cas be.
Snow hits Cas and he lets out a surprised gasp, not at all expecting it. Cas glares at Dean, a smile playing on his lips.
Thank you for reading this through! Hope you liked it! I know the ending was rushed, the story is plotted over the seven years at Hogwarts so we aren’t done yet.
Once all the plates were cleaned up and put away, Dean asked Cas if he had any winter coats with him. Cas didn't have any that could really compete with the cold. But he did have his trench-coat!
"Past tense?" Castiel asked quietly.
"I continued working here a few years ago. Before that, I only worked in this position for a year," Lupin answers.
The Novak walks over and hands Dean the lotion. “Just a little bit. It says so on the label.” Cas sits down on the floor in front of Dean.
Sam greets her back, "hi, Vanya. This is my friend, Gabriel. His brother goes to Hogwarts with Dean. Gabe, this is Vanya. She works here with her girlfriend Sissy. They're both witches." Sam introduces Gabriel to Vanya.
Cas smiled back at him. "Thanks," he said before turning and walking off with Dan.
The girl smiled at Dean and sat down next to him. "I'm Charlie, btw. Charlie Bradbury."
He tried again. More confident this time around, Castiel's wings flapped with more power. All four wings moved at the same time. Dean watched in awe as Cas managed to push himself off the ground about three inches. Winchester had to admit that Cas looked pretty angelic up in the air. It looked like Cas belonged in the air, not on Earth.
This woman was easily recognized by Team Free Will.
Devas are D&D creatures that are a subspecies of angels. Devas are from Buddhism, which by the way, was quite interesting to read about.
It meant that when they finally arrived, Cas could take out his wings and just relax. Gabriel had commented on Cas' broom, asking why even bother using it when he could just use his wings to catch the snitch.
Dean pulled up before Cas did, he stopped, hovering a few feet of the ground.
Dean shakes his head. "If you don't want to see him, then you don't have to. There are a bunch of other people we could visit. Literally everyone who has ever died is here. Everyone! I may have gotten into a fight with Hitler because he recognized me as the guy who killed him, but whatever."
Lupin nodded. "He died on a mission. It was a long time ago, though."
"I think you have to keep flapping," Dean commented.
“Good job, Clarence,” Meg said, coming over to them with Maze beside her.
The pair of them walked over to the Gryffindor table and sat down, talking to each other. "So," Dean starts, "what classes do you have today?"
Castiel nodded. He led the way back over to the counter. Castiel glanced at Gabriel as Meg made her way back over to them.
And to grieve, I decided to write the ending I want. Of course, the last two episodes are currently yet to air and Chuck knows that I won't be expecting whatever comes and if Cas comes back or not (Misha is rumored to have gone to Vancouver to film something sometime in the last two episodes- so here's hoping).
(See the end of the chapter for
The deva smiles, "thanks, Dean. I hope you end up being correct."
Dan put the snitch away, saying that they would save that for the first game. Instead, he pulled out some muggle golfing balls.
Lupin would get "sick" every month and only Dean and Cas knew why. Almost every night, Dean and Cas would not show up in their assigned rooms, instead sleeping in the same hidden room. Cas had won another Quidditch match, this time against Slytherin. But he had lost one game against Gryffindor, which Dean would jokingly tease him about. Meg and Maze slowly got closer. Lucifer Novak kept trying (and failing quite miserably) to pick a fight with Lucifer Morningstar, But Morningstar would ignore him and Cas, Dean and Charlie would laugh about it. Michael would check in with his younger brother every now and again, sometimes Garth would drop by to see how Cas was doing with both sets of wings. And each time, Garth would mention healing those scars, and each time, Cas would refuse.
"You had a nice life, I'm proud of you, Sammy," Dean says when Sam finishes up telling him his life's story.
Cas nods shyly.
The pair of angels started their new job a week later. The owner of the cafe, Jo's mom Ellen, interviewed them despite them already having a high chance of getting the job.
"We will!" Sam and Gabe said after sharing a look, like they were talking telepathically.
//Trigger warning: mention of past abuse near the end of the chapter\\
"Table for two." Dean confirms.
Lupin makes his way over to Dean and Cas. “Got a lot of comments on your costume, I assume, Castiel?” Lupin asks Cas, speaking like they shared a secret and he was trying to get Dean away so the two could speak.
Maybe if you come back,
The pure-blood nods, "yes, I slept well. Better than have all year." Cas smiles.
Everyone obeyed and almost simultaneously stepped op to their brooms and followed Madam Hooch's orders. The word "up" was repeated through the class of students. Immediately, Castiel's broom snapped up to his hand. Cas grinned, feeling the wooden broom in his hand. Almost two seconds after Cas succeeded, Dean's brook snapped up. The two friends smiled at each other when they saw the other had gotten their broom to listen to them.
Not only did Dean feel guilty like the others, but he was also a bit upset. Had Cas not liked their small kiss? It didn't mean anything at all! Though Dean would never admit that he
"Dean... last night, in my nightmare. It was my mother running from some man, who was trying to hurt her. Dean, it was that man in the picture."
And there will be a continuation of the search for the murderer of Mary Winchester.
Bobby's frown deepened. "Novak, you say? I think about it. Get back to you when it gets closer."
Nodding, Castiel agreed to that idea.
"Do you think it's time we go back?" Dean asks, looking at Cas
"She was beautiful," Cas says quietly.
Dean huffed from his spot on his bed. He and Sam were sitting in their motel room, trying to figure out what this was. With an eye roll, Dean began to pray for Cas to show himself.
Lupin stood there for a moment, his eyes on Castiel before stepping aside and letting the young wizard inside.
Lupin watched as the young boy left his office. The professor shook his head, "Minerva's right, that boy's going to be trouble." He whispered to himself.
Castiel and Dean lay separate from the others in their friend group. The pair of them lay facing the ceiling of the Great Hall, watching the stars that were shown above them. They stayed silent and just enjoyed each other's company.
Dean turns to Jack, "what- how? How did you-?"
As Cas led the way towards the outside of the school, Dean watched him from a few steps behind. Cas was almost definitely hiding something. But what? And why? So many questions popped into Dean's head because he could feel that the pure-blood wasn't telling the truth, or at least, the whole truth.
"My father..."
Stolen from my grasp
Over on a table, out of sight and unnoticed, an envelope with an unread letter was there. It was addressed to Chuck. In the return address spot on the letter where muggles would put their home address, there was just a name, one simple name.
The echo of your goodbye,
“Did you get hurt?” Dan asks him.
Castiel gives a nod. "Okay. I'll go check everything and make sure it's all running smoothly." The angel turns, his unfazed expression turning to one of suspicion.
Castiel, though not in the best mood, couldn't help but admire all of the little things that went into the castle's decor and architecture. Hogwarts was truly amazing.
"Danny, you can call me Donna, y'know," Donna reminded Dan.
WARNING: the following chapter includes a bit of fluff, a bit of angst, some wings, some mentions of the past and, of course, much gayness. Read at your own risk ;)
The almost day long ride on the train finally came to an end as the Hogwarts Express reached it's destination. Students were back in their school uniforms. The group of five made their way out of the train's exit with all the other students. Cas stayed close to Dean, not wanting to loose his mate in the crowd.
Realization hit Dean and he let out a small “oh.”
"Who knew you were so keen on Quidditch," Dean commented to Meg. Meg scowled at him.
"You just tried to kill yourself, Cas. After being affected by Freyja. Who is it?" Dean explains, his voice soft.
It was early July 2019, that Castiel died. Dean barely contacted anyone anymore. It had been a year and a half since Cas was taken. He spent his time alone in the Bunker. Sam had moved out with Eileen a few months back. When Dean wasn't in the Bunker, he was out on quick hunts. That was how he got all his anger out, hunts.
The Angel gets confused when he sees Dean once again not there. Where is Dean? What is he playing at?
Castiel looked over his short letter from Balthazar. Balthazar was going through a phase where he tried not to show that he cared for anyone at all. So, Cas was just glad he got a letter that had more than one word on it. Cas looked over the third and final one.
Before long, about half of the sleeping bags were taken up. The Great Hall was dark, the ceiling reflecting the beautiful, starry sky above all of the students.
"N-no," comes the reply from a flushed Castiel. Angels might not blush, but Castiel knew that if he could, his face would be bright red right now. "I guess I will be seeing you then, Dean Winchester."
Cas looks down at the note and reads it,
Dean walks over to him, looking sadly at the photo on the wall. "Yes, that's her. That's her with my dad."
"I'm right here-" Castiel tried. Neither Gabriel nor Lupin listened to him.
The Care of Magical Creatures professor turned to Lupin. “We’ll have to get him to the hospital wing before his second set of wings breaks through his skin and both sets start growing. It’ll be a painful day or two, but some medicine from there might help.”
It was a shorter class than Castiel thought it would be. So maybe he was in the bathroom longer than he believed. He didn't really keep track of the time while in there. For soon after, the Potions class ended and it was finally time for some lunch.
"Hi," she greeted smugly, "my name's Lisa Braedon. I was wondering if maybe I could hang out with you? I haven't exactly made a lot of friends yet and you look nice."
Dean went on to explain to Cas that he would take him over to the small Edleburry lake after pie. He didn't explain the lake in detail, but he did say it was quite beautiful. Cas nodded, interested in going. The deva didn't have his wings out, afraid that some feathers may accidentally get into the pie or his wings would just get into the way.
Was she?
"How does that work?" Dean asks, "your wings disappearing and reappearing?"
The two boys smiled at each other before turning together and walking out of the Panic Room, cautious of any students or teachers that may be passing by. With the coast cleared, Dean and Cas walked through the halls, eventually making it to the moving staircases.
"Dean. Dean Winchester."
Cas knew exactly what he was going to "dress up" as for tomorrow evening and he couldn't wait.
Gabriel got candy.
The journey to Bobby's house took about an hour. Mainly because Ellen had used a car to get to King's Cross and they couldn't just leave the car. On the drive back, Bobby (with help from Dean and a few extra comments from Gabe and Cas) explained to Sam about Cas' condition. Sam took the information really well. Which Cas was glad of.
"I am Castiel."
Cas looked around his room. "You've got a nice room," he comments.
First, thank you for reading this. I really hoped you enjoyed it, no matter how short it is.
"That is quite the friend group," Ellen says.
Shortly after Castiel went back to the classroom, the class ended and the students were free to go. Cas gathered his things and walked with Dean to their next class. The two of them walked throughout the castle and eventually made it to the castle grounds where the flying lessons would take place.
So... yeah. Hope you enjoyed. I honestly didn’t expect to finish this chapter today, but I did and I’m proud!
Not long after Dean's sorting, the last student was sorted. Everyone calmed down as the headmistress McGonagall stood up at the teacher's table.
Dean and Cas joined the gathered group of students, looking as confused as everyone else. None of the students knew what the class plan for today was nor what Lupin was planning to put them all through.
"For the holiday break, can I have a friend over?" Dean asks.
Cas shook his head. "No, I didn't do that," he says.
They eventually arrived back at Lupin's office and the sight inside was a bit different from when Lupin left. Castiel now had his shirt and uniform off, his top side showing. He still had his pants on, though. His wings were out and his back looked red, swollen. The young boy stood bent over above Lupin's desk, his arms below him and his hands resting on the table.
Dean's mouth fell open. "Whoa, really? That's so cool! Something like that hasn't happened since Harry Potter! The Chosen One! I have to admit I'm a bit jealous, but hey, just another year before I can get on the Gryffindor team and try to beat you at something. Wait- what position will you be playing?"
But Castiel was still unsure. Castiel wasn't one to look for more-than-platonic relationships. And he had only been on Earth so long.
"Jo's rules, not mine." Ellen gives a shrug and smiles.
Lupin's eyebrow rises and he crosses his arms. The professor has an idea what Castiel is talking about, but waits for Cas himself to say it. "That depends on what your secret is." Lupin pauses. "If you do not wish to tell me, I understand."
“Lemme guess,” Gabe said, looking at Dean, “you’re the boy my brother never shuts up about? Dean, right?”
“You, my friend, are a deva,” Garth started.
“Hello, dear,” the school nursed greeted him. She took out some other medicine. “Here, this will help with the pain.”
to be dared to kiss Cas. He did not think his first kiss with a boy would end up like that.
The brothers stood up and Bobby led them to the front door. Bobby then stepped back to give them some space.
"Hey Cassie, do you think hot chocolate tastes as good as the humans say it does?"
"Dean?"
Sam nods, "that's cool."
"Yeah. We run a car fixing company. It's not very big but it's alright."
Everyone on the field mounted their brooms.
Cas takes a breath and goes back into the changing room. Dan personally wishes Cas good luck before briefly giving the Hufflepuff team a pep talk to get the team ready for the game.
The four of them arrived at the Potions classroom and found a table set for four and sat down. Meg had her wand out as well as a couple other books. Her wand had a dragon heartstring core, blackthrone wood and was 10 inches long.
This went on for a bit, Dan tossing faster and faster moving objects. On about the fourth ball, Castiel caught the moving object with only one try and no mistakes.
Charlie laughs, "sure it's not. Just wait a year or two and you'll be together. I bet it." Dean laughs along with Charlie's teasing.
Castiel stayed back to keep up the researching and find a way to stop Freyja from harming anyone else. It was a few hours into looking through Sam's laptop and going on multiple websites, did Cas decide to take a break.
"The Vicky Novak you describe, Professor, doesn't sound like the Vicky Novak I knew when I was born. She left less than a day after. I'm still told that it's my fault she left, but if she's that great of a person, why would she leave?" Castiel asks, his voice weak.
Time skips coming soon ^v^
Which made Dean ask how fast Cas could fly with his wings. Only to remember, a second later, that Cas hadn't used his wings in a long time.
“That trenchcoat will not be destroyed permanently. It may rip, get dirty and get old, but it will always rebuild itself, brand new as before,” Lupin explains.
McGonagall waved her hand and a feast appeared on each table. A few first year students gasped excitedly when they saw the food appear right in front of their eyes.
It was the night before Halloween. There was another four-house sleepover going on in the Great Hall. The Great Hall was already filled multiple fall decorations, including floating jack-o-lanterns, fake bats, and streamers. The pumpkins weren't currently lit, but there were plenty surrounding the hall.
Dean's eyebrows furrowed as the idea of Cas' wings being real crossed his mind, but he didn't believe it.
“Well I’m a bit new on the whole mate-thing as well. But I think just simple things. Garth mentioned heat, but that shouldn’t come until way later. A-and it doesn’t have to be like we’re dating or something, cause we aren’t! I think you just need to help me occasionally with any wing troubles.” Cas explained, his face heating up a bit as he rambled slightly.
Dean nods. "Thanks, Bobby."
This was true, November 1 was the first scheduled Quidditch game that involved Hufflepuff. Gryffindor and Ravenclaw had played last week, so now it was Hufflepuff’s turn. Cas was nervous about it. Like really nervous. But that was not the main thing on his mind right now.
As the sheriff goes to get the cake she brought, Dean looks back at the picture. His eyes linger on Castiel's figure. Dean shakes his head sadly and puts the picture down. Oh, how much he misses Cas.
Cas smiled and continued to chase after a few more charmed golf balls before Dan finally called him down, saying that this had been more than enough practice for now. Dan grinned at Castiel, this year, the Hufflepuffs were sure to win most of the Quidditch games with Cas on their team.
