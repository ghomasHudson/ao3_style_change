“What happened?” he asked.  His throat was scratchy and Cas knew it was from lack of use.
Dean blushed at Cas’ words.  He had been exhausted when Jimmy finished with him and he only vaguely remembered Jimmy carrying him into Cas’ room before he passed out.  Dean shifted a little and realized that he wasn’t in any pain at all physically, but he still should have been up to get breakfast tended to.
“Don’t you be disrespectful to me boy, I know how to take care of that attitude.”  John’s voice was low and dangerous.  At one time Dean would have been on his knees with his neck bared to spare himself and Sammy whatever punishment his dad thought was warranted.  Not anymore though.
When the weather had started to warm Michael called him and asked him what he was interested in doing for the company.  Cas didn’t really have any particular interest in anything and was toying with the idea of going overseas, possibly to England with Balthazar but he wasn’t feeling anything particular calling to him.
Heat.  Dean was going into heat.
Cas pressed a kiss to where he had bitten him and Dean shivered.  Cas pulled back and kissed Dean’s mouth again.
“You’re working too hard, Dean,” he said. “I’ll finish up the last few things.  You go sit down and relax.”
Convinced Cas would stop him, he gently leaned forward and pressed their lips together.  Dean held himself still and let Cas set the pace.  He was surprised when his mate tilted his head and slanted their lips together, opening his mouth.  Dean slipped his tongue into the wet heat and groaned.  Cas felt so good, and he missed his mate’s touch.
A solemn look came over Dean’s face and Cas knew it wasn’t good.  “I don’t know, Cas.  She was pretty bad off besides the boar.  She looked like she’d been in the woods on her own for a while.  I don’t know what an unmated omega was doing wandering around off of her pack lands, but she was half starved and had almost no smell under the fear and pain.  The boar got her underarm sliced open pretty deep from her elbow down almost to her wrist.  Tessa got the wound wrapped as quickly as she could, but she had lost a lot of blood.  I’m not sure if she’ll make it.”
“Alright, that’s enough, both of you.”  His father’s alpha voice was not enough to make him obey as it did his mother, but he was shaken out of his red haze sufficiently to get his own alpha under control again.  “Sit down, both of you.”  His father’s voice was quieter but still held the alpha undertone.  His mother sank gracefully back onto the sofa, but glared at them both.  Cas followed slowly.
As Cas began to exhaust himself again he calmed down to hiccups and sniffles.  He didn’t open his eyes, but he heard Tessa’s soft voice.
Cas listened and gave Dean advice where he asked for it and suggestions on a few things they hadn’t thought of.  He asked Dean if they had done Garth’s pyre and Dean told him it was set for that night.
Dean nodded silently.
His nose twitched at the scent of a second omega in the space.  He didn’t normally have any trouble with other omegas, but he felt threatened by Eileen.  Last night he had hoped that he would be able to cook for his mate and they would share the space together.  Cas talked about taking Dean grocery shopping but didn’t elaborate about what he assumed Dean’s responsibilities would be.  Dean thought it had been clear what he wanted, but maybe it wasn’t.
Dean tried to take a deep breath but the pain lancing through his chest was worse when he did so.  He whimpered and clutched at Cas as the alpha drew the cool cloth over his skin once more.
Cas was nervous, Dean could tell.  He smiled at the alpha.  “Of course, Cas.  I love this place, I’m just surprised.”
They lay like that for a few minutes in silence, just enjoying their quiet time together before the day began.  Dean broke the silence with a sigh.
Mary had insisted that he and Dean make some changes with the furniture and decorations of the sitting rooms and offices to make it their own.  Cas and Dean did so, and after that, Cas settled into the rooms completely.  He enjoyed having Eileen and Charlie and Mary to sit with him for tea or to play with Aiden.  They planned Eileen and Sam’s mating ceremony that was set for Samhain at the end of October.
“What do you mean?” he asked.  He was worried now.
When they entered the infirmary, Tessa led him straight back to one of the private rooms.  She had prepared for Cas’ return already and Dean was relieved to see that she was ready to help him.
“Love you more,” Dean replied.
“Ok,” Dean agreed quietly.
“I don’t deserve you, Dean,” Cas told him breathlessly.
“Daddy you look nice!” Emma exclaimed when he came down the stairs.
Dean began to realize that Cas really was a romantic because he took him on a day trip to Weston, MO at the beginning of November.  It was colder than it had been but Dean was touched that Cas wanted to take him to the Old Red Bridge where they could “lock their love.”  The bridge was a replica of the famous one in Europe where couples could place a lock on the bridge.  Cas brought one for him and Dean, and Dean had kissed him until their fingers were blue.
His mind was both sluggish and running a mile a minute.  Cas had been with another omega last night.  He probably hadn’t actually done anything since they were in public, but he could have marked her.
“It was good.  It’s hard when they are late classes like this.”  Cas nodded and shut the door.
“What do you mean?”
“Dean, it doesn’t define you, you know.  You are perfect for me.  In every single way.  I never stopped thinking of you.  My friends tried to set me up, but it never went anywhere.  No one smelled like you.  No one smelled like home to me.”
Dean appreciated that Cas was there with him, but didn’t press him to talk.  He continued to think through everything that Charlie had said and how he felt about it all.  The fact that Charlie was willing to come over and try and apologize to him in person said something to Dean.  He knew that she was sorry for her behavior, but he wasn’t sure if he would be able to move past it.  What was there to say that she wouldn’t do it again, or fall back into the same patterns?
him but I need more time to get to know the guy behind the awesome scent and ask myself the question "Do I really want to date a dude that is 14 years older than me?" I don't understand why you can't see this shit."
“Hey uhm…. I feel kinda stupid for asking this but… and I know we did a lot until now with uhm…pe … penises touching which is not a good idea to do… unprotected… but we’re going to fifth base and that is…”
at you.”
The beta gestured to the three seats in front of him. Ellen took the one on the right, but the brothers hesitated, while Cas went straight for the couch on the side, sitting relaxed in the sun. For a moment Dean wanted nothing more than to curl up on the alpha's lap and admire his beautiful eyes in the sun but he remembered where he was and why so he pushed Sam and the brothers took the last two seats in front of Crowley.
is very vulnerable. But you can’t expect me
"Sir, if I may talk to Dean?"
“Maybe it’s best, yeah”
A middle-aged woman came behind them, dragging a teenage daughter. “Honestly Barbara, you shouldn’t be wearing these things. If you complain more I won’t even buy the flannel.” The girl closed her mouth tight and stayed behind her mother. “Look at all this”, she carried on gesturing to the closest band tee, one featuring Godsmack, “Satanists, godless people. It’s a sin even to be here.”
Dean heard Cas shuffle and change position. “Now, I want you to touch your hole. Color?”
“Cas, it’s a bit chilly outside, we should, erm, go in?”
“Not much… I mean the usual speeches and um… yeah, the usual rhetoric you would hear from a guy that was raised in rural Kansas and was a Marine,” his older brother shrugged, sipping more of the tea.
. To avenge
Dean had hoped for a nice drive but it was more of a drag as traffic was a nightmare. He kept shifting from 1 to 2 and back to 1 in a standstill.
“Oh my gods.” Sam groaned. "I'm going to kill Gabe."
Dean's eyes shot up at the annoyed tone. He searched the alpha's body language noting the slightly stiffer stance. "Are you jealous?"
"The new Lizzo…"
“Sure, I’ll text you… “
” one of the assailants yelled at the other but fell immediately after, a gunshot wound to his forehead.
Dean deleted the text at looked miserably at the phone screen. Cas was typing something so the omega waited.
Benny told Dean about his niece and his parents and the omega beamed knowing his friend was finally happy.
“We should watch The Princess Bride one day.” Dean smiled.
“I see. Well…do you want to
"How about we check the motel TV? Maybe there is some Scooby-Doo on," Dean offered.
“Get lost losers”
“It’s the mafia, what the fuck, Charlie?” Dean leaned forward, anxious. “They
“I find meditation beneficial, yoga to be more exact.”
“Oh my god, is that Benny?” Kevin interrupted Dean and Becky’s bickering.
"So what are we going to wear to Spring Fling?" Becky took the lead to shift the dynamic to happy thoughts although Dean's scent soured at the prospect of missing out on the dance. He had nothing to wear so he didn't buy a ticket.
The two Novaks started a discussion with Sam about the rise and fall of their empire, about what they liked or hated about their history. Castiel gave Sam a thin book written by a Russian historian in English. Dean was happy to see his brother so enthusiastic. He almost started purring when he felt Castiel's hand on his thigh, working his inner muscles.
“Okay, Dean. I have to go, Rufus has eyes on the perp. I’ll talk to you later.”
“The vessels made from holy clay will be infertile”. Cas shrugged.
Dean returned victorious with two humongous cotton candy sticks one pink and one white both looking like clouds torn from the sky. He handed the white one to Eileen.
“I see. Would you require my assistance with these vampires?”
Eventually they returned to Sam and Eileen only to find the chaise lounges empty. Dean went to get beer and snacks. They laid down close to each other, with beers, waiting for the others, talking about everything and nothing.
“Dad never scent marked us,” Sam said in a small voice. Dean took a breath and tried to keep his voice steady. “Dad scent-marked us when we were younger. He stopped scent-marking me when I presented and I guess he… uhm left the job with me. Now eat your sandwich, jerk, we’ll be late for school” Dean got up abruptly and started packing Sam’s backpack before doing his own. They both went through their routine without talking. They walked in the unforgiving rain to school and when they got there they were soaking wet despite the umbrella. Sam scurried over to his middle school and Dean entered the high school. This time around they were close to each other as the schools his Dad enrolled them in shared a courtyard. The fact that he enrolled them in school meant his Dad wanted to stay at least until the end of the school year. That meant almost four more months.
"What are you doing, Cas?"
Dean gulped when he chanced a look at Castiel. This wasn't his sweet alpha that enjoyed cuddles and nuzzled in his neck. No, this was the mafia boss, fuming, snarling, pumping out the minty scent of his
“How the fuck do you know all this shit. Did you take AP biology or something?”
“Yes. Dean and I are together. We’ve been together since I came back. I… I actually flew back because Dean called me.”
“Join me?”
Dean was close to tears and just sank on the couch, feeling like the walls were closing in on him.
Sam sighed heavily and turned to Cas in the backseat.
“No.”
bad. But it's hard to surpass that shithole we stayed in Austin last year."
Dean locked his eyes in the deepest blue he ever saw.
“For homosexual relationships?”
"Yup. Told'ya."
“Ol boaluahe”
“I believe you called me a holy accountant several times.”
“I’m going to go for a shower. Cas, will you go and get us some grub? I’ll have a cheeseburger, pie DON’T FORGET THE PIE and beer. Sam surely wants some rabbit food.” Dean was already out of the garage.
“No. I don’t think that I do. I would like to kiss him whenever I like. I don’t even know when or where I can touch him. I just… wait for him to do something or say something. Sometimes he’ll kiss me regardless of people around us other times he’ll sit as far away from me as possible. I know he doesn’t want anyone we know to know. It’s…. I feel bad because I told him I’m fine with hiding but now that we actually are together I want more.”
killing him slowly, as he was unable to talk to Cas. The alpha did not respond to his text, most likely fast asleep after the steamy session.
“Yeah, kid?”
“You’re Uncle Cas”
“Rise and shine Sammy” Dean bellowed while dancing to Heat of the moment. Sam groaned his displeasure so Dean turned the volume higher before he went back to the PB and J sandwiches he was preparing.
Cas nodded so Dean opened the door and left.
Mild spoilers bellow / reassurance
"Yes, it's all very romantic. They meet and they scent each other and they KNOW they're meant for each other, that they are true mates, but the omega says she can't be with him because her family will never approve but he gives her a claiming bite and whisks her away".
“It seems God IS omnipotent, Sam. Jack pulled me from the Empty, again. Restored my grace, restored my wings. I am in perfect working condition. I haven’t been whole since before Metatron stole my grace but now I am 100% back.” Cas smiled at the towering hunter.
“Cas, I don’t think Sammy is…uh… gay. And how do YOU know about college and experimenting?”
"Okay." Cas squeezed his hand and released it in order to type the reply.
“Listen, last time you gripped me tight you pushed me away so you could sacrifice yourself. I don’t want that memory, okay? Can you put your handprint on me again?” they were staring each other down. Cas had a hungry look on his face. “You want to be marked by me?” Cas whispered, eyes filled with hunger and lust.
“Perfect! I haven’t slept this well in years. Usually, there are nightmares… Hell, Dad, Chuck…losing you… but since we’ve been together there hasn’t been one.”
“It is. Hey Cas…”
"I would like it if you could think about moving. I don't like the idea of you two living there."
"That is not your business, madam" she turned to Dean "The usual table is ready, sir."
“Oh Cas….” Claire softened looking at the angel “you see, people have made these… predetermined roles for men and women. Society really woke up and said boys can’t cry or boys can’t like silly pink drinks or girls can’t like guns or girls can’t fight. A lot of people, actually a majority of people think that is just how it should be. They find comfort in this I guess. That’s why they eyed you - they expected you to be mad because I made you a silly pink drink - real men aren’t supposed to like silly girly pink drinks. Real men can’t love other men and so forth.” she gave him a pointed look, arching an eyebrow.
“Sir?”
out loud but the words died behind his lips.
“Do you remember that time when I was… 12 when I tried to fight that alpha that lived in the apartment below us? Back in
"Oh and uhm… this isn't "practicing instincts", sir. He did actually mark me as
“Think of it more as an independent contractor kind of thing. He goes up, helps with the rebuilt. Advises Jack. He’s never gone more than a few hours and he’s already been up there for 2.”
“One day, yes.”
Dean fell asleep with a smile on his face.
"Your younger brother will remain under her guardianship until you are emancipated and legally an adult then she can relinquish the guardianship to you."
The day went past slow. But ever since that day Wednesdays always lasted excruciatingly long.
"I'm sorry?"
Dean didn’t need to answer with words. Sam wished he’d taken a separate car from the bunker.
"You don't sound fine. You sound… off. I know this… isn't ideal in any way but you
“Dean, I….”
“Hello, Dean.” His voice was ruined but so deep it made another wave of slick rush out of the omega.
“We’ve known each other for almost 13 years.” Dean continued. ”We… uh met on the job. I thought he was kind of a junkless dick at the beginning but he grew on me. We’ve been friends ever since.”
"And this is the second?" Cas tilted his head, squinted his eyes.
“I thought those weren’t very safe. Don’t they fuck your system?” Now Dean was truly worried. The heat suppressants were not the safest. The heat that would come after you stopped them almost always required hospitalization. Dean wondered how bad the rut suppressants could be.
Cas licked Dean’s bottom lip, catching it between his teeth, eliciting a moan from the hunter’s throat. Dean opened his mouth, granting permission and Cas licked the insides, going in for a deep passionate kiss. He put the fingers of his right hand in the dark blonde hair while cupping Dean’s jaw with the other. Dean was lost in sensation, pressing his hands on Cas’ lower back, pulling him closer, closer, pressing his hips onto his own, sliding his hands on his asscheeks and placing them in the jean’s back pockets.
“Dean” the little alpha puffed, pulling bitch face no 17. Dean sighed. Sam was too smart for his own good sometimes. Of course, the thirteen-year-old saw enough of the envelope to correctly estimate the amount of money and just adding up rent and food, they surpassed that amount last Friday and Sam guessed it.
Dean followed Cas’ advice and went to the motel. He took a long shower then crashed to sleep. He woke up when his phone kept ringing like crazy. It was Sam. Shit. He forgot about Sam.
As long as I breathe you will never be alone.” Cas sighed. “I owe Ellen a good bottle of vodka. Text me your address and I’ll be there.”
. Before Sam could straighten up and ask Dean if he was hit by a sudden illness, his brother stirred awake. As the younger and curious sibling, Sam pretended he was asleep.
, well, I am *air quotations*
"Did you say penthouse?"
“It would be … “Bene antiquis”, I believe” Cas was scrunching his face. “I haven’t really used Latin lately, it’s not that popular anymore”
“The thought didn’t cross my mind” Cas was honest.
“You don’t know?”
was the one to take care of Sam, he wouldn't be doing
Dean scented himself and found lingering smells of his fear, of alpha release, blood, and a hint of tobacco. He clung to the tobacco even though he quickly realized it was the smell of cigars and not Castiel’s natural scent. It wasn’t his fault the alpha smelled so damn good to him. Sam was just a young Alpha, barely presented, and still had a lot to learn about scents and how to read them.
"Not… really ideal when you share a room with your Dad and brother."
Dean complied and sighed with relief when Cas’ hands were massaging his scalp. It felt so good to be cared for. Next Cas picked up the sponge and started scrubbing Dean’s body from head to toes, placing chaste kisses in the path of the sponge. Dean was elated, he’d never felt so at peace.
“I do not.”
“We’ve been uh… kind of a thing since he came back. I… uhm, wanted to tell but I never knew how, I just…”
"Dean, I wanted to ask you why did you hesitate to call me your alpha?" Cas asked as they set the pizzas on the coffee table in front of the couch. Mouldy oranges hit the omega's nose.
“Can Dean take me to his school dance?” Jo pleaded with her mom.
Dean looked Ellen in the eyes and saw only kindness which broke him down. Crying he sagged in the nearest seat and told Ellen about their running away, Creepy Guy and Gabe being in the hospital.
"You gave a nice show up there. Scent clear of fear or surprise. You barely flinched. Like the boss’ mate should be", his eyes flicked to Cas then back on Dean. "I should say, the advice I gave you the first time stands even more true now". He turned back to Cas "Thank you, sir". Balthazar gave Cas a curt nod before leaving them alone.
Dean struggles to come out to Sam and Eileen.
The receptionist handed them their keys, which Sam had to take because Dean didn’t seem to notice the receptionist dangling them. Sam patted Dean on the back to get his focus back and the party for four left for the elevators.
Cas showed up in grey sweats and a faded black tee. He added his soiled jeans to the machine and started its cycle. The smell of their combined releases lingered in the room.
"I'm Serghei Sidorov."
“You are a mouthy one.”
"Yes, that is adequate. I cannot see the bruises anymore."
“Well then I guess you don’t like the secrecy”
About me? I passed my driver's exam. My family issues got worse. Work is a bitch. I love this fic to bits.
“No… he’s not in our cafeteria. He’s not in high school actually.”
"So you want to stay here?" Sammy asked. “With him? Be his omega?”
arousal spiked in Dean and as soon as Cas ended the phone call he surged forwards and kissed him passionately. “You’re so fucking hot, alpha”. Dean said between kisses. He swiped his tongue over the alpha’s lips, asking for permission, which was given so he slid inside the alpha’s mouth. They were kissing with abandon now, intertwined so deeply they weren’t sure where one ended and the other started. Cas caught Dean’s hips, lifting him and dropping him on the car’s trunk. Dean opened his legs to accommodate the alpha between them, petting his chest and ribs. “
“Yes, alpha, I’m so wet, just for you.” He was pumping himself fast by now and it wasn’t enough so he added a second finger, enjoying the stretch and repeating Cas’ name like a prayer. The alpha was peppering praise and love words in his ears, edging him on so he added a third.
Cas was admiring the view from the balcony. Seemingly endless body of water, screeching seagulls, heat, sand, he understood Dean’s fascination with it. It was beautiful. He felt the hunter’s arms on his waist and then the weight of a head resting on his shoulder. He turned his head to place a chaste kiss on the cheek.
Sam looked at the watch again: 11:30 am. Cas and Dean hadn’t come out yet and Sam was almost afraid to go knocking. If he was right about this then it was the ending of at least 10 years of pining and unresolved sexual tension. It meant Dean could be happy for the first time in forever. So Sam waited patiently, looking for cases, sending memes to Eileen. His phone buzzed, he had a reply from his girlfriend.
“Mind your damn business” Claire growled
"Me?"
“Sure, but I am not changing my mind.”
"Yes. Most of them are Bratva related, some I did for me."
It took them 20 minutes to gather everything they owned and pile it in front of the door. Dean had Sam wait next to the duffle bags while he sprayed scent neutralizers and picked up hairs and other things. He snagged the motel blankets and threw them for Sam to catch. With one last glance at what was their home for the last 8 weeks, they picked up the duffle bags and left. Dean locked the door and threw the keys in the grass, looking around to make sure no one saw them. An eerie silence enveloped them and Dean suppressed a shiver. He was actually doing this, actively choosing to leave his father. With Sam laying in the backseat as exhaustion caught up with the young boy, Dean started the car and drove them away. He let New York's roads guide him for a while but at some point, he realized he had to stop somewhere so he could also sleep. He pulled up at a gas station and brought sun shades for the windshield and windows, along with some wet wipes and a car phone charger. He drove to a 24/7 Walmart and parked at the far end, hoping the employees wouldn't care enough about his lone-ass parking all night to come asking questions. Dean stuck the semi-opaque mesh window sun shades on and then he wrestled with the silver sunshade for the windshield. He tucked Sam in with one of the motel blankets, lowered the driver's seat as much as possible and pulled the other blanket over him.
“Uh-huh”
"Nah-uh. No. Driver picks the music, shotgun shuts his cakehole," Dean threw his unlocked phone at Cas. The alpha caught it.
"I never…. had this, you know. Just casual flings, the kind you don't… call girlfriend or boyfriend. I am glad we're boyfriends." Dean leaned into the alpha nuzzling in his neck.
“Good,” the alpha purred the word.
“Claire called me Dad. I don’t understand why, Jimmy is dead and I’m not her father.”
"You fight very well, Dean," Nikolay commented.
“Hello, erm, it was good, erm, sir.” Sam waved awkwardly before flinging himself in the bathroom.
I want to make the next chapter a bit longer to include Dean and Sam's school experience and introduce some beloved characters. It will be awhile as I have shifts Friday and Saturday
They ended up at the Roadhouse much earlier because an unforgiving rain and a sudden temperature drop made sitting in the car that much more uncomfortable. Ellen caught them both in a mama bear hug and insisted they eat “real food” serving them with tomato cream soup in the kitchen. Dean liked it there very much, it was warm and homey and he felt safe. Jo was doing her homework next to them, chatting them up. The kitchen wasn’t very big, the staff (one cook, one cooking aide and a dishwasher) were going on with their business while the teens were crowded in an old diner booth set in the far back corner of the room.
"Why not?"
Dean circled his slippery hole and then, under Cas’ praise he slid a finger inside his scorching heat, giving out a low moan and he began to thrust in himself. He heard Cas’ breath getting shallow and fast.
. The third member, the chef, could only be seen when the waiters opened the kitchen door.
“I’m fine. I told you I am back 100% this time.” Cas mumbled in his neck. ”Just shut up”
“Hey, we’re one man short, come on. Just try, okay?” Rick patted him with the other hand on the chest.
"You're aroused."
"Here, you drive, I feel a bit tired."
Dean softened a bit. “I’m fine, Benny”
Claire shoved solo cups with beer in their faces much sooner than they expected her to come back
"Possessive Alpha, then," she whistled like a wolf.
CAS. I KNOW”
Cas.”
“I think you should take a warm shower and we’ll watch something on TV, okay?”
“M’fine.”
. His mind was baffled by the notion. The judge looked through the documents that Crowley had brought forward. “So, what happened?”
”Yeah, I’m a delivery boy, you know, deliver food to hungry people and all sorts of other packages”
"Oh… I would love to eat some pies but I don't think they fit."
They kissed lightly before heading hand in hand to the kitchen.
glare “Are you blackmailing me?”
“I locked myself in a motel room and just wait it out, used my fingers for…
“Well… fair enough. Benny?”
“Oh you…”
“That’s kinda… old. He’s...14 years older than you” Charlie said.
“Glad to hear the streets will be safer.” Dean faked a small laugh as he knew Bobby was too far away to help them.
Dean felt like he would throw up the stew. He could almost scent himself, bitter, acidic apples laced with the decaying scent of desperation. He never heard Sam call him “dada” since the boy was three. He uncurled, allowing Sam to rise and strip. Dean left him to it, closing the bathroom door. There he was, all alone in the middle of the room. Dean let himself fall on the ground, his scent going haywire. It had a note he never smelled on himself, decaying apples and burnt cinnamon. He felt something grip his insides tight and yanking them. He couldn’t breathe. He fumbled with his phone, searching for the contact details. He pressed the call button through his blurry vision. He was somewhat aware that he was crying.
“You’re mad at me.” Dean was on the verge of tears
Dean was annoyed and a sudden flush of protectiveness for Castiel washed through him.
think about the alpha fucking him seven ways to Sunday in the bathroom the clearer the image was in his head. He was distantly aware that his aroused scent must permeate in the hallway. After a few minutes, Castiel joined him. Dean shoved him against the wall and started kissing him like he was a drowning man and Cas was air. He needed his alpha to touch him
Dean brought Sam the PB&J and sat down in front of him on the other bed,
“Yes… oh yes, alpha, just for you.” He slid the toy inside his heat and started thrusting slowly. They picked up the rhythm, breathing raggedly, moaning sweet nothings to each other and Dean came untouched all over the towel, the fake knot buried deep inside his pink hole. Cas was purring in his ear. “So good for me, pet, so good. One day I’ll lick you clean.” Hearing that Dean almost came all over again.
“I think that is smart. You should stay independent. I’m thinking I should do the same. I feel… trapped and I have been for a while. I tried to talk to my parents but they just shut me down and told me “alphas will be alphas”, also reminding me Brad is the son of some family friends.”
Cas intertwined his fingers with Deans “I know. Me too”
"Either way, didn't he deserve to be judged by his peers and doesn't he deserve justice now?" Kevin asked with his nose buried in the article. “It seems he was tortured before he was killed.”
Charlie turned the laptop towards them and Dean saw Creepy Guy, a bit younger, staring at him in his NYPD formal uniform. He swallowed his food, maintaining a cool exterior while freaking out on the inside.
“Call me an old man again and I’ll shoot you. How is John?” There was no heat behind Bobby’s words and Dean missed the gruff bounty hunter.
“That sounds good, Dean. You’ve talked a lot about that beach vacation.” Sam acknowledged
“What the Hell Cas?!”
They stayed like that, embraced, watching the ocean together for a few more minutes before they decided they should head to breakfast.
“Not yours dude, Sam and Eileen’s.”
"A sound advice. Balthazar is a good man."
“Ah, Jessica is going.”
Cas seemed blissfully unaware.
“Talk to Ellen, see when she can come to
“Dean is right Claire. If you had someone with you it would have been fine. I agree with Dean. It will be safer if we came.”
“Cas is a nickname bruh”
Dean heard himself answer. “I’ll manage. I always have.” He felt his face muscles raise in a small smile.
"Well, this is pretty incriminating stuff here. Yeah, granted it is encoded but still… Most of the couriers are men that were either born in the Bratva or have been with us for several years. You must really be something if the boss gave you this job. I am looking forward to watching you grow with us, in the pack." He gave Dean a tight hug.
Cas kissed Dean again.
Cas frowned as Dean picked a small ladle and started scooping up batter and leaving it to drip back in the bowl. ”See? This consistency is what you look for. Too runny and you need to add flour, too thick and you need to add milk. It’s not very hard.”
“Why are you so afraid Dean?”
instinct to mark the omega they are... involved with."
Sam found him and they curled in one another in the old booth, taking comfort in each other's scents.
, they were some of the best things he ever ate. Gabriel was puffing out his chest, glad he could make the younger omega happy. Castiel was doting on him from the other side, enveloping him in a cloud of protective alpha scent. His inner omega was reduced to chanting over and over again
“Of course, Dean, you’re way too young. Pregnancy is recommended after 19 years of age.”
“Why what?’
"It's either individual or collaborative in pairs of two. Kevin and Charles paired up, do you want to do it with me?"
“Dean” Cas put his scowl on “I heard you say your pies are the best in Kansas. And you always go on about how I taste.”
“What?” Dean raised an eyebrow.
"No."
“Did you ask him to do that?”
“Do we get to kiss now?”
“Really Dean?”
Cas tried to clean up the glass as fast as possible. When he finally finished he lept up and found Dean still frozen to the same spot.
“I hope things will stay the same between us Cas.”
“Why? Sex joke?” Dean wiggled his eyebrows, chuckling.
Dean blushed as red as a cherry tomato.
Curiosity got the best of him and he sat down with Sam and tried to eat as quick as he could while still savouring the amazing meal.
“Dean you sounded really scared. Would you like to talk about it?”
Cas smiled shyly, “They’re all filled with songs I’d thought you’d like that you didn’t already have. I can replace them if you don’t like them.”
The woman smiled, “Glad you asked. I can go grab a pamphlet for you.” Dean nodded and turned back to numerous bags of soil. He grabbed a purple bag that said “10% more plant growth guaranteed!” in big yellow letters.
Dean smirked and pulled Cas closer to him, “This is my date,” He stated proudly. Ellen narrowed her eyes at both of them, causing Cas to shrink into Dean. She stayed silent and gestured for them to sit down.
Dean breathed out in relief.
Dean snorted, “It’s only 7:30.”
“Yeah...I have a small bee farm in my backyard.”
“Sure. What do you wanna know?”
“You stink.”
Cas blushed, “Nothing..just open the card. It’s important.” Dean raised his eyebrows and started and looked at the card in hand. It was blue with little Bee stickers all over it.
“No, Dean. It’s just important.”
“I love it, Dean. Thank you.”
Dean gaped and dramatically placed a hand over his heart. He hung his head and trudged to the bathroom. Hearing Cas huff out a laugh as he exited.
“Night Cas,” Dean kissed him one more time, “See you tomorrow.”
Dean thought for a second, “Yes actually, do you have any flowers that attract bees?”
He has caught himself daydreaming what their wedding would be like...would they settle down? Have kids? Maybe get a dog?
Dean, of course, jumped at the chance to show Cas his Baby. “I drove. Don't worry.” He excitedly led them over to his 1967 Chevy Impala.
“Homemade honey?”
Cas sighed reluctantly, he was very much interested in this movie...and Dean said it was okay. He smiled, pressing remote until the bee movie was highlighted again, “Alright Dean.” He pressed play.
“Well, it’s ready to go. I’ll be seeing you tomorrow then, I guess.” Dean grinned, looking forward to it already.
Not to say that Dean wasn’t making preparations for the holiday of course. He just hoped that Cas would be satisfied. He wanted his gift to be useful and well thought out and not some cheap box of chocolates and a card he picked up at the local general store.
“I had not thought of what to do after we escaped. What is your favourite place to eat, Dean?”
“Of course nothing will change Dean.” Cas sighed, “I can’t believe you would think that. I told you that I love you. Nothing will change that.”
“I grabbed you something-I know it’s not much but,” He held out a Zeppelin track. “I know you liked it-and were complaining about his songs never being on the radio.”
“What was that about? Are you two fighting again?”
Recently his...
Dean grinned, “Told you. Best pie in Kansas.”
“You left. I had to wake alone on Valentine’s day.”
“Yes but...Love, love? It wasn’t just a heat of the moment thing?”
As they were eating, Cas kept glancing over to Dean but he would look away as soon as Dean looked up. It was quite adorable.
He smiled a bit because the man looked bored too. From what he could hear, it sounded like his date was talking about football. Dean jumped when the dude made eye-contact with him- he quickly offered a small smile and ducked his head, trying to return his attention to his real date.
Dean snorted, “You talk weird, man.”
“Yes could. The fastest we do the faster tomorrow comes.”
Dean jolted up from the couch “No, no, no! Don’t hurt him! It was my fault!” he muttered to himself seeming to not be realizing where he is.
“Charlie!  Oh, please don’t make me laugh,” Cas told her clutching his ribs.
“No, Dean, really.  Cas doesn’t care.  He knows that you have a past and he knew it when you mated.  He won’t tell you this, but I know he understands that you had to live and you made the best out of the circumstances that you had.  He knows that it wasn’t a good life, and you did what you had to to survive and in a lot of ways he’s proud of you for that.  What he doesn’t like though, are alphas talking about you now that you’re his mate.”
“Actually, he’s just got one omega now.  Me.  See, I’m his mate, and regardless of what you think or want or do, it’s going to stay that way.  And look, lady, it doesn’t say anything good about you that you’re trying to intimidate me so that you can hit on a mated alpha.  My alpha.  It makes you look cheap and desperate, so just back off and leave us alone.”
Ellen nodded and Cas heard Bobby grumble under his breath. Cas turned to him and Bobby just shook his head.
“I should have guessed.  Cas-“
Dean pulled back and laughed.  Cas had brought him many different take out dishes and treats over the months, but to be able to go out and enjoy something in the café was different.  “Careful, alpha.  What are you insinuating?” he asked playfully.
Dean hugged him tightly and laughed.  “Pup’s making his presence known and I need new pants.  Mine technically still fit, but the maternity ones in the tux were much more comfortable than having mine pressed against my belly.”
“I wasn’t sure…” he said with a shrug.  “So, then, now what?”
“Two,” Dean mumbled.
They were interrupted then by the banker, back with Dean’s shiny new card for shopping.
Dean looked around to see that both of the other alphas were staring at them.  Their presents had been opened and set aside and Dean wondered if Jimmy had tried to get their attention before.  Dean flushed slightly and cleared his throat.  He glanced down at Cas who also seemed to be a little flushed but who was also glaring at his brother.
Ellen patted his hand and turned to look at him. “It’s no problem.  I’m just glad we can help.”  She paused and looked at him.  Dean shifted under her gaze.  “Why don’t you sit down for a minute?  Bobby and Emma won’t be back for a while.”  She phrased it like a question, but Dean knew she wanted to talk and she meant to talk to him.  He should be grateful she waited until he had finished eating.  Dean took a seat, sitting down heavily and folding his arms across his chest.
Cas was wearing jeans and one of those sweaters with the big collar and half zipper.  It wasn’t Dean’s style at all, but paired with Cas’ loafers and five o’clock shadow, Dean could definitely appreciate the look.
Cas shook his head.  “He said no, but I wanted to bring something up anyway.”
Cas smiled at him and pulled a mug from the cabinet and set it on the counter.  “Have as much as you like.  I’m going to fix some breakfast, ok?  I was thinking bacon and eggs,” he said to Dean.
Thanks for the comments and kudos, guys!  They are appreciated so much!
“Yes, alpha,” he responded.  He continued to move forward and Cas let him go.  When they reached his bedroom Dean had barely crossed the threshold when Cas was on him again.  “Cas, door.  We have to shut and lock the door.  Emma.”  Dean was panting, but he knew he had to make sure that they had privacy.  Cas nipped his neck one more time then he was closing and locking the door.  Dean lay on the bed as Cas turned around.  They smiled at each other and Cas crossed to him, blanketing him with his body.
...You too. Beautiful I mean,”
Dean paused mid-bite, “What? I’m fine.”
Dean made sure to remember to breathe, were they really having his conversation right now? “Like as friends...or s-something more?” He whispered afraid to hear to answer.
Cas nodded, “Yes. Will pancakes suffice?”
Cas broke the silence first, his excitement taking over, “Does this mean we’re boyfriends Dean?” Dean turned as red as a cherry tomato.
The tips of her ears turned red “I want it to be memorable.”
Cas perked up, the task of choosing a movie that Dean would approve of taking the forefront in his mind.
When he approached Cas frowned, as Dean was muttering things in his slumber, and they sounded panicked. Dean whimpered and startled Castiel, as much as wanted to let his friend sleep he thought the best way for Dean to feel better was to wake him up.
Cas felt his vessel's cheeks heating up, “This.” He said quietly gesturing between them.
The angel watched Dean grab another beer from the fridge. He turned around to stare at the other wall. But he quickly whipped around when he heard the sound of glass shattering and Dean started yelling a string of curse words.
. It was passionate and slow, both of them wanting to savour the moment as much as possible. Cas’s breath hitched as Dean took his bottom lip into his mouth. Eventually, they both had to pull back to catch their breath.
“Are you an angel?” He whispered as soon as he could breathe again.
“Sammy? He is super smart, the kid is a genius. He’s finishing up his last year in law school. Even got himself a girl.”
Cas smiled, small and soft, “Yes, but you do. What are you doing up? Did you find a case?”
Cas <3: Dean, where are you? Sam made breakfast.
“Hello, Dean.” A voice rumbled.
“Hello, Dean. You were out for a while.” Cas was sitting at the table behind him.
“So? Would you try it?”
“I will! Sure it’s cheesy as hell, but I haven’t seen it since I was eight. Seven maybe.”
Even though Dean would never return his feelings, Castiel would never stop loving him with all that he was. Sometimes He would see the couples on Tv kissing and holding hands or in the diner in Lebanon sharing a meal. His heart would squeeze and he would imagine himself doing those things with Dean.
“Night Cas.” Dean drifted off surprisingly quickly.
“Please say something,” Cas whispered, his voice trembling.
“I’m a mechanic! I work at Singer Repair and Auto on the
, but he answered anyway. “Blue. Why?” Dean didn’t mention that his favourite colour used to be red but he changed it because of the angel's mesmerizing blue eyes. God, he sounded like a lovesick teenager.
“I don’t think they would mind.”
“Wanna get out of here?” Dean questioned. Cas raised his eyebrows at him as he backtracked. “No, no not like that! --I mean not that I wouldn’t want to, you’re smoking hot. Just not tonight, okay? I’ll just drive you home and maybe we can kiss some more.”
“I love you, angel,” Dean said garbled, his mouth full of pie. Cas Beamed, Leaving Dean to have his alone time with his pie. It gave Cas a chance to run to their room and grab his card and other surprises.
Castiel hummed, “We also sell records and homemade honey.”
Dean chuckled weakly. “That’s called a rom-com Cas. It’s not the same as real life.”
They both loaded as many snacks and drinks as they could carry and made their way down the hall to the Dean-cave.
“Hi! Uh, sorry to keep you waiting.” He sheepishly rubbed his hand behind his neck; he felt underdressed with her dark red dress standing out and making him look like an idiot.
“Y-Yeah.” Dean took a deep breath, “Be my Boyfriend Cas?” He joked.
“Wow. Love you too Cas.” Cas wrinkled his nose and caught Dean’s eye and notably scooted away from him. “Okay, Okay! I’ll go shower.” He leaned into Cas “Kiss?”
There were two tables in their little corner; one had what looked like a couple, and one with Sarah. The girl led him closer and closer and-
“Awwww.” It was a jar of honey, decorated with little bees on the side and the words ‘Castiel’s Honey :)’ printed on the top. “Thanks, Cas.”
Dean’s face was permanently tinted pink. “I think I am too.”
Dean laughed, “You know, we bicker like we are an old married couple.”
Cas said nothing.
That only made Sam gape harder, “You? On a run? That’s impossible!”
“Were not!”
He has had feelings for men before, glancing at their ass in the bar, imaging himself pinned under their body. He’s never dared to act on them.
“Yes. I am worried about you Dean. Your father passed years ago, you shouldn’t be getting this worked up about him. Also, I have never once seen you drop a beer in all the years I’ve known you.”
“It's okay Dean. The glass is gone.” Dean wasn’t answering him, “
“Shut up.” He piled some bacon and eggs on a plate and sat down next to Cas.
“Dean!? You are okay? Don’t move. I don't want you to step on glass.”
He and Cas have been friends for a long time now, but it’s been more than that..or more like Dean’s wanted it to be more than that.
The first thing he noticed were his blue eyes, they looked piercing-a brighter blue than Dean’s ever seen. He had dark, messy hair; Dean would have liked to reach over and run his fingers through it. The man was sitting with a skinny brunet.
He coughed, “Good, right?”
Dean smiled, “Or you could show me your honey bee farm.”
He moved further down the aisle and picked up some daisies that were on special. The flower lady came back and gave him a booklet with a list of flowers that attracted various bugs. He smiled when he found daisies on the list.
The Impala thundered over the open road, Dean’s zeppelin track blasting at full volume over the speakers. They were on their way to an abandoned warehouse that some vamps were using as a nest.
Dean beamed,
Cas kissed Dean again and whispered Sorry in his ear. “Eat your breakfast and I’ll give you your surprise.”
“I still have a card to give you,” Cas mumbled, swinging their joined hands together.
of them smiling into the kiss.
The man smiled though, “Hello, Dean. I am Castiel.”
“My presents!”
They didn’t talk after that, wanting to have the element of surprise. It worked because he got the drop on two of the vamps before the others noticed.
“Yeah..I..didn’t mean to.” Cas's shoulders slumped in relief. He grabbed Dean's hand and gently pulled him out of the kitchen. He was going to find out what was going on right now.
Dean laughed a little, not quite believing it. “I can’t believe you proposed to me on valentines days, with a bee-themed card.”
“How about both?”
He stepped back to admire his handiwork. Done. After 3 more hours. It’s gonna be so worth it. He was gonna bring Cas out here tomorrow around lunchtime, He had even brought one of those picnic blankets you see in movies. He made Pb & J the angel’s favourite, with the grape jelly.
The pair sat down. “I guess I owe you an explanation huh.” Dean rubbed the back of his neck sheepishly.
When he returned, Cas was gone, seeming locked himself in their room. Sam was rushing about the place, muttering something about Eileen coming over tonight. Dean took the opportunity to go back outside and finish up the garden.
Dean finally gave up on falling back asleep at 6 am, trudging into the bunker’s kitchen, heading straight for the beers.
He hummed happily, “I have tons of favourites but my top three are: Lord of Rings, Braveheart, and Back to the Future.” His date frowned.
Dean snapped alert when he walked further into the Bunker and an amazing smell lingered through the hallways.
“Love you, Dean”
Cas smiled again, “I would love that.”
Once Castiel came back to himself, He beamed so hard at Dean it hurt. He gently cupped the back of Dean’s neck and pulled them in for a much longer kiss.
Ugh, he needed a shower. He walked into the bunker leaving a little trail of dirt behind him.
He hesitated, "Hey...Do you want to stop for dinner before we go back? I'm starving."
“Yeah! That’s what I’ve been working on for the past few weeks! Is it yours?”
He remembered being so shocked at that moment, the
“Were so.”
He gave up on getting everything inside in broad daylight and parked the Impala in the garage and just prayed no one would see anything. He was gonna try to get everything inside after his family had gone to bed.
“Well so are you. Don’t think I didn’t notice you’ve been outside all day.”
Cas suddenly stopped when they got out to the parking lot, “I walked here.”
His friend's breathing started to speed up and Dean had to reach out a hand to the counter to steady himself.
and shrugged nonchalantly as Cas carried on, “I work at the bookstore downtown, The Honey Bee.”
“Dean, what are you talking about? Nobody made any pie.”
“I enjoyed Brokeback Mountain.” He spoke with a rumbly voice, enough to make Dean weak in the knees.
“Lots of practice on pillows.”
He walked around the store for what felt like forever picking up various flowers, most of them he’d never seen before and had crazy names like zinnias and geraniums. He thought he had enough, he looked at the last flower on the book and he snorted it was called
Cas took it, still confused. Dean led the pair outside.
“Are you trying to avoid your date too?”
“No, nothing! Just-” he faltered, awkwardly gesturing with his hands, “it’s different. It’s cute though!”
“Yeah. My brother dropped it off for me a few weeks ago.”
“Oh yeah! I’ve heard of that place, I don’t read much though.”
While the movie was playing even so often he would glance at Dean, and he wished they were sitting closer together. He would have liked to lean on Dean’s chest and listen to his heartbeat.
Cas squinted looking to be deep in thought, “What is your favourite... colour?”
Dean laughed, breaking the tension. He leaned his head on Cas’s shoulder, smiling wide. “Maybe I am falling for you.”
‘I’m coping.’ He mouthed to his brother, gripping his bundle of snacks tighter.
Screw it, he decided to go to the restroom, even though it was rude. If he doesn’t he might never see the man again. Dean was not surprised to see the man leaning on the wall of the man’s washroom on his phone. It seemed his date sucked as much as his own.
“I fucking knew it! I knew that I smelled pie the other day!” Dean had his 100-watt smile on his face.
Dean sucked up his pride and opened the door, the little bell jingling over top of him.
“Are too.” Sing-songed Dean.
Dean just nodded, keeping his gaze aimed at the floor. He flinched slightly when he felt Castiel pull him in for a hug, but he quickly relaxed, He had always loved the angel’s hugs. His head rested in Cas’s shoulder, neither one pulling away just yet. Dean felt his eyes prick with tears, Cas was the best
“You could join me in the Dean-cave, I was planning to camp out there and watch movies until this day is over.”
He sighed and laid his head on Cas’s shoulder. “I Hope you Like what I got you.” He whispered out, not really talking to anyone.
“No.”
“Come on, put it on, you’ve always been a terrible liar.”
“Love you too,” Dean replied, soft.
He promised Charlie and Sam that he would give this a chance. They were the ones to sign him up for this stupid website in the first place, claiming he was ‘lonely’ and needed to stop moping around all the time.
The idea came to him out of nowhere, on a food run no less, he was walking back to the Impala with the necessities-beer, toilet paper and pie-when he saw a young guy in the park across the street planting flowers.
They kissed again, basking in the moment. It was perfect.
“You didn’t…” Dean pulled one of the mixtapes out of the box.
Dean’s eyes watered a little bit “Never. I’m gonna love them, I can tell.”
Sam gave him a weird look when Dean returned with just two bags and told him he was gone for 4 hours. Dean just shrugged his shoulders and said the store was busy. Sam looked at him like “Yeah right” but went back to his laptop.
Dean paused and looked down, Oh. He had dirt
“Awesome!” He muttered to himself when he picked up the thing he was looking for, it was a birdhouse, but in the shape of the hobbit hole. Castiel had never since the movies, but it was too cool for Dean to just put it back on the shelf.
“I don’t. But I have faith you won’t. I trust that you’ll try your best, and that’s good enough for me.” Cas paused to reach his hand and place it over top of Dean’s, “And why? You’re perfect, to me. I like how much you like cars, and how passionate you are. How much you obviously love your brother. Your love for pie. You like Brokeback Mountain. You said you would try my honey. And didn’t make fun of me for having bees.”
“Makes up for what, Dean?”
“So...What do you do for a living?” Sarah spoke, obviously trying to get the conversation going.
“Uh...hi.” He looked around dauntingly, he didn’t know where to even start. This was going to be harder than he first thought.
His boyfriend kissed his forehead, “I will. And I, you.”
Dean sighed, finally understanding..”No Cas...I wasn’t asking you out. Well, I was, but not in that way. It was in a just-friends way. You get it?”
? He fumed, John better be glad he was dead. He placed his hand on Deans squeezing it gently. “I am sorry Dean. Thank you for telling me.”
Cas signed happily, “That sounds amazing. Please stop making me look bad.”
outskirts of town. I mostly do classic restoration, I’m working on this old lincoln right now and-”
He woke up cold and turned over to find an empty bed.
“Of course I do Dean, I think I'm falling in love with you.”
All of a sudden Sam’s door swung open, he was wearing sweats and his grey jogging hoodie. He shot Dean a knowing look as soon as he spotted him, “Good morning Dean. You’re sure up early.”
Cas nodded quickly, “Yes. Perfect, I felt like I was out of place in that restaurant.”
Dean beamed, “I knew you got me presents.”
“You're the love of my life too, Dean.” He pulled out a ring from his other pocket, “It was just a thought...You don’t have to wear it…”
“Cas.” Dean touched their foreheads together, leaning on the side of Baby. Slowly their lips met. It was awkward at first, Cas being inexperienced, but he was a quick learner. Dean let a quiet moan slip through when Cas ran his tongue over the hunter’s bottom lip. They eventually had to pull away to breathe.
“Yes. I have only felt attraction towards you, Dean.”
“I love you” kiss, “I love you” another kiss, “I love you so much, Dean.” Cas’s eyes were watering.
. A young girl in a red waitress uniform led him to a corner in the back where his blind date was already waiting.
“No, you’re not. Something is bothering you, I can tell.” Dean considered telling him for a few heart-beats.
Dean nodded frantically. He dragged Cas back to their room to “fornicate” as Cas would put it.
he could let himself have this. “Okay.” He finally answered, his voice small and soft.
The angel’s head shot up, “You would...want to do that with me?” His head tilted “Does this mean you reciprocate my feelings?”
“Come lay down.” Cas patted the spot next to him.
They sat down and Dean ordered a double bacon cheeseburger and Cas got sweet potato fries claiming that they were simple enough that the molecules tasted good.
Dean smiled fondly, The angel seemed pretty proud of himself, and he wasn’t one to pass up free food. “I’d love some pancakes Cas.”
Dean beamed hugely, “I love you too” he tugged Cas’s over, “look, all of these flowers attract bees, and that thing is a bughouse, and there’s a birdhouse hung up here and there’s this sunflower birdbath here-“ he paused noticing Cas staring at him.
Cas smiled and rushed to get to work. Dean watched his back as he busied around the kitchen. Sometimes he still found it hard to believe that Cas was back from the empty. Jack had brought him back as soon as could. They never talked about that day. Cas’s big speech, the
Dean shrugged, “It’s no problem.” Cas pulled him into an embrace, snuggling into Dean’s neck.
Cas threw his hands up exasperated, “What do you mean Love, love?!” he softened his tone, “Of course it wasn’t an in the moment thing, I wouldn’t say something like that if I did not truly mean it.”
Dean lit up,
“You? Making breakfast?”
Dean smiled harder, “This is Baby. My pride and joy.”
“Goodnight Dean.”
“Wait, was that your first kiss? Like ever?”
Dean grimaced, “My apologies.”
Dean huffed and grabbed the sandwich.
Dean shakily exhaled, pulling a trembling hand from his lap and running it over his face and through his hair. Cas tried to move a hand onto his shoulder, but Dean flinched. Hard.
“Uhhh.” The angel fumbled with the remote and somehow got it on Netflix, scrolling through the options he stopped for a second, looking at something called the “Bee Movie”  he read the description, his smile growing. He quickly shook his head. There was no way that Dean would be into a movie like this.
There were 2 days till Valentine’s day So Dean was gonna have to step it up, but it's going to be worth it to see the look on the angel’s face.
Cas narrowed his eyes, clearly not buying it. “If you’re sure.”
Dean’s mouth opened and closed. Sam had him there. He gave his brother the bird and Walked away to go find Cas.
Cas tilted his head, “Why would they change?”
The next day he managed to sneak out of the bunker without anyone taking notice and he drove to a store he’d swore never to step a foot in,
“Cas?” His date asked. Dean blushed
He grabbed a Beer and propped his feet up on the table, his mind going through a mental checklist to make sure everything was ready.
Dean allowed himself one more sniffle before he pulled away completely from Cas, wiping his face. “Sorry...I don’t really know what came over me.”
Cas huffed. He was a great liar. “I would like to watch something you would enjoy as well Dean.”
Dean chuckled sleepily,  “I will probably always forget that you don’t sleep.”
Dean blushed, his favourite place was the burger diner, which serves the best pies. Is he really going to tell his handsome date that though? He felt his stomach growl at the thought of a nice juicy bacon cheeseburger and an apple pie.
He reluctantly tore his eyes away from the man before he got caught and prepared to meet his date. She beamed at him when he sat down.
“Dean? Are you okay? You seem troubled.” Cas grumbled next to him, coming out of his haze.
It’s the thought that counts Dean reminded himself as he sealed his card into an envelope with Cas’s name scrawled out in chicken scratch on the front.
Dean smirked, “Maybe we were destined to meet.”
“It’s no worries! I ordered some margaritas to get us started if that’s alright!”
“Smells good in here.” He announced his presence and made a beeline for the coffee, yearning for his 3rd cup of the day.
He thinks it would be nice.
Cas frowned trying to understand, what couldn’t you bring inside? “Is it...a guinea pig?” The angel had always wanted a guinea pig.
Dean nodded, keeping his eyes on the road as Baby pulled into the warehouse parking lot. He shot a quick text to Sam saying they were going in.
He watched as Cas’s cheeks dusted a light pink, “Sorry...I was listening to you talk earlier. You sounded very enthusiastic about it.” His date seemed to hesitate for a second, “I was going to come by your shop tomorrow.”
“No way! My brother forced me to do this too!” Dean was giddy.
“Hiya Cas,” Dean whispered back, slowly leaning in and capturing Castiel’s lips with his own. He felt fireworks go off in his mind, exploding one after another. He never thought kissing another person could be this amazing; he could still taste the apple pie on Cas’s lips, and a small hint of honey. He quietly moaned when Cas slipped his tongue between Dean’s lips. The stubble tickled his face. He gripped tighter, wrapping his arms around Cas.
Sometime later, he glanced over again to find Dean leaning his head on the side of a pillow, asleep. He smiled and rose from the couch to drape a blanket over the hunter.
“Are we going to bed?”
Dean choked on his bite of pie, “Wha--”
He grabbed everything he thought he would need, still in his pyjamas. He had already picked out a place for it just past the bunker hill, a nice spot with sun and had wildflowers and clovers already growing.
Dean didn’t think he would ever have nightmares on the 8th of February again. For this day would become his and Cas’s anniversary date.
Cas’s head tilted, “Stop what, Dean?”
“Were not.”
His date made a noise that could’ve been featured in porn, “Dean this is
Castiel smiled fondly at him, “I think you are just hungry. I left grilled cheese for you in the fridge.”
Dean laughed, “Sure. Follow me.” There was no way Dean and Cas were having their first kiss in a 2-star restaurant. They left the bill on the counter and Dean dragged Cas out to the Impala.
Dean counted it as revenge when Cas blushed, “I will look forward to it” He mumbled. They had both finished eating and Dean took the opportunity to push the apple pie between the two of them. He handed Cas a fork and gestured for him to dig in.
He would love nothing more than to snuggle back into bed with his boyfriend but he had garden stuff to sneak in. He was very thankful for the dusty storage room they had in their garage that no one goes in. He was too exhausted to do anything else and stumbled back to his and Cas’s room.
Sam was busy on a hunt with Elieen. Dean swears he sent them out here just so he could have some alone time with her.
“I’m Dean!” He blurted,
“No Cas It isn’t a guinea pig.” Dean held his hand out, “come on, I’ll show ya.”
Sarah cut him off, “Cool. I work at the fitness and health gym downtown, do you know the place?” she gave him a sickeningly sweet smile.
“Breakfast is served.” Cas broke Dean out of his thoughts.
"Sorry Dean, it snuck up behind me."
Both Cas and Elieen got Dean and Sam new flannels. Eileen got a new hoodie that looked suspiciously like Sam’s, She put it on as soon as she took it out of the bag. Cas chuckled at Dean’s cowboy hat valentine card, it said ‘Be my valentine Partner?’
Dean laughed, “Yeah, that’s Ellen. She tends to have that effect on people.”
“I love you, Dean Winchester.” He said, more serious this time. Dean didn’t think he would ever tire of hearing that.
“You don’t have to say anything. I just wanted you to know.”
Sam coughed behind them “Whipped!” more coughing. Dean glared at his brother and Elieen giggled and slapped Sam’s arm.
“Dean! You’re awake, you are at the bunker. You fell asleep during the bee movie remember?”
“She scares me.”
“I am not.” huffed his little brother’s voice behind him.
Dean figured it was a heat of the moment thing.
It was hard to imagine Dean doing all that. I mean just over a year ago he was trying to find a way to defeat
“Hey, Ellen! Hope you still have some pies left.”
“Hello! Welcome to Happy petals!” A cheery woman greeted him as soon as the door closed behind him.
Cas smiled, and Ellen came by with two bacon cheeseburgers and an apple pie with two forks. Dean blushed like a schoolgirl when Castiel took his first bite and moaned around the burger.
“I think...I think I love you too Cas.” Dean whispered, still panting.
“Uh, where are we going exactly?”
Dean looked at his shoes- just maybe,
“Hi, Dean.” Eileen waved to him as the bunker door screeched open. She was carrying multiple boxes.
about this fitness gym. Dean didn’t want to be rude, but it was
Cas smiled again, letting his teeth show as he stepped closer, “You’re beautiful.”
It was late afternoon now, Dean was giddy. He couldn’t wait for tomorrow. Hell, he might even go to bed early.
"This okay?" Dean gestured to a burger joint off the highway. Cas nodded, now calmed down playing with a button on his trench coat.
to come in if you made it.”
Cas grinned, and his eyebrows furrowed. “So now that we have established mutual interest for one another, do you want to leave this place?”
Cas grinned and gently took his hand, his firm grip reassuring Dean without either of them saying a word. They exited the washroom, looking back at the corner. Surprisingly, their respective dates looked to be leaning over their tables and happily talking- both with big smiles. That made Dean feel a million times better.
“So you’re a mechanic?” Cas asked, a smile playing at his lips.
Dean looked back up at Cas, who was looking more nervous by the second. “I love it Cas, It’s very cute. Of course, I’ll ‘Bee’ your valentine.”
“Yes..you asked me to remember? Just before we left the warehouse.”
Apparently, he was, “You know the burger place across from the flower shop?”
“We should at least have a second date before we declare our undying love for each other.”
Cas pulled away and his face converted into concern when he saw Dean, “Oh please don’t cry, Dean. Please.” He whispered, his arm moving to Dean’s back and rubbing it up and down in what he hoped to be a soothing motion.
His breathing hitched when he found Cas lying on the ground, the last vampire lying on the ground, a bullet lodged into his chest.
“Oh yeah!” Dean grinned when Cas pulled a handmade Card out of his trench coat pocket. When Cas reached out to give it to him, Dean noticing his hand was trembling.
Cas paused and raised his eyebrow at Dean. It was only then Dean realized what he had said. “I...mean, He faltered trying to find the words, “I didn’t mean it like that...I wasn’t implying anything! Just that we bicker a lot.”
“Very nice,” Cas mused. Dean opened the door for him and immediately put on Zeppelin. Cas hummed in approval.
Dean shovelled some more pancakes in his mouth, “These aren’t half bad, man.”
Cas shot him a half-smile, “I would like that.”
“It is a big deal Dean, I’m sorry if I pushed you. I know how horribly John treated you and Sam.”
Cas head tilted, “Hiding what Dean?” He put his book down.
Dean overhead the man say “I don’t understand that reference,” while tilting his head in the most adorable way possible.
“I don’t know what you’re getting at Cas. Am...Am I making you uncomfortable?” God, Dean hoped not, he thought he was being very subtle about his feelings for his friend.
Dean smiled and opened it to read the inside,
Sam gaped at him, “What happened to you?!”
“Got any plans today?” asked Dean, changing the subject.
“Thank you, Dean. I’m glad you enjoy them.”
“D-Dean…you did all of this for me?”
for Cas have been hard to ignore
The angel looked around, seeing nothing. “Dean? What are we doing out here?”
“Yeah, that would be great...I’m um, I’m looking to start a garden.”
Before he let himself succumb to dreamland he set an alarm on his phone for 5 am. Usually, he and Cas would wake up together, But Dean had work to do.
stuck on the tip of his tongue, his heart beating a mile a minute. But then Cas died. And it was too late. It wasn’t mentioned when Cas got back and still wasn’t almost three months later.
Dean shrugged his shoulders, “I mean I just poured my heart out to you and then proceeded to cry on your shoulder like a 3-year-old.”
Dean was half paying attention and half staring admiring the dark-haired man. God, he was cute. He was wearing a trench coat, which Dean found a little odd, but at the same time, it also suited him.
Sam coughed easing the tension, “Eileen and I are gonna leave you two alone.”
It was too late though, the tears had already escaped and stream down his face and drip off his chin onto Cas’s beloved trenchcoat. He sniffed when his nose started to run,
Cas's eyes lit up and he nodded frantically, "Yes please!" Cas practically ran back to Impala like an excited toddler.
Cas smiled, “When I said those words, I meant as more than friends Dean. I am aware you don’t share those same-Mff!” He was cut off by Dean rushing forward and pressing his lips to his own. Just as quickly Dean pulled back to gauge Castiel’s reaction.
Cas nodded like he really believed it. “I have an old Lincoln there, do you know of it?”
“What is it? Cas?”
smiled, big and bright, “Yes I did.”
“Hi Eileen,” Dean grinned, “I see you’re prepared.”
“Shhh. Just come with me.” Dean pulled his boyfriend around the door of the bunker and up the hill. Dean was getting nervous, he could hear his heart beating in his chest and his palms were all sweaty. “Okay uh…close your eyes Cas.”
boring. He pretended to listen, randomly nodding along every few seconds. In actuality, his eyes wandered to the table over as Dean tried to subtly check out the dark-haired man from earlier.
“I have 7 brothers and sisters.” Cas deadpanned.
Valentine’s day was never something Dean celebrated, for obvious reasons. But this year was different. He finally had someone to celebrate with. He could tell Cas was excited because, in the days leading up to Valentine’s day, his boyfriend kept sneaking off giving excuses like; “I’m going for a supply run” or “Going for a walk” but Dean knew better.
"It's fine. just glad your okay." He helped Cas up onto his feet.
He was about to dish up seconds when Cas stopped him. “I think you’ll want this instead.” Cas has an apple pie in his hands.
that dude was
“Aww, you wanna cuddle Cas?”
He felt like he worked for hours, who knew putting together a birdbath would be so hard? He jumped when his phone vibrated in his pocket.
“I agree. Tomorrow? You could show me around your shop when I come to pick up my car.”
They eventually made it into the Impala after several more kisses. They held hands in the middle of the seat the entire 4-hour ride back to the bunker. Dean took a picture of their conjoined hands and made a group message to Sam, Eileen and Charlie. With the caption “I Have a date :).”
Cas rolled his eyes, did his friend not remember? “Yes, Dean. I told you I did before the empty took me.”
Castiel was trying to wrap his head around this, John had hit his kids? John had hit
Dean rushed through the doors of the restaurant where he agreed to meet...Sandy? Sydney?...No, Sarah! He let her pick the location so he had no idea what to expect. He wiped his feet on the mat and straightened his flannel.
Dean snorted at Cas’s words, but he had had enough, his friend was acting very strange, even for him. “Okay man, drop the act or whatever you’re doing. You’ve been acting weird since the warehouse. Is this about you getting punched? I told you it was fine-so just...what’s going on?.”
“Dean? What on god’s green earth are you doing here? Sam told me you had a date?”
“I’ve never seen those,” she confessed. Dean had to fight the urge to spew his crappy margarita-
~~~~~~~~
Eileen got up, “I’ll go get my gifts and we can open them together.” Dean and Sam nodded and both took off.
Cas reached out and patted him on the shoulder, “It’s gonna go, fine Dean, we’re prepared.”
The angel was not at all surprised when he came back not even 15 minutes later and the pie dish was cleaned off, sitting by the sink.
“Wait here.” He whispered against Dean’s neck. He watched Cas duck into his house, and he quickly returned with something in his hands.
Dean’s eyebrows furrowed, “What do you mean you’re nervous? What do you have to be nervous about?”
Cas stepped closer, smiling now, and pulled Dean in for a sweet, but passionate kiss.
“Yeah. I get the same nightmares every year on this day. It’s not a big deal.”
Cas hummed and closed his book and pulled the blanket further up over the two of them.
“Yes,” Dean breathed, “Yes! Of course, I’ll marry you Cas. You're the love of my life.”
Sarah shook her head again and shrugged her shoulders. Dean sighed, and he caught the attractive dark-haired man staring at him.
This was his chance, his mind screamed at him. He wanted to know more about the man- maybe a name for starters, so he could stop calling him ‘the dark-haired man’.
Cas started to laugh, and Dean vowed to try to hear that sound as much as possible. “I think I might be falling in love with you, Dean.” he murmured softly. So matter-of-fact.
"My brother is none of your fucking business." Dean strode towards him, fisting his hand in the man's shirt. So close he could scent the man was an alpha. "You need to fucking stop fucking sniffing around my child or I will fucking kill you. Do I make myself clear?"
“Understatement, bitch.” Dean gave his brother a lopsided smile and took a seat to begin eating.
“We should put him in his car…and maybe park it somewhere. This is, truly, a bad place to stop. Why did you stop here, Dean?” Cas just seemed to realize where they were. He was looking the interstate up and down, a puzzled look on his face.
"So you're paying for drinks next time?" she winked
“Yeah, about that. Mr Moore invited us to dinner.”
"Well…" Dean rubbed the back of his neck again. "He authorized me to recruit you if you want to."
“Sam?”
yeah, so this thing writes itself apparently. I have all of you to thank for the support and inspiration it means a lot to me. I have the next 3 or 4 chapters planned out. I hope to post one on Sunday.
"I am 14 years your senior and in rut. You don't want to take my knot in your virgin ass when I don't have all my wits with me. Leave."
Claire smiled, her eyes welling up. “I hated you guys at the beginning. Blamed you for everything but I see now none of you really had any other choices back then. I miss my father, I miss my mother but I’ve found a family. I started calling Jody Mom. I think she cried the night I told her. I love you guys. And Uncle Moose too.”
Dean prayed to his angel.
"Hello, omega."
They kept talking in the back of the class when the prissy teacher, Miss Ratched, entered. She was the kind of woman that had a perpetual scowl on her face, a wrinkle in her nose, and a judgy look. The class became silent. She did the attendance and when her eyes fell on Dean her scowl became even deeper, her lips a thin line.
“I agree, 650 is fair, I wouldn’t want to sleep in those rooms. I have the paperwork with me, you boys can move in today. And when you solve the guardianship we’ll update the lease.”
The Moore's house was a big apartment in one of the nicer buildings in Brighton Beach. Dean was nervous as hell when he knocked on the door, holding the bottle of juice he brought. He couldn't buy a nice wine so he thought it was the least he could bring. Mrs Moore opened the door with a wide smile on her face. A warm neutral beta scent enveloped Dean.
“So, you two are fucking?” Claire said now that they could hear each other again.
The drive to the motel was done in silence. In the parking lot, Cas opened the glove compartment and extracted a pair of leather gloves, some brass knuckles, big zip ties and duct tape. He gave Dean the knuckles and put the gloves on himself.
“No, but it can calm you if done properly. Also, constantly giving the wolf an outlet helps to keep you calm and gives you more power to control your anger in moments when you can’t exteriorize your emotions. All these become easier with time, as you mature. I don't really need to exhaust my wolf by intense physical activities but I do keep up with the habits I formed as a teen.”
Dean froze. He was acutely aware that someone just materialized in the passenger seat. He felt Baby lean with the added weight and could feel two eyes fixated on his temple. Dean held his breath, almost afraid to look at his right. Robert Plant was singing his heart out. Then…
“I want to drill a hole in this coin. I can maneuver the machine, I just need you to let me borrow it”
"Ah. The band of larcenists, yes. They were driven off by Alastair. Benny told you about that?" Cas scrunched up his nose while petting Dean’s ass in a possessive manner.
“Yeah, this other biker gang moved in and drove them off. Some members were killed and then the entire group kind of drifted apart. Benny hasn’t come in for lunch ever since it happened. He usually ate outside.”
Dean woke up the next morning snuggled into Cas, breathing in his distinct smell, that combination of wilderness after-rain and wildflowers he loved but would never dear to admit out loud. Cas hugged tighter and whispered “morning, ol boaluahe. How was your sleep? You really were out of it after that tea.”
“No, we didn’t, but I am not doing it.”
Dean pulled the high-neck down, exposing a few. “So tell me, alpha, do you feel like going feral from seeing my claimed neck? Because that is what those prudes said.”
“I can’t bring Cas because he is too old.” Dean took spoonfuls of the warm soup, he had been so cold. “I think it’s bullshit.”
“Understatement, for sure. He’s, uhm, going crazy." Dean checked his watch. "We should get a move on, we're already late for lunch”
Claire leaned more into Cas to whisper in his ear. “Hey, so about that trip to Hell for listening to rock… “
The two rolled their eyes and remained silent for the remainder of the period.
Dean got back at the HQ and waited out the end of his shift. No one needed him to take other packages so when the clock hit 9 he left for his motel. His homework was mostly done from the lounge room so he didn't bother with it anymore. He ate dinner with Sam, talked about their day. He got an ice pack out of the freezer for his jaw. Chewing burgers at lunch made his jaw ache. After that night's movie, the brothers turned in for the night. Dean redressed his scrape.
talk to me."
"Watching the news from Russia, although I think I should be asking you that since you barged in here."
and he wanted her to be
“What designation is he?
it means “my love” in Enochian. I…. I haven’t spoken it in so long I just wanted to say the words”.
"Helloooo, alpha!" a brunette omega passed them by, smiling at Benny. She even waved and winked at the older alpha before twirling away. The surly alpha didn’t do much but give a tense smile and a head nod.
is a reason to shoot you.”
"Oh, no worries. We can work on it online like, email or Docs or some other office app and meet up once to settle stuff."
“Your boo is Russian?” Becky asked.
It took a while but the diner was free of the group, the last of them escorted by Cas outside. Dean turned to the waitress and smiled. “I think you can bring our burgers out.” The woman rolled her eyes but left for the kitchen nonetheless. Dean turned to see his brother standing closely. “Hey, Sammy… uhm.”
“Yes, alpha, now please touch me, I need you.”
“Yeah, GREAT IDEA CAS”
“I liked making eye contact with you. It… excited me. I… wasn’t expecting that. I covered your eyes just in case.” Cas’ voice was small and apologetic like he wasn’t a possessive bastard not just 5 minutes before.
The table had erupted in protests all around.
“He… fuck." She looked astounded. "Brad told me that if he ever smelled me when he’s in rut he’s going to take what is his.” Becky scoffed, shaking her head in frustration.
“I…. I don’t know” Cas said once he was finished.
Dean swallowed hard. He glanced in the rearview mirror, angling it to check on Claire. She was sleeping, mouth hanging open
"Would any court of law give an Alpha pup to an Omega?"
“I’m having some… trouble at home but I can handle it, okay?”
“Does your brother need you?”
"That is great, Cas." He heard his own voice from afar. His tone was so flat he wondered why he would not care more about Gabe.
“Cas… please… I can’t. I can’t go there now.”
“Don’t degrade yourself, Dean. I think you are smart. Shall we?”
B. I wanted to get this out before you guys killed me for it
“Dean! Good to hear from you, idjit. But I can’t talk much, I’m tracking down a serial domestic abuser with Rufus and we’re waiting for the perp to leave his moonlighting job.”
"I think you know I'm not bluffing."
“To mate, silly. The law says so. If the couple is a true mates pairing everything is thrown out the window. You don’t have to wait to be 18 to be with him. He can mate and claim you and custody goes to him until you’re 18,”
“You’ve read Chuck’s books?” Cas had to admit defeat. He couldn’t mend it anymore. “Dean didn’t want to tell anyone, I am trying to respect his wishes, please let us change the subject”
“I’ll cry myself to sleep because of it.” Dean snagged the form from the desk and left the room in a hurry, ignoring Ms Ketchum’s lecture about respect. He tore it into pieces and threw the pieces in the trash can.
Dean turned bright pink.
“If you thought you were good enough for me then you are good enough for her.”
“Hey you missed a spot” Dean poked his brother on the back with ice from his cocktail and laughed when Sam jumped.
Benny, Dean, and Sam were walking across the parking lot to their cars.
"Yes. What do you think, Sam?"
"I'm pretty sure he does."
“Yeah, he’s really nice. He gave me the car and he’s helping me out when I need it”
Around the corner, in the side hallway next to the galley Sam was flattened to the wall facing away from the direction Dean would come. He decided to try to crawl to the stairs to go to the unused lower level but he heard shuffling of feet and realized Dean was coming in the kitchen while he was crouched in full view in the hallway. He jumped in the kitchen and inserted his headphones in his ears. Good thing he forgot them on the counter after his morning run. Sam picked up the kettle and out of the corner of his eye saw Dean freeze in the doorframe. He continued preparing the tea, putting water in the kettle, and ignored Dean’s first two attempts at grabbing his attention.
“Pies?” Cas looked towards the kitchen
The morning was filled with an undefined tension, the radio was playing some Billie Eilish song. Sam did callisthenics in the small motel space to make up for skipping the morning run. Dean plated breakfast and grabbed his mug filled with instant coffee.
Dean nodded
Dean texted the alpha the address and waited on the couch. 10 minutes later a knock fell on the door and Dean opened it for Cas. The scent of tobacco and oranges hit him and Dean sagged against the doorframe. Cas leaned forward and kissed him and, gods, he tasted amazing, the velvet touch of his lips soothing Dean as he moved against him. The kiss ended tenderly and they remained forehead to forehead in the doorway, breathing each other’s pheromones for a while.
"Hello, Mrs Moore. I, erm, brought some juice for us kids." He laughed nervously.
Cas’ face relaxed with a wide grin and made a low sound something between a purr and a growl and somehow at that moment the hunter felt his otherworldliness, he acutely perceived Cas as not human and in some twisted way he felt even more aroused. The Angels eyes shined bright blue and he licked his lips, obviously relishing in what was happening. Dean felt intense heat on his shoulder, Cas’ hand gripping tighter for a few seconds before releasing him and going for Dean’s face. He cupped his face with both hands and dragged him down in a passionate kiss. He growled “mine” in Dean’s mouth, devouring him entirely. Dean was elated and pressed harder on Cas to be as close as physically possible. The angel flipped them and started grinding on the hunter’s body. Dean’s own cock was pressed between their hips. The friction was good but a bit too much, the hunter grunted “Lube…. Get the…. In the drawer” and Cas stretched his arms to snatch the lube bottle from its resting place. He squirted a generous amount and encircled both their cocks in his hand. Dean wanted more and he snuck a hand underneath himself and started circling his rim, teasing the entrance with a hastily lubed finger. He imagined his finger was Cas’ length. He moaned with abandon, precum leaking from both. He let Cas fuck them into his fist while he kept teasing his own hole. They were panting and soon their breaths became hitched and shallow. Dean opened his eyes to look at Cas, feeling more aroused by watching the pleasure on his lover’s face. Cas half opened his eyes and Dean let out a moan when they locked eyes.
Bolded English = Russian Dean understands/speaks
“Okay. So this is it? Just like that? I am with Cas, in THAT way and you’re more than fine?”
“Guyyyyys”
“650 a month and I have to do the repairs myself but the landlady will give me the materials and the tools.”
“Well, I start with the search engine and keep going, sifting through articles and more articles, following links, finding new word associations, and go back to the search engine and … .oh… OH… I always do this, don’t I?” Dean’s face brightened with the realization.
Dean seemed elated and talked to Sam as he pointed toward Cas:
"What does it look like?"
"Ow!" Pumpkin stepped on Dean, her paw sinking painfully in his belly. She ignored the omega, walking over him and curling up in Cas lap, purring like a V8 engine. The alpha scritched her between her ears. She stayed like that up until loud shooting started and the tabby bolted.
Dean coaxed Sam into walking up but when the young alpha understood what was happening he could barely contain his excitement. The drive wasn’t long and Dean was relieved to see the building was in the same school district so their high school and middle school could remain the same.
“Sleepy, actually this thing seems to work”, Dean was resting his head on his hands. He hadn’t been this sleepy in weeks and was so affected he felt drunk.
"31, Your Honour"
Cas hugged him tightly. “Thank you for telling me, Dean. All I can say is that I am sorry that happened to you. You’re safe now. You have me. You have Sam. You have Claire and Jack and Jody and Donna. You are loved, Dean.” The hunter leaned in the hug, engulfing himself in the other’s arms.
Mr Moore nodded and scanned the crowd again. Dean spotted Sam coming towards them with Jessica in tow.
“I must tell you, Dean, I don’t think Sam will reject you. But you’ll tell Sam when you’re ready. I’ll wait however long it takes, and in the meantime if you want to continue to…*air quotations*
“Ha! Count me in.”
“Never. I once told him to stop yanking my hair and he did. I told him I hate it and he never did it again. Maybe Cas is just so awesome but honestly… everything I was scared of in a relationship with an alpha he is not so I think it’s possible. He is the living proof that what those idiots say is instinct is in fact just a lack of education and self-control. Becks. I was in his bed when his rut started.
Dean beamed. “I’d like that very much, alpha”
“Yeah, I’ll wait for him to come to me with this. Right now, though, I should call him. He’ll be suspicious if I don’t “wake him up” soon”
“What can I say, alpha-mine spoils me.”
Back at the motel, Dean asked Sam about his trip to DC and the young alpha said it was on the first weekend in April. They watched whatever was on the TV before bed. That night Sam crawled in bed with Dean, nuzzling in his brother for comfort. It was the fifth week since John left them.
“I doubt that, but if so, he needs to prove it so I need some sort of photocopy from his college ID. Complete the form and give it back”
“You’re afraid Sam will reject you, us. Is that it? You’re afraid you’ll lose Sam if you tell him?”
“Yeah, keep hoping, Dean. Because if he comes and takes us away again, it’s on you and your stupid omega instincts.” The heat and anger were back in Sam’s voice now, biting hard on Dean.
“Okay.”
Dean did not expect to be greeted roughly. He certainly did not expect to be slammed in the wall, searched, his switchblade taken, and then be escorted all the way back to the conference room. Only Zachariah was inside. The alpha said something in Russian to the thugs and they left.
“Contract law or something. Or maybe work with an advocacy group.”
. He inhaled the orange blossom scent and he relished in the soothing effect it had on him. He felt intoxicated, happier than he ever was, flying high on a cloud of orange blossoms and tobacco. The alpha growled and turned them around, shoving Dean against the wall and kissing back with abandon, licking inside his mouth. The omega's cock was weeping for attention and Dean tried to get some friction by grinding on Cas but it was not enough so he whimpered a nonverbal protest. The alpha understood and shoved his thigh between Dean's legs so Dean managed to really grind on him. The drag of clothes over his dick was divine and hellish at the same time, too little and too much. He wished Castiel would touch his dick but the alpha's hands were resting on his hips, helping him dry hump the alpha's thigh. They were kissing with open mouths, tongues intertwined. Dean was floating and pleasure was rocking his body in waves. Cas let go of his lips and started kissing down on Dean's neck until he reached the base, licking over the scent glands then sucking the mating glad in his mouth gently, playing with it between his teeth. The omega writhed in Cas' grasp, his grinding becoming erratic as mating hormones flooded his system. Dean came in his pants, his scream muffled in Cas' shoulder. Cas let go of his hips, petting Dean's torso gently, murmuring sweet nothings in his ear. Dean wasn't sure if he was speaking in Russian or English. When he was more back to himself he could feel the hard line of Castiel's own erect cock pressed on his inner thigh. "
"Miss Henshaw has hickeys too."
Dean licked his lips. He dreaded telling Cas because he had a feeling…
Cas told Sam what he told Dean in the car. Sam’s eyes widened.
“Jerk.”
"You're right, I am sorry."
“I… I didn’t even realized I was flirting. I guess with women it’s more of a reflex for me. I am sorry I made you uncomfortable. I’ve….I’ve never actually been in a hotel. Only…cheap motels and dingy apartments. I guess I was nervous. I am sorry, I didn’t think anything of it.”
“But don’t you think this… true mate thing is just a myth?”
“Fine.”
“I don’t deserve you”
Cas was humming the lyrics. Sam tried not to place his confusion on his face. He almost lost it when Dean joined him.
"Huh?"
Once home he ignored Sam and his questions and tracked down the school records in his duffle bag. He also got the scant medical records they had that showed missed vaccinations and health checks. Sam huffed and muttered something about Dean being sensitive and went back to his room. Once Dean had all the documents he needed he left for the law firm.
“Pardon?”
"Hm. Hi. I didn't think
“Have you no shame?” the woman was even closer, chin-up, looking at Cas, accusingly
Cas got them both out of the tub and dried them off.  Cas tucked them into bed with a kiss on his forehead and Dean drifted off, content and happy.
“Finally,” Cas breathed.  He could feel himself starting to slick as he scented Dean’s arousal.  “Would you help me with my laces?” he asked.
Set on his choice, he leaned back into the couch and began to eat.  His dinner was good and it was nice to be able to enjoy food again.  He wasn’t sure that he would ever get to a place where he was going to like eating again.  Since the medicine the doctors gave him had stopped the vomiting, he was much happier that he could enjoy a meal.
“She has also been the one to help cover for me while at work.  She told my parents that she needed my help and that I wouldn’t be in the office much and had some of my work delegated.  When I called her the night you were in the hospital she told me that she would help with whatever I needed her to.  Like I said, she’s been very good to me my whole life.”
He looked further and saw a picture of himself sitting alone at the table, a picture of Cas’ sharp look on the stairs and one of Cas sitting next to him at the table with his back slightly turned to Dean while he spoke to Crowley.  While that might not have been a cause for discussion, it was also the rest of the picture.  Charlie and Gilda were engrossed together on his other side and Charlie was also slightly turned away from him.  Everyone else at the table looked engaged together and it was very clear that Dean was alone.
He wanted to tell John Winchester to go to hell and that Dean could think and decide for himself, but he didn’t.  Instead he covered the uncomfortable silence with ordering two double cheeseburgers with bacon and fries.  Cas was not really in the mood for such a large burger, but he knew that Dean was hungry from being in class all day and it was what we wanted, so he ordered for both of them.
Their quiet, slow days were soon interrupted, though.  By the middle of February everyone was gearing up for the winter calving.  Dean had no idea that cows were bred to birth in the middle of winter, but Cas told him it was the best way to ensure a good price come market time.  Calves born in February weighed more than ones born in March, if they could keep them alive.
“What?” Cas asked, confused.
“Uh, doc, what do you mean by heavy lifting?  I’ve got a three year old at home, so…” He let his sentence trail off.
It would be difficult in the small town they lived in to find someone that you connected with and Jimmy and Cas had lived here for more than a year.  They had surely met everyone at least once.  If there was someone in town that would be a good mate for his brother, he would have found them by now.
“Are you alright?” Cas asked softly.  He rested his hand on Dean’s neck and thumbed his cheek.  Dean leaned into the touch and sighed.
“I think I understand better now,” he said.  “So, I can decide when and how much she does.  And what she does.”
“You look gorgeous, Cas.  And besides, your hair looks like you just rolled out of bed.  Sexy,” he told him with a wink.  Cas chuckled and Dean released his hold.  “Though, it might be the mirror,” he suggested as he patted Cas on the ass.
“Yes, Daddy?” Emma was swinging their hands together as they walked to the car.
The next thing he was aware of what a flare of pain in his chest.  His eyes flew open and he gasped.  He tried to catch his breath while he focused on where he was.
Dean had a death grip on Cas’ hand and supported himself with the edge of the counter with the other.  There was a beat of shocked silence before Sam was out of his seat.  He turned the chair over and snarled at Cas.  Dean tensed and Cas released his hand as Sam came around the table, stalking towards Cas.
“Well, he won’t be any help in here, but at least he will keep her entertained for us to be able to cook a bit.”
“Am I that predictable?” he asked as he halted the horse.
She nodded, squeezing his hand back.  “I’m fine, Cas, really.”  She looked up at him and smiled again.  “I just wonder if things would have turned out differently if we had stayed with our pack, or found a new one quickly.”  She sighed and brushed off the rest of her sadness.  “But,” she continued brightly, “I wouldn’t be here and we never would have become friends.”
A week after Dean’s heat he found himself sitting on the couch in the living room with Cas, holding his phone.  He had pushed his brother off with texts for a few days but he could tell that Sam was getting impatient.  He visited several times a week and he hadn’t seen Dean in almost two.  Sam knew something was wrong and the last thing he and Cas wanted was for Sam to show up unexpectedly and be surprised.
“In the end, they didn’t believe us.  The report said that the alphas tried to break up the fight between me and Inias.  They tried to get us to press charges against each other and when we wouldn’t they were ready to press charges on us.  If Abbadon hadn’t stepped in to help they would have put me in jail.  We ended up bent over the table anyway in order to have everything dismissed and keep the club out of the news.”
Dean slowly pressed kisses up Cas’ neck until he was at his ear.  Cas’ ears were sensitive and were always the spot to get him going.  While he was working his lips upwards, his hand was also inching up towards Cas’ groin.  He was just brushing the top of his thighs when Cas growled and stopped Dean’s hand.  Dean stilled and drew back, waiting for Cas.
He thought about how Cas had worn his engagement ring and was so happy when Dean asked for it back.
“Me too,” Dean told him honestly.  “She’s going to help me with the nursery.”
“Naomi,” he heard his father say softly.  “Let me speak to Cas.”
Dean couldn’t get away fast enough and he knew he didn’t have control over his scent.  He just needed a minute to get his stupid hormones in check and calm down.  He slipped into his room and in to his nest.  He rested his head on Cas’ pillow and breathed in his scent, trying to calm himself.
He wanted Cas’ scent.  He decided to take a risk and walked into his room.  He gathered things for a shower and took them down the hall to the master bedroom.  He hesitated at the door.
“Because he is no longer your mate, Castiel.  He is nothing to you anymore.”
“Ok, stay there, I’m on my way.”
> Answer me or I’ll come find you.
Dean sat with his hands clasped under his chin, his eyes sweeping over Cas’ body but not lingering on his face.
Before either could say something more their waiter appeared to clear their plates.  “Would you like to see the dessert menu?” she asked Cas.  Cas raised a brow at Dean, who nearly popped a boner at the hotness factor of that look, and Dean nodded.
“Garth is bringing up three dozen roses.  Do you know anything about this?”  Dean crossed his arms over his chest and frowned at his mate.
“We’re going to try and make this as painless as possible, ok?” Doctor Eden asked him and he put on a pair of gloves.  “I’ll be quick and you must tell me if you’re hurt.”
Dean glanced down at Andrea’s rounded stomach and smiled.  Benny was over the moon about the baby and Dean was glad for them both.  He hoped that someday soon he and Cas would have one of their own.
“I haven’t gotten there yet, but I wanted to petition
Finally, after a new set of linens and three more contractions, he was curled on his side in the bed.  Things progressed quickly and before he knew it the medicine had kicked in and it was time to push.
Memories of the last few weeks washed over him and he felt worse and worse.  He had been an abysmal mate to Dean.  He should have noticed that he wasn’t well.  Dean hadn’t lost that much weight in the last three days.
Dean swallowed back the tears and shook his head.  “I’m fine, Jimmy.”  He glanced at Cas over his shoulder.  “Thank you for keeping me safe.”  By the look on Jimmy’s face, he understood what Dean wasn’t saying.  He pulled him in for another long kiss.
Dean pressed his lips together and shook his head.  “I haven’t made a formal announcement or anything, no, but I’ve told them.  I gotta tell you, man, it’s drastically different from what it was before, so they should be seeing it, too.”
He crossed his arms at the foolish alphas and clucked his tongue.  He felt like an old maid standing on the porch fussing at the alphas, but he didn’t care.  They were being stupid.  Dean knew they needed the outlet but he still didn’t like it.  Why couldn’t they just talk to each other?  Shout and scream and all that, but not physically fight.
“Dean, we don’t want to upset you.  It’s not about us and Luke.  If you wanted to come with us we didn’t want you to have to deal with him again.”
He felt shaky and sweaty at the thought of doing things for Dean, but he knew it was time to try and figure out what kind of future they could have together.
> Hey Cass had a good time last night  R U free tonight?
He lay there for several minutes before he realized that he needed to let people know what was happening.  He pulled his phone from his pants pocket and pulled up the texting app.
He counted the freckles that dotted his cheeks and nose.  He watched the gentle movement of his eyes under translucent lids.  He watched the dark lashes rest against his skin.  The gentle swell of his lips and the cut of his jaw caught his attention as well.
The combination of Cas’ ass tightening and his hand on his knot pushed Dean over the edge and he came with a loud grunt, spilling inside of Cas’ warmth.  Cas wrapped his legs around Dean’s waist and Dean came again with a shudder.
Dean was distracted from his thoughts by a soft kiss on the side of his neck.  Right where a mating mark would go someday.  Dean shivered at Cas’ touch and bared his neck to his Alpha.  Regardless of what the future held, Cas was here now and he was Dean’s Alpha for however long he’d have him.  Long, tan arms corded with muscle snaked their way around his waist as Cas leaned his chin on Dean’s shoulders.
Dean could hear Sam’s soft laugh on the other end of the line.  “See you soon, De.”
They shared a glance and Dean nodded, turning back to him.  “Yea, we’re done.  I’m on my way.”  Dean picked up a bowl of potato salad and moved past them out the door.
“Very good.”  He turned to the nurse and gave her instructions.  Once he was done she bustled over to the equipment and began to make adjustments while Crowley stood at the end of the bed with his laptop open.
He pressed his hands between his thighs to try and stop the shaking and took several deep breaths.  The mating and pregnancy hormones were running rampant through his body and it made him feel slightly sick.  He hoped that he would be okay here on the wall while he waited for Cas.
“Lucifer wants to start a war,” he told the people around him.  “He’s counting on it,” Dean continued as the pieces started falling into place in his head.  “He thinks that I’ll rage when Cas is missing and lash out to the first thing that might make sense, which is the knife.  There is no other reason that this would happen the day after the leadership ceremony.  He’s counting on the fact that I’m the Alpha now.”  Dean shook his head in disbelief.
He looked at himself in the mirror and felt numb.  The omega that stared back at him looked exhausted and haunted.  He had circles under his eyes and his cheeks were hollow.  He growled at himself and grabbed the toothpaste and brushed his teeth.  He didn’t need to look in the mirror again.
“I think so, why?  Did he intend to follow and come to the ER?  He sounded fine when I spoke with him.”
“Merry Christmas Emma,” he greeted her quietly.  He ran a hand down the back of her head as he spoke.
Charlie and Gabe were waiting when they arrived and Dean pulled Charlie along with them as they moved into the hallway.  He saw Gabe fall in line behind her.  A nurse stepped out to stop Dean and he growled at her.  Dean was too focused on Cas’ whereabouts to care if he had been rude, or really even realize what he had done.  Omegas rarely growled.
Currently, I have several unfinished fics that I'm working on.  I'm hoping to get one finished and start posting soon.   I'm always looking for prompts and ideas, so feel free to pass anything along you might like to see!
Dean felt the sofa dip next to him and he turned his face to crack his eyes open.  Jimmy was next to them and Dean could see the bulge in his pants and scent his arousal.
“It’s ok if you’re not,” he finally said.  Cas looked into his green eyes and felt a swell of emotions.
“How on earth did you remember that Emma?” Dean asked her.  He was amazed at how her mind was growing and her memory was working more and more.
“Are you ready?” the alpha asked as he checked his watch.  “We need to go.”
“Hi,” Dean whispered.
“I said I was looking forward to going to the omega spa.  I called already and made an appointment for next week.”
Without thinking about it he strode towards her.  She opened her eyes, which widened in fright, as he approached.  He slowed down and smiled at her.  He hoped he wouldn’t scare her further, but he felt a strong need to do something to help her.
Jimmy and Cas nodded in unison and Amelia smiled a real smile and leaned over to press her lips to Jimmy’s.  Dean turned back to the sink and began to load the dishwasher again.  He was thinking about the exchange and how Amelia had spoken to the alphas.  She had been strong and hadn’t backed down.  Dean hadn’t seen anything like that from an omega before.  And the alphas weren’t angry with her.  In fact, they conceded that she was right to be angry.
Cas knew that Jimmy wanted a mate and pups and wanted them before now, so he knew they wouldn’t wait long to mate and probably not that long to pup, either.  He was looking forward to having Amelia as his sister-in-law, and his appreciation for her continued to grow as he saw her and Jimmy together more frequently.
She nodded and turned away with the food.  Cas didn’t let Dean out of his arms and guided him upstairs and into his room.  He helped Dean lay down on the bed and took his shoes off.  The omega closed his eyes and Cas sat on the edge of the bed with him.
They made a good team together once they got started.  Dean was impressed with Cas’ cooking skills and they laughed together.  It was effortless and Dean felt himself continue to relax at being home.
Dean nodded and gave him a small smile.  “I know, but it’s hard to make my heart understand that.  They’re my family and I should just go and tell them to fuck off, but I can’t.  I don’t know why.”
Cas had thought that the sickness was getting better, but maybe it wasn’t.  Dean’s scent was muted with misery and exhaustion and Cas wished that he could take away this part for his omega.
“I’ve never had three orgasms in one knot before,” he said.  Jimmy propped himself up on his elbow at Dean’s shoulder.  Dean just grinned.  “I wonder what other fun things they taught you that we can discover,” he mused.
“I should have expected that,” Cas sighed.  He ran a hand through his hair as he leaned on the counter.  Dean saw Jimmy nod.
Dean blinked back into focus when he realized that Cas was standing behind him.  He could see him in the mirror.  His scent and expression were full of concern.
“Ok, so I see a full pot of coffee, is that how much you usually make?”
“Do you think it’s ok that we are bonding differently with Dean?”
Dean huffed and readjusted his hands folded on his chest.  “Damn right I hate it when you stereotype me.”
Cas nodded in agreement.  “I spoke to my brother, Gabe, earlier when we got home.  He’s the one I’m the closest with and that runs the company with me.  I also called my parents, Chuck and Naomi.  They are currently in Europe and will probably be there for a while still.  Hannah, my younger sister, is there too, working.  They live there half the year and here half the year.  There are international offices in France and Germany that they run.  I’ll call them later and talk to them more.”
Dean stood outside and watched alphas go in and out for most of the day.  One of the omegas came out to talk to him and Dean asked him questions about what it was like.  It sounded horrible, but the omega told him it was better than ending up dead on the street one day.  The omega also told him it was a bonus when they were in heat and the alpha was in rut because being knotted while in heat was better than dealing with it on their own.
The other alpha at the table turned at the growl, eyebrows raised.  Dean felt very vulnerable all of a sudden.  He clung to the back of Cas’ trench coat trying to anchor himself.  There were three alphas in the room, one of which he knew was a threat, one of which he knew would protect him and one he knew nothing about.  This was so much worse than he thought it was going to be.
“Yes, though I wish it had been quicker.  He’s sleeping now and Chuck’s with him.”  She nodded, satisfied.
Cas had enough playing and took the first jab, achieving a glancing blow off of his brother’s jaw.  After that they got down to business.  Cas wanted to be the first to knot the omega and he was going to make damn sure that he won today against his brother.  He didn’t examine why he wanted it so badly.
Anyway, you all are so wonderful!  Thank you!
Her brows flew up in the opposite direction.  “You think so?  Did something happen?”  She looked around to see if there was anything out of the ordinary that might give her a clue as to what had could be amiss.
It was customary to throw a small mating party after the couple had made things official, so Dean and Cas were hosting a small gathering at their home two weekends after.  Dean was excited to show off his bite to everyone and share their joy.
He finally pulled his thoughts back to the present and sliced up the pizza.  He automatically reached for a beer from the fridge but decided at the last minute that he would just get a glass of water.  He filled it from the tap and settled on the couch to eat and watch Netflix.
Dean turned and felt slightly lightheaded at the movement.  He blinked a few times to get his equilibrium back.  He placed his hand on the door frame to steady himself and looked at Cas questioningly.
Dean sighed and scented the air.  Cas’ scent was laced with pain and frustration, but there was no rejection to it.  “You woke up when I left to visit the Council for a little while.  I needed to make sure that the pack was safe and the soldiers that had stayed would be cared for and relieved.  I needed to discuss with the Council.”
Dean thought he did do a lot of work today. “Okay fine. We’ll go to bed. Don’t tell Sam.”
Dean smiled, big and bright, “Yeah it does. So Cas, do you want to go out on a date with me?”
“See you.” He closed the door slowly, maintaining eye contact.
“Cas? What do you mean hoping? Did...Did you want to go on a date with me?”
“Well you’re gonna need some of this first,” She pointed further down the aisle, “then you can look at some flowers, and there are some decorations in the aisle to your right. Is there anything specific you are after?”
“Nah. Just couldn’t sleep.” The nightmares replayed themselves in his mind, and he had to repress a shudder. He took a swig of his beer.
Sam found them a few hours later, In Dean’s bed. Tangled around each other in every which way, Dean’s snores filling the room. He wondered what the hell he had missed.
After he paid for his array of garden items and awkwardly stuffed everything into the back seat of the Impala, Came with the task of how the hell was he gonna get everything into the house without revealing his project.
Dean had one of them pinned up against the wall with a knife to their throat when there was a shout from the other room. He quickly took care of the vampire before rushing over.
“Okay, open your eyes,” Dean whispered
Dean stammered, he couldn’t comprehend it. Someone being in love with him. “Why? How do you know I won’t fuck it up?” he croaked. Somehow the fact that they just met mere hours ago didn’t bother him. It rather put him at ease, there was something about Cas that lured him in, made him want to spend every waking moment with him. It was like they had known each other for a lifetime, and Dean felt more seen than he had in a long time.
Dean stared in shock.
“What do you do for a job, Cas?”
His date took this as an opportunity to tell him
Cas was shaken out of his thoughts at the sound of Dean settling himself on the sectional navy blue couch in front of their Tv.
“Nah, you were totally working on presents.”
Castiel squinted his eyes at Dean for a moment like he was making sure Dean wasn’t lying. The soft smile returned to his face. “So? Do you?”
Cas beamed, “No.”
Cas tilted his head confused, “I’ve been acting weird…?” He paused doing his eye squint thing, “I suppose I am a bit nervous.”
“Yes! Why else would you isolate yourself in our room the entire day?”
Dean gently grabbed the ring from Cas and shoved it on his finger, “Hell yeah I’m wearing it Cas. It’s beautiful.” The ring was silver, simple but sweet with a blue and green stone wrapped around each other at the top.
"It's either that or suspension and a meeting with your father."
Dean's inner omega preened and made happy squeals.
“Oh… Finding Dory?” Eileen proposed.
“It wasn’t much of a choice…”
“What? This isn’t about him, it’s about you. How are you?”
"You back there, silence or I will send you both in detention."
They took Dean’s Audi and drove to the closest McDonalds they could find. Once settled with food in front of them, Dean opened his mouth.
“I said hands above your head!” Cop 2 yelled at Dean. He couldn’t believe this shit.
“Hello, Dean” in that raspy, low voice he thought he would never, ever hear again.
“I have to say…densely packed, overwhelming in complexity, overall an interesting experience. Although I have to admit it’s NOT my favorite molecule arrangement. It tasted better when I was human” Cas answered
“I saw enough on his computer, yes. Killing him is the only logical conclusion.”
“Nah, we’ll search for a more…alcoholic pirate experience, maybe go for a walk or just…sit on the beach some more.”
They walked in silence for a bit, Eileen tugging big fluffs of candy while Cas was picking small bite-sized bits off his.
Cas nodded but before he could fly away Sam’s hand stopped him
"I'm fine."
“Yeah, I do, now back off or pick on someone your own size. Do you get off from beating kids that can’t fight back?”
“We…” Becky wanted to start talking but Brad interrupted her.
“As I said, I didn’t look at the shooters too much. I didn’t want to give them reasons to
, and I’ll drag you to Purgatory and leave you there. Hell wouldn’t be much of punishment with your friend Rowena in charge.”
“I want pups, Cas. Not now though.”
“I think it’s a bit small and it has a manual inflation knot which is tiresome.”
Dean chose a skateboard with skulls and a black, nondescript city helmet. While in the protection devices aisle he also picked up a high-viz jacket. This time the cashier eyed the card and snickered when he looked Dean up and down.
Dean faltered, “Uh, maybe! Sounds promising.” she nodded smiling.
“Oh! And Brokeback Mountain!” He shouted maybe a little too loud.
“Oh? Well, I uh..got you a gift too. I just can’t bring it inside.”
“Oh!” Dean exclaimed, “We can get a bench tomorrow so you can come out here and read.”
“Okay, let’s do this.” he tossed Cas a gun loaded with dead man's blood bullets.
