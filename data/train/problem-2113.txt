As the ship rocked from side to side and we were tossed about in our meager quarters I began to empathize. I saw that O’Conner and Doran and Madden had hearts as sick and sad as I. They worried over families they thought they’d never see again, fights unresolved, lovers unloved, lives that they weren’t able to live and before I knew it I’d begun to sing.
I closed my book and let it slide to the floor to greet our pot. His elbows were on my knees now. If I were to lie I’d say I wasn’t lost in his eyes at that moment. I leaned closer to him, and of course, of course he did too.
Days later he came back to me. Even in my fake-sleep I could see him approaching, for my eagle eyes were always watchful, and I slowly opened my other eyes and stretched some of my jaws. I righted myself and floated closer to him. He opened his mouth as if to ask if I was ready but with my four heads and his several lifetimes of experience with looking at them, he could tell I was as ready as I’d ever be.
When I joined the navy I was not expecting to do as many repetitive tasks as were required. When I scaled the ropes and walked thin boards as easily as if I were flying, I was not very impressed. Still it was something to do to stave off the loneliness and boredom.
“Hm. Then, let’s share it. I’ll make a bigger bonus on this alone then we would collectively if we mined it together, so, I’ll treat you to dinner on the ship. How about that?”
We rushed forward and didn’t stop until we had made a small dent in the crowd from running into it. Suddenly the base erupted in cheers, Molly ran inside and brought us both a beer each.
He pulled out 50 quid and threw it on the rug between us. I got up to fetch my wallet from my coat pocket, and slapped my own 50 quid on top of his. He nodded at me and I nodded back.
I read the article about a youth who claimed to be in love with two boys and could not discern which she fancied most. I agreed with the advice given but did not understand why the article could be of particular importance. Looking up from the paper hoping to convey my question I saw Sherlock tip salt into his mouth straight from the shaker. I lowered my eyebrows in a mock-scolding expression before rolling my eyes.
“Right.” As his talons bit into my flesh I knew he approved of my idea. He flew off to work out the problems and I pretended to go back to sleep. I briefly thought that perhaps God may be a tyrant king. I knew I’d soon be abandoned by god, for better or worse.
"There is an art to flying, or rather a knack. The knack lies in learning how to throw yourself at the ground and miss. … Clearly, it is this second part, the missing, that presents the difficulties…"
Opening the door I caught eyes with my flatmate and nodded, wondering if he’d noticed yet. I hung my coat on the hook and made my way to the electric kettle. I eyed the water level and decided to add more water before flicking the switch and preparing two mugs. I temporarily allowed my mind to wander over to the thought of the parallel weak American tea and weak British coffee. Well then I noticed the blue light flick off in my peripheral vision, and I hurried to pick up the kettle before the water cooled.
He started pulling at my jumper, and I was quite excited for that. I pulled the jumper over my head and started unfastening any button I could find on his person. Abruptly, He stood up.
I rinsed off his knee with soap and water, and let that dry for a bit. He kept looking away from me while I waited for it to dry, and I realized it was because I was kneeling right in front of him. I coughed and rubbed the Neosporin onto his knee.
I sighed. “You tease.” But I bit my tongue too late. He raced over to the rug and pocketed the 100 quid, then raced down the stairs before I could properly get dressed and follow him.
“Well, I figured it’s gotta be more interesting than deducing the childhood woes of addicts on the streets.”
Beads of condensation dotted the upper lip of Sherlock’s mug as I silently placed it by him. As I reached my own mug I tried to brush off a bit of flea dirt from my finger. Better wash my hands, then.
He slumped down into the covers, looking incredibly embarrassed. I couldn’t help but laugh loudly. I took out my e-reading pad, and started to read. I peered above the light of the pad and past my illuminated eyelashes to see that he was still wide awake, and clearly uncomfortable. I straightened my back and began to read aloud.
She looked very surprised and spouted some words I couldn’t understand in an inquisitive tone. I looked at her confused which prompted her to repeat a phrase.
While thoroughly immersed into the story of the great American frontier, I hadn’t noticed Holmes get up. I hadn’t noticed him push his chair close to mine. I hadn’t noticed how close we were until I adjusted my reading position and realised my book was resting on his lap instead of mine.
It was always a give-and-take sort of thing with us, always a dialogue, even without words. I felt this longing for him, the kind that never went away, but made me glow when I had him in my arms.
Oh but love we did, one in fascination and one in kinsmanship. I saw myself in them while he saw something uniquely different. I’m not sure what happened. I think I saw her reaching outwards and thought that it may be nice for her to know as much as I. I think he saw her as an opportunity to know more. We were not supposed to know greed, and as they put on cloaks of shame we grew the wings of an eagle, the body of a lion, and the head of a king. I saw too much but he saw too little.
Often I would turn to the side of my shoulder, expecting to see Sherlock curled up in my wing, so I could ask him what to do or how to do it, and every time I felt a pang of self loathing, I felt his crushing absence, I felt my heart struggling even as there were less places it needed to supply blood to.
A smile greeted my features and I shook my head indicating he’d done nothing to particularly garner my anger.
I was laying in bed, restless, sweaty, and eager to get back on the ship. I wrote up my paperwork but there was no point in checking my credits since I couldn’t use them on the uncomfortable base. I could take a shuttle back up to the ship but there wouldn’t be any point, there’d be nobody to cook the meals I’d pay for, or even to chat with. Even though we are a skeleton crew, there are still only five people up there. Monitoring, Repairing, Standing by.
wrote this poem for practice and i wanted to post it to tide y'all over till the next chapter is ready. John is on the left side and Sherlock is on the right side.
In the beginning we had no form. We were assigned to guard the first humans, the first plants, the beginning of the end. We fell in love over time, we knew we could not love these children fresh from the womb, they were too young, and far too fragile. Who would bank something as precious as love on something so new, so eager to die? Besides it was not our place to love.
John's mother's smile seemed to have the same effect as John's because Sherlock found the corners of his mouth tipping up into a grin. Sherlock remembered his own mother. She had short black hair that fell in curls akin to Sherlock's, but her features were warmer. While both of her sons had odd, opalescent eyes, hers were a deep blue, like the sea. Her skin had always been deathly pale, but warm in a way that only mothers seemed to achieve. When she had divorced his father, she had refused custody of her children, claiming that she had other things she'd rather be doing than looking after teenagers. His father had blamed them and showed them accordingly. The only comfort Sherlock had received during that time was when Mycroft would come home from work to find Sherlock holding back teats. He would always whisper "Remember, Sherlock,  caring is not an advantage."
Next to him stood a woman. She was considerably younger, and was cleary starting to catch feelings for a colleague, but not the one with her. Also not a threat.
Sherlock scowled at it. "Horrible, I can't believe this looked nice in the picture." His scowl deepened as the nosy salesperson came back with a velvet burgundy suit.
Sherlock looked at her with pity. "No, he has enough money to afford a very nice hotel, and he takes sleeping pills for insomnia, he stayed up late last night, away from home."
Whenever there was a lull in cases, John made Sherlock go outside at least once a day. Sherlock refused unless John joined him. So, they frequently went on walks through Regents Park together.
John stepped forward and smashed their lips together, they stayed like that until Sherlock needed air.
"It was amazing as always, John. Since you did this, I'll clean up." Sherlock took John's hands in his own.
"Fine, let's just say that Captain Watson will be making an appearance." Sherlock's eyes became even brighter. He got to work addressing envelopes, while John wrote more personal, sentimental things on the inside of the little cards.
While John helped set things up, Sherlock stayed back and played the violin out of nervousness. He was finally marrying the man who he'd loved so much and for so long. Molly came out in her lilac dress he'd picked out with her, and he had to admit she looked nice. Once he got bored of the violin, he went over all the plans, and eventually passed along to deducing people who walked by.
"It looks lovely, are you planning on buying it?" His voice was cheery, as all the other salespeople's voices were.
“Yeah, but maybe someone forced them to take it? From what I’ve heard, the police are hardly ever right.” They were debating if the suicides were actually murder.
"... but, you aren't allowed to put this in your blog, the police said they wanted to avoid a scandal." John jolted out of his reverie.
This is the end, I was considering writing about their honeymoon, but I'm not quite ready to write smut yet? So that's it, I hope you enjoyed it.
"Sherlock what about this one?" John sounded tired, and reasonably so. This was the umpteenth suit he'd tried on that day, it was an ugly off white colour.
Sherlock had the room to himself. John, Harry, and Mrs Hudson had left to go shopping an hour ago, so considering they had to get two beds, a few more clothes, and some personal hygiene products, they shouldn't be back for another hour and a half. He had plenty of time to work on his latest experiment, the effects of sulfuric acid on hardwood flooring. On his desk he had samples of ash, beech, cherry, elm, iroko, and mahogony. Almost everything was set up and ready to go, but he couldn't find one of his beakers. He looked through the pile of whatever on the end of his bed and found nothing of use. He then shuffled through his half of the chest of drawers, still nothing. He looked anywhere it could possibly be, and still came up empty handed. Only John's things were left.
"Oh, well that's everybody then." Sherlock's face lightened up again., "And I'm sure the wedding will be great without them anyways."
"Well, it was fairly interesting. I don't understand how daft I was. The whole time it was obviously the sister, but I never saw the clues..." John really tried to listen, but he couldn't help but notice the way Sherlock's curls shook when he talked, and how his eyes glittered when he talked about the exciting parts of the case. He let out a contented sigh.
"I've never been happier, not when I even when I was with Mary." Sherlock stiffened at the mention of John's ex-wife, but then relaxed.
"I see this city every day, but it still shocks me." the two men were lying on their backs, waiting for the stars to come out.
The preacher stepped forwards in between the two newly-weds and broke the moment again. "Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you Dr and Mr Watson-Holmes." The upbeat music they had chosen started playing as people cheered, and the two men grabbed each other and kissed as passionately as possible without letting it lead to more physical activities. They pulled away and walked back down the aisle, hand in hand, towards the little gazebo where they were going to sign the papers.
John snuggled deeper into Sherlock's shoulder, breathing in the taller man's scent. A mix of chemicals, lavender, and after-shave.
"Hey love," Sherlock got up and kissed John's cheek. "I thought we could go out for some lunch, and then come back to try some more suits."
"Hey, it's ok, love. I'm scared too. But things will be the same as before. Why don't we take this one day at a time, ok?"
“Um yeah that works, but how did you know I have a sister?” Sherlock felt a small smirk appear on his face.
I'm not actually sure how weddings go, so I kind of just guessed. Sorry if there are any spelling errors.
"She's waiting for a call from her... daughter. One of her grandchildren is sick and she's waiting to hear an update. Her husband died many years ago, but she's hoping to meet someone and possibly have some fun. She also has a gerbil, no three gerbils who are new, possibly to replace an old pet who died fairly recently." John clapped and Sherlock bowed and smiled.
“Of course, sorry. I’ll just go get my stuff then.” John headed back out of the room and Sherlock felt slightly empty, but he ignored the feeling and went back to studying his toenail clippings.
With a sigh he flopped onto his bed and stared at the couch, soon to be replaced by John's bed. John. There was something about being near him that gave Sherlock a sense of security and belonging, but he wasn't sure what it was. Sherlock didn't have "friends" and he had never intended to, but his new roommate made him want to make at least one.
"Oh yeah, it should be great. Now let's do the invitations, if you're quiet and work well, I'll treat you."
I also changed the title of the story to "Ivre sur toi" which means "Drunk on you" (because French is so pretty).
John answered so Sherlock wouldn't make a fool of himself. "Yes, I think we'll take both of them." He gestured to the suit he had just been wearing, which was now folded messily beside him.
“We’re with New Scotland Yard. I’m Greg and this is Sally.” Greg gestured to himself and then Sally. “Since you have nowhere to go and it’s bloody cold out here, do you want to come with us? We’ll take you somewhere where you’ll be looked after.” Sherlock contemplated running away, but Greg was right, it was freezing out. He nodded.
John quickly pressed a kiss into Sherlock's right shoulder blade. He whispered, "I love you." into the ivory skin, and attempted to draw the taller man closer. As an answer, Sherlock turned around in his sleep, one of his lanky arms smacking his husband square in the face. John tried to be hurt but he couldn't when Sherlock's hands wrapped around his waist, cuddling the older man into the nape of his pale neck. John let himself fall back asleep, while breathing in the sweet scent of his adorable husband. Domestic bliss.
"Change of plans Sherlock, I cooked! We have Shepherd's pie, our favourite." John took the steaming pie out and placed it on the table, where he proceeded to pull out a chair for Sherlock.
He looked through the drawers John had been given but the only things he found were a few pairs of jeans and a jumper. John's duffel bag still had a few things in it, so he decided to check there. He had to push two horrid jumpers out of the way to reach the bottom, but there was still no beaker. He did find the slip of paper from earlier though.
Again, I'm sorry this chapter is so short, I don't have much time for writing, and once the story actually starts, the chapters should be longer.
While Sherlock cleaned the dishes he heard John open and close several cupboards and drawers, but he had no idea what his boyfriend was looking for.
After he properly woke up, John turned around to appreciate the full beauty of his dormant lover. While awake, Sherlock always looked suspicious, ready for anyone to be the murderer. While asleep, the mask was gone, and he looked so vulnerable.
For another twenty minutes, he searched for it, but never had any luck. By the time he had turned the room upside down and then right side up again, there was only five minutes until everyone should be home, which was definitely not enough time to complete his experiment. He cursed at the clock as he cleaned up the hardwood samples and plugged up the beaker containing the acid.
The new boy’s hand was slightly clammy, but his warm smile made up for it. He introduced himself as John, simple name, simple person. When the handshake ended, John looked around the room that prior to this day, Sherlock had had to himself.
Sherlock could already feel his face swelling into a handprint as he ran across the street. He didn’t stop running until there was a few streets of difference in between him and the flat. Only then did he realize that he actually had nowhere to go. He looked at the street he was on. He was only about a block away from the British Museum, but at this hour they wouldn’t let him in. He decided on Regent’s Park and headed in the direction of the Gardens. He shivered and wished he had brought his coat with him, after all, it was not smart to go out during winter in a t-shirt.
"So, the book changed you that much, hey?" John couldn't help admiring the wild look of passion in Sherlock's eyes. Their normal iciness was replaced with a determined burning.
“How old do you reckon he is?” Sherlock opened his eyes, and the bright light from a torch shot a jolt of pain ringing through his head. Whoever was holding it quickly pointed it towards the ground, leaving Sherlock blinking spots from his eyes. When he could finally see again, he sat up and evaluated the people in front of him.
John subconsciously leaned into the shoulder and breathed in another deep breath of Sherlock. "Well I know that, but I never get the time to properly just look at them. Aren't they amazing, love?"
People milled about, and came up to congratulate John and Sherlock. Since both of Sherlock's parents were dead, and John's weren't there, there were no "final dances", just first ones. The music started playing, a slow waltz and John dragged Sherlock out to the clearing where the tables used to be. Sherlock having longer arms, wrapped them around John's waist, and John rested his on Sherlock's hips. They stepped in the steps they had been rehearsing for months. Some people even teared up, and John felt a tear drop onto his head. Sherlock was crying too. Sherlock kissed his head. John hugged him tighter.
"John, the stars are always there, how have you never noticed them?" Sherlock let himself fall back down on the blanket and interlaced his fingers with John's.
John was nervous, Sherlock could tell. It was written in the lines on his forehead and the slight crease in his brow. So he squeezed his boyfriend's hand a little harder. They were at the London Pride March and John had never been, but Sherlock had been going for years.
John sighed and pulled back his share of the duvet, accidentally turning his detective away from him.
Pain burst through his head, and he was forced to step back to take the impact. His head was ringing, but he still held back his tears. His dad raised his hand again, but he brought it down to an empty space, as his son was already at the door of their small flat pulling on his shoes. Within the minute, the door was slammed shut, and the young genius was gone.
The next float was specifically for lesbians. Everyone had some sign of the pink striped flag. John relaxed a little more.
"My husband is so cute." was all John could think, and he wasn't wrong. Sherlock was wrapped in his own cocoon of warmth, shaded from the daily horrors they dealt with.
By the end of it all, John was smiling and even danced as long as Sherlock joined him. They went and got fish and chips, then went to Regent's Park for the multicoloured fireworks. Much like a cheesy movie, they shared several kisses under the bursts of light.
"Ok, let's get this done with, and then you two can go take your photos." He had a friendly smile on.
"Oh Sherlock! Of course I will! I love you so much, I can't wait to spend my life with you." Sherlock wiped the grass off of his pants and placed the ring on John's hand. John lurched forwards and kissed his lover deeply. Sherlock instinctively wrapped his arms around the smaller man.
“That was… wow that was amazing! Well the last part was.” Sherlock made a mental note to try and make John smile more because his whole face lit up if only for a few seconds.
And with that, both men walked off to their room, ready to show each other how much they really were in love.
“Hello. I’m Mike Stamford, your social worker. We’re going to try and be as fast as we can so I can get you kids somewhere, so I need you to answer as truthfully as possible. Alright?” John and Harry nodded. “First, can you tell your names and ages?”
It was John who said it first. The two lovers were sitting in their usual chairs reading. Sherlock was reading a book that John had suggested, and John was reading one of the many essays Sherlock had written. John wasn't really reading though. How could he with his beautiful boyfriend sitting across from him. He kept stealing glances at the brunette, making him lose his place and read the same sentence over and over again. Lucky for him, Sherlock was completely wrapped up by "Fahrenheit 451" and didn't notice. Sherlock shut the book, and slammed it down on the coffee table, which gave John a reason to look at his boyfriend.
"Sherlock, it's been three months. All we have planned is when we're getting married, where we're getting married, and who's invited. We haven't even sent invitations out." He was walking around the flat, looking for his fiancé.
The plan was to have a reception dinner, so everyone who was invited went back to their rooms in the near-by hotel. John and Sherlock drove to the hall they had booked, and got everything together. There were tables covered in white table clothes with little lilacs in the centre. There was to be a buffet. They were serving beef, and fish, since none of their guests were vegetarians. They also had creampuffs for a dessert, since neither of them liked cake. Finally, it was six, and the sun hadn't set yet since it was the summer. The guests arrived, and everyone ate their food. Until it was time for the speeches.
When they were back form their break, there was a new saleswoman on shift. Sherlock noticed she was new, so she didn't make small talk. John was back in the change room trying on a black-navy coloured suit. Since it was a three piece suit it took a little longer than the other ones.
Sherlock closed the distance between them, his soft, pink lips smushing John's dry ones. It was a short, but passionate kiss that left both men wanting more.
John went first. "Sherlock. I wasn't gay, but thanks to you I am. I promise to love you without condition, to honour you each and every day, to laugh with you you're happy, and to support you when you're sad. I will guide you in the right direction, challenge you to be a better person, even though you're already the best. I promise to always be your biggest fan and your ever present audience. Sherlock, with this ring I show my undying love for you, and I promise to always be yours. 'Til death do us part." John slipped the rings that had been presented before them. There was one of those Japanese number codes engraved on the inside. Love. It fit perfectly around Sherlock's precise finger. Sherlock looked close to tears, but the preacher disturbed the beautiful moment. "Mr Holmes, your turn."
After they had their moment, the two men cleaned up and walked back to the flat, sharing a blanket, and holding hands proudly. When they got back to the flat, the first thing they did was tell Mrs Hudson who was delighted to hear. She offered help planning the wedding, and agreed to leave them alone that night.
“You heard me. Get out.” He raised his hand. “Now.” Sherlock hesitated, which was his biggest mistake. The menacing hand came down and struck him hard on his right cheek.
He looked pointedly at John who swallowed hard. “Uh, I’m John and I’m sixteen.” Mike registered this information into the computer and then gestured for Harry to go.
“He started drinking. And he also started beating John. Come on John, show him.” She tugged at his arm. He faced a pleading look from Harry, and intense curiosity from Mike, and soon enough, he gave in. He tried not to wince as he took off his shirt and showed Mike his back. There were plenty of old scars, and a few fresh welts, but the worst one was one his left shoulder. His dad had thrown the neck of a broken beer bottle at him, and he now suffered from a slight tremor in his hand. Mike took it all in and began typing at his computer with seemingly new energy. John quickly put his shirt back on and waited for Mike to speak again.
The rest of the floats went in order of the acronym. LGBTQQIP2SA. After that, hundreds of businesses and a few political parties had their floats.
There were five months until the grand Watson-Holmes wedding, and the two men were trying on suits and looking at colour swatches.
"Ok, You can come in-" Sherlock barged into the lounge. There was a clearing in the middle where all the furniture should have been, and the room was lit by at least 50 candles. Sherlock noticed the stereo was brought down from John's room and now sat on a little table.
It was Molly's turn. "Hey, for any of you wondering who I am, I'm Molly, a friend of John and Sherlock's. I've known Sherlock since Uni, we were in a Chem class together, and I'm glad to call John a friend after getting to know him. I've honestly always thought John and Sherlock were a couple, so it was a surprise when they came out, but I'm so proud of them. And, even though they fit so well together, they're both quite different, with John being more open and Sherlock being quite reclusive, but I have to say, I ship it!" There was some laughter from the audience. "So, now here we are, two years after they first came out, eating food they so graciously payed for. It's absolutely beautiful how much in love these two are, so let's all wish them a life time of happiness and a long one too." Molly also raised her glass and as did everyone else. With the speeches done, people stood up as waiters came to take away the food.
"Absolutely none of it." His smile this time was even more brilliant than before. It was one of his special smiles that was saved only for John. John giggled slightly, because he had such a gorgeous boyfriend. Sherlock's eyebrows shot up a little
John entered Sherlock's arms and felt the familiar hands wrap around his waist. In turn, he put his own on Sherlock's waist, hugging him closer. John turned on the music.
“The head of New Scotland Yard’s homicide division, Gregory Lestrade himself, is working on determining if these apparent suicides aren’t actually murder…” The name Lestrade sounded familiar. Then he remembered. Only last night a grey haired man had appeared at their doorstep, bearing the horrible news of their father’s death. He had called himself by that name, but a lot had happened between then and now, and John had forgotten. But wait, if he was a homicide detective, why was he the one to tell them? Unless… Of course. Mr. Watson was an alcoholic and a terrible man when he was sober anyways. He probably had plenty of enemies, and one of them must’ve taken action. John couldn’t say he was surprised.
"It's wounds aren't too deep. You could probably ride it and stay off that leg," John suggested. "That would help with the healing and speed up our travel."
Despite his best arguments, Sherlock eventually grew tired and agreed just to shut Mycroft up. And the day after he was released, a car arrived to take him to the health club. Deciding he'd at least make use of the pool, Sherlock dressed in only a pair of tight swim trunks to go to the health club, much to his brother's dismay. Even still, it was better than utter refusal and a tantrum, so he allowed it.
"I'm John Watson. Now come on," John insisted. Then came the rope. A thin, golden rope darted out from John's hand and tied itself around Sherlock's wrist. "You're going to be a gift for Mary, my true love."
"He's just an ordinary man, brother mine. Give it time and you'll move on to someone much more.....suited to the Holmes name," Mycroft insisted.
So now Sherlock was trying to adjust. He hoped that if he slowly got used to seeing himself naked in the mirror, then he would eventually be able to be naked in front of John. That's what he was doing now, standing in his room in nothing but a dressing gown. It was one of his favourites and he'd hoped that would make him feel a bit better about what was underneath. So, standing in front of his full length mirror, he untied the gown and let the midnight blue silk fall delicately from his shoulders and pool around his bare feet. Looking at himself in the mirror, he began with his face. Angular, pale, sharp features framed by curls that only seemed to enhance how pale his skin was. All right, move on. His eyes slid down his neck, long and delicate, to his shoulders. Hardly manly at all. He'd always been more feminine in his appearance and boys in school had bullied him for it, among other things.
The young woman, having nothing but the job she was paid for on her mind, accepted the gift with a smile and entered James the Elder's room. Slipping it into his drink before they began, she had no idea what it would do. The pair tumbled around the bed, losing their clothes as they went. Everything was as expected until the prince grunted and fell back, completely still and stiff.
When he came to Sherlock, he couldn't help but grin. The tall, lanky man looked almost comical holding his feet up like this. And though he knew the pose and breathing were near perfect now, John lingered a bit more than necessary.
"Welcome aboard the Free Ship Perdita, our of the Northern Harbours on a lightning hunting expedition. Captain Bill Wiggins, at your service," the captain introduced with a grin. "Martha! Martha! Blast you, where are you?" he began to shout. "Over here! Passengers in need of assistance."
Footsteps approached then and Emma appeared with a soft smile. John stammered to get out a greeting, though he was unsure what to call her. Emma just chuckled.
The caravan began moving again, heading for the Wall. Inside, Sherlock rested on the bed, completely unaware of how close he'd come to his own demise. It takes another day of traveling before they reach the market and the caravan comes to a stop once more. Janine returned to the cage and removed John from it, returning him to his true form with a touch of the flower.
"Yes. The thing I showed you. The topaz stone that caused me to fall when it hit me," Sherlock explained. "I have to give it to the right person. The last time the right person came along, the innkeeper woman cut his throat, so I have it still. But I wish it were gone."
"When you were a dormouse, my son," Emma chuckled. "Yes. But now I have my own form back, like you, and my servitude is over. Ask Sherlock what he carries. You have the right."
When the new of his husband's imprisonment reached Sherlock, he was torn to pieces. He had to go see John, talk to him, figure out what had happened. Mycroft tried to console him, but to no avail. Just then, their mother came in.
"If I minded, I wouldn't have suggested it in the first place," the detective answered with a shrug.
After they finished chanting and had done a bit of stretching to warm up, John knew exactly what Sherlock seemed to need. He was tense and energetic today, clearly itching for a high and begging for something to occupy both his mind and body. John knew just how to fix that.
Mycroft sighed, but heard the determination in his brother's voice. "All right, all right, fine. But if you insist on doing this, you must do it properly. I can arrange the marriage quietly for you both. You cannot tell anyone about your marriage, but it should sate you both."
"All right, everyone. Let's get started," John announced after he'd finished speaking to one of his students about one of the poses. "Grab a mat, neat rows, and we'll start slow and stretch."
"Whatever, passengers are no use to me," Janine decided, shaking her head. "Just more weight for Faithless and Hopeless to pull."
John felt fine, but simply accepted the explanation to avoid losing his ride out of the forest. As they continued, the horses began to act odd as they approached a new path on the mountain.
John sighed. "All right, stay here," he murmured, inching out into the meadow and between the two massive beasts. "Here, kitty, kitty. Here's your nice crown," he cooed as though talking to a kitten, picking up the crown. "See? Now go.....fetch!" he shouted, throwing the crown as far away as he could. The lion ran off to follow it, roaring in triumph when it was captured. Turning to the unicorn, John reached out gently. "And what about you, hm?" he hummed softly.
"Yeah, but now they're talking about us. You said yourself you don't want this interfering with work. If they figure out this is true and we don't do something to stop it, they'll be calling nonstop about our relationship instead of clients calling with cases," John argued. But really there was something else bothering him about this.
"You're going," he decided, grabbing his mobile and texting Anthea. Moments later, he received a response. "There. You're now a member of a health club. They have a pool and yoga and various classes you can attend. You're going to go to as many as necessary to avoid drugs, end of story. I will send a car every day to take you and pick you up. And you know I'll know if you attempt to skip a visit or use drugs again. You may continue smoking if you must, but that's it."
"Sometimes we would sing songs like that in the night, all about our lady Mother, and the joys of shining, and of loneliness...." the star admitted.
Sherlock beamed at the suggestion and nodded instantly. "Yes, that sounds much better. I'll see you tomorrow after your usual class then?" he replied before beginning to walk out the door.
Irene eyed her suspiciously before letting out a huff and looking away. "Off with you then," she dismissed.
"He is the most dangerous man you will ever meet," the prince told him, then began glancing around. "Hm. If you ask me, there is something most unnatural about this storm."
"Congratulations then, you two. Hope it's not too much of a media circus," she chuckled. "Don't worry, I'll be the distraught, shocked ex and give them something else to look at for a bit until it dies down. You two behave, yeah?"
"Good day, sister," Janine greeted, the curse causing her to forget all about ever meeting this woman before. Not that she would be recognized in this form anyway. "What happened to your house?"
"Right below where your hand is. And diaphragmatic breathing releases tension in the neck and shoulders, causes more efficient gas exchange, re-balances the autonomic nervous system, aids in digestion, and contributes to good posture and core muscle strength," Sherlock interrupted.
"Damn," Irene muttered, putting the knives back. "Well that's all right. The knives will keep for now. After all, you're hardly planning on going anywhere until the rain lets up, are you dear?"
"No, you will not. And to tell you the truth....I was relieved to learn you are not marrying Mary Morstan," Sherlock revealed.
"I know you, Janine," Irene snarled, narrowing her gaze. "None of your damned lip. Who travels with you? For the spell of honesty you placed upon me when we last met I know place upon you."
"I will transport you to the Wall, and I sear upon my honor and my true name that I will take no action to harm you upon the journey," she agreed, then spit in her hand. "Spit in your hand," she instructed firmly.
"Oh, don't be nervous," John insisted. "You'll feel so much better when you're sitting in my mother's parlour, drinking her tea. Well, not drinking tea, but there will be tea for you to sip. Now, here's the gap. And there's my old friend, Mr. Lestrade!"
The unicorn snorted, but kneeled by Sherlock. Though the star was a bit shocked, he managed to climb up onto the creature's back with a bit of effort and seated himself comfortably, holding onto the mane as the unicorn stood once more.
"I'm honestly not that bad, y'know," John insisted. "Once you get to know me, I mean. Look, I'm sorry about all of this chaining you up business."
"Hush your silly mouth," Janine interrupted, shaking her head. "I gave you board and lodging. I got you here safely and soundly, and in the same condition I found you in. Now be off!"
"I.....well, admittedly, very little. It's never interested me. But I do know that it is unconditional. This woman, this....Mary, she seems to have plenty of conditions for you. So why bother? Just leave me in this hole and be on your way," Sherlock replied.
John sat up and chuckled a bit, smiling softly. "Is that what this is all about? You thought I was losing interest in you?" he asked, then reached forward and cupped Sherlock's cheek. "Sherlock, I love you. And I always will. Mary doesn't change that. I don't feel a thing for her. But.....let me prove it to you."
Billy nodded and left Sherlock by the fire, muttering a bit as he left the room. "The unicorn's in the farthest stall in the stable."
"Nonsense," John dismissed, then looked back to the bird. "Go on now. Someone's bound to be worrying about you."
With that, she returned to the caravan, ready to face whatever duty the witch had for her now. Sherlock was left to ponder her warning for the rest of the night.
"Sherlock? You in here?" he called softly before he stopped in his tracks. There on the bed was Sherlock in a pair of John's tight red pants, which hid even less on Sherlock as dark curls poked out from the sides. That was all he wore, his pale skin interrupted only by the red around his groin. John's jaw dropped as he stared.
"Oh, Sherlock, wonderful news! Your father has just given Victor Trevor permission to marry you in a few days! Isn't that wonderful?" she announced.
He and John had been together for nearly two years now and he knew John was getting antsy. They had never had sex, not properly. They'd fooled around, giving each other handjobs through their clothes and making each other cum in their pants through various methods. But they'd never been entirely naked with each other. John was willing to strip in front of his lover, even when he was wearing those ridiculous red shorts that were still somehow incredibly sexy. They did show off his package rather well, a few curly blond hairs poking out around the edges. But that was beside the point. He was sure John would want to actually have sex soon and, well.... Sherlock wasn't so sure he could handle it. He wanted it, he did. But he didn't want John to see him naked and there was no way to have it both ways. Either he had to let John see him naked or they couldn't have sex. Not like that.
"You're no bird, are you? You're a human, under her curse," he realized. "Well let us hope she keeps her word."
Jim waited hours longer until the dead of night, when the woman was sure to be asleep, before sneaking towards her hut.
"Should he cross the wall and enter the world of things as they are, he will become in an instant cold and dead. Of no use to us," Sally sighed.
John was absolutely crushed. He'd fallen for Mary Morstan only to get rejected time after time that he asked her out. She kept flirting with him, but he never seemed to be able to get a date with her. His friends tried to keep him upbeat, following him around with different things to do to take his mind off of her. Finally he lost them in Regents Park, grateful to get away from everyone for a bit. As he sat among the trees, trying to clear his head, he saw the most perfect creature in God's creation. A tall, slender brunet with curls as dark as night, skin pale as the moon, and eyes that seemed to pierce his very soul. Eyes the color of the sea during a storm focused intently on something, but John couldn't tell what. He just knew that this was the person he was meant to be with. Unfortunately, it was at that moment that his friends found him and led him off.
John gently removed the dressing gown, bit by bit. He slid it off of Sherlock's shoulder, pressing a gentle kiss to it.
"If I may," the doctor interrupted from the doorway before stepping in. "The nurses have informed me of your reluctance to go to therapy or to a rehabilitation center. And we have many patients who feel the same way. What I would recommend in this case is that you see a rehabilitation counselor twice a week at least, and continue seeing a medical doctor monthly so we can track your progress. And to help combat the loss of your high, I'd recommend exercise. Exercise will release endorphins--"
John couldn't help stammering as his jaw dropped, eyes wide. Mother? Could it really be true? She had seemed so familiar, but did he dare even hope?"
"Tell me what you want," Sherlock breathed before nipping at John's ear. Well that was certainly new.
"Marry him with my blessing, and we'll be quits and done" John assured. "The star will probably think so too."
Far from what one would expect of a star, he had dark curly hair and stunning blue eyes that almost seemed to change color. His pale, alabaster skin drew most in. But right now, it made him appear lifeless and cold. That is, until he woke and sat up. glancing around, he realized what must have happened. Something had hit him and he'd fallen from the sky and.....damn! He'd broken his ankle. Well, no use struggling to get out of this hole now. There was no chance until this was healed. So he glanced around, trying to plot a way out for when he was healed, when he saw something shimmering beside him. Reaching over, he discovered a necklace with a single jewel in the center. Having no idea what its significance could be, he put it on and hid it in his shirt. And there he waited until......
"Stop it," Mycroft argued, turning it back down. "You're not getting high in the hospital. You're getting treatment and you're going to stop. Smoking is one thing. But at the rate you're going, you're going to be dead before your next birthday. Now stop it!"
"I hate you," Sherlock huffed, crossing his arms over his chest with a slight pout. "I hated you for everything already, but now I hate you most of all."
"Then.....what I desire is for you to marry this man. The man you love," John decided. "I desire that you should be married as soon as possible. Within this week, if it can be arranged. And I desire that you be as happy together as any man and woman have ever been."
"Ah ah ah, tonight is all about you," the taller purred. John raised a brow, but let him continue as he reached down to undo his trousers.
"No, there isn't," Richard answered, a bit more firmly. "You were sleeping under a tree. You must be suffering from exhaustion and hallucinations."
"We accept," Sherlock told her, but received no response. It was as though she couldn't even see or hear him.
John shook his head though, refusing to let Sherlock try to dictate how the session was going to play out. "No. You're not doing chaturangas. We're going to do something simple and very useful. It's called the Corpse Pose. I'll lead you through a guided meditation and you just have to lie back and listen to me."
Jim glared, clearly angry about his demise. But he nodded, knowing he couldn't go back now. "Indeed, brothers. There are none left to take revenge on her, and none will be Lord of Stormhold."
"The heart of a star, is it?" Janine hummed curiously. "Such a prize, and all for me. And as soon as I taste it, my youth will return. And all that's left, I'll sell at the Great Market at Wall!"
"I swear to you by the rules and constraints of the sisterhood to which we both belong that I mean you no harm, and shall treat you as if you were my own guest," Irene swore as she approached.
This particular evening, the witch was preparing dinner when a visitor appeared outside her caravan. The bird squawked, alerting her to the presence of another. The hag-looking woman easily recognized her own kind, especially considering a woman of such beauty was approaching in a cart pulled by goats.
"Ah...whoever holds the Power of Stormhold is coming this way, into these mountains. I can intercept them there," he hummed to himself.
That certainly didn't sound like Sherlock and it had John curious and a bit concerned. So he followed the trail and came to their now shared bedroom, knocking lightly on the closed door before letting himself in.
"There. A bargain's a bargain. Now give me the flower," Janine demanded. John nodded, retrieving it from his pocket and handing it over easily.
As John returned home though, he found Jim Moriarty waiting for him. The man seemed to have a commanding air and demanded repayment for the way John had disgraced the Holmes family. He tried blackmail, but John refused. His friends, however, had other ideas. How could someone threaten John, after all. They stepped in, unfortunately unaware of Moriarty's guards. The battle is bloody indeed, ending in the deaths of Moriarty and one of John's friends. Another of his mates went to report what happened to the authorities. DI Lestrade was placed in charge and John was placed at fault for the murders. He was to be sent to prison immediately.
"Fewer of them and fewer of them every nine-year," Janine sighed, shaking her head. "Mark my word, slave, soon enough, this market will be just a memory."
"What am I going to do? They aren't going to let up and I don't want to marry him! I love John and we're already married," Sherlock insisted worriedly.
"Forgetting something?" Sherlock scoffed, raising his bound wrist. John attempted to remove it, but with no luck.
"Right-ho! Get ready to grab the ladder!" Wiggins instructed. Not a moment later, a rope ladder came swishing down through the clouds. John hesitated though, glancing over at Sherlock.
Sherlock smiled, looking into John's eyes. "I do," he admitted. "And I love you, John Hamish Watson."
The princes were James, Richard, and Jim. The last three surviving sons of King Moriarty of Stormhold. He was dying and would pass as soon as the new king had been named. Jim was the most ruthless of the three, as well as Richard's twin. His baby brother had lasted so long because Jim protected him from danger, deciding to avoid killing the one person who seemed to trust him completely. James, however, had no qualms about killing off his brothers. He had already poisoned and simply murdered several.
Little did he know that above him on the mountain was the witch Irene in her chariot, seeking the same treasure for her own reasons.
Sherlock's eyes widened and he shivered, looking to her chain again. "You know, John once bound me with a chain like yours. Then he freed me and I ran from him," he told her. "But then he caught me again and bound me with an obligation, something that holds me much more securely than any chain."
"Your other brother gave it to me," the woman explained as she dressed. "He claimed it was a wonderful stiffener and would provide a night I would never forget."
Sherlock's information was all written out on the certificate, all accurate. Only this time, it was true. The Holmes family discovered that their son had faked his death to be with his hidden husband, but now he really was dead. He'd taken his own life, jumping off the top of Bart's and hitting the pavement below with a sickening thud and crack. He was really and truly dead. Perhaps he could be with the man he loved now, they thought. But the feud needed to end. The families reconciled and each paid for a golden statue of the other's son. So they may remember the lesson their sons taught them about love and the price of their feud.
"We're on a cloud...." he muttered, looking around. "Here, put your hand right here," he instructed, knowing John's hand had gotten burnt from holding the candle as it burned out. The cloud helped relieve some of the pain, the cool air washing over his injured wrist.
The Holmes manor was massive, the biggest house in town. The party was in full swing by the time John and his friends arrived, so they all headed their separate ways. His friends planned on getting drunk and really partying. But John was still hooked on his mystery lover. Until....
When John had his usual lunch break, he had a small meal before deciding to look around and see if Sherlock was at the club at all. Wandering through the building, he ended up at the pool and spotted a messy head of soaked curls by the side. Sure enough, Sherlock had been at the pool for hours swimming and occupying himself. Since he was getting a private session later, he'd decided to find another way to occupy his time until then. And since Mycroft insisted he use the health club membership, the pool seemed to be a good option.
"Now, what did I say about breathing?" he scolded, standing behind the other. "Coincidentally" his hips ended up pressed against Sherlock's arse as his hands were placed on the man's chest and diaphragm. "Now deep breath, focus on using your diaphragm."
"Perhaps I will....I only wish my mother were out, so I could say goodbye to her first," Sherlock thought aloud.
"All right, this one's always a favorite. It's got a couple of different names. Usually either the Dead Bug pose or the Happy Baby pose. I prefer Happy Baby pose, but to each their own," he chuckled before demonstrating the pose. After a moment, he stood and walked through to check everyone's poses. "Good, good, everyone seems to be getting this one. If you're feeling too much pain, let it go. But a little extra stretching is good."
"What?" John asked, tilting his head. "Sherlock......what's going on? Do you think you aren't attractive?"
john huffed, heading for the door of the caravan to leave. Sherlock woke behind him, following him to the door.
John nodded and thanked her, watching as she left before turning back to Sherlock. They set out their yoga mats to face one another so John could check Sherlock's poses and Sherlock would be able to see John demonstrate any pose he had difficulty with.
"Meditation?! That isn't going to help me at all!" Sherlock snapped. He'd meditated in his mind palace before as a memory technique, but never for its own sake. How was sitting there doing nothing going to help him?
"On the other hand..." John hummed, pulling back. "It occurs to me now that I would be better off keeping the flower. My companion and I can walk to the Wall."
"There's a new drug my lab has been working on. It seems to put users into a sleeping state, but they lose any traceable signs of life. No pulse, no heartbeat. They appear dead and any examiner will believe it. Especially if they work for me," Mycroft replied. "I can get the drug for you and make it appear as though you died of drug overdose. A funeral will be held and we can place a body double in your casket. You'll be able to sneak off and see your husband, run off with him. And no one will know."
"Not without the power of Stormhold around his neck, he isn't," James countered. "And then there's the matter of revenge. Remember, one of us was killed by someone outside the family. He must avenge our brother's death before anything else now. It's blood law."
"Oh, you silly man. That can't be true, now can it? Tell me, honestly, how does it feel?" she insisted.
Time passed and Sherlock's leg began to heal, enough that he was able to get around on his own. He was thrilled by this development, and John was relieved to see the star so happy. His own hand was healing as well, the burn nearly a memory as he awoke in the early morning. Blinking the sleep from his eyes, he tried to focus on what had woken him at such an early hour. Sure enough, there was singing above on the deck, a beautiful sound unlike anything John had ever heard before. Following the sound, he made his way to the main deck to find Sherlock singing to himself and dancing slowly.
John blushed a bit at the suggestion as he stood, but nodded. "I guess you're right.....It's a bit late to be going home now. If you really don't mind, I'll stay," he agreed.
With that, they left, heading back to the market until they found an unoccupied patch of grass under a tree. John was exhausted by now and laid down to rest while Sherlock watched the stars above. Suddenly there came footsteps from nearby and Sherlock looked around to spot the woman from before.
As the woman began heading for the kitchen, Sherlock shouted after her, "That's all right, I don't really......eat food...." He quieted by the end and shrugged it off, settling in the tub and content with the knowledge that there were still those who wouldn't want to harm him.
"Because," she began, taking a deep breath, "the day before we saw the shooting star, I accepted another proposal. And then you'd taken me seriously and run off to find me a star, and I promised you my hand if you returned with it."
"I, um......A certain muscle seems to be....tensing," Sherlock commented with a slight cough, glancing at his groin.
"John, be quiet! She can't see me or hear me," Sherlock told him. Little did they know that this was Janine, the very witch who'd tried to trick Irene earlier and had been cursed as a result.
Inside the inn, Sherlock had left the bath and accepted a robe offered by the innkeeper's wife, limping into a chair to relax. He certainly felt much better, but hardly failed to notice the set of knives on another table nearby.
Sherlock stopped, frowning down at John. "What do you mean? Isn't it obvious? I'm having sex with you and giving you everything you want," he insisted, then sighed as he sat back on his legs. "Isn't this what one does to make his boyfriend gain interest again?"
Once he'd made up his mind, there was no stopping John. He did more research than it seemed he'd ever done before, looking at pressure points on the body and yoga poses to help with certain muscles and various ways to use yoga to help treat addictions. While he didn't know what substances Sherlock used, he could at least figure out a general way to approach this and then work from there. There were many articles about how yoga helped recovery, but very few on actual yoga poses that helped. So John created his own regime for Sherlock. They could try it out the next day and if it didn't seem to work, they'd adjust it and try again. But Sherlock needed help and John was just the man for the job.
They had a date today, right. And here Sherlock was, completely naked and embarrassed. He finally managed to scoop up his dressing gown, trembling a bit as he put it back on and tied it closed.
"No one," the brunet answered with a shrug. "I deduced it. You learn quite a bit when you have so long to watch the people down here. You're all so silly. That's a much kinder word for stupid, isn't it? Not that it matters to me what you think."
With the announcement, everyone seemed to rush around to get a mat. Sherlock didn't realize what the big deal was until he spotted some of the students. All women, all rushing to get as close to John as possible. Ah, so that was why they'd all moved so quickly. Sherlock scoffed and grabbed a mat, settling himself a good distance away from the rest of the students so he could concentrate rather than hearing the constant giggles of the women pretending they couldn't do something just to have John's hands on them.
"Since you were born, John Watson, I have not demanded one thing of you. And now, the first simple request I make of you, you refuse me? Now I ask of you, John, is that any way to treat your mother?" she asked.
He hadn't realized how much this was hurting his lover, so he decided to ended it then and there. Grabbing his mobile, he dialed Mary's number and put her on speaker.
"Sherlock, I'm home," John called out when he returned from yet another date. But when Sherlock didn't greet him from his usual spot on the sofa, John furrowed his brow and began to glance around. Then he noticed it. There was a trail of rose petals leading from the front door to the bedroom. And on the table in front of the sofa, there was a single rose with a note.
"Fine," John sighed, turning around. "But I'll be seeing you in the Seventh Magpie tomorrow, and I won't be buying you a pint."
"We'll be taking anchor shortly, to gather supplies. Might be best if we were to let you off," Wiggins informed the pair. "You'll be closer to the Wall."
Sherlock eyed his hand before finally shaking it. "Fine. The stars called me Sherlock. I was an evening star."
"Oh....thank you, miss," Sherlock replied, though something felt off. He left his bad leg hanging outside the tub, not wanting the splint to get wet as he relaxed. "Much better."
John was absolutely stunned. What was a man doing down here? And more importantly, where was his star? He looked around, ignoring the other completely as he searched for the star.
"Only half mortal, according to my father," John replied. "Everything I ever thought I knew about myself, who I was, or what I am has turned out to be a lie. Or sort of. You have no idea how astonishingly liberating that feels."
As they shook hands, thunder sounded in the distance. Clearly not a good sign, especially when one is in the clouds.
"Oh, Richie. I cannot hear your impotent curses, but I can imagine them. Now, what's this in your pocket?" he hummed, rifling through the corpse's pockets and pulling out the rune stones with a smirk. "Ah, thank you for the rune stones, brother dear. They will help me find your killer. Now, best foot forward, and all."
How could this be? He'd seen Sherlock not long ago. He'd been fine. But then he heard the cause of death: drug overdose. Sherlock had killed himself when he'd heard John was in jail. That must be it. It was all his fault. John sank to the crowd in grief, though he didn't seem so much sad as he did angry. He was furious. furious at himself, at the world, at the drugs that had taken his husband's life. Then he knew what he had to do. He didn't want to live in a world where he was a widower. So he did it. Strung up in his jail cell, they found him. Death by asphyxiation was the technical term. But he'd hanged himself. Now he could join his husband in whatever afterlife there was and they could be happy together for eternity.
Most of John's classes were filled with women in typical yoga attire: yoga pants, tank tops, trainers. Some with bras, others without. And while John did find some of them attractive, he didn't engage in any sort of relationship other than what was required for him to do his job. That was one strict rule he had. He never had any sort of relationship with his students other than as a teacher and his student.
"Come on, Faithless, Hopeless," Janine sighed as she climbed into the driver's seat. "Walk on. Diggory's Dyke is just around the bend."
"There. Perfect for my guest. Now for our trap...." she thought aloud, then turned to the goats. "Right then. You shall become an innkeeper. And you, a pot maid," she decided, casting her spell on each one of the goats and smiling as they became human. "As for your inn..." She turned to the cart and flicked her wrist, but nothing happened. "Oh, I must be getting old! Inanimate objects were always so much harder to change. Their souls are so much older and stupider and harder to persuade." As she continued trying, she finally managed to turn the cart into a proper inn. "There. That's better." She was soon breathless from the effort of it though. "I must be getting old," she sighed.
"What do you know, Fatcroft? I'm fine," Sherlock argued, even as he laid there in the bed looking gaunt and nearly lifeless. Even now, he turned up the morphine he was hooked up to so he could get more of a high.
"They have said the Lilim were dead for ages, but they have always lied. The squirrel has not yet found the acorn that will grow into the oak that will be cut to form the cradle of the child that will grow to slay
"Good, good," Irene answered, heading towards the door. "Just give us a shout when you want to hop out and I'll give you a hand."
"No, I've said my goodbyes to them all. Including both my mothers. So, shall we walk together?" John suggested, offering his hand.
"Yes. Which goes to prove that you are indeed a ninny, a lackwit, and a......a clodpoll. And perhaps I am too," Sherlock sighed.
"And what do you propose to do with me? Hello?" Sherlock demanded, climbing into the caravan. Once again, his protests fell on deaf ears.
Mycroft shook his head. "As far as we can tell, he didn't know about your plan. And believe me, we checked everything. He is really dead. We used everything available, but he was already gone. I'm sorry, Sherlock. John Watson is dead. He's to be buried this afternoon."
"It's a bird," John realized as they got closer. "It must be trapped or something. Oh....it's got a silver chain on its ankle, and it's caught in the branches. Keep still, bird. I'll free you."
Sherlock did just that, feeling a calmness and an almost tired feeling taking over his body. He yawned softly and stretched a bit before finally letting his brain turn on once more.
Secretly, Sherlock was relived to learn this. Before long, John returned, panting and out of breath.
The pair snuck forward, not wanting to draw the attention of the two beasts causing such noise in the forest. Clearly something was wrong and John was determined to find out what it was. As they grew closer, he saw a beautiful white horse to his left and a massive golden lion to his right. Between them was an ornate crown made of gold, studded with red and blue stones. For some reason, the animals were fighting over it and clearly had been for quite some time. As both stopped to catch their breath, panting heavily, John caught sight of a long, ivory horn spiraling out from the horse's head.
"Wait, wait, the other stars? But that means....." John started, eyes growing wide. "You're the star? But how?"
"I can smell it on the wind. The Star is travelling West, right to me!" she laughed chillingly. This was just too perfect. All she'd really have to do is wait.
Greg shook his head. "Can't be. John's just a kid. Squirt of a thing," he argued. "Whoever you are, you can't come through. No one comes through from the Lands Beyond."
The unicorn snorted a bit as though offended and John couldn't help but think about the derisive man he was dragging along. As the animal whinnied, Sherlock approached slowly.
"Mycroft, he's absolutely perfect," Sherlock swanned over the man, sighing as he laid back in his bed. "He's got these eyes that are just...... And his hair is....... And is smile is just," he sighed, seemingly unable to find the right words. Mycroft had never seen his brother like this, so head over heels. And for a common man.
Sherlock was strung out on a hospital bed after his last high. Mycroft hated seeing his brother like this, knowing the drugs would eventually kill him. But of course, they were both just as stubborn as their parents, if not more. And Sherlock was refusing to budge.
"And you've turned into a mop-haired, raggle-taggle gypsy!" Harry teased. "We're going to the Seventh Magpie. There's someone who needs to see you."
"Good evening, Mary. Lovely to see you again, as always," John greeted with a smile. He tried to engage her in some sort of conversation, but to no avail. And when his competition appeared, he ended up feeling his temper raise.
"I've got some hay for the unicorn. Do they eat hay?" John called as he returned to the oak tree where he'd left Sherlock and the great beast. He was eating an apple, though it was hardly the only thing he'd had to eat. Feeling much better, he'd missed the hoofbeats disappearing into the distance. Sherlock the Star along with the unicorn they'd saved were gone.
"And I'm telling you it's a sprain. You can rest as soon as we reach the next town," John huffed back at him. "Why'd you fall anyway? Trip over something?"
"Listen then, John Watson. There is a man who looks identical to me, but much more savage and thinner than I. He is called Jim. If you ever see him, run and hide. Should you oppose him, he will not hesitate to kill you. Or perhaps, to use you as his instrument to kill me and claim the throne," Richard warned.
Sarah soon was bringing a mug of burnt ale to John as he groomed the horses. He fussed gently as one in particular gave him trouble, but accepted the ale easily.
"How now, dearie?" Irene greeted as she approached the star. "What a pretty face to find at the Market Fair. Stop a while under the trees and talk."
"Your shoulders are broad and perfectly fitted to your body. Your eyes and face are breathtaking," John whispered against Sherlock's shoulder. He then continued, moving to Sherlock's chest. "Your pecs look like you've worked out every day of your life and yet they're still so soft and welcoming. Your nipples......fuck, they're gorgeous. I've never gotten to see them before, but just look at them. Like perfect kisses on your body. And your belly is perfectly curved right there."
Sherlock sighed as he saw the headlines. John was seen all over town on "dates" with someone from his clinic: Nurse Mary Morstan. Blonde, just a bit shorter than John, average health, no pets, cat lover, bakes her own bread. They made a cute couple for the pictures and John did his best to appear in love with her. They met each other's eyes and smiled, kissed, fed each other, the usual couple things. And it made Sherlock wonder. Was he being a bad boyfriend? What was it one did when they were in a relationship? He needed to know. So he decided to research. Every time John was on a date, he studied the photographs in the papers, did online searches, talked to people online, did everything possible to get the data he needed. After months of watching John with this woman, he was ready to be the perfect boyfriend.
Between classes, he would visit the pool at the health club and sometimes stop by a few other classes they offered. After all, he got a free membership as one of the benefits of working at the health club, so he may as well take advantage of it. Of course, sometimes he did get looks from the other people around as he walked through the building wearing spandex and a tank top, showing off his muscular form and sporting more than a bit of a bulge in his trousers. But he didn't mind, taking it all in stride as he greeted those he passed.
"Don't you know what stars are?" Sherlock chuckled. "We're all like this. We look like humans, you could say. But we're a bit different as well. I'm sure you've heard the legends."
"Any particular reason why?" the sandy haired man asked, raising a brow. His voice lacked any malice, knowing Sherlock's hatred was well founded.
Irene accepted the offered mixture of spices, spreading it over her hare before taking a bite. "Perfectly palatable," she commented, licking her lips. "I can taste the thyme and basil, but there's another more unusual taste that I can't quite seem to place."
John's eyes widened. "You? You're Sherlock Holmes?" he questioned. "Sorry, it's just....I never expected you to look like this. Not that it's bad, I just.....sorry."
Once he'd made note of the regime he had in mind, John managed to get a bit of sleep for the night. But he was far too eager for his private session the next day. When morning did come, it barely even felt like he needed the caffeine he usually craved. He went through his morning routine though and headed for the health club, ready for his usual classes. There was one difference though. Sherlock wasn't in class. Probably for the best, since the group sessions seemed to agitate him far more than help him. So John went through the class as usual, ignoring the flirting from his students and just going through the poses.
Sherlock smiled, removing the chain from around his neck. "Here, I gladly give it," he answered, handing it over.
She was just a head shorter than John with beautiful blonde hair framing her rounded features. The stunning girl had caught John's eye, as well as the attention of every eligible bachelor in town. But John never gave up in his advances, even when she blatantly chose another man. One evening on his way home from work, he stopped by her house yet again.
Soon a sailor let out a call for their landmark. "Well, you'd best be gathering your things," he told them with a smile. "Get ready to disembark, and with our blessing."
Janine's eyes grew wide as the spell was cast, fearing this great woman. "W-who are you?" she stammered.
"Sir?" the young woman asked gently, shaking his shoulder a bit. "Why, don't tell me you've finished already!"
"Now, let's pick you up before someone steps on you. It isn't the biggest of caravans. But I shall keep to the letter of my oath, for you shall not be harmed," Janine commented, bringing him to the caravan. "Here, have a little drawer, lined with thistledown for the flower. And a cage with food and water. Lodge and boarding, as promised."
With a nod from Mycroft, the doctor left and the elder Holmes sighed a bit. He knew his brother needed help and he wasn't going to get it by himself. he wouldn't even admit there was a problem.
They continued to argue until his parents finally got so frustrated that they left the room entirely. Sherlock looked to Mycroft.
Having lost his captive Star and feeling sorry for himself, John rested under a copper beech tree. He was awoken by the sound of a carriage and hoofbeats approaching and sat up with a small groan.
"Sherlock?" John's voice suddenly cut through his focus. The detective's head spun quickly towards John in shock and he blushed deeply.
"I recognize other things here too. For instance, those knives on the table top. There are tattered scrolls in the vaults of Stormhold in which they are named. They are from the first age of the world," he revealed. Not long after, John came running in with the unicorn right outside.
The bird, who'd been returned to the perch by the caravan, fluttered and chirped as it saw the flower.
Mycroft sighed. "Well, there is a way to get around this.......But it would mean breaking John out of prison to come and see you and complete the plan."
"Oh, um," he murmured, then calmed himself. It wouldn't do to jerk Sherlock out of the meditation. "All right, let's come back," he hummed soothingly. "Deep breaths, as far as you can take them. Wiggle your toes and fingers a bit. Let the feeling flow back into them," he instructed. "Good. Now, roll onto your right side and just lie there for a bit while your body wakes up. Let the feeling slowly return to your whole body, every last muscle. Now while you take another deep breath, I want you to sit up slowly and gently. Let your head be the last thing that comes back into place and then open your eyes."
Sherlock blushed deeply, nearly collapsing once more. But then he heard another voice from across the room.
"Stop," he commanded the beast with a sigh. "I cannot continue to ride like this. I'm soaked and tired, and surely you are as well. There's an Inn just up ahead. You rest here and I'll stay the night there."
"It is a reasonable plan," James commented from his vantage point nearby. "And once he's killed her, he can go on to claim the power of Stormhold."
Richard furrowed his brow, picking up the bottle that had been left on the table. "What's this bottle?"
"Well nothing gets past you!" Irene chuckled. "These are very old indeed, and made of obsidian. Let me show you--"
"There's a rare amount of lightning in this cloud coming up. We're hunting for lightning bolts," Wiggins answered as thunder sounded once more. The ship creaked around them as it worked to get closer. Wiggins continued shouting orders to his crew and a flash was seen, captured by a sailor.
"Thank you," John replied, eagerly climbing up and taking his seat before the carriage took off once more down the road.
"There was no wind, no storm. This branch simply fell, terrified the horses. Could you help me move it?" the man asked.
"I do. But I gave you my word, John. And I will keep my word. He knows this. If you want me, then I'm yours," Mary told him.
The woman soon realized that the forms she'd seen after the passing of James the Elder were not living brothers after all. They were the ghosts of the princes these three had killed in order to claim the throne. Screaming at the realization, she ran from the room and as far from the inn as she could.
Sherlock shook his head and smiled. "No, not until tomorrow if the storm is gone," he assured. This certainly seemed interesting to him.
"Well....I'm afraid I've rather made a mess of things," John admitted with a sigh, running his hand through his hair as he tried to figure out their next step.
"Thank you, madam," Sherlock commented, allowing the man to help him inside and take the unicorn to the stables where it would be dry and well fed.
"The Lion and the Unicorn were fighting for the crown. The Lion beat the Unicorn all about the town...." John murmured, recalling an old nursery rhyme. It seemed they all came true past the Wall.
As he watched the woman, picking up on her habits, Jim tried to devise a plan to kill her. He considered poison through food, but noted the woman seemed to only eat what she had trapped. She was far too careful. He'd thought about leaving a steaming, fresh baked apple pie with deadly baneberries, but soon dismissed it as impractical. After all, he had no oven. But he did have a container of lucifers and a flask of brandy. Perhaps there was something to be done after all....
"I have had to live each day with the possibility that I had sent you to your death," Mary continued. "And I did not play you fair, since I thought your quest was just foolishness. Ask me why I would not kiss you that night, John Watson."
"Obviously faking. Ignore her. What were you saying?" Sherlock replied, dismissing the woman entirely.
So this was initially going to be a chapter about the private session entirely, but it turned out like this. the rest of the private session will be in the next chapter.
With that, Jim left his twin's corpse to rot in the mountains, off to claim his rightful place as Lord of Stormhold. John and Sherlock disappeared into the night, the candle taking them somewhere new to rest.
"Sir, could you give me a ride through the forest? I'm afraid I've lost my way," John admitted once they'd finished.
"You're a good lad. I'll send out some burnt ale for you later," Richard assured as they pulled up outside.
Just as he was about to dismount, the door to the Inn opened and a beautiful woman appeared. "Hello there, dearie. Oh, you poor thing. You must feel absolutely dreadful. Come inside. There's a fire blazing in the hearth and enough hot water for a bath that will surely make you feel better," she hummed.
"I will not have you disrespecting my husband and our decision. Now go,'' suddenly came Mrs. Holmes's firm voice. She was clearly not to be trifled with and so he left.
"There, young lady, young lad. Martha Hudson will see to your leg and your hand," Wiggins told them. "We eat at six bells. You shall sit at my table and tell me your stories, if you feel at liberty to do so."
The unicorn let out a snide harrumph and stamped it's hoof. Clearly it wasn't thrilled by the idea either.
John read through very single article and even looked through the website that had popped up. It really was very interesting, if a bit dry. Everyone else seemed to view him as a hopeless druggie who liked tearing people apart by telling them upsetting details about their lives. But John couldn't quite fit that with the man he'd seen. But as he continued reading, it became clear. Sherlock Holmes was a recovering addict struggling with a brain he couldn't turn off. Sure, he was abrasive a good deal of the time. But with a mind that seemed to be running full speed constantly, who wouldn't be? He seemed to be fighting a war in his mind, a phrase John heard constantly in reference to his PTSD. Then and there, the doctor decided he was going to help Sherlock, no matter what it took.
"I did nothing. Nothing that I did not do eighteen years ago. I was bound to be your slave until the day that the moon lost her child, if it occurred in a week where two Mondays came together. And so it is coming to pass. My time with you is almost done," she replied calmly.
"Good work! That'll be double grog all around!" Wiggins shouted, receiving cheers from everyone in reply.
"The excitement's over for a bit," Martha chuckled, smiling at their company. "Let's get you below and see if we can't find you something to eat."
"Believe me, lovely maiden, this will provide an evening you will never forget," he hummed. "It is a fine stiffener. Take it, as a gift."
Sherlock's eyes grew wide. "No, absolutely not. I'm not marrying him," he replied firmly. "I won't."
"Well if it doe not suit you, you may leave. There is no silver chain that will be holding you to the throne of Stormhold," Emma assured. "Now, what do you say?"
"Excuse me, can you hang back a moment?" John suggested as the class ended, tapping Sherlock's shoulder. "I noticed you seemed a bit frustrated with the other students. And it seemed to impact your ability to effectively complete the positions. So why don't we try some one on one sessions? I could drop by in the mornings or afternoons and we could have as many sessions as you like. But I think that would be more effective for you than a group session like this, don't you?"
"Just trust me," John insisted, waiting patiently until Sherlock finally gave in. "That's what I thought. Now the corpse pose is one of total relaxation, so it can be pretty hard for some people. Especially someone as wound up as you are. So take your time and try not to get frustrated. First, just lie flat on your back, keep your legs straight, and your arms at your side. Keep your hands about six inches away from your body with your palms facing up. You can relax your feet too. Let them fall open."
"No. You may travel by palanquin and elephant and all that if you wish. But Sherlock and I will make our own way and travel at our own speed. Right, Sherlock? Sherlock?" John called, realizing the star had vanished.
"You wanted me to exercise. Yoga is exercise!" Sherlock defended. "I don't care what it takes. You have to make sure I'm in his class as soon as possible."
"We have to do something," Sherlock insisted. The usually cold star was rather passionate when it came to something like this. "The unicorn is hurt. The lion will kill it!"
As dawn broke over the land of Faerie, John was finally able to see where they'd ended up. Well, sort of. It almost looked like they were surrounded by fog, but Sherlock knew better.
The second Sherlock heard, he couldn't help but become embarrassed. Blushing and losing his concentration, he toppled over onto the floor, taking John with him. As the pair began to giggle over it all, several women rushed to help John and coddle him to make sure he was okay.
John was absolutely horrified by this revelation. How could he not have thought about this? Everything beyond the Wall was so amazing and unusual and magical, while everything in the village was so...ordinary.
Thunder boomed around them once more and a flash of light could be seen in the distance. The crew jumped into action, the captain barking commands as his sailors ran around the deck.
"Experimenting? With what? It looked like you were standing there naked. Admiring yourself?" the doctor teased with a little smile.
Yes, I know that in Yvaine and Tristan don't actually travel back to the Inn, but it was easier to make the transition this way so I wrote in an extra stop.
Sherlock was thoroughly upset by this point. In the mountains, it was raining heavily and he was soaked to the bone. He'd been riding for what felt like ages and was growing tired and irritable.
"Mary must be here, asking for me. I'm off to see her," John decided, then bit his lip. "Look. Well. It's probably best if you stay here. I wouldn't want to confuse her or anything."
Sherlock paused, ducking his head back into the room. "The name is Sherlock Holmes. And the address is 221B Baker Street," he answered, throwing in a wink before heading out to Mycroft's car as usual.
Sherlock was disrupted from his memories by one hot tear rolling down his cheek. Firmly, he reminded himself of Mycroft's words and wiped it away, placing the photograph back in the bag and pulling the jumpers over it. He still needed to find his beaker.
Sherlock got down on his knee and John realized what was happening. "Sherlock! You can't blow me here. As much as I want it, this is a public place." Sherlock couldn't help himself from laughing.
"We do." John lifted Sherlock up out of his chair and gently kissed his lips. "Look Sherlock, we get married in 6 months. It seems like a long time, but it really isn't."
Sherlock went back to looking through the catalogue of suits. They had enough money to afford tuxedoes if they wanted them, but they didn't. Sherlock wasn't really sure what they wanted, actually, but tuxes seemed a little over the top.
"Can I please finish?" Sherlock had a genuine smile, one he only reserved for John, plastered onto his pale face. John nodded. "John Watson, I love you more than I ever thought I could love someone. Will you marry me?" with that he opened the box to reveal a beautiful silver band with "Oh god yes" engraved on it.
Greg stood up, and patted John on the back. "Hi, I'm Greg. I honestly can't tell you how honoured I am to be making this speech, and especially for my buddy John. I first met John at a crime scene a few years back, and I'm not going to lie, I wasn't a huge fan. I thought John was like Sherlock, another crime junkie, but I was wrong, he's honestly one of my best mates and to know that he's found love is all I could hope he had. I already knew Sherlock for a while, and eventually he started to grow on me. I couldn't get rid of him." The crowd laughed a little, and John chuckled. "Essentially, I wish you both all the best, both of you deserve the best, and I believe both of you found the best too." Everyone clapped as Greg lifted his glass, and the guests followed suite. A bell dinged and Sherlock grabbed John and kissed him. Tradition.
"Damn light pollution." John shook his fist at the sky and pulled Sherlock closer, "You know what, Sherlock?"
I finally found time and motivation to write the new chapter. Sorry it took so long. For most of August, I was in England and then when I got back, I had to move. I hope you all like it!
"Sherlock I can't believe it, we're actually married." John brought his hand up to his new husband's cheek.
"I haven't the slightest clue." Sherlock muttered to himself as he began drying. He strained his ears and heard John moving something. Furniture. The chairs. He listened even harder and heard the click of the door, he was locking it.
"Do that person." John was nodded his head in the direction of an elderly lady sitting alone on a park bench. Sherlock sighed and rolled his eyes, but was glad to show off.
"Thanks, love, while you do that, I'll get ready." On his way out of the kitchen, John closed the doors so Sherlock couldn't see what he was doing.
“Well, three reasons. One, I saw her walking into the building with you and Stamford.” He gestured to the windows. “Two, I heard four voices downstairs and if she hadn’t been there, there would have only been three. And three, you have suffered some amount of abuse coming from your… father, yes. And chances are if you were an only child you wouldn’t have tolerated it from him, but since you didn’t want her to get hurt you took the abuse from your father.” John’s eyes were even wider now.
"I know, it's so... it's so amazing. And all we really had to do was sign some papers, why did we have to go thro-" John cut him off by pulling him closer and kissing him, showing all the things he couldn't even think of to say.
John was awaiting the arrival of his boyfriend, Sherlock Holmes. They had agreed to a quiet night in, but John had a different plan. They would still stay in, but there would be no take away or Doctor Who, just romance. Every time a cab turned onto their short road, he felt like an excited puppy. Sherlock was coming home. His Sherlock, the man he loved more than life itself.
"Yeah, I never really get the chance to just look at the stars. Oh! Sherlock look!" John pointed to the sky where a few faint specks of light were visible.
"What?" His almost comic look of confusion made John laugh a little harder. Sherlock looked serious though, so John pulled him down slightly.
Basically, I went to my first ever Pride Parade and I got inspired to write what John and Sherlock must've experienced. Also, sorry if I forgot any of the letters in the acronym, I tried to find the longest one I could to include everyone, but it's always changing. If I missed any, let me know.
"Lovely, just come to the counter when you're done, and I'll sort it out for you." With a smile, he was gone and John waited for Sherlock to get back into his own clothes.
They sat looking into the other's eyes. It was obvious on both of their faces, they were finally married.
“I think we’re all done here. If you don’t mind, I’m going to take you two somewhere you’ll be safe ok?” John must’ve looked uncertain because Mike immediately elaborated. “You’ll have new clothes, good food and a warm bed.” John needed no more convincing. At home, he never had warm food, or new clothes, and he needed a good sleep. He got up and dragged Harry with him, following Mike Stamford.
"Molly, this man is cheating on his wife. You'll notice his clothes have been worn for two days, at least, and he looks tired. Had he gone home, he would be wearing fresh clothes." She scrunched up her face to see every little detail he did.
Before he knew it, it was time for Sherlock to walk down the aisle. He watched as Mycroft, and then Molly walked towards the alter, and then he followed. The music they had chosen was soft, but powerful, and he walked in perfect time with it. On his way he glanced at the chairs. They were white with little lilac ribbons tied onto them. Mrs Hudson was crying. There stood John. Beautiful in his suit, smiling at Sherlock and just barely bouncing on his heels. He was as nervous as Sherlock. After what felt like an eternity, Sherlock finally reached the alter.
"Oh, ok," She looked a little put off. "Let me know if you two need anything." With that, she left and John returned to the changing booth.
"Alright then. I'll explain what you're agreeing to," He looked a little put off by Mycroft. "No doubt, you both already know what's on here, but I have to tell you. By signing this you are legally bound, and officially recognized as family. For example, if one of you is hospitalized, the other has the right to visit under the name of a family member. You two made your vows, but we both know they are just to profess your own love in public, but if one of you is caught in an act of infidelity, the other has the right to demand a divorce..." At this point everyone was practically zoning out, but luckily he was almost done. "So, you two need to sign here and here, and that's all there is to it." He indicated the respective lines.
"Well, I believe we're all needed for pictures." Mycroft got up too, and left the new married couple together in the shade of the quaint gazebo.
John and Sherlock were sitting in the park, eating dinner. John had suggested they go out for dinner, as they hadn't had a case in a while, so Sherlock suggested a picnic. John was more than happy to go, so they stopped at Angelo's to pick some food up and they took it to the park. The sun had set, but there was still enough light to see by, and the two lovers had brought blankets. After they ate their food, they sat basking in each other's presence, digesting and enjoying the peace.
"Sit love, I want to hear all about your case." John sat down opposite the pulled out chair. Sherlock took off his coat and sat across from the blonde man.
He paused and looked up at the siblings again. “Ok, now correct me if I’m wrong. Your mother died five years ago?” John nodded. “Alright, and both of you were living with your father?” John nodded again. “Alright, can each of you, in turn, tell me about him?” They both nodded. “John, once you’re the oldest, you can start.”
"Of course, it was ama- How was the essay?" John completely forgot about it, he had set it down a few minutes ago, deciding it was hopeless to try and actually read it.
He pulled out a glass snowdrop from his pocket and showed it to her. After a beat, she gasped and rushed back to him.
"Joooooohn!!!!! I can't get it! Is this right?" the woman crooned, drawing both John and Sherlock's attention. "Is my breathing okay?"
Next were his hips, sharp and bony. Hardly attractive, he thought. John's hands seemed to rest there a lot, but that may have just been because they stuck out so much that someone could rest a drink on them. He could barely look at them before he felt uncomfortable, so he moved on to his legs. They were long and, unlike most of his body, seemed to have gained muscle from chasing after criminals all day. They were fairly toned, but still just as pale as the rest of his body. There were lighter hairs there too, though somewhat darker than those on his chest. Enough to show, but he wasn't particularly fond of it.
"Sorry, mate. Not a chance," Greg answered. He'd been guarding the Wall for ages and he never let anyone pass.
John knew exactly what he wanted to do during their private session and headed reluctantly back to his usual class schedule for the rest of the day. He'd never been more eager to get off work and hurried out as soon as his last class had left, getting a cab to Baker Street. Upon arrival, he glanced out and took note of the building. Great location, central London. It couldn't be cheap. But the money wasn't why John was here.
John spoke softly and Sherlock, surprisingly, found that it was working. His feet practically felt like they were asleep at this point. He kept his eyes closed and focused on listening to John's voice as he went through the guided meditation. It seemed to be working wonders and he didn't want it to stop.
"Yes, I'm right...The Star is coming this way," she murmured. Departing from her cart, she sharpened her knives in preparation. One was a small cleaver, specifically designed for cutting through the rib cage. The other was a more dagger-like blade, designed for cutting out the heart.
"Heads it is then. I'll partake of the rump then, nothing but dull meat to nibble," she hummed, splitting it between the two of them. "Apologies, dear, I don't have any salt. But try this. I think you'll find it more than adequate. It's my own recipe, you know. A little thyme, a bit of basil..."
It was a long road ahead of the pair once they'd left the ship, but much closer than they'd been before. John ate berries and nuts they found along the way, drinking from whatever clear streams he could find. Whenever possible, they stopped at small farms and John worked in exchange for food and a small space in the barn to rest. Thanks to Sherlock's sharp tongue and quick mind, they also managed to escape a Goblin Press Gang, and John faced off against one of the Great Tawny Eagles as they headed through the forest. Otherwise, they would've been food for the Eagle's young. Finally, they reached the road that led through the Dyke and back to the Wall. But as they walked, something bright caught Sherlock's eye.
It seemed John continued to stumble over himself through their conversation, but Sherlock seemed to find it endearing rather than annoying. As the night went on, the pair became inseparable. They talked together, danced together, drank together, laughed together. It was incredible. They ended up exchanging phone numbers before Sherlock's parents saw John's friends and chased them and John out of the party.
"Piss off," the star replied, then laughed. "The other stars don't know what to do when I can tell them everything about everyone. Many of them don't care about humans anymore. But they're more interesting to watch and deduce."
"The horses are reluctant to take this mountain path. But it is here that I will find what I seek," Richard muttered.
"Let's see how everyone's doing with your tree pose," John decided, demonstrating as usual so everyone remembered how it was done. Once everyone began to move, he walked through the rows to see how they were doing. "Good, good. Remember to breathe, everyone. Keep that right foot on your thigh."
"Oh, please don't. Get up," she insisted, and he did. "Look at you. You've become a man. And your hand. What happened?"
After a moment, they both burst into giggles at the absurdity of it all. John managed to drop his yoga mat while Sherlock sat back in his chair so he wouldn't fall over.
John chuckled, rubbing a hand over the back of his neck. "Yeah, I am. Sorry," he murmured. "I just......Well, I saw you in the park earlier today and I just......I wanted to tell you I think you're gorgeous. What were you staring at?"
Sorry, I needed a bit of a break. Life happens, unfortunately. But here's the rest of the private session!
"Wrong parent," Emma chuckled once more. "You are the last of the line of Stormhold, on your mother's side. Go on. Put it about your neck."
"So, you thought you would warm yourself at the burning of my cottage," she hummed. Jim would've had a smartarse comment if he could've moved his jaw to speak. "You should be ashamed of yourself! Attempting arson and murder on a poor old woman living alone."
Using the candle he'd been given, John tried his best to find a safe place for himself and the Star to rest. First was too windy, then a sandy desert. Finally they ended up back where Irene had created her Inn, though it appeared to be gone now. In its place was a battered goat cart on its side and two bodies: that of the goat and that of Lord Richard. Both were surrounded by blood and another man stood over them, examining the bodies with a curious interest. He looked much like the young man who now lay dead near the mountains.
"I'll send the pot-maid. Sarah?" she called. "A burnt ale to the lad in the stable, and be quick about it."
As the flames swallowed the little hut, Jim stepped back with a smirk, satisfied with his work. But as he walked back, he felt a sharp pain prick his heel and hissed, grabbing his heel and looking at the ground. Sure enough, a little snake had bitten him and now slithered back behind a nearby boulder.
"All right, just join in when you're comfortable. It's nothing major. Just a calming chant. We'll be in the lotus pose, as best you can manage," John explained, getting into position. "Close your eyes and just chant with me. Ommmmm......" he began. Within moments, he heard Sherlock's baritone voice join in and he couldn't help losing his concentration. For a moment it was just Sherlock chanting, John's mind blanking temporarily as there was more than a slight stir in his pants. But before long, he joined back in and tried to act as though nothing had happened. This would certainly be an interesting session.
With some persuasion, Mycroft agreed and Sherlock was in the class by the next morning. Neither he nor John expected what would come next.
Irene's goat-drawn chariot was moving quickly towards the mountains, though they slowed as the sun began to set. She stopped at the base of the mountains, a predatory smile spread across her lips. If looks could kill, this one certainly would as it was enough to freeze anyone in their tracks. Taking a deep breath, she sighed with pleasure.
"Look, just ahead there. Is that a light?" John noticed. "And look, a sign.....'The Chariot'. It's an inn!"
"Good. Now this pose emphasizes the hips especially. Now everyone up. Let's move into the downward dog," he continued, watching the poses shift. And as he looked around, John got a wonderful view of Sherlock's arse. Damn those tight trousers, as well as his own. Neither left much to the imagination, if anything. And John managed to find a reason to move back to Sherlock.
"Well, ask me for it and I'll give it to you. I'll be glad to be done with this thing," Sherlock scoffed.
All right, move past it. Something else. Maybe something else is better. So he moved his attention from his shoulders down to his chest. Light curls littered across his chest, barely covering a thing. Hardly sexy, in his mind. John's were a bit darker and there were more of them, actually covering his chest. And then there were Sherlock's nipples, dark pink with a hint of a light brown mixed in there. They were practically minuscule, barely there. John's were gorgeous, especially when he was embarrassed. He blushed all the way down to his chest and his nipples were so plump and easy to tease. So sensitive. Sherlock's.....well, he wasn't even sure he could call them nipples, as tiny as they seemed to be.
Making their way through the woods, Sherlock continued to grumble about his leg. John was growing weary, both from travel and from listening to Sherlock complain.
Over time, John realized he had a love for yoga. While it initially seemed so simple, he quickly discovered how difficult it could be. Anyone could stand on one leg, right? Wrong. It took time and patience to learn even the most basic poses, especially with his injuries and temper. But he learned one step at a time. And even when he'd managed to complete what the physical therapist and his doctors recommended, he decided to continue as a form of therapy and relaxation. He went to school and studied, becoming a certified yoga instructor. Now he had his own little studio in a health club and was doing fairly well. He was happy and relaxed and managed to earn some money doing something he enjoyed.
"Oh!" Sherlock gasped in surprise, blushing slightly. "It's you. I got up early to watch the sunrise and see my siblings to bed. I suppose it's not until now that I've felt like singing."
John looked it over, eyes widening a bit. "It looks like a topaz," he commented. "They're quite valuable."
Lightening flashed and thunder crashed in the distance as Irene's anger swelled, glaring at the witch before her. "Oh, there is plenty I can do to harm you," she snarled. "For you have stolen knowledge you did not earn. But not to worry. It shall not profit you. For you shall be unable to see the star, unable to perceive it, unable to touch it, to find it, to kill it!"
"Get inside. My treasure is riding this way. We simply have to ensure that he will come inside. You are Billy, the owner of this tavern. I shall be your wife. And this dull-eyed girl is Sarah, the pot-maid. Come now," she insisted, ushering them inside.
Before she could say more, Janine's voice rang through the air, screaming for her servant. The woman straightened and gave him a sad smile. "I must go," she whispered. "Look after that boy. But cross into his world at your own peril."
"Oh, Sherlock didn't tell me he was interested in yoga. Well I'm sure it will do him some good. Better than shooting my walls," the woman chuckled, shaking his hand. "I'm Mrs. Hudson, his landlady. Let me bring you up," she told him, leading the way upstairs to 221B. As soon as she opened the door, she began fretting. "Oh, Sherlock, it's such a mess! And you have company. You couldn't have cleaned up?"
Finally, he forced himself to look at his groin. A dark bush of curls formed there, covering the base of his penis. It looked grotesque to him, wrinkled and full of dark veins. The head stuck out like, well, a sort thumb really. It was thinner than John's, but longer. He preferred his lover's. It was darker, shorter, and thicker, surrounded by a bush of gorgeous blond curls. There was nothing ugly about it. It was perfect. Sherlock's.....well, it was far from, he thought.
Sorry if anything is off about this. I know the movie is different, but I haven't seen it recently enough to put it into the story. I'm working off of a script I found online, so hopefully it's all right!
James, Richard, and Jim all traveled quickly to find the star, ending up at the same inn for the night. Jim, knowing his elder brother had hired a woman for the night, slipped her a small vial containing a simple mixture before she entered his room.
Jim had gone far in his travels, reaching Diggory's Dyke after some time. But he'd hardly expected to find a small hut along the road to the Wall. Who could possibly want to make a home here? Well, Jim was going to find out, examining the hut through his spyglass with his belly to the grass.
"Sir, I'm one of the best suitors for your son, if you'll excuse my saying so. And he isn't getting any younger. Please, let me marry him. I'll take him off of your hands and show you he can be a proper young man instead of a wild man," claimed Victor Trevor.
Lighting his pipe, the captain continued, "You know, it wasn't entirely fortune that we found you. Well, it was fortune that we found you. But I was keeping half an eye out for you. I and a few others about the place."
John had never offered to do private sessions before, even when he had students who had difficulty with some of the poses. He simply offered to meet them in the studio shortly before the class and he'd help them, or he would help them during class. But something was different about this man and John decided to find out what. So when he got home, he decided to search the name.
"There's no need to belabor your point, old woman," John scoffed. "I didn't steal your bird. It was caught on a branch and I freed it."
"Because I've never had sex. Certainly you, of all people, know what a virgin is," Sherlock scoffed.
"Richard! They tried to poison me!" John announced, causing Richard to jump to his feet and reach for his belt. But the prince found nothing.
"What? No, no, that can't be right. It must have been someone else. Someone who looked like him. Maybe he had a body double. You told him, right?" Sherlock insisted.
"No, you shouldn't have," Sherlock argued. "I live, as long as I am in Faerie. Were I to travel to your world, I would be but a cold iron stone, pitted and pocked and fallen from the heavens."
Attached to a similar chain some ways away was a beautiful bird with brightly colored feathers. A former princess lured from her home as a child and enslaved by the witch known as Madame Janine, she was confined to her bird form now and without speech. She'd earned this punishment nearly twenty years ago when she gave away expensive merchandise just to sleep with a cute buyer. But the witch didn't know her slave had given birth to a young boy and snuck him back to his father one night, behind the safety of the Wall.
"Yes. If you go through, then you will be, as I understand it, transformed into what you would be in that world: a cold, dead thing, skyfallen," she explained.
Sherlock smiled, happily obliging. As they kissed, they were completely unaware of what happened back at Janine's stall. The woman's chain dissolved completely and she was free.
"Thank you. And I'll stable and groom the horses. They'll catch a dreadful cold otherwise," John added.
"Your problems are no concern of mine. Never again shall I be called a slattern, or slave, or anything that is not my name. I am Lady Emma Watson, firstborn and only daughter of the Eighty-First Lord of Stormhold. The spell you have bound me with is over and done. Now apologize to me and pay me for my services. For these things have their rules."
"You just spent hours in the corpse pose," the doctor told him. "I've rarely ever spent such a long time with someone in any pose, much less that one."
Soon, an older woman with colored blonde hair appeared in a lavender dress, a medical kit at her side. "I'm coming, I'm coming. Keep your beard on," she fussed, approaching the two guests.
"I know who seeks you and why she needs you. Also I know the provenance of the topaz stone you wear upon a silver chain. It is the stone they call the power of Stormhold."
Unbeknownst to John, he was far from the only person who wanted the star. Quite far from it, actually. As he attempted to make the long journey home so he could present his gift to Mary, numerous others had begun their search for the very star he dragged along with him. Three princes, as well as three witches, all desired the star for themselves. For you see, the star had something to offer each of them. For the witches, the star's heart was a delicacy. If consumed when the star was truly happy, it could give them incredible youth and beauty. But the star's heart was of little concern to the princes. What they desired was around the star's neck: the yellow topaz necklace their father had cast out of the castle. The first prince to find it and wear it around his own neck would become the new king of Stormhold. The princes had already killed off several of their other brothers, leaving only the three of them now.
"I uh. I learnt how to..." John gave up, it was time to tell the truth. "Sherlock. I love you." The taller man got down from his chair and crossed the room. In turn, John got up. They were now centimetres away from the other's face.
John walked out from behind the curtain wearing his normal clothes, which included jeans and a jumper.
Sherlock picked up a pen and signed. John noticed his hand was a little shaky, so he gently squeezed his thigh. When Sherlock was done, John signed. And the preacher was right, that was all there was to it.
"It's just that..." He never finished his sentence because Sherlock leant a little further and kissed him. John immediately froze because, what if people saw? But then Sherlock pulled away and the moment was over. John glanced up to see slight hurt in his boyfriend's eyes, and with a jolt, realized he hadn't kissed back. He also realized that no one really cared who he kissed because it was the 21st century. Sherlock kept walking, leaving John to hurry after his now quickened pace.

“I’m sure Mrs Hudson is ordering beds for you and your sister this very moment, but I’m sure for now you would be able to sleep on the sofa.” John’s eyes widened a little.
There was a man with slightly greying hair. Clearly a detective, his fiancée was obviously cheating on him. In his late thirties, not a threat.
“Fourteen.” His voice broke slightly with the unuse. She sighed and glanced at the man. “Could you wait here for a moment?” Sherlock nodded, and the they walked out of earshot.
“Alright, here we are.” Mile stepped out of the car. John and Harry followed. They got what little belongings they had brought with them and walked up to the door.
“So you don’t deny it?” Mr. Holmes took a step closer to his son who, in turn, fought back the urge to step back. The next word growled by the older man took Sherlock completely by surprise. “Out.”
“Hey, sorry to bother you kid, but we’re checking to make sure no one is sleeping outside tonight.” Sherlock looked around himself and realized that the occupants of the other benches were either gone, or in the process of leaving. The woman had a slightly nasally voice.
"John. I am refreshed, I have a totally new perspective on the world." Sherlock took his phone and threw it, but luckily John caught it.
"I said to work quietly, soldier." John spoke in his most captain voice he could do. Sherlock sharply averted his gaze and concentration back to the envelopes.
“I hate to be rude since you were here first, but where am I supposed to sleep?” Sherlock, in turn looked around himself at his room. He realized that there was only his bed, which hosted specimens for his experiments, and the couch which was covered in blankets to sleep on.
John Watson sat in a small drafty office. Harry was there too, but he felt alone. Everything was hurting and he hadn’t slept restfully in a while. They sat in the silence, neither of them wanting to break it. Until the door opened and a man walked in. He appeared to be starting to put on a bit of weight, and he kept pushing his rectangular glasses up his face. He took a seat opposite them and started typing on the computer. The tapping of the keys was the only sound in the room, and then he cleared his throat.
Sherlock couldn’t restrain his curiosity and glanced in the direction of the two officers. She looked agitated, worried maybe. He clearly held authority over her and was trying to calm her down. It worked and they came back to the bench.
When John lost his train of thought and rejoined the rest of the world, the radio had been shut off, and Mike and Harry were now happily conversing.
The first one was specifically for homosexuals. There were rainbows everywhere. People danced, and blew bubbles. Some people just walked with signs that said things like "Even if being gay was a choice... so what? People choose to be assholes and they can get married." Sherlock could feel John relaxing a little and he even laughed at a sign that had a picture of Jesus saying "Guys I said I hate figs".
Standing in front of the door to Molly’s flat.  “Oh God, not again,” he whispered.  He knocked.  She opened it.  Loose satin robe, barely tied shut.  He could see...he quickly glanced up and away.  Molly softly slipped back down the hall.  He cautiously followed her, the door clicking shut behind him.
Sherlock stared.  There was a wall ten feet high and at least 15 feet feet long with neolithic paintings of animals and people.  But there were also block symbols arranged in neat rows which covered most of the wall.  “What...” he started, “...are these hieroglyphs?”
At noon, the workers packed up and headed back to the cafeteria.  Molly went with them, and Sherlock followed along silently. After lunch, a somewhat disappointing affair of sandwiches, Sherlock lingered at the cafeteria, promising Molly that he would follow her shortly.  She departed with her crew, seeming to be relieved that he wouldn’t be tagging along with her like a little puppy dog.
John shifted uncomfortably in his seat.  “We each have our assignment.  Greg tells us what he wants us to be concentrating on, and we go from there.  He and Richard review everything that we work on and pass it along to the benefactor.”
Sherlock rubbed his hand on John’s back, letting it slide lower and lower.  “Look, we all know what the ground rules are, and other than that, we are free to enjoy each other however we might like to try.  At the very least, you’ll want to try something, we’ll do it, and it just doesn’t work.  Remember that time I jumped into the shower with you?  There’s absolutely no judging.”
“Is there something you found you don’t really want to tell Greg?”  She leaned down, brushing her breasts across his chest but slowed her movement to almost a standstill.  “It’s ok. You can tell me,” she whispered in his ear.
Mary looked over at Sherlock, who watched raptly.  “He’s so good at this,” Mary said.  “Look at how well he sucks it.  He can take it all without any problem.”  Sherlock’s cock was hard watching John suck Mary’s dildo.  He was lifting his hips unconsciously with each down thrust of John’s head.  “I bet you wish he was doing this to you.”
Mary leaned down and kissed Sherlock on the lips before turning to John.  “It’s time for my fun.  Get on your back.”
A huge astronomical clock appeared behind her, orbs representing the movement of celestial bodies rotated around it.  “Things are moving faster than you think.  Time is not your friend.”
“’All the world’s a stage, And all the men and women, meerely players...”  A muffled voice called out one of the figures.  “And as such, we have arrived at the climax of the action.  You have solved one mystery, the minor of the two, the superficial one if you will.  You took drastic steps to ensure your survival...as though it was ever in doubt. And now, now, we reach the very pinnacle of the story.  Shall we continue on then, each in our roles?  Hero.  Villain.  Lover.  Cad. Which ever part we've each been cast as, we must continue and see this out.”  He paused.  “Do you not wish to know who the benefactor is?”    He threw back his hood revealing a dark, metal plated helmet designed to look like a bird...a vulture.  The eyes glowed green.  “You’ve been very concerned about it.”
“I’ll get you back for this,” John growled at Sherlock as he slowly started to slip his clothes off.
Sherlock scoffed.  “Please.  Everybody knows that you are always part of the stake since you refuse to get involved in these wagers.”
He kept turning and looking.  He felt like he was being stalked.  They had warned him about leopards and how dangerous it was to go off alone.  There is a long warbling sound.  He looked up.  Vultures circled overhead.
"But you are under prior obligation, are you not? You have something that does not belong to you, which you must deliver to its rightful owner."
Sherlock waited by the food and ale stall, staring through the gap in the wall where John had disappeared and never returned. Along came a lovely blonde woman who spotted him and his longing.
When he reached his newest student, John had to admit he was impressed. Sherlock was perfectly balanced, standing tall with his left foot planted firmly on the ground and his right foot pressed against his inner thigh.
A party. That was perfect. John's friends were sure a party would perk him right up. And it was at the Holmes manor, so it would be even more fun. After all, the Holmes and Watson families had a notorious feud, so sneaking into the Holmes party would be an extra slap in the face to the Holmes family.
"No, no," John insisted, shaking his head. "I'll stay up here with you. Two sets of eyes and two pairs of hands may just be the saving grace of us."
"There. Now the terms of my servitude are fulfilled, and you and I are finished with each other," she replied firmly.
"Ouch!" Sherlock yelped as John moved too fast and tugged at the chain. "Wait for me! This stupid chain's not that long!"
"Of course Jim would do something like this," Richard commented. Over the years, he'd grown more accustomed to his brother's murderous tendencies and they hardly shocked him now. "Where is he?"
"Please. With this ankle? I'll hardly be running anywhere anytime soon," the star insisted, holding the other end of the rope as John left.
"All right, ladies. Now let's try the gate pose," the blond instructed as he walked between rows of yoga mats and students. Glancing around as everyone changed position, he occasionally stopped by one or another to correct their position.
John felt a stirring in his pants and nodded, letting himself be half-stripped as they went to bed. kicking off his shoes and socks, he toppled them over so he could be on top only to have Sherlock flip them back over.
"Ahoy, hello!" came a voice from above. It was that of the captain, Bill Wiggins. "Parties in need of assistance?"
"Would I be correct in presuming that you cannot see or hear me?" he called forward. Sure enough, he received no response.
"Look at you! You took the last of the youth we had saved and you've squandered it!" Sally complained.
John stopped dead in his tracks and turned to the other, brow furrowed. "Who told you that?" he asked.
"Ah, yes. They have to get up pretty early in the morning to pull one over on me," Janine chuckled. "I do believe that flower he gave me is worth even more than the one that stupid girl lost me all those years ago."
"Because now that you have saved my life, you are, by the law of my people, responsible for me. And I for you," the curly haired star explained, clearly put out. "Where you go, so must I."
John cursed himself for being so stupid as to believe that the kidnapped star would stay where he'd left them. "He promised.......He was right. I'm an idiot. A numskull. I let the Fallen Star escape! My one shot at getting Mary! And now I'm lost and alone in the land of the Faerie!"
"Now do you believe me?" John murmured as he caught his breath. "I love every last piece of you. You're beautiful to me, all over. And I love you, William Sherlock Scott Holmes."
"Brothers," Jim stated aloud, though he couldn't see them. "Your spirits surround me now, surely. I know I must avenge this sad carcass, for the honour of our blood and all of Stormhold. But then I shall assume the title I now legally inherit. And you will all still be dead."
"Of course I do!" John insisted, his face heating up a bit. "I just meant.....well, I didn't know if it was true. I mean.....you could have a girlfriend or--"
Inside the inn, Richard warmed himself by the fire as his own wine was uncorked and warmed. As he enjoyed his drink, Sherlock approached and took a seat opposite him.
"Curious..." the man commented. Unknown to John, this was Lord Jim, twin brother to Lord Richard. "Ah, Richard. Your throat expertly cut," he observed.
"John.....I'm not exactly well versed in human interaction. But....this would appear to be flirting, would it not?" Sherlock commented, raising a brow. "If so, I'd like to reciprocate. But I'm not certain how to go about it."
"I'm afraid not. Until I see my brother's corpse on the ground, I shall drink only my own wine and eat food I have prepared myself. So if I might trouble you to place this bottle of wine by the fire to take the chill from it?" Richard asked, handing her a bottle. "Now, I have a companion who is attending to the horses and has sworn no such oath. If you could send him some burnt ale to take the chill from his bones. I'll pay."
"My heart? I've been reliably informed I don't have one," Sherlock answered simply. Irene just laughed.
There was a pause before John continued. "Mary. I am responsible for all that I've done, not you. And you did not promise me your hand if I returned with the star."
