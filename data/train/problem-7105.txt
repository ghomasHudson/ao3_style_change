“What’s all this?” He asked as he gestured to the large basket on the ground. “I thought we could have a picnic...after all it is our 19th bonding anniversary” Tony said with a smile. Steve froze at his tiny omega’s words though as he had completely forgotten it was their anniversary. He was never good in keeping track of these things. Tony seemed to sense this and immediately reassured the large hydra that it was alright. “But I didn’t get you anything or even-“ Steve was cut off as Tony pressed a finger on his chin. “You don’t have to do anything Sweety...you’ve already given me so much that I don’t know how i could ever show how thankful i am to you...” Tony said with a warm smile as he tried to pull his alpha down to his level. Steve thankfully obliged as bent down to Tony’s level. Blue eyes staring at brown ones before Tony pressed his lips onto his. The alpha moaning into the kiss as he felt his wife’s tiny hands palm his face. Their kiss lasted for a long time until Tony finally broke away for air. Panting hard as he stared lovingly at his husband. “Happy anniversary Stevie..” he whispered with a mischievous glint in his eyes.
The brunette scowled as he rolled onto his back, not caring to glance at the closed bathroom door. Dark clouds already in his mind as he straighten his shirt again. Steve had emerged six minutes later with an apologetic look on his face as he went near the brunette who turned his back on him instantly. “listen Tony...i gotta go for a bit...I won’t be long, be home at nine I promise!” Steve said as he placed a kiss against Tony’s cheeks. The brunette didn’t steer as he simply stared outside the window from his bedroom wall. He didn’t mind to care as he heard Steve walking across the house a few times before going down the stairs and closing the door.
A possessive and dominating hiss escaped the alpha’s lips as he heard the confused omega struggling to speak in between cries of pleasure.
Wade didn’t miss the way the older man’s grip had tighten on Tony’s waist for a few seconds. “You can thank me later…”Steve grinned as he tried to sound casual infront of the two teens.
Even when Bucky ( Steve’s former Omega) was found and rescued by Steve himself, Tony had given him his full support. Even going as far as to forgive the winter soldier when they had found out that he had killed the genius’s parents. Understanding that the ex-assassin was brainwashed and had no control over his actions.
The three remaining girls instantly looked at one another as they giggled at the little scene before them. They would never admit it to the blond cheerleader captain. But they actually thought the two earlier looked absolutely cute together. Their giggles turned into laughter as well after thinking how Sharon would be so pissed once she’d get out of the restroom.
A laugh escaped the redheads lips at that. making Steve scowl even more as he cross his arms in front of his chest. looking absolutely insulted. “Alright...alright...well if you don’t want Tony i could always give him to someone else...as long as Bucky still gets to see his little brother, there’s no problem really...i could call Sam-“ “hey Tony...hi..er..you wanna come sit near me?..” Steve instantly cooed at the little demon who stiffened instantly as Steve began calling him. Tail twitching nervously behind as he stared at the bulky human. Steve leaned in a little more as he stretched his arms towards the incubus, Natasha smirking by his side as he did. When Steve had noticed that Tony still didn’t have a collar on him, he instantly smiled as he cooed at the little incubus more. “You want me to get you a collar? We could buy one on the way home...i could buy you some new toys if you like...” instantly the small demon’s tail straighten at the words. Head tilting a bit to the side as he was considering the human’s words.
Try to walk away and I stumble
Bruce nodded at that. There was no hating on a person who had finally found their destined match. Even if that person was a prick. people only tended to date for the sake of not feeling alone until they finally found their match. It wasn’t uncommon for the one’s who haven’t found their soulmates yet to feel a little hurt once the other had left them.
“Holy...cow...”
So much for him trying to show Steve that he could be his Alpha..that plan had went out the window when he had realized that Steve probably didn’t need an alpha, especially one like Tony. The thought had never made Tony feel more insecure in all his life as he’d stare at the beautiful omega and wonder if he was still good enough for him.
Peter was busy saying his thanks to the blond as well, not really noticing how Steve was looking hungerly at his brother. Wade had waited for an appropriate moment to interupted them. Feeling a little out of place at the moment. “Ugh yeah…so Pete, i should be heading out now since it’s getting late…you know curfew and all…” he lied as he tried to step a few feet away from Peter when he realized that his hand had been reaching out to Peter’s again. Peter in return frowned at the action and unconciously got nearer to him. Which Tony noticed right away.
Tony giggled as he drank a second serving of the punch that probably had some alcohol in it. “Shit...i think that punch isn’t good for ya...” Bucky frowned as he realized Tony was a bit tipsy. The brunette had never drank alcohol before so it was no surprise if he was already flushed out and giggling from only two cups. Bucky had been drinking a canned bear so he didn’t get to taste the punch Tony was drinking. “Come on doll...better get you somewhere you can rest..” Bucky suggested as he felt Tony start to lean on him more, slender arms sluggishly wrap around his neck as he decided to carry the tiny teen bridal style.
Help, right..he was helping Tony. God he shouldn’t be thinking too much about the blond. he was probably only fooling himself into thinking that Steve was actually staring at him. or even enjoying those kisses they shared. God he was pathetic. He should really kick himself now. He didn’t even know if Bucky would actually want him, let alone Steve. who right now had a few of the cheerleaders shouting at him with big smiles on their faces. They also looked to be flirting with Bucky but Tony’s eyes stayed on the blond cheerleader who kept coming near Steve whenever she had the chance,a frown appeared on his face at that. Why did he feel this strange feeling when she was around Steve? He didn’t even feel anything when a girl had suddenly ran up to Bucky and hugged him..wait...Oh God, how could he do this to Bucky? he was already a cheater! And he wasn’t even dating any of them. Oh he was horrible..horrible..how could he be learning all those lessons to be a good boyfriend to Bucky when he was already falling inlove with Steve. He didn’t deserve them, He really didn’t.
steve went completely still at the shorter teen’s words. Tony could tell he had successfully struck a nerve at the way his brother’s face morphed into that of hurt before going completely unreadable. Tony was about to say more when Steve had suddenly pulled him out the door more harshly, making the shorter teen yelp as Steve dragged him across the street where a car was parked. Steve quickly opened the unlock door of the car as Tony tried desperately to get away, until his eyes widen in shock once he saw who was inside the car.
Thor, hummed happily as he stretched a muscular arm behind slender shoulders, Playing with a few dark locks as he stared outside of his white and gold carriage. He was a prince from the kingdom of Asgard, Ruled by his wise and honorable father, King Odin. He had just heard of his friend's victorious battle against the Ruthless King Howard, even taking the mad King's only son Prince Anthony after the war was over. It came as no surprise to anyone that the only one who could have defeated the Mad king of Stark was another Mad one..and King Steven was indeed Mad when it came to the Stark Prince.
But tomorrow he’d finally be able to see Steve again. he couldn’t wait to wrap his arms around Steve’s thin frame again. He always loved how he could easily clutch and wrap around the omega whenever he felt nervous or anxious. Holding onto Steve always made him feel better. Sometimes he couldn’t believe his luck that a sassy and feisty omega like Steve could ever want to be with a short, squishy and insecure alpha like him. Really Steve could do so much better, but he was happy Steve stayed with him. Seeing Steve show off to the world that he was Tony’s omega was enough to send the alpha sky high with pride. The only thing he hated though was when other alpha’s were making fun of him and Steve as hot tempered as always would always get most of the beating as he’d always run to the alpha’s aid, giving the other alpha’s a quick punch and give a few good kicks before getting punch right back Which always made Tony feel like a complete worthless fool as he’d desperately try and shield his omega only to be thrown off and also get kicked. The omega would always try and tell him that it was okay even when the both of them needed to go to the nurses office. But Tony never really let it go. What good of an alpha was he if he couldn’t even protect himself and his omega. Especially when he’d see some alpha’s eyeing Steve.
It could potentially completely revamp Stark Industries as he knew it.
And every single night, as Steve carried Tony's limp, skinny body from Peter's room to their bed, he begged the universe to help him. To give him the strength that he needed to keep going, just long enough for his husband to decide to come back to him. While Steve had never really subscribed to the same Catholic teachings that his ma had held so dear, he had absolutely no doubt that if there was any such thing as purgatory, he was currently living through it.
“Easy...i just give you some tips and pointers on what he likes..and what you should do to get his attention.” Tony beamed at that. “Okay...well what do you think we should do first?” Tony asked as he came closer, feeling more comfortable with the blond now that he was sure Steve really was helping him. “Well first...we get these glasses off..” Steve said seriously as he took the objects off of Tony’s face. Making the shorter teen whine as he couldn’t really see very well without them. Tony all of a sudden felt very vulnerable as Steve had taken away his sight..the sudden silence also bothered him since for some reason Steve wasn’t saying anything. “Ugh...is everything alright?...” Tony asked as he tried to look at Steve, not really seeing the blond clearly. Another minute had pass before the blond had finally said something. “Ugh yeah...so i ugh just wanted to see how you look without your glasses again...and um..yeah you better wear them..” Steve explained as he handed Tony his glasses again. The brunette furrowed his brows at that, “..yeah i know...i look really awful..” the blond was quick to snap his head at that giving Tony a scary look as he did. “No..it’s not that...it’s just that..ugh...I just remembered Bucky likes people who wear glasses..” Steve quickly stated as he turned around, not showing his face to Tony who was smiling at the information. “Really?” He asked as he tried to move in front of Steve, who quickly shifted his gaze away from the shorter teen. “Yeah, yeah...so you’re good...tell you what how about we meet up every afternoon after school and i can teach you all the ways to get into Bucky’s heart..” Tony was practically radiating with joy at the other’s offer. “And on Saturdays as well...it would be better if we did this right..it’s hard if we only get so little time together-i mean with the teaching...afternoons are too short and i have to be home by eight so..” Tony was just nodding away, not really caring anymore because all he could think about was Him finally have the chance to be with Bucky. And all thanks to Steve, he really didn’t expect the blond to be so nice in helping him get to Bucky. Even if Steve was doing this mostly for his best friend, Tony was grateful for the blond’s offer. Who would of known that the scary looking Steve Rogers was really a nice, sweet and caring guy.
Steve sniffed at his pillow as he lay on their bed. Tony had finally emerged from the bathroom. Freshly clean and had rubbed off all his arousing scent from earlier, Replacing it with a fresh lavender soapy smell instead. Tony sigh as he saw the giant hybrid laying face down on their bed looking absolutely sad as he entered.
What? What did he say? Did he just say-
And just as he yanked pepper free from Tony’s  arms, he gripped his large hand around her tiny neck and felt her struggle before suddenly growing limp. “I’LL KNELL FOR YOU!” Tony screamed as he collapsed on Steve’s feet. Arms around Steve’s waist as he begged for him to let go of the red head. The sudden outburst was enough to loosen Steve’s grip on the woman and stare down at Tony at his feet. “I...I’ll kneel for you Steve...just..just please let her live..please..” Tony answered with a broken voice as he stared up at the king.
“Tony?” Steve called out as he couldn’t seem to track down the omega’s scent. “Tony?” Steve tried again as he started pacing around the front of the cottage. There was absolutely no sign of the omega. Did he go into the woods? No..he knew the forest surrounding their cottage was dangerous for an omega human to go out on his own. Steve had told him that, the large blond didn’t hesitate to go back into the woods anyway. Hoping and praying that his omega was alright.
Steve had always been so shy and tender whenever they were together. He had always known his place as he served the stark manor. always so diligent and careful. So imagine Tony’s shock when he saw Steve suddenly come into the Master bedroom. Looking dangerous and tense. Eyes turning red as they stared at the brunette wearing nothing but the lingerie his new alpha had gifted him. (As all omega’s were to wear them on their bounding night)
“WATCH OUT!”
But that was all he needed from the man.
Now the hybrid’s territorial side was showing again as he growled dangerously at the other hybrid who also wanted to come near the brunette. Tony sighted as he trued to wiggle his way out of his unhappy hybrid. “Okay Steve! Enough! Please!! Thor has an owner that he wants to get back too! There’s nothing to be upset about! I know you don’t like sharing but Thor really needs our help in tracking down his owner right now and we can’t do that if you wont be nice to him!” Tony snapped as he stared seriously at Steve. The sudden harshness of his voice surprising the hybrid. Tony rarely raised his voice at the blond and right now he was doing it making Steve go beat red at the embarrassment. With a defeated look Steve unwillingly let go of the brunette who was now thankful he could breath again. Turning right away to glanced up at the other blond hybrid who was staring at him. “Alright...now we are all going to get along here alright? I don’t want anyone hissing at anyone...” Tony trailed as he glanced at Steve who was pouting adorably at him. “Now i want you two to have a little hand shake and if possible get along” Tony smiled as he patted the two massive hybrids on the sides. Steve awkwardly took a step forward to bring his hand up as he honestly wanted to please Tony, Thor in turned smiled at that and grabbed his hand with a strong grip, pulling Steve towards him in a harsh way. the unexpected blond humbled as he landed on the other hybrids chest. A tight squeeze nearly suffocating him as Thor gave him a bear hug while laughing loudly before releasing him and turning to the retreating brunette. “Hey you know Thor buddy...it’s alrig-off!” Tony huffed as Thor also gave him a bear hug, Steve immediately jumping at the hybrid as he tried to free the gasping brunette.
Tony tried to hide his growl with a strangled groan. Unsure of how to reply with such an alluring voice. “Um…i..y-yeah i kinda did…” Tony confessed as he resisted the urge to growl again when Steve had hit his sweet spot. Ohhh how great it was to have an omega on the team. “You should have some of the donuts i bought…their freshly baked…i got those jelly filled ones you liked.” Steve mused as he gently traced his hands up and down the apha’s arms. Before running back to his shoulders.
An hour had passed and still no text from Steve. Tony had tried calling him but figured his phone had died since his line keep saying couldn’t be reached. At moments like these when the younger brother was all alone Tony couldn’t help but admit that he did feel a pang in his heart at the way the blond never liked to go near him whenever his friends were with him. At moments like these were he was laying by himself alone in Steve’s bed, he’d have this funny feeling at the thought of Steve being with someone else. Which really shouldn’t bother him. Steve was his brother after all..and their kisses and sweet touches were just their way of showing affection towards each other. Granted he knew it wasn’t normal since none of his classmates that had siblings never kissed each other with their tongues. But he had gotten too use to Steve slip in a tongue every now and then, he had been so use to the older teen touching him, pressing onto him..making him feel like he was the most precious thing on earth to him. It didn’t start out like this at first. They had always been close even when their parents were still alive. Steve had even told their parents that he wanted to marry Tony when he grew up. Making the two adults laugh at his childish mind. Telling the young blond back then that he couldn’t marry Tony because he was his brother. That had made Steve very upset as he bursted into tears saying he wanted to be with Tony forever. Their mother Sarah had to explain to the small blond that he didn’t need to marry Tony to be with him forever because they were brothers. They would always be together no matter what. That had seemed to lighten the young blond’s mood right away as he smiled at their mother then at Tony.
a laughed escaped the other hybrid as a small piece of the lasagna fell on the brunette’s lap. Thor easily placing his hands there to pick the piece up and throw it in his mouth. Tony laughing and smiling Adorably as well at the disgusting action.
“Where’s Peter? I haven’t seen him all day?” Steve asked when he finally realized that one of his children was missing. “He’s with Wades again...you know those two can’t be separated..” Tony answered as he placed some mashed potatoes on the middle of the table. Steve gave a small frown at that which made the tiny omega chuckle. “Oh Steve...they’ll be fine...Wades a good boy...” Tony said as he gestured for his husband to sit. Steve obeyed but still had the frown on. “And a teenage Alpha..” he added. Tony gave him a look at that “ all the more reason why i feel Peter would be safe with him...” Tony defended. With a huff Steve shrugged in defeat, Tony was right..and he couldn’t control who his omega son hang out with. He just felt that he’d much preferred if Peter hang out with his siblings instead.
...Boy was he wrong....
Sorry this has not yet been checked for any errors…so i will apologize ahead of time.
Tony could only stare in awe as Clint and the rest of the gang shouted in surprise as they stood up to openly gawk at the transformed omega. No...no..no...this wasn’t Steve..Tony tried to convince himself, Steve was small, skinny and not at all a giant, towering over most of their friends. And then The omega had stared directly at him with the same sweet smile he always gave Tony when he sensed the alpha getting uncomfortable. Oh my God...this was Steven.
A loud moan escaped the omega’s lips as Steve continued to suckle on his bound gland. Lapping it as best as he could so that the wound would stop bleeding. Tony was his. And his alone. He would make sure of that as he tried to erase the earlier bound Tony had with the other alpha.
“I said….i think i just found my soulmate…” Steve whispered as he held him in place.
With a gulp, the blond human carefully placed his large hand at the center of the demons head. right between the horns. A smile appeared on Steve’s face when he realized Tony was instantly leaning towards his touch. And oh God..he was purring like a cat. “Wow...seems like he likes you...” Nat said with a smile as she continued to pet Bucky’s head as well. Steve couldn’t help but smirk at her as he carefully wrapped his arms around the startled demon. Placing him gently on his lap. Instantly the older demon leaned towards his little brother who was now with them. Steve couldn’t help but blush as he watched the older brunette start to lick his little brother’s mouth. Heart thumping loudly inside his chest as heard the smaller demon start to moan against him. Natasha couldn’t help but laugh as she saw her friends start to squeeze the demon tighter against his body.
The Kingdom was full and alive as the King’s people came to see the Stark prince finally now down to their King and be crowned Queen of the Hydra Kingdom.
Steve and Tony had been together now for over a year, everything had been going great as the entire team had finally settled in the Stark tower. For a well known playboy and selfish prick. Tony was actually a wonderful boyfriend and teammate, never losing his cool and always helping out in the best way that he could.
Steve whimpered when Tony stood up too fast. standing up quickly himself as he followed the brunette to the bathroom. But Tony turned around right away and told him he had some business to attend to. Steve frowned at that as he didn’t know what type of business Tony would be doing inside his bathroom. The brunette had a habit of doing that every time Steve tried to show him how he wanted him. He huffed out his chest as he smelled the faint smell coming off from the bathroom door again. He moaned as he banged his head on the wooden door. Rubbing himself up on the barrier as he tried to sniff the arousing scent that was coming off from the other side of the door. Mewling and groaning as he continued to Grind his hips on the door while he heard the shower go off from inside. “Tony..” he whimpered as he continued to bang his hands on the bathroom door.
“Okay...and remember if anything goes wrong..like you wake up in the middle of the night and I’m not there..I’m coming home..” Tony said seriously as he got his bag ready. Steve just rolled his eyes before smiling warmly at him. “Bye Tony..have a safe trip..” Steve said before giving Tony a soft lick on the cheek making the small man blush before coughing. “Okay...well see you on Thursday..Clint! Nat! Please take good care of him” Tony waved before being pushed inside the cab by Clint. “ go on Romeo...pepper’s gonna be pissed if you miss your flight again”
When the bus would finally stop and everyone was busy getting up, Steve would quickly steal a kiss from the brunette before getting up as well and following the crowd. “ STEVE! “ one of the blond’s friends would shout at him once they were on campus. “TONY!” Someone would shout at the brunette from his clique as well. The two would glance at each other with wide smiled before finally departing and going on their separate ways.
Tony had a daze look on his face as he stared at the senior who was walking outside the football field with his tall bulky blond friend. James ‘Bucky’ Barnes. The junior sighed as he fixed his glasses. Everyone in school had a thing for the two seniors walking by. But most of them were head over heals for the blond one who was more athletic, taller, bigger and more intimidating than the brunette. Bucky was a bit more laid back looking, wasn’t as big and massive as the other but still had some muscles to show off.. and he was the one that made Tony  blush whenever he saw him. The junior brunette had been having a small crush on the older brunette ever since the guy had helped him in the cafeteria two months ago. Tony had almost fell face flat on the floor if it wasn’t for the senior’s fast reflexes. Tony had been so stunned at seeing the senior give him a charming grin paired with his deep blue gaze. “Careful there doll..might hurt yourself..” Tony couldn’t even blink as he tried to form words as he felt his heart thump fast in his chest, but nothing would come out as his mind had been engulfed by deep blues. Only jolting out of the other’s arms when a rough voice had interrupted his thoughts. Bucky’s blond best friend was staring intently at him. Eyes narrowing a bit as Tony stood frozen with fright. The feeling earlier immediately replaced with something else as he scurried away.
“Where’s Tony? Wheres my bride?!” Killian demanded as he glanced around. “Has anyone seen Tony?” Maria asked worriedly, a few mumbles and whispers now filling the room. “I saw him earlier...he looked really sick..like he was really nervous” a guest said from the crowd. “ i did too...he looked a bit overwhelmed...he was about to poke last i saw him..” Pepper admitted with a frown.
After just a few seconds however the door clicked and Steve’s ears perked up instantly. jumping to his feet Steve ran and greeted the brunette who smiled tiredly at him. “Hey Steve..sorry I’m late..had to go over at Clint’s for a bit..” Tony said as he tiptoed to pet Steve’s head. The blond leaned down for him to make it easier, ears and tail up in a straight line. Happy to finally have his owner home safe. “It’s okay..i made lasagna..I’ll heat it up!” Steve offered as he tilted his head to Tony’s touch. “No don’t bother! I like it cold either way...too hungry to wait..” Steve nodded at that with a smile.
“Steve...this is Thor..” Tony smiled as he introduced Thor to Steve. “He’ll be staying with us for a while..” Tony said as the other hybrid jumped off the cough and walked steadily towards him, wrapping his massive arms around the brunette and pressing his face against him as he purred. Steve instantly tensed at the other hybrids action as he hissed venomously at him. The hybrid named Thor merely stared at him as he continued to press against the tiny brunette.
“Yeah?”
“You’re going to help me?!” Tony exclaimed with wide eyes. “Yeah..i know Bucky more than anyone...i can totally help you make him like you..” the blond said with a serious look. Tony could only gape in astonishment at what he had just heard.
———————————————————
“Alright then! So...thanks a lot for all your hard work guys..Thor, Sam, Loki...” Clint trailed as he looked pointedly at the three men. “I think it’s time you gave me and Tony a little privacy...” he quickly said as he gestured with his hands for them to leave, making Sam raise a brow as he stared in disbelief. “Hold up, hold up...what do you mean give you two privacy?”
The two teens shared a knowing smile as they both held on tight to each other while laughing at theirs who congratulated them.
And that was exactly what Steve was going to give him. By the end of the month Tony Stark was going to be his. And no red head secretary was going to get in his way.
It was already way past noon when the gates finally opened and the Blond King finally saw him, eyes widening in horror as he got off his horse and ran to catch the beaten Prince. “FUCKING TAKE HIM THEN! A THOUSAND LIVES ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN HIS!” Howard spat as he closed the Gates again. That would be the last thing Tony heard from his father.
The test only ran about an hour before Bruce told told them the result. “ well..i don’t think i need to tell you that Steve here is severely malnourished, his underdeveloped for his species age..lacking a lot of the traits his species need in order to grow..but that can be fixed though..all he really needs is a bit more iron in his body as well as zinc..” Bruce trailed as he looked up from his papers as he glanced at Tony. “ he also needs a lot of security..I don’t know what happened to him but it seems like life hasn’t been fair to him..” he sigh as he watched the blond hybrid play with a small ball Bruce had given him. “Is he yours now though? I mean what do you plan to do with him?” Bruce asked as he went back to look at the papers, Tony glanced at the blond before shrugging. “I really don’t know, i mean..when i found him last night something just pulled on my strings you know..i just couldn’t leave him there..I didn’t really plan anything? I just thought maybe I’d help him and find him a good home..” the brunette confessed as he watched the vet walk towards the blond hybrid.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Uncle Fury...w-we..i can ex-explain...” Steve stuttered as he pressed Tony against him even more, protecting his little brother the best way that he could. Body shaking a bit at the thought that their uncle had been inside the house the entire time they had been confessing their feelings for each other. “No need to explain anything Steve...I think I’ve hear everything i needed to...” Fury said as he held up his left hand. “Put Tony down Steve...I’m not gonna do anything..” the blond nodded at that as he finally set the younger sibling down.
“Tony...” Steve sniffed as he pulled away to stare at his younger brother who looked absolutely lost as he was. “What about Peggy?..” Tony asked while looking away. “What? What about Peggy?” Steve asked with a confused look. “I...i saw you kissing her that night when she carried you inside the house..” Tony confessed as he glanced up at the stun blond. “Y-you saw that?” Steve asked with wide eyes. The brunette could only nod as he tried not to remember the image inside his head. “D-did you hear what i said after that?” Steve inhaled as he suddenly stared down at Tony with lidded eyes. The brunette shook his head as he shivered when he felt Steve’s hot breath brush against his ear. “Well..if you had stayed longer..you would of heard me moan out your name..” Steve whispered as he gently stroked the brunette’s face with his fingers, mouth pressing against the other’s earlobe as he continued to tell the brunette of what had happened after he left. “ i was so drunk that the minute i thought i was finally back home I thought i was kissing you..” Steve trailed as he bit Tony’s ear, making the younger teen shiver. “Peggy had admitted she was thinking of someone else as well but she had been surprised to hear me moan out your name, thankfully she just smiled as she promised me she wouldn’t tell anyone as long as i helped her with her problem with Daniel..”
they still have the tentacles, just a bit smaller and not as much as a pure blooded hybrid. Also their bigger than normal humans yet smaller than pure bloods.
Next chapter will more than likely be posted tomorrow..i really do apologize for Letting you guys wait, its just life get hard and busy you know? but I’ll do my best to update my stories! Please comment your thoughts and if you guys are ok
“I’ll take care of you Tony...I’ll always take care of you...” he trailed before kissing the brunette passionately. Moaning as Tony deepened their kiss as he clung to him. Before long the two were clashing their tongues together, battling for dominance before Steve was able to push the other’s tongue back inside his mouth. Making the smaller sibling tremble as Steve bit and sucked his  pink appendage greedily. Hips bucking against his as the two started to pant and gasp at feeling each other’s bulges. “Mmm...Steve...s-stop...we shouldn’t...” Tony moaned as he let his head fall against his pillows, allowing Steve to suck on his neck. While strong hands started crawling underneath his shirt, pinching his nipples lightly as he did. They had always done this many times..but they had never took the next step, too afraid of what would happen if they did. Tony moaned as he arched his back at the blond’s touches. So good...it was so good...he wanted more, more of Steve...more of his brother.
———————————————————
This was going to be alot longer...but for some reason this part kept telling me to be on it's own.  Hence another short chapter...i apologize..but! The rest of this is haftway through which will probably be posted within the week! Give or take two days tops! And I'll be sure to post it right away! I hope you guy's are still interested...i promise this next chapter will be longer and more Tony and Steve!
That’s why people like Bruce settled to wait than date. It was honestly a whole lot easier than having to deal with losing a cuddle buddy. Granted there were perks to the whole pre-soulmate relationship thing. But Bruce didn’t want all the drama that came along with it. That’s why it really was better to just hang out with friends…unless those friends were named Steve and Tony. Then that would be a whole other story.
A simple “oh” was the only reply the other had given him before going all silent. Making the whole room feel a bit small and awkward for the two boys.
“Wha-“
Nat and Thor boomed with laughter and applause as Clint sang out loud to i will survive while standing on top of the bar table where they were seated at. Bruce chuckled when he had sat down next to Thor, smiling in thanks as his friend passed him a bottle of beer. Grabbing it right away as to not get hit by Clint’s wobbly legs.
“And you had an erection?”
“TONY! Please answer me...” Steve whispered with a trembling voice. heart aching at the thought of losing Tony.
The words seemed to hit Steve somewhere as his eyes clouded a bit at the answer before clearing up again. With a huff Steve nodded at him. “Yeah...yeah your right...your right...i-i have to go now..” Tony sat up when Steve had jumped off the bed in an instant. Storming off as fast as he could not giving Tony a chance to come near him. “Steve wait!” Tony shouted as he ran out of the room, seeing Steve rush pass their parents who were surprised to see the blond leave in such a hurry. “Sorry ma..Howard...something just came up! I have to go!” He said as he slammed the front door behind him. Tony wanted desperately to run and chase him but his mind told him to let Steve go. That this was all for the best.  With a choked out cry Tony went back to Steve’s room and slid against the door. Crying as he held the alpha’s dog tags in his hands.
Steve winced, crossing his arms across his front. "Yikes. Is he gonna make it?"
"I found
, that's what! And you think they won't dig up some old KGB dirt on Nat in order to nail her too? No. If they come for you, they're coming for me too, and that's just how it's gonna be!"
Or at least, the conflict that Peter hoped would follow. He couldn't imagine that the Avengers would just sit idly by and allow the registration act to become the law of the land, because to do so would go against everything that Papa had fought for during the war and everything the Avengers had stood for up till now.
Peter scowls.  “C’mon, Dad, don’t do that.  Don’t try and pretend that I’m still a three-year-old kid who doesn’t know what’s going on.”
"Oh hell no," replied Sam. "I mean, well, yeah, there are certain parts of your story that are pretty unique, I'll give you that. But the rest? Nah. I've heard it all before, man, at least a dozen times. Have you forgotten what I used to do before you dragged me into this whole Avenging gig?"
"Okay, so… hold on a second here," Tony said, holding up his hands. "You're telling me that Thanos… beat up
Quill actually looked embarrassed. "That's not—that's not really—"
"Let me be clear, Captain," T'Challa continued, as if he'd read Steve's mind. "My government is just as unclear as you are regarding what I believe you have been referring to as the 'phenomenon from space'."
Tony grinned, with Steve's grin matching his. "That's our boy," said Tony. "He's been making me proud since day one."
"Yes, sir."
"Oh, just that girl in your class who keeps thinking she's smarter than you," Tony answered without missing a beat. "'Cause we all know it's not possible. How's that Decathlon essay coming, by the way?"
Tony nodded, sniffing as he turned his head into Steve's chest. "Tell me again, honey, please? 'Cause I'm just—I think—I just really need to hear it, and—"
So... Peter’s matchmaking seems to be going okay so far! 😉
"Hey, Cap, Tony. Look, I'm really sorry to have to bother you guys on your vacation, but we kinda had a bit of a break-in here, and—"
“Copy that,” Clint and Natasha both say at the same time.
"Fine, fine, mother hen," Tony said, winking. "Go ahead and feed me."
"Papa, it's nothing—"
"Cap? Bucky? You guys okay?" Sam said as he landed a few metres away, his wings folding themselves back into his Falcon pack as he trotted towards them.
"I'll be okay," Peter said automatically, realising how stupid it sounded when Gwen gave him a
"Honey, please!" Tony pleaded, his hand on Steve's shoulder, the only unblemished spot on his body that he could seem to find. "Don't try to move too much, okay? Helen and Bruce are on their way."
he thought.
The crowd erupts again as Steve raises his hands to smile and wave.  The cheers are a bit less enthusiastic than they were for Schmidt, which Steve quickly dismisses.  With the games being held in the recently reunified country of Sokovia for the first time, it’s no wonder that the cheers for Germany and the other European countries are louder since they’re geographically closer.
"Do any of them live around here?" asked Peter.
"Oh," Peter squeaked, gripping the edge of the table so tightly that he heard the wood start to crack. "But… Liz's neighbourhood isn't even in the Midtown precinct, so why would your dad be involved?"
“Ha.  Hammer Industries,” Tony scoffed.  “Like they've ever developed anything that’s actually worked.”
"Oh, thank
"No!" Peter shrieked, causing Gwen's eyes to go wide. That was the absolute last thing Peter needed at the moment. "I mean, my dads, they're already on their way. I called them, and… yeah. They're on their way, but… um… is it okay if we go and wait for them on the steps or something, 'cause I'm still a bit—"
Tony opened one sleepy eye. "Takes one to know one, honey," he murmured as he twisted around in Steve's arms. His lips formed a full-on grin as he trailed his fingers across Steve's right nipple, pulling a choked gasp from Steve's throat. "Hmm. Seems like you've got a situation here,
"Yeah," said Auntie Nat. "And on that note, I'm heading back downstairs to dye my hair. See ya later, boys."
"But you gotta make up with Tony first," Bucky said, as if he'd read Steve's mind. "'Cause I'm serious, Steve, I don't think you were safe to be flying up there today. And if Meridia really is catching up to our tech then it's not gonna get any easier from here on out. Whenever the 'on out' happens to be."
"We don't know yet, Tony says the scientists are still studying the data," Steve said. "All we know is that this time it wasn't in Wakanda, it was in Namibia."
But in that moment, cuddled up next to his living, breathing husband, his strong arm heavy around Tony's waist and the sound of his heartbeat beneath his ear, Tony didn't really much care about the turmoil the rest of the country was in, because his was finally over.
The five stages of grief?
"Well, maybe I can ask my dads if we can all get together for dinner sometime," said Peter. "I'm sure they wouldn't mind."
"Okay, and I completely understand that," Scott insisted. "But I'm telling you that I've been inside the Quantum Realm twice now. And Hank's been in there, and so has Hank's wife. And she was stuck in there for thirty years before Hank found her again, so there has to be some way that we can figure out how to make this work."
Natasha and James. Two of his teammates that were still alive, even if 'alive' no longer quite meant what it used to.
Tony's heart gave a painful lurch at Steve's overt sincerity, as if he still couldn't believe it. "Babe, you don't ever have to thank me for loving you. It's involuntary now. Like breathing."
"C'mon, sweetie, let's get you home, hmm?" Stacy said as he helped Gwen into her coat. "Your mother's pretty worried."
Tony shook his head. "I don't—I don't know, Pete. I don't—"
"Yes, and he won't hesitate to rip Wakanda to shreds while he's searching for it," Bruce said, sighing heavily. "Your Highness, are you absolutely certain that there's no way the stone could be moved? Or—or destroyed?"
"Well,
"That is for my wife and daughter!" Drax yelled as Thanos ripped the webs from his face, launching them so hard at Gamora that they sent her flying. Dr Strange quickly conjured some kind of mystical sword, swinging it at Thanos' head as Quill swooped off to the side, catching Gamora just before she would've slammed into a big pile of rocks.
"Yes, sweetheart, I know that," Steve said evenly. Steve had never personally met the senator in question, but when both Tony and Nick Fury could agree on someone's level of assholery, as Tony liked to put it, then he supposed it had to be true.
And the whole time Steve's eyes never left Tony's face, as if he were afraid that if he looked away, Tony would disappear.
"But we don't," Tony cut in. "So just… do what you can, yeah?"
Steve's entire body was shaking, his chest screaming for air that was burning hot and ice cold at the same time as he tried to figure a way out of this waking nightmare. There were so many bits and pieces that just didn't add up, and now—
Tony instinctively shuddered, leaning down to kiss Steve's hand just as he jerked awake.
"Tony, Tony, Tony!" Steve whispered as Tony's movements slowly grew faster, unable to form any other words. Because there were no words, no way to describe how unbelievable Tony's body felt wrapped around him, closing around him like he wanted to keep him inside and never let go.
"That's true, but this would most likely be someone who would know what to do with the schematics," said Steve. "Someone with at least the know-how to build one of the suits."
Steve huffed as he paced back and forth, his thumbs hooked into his waistband. "Look, Sam, I'm really sorry that we called you up here, but—"
“The rifles are to be shipped in quantities of five thousand units per shipment, sir,” said JARVIS.
"Peter's fine, Tony," Steve said as he set down the water bottles. "I'm just… it's already 0300, and I was hoping you could come to bed for a while."
A massive knot rose in Peter's throat, guilt stabbing him like a knife. Dad was so certain that he was going to be okay, but—
"Whoa," Scott said, his eyes going wide. "You're gonna let me stay here? Like, in your house?"
He had always hated that look. Always hated how Tony felt like he had to carry the entire world on his shoulders, and how he always instantly blamed himself whenever anything went wrong.
All likely members of HYDRA.
Soo... seems like both Steve and Tony are pretty head-over-heels now 😍
"So," he continued once everyone was quiet. He reached into his pocket, activating the scrambler that Tony had given him. "Sam, why don't we start with what you and Bucky were able to find with Peter this afternoon."
——————————————————-
“I ugh...was...I’m not brave...” Tony managed to say as he felt like melting at the blond’s gaze. “I saw what you wrote, about Bucky...Were those true?..” oh God this was it. Steve was going to pulverize him. He probably thought it was disgusting how Tony had wrote all his feelings about his best friend. He was probably here trying to protect Bucky, and warn Tony not to ever go near them again. Tony held his breath before swallowing hard as he nodded at the other teen. Too scared to form words he closed his eyes. Waiting for a fist to collide with his face as he did. But nothing came though. Curiously he opened his left eye as he wondered what was going on. Steve was just staring at him a look, not like all the other looks he had given the brunette. It was different..softer..sad. A cough had brought Tony back as he realized Steve had started saying something. “-And if you’d like i...could help you out with that..”
Steve had on a wide smile as he started unloading the logs that he had gathered on his small cart from across the woods from his cottage. It was already mid day when he arrived Hot, sweaty and hungry. he had headed out before sunrise to find a good tree to cut down. After taking out the last of the logs from the cart Steve had realized Tony hadn’t come out to greet him yet like the human usually did since they had started living together in his cottage.
and this really seemed to trouble Tony. Because Steve was catching more and more eyes from alpha’s now everyday. Not that the omega actually entertained any of them. In fact the omega had already managed to send a few alpha’s to the hospital after shamefully flirting with him while the two were out on a date. This one alpha had even lost most of his front teeth when he had cut in on Steve and Tony talking on the hallway at school. The omega not liking when the alpha had been blocking Tony from him. Steve had immediately punch him in the face when he had tried to put his hands on him like he had a right to. Tony could only stare with wide eyes as the alpha fell on the floor with his mouth and nose bleeding, scrambling away when Steve had told him to back off while trying to reach for Tony who unconsciously flinched.
After dinner was done Tony asked Steve if they could talk in the living room for a bit. Steve cocked an eyebrow at Tony’s tone and nervous smell he had been carrying since he got home. The hybrid had already guessed something was Bothering the brunette.
On the middle of the highway Steve drove fast as he felt his heart bounce frantically inside his chest. He felt himself sweat as he glanced back every so often to look at the unconscious omega laying on the back seat. Hands and feet tied together as a small piece of clothe was wrapped around his mouth. He just couldn’t do it. He couldn’t leave Tony to marry with an alpha who he knew Tony didn’t love and didn’t love Tony in return as much as he did. Because damn it No one loved Tony more than Steve did.. he had always loved him, since the day they Were introduced to each other as brothers..he hated it that he couldn’t tell Tony how much he wanted to be the omega’s alpha. How much he wanted their pretend weddings to be a real one day. He had even started going out with other omega’s just to get his mind off of Tony but it was no use. Tony was the one for him. But Tony had made it clear that they would just be brothers, that he only thought of Steve as his brother. It had hurt the alpha so bad that he ended up taking a job offer at another state just so he could be away from the omega. And when he had finally thought he was over Tony, when he had finally started going out with someone..Tony had called him and told him that an alpha had asked for his hand in marriage. The whole thing literally messed him up as he tried desperately not to think about it. But he couldn’t take it.. he never could when it came to Tony.. before he knew it he was on a plane and headed back to their home where he saw the beautiful omega smiling warmly at him. That night when he had laid in bed with Tony again, all the feelings just came crashing down on him as he finally felt brave enough to show Tony how he really felt for him. The omega once more had made it clear that they couldn’t be together. Shattering Steve’s already broken heart again, making him think that he should really let go of Tony once and for all.
"How long until we get there again?" His beloved companion asked as he turned his head around to face him. Thor smiled at the beautiful man setting next to him. "Not long Loki my love...this evening perhaps, we shall arrive there..and the king will surely have a feast for us after our arrival"
“Well…i wish we could stay and party like you young kids here but me and Tony have to get a few things done…you know boring grown up work…” Steve explained as he rolled his eyes tiredly for emphasis . “Awwweeee, but i still wanted to drink and get wet at the pool with the kids!” Tony pouted as he batted his thick lashes at the CEO. “Come on, your too old to be still doing that…” Steve laughed as he ushered Tony towards the kitchens glass door. Tony scoffed at the blond “excause you! I am still in my early 20’s! Ugh…Hanging out with him has really made me boring….” Tony said dramatically as he waved goodbye to his younger brother and his friend. Laughing when Steve got offended and tried to tickle his side.
If you have the time please drop a little motivation for this 😃 I'd really appreciate it
While the other’s were busy shouting and throwing popcorn on the giant screen. Watching a Grade B action movie that Clint had suggested, Steve was busy twriling Tony’s hair. Much to the alpha’s approval, as it always felt extremely soothing when “someone played with his hair”. As the alpha had put it.
Tony chuckled when Bucky started giving pointers to Steve on becoming a father. The blond Alpha was suddenly very nervous at the thought that he might not be a good enough dad like the other Hydra was. Tony had to rest his head at Steve’s side as he reassured him that he’d be a great dad..just like how he was already a good mate to Tony. That had seem to do the trick as Steve immediately relaxed and gave Tony a warm smile before leaning in to whisper a thank you while wrapping his tentacles lovingly around him. The omega leaned even more as well, smiling as he felt the tentacles Tighten around him. he always loved it when Steve ravished him with them.
“Peggy...sorry to interrupt but could you two give us a ride home?” Steve asked as he began shoving Tony inside the backseat, not waiting for the other to reply. “Oh...sure, sure...no problem...Daniel darling..you know where Steve’s house is right?” Peggy asked as she turned to glance at Daniel who nodded with a smile at her. The blond quickly got in and held the brunette tightly against his chest, arms never letting go of Tony as the car drove off.
He felt his heart soar with excitement as the omega began to show more movement, glancing around the room a bit with squinting eyes. He looked absolutely beautiful. The commander couldn’t Wait go near him and claim him right there and then. He had been so happy when he had realized that the other Steve hadn’t marked the omega yet. What a fool. He wouldn’t make that mistake, he would bend the omega and make him his. The omega would probably try and resist him, but deep down he knew Tony wanted himself to be claimed by him. He could smell it whenever they were in battle, smell the want and confusion the omega always gave off as their eyes meet.
———————————————————
“Who wouldn’t be...waiting till ten for your ass to come home..didn’t even give me a heads up what time you’d be home..” Tony answered bitterly as he walked downstairs. Steve frowned at that as he followed the brunette. “Shoot...I’m sorry...my phone died...i-i’m an ass...i was just..i-“ Steve tried to explain before Tony cut him off “you were drunk...” the brunette said in a dull tone as he sat on the kitchen table and started munching on some bread. “Y-yeah...I didn’t even remember getting home..crap im sorry Tony...it’ll never happen again, I promise..” Steve said with a grimace as he leaned down next to Tony. The brunette raised an eyebrow at him. “You don’t remember anything after getting home?” Steve frowned at that as he bit his lips. “I remember Peggy helping me walk across the front yard...and kis-“ blue eyes widen for a moment before glancing at the other. “i mean i remember thanking Peggy...ugh...w-were you with us when we got into the living room? Everything was just so blurry and-“ Steve started to ramble but was cut off again as Tony right away answered him that he went upstairs right away. Too tired to actually care what was happening. That had seemed to ease the blond’s expression. ‘He doesn’t remember that i was there...it’s better’.
His head had started to get dizzy as he moaned into the kiss, hands clinging onto the older teen’s sides as the two of them continued to press against each other. When they had finally broke apart Tony was all flushed out as he panted against Bucky’s face, lidded brown eyes going wide at the realization that the bedroom door had actually been open.
“Oh…well..i can just leave this Pizza right here then and-“ She began as she gestured to the elevator. Not wanting to intrude on the two teammates.
Ever since then Tony would always have this funny feeling whenever He’d steal glances at the senior in campus. Like right now when he was watching the brunette practicing on the field with his teammates, a couple of girls and cheerleaders all clapping and cheering on his best friend Steve as they played. Shouting out his name while completely ignoring the other players. Tony couldn’t help but blush as he’d start writing on his notepad as he sat by the bleachers. Scribbling away ‘Bucky4Tony’ or Mr.Tony Barnes. He even had little drawings of the senior below the writings. Gosh was he a Loser. But it was the only way he could really express himself. Especially since he didn’t really know anyone in Hydra heights. If only Pepper and Rhodey were here with him. But they were back in Shield academy along with Bruce, Thor and Clint. And he was here all alone with just his pins and notepad as companions. Well..at least he had Bucky to look at. If only the big scary blond would stop looking at him whenever he glanced their way. It was like Bucky’s best friend was a body guard alway ready to glare at anyone who was looking at them. Well at least someone actually knew of his existence. Bucky might as well of forgotten him by now. A small whine escaped his lips at that.
WARNING I DID NOT EDIT THIS YET..please excuse anything you see Eye twitching...thank you
Steve winked as he smiled warmly at his brother. Tony could only gape at him in shock. Pressing his hand at the metal tag hanging around his neck. Before he could manage to say anything Steve had leaned down to press a kiss on his lips. Hazel brown eyes going wide as he felt the alpha slide his tongue inside his mouth. Taking advantage of the brunette’s surprised  as he Dove his tongue in and started exploring once more. “Mmm...Ste-steve...we can’t were brothers...remember?” Tony gasped as he tried to free himself from Steves delicious tongue. “Step-brothers Tony...please don’t forget that...” Steve breathed as he palmed the omega’s blushing face and pressed it closer to him. “Shit Tony...you know i only want you to be happy...” Steve whispered as he bit the omega’s bottom lip, making Tony whimper. “...but are you happy with him?” He finished when he let go of the now swollen lip. Leaving Tony panting a bit as he stared at him. Tony wanted this, wanted Steve so bad..he had always wanted Steve but it just couldn’t be..they were brothers..and he had told himself that time and time again. He wasn’t going to ruin everything between them. Steve would find himself another omega and He would marry Killian...that was it that’s what he had told himself these past few weeks..he wasn’t going to destroy what him and Steve had. And so with a heavy sigh he answered a yes. “Yes Steve i am happy with him...and you’d be happy with someone else too..”
the typical Alpha’s physical form started to show when they had turned 12 and yet Tony was still short and soft a year later. The boy had a very shy personality as well, often speaking in a very shy voice that no alpha should. Although Howard couldn’t blame him. If he was an Alpha lacking all physical traits he’d be embarrassed too. The problem was Tony would turn 18 someday and he’d  have to start presenting to an omega. And omega’s were usually the one’s to chose the alpha’s they liked. The only problem was even when Tony had first presented as an Alpha at the age of 10 he was afraid to talk to omega’s. Too shy and nervous to even say a simple hi at them. When Tony had turned 12 and showed no signs of change, Howard had made it his mission to find a strong and willing omega to be his son’s future mate. What a father wouldn’t do for his own son really.
“Because i love you Tony! I just love you so much, more than a brother should...that I don’t even know what I’m doing anymore!” Steve choked as he tried to pull the younger teen back to him. Tony couldn’t help but open his eyes as he stared up at his brother with a startled look. “W-what? No...you don’t love me..” Tony whispered making the taller teen shake his head at him. “Yes, yes i do Tony...i love you so much even though i know that it’s wrong...that’s why i kept avoiding you whenever there were people around...i wanted to get my mind off you...i went out late because I couldn’t trust myself around you anymore...the more we were alone together, the more i wanted to do things i know I shouldn’t...i tried keeping my distance as much as possible but every time i saw you inside the house with your messy hair and puffy eyes wake up so beautiful inside your bed i could never control myself...i tried but just couldn’t...” Steve trailed to lean down closer to the wide eyed brunette. “Im so sorry if i ever made you feel like i was ignoring you...i..i just wanted you to have a normal life..maybe find someone else that isn’t me...but...the moment i saw you with Bucky...i...i just couldn’t...i know this is selfish but i want you Tony...all to myself..your mine...” before Tony could realize it Steve was crying against his shoulders. Hugging him tightly as the tears fell on his side. For a moment they both stayed that way. Steve stiffening a bit when Tony stayed silent.
“W-what?”
Tony was startled to hear his brother’s voice call him. He didn’t want to see him, he didn’t want to face him just yet. So he hid, he buried his head under his pillow and didn’t move.
———————————————————-
“Can you believe it? Within two days you will finally be wed to Aldrich Killian! One of the Top Alpha’s in the city!” Maria Squealed with delight, ignoring the look Tony had given her as she passed him by. “Has Steve answered your calls yet mom?” The brunette haired omega asked as he fidgeted with his fingers. His mother frowning at his question as she turned around to answer him. “No he hasn’t dear..hasn’t he contacted your step mother?” Tony just huffed as he sank down his chair. “No...He never called mama Sarah..” he sigh as he stared up the ceiling. It had been three weeks since Tony had called and told Steve of Killian’s proposal of wanting to marry Tony in front of their entire family during a brief business dinner with his Father Howard. It was such a shock to Tony when Killian had suddenly stood up from his chair to announce that he would wish to have Howard’s blessing in marrying his omega son. Tony had been so surprised at the sudden proposal he could only stare in complete shock as he heard his father say with a wide smile how he’d love for Tony to be married to him. The blond Alpha had shouted in delight at the older Alpha’s answer as he bent down to give Tony a heated kiss. Tony could only sit still in his chair when the kiss had ended. Face full of mixed emotions as he listened to his father and somehow new fiancé talk about their marriage. Within the month they would be wed as Howard didn’t want to waste time in marrying his unmated 32 year old omega son off. Maybe the unknown curse would finally be broken. Because for some reason since Tony had turned 23, (the right age to finally be courted and mated) all his suiters had somehow backed away or got into an accident leaving them unfit to marry and have pups with the omega, since usually it was their groins that were most affected.
With a nod Tony nuzzled his head as he started blabbering about making a nice garden. Witch was alright with Steve, just as long as Tony was safe.
“It’s okay...we’re only getting a collar and a leash...and some nice toys you’d like...nothing scary.” Steve said soothingly as he held his demon’s hand a little bit tighter. Tony nodded at that as he followed his master inside the shop. When Steve had rang the bell, there was a pissed off looking bold guy that seemed to be wearing an eyepatch on his left eye. Steve smiled at him as he asked if there were any nice collars for his new demon. The bold guy cocked an eye at him before glancing at Tony. Instantly leaning down to take a box and place it in front of the small demon. “Take your pick!” The man shrugged as Steve also gestured for Tony to go closer. When the little demon did, the man had quickly introduced himself as Nick Fury, the shop owner of the Demon Store. Steve also introduced himself as he smiled at the man. “He got your name on paper yet?” Fury asked as he gestured his head at the demon who was busy rummaging through the box. Steve shook his head at that as he told the other he had just gotten Tony that afternoon. “Oh...congratulations then. If you want, i do offer bonding papers for a lower price than others...want him to be officially yours right away?” Fury said with a raised brow that had Steve looking at the demon who was finally on his tiptoes as he tried to see further inside the box. Steve couldn’t help the stupid smile he had on as he nodded a yes at the shop owner. “Alright! Step on the back once you’ve done here...also feel free to look around...got everything else hanging already..” Fury said before turning to go inside the shop’s back door.
“Thank you for the birthday party Tony” Steve purred before nudging his nose against Tony’s. A blush spread on the brunettes face as he felt himself get hard down there. Steve could be such a tease sometimes and the Blond didn’t even know it. In a heart beat Tony carefully pushed the Hybrid off of him and quickly got up trying to ignore the bulge in his pants as possible.
“Happy birthday Steve..” Tony said with a charming grin. All the Hybrid could do was smile and purr in happiness as he dropped the box next to him and crawled towards his generous owner. He stuck out his tongue as he started to lick and nip at the Brunettes face and neck.
———————————————————-
“Ugh...Nat?”
A month had gone by and Tony had mostly gotten use to Steve’s new appearance. The blond had admitted he had been doing extra workouts and training while in boot camp, which his doctor said might of triggered his body to have a growths spurt. Plus his doctor had been giving him those weird vitamins that he said were good in boosting his height. Tony had been very considerate of it all as he listened to the omega explain. It had become clear to him that the omega actually wanted this to happen and he could understand. And he had to admit Steve was really hot. And he meant really, really hot. Not that he didn’t find Steve attractive before but now well..there really wasn’t any other way of saying it than Steve was absolutely Hot.
The hydra’s head snapped to where the voice was coming from, heart thumping fast, overwhelmed with relief and joy at hearing his wife’s voice call him. “Tony?...where are you...” Steve called out as he sniffed the air, trying to trace the omega’s faint scent. Feet moving quickly as he walked towards where Tony’s faint scent was coming from, along with his voice. “TONY! ohhh Tony...” Steve breathed with relief once had he spotted Tony. the large Alpha immediately ran to his side, face full of confusion and concern as he realized how wet Tony was.  The omega only smiled reassuringly as he held out the colorful flowers he held in his hand. “I was picking flowers for the kitchen table when i heard the sound of water nearby, I couldn’t help myself...achoo!” Tony sneezed as he giggled a bit when Steve’s expression had turned into one of annoyance.
Steve smiled as he nuzzled his face against Tony’s hair as they walked to their door. Scenting his beloved master as best as he could before a frown appeared on his face as he continued to sniff the engineer’s scent. He didn’t mind it at first since Tony had just arrived and was smelling of many things from his travel but now that he was sniffing Tony more closely he could smell a faint scent that wasn’t the brunette’s. Hissing a bit as he felt very territorial all of a sudden, Tony glanced at that with a furrowed brow. making Steve nuzzle his face again at the brunette in apology, he really didn’t mean to hiss like that as he playfully licked at Tony’s cheek making the other blush as he was opening the door to their apartment. He had been waiting for the short brunette to come home since the time he hd left. He wanted to show Tony just how much he had missed him. How much he wanted to be with him, like Nat was with Clint. Seeing the two being so close and intimate had made him wonder what it would be like to have Tony pressed against him on their bed. The two of them panting and moaning as they’d ravish each other senseless like what Bucky and Nat were doing as well. Clint had been very gentle with the redhead hybrid. Giving her loving praises and tender touches but When Bucky had mounted on her he was everything but gentle. Steve gaped with a bright blush as ha watched Bucky press and squeeze against her, Thrusting in her brutally as she gripped and moaned at the sheets. Clint was a bit upset as he glanced at his trashed apartment while Sharon was busy tending to beaten up Sam.
"There's not much about Earth that we do understand," said Gamora. "Only that Thanos was intent on defeating the Avengers."
Action figures that Tony was certain he had even played with as a child, or at least he had before—
, just like he had with Papa, and so far Uncle Bucky far preferred
"Okay, well, I guess that doesn't matter anymore now, does it?" Steve said with a frown. "But since we're both going up against the firing squad tomorrow morning, don't you think I should be as prepared as possible?"
He only wished that his son's selfless act hadn't been rewarded by Steve's utter failure to win the most important battle of their lives.
“Oh… um…”  Peter pauses, fiddling with his fingers before tossing Tony a look that says,
"Peter says good morning, by the way. And that he's glad you were able to get some rest.
Once Steve was settled, Tony reached his hand over Peter's head and wove his fingers through Steve's hair, telling him without words exactly what Steve needed to hear.
"Yeah—yes, sir." Peter held out his hand, biting his lip to keep from cringing when Mr Toomes took it. "I'm Peter. Peter Stark-Rogers, and I'm on the Decathlon team with Liz."
"No, sweetheart, he was fine! He was perfect!" Steve answered, his eyes glassy as he studied his husband's face. "He—he came through one of the portals, the kind that Dr Strange used, and—and then he saw us, I mean, the other us, and he said—"
"And you'll be working on your newest painting while I work on some newfangled thing for one of Pete's kids," Tony added. He sucked in a shaky breath as a single tear trailed from the corner of his eye. "Steve, I want that. I want that so much."
"Yeah. I kinda like it."
"Oh good grief, Steve," Tony grumbled, rolling his eyes.
It took nearly all of Steve's force of will to detangle himself from Tony's arms and walk away, turning once more to give him a final wave before disappearing around the corner. He walked back to his barracks room on autopilot, slumping against the door as soon as it closed behind him, his entire body tingling and his mind swimming.
"Yes, sir, according to Ms Hill."
"Yes. I'm sure it will be better," Steve had added.
"Pete, it's really late, bud," Dad said softly. He pressed a kiss to the top of Peter's head, ruffling his hair. "You need to get some sleep, this stuff can wait till tomorrow."
Billions that had apparently included not only Peter, but Uncle Bucky, Uncle Sam, Wanda, Gwen's mom and two of her brothers, and probably dozens more of Peter's classmates and teachers.
"Nope, can't say that I have," said Dad.
Tony thought as he forced himself to exit the car.
"I'm thinking this might be even more than several boatloads," he whispered as he pressed a kiss to Tony's forehead. "But I promise I'll be right here with you the whole time. No matter what you need."
needles.
The arrival of their homeroom teacher saved Gwen from having to answer, and Peter shot her a grateful smile as the teacher began reading the morning announcements, reminding the class that school pictures were being taken the following week. Peter realised that he could sometimes seem a bit two-faced when he could lament his family's crazy lifestyle at the same time as he wished he could join in on it more, but thankfully Gwen seemed to understand.
"'Night, buddy," Dad said as he kissed his forehead. "I love you."
"Because it's usually perfectly fine to just use the stove or the oven," Steve insisted. He curled his arms around Tony's waist, leaning in for what he'd intended to be a quick kiss, one that transformed into a longer, deeper one when Tony wound his arms Steve's neck, holding him in place.
“I’m only brave because I know you guys love me so much,” Steve said, thick with the tears he was trying to hold back.  “I never could’ve done that without you.”
"No, I'm better now, thanks," Peter replied. He decided to forgo putting on his pyjamas and brushing his teeth, and instead just crawled underneath his covers, clutching his polar bear to his chest and trying to stop his teeth from chattering.
And then, only a few seconds after Steve had emerged back inside the planet's atmosphere, all hell suddenly broke loose. That yellow beam—the trajectory of which he was too upset to calculate at the moment but had definitely come from Meridian airspace—had been so unnaturally bright that it had temporarily blinded him, forcing him to rely on JARVIS to prep his aircraft for landing. Steve had barely been able to regain enough of his eyesight in time to actually land, something he had never before experienced.
"Yeah, well, tell that to him," grumbled Tony. Three heartbeats passed until he froze in place, glancing up at the ceiling. "Wait. You know that I'm kidding, right?"
Tony blinked.  “Um… so then why the hell were they assembled?  We don't usually assemble hardware before it’s ordered, do we?”
While he was still slight of build, no longer did Peter's face and body carry the sickly, hollowed-out look of chronic illness. His cheeks were fuller and more peachy in tone instead of their recent stark-white, the dark purple circles under his eyes had vanished, as had the bluish tint to his lips and fingertips, and while his arms and legs were still relatively thin, they were no longer as thin as brittle sticks, in danger of snapping from only a stiff breeze.
"Okay, so…" Steve's voice trailed off as he read over the text, detailing the early life of Mark Raxton. According to the file, Raxton had also been a scientist at SHIELD, working on yet another top-secret project likely under the tutelage of the same head scientist as Morris Bench, who they still had yet to identify. Steve skimmed over the more technical aspects, his belly giving a hard swoop as he came across another name that sounded familiar.
Tony’s beautiful mouth closed around him, and Steve's entire body ignited.
Because as much as Steve hated to admit it, Anthony Stark was quite possibly the most beautiful man that he had ever seen in his life, and as much as he had tried to convince himself that he needed to hate him because of what happened to his father, from the moment he laid eyes on him in that classroom, Steve had realised that that was going to be impossible.
"There," he whispered as he leaned back against his pillows. He had been barely able to jump up and reach that branch before he'd gotten too sick to play outside anymore, which meant it was probably a bit less crooked now than it had been since he was no longer messing with it.
Steve dropped his head, chuckling. "Yes, Tony. Other than that."
"Nuh uh. Tonight it's my turn," Tony murmured as his lips closed over Steve's left nipple, gently teasing it with his teeth. Steve groaned, biting down on his lower lip as Tony kissed his way across his chest to his right nipple, nipping and teasing it with his teeth and tongue. Then he lifted his head, his brown eyes shining as he slid his left hand down Steve's abdomen, skirting his fingertips along the waistband of his sleep pants.
“Tony, I didn't mean it like that,” Steve says again.  He attempts to move, as he’s just realised he’s half-sitting on top of his shield and it’s not at all comfortable, but gives up almost before he begins.  “I’m just—”
Shaking his head, Tony chanced a glance up at Steve. The tall, broad pilot was still standing in the middle of the room, his expression so forlorn he could've given Peter's best puppy-dog eyes a run for their money.
It was unbearable.
"Okay, so, back to the torn sheets," Tony said. He glanced nervously around the massive room, hoping like hell that no one was trying to eavesdrop. "Ahh, you're sure it's safe to talk about this stuff in here?"
"Good. And how soon can they be implemented?"
"Nah, it's okay," Tony said quickly, trying to hide his disappointment. Getting to talk to Peter would've helped boost Steve's mood a bit, but he knew Steve would never wake him up just to talk on the phone.
And then Tony hummed around him as he squeezed Steve's ass, and Steve cried out as his climax overtook him, whiting out his vision and sending electric shocks coursing throughout his body.
"Yes, Mr Stark, you are sitting here," Davis said, his paper thin lips stretching into one of the fakest smiles Tony had ever seen. "And did those means that you mentioned include what I believe you referred to as the Iron Legion?"
There was also a thought bouncing around in the back of his mind that had been there ever since Beck's presentation. Beck had stated—rather emphatically—that his glasses contraption couldn't work without the added zombie effect of the CTX-616 drug, but…
Tony's heart immediately leapt into his throat. "How is he? Stacy? Tell me how he is! Is he hurt?"
"I suppose that's one way to look at it," answered Steve. "I was just glad to finally get the chance to serve my country."
Peter was alive. He was unconscious, but at least he was alive.
Thankfully, JARVIS didn't hesitate.  “Very good, sir,” he said, accompanied by three beeps and a loud
"Who?" asked Sam, obviously confused. "'Cause if you just said what I think you said, then that seems a bit too on the nose, if you know what I mean."
"Oh God, it hurts!" Peter cried, fumbling as he tried to slip his mask back on. "Please, make it stop!"
Three heartbeats later, he planted his feet, and gave it.
"Based on how quickly his broken bones have healed in the past, I'd say about two to three days at the most," answered Dr Cho. "I'm not detecting any further signs of atelectasis either, so I'm going to assume that the puncture in his right lung has already sealed itself off." She paused, her eyes sweeping across Steve. "Or, if you like, I can order another chest x-ray, just to be certain, but—"
"Oh no you don't!" he said, straining against the web as the suit attempted to jerk itself free. Grunting, Peter slowly pulled the suit towards him, finally getting enough leverage so he could slam it down onto the floor, sending pieces of it skittering across the concrete.
"Come in?"
Again, there’s no response.
Actually, he still had pretty crazy hair. No matter which direction he tried to get his curls to go they always seemed to have their own rather unpredictable plan, and he had pretty much given up trying to tame them. What little energy he did have was far better spent on things besides arm-wrestling his hair into place.
And he had always been right. No matter the cost, ever since that day in the middle of the desert, Steve had always come through for them.
I can’t wait to see what you think!  Please don’t forget to hit the kudos button and leave me a comment! ♥️
The sound of an electronic lock clicking open stopped Tony in his tracks, and he looked over at the door in a panic as Steve stepped inside, obviously fresh from the shower and carrying a loaded tray of food.
"Oh, yeah, I remember my dad saying something about that," Gwen said with a nod. "Okay… so…?"
"Still doesn't mean I'm gonna sleep," Steve said, rather petulantly. Tony huffed as he dropped his hand from Steve's head, rolling his eyes.
"I'm not sure I'd want to show these paintings off to the world," he said. "They're of our family, and I like keeping our family close."
"Yes, you do," said Papa. "And I hope you know that there's no way our family would be complete without you."
"I'd just like to take him, please," Steve insisted. He shifted so he was leaning against the back of the tub, holding his arms out for Peter. "Please."
"Yes, she did," Stacy said gently. "Just like I did after the incident at the theatre."
With a self-deprecating roll of his eyes—
"Tony!" Steve cried as Tony slid his hand between their bodies, curling his calloused fingers around both their erections and stroking them together, pleasure pooling deep in his gut when Tony let out another loud moan. "Sweetheart, I can't—I—oh God,
"Look, I'm sorry, okay? I wasn't trying to be mean, I'm just…"
"I'm gonna spend the rest of my life being good to you, sweetheart," Steve said. "And that's a promise."
"All right. Why don't you go and work on your homework now, yeah?"
And also likely just as terrified as Steve, since he had no way of knowing where they were or if they were even still alive.
Bruce's head snapped back in surprise. "Ahh, and why not?"
And he still needed to come up with something to tell Peter. Sam had told him just an hour or so ago that Peter was already getting suspicious, and Tony knew that he couldn't keep putting him off for too much longer. It wasn't fair to his poor boy to keep him in the dark.
"Holy shit!" he exclaimed, fighting to keep his eyes open as he raced along what could only be described as parallel warp trails, arriving at his pre-calculated coordinates before he'd even had time to take another breath. As soon as he stopped, Tony blinked, then blinked again, not quite believing what he was seeing.
"Steve, you're still here?" she said in surprise as she set Peter's food down on the rolling table and reached for her stethoscope, placing the bell against Peter's chest. "I thought I had just missed you leaving."
“Morning, Steve!” Natasha calls from her cubicle in the opposite corner.
Thank you so much for all of the wonderful comments!  I’m so glad you guys are enjoying the story! 💗
"He is already there," answered Dr Strange. "As are the others."
"Then he should be scared!" Tony screamed, so loudly that his own ears started to ring. Steve immediately froze, his lips clamped together and his eyes squeezed tightly closed. It was a testament to his stubbornness that his grip on Tony didn't lessen in the slightest, even as Tony knew he would've liked nothing more than to shove Tony away from him. Steve absolutely hated any kind of shouting or screaming, not only because it hurt his serum-sensitive ears, but because it also reminded him way too much of being in battle.
of Steve's slow, steady heartbeat beneath his ear fighting against his own almost overwhelming urge to either panic or cry.
Steve's full lips curled into a slight smile as he wound his arms around Tony's waist, pulling him down and rolling over so he was half-trapped beneath him.
"Now, Steven, you do at least know that it's polite to stand up when a lady enters the room, right?" said Hammer. He stepped forward, slamming against the window with his palm and sending more shockwaves of pain down Steve's spine. "So on your feet,
It’s still better than drowning himself in Scotch, though, which is how Tony justifies it.  He figures that since he hasn’t had a single drop of the hard stuff since the night the nursery doctor called to tell him about Peter, he can indulge in his coffee as much as he wants.
Hope was a dangerous thing, and something that Steve had never put much stock in, preferring to go on facts and plans instead.
"Mmm," Peter said as he took a long drink, his cheeks hollowing out with how thick it was. "This is so awesome, Papa, thank you!"
Tony snapped. He took Steve's face in his hands, preventing him from looking away. "Goddamnit, that's exactly what's keeping you from seeing the problem! You keep thinking you have to hide it, but you don't have to! This isn't the 1940's anymore, Steve, it's not unacceptable for a man to admit that he needs help!"
"It is?"
Of course, that had been Peter's very argument for trying to remain in the lab, pleading with Tony that he could somehow help and finally forcing Tony to pull out the "because I said so" card that he always kept hidden deep inside his back pocket, in the hopes that he wouldn't have to use it.
Tony opened one eye, looking so fondly at Peter that Steve's heart nearly melted. "Well, good," he said softly. "They feeding you enough over there in that palace, bud?"
The last part only when Steve wasn't around, of course.
"He's joking, babe," he said gently. "You know Bruce's sense of humour has a tendency to be a bit too on the nose sometimes, right?"
They stayed there, just clinging to each other in the middle of the bed for several minutes, until Steve carefully pulled out of Tony and laid him down, pressing a soft kiss to his lips before getting up to fetch a washcloth from the tiny bathroom. His face was etched in adoration mixed with worry as he carefully cleaned Tony's body, gathering him into his arms under the blankets once he was done. The record player was still on, but since it needed to be wound up about every hour or so, Tony figured it would be turning off soon.
“Sure,” answered Peter, even though he’d already completed all of his homework during the last hour he’d been sitting around.  “But once I’m done, is it okay if I walk down to that new bookstore I told you about?  The one that just opened like a couple weeks ago?”
"Oh, yeah," Peter mumbled, his cheeks flushing hot. "I get—I get 'em from my dad. Takes pretty fast reflexes to pilot his Iron Man suits, so…"
"Oh, well, then that makes perfect sense," said Tony. "Gotta go where the girl's going."
"Honey, there's no shame in asking for help when you need it," Tony said. "And you're only hurting your feet more by trying to walk on them."
But as soon as they sat down in the nearly-empty theatre, Gwen took Peter's popcorn and Dr Pepper from him and set them on the seat next to her, her green eyes blazing as she held Peter's hands between her own.
Maybe even more so.
Ma said fondly as she patted Little Steve's hand. "
Something about the description caught Tony's eye, but it wasn't until the third reread that he realised that it sounded an awful lot like the speech Aldrich Killian had given in his presentation for Aminacin, shortly before he broke into the Tower and kidnapped Peter.
"Yeah, of course he did," grumbled Peter. "Can you patch me into the Avengers' comms, please?"
"Peter hasn't told me anything about you, sir," Steve interrupted. "As I'm sure you've noticed, he is an extremely polite young man. His father and I just want to make sure that he's kept as safe as possible, and since he became ill while at your home, we just felt that—"
"Mr Stark," T'Challa said with a sigh. "As I have said, I do apologise. But if everything you have told me is true, then I am unsure as to how sharing our defensive technology will be helpful. We currently have no way of knowing when or if another attack will occur, and we simply cannot become responsible for the protection of the entire world. That is not something that would be asked of any other country, and Wakanda must be given the same consideration. Until the time is right, we will continue as we always have, sharing our resources and knowledge as the needs arrive, and not before."
"Then we'll fucking head into it!" Tony yelled, the final remnants of his patience finally fraying into nothing but wisps of thread. "I can't believe we're all still sitting here on our asses when we know where he's headed! This is
Tony thought.
Dad shrugged. "Oh, I don't know. Papa's not really interested in trying to incorporate shrinking tech into our training repertoire, and frankly, neither am I, so—"
The thought of their son having to go through that awful procedure… their sweet boy who loved to draw and climb trees, who had the biggest, most beautiful brown eyes that Steve had ever seen, the exact same shade of brown as his father's… the sweet boy who called Steve 'Papa' having to experience such agonising pain…
"Mmm, hey yourself," he said. "Is Peter back yet?"
"I did. We even spent the night together, but then—"
"Well, we're not gonna let that happen," Natasha stated. "We're doing this to bring people back, not to lose anyone else."
“Huh?” Tony says, like he’s only just noticing Steve is there. “You say something, Cap?”
Tossing his glasses onto the counter, Tony scrubbed his palm down his face, his heart thudding and his shoulders and neck aching from having to listen to Steve literally fight his way out of the atmosphere.
Tony breathed a sigh of relief as he felt Steve take his hand, his gorgeous face displaying the same cacophony of emotions he had a strong feeling were written all over his own.
"Uh huh," answered Peter. "Say hi to everyone for me, okay?"
A chorus of murmured assent erupted from the team members, followed by the loud scraping of chairs against the polished linoleum floor. Steve and Tony hung back until everyone else had exited the room, with Steve turning to Tony as soon as they were alone.
The stupid throat tickle that Peter absolutely despised suddenly roared to life, and he doubled over, clutching his abdomen as he tried to get through it without his heart rate spiking too high. He had a strong feeling that Grandma would report his every single move to his dads, and he didn't need them worrying about him any more than they already did.
Uncle Bucky attempted a smile. He only managed what Peter would call a kind of quarter-smile, but he supposed it was better than nothing.
"Pete?" Tony called, relieved when his voice didn't waver too much. "Buddy, what's your position?"
Not that it likely mattered much. By his calculations, the ship had only about twenty-four hours worth of life support left. He could maybe extend that a bit if he happened to hold his breath every now and then, but after that…
"Daddy?" Peter cried. "Daddy, they can't have me! I won't let them!"
Steve thought desperately. He tried to pinch himself, to prove that he was just trapped in one of his nightmares, but he was too frozen with dread to even move.
"Is it ever, sir?"
Steve's lips twitched, his eyebrows knitting together as he gently removed Tony's glasses, setting them on the bedside table.
“Oh?” Natasha asks, raising her eyebrow.  “What kind of appointment?”
"Holy shit, baby, you're just so fucking gorgeous," he whispered, burying his fingers into Steve's thick blond hair. "How are you even real?"
against all odds, Steve had been given a second chance at something that really had no business granting such a thing.
"Steve," he whimpered, his heart in his throat. "C'mon, honey, don't let them do this!"
But then, to Steve's abject horror, only a split-second before the blade would have pierced Thanos' purple flesh, it was knocked away, embedding itself into the trunk of a distant tree with a loud
And while Steve knew it was just another of Tony's defence mechanisms—both Tony and Peter had admitted as such—it still hurt pretty badly in the heat of the moment.
about the fact that my son is sitting in a hospital room dying a slow death while they sit around on their collective asses and debate about whether or not I'm right about this stuff! Which I am, just in case you were wondering!"
"Let off some steam, hmm?" Tony asked.
Mrs Rogers smiled. "How 'bout, Grandma?"
looking forward to the inevitable questions that would no doubt lead to yet another lecture from his dads.
"So, that was fun, hmm?" Bucky said once they had finally returned to the hangar. "Nothing like getting shot at every ten seconds to get your heart pumping a bit?"
(See the end of the chapter for
Family and stability. Steve had craved those things for as long as he could remember, and now that he had them, or at least had the family part, all he wanted was to hang onto them.
"It doesn't?" Tony asked with wide eyes. "So you're saying it's just some random coincidence?"
"Well… like I said. It all just pretty much sucks." Sharon tilted her head, giving Steve a warm smile. "I'm sure he'll perk up once he sees you, though. He's a real sweetie but he's pretty down at the moment. The doctors don't think he'll be going home anytime soon."
Steve smiled back at him as he grabbed the outstretched hand and shook it with a strong grip, making Killian wince a bit as he tried to pull his hand away. “Sorry...don’t know my own strength sometimes..” Steve said with a winked at him before glancing back down at Tony who swatted his chest playfully. “I actually can’t stay long...I’m only here to wish you two best of luck for tomorrow..” he finally confessed as he glanced around the room. “What? Why? You only just got here!” Sarah gasped with wide eyes. “I know...i know...it’s just that it’s a really busy time for us at the university..I can’t even begin to tell you how stressed i am right now..i only came to see everyone and at least tell you in person Tony how happy i am for you” the last part sounded a bit stern but Steve still pulled off a happy smile in front of the omega. Tony could only stare up at him, gaping like a fool. Steve had come all this way just to tell him this. He just couldn’t believe the things Steve would go through just to make him feel happy. A blush spread on his face as he nuzzled his head against Steve’s again. “Thank you Steve...” he whispered as he clung to the alpha. Feeling a bit confused when he felt the alpha shiver a bit, making him look up with worried eyes. “I ugh...I’m just really hungry..” Steve said with a light blush as he finally let go of Tony. “Oh dear you must be starving! Here...come sit next to me sweety...We have roasted chicken and lamb chops..“ Sarah said as she ushered the blond alpha to an empty seat next to her.  Dinner had went well as they all started chatting and laughing. With Steve even praising Killian a bit for his works, easing Tony’s worries as he did. Eventually Killian had to go as he was called into a conference meeting with his business partners in japan. When Dinner had ended Tony had escorted Steve into his old room. The two laughing when they both stumbled onto the large bed.
Speaking of which…
“Tony you know you shouldn’t be wandering off like that...it’s dangerous..you had me worried” Steve said with a serious tone. The tiny omega nuzzled his wet head against the hydra’s chest as he muttered an apology. Saying he didn’t mean to make him worry. With a sigh Steve shook his head before scooping up the wet omega into his arms. “It’s alright...just please pick the flowers that are actually near our home next time”
When Bucky had went into the bathroom to wash, Steve had sneakily cornered him in his room as the blond had pinned him down his bed. Tony had actually tried to resist as he didn’t want the other teen to suddenly burst in and find them both kissing. Also he was still upset with the blond for going out with Peggy and not coming home early. Unfortunately he was weak when it came to his brother as he started moaning when Steve had began ravishing him endlessly till they heard the bathroom door creak from across the hall.
He had been infatuated by the shy, nerdy teen ever since he had caught him staring at Bucky on the football field. The small teen always had this adorable expression on his face as he looked at Bucky, who didn’t seem to care or notice him that much. Steve had noticed though, he had noticed the way Tony would watch them play from the bleachers, cheering them on with his own little way..he wasn’t like all the other student’s who had been after Steve or Bucky, full of self confidence and eagerness..just to be cool, and get noticed by the entire school. No..Tony never once came near them just so he could get his 20 minutes of fame with them. he never even once shouted at them how much he loved them when they were practicing like all the other’s did. Instead he’d sit in the corner, watching gleefully as the team did their best that day. Steve had even saw the brunette clean up after them on the fields when they had all gone inside. It was adorable how the brunette didn’t want to get noticed by them. Didn’t crave the attention everyone was begging them. that’s when Steve wanted him..the only problem was that he didn’t seem find Steve interesting as he did with Bucky.
My world crumbles when you are not here
After a few more minutes Tony decided that Steve probably didn’t want to come with him. With a tired sigh he stood up and slowly walked back home with his head down. Glancing a bit to see the tiny Hybrid stay where he was. He waved goodbye before walking steadily back home again. A few steps later however he realized the blond was actually following him. A wide smile spread on his face as he gestured for Steve to come closer and walk beside him.
When it was all over, Tony couldn’t help but smile at his alpha as he panted heavily. feeling absolutely Sticky and wet while Steve’s tentacles continued to wrap around him. The blond also smiling widely when Tony had nuzzled his head tiredly against Steve’s chest.
“I can’t believe you can’t even trust Tony to leave him in his dorm while he’s in his rut” Peggy said with a frown as she stared at them. Sharon nodding next to her. Steve huffed at that while Tony made a small whine. “It’s not that I don’t trust Tony...i know he’d never be unfaithful to me...it’s everyone else i don’t trust, even Alpha’s here are after him” “For fucks sakes!!! I swear I wasn’t trying to get in Tony’s pants! I-i was only trying to help him get undress!” Bucky snapped bright red, making the two Carter cousins stare at him with wide eyes. Rhodey just sigh as he took a bite off his sandwich. Where was Pepper and Happy when he needed them.
“S-Steve…T-Tony…” Pepper’s shocked voice broke the alpha’s tranced state. Head snappig back up as he realized that his giflfriend had arrived. Pepper could only blink a few times as she stared at the scene before her.
This however, was super unexpected as he was now celebrating his 17th birthday at the CEO’s very own mansion. Surrounded by all his friends from school. It all felt so unreal that he was actually having an awsome pool party in one of the riche’s homes in Manhattan.
And just like that Tony felt his insides do a somersault, not sure anymore if he’d like the idea of someone else taking care of the small hybrid, if that someone else would actually take care of Steve like the blond hybrid deserved. He felt himself tremble as he thought of how unfair life had already been to steve, he really didn’t want the hybrid to endure more. and as a pair of bright blue eyes locked with his, he knew it already. He was done for. A single glance at Bruce was all he needed for the vet to grin.
Peter raised his head, his curls flopping as he nodded vigorously. "Yeah, Papa! That sounds great!"
If anyone was a true hero, it was Peter. The military could gloat all they wanted about how long it had been since the last successful Meridian attack or how much safer Langaran citizens were under their protection, but Tony knew that it was all just a bunch of propaganda.
And he really had no business being attracted to anyone at the moment, either. Not with his son in the hospital fighting for his life, and everything else that was at stake.
“Tony?” Steve calls, blinking as he examines the broken window.  He knows Tony is fast; he’s seen him in action plenty of times.  But he can’t seem to shake the feeling that there’s something else going on here.
he thought, not without the slightest hint of humour. Oh, Tony had no doubt that if Steve had been there to witness Mr Dumb-Lord holding a fucking
Not that Peter could blame him, of course, but it still made him sad. Of all the things that could’ve happened to Papa, being frozen in ice again was probably one of the worst.
His new thigh-length shorts will have to do.
"No! Don't!" Peter croaked as Thanos' head whipped towards the wizard, his grip loosening ever-so-slightly as he eyed Dr Strange.
"Okay," he gasped under his breath as he gripped the back of the chair next to where he was perched. Yanking it free, he twisted slightly and launched it directly at the flaming pile, blowing a hole through the weakened wooden doors that was just wide enough for the people to get through if they went single file.
"Hey, Steve!" Peter exclaimed as soon as Steve stepped inside, stifling a grimace at the sharp smell of external oxygen that filled the room. "You came back!"
It was long, tedious work, made even worse by the fact that Peter couldn't seem to keep his tired eyes open for longer than about fifteen minutes at a time. It wasn't until after he'd eaten dinner and taken yet another short nap that he managed to finally stumble upon a coding line that didn't seem to fit with his usual methodology. Dad had always told Peter that every person who wrote code had their own rather unique "coding language", kind of like how each person's handwriting was just a bit different from everyone else's, and there was one line inserted about thirty lines from the bottom that on second glance, just didn't seem to fit.
boom!
Oh, Tony’s mom helped in the very beginning, teaching Tony how to hold his tiny baby, how to feed him and diaper him and get him to burp without urping up every single ounce he’d just eaten.  She even took a few of the godawful middle-of-the-night sessions, when Peter would do nothing but scream his tiny head off for hours and hours and hours, leaving Tony so frazzled that he felt like his very skin was buzzing.
"He's in surgery at the moment, bud," Dad said. "He's… well… one of his arms got pretty messed up, and they're not sure if they're gonna be able to save it or not, so… we'll know more once he's out, but—"
"I love you, mo grá. I love you so much."
And while the U.S. and Russia were supposedly on friendly—or at least friendlier—terms now, the same couldn't be said for the U.S. and a few other countries, something the current president was attempting to exploit by enacting policies that Papa had bluntly termed, "exclusionary". Already there was serious talk about building walls, limiting immigration, and other various policies meant to, in President Cole's words, "Bring pride back to what it means to be an American". President Cole had even had the gall to repeatedly reference Peter and Dad's kidnapping in Afghanistan to try and justify his words, only backing down when Dad got Pepper's massive PR machine in motion and asked him to stop.
"None of us have been the same, Miss Stacy," Tony said as he knelt down next to the distraught girl, gently retrieving the computer. "But your father is right, you need to be getting home now. Okay?"
It had truly been a wonderful summer.
"I want you," Steve growled low into Tony's ear, his lips traveling up and down Tony's neck and shoulder. "Ba mhaith liom tú chomh holc sin. Please, sweetheart, can I have you?"
"Ah, Captain, Stark," Thor said as soon as they walked into the room. "Please accept my most sincere condolences on Young Starkson's injuries. I trust, though, that he will make a full recovery?"
And just like that, with three simple words, all of the tension and fear that Tony had been carrying for an entire week began to seep from his body like he was a human sieve.  He tipped forward, thudding his forehead against Steve’s chest as Steve’s strong arms wrapped around him and held him tight.
Operation Darkstalker.
Before he can ask Tony to clarify, Tony starts to laugh.  “Wow, I just realised how completely weird that must’ve sounded,” he says.  “Happy and Pepper are friends of mine.  They’ve known Pete almost his entire life, and he thinks of ‘em as like an honorary uncle and aunt.  They used to go to all of his soccer games and stuff, and they work only a few blocks away from Pete’s school, so if worse comes to worse, they said they could pick him up and bring him here for me.”
"Don't you think it would be better to wait for us inside, little guy?" Papa asked, glancing worriedly into the rearview mirror. "It's pretty cold outside, and according to the weather it's not going to warm up anytime soon."
"There are tools aboard," said Gamora, tossing a wary glance over at Strange. "But I really don't think that—"
But, if he knew that doing so was the best way to keep Tony and Peter from possible harm, then he would do it without question. He was a husband and a father, and it was his duty to keep his family safe no matter how much Tony decided to protest.
They had all stood by Steve and Tony during some of their darkest hours, and now they were all there to celebrate with them on one of the best days of their lives.
"Mr Stark! Do you have any comments on your father's vindication from his arrest for treason following the Battle of the Continents?"
"If you're sure," Steve said, his lips barely brushing the shell of Tony's ear. He slid his hand under Tony's ass, pressing him up against him and moaning at Tony's answering groan. "But I'm gonna take my time with you. Give you a bit of your own medicine, hmm?"
"We went over the satellites yesterday, Grandpa," Peter cut in. "Remember?"
“That’s only ‘cause I could never beat you, buddy, right?” Tony said.  He playfully knocked his shoulder against Peter’s, shooting Steve another shy glance.  “Kid’s been better than me ever since I taught him how to play.”
"There's a toothbrush and razor for you by the sink," Steve said once he'd finished tying his shoes. He sat down on the bed, trailing his fingers along Tony's jawline. "And I'll bring back some breakfast for you too, okay?"
"Well, that's kinda beside the point now, sir, wouldn't you say?" Steve replied. "I still should've had all the facts before I agreed to participate, and yet you specifically chose to leave that one off. Why?"
“Mmph!” Steve hissed through his clenched teeth as he squeezed his eyes closed, pulling up the mental image he’d just spent the last hour sketching.  Imagining the plushness of Tony’s lips as he kissed them, the softness of his olive-toned skin as it slid against his own, and the way his lithe body would fit perfectly into Steve’s arms.
Not wanting to waste a golden opportunity, Steve had also asked Shuri to take a peek at Tony's heart and its surrounding blood vessels, where she set about repairing the internal scars left behind from the shrapnel, arc reactor, and the surgery Tony had had after the arc reactor was damaged. She had even offered to heal the damaged nerves in Tony's left arm, which he had suffered way back during one of his first missions as Iron Man. Tony had always tried hard to hide just how often the arm had bothered him over the years, but Steve had always been able to see right through him.
“TONY!” the hydra creature shouted as he began to go inside the woods.
He glanced down to look at his beautiful prince who had nuzzled even closer. He inhaled sharply as he promised himself he'd find a way..
Tony could only close his eyes in embarrasement as he heard all four men growl possessively at one another. His heat driven mind tried to think coherently as he sniffed the lust filled air around him. They were offering themselves to him. All four of them. And it really did feel nice, If he wasn’t already bounded he would of accepted anyone of them right away. But he was, and to the pack Alpha at best. He really should shoo them away before all of them regrets this.
When it was time for the ceremony to begin, Pepper, Sarah and Maria frown when they had realized Tony still hadn’t shown up. Howard and Killian frowning instantly along with a few guest as they all realized that the bride was missing.
At that moment he had promised to claim Tony as his when the time was right. Hoping and praying the human wouldn’t be bonded to another while he was still protecting them. Curse their stupid agreement to be not be seen by human’s. Before he had left the elders of the higher ranks Steve had agreed to not be seen and his words were bounded to his chest. Marking it with a curse that would burn him inside out if he ever made contact with the human’s who didn’t need his help within the five year duration. Thankfully no human Alpha had taken a claim on Tony yet. His Tony now that he thought about it.
Tony was already due this month, and him and Steve had been absolutely excited in welcoming their little one into their lives. Though Tony did feel a bit nervous at the thought of popping out his big baby inside of him. Luckily Nat was now an expert and well experience at that and had already reassured Tony that everything will be alright. Making the brunette feel a bit better at the thought of labour.
Steve had noticed this and tried his best not to stare back at the adorable way Tony was looking at him, seriously Steve wanted to kiss him so bad right now. Steve swallowed hard as he felt himself sweat, The smaller teen will never know the trouble and horrible suffering Steve had went through just to find the perfect outfit for their date. It had even took him half an hour just to comb his hair the right way until he said screw it and put a cap on instead.
———————————————————-
Tony woke up to a small warm body pressed up against him, rubbing his face with his hand a bit, he yawned as he felt the other nuzzle even closer. A wide grin spread on his face as he rumpled the small blonds hair near his chest. The tiny blond had put up quite a fight last night when he had told him to take a bath, claws marking his bathroom door and shampoo bottles scattered all over the tiled floor.  He’d have to clean that up later when they’d done away with visiting the vet.
Tony immediately followed them. Brows furrowed as he decided to just stand and watch them. Peggy was still giggling as she tried to stand up, Steve pulling her down again making her laugh and shout at him to let her go. The scene was enough to make Tony want to punch the dumb drunk blond in front of him. He hadn’t even acknowledged the brunette, it was as if Tony was invisible. Tony was about to help the struggling friend off his brother when Steve had suddenly leaned up and pulled Peggy closer, hazel brown eyes widen as they watched the tall blond greedily kiss Peggy. The senior brunette had gasp at the action at first before melting into the kiss. Tony stood frozen in shock, heart pounding at the way Steve was ravishing someone else’s face, The scene was just to much for the younger brunette to handle as he felt himself tremble. With shaky legs Tony managed to run up to his room. Slamming the door as loud as he could as he slid down behind it.
Tony himself couldn’t help but to gape at the adonis walking beside him, holding his tiny hand like it actually belonged there. Steve’s hand had been holding his hand so gently ever since the blond had arrived at his doorstep to pick him up. He had even brought a basket that he said contained some homemade cheese burgers his mom had made. Tony liked homemade food..his mother was always too busy to prepare a home cooked meal for him and his also busy dad. So whenever someone offered him homed cooked foods, he was always weak to resist. He remembers telling the tall blond this as he seemed to write it in his notes.
“Tony…” Thor whispered as he sat on the edge of the bed, hand reaching out to caress the side of Tony’s face. “…you are such a wonderful Omega. Brave, beautiful…smart…What any of us would give to have you as our mate…but you have choosen Steve. And we, all of us here respect that. But…your alpha is not here right now..he is with another omega. An omega who you had approved of to share his first heat with.” Thor paused as he slowly leaned in closer to brush his lips against the other.
When the teasing had stop the whole gang had decided to take a hike in the woods before eventually settling to go for a cool swim on a nearby lake. The six teens had been doing this routine for the next five days, exchanging creepy ghost stories at night on an open fire as well. On the sixth day they had all went to the lake again and had a small picnic. Bruce taking pictures as Thor tried desperately to photobomb his shots. Nat and Clint had disappeared for a while before coming back with smug little smiles. Thor immediately smacking the beta on the back proudly.
"Your eyes are one of the first things I ever noticed about you, when I first saw your picture in your SHIELD file," added Steve. "You and Peter both. I remember thinking, how could such a handsome, wealthy, and successful man have such sad, troubled eyes?"
Literally going back in time to fight a battle they had already fought.
"Верстак," replied Natasha. "It means, 'Bench'."
"Tony—" he started.

Away from all the memories that haunted them, no matter how hard they wished for them to just
"I won't if you don't," Tony shot back, his palms gliding up Steve's back. "Don't you dare try and be some kind of superhero now, you got that? This is just another mission. You just do all of the same fancy flying that you usually do and let JARVIS take care of the rest, yeah?"
“It only counts if you're a Jedi Master, Dad,” Peter said as he stepped out of the car.  He hesitated before closing the door, shaking his head a couple seconds later.  “Have a good day.”
cried Captain Barnes. "Stevie, Danvers, did you see that? I just took that fucker out with only the guns!"
Steve inhaled a shaky breath, letting it out slowly. It made sense, what Tony and Sam and were saying about Smythe. If he was another one of the semi-enhanced programmable soldiers then he likely would've been on the same list as the rest of the enhanced people, and probably would have tried to attack Peter the moment he saw him, not just been hanging back and watching him all this time.
"Are you willing to bet on that, sir?"
Tony's head had snapped up at the words, "old drug," and his eyes narrowed, studying the image in front of him. The only "old drug" he knew of that could possibly help someone interface with a holographic system was the CTX-616, but Tony had ordered all of it destroyed after the team had discovered that Obie had administered it to Peter in Afghanistan so he could wipe his mind while the Ten Rings experimented on him.
"If we need you," said Carol. "Which, no offence, we're kinda hoping we won't."
"And you're mine."
Three heartbeats later Steve's beautiful voice came over the radio. "Phoenix One has made it safely it into space, Control. And oh man, what a sight this is! It's incredible! I wish you all could see this!"
Peter's belly gave a swoop at Mr Stacy's gruff tone, and he set down his fork, taking a slow, deliberate sip of his water.
how scared you were when you were trapped down there! Your eyes are completely incapable of lying, and they were screaming volumes at me the whole time, so don't you dare try and insult me now by trying to tell me that you're fine!"
Steve's lips twitched, his eyes softening just a bit as he glanced over to where their team stood, surrounded by Thor's people and protected by a group of wizards who up until a year ago, Tony hadn't believed even existed.
Peter had just started going over his latest editions to JARVIS's code—which included three more additional layers of encryption—when someone knocked on his door.
"Huh?" Tony said, barely coherent against the crushing weight of his fear. "But the doctors always told me that if Pete ever had to go on a vent, that he'd—that he'd never get off of it!"
Instead of answering, Phillips turned his datapad around to show Tony, his jaw dropping as he noticed at least three different sets of aircraft that were nearly identical to current Langaran Air Corps designs.
"Oh, nothing, just making sure," Peter said with a rapid shake of his head. "Um… there's a red-haired girl, her name's Wanda, and she was being held captive here too. She's the one who got me out of my cell, and she told me that once she found where they were keeping her brother, she was gonna head down to get Papa out."
"Uh huh. See ya then." As soon as the screen went blank, Peter dropped his head back, scrubbing at his tired and wonky eyes with his knuckles. He'd packed his glasses into his backpack thinking that he'd try and sleep on the plane—that'd been Papa's plan, at least—but with Dad vibrating so hard that he was practically knocking the jet off course, Peter hadn't been able to relax enough to fall asleep. He had tried to call Gwen, thinking she'd be able to help him calm down, but her mom had told him that she was out on a daddy-daughter date, and wouldn't be home until late that night.
, but then Steve came along and managed to change things. Before Steve, Tony's main focus had always been Peter and Peter alone, pouring almost all of his attention and energy into his son's well-being and future, and leaving very little left over for either himself or the company he was supposed to be running.
"But you did," Steve insisted. He brushed his lips along Tony's temple, fighting to contain his own tears. "You fought for him so hard because you believed that he could get better someday. No one else could've done better, sweetheart, absolutely no one. Colonel Phillips told me that Peter would've been gone a long time ago if he hadn't had such a caring father as yourself."
“So… you're the owner here, then?” he asked.
“That's my man.”
"Will you be able to come back tomorrow, Steve?" Peter asked as Sharon listened to his chest. "You didn't quite finish your drawing."
The only difference between the new bike and the original was that this one had a second seat, so Tony would be able to ride on it with Steve once they got home.
"Oh. Well… I like it," Tony murmured.
"'Cept this Gwen gal?"
"Yeah?" Tony said, and Steve was relieved to hear the slight quiver in his voice, grateful he wasn't the only one who was nervous. "You clean up pretty nice there yourself, Captain."
"Ahh, yeah," Tony murmured after a short pause. "Or at least, I made an educated guess based on some of the stories you've told me." He leaned back, his brown eyes a mixture of love, concern, and admiration. "Did it work?"
"Ah, that'd be Phantom of the Opera, Uncle Thor," Peter piped up from somewhere off to Tony's left. "We can go once we get home, okay? And I'm pretty sure Uncle Bucky and Uncle Sam wanna come too."
The amount of lighting and electricity that Steve's four teammates launched at the creature was so bright and so strong that the medical equipment inside the Suburban actually blew out, requiring Bruce to hook up the auxiliary power. Squinting, Steve watched as the monster let out a final bellowing roar before exploding, showering the entire lake and the surrounding shoreline with icy water.
"Jesus Christ, Pete!" he gasped, gulping for air as he took in his sweet son, who was dipping into a full-sized bag of Doritos. "Buddy, you've gotta quit being so damn quiet!"
Thoughts ?? please leave a comment for they give me motivation to write and post faster!
It would be too hard to pick just one. He hated choosing, especially since now he knew that all of them wanted him.
The sudden realization was enough to frighten the brunette a bit. Maybe he should start being more independent and stop seeking the blond every time they weren’t in school. Everything would be so much easier if he didn’t spend as much time with Steve at home. He was just too attached to his older brother that he hadn’t realized how dependent he hd become towards the older teen. He was probably going to become a burden when they got older and he’d still be clinging to the other like a little lost child. He really didn’t want that, and so with his final thoughts Tony had decided to keep away as best as he could from the blond. Give him as much space as he needed and who knows, maybe Tony might find someone else he could be with when he got older.
But before Tony could open his mouth as he opened the door, Steve and Peggy had stumbled to the floor. Both laughing and giggling as Tony stared at them with wide eyes. The two had managed to stand up with Sam shouting an apology to Tony for bringing his brother home late. Tony had snapped his head at that, turning to give the two seniors a quick glare fixed with a cute pout that made the two boys blush and giggle inside the car like the drunks they were. When Tony had turned his attention back to Steve and Peggy again he realized the two had managed to get up and stumbled into the living room couch.
I just uploaded the cover image for this on the first chap incase any of you haven't seen it yet! Pls give it a look as it is how i imagined Steve and Tony to look
As he started to cradled the smaller man resting on his lap, the throne room doors opened with one of his men telling him his guest had arrived. The king nodded as he snapped his finger's for one of his servants to bring warm water and a cloth for them to clean them selves. chuckling when he saw the prince get red as a tomato at being seen by his people in such a shameful state.
Oh how he’d make Thor know who belonged by his Master’s side.
————————————————————-
Tony noticed the blond's small action and smiled meaningfully at them. "I decided to let him sleep the night and maybe get him to a vet tomorrow..get him checked out and see what i can do.." Tony said as he opened his door. "Oh! Nat's vet is amazing... really knows his stuff..if you want you can take him there!" Clint suggested as he gently ushered Natasha inside his door. "Great! I'll ask for the address tomorrow.." Tony beamed as he went inside his apartment.
“Peggy? Yeah...right now? S-sure..sure...I’ll be there...no problem, anything for you doll..” Steve grinned as he glanced down at Tony who didn’t look up at him at hearing the other’s name. Once Steve had pressed end call and pocketed his phone away he quickly pressed a kiss on Tony’s cheek as he hurriedly run to the door, telling Tony he’d be back late and that he shouldn’t wait up for him. He didn’t even care to tell him why, and Tony didn’t think he wanted to know. As the door closed behind Steve, Tony slumped down his chair. Heart feeling like it would break into a million pieces at his brother’s absence.
Accepting yet another local dish Tony moaned unconsciously as Steve hand fed him the piece of grilled meat that tasted of spices Tony wasn’t familiar with. “Do you like it?” Steve asked with a hint of fondness in his eyes, his smile brilliant and wide making him look youthful and charming, Tony swore his heart fluttered at the sight making him blush a bit. It was that face that had won him over two years ago when he had first met the man. The blush he wore seemed to get a positive reaction from the king as Steve leaned forward to catch his lips, taking away the princes breath as they both lingered on the kiss before breaking apart.
The two didn’t stop not even for air, Steve only gasping in shock when he realized that Tony’s hand had started traveling down his thighs. “T-Tony?” Was all the omega could manage as he stared lustfully at the blushing alpha. Confusion on his face as Tony had never been this brave before.
Steve forrowed his brows for a bit before realizing what the other meant. “Oh yeah…yeah…” he stupidly laughed as he started to undress right away. Not realizing how massive he looked without his shirt on.
———————————————————
Steve, Steve, Steve...was all his mind could think of as he continued to press against the other, crap..he couldn’t even kiss someone else even with alcohol in his system as the only thought that was running through his mind at the moment was a certain blond. The kiss he had shared right now wasn’t what he had expected it to be. Kissing Bucky, felt like he was kissing a brother..but it was nothing at all like Kissing Steve, who was his actual brother. Which was just god damn so confusing really, How fucked up was he if finally kissing someone who wasn’t actually related to him hadn’t had the same effect as kissing his own flesh and blood. Oh how he wanted the world to devour him right then and there.
Once breakfast was over and Steve had assured Tony that he was full and absolutely happy Tony decided to check his phone and see if Clint had texted him the Vet’s address. And right on time the blond did, smiling happily Tony ushered Steve back to his room and helped him find something to wear. Luckily Tony still had a few of his old college shirts laying around and decided to give those to Steve. They were still a tiny bit big on the hybrid but it was better than nothing. The baggy pants however looked a bit off making the brunette think it be best to buy the blond a pair of pants that actually fitted him. Once the two had dressed and made their way through the city Tony quickly sensed Steve go a bit stiff as they both walked inside the bright green building. “Hey..hey..don’t worry, I won’t let anyone hurt you...i just want to know if everything is alright with you..this guy is going to help you alright?” Tony reassures the trembling hybrid before squeezing his hand. Steve merely stared at him but squeezed back as well. Tony smiled at that and went ahead to ring the counters bell. After a few seconds a smiling man came into view wearing a white coat. “Good morning what can i do for you today?” He asked politely even though it was pretty obvious with how small Steve was that there was a problem that needed to be checked with. Tony nudge at Steve’s direction before answering, “um yeah...i found this adorable little guy last night In an alley behind some trash...i brought him home and decided to see what i could do to help him..” he finished with a shrug while the other man nodded. “Well okay...we can take him at the back and take some test and see what we can do for him..oh I’m The vet by the way..names Bruce Banner” the man said with a smile while walking them into the backroom. “Tony Stark..” the brunette smiled back as he lead Steve in with him. “I’m a friend of Clint..uh..blond guy has a red haired Hybrid named..” “ ah..Natasha!” Bruce beamed in acknowledgment. Tony nodded as he felt Steve squeeze his arm. “Alright! So I’m just gonna do a few test on you and everything will be alright..okay buddy?” Bruce asked as he patted a plastic chair for Steve to sit on.
Thank you so much for your wonderful reviews and patience foe me to update my stories! Your comments always make me want to write and post faster! Please enjoy this update and hope to hear what you guys think
God was Tony cute. Steve just wanted to go on over his side of the table and hug him so tight till all the uncontrollable feelings had left him. But no, he was going to play it cool. Tony was here because he thought Steve was helping him with Bucky. That’s why he was sparkling like a cute twinkling star right now in front of Steve, he was thinking about Bucky. Right..Tony had a crush on Bucky.
Thank you for taking the time to read this little fic of mine..i hope you liked this chap..
“Ugh...r-right...i guess I really do need to go home..” Sunset groaned as she stood up with an angry frown. Sharon had waved her goodbye before looking back at Steve who was too busy staring at a blushing Tony. A vain had appeared on her forehead at that before clearing her throat to get the blond’s attention. “So have you two ordered yet? The place is really jammed pack but since Peggy’s boyfriend works here we can ask him to take your order, He’ll give it to ya faster since your with me!” Sharon offered. “Thanks Shar...i know i could always count on you...” Steve winked as he thank her. She beamed at that before calling Daniel who instantly came near them. When Steve and Tony had finished giving their orders Sharon had lean against Steve again. “So Steve...i was wondering if you could help me out with physics this weekend I’m kinda having trouble..” Sharon asked cutely as she twirled her hair. “Oh! You should let Tony help you out...he’s actually pretty smart..” Steve offered making Sharon frown at him. “Oh you know what? Never mind i think Sam can help me instead..”She said with a sigh.
I know it’s a bit short but i promise to update soon to make up for it..and hey i updated this a day after the last update so yey...Hope you enjoy
ditasitepu35 Asked ‘since cat hybrid is a human form, is there a possibility that the hybrid could live iindependently without an owner?’
Tears trailed down the smaller man's face as he tried to burry his face into the large chest that belonged to the one responsible for destroying his whole Kingdome. "They were so eager to dispose of you..to trade you...your own father doesn't deserve you...but don't worry my love..i wont ever let anyone treat you like that again.."Steve assured a shivering Tony and held him tight. "You will be my queen..i will take care of you...that i promise" he breath as he stroked the Prince's ruffled hair. Tony turned his head to face him. Dried blood covered his left cheek. "You are absolutely beautiful" he smiled and leaned down to kiss trembling lips, Tony inhaled as he felt Steve's lips on his. a small whine escaped him when he felt the Kings wet tongue play at his bottom lips, biting and licking him now. he shivered but slowly opened his mouth to allow Steve's tongue access. he moaned when the other didn't hesitate to explore his mouth. he received a tight squeeze in his ass and moaned louder. The kiss went on for a while before Steve pulled away, a trail of saliva connected to both their mouths. Steve smiled triumphantly as he held his new queen tight and held his free hand up to signal his men to finally return home.

Placing the broken cup at the counter Tony wince at the burn on his hands. Steadily walking to the faucet and letting the water run down his hands. Steve was at his side mewling sadly as he nuzzled close to Tony. Thor had appeared as well with a worried expression. Once Tony felt his hands didn’t hurt as much anymore he ordered Steve to show him his hands. The hybrid obeyed as he placed both his hands in front of the brunette. Red as can be but the blond showed no signs that he was in pain like Tony was. “Steve you should really be more careful with the cups next time...awww it was my favorite too..” Tony morned as he stared at Steve with a serious look. Steve whined as he pressed his head against Tony even more, feeling absolutely guilty as he glanced at the broken cup and his master’s hand. Tony inhaled sharply as his expression turn softer. “It’s okay Steve we all make mistakes..come on let’s put some cream on our hands...Thor you can go back and watch the show some more we’ll be okay here” Tony smiled at the other who nodded obediently at him before walking back in to the living room. Once he was gone Tony quickly glanced at Steve as he opened a drawer containing the cream he was saying. “Steve...i know you don’t like to share me that much but you really have to work with your temper okay?.. Thor really needs help right now and if you’d just give him a chance I’m sure you’ll like him as much as i do..” Tony said with a soft smile as he rubbed the cream against his and Steve’s hands. The hybrid nodded before giving Tony a small lick on his cheek. “That’s my boy...”Tony chuckled, fighting off a blush as he put the cream back and escorting the hybrid back to the living room.
When Thor had finally released Tony, the engineer coughed before smiling widely as he said with a fond look that they were going to have a swell time together. Steve staring annoyingly at him as he grabbed the other hybrids arm and lead him to their kitchen. He didn’t Think he was going to have a swell time..
“Please Steve...she’s my best friend...she’s the only one lift of what i had now” he begged as tears started to leave his eyes. Steve snarled at that “ All the more better for me to finish her off! “ he said as he yanked her through the carpeted floor, Pepper Screaming in pain as he did. “You will have no one else but me Tony..no one!”
Tony only remembering them when Steve had gripped his face and made him turn to look at Loki who was also forced by Thor to turn towards him. The two moaning lustfully as strong arms griped them both on their sides, thrusting up inside them with so much force that the two cried out in unison. The two blushed fiercely as they stared with lust filled eyes at each other. both moaned with their tongues stuck out as their lovers ordered them to give them a bit of a show. Tony redden even more when Loki had leaned close to him, tongue hanging out. Teasing him a bit as it played with the tip of his own tongue. “God! Loki, you certainly know how to make a man want you more..” Thor breathed as he bucked his hips up more. Making the dark haired lover moan as he twirled his tongue around the brunette’s, giving the two blond’s a show they’d never forget. Steve groan with desire in his eyes as he watched his bride’s tongue dart out and play with another’s. Fuck Tony could be so slutty when Steve wanted him to be.
“Tony? You okay?” Clint asked one day when Tony had stumbled into the kitchen looking absolutely drowsy and red. “Y-yeah...just..ugh, heat’s starting..” Tony answered as he tried to get to the coffee machine. A frown had form at the blond’s face. “I don’t think coffee is good for you..here, have some water instead..” Clint offered as he got up and handed Tony a cool glass of water. Tony gratefully took the glass and gulped it down, face looking absolutely flush as he said his thanks. “Where’s Steve? Shouldn’t he be helping you?” Clint furrowed his brows as he tried to ignore Tony’s delicious smell. “ he’s at SHIELD’s helping Bucky out with a few things...it’s alright, Bucky probably really needs him right now..” Tony assured with a tired smile. The answer didn’t seem to set well with the blond though as he quickly snarled at the idea of Steve being with another omega when Tony was in heat. “What? Tony...You need Steve Right now! He should be here with you!” Clint snapped as he tried to reach for his phone that was laying on the kitchen counter. “God! He doesn’t even know his omega’s own heat cycle?!” A growl vibrated through his throat as he started dialing on his phone, only for it to be snatched away from him. With a confused look Clint turned to look at the flushed out omega. “Clint, sweety..i get your upset, and i wanna thank you but It’s alright, I don’t wanna stress Steve anymore than he is right now..and I can understand if he feels that he needs to be with Bucky, they were best friends and even had a thing back then..honestly if i was in Bucky’s shoes as well, i would want and need Steve by my side too..” Tony breathed making Clint groan. “God Tony! Don’t you ever think that there might be something going on between them? For Christ sake there was a thing between them back before Bucky fell in the ice! You should at least feel I don’t know...jealous...agitated or something..it’s not normal!” Clint exclaimed as he stared in disbelief at the sweating omega, fuck Tony smelled so good.
Oh God….
Breakfast was a whirlwind, as soon as Steve had started making pancakes and delicious sunny side up eggs. He had kept on asking Tony to come and taste them, deliberately placing his fingers on the mixing bowl and sticking it in a very surprised but very pleased brunette. “ you know you shouldn’t let me taste the batter Steve...i might just end up eating all that instead” Tony mused with a mischievous smile as he tried to get more. Steve had made sure Thor was at the table watching them, a fond smile had appeared on the other hybrids face before it fell and was replaced with unreadable expression. Good! It seemed as though Steve had gotten his point across. But just to make it even clearer Steve leaned down to lick a smudged of pancake batter on the brunette’s chin. Tony blushing immediately and stuttering a ‘i should go to the bathroom’. Making Steve smile as he sniffed the air that smelled of arousal from the brunette. Well if that wasn’t considered a win he didn’t know what was.
“Steve it will only be for one day...now come on, you guys always have fun here..” Tony said soothingly as Steve clung to him. Big strong arms not letting go of the brunette. Tony tried to hide his smile as he really needed to go now, Clint and the rest of the gang were already waiting outside with Rhodey’s car honking at him for the third time.
“Wow! A royal hybrid, never thought I’d live to see the day I’d see one up close..i mean these guy’s are rare! That’s why they cost thousands-or even millions!” Clint gaped as he petted the blond hybrid. Nat staring with amazement as well as she cuddled next to Bucky who was busy grooming her. “Yeah...i saw him
“Steve how many times do i have to tell you? You can’t just start stripping Tony on the floor whenever you feel like it around the house” Joseph’s stern voice echoed around the room from the speaker placed on the walls. Steve immediately snapped his head up to look around the living room. “You installed cctv’s around the house?” Steve asked with furrowed brows while still hovering over Tony who was already panting, half undress beneath his scrawny body. “Yes! And for good reasons too...now, get off your alpha and stop being such an impatient omega! You’ll both have your time soon..right now i do NOT want you two going any further than kissing..why in my day...” Steve had already stood up as he tried to block his father’s yammering while trying to help his alpha off the floor. He really didn’t want to listen to his father’s preaches when he knew exactly how his mom (that’s also an omega) had seduced his father into mating with her at 17. No use in telling his old man that though..
Steve watched with sad eyes as he watched Tony beam while he started asking question after question about the other blond. Eyes sparkling with glee as Thor excitedly shared his luxurious stories with the engineer. Steve never had 6 doctors taking care of him when he was ill, he had never went to Paris or Korea to have photo shoots and star in T.V commercials for hybrid vitamins when he was a tiny kitten hybrid. And he didn’t get gawked at for having royal hybrid blood in his veins...no he didn’t have all that.
War...it was war that separated Steve from Tony again. It seemed one of Steve’s neighboring allies was going to be invaded and had requested for the Hydra king’s help. Steve right away mounted on his horse as he lead his men to the battlefield. He had made love to Tony the night before his departure. Telling his trusted advisor Sam to look after Tony while he and his general were away.
Eventually Peter had relaxed. He’d only known the man for three weeks but he could tell that Steve really was a good guy. And never quiestioned him on it again.
Steve smiled brightly as he stared at the home made vanilla frosted birthday cake Clint had bought him, it had been a whole year since Tony had found him that faithful night and so the brunette had marked that night as Steve’s birthday since he didn’t really know when Steve’s birthday was. “Come on Steve, blow out the candles!” A red head named Pepper laughed as she got her camera to take a picture of the smiling hybrid. Tony laughed as well as he helped Steve blow all the candles in the cake. Making Natasha pucker her lips as she secretly wanted to blow the candles too. Once all the candles were out everyone clapped and cheered as Steve’s ears twitched with excitement. Tony had pulled all the stops into giving him a wonderful party. Hiring a catering Service and inviting Steve’s hybrid friends that they’ve met along the year. Bucky and Sam sat next to his right while Natasha sat on the other side. He had met the two Hybrids five months ago when Him and Tony had went to the park, the two had followed him around when he had gotten lost from the brunette and helped him find the worried owner. Their owner Sharon sat next to Clint who was busy blowing up more balloons for them. Rhodey one of Tony’s friends and co-worker had even wore a cat mascot for the celebration.
Tony’s eyes snapped open at hearing the elevator door open. Steve Rogers had suddenly appeared wearing his famous captain america smile, holding a box of donuts on one hand and coffee on the other. The scene in front of him was enough to make the billioner genius lose his voice for a bit.
Before he could wonder any further Steve had captured the demons lips, and wow..they were so soft. So kissable that Steve couldn’t help but lean closer, large hands instantly pinning smaller ones as he pressed the tiny demon on his back. Loving how submissive Tony was being as the tiny demon didn’t even try to pry his arms away from him. Instead letting Steve hover above him as the human started placing kisses on his neck. A shiver ran down the blond’s body as he couldn’t believe how delicious Tony’s skin was. It was like sucking a  lollipop. So smooth and sweet that Steve hadn’t realized that he had managed to bruise the whimpering demons skin. Had he been sucking that hard at Tony’s neck?
“You guys...you really don’t have to do this...I’ll be fine on my own really-oh! Dear God Loki...please do that again..” Tony moaned when the dark haired Asgardian had suddenly pinched one of his nipples from behind him. Oh it felt so good. The wonderful sensation was enough to lessen the agonizing pain he was feeling around that area. Thor had smiled at that as he threw two more pillows into the nest while Sam and Clint had finally finished arranging everything.
Tony beamed at that. “ really? Okay...I’ll see you tomorrow then..” he said with a small smile as he gave Steve a wave. The tall blond nodded at that as he turned around to finally walk away from the shorter teen. Tony smiled gleefully as he clapped both his hands together. Wow, he really had to give The taller teen props. Steve was more dedicated in this than he thought. With a wide smile Tony rash inside his house, eager to hear all about the senior brunette tomorrow. Unaware that the blond had glanced back at him with an also gleeful look on his face.
Tony gave a small pout at that making the redhead chuckle and agree. “Oh, alright…” as she headed towards one of Tony’s chairs. “Anyways i better go…i need to be up at 5am for my morning jog…just happy to help out here…see ya Tony…” Steve smiled before glancing at Pepper with a smirk. “See you Pep..”
