The rain continued to pour from the sky. For once, Dean didn’t care about the rain water seeping through his boots and soaking his socks. He was finally living in the moment, and the moment was liberating.
Dean attempted to cram the two young brothers into the front passenger seat. They almost fit together side by side, but the taller of the brothers had to sacrifice some leg space. With everyone safe, Dean allowed himself to close his eyes for a moment before taking the wheel and starting the Impala. A let a breath out and glanced in the rearview mirror. Castiel's eyes met his, and even Dean could see that the angel was scared.
Dean shook his head in disbelief. The hunter knew how important Castiel’s wings were to him, to his self image; he’d seen what could happen if Cas lost them. How could he just ‘give them up’?
It turned out that Sam was almost right; had Dean been anyone else, he would’ve been completely correct. The thing Dean had been so excited to show Cas was his bedroom, which was oddly clean. The angel did care; he was proud of Dean, and happy that the hunter was finally proud of himself without any hidden loathing or guilt.
The hunter swallowed the words he wanted to say. He figured the reunion would have to wait; Sam's impact had been worse than Dean thought. "Yeah, that's um, that's great Cas. Good thinking."
Cas wasn’t sure what this could mean. He felt fear and excitement at the same time; anticipation, he realized. Finally, Dean opened the door.
What really caught Castiel’s eye, however, was an old radio with two tapes atop it. The angel walked closer so he could see what they were. One was strangely unlabeled, and the other he quickly recognized as the Led Zeppelin mixtape Dean had given him. Cas smiled, tears pricking at his eyes. Joyful tears were something he used to see as so strange, but in this moment (and a few others) he understood them. He finally felt that he was wanted.
He wasn't supposed to be here, and damn, Dean was more than glad he was back, but part of him wished Cas had also stayed away. There was so much to think about now, so much that he thought he had packed neatly away after the night that Castiel was taken by The Empty.
He didn’t need to sleep, and though he wanted to try, he couldn’t do it. His mind was drawn to his recent talks with Dean; he analyzed them over and over. He didn’t find anything he hadn’t seen or known before. Dean had seemed a bit nervous to show Cas his new room, but he had good enough reason to believe Dean was just worried the angel wouldn’t like it; perhaps worried that he’d even say he wasn’t staying.
Cas stared at Dean, reading him like a book. “My apologies,” he said as he turned towards the window instead, “You’re not ready to talk about this yet.”
Dean crouched down next to his brother, slipping one of his limp arms over his shoulder. Wordlessly, Castiel did the same with Sam's other arm. The two of them matched pace and dragged a graced-up Sam back to the Impala.
It was a functionality of prayers that only angels knew existed. The specific frequency of a soul that left an almost physical feeling for an angel to identify. A fuzzy feeling in their mind; as though the soul was saying its own name.
Well, in all honesty, it wasn't truly packed away then either. Maybe it was after they killed Chuck? That's when Dean, full of naïve hope, thought he could stop thinking about everything. He thought, he hoped, it would all be better. It was all the same, but at least he knew no deity was constantly pulling his strings and writing his lines.
Dean’s sharp inhale and heavy exhale could be heard on the recording. ‘I’m so lost, Cas. I’m worried you really won’t come back this time. But, in case you do, I really wanted you to have this. ‘Cause I know I’ll never be ready to say it to your face. And you deserve to hear it, to hear all of this. Cas, you deserve so much.’
Checking Sam into the hospital was easy, routine almost, but waiting was always difficult. It seemed even worse now, however, as Dean was sitting next to a certain angel. His worry for Sam was being completely drowned out by the thousands of questions and words whirling around his brain. How was he here?
“Thank you, Sam. I planned on being here as long as I can. I don’t want to lose this again.” Castiel had spent his time between Heaven and Earth for too long. He couldn’t lose his family again, so he’d stay with them until he couldn’t anymore.
Dean had never reciprocated his feelings, he’d planned on doing the same thing. His place was on Earth, in a secret bunker in Kansas.
Castiel had remembered the room as mostly empty. It had only contained a bed and a nightstand with a lamp on top; he didn’t have many possessions after all. Now, the room was so drastically different. It looked as though someone could actually live there.
"Dean, I meant every word. I would never lie to you, not like that. I've seen your soul, rebuilt the good and bad parts of it, and I still love you."
"Yes." I sighed. "You and Dean have feelings for each other. Talk to each other about them. You don't have to do it right now, just please. Soon."
I had a big speech ready, full of firm yet understanding sentences. Carefully thought out and written down and practised with Jody last night but it all went out of the window instantly.
"He's the boring Uncle." Dean butted in just as Cas was about to speak. "We're the cool dads, aren't we Cas?" Dean reached and squeezed Cas' hand.
Dean stopped answering after I while, I heard a few snores coming from his sofa so I answered Jack's questions for him.
It was only a few weeks after Sam was weird at breakfast that he was being weird again, maybe it was shock. But he'd never acted like that when he was shocked before. Honestly the guy was confusing the Hell out of me. He'd been being weird in small doses like when he asked me why me and Cas were spending so much time together recently and I was just super confused because why would I not want to spend time with my boyfriend?
We met Sam and Cas at the counter, them carrying all the healthy food whilst me and Jack had the cheetos, jerky and beer.
Cas would find it hard to argue us both and might actually consider our points if it wasn't just me 'mothering him'.
Ah maybe that was it. He was annoyed I'd called him boring. It didn't explain the last few weeks but right now I'd take it.
"Not bad." I sighed, I knew I was probably overreacting to the cut but Cas always ended up getting the short end of the stick so the least I could do was coddle him. "No doubt he'll be a baby about it." I passed him the keys, pulling Cas back over so I had a good grip of his hands and a good amount of pressure on the cut.
Even though he had stopped himself short, Castiel smiled softly at Dean’s sudden openness. It felt amazing, like a new trust was between them. “No, Dean, I would wait the rest of eternity if I had to.”
“It’s just nice to reflect, Dean, to appreciate what I have,” Castiel said as though he knew what Dean was thinking. The hunter was at a loss for words; he attempted to see the forest the same way Cas did. “The Empty, it was… I would much prefer going through Purgatory again to being there.”
‘I messed up, like I always do. And the worst part is it wasn’t even Billie, it was Chuck. The only person you died to save was me. You were right, all those years ago, I don’t think I’m worth saving. I’m not sure I’ll ever think otherwise. I’m still- y’know, processing it all. You know more than anyone else how long it takes me. I mean- hell!” there was that broken laughter again.
“It was a gift… I wanted to make sure you still had it,” Dean said so softly that Castiel wasn’t sure he would’ve heard it had he not been a celestial being. The angel turned and quickly embraced Dean. The hunter flinched, but returned the hug.
"I thought you were gone," He said quietly. He didn't need to speak up, Castiel could hear him, even if he hadn't said it aloud at all.
Castiel also wasn’t sure if he dared to go into the kitchen. He understood the recording, but was still unsure of what to do with its information. Nevertheless, he pushed himself past these feelings and towards the kitchen. He had intended to start fresh, be around more often, and that certainly meant no hiding.
Castiel spotted something in the corner of the room, something which he had never seen in the bunker before. “You.. have a dog?” It was the only logical explanation for the chew toy and the box of milk bones. Well, he’d thought of another explanation, but he was really hoping Dean
“Dean, there is nothing you can do that I won’t be able to forgive you for. It was my choice to go. I never thought I could be happy; I didn’t have anyone like you and Sam did.”
Castiel wasn’t surprised to find that it was Dean making coffee. In a way, caffeine was one of his many vices.
I’ll lose who I am. I don’t want to be who I was before I knew you. You anchor me- I need you here, not in Heaven looking down at me. I love you, Castiel. I love every moment with you. Please, don’t go back to Heaven.”
They had a few beers and wrapped the evening up. Dean, uncharacteristically, was the first to throw in the towel and head to bed for the night. This left Castiel to do the cleaning up, which he didn’t mind, especially because Sam tried to help wherever he could.
There was a dresser topped with photos Cas hadn’t even known existed, as well as a bookshelf filled with World Atlases and whatever books Dean could find around the bunker that he thought Cas might have read. The room was mainly lit by fairy lights; Castiel had always been curious about them and why they were called that; he still didn’t know why.
Dean looked shocked; he had been sure Cas couldn't come back this time. Castiel misinterpreted his shock rather easily. "Oh. Sam he's... well he'll be alright. It's just angelic anesthesia."
The rest of the car ride was filled with music and small conversation. It was bliss to both of them; an improvement. When Sam had come back it felt even better. The brothers bickered a bit, and Dean (badly) sang along to his cassettes. Even if Castiel was mostly quiet, everything felt right, like no time had been lost between the family at all.
"Shit," Dean murmured. With seeing Cas again and worrying about Sammy's health, he had forgotten about the kids. Dean stopped supporting Sam so that he could approach the kids and talk to them more one-on-one. He figured that would be much more reassuring than him and a mysterious angel approaching the young boys. As Dean left his side, Castiel stopped to better support Sam's weight.
Dean left the emergency room, Cas trailing behind him. They stayed in a motel for those few days, and the first few hours of the first day was extremely awkward. As far as Dean knew, Cas didn't need to sleep, but he still got a room with two beds anyway. The emotional distance between them became physical as well.
“Dean,” the angel said as they drove toward the hospital. Sam had finally been declared well enough to finish recovery at the bunker, so they were on their way to pick him up.
Miracle then turned and went up to Cas; the angel took a step back. Castiel didn’t mind dogs, he liked all creations, but dogs typically didn’t like him back. They were created to be the best friends of humans; something in their wiring was a bit aggressive towards the supernatural. It was as though they instinctively knew what was dangerous to humans; specifically their humans.
There were no further questions after that; not questions that Dean dared to really ask. The only questions that were left were the questions the hunter had for himself. He never did really know himself. The real Dean was always tucked away, hidden, somewhere within the fake Dean.
Dean kissed Castiel, gripping his shoulders as though the angel might suddenly change his mind and fly away. Cas held onto Dean’s hips, letting him know that he wouldn’t be changing his mind. He was there for Dean, and Dean was there for him.
Castiel laughed to himself, watching Dean start over in the breakfast-making process. Now the hunter was certainly annoyed.
“But you don’t know all of it,” Dean took a deep breath, “Cas, you’ve got me whenever you need me. I don’t care if it’s important or not because if you want it then it’s important to me. You bring out the best in me, man. You wake me up, make me reconnect with my humanity. Nobody’s ever done that for me before. That’s why I need you Cas. When you’re gone I’m so
“Hey, I know I already said it, but I’m really glad you're back, man. And thanks for saving our asses; with Dean I was really worried that.. Well, I’m sure you know,” Sam said, too afraid to say the thought aloud. Castiel nodded in understanding. Sam awkwardly cleared his throat, “Um- anyway, I hope that you stay with us. This is our home, and Cas, you’re family. And I know Dean would say so too.”
Dean felt like he could hardly breathe, but in the good way. Finally there would be someone who truly knew him, someone to talk to, someone who would be there every step of the way. He was so much more than grateful; his heart was practically beating out of his chest.
Castiel's head tilted to the side in both confusion and concern. It was a look that was extremely familiar. Dean had to turn away.
"In some ways, I do." He said vaguely. He didn't want to die exactly, but he was ready for something new. He was ready to take whatever years of rebelling and fighting for love had truly earned him, even if it was death. He was ready to let go, ready to finally accept his truth, and he would do it all over for Dean.
“And you thought you could never say this to my face,” Cas commented with a small chuckle that Dean echoed. “I’ve loved you since I first saw your soul. I’m not going anywhere, I promise. Besides-” There was a crack of thunder, cool rain began to pour from the sky. Dean blinked and almost missed seeing Castiel’s wings. The angel held his hand out, letting raindrops collect in his palm. He grinned. “This is temporary.”
Once again, Dean was leading the angel down the hall. They stopped in front of a room which Cas knew as his own; at least, it had been once. Castiel’s head tilted to the side in confusion.
Dean nodded. “You’re right. To be honest, I feel like a total ass making you wait up for me all the time. It’s just- I don’t know yet. How… how I feel about it all, I mean. You dying and coming back and the-” he briefly squeezed his eyes shut and sighed, “yeah.”
The boys opened the door. Dean and Cas moved forward; they attempted to fit Sam into the back seat. It felt like it took forever, but eventually Sam was laying across the back seat; seat belts were pulled over him where they could be.
Dean looked amused, finding the situation so odd it was almost funny. Then he remembered that he spoke dog once too, and cringed at the thought.
“Coffee and PB n’ J. Trust me, I know.” Dean would never forget eating only those two things for an entire week when he was attempting to teach a human Castile how to cook literally anything else. “I’ll help, it’ll be fine,” Dean assured, “Bacon ‘s in the fridge.”
Dean approached the noise quickly, and his heart felt as though it had stopped just as quickly. Sam was propped up against the barn wall, a few broken crates around him. Sam's eyes were open, and he was grinning as though nothing had happened.
The two boys they'd been trying to save looked at them with wide eyes. How had they not seen this trench coated man enter the barn? And, on top of that, Sam looked slightly terrifying.
Dean was confused. Of course he could see the resemblance to Purgatory, it was a forest after all, but he didn’t exactly understand how that made Cas feel calm here. Unlike the angel, he was never one for small details.
Castiel followed Sam to his room; he was worried the tall man would fall or suddenly forget how to use his crutches. When they got to the room, Sam stopped and leaned his weight onto the door.
"Honestly I think it's damaging a hunters livelihood." I explained to Jody who laughed at me. "No, I'm serious. Whenever you need to give someone under the age of thirty 'the talk' they think you're the crazy one because you're saying that vampires look like every day people and if they bite you you'll be fine just don't drink their blood. They look at me like I have three heads." I sighed.
"I honestly thought you knew, I mean you're always calling Cas my boyfriend and he technically is so- I mean it't not like we were subtle."
Dean was chatting with Jody about how badly the media portrays vamps and he was sick of having to explain to people. Cas was reading something from Dean's phone and then leaning down and checking something on his own with a confused expression.
"I thought you knew about us?" Cas asked, not a smile on his face but that's fine because I was still grinning for the both of us.
"I wouldn't say we were together, just messing around at that point." Dean waggled his eyebrows at Cas who rolled his eyes.
There was even a time that me and Cas were just going to go on a beer run but Sam had annoyed me so much I turned it into a date night.
"Well, that clears that up. Well done on talking about your feelings even if I am a few years late." Jody chuckled giving them both a smile.
Cas was still passed out the entire way back to the motel and once Dean very gently placed him on a bed once we got in.
"He's the boring Uncle." I said quickly. "We're the cool dads, aren't we Cas?" I reached down and squeezed his hand, he started leaning into me heavily. Maybe this was a bad idea for us to come out. He was clearly still not up to it.
Cas was getting tired of me too, he even tried sleeping in his own room after the fourth night. I'd apologised and promised that we'd go out and stretch our legs the next day. Cas had told me I was a dick but we slept in his room that night.
I sighed and cleaned the cut and began the stitching, keeping a careful eye on signs he was waking up, he was breathing deeply and steadily, his body warm but not too warm. All good signs. Until he suddenly woke up and jolted away almost making me pull all the stitches at once.
I kept seeing Sam looking back at us through the mirror, that annoyed and weird look on his face. It was starting to piss me off. If he had a problem he just needed to say it. He'd never said anything before. I focused on getting Cas into the motel and lay down without waking him up.
I saw Cas looking confused, bored and annoyed. The perfect recipe for him saying something that made us look like psychos.
Had we run into a witch that had put some kind of truth spell on them or something that I didn't know about?
Angel of the Lord Castiel. The most rebellious warrior of Heaven. One of the most powerful creatures ever made. Having a freaking cuddle whilst watching shitty movies.
"Yeah?" I asked. Maybe he actually wasn't okay after his run, he had a weird look about him. "You seen Jack around yet? Think he might appreciate our warrior food." I winked at Cas.
Finally he looked down at Cas and freaking smiled, pulling the blanket from behind the sofa and wrapping it around Cas, turning his attention back to the movie and answering Jack's endless questions.
"Well, that clears that up. Well done on talking about your feelings even if I am a few years late." Jody laughed and grinned at us both.
"But-what about all the strippers, waitresses?" Sam stumbled over his words, his eyebrows mushed together.
"I thought you knew about us?" Cas looked more confused than I'd ever seen him and I've seen him in some serious states of confusion.
"Jack's asking if we can have a feast like that?" Sam nodded to the movie that was on the big feast scene, Jack looked like he was about to start begging.
I was trying to shrug it off but I was starting to feel guilty. We'd never had a chick flick moment about me and Cas being together maybe he was annoyed about that? But he could of mentioned that years ago.
Dean had been acting strange for a while now, but specifically he was acting really strange around Cas. Stranger than normal for both of them.
Cas rolled his eyes and handed the woman some money with his free hand. "We won't let him drink the alcohol." He sounded like he was trying to be funny but that was his annoyed and in pain voice, we needed to go.
The movie was the first Harry Potter film, Dean and I had seen it plenty of times but it was Jack and Cas first times.
The witch that Cas was holding was struggling and kicking against Cas' grip, moving her head around non stop so neither of us could get a clear shot.
grace." Cas scowled up at me, still trying to move his wrists, the fact that he could barely put up a good fight against me just proved my point on why he shouldn't use his grace to heal himself. I put the slightest pressure on the cut with his bundled up shirt and his frown deepened at me.
They'd been bickering about it all day and I just wanted them to shut up already. It was Tuesday so it was movie night.
I wanted to kiss him so damn bad but he'd kill me if I did in this crowded of a place, I wrote more filthy things in enochian on his knee. He swallowed as he stared back into my eyes but then turned away quickly, way too quickly for my liking.
Cas pouted when he walked in, dressed in Deans pj's as he usually did when he was running low on grace, and he sat himself on one end of the sofa.
He's moved from his end of the sofa and was now in the middle, head back and snoring, Cas' head was in his lap and Dean's hand was resting on Cas' chest as they both slept.
"I thought you were both in denial. Oh my God, why didn't you just tell me?" Sam had his head in his hands.
This had to stop. Cas had to be aware this wasn't normal 'best friend' behaviour because if he didn't then surely he would be the same with me. But he never did anything like it with me or anyone else. So he had to know. Dean definitely knew this wasn't normal best friend behaviour.
Cas shrugged. "I don't know. He just asked me if we were a couple like in movies. He said Sam was talking about it."
To my surprise Dean started laughing, like really belly laughing. Tears in his eyes and everything. The whole nine yards.
Cas rolled his eyes and handed the clerk some money with his free hand. "We won't let him drink the alcohol."
« Because all this is scaring me. Because I’m straight and he’s a man and I’m talking to you as I do with anybody else, except with him » he straightened and starting to pace in the room. « I’m completely lost »
"I was starving ... you Brontosaurus ", he stood up. "I'm off ... I 'm exhausted and it’s my turn to drive the children to school tomorrow " he stretched his arms.
"Before he had paradise and his feathered ass-brothers-hole, the question didn't even need to be and then I remind you that it was YOUR idea, not mine," Dean defends himself.
« Sorry » Balty started to laugh. « Dean » he regained his composure and faced him. « Deanie » he forced him to look at him. « Do you know what the most erotic thing is to turn each other on between two guys who are in love ? »
" That is your answer? "Dean spits out as he gets up, almost knocking his chair over. "I'm telling you that you're everything to me and all you have to answer is this piece of crap," Dean says, raising his voice.
« You wanna drink one last beer afterwards? » He proposed, feeling somehow relieved after the discussion they had earlier.
« I see » she finally said. « I was the ultimate test, wasn’t I ? » she ironically said, pulling down her skirt.
« Yeah, I know, but it’s not the same. It’s probably due to some echo of my old-fashion education» he tried to laugh about it yet he felt uncomfortable somehow.
She raised her eyes when she heard footsteps in the stairs. Jewel was observing her through the balusters.
They gathered in front of the television for the sacred « Dean Friday evening ». The channel was broadcasting old movies... Most of them were rather cheesy.
« Please, don’t start again with this » Dean warned. « Damn draught... I didn’t end up half naked outside by choice or for pleasure, OK ? » he moved towards the cooker.
« I thought I could invite her for dinner next Saturday... So that… so that you can all meet her» Dean finally said, manipulating his cup, feeling nervous.
« No... That guy, as you put it, saved me. This family saved me. I’m happy, Zeke, are you able to understand that word ? I certainly am. Life hasn’t always been kind to us but we are coping with it all every single day. As an ordinary family. Yeah, I know, it’s so pathetic to love a man who’ll never love me in return, but you know what? I don’t care..»
Lisa had no idea about the reason why and she ended up believing it was just because Dean was living with a homosexual. Yet when speaking of Castiel with his employees at the garage, the tone of his voice was absolutely normal.
She refused to disclose the content of it to Castiel and she had even threatened one of her school mates who was about to uncover the mystery at the school gate.
Meg and John had proposed to take the kids to the movies so he saw the perfect opportunity to escape from his house ; whatever, the shadows were following him until here…
Besides, how did he end up building this tent that refused to cooperate, despite the powerful hammer blows and all the insults he could think of ?
First of all, I would like to thank you for your patience., as i promised you, here is the next chapter of this story.
He had spent the early evening trying not to get a wedgie. It got on his nerves until the moment he decided to go home and change. He came back dressed as Steve Rodgers, with a shield hanging on his back.
« When he called me earlier this week and told me about this little… gathering and a revelation, I thought… » He felt uncomfortable.
Dean scowled; he didn’t like this demonstration of tenderness which Balty was crazy about, always needing to touch the target of his affection .
We looked to each other for a long time like always except that this time, i was fully aware of what was going on. You know me: " Courage. Let's run" is my motto when feelings come to screw up the mess in my head.
"Precisely" Dean slips one hand on the nape of his neck. "It's better like that" He strokes his jaw with his thumb and Castiel melts in the touch.
"I'm asking you to be the Cass I've always known... We've both been through a lot... We can get through the ones to come, together... like we always have. "
Castiel was on fatigue duty… Dean wasn’t a fan of manga or other cartoons of the genre that his children had become diehard fans of.
« C’mon, don’t pull a face like that » Lisa was laughing even louder and planted a kiss on his cheek « The second movie will probably be better »
He was the only boyfriend which Castiel introduced to the family… He was the only one as a matter of fact.
« But know this, Castiel is rather gifted, I think you two would be just fine » he said with a wicked smile. « Talk to each other… Tell him what you like, or don’t like… Each partner has his own preferences »
« You bet » he looked down, his lips stretching in a smile. « Teachers always had that effect on me »
« I don’t wanna talk about it with you or anyone else, Bobby and don’t try to force me… You won’t succeed… It’s something I gotta solve by myself, I told you already » Dean’s voice was a bit exasperated.
They waved at their father who hadn’t moved an inch and ran upstairs, leaving the men alone, face to face.
« Don’t you ever leave us ». Dean avoided to look at his friend. « We couldn’t live without you… Neither me nor the kids... So, I want you to promise that, whatever the future holds for us, even if you meet the man of your life, or if I meet a woman, promise me you’ll always be there »
« Take it easy, sweetheart. We’ve got a bit of time. The stranger over here… » she said pointing at Castiel « ... isn’t done yet with his lamentations »
" Go prepare your stuff or you’ll be late ". He pinched the bridge of his nose in an exhausted gesture.
« MERRY CHRISTMAS » they all shouted as Dean extended the phone towards them. The ritual was identical as every year, yet this time, Dean didn’t wanna hang up.
A clumsy young man approached him and offered him a beer. Castiel found the boy touching and accepted to spend a little time with him, trying to forget the fact he had to go home soon to the only man he actually desired and who was refusing to come to him.
Dean stood up and leaned on the kitchen door frame to listen to them, motioning the dog to stay still.
« What ? Sorry, when I’m furious, I tend to turn into a non-tolerant hetero moron... » he paced across the living room, obviously ranting.
They came home late in the afternoon… Castiel hadn’t said a word during the whole trip back. Dean was smiling at him from time to time and Castiel was returning the smile.
« Because he loves Castiel and he doesn’t want to love him anymore… He is afraid… He’s scared to death to imagine Castiel could die too and leave him, as his mother did… We don’t cry for someone we don’t care about, ya know.»
Dean had never cared about that. He loved his brother, whatever his handicap, and Sam repaid him a hundredfold.
Since his painful separation from his last boyfriend, he had only attached himself with this incorrigibly promiscuous man who had become a necessary stabilizing agent in his life.
"I have the right to yell if I want... I have the right to worry about the only two people in the world I have ... The right to refuse to watch you ruin everything because you're scared to death and...", Sam raises his hand to cut short his brother's attempt to interrupt him. "Don't even dare to pretend or think that you're not worth it...that you're cursed or that you don't deserve to be happy or any other bullshit, because the only thing that prevents you from telling him how you feel is fear... Cass is a soldier, a hunter and not an innocent defenseless mother, Dean... He knows the risks of the job and so do you...so yes Dean, there's a very good chance that one of you will kick the bucket before his time, but that's the case whether you're together or not. That's the risk with our fucking lives so don't do that... Please don't refuse to be happy for the wrong reasons," he ends, out of breath.
Chadwick joined his sister next to the tree, they sat on the floor and opened the box without a word.
« Yes, Chad, he’s fine. He just had several very busy weeks lately » she extended a hand and patted his nose with her finger. The boy forced himself to smile although he looked worried.
" So, tell me " he turned to face Castiel. " You must have come in here less than a dozen times, right? Why did you come "
Bryan was about the same height as Castiel, with a bit more muscles. A bit of facial hair made him look a bit like a bad boy, reinforced by what he was wearing: cowboy boots, a pair of jeans, horse head buckle belt and plaid shirt. The only item missing was the cowboy hat, Dean said to himself.
Tessa used to bake pies for Dean on regular occasions. It was his guilty pleasure and from time to time, he was still finding excuses to buy one or have someone offer him one.
« You two have been playing hide and seek for so long. Why are you staring at me ? » Kevin asked, looking at Dean then Franck.
The man, who appeared to be full of muscles, walked towards them. Castiel recognized him at once. The latter had looked daggers at him when he was speaking with Greg about Dean, the children and Balty. Castiel had stared at him, which had forced the other one to lower his eyes.
« Your friend has been transferred to IC… Dr Gabriel said you may see him now. I’ll show you to his room»
« Comin’ » he looked at the kids as they drowned in 8 inches of fresh snow, laughing their heart out.
“We’ll start with a house aperitif, if it’s ok with you, guys?” Ash asked, glancing at them. They nodded in silence.
He doesn't ask him anything. Nothing about this scar on his cheek. Nothing about the radiance that is missing from this all too human blue.
But he didn’t wanna lose Castiel, he couldn’t live without him, the mere thought of losing him was intolerable.
« Shit ! » Dean rubbed his back and his butt. « I feel like I’ve been hit by a truck » he complained as he joined Castiel.
« My boy, you need to learn that a frontal attack isn’t necessarily the best attitude to solve a problem... Castiel just went through an ordeal that hurt more than his body... If they had attacked him to rob him or because of a wrong word, he would have recovered already... He was assaulted because of what he is… because of his choices… He is both afraid and angry... He needs time to figure it all out... Speak with him about everything except this subject and you’ll see that he will open up, because he won’t be able to keep the distress locked inside for much longer... Trust me... Let him breathe... He knows he can count on you, he isn’t just ready yet, got it? »
« I’ve gotta clean this mess now. That was stupid » he stood up, holding on to the table to regain his balance.
John reaches out and slips his fingertips over the photos, memories of a past life. He lingers nostalgically on Mary's.
Cheyenne seemed to understand what was going on and slowed down by herself. Wink swerved, surprised to see Castiel’s head in her vision perimeter.
All eyes turned towards him, all suddenly wondering if the food was the honest reason of his choice.
John was astonished to hear the voice of his eldest son. It echoes from the kitchen. At first, he thought he was talking to one of his classmates, but as he got closer, he noticed that his son was on the phone.
« You have reached Dean Winchester’s voice mail. I’m not available for the moment. Just leave a message and your coordinates and I’ll get back to you as soon as possible »
He gave up trying to find the answer because right now, for the first time in years, he finally felt where he belonged.
« Yes. We take advantage of the holidays to have the other rooms paint refreshed... We kept a double room for the children and a double one for you... I hope you don’t mind. »
Dean’s face went pale and Castiel guessed the idea was very unpleasant for Dean. He couldn’t help but smile at him.
« Hey, would you listen to this, Mr Bad Temper ! I can’t figure out how you can stand this all day long» Balty asked Castiel, who put the cup in front of him and sat down again.
He set aside a part of it in his piggy bank and smiled. He had seen a splendid book at the librarian’s but then, he hesitated. He had enough money to buy the “beauty” he had seen in this shop window. As he needed a piece of advice, he spontaneously revert to Castiel.
« No, I haven’t… I guess I needed to hear the words one more time» He finished his beer. « Dammit, I feel so dumb right now » he managed not to laugh out loud.
« He has a cracked rib but most seriously two rib fractures. One of the ribs penetrated the left lung causing a pneumothorax. We had to operate »
"You know... I've always considered this bunker as your home, to you and Samuel ... The rest of us have only ever been here for a short time... Kevin... Charlie...", with a slight amused shrug. "Welcomed as friends, but knowing that we were only guests into these walls... It is your ancestors who haunt these places, your past, your roots... This bunker is your oasis in the midst of all this chaos", shyly smiles while staring at his bottle.
Apache watched them leave and settled at his place, with his head resting on the rim of his basket. He was free for a few hours.
« Well, don’t feel obliged to take what I said to the letter... After all, what do I know about gay relationships? Perhaps he just wanna be your friend »
« Open your eyes. You’re incapable of loving anyone because you refuse the admit what’s obvious» she walked out of the kitchen.
« Balty...could we change the subject ? » Dean had obviously reached the limit of their discussion on the subject.
"Unless you have something else to do... Don't mind me ! it'll be more for me", Dean adds hiding his disappointment under a half-toned smile.
« If a handsome guy like this one kissed you and left you breathless, how much time would you wait to drag him in your bed » she asked casually, her chin resting in her palm, the other hand holding the fork planted in the pancake.
He felt ashamed, he was disgusted by his attraction to Castiel. An angel… A man… He hated that he wanted him as soon as he felt his warmth near him… He hated the feeling of needing him at his side… It made him nauseous every time he would wake up after those scabrous nights. He loved women, he could never love a man… The more he felt attracted to him, the more he rejected him and the more Castiel clung on, convinced of being the cause of Dean’s unease and wanting to correct the wrong he felt, wrongly, he had done.
« My family’s gonna collapse, Bobby, and there is nothing I can do about it » Dean said, pulling his hair.
« ...I love you, Dean. I’ll never tell you again, don’t worry. We’ll turn that page and move on. Together... as if nothing ever happened… I can’t live without the three of you… Today is another day. Let’s forget about yesterday... »
« If Dean stays with Lisa and if Castiel... » he suddenly interrupted. « That would mean that this family will be altered forever.. And I just can’t resolve to that »
« No Sweetie... You’ll see, she’s gonna be very nice... Anyway, your dad couldn’t love someone bad… huh? » He tried to reassure her and tenderly put a hand on her cheek.
« Maybe not in those terms » she was surprised by the harsh tone of his words. « You could tell him you’re attracted to him but that you’re unable to take a step further for the time being… that you need more time to fight away your fears and that you need him to do so ».
« Surprise... well, I hope everyone’s gonna like it, but … anyway. » he turned around again and supervised his pasta.
Dean squeezed the counter border harder to try to maintain whatever courage he had left. She stepped forward with a big smile.
"Jerk ", with tenderness. " You should have to talk to me... You should've told him... we wouldn't be here today."
I looked to Sam, ready for him to give a sarcastic comment like he usually would but there was nothing but a weird look on his face.
I had my head in my hands. "I thought you were both in denial. Oh my God, why didn't you just tell me?"
"Have you got your ID?"  The woman ringing us up looked at Jack. I rolled my eyes, seriously? He's with three adults.
"Let me show you how it's really done, baby." I whispered and swung my hips against him to move him to the table.
As he spoke Jack arrived in the kitchen with a wave and his usual "Hello." and sat beside Cas at the table.
Dean and I had been on a vengeful spirit case whilst Cas was doing angel stuff and Jack was at the bunker.
I couldn't see Cas' face but it looked like he was smiling as Dean moved him away from the stove with a swing of his hips. Cas went and took Dean's chair at the table and helped himself to Dean's coffee, fully taking on the role that Dean had and stared at Dean like he hung the freaking moon.
"He's with us." I flashed a smile, knowing all of our IDs were in the car. Also either Jack or Cas would put a foot in their mouth and tell the clerk that he was actually three years old.
I spent most of my night trying to figure out when Dean had become comfortable enough to make a gay joke about him and anyone else, never mind Cas. But it wasn't even a joke. It was a cover. Not a necessary one either. It wasn't even like the clerk wasn't buying it either so why did he feel the need to hold Cas' hand?
I stared at him trying to take in what he'd said. He was saying that me and Cas should get together? What? Did he not know?
I scratched my head. "Uh kinda complicated. I guess you could just go off the day I got out of Hell."
"Gee, thanks Cas." Sam grinned, trying desperately to hide whatever was going on with him. I knew something was up. But it was clear he wasn't going to tell me.
"Claire is speaking in code." He stared at his own phone confused as he typed into google on my phone:
Cas came back after a day or two, finding Dean asleep and miserable with a few broken ribs and looking like shit after being thrown into walls by the ghost. I warned Cas not to heal him or he'd have a bitch fit when he woke up. Cas didn't listen and just like I said, Dean threw a bitch fit when he woke up and found he was healed and Cas' grace was weaker than normal.
I didn't see Dean but Cas was by the stove dressed in Dean's pj's flinching as the bacon spat at him. I guessed he was wearing them since Dean had insisted on Cas saving his grace for injuries and not laundry. So that wasn't what bugged me out. What bugged me out was how sickeningly domestic the scene in front of me was.
I hated to admit it but I invited Jody to help on this hunt just so I'd have some back up. I needed to hold this intervention. It was killing me.
"Okay, will you be getting him a gift and a card? Like they do in the movies?" Jack asked curiously.
"Jack knows we're together." I was just as confused as Cas. "He asked me when our anniversary is a couple months ago. Why would he ask you?"
I was laughing at him being a baby about it but Cas didn't find it as funny as I did, clearly. I noticed Sam getting back from his run but he looked a bit spaced out, I figured it was just a runners high so I left him to it and carried on teasing Cas.
"That's a way to shut him up." Dean chuckled. "Right, let's get him fixed up. We can sort the other bitch out tomorrow and clean up here after." Dean picked Cas up off the floor, very gently and carried him out to the car as I held doors open.
Was I not currently sat in the backseat with my bleeding and passed out boyfriend? Obviously Sam would be the one driving? Did I need to spell it out for him?
"Yeah?" Dean raised his eyebrows. "You seen Jack around yet? Think he might appreciate our warrior food."
"If you're worried about Claire minding because your vessel is technically her Dads let me tell you both right now, she has been waiting for you to get together for years too. She calls you both her dads anyway. So what is stopping you both? Talk it out. Everyone in your lives supports you and wants you both to be happy."
"I'm not." Dean wiped his eyes. "Sammy, we already talked about our 'feelings', what are you even talking about?"
Cas' grip on her loosened and she ran, I took the shot and she fell to the floor but so did Cas, blood pouring from his side.
Once the stitching was done I covered him up and grabbed myself a beer, ignoring Sam staring at my face.
Jack was coming with us on cases, we'd do an average of two cases a week. One he'd come with us on and the other one he'd stay at the bunker and catch up on the lore. I'd taught him how to use Charlie's code that explained the lore a lot more clearly than any of the books did. Jack seemed to be getting Dean's attitude for research. I'd tried to get Cas to stick up for me but that turned out to be futile since Cas barely paid attention to movies never mind paying attention to lore books that we were unlikely to ever need.
It wasn't serious but I was extremely annoyed at Cas. But he was extremely annoyed at me too so I guessed that we were kind of even.
"You need to save your grace for when you actually need it, I can fix this up in no time but I can't fix you up say if you got mortally injured." I explained quickly, pushing his coat and jacket off him so I could get to the cut easier. He flinched as his shirt brushed against the cut, I peeled that away too.
I raised my eyebrows at them both and turned to Jack but he was just munching the bacon like nothing was weird. Like this was an every day thing. Did I miss something?
"You can't be telling me that both of you didn't know?" I laughed again. "Even Jack knows, I thought Claire knew too." I shrugged, I was sure I'd spoken to her about me and Cas.
Cas scowled up at Dean and tried arguing more but Dean put more pressure on the wound and Cas promptly passed out, Dean's hand supporting his head.
Cas flinching away from bacon with bedhead and Dean's comfiest pj's on whilst Dean sat at the table, sipping coffee and staring at him with stars in his eyes.
Dean was constantly worried that Cas wasn't healing properly and Cas was more irritable than ever and it was usually Dean's fault. Actually, it was always Dean's fault.
This peaceful scene could be gone in a matter of minutes. But they were trapped here. The place was heaving with customers.
Dean set his coffee down on the table and came up behind Cas, not even inches away from his ear. "Don't even joke about that."
"I mean on movie nights, they're always cuddling each other and acting like they're in a relationship."
"You two." I tried to look as annoyed as I could but clearly neither of them had any idea on what was going on.
"Yes.You and Dean have feelings for each other. Talk to each other about them. You don't have to do it right now, just please. Soon." Sam had somehow managed to calm his hands down but his eyes kept flashing to me, watching for my reaction.
I didn't even bother asking them about it, I just left them to it. Until I sent a picture of them to Jody.
"Not bad." Dean huffed as he gently slid Cas into the backseat and slid inside beside him, moving Cas so he was leaning on him heavily. "No doubt he'll be a baby about it." He passed me the keys.
If it carried it it was going to start really getting on my nerves. Cas seemed oblivious to it though, being absolutely fine with Sam and still being shy with the PDA. So I made sure it wasn't too much, just a touch here and there, Cas wasn't big on the whole PDA stuff. I respected that. He thought it was a more private thing and honestly I agreed but I wished I could just start making out with Cas mid conversation to just see how Sam reacted.
The witch had killed at least seven people but then the witch turned out to be four witches and that's when I was thankful that we hadn't left Cas at the bunker with Jack like we had wanted to originally. We'd killed one witch already. One was trying to escape but Cas holding her in place whilst Dean was trying to get a clear shot of her.
"I wouldn't say we were together, just messing around at that point." I waggled my eyebrows and Cas rolled his eyes.
I turned my attention back to the movie but felt Sam watching me, I looked at him out of the corner of my eye.
Dean finally arrived, seeing me and Jack in the chairs he huffed but sat down at the other end of the sofa, facing away from Cas and pressed play on the movie.
At least they weren't bickering like usual, I tried shrugging it off. I cleared my throat and entered the kitchen properly then. I expected Cas to at least look away from Dean but he didn't and I expected Dean to at least blush or tense up at being so domestic with Cas on a Wednesday morning.
Cas looked down and smiled weakly back, letting out a big sigh, one of his hands coming up to stroke my cheek before he closed his eyes again.
"You can't be telling me that both of you didn't know?" Dean chuckled. "Even Jack knows, I thought Claire knew too." He shrugged.
He smiled softly, rolling his eyes. "We're fine. Sorry if we made it uncomfortable. I don't like it when he tells me what to do."
"Obviously." I shut the door and started wrapping Cas' trench coat around him because he shivered into me.
"I've been calling him all freaking day, Sammy. His phone's off. I told him- I freaking told him to keep it charged." Dean dialled again only to hang up straight away.
"You need to save your grace for when you actually need it, I can fix this up in no time but I can't fix you up say if you got mortally injured." Dean was peeling Cas' layers off him, pretty much undressing Cas in the middle of an abandoned factory. Classy.
Cas shrugged and went back to looking at Dean's phone, Dean peered over his shoulder with an amused grin on his face, resting his chin on Cas shoulder as he read whatever it was.
"Leave him for a couple hours, he might have turned it off for something important and forgot to turn it on. You know what Cas is like."
"I don't know. He just keeps looking at us weird I guess. I could be over thinking it." I shrugged, and stroked Cas' hair before leaning in for another kiss. God I missed him when he would go away. He'd already been back for two days but it barely felt like five minutes.
"I've been ignoring this for way over ten years now, will you two please just admit your feelings for each other, I'm sick of waiting around for it to happen and every time I think it will happen it never fucking does. You're pretty much a couple anyway, do you know just how many times I've caught you two all cuddled up together, Cas you've slept in your own room maybe once and that's only because you and Dean had a fight and Dean you sleep in his room when he's away. And it's just too much, just fucking admit it. It's not that hard. You already bicker like an old married couple, you stare at each other all the time, snuggle with each other on movie nights, Dean hasn't had a one night stand in at least a year. Dean your hand is literally on Cas' leg right now, so for fuck sake just go and talk it out!" He seemed to of shocked himself with how much he'd said too.
As promised we went out the next day, just to the shop to get some food and a bit of beer. Nothing big but seeing Cas outside again made me feel better, dressed in his clothes again he did look a lot stronger. Maybe it was because my pj's were too baggy on him? They made him look smaller than he was. But damn he looked good in them.
"Yeah, he turned his phone off and forgot to turn it back on until like two in the morning." Dean rolled his eyes and went to get his coffee.
"Hello." Jack walked inside smiling and sat beside Cas, him also taking a sip from my cup of coffee. Can't a guy have one think without it being stolen in this bunker?
I cuddled Cas at every single movie night, I made sure we had more movie nights and I went all out with the blankets and even put chick flicks on.
"Are you trying to say that Cas can't cook?" I gave Cas and Jack their breakfasts and sat beside Sam, digging in.
It was a stupid argument, both of us had good points it's just neither of us would admit that. I saw where he was coming from and I knew he saw where I was coming from but because we're both stubborn idiots, we were giving each other the silent treatment.
Before I knew it I was laughing harder than I had in weeks, his bitch face made it worse. I wiped the tears away from my eyes, Cas kicking my ankle to try and get me to stop.
Scary hunter Dean. The best hunter in the world. Feared by all monsters, demons, angels and other hunters. Having a freaking cuddle whilst watching shitty movies.
"Morning Sammy, Do you want some real breakfast today? Warrior breakfast?" I knew it smelt damn tempting.
I frowned. "Have you noticed Sam being a bit weird recently?" I pulled him closer so we were chest to chest, his arm easily snaked over my side, stroking my shoulder blade.
been fine with us, he'd be laughing and rolling his eyes whenever me and Cas went a little bit PDA but he was always fine. He was always the one trying to get us to stop arguing and listen to each other so I really didn't understand why he was acting so weird all of a sudden.
"Are you trying to say that Cas can't cook?" Dean smirked, handing a plate to Jack, then one to Cas and sitting beside me at the table.
I felt my face soften at him, he'd healed me and put himself through being more human for a while, the least I could do was not be a dick about it.
"I honestly thought you knew, I mean you're always calling Cas my boyfriend and he technically is so- I mean it's not like we were subtle." I rolled my eyes thinking back to all the close calls we'd had when Sam knocked on my door and Cas ever the prude would zap our clothes back on, mid sex. Even then he never fixed the fact that we would be both panting and red in the face. Cas always said that it would make me uncomfortable if I walked in on Sam and anyone else so he shouldn't have to walk in on us. I agreed, but now I wish I'd just let him walk in one time and we wouldn't be having this stupid conversation.
I'd wait until he would tell me then, I rested my chin on Cas' shoulder and read the text speak he was searching.
He was probably right, I mean stitching Cas up here wasn't the best idea I'd ever had but it was going to be damn difficult getting Cas back to the motel without him trying to heal himself.
But it was the witches case that Sam brought it up a level, it was a hard case. What we thought was one witch turned out to be four of the dirty bitches. We'd killed one, one had escaped, Sam was dealing with another one and Cas had caught the last one, trying to keep her still so I could shoot her but she kept writhing around, swaying her head in front of Cas'. I knew the bullets probably wouldn't hurt Cas but I wasn't going to test my theory by taking a shot and end up shooting him in the face.
I felt like my head was about to explode. No way was this happening. I never expected this reaction.
"He's doesn't usually give us funny looks, he just rolls his eyes." Cas pursed his lips and I took the opportunity to kiss him again which made him laugh and kiss me back.
I was lay in bed just listening to some music when Cas came in looking troubled, I took my headphones out.
Cas turned with his body and gave Dean a look that I couldn't see from my place at the door, neither of them seemed to notice me stood there but it wasn't like I was sneaking. It would be obvious if they took their eyes off each other for one second. Dean reacted to whatever look Cas was giving him with a wink and a shit eating grin.
Usually when they were fighting Jack and I would take the sofa in the 'Dean cave' and they'd have a chair each, away from each other. But they needed to sort their shit out so I got myself comfy on a chair and Jack followed suit, sitting on the other chair.
It only took Cas a few days to recover but those few days were awful, Jack and I ended up spending a lot of time out of the bunker just to get away from the constant bickering. Finally Dean actually let Cas leave the bunker and we all decided we'd go on a beer run.
"It's been about four years now. " Dean shrugged. "Why'd you think I was like that when he freaking died, Sam?"
The cuddling on movie night just seemed to be a thing between them now, unless they were fighting. Then it would be opposite ends of the sofa until the movie was half way through then I'd turn and suddenly they'd be wrapped up in a blanket watching the movie.
I set my coffee down on the table and walked over to him, putting my hand up his shirt and nipping at his skin, I knew Sam wouldn't be able to see what my hands were doing so I didn't feel bad about it.  "Don't even joke about that." I said right into his ear, knowing it tickled him.
"Dean says that we were on and off for a while, I think that means that we used to break up a lot." Cas shrugged.
"Yeah, I think it's good too. Why're you asking, angel?" I pulled him in for another kiss, it was damn addictive.
And I swear I saw Cas reach out and touch Dean's face, It could of been my eyes playing tricks on me but there was a small speck of blood on Dean's cheek that I was sure wasn't there before Cas woke up.
I smirked thinking back to how that had happened, mid crazy hot make out session with a douche who was also an angel of the lord but was stupid hot when another douche bag angel flaps in and starts lecturing Cas on blasphemy and God, the whole nine yards and for Cas to simply get up from the bed, still in his boxers with a fairly obvious boner and tell Uriel he should come back in an hour with an apology for both me and him on how disrespectful he had been. And Uriel hung his head and went away. Coming back an hour later and fucking apologising whilst Cas smirked at him. That was still the hottest thing Cas had ever fucking done.
I rolled my eyes when Cas shuffled so he was stood beside Dean again. They were both as bad as each other.
I huffed and sat at the opposite end, pressing play and answering Jack's constant stream of questions.
Dean is blatantly obvious about him and Cas yet somehow still doesn't realise that he has feelings and Sam is seriously considering getting help for them at this point.
He was looking at us both all the damn time, like he wanted to say something but he never did. I started pretty much inviting him to say something to be about it.
Jack beamed back and turned to the movie again, him not seeing anything strange about how he and Cas were snuggled up.
"Dean, you are not my father so stop treating me like a child. If I want to use my grace I will. It's
I quickly bent to pick it up, having to blink a few times to believe that what I was seeing was real.
Sam shook his head, grabbing his gross rabbit food cereal and pouring himself a bowl and sitting across from Cas. "I'm good with this."
Sam took a deep breath and started spewing out words, faster than I'd ever heard him speak in his life.
"Don't you dare use your mojo you idiot." Dean shoved Cas' wrists so that his hands were nowhere near the wound.
"We thought everyone knew. How did you not know?" I questioned, literally everyone asked and it wasn't like I lied about it. Jack figured it out when he was only a few weeks old for fuck sake. It wasn't some big conspiracy.
I carried on eating my cereal trying to figure out what kind of spell this could be, no way were they being so domestic without any intervention.
Dean hadn't been mothering Cas for a few hours and Cas hadn't picked a fight with Dean for at least twelve hours. It all seemed fine. Almost back to normal. If they just admitted their feelings for each other it would be so much easier, Dean would have an excuse to give Cas on why he was being so overbearing and it would be easier for everyone all round. I felt like locking them in a room most of the time.
Halfway through Dean stitching up the wound Cas woke up, visibly confused and tried jerking away from Dean's steady hands.
The first really strange thing to happen was after my morning run. I didn't expect anyone in the bunker to be awake at all.
"Okay, if you're his parents." She pointed to Dean and Cas then turned to me. "Who does that make you?"
"Don't you dare use your mojo you idiot." I ripped his hands away from the cut and held his wrists in one hand so I could check it out myself. It was easily fixable, nothing glowing. He'd be fine. But if he used his grace now and the witch that escaped came back and did worse? No way was that happening.
"But-" Cas started but I felt more blood coming out so I upped the pressure and Cas' eyes fluttered, his head lolling in my lap. I quickly let go of his wrists and caught his head.
I nodded, letting him carry on telling me all about Cas' trip in Peru even though I hadn't asked about that. I'd only asked if he was okay. That's it. Dean didn't seem to realise this.
The witch case really spun me out of sync with Cas. I could tell I was being a dick, I didn't let him out of my sight and refused to let him out to stretch his legs. We hadn't been able to find the witch that had escaped and Cas was still needed to sleep every night and he was even hungry every now and then. It freaked me out. I loved waking up with him but it terrified me because t meant he was breakable. It meant that he wasn't safe.
I thought one of them would at least notice but no, they were going for the gold on the staring match as per usual.
"I'd rather we didn't start fighting again." Cas sighed, moving his hand from my back and moving it up my shirt instead, resting his hand over my heart.
I just couldn't find an explanation for it other than the explanation I'd had for years now, that they're both dumb asses who didn't know they were in love.
Cas turned to me and scowled but I saw his eyes were still sleepy and soft. I grinned and gave him a wink.
"That's a way to shut him up." I chuckled to Sam who gave me a surprised look. "Right, let's get him fixed up. We can sort the other bitch out tomorrow and clean up here after." I nodded to myself and slowly picked Cas up, letting his head rest on my shoulder as I walked to the car as fast as I could so I could keep the pressure on the cut.
« So what ? I don’t like to throw away the food. Besides, no one seems to like it » he looked at him with a little smile.
« What shall we talk about then? Because, if you’ve noticed, this is the Meeting, right?» she smiled at the barman who had brought their glasses without a word nor a look.
He stepped out of the Impala and cursed as he sunk into the thick layer of snow... He spent one hour shoveling the snow in front of the entrance...
« First of all, we aren’t strangers anymore » She winked. « And then, I don’t mind listening to your whining while we’re having lunch »
It was more than they could bear. Castiel bursted out laughing, soon imitated by Chadwick, doubled up with laughter… He had a hard time taking a clear picture.
Dean was sipping his beer, sitting on a log, facing the lake ... Although they were exhausted, the children were playing a game of cards near the fire that Castiel had lit a few minutes earlier.
« I said you’re awesome » she repeated, putting a finger under his chin and forcing him to look at her.
If Jewel didn’t understand at once what the word « surrogate guardian » meant, Chadwick got it right away.
Dean had planned a simple and sober dinner, one of his classic recipes. Grilled chicken and corn side dish, jacket potatoes and honey sauce.
« I’ll start with the housework and then… nothing… I’ll just sit on the couch and enjoy a hot chocolate and a good book… I’ll play the lazy one » she answered with a big smile, stretching her arms.
Dean parked the Impala in front of a saloon shop window; he was glowing... like a kid standing outside a candy store.
" No " he smiled. " I asked Jo to take care of the children....I... do you think it’s stupid ? Too chick lit" he felt clumsy.
“Hey guys, if it was yucky, I would have told you... You eye the waiter greedily, that’s right, but you pay for the dish.”
« I’ll finish preparing the meal » Lisa went back to the kitchen : there was an impenetrable expression on her face.
Chadwick had to make a presentation for the geography and history class. The theme imposed was: " Modern Art " ... A rather broad topic that didn’t inspire the boy at all; Chadwick tried to focus on his notebooks during the entire late afternoon.
Bobby had always been there for them, he was seeing Dean as a full member of his family and the feeling was mutual for Dean.
There was no way he could postpone the inevitable, je just hoped the children would be back before he arrived. He couldn’t stand in front of Castiel alone, he couldn’t face those eyes who would ask the question in silence.
" But... " He turned to Castiel with a desperate look. " Since when ? " He asked, looking at Chadwick, fidgeting on his chair. " Since when ? " he asked again, totally panicked.
« What’s all this fun about ?» he asked, heading to the coffee machine. « What took you so long? Did ya have to grow the beans or what ? » he asked Franck with a nasty smile, grabbing a clean cup.
"That’s it." Dean smiled, feeling satisfied, persuaded to be the reason for this change ... It wasn’t totally false but most of all Castiel was ready for any sacrifice not to lose his family ... No to mention Dean.
« You kids are awesome! » the old man was touched and took them in his arms, unable to find the words to express how he felt.
"That's why they call it ...private..., Believe it or not !," Dean retorts. "And I'm telling you for the last time, I didn't do anything... He took off, period "
Balty seemed to turn prematurely senile in front of the dog and adopted a peculiar language in front of him.
« Nah… I was freezing my butt. Bobby refuses to put the heating on in the bedrooms » she was hugging herself real tight in an attempt to hold the heat within.
"So?" Dean says, his forearms resting on the table, bottle in his hands, playing with the condensation on the glass.
Since his discussion with Kate, he found it even more difficult to sleep well. No need to add more stress and talk about his emotional doubts.
They weren’t in the adult present thing as they considered Christmas was mostly dedicated for the children, but they like to find something nice to offer anyway.
Here they were, glaring at each other almost as strangers.... He didn’t pay attention to his mother’s old friends present as each year and who were obviously ignoring him, displaying a polite behavior because it only was politically correct.
« Really.... You see, it’s never too late to find a suitable match. Besides, you gotta admit this goddam Balty tried a lot of combinations in the past » he smiled with tenderness.
« What? The same as... » He called to witness the other three behind and innocently took a sip of his drink.
« Yeah, I know… I’m sorry, Lisa… But each time I wanted to do so, another shoe was dropping again and again» he rubbed his neck.
« Tessa, my love... You filled the whole place. How am I supposed to let her in now? » he smiled to himself, feeling a bit sad and bitter about the whole situation.
He closes his eyes, clenches his fists, curses his memories which torment him in this unchanging refrain: "Hello Dean".
I’d like to express her my ever-lasting gratitude for painstakingly translating this fic into English, on top of her private life.
« I don’t regret anything, Cass… Anything… Nothing’d have happened if I had decided otherwise, do you hear me ? »
« No…he said you must come down, he said it was … » she was looking for the word her father had used. « Urgent » she finally said with a smile
When they reached the second floor, Jewel asked for a break, she had sore feet, she had to pee. Chadwick was thirsty ... The lemon ice effect.
The evidence stared him the face, a moment of silence and he howled his hopelessness, he held his knees, his head sinking between them, squeezed tightly between his knees.
« No, Jewel… And stand up straight. Stop whining, you’re a big girl now … » Madame Fournier’s tone was as cold as ice.
They drank their chocolate in silence and then the children finally spoke of a million things, about the tree, the snowman, the battle in the garden… They even laughed about the bad joke their father had played on Castiel.
They chat some more. Dean was feeling more at ease. To speak about sexuality among men was still uncomfortable for him but Balty was now choosing less crude words, avoiding details, putting more emphasis on feelings.
John takes advantage of Jo's presence, back from Texas where she's studying, to invite her to dinner. Dean has never looked at Jo otherwise than as a little sister, and seeing his father playing matchmaker since his break-up with Lisa makes him more and more uncomfortable.
On the evening the next day, Castiel left after supper and Chadwick remained with his father, to help him cleaning the kitchen.
It was like an old time tea party, sharing laughters, telling about the day’s events. Just sharing good times among the four of them.
But if Sam has finally come to his senses, his eldest hasn't, and Dean's still hoping for his hero to return. He who is the real hero in the eyes of his younger brother.
« Nobody likes it, Jewel, but he’s got to visit his mom » her brother said, putting an arm around her shoulders.
He opened the door and stopped… He didn’t like churches, he didn’t like God… But he loved him and for him, he had to try, if he could have back at his side, if only to known with he felt for him, since the first day, since Hell…
Afterwards, the children wanted to swim in the lake. Castiel refused : digestion safety rules first. Dean decided to take a nap. He had worked late the night before and was dog tired. Castiel went for a walk with the kids. Apache refused to follow and remained by Dean’s side. Jumping in the lake so many times earlier had apparently drained him too.
He ended up slumped on the couch in front of the television, with a beer in his hand. Should anyone ask him what he was watching, he’d been unable to answer, as all his thoughts were converging on his last conversation with Jo.
He felt Castiel free himself from his embrace and turn to face him. He saw his eyes and suddenly felt uncomfortable. He wasn’t used to this kind of open-heart declaration. Castiel raised his right hand and put it on Dean’s cheek. Dean closed his eyes and drowned in the feeling.
He sighed. He missed her so much all of a sudden and his heart sank when he realized he hadn’t thought of her in such a way for a long time. He felt guilty but then again, life had to go on and she wouldn’t be happy to see him give up on life.
« You see, Jimmy wanted to be an explorer and if he had managed to fulfill his dream, the city would have disappeared as well as all the ones he loved. He wouldn’t be married and he wouldn’t have any kids. »
« We should go back to the living room. They’re gonna wonder where we’ve disappeared, Balty first » he smiled and brushed Dean’s kips with the tip of his fingers.
What would she think of all this ? Would she be mad at him ? She had trusted him completely; he suddenly wondered whether he had betrayed her by loving Dean as well. She must have known back then, she had always been able to read in his heart.
He saw a bit of sadness in Balty’s eyes, filled with a touch of nostalgia. The latter turned to Bryan and smiled.
He won't do anything to defend Castiel. Dean will always choose his family and his father over his own happiness.
Longhorns were peacefully grazing in a distance and Dean slowed a little so he could observe them better.
« Wow... he’s definitely giving his best shot ! » he said in a bitter tone, pushing his hands in deep his jeans pockets.
Dean was wondering why Castiel was going out with the kids so often. He just thought that perhaps, he needed to get some fresh air and improve his tan.
Chadwick bursted out laughing for good. Jewel didn’t get the pun. However, as she heard them all laughing, she involuntarily added more fun to the scene when she let go of her brother and turned to her father.
« Daddy, look at Santa’s wife! » she was pointing at a portly woman who was running towards her « husband ».
When after several minutes he succeeds, dozens of children rush to the candy that cascades to the ground.
Steven, her first kiss... All she could remember of the experience was it was “wet”. She smiled at the memory and saw Dean.
He hesitated a few seconds before opening the last present. There was a card slided underneath the ribbon. It was one of those cheesy cards with a sparkling Santa. Dean must have found it at the last minute. He always felt a bit awkward with the season’s emotional display and Castiel found it very touching Dean had made an effort for him.
He climbed the fence, sit astride and whistled ... Mark showed up with a beautiful black and white Paint horse.
A brief silence grew between them, his son wishing to let his father a chance to elaborate, but the latter seemed so tired.
“What’s up, Cas?” the hunter responded casually, clearly having no clue as to what this conversation would be about.
"Who brought you back?" Dean would have asked how, but he knew better than that. There was always a who.
‘Hey Cas!’ it was Dean’s voice. The recording of him sighed, ‘God this is so stupid,’ he mumbled as though the recording wouldn’t pick him up. ‘Look, I wasn’t sure how to say this. A-and at the time it all happened so quick. You were saying words that I’ve needed… wanted to hear for years, and then you were gone.’ He laughed brokenly.
They drove the rest of the way in silence, Castiel had switched off the radio because of the interferences due to the weather conditions.
« Where is the tent, Daddy?» Jewel asked with such innocence as she threw a few smaller branches on Castiel pile. Apache sat next to her.
« Of course, but don’t expect us to go very soon, Pumpkin. Perhaps during the Summer holidays » Dean turned off the DVD reader and put the remote back on the table.
" I've been... No," Dean stutters, unable to take his eyes off the angel's lips. "We were just asking if you would like to come...to come live here...with us..... We don't lack space or a guest room, as you've already known, and it would be more convenient, you know...for hunting and searching and all that," awkwardly trying to keep a detached look on his face.
The other three watched as he flew up, his legs and arms shuffling into the air before he harshly landed face first on the lake surface.
What if Zeke finally became a part of Castiel’s life and what if Castiel finally started to love him in return?
Sam leans on the doorframe, two cups of coffee in his hands. He sees his elder, fingers clenched on the manuscript, Castiel who ties them in his and rests his chin lightly on the hunter's shoulder.
He was covering what was left of the pie with and was about to put it in the fridge when Dean entered the kitchen.
« Balty ? » Megan had questioned her daughter as she was putting her coat on at the end of the first afternoon at their place.
Dean walked to the reception. He tried not to show his impatience and remained silent until the nurse hung up the phone.
« Don’t be sorry. It was perfect » Castiel told him at once, putting a finger on his lips, underlining their curves.
« That’s all right. Justin stayed with me. He just left with his mother» Chadwick was lying of course.
One of their last pictures showing them all together. Dean was holding Tessa in his arms and Castiel was kneeling in front of them, with the children on each side.
When I got out of the bathroom, you put me against the wall. You stared at me with this almost dark blue eyes.
“Ahhhhh but I can assure you that guy is straight, trust me... And right now, the poor man doesn’t understand what has just fallen on him,” Gaby giggled.
Dean hesitated, looked down at the bottle in his hands. He had to know how people would react. Now was the moment of truth.
Dean eventually joined them. His cheeks were blushed from the heat he had to endure trapped in his costume.
"Are you kidding me or are you doing this on purpose ? Did you even listen a single word I just said ," Sam shouts.
« Isn’t he gifted ? » She was all smiles and sat back, holding the painting in front of her. « It feels like the man is about to walk out of the frame »
"A beautiful mustang... Nooooo, you're crazy! " he cries with that smile in his voice that John thought was lost forever.
« Are you gay now ? » She asked, facing the mirror and putting on lipstick in a casual tone ; she wasn’t judging, just stating a fact.
« What time is it now? » Dean mumbled, looking at the clock on the wall. 11h45. Madison should be there any minute. As well as Cass »
Dean opens the manuscript and discovers the strange signs. His index finger goes from left to right when Castiel's hand put on his. Dean shivers and closes his eyes. The hand guides him from right to left.
« Are you gonna tell me what the hell happened or what? » Dean was worried as he put his hands on his little girl’s cheeks.
He knew this ultimate experience would be the last, the one he had to acknowledge if he were to love someone again… totally, completely.
Castiel holds that breath he tames. A beat animates this heart born to the rythm of his dying grace.
« We’re gonna be great dog owners attending canine classes with the kids, we’re gonna learn how not to lose an arm while walking him» Castiel stood up.
Dean couldn’t help smiling as he noticed Castiel hadn’t found the way yet to give his messy hair a decent look.
Ten minutes later, Chadwick came out … Dean straightened, amazed by the transformation of his son. He felt so proud and couldn’t take his eyes of him. He was tall and well-built for a boy his age.
Half slumped on his bed reading yet another comic book dedicated to Batman, Dean takes a curious look at his alarm clock.
He hated Ash, not because he lacked any feeling of love strictly speaking, but in his mind, Ash didn’t fit the shoes of the ideal son for his beloved niece.
« Hello… Let me introduce myself, as no one seems to be ready to do it. » she gave Dean a nasty look « I’m Lisa »
« C’mon... I’ll buy you a drink. On second thought, you’ll buy me a drink » she said, holding the door for him.
Castiel started to make a face too as he remembered the taste of the vanilla pudding. The memory was still so vivid in his mouth.
Dean pushes his coffee back and gets his head in his hands and then suddenly, in a fit of anger, throws his cup against the wall.
“I’ll never leave you… I never did, Dean… I love you.” He gently pulled them apart to look into Dean’s face. “Don’t hate me ever again.” He begged with his eyes.
"He and I we're going to have a little talk, here's what's going to happen... There's no way that this... ", Dean stoppes to talk, biting his lip.
"At first, I asked myself the same questions you did, when you proposed to move under the same roof ... I wondered what people would think, I thought of the children, of the consequences of all this ... I didn’t want to risk losing our friendship because of the consequences of such a decision ... I had just lost Tessa ... Losing you would have been too much to cope with. »
« So what? That’s the truth… I was riding a different kind of horse… And I can guarantee that it was worth all the rodeos in the world » he said, with a blissful smile, his head resting on his hands, elbows on the table.
« And you’ve been waiting all this time to tell us? » Balty stated, grabbing the jar of jam. «What were you waiting for? Till the cows come home ? »
“And now I can savor it a second time… You perverted Castiel, you turned him against us… You caused the deaths of my family… I know what your heart refused to show him… Cry for you lost love… Scream your un-confessed love… It is your turn to feel the most painful suffering… The memories… Those of this being who died believing the man he loved hated him, the man he sacrificed everything for.”
They had decided to go all together to the shopping mall which had opened two months before, just outside of town. The kids were growing fast and they needed new clothes. Dean’s clothes were more than worn-out after a thousand trips to the washing machine. Castiel didn’t need anything but Dean had begged him to come along after Jo declined to tag along.
Chadwick had changed and joined them in the living room. Dean was sitting in the armchair, sipping a beer. Castiel was installed on the couch, with his back to the door.
« We would go faster if we took the escalators. » Dean was grouching in front of the small crowd gathered by the elevators doors.
I miss you so much but I don't have the courage to tell you this words and even less to show you how much.
Castiel did the same unguardedly, and because he felt in complete confidence with her, he told her about Zeke… He told her about Dean… He mentioned what he had done which was haunting him...
« I’m sure he’s at the garage, Jewel... he has a lot to do, you know. He’ll be home tonight» Chadwick answered, rushing to the rescue.
« We’ll meet at the ranch, I’ll inform them you’re on your way....You’ll be right on time for supper »
« A real bitch, this one, but never let it said that a redneck piece of garbage will defeat me » he snapped back as he started to laugh.
« Who? Cass? Tell him what, Jo? That I enjoyed kissing him but I find the idea of having sex with him quite repulsive? » He shouted out in frustration.
He pushed the ENTER key and raised his eyes, only to meet Castiel’s eyes staring at him, a smile on his lips.
When the trio came back to the camp, Dean was already awake and waiting for them. He was bare chested, wearing black Bermuda shorts only.
He’d felt the pain waking up in his ribs during the trip, but hadn’t complained although Dean could see it on his face.
« I don’t want you to keep all this to yourself, Chad… If you need to talk, I’m here and if you don’t wanna talk to me, you can talk to Bobby or Jo or John… You needn’t suffer in silence… You’re my son… Don’t you ever forget that… I love you… And I’ll always be there for you and your sister. »
" Cass " Dean took off his glove and put a hand on the man’s cheek. " Cass " he slowy helped him in a sitting position.
He looked at him with panic in his eyes, Jewel was holding tight to his pants and Chadwick was all supplication.
The children had always known these attitudes; today, there were able to grasp the meaning of it all.
They first chose to tour the ground floor ... just to have a look around and marvel at the unlimited and often outrageous imagination of each store owner to attract customers ... Shop windows were showing off, adopting the same common theme, the Ancient Rome. Jewel ran from one shop window to another, followed by Castiel, carefully watching over her.
« Sure, honey » Balty replied as he took Jewel in his arms and shuffled through Chadwick’s hair. The little boy pushed him away and laughed.
The door opened wide on a smiling Bobby : he pushed his cap back and kissed Jewel who was stretching her arms to him.
What could have been considered a plain gift was actually the most precious one he could have received ; Dean knew the value of the words Cass had written, what they meant, what they implied. The emotions were so strong that he just couldn’t refrain from shaking and letting everyone show how overwhelmed he was.
« My Baby… » he said as he took a closer look at the plastic box protecting the car. « She’s magnificent »
When they were done, Castiel cut a lemon in two and gave it to Jewel who squeezed as hard as she could over a small cup to get the juice out.
« We’re further than I’d have imagined I could go » Dean laughed ironically. « ...but one day, that won’t be enough... one day, I will have to go beyond letting him come to me, I’ll have to go to him and … I … I can’t… I’m stuck ».
They shared the brief moment yet Castiel didn’t have much time to savor it for long as Chadwick rushed out of the car and waited for his sister outside..
He closed his eyes, felt a pressure in his chest, his hands started to shake. All of a sudden, he started to shiver.
« You sure look classy.» Dean whistled, his arm leaning on his knee, holding a slice of three-cheese pizza in his hand.
As Dean refused to let his children wander alone in the streets, he decided to accompany them as he had done every year... Surprisingly, they’d never complained about it... as long as their father and Castiel were disguised as well... They were actually not the only parents to do so...
« Really? » Bobby found it hard to believe. « Is Dean already up? » he asked, looking at the empty plate on the table.
"Classy," Dean is amazed "If you want, we can be friends ? " he offers him by finally releasing his hand.
Dean joined him, frowning. Jewel was hiding behind her father, clinging tight to his shirt. Chadwick was following reluctantly as his father had ordered him not to stay behind, in case there would be a wolf or a bear looking for easy food.
Dean’s mobile started to vibrate in his pocket. Jo saw the sparkle in his eyes. She felt the movements in his body become feverish.
John stands, pale as a corpse. There's disappointment in his eyes and maybe even a hint of disgust that makes Dean regret the most beautiful thing that has just happened to him.
He would join Castiel in his apartment, except on a certain Wednesday when they fell in each other’s embrace, shared a more passionate kiss and had barely enough time to reach Dean’s bedroom.
Dean, holding his son by the shoulder on one side and his daughter on the other. Kneeling in front of them: Castiel, with one hand of each kid on his shoulders.
" Go and get ready… I’ll drive you to school " he said in an almost inaudible voice, feeling calm again.
« What took you so long? » He smiled at her and nodded at the empty space on his right, inviting her to sit next to him.
« Isn’t that true ? You too should have moved on for a while now, you know, and engage in the physical chapter. What is Dean waiting for, perhaps for his balls to get ripe? »
" Dean... They KNOW " he said, leaning on the table, chin in his palm, staring at him. Yet Dean didn’t seem to get it yet.
He smiled: happiness was at hand, again, he knew Tessa was watching from up above. He knew she would rejoice.
There is no domination game between them, there never was, even the first time. Just a look, enough to know who needs the other and Dean likes this intimate trust, he needs it.
