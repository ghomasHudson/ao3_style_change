“Your little troupe of bandits is back under your roof,” Fury said. “You’ve managed to piss of the US Secretary of State. And now you’re calling me. Forgive me if I’m twitchy.”
“I used to call him Super Nanny,” Clint said, making sure he was out of Coulson’s reach. He yelped a moment later. “What the hell?”
Ahhh.....this fic is taking over my life! thank you so much for all of your lovely words of encouragement. Onto a little more action now.
Steve decided not to bring up the last trip Tony had taken to space. He still had nightmares about it. He had no doubt that Tony did too. “So I’m assuming that stealth isn’t really what we’re going for?” Steve asked instead.
Bucky’s mouth tilted up a little in the corner. “Steve once told me that for someone who talked so much, you sure didn’t say anything relevant.”
“What happened when he slept?” Steve wanted to hear more of Bucky’s time with Tony. The time that he still felt a little cheated out of.
“Back off, Fido, he’s not available.” Tony declared it like it meant nothing. It made Steve’s heart hurt when he saw the pure delight on Bucky’s face.
Steve wasn’t talking to Tony. He was still visibly angry that he’d not been kept in the loop about the SRA, but Tony couldn’t,
!” Tony insisted. “If I plan on wooing our Capybara, then I need to be as squeaky clean as I possibly can.”
“I believe we should put the good doctor in the stasis pod until we have discovered a way to cure him,” Thor suggested. “He grows ever weaker.”
“Why don't you stay for a while?” Bucky suggested. “We can get to know each other again, fill in the blank spaces in the lives that we've missed.”
Steve pondered what to say. He knew how fragile Wanda was, there was something not quite stable in her eyes occasionally that concerned him. But, she’d chosen to stand with him and Steve had not thought to ask why. He’d been too happy to have her magic to counter Vision’s.
“Sure, we’ll go with that story,” Clint drawled. “Man, I forgot just how nuts this team can get.” He grinned at Tony. “I don’t know if I ever actually said it, but thanks, man. Thanks for bringing us home.”
He threw his hands up in the air. “Goddam it, I hate you all!” He tapped his earpiece. “F.R.I.D.A.Y. is Stark Tower operational?”
Steve sucked in a deep breath. Thank god Tony had thought about him. He stood up again, feeling a little dizzy. “Is everyone else up?” he asked.
“I’ve spent some time with some folks you may know,” Lucifer said. “Perhaps if you opened the door, I could take you to them.” The tiny smirk on his face made Tony shudder.
“The Cage.” Steve’s voice was strained, almost hoarse. Tony imagined that perhaps Steve hadn’t been completely obedient in keeping his eyes closed. “Let’s get this done.”
“I’m thinking about stabbing you anyway,” she told him, allowing him to pull her close. Her arms went around his waist, clamped down hard. “Dumbass.”
“This isn’t a game.” Bucky spoke suddenly. “We can die. Our worlds can die. If Tony says he needs to know everything, then fucking
Tony yawned. “I used to be tanked-up most of the time,” he said around his hand. “It took being kidnapped and having my heart replaced by a machine to cure that particular pastime.” He had a feeling that none of them were actually as plastered as they appeared. They were all too aware of the job that lay ahead of them.
James Buchanan Barnes had been abused by the very best and yet he didn’t blink. “Depends what you want?” he drawled.
Loki turned his gaze to Thor. “You follow him,” he said. “You’re the son of Odin, King of Asgard, and you follow this man.”
“Is she a spy or a mercenary for hire that she needs to know shit like that?” Tony was very confused.
“I’m giving you a solemn oath, nothing, only death, will prevent me from letting you down again.” Steve straightened, at full height. “You’ve been the most important person in my life since I woke up in this crazy world, and I will never forget it.”
“Oh my god,” Tony groaned into his hands. “I could have lived a thousand lifetimes without knowing that.”
“Dr. Banner, if you have control of the Hulk, as you claim, then can you prove it?” T’Challa’s question was like a bomb in the sudden silence.
“Don’t care, don’t share.” Bruce waved at the computer generated image spinning slowly in the middle of the lab. Vision had his hand in the center of the brightly glowing sphere.
Bucky Barnes glared at him. “What the fuck are you doing here at ass o clock in the morning, Stark?” The scientist in Tony’s brain catalogued the well-muscled chest and low-slung pants, noting that Barnes was a relatively attractive member of the human race.
Tony didn’t make another sound, just turned his face into the warm skin of Steve’s neck, chest heaving as he struggled to regain control.
“Are you thinking what I’m thinking?” Bucky murmured, clearly not having the same issues that Steve had.
“Tell them I’m on my way,” Tony said, switching the water off and grabbing a towel. He padded back through to the bedroom, dropping the towel once he was mostly dry.
“I’m going to die and you’ll have to explain my corpse to Fury.” Tony groaned as Bucky’s tongue laved across his hole.
“Hey,” Tony forced Clint’s face up. “Barton, look at me.” He made Clint meet his eyes. “Breathe with me,” he commanded, imitating Steve when he’d arrived here. He grabbed Clint’s hand and slapped his palm against his chest. “Focus on my heartbeat,” he ordered, keeping his gaze steady on Clint.
Peggy whispered to him in sighs. He touched the chair and it lit up. He stared down at Matilda. “Any thoughts?”
“I was a cocky little shit before the serum,” Steve confessed. “My mouth got me in trouble a lot. Buck had to rescue me too many times.”
None of the team had left. Natasha and Pepper rested against each other on the sofa in the corner of the infirmary. Clint had commandeered another bed and was sitting cross-legged, sleeping with his eyes open, a talent that Tony refused to admit he was envious of. Thor and a slender stranger were talking quietly to each other. Every now and then Thor would reach out to touch him as though he wanted to ensure he wasn’t seeing things. His companion was skittish, often dodging the big hand, but allowing it occasionally with a put-upon air that told Tony he was just as eager to reaffirm Thor’s presence.
“Welcome back boys.” He strode towards Thor, Bruce following a little more cautiously. “That was quick.”
Loki frowned. “You will tell the green monster of my child?” He suddenly sounded awfully protective.
“Does he always talk this dramatically?” Bucky asked Tony, having moved closer to the table at last. Tony didn’t miss the way Steve looked at Bucky, watchful, thoughtful, wondering. There was something pure about the absolute love Tony could see in Steve’s eyes. It made him want to stab his own out with a spork.
“Not that I’m not happy about your buddy getting his memories back,” Scott said, leaning forward to meet Steve’s eyes. “Just a thought, anyone think it may have been a good idea to tell the scary robot dude that we’re bringing a body with us?”
Clint pulled out a mobile. “Huh.” He poked at it. The display lit up and he started scrolling through the contact list. He went white and slumped into a chair.
know that the only way you’re leaving here is in a wheelchair, right?” NurseZilla’s eyebrows could give Pepper’s a run for the money.
Pierce shook his head a little. “Our enemies are your enemies, Nick. Disorder, war. It's just a matter of time before a dirty bomb goes off in Moscow, or an EMP fries Chicago. Diplomacy? Holding action, a Band-Aid. And you know where I learned that; Bogota. You didn't ask, you just did what had to be done. I can bring order to the lives of seven billion people by sacrificing twenty million. It's the next step, Nick, if you have the courage to take it.”
Steve’s gaze flew to where Vision hovered in the air outside the tower. He wanted to yell at him, demand to be told what had happened.
“What is it?” He knew she didn’t talk to him unless she had to. He thought maybe he’d offended her sometime.
“Read it,” Steve gritted. Tony was going to pay for that. And it would mostly be fun for both of them.
Wanda was the one who replied. “The world is eating itself from the inside out. We need to act quickly.”
Coulson ended the call he’d been on for the past half an hour. “Director Fury has asked that we all come in,” he said. “You two as well.” He nodded at Sam and Dean.
“Shut up.” There was a smirk on Clint’s face. “I see that despite no longer being an Avenger, you’ve still managed to get yourself into trouble.”
He glared at all of them, visibly put-out. “Apparently Pepper and my new AI have been colluding behind my back. Again.” He seemed clearly frustrated that he couldn’t get the source of his irritation in his hands. “Stark Tower has been reopened since yesterday.”
Steve glared at him a little. And sighed, slumping against Tony. “Apparently we're heading up into space to steal one of the Infinity Gems from a person called the Collector.” He looked at Rhodey and the others. “And we thought things were crazy when we had to deal with a sentient robot lifting a city out of the ground?”
“They said their name was Winchester,” Bruce said. “The older one, Dean, told me to give you this.” He handed Tony a bag full of hundreds. “He said something about interest added?”
Rhodey made a disgruntled noise. “Nice, dickhead, way to remind me how utterly fucking useless I am.”
Steve moved closer. “I think both Bucky and I have had a lifetime of experiments,” he said. “We’d both feel a lot happier if we knew what was going to happen.” He met Bucky’s gaze. “It’s not that we don’t trust you, Bruce.”
“I was always fucked,” Bucky said bluntly. “Unless they needed me to fuck a woman, they always made me the one who was fucked.”
“Some small part of me cared a little, I suppose,” Wanda admitted. “But I had a goal, Captain. I had a mission. Zemo was not the only one working on breaking the Avengers apart.”
“Leprechauns are indeed real.” Thor rolled his shoulders. “Lady Widow, you should be careful not to incur their wrath. I have heard stories of their terrible rage.”
“It got better,” Steve said with a little grin. “Little man in a big suit turned out to be the biggest personality I’d ever met. I didn’t know what to do with you, how to handle you.”
“Loki.” Thor just seemed exhausted and hopeless suddenly. Tony never wanted to see that expression on Thor's face again. It had no place on that face.
Thor leaned over and gave him a helpful pat on the back that almost tossed Tony off the chair. “Has our noble Captain not made his move?” he asked. “He has expressed several times his admiration for your form.”
Tony snorted. “I’ve missed you, Captain Sasspants.” And he had. Apart from Pepper and Happy, Steve had been the person Tony had spent the most time with once the Avengers had moved in together.
Steve, and everyone else, was astonished when Bruce just lunged at Tony, clinging to him. Tony patted him on the back, eyes wildly meeting Rhodes’.
him?” Tony suggested with a wink. Steve pulled an unimpressed face. Tony threw his hands up. “Okay, so anyone else have any bright ideas?”
Steve reached out blindly, grabbing at Tony’s shoulder, and pulling him in. “You…” he said, voice breaking. “You gave him back to me.”
Loki when it came to Thor. Tony sometimes wondered just how close the brothers actually were. That way lay madness and brain-scrubbing.
“Jörmungandr was a great help.” He met Loki’s gaze. “Once I told him of the consequences of his actions, he wanted to help right away.”
Barnes stared into the swirling amber liquid in his hand. “I…” He looked up at Tony then and it was all Tony could do not to recoil. The endless agony in those eyes was more than anyone should have to bear.
“Slow your roll, Julia,” Tony said. Natasha hid a quick smirk when Clint seemed like he wanted to stab Tony with one of his arrows. “I think we’re all missing the point here. Our gifted mind-bender says that Loki believes the crap about the big-ass snake eating the world and destroying Asgard.”
Her eyes narrowed. “Maybe we’ll all get lucky and you’ll die down there. Then nobody has to make an effort.”
“Stop with the chatter, all of you.” Steve couldn't bear it anymore. He was tired and angry and confused. He wanted to talk to Tony and figure out what the hell was going on with him.
“Fucking grandstanding showoff asshole,” Clint declared in mock disgust. “You’ve been waiting for the right moment to make your grand entrance, haven’t you?”
A little while later, after an incredibly awkward discussion about Pepper, as well as the usual Howard comparison, Tony said, “Oh, really? You two knew each other? He never mentioned that. Maybe only a thousand times. God, I hated you.”
And as for Wanda Maximoff, frankly, she terrified him. Since Pietro’s death she’d had little concern for her own health. She took risks and Steve wondered if she would survive without her twin.
Steve stared at him like he had two heads. “Oh God, Tony! Every time. Every time I think you see things the right way…”
Tony went into full-fledged panic. He could practically hear the warning bells clamoring in the back of his mind. “Don’t ask me shit, Bruce. I can’t. I’m already fucking with the timeline.” He stopped. “Forgetting things that made the shit hit the fan. I need to focus, to stop what happened long before it happens.”
Natasha leaned against Clint. “What about you?” she asked, eyes sharp on him, belying her relaxed demeanor.
She pulled away from Tony and smiled over his shoulder at Steve. “Pepper, Steve. I’ve told you to call me Pepper about a million times.” He gaze slid over to where Bucky stood like a sentinel. “I thought I’d met all of the new Avengers,” she said.
“We’re looking for a Quinjet that crashed in stealth mode.” He headed for the last recorded location of the Hulk-appropriated plane. “Come out, come out, wherever you are,” he sang.
“Did you know that the more uncomfortable you feel, the fancier you speak?” Bucky’s mouth tilted up at the corner. He was a complete asshole, Tony thought. He was crazy about the complete asshole so he wasn’t sure what that said about him.
All hands went up, Dean holding Sam’s floppy arm up as well. “Happy, let’s make a quick stop at Mama’s. I’m feeling the need for some of that deep fried chicken.”
Bucky held up a hand. “Please, don’t finish that. It did something to my head. Fucked me over. It’s why I was unconscious when you saw me.”
“But that’s why I think it could be the power sigil,” Sam said. “The hand is like a puppet master controlling the strings. The serpent is who Set
Bruce took a deep breath and nodded. “Fine, I’ll remind you that you travelled back in time to stop the end of the Avengers.” He sounded weary. “Although I don’t know how you’re planning on getting rid of them.”
“If I still liked dames…” Bucky mused. Tony nodded silent agreement as they pushed the doors open leading to the garden. “Still not sure if Banner is a lucky man or needs therapy,” Bucky added.
Dean turned his head to meet his eyes. “We aren’t just demon hunters,” he said. “We protect humans in other ways.”
Tony was highly skeptical. “Forgive me for doubting you, but Loki is pretty much the dictionary definition of mischief, Thor.”
“What?”  Bruce looked between them all and then up at the skies above Atlantis. “I was surrounded by the finest minds in the world and swapped it for this.”
Steve wanted to keep holding onto Bucky, but he realized that he couldn’t, shouldn’t make his team choose. “It’ll take some time,” he said, nodding to them.
Tony flapped a hand at him. “Hush you, we’re negotiating.” Tony was the best negotiator. “You were saying,” he prompted. Steve groaned and flopped down in Tony’s chair. DUM-E trundled over and offered a sympathetic claw. Steve took it.
“You’re so very human,” Wanda said, that remote gaze turning on Sam. “Not one of you held off in throwing yourself into battle when Tony Stark created the monster. Despite it being of his own making, you all fought beside him. When he attempted to make amends, what did you do then? Follow him? Stand beside him? Defend him?”
Steve shook his head. “Tony.” He sat down in the easy chair opposite her. “Why did you come with us?”
“Just remember who your trainer is, back at HQ,” Natasha said. It sounded like a threat. Steve was pretty sure it was a threat.
Tony pulled a face. “I hate needles, Pep.” The nurse and Pepper ignored him as they strapped him back up to wires and tubes until he looked like something from the Matrix.
“You’re clearly not the gardening type,” Tony told him, patting a huge forearm. “See, once the root starts rotting, the tree dies.”
“Don’t forget the mead,” Steve mumbled into Tony’s shoulder, cuddling closer. “The mead is like Red Bull on crack.”
Tony put his mug down as well. He had a feeling things were going to be broken and not just Pepper’s heart.
Tony sighed, digging back in again and then stopped. “Did anyone let Wilson and Rhodey know that the crisis had passed?” Tony at Steve. “I assume that the mind-control that Set had in place has fallen away?”
“She’d eat your heart for lunch,” Natasha said as she walked in. “Come on, guys. Here’s where it gets interesting.”
“Now that’s some cool shit.” Dean’s drawl had Tony turning around. “Not something you see every day.”
“Yes, he is.” Wanda kept remarkably cool under the pressure of Natasha's furious gaze. “But he thinks. So he's a monster but not a killer.”
Wanda’s face had grown increasingly worried. “Please, do not blame Vision. I was the one who…” Vision’s gentle hand on hers shut her up.
Sorry it's so short! I promise there is more substance to the next one. I have 5 kittens in the house and I'm sure none of you would blame me for wanting to play with them rather than write for you.
Jim stopped moving, every muscle in his body frozen. “Don’t you fucking talk to me about being too chicken shit to face Steve,” he snarled. “We both know that’s hypocritical.”
Natasha stalked towards him, growling under her breath in Russian. Thor gave a high-pitched shriek when she grabbed his balls in her hand, twisting viciously. “Я тебе яйца оторву!”
“How long are you guys still going to be?” Steve asked instead. “With your,” he waved a hand, “science-y stuff?”
“What?” Steve didn’t like this new information and it showed in the timbre of his voice. “You didn’t say anything about killing.”
Scott came over with a glass of water. “Small sips,” he instructed, shoving the glass into Steve’s hand. “I’ve had some experience with anxiety attacks.”
“You have a lot of money,” Bruce reminded him. “You need to find a way to stop S.H.I.E.L.D. using the Other Guy.” Bruce shook his head. “I come back as Bruce Banner. No more Hulk. I can’t do it again.”
Bucky shrugged. “Honestly? I have no fucking idea,” he confessed. “I just know that he let me stay here, no questions asked.” Then he laughed. “Well, it
Tony kissed him quickly, skipping out of Steve’s reach with a gleeful cackle. “Because you love me,” he sang. “I am the wind beneath your wings.”
Steve knew his smile was a little wobbly. “He’s the only link I have left of my life before. He’s the only one who loved me when I wasn’t Captain America.” His arms tightened. “I’d do anything to keep him safe.”
“That’s not what I was going to say,” Steve muttered. “I wanted to say that I didn’t mean to kiss you without your permission. That was rude.”
Rhodey sighed. “The President has requested the assistance of the Avengers in the Nuclear Disarmament Program with Iraq.”
Tony tries not to make choices for others. Steve gets a few home truths from the king. Family isn't always blood. Trust isn't always rewarded. Betrayal can sometimes blind-side you.
“Fuck you, Steve.” Bucky’s tone was venomous. “Fuck you. You are being so disrespectful right now, not just to me, but to Tony as well. Fuck. You.” He spun on his heel and stalked towards the house.
Thor frowned. “I must admit my puzzlement grows,” he said. “It appears to be an unassuming piece of jewelry.”
He sucked in a breath. “That stupid kid from Brooklyn was left to die and then forcibly brain-washed by enemies of democracy for over seventy years. And he
Tony watched Ross’ eyes moving from side to side, searching out an avenue of escape. “The way I see it, you have two choices,” he told Ross.
“Neither could I,” Steve whispered into his hair, his heart breaking at the thought of how awfully, completely, utterly they’d failed. Even though they’d stood together, it hadn’t been enough.
“Steve, you are not responsible for the decisions every person on earth makes.” Natasha sounded impatient. “Now step down off that cross and help us figure out what to do next.”
“I think that Tony doesn’t do anything without a reason,” Steve said. “I mean, he sent me my shield and the system for Bucky….” He swallowed hard. “What are the other numbers in there?”
Bruce just looked at him from under lowered brows. “The last time you had a scepter in your hand, it didn’t go so well.”
“I bring Pop Tarts!” Thor declared, proudly displaying a plate piled high with various flavor options.
Clint was the first of the original team to arrive, eyes haunted and bleak. Tony took one look at him and pulled him into a hug. “I’m sorry.” He’d forgotten. This was just after Laura and the kids had been killed by Rumlow and the last tendrils of the Hydra beast.
“I didn’t know,” he said quietly. The snort from his left told him what Tony thought about that. “Not for sure,” he insisted. “Zola intimated that your parents had been killed by one of the Winter Soldiers. I didn’t know about Bucky then.”
Natasha’s expression was enough to shrivel a lesser man to ash. Barton was obviously made of something indestructible, Steve thought. He was still standing.
Before anyone could react to this, the other woman stepped in front of her. “My name is Carol Danvers. I’m from Earth and I think you should listen to her.”
, a hero and should be treated as such.” He held up a hand when he could see arguments forming. “You have to know that I, of anyone in this room except perhaps King T’Challa, have cause to be righteously angry with the Winter Soldier. And I am. But that isn’t the man who left with Captain Rogers.”
“Get your metal ass back there,” Steve yelled at him, swinging his fists and sending bodies tumbling. “Perform the fucking spell so that we can fucking
Clint shrugged. “Anyone messing with my head makes me antsy. She tried it once before but thanks to lessons learned, care of Loki, asshole brother of Thor, I was prepared. Not so much this time.”
Steve found his voice then. “What was it?” Wanda turned those strange eyes on him. “What was he afraid of?”
He began to turn around but stopped when Vision stepped up to his shoulder. “I’m sorry,” Steve said. “That wasn’t a conversation you were meant to hear.”
“Ah, my faithful steed,” he crooned. “Ready to carry me off to my next adventure?” Tony knew he was avoiding thinking about the Steve/Bucky situation. He also knew that the Steve/Bucky situation was more than likely on its way to him.
Strange got to his feet. “Yggdrasil has agreed to allow you to reverse the spell, Tony.” His pupils were milky white. “She does not want to be the cause of Ragnarök.” He blinked and his eyes returned to their normal dark brown. “I suggest you get to work.”
“And so you should be,” she retorted, a little choked up. “Now, thanks to you, I have to fix my make-up before our unwanted guests arrive.” She stepped back, poking Tony in the chest. “Sleep. That’s an order, by the way.”
Tony’s laugh was a horribly bitter thing. “Forgive me if I’m skeptical. I learned my lesson the hard way.”
Thor, Rhodey, Natasha and Barton were just siting watching Scott, Bruce and Tony go back and forth, speaking a language that none of them could follow.
“When you first got here, Mr. Stark scanned you for various foreign bodies, including nanites,” F.R.I.D.A.Y. said. “It would appear that the Hydra organization infected you with microscopic explosives.” She sounded apologetic. “Mr. Stark managed to disable many of them with his magnetic technology.”
Bruce gave him another unimpressed look. “You really need to keep fact separated from fiction, Tony.”
The command chair lit up like the Fourth of July, lights flashing on and off in rapidly increasing Morse code that Steve tried to follow.
Tony decided that subtlety have never been his strong suit anyway. “I want you to give Phil Coulson back.”
Thor took that moment of confusion to wrap him in his brawny arms and say to the doctor. “Perhaps a sedative might be the best thing until we can mend our friend, Dr. Banner?”
Steve was too busy scraping his jaw off the floor. “He’s just standing there,” he said. “Not roaring or freaking out. Just standing there.”
He walked out of the United Nations with the five people he trusted the most in the world. The sixth was somewhere in Africa, hopefully kicking some sense into certain people. Not that he cared.
Cooper tilted his head to the side as he studied Clint. “He can’t leave?” He wasn’t going to be distracted.
“Dean!” Tony exclaimed. “We should get Dean to be the guy you two pick up to prove who has the most game!” He hadn’t forgotten their conversation from a couple of days ago.
!” The rage in her voice was a palpable thing. Everyone took a breath. “I don’t tolerate cowards who run from their commitments.”
Tony caught a glimpse of Steve’s worried face before the door slid closed behind him. He saw that the second door had swished open and stepped forward.
Tony gawked at Steve. “Rude?” He tried to wrap his head around the fact that apparently Steve Rogers had
Steve went to him, wrapping him in his arms. “Bruce won't let anything happen to you,” he promised, praying that he was right.
“Not to worry,” Tony said, suiting up completely. “The others have arrived and are most likely in a Quinjet so your transportation is taken care of.”
Rhodes shook his head. “I just know it’s going to end badly and then I’ll get stuck with the fallout. Again.”
Buck took Tony’s glass from his hand and put it on the table. “Besides, apart from the nurses and a couple of lieutenants at home base, there weren’t many ladies in the army. So we had to get ourselves off somehow.”
Bucky just glared at him. It was pretty effective. Clearly the evil eye was all part of the army boy makeup, Tony thought. Steve did that really well too.
“Broke up?” Bruce looked even more bewildered. “Like a band? Like The Beatles?” Sam’s snicker was not helpful.
“And then Alexander Pierce and Hydra happened,” Tony said. “And you started keeping secrets from me.”
“Tony….” Bruce sounded as though he was on his very last nerve. And an angry Bruce wasn’t a pretty thing..
It was much later, after the laughter and relief at having managed to avert an apocalypse, that Tony allowed Steve to lead him to their suite. They had a suite, a place that he and Tony had built together.
“Aaaanyway.” Tony swung back to the assembly. “So B.A.R.F. is a little thing I’ve been working on for a while. It stands for Binarily Augmented Retro Framing.”
Tony looked chagrined that he’d met someone who could out-asshole him. “I drank ambrosia when I was in Mímir's ell,” he said eventually. When none of them responded he huffed out a breath. “Am-bro-zee-aah.” He tilted his head to the side, obviously waiting for them to catch a clue.
“If he did, the world would end,” Tony agreed. He started a search for Barton, trying to determine his location.
“I’m thinking that the mark these people carry aren’t just proof that they’re acolytes,” Sam said, clearly wanting to keep things civil.
“The Vision?” Tony made sure the question was asked in audible air quotes. “Seriously, J? That’s what you’re going with?”
The first touch of Bucky’s mouth against his hole had Tony arching up on the bed. Steve’s big arms wrapped around him from behind. “Fuck!” Tony gasped for air. Being held down was apparently a thing for Tony too.
Of course, as soon as his eyes closed, the images of Tony and Bucky popped into his head. He’d kissed Bucky so he knew what his mouth tasted like. He’d tasted like sunlight and peppermint. Bucky had always loved peppermints, and that seemed to have lasted through whatever crap Hydra had done to him.
“Yeah, Buck?” He tried not to breathe the words into Bucky's skin. He’d been rejected. He respected that.
“The only thing Bruce is going to need is mouth to mouth.” Pepper accepted Rhodey’s help down from the microwave unit and poked a long finger in Tony’s chest. “Don’t fuck this up for him.”
Ice and snow punched through the air, arcing up and out of the slash in the ground. The huge figure that flew up in the middle of it made Tony shake. He wondered idly what Frost Giants ate. He’d make sure it tried Kentucky Fried Sorcerer first.
Bucky straightened up, evidently used to the sound of command. Tony was both aroused and appalled. He was however, very naked so, sadly, his arousal showed.
had better get fucked,” Tony groused as Steve moved away from the window, easily carrying him across the room to the bed. “This erection shouldn’t go to waste.”
The blinding smile he got in return took him aback. “You are the bad cop, yes?” Pietro patted his arm. “So Tony, he’s the good cop?”
Bruce rubbed at his eyes. “Tony, the last time we had ‘fun’ together we created a murderbot that wanted to destroy humanity.”
“Yeah?” Tony gave an unconcerned shrug. He wasn’t going to let the Blue Man Crew freak him out. “I think your tree likes me.” He was thinking about adding a … “everyone likes me” to the end of that statement the fact that the Frost Giants still appeared in shock had him holding his tongue.
“How about why you didn’t trust us?” Rhodes asked, going laser-sharp for the heart of the matter. “I mean, we were your team, right?”
“Was his blood purple?” Tony asked, because really, the important things. He ignored Steve’s disapproving glare.
Tony wanted to ask someone to pinch him because there was no way in hell that Steve Rogers, paragon of American virtue, had just kissed him. “Do it again.” That wasn’t what he wanted to say.
“Yeah?” Tony croaked, aroused all over again at the thought. “How old were you?” He didn’t think that Steve was even aware of his nudity, or that his hand was idly drawing circles on Tony’s thigh.
Steve glowered at Bruce. “A little bit of information upfront would have been appreciated, Doctor Banner.”
Bucky was currently not in the building. “What’s going on?” he asked Bruce, worried about Bucky’s lack of response.
“Just read it when we get to the Cage,” Steve told him, stepping into the ink-dark tunnel. “I’m sick of this place.”
“Man, it stinks in here.” Clint made a gagging noise. “It’s like chlorine had a baby with electricity and it all went wrong.”
“Hi,” Tony replied, bringing his arms around Steve’s waist. “You look happy to see me.” He waggled his eyebrows obnoxiously.
“I’m trying to make sense of this,” Clint said, frustrated fingers running through his hair. “What she’s saying, it sounds like a bunch of woo-woo magic crap, and while we’ve seen some crazy shit in our time here, I still believe that it’s all based on science.”
Bruce interrupted Vision. “What if the ocean is Asgard and the sky is Earth and the snake is…?” Bruce said, looking only at Tony.
“We have all of us been through terrible things,” she said. “From the monster to the captain, we are all broken inside.”
“I’m still programmed to respond to Ms. Potts’ enquiries, sir,” F.R.I.D.A.Y. replied. She didn’t sound sorry at all.
Tony watched Cooper stare at his father. He saw the face of a scared little boy who’d been let down by the most important person in his life. He knew just how that felt.
Tony pressed a kiss to Nate’s head, breathing in the unmistakable smell of baby. “Clint is an idiot. We’ve established this over several bottles of exceptional red wine. But he isn’t a traitor.” He pondered his words in a way that he wouldn’t have done before everything fell apart. “He’s not made to be a farmer. A civilian. He’s made to do good, to make changes in the world. I don’t think any of us thought about the results of him standing down from the Avengers.”
Steve relished the quiet. It sometimes felt like this bright new world he'd woken up in was constantly filled with noise.
“While I’m thrilled at the prospect of you three finding true love, we have bigger issues to deal with.” Bruce stood at the door.
Tony laughed harder. “Legendary, huh?” He had a joke about that, he really did, but just then Bucky licked at the head of his cock as though it was the best sort of lollipop. Tony’s hand slackened, dropping away from Steve to gape at Bucky.
When the SRA had been drafted, Steve hadn’t found Bucky yet. Bruce was wrong. Tony remembered now that Bruce hadn’t been here for the start of it all. He’d been hiding in a jungle in Borneo or somewhere equally remote. By the time Bruce had come back to New York, the SRA was already in motion.
“I knew you wanted to see Steve,” he said, keeping his gaze away from where Steve was unashamedly listening in. “I saw how happy you were.”
Laura and Pepper exchanged a look. Tony had learned to fear the collaboration of the two women in his life.
“He’s got that look on his face again.” Bucky’s voice brought him back to the present. He blinked again, admiring how they looked together.
“My name is Nebula and Thanos murdered my sister. I am bound to avenge her death.” There was something in those eyes that reminded Tony a little of Vision.
“I’ve been in pain my entire life, Steve. Just once, I want to hurt for a good reason. Fuck me so that I’ll be able to feel you inside me for days.” Tony kept his gaze very steady, wanting Steve to see that he meant every word.
Steve wanted to protest, insist, but Scott came barreling into the library with a yell. “You guys! You have got to see this!” And ran out as quickly as he’d arrived.
Loki looked around the room, cool eyes and assessing gaze. “For a Midgardian home, this is acceptable,” he noted.
They were standing on the edge of a slab of stone with an extremely narrow bridge spanning the gorge below. Tony looked down. “That’s more like it,” he muttered when he saw the bubbling lava.
“Home, sweet home,” Clint crowed, bending down to kiss the landing platform. Tony ignored the idiot.
“It’s one of your more endearing habits,” Pepper told him. “At least we always know what’s going on in your head.”
“Too long,” Bucky said, dropping his head onto Tony’s shoulder. “I don’t deal well when the people I lo...care about go on missions without me.” Steve didn’t miss the slip. Bucky was still not used to talking about his emotions.
“Any reason that happened?” Steve’s question was too studiedly casual. He was incapable of subtlety. Captain America was the actual opposite of subtle.
Bucky grinned. “Don’t try to pretend you don’t dig a little crazy, Steve. I mean, look at who you chose for a best friend.” Steve glared at him. He was surrounded by cocky assholes.
Pepper pulled away, tugging at her hair and clothes. “We hitched a ride,” she said with a warning glare at Rhodey.
“You should have told him about Barnes.” Rhodes’ started the jet’s descent. “That was the worst thing you could have done to him.”
And that small hesitation, that correction was the truth that Steve really didn’t want to face. “We’re still a team,” he said.
A hand touched his shoulder. “I’m so glad I found you, Tony.” His newly non-existent heart was apparently having some kind of emotions.
“So that leaves one of the three of us,” Natasha said, looking at Bucky and Clint. “Should we settle this the old-fashioned way?”
Bucky muttered something anatomically impossible against Tony’s skin. “Later,” Tony assured him. “Now move that gorgeous ass and let’s get this over with.” He swatted at Bucky while trying to disengage from Steve’s arms. “Good lord, you
not even that bad.” Tony inhaled the coffee in almost one swallow. He still needed to figure out a way to do this intravenously.
Tony had never been more proud of anyone. Bruce stood there, threw it all down, his soul bleeding on the cold stone floor, and told the world about the atrocities he’d endured. He didn’t try to mitigate his own errors in judgment. He spoke openly, honestly and they listened.
When they'd first met, Tony had pushed and prodded at him with words, the way he'd prodded Bruce with the tazer pen. Tony still had a habit of poking at things, like a bruise that wouldn't heal.
Steve couldn’t stop himself. He leaned forward and kissed Tony softly. The gasp that escaped him was soft and wondering. “Stop making like you didn’t have something to do with this,” Steve told him. “You know what you did for him.”
“Seems like he can be a bit of a pain in the ass,” Sam said. He was the least acquainted with the peculiar wonder that was Tony Stark.
“Maybe,” Tony agreed, “I am however right, and will be thinking long and hard about my winnings.” His eyes twinkled as he waggled his eyebrows at Steve. “Just thinking about what to ask for.”
Tony pointed at him. “Thank you for asking. Now, to avoid the risk of me devolving into geek-speak, I’ve prepared Vision to give you a visual demonstration.” He nodded at Vision. “Viz, hit it.”
“Uh,” Sam said, cheeks a little pink. “If you mean that big piece of metal hanging off your belt, then yeah, I picked it up. It felt good in my hands.”
Laura kissed his cheek. “You don’t fool me, Stark. You’d lie on a bomb for this nutbag family you’ve collected.” She maneuvered Nate into her arms, careful not to wake him. “I hope you’re going to make them grovel.”
“And that is way more than I ever needed to know,” Rhodey said, coming into the room with Sam and Bruce at his heels. They carried several loaded trays with plates, cutlery and steaming bowls of pasta and sauce that made Steve’s stomach grumble. “I’m begging you, my eyes and ears can’t deal with the special level of nutjob that the three of you together are sure to be.”
“Captain, I assume that you are not alone?” Steve waved them into his room, Scott and Natasha slipping in behind them.
“Clint, the last time you followed me almost cost you your marriage, your children,” Steve said. “I won’t do that to them again.”
“Then it surely has some insight on our plight!” Thor looked like he wanted to fly directly to the source.
“Sir, Captain Rogers is requesting entrance.” J.A.R.V.I.S. had the slightest hint of disapproval in his voice. F.R.I.D.A.Y. had clearly been tattle-tailing.
Pepper folded her arms. “This is not new information, Tony. I’ve always known who and what you are.” She sat down at the table. “What’s this really about?”
Vision’s cool gaze moved back to her and Steve felt it as a physical slap. “Mr. Stark has spent months attempting to make the units smaller and more portable. What you have in here is a prototype.” He looked at Steve. “And a few other items.”
“Well, it’s either Barnes or you’re cuddling a murderous psychopath,” Clint drawled. His hand was tight on his bow. Steve looked over at Natasha and saw that both hands held weapons.
“Is Asgard safe?” Loki’s mouth was set and he shook minutely. Thor put his hand on Loki’s shoulder, silent comfort offered.
Peggy waggled her fingers at him. “This is your chance, your choice, Tony Stark. Do you accept your fate and die here today, possibly to Ascend to the next plane of existence?”
“Okay,” Coulson said. “So how much do you remember of the future now, and have you made any major changes since you got back?”
Loki began laughing. ‘Oh gods, this is utterly perfect!” He ignored Thor’s angry glare and took a step towards Tony. “How is it possible?”
“You’re all hilarious,” Steve told them, grabbing Tony’s hand. “We’ll see you later.” He towed Tony behind him, heading for the elevators with Bucky bringing up the rear.
Lila and Cooper moved to Laura’s side immediately, edging a little behind her, distress on their faces.
Bucky handed him a full glass. Tony wondered if he was trying to get him drunk. “You were a dick to Steve,” Bucky said, flopping down next to Tony.
Tony beamed at him, fingers scrabbling at Steve’s shirt. “I have trained you well, my son,” he crooned.
Bucky wiped his nose with the back of his hand. “Like you'd ever back off, even if I asked,” he scoffed. He didn't sound mad at the thought.
Clint went to sit by Natasha and Bruce. “Now that we’re together, I have a request.” Because it was Clint, because of what he was going through, Tony reckoned they’d do almost anything to help.
And just like that, Tony gathered the shredded pieces of his heart together, and shut everything out. Steve could practically see the walls slam down. It was more than a little chilling.
“No-one!” Tony hastened to assure him. “I checked. No deaths, just some maim...injuries.” He tried for a smile. “Stark Industries took care of it.”
He leaned his forehead against the glass. “God, Steve. What do I say to them? How do I get through this? How do we do this without you?”
The Mind Stone popped out of Vision’s forehead, a boom of power laying them all flat. When Tony could focus again, it was to see Vision’s body lying on the floor, unmoving. “Viz?” he whispered. He crawled over to where Vision lay, body cold as always, but the spark of life so very obviously gone.
“Right here, Stevie,” Bucky whispered, bending carefully at the waist so that his body didn’t touch Steve’s. Tony saw Steve’s breathing hitch as Bucky pressed the softest of kisses to Steve’s mouth.
Tony cracked up. He couldn’t help it. He didn’t know how it had been possible to be without this, without them, for a week, let alone a year.
“Hey!” Tony was feeling picked-on. “How about a little defending of the honor here, you two?” He glowered at Steve and Bucky.
Steve nodded. “You keep telling yourself that.” He put the pen down. “I’d hate to break up the set.” That sarcastic, dismissive sentence shredded the last of Tony’s compassion.
Steve bit his lip as Natasha followed them. “That makes no sense,” she frowned. “Leprechauns are not real.”
Bucky sucked in a breath and stalked towards Steve, pulling off his clothes as he walked. “Fuckin’ tease,” he growled.
“Do you want to take this somewhere more private?” Steve asked, the hopeful tone belied by the heat in his gaze.
“Please, just stop,” Clint begged from the pilot’s seat. “I need brain bleach for this entire conversation.”
Tony nodded. “Ditto.” While he was all for meeting new people, he had a feeling that the Winchesters would be an entirely new level of insane.
Steve clenched his fists. “Then why the hell did you let Tony go?” he demanded. “If it was a suicide mission, why did you act like it was going to work?” He wanted to put a fist through something. Right now, Bruce’s big green Hulk face was an appealing prospect.
“Wanda.” Vision's calm tone had her looking at him. “I am well. Please, do not upset yourself further.”
“Okay.” Steve was numb. “Thank you for giving us sanctuary, your Majesty. You have been a true friend when we had none.”
Steve swallowed hard. “Because I betrayed mine and I’m trying to figure out why, after what I did, you didn’t hand us over to Ross.”
Steve’s phone rang. “It’s Falcon,” he told them when he looked at the display. “I’m going to take this.” He walked to the balcony with the phone at his ear.
Steve scrutinized him carefully. It seemed as though he’d come to some sort of conclusion as he stepped out of the shower, Tony still in his arms. The feeling of Steve’s cock pushing against him with every step had Tony making noises he was sure he’d be embarrassed about if he actually gave a shit.
Tony felt the damp warmth of tears. He wondered who she was crying for. “I’m sorry.” He had the feeling that he’d be saying that a lot today.
Tony narrowed his eyes at him and stepped reluctantly towards the thing that was totally a bucket. “Fuck my life,” he mumbled. He climbed into the ‘bucket’ and sat down. He only had a mild freak-out when he starting going up towards the gap in the dome.
“Meddling with time is something my father would not approve of,” Thor rumbled. He sighed. “But the All-Father is no longer with us, so I suppose it is no matter.”
Tony turned in Steve’s arms, buried his head in Steve’s neck. “I couldn’t stop him.” Steve felt the suit groan beneath his clutching hands.
“And they do?” Bruce asked. “I mean, inter-dimensional wanna-be demon gods aren’t exactly anyone’s milieu.” Tony loved that Bruce used words like ‘milieu’ when he talked. It made Hulk’s grunting even more entertaining.
“We need to make this right.” It was Sam who voiced what they were all thinking. Sam, who had trusted Steve, followed him because they were brothers in arms in more ways than one.
“So have we.” Natasha’s voice was fairly neutral. But her hand came out and rested on Steve’s head. “Tony used to have them.”
Bucky’s hand squeezed his shoulder. “Shut up, Stevie, I’m about done with this crap.” He moved to the seat that Laura had vacated, beside Steve. Tony mouthed ‘Stevie’ at him with a smirk and a raised eyebrow.
“What?” Tony felt aggrieved. “I was just putting Tall, Dark and Slinky over there in his place.” He pointed at Loki. Who seemed delighted with his new moniker.
“Well, technically, DUM-E isn’t a robot.” Tony skipped after Sam, clapping him on the back. “He’s a rudimentary AI so he’s a little better than that.” Tony’s heart was light, despite the prospect of the end of the world. He was a ‘happy now, worry about tomorrow later’ kinda guy. He was looking forward to a whole truckload of happy.
He flew away from the Cage, slightly disappointed at how anti-climactic it felt. At least he had a good old-fashioned battle to look forward to. “Did you miss me?” he asked Steve as he shot at a particularly gruesome troll-like beast that was trying to decapitate Bucky.
“Who are you and what do you want with my Bruce?” Tony stepped in front of Bruce as he began to move towards her.
“Huh,” Tony said. “Is that true?” he asked Atlantis. The walls pulsated blue and red and then red and gold. It was answer enough. “We’re going to have to set some boundaries, you know that, right Peggy?”
Steve remembered those days on the run, him, Sam, Natasha, when they'd all thought that Fury was dead. His faking his death had cost him Natasha's trust. Steve wondered if Fury knew that. If he cared.
“Look,” Scott said, “We go back, we get the stones before Thanos gets them. Thanos doesn't have the stones. Problem solved.” He gave them jazz hands.
If there was anyone that Tony wanted to share his time-travelling experience with, it was Bruce. But until he knew the future consequences he’d hold his tongue. “Aw, you came for a play-date,” Tony crooned, tugging Bruce towards his workbench. “Let me share with you the treasures of my knowledge.”
“Dr. Banner is in his laboratory,” Vision said, ignoring the friendly overture. “Allow me to guide you to your quarters in the East Wing.” He floated away in that eerie glide that Steve hadn’t realized how much he’d missed.
Steve and Tony are still at detente. But someone familiar arrives to shake things up and maybe make them all realise that they're not as broken as they think they are.
The knock on the door of the lab took them all by surprise. Tony didn’t even have to look around to know who it was. His spidey sense was tingling.
Loki put a hand to his forehead like some Victorian maiden with the vapors. “I don’t know how you can stand being around such stupidity all day, brother.”
Thor nodded. “The last time our father slept the Odinsleep, it was several millennia before he woke.” He grimaced. “I would be happier if he were to awaken in his own home.”
“Don’t count Tony out,” Rhodey said. He helped himself to some coffee. “That sonofabitch has managed to pull off some of the craziest stunts I’ve ever seen.”
“Someone like?” Bucky got up, restless in a way that Tony hadn’t noticed before. And maybe it was due to the drugs that Hydra had plunged into his blood, but Bucky sometimes reminded him of an animal bred to kill.
Tony shook his head. “Not my field of expertise. But I have a friend who….” He thought of mad, sad Bruce. “I’ll have to try find him, but he’s the one who can help you with that.”
“Vision said that he’d managed to upload your matrix onto the mainframe,” Tony said. “How did he manage to separate your synapses from his?”
Bucky’s mouth went tight and Bruce’s eyes glowed a startling green. Steve hurried on, “She told me that no matter how bad things were, the darkest hour has only sixty minutes.” He smiled. “So it would pass.”
“Hand on the Bible, swear to God, I’m not,” Steve said. “All I’m asking for is a chance to prove that I can be the person you hoped I was when I was thawed from the ice.”
“Woo-woo isn’t strictly a twenty-first century term,” Steve said with a small smile. “The arm looks great, by the way.”
Steve found him a day or two after their abysmal performance, the last hurrah of the once-mighty Avengers. “I wanted to tell you first,” he began.
Tony nodded. “Ready to try it on?” He reached behind him, letting Jim change the subject. He’d make up his own mind. Tony could use the back-up with Steve though. He had no idea what he’d say to Steve if he asked him outright about Jim.
“We Russians aren’t really the most positive people in the world,” Natasha said as they pushed the door to the training area open. “But, it is good to think that we might have a chance.”
Thor’s departure left them all sitting (and standing) around feeling a little aimless. “Anyone want Chinese?” Tony asked. When in doubt, eat. It was a motto that had served him well over the years.
Bruce swallowed hard. “Tony says I've already got more control. He said the two greatest minds in the world should be able to figure something out.”
managed to break through the conditioning on his own. I don’t care what else to want changed. Well, I mean I do, but Bucky Barnes
“Are you saying that you think your brother was somehow trying to communicate with you?” Clint sounded as skeptical as Steve felt.
He looked across the room, saw a door. Meeting Crowley’s gaze he motioned towards it. “Almost there.”
“What are you doing here?” Bruce didn't sound like he was happy about it either. Tony’s presence should always elicit joy. He decided not to poke the bear, as it were. Discretion being the better part of valor. Tony could totally be discreet.
Steve’s arms were a fairly clear barometer of Steve’s feelings. Right now, he was determined. Tony had to get him off this topic. “I needed some time to myself,” he said. “It was more difficult than I thought it would be.”
He shook his head. He couldn’t let that thinking take over again. That’s where he’d messed up the first time around. But it was harder to remember the future. He reminded himself of the hot rush of Steve’s blood over his hands and focused on Bruce’s distraught expression.
“Who did it?” Dean growled. He was clearly itching to go out and destroy someone. A man after his own heart then, Tony thought.
“I lost the kid,” Tony told him, as though Steve hadn’t been there, watching as yet another person that Tony loved was taken away from him.
The cool dark green of the trees quickly enveloped him. He stopped, hopped off the scooter and had the armor on a second later. He lifted off a couple of feet into the air, scanning the area.
Natasha and Wanda were on the balcony, still fully dressed apart from their shoes. They’d each appropriated one of the loungers in the pool and were drifting across the water, tied together by what appeared to be Wanda’s belt.
“Back to the plan,” Sam said, his kaleidoscope eyes twinkling with laughter, “Any of you happen to know a vampire or a werewolf?”
“You can take one of us over with you.’ Steve’s jaw was set in that delightfully mulish way that made Tony want to kick his ass.
“Asshole, what part of hands-off the merchandise are you not getting?” He propped his fists on his hips as he stared down at him.
On the screen, Bruce was discussing how the creation of the Abomination had come about and everyone was gasping. None of the politicians had known just what an obsessed lunatic Ross had become. Nat hadn’t trusted him, apparently, neither had Tony, not really. But Tony had tried to take Ross on alone and that had led to the splinter of the Avengers.
The noise swept in like a tsunami all at once, overwhelming Tony as shouts and sobs and sirens blared as reporters filmed the event.
“I don’t understand that reference,” Steve said. “But I do agree with Tony.” Halle-fucking-lujah, Tony thought. “You can’t be trusted to recognize Loki.”
“We’re not going to mess with your place,” Dean replied, missing Steve and Sam’s interaction. “We just want to make sure the head dick can’t get out.”
“Here's something nobody knew,” Tony said, changing the subject with his usual cunning. “Captain Fantastic is playing for both teams.” He looked up at Bruce expectantly.
Steve stalked into the training arena, mind whirling. He saw Natasha, waved her over. Rhodey looked way too pleased to be left alone. He bent over at the waist, gasping. Sam laughed at him. They were getting better.
“Yes,” Vision said, moving closer. “But perhaps you could…” He pointed at one section of the formula.
“I like your dick attached to your body, Stark,” Bucky told him with a grin. “Stop provoking the pretty lady.”
Steve gave a chuckle. “That is Loki, Thor’s brother, otherwise known as Matilda the Jotun cat thing that bit you.”
Tony lifted a hand, tugging at Steve’s hand on his shoulder. He twisted their fingers together as he dropped his chin to Bucky’s shoulder. “He gave himself back to us, Cap.” His smile was fond and his eyes were so very kind.
Steve pressed his lips together. “He’ll forgive you all,” he said, sure of his words. “You were following me. Tony’s a good man. A generous man. He won’t hold it against you.”
Tony wanted to jump over the back of the sofa screaming “Hell to the fuck no!” but he sat, fists clenched. “No, thank you.” He managed to sound polite. That was impressive.
“And that means what, Captain Cryptic?” Clint asked. His arms were folded across his chest and his chin jutted out.
“How about that,” Tony mused, amazed and delighted. He stopped. “But you said that I’m dying,” he remembered.
“Ow.” Bruce righted himself, meeting Natasha's eyes. “First one's for free. Second time, I bring in reinforcements.”
She moved her hand from his arm. “For being an asshole,” she replied. “You’re not going to find out anything if you don’t get down there, Steve.” She sounded so kind. As though she knew he was freaking out.
“The thing!” Rhodey pointed between Tony and Bruce. “That they talked about and never told us about.”
Richards looked like he wanted to argue, but whatever he saw in Xavier’s eyes shut him up. “So what do we do?” he asked instead.
“Sorry, Vision. I didn’t mean to be paranoid, but it’s been a rough year.” Steve didn’t want to get even further on Vision’s bad side.
“What’s going on?” Her voice held that quaver that Tony knew was the onset of tears. There was nothing he hated more than seeing Pepper cry. “I don’t understand…”
Steve wanted to punch him in the face. “You knew?” He was beyond angry. He was Hulk levels of angry.
“So, back to the discussion at hand,” Tony said after a moment and a hard look at Loki. “We either have to destroy one of the three stones that we have in our keeping, or we are going to lose.”
Tony’s mouth fell open. “What?” He pinched his thigh to assure himself that he wasn’t dreaming. “I was
Tony beckoned him over with a hand. Being the meat in a Steve/Bucky sandwich was a wish fulfilled that he hadn’t even known he’d had. “Once we kill the snake and take back the universe, we’ll finish this,” he promised as Steve lifted a hand to push Tony’s chin up.
Steve and Clint dodged and weaved as they danced around the training ring. Clint was already breathless, but Steve hadn’t broken a sweat.
“But…” Clint had been trying to speak for the past few minutes. Apparently his wife had other ideas. Clint had winced, closed his eyes, flinched and groaned more than once during the conversation. “Okay, baby. I promise.” With a sigh he ended the call.
“I think perhaps we should stop talking about Loki as though he is dead,” Bruce said, reaching out to touch Matilda. “He is clearly alive and I can only assume that he is stuck in this form.” Matilda allowed Bruce to rub her ear.
If you're still with me - you're awesome. There is an end. It's a fair way away, but it's there. If you've lost interest or think I've lost the plot...bygones.
“Yeah, that’s because you speak so much of it,” Rhodey muttered as he popped up on Tony’s left. “Asshole.” He kicked Tony half-heartedly on the thigh.
“Malfunctioned,” Tony said. “I’d already said goodbye.” He wasn’t trying to be dramatic. He’d known what his unscheduled trip into space would mean.
“What do you know about time travel?” he asked, keeping his voice low. Nobody could hear them, but anyone other than Bruce Banner would lock him up and throw away the key if he talked about being from the future.
“No you aren’t.” Tony‘s voice was very firm. “You need to stay here and hold Cap together. He’s going to be freaking out because one of his lambs is out of his grasp.” Tony’s smile grew. “You’re going to have to distract him.” This was accompanied by a very Tony-like eyebrow waggle.
“Between you and Bruce, you’ve got the whole world fooled into believing that you’re nice guys.” Tony shook his head and took over the knotting of his tie.
Tony stared at the burn marks left in the grass. “That man has no regard for lawn maintenance.” Steve gave one of those little grins that Tony had grown to cherish.  “I'm gonna miss him though. And you're gonna miss me. There's gonna be a lot of manful tears.” They walked together to Tony’s car.
He watched the feed from the Iron Legion carrying Steve back to New York. “I wonder if he’ll tell me…us.”
“Deal.” Tony gulped and they shook hands, staring at each other. “Just so that you know, I’m a complete mess. I
“Shut up,” Steve grunted, sweat dripping down his temple. Tony couldn’t resist. He surged up and licked the bead of moisture from his skin.
“Time’s a-wasting, boys.” Crowley started down the passage again. “The Cage is right in the center of Hell, and to be frank, it might be a bit of a tough road.”
Tony and Clint just laughed harder, leaning against one another as they wheezed. “He apparated!” Tony told Clint.
Steve looked over at Thor. “Any ideas?” he asked, heart beating a little too fast at the thought of Tony alone in there with the craziest person he knew.
Tony frowned down at the box. “He said I’m not going to need this anymore.” He rapped his knuckles against the arc reactor. “What do you think that means?”
Steve lay down next to him, eyes on Tony’s face. “Bucky looks like he plans on taking his time,” he said. His eyes flicked between Tony and whatever Bucky was doing.
Steve turned his head to the side so that he could meet Bucky’s lips with his own. “Knew you were awake,” he muttered against Bucky’s mouth. “Knew you’d move your ass eventually. You hate missing out.”
Steve followed. “Yeah,” he said, wandering over to the edge of the patio and looking down. “He loaded all sorts of historical stuff onto my tablet, keyed up documentaries on the TV in my room. Got J.A.R.V.I.S. to keep me posted on what had been happening in the world while I was asleep.” He sighed. “It was nice to know he cared enough about me to do that.”
“That appears to be the case, sir,” F.R.I.D.A.Y. agreed. He missed J.A.R.V.I.S. so much at moments like this. J.A.R.V.I.S. would totally have played along.
Tony shrugged. “I’m not known for making the best plans.” Bruce just sighed and continued mining the information from SHIELD.
“Shut up.” Tony took a big gulp of the liquor, appreciating the burn of a truly good single malt. “He’s always so concerned and earnest. I just wanted him to go away.” He felt a little kernel of shame twisting in his guts.
“We try because it's who we are.” Wanda sat with her legs crossed and her eyes closed. She hadn't said a word until now.
Apologies for the late update - I've spent the past week in preparation for fire evacuation as well as helping those who lost everything. Writing was the very last thing I was thinking about.
Bucky shook his head. “No offense, Stevie, but you and me sharing a living space ain’t gonna work. I need to be near the guys who can put me under if necessary.”
a person, Buck. A good person who has had an incredibly raw deal.” He reached out carefully, feeling a giddy sense of delight when Bucky put his hand in his. “Nobody will
“You…Googled!” Tony felt like a carp as his mouth dropped open. He looked at Steve. “Do you Google?” He felt on very unsteady ground suddenly. He was used to being the internet whizz.
Tony rolled his head so that he was face-first against the warmth of Steve’s neck. “Yeah,” he rasped. “You were assholes.”
“Take advantage, please,” Tony begged, rocking himself on the hot length of Steve’s dick. “Fuck me.”
“I accept responsibility for what happened.” Steve wanted to punch him. “Perhaps Tony wasn’t ready to accept what Wanda dreamed.”
Tony boggled. “Are you fucking kidding me? The company would collapse in a second!” He shuddered. “The board would lynch me.”
Loki followed him in, still nude, still indifferent. “I can do many things, but the venom from the Jotun is not for mortals to bear.” Everyone turned anxious faces to them. He ignored the tears that streaked Pepper’s cheeks and the fact the Clint and Natasha were standing beside Tony’s bed with their heads bowed.
“Do what?” Loki asked, all innocent evil. Steve didn’t trust the dickhead as far as he could throw him. And he could throw him helluva far.
“Gentlemen.” Coulson still had the ability to make Tony feel like a bug on a windshield about to be mashed by wiper blades. “There are larger issues to be concerned about than the size of your…brains.” The pause was deliberate. Tony knew it. He just couldn’t prove it.
“I believe that caramel is what Loki prefers most of Midgardian sweets.” Thor looked positively triumphant. “That means that it should be I that braves the chamber.”
“Ow.” Tony rubbed at his waist where Steve’s fingers had dug in. “Next time, not so hard, okay? Squishy human without the suit.”
Natasha had remained silent through all of this. She asked Strange, “If Thanos needs all six, why don't we just stick this one down the garbage disposal?” She pointed at the Time Stone.
So this is the scene that I've had in my head from the start. Them talking about what happened and why it happened and where to go from there.
“I know you're nervous. And you have plenty of reason to be.” Steve was using the same voice when he was trying to get dogs to come and play with him in Central Park. They just didn’t have the time for that.
“Well, at least I’ve got some extra help now,” Tony said. “I mean, Bruce and Vision are awesome, but the spy twins know things that nobody should know.”
“But, you have a chance now,” Steve leaned forward, held out a hand to Bucky. “You have a chance to get everything back.”
It was like looking at two versions of his friend at the same time, Steve thought. One was Bucky, the guy he’d counted as his right arm all his life. The other, the scary other, was the Winter Soldier.
“Don’t be an ass, Barton,” Bruce said, not looking up from his inspection of Matilda. “Make yourself useful and come and help Thor hold on to the cat thing.”
Steve could not have done a single thing even if the entire universe depended on it. Tony was kissing him and he didn’t care if the world burned down.
Muttering under his breath, Clint rubbed at his leg. “You’re just as much a pain in my ass as you always were.”
Thaddeus "Thunderbolt" Ross was a tall, imposing man. If Tony was the easily awed sort, he’d have been intimidated. Because he was Tony Stark…not so much.
His words were muffled as Steve grabbed him, hauling him into his arms. “Oh my god, Buck.” Steve felt his throat close as he blinked away the tears in his eyes. “You’re remembering me, us, life before Hydra got hold of you.”
The diminutive use of his name brought back another rush of memories. Steve and Bucky, Bucky and Steve. They had been the best of friends and Tony had managed somehow, to give Bucky back to Steve again.
He grinned at her, knowing it wasn’t his best effort. “Nat, you are the most cocked of all of us.” Her mouth quirked. Attention was off Clint though, and that was what Tony had been aiming for.
“No, I didn’t.” She patted his arm consolingly. “Now, get dressed so that Natasha and I can assess what we can salvage.” She waved at his general direction in a vaguely menacing way as she got back to her feet again
Gamma radiation. Now there was a thing Steve would have preferred to go his entire life not knowing about.
who did the quick Russian translation: It means: "I'll tear your nuts off". LBR Natasha could totally do it.
Steve was frustrated, angry and worried. F.R.I.D.A.Y. had refused to divulge Tony’s location and nothing they said would make her budge.
Thor stared at them all. “Many of your Midgardian customs are strange.” He smiled. “But if all of you are happy then I am happy.” Thunder rolled across the bright blue cloudless sky outside.
He grabbed onto Steve’s shoulders and held on as he opened his mouth. Steve immediately pressed in, his tongue soft and wet against Tony’s.
Tony thought he probably looked like a demented fish with the way Steve was pinching his lips. “Mngffff…” He glared.
“Vision being here, with us, you know.” Tony waved a hand around as he sought the right words. “It just feels strange because it used to be you and me and….”
“It’s for this.” Bucky lifted his arm. “This cost a lot more than three million dollars I reckon. Even if it didn’t, it’s worth way more than that to me.”
They both looked up and being hit by two delighted smiles was enough to make him smile back. “Hey yourself,” Tony said, crooking a finger at him. “C’mere.”
“Why didn’t you take this to Secretary Ross?” Delany asked. “He was the architect behind it. Surely he’d be the best person to suggest amendments to the UN?”
“Stop talking,” Tony gritted. “Let me be perfectly clear. Whatever you’re planning, whoever you’re talking to, wherever you’re taking this, it won’t happen. Not under my watch.” The guilt was almost crippling. Now that he could see it for what it was, Tony couldn’t bear the thought that he’d supported the SRA in any way.
Tony still had to adjust every time Vision spoke. It was hard hearing J.A.R.V.I.S. voice from an actual mouth. “Thanks buddy,” Tony said, clapping a hand on his shoulder. “I appreciate the assist.”
Pietro whooped and whizzed around the room, spinning Wanda as she laughed. Bucky leaned into Natasha, whispering something in Russian that had her lifting her hand to hide her smile.
And then he blinked. “Pep, did you know that Steve and Bucky batted for my team?” he called as he jumped up several times to get the jeans to close. There was skinny and then there were these pants.
“Certainly sir,” F.R.I.D.A.Y. said. “I've opened a channel.” Lee boggled when Tony flashed a grin at him.
“In this case, it’s a two birds, one stone sort of deal.” Natasha’s gaze moved to Tony. He thought his testicles were trying to crawl up into his body and out the other side. “Stark.”
The noise in the room built and built until finally the General Assembly President banged his gavel. “Please! Settle down, everyone! Order! Order!”
“And you didn’t think that maybe this was information I might need?” Tony could hear the panicked screech in his voice, but the stories he’d heard from Thor and Loki had made him more than a little paranoid where the Giants were concerned.
“I’d prefer to face my enemy than have him assassinated while I’m not looking,” Steve said. He watched Bucky’s slow nod, Sam’s agreement, Rhodey’s chin lift. The soldiers here knew there was some honor in war.
“Exactly,” Steve said. “Just remember, some of his staff might also be Set’s followers, so keep your guard up.”
Tony didn’t know for how long they were out there. He was abruptly aware of the chill in the air. He shivered. “We should head inside,” he suggested. “The sun’s going to be setting in a minute.”
“Brother, explain yourself.” Thor clearly hadn’t been distracted by their antics as he fixed a glare on Loki’s face.
“Hopefully Lucifer, that son of a bitch,” Dean growled, opening the other duffel. The knife he pulled out was impressive.
“I’m not in the army. You’re not my boss.” Natasha’s cool reply made Tony want to kiss her. But only for a moment and then the fear set in again.
Steve wanted to protest, to defend his decision, but here, exiled from everything he knew, he couldn’t. “The Accords were wrong.” They were. Steve truly believed it.
Conversations. Revelations. Old friends and a surprise or two. Somehow they have to get past their differences. It's time to grow up.
Steve nodded. “The serum speeds everything up.” He rolled his shoulders. “Because our metabolism runs so high, things like sleep to recover from the day, well it just doesn’t always need to happen.”
“Yeah? Well, it's time for me to tap out. Maybe I should take a page out of Barton's book and build Pepper a farm, hope nobody blows it up.” Nevermind that Pepper and he were on a very long break. Indefinitely. A farm sounded like fun. Cows and sheep and chicken. He’d hire people to clean up the shit. Tony knew he was babbling, even in his own head. It happened a lot around Steve.
Tony stared at him. “We still have some pretty serious shit to work out,” he said after a moment. “All of us.”
“Well, that’s just perfect,” Pepper said. “The world’s worst plan.” She glared at Steve. “I really expect better from you, Steve.”
“I’ve taken the liberty of asking Captain Rogers to come to your rooms, sir.” F.R.I.D.A.Y. sounded as shaken as it was possible for an artificial life form to sound.
“Say ‘fucking’ one more time, Clinton, please.” Bruce stood with a gurney ready. “Could you please help the idiot onto the stretcher?”
“I’m guessing this isn’t Earth?” Tony was reasonably sure he’d never seen blue grass. The heavens looked like a giant bruise, swirling with purple, yellow and green. There were trees, black silhouettes against the sickly-colored sky. It was alien and terrifying and utterly mesmerizing.
Steve watched Tony listen to whatever his AI was telling him. “No. It isn’t Avengers Tower, you idiot. They have their own place now.” He paused. “I don’t care what…” His mouth tightened. “I swear to god I am reprograming you and making DUM-E your boss.”
Bucky grabbed him, and yanked him onto the bed, tossing him down next to Steve. “You talk to goddamn much,” he growled, dropping his not inconsiderable weight on top of Tony.
“Stop that,” Bruce told him, not even looking at him. Tony searched his head for eyes. There must be one in the back of Bruce’s head. “The formula we’ve run suggests a cyclic multiverse, not a brane one as I first thought.”
“Don't.” It was one word but it conveyed the absolute end of Steve's considerably long rope. “Not. One. Word.”
“Let’s get this arm finished.” He looked over at DUM-E. “You ready to see what my genius has created this time, buddy?”
“We’d better go back inside and make sure that the others haven’t started a war,” Tony said, pulling his hand out of Steve’s.
Tony was intrigued and as per usual, curiosity won out over humiliation, so he crawled back out, accepting Steve’s hand to help him to his feet. He folded his arms in defense again. “Just to be clear, and I’m still fuzzy on several of the details, what offer was that?”
The doors slid open on the living area. Loki was huddled on the sofa, shivering and miserable, with Thor hovering over him. Steve sat on the coffee table in front of Loki. The rest of the team were watching from the far side of the room. Tony wondered what he'd missed.
“Because unlike you, my thick-headed friend; Moose over here understands that I have just as much invested in keeping that prick locked up as you do.” Crowley sneered with his entire body. Tony wanted to learn how to do that.
He climbed to his feet and helped Natasha up. “We should get going,” he told her. “We’ll have to go by HQ to collect our gear.”
Steve nodded, his shoulders drooping. “I know. I understand. I just….” He met Tony’s gaze. “We never took our moment.
“So our gravity affects the other universes?” Tony asked, tapping his mouth as he did a slow walk around the model.
He scooted back on the bed, keeping one hand on Tony’s hip so that he wouldn’t be jostled off. Tony grinned at him. “You are a very good boy,” he noted.
“So when I passed out?” Bucky asked, focused on the information at hand. He was clearly trying not to freak out. It showed in the trembling of his hands.
He saw Clint and Phil doing a reasonable facsimile of a shuffle, Clint’s head tucked against Phil’s neck.
Tony tinkered for a while after he’d sent Steve and Bucky away. Bruce worked quietly alongside him, almost telepathically knowing what he needed before he asked for it.
“When did you know about my parents?” Tony’s question was like a scream in the room. He could hear the rawness in his voice. “When did you decide to lie to me?”
“That's where that Boy Scout mind of yours is going,” Bucky said. “You're going to step back, be the bigger man and let us be happy together, right? Watch us from the sidelines while crying into your milk because, god forbid, Captain America drink actual alcohol!”
“You just never stop, do you?” Sam chuckled, running a thumb over the skinny boy almost half the size of the other one. “No wonder they chose you to get the serum.”
“For fuck’s sake,” Bucky groaned. “Would you two please just get a room and have angry fucking make-up sex and get it over with?”
Steve rubbed a hand over his eyes. “That’s sort of his thing though, isn’t it?” He stared at Loki who was pale and shaking. “Is he alright?” He wasn’t an expert, but he didn’t think gods were supposed to look as though a breeze could blow them over.
Colonel Lee shook his head. “I'm afraid that once the door is closed, there is no way to get into the...”
“Everyone, get a good night’s rest,” Steve ordered. “I’ve got a feeling that tomorrow is going to be a crapshoot.”
Bucky suddenly went white. “God, no.” Tony grabbed him, held on as he swayed. He took all of Bucky’s weight as he sagged against him.
The bay door opened, but before any one of them could get out, Rhodes and Pepper barreled in. “Move! Move” Rhodes yelled, pushing Clint out of the seat and taking the controls.
Steve felt pretty content, sitting here in the late evening with his friends around him and his lovers beside him. “This isn’t exactly what we pictured when we signed up for the army, is it?” he asked Bucky.
Tony froze. “I thought…” His eyes seemed hunted. “I’d give you guys some time to, you know, talk and shit.”
.” Tony didn’t let Bucky look away. “Do you have any idea how much you’ve given me? How much you’ve changed my life?”
“And yet…” Tony grabbed Bucky’s hand. “Come on, sweetheart; let’s get the bed warmed up for the Boy Scout.” He smiled at Steve to let him know he was teasing.
This had become a routine thing. Once a week, Steve would bring Bucky to see Tony and let him mess around in his best friend’s brain. Sometimes it worked, other times Bucky sank into a silence that he couldn’t penetrate.
Steve just rolled his eyes. “Please remember that I’ve lived here before. I know all of your stalling tactics.”
Steve turned away from the stasis pod, the image of Tony’s frozen face in his mind. “Let me know if Bruce comes up with anything?” he said.
Bruce propped his elbows on the bar next to Natasha. “Hey,” he protested mildly. “I’ve not Hulked out in a while now.”
“Of course,” Vision said. “Your presence here has already caused Mr. Stark considerable physical and emotional trauma. I intend to mitigate it as much as I possibly can.” He paused. “Mr. Stark requested F.R.I.D.A.Y. inform me of Wanda’s demise. May I enquire as to the reason for her murder?” He sounded as though he was asking about the weather.
“She wasn’t who we thought she was,” Sam said, sounding as devastated as Steve felt. “She saw right into our souls and took what she needed to use us to achieve her mission.”
Tony curled his lip. “I’m not a complete idiot,” he said. “I know this is the best thing that’s ever happened to me. I’m not going to fuck it up. I’ll die trying to make it work.”
“You’re not!” Tony’s jaw firmed. “You’re the strongest person I know, Buck. I can’t think of a single fucking human being who could have endured what you did and come out sane.”
“You can end my wretched life,” Loki informed him. “Perhaps my death will satisfy the gods and Asgard will be spared.”
As he pulled on his jeans, he thought about what might lie ahead for him tonight. Orgasms, hopefully. At least one of them, if not multiple.
.” Thor said the word as though it was a position beyond compare. Steve supposed that it was to a person who'd lost his entire world. Literally.
“Sorry, J, I shouldn’t have even asked.” Tony watched as thousands of terabytes of data began scrolling across his screens. “This is not good,” he muttered. “This is
Clint was asleep on the largest beanbag chair; Sam flopped over his lap with his face smashed into the tiled floor. They both only had pants on.
capable of multi-tasking,” Tony said. He scooted away from Bucky’s boot. “Stop that, you’re only hurting yourself.”
“Tony, I can't.” Bruce's face twisted. Tony took a cautious step back. And then breathed a sigh of relief. Turned out it was just Bruce, not the Other Guy. “I'll put you all in danger.”
Tony jabbed a finger at him. “And that!” He could hear the almost hysterical pitch in his voice. “Where does that attitude come from, James Barnes?” He scowled. “You’re supposed to have no personality at all.”
Tony looked at the shiny silver arm of the guy dragging Steve out of the river. “He’s real,” he murmured. “And he killed my parents.”
So hopefully the next time I update it will be the beginning of the end. Still some chapters to go but there is an end in sight.
Tony could still feel the grip of Peter’s hands fading as he begged Tony to do something, to save him.
Bruce nodded. “Yeah. He doesn’t often let it be seen, but once…” he stopped, clearing his throat. “Yeah.”
“Why should we trust what you say?” The South African representative was a regal-looking woman. “Your alter-ego just about destroyed one of our cities. Your lack of control is part of the reason for the necessity of the Accords.”
“I was hoping that you'd come to regret that hasty decision.” Nope. Tony could still see naked Bruce in his mind's eye. His mind's eye was clearly a cesspool.
“Was anything you said or did real?” Steve asked, hurting in a way he hadn’t since Tony had told him he didn’t deserve the shield.
Tony sucked in a breath as they stood on top of the small hill. Clint’s farm was spread out below them, as warm and welcoming now as it had been so long ago.
Steve hastily buttoned up his shirt and scrambled off the bed, racing after Tony. “Wait!” he called. “Tony! Goddammit!”
“Hey!” Dean stomped over to Tony, Sam hurrying after him. Definitely holding him back, Tony thought. “What. The fuck. Was. That?”
Tony scowled at her. There was no heat in it. Steve felt his chest hurt a little as he watched his team, the remnants of them, find their way back to each other in tiny increments.
“You’re absolutely right, Viz.” Tony smiled, soft and sweet and Steve wanted to kiss it from his face. “We’re all on the same side.”
She wiped at her eyes. “We will be,” she said, standing up and smoothing her skirt. “I think we should perhaps stay on separate sides of the country for the next little while though,” she suggested.
“Not yet.” Steve looked down to where his fingers were moving in and out of Tony’s body. “I know that this is entirely the wrong time for this, but I’m going to say it anyway.”
“Accessing more as we speak, sir,” JARVIS assured him. “The video clip has some more information that I believe you find interesting.”
He was dying inside, the warmth of Tony’s arm pressed against him felt like a fire had been lit inside him. “I missed you,” he blurted. “Every day.”
Clint pursed his lips. “We really need to figure out how to replicate that juice running through the two of you.” The low growl from Bucky had everyone taking a step back. “Or not.”
“James Barnes?” Pepper asked. “The amnesiac, semi-super soldier who tried to kill everyone ever? That Barnes?”
Tony nodded. “But we’ll only have the power to do that if we get that stone.” He looked over at Bruce as though asking for confirmation.
Steve sat down, keeping a careful distance from Bucky. He’d already screwed up enough today. “So like a trigger?” he asked.
“I remember some of them,” Bucky admitted. “It’s like standing in a dark room and flashes keep going off. I get bits and pieces of life before and during.”
She grinned, passing the sleepy toddler over. He was going on three now, plump with the baby fat that made all babies the best cuddlers. Laura had made sure he learned their names. She’d informed him that Baby Barton wasn’t an acceptable form of address.
Peggy pulsed a comforting golden glow around the room. He smiled. “Thanks, beautiful, but I’m so scared that this is going to be a fuck-up and Tony will be the one to pay the price.”
, though, which is why Tony reckoned he’d made it to Heaven after all.  “Captain America?” he rasped, and promptly passed out.
“I’m going to take a shower,” Tony declared, extricating himself from their embrace. “I’m probably carrying some sort of Jotunheimian plague or something.” He lifted an arm and smelled. “Ugh.”
Thor wasn’t a subtle man. He stepped front of Jane. “Jane Foster is my paramour,” he announced with a frown at Dean. “I think I should forbid you to speak with her.” He looked over at Steve. “Why have you brought these remarkably appealing strangers here?”
“The Serpent Crown wasn’t supposed to turn up,” Fury began with an annoyed grimace. “Dr. Foster removed it before we could move in.”
“You'll be the first to die, Stark.” Tony was at least ninety-five percent sure she was kidding. He inspected her face. Make that ninety percent.
“Anyone seen something like this?” Sam broke into their conversation, pointing at a picture on the screen. It was the print of a black hand, thumb and four fingers splayed out.
Tony sank against Steve, letting his head drop back, giving in to the kiss. Bucky stood behind him, his hands roving over the muscles of Tony’s back.
He made a noise when he couldn’t breathe any longer and she let him go. “I’ll do my best,” he assured her.
Tony held Steve tighter. “We got really, really lucky,” he murmured into Steve’s neck. “I don’t even want to imagine how awful my life would be without you and Bucky and the team.”
“He forgave us all,” Steve said. “The announcement by the President for us to return was a Tony Stark blanket statement of forgiveness. He knows that you may never escape the Hydra conditioning. He’s made a provision for that.”
The only word Tony could think of was evil. Then the rest of the thesaurus flew into his head. Repulsive. Depraved. Despicable. Abhorrent. Revolting. Awful.
“Who was he going to talk to, Steve?” Natasha wasn’t mincing her words. “He was dealing with Rhodes’ rehabilitation, trying to keep Ross off his ass and knowing that his friends had betrayed him.”
Sam tossed a lit match into the bowl and it sparked suddenly, flaming high and then gone. Tony stared at the bowl. There was nothing inside, no blood, no herbs, no match.
“Bucky, Peter, Strange, Wanda and Vision,” Steve said. “Sam too, I think?” He looked at Rhodes who shrugged.
“Well, that’s not going to work,” Tony protested. “You’re his favorite.” Two years together and Tony still bitched about it.
“Fair warning, my lady,” Thor said, launching onto the giant trampoline. “The leprechauns will not take kindly to your doubt.” Steve saw the slow curl of his smile and the quick wink to Rhodes.
“I…” His throat closed and it was suddenly impossible to breathe. He staggered back, stumbling into a sofa and sucking for air.
“Get the hell over here, Rogers!” Tony yelled. “I need some help!” He didn’t look up, eyes focused on Bucky’s slack face.
Her eyebrows furrowed. “Where else would I be, Tony? You are my teammate and you were injured. I was concerned for you.”
Steve’s smile was painfully sweet for a guy who was about to be thoroughly debauched. “I think you have the bigger bed,” he said.
Nothing flew, ran or skittered out so Tony counted it as a win. He took a cautious step forward into the room and was pleasantly surprised. It wasn't the Hilton, Four Seasons or god forbid, the Trump Tower, but it was clean and had a bed with a shower and toilet.
!” Tears ran down his face and then Cooper and Lila hurled themselves at him, little fingers finding the ticklish spots on his torso that sent him squirming and gasping.
Clint shook his head. “Just when I think you can’t get any weirder….” He grabbed a bottle of water and left with another head-shake.
“Sulking in your workroom like a baby?” Bucky asked, mouth quirked in that annoyingly smug and unfairly sexy grin. The one they saw so rarely that Tony counted each one of them.
“Man, I reckon you’d better shut your ass up,” Sam advised. “Your wife is waiting at our final destination and if I know anything about women, and I do, you are in the biggest shithole of the entire lot of us.”
Wanda floated in a few moments later, Vision not far behind. “The strange doctor has passed information to me,” she said.
Matilda chose that moment to let out a shriek of rage. Tony tried to launch himself out of the bed to rush to her rescue. Steve lunged for him, holding him down. “Nope, you stay put, Tony.”
Steve smirked down at him. “Good.” He bent down and kissed Tony, kept it soft and slow, the small moans at the back of Tony’s throat going straight to his dick.
“Well, that’s new.” Bruce looked back over his shoulder at Tony and Bucky. Steve didn’t look at him. He wasn’t prepared to deal with pity.
“And people call us the psychotic ones,” Dean said, flopping back against the sofa. “Sure, we’ll just take the detour through Purgatory and take on the Devil himself.” He laughed. He didn’t sound like he thought it was funny.
“I think perhaps I must hand myself over to the authorities,” Wanda said, perching on the edge of a chair. “They will just keep hunting for us. If I go in…”
Steve propped his fists on his hips. “Well, forgive me for being concerned about the moron who just had fucking
Bucky’s arms went around his waist and he clung to Steve. “I don’t deserve this,” he muttered into Steve’s neck. “I don’t deserve Tony and I sure as fuck don’t deserve you.”
Bucky whirled on her, hands lashing out. “Fuck you. No.” Natasha took his legs out from under him, crouching over him with a Glock pressed beneath his chin. “Calm the fuck down, Barnes.”
“I don’t want a cent,” Tony repeated. “That arm, state of the art awesome that it is, was a gift to you.”
Tony dropped his head onto the workbench, relaxing a little when Bruce patted him on the shoulder. “I offered to give Captain America a blow job as an interview for the position of boyfriend!” he moaned.
“So Skurge, that’s Strange’s pet giant, took us down to this place called Mímisbrunnr, which is sort of a realm within a realm apparently.” He looked around the room. “The universe began with a tree, by the way.”
Again Tony tried to remember why he’d talked to Bruce about something that had obviously bothered his bestie for two years. “I have no idea,” he admitted eventually. “Maybe we should ask the groom?”
She held up a tablet and pressed play on a video. Tony was standing in front of a hospital, swarmed by reporters.
Tony realized that he’d been stalling. With an apologetic look over at his team, he took Strange’s hand. “Catch you all on the flipside,” he said as Strange murmured something beneath his breath.
Tony shrugged his hand off. “I’m fucking telling you that you’re dead, killed by Sharon Carter and Brock Rumlow on the steps of the courthouse.”
“Don’t finish that,” Bruce warned. “Sleep it off, flyboy. You had your ass handed to you good and proper tonight.”
Sam stepped closer to Dean, partly shielding him with his big body. “Don’t threaten us, Billie,” he cautioned. “You’ve seen what happens when you do.”
Tony was almost too afraid to hope. He wondered whether he should be freaking out more, but he’d see so much crazy in his life that a time-travelling voice in his head was not the strangest thing to have happened to him.
Hawley watched him, silent for a moment, her gaze like a laser. Then she sat forward, pulling the document in front her towards her. “Why don’t you go through the changes with us, and then we can decide?” She waited, one raised eyebrow that reminded Tony so much of Natasha that it physically hurt.
So we're at Infinity War - some of the dialogue has been attributed to different characters because reasons.
You guys make writing this story fun. Thank you so much for the support. The kudos & comments spur me on.
Tony felt hunted. Coulson always did this to him. Wore him down like a river on a rock. He was a mountain, goddamit!
“Which is where you come in,” Sam said. “We just need to get into Purgatory. Everything else is on us.”
“And since I’ve spent the last few months with Tony’s B.A.R.F. technology, we’ve come to a sort of understanding,” Bruce added.
That made Steve grin reluctantly. “I won’t disagree with that,” he agreed. “However, Iron Man doesn’t exist and Tony Stark
Tony snorted. “Well, I could have used one of those about five weeks ago when Pepper dumped my ass, but no thanks, Cap.” He sounded bitter and angry.
“Nice to meet you,” Tony babbled. “Gotta go!” He dragged Pepper away, realizing that he probably looked insane.
that one to him, Tony thought. “And if you make one comment about stroking, I will cut off your balls and feed them to my cat.”
“Tony’s not an enhanced human like we are,” Steve said. “It’s our duty to protect him.” Tony was pleased that Steve seemed to have picked up on his idea of hiding the Iron Man suit until it was really needed.
“Thanks.” Natasha plucked the cup out of his hands, arching an eyebrow when he opened his mouth to protest.
And that was an ache that wouldn’t go away. She’d been so pissed at him. That he’d even conceived of Ultron in the first place without talking to her about it. Not even the week long Maui vacation after the chaos had changed her mind. They were through.
“So it’s another magical thingamajig that we don’t really understand,” Bruce said. “I’m getting a send of déjà vu here people.”
The errant Avengers arrive. Things aren't quite what they expected. Tony does what Tony does. The Bartons have their moment
Tony shrugged. “I had fun fiddling with her.” He rolled his shoulders. “I guess he found his brother?”
Rhodey stared at her in bemusement. “I’ve been trying to get that through his thick skull for over twenty years and you manage it in,” he looked at his wristwatch, “a minute.” He looked disgusted. Steve could see it was an act though.
Tony felt his body tense. It was only the solid weight of Vision’s hand on his shoulder that stopped him from snapping. “I’m well aware of what happened, Councilman. I was the chief cause of what happened in Sokovia. I was also the first of the Avengers to sign the Accords.”
Steve hated the smile that curved Bucky’s mouth. It made everything inside him turn small and mean. “That’s what Clint said. I’m guessing he’s pretty creative in other ways too.” He
Tony goes to Fiji. War Machine arrives. Bucky has a problem with stuff in his brain. *needs moar Bruce!*
Tony wanted to roll his eyes. “I’m going to lock you and Strange up in a room for a week and maybe one of you will come out making sense.”
Dean nudged Sam over, squashing him into the corner of the nook. “Move over, Sasquatch,” he grunted, putting a plate in front of Sam. “Time to eat, Sammy-boy.”
fuck relationships up.” He decided that honesty was the best policy here as it seemed that Bucky was determined not to let this go.
Thor came barreling into the room, stumbling into Bucky. “Loki! I told you to remain at my side at all times!”
“Gimme a minute,” Tony said, his mind going over what information they had so far. “The Aether, that’s with this Collector guy?” He looked to Thor for confirmation. He nodded. “You sure it’s safe?”
Tony collapsed on top of Steve, entirely rattled. “Move over,” he ordered, shoving at Steve’s thigh. Again with the stroking temptation. Goddamit, Tony thought, he really had to get his mind on the game and off the sex.
“Perhaps,” T’Challa admitted. “Perhaps Tony Stark had another plan all along. But not one of us thought to ask him.” He watched Steve closely. “You have been friends for several years now. Is he an untrustworthy man?”
Steve ignored him. “I’m going to make sure that you never, ever again think that you’re not the most important thing to me in the world.” He pulled his fingers out and Tony manfully resisted the urge to whine.
Tony couldn’t take his eyes off the center of Vision’s forehead where the Mind Stone shone gold and bright. Loki frowned, muttered something under his breath. The room shook. Vision screamed, falling to his knees as his forehead bulged.
Steve and Bucky were both examining him urgently a moment later. “Is it painful?” Steve asked, moving his chin from side to side. Tony wasn’t entirely sure what he was looking for.
It was a small enough noise, but one that Steve was evidently waiting for because then he went to town. Tony just hung on for the ride, his orgasm building and building as Steve steadily lost control.
“He’s trying to decide whether to kill himself or Tony,” Bucky told him. “I reckon it’s about fifty-fifty.”
A strand of scarlet slid up and circled his wrist. “You are worthy, Tony Stark,” Wanda told him with an enigmatic smile.
“Anyone else want to know the exact specifics of said situation?” Tony asked, looking around. “No-one?”
“Dude, you don’t have anything on me when it comes to daddy issues,” Tony said. Yeah, he was apparently deranged if he thought he could out-issue the half-god giant with a hate-on for his father.
“He wouldn’t bring us back to the tower, would he?” Clint asked. “That would be seriously not normal.”
Tony moved off the sofa and got to his feet, untangling them. “How long did I sleep for?” he asked instead of responding.
“Because you’re an idiot.” Rhodey wasn’t being helpful. Tony sent him a meaningful glare that was entirely wasted on him as he was making googly eyes at Pepper.
“That means that you would have to go back to Asgard before then or you’ll be stuck here forever,” Vision said softly.
The thrusters punched in and Tony was bulleting towards the place where he hoped he’d find his friend.
Tony turned to look at him. “You, right here, right now, were exactly what I needed, Bucky.” He gave in then and reached for Bucky’s hand. “Thank you.”
“Good luck,” Steve said, shaking his hand. “Stay safe.” He turned to Loki. “We’ll keep trying to figure out a way to get you out of there,” he said.
“It hurts so fucking much, Steve!” Tony sobbed and clung to Steve’s shoulders in a desperate attempt to brace himself for the storm that was writhing within him. Steve was grateful for soundproofed rooms. He didn’t want to have to explain this to the rest of the team.
“I told him I wouldn’t do it.” Loki looked down at his hands. “So he ordered his wife to take my seed from me.”
It wasn’t until much later, when Steve re-watched the recording of dozens of versions of the Iron Man armor exploding in the most spectacular fireworks show, that he realized the fear he’d felt at the thought of Tony being gone was more than the fear of losing a friend.
Steve snorted a laugh. “Well, you’re not wrong,” he said, heading towards the doors leading to the rest of the house. “Good night, Vision.”
“He has been very kind to me,” she said. “Losing Pietro was like losing a part of my soul.” She swallowed. “Vision has helped me to stop the bleeding.”
“Is there any reason that you didn’t get rid of all my Dolce and Gabana suits? I distinctly remember asking for that about a year back.” He hadn’t been at the Malibu home in a while it seemed.
Vision tipped his head to the side. “Mr. Stark had Wanda under surveillance from the moment she joined the Avengers. He never trusted her.”
“Modest to boot,” Bruce said with a dry smile. “Vision, you ready to go and prove his calculations are correct?”
Steve looked at him. “Consequences?” Like he didn’t know what kind of fucking hell he’d dropped Tony and the Avengers into. The Accords, Barnes and T’Challa, and everything felt overwhelming.
Tony knew though. He’d signed on for the whole thing. He could name each and every person who was involved in pushing the SRA into law. He knew who those were in other countries. Those who, once America had taken the first step had followed suit.
Tony wriggled down, pulling Steve’s pants and underwear down with him. He swallowed Steve’s cock in one slow glide. Steve lost all ability to breathe.
Tony got it then. He got why girls swooned when they saw Captain America. This stupid, noble, idealistic son of a bitch.
“I’m attempting to separate SHIELD from HYDRA, sir, but it is very difficult. It’s a like a tumor on a brain stem.”
When Happy stopped outside the huge brownstone house, Tony let out a breath. “You sure about this, Mr. S?”
Steve felt the beginnings of a headache between his eyes. The Super Soldier serum was clearly no match for the insanity of the Avengers Initiative. “What is the Reality Stone?”
“I have many battle scars to show you,” Thor declared. “The deepest was when the Lady Sif skewered my manhood with her spear.” He stood. “Do you wish to see?” He started unbuckling his belt.
A small reminder that my gofundme is still active. I am now having to replace the stove, dishwasher, microwave & build a fence for the dog that I rescued /o\ https://gofundmesa.co.za/help-cyd-survive-goal-r20-000/ Any help would be awesome - the ZAR is doing poorly against all currencies so even a dollar would help.
Tony decided to retreat to his workshop. He didn't want the mental image of Thor dissecting his sex life any longer. As it usually included Thor telling Tony about his
Tony pulled Steve down to him, kissing him. “But that day is going to come anyway,” he said. “You’re all Mr. Superserum, and I’m just a regular guy with a fake ticker.”
Steve shook his head. “Every time,” he grumbled. “He promises every goddamn time that he’ll be careful.”
“The General Assembly has agreed to the amendments to the Accords that Mr. Stark proposed, with a few provisos.” The king stopped teasing. “I believe that you and your team will be pardoned and allowed to return to the United States shortly.”
“There’s a curveball that nobody saw coming,” Rhodey said, swallowing the last of his food. “Any idea of how we’ll know if it works?”
“Excuse you.” Tony gave Bucky a less-than-gentle kick. “What I had planned would take fucking longer than five minutes!”
“The Captain is perhaps the finest human I have met on my sojourn in Midgard,” Thor told Loki. “He is worthy of trust.”
“Oh, you mean like calling me Moose, or Gigantor or,” Sam paused, “my personal favorite, Jolly Green Giant? Like that?”
“Thor’s got a big mouth,” Tony muttered. Something skittered in the dark. Tony managed (barely) to contain an unmanly yelp. “What the fuck?”
Tony wasn’t going to stand for it. “Stop right there,” he gritted, holding out a hand. “What we do on our down time has nothing to do with you.”
A hard slap across his cheek took him by surprise, snapping his head around and shocking everyone into silence.
“You think I didn’t know you were looking for me?” Bucky’s smile felt like a gift. “Rogers, I knew you wouldn’t stop.” He looked out over the cliffs leading down to the sea. “It’s why I came here.”
Tony held up his hands and ordered the faceplate to open. “You seem a little defensive.” He kept his voice low, tone conciliatory.
“Keeping things to yourself has never worked out well,” Bruce told him. When Tony opened his mouth to protest he added, “For anyone.”
There was no answer to that question that presented either him or Tony in a positive light. “We made mistakes,” he said finally.
Tony didn’t like the sound of that. “Detours?” He frowned. “Like through the Bog of Eternal Stench?” Three pairs of eyes stared at him, judging. “I don’t know! I’ve never been to Hell!” He flung his arms out to wave at the surroundings.
“I am merely an observer of human nature, Captain,” Vision demurred. “I find it increasingly difficult to forgive emotional stupidity.”
“As long as you’re doing my ex, it’s almost like you’re doing me,” Tony said, trying to maintain the light atmosphere.
“Yeah,” Tony agreed. Sam didn’t say anything, but Dean handed him various items without Sam having to ask. It spoke of a familiarity that made Tony feel a little envious. He didn’t have anyone in his life that knew him that well.
“You are my best friend, next to Rhodey,” Tony told her, holding her fingers tightly in his. “You know that, right?”
The councilors took seats around the table, Hawley opposite Tony. Each of them had a copy of the ratified Accords in front of them, amendments marked with bright post-it notes.
“I think we need an impartial mediator,” Natasha said. “We’re all too close to this. We need someone who can handle us when we get out of control.” She didn’t look at Bruce.
“Hmm.” Crowley tapped a finger on his chin. Then he seemed to decide to let it go. “Choose,” he said, sweeping a hand out to the tunnels.
Steve fell forwards onto the bed, releasing Tony to stop them from doing any damage to each other. Tony still felt the breath rush out of him as he hit the mattress.
Bruce folded the paper with a nod. “I thought you were going to call me?” He sounded mildly reproving.
Tony didn’t need Bruce to Hulk out on him. “A mistake,” he hurried to say. “A fucking terrible mistake that I’m going to make sure never happens.”
“You okay, buddy?” Rhodey’s voice was softer now, eyes very worried. “You haven’t had one of those for a long time.”
“Did I?” Tony hedged. “I must have hit my head. Hulk really needs to learn his own strength.” He tried a guileless smile up at his friends. “So, anyone feel like going out for breakfast?”
Tony watched Thor watch Loki. There was something almost helpless in Thor’s expression. It made Tony want to do whatever he could to help his friend.
“I adore you.” Tony put his hands on Bucky’s cheeks, leaning forward as he said, “Nothing you do is going to make me hate you. Nothing you say. The only way I’d hate you is if you left.”
Steve shook his head. “This is going to be a disaster,” he muttered, grabbing Tony’s hand and towing him after him as he headed to the dining room. Tony made sure to snag Rhodey as well.
Lucifer screamed then – a long cry of indescribable rage that made every hair on Tony’s body stand up. “I shall not forgive this!” he shrieked. “Your children and your children’s children and their children’s children will never be safe.”
To anyone who reads this a small donation to my gofundme would be much appreciated. For reference $10 = $100 so any amount would make a difference. I have 7 cats to feed & I'd rather they eat than me. I could do with a little starvation https://gofundmesa.co.za/help-cyd-survive-goal-r20-000/
“Ouch.” Tony winced. “That had to hurt like a mother-fucker.” He shook the creature off him, pushing Bucky behind him again. “Keep going,” he said.
“Apparently, Thor's brother, Loki, is somehow the not-cat Matilda and is also one of the Ascended,” Clint offered. “Any thoughts?”
“Not over this line,” T’Challa said. “The General Assembly has taken a recess to consider the changes to the Sokovia Accords that have been proposed by Mr. Stark. We will be voting tomorrow. Your package will arrive in the morning.”
Bucky was visibly struggling now. “Tony didn’t ask questions, you know?” He shoved his hands into his pockets. “Well, not about what I’d done or who I’d been, anyway.” His mouth quirked. “He bitched a lot about my arm. Said it was inferior technology.”
“Of course, sir.” She sounded subdued as though she’d picked up on his mood. “I hope you sleep well.”
Pepper, bless her controlling little heart, had ensured his fridge was well stocked. He grabbed water, an apple, some grapes, and a block of cheese. Taking his haul with him to his room, he sat on the edge of the bed and took a breath.
“I don’t know what that means.” Crowley dismissed it with a wave. “I can’t go further than this.” He pointed at a narrow tunnel. “Stick to the path and you will come out by the Cage.”
Tony looked back up. “I’m not sure what you’re expecting me to see,” he admitted. He stopped. “Wait a minute.” Now that was just downright fucking creepy. It looked almost like a slot for a memory card. Which was completely impossible. Wasn’t it?
what it looked like from this side of the room,” Tony exclaimed, trying to remember if this had happened before. He was so shocked at what he’d seen that he had a suspicion that this was new. “I’d like an explanation.”
Sam nodded sagely. “Bestie catch-up time.” He waved a hand when all eyes turned to him. “Or something.”
“He built the facility for us, but he didn’t stay there.” Sam asked the question that Steve wanted answered.
“I’m so fucking sorry, Clint,” Tony said, pushing Clint’s face into his shoulder. It was all he could think to say.
“And you didn’t think of maybe perhaps sharing with the class?” Steve had that pissy look on his face again. The one that usually meant Tony was about to be subjected to
While I am Team Iron Man all the way, I do understand why Steve reacted the way he did. But I'm still mad at him for not trusting his friend.
“This wasn’t funny when we were children.” Thor swiped at the Loki next to him, his hand passing right through him. “It still isn’t.”
Thor lowered his hammer. And his eyebrows. “I would not demolish your home, Tony.” He sounded a little hurt. Oh god. Heh. Tony was quite possibly over-tired.
Bucky laughed. “I’m not sure if any of you guys know this, but Steve swore the worst out of all the Howling Commandos.” Steve held his breath. This was the first time that Bucky had talked about his time before….before.
Wanda strolled into the living room with a sandwich in her hand. She stopped when she saw them. “It feels ugly in here.”
Bucky shrugged one shoulder. He hadn’t moved away, his hands still holding onto either end of Tony’s tie. “In my head, sure,” he said. “But in my heart, I want to kill myself when I think about the things I did.” He was so much more honest than Tony could ever  hope to be.
Loki rubbed at his arm. “I thought that meant the Captain and your new paramour.” His tone was innocent.
“I’m programmed to monitor all conversations between Mr. Stark and potential enemies,” F.R.I.D.A.Y. said. “Recent events have led me to believe that Sergeant Barnes is no longer a threat.”
“Oh, thank god,” Rhodey muttered. “I think I picked up two cavities at least on this trip.” He was smiling as he said it.
Both Steve and Bucky held him down. “Sparring,” Bucky said. “Now shut the fuck up. We haven’t actually slept properly since you left. I think Steve is running on adrenalin and coffee.”
He ran his fingers through the water, watching as the fish raced up to nibble at the salt on his fingertips. Maybe it was time for him to clear the air with the team. The team he’d left to Tony and who’d followed him into exile anyway because they trusted him.
Steve sighed. “Sit down, please. Have something to eat.” He ushered Tony towards the breakfast nook currently occupied by Sam and Bucky.
Tony opened his mouth to protest. And then he shut it again. “Fair enough.” He looked towards T’Challa who gave a minute nod. The king agreed with this particular adjustment. “Any idea who you’d like to appoint?” he asked the room.
Tony kissed her cheek. “You’re the most important woman in my life, Potts. My CEO, my left hand, my best girl. Nothing as plebian as merely my ex.”
He headed for the Quinjet, determined to get the answers to the questions he should have asked a long time ago.
He washed his face in an attempt to wake up and then padded to the walk-in closet that was about the same size as his bedroom.
Bruce looked between them. “So, that's why Steve’s got a bug up his ass. You two are busy flirting with each other?”
Tony ached at the familiar, comforting sound of J.A.R.V.I.S.’s voice. He adored his gal F.R.I.D.A.Y., but nobody understood Tony’s absolute desperate need to know where his family was than J did. “Thanks, buddy,” he whispered.
Steve couldn’t breathe. “I…What?” His chest hurt and he ruthlessly shoved the impending anxiety attack back.
“The Collector is the one who has the Reality Stone. He will not relinquish it willingly.” Wanda lifted her gaze. “Do you have a spaceship?” She sounded curious.
Steve couldn’t look at Tony. This was it, the elephant in the room. Not the Accords, not Bucky, not the War, not the Fight.
“Yeah, Bruce was seriously pissed off with me about that.” Tony gave a humorless laugh. “Told me Hulk would have made me eat the entire document.”
Tony propped one fist on his hip, annoyed now. “I’m the genius who came up with the formula,” he gritted. “I think I know what I need to run it.”
He walked over to her. “He’s home, Laura. In the end, for you and your family, that’s all that matters.” He cupped her cheeks in his hands. “I’m not saying don’t give him hell, but don’t push him away.”
“No, Your Majesty. My friends are all here.” Steve looked at them, wondering what else was going to happen today.
“Of course we’re okay, Tony,” Steve said, all earnest blue eyes and determined jaw. “I’m crazy about you. You know this.”
Tony definitely needed brain bleach now. “Ugh.” He waved a hand in front of his face in an attempt to make it all go away.
“You lied to me!” Steve wasn’t going to let them turn this on him. “You found Bucky and you never said a word!” He couldn’t stop the pain coming through on every word.
“Yes they do,” Wanda agreed. She sighed. “I was not sure if I should show this to you, but Vision said that it was important.”
“It must be now,” Thor said, holding Mjolnir up and taking a breath. Tony could barely see what was happening with the breadth of Steve’s shoulders blocking his view. Lighting exploded, blanketing the room in a shower of sparks and the smell of ozone coating the air like sticky toffee. Tony’s stomach roiled.
“You are so very worthy, Tony.” Tears glittered in Pepper’s eyes. She put a slender hand on his cheek. “I just wish you believed that.” When he opened his mouth again she shook her head. “I couldn’t bear it if you made a crack about this right now. How your so-called friends treated you, has made me so angry for so long. They don’t deserve your love.”
“What Agent Coulson said in there, about you taking on the position of Director of Superhuman Affairs because you wanted to keep us out of prison, was that true?” Steve watched the myriad of micro-expressions flit over Tony’s face.
“No new toys for me then?” Tony’s head shot up and Clint grinned at him. “Hey Stark, what’s happening?”
“So, you’re putting us as far away from Tony as possible,” Natasha said. They were looking around them as they walked. Steve spotted several priceless artworks on walls that were light blue and green swirls that seemed to be oceans of color guiding their way.
“What’s happening in Asgard now?” Steve asked. He watched Loki even though he was asking Thor. Again, the almost imperceptible flinch spoke volumes.
Steve met his gaze. “If you wanted to, we’d be very happy.” His eyes were clear. “But if you don’t then we’d understand and there would be no hard feelings.” He sounded as though he choked on the words.
“I wonder how he’s doing it?” Bucky mused. “I mean, if he’s stuck in another dimension, then how is he reaching this one?”
“I don’t want to be taking advantage of you in an emotionally compromised state,” Steve said as he sucked at the tendon of Tony’s neck. It was going to leave one hell of a mark.
Tony moved a little closer. “You have no idea just how special I am,” he murmured against Bucky’s lips. It was their first kiss. Bucky was so careful, so tender. Unexpectedly so.
The doors swished open. “Well, hello there.” Tony looked between them. “What brings the two of you down to my lair?”
Rhodey, the dick, had the audacity to laugh. “You keep telling yourself that shit and you’ll eventually believe your own lies.”
Rhodey huffed out a laugh. “And he does it again.” But his face was soft as he smiled at Tony. “Always with the weird.”
“’Round about,” Bucky agreed. He grinned, suddenly looking so young and carefree that it made Tony’s heart hurt. He wanted to see that expression a lot more on Bucky’s face. He’d spend a lifetime putting that smile on Bucky’s face.
“I brought it back with me,” Dean said, wiping the blade on his denims. “This baby saved my life several times over.”
Bucky flushed. “You’re going to be sorry later if you don’t shut up and get in the shower,” he said instead,
“It was a friend helping us out of a tight spot,” Steve said. He still looked mad, but he’d stepped a little in front of Tony anyway, protectiveness in every line of his body.
Tony grabbed at Clint as he was towed out of the workshop. “I’m not going down alone!” he declared as Barton tried to wriggle out of his grip. “We are a team and we shall die together!”
“Call him.” Pepper came up behind him, put a hand on his shoulder. She’d come in for a meeting with Fury about some new Stark tech that everyone wanted and nobody had. It was good to see her.
Steve put a hand on Tony’s forehead, ignoring the knowing glint in Natasha’s green eyes. “He feels hot,” he said.
“I wouldn’t know how to get that.” Steve clenched his fists. “I’m going crazy here sitting on my ass waiting for something to happen.”
“It wasn't you!” Steve said urgently. “It was the Winter Soldier, an automaton that Hydra programmed to do their dirty work.”
Bucky sniggered even harder, eyes glittering wickedly. “Yanking the crank. Polishing the banister. Pounding your flounder. Teasing the weasel.”
“You have work to do.” Strange was standing beneath a ray of pale green light. Tony walked over to join him, looking up to try and figure out the source.
Clint rolled his eyes, but kept a steady stream of arrows guarding their backs. Natasha’s grin was wild and fierce as she fought around him.
Bucky's quiet censure was like a sword to his heart. “I messed up, Buck.” Steve dropped his forehead so that it rested against Bucky's back. “When I called him, I wanted to make arrangements to visit, catch up on things.”
Natasha gave a short chuckle. “If I knew all the answers then I wouldn’t be here.” She pulled away from him, leaning back into the soft cushions.
“Thanks, Fri,” he said. “You’re a peach.” He yawned, the emotion of the day finally catching up to him. “Think I’m about ready to sleep now.”
“I think you deserve better than me,” Tony told her. And the thing was he completely believed it. “I’m not the sort of guy who makes a good life partner.”
A screen lit up and Tony knew what it was before even a second had gone by. He’d seen this before. He knew what it was. He knew that Steve knew. And hadn’t ever told him.
Tony turned his head from Bruce’s perceptive gaze.  “I broke up with Pepper,” he said apropos of nothing.
Thor shook his head. “We don’t have the time. I cannot control the power of the Mind Stone in its raw form the way that our brave friend did. It must be now. Cover your eyes.”
Bucky flushed a bit, ducking his head away from Steve’s hand. “Stop it,” he muttered. “I don’t deserve your respect. I’m a killer.”
Oh.My.God. HOW did this get here? I have no idea but the Avengers have a plan. So please bear with me. Tony is being a pain in my ass. So is Steve.
Suddenly the piece of chicken felt like it was stuck in his throat. “I’m trying to focus on other stuff,” he said quietly, “But I’m fucking worried about him.”
Natasha and Clint did synchronized eye-rolls. “He’s been trying to do that to us for years,” Natasha said. “Still no jingles.”
“Seriously, why’d you kiss me?” Tony asked. “You’ve been giving a pretty awesome impression of hating my guts for the past few years.”
“The snake is the wall,” Tony said, knowing he was right. “The magic has been eroded and the gateway between our world and Asgard is thinning.”
“It’s what made me create Ultron,” Tony said, clearly unsure about where she was going with her questions. “I needed to find a way to save them.”
“So I see.” Laura’s voice gave nothing away. “Coop, Lila, go and say hello to your dad.” Tony watched the expressions on the kid’s faces, torn between joy at seeing their father and wanting to support their mother.
He gave a sigh of relief. “Hey, octopus boy, how about letting my blood circulate a little?” Tony poked Bucky’s thick forearm.
Steve moved then, pulling Bucky into his arms. “Tony is a very good man.” He breathed the words into Bucky’s hair. “He’s impulsive, and arrogant and, sometimes lies like he breathes, but he’s a
“Bucky shouldn’t have to pay for something he had no control over.” Steve shook his head. “I’m prepared to face the music. I made my choices knowingly.”
“Oh, they’ve killed,” Clint assured them. “But as far as I know, only the bad guys. Demons, werewolves. Wendigos, shape shifters, you know, the monsters?”
Tony’s eyebrows went up so high that they almost disappeared beneath his hairline. He looked at Steve. “What?” he mouthed.
“I'm not sure I understand that reference, sir.” F.R.I.D.A.Y. was still a work in progress. He still had to get her to sass him the way J.A.R.V.I.S had. Or perhaps not. A sassy AI was not always a good thing. Note to self, Tony thought - no sass added to F.R.I.D.A.Y.
“I want you to tell us everything,” Bruce said, eyes bright. “Where did you go? What did you do? Who did you meet? Was Strange any help at all?”
Bucky rolled his eyes hard enough that it looked like it hurt. “Stevie here likes to cuddle at night.” Steve glared at him. “He’s like an unshakeable octopus. I reckon he thinks I’m going to leave him while he’s sleeping.”
Bucky’s voice was a rumble against his ear. Tony wondered how the hell he’d ended up in the Twilight Zone. He lifted his eyes and looked straight at Steve.
“And that’s why he came directly to me,” Tony said. “He knows where the technology came from. He came to the source.”
Natasha was at Clint’s heels and she met Tony’s gaze for a terrifying moment. “You’re so very funny,” she said. She clearly wanted him to die in a fire.
“So what's the point?” Bucky asked. “Why bother even trying?” Steve couldn't imagine some of the things he'd done. Didn't
Steve was going to kill Tony. He stalked out of the shower, dripping wet and frozen, but Tony had already made his escape.
“Good luck with that,” Clint said, taking the suite opposite Steve’s. “He seems pretty intent on acting like we don’t exist.”
“That’s never ended well for any of us,” Natasha said. “Chitauri, anyone?” She sauntered over to Bruce, leaned against him a little, just enough, Steve noted, that Bruce leaned back.
Steve wished that Tony was here. He’d know the right thing to say to make Bucky smile again. But Tony was busy using his incredible mind to work out how to save the world. It was up to Steve to say something.
She blinked, her eyes endless windows of sorrow. “My home is lying in pieces at the bottom of a sea,” she said. “And my family is buried who knows where.”
“Have you been in Thor’s mead again?” Fury asked. “I have nothing to do with the Avengers Initiative.”
“The monster was here.” Wanda's voice broke into the charged silence after Rhodey's words. “He swam in that direction.” She pointed.
Tony looked down at his plate. It was overflowing with pancakes and bacon and eggs and syrup and mountains of butter. His stomach rumbled a plea.
Her alarm burst bright red. “I know, I’m scared too. He’s…” He let her feel the emotions that Tony evoked in him, messy and jumbled, but warm and inviting like a winter campfire.
“It worked,” Tony said, pulling away from Steve and letting Bucky tug him to his feet. “I need to experiment to see if it works with other folks too.”
Steve leaned forward, made sure that Tony was looking straight at him. “I can honestly say that you are the best man I’ve ever known.”
“On your six, Sammy!” Dean was like a crazy person, his ax singing through the air. Tony had always thought that Steve was the finest fighter he’d ever seen. Until he’d seen Bucky.
“I’m changing that sarcasm filter, J,” Tony warned as he slurped his coffee. “I’m going to need something stronger than coffee to drink in order to deal with this.”
Sorry about the delay. Some RL issue that I had to resolve before I could even think about writing. It was good news so here you go. Thanks for sticking with me. Your lovely comments keep me going.
Bucky shook his head. “No.” He looked sad. “There is no way I'm ready to deal with anything remotely like this right now.” He shoved a hand through his hair. “I'm barely holding on, Steve. Snatches of memories here and there. And you're the biggest part of all of them.”
“Thinking about what lies to feed me?” Crowley arched an eyebrow. “Don’t.” Tony saw the steel in his eyes. This wasn’t someone he wanted to cross.
Thor sighed, looking reproachfully at Loki. “My brother isn’t being tactful, Tony, but he is correct. In order for an Infinity Gem to work, it must be removed from the object it is encased in.”
precious Pepper,” Coulson said, no hint of annoyance in his voice. He wasn’t allowing Tony to bait him.
“Uh,” Tony was his usual suave self as he gaped at Steve through the rainfall of water. “What are you doing?”
Thor nodded around a mouthful of melted cheese. “Eric and Jane have welcomed several hundred of my people in the Norse town of Tromso. The Lady Sif has declared it to be much like our home. Thus far they are settling in well.”
“I have faith in Tony,” Thor said, frowning at Bruce. “He is not only a man of iron, but has a will of iron. If there is one person in all nine realms who can undo Jörmungandr’s spell, then it is he.”
Clint pulled Dean into another hug. “Take care of each other,” he ordered, sounding a little hoarse.
While Rhodey babbling in terror was something that Tony normally found hilarious, this particular situation wasn’t funny at all. “What he said.” Tony nodded, backing away slowly as Rhodey cowered behind him. “Just a joke.”
“...And secondly,” Bruce carried on talking while glaring harder at Rhodey, “Time doesn't work that way. Changing the past doesn't change the future.
“Never thought I’d find the sight of two men making out sexy, but you and your soldier boy,” Bruce fanned his face with his hand. “Hot, hot, hot!”
Instead he shot across the gulf again, firing as he flew. Multitudes blew apart, swarming over each other to reach Steve and Bucky.
Steve surged forward, unable to stop himself. Tony woke up with a grunt, suddenly sandwiched between the two of them as they kissed.
Bruce shook his head. “No. But, he still shows up when I need him. Just less damage, more control both of him and myself.”
“About a day,” Steve said, watching Tony closely. “Maybe closer to two.” He didn’t intend on letting Tony out of his sight for some time.
“Laura.” Tony held an arm out and she climbed onto the bed, falling into him as she’d done several times since this entire thing had started. “I know how much you love him. Don’t punish him for doing what he thought was right.”
“Eh.” Tony shrugged, moving in behind Bucky so that they bracketed him just as they’d done on the jet. “I’m a spoiled, rich boy. I have standards.”
Richards shook his head. “There is not enough money in the world to induce me to add you to my team.”
Fury was made of sterner stuff and pointed a finger at Tony. “Don’t you fuck this up, Stark. You don’t want to be on my shit list.”
“I guess I should start back in Washington, when I recognized Bucky,” Steve said, briefly meeting Tony’s gaze. “I didn’t tell any of you. The only reason that Natasha and Sam knew was because they were with me when I saw him. We decided to keep it between us, until we could figure out what had happened to him and how I could get him back.”
Jim pulled away as soon as Tony had his arm unfastened. “I’m going for a run,” he said instead, spinning on his heel and leaving the workshop as though Hell was at his heels.
Tony cradled the coffee mug between his hands, elbows propped on his knees. Sobering up was definitely the not-nice part of drinking. Thank god for painkillers. Drugs were
“I am, as always, your staunchest protector, sir.” JARVIS did dry like nobody else. Tony was so proud.
“I’m a sharer,” Tony told him, walking over and stealing his mug. He grimaced at the first sip. “God, you’re a complete heathen, Barton, this is swill.”
“We try because it's the only way we can get up in the morning and live through the day.” Clint's voice was somber. He didn't take his eyes off the controls.
“Don’t think I haven’t spotted the sarcasm, mister,” Tony said, glaring at him. “I’m not negotiating on this.”
Steve wrapped an arm around Tony, pulling him in tightly. “We bring out the best in each other, love.” He watched Tony duck his head at the endearment he secretly loved. “You’re too reckless, I’m too careful. You’re brain smart, I’m people smart.” He ignored Tony’s indignant snort. “I may be the head of the team, but you, Tony, you’re the heart. If anything ever happened to you, I don’t think we’d survive.”
The Cage was poised on the top of a butte. There was no access. They stood there for a moment, just looking.
“I don’t read the hearts of men, James.” It was surprising how kindly Crowley spoke to Bucky. “I only process the souls that belong to me or those who are sent.”
“Peggy said I should tell you this,” Tony said, grabbing Steve's face between his hands and kissing him until his head swam. “She's tired of us pretending that we're not crazy about each other.”
Rhodes, the eternal voice of reason broke into the testosterone-filled standoff. “Okay, guys, could we table this discussion right now? The fact is that we have this Stone. We know where it is.”
Wanda was the only one who escaped with any dignity. She strolled out after Sam, Rhodey and Steve had tripped over themselves. “Tony Stark.” Her greeting was a declaration. “Green Monster.”
Bucky’s cock was hard and damp, nudging up between Tony’s thighs, cuddling in like it wasn’t big enough to split him in two.
“That’s not fair.” Steve didn’t know why he was defending Bruce, he’d felt just as abandoned when Banner had left. “It was because of Ultron and Wanda and Johannesburg and everything. I think he’s a lot like me. He’d seen too much war, too much death.”
Suddenly he was ravenous. “You’re a life-saver, Greased Lightning,” he exclaimed as he grabbed several of them.
“I think your husband would possibly dismember me if I even tried,” Tony said, hugging her just as tightly.
“When you put it that way….” Loki stopped the pretense suddenly. “Our very existence is threatened, Captain. I ask not just for myself, but for my people.”
“The ‘someone’ is actually two brothers. Trust me when I say that they’ve seen more shit than even we have.” Clint smiled.
Dean slumped back. Apparently being snarked at by Captain America was one way to shut him up.  His brother just grinned.
The other, a tall man with a thin, bearded face, intense eyes and a cloak that would rival Thor’s, said to Steve, “Tony Stark, I'm Doctor Stephen Strange. I need you to come with me.”
“She’s a kid. Ross trussed her up in a shock collar and straitjacket that would have taken her about a second to break out of. And she didn’t.”
“I’ll be with you the whole time,” Tony assured him, forcing himself not to reach out and touch him. Wanda’s vision was like a three-fire alarm blaring at the back of his brain. Whatever you do, Stark,
“No.” Steve stared at Tony. “We’ll stick with the original plan. Tony goes in.” Tony’s bright smile was reward enough, he thought with a little skip of his heart.
“She had a concussion when she said that,” Steve reminded him. “You can’t keep holding onto that as your chance with her.”
“Don’t ask me what it is,” Dean growled. “Just suit up, Tin Man, and fire when ready.” He twirled his bone hatchet weapon and planted his feet, Sam at his shoulder.
“Well, you know it was my Rhodey-bear, but now that he’s not of much use, I’m going to say Bruce.” He ducked a swing from Rhodey with a laugh. “Aw, bubba, you jealous?”
“Don’t front, Prof,” Tony said, wagging a finger at him. “Your psychotic magnetic boyfriend has told me what a pain in the ass you were in your wild youth.”
Steve shook his head. “If it’s the scepter then we need to get it back.” He poked a finger at the hologram. It made a sort of squeak and squished up against his finger. He glared at a grinning Tony. “You’re so…”
She rolled her shoulders, letting out a sigh. “You all forgot,” She looked around the jet. “My parents died at Tony Stark’s hands when I was ten. My
Coulson turned his pale gaze on Clint. “Hawkeye,” he said by way of greeting. “I was very sorry to hear about your family. Laura was a lovely woman.”
Tony grinned at him. “Can I call you ‘my boo’?” he asked. “Or pookie bear? Or wait, this one is better, love muffin.”
“Why is it that whenever we’re in that not-so-capable hands of the friendly neighborhood S.H.I.E.L.D. operation that the shit hits the fan?” Tony wasn’t expecting an answer.
It's been a tough few weeks - job cuts & illness.... thanks for sticking with me. Slightly longer chapter as tribute
“I have no idea,” Vision said. “But Steve is apparently about to withdraw sexual congress from Tony.”
“I'm sorry about jumping to conclusions.” Steve looked at Tony then. “Again.” He rubbed a hand over his eyes. “It seems like all I've done the past couple of days is run into situations like a bull in a china shop with no actual clue what's really going on.”
He watched them leave, partly worried that he’d made a bad call, and the other half a little jealous that they got to do something other than wait.
The same group of people came in with another set of documents. This pack was considerably larger. They did the same thing as before, handing the documents out to the members of the General Assembly, taking care to match language to person.
He kept his eyes on Bucky as he kissed Tony. They’d never been this, him and Bucky. But it somehow felt right with Tony between them.
Xavier put a hand on Tony’s forearm. “Tony.” That calm voice had Tony step back. He hadn’t realized he’d stepped right up into Ross’ space. He saw the bodyguards tensing up out of the corner of his eye.
“You recognize the name?” Pepper asked after she'd seen most of her window vanish as Thor's hammer had crashed through it. As per usual, the hammer returned in much the same way, decimating the rest of the large window pane.
It was also something entirely new. Another hiccup in the timeline thanks to his little detour. He wondered just how the universe was going to redress the balance. Because at the very least, that’s what it would do.
“No fucking way!” Tony wanted to eyeball what Natasha was facing, but just then Long-legged and Nasty knocked into him like a ton of proverbial bricks. Thank god for the suit.
Steve watched him, eyes speculative. “You had a mini meltdown because I made a joke about you loving me.” That was the problem with Steve. He was
Tony’s smile widened. “Because pretty much everything I say has a filthy thought behind it,” he said.
He looked around at them all. “I’ll let you know how it’s going in California. Hopefully my kid hasn’t grown up
Tony moaned, body trembling. But he obeyed, moving his hand away and grabbing onto the sheets. “I’m dying here,” he whined.
“All eager beaver here, Yggdrasil,” he assured her. “But I’m not quite sure how to get wherever it is you’re wanting me to go.”
Coulson just stared at him. “And yet… Besides, now is not the time for division. More than ever we need all those with superpowers or special abilities to be ready to fight with us.” Coulson looked over at Thor. “Would you like to tell them what you’ve told Tony and me?”
“Kid kids,” Tony insisted, heading down the stairs to the kitchen. Bucky and Steve trailed him, Steve still apparently hovering. “I know all the cool new jargon.”
Natasha’s legs were tucked beneath her as she snuggled in to Bruce. Sam and Rhodey were playing a fiercely competitive game of beer pong. Loki and Clint were facing off over the pool table and Tony was slumped between the nonagenarians. It was surprisingly comfortable and the slight buzz from the alcohol made Tony’s brain-to-mouth filter a little looser than  normal.
Tony reached out, touched Bucky’s hands. “It wasn’t you.” As he was saying it, he realized that he meant it. “That person, that weapon, it’s been destroyed, decommissioned.”
Tony personally thought this was a bad idea. “What if he wants to collect them?” He waved his hand at Vision and Wanda.
“So, what’s the plan, Cap the Man?” Tony asked just as they hit Washington airspace. “Just go in and pull the Prez out, or try to reason with Loki?” He cackled at his own joke.
“I should have said something before,” Steve said, man-handling them into Tony’s suite. “But honestly, it wasn’t until you were gone, until you wrote me off, that I realized what I was feeling.”
“What happened?” Tony asked, glancing quickly over at Vision who had frozen at the mention of his protégée.
Bruce nodded. “You made me write up a contract that said as much, and then you signed it in blood.” He looked like he was a millisecond away from laughter.
“Hitting things, shooting guns, fucking people,” Bucky said. Steve gaped at him as he shrugged. “Nothing stops the panic better than a real distraction.”
He rolled off the bed, stretching and groaning as his bones clicked into place. Getting old….older, sucked.
Bucky sat forward. “Tony mentioned once that he knew a guy who could help me check if there was any permanent damage to my system.”
“I’m reconsidering having anything to do with you,” Steve told him. “It’s clear that you’re unhinged.”
Crowley shrugged. “Unless they’ve signed their contract, then I only know when the soul arrives.” He met Bucky’s gaze. “It matters what you do right up until the moment you breathe your last.”
He lowered his gaze to watch as Bucky reached around and wrapped his fingers around Steve’s cock. “Let me take the edge off.” Bucky licked at the nape of Steve’s neck as he slowly jacked his dick. Tony was mesmerized.
Sam flinched, looking away again. “I’m his true vessel.” He said it so quietly that it could have been a whisper. “I’m the only one who can allow him to manifest safely in human form.”
“So, anyone have any actual idea where we're going?” Clint turned to look at them from the Quinjet cockpit. “Not that I don't love flying the open skies with you fine folks.”
“Actually,” Loki started towards Tony in an almost cat-like slide, “I think perhaps with the essence of the Soul Stone in your blood you may find that your body heals faster and are perhaps stronger than you were before.”
Tony didn’t seem inclined to let Steve go either. “I’m okay,” he whispered into Steve’s neck. “I’m okay, I promise.”
Clint slouched by the window, Wanda at his side, head tilted against his shoulder with his arm around her waist.
demon. He looked around. The roof of the cavern seemed miles away as he stared up. There were about ten tunnels leading off from the space. “What’s this?” he asked.
Crowley took a deep breath. “Lucifer is a master manipulator,” he reminded them as he stepped out onto thin air. Tony bit back a yell. “Don’t trust anything he says.”
“That’s for me to plan and you to execute.” The wicked smirk that crossed Tony’s face made Steve feel even more nervous. This would probably not end well.
“I would dare a whole hell of a lot for the people I care about,” Tony said. “Right now, you’re the only obstacle to making sure they’re all safe.”
“Fuck you, I’m tearing up the friendship agreement, Leonard.” Tony wanted to kick his ass, but a mid-air battle wasn’t exactly good for team morale.
Tony sat down on the suitcase, folded his legs. “I need you, Bruce.” He wasn't lying. “I need my friend back.”
“I don’t remember so much of it anymore,” Steve confessed. “It feels as if that other me is fading, that those memories are being replaced with the ones I’ve made here, with you.”
“Fuck off,” Tony spat. The cloak wrapped around him in an embrace that he didn’t even attempt to get out of. His eyes flashed at Strange. “Get out of my house, get out of my sight.”
Eventually Thor and Loki had stumbled into the living area, looking exceptionally mussed. Thor had apologized profusely to Vision for traumatizing him. Loki had merely smirked like a snake-oil salesman and ostentatiously rearranged his clothing.
Tony flung up his hands. “Shoo, go play, the three of you. Go beat each other up like I can see you’re itching to.”
Sam’s glower as he bent his head to his food, hair falling across his face, reminded Tony so much of Bucky in that moment that he smiled.
“I’m assuming that I’m in the hospital. Probably at SHIELD because this doesn’t look like Avengers Tower,” Tony said.
“Bloodless coup?” Dean asked, coming out of the kitchen with a plate loaded with sandwiches. He handed one to Sam who took it almost absently.
“You’re the most important person in my life.” Bucky’s reply was simple and devastating. “I won’t do anything to jeopardize our relationship.”
Tony sat at the one end of the table, Steve at the other. The rest of the team spread out around the table. It didn’t escape Steve that Vision, Rhodes and Pepper stayed close to Tony. What
There was a silence then, a pause like the world held its breath. “Did you mean it?” It slipped out before he could hold the words back. Things were making sense for the first time. It wasn’t just anger he’d been feeling, it was desertion of a loved one.
Thor exchanged a look with Loki. “Perhaps we could use the Reality Stone. It was entrusted to the Collector once we defeated Dark Elf Malekith.”
Steve reached out to grab Bucky’s hand. “He’s going to be okay,” he said. “He’ll come back to us.” Steve wondered just who he was trying to reassure.
Tony’s arms came up around him, holding on just as tightly. “Your girl had other plans,” he said, pressing a kiss to Steve’s sweaty hair. “She decided to use her initiative.”
“Will do,” Tony said with a small smile sent in Bucky’s direction. “I have things to do when I get out of here.”
“I know,” Steve said. “But that guy badly wants to make up for his bad choices. So, what do you say?”
He had absolutely no idea who Bucky was now. He wondered if Tony knew him better than Steve did. Tony surely knew
Tony watched an entire lifetime’s worth of emotions flash across Steve’s face and then his jaw firmed. “Okay.”
“No objection, your honor,” Tony breathed as Steve leaned down and kissed him. Every single cell in his body was on fire, he couldn't catch a breath as Steve's tongue swept into his mouth. All he could do was hang on for the ride.
“Would you have become Iron Man if you hadn’t been kidnapped and tortured?” she countered. He wondered how much she’d seen in his head that time.
“Well, that’s as good a place to start,” Tony said. “Let’s get going, F.R.I.D.A.Y. We have a Hulk to locate.”
Steve frowned, obviously working something out in his head. “According to Biblical canon, Lucifer was a son of God.”
He heard a shout and spun around, almost wobbling off the narrow stone. Steve and Bucky were fighting with what looked like creatures made of fire.
Tony narrowed his eyes. “What aren’t you telling us?” he asked. He could spot a bullshitter a mile away.
“What is the meaning of your presence in Midgard?” Thor’s big fists thumped down on the table. They all jumped a little. “You have much explaining to do.”
Tony dropped his forehead against Bruce’s shoulder in relief. He had someone else who know. Someone who wouldn’t let him forget his purpose. Because it was more than just Steve’s life that he’d come back to save.
Bucky and Steve looked as though they’d rather be anywhere else, boiled in oil even. “I don’t like this,” Steve said.
Steve wanted to bring the conversation back to the reason Thor and Loki had summoned him. “So, the feedback from Heimdall was that…” he prompted.
“Pep could have taken me to the cleaners millions of times over,” Tony shrugged. “I trust her with my everything.”
“He didn't really tell me much about that,” Bucky said. Steve felt a small glow of satisfaction that this was something that Tony had shared with
Apologies for the late post - it's a little longer than normal so perhaps you'll forgive me. Work has sucked - year-end drama is the worst.
Pepper was still sitting next to Happy, but she had listed a little to the side and was sleeping against his shoulder. Happy looked a combination of too terrified and too delighted to move. Tony thought they looked good together.
Tony shrugged. It made him visibly uncomfortable. “I’m not exactly the poster boy for the superhero club,” he said.
Clint, Rhodey, Wanda and Sam had been watching this. “I swear, it’s better than tv,” Sam said to Rhodey.
“We won’t,” Xavier said, steel suddenly in every word. He stared at Ross. “Who else is part of this?”
“Tony didn’t listen to me either,” Steve said. “He thinks he’s so smart. That he has the answer to everything. But Tony isn’t people-smart. And that’s where he failed. He didn’t stop to think that anyone could possibly disagree with him about the Accords. By the time he was willing to talk, it was too late.”
Tony grinned. “Of course I did, Capsicle. That sort of epic deserves to be shared with your good ole buddy.”
Knowing now what he knew about Steve and Bucky’s relationship, things made a whole lot more sense. Steve had been distraught. It had taken Bruce dressed up in his big green muscle machine to keep Steve back while Thor and Tony went after Bucky.
“No.” Tony needed this. Needed to do this. It wasn't just about Bucky. It was about Steve and Natasha and Bruce and Clint and … They all needed Bruce to come home.
“I just.” He put a hand over his eyes for a moment, hiding the lie in them. “I just had a bad moment.” He didn’t look at anyone else when he moved his fingers away, just kept his gaze on Bucky’s.
Tony nodded. “I get that, I do.” He sighed. “Just remember that Bucky was brainwashed. So is Rumlow. You’ve known him longer than I have and he was a good man.”
Bucky leaned forward and pressed his mouth to Tony’s. It was soft and so quick that Tony barely realized it was happening until after Bucky had moved back. “Thank you.”
“Okay.” Jim accepted it as easily as he’d accepted having to pay in some way for what Tony had created for him. It made Tony sick and angry and wanting to kill every last mother-fucker who’d fucked Jim over.
Steve was sure he was the color of an overripe tomato. He didn’t dare look at Tony. No need to worry about anyone hurting his best friend. He was going to murder Bucky himself.
“I’ll say ‘Jarvis’,” Tony assured him. He put his palms on Bucky’s cheeks, met his gaze. “But I trust you.” He leaned in, pressed a kiss to Bucky’s mouth. “I trust you, sweetheart.”
“I should probably have a chat with Bruce and Rhodes,” he said after a while. “Before I tackle Tony again.”
Tony turned back to hear Pierce say, “And SHIELD's. If you do this, none of your past is going to remain hidden.” Natasha ignored him, continuing with whatever she was doing. “Are you sure you're ready for the world to see you as you really are?” The anger had turned into a kind of oily menace that reminded Tony of Obie. He shuddered.
“You’re terrible,” Steve scolded him as they reached the dining room. Rhodey was still in meltdown mode.
Bruce nodded, apparently satisfied. “Now, shut the fuck up and let me do my genius thing.” He wrapped his hand around Bucky’s fist. “I need you to squeeze really hard.”
“Boss?” F.RI.D.A.Y. sounded nervous. It still took him by surprise after J.AR.V.I.S. had always been so confident.
OMG! I hope you didn't think I'd forgotten this?!? I signed up for the Marvel Big Bang & got totally flustered. I guess the moral of this story is that I shouldn't work to timelines. Post date is 17 November so I hope you forgive me.
Tony’s eyes were very dark. “It sounds like whoever messed with Bucky created themselves the perfect sub.” He sounded grimly furious.
“So rude!” Tony stomped away. “I’m expected to save the universe on an empty stomach.” He threw himself dramatically down next to Steve.
Steve was still struggling to compute what had just happened. “Okay, so talk me through the last few minutes,” he ordered Bucky.
Wanda crept in, a fragile figure who sometimes seemed transparent with grief. “I wished to speak with you, Captain.” Her soft accent had her words sounding like the rasp of flesh on velvet. She seldom used his name, keeping him at a distance that sometimes hurt.
Bruce nodded. “Just remember what happens when you push me too hard.” His tone was mild but pointed.
“I don’t know how the two of you ever managed to finish a month of college, let alone years,” Bruce said, dropping minute amounts of blood onto several microscope glass slides.
Tony barely flinched as Bruce morphed into the Hulk in a liquid roll that had most of the Assembly screaming. There was a mad scramble as several members tried to flee the room.
Bucky held up his hand. “I’m two people, Stevie. I’m Bucky Barnes and the Winter Soldier. They are fighting for control of my brain and my body. On the way over from the hospital I asked Stark for help. For now, I’m going back into cryo, just until Stark has figured more out.”
Steve scratched the back of his neck. “I wanted to clear the air with him a little,” he said, going back to his own coffee. “I guess Bruce thought that you and I needed to talk too.”
He had learned that Natasha liked the library when she had been on mission, and he would hunt her down and make her talk to him. He would tell her stories of his adventures with the Howling Commandos, and she would give him nightmares with her memories of the Red Room.
“He was with Pepper then, so I didn’t look, not more than seeing the beauty with the eyes of my art,” Steve said.
“At the rate the venom is destroying the heart tissue; Tony will need a heart transplant in about a day.” Bruce shook his head. “It just doesn’t make sense. There were no necrotizing molecules in the sample that I drew from Matilda.”
Tony protested, “I'm just thinking about the appropriate way to...mmff!” That was Bucky's tongue in his mouth, Tony noted a little hazily. Nice tongue. He should say hi to Bucky's tongue. With
Tony wasn’t used to blind obedience, but he was so far out of his own element right now that he obeyed Dean without question, the suit flowing over his skin in an instantly comforting shield from whatever the hell it was approaching.
“I’ll give you two days,” Tony said. “I suggest you don’t go running to those friends of yours in Colombia or Iran.” He saw Ross’ eyes widen. “Yeah, I know all about them.” He felt filthy. “They won’t be able to protect you.”
Tony looked at her. “You mean if we’d grown up normally, had normal lives, then we wouldn’t be Avengers?” He hadn’t ever thought about it that way.
“Really?” Natasha drawled. “Thor and Loki?” She tapped a finger against her cheek, looking thoughtful.
Coulson snorted. “There is no therapy out there that can cure what ails you, Tony.” He paused. “Now, what’s really going on? How did you find out I was alive? Only Director Fury and Maria Hill knew.”
“No.” Strange narrowed his gaze. “We need to go down there.” He held out an imperious hand once more.
“Let us take responsibility for our actions at least.” Clint stood at Sam’s shoulder. “We followed you because we believed that the Accords as they are were not a working solution.”
Tony held onto him. “Every single goddamn thing you did as Hydra’s puppet was not your fault.” He waited for Bucky to open his eyes again. “You know that, right?”
Tony turned on his side, shoving his hands beneath his head so that he could stare at Phil. “What does it take to piss you off?” he asked.
