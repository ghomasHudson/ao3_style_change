Harry smiled at him. ‘You can’t help me, Dobby, but thanks for the offer.’ Harry bent to pick up the Potions book he’d dropped, but stopped half way, looking up at Dobby. ‘Wait a moment - there
‘I wanted to see how you were progressing, but this block of yours is troubling. Does it affect anything else that you’ve noticed?’
Hope you all enjoyed the chapter and I'll see you again in two weeks!
‘You ask someone!’
‘It’s gonna be fine,’ Dean reminded him. ‘I’ll be right there with you.’
‘Anyway, where was I?’
‘Ah, yes,’ said Bode, surveying them. ‘Of course.’
Dean made his way up to Gryffindor Tower. The common room was almost empty, except for John, Sherlock and Hermione.
‘Are you all right?’ Sherlock asked.
Sherlock smiled and left the classroom with the other Ravenclaws.
‘The House-elf that tried to warn us about the Chamber of Secrets,’ Cas explained.
‘The accused being present, let us begin. Are you ready?’ Fudge called down the row.
‘Everyone forgets things sometimes,’ Sherlock said grumpily.
Then John lurched and finally threw up into his bucket, though it did nothing to relieve his dizziness. ‘So, my eyes turned white,’ he said hoarsely, trying to distract himself. ‘That hasn’t happened in a while.’
Once Cas was finished, Dean had him brew up a Cure for Boils. This time he chatted amiably with Cas, distracting him from his fear.
‘Of course he does’ Hermione said quietly. ‘Don’t let Malfoy get to you, Ron-‘
(See the end of the chapter for
‘He’s just having a tough time,’ Dean said, reassuring himself more than Sam. ‘Nice job on that Stunner, by the way.’
‘Oh, it was my pleasure, dears,’ said Mrs Weasley. ‘I’d invite you over for Christmas, but… well, I expect you’ll want to stay at Hogwarts, what with… one thing or another.’
‘Because Cho spends half her time crying these days,’ said Hermione, still scribbling on her parchment. ‘She does it at mealtimes, in the loos, all over the place.’
Welcome back everyone! Thanks to VegasGranny and hhhellcat for the comments!
Dean carried the success of the DA around like a warm glow in his chest over the next two weeks. He spent a portion of each meeting with Cas, coaching him on the offensive spells and helping him overcome his fears, just as he had with Cas’s potion making. Cas mastered the Impediment Jinx, and Dean was stuck in one spot for ten minutes, though Cas struggled with the Reductor Curse, refusing to cast it after his first attempt demolished half of the room. On the whole, though, Dean caught more smiles and lingering gazes from Cas as he wandered around the room, checking on everyone else.
‘Come on, what is it?’
Dean chuckled.
‘Will you-’
‘As I said before, you just need practice,’ said Sherlock, pulling his hands away.
‘I’m not so sure about that,’ said Anthony Goldstein. ‘We do still want to pass our OWLs.’
‘Go on, Harry, open it!’ several more people echoed.
gives him the right to hurt you. He should never have laid a finger on you. You’re his
Dean came up beside him. ‘Would have been interesting to see him as champion.’
‘Oh, right. Everyone, this is my brother Sam. He starts Hogwarts this year,’ Dean grinned.
‘Well, I can always hope.’
'But this is much more important than homework!'
Mr Weasley, Fred, George and Ron all dashed over to the fireplace and took turns yelling, ‘Number four, Privet Drive!’ and disappearing up the chimney.
Dean laughed loudly as he hauled Sam to his feet. ‘Graceful,’ he said.
‘So I left him with Krum to go and get Dumbledore, and I ran into Snape-’
Nagini wasted no time and struck hard at Mr Weasley, sinking her fangs into his side.
eccentric decisions
She nodded, then set to work adjusting the fabric, pulling it in in places, trimming bits off in others. Once she had finished, she let him get dressed and he met Sherlock at the counter.
‘Are you ready?’ Madam Malkin called through the curtain.
At the end of the month, Harry was called down to the Quidditch pitch with the rest of the champions, to find out what the final task would be.
‘What-’ Dean began, but then saw what he was staring at.
‘No, I didn’t see anything like that.’
He grabbed his wand dashed from his room, and shook his mother awake.
‘No. No, of course not,’ said Ernie, looking slightly less anxious. ‘I - yes, of course I’ll sign.’
‘I’m waiting for Harry,’ she said. ‘You heard what happened?’
writes Rita Skeeter, Special Correspondant.
The photographer swore loudly, but they ignored him.
‘I’m sorry, John, you’re just not really my type,’ Cas said with a slight, amused smile.
‘I don’t think so,’ John grinned. ‘This
'Useless,' Sherlock muttered, throwing the letter onto the fire.
At the end of the hour, Harry called a halt.
'Where are you going?' Dean asked.
‘Always the same,’ said Mr Weasley, smiling, ‘we can’t resist showing off when we get together. Ah, here we are, look, this is us.’
Cas wrung his hands out and took a few calming breaths, then finally looked at Dean. ‘What’s wrong?’ he frowned.
‘I thought that one was fairly obvious, you did just have three Death Eaters attempt to kidnap you.’
John nodded again, and they sat in silence for a few minutes. ‘You sat here the whole time?’
‘Mr Crouch?’ Percy said excitedly. ‘He speaks over two hundred! Mermish and Gobbledegook and Troll…’
‘Whoa,’ said Seamus, ‘what is this place?’
‘I think we’ll go now,’ said Mr Weasley, checking his watch. ‘We’re a bit early, but we’ll be better off at the Ministry than hanging around here.’
John took it gratefully and everyone else trudged back to their own tents.
‘Oh, hurry up,’ Ron groaned, massaging his stomach.
‘Nah, I’ll stay here and help Mr Weasley,’ said Sam, exiting the tent.
Dean shrugged. ‘I dunno… it’s this teaching thing… I don’t know what kind of help I’ll be.’
Then Cas promptly fell asleep, though Dean struggled to calm his racing thoughts before he too finally drifted off.
‘What d’you need three hours for?’ Ron asked, looking at her incredulously, before getting hit in the head once again, this time by George. 'Who are you going with?’ he yelled after her, but she only waved in response.
‘You heard me, Wormtail.’
‘That’s not the song it sang when it sorted us,’ said Harry, clapping along with everyone else.
Ron dived into his bag for his timetable. ‘We haven’t got him ‘til Thursday,’ he said in a disappointed voice.
Sherlock dropped to his knees in front of the sofa and ripped the parchment from his hand, throwing it on the floor away from him.
It was Sherlock’s turn to blush, but he obliged, tickling John’s head with his curls.
‘Oh, you know. Spent most of it with Sherlock and you know what he’s like. Never any peace, eh?’
Dean too leaned against the wall. ‘He’s sleeping now. You guys should go. I’ll stay with him and find out what happened. ‘
Dean fell back on the bed, too anxious to sleep, but he let Sam put out the lights anyway.
‘I’ll join,’ said John.
‘No idea,’ Sam whispered back. ‘Some kind of curse scar, maybe?’
‘Is that a toad?’ Neville asked, wide-eyed as he spotted Dolly.
‘Really? I thought you were allowed.’
'I don't
‘Can’t it? He killed Frank right there, so what if that’s what he means?’ his voice rose to a slightly higher pitch.
A loud bang echoed from the edge of the wood.
Harry now found the whole thing a lot more entertaining now that Ron was once again there to sit through it with him, though John remained as exasperated as he had always been.
‘I was just talking to Krum and Mr Crouch just appeared out of the Forest, but he was acting really weird. He didn’t know where he was and he kept talking like Percy was there. But he would switch and say something about warning Dumbledore, and he mentioned his son, and Bertha Jorkins.’
Dean drew screens around their beds again and climbed under the covers. He closed his eyes, but sleep wouldn’t come, so he pretended to be asleep for Cas’s benefit, until he heard Cas’s own soft, steady snuffling. He sat up in the dark, massaging his sore, swollen throat, and looked over at Cas’s sleeping form. He’d left a candle flickering in the dark, and the sight of his peaceful, sleeping face comforted Dean.
‘Help?’ Cas finally looked up, confused by Dean’s offer, purple ringing his eyes.
There was another cold surge, and Sherlock suddenly realised what it was. He glanced at John, who nodded slightly.
‘Are you all right?’
‘Whoops.’
see them,’ said Ron. ‘Four in a class.’
Harry and John both jumped and looked around.
'Sam, Dean, good to see you,' he smiled. 'Can't have you boys sitting all the way down the way down there. We've got the best view up here… ah, there's Lucius!'
Cas nodded, then waved his wand and the stretcher moved forward.
Hermione was scanning through a book and showed it to Dean. ‘What about this one?’
‘Katie Bell?’ Cas asked.
John sighed, then he was suddenly walking around a brightly coloured room that was packed with people, including Fred and George in bright green dragonskin jackets. Then he was back, with Fred and George holding him up by his elbows. ‘Sorry, sorry,’ he mumbled, regaining his footing. He looked at their concerned faces for a moment, then said, ‘Give me something to write on.’
‘Excellent,’ Umbridge smiled. ‘Good day, boys.’
Cas looked away.
'Cas…'
'Oh, that's always worth watching,' said Mr Weasley. 'National teams bring creatures from their native land, you know, to put on a bit of a show.'
‘Certainly,’ said Nick, surprised at her reaction. ‘The largest number in any dwelling in Britain, I believe. Over a hundred.’
‘Of course,’ Cas said softly.
'Someone else, then?’
‘And who is this?’ said Rita Skeeter, inserting herself into the conversation.
Dean heard Cas gulp next to him. Cas hadn’t been in detention in years, and the very thought made him tremble.
‘I wonder if Hermione’s seen this yet,’ Harry interrupted, looking around at the girls’ dormitories.
‘Right here.’ Dean passed him a goblet and he carefully sipped it, wincing as the movement jostled his wounds.
Nerves gathered in Dean’s chest as Cas walked silently beside him. Even the tiny efforts Cas made at affection had stopped, and it had been days since Dean had felt Cas’s hand in his.
‘That’s worrying,’ Hermione said once he’d left.
'Obviously I received it, or I would have asked you what you were doing in my classroom,' said Professor McGonagall, turning her back firmly on Umbridge. 'As I was saying: today, we shall be practising the altogether more difficult Vanishment of mice. Now, the Vanishing Spell-'
‘Dean Winchester? No way!’
‘It is Fawkes’s warning,’ said Dumbledore, catching the feather. ‘Professor Umbridge must know you’re out of your beds… Minerva, go and head her off - tell her any story -’
‘Okay.’
Hermione rolled her eyes and walked off to the library.
'Sam,' Cas gasped. 'I - can't-'
‘Oh, okay.’
‘You’re sweet,’ Dean said, cheeks warming, doing his best to ignore Hermione’s smug expression.
Dean took the roll of parchment. 'Thanks. I really appreciate it. Are you staying here?'
‘Why don’t you, Harry and Hermione get some water, then-‘ Mr Weasley handed over the kettle and a couple of saucepans, ‘-and some of us will get some firewood.’
Sherlock did the same with the curtains on John’s bed and climbed in next to him. John didn’t say anything else, he just pressed himself against Sherlock and cried silently until he fell asleep again.
‘Mr Crouch,’ said Mycroft, turning to him, ‘this boy is very ill, we should let them go.’
Suddenly, John grabbed Dean’s arm, a look of disgust on his face.
'Look at the referee!' Hermione giggled.
'Besides that, Harry's already missed History of Magic today, and I don't think he ought to miss anything else today.'
penalties for Ireland!' shouted Bagman, and the Bulgarian crowd howled in anger. 'Vulkov and Vulchanov had better get back on their brooms… yes… there they go… and Troy takes the Quaffle…'
‘Yeah. I can’t really force it very far either way. Looking into the past is easier than the future. Sometimes it happens on its own, but when that happens, it’s really hard to tell what sort of time it is.’
‘Oh! Yeah, of course.’ John drew his wand and let Mr Ollivander examine it.
Professor McGonagall sighed. ‘Educational Decree Number Twenty-five gives the High Inquisitor “supreme authority over all punishments, sanctions and removal of privileges pertaining to the students of Hogwarts”,’ she said. ‘I’m sorry, I can’t help you with that.’
‘Why’s it pink?’
Harry and Ron were still working when they came back up, but Hermione now seemed to be helping, and Cas settled at the table with them. Dean sat on the sofa with Sherlock and John, who both appeared to be sleeping soundly for once. Dean too allowed himself to doze off for a few minutes, to the sound of scratching quills. Hermione and Ron's voices eventually brought him round again.
When he got out into the Entrance Hall, he found Harry, Ron and Hermione reading a large sign that had been erected at the foot of the marble staircase.
'As Minerva and Severus have doubtless told you,' said Dumbledore, 'we heard Barty Crouch confess. Under the influence of Veritaserum, he told us how he was smuggled out of Azkaban, and how Voldemort - learning of his continued existence from Bertha Jorkins - went to free him from his father and used him to capture Harry.'
‘Well, someone has to test them,’ said Fred, grinning back.
John, who was gazing into his crystal ball, shook his head. ‘I can’t see him. I don’t know where he is.’
‘How is Winky?’ Harry asked.
,’ she snapped, now directing her wand at a dustpan, which hopped off the counter and started scooping potatoes up. ‘Those two!’ She burst out savagely, now pulling pots and pans out of a cupboard. ‘I don’t know what’s going to happen, I really don’t. No ambition, unless you count making as much trouble as possible…’ She slammed a large copper saucepan down on the kitchen table and waving her wand around inside it. A creamy sauce poured from her wand tip as she stirred. ‘It’s not as though they don’t have brains,’ she continued irritably, taking the saucepan over to the stove and lighting it with another poke of her wand, ‘but they’re wasting them, and unless they pull themselves together soon, they’ll be in real trouble. If they carry on the way they are, they’ll end up in front of the Improper Use of Magic Office.’
‘Yes, Professor. Nothing’s broken or anything.’ He tried to get back to his work, but caught Ron glaring at him and sighed.
'Okay, then, let's go,' said John.
Harry didn’t hesitate, jumping out of bed and throwing on his dressing gown.
Several people sniggered.
‘You’ve been practicing,’ Hermione said approvingly.
‘It’s my honour. Goodnight.’
‘I wanted to ask you about something. I saw Sherlock with you yesterday and he looked upset, so…’
‘Would you enter if you were old enough?’ Harry asked him curiously.
‘Gabriel told me what happened to him,’ said Sam, who had run over to them when Dean came in.
Cas smiled. ‘Don’t eat things Gabriel gives you,’ he said, taking the brownie from Dean’s hand and incinerating it.
Krum opened his eyes. He looked dazed and began mumbling something in Bulgarian.
‘What’s eating it?’ Parvati said in a terrified voice.
'It's dormant until something happens to trigger it. That's what Dumbledore says, anyway.'
'I don't know what else you thought it would be, being called the Top Box,' John said back, smirking slightly.
They set of across the deserted moor, unable to make out much through the mist. After about twenty minutes, a small, stone cottage swam into view. Beyond it, they could just make out the ghostly shapes of hundreds and hundreds of tents, rising up the gentle slope of a large field towards a dark wood on the horizon. They said goodbye to the Diggorys, and approached the cottage door.
'My twin was stillborn,' Cas said flatly.
Herbology that day was strained, with Ernie Macmillan and Justin Finch-Fletchley refusing to speak to Harry, even though they were re-potting Bouncing Bulbs at the same tray.
'So what if I am?' Hermione said coolly, though her face was a little pink. 'I can have a pen-pal if I-'
‘Tell me what?’ said Mrs Weasley, who had just entered the kitchen, eyes narrowed in suspicion. ‘Oh, hello, Harry dear,’ she said, spotting him. ‘Tell me
They made their way back to Gryffindor Tower, John shivering the whole way.
One by one, the Bulgarians filed between the rows of seats, and Bagman called out their names as each of them shook hands with their own Minister, then with Fudge.
Cas looked furtively, then put a hand on Dean’s arm.
Malfoy, who looked utterly humiliated, muttered something in which the words ‘my father’ were audible.
‘You don’t think we want to walk around wearing badges that say “spew”, do you?’ said Ron.
‘Well?’ Ron demanded.
‘But how are we to be certain that they were, in fact, Death Eaters?’ Fudge said, his face beginning to turn red. ‘They could have been anyone.’
Professor Dumbledore got to his feet, arms open wide in welcome. ‘I have only two words to say to you,’ he told them. ‘
Dean settled in and started reading. He read haltingly and got words wrong, but it wasn’t long before Cas was drifting off to the sound of Dean’s voice. Dean smiled at him fondly and put the book down, taking the opportunity to go and get dressed, and get a snack from the kitchens.
‘He’s very tired,’ Sherlock said. ‘Mrs Weasley, would it be all right to stay until he’s recovered?’
‘I’m just so tired, Dean,’ he mumbled, leaning heavily against the wall.
‘Hagrid?’ Hermione said quietly after a while.
‘Whatever. Anyway, we’d better go. Get some food into this one,’ she said, nudging Alfie with her toe. ‘It’s so great to see you, Castiel.’ She hugged him again. ‘Keep in touch this time, okay? We miss you.’
John was ashen, lying limply on the sofa, staring into the crystal ball that he was barely able to hold up.
‘Don’t mind that, just a Quick-Quotes Quill,’ Rita smiled. ‘You were saying?’
Castiel hunched over his glass of water at one end of the table.
'It was made by a cursed object,' Cas repeated. 'Does it still hurt? I can get you some Murtlap essence.'
Dean snorted.
Dean piled up a plate with easy to eat food, then pretended it was all for him so Cas could pick what he wanted off the plate. When he returned to the hospital wing, he found Hermione and Ginny sitting next to him.
John nodded, scrubbing his face with his hands, and realising he was shaking.
‘That’s not what he said,’ snarled Fred.
Cas gave a weak smile, and Dean’s heart thrilled.
Just then, another wizard Apparated right by their fire.
They finished their dinner and John stretched. ‘Better go,’ he said. ‘Trelawney’s making me redo my homework. Apparently it wasn’t close to being accurate.’
‘You can’t mean that.’
Hermione, meanwhile, was eating at top speed.
‘No buts, Cas… just think about it all right?’ Dean hesitated, then said. ‘I know you don’t want touching, but I really think you need a hug, so I’m just gonna put my arm around here…’ Dean pulled Cas close and was surprised when Cas relaxed into him. He had expected Cas to remain stiff, as he always did when he let Dean hug him.
‘What is that in your pocket?’
The instrument tinkled to life and tiny puffs of green smoke issued from the miniscule silver tube at the top. Dumbledore watched the smoke closely, his brow furrowed. After a few seconds, the tiny puffs became a steady stream of smoke that thickened and coiled in the air… a serpent’s head grew out of the end of it, opening its mouth wide.
John took it and stared for a moment, then shook his head. 'He's hungry,' John said, giving it back to Sherlock. 'He didn't have dinner today.'
Hermione went over to Sherlock and gently shook him awake. He jerked slightly as he woke and looked around blearily.
‘But she
‘I could actually.’
Dumbledore didn’t answer, then comprehension dawned on Dean.
As Mullet shot towards the goalposts, the Bulgarian Keeper flew out to meet her. Whatever happened was over too quickly to see properly, but a whistle from Mostafa told them it was a foul.
Dean glanced at Cas, and pushed as much of his anger away as he could.
At the Ravenclaw table, Sherlock squirmed uncomfortably, having to resist the urge to climb over the tables to get to John.
‘Not you, Watson,’ he growled as the others left. ‘A word.’
Once they reached the silver swan portrait, Castiel said goodnight and went through it, but Sherlock hesitated. ‘I don’t have to stay in Ravenclaw Tower tonight, I could come up-’
‘Pus, Finnigan, pus, and it’s extremely valuable, so don’t waste it. You will collect the pus in these bottles. Wear your dragon-hide gloves, it can do funny things to the skin when undiluted.’
'Well then, proceed to Chapter Three.'
Dean dug through his pile of gifts until he found the one from Hermione. ‘A homework planner,’ Dean said. ‘Wow.’
The Death Eater controlling him swore loudly and Disapparated, followed by the two in the kitchen.
Cas nodded and followed Dean out of the castle and into the grounds, where Dean waited for his panic to ease up.
‘Maybe you could have a look for me,’ Dean grinned. ‘See how well I do.’
Dean blinked in surprise. ‘What for? I don’t need to practise it.’
‘’Course it is, if you’re dead,’ Ron snapped
‘Nah, I only care about it when I can watch you play.’
feel better to talk about it.’
Soon enough, Sherlock, John, Cas and Dean were through the doors and climbing the marble staircase.
Cedric Diggory was an extremely handsome boy in his seventh year. He was captain and Seeker of the Hufflepuff House Quidditch team.
‘Only a matter of time, then. Shall we go in?’
‘Igor Karkaroff,’ said a curt voice to their left. Mr Crouch was standing up in the middle of the bench, his face much less lined, and he looked fit and alert. ‘You have been brought from Azkaban to give evidence to the Ministry of Magic. We understand that you have important information for us.’
‘You’re very brave. I’m not.’
‘What?’ the barman grunted.
‘Get off me,’ Dean growled. ‘You’re all just as bad, you all - you could have - ‘ Dean ran out of words.
John shook his head, trying to get rid of the heavy feeling in his head. ‘Sorry, what?’ he said.
John cleared his throat and stood up, placing Dolly on his shoulder. ‘Yeah, I’m okay.’ He went into his trunk for some extra parchment and saw the tie boxes he and Sherlock had bought in Diagon Alley.
'I don't want you to be disheartened by the grade you received today,' she said and his eyebrows shot up. 'This is already a marked improvement on your previous performance, so I want you to think of this as a first step, rather than a failure. You're doing very well.'
‘Come on,’ said Dean, throwing an angry look at the crowd, but grabbing Sam and pulling him towards the wood. The rest of them followed, but stopped at the entrance. The coloured lanterns that had lit the path to the stadium had been extinguished, so there were a lot of people blundering around in the dark. Children were crying, anxious shouts and panicked voices reverberated around them, and John felt himself being pushed around by people whose faces he couldn’t see. Then he heard Ron yell in pain.
John nodded, then continued to fight off sleep while everyone else talked.
‘Sit down,’ Sherlock said, guiding him to one of the desks to sit on.
They walked through the village quietly, and once they'd passed the last building, Harry unfurled the note that Hagrid had given him.
‘Good evening, Professor Umbridge,’ they both mumbled, following her into the office.
'She says on no account whatsoever are you to take part in an illegal Defence Against the Dark Arts group. She says you'll be expelled for sure and your future will be ruined. She says there'll be plenty of time to learn how to defend yourself later and that you are too young to be worrying about that right now. She also advised the rest of you not to proceed with the group, though she accepts she has no authority over any of you, and simply begs you to remember she has your best interests at heart. She would have written all this to you, but if the owl had been intercepted you'd all have been in real trouble, and she can't say it for herself because she's on duty tonight.'
‘What?’ John whispered, his voice all but gone, as Sherlock made his third lap of the room.
‘I could list all of the species currently residing in the lake,’ Sherlock said in a feeble attempt at breaking the tension.
‘Describe the house to me,’ Sherlock said urgently, leaning closer.
‘Try looking again.’
Sorry I missed a week, I was in hospital for a little while, but don't worry, everything's fine now! The schedule's back to normal, so I'll see you all again in two weeks.
They both turned to look at them, faces screwed up in anger.
‘He’s going to do something to me. Whoever he has at Hogwarts will do it and I won’t be able to see him.’
Exhaustion finally forced him to let it go, and he fell back against his pillows, having lost what strength he’d gained back.
been blocking me?’
‘Where’ve you been?’
‘She says he’s not allowed them.’
Cas opened his mouth, but then a letter dropped in front of him. He looked at it curiously, then his eyes widened in horror, and he tried to push himself away from it, but it exploded, sending a wave of heat outwards. Cas’s books flew everywhere, one narrowly missing hitting Dean in the face.
‘Hermione would skin you alive if she knew you hadn’t been studying, and you know it. You’re just lucky I haven’t told her.’
'If you're going to make me confront my fears, it's only fair you do the same.'
‘Only a few drops of a Peace Draught,’ she said sheepishly. ‘Poor thing has been so worried.’
‘I get it,’ said Dean. ‘I dream about bad stuff happening to Sam too, sometimes. But I’m sure Gabriel’s okay. He’s tough.’
‘’Ow is zis boy supposed to ‘elp us?’ said Madame Maxime.
‘I don’t know where Barty Crouch is,’ Dumbledore told Moody, ‘but it is essential that we find him.’
‘Teaching,’ said Moody.
‘Mountain scenery?’ said Umbridge swiftly.
It was very loud inside, as many animals screeched and howled at them as they walked through the door.
‘Well, I’m not the one that has Double Divination,’ Sherlock shot back.
It was Colin Creevey. He edged into the room, beaming at Harry, and walked up to Snape’s desk.
'How long have you been teaching at Hogwarts?' Umbridge asked.
Cas scowled, but so Dean couldn’t see him. John sniggered, but stopped at Cas’s expression.
‘Cas not coming?’ John asked Dean, who was moodily shredding some tinsel.
Harry smiled. ‘As long as they keep me alive, I’ll take anything I can get.’
He had to freeze the Whomping Willow again by the time he got back, and it was a struggle squeezing everything through the passage. Cas was waiting for him, sitting quietly on the bed with a cup of water. He seemed calmer already.
‘I’ve been watching the way you write. You were used to writing with those - those sticks that Muggles use, correct?’
‘Got to,’ said Hermione. ‘Loads to do.’
‘Are you sure it was him? Because whatever that was, it’s repulsive.’
‘Yes?’
‘You didn’t,’ Cas murmured.
Sherlock cringed. ‘Yes, I’m fine. Stop doing that.’
Neville had gone extremely pale. ‘It sounded like someone being tortured!’ he exclaimed. ‘You’re going to have to fight the Cruciatus Curse!’
John stepped into the space Moody had cleared, his palms sweaty and his mouth dry.
‘Interesting. And how would you say that will affect the outcome of the tournament?’
‘Here.’ Molly pulled some tissues from her pocket and pressed them to John’s nose.
The four of them got dressed in silence, then headed down to the kitchen, meeting Sam, Dean and Castiel on the way down.
'I was wondering,' she said to Harry, 'if you'd thought any more about Defence Against the Dark Arts.'
Snow was filling up the windows now, and Cas stared out at it.
‘I can. We have presented our defense and answered all of your questions, and I am quite certain that the Wizengamot has better things to do than interrogate teenagers. Madam Bones, if you would?’
‘Seven past five from Stoatshead Hill,’ said a voice.
Professor McGonagall was gone in a swish of tartan.
Hedwig fluttered down onto Harry’s shoulder as soon as he finished and held out her leg, ready to go.
John was very glad to finally get some food, and sat heavily down at the Gryffindor table.
‘Harry,’ Hermione began in a pacifying voice.
‘Oh, good idea. He’ll know what to do.’
‘I’ve told Mr Crouch I’ll have it done by Tuesday,’ Percy said pompously. ‘That’s a bit sooner than he expected it, but I like to keep on top of things. I think he’ll be grateful I’ve done it in good time. I mean, it is extremely busy in our department just now, what with all the arrangements for the World Cup. We’re just not getting the support we need from the Department of Magical Games and Sports. Ludo Bagman-‘
John nodded, still breathing heavily and still quite disorientated.
is exactly going to help us against You-Know-Who, do you?’
When the desserts, too, had been demolished, Dumbledore got to his feet. The buzz of chatter filling the Hall ceased almost immediately.
‘That is not true,’ John said firmly.
Neville nodded nervously. Moody then reached into his jar for another spider, which he placed on the desk.
‘We gave it to him because he’s a great, bullying git,’ said George, ‘isn’t he, Harry?’
‘Thank you,’ said the voice. ‘Visitors, please take a badge and attach it to the front of your robes.’
They made their way to the edge of the Forest, where John always felt stronger, as well as for shelter from the biting wind.
‘There have been two hundred Portkeys placed at strategic points around Britain, and the nearest one to us is up the top of Stoatshead Hill, so that’s where we’re headed.’ Mr Weasley pointed ahead of them, where a large black mass rose from the ground.
‘We were just talking about the night when Mr Crouch turned up in the grounds,’ said Fudge, eager to change the subject at John’s expression. ‘It was you who found him, was it not, Harry?’
‘Mum told Ron not to spread it around,’ said Fred, grinning at Harry. ‘She said you got enough attention as it was.’
‘Goodnight, then.’
‘What? I don’t get it.’
‘That will be a job for Fawkes when he has finished keeping a lookout for anybody approaching,’ said Dumbledore. ‘But she may already know, that excellent clock of hers…’
‘No - come on!’ said Hagrid, looking a little anxious now. ‘I mean, a dog’ll bite yeh if yeh bait it, won’ it - but Thestrals have jus’ got a bad reputation because ‘o the death thing - people used ter think they were bad omens, didn’ they? Jus’ didn’ understand, did they?’
She stopped in front of Cas and said, ‘
‘No, that’s correct,’ Cas said, not taking his eyes off Dean.
exactly?’
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean was preoccupied by thoughts of his encounter with a Demon for much of the weekend, but, as always, Cas found a way to focus his attention. The last burst of autumn sunshine persisted, so they sat outside with their homework, instead of hunching over a table in the library. Cas brought his cauldron with him and coaxed Dean into teaching him some more, but found he still had a block about some ingredients, and the fire. Dean gently helped him move past his frustration and he completed his first fifth-year potion almost perfectly. His smile at his success was enough to put Dean in a good mood for the rest of the day, and he went to bed on Sunday night feeling upbeat and ready to help Harry teach.
As always, I'll add a preview to this story, so you'll all get a notification when I post the first chapter.
‘We know you were with him earlier. We noticed you weren’t here at lunch,’ Sherlock said.
‘Ouch, Cas comin’ in hot,’ Dean laughed.
‘Well thank you, Ginny,’ Dean grinned. ‘Here, I think these’ll suit you.’ He took off his glasses and gave them to Ginny.
The door to the telephone box sprang open and the three of them stepped out of it.
Hermione looked anxious again. 'Now don't fly off the handle again, please, but I really think you ought to teach anyone who wants to learn. I mean, we are talking about defending ourselves from Voldemort. Oh, don't be pathetic, Ron. It doesn't seem fair not to offer the chance to other people.'
‘What do you mean, you sae it happen?’
‘You – you – you are going to kill me too?’
Sherlock too turned red and the anger causing him to shake dissipated.
Cas nodded.
Harry gave him a grateful look, but no one else looked convinced.
Madam Pomfrey then reappeared, and they all crowded around her, hoping to get some answers.
‘No one did it,’ said Cas, prickling. ‘I fell.’
it puts a lot of emphasis on the Dark Arts.’
Dean leaned closer to Cas, slightly awed. ‘How did you do that?’
Dean jumped, not expecting the touch from Cas. It was still staticky from Cas’s regular Shield Charm.
John burst into derisive laughter and shook his head. 'That's funny,' he said to her. He then walked away, forcing the others to follow him into the Three Broomsticks, where she wouldn't possibly be able to hear what they were saying, packed as it was by Hogwarts students.
‘No thank you.’
Cas shrugged. ‘I don’t see how we can do anything about it, unless we know who’s doing it. I’ve never even heard of a curse that can block a Seer, let alone how to counter it.’
‘Silly girl,’ said Professor Sprout, shaking her head. ‘But Madam Pomfrey fixed her nose back on in the end.’
‘Sorry,’ said Sherlock.
'-I'll know you're back to normal,' said Hermione. 'Harry, yours is okay except for this bit at the end, I think you misheard Professor Sinistra, Europa's covered in ice, not mice - Harry?'
'She campaigned to have merpeople rounded up and tagged last year too. Imagine wasting your time and energy persecuting merpeople with toerags like Kreacher on the loose.'
Dean ran a hand through his hair. ‘And what’s with that - that sigil on his chest? I mean, the one on his back is a devil’s trap, I know one of those when I see one, but… It looks like Enochian, but not any I’ve seen before.’
‘Yes, as gamekeeper fresh air must be so difficult to come by,’ said Umbridge sweetly.
Cas grimaced slightly, but didn't say anything.
even. He then picked up Ron’s robes. ‘You know, I could fix these up, if you wanted.’
'He's going to be fine,' Cas said gently.
Cas’s breathing became shallow, fear filled his eyes.
'I suppose this is relevant?' Snape asked.
Hermione looked scandalised, but couldn’t say anything more, as they were separated back into their houses upon entry to the Great Hall.
'You must have been scared.'
The mascots finally separated, the Veela shrinking back into their usual, beautiful selves looking dispirited and forlorn, and the leprechauns zooming around, showering the Irish team in gold.
‘They don’t make them like that at Hogwarts,’ Ron groaned.
‘They’re freckles!’ Ron said furiously. ‘Now get back in your picture and leave me alone!’
Dean nodded. 'Okay, how do I do that?' he said breathlessly, his heart thumping against his ribcage.
‘Absolutely not,’ Sherlock replied, watching Fred step right up to the edge of the thin, gold Age Line, a scrap of parchment in his hand.
'Why not?’
worried about Cas.’
‘They’re making us stay here again,’ Dean grumbled, dumping his trunk with a loud thump.
Dean scooted the chair closer and held Cas’s hand. He was almost dozing off himself, when Cas finally moved.
‘Try telling him that.’
John had to smile at his enthusiasm. ‘All right, ask away.’
‘What?’ said Mr Weasley, looking rather frightened and pulling the bed covers higher up his chest. ‘No, no - it’s nothing - it’s - I -’ He seemed to deflate under Mrs Weasley’s piercing gaze. ‘Well - now don’t get upset, Molly, but Augustus Pye had an idea… he’s a Trainee Healer, you know, lovely young chap and very interested in … um … complementary medicine … I mean, some of these old Muggle remedies… well, they’re called
‘Better go,’ John said as the others got to their feet. ‘See you later.’ He gave Sherlock a quick peck then followed the others out, albeit slightly shakily.
‘Of course,’ Cas whispered.
‘That remains to be seen,’ said Sherlock as they entered the shop.
‘Mum found this stack of order forms when she was cleaning Fred and George’s room,’ Ron said quietly. ‘Price lists for stuff they’ve invented. Joke stuff, you know. Fake wands and trick sweets, loads of stuff. It was brilliant, I never knew they’d been inventing all that…’
He doubled over, a burning sensation spreading across all if his ribs and up to his shoulders. His vision shifted and it was suddenly dark. He was in a long corridor, and there was a loud hissing noise, but he couldn’t tell where it was coming from.
They looked up and saw Castiel standing there. He was wearing his ever-present trench coat, only now it fit much better since he seemed to have grown half a foot at least since the last time they had seen him. The effect of such a growth spurt made him look painfully thin, but now he was the same height as Sherlock, if not taller.
John was so enthralled by the speed at which the Beaters were hitting the Bludgers back and forth that he barely noticed when either team scored, nor that he was leaning forward in his seat.
'The Snitch! Where's the Snitch!' Charlie bellowed down the row.
‘Maybe an unused classroom?’ said Dean Thomas.
‘Hedwig turned up at the window,’ Ron told him. ‘She looked hurt so Harry took her to find someone to heal her.’
‘I was Senior Undersecretary to the Minister, yes. I am now the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher-’
‘Erm… anyway,’ said Hagrid, clearly struggling to regain the flow of his lesson, ‘so- Thestrals. Yeah. Well, there’s loads o’ good stuff abou’ them…’
‘You could see if Sherlock’s with him,’ Hermione suggested.
John didn’t answer; he just rubbed his chest until Sherlock returned, holding an envelope.
‘You okay?’ he asked.
‘Whoa, whoa, uh, hello?’ Dean said, he and Cas stopping in their tracks.
‘Death Eaters?’ said Madam Bones. ‘Why would they want to kidnap you?’
(See the end of the chapter for
‘He had a moment of weakness,’ Sherlock continued firmly. ‘He won't allow himself that again. You missed your chance.’
‘So, what are you going to name her?’ asked the witch.
‘How do you get in there?’ Hermione asked in a casual, innocent sort of voice.
‘Oh cool! How’d it go?’ Dean said, happily helping himself to a cup of tea, passing Cas one as he did so.
'Are you staying here for the night?' Sherlock asked.
‘Ah, yes, the supposed Seer.’
Dean and Cas lifted John up, while Sherlock kept squeezing the pressure point on John's hand. They all walked him back to the bed, ignoring the arguing between everyone else in the room. As soon as he was back under the covers, Cas brought him some of the potions on the list and helped him drink some.
Cas just shrugged.
Madam Bones frowned, and turned to the rest of the Wizengamot, where they all began whispering.
Just then, Harry began walking cautiously to the other side of the room.
‘I can’t. The Ministry restricted their lands again, so it’s dangerous for people to be around them right now.’
Dean was distracted for much of the day after that. Cas’s French always caught him by surprise, but he liked the sound of it; it gave him an idea.
‘Hi, I’m looking for John Watson,’ she said, holding up a big glass tank, with a large toad sitting contentedly inside.
Harry pulled out the Map again, and let them all out in small groups.
Stumped, Dean wandered around the grounds. He was just about to climb up to Ravenclaw Tower, when he looked out across the lake and spotted a figure sitting on the end of the dock by the boathouse.
‘I promised I wouldn’t. Please don’t make me say, I promised.’
‘’Night.’
‘Oh…’ said Hermione, trying to look modest. ‘Oh… well… yes, I suppose it is.’
Dobby beamed at him. ‘Name it, Harry Potter, sir!’
‘Yes,’ said Hermione at once, ‘yes, we were, you’re right, Ginny.’
‘Hermione, a wizard in Mr Crouch’s position can’t afford to have a house-elf who’s going to run amok with a wand!’ Percy said pompously.
Two people caught his attention, running through the wreckage. They were slightly less blurry than everyone else, and as John got near them, he recognised them.
‘No, they can’t have done, because I put a jinx on that piece of parchment we all signed,’ Hermione said grimly. ‘Believe me, if anyone’s run off and told Umbridge, we’ll know exactly who they are, and they will really regret it.’
‘Weasley, straighten your hat,’ Professor McGonagall snapped at Ron. ‘Now everyone, follow me, please. First-years in front… no pushing…’
‘I- I didn’t think you- I didn’t want to make things… awkward… You have enough to deal with.’
Hagrid pointed at the cow carcass. The whole class stared at it for a moment, then several people gasped. It must have been an odd sight: bits of flesh stripping themselves away from the bones and vanishing into thin air.
‘Well, it’s not for long,’ said Mr Weasley, peering at the four bunk-beds that had been squeezed into the bedroom. ‘I borrowed this from Perkins at the office. Doesn’t camp much anymore, poor fellow, he’s got lumbago.’ He picked up a dusty kettle and looked inside it. ‘We’ll need water…’
They laughed again, and John kissed him once more. ‘Let’s go. I’m tired.’
‘Phineas.
‘Merlin’s beard,’ said Mr Diggory, his eyes widening. ‘Harry? Harry
Cas nodded, trying his very best not to cry and control himself.
'This was the only way I could come up with of answering Harry's letter without resorting to code - and codes are breakable.'
Hermione quickly read it and her expression became stony.
‘Baddock, Malcolm!’
'What the hell is this?' John demanded, heat rising up his neck.
They reached the Entrance Hall, where they were joined by Sherlock, Cas and Dean. They were just about to go into the Great Hall, when a loud voice rang out behind them.
‘Sure.’
‘There are those who’ll turn innocent occasions to their advantage,’ Moody retorted in a menacing voice. ‘It’s my job to think the way Dark wizards do, Karkaroff, as you ought to remember-‘
'Dimitrov! Levski! Dimitrov! Ivanova – oh, I say!' roared Bagman.
Cas’s eyebrows rose.
John looked nervously over at Sherlock, unable to tell if his unease was simply caused by the man’s appearance, or something more. Sherlock furrowed his brow thoughtfully and stared at the man.
small, Ludo,’ said Rita Skeeter.
Ron groaned dramatically.
See you again soon!
They queued up outside the classroom, where Hermione joined them right at the last minute, after having been in the library. When they entered, they took seats at the front of the classroom and pulled out their copies of
He pulled Sherlock aside after the lesson. ‘What’s the matter with you? I get it, you’re upset about something and you don’t want to tell me. Fine. Just stop messing with me. Everyone already hates me, and I have double Potions next, and I can’t deal with any more, all right, so just
‘Yes, it is, Mars is completely out of place.’
‘Very well, Karkaroff,’ Crouch said coldly, ‘you have been of assistance. I shall review your case. You will return to Azkaban in the meantime…’
‘I thought you might like that one,’ Dean grinned. ‘What class do you have next? I’ll walk you.’ He moved slightly too close to Cas and a shock jolted up his side. ‘Ouch!’ he yelped, jumping away.
Neville shrugged. ‘It’s just the truth. Most of us feel the same way – well most of us that know about it anyway – so I don’t think anyone really minds if you see something a bit private.’
‘I have Gabriel,’ Cas muttered stubbornly.
‘I couldn’t leave you. Not while…’
‘Barty, they’re just kids,’ whispered a witch.
Harry and Ron sat nearby at dinner looking bored and tired, having left almost all of their homework for the weekend. They drew out their meal as much as possible before trudging back up to the common room.
He then did the same with Harry’s wand.
Harry appeared a moment later, and they both sat, breathing fast.
'You okay?' he asked.
'I asked Madam Pomfrey not to tell her. I didn't want to give her any reason to suspect me.'
Dean and Katie had started dancing too. Dean moved confidently, a hand firmly at her waist, and lightly spinning her around.
Half an hour later, Harry finally appeared in the common room with an odd expression. He sank into the chair next to Hermione’s.
Cas just shouldered his bag and said goodnight.
'I'm talking about
‘Dean-’
Dumbledore got to his feet. ‘I have given evidence already on this matter,’ he said. ‘Severus Snape was indeed a Death Eater. However, he rejoined our side before Lord Voldemort’s downfall and turned spy for us, at great personal risk. He is now no more Death Eater than I am.’
Just then, Ludo Bagman charged into the box. 'Everyone ready?' he said, his face gleaming in excitement. 'Minister, ready to go?'
Cas screwed his eyes shut, and with great effort, lifted his arm. The logs began to split and float into the fire. Cas let out a breath and dragged himself onto his knees. Dean helped him up the rest of the way.
Dean had already spent a number of evenings in her office, so sat down in his usual seat at one of the small tables.
‘Herbology.’
They were silent again until Ron said, ‘But you still haven’t told us how you got in this state,’ gesturing at his bloodstained face.
Ron chucked a snowball at George, but missed.
The endeavour seemed entirely pointless, because the Skrewts didn’t seem to have mouths.
‘I was bored,’ said Sherlock.
‘I won’t let it,’ Sherlock said in a quiet voice.
A party was raging inside and Fred and George had raided the kitchens. Thankfully, no one noticed John come in, so he was able to slip upstairs to the dormitory unnoticed.
Cas flinched, then sighed. 'Whatever you say, Sherlock.' Cas walked away and began tidying up the hospital wing, then placed a jug of water at John's bedside.
As Dean expected, most of the class were still wearing confused and nervous expressions. Harry, Neville, John and a Slytherin boy Dean didn’t know were the only ones looking at the Thestral.
Cas was silent as they left the castle, but his fists were clenched tightly.
After a minute, John uttered a soft gasp and shuddered as he came out of the vision.
‘Strange…’ Her eyes slid over to Sherlock, who was staring resolutely at the fire. ‘I don’t see why a curse designed to block your vision would affect this. Perhaps you’ve been focusing too much on the other aspects of your power.’
‘Er – good’ said Harry.
'And now, without further ado,' Bagman said, 'allow me to introduce… the Bulgarian team mascots!'
The grey owl landed in front of her, closely followed by four barn owls, a brown owl and a tawny, all of whom were jostling close to her trying to deliver their letters first.
‘We told you to destroy them!’ Mrs Weasley said furiously, holding up what were unmistakeably more Ton-Tongue Toffees. ‘We told you to get rid of the lot! Empty your pockets, go on, both of you!’
‘“Same time, same place”. Does he mean the fire in the common room?’
Hagrid stared at her, clearly at a loss to understand why she was acting as though he did not understand normal English. Dean was shaking with anger by now.
‘Er -
Cas nodded.
‘You guys are no help at all, you know that?’
‘Did you kiss?’ Hermione asked briskly.
'Sure, where are you going?'
‘You wanted to see me?’ he said, sitting on the end of one of the desks.
He finally recognised it as Sherlock’s voice and followed it until the ante-chamber flickered back into view.
Sherlock shook his head. Even he wasn’t feeling particularly up to answering any question, but he opened his mouth anyway. ‘You-Know-Who,’ he breathed. ‘He’s back.’
John looked down at his feet. ‘Yeah. I saw it.’
‘But what were Voldemort’s – sorry – You-Know-Who’s supporters up to, levitating Muggles?’ said Harry. ‘What’s the point?’
‘I think you might. I'll take you to the eye doctor when you come and stay.’
We've got to do something about what a dreadful teacher she is. We're not learning any Defence from her at all.'
The arguing suddenly stopped, and Fudge left the ward, slamming the door behind him.
Cas returned with a large bowl, and eventually everyone but Ron finished their homework, but no one wanted to go to bed until Harry came back.
‘Yes.’
‘Get under here!’ Harry said quickly, seizing the Invisibility Cloak.
‘Why don’t you go to Madam Pomfrey and ask? I’m sure she’d be happy to tell you.’
Dean nodded. ‘Well, thanks for looking, I guess. Mince pie?’ He offered one from the plate he’d been aimlessly carrying around.
‘Hi, Percy,’ said Harry.
Moody walked away, and John and Sherlock carried on up to Gryffindor Tower. It was warmer in there, so John took off his cloak and draped it over one of the chairs, choosing to lean on it rather than sit on it.
being intercepted too.’
‘I don’t think you get enough credit for how smart you are.’
Cas crumpled slightly, rubbing his arm and biting his lip at the same time.
‘I’m all right!’ she said, coming out from behind the kitchen counter. ‘I’m not hurt.’
This time, Mr Crouch made no move to stop them as Sherlock marched them out of the clearing. It wasn’t until they were about half way out of the woods that they realised Harry, Ron and Hermione had not followed them.
Lupin checked his watch. ‘An hour at the most, I’d say.’
Harry was getting the message to the Gryffindor Quidditch team at lunch, but Dean took a break from it, grabbed a sandwich, and took the stairs up to the second floor, two at a time, eager as he was to finally give Cas the glass jar. He got there first, and made himself sit down to wait, knee bouncing in anticipation.
They went into separate cubicles and John started to put his on. It was a nice, silky material, but he was slightly dismayed to find that the legs were too long. He did quite like the colour, however.
‘Thank you for your help, Elder Oseus,’ said Sherlock.
‘I am the High Inquisitor-’
He closed his eyes to concentrate on that alone. It got slightly clearer and he managed to identify it as a vague annoyance before it slipped away. He gasped and opened his eyes.
‘You got it?’ said Dean.
They all slipped and slid across the Entrance Hall and through the double doors.
John sniggered. ‘Yeah well, some things are just meant to be.’
‘Sam, stop-’
Fred and George - clean shaven again - seemed to have taken their disappointment fairly well.
John then saw Castiel attempting to sneak past him. ‘Cas!’ he called, stopping him at the foot of the marble staircase.
‘Is he really?’
Cas allowed himself a small smile, despite the seriousness of the situation. 'Someone has to keep it together, and I'm usually quite good in a crisis. Usually.' He shifted slightly closer to Dean. 'Give it a couple of hours, and I'm sure I'll be the same blubbering mess I always am.'
‘I get it, these lessons are tough, but you’re doing great,’ Dean said bracingly.
‘Hello,’ he said nervously.
'I'll get some more blankets.'
‘How did they know where I live?’ John asked, pain building in the back of his head.
The door of the office opened.
‘I miss her so much, Dean,’ Cas said thickly, welling up.
Sherlock laughed. ‘Of course.’
Cas squinted and snorted. 'I knew he'd have something up his sleeve.’
Dean shrugged. ‘He was practically catatonic by the time I got him to Madam Pomfrey, but she says he’ll be okay.’
‘I swear I will throw this at you-’
'I wonder,' said Professor McGonagall in cold fury, turning on Umbridge, 'how you expect to gain an idea of my usual teaching methods if you continue to interrupt me? You see, I do not generally permit people to talk while I am talking.'
‘He will be. He’s just really afraid of being Transfigured into an animal.’
‘It’s easy,’ said Fred. ‘Concealed door behind a painting of a fruit bowl. You tickle the pear and it giggles, and-’ He stopped and looked at her suspiciously. ‘Why?’
Dumbledore cleared his throat again. ‘As I was saying,’ he said, ‘we are to have the honour of hosting a very exciting event over the coming months, an event which has not been held for over a century. It is my very great pleasure to inform you that the Triwizard Tournament will be taking place at Hogwarts this year.’
‘What’s that supposed to mean?’ Hermione said defiantly.
right?’
'I have Quidditch practice, but we can study afterwards.'
‘Don’t be daft,’ said Mr Weasley, waving a hand. ‘”
'Well, better expelled and able to defend yourselves than sitting safely in school without a clue. How are you organising this group anyway? Where are you meeting?'
‘Yes,’ came Cas’s hoarse voice. He uncurled, then sat against the wall. His eyes and nose were red.
‘No, the last of it’s in the kettle,’ said Mr Weasley. ‘How about tea?’
she said slowly and loudly, as though speaking to somebody deaf. ‘You’re Hagrid, are you?’
Sherlock shook his head. ‘There are a lot of people that disagree, but thank you. Don’t worry about tomorrow, I’ll help you.’
'Seriously, Cas, it's not your fault.'
‘Shut up, Pig,’ said Ron, edging his way between two of the four beds that had been squeezed into the room. ‘John and Sherlock, you’re in here with us,’ Ron told them. ‘And I think Sam, Dean and Cas are downstairs with either Fred and George, or Bill and Charlie. I can’t remember which. Percy gets to keep his room all to himself because he’s got to
‘Shut up, Dean.’
‘I can come with you, if you’d like,’ he murmured.
It took a moment for the emotions to filter through, since the note was not handwritten, but John put the letter down when he felt a certain instability from it. A vaguely threatening energy emanated from the rest of the letters, especially from the one Hermione was about to pick up.
‘Easy for you to say, stuck here!’ bellowed Fred. ‘I don’t see you risking your neck!’
'Wild!' he said, twiddling the replay knob on the side. 'I can make that old bloke down there pick his nose again… and again… and again…'
‘Yeah, true,’ said Ron.
'Wow. Thanks, Professor.'
‘I don’t know if any of these things are preventable,’ Sam continued, ‘but I think Seers should at least know the risks so they can be prepared.’
John rolled his eyes and turned back to Sherlock. ‘Come on, tell me what happened.’
‘It’s okay. This is Dean. He goes to my school.’
‘Dumbledore’s reading what signs?’ said Ron, looking perplexed.
‘You’re in my head enough, you should bloody well know by now.’
‘To Grubbly-Plank,’ said Harry. ‘And I met McGonagall… she said communications in and out of the castle are being watched.’
Cas smiled at him. ‘Dean, this is exactly why you’ll be a good teacher. You can tell what someone needs to learn, and that’s the most important skill a teacher has.’
‘But I think Durmstrang must be somewhere in the far north,’ Hermione said thoughtfully. ‘Somewhere very cold, because they’ve got fur capes as part of their uniforms.’
‘Forgot about what?’ Dean asked.
‘One drop each,’ said George. ‘We only need to be a few months older.’
They all ran for it, but Cas stopped outside the boys' dormitory.
‘That’s private information,’ Dean said, narrowing his eyes. ‘He doesn’t have to tell you.’
'Aren't you going to miss your friends?' Neville said in concern.
John just stood, clutching the box.
stopped fading from the back of his hand after a time.
‘I’ll do my best,’ Cas said.
‘I knew it,’ Mr Weasley said heavily. ‘
Cas's expression softened. 'I appreciate that.'
Before anyone could move, Malfoy suddenly went flying across the room, and the Great Hall fell silent, looking around to see who had cast the spell, but no one had their wands drawn.
Dean grinned. ‘That’s how it is, is it?’
‘You - are - a -
‘That’s rude. What’s your problem?’ Dean asked.
‘It matters because we don’t want to draw attention to the fact that Harry’s having visions of things happening hundreds of miles away!’ said Sirius. ‘Do you have any idea what the Ministry would do with that kind of information?’
John welled up. ‘Are you sure?’ he asked, his voice constricted.
‘Why?’
‘That idiot, Hogwarts champion?’ said Ron.
John shook his head, biting his lip so hard it drew blood.
Hermione frowned. 'I don't know if it's a good idea. It might make you late for Sirius.'
Sherlock grabbed John’s arm. ‘Are you sure?’
‘And now it’s gone.’
He leaned in and kissed Sherlock again, before he could say anything.
‘That’s not the point!’ raged Mr Weasley. ‘You wait till I tell your mother-‘
‘Later.’
‘Great,’ John smiled. He signed the parchment and handed it back.
‘If zat is ze case, then I am sadly disappointed in zis deception.’
‘John-?’
‘Can we be the Anti-Umbridge League,’ Angelina Johnson said hopefully.
‘And then there was a big row,’ said Ginny, ‘because Mum wants them to join the Ministry like Dad, but they just want to open a joke shop.’
Cas’s eyes widened. 'When I…’
John decided to give himself some rest that week, though Hermione kept him up to date on his homework. He did make sure that he went down for meals, just so that he wouldn’t go stir crazy sitting around in Gryffindor Tower all day.
Cas bit his lip. ‘If you’re sure…’
Harry looked as though he hadn’t, in fact, considered asking Cho out properly, shocked as he was by her advances.
‘I don’t know,’ Cas mumbled miserably, downing the potion.
‘You will take them back to school, Hagrid,’ Dumbledore repeated firmly. ‘Take them right up to Gryffindor Tower. I want you all to stay there - unless you need to be elsewhere, Castiel?’ Dumbledore gave Cas a meaningful look.
John nodded at the window and gestured at Cas.
'Wiped out by the giants. My family is descended from the clan that lived in the Alps, on my mother's side. All gone now, though. It's only through people like me that we know they existed at all.'
the custard creams we hexed!’
he thought. If he wore this one, and Sherlock wore his own, then…
John could feel his regret and sympathy.
Professor McGonagall left without a word.
tomorrow.’
‘Ah, yes, so it is… I don’t know these little bits of paper…’
John shrugged. ‘He’s around somewhere.’ He speared a sausage with his fork and took small bites of it.
‘Oh, okay. What about this?’ He pointed at a small graze along Castiel’s jawline.
John sighed. ‘That was Voldemort,’ he said quietly, ignoring Sherlock’s flinch at the name.
John awoke the next morning and, though he had managed to get a relatively good night’s sleep, he sat up feeling nauseous. He was alone in the dormitory, so took his time getting dressed. He went down to breakfast, where Sam, Dean and Cas were eating.
‘I’m sure Professor Dumbledore will tell you… now, behave, won’t you?
Cas bit his lip, raised his wand, and said, ‘
‘What are you doing down here?’ Dean asked. ‘What happened?’
‘Yeah, I think so,’ said John. ‘Let’s go.’
‘Oh, stood over there, did they?’ said Mr Crouch, turning his popping eyes on Hermione. ‘Said an incantation, did they? You seem very well informed about how the Mark is summoned, missy.’
Dean piled food onto his plate, eager to eat, but eager to finish so he could talk to Dumbledore. He reached across the table for a jug of gravy, but he didn't quite make it, his scars restricting his movement. Hermione passed it to him without a word. Dean poured his gravy, rubbing the spot on his shoulder that felt the tightest, and began wolfing down his food. The upside to having werewolf scratches was that Sam no longer bothered him about what he ate. He always just put it down to whatever weird lycanthropic craving Dean was having that day. He'd also had to start shaving, much to Sam's amusement. Not that he didn't enjoy the looks he got for it, but they never came from the one person he wanted them to. He glanced up at Cas's empty seat again, earning himself an eye roll from Sherlock.
They trudged up the misty field between long rows of tents. Most looked almost ordinary; their owners had clearly tried to make them as Muggle-like as possible, but slipped up by adding chimneys, or weather-vanes. Others were so clearly magical that it was no wonder Mr Roberts was getting suspicious. One even looked like a miniature palace, complete with several live peacocks tethered outside.
Cas had fresh bandages on and was sitting up in bed talking with Madam Pomfrey when Dean returned. He smiled at Dean, but faltered when he saw Dean’s puffy eyes. ‘What happened?’
‘Do you think Ron’s dad really did get attacked?’ Neville asked in a small voice.
'We could always poison her,' Ron said, shoving away the work he'd given up on.
Sherlock sat John down by the fire, but he could barely feel it.
‘Oh, only.’
‘My pleasure.’
‘Where?’ several students said eagerly, all looking in different directions.
‘Better?’ Dean asked while Cas Banished his broom.
John pulled his hand away, half expecting to see blood, but there was nothing there. ‘Yeah, I just-’ He cut himself off, hissing through his teeth. ‘It hurts-
Welcome back everyone! thanks to hhhelcat and VashtaNerada for the comments, they really brighten up my day :) It's been four years since I started this series, how crazy is that! See you all next time!
‘Oh… yeah… well, we need to be a bit more careful, he’s been asking Kingsley and me funny questions…’
Winky lowered her head and whispered, '
'So why are you telling me now? You could have said anything when I walked in here.'
‘Antidotes,’ said Snape, looking around at them all. ‘You should all have prepared your recipes now. I want you to brew them carefully, and then we will be selecting someone on whom to test one…’
‘You all right?’ Ron said.
John watched her for a moment. She had always been kind to him, he thought. ‘Molly?’
Sherlock just sighed and left again.
Welcome back everyone! Thanks to VegasGranny, axl and hhhelcat for the comments!
John pushed his bowl of porridge away, no longer hungry, and rested his eyes until he felt Sherlock sit beside him. ‘I don’t know where I was,’ he mumbled.
At last the food was finished, and talking ceased immediately as everyone turned to face Dumbledore.
hidden,’ Hermione said in surprise, ‘everyone knows that… well, everyone who’s read
They found Harry again on their way down to the dungeons.
‘Oh, please,’ said Madame Maxime. ‘Who’s to say ‘e is even telling ze truth?’
‘Have fun with the Skrewts,’ John said to Sherlock, as the afternoon bell rang.
‘Yeah, that was a dumb question.’
Cas looked down at the table. ‘Defence Against the Dark Arts,’ he mumbled.
‘Any news of Bertha Jorkins yet, Ludo?’ Mr Weasley asked as Bagman settled on the grass by the fire.
‘I’ve got two Neptunes here,’ said Harry, frowning at his parchment, ‘that can’t be right, can it?’
‘Yeah, and she
John nodded, then exhaled and relaxed a little. ‘I’m okay,’ he said, slightly croakily.
'What did he say?'
‘You know, funnily enough, that doesn’t actually make me feel better, Sherlock.’
Molly, and they work very well on - on Muggle wounds -’
'Right. Second year.’
‘You sound so certain.’
‘You’re kidding, right? Look at you, you’re Quidditch captain-‘
Slowly, and with his face screwed up, Wormtail did as he was told.
Malfoy looked up. ‘Imagine them not even getting his name right, Weasley, it’s almost as though he’s a complete nonentity, isn’t it?’ he crowed. He straightened the paper with a flourish, and read on:
'What-'
‘Don’t make me regret missing you,’ he muttered.
Sherlock disappeared to find the owl treats and John waited with their things by the counter. There were elaborate cages stacked up behind the counter and John squinted at them, wondering what they were for. Suddenly, he felt a weight on his shoulder, and a deep croak in his ear.
Cas took a deep breath. ‘All right.’
'Are you really a Seer?’ Luna asked, still staring at him.
‘Okay, we’ll do that after we pick up our robes. I think you need some new school ones anyway. Your ones from last year are too short.’
But none of the other Ministry wizards seemed it remotely likely that any of them had conjured the skull. On the contrary, at Hermione’s words, they had raised their wands and were pointing in the direction she had indicated.
‘I got your potion, here.’ Dean gently lifted his head and helped him drink it. Immediately, colour returned to his cheeks, and he smiled at Dean.
Dean poured himself a goblet of orange juice in an attempt to keep himself awake.
John hung back by the door, uncomfortably aware that he didn’t belong there, and waited for Bagman to tell him what he wanted.
It took a few rounds, but Sam helped Cas get his breathing down to a normal rate.
Cas nodded.
Hermione sighed. ‘Get better soon, all right?’ she said to Cas, then let Ginny lead her out of the room.
John found his mother in the kitchen, looking slightly unnerved, surrounded by people she didn’t know, but making them all a cup of tea anyway.
‘Yeah, it’s me,’ Dean smiled, brushing Cas’s hair from his face and stroking his cheek.
‘I tried to warn you,’ Dean grinned.
Sorry it's been so long since the last update, I kinda got stuck in a pit of writer's block and a near death experience, but I'm back and here we are.
His mother grimaced. ‘You already are. Keep talking to people, okay? Me, Sherlock, your friends. Anyone.’
'Guys, can you take your tiff somewhere else?' said Dean. 'Some of us are trying to sleep.'
Sherlock then came up with a hefty bag in his hands. ‘What’s going on?’ he said, putting the bag on the counter.
‘Come here, then,’ said Dumbledore to the Weasleys, Harry, John and Sherlock. ‘And quickly, before anyone else joins us.’
‘These spells all have defensive applications. What were you using them for?’
'Me, Harry, Cas and probably Sherlock.'
Cas's eyes widened in fear. 'I- I don't know, Dean.’
‘Seems that way,’ Mr Weasley said, smiling wryly. ‘Let me introduce you to everyone. My son, Percy, he’s just started at the Ministry – and this is Fred, no, George, sorry –
It was almost instantaneous. John was sucked into near darkness and took a moment to get his bearings. The fire was flickering and there was Bertha, hanging limply in the air. Wormtail swam into view, as did the grotesque, foetus-like Voldemort. His wand was raised and then came the screams.
(See the end of the chapter for
'Now that is one perfect Cure for Boils,' Dean grinned, bottling some of it up. 'That's going right to Madam Pomfrey.'
Dean put his glasses away and they went down to the Great Hall together, where Cas ate a whole bowl of soup, before he went on his patrol.
‘Of course.’ Professor McGonagall got up and moved swiftly to the door. ‘What about Molly?’ she asked, pausing at the door.
‘Yes. He talks to me… Maybe he still wants to tell me. If I try to get him alone again… ‘
'I've already read Chapter Two,' said Hermione.
Umbridge looked as though she had been slapped in the face. She did not speak, but began scribbling furiously on her parchment.
‘Off with that Ravenclaw boy again, were you?’ she said suggestively, waggling her eyebrows at him.
John hopped off the desk and followed Sherlock outside, doubling over as he was hit by a wave of dizziness.
Cas dropped down next to Krum and ran his wand over Krum’s prone form. ‘
tell your other you’ve been gambling,’ Mr Weasley implored Fred and George, as they all made their way down the purple-carpeted stairs.
‘That’s what I mean! You wouldn’t have needed practice. You’d know what the hell it is you’re meant to be looking at.’
John sighed in relief as the vision filling his mind was pushed away and replaced by the familiar impression of Sherlock. ‘Thank you,’ he whispered.
‘Well, I had this idea,’ Sam said. ‘Professor Sprout said I need to challenge myself, and then Professor Flitwick said it might be good if I did a research project.’
They strolled casually up to a window that displayed a dummy wearing green nylon and, one by one, stepped through the glass.
Cas rolled his eyes. ‘You have no sense of self-preservation at all, do you?’
‘Why would he do that?’ Dean said, rubbing the sleep from his eyes.
John shook his head, munching on his toast. ‘No, I’ll go today,’ he said. ‘Cas and Dean will be here tomorrow and we won’t have time after.’ He caught a glimpse of Sherlock’s concerned face and quickly looked away. His stomach was suddenly quite fluttery, so he ate some more toast, hoping it would go away.
‘Oh yeah?’ said Moody quietly, limping forward a few steps. ‘Well, I know your father, boy… you tell him Moody’s keeping a close eye on his son… you tell him from me… now your Head of house will be Snape, will it?’
Then Ludo Bagman Apparated right next to Mr Weasley, looking breathless and disorientated. He span on the spot, staring up the emerald green skull. ‘The Dark Mark!’ he panted, almost trampling on Winky. ‘Who did it? Did you get them? Barty! What’s going on?’
The huge billboard wiped clear of its adverts and now showed BULGARIA: ZERO, IRELAND: ZERO.
‘I mean, if it’s a question of influence with the Ministry, I don’t think they’ve got much of a chance… from what my father says, they’ve been looking for an excuse to sack Arthur Weasley for years… and as for Potter… my father says it’s a matter of time before the Ministry has him carted off to St Mungo’s… apparently they’ve got a special ward for people whose brains have been addled by magic.’
Mrs Weasley nodded.
‘It’s not like you had much of a choice,’ Sherlock muttered.
(See the end of the chapter for
‘I’d better be going,’ said the witch, and she Disapparated.
Dennis’s guess was closer. As the giant black shape flew over the Forest, the light from the castle windows hit it, and revealed it to be a gigantic, powder-blue, horse-drawn carriage, the size of a large house.
'Just go and stop them, then,' Harry said irritably.
'It's all right. And I do need to eat, I just don't have much of an appetite.'
‘But what if-‘
‘You did really great.’
Cas had been in the Forest before, and though not exactly comfortable with it, was at least familiar with it. ‘
'Have you always had it? What exactly is it?' Dean said eagerly.
‘Oh, fantastic.’
‘I do,’ Sherlock said.
‘Look at that, you started a revolution,’ Dean said to Cas, helping him sit up.
‘I - I do,’ said Karkaroff breathlessly. ‘And these were important supporters, mark you. People I saw with my own two eyes doing his bidding. I give this information as a sign that I fully and totally renounce him, and am filled with a remorse so deep I can barely-’
‘Tonks. You can call me Tonks.’
Dean sat close to Cas while he did his best to eat, and not saying anything when all Cas could manage was a few bites of a solitary piece of toast.
Dean quickly glanced around the room to make sure no one was eavesdropping. He was becoming more and more confident, and less embarrassed by his reading ability, but that didn’t mean he wanted everyone to know, so he lowered his voice. ‘So, uh, Cas has been helping me to read,’ he told her, ignoring her raised eyebrows. ‘He says I have… uh, what did he call it? Dyslexia, I think.’
‘Let’s say next Wednesday night, then,’ said Harry, ‘and we can decide on future meetings then. Come on, we’d better get going.’
‘Yes. It seems that your assessment of the Skrewts as murder lobsters was quite accurate. I tried to pick one up, and it was not pleased.’
‘If?’ whispered Voldemort. ‘
Though his hands shook as he added ingredients, Dean watched Cas make the potion with pride. In such a short amount of time, Cas had already made great improvements. They spent much of the day relaxing once the potion was finished, only making an effort to go on Cas’s patrol. Towards the end of the day, however, Cas became much more withdrawn, and let go of Dean’s hand. Dean knew that he was already thinking of their detention the next day. This became more obvious to Dean when Cas refused dinner and walked silently to the hospital wing.
‘So, what set it off this morning?’ Dean asked as they walked across the lawn. ‘Was it that notice? I’m pretty sure we’re doing the defence lessons anyway, but if you’re worried, you don’t have to do it.’
'Sure.'
‘Madam Pomfrey says you’re getting better,’ Dean told him. ‘You’ll be outta here in no time.’
‘Wow!’ the woman said enthusiastically.
Dean gave him his space and grinned at John and Sherlock when they came in.
‘Of course.’ Mrs Weasley began rifling through a drawer in one of the cabinets.
Once all the food had been consumed, Dumbledore stood, and asked everyone to do the same. When they did, he waved his wand, and all the tables zoomed out to the edges of the room, leaving the floor clear. He then conjured a stage, with accompanying instruments, and the Weird Sisters trooped out onto it, their clothes artfully ripped. They picked up their instruments and struck up a slow, mournful tune.
‘Father! Father, I wasn’t involved! No! No! Father, please!’
‘Who’s the letter from?’ John asked, struggling to keep up with everyone else’s much longer legs.
‘I think that’s enough for today,’ Dean said near the end of lunch, hauling Ron to his feet.
He came back to them, red in the face. ‘I’m going with Parvati, you’re going with her sister Padma,’ he said to Ron.
Umbridge launched into what seemed to be a well-rehearsed speech, and Dean's concentration disappeared almost immediately. He felt himself getting fidgety, so he looked around to watch everyone else.
Sherlock smiled at him. ‘I appreciate your faith in me, John, but I’m afraid I know as much about this as you do. Perhaps we should visit the centaurs again when we return to Hogwarts.’
John pulled Sherlock closer to sit in front of him, and went to take his hands, but he pulled away. ‘Come on,’ he said exasperatedly, ‘you know that skin contact works best.’
‘Dean
'Where do you wanna study today?' Dean asked Cas as they left the Great Hall.
The Ravenclaws were all waiting in the classroom, arguing with each other. Cas had been laid on a few desks pushed together.
‘The Atrium,’ the voice said in the lift, and a sallow-skinned wiard got in.
‘I’m afraid not,’ said Lupin sympathetically. ‘The spells are only so strong, and if you’re not here, then there’s no reason for them to try and break through.’
Just then, the door to the hospital wing opened, and in came Dumbledore, Harry, and Sirius in his dog form.
John gave Fred and George a meaningful look. They were confused for a second, then excitedly pulled money from their pockets.
her, I just think she's an absolutely appalling teacher and a real old fraud.'
‘I’m going to bed,’ Harry said shortly. ‘See you in the morning.’
Cas's lip trembled. 'I don't know,' he said. 'Something bad.'
‘You see? I’m not his type, it would never work out.’
John glanced back up at Bagman, but he was still preoccupied by the other champions. ‘Why didn’t you say anything?’
He asked them not to talk about Neville's parents, and wished Harry good luck with the third task, before finally dismissing them from his office.
‘No, it’s fine. Just give me a minute.’ His whole body was heavy, he could barely open his eyes, but the gnawing in his stomach motivated him to pull himself together, albeit slowly.
Ron looked at him in surprise, the robes already looking a thousand times better than they had only moments ago. ‘Er- I reckon you should change the colour,’ he said.
'That's exactly what he thinks you're doing,' said Sirius, 'or rather, that's what he's afraid Dumbledore's doing - forming his own private army, with which he will be able to take on the Ministry of Magic.'
Gabriel’s smile slid away. ‘Listen, guys, he’s been having a really tough time lately, and it’s all a little much for him. You don’t need to worry about him, he’s somewhere safe and quiet.’
‘Yeah, all right.’
'I'm not,’ Cas said, sounding angry with himself.
'No, I can't. No one can know.' Cas wrapped his arms around himself. 'If Umbridge finds out, I don't know what she would do to me.'
Cas stared at him, stunned.
‘I can tell,’ she said, stroking his head. ‘Sounds like you had a year of it.’
‘Pritchard, Graham!’
(See the end of the chapter for
‘Sorry to barge in, Mrs Watson,’ Sherlock said, stepping over to them. He was still in his pajamas.
They stepped through the portrait hole, but were greeted by Ron and Hermione screaming at each other from opposite sides of the common room.
Cas hesitated before sitting at the other one, staring at the Black Quill waiting for him.
Cas said nothing more on the way, and sighed when they reached the eagle-shaped door knocker.
‘Shut it!’ Fred bellowed.
John called to Sherlock, struggling to ground himself.
‘You say that, Gabe, but I don’t see it,’ said Cedric.
‘It was all right,’ John shrugged. He considered telling them about the vision he’d had of Voldemort, but a slight shake of the head from Sherlock changed his mind. ‘I think we were both just waiting for it to be over. My family already have a difficult enough time accepting that I’m a wizard. Trying to explain being a Seer is pretty much impossible.’
Sam scribbled frantically. ‘Okay, when did you start experiencing symptoms and side-effects?’
She came in to the cubicle and cast a critical eye over him. ‘You’ll definitely be taking these?’
‘Maybe just a little,’ said Cas, eyes watering.
‘This dog will be staying with Harry,’ Dumbledore said simply. ‘I assure you, he is very well trained.’
Dean avoided his eyes. 'I did,' he said evasively.
Cas bought a single, small rosette and pinned it to his jumper.
Dean squeezed Cas’s hand even tighter. ‘Please tell me,’ Dean said, welling up. ‘I can help you, please just tell me.’
John came down the hallway, followed by Sherlock. ‘Great, I was hoping she would get here before we go.’
‘You’re my friend. I trust you, and besides, the whole school will know what happened to me by now. I don’t see any reason to keep hiding. And, Dean, you were right too. It
‘You have to pass a test to Apparate?’ Harry asked.
‘Oh,’ said Cas, considering John carefully. ‘I’d like to see you try.’
By the last day of term, neither Harry or Ron had managed to find a date for the Ball, despite Harry being required to, and they moped about Gryffindor Tower.
Cas then came into the room clutching several phials of potion. He was followed by the Winchesters and the majority of the Weaslys. He handed a purple potion to Sherlock and John. ‘This should help with the pain,’ he told them, then moved on. Bill was holding a bedsheet to one arm which was bleeding profusely. Charlie had a large rip in his shirt, and Percy was sporting a bloody nose.
Moody grinned. ‘Well, help him practise for this one. Grab a Winchester or two, and I’ll be very surprised if he doesn’t win,’ he said. ‘Might be better to get some rest first,’ he added, looking at John. ‘In the meantime… constant vigilance, Potter. Constant vigilance…’
‘Don’t worry about me, I’m not going anywhere like this. Madam Pomfrey will take care of me, and I just want - I just want some time alone. Is that all right?’
John groaned.
‘No,’ said Mrs Weasley suspiciously, ‘why?
What does that even mean?’
‘I can tell that they’re there, but it’s sort of like they’re behind this veil…’ John shivered involuntarily.
John could tell that this was what she had been dying to ask the whole time. ‘Well - erm-’
‘Hagrid, what the hell is that?’ Dean choked.
‘Because you’re not of age and you haven’t had your test,’ Mrs Weasley snapped. ‘And where have those girls got to?’ She bustled out of the room and up they heard her climbing the stairs.
‘Professor Lupin,’ John smiled.
‘PEEVES!’ yelled an angry voice. ‘Peeves, come down here at ONCE!’
‘Don’t bother, Cas, I just pushed myself too hard last night. Your potions probably wouldn’t work anyway, since that’s just my luck.’
'Weird vision.'
‘Lift him up.’
Harry yelled.
he thought, but it didn’t help much.
‘Yeah, of course.’
‘The only thing I want to see is a headache cure,’ said Harry.
Cas gave him a bit of potion and directed him over to Percy.
‘Colin, I fell in!’ he said shrilly, throwing himself into the empty seat. ‘It was brilliant! And something in the water grabbed me and pushed me back in the boat!’
‘Yeah, Castiel.’
‘Aaaah,’ said Ron, imitating Trelawney’s mystical whisper, ‘when two Neptunes appear in the sky, it is a sure sign that a midget in glasses is being born, Harry…’
‘You’ve got to know,’ Moody said. ‘It seems harsh, maybe,
‘Well, the class seems fairly advanced for their level,’ she said briskly. ‘Though I would question whether it is advisable to teach them a potion like the Strengthening Solution. I think the Ministry would prefer it if that were removed from the syllabus.’
Bagman whipped out his wand, directed it at his own throat and said, '
Dean went with Cas back through Hogsmeade, mystified, but relieved. Cas knew exactly when to drop the subject, but there were prickles on the back of Dean’s neck the whole afternoon. He couldn’t stop thinking about when he and Sam had been cornered by a Demon, and how he’d clawed his way out of it, dragging Sam with him.
‘What – what are you doing?’ said McGonagall, her eyes following the ferret’s progress through the air.
And up the stairs into the box came the seven defeated Bulgarian players. The crowd applauded appreciatively, and a thousand Omniocular lenses flashed in their direction.
‘What?’ Dean said, picking up on Cas’s sudden discomfort.
John scanned the room for Gabriel to ask him instead, but couldn’t see him anywhere. ‘Isn’t the Head Boy supposed to be in here for meals?’
‘Are you feeling better?’ Dean said quietly.
‘Riddle?’ said Sherlock, sitting up straight. ‘Like Tom Riddle?’
‘Did you find him?’ Dean asked, his heart jumping to his throat.
'Because I've just seen Sirius's head in the fire.'
‘Jeez, what is everyone’s problem?’ Dean muttered to himself.
‘Then the Dark Mark…’ It rattled around in his head for a moment, and he again saw flashes of Harry and Cedric in the graveyard before gaining control again.
John nodded and flopped down on the sofa.
Umbridge looked at him coldly, then hoisted her handbag a little higher into the crook of her arm and said, ‘I shall, of course, be informing the Minister of your late return.’
Hermione cast an appraising eye over the veiled witch. ‘Umbridge is shorter than that woman,’ Hermione said quietly. ‘And anyway, even if Umbridge does come here, there’s nothing she can do to stop us. I’ve checked the rules and we’re not out of bounds; I specifically asked Professor Flitwick whether students are allowed to come in the Hog’s Head, and he said yes, but he advised me to bring our own glasses. And I’ve looked up everything I can think of about study groups and homework groups and they’re definitely allowed. I just don’t think it’s a good idea to
Cas curled up against the arm of one of the sofas before the fire. Dean warmed himself up in front of it before sitting next to Cas. He conjured a mug and some steaming hot chocolate and passed it to Cas.
‘Er,’ she said, her voice slightly higher than usual out of nerves. ‘Well - er - hi.’
‘Er,’ Ron said tentatively, ‘my dad told me about one… is it the Imperius Curse, or something?’
Dean waited for her to leave, then sat down next to Cas, taking his hand. ‘You don’t have to do this,’ he said. ‘You’re not ready, you can’t even stand yet.’
‘Hi, Colin,’ Harry said wearily.
‘Yeah, he is, Mr Weasley,’ Harry said earnestly
John shook his head vigorously, and Dean saw that he was sweating. ‘No. No, they can still be caught.’ He tried to pull away from Sherlock, but Sherlock gripped him tighter.
He gestured at himself. 'I look ridiculous.’
‘I’m looking for my brother Castiel. A house-elf told me he might be here.’
(See the end of the chapter for
‘Yeah, but I wouldn’t go there,’ John said with an amused smile.
‘This is my favourite time of day,’ said Cas.
‘Wait,’ Neville said as John made to leave. ‘You didn’t happen to –
brother,' Sherlock snapped.
'I don't want to be here.'
‘Ton-Tongue Toffee,’ Fred said brightly. ‘George and I invented them. ‘We’ve been looking for someone to test them all summer…’
‘There was, actually. I think his name was Frank.’
‘Bertha Jorkins again?’ Sherlock whispered, but John had already been deafened by the vision. ‘Do we have any water?’ he asked those gathered around the fire.
, don’t they? And-and sick leave, and pensions, and everything?’
‘How did we miss this?’ Harry said.
'He's dead,' John said harshly.
‘You think she knows?’ he laughed.
‘We’ll talk about something else. Just walk with me, please?’
Wrinkles creased Cas’s forehead. ‘Where is this going, Dean?’
John groaned, already feeling the terrible atmosphere of Grimmauld Place.
‘You’re getting really good,’ Harry said, beaming around at them. ‘When we get back from the holidays, we can start doing some of the big stuff - maybe even Patronuses.’
‘I would recommend you something black, Sherlock, and a white one might look good with yours, John.’
‘Nagini has interesting news, Wormtail,’ he said.
‘She sure did,’ Dean sniggered.
Cas chewed a fingernail.
‘First pus and now this,’ muttered Seamus.
Visitors to the Ministry are expected to submit to a search and present their wands for registration at the security desk, which is located at the far end of the Atrium.’
'You're less like your father than I thought,' Sirius said, a definite coolness in his voice. 'The risk would have been what made it fun for James.'
The witch with the monocle, Madam Bones, cut across him in a booming voice.
Her eyes swept the cabin and landed on Cas and Dean. ‘What are you two doing out here?’ she asked incredulously.
‘You’ve been different lately.’
‘Apologise!’ Hagrid snarled, as Karkaroff gasped for breath, his feet dangling in mid-air.
'It's lunch,' Dean said, holding up the food he brought.
Sherlock sat up and stretched, taking in John’s pale and drawn face. ‘There will be time for a nap hen we arrive, I think,’ he said.
Hermione had knocked over her goblet and pumpkin juice spread steadily over the tablecloth, but Hermione paid no attention. ‘There are house-elves
‘All right, then,’ Dean said, clapping his hands together. ‘Everyone get into pairs, grab out your wands. Cas, you’re with me.’
‘Dobby?’ Harry said thickly, peering at him.
‘Oh, Bagman’s
The kitchen was already packed with Hermione and every single Weasley, including a couple of extras it seemed.
When he landed, he found himself in what he assumed was the Hufflepuff boys’ dormitory. He was standing beside Cedric, who was sitting on his bed, and Gabriel was sitting on his own bed across from them.
‘Yes!’ Gabriel whooped. ‘Awesome, let’s go.’
The silvery light that had caught Harry’s eye was coming from the basin’s contents. They couldn’t tell whether the substance was liquid or gas. It was a bright, whitish silver, and it was moving ceaselessly; the surface of it became ruffled like water beneath wind, and then, like clouds, separated and swirled smoothly. It looked like light made liquid - or like wind made solid.
'Yes, but the world isn't split into good people and Death Eaters,' Sirius said wryly. 'I know she's a nasty piece of work - you should hear Remus talk about her since she drafted that anti-werewolf legislation. It makes it almost impossible for him to get a job.'
‘It’s not
This was rather more difficult; the whole group fell silent.
‘Not now, Dean,’ Gabriel interrupted. ‘We have to get him upstairs.’
‘What is all this noise about?’ Snape had arrived.
‘I know about the regurgitating toilet,’ said Mr Weasley.
It was horribly warm outside, with only a slight breeze to alleviate it. The leaves on the hedges outside their house had begun to curl and turn brown. John walked down the street, ignoring all the children running around, and giving the ones playing with a hose a wide berth.
‘Unfortunately,’ Sherlock said. ‘Water?’
‘Maybe it’s back in the tent,’ said Ron.
‘You can sit there, I don’t think Perkins is here yet,’ said Mr Weasley, picking up a toaster from his desk that appeared to be hiccoughing.
In the very middle of the row sat Cornelius Fudge, to his left a square-jawed witch wearing a monocle, and on his right was another witch, but she was sitting so far back on her bench that her face was in shadow.
‘Oh, Professor, look!’ Lavender squealed excitedly. ‘I think I’ve got an unaspected planet! Which one’s that, Professor?’
Sherlock groaned, holding John’s hands. ‘You’re never any fun. What’s the harm, you hate Divination too.’
‘I think I know where you’re going with this,’ said John. ‘Maybe you should send an owl to Fleur Delacour. Wasn’t she friends with Cas?’
Mrs Weasley gasped, clapping her hands to her mouth. ‘It’s not true.’
‘No, it’s not that,’ said Moody, ‘it’s just that Potter and Watson want a word with you, Dumbledore. They’re just outside the door.’
‘No one’s going to hurt you.’
‘You should have seen Krum,’ Ron interrupted. ‘He was absolutely amazing, and we got to see him right up close, as well. We were in the Top Box-‘
Cas lowered his wand. ‘I can’t,’ he said.
The kettle had already been switched back on when he went back into the kitchen.
‘Mr Filch, the caretaker, has asked me to tell you that the list of objects now forbidden in the castle, has this year been expanded to include Screaming Yo-Yos, Fanged Frisbees, and Ever-Bashing Boomerangs. The full list comprises of some four hundred and thirty-seven items, I believe, and can be viewed in Mr Filch’s office, if anyone would like to check it.’ The corners of his mouth twitched, then he continued. ‘As ever, I would like to remind you all that the Forest in the grounds is out of bounds to all students, as is the village of Hogsmeade to all below third-year.’
‘Or else - well…’ Fudge sounded embarrassed. ‘Well, I’ll reserve judgement until after I’ve seen  the place where he was found, but you say it was just past the Beauxbatons carriage? Dumbledore, you know what that woman
‘Go on, I’ve got it covered,’ Dean said.
‘Thanks, Basil,’ said Mr Weasley, and he beckoned everyone to follow him.
‘Cas-’
‘You know, the urge to consult the orb has never once overpowered me,’ John muttered to Harry and Ron, who struggled to control their laughter.
‘How this situation arose, we do not know,’ he said. ‘It seems to me, however, that we have no choice but to accept it. Both Cedric and Harry have been chosen to compete in the Tournament. This, therefore, they will do.’
They’ll be announcing their engagement any day now.’
Oseus fixed him with a piercing stare, then came over to him. ‘Can you stand?’
Without anyone noticing, Castiel had walked around the Entrance Hall, and came up behind Malfoy. He reached over Malfoy’s shoulder and jerked the paper out of his hands.
'Why are we out here?' Cas asked.
‘Awesome,’ Dean laughed, putting on his new pair of glasses. These ones were blue. ‘There’s a way we can improve this though. I think I need fancier glasses.’
‘What are these orb things, then? You think that’s what he wants?’
Cas was helping organise the Winchesters’ things inside their tent.
'Hark who's talking, you walked out of Divination, you hate Trelawney!' Ron said indignantly.
‘I go through with it. It’s easy.’ He took a handful of the powder from the pot and threw it into the fire, stepping into the flames with their bags in hand. ‘Holmes Estate,’ he said, then he and the bags spun out of sight.
They didn’t even have to call for the centaurs this time, and were surrounded as soon as they were past the treeline.
‘Where?’ spluttered Mrs Weasley. ‘If I’d seen that, I’d have known you were alive!’
Harry nodded eagerly. ‘Can we start tomorrow?’
‘Mad-Eye, you do know that’s disgusting, don’t you?’ Tonks said conversationally.
‘Just you, then,’ said Ron. ‘Go on, then, how d’you hide a place like Hogwarts?’
Cas looked horrified. ‘Why would you do that?’ he demanded.
‘Wait, are we going by Floo powder?’ said John.
‘Professor Dumbledore!’ he said, his eyes widening. ‘What the-?’
‘Because she was crying,’ Harry added.
‘Amelia Bones is okay!’ Tonks said earnestly. ‘She’s fair, she’ll hear you out.’
Cas sat sideways on the broom behind him, and encouraged the broom higher.
‘Mademoiselle Delacour, could we have you forward first, please?’ said Ollivander. He twirled Fleur’s wand in his hands and it emitted pink and gold sparks. ‘Yes,’ he said quietly, ‘nine and a half inches… inflexible… rosewood… and containing… dear me…’
‘Awesome,’ Dean grinned.
‘I’m sorry about yours too.’
‘Let me…’ Cas touched his wand to Dean’s head and healed the wound.
John nodded, and they both braved the bitter cold outside.
‘It sounds brilliant,’ said Harry. ‘It sounds perfect, Dobby. When can you show us where it is?’
‘Yeah, a couple of ‘em were visitin’ ev’ry day, bringin’ gifts ter the Gurg-’
'Sounds… fun. Where did you learn to fly like that anyway?' Dean asked as they walked away from the stadium.
Cas looked up at him.  'I need your help,' Cas admitted. 'Gabriel is supposed to help me, and I can't-' A sob cut him off and the air shimmered as Cas glowed in front of him. Cas put a hand over his mouth. 'I can't make it stop.'
Then the fire blazed green again and Dumbledore reappeared, stepping out of the fire.
‘I hope so,’ their mother whispered back. ‘He’s having a rough go of it.’
Mr Weasley unbolted the front door, and they stepped out into the cold, grey dawn.
‘Yes,’ Hermione said sniffily, ‘and it’s got a horrible reputation. According to
‘Oh. Just leave him, he’ll find somewhere comfortable,’ Neville said back, equally as groggy.
'Sure, Muggle Studies would have been a cinch, but I wouldn't get that added bonus of making fun of Trelawney,' Dean laughed. 'Besides, I'm actually kinda good at it.'
‘No, don’t worry,’ John said, shaking his head slightly.
John leaned over to kiss Sherlock’s cheek, and climbed out of bed, taking his time to get dressed. He quietly made his way to the kitchen, where he found Mr and Mrs Weasley, Sirius, Lupin and Tonks already sitting around the table.
‘On my own!’
Cas nodded and sucked a deep breath in through his nose. 'All right. Let's go.’
Then, the door burst open once more and everyone but John and Sherlock looked up.
Then Moody’s voice echoed distantly in his mind.
‘He’s healing all right, but I don’t think this has all sunk in for him yet. I keep expecting him to crash,’ Dean whispered, sitting up.
‘Goodnight, John.’
‘I’ll be havin’ a few words with her, an’ all,’ said Hagrid, stomping up the stairs. ‘The less you lot ‘ave ter do with these foreigners, the happier yeh’ll be. Yeh can’t trust any of ‘em.’
Cas nodded.
'Yeah, yeah, get outta here,' Dean said, shooing the owl away. He ripped the letter open and eagerly began to read, with Sam reading over his shoulder. The further through the letter they read, the further their expressions dropped. Sam's eyebrows furrowed and Dean's face went completely blank but for a slight tightening around his lips. Then, without any warning, Dean screwed up the letter and slammed it down on the table.
(See the end of the chapter for
‘Why not?’
Sherlock scrambled over to John, grabbing his shoulders. 'John, go back to bed…'
‘You ought to know, too, that as High Inquisitor it is my unfortunate but necessary duty to inspect my fellow teachers. So I daresay we shall meet again soon enough. You two, back up to the castle.’
‘It’s fine,’ Dean snapped. ‘’Cause, you know what? Next month I’ll be seventeen, and then none of you can stop me from doing what I gotta do.’
Moody’s magical eye spun to stare at Ron, and after a moment, he smiled. ‘You’ll be Arthur Weasley’s son, eh?’ Moody said. ‘Your father got me out of a very tight corner a few days ago… yeah, I’m just staying the one year. Special favour to Dumbledore… one year, and then back to my quiet retirement.’ He gave a harsh laugh and clapped his hands together. ‘So – straight into it. Curses. They come in many strengths and forms. Now, according to the Ministry, I’m supposed to teach you counter-curses and leave it at that. I’m not supposed to show you what illegal Dark curses look like until you’re in the sixth year. You’re not supposed to be old enough to deal with it ‘til then. But Professor Dumbledore’s got a higher opinion of your nerves. He reckons you can cope, and I say, the sooner you know what you’re up against, the better. How are you supposed to defend yourself against something you’ve never seen? A wizard who’s about to put an illegal curse on you isn’t going to tell you what he’s about to do. He’s not going to do it nice and polite to your face. You need to be prepared. You need to be alert and watchful. You need to put that away, Miss Brown, while I’m talking.’
'Tell him what? That you saw a pink snake that may or may not have been Nagini, but you can't tell because it was
They sat in chairs that had seemingly been put out for them. As they did so, Fawkes the phoenix lifted off his golden perch by the door and gracefully placed himself on Sherlock’s shoulder.
‘Thank you,’ John mumbled back.
Mr Weasley took them eagerly and immediately began breaking matches trying to light them.
‘Interrogators: Cornelius Oswald Fudge, Minister for Magic; Amelia Susan Bones, Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement; Dolores Jane Umbridge, Senior Undersecretary to the Minister. Court Scribe, Percy Ignatius Weasley.’
‘Okay, okay… what do I do now?’
Welcome back everyone! Thanks to hhhelcat for the comment!
‘All right, everybody, settle down,’ he called out, and the chatter died down as everyone turned to face him and Harry.
‘Nearly six,’ Ron muttered, standing next to John. ‘How do you reckon they’re coming? The train?’
‘All right.’
Cho sat down near Ron, and everyone else gathered around excitedly, pulling chairs with them. Once they were all seated and watching Harry expectantly, Hermione cleared her throat.
John nodded, resigned to the fact that this would most likely be the first question people asked him from now on.
‘Well, it does seem like your kind of thing,’ John smiled. ‘You are really good at Herbology.’
Angeline, however, said quickly, ‘The Quidditch season’s about to start, we need team practices too!’
‘She’s
‘Not Harriet, if you don’t want to,’ she snorted.
Even after months together, Sherlock was still hesitant with John, as though worried that even the gentlest touch would push him away.
‘Don’t tell me you’re going to the library again?’ said Harry.
‘Right, erm… I don’t really know how to describe it.’
'And now, please greet – the Irish National Quidditch Team!' Bagman yelled. 'Presenting – Connolly! Ryan! Troy! Mullet! Moran! Quiggley! Aaaaaand –
‘A Seer?’ Madam Bones said with interest.
‘What’s up with her?’ said Ron. ‘Why can’t she run?’
Hermione sighed and laid down her quill.
Out of the corner of his eye, Dean saw Cas back away slightly, and discretely placed himself between Cas and Karkaroff.
‘There’s something…’
‘Sorry. You-Know-Who was there, and Wormtail. Was anyone else there, like an old man?’
Dean nodded. ‘Okay, so that must mean he’s not scared, which is good.’
‘And what exactly is this “long term issue”?’ Umbridge asked, her voice taking on an even more sugary tone.
Right, yeah.’ John closed his eyes and concentrated on Harry’s wand, almost confident that his familiarity with it would make it easier for him to see it. ‘Okay, yeah, I can see it slipping out of your pocket in the – in the Top Box.’ But it disappeared again when a wave of nausea hit him.
‘Winchester, Samuel!’
'By all accounts, he is no loss!' blustered Fudge. 'It seems he is responsible for several deaths!'
An extremely tense silence followed these words.
‘And what exactly are
Harry said incredulously.
John looked around and jumped when he realised he was sitting next to Professor Dumbledore. ‘Professor!’ he gasped, but Dumbledore didn’t move. ‘Professor?’ He waved a hand in front of Dumbledore’s face to no reaction.
Snape’s lip curled. ‘Obviously.’
‘Oh and where’s the proof of that?’ snapped Hermione.
‘Yes, I am.’
Despite his discomfort, John couldn’t help but smile at Sam’s enthusiasm. ‘I can see the past, so for example, yesterday you…’ He stared at Sam until the room shifted and he saw Sam sitting next to a bookcase. ‘You were reading the
Dean dropped it, unwilling to push Cas further. ‘Listen, it’s gonna be okay. You’re safe now. You’re coming to live with me and Sam, you never have to go back there.’
‘Damn.’
going to die for it,’ said Moody.
‘Ah, I was forgetting… you don't like the Dementors, do you, Albus?’
‘Oh yeah, they’re pretty serious about it,’ said Dean. ‘They tested some stuff on me last year.’
'Not really. I didn't want you to think differently of me.'
‘I have a bruise on that shoulder. I fell out of bed.’
‘Yeah,’ said Harry, straightening up. ‘What was it?’
Then, without warning, the silence was rent by a loud voice shouting out a spell.
Might have gone slightly overboard with this one, but I hope you all enjoyed it anyway, and I'll see you again next time!
Welcome back everyone! Thanks to OtakuElf, UnluckySiren and hhhelcat for the comments!
‘Are you sure you want to do this?’ Sherlock said.
, Fred!’ Mr Weasley shouted. ‘What on earth did you give that Muggle boy?’
‘I’ll go with you,’ John repeated firmly.
Dean shook his head. ‘No,’ he mumbled, wiping his eyes. ‘You’re okay with him moving in with us?’
‘Er – no,’ said Fred.
There was a murmur of excitement and the room began to clear in the usual twos and threes, wishing Dean and Harry a ‘Merry Christmas’ as they went.
'What? No, I want to stay with you.'
something we haven't seen before… oh, this could turn nasty…'
‘We’re allowed out at night!’ Dean hissed. ‘Go, hurry up!’
‘You’ve had an owl,’ Ron said to Harry, pointing at Harry’s bed, where Grace was sitting patiently. ‘And we’ve got our detentions tomorrow night, Snape’s dungeon.’ He then walked straight out of the room, not looking at either of them.
'Can I help you, Winchester?' she asked.
Dean pushed his way between the house tables, against the flow of students trying to leave the Hall. He finally emerged at the top of the room and ran towards Dumbledore, but was stopped by McGonagall before he could reach him.
Sherlock didn’t offer any further protest, and finally allowed himself to rest.
John drank from the goblet that Sherlock pushed into his hands, and Sherlock helped him wipe away the rest of the blood on his face, while Dumbledore explained what a Pensieve was for. His brain felt as though it were rattling around inside his skull.
Sherlock nodded, and helped John drink some.
They hurried up the spiral staircase behind the gargoyle, to Dumbledore’s polished oak door and brass knocker.
At Dean's outburst, adrenaline rushed through Castiel's body until he was gasping for air, hands clutching the front of his robes so tightly his knuckles turned white. Then Sam's voice came through to him.
‘Not my priority right now.’ Sherlock winced at a throbbing in his temples.
John shook his head, trying to force his eyes remain open, though it felt like a losing battle.
‘It wasn’t a nightmare!’ Harry insisted.
‘My dears, it is time for us to consider the stars,’ she said eventually. ‘The movements of the planets and the mysterious portents they reveal only to those who understand the steps of the celestial dance. Human destiny may be deciphered by the planetary rays.’
Sherlock waited patiently for John to finish, rocking in his chair, then lead him to the large fireplace out by the front door.
'But - but what about John?'
Madam Pomfrey siphoned a drop of Cas’s blood into one more phial full of clear liquid that turned jet black as soon as the blood touched it.
‘Er… Arthur Weasley, Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office, here to escort Harry Potter and John Watson, who have both been asked to attend a disciplinary hearing…’
you see?’
it a threat?'
‘Wow. Cool. Do you wanna do it again?’ Dean asked Cas. ‘Where’s my wand?’
‘Hi, Hagrid!’ Harry yelled, seeing a gigantic silhouette at the end of the platform.
Sherlock looked doubtful.
There had been no major incident so far, and he was starting to feel almost normal, until Castiel returned to the castle.
‘Where did you hear that?’
‘Well - change o’ scene, yeh know -’
‘Oh, come on, it’s all a load of rubbish, what do you care?’
but students don’t normally go in there, so I don’t think we’ll be overheard.
Sherlock jumped again and hastily wiped his eyes. ‘Can Harry borrow your owl?’ Sherlock asked Cas.
There was a
‘I have my reasons,’ said Cas, gently holding Dean’s hand.
‘Of course,’ Sam said. ‘You should go to Dumbledore about this. Maybe he can get Cas’s dad arrested or something.’
John tried to take a deep breath, but felt worse when he was unable.
‘Well… well, I don’t know whether you know what - what stitches are?’
They took a tour of the girls’ tent which was smaller but without the smell of cats, then moved onto the Winchesters’ tent. Inside was smaller than the Weasley’s, but seemed to be more comfortable. There were only two rooms, one being a small bathroom with a shower. The other contained the kitchen, a table with chairs, two single beds up against one wall, and a third that it snugly in an alcove in another wall.
Umbridge gave him an indulgent smile, and Dean opened his mouth furiously, but John elbowed him hard before he could say anything.
'Hermione, this was all your idea!' said Harry.
Indeed, yes. According to Nagini, there is an old Muggle standing right outside this room, listening to every word we say.’
‘I could use another wizard, that is true…’
'How do you do? How do you do?' said Fudge. 'Let's see, introductions. You know Arthur Weasley, I daresay?'
‘Why? What does it mean?’ Dean asked.
'Does it?'
Cas shook his head.
Mr Weasley was helpless to stop the twins as they handed over all their money.
Sherlock left and John climbed into the comfortable bed, wishing his bed at Hogwarts was as soft.
The opportunity arose when they were alone at lunch. Hermione had dragged Harry and Ron up to the library, Cas was helping in the hospital wing, providing potions both for calming nerves, and his own, highly effective Pepperup Potion.
‘What happened?’
At his words, John was reminded that he and Mr Crouch were both Ministry officials, and found himself reluctant to demonstrate. It seemed that Sherlock too had realised this, and the two of them remained in the shadowy entrance.
John chuckled. ‘Yeah, I remember.’
… erm…’
‘Hey,’ Dean said softly, ignoring all the Ravenclaws and bending down next to Cas.
‘No!’ Harry said angrily. ‘I was having a dream at first about something completely different, something stupid… and then this interrupted it. It was real. Mr Weasley was asleep on the floor and he was attacked by a gigantic snake.’
screamed Malfoy.
‘Already took the lights out,’ Moody said to himself, rummaging around in his cloak.
‘Are you worried about me?’
a Seer!' John insisted, pressing his hands to his temples. 'I'm a Seer, and I saw Voldemort and all his Death Eaters.
‘Father, I didn’t!’ shrieked the boy. ‘I didn’t, I swear it, Father, don’t send me back to the Dementors-’
‘She’s not wrong,’ mumbled Harry, and a couple of people laughed.
Soon, other people made their way over to the dance floor. John bit his lip, looking at Sherlock. He took a deep breath and opened his mouth, but lost his resolve, instead saying, 'Molly, do you want to dance?’
'Harry,' she said timidly, 'don't you see? This is exactly why we need you. We need to know what it's like facing him… facing V-Voldemort.'
All the judges sat down at the velvet table, with the champions sitting opposite, and Ollivander standing in the space between.
‘Do you think he’s asking them?’ Dean whispered to Ron.
‘Morning,’ John replied.
Mr Weasley smiled at him. ‘Ready for today?’ he asked.
‘Do you think this’ll work?’ Dean said quietly to Sherlock.
‘More like ten, actually,’ said John.
Cas started violently awake, and the bed frame cracked.
‘Go on, then, Potter,’ Malfoy cut in, drawing his own wand. ‘Moody’s not here to look after you now - do it if you’ve got the guts-’
It soared towards them, pulled through the air by a dozen winged horses, all palominos, and each the size of an elephant. It landed with an almighty crash and the horses’ hooves, larger than dinner plates, hit the ground. The door of the carriage bore the Beauxbatons coat of arms, a pair of golden, crossed wands, each emitting three stars. The door opened and a boy in pale blue robes jumped down from the carriage. He bent forwards, fumbled for a moment with something on the carriage floor and unfolded a set of golden steps. He sprang back respectfully, then a shining, high-heeled shoe the size of a child’s sled emerged from the carriage, followed by the largest woman they’d ever seen. The size of the carriage and the horses was immediately explained. As she stepped into the light flooding from the Entrance Hall, she was revealed to have a handsome, olive-skinned face and large, black, liquid-looking eyes. Her hair was drawn back in a shining knob at the base of her neck. She was dressed from head to foot in black satin, and many magnificent opals gleamed at her throat and on her thick fingers.
She began with 'Abercrombie, Euan!' who came to Gryffindor, and ended with 'Zeller, Rose!' who went to Hufflepuff.
‘What, I can’t ask? With your sister, I knew since she started school, but you, I had no idea.’
‘Yeah, probably not. No one wants toads these days,’ she sighed.
'Because of Lucy,' Cas finished.
George shrugged. ‘It’s the first week back. Easing them into it.’
'Only if you have a real dinner, you didn't eat anything at lunch,' Dean said, rolling his parchment up miserably.
‘What?’ Gabriel turned him around to look at it.
Sam said indignantly.
wrong and we gotta do something about it. Professor, I don't think he's safe.'
‘Wasn’ room ter swing a Kneazle,’ said Hagrid.
Throughout the week, the castle underwent a thorough cleaning, even the portraits and suits of armour receiving a scrubbing, and all the teachers became snappy and tense.
‘In the garden, I expect,’ she said. ‘He likes chasing the gnomes, he’s never seen any before.’
‘Well I – we have this connection thing, right? You can feel m and I used to feel you sometimes, but now it’s gone.’
‘Library?’ suggested Katie Bell after a few moments.
‘I keep this,’ said the wizard, impaling the slip on a small brass spike. ‘You get this back,’ he added, shoving the wand back at John.
John laughed, but then was accosted by a blinding pain in his head. The whole room vibrated, blurring the alarmed faces looking at him. ‘
The Creevey brothers were both very enthusiastic, but they flourished their wands far too much, causing several books to fly off the bookcases instead of each others’ wands. They both seemed very excited to be Disarmed by Sam, who appeared to master the spell quite quickly.
‘And there’s a picture, Weasley!’ said Malfoy, flipping the paper over and holding it up. ‘A picture of your parents outside your house – if you can call it a house! Your mother could do with losing a bit of weight, couldn’t she?’
Dean’s eyes widened as he felt how wet the jumper was beneath his fingers, and realised that it was actually blue but soaked in blood. He lowered Cas to the floor and aimed his wand. ‘
'I know.'
‘Good evening, Professor,’ Sherlock said to Dumbledore, who was sitting at his desk, wearing an embroidered purple dressing gown.
What seemed like a huge green and gold comet came zooming across the pitch. It split itself in half and flew across to each of the goalposts. A bright rainbow arched between them, connecting them for a moment before fading again. The two balls came together again in the centre of the pitch, merging to form a huge shamrock.
John woke with a start early in the morning, waking Sherlock with him. Mrs Weasley had hung some clean clothes on the back of the door for him, a nice comfortable jumper and jeans.
The woman’s face relaxed into a gracious smile, and she walked towards Dumbledore, extending a glittering hand. Though tall himself, Dumbledore barely had to bend to kiss her hand.
Everyone turned to look at them, so Sherlock urged John forward.
He spent most of the lesson staring into space, unwilling and unable to focus on what Professor McGonagall was saying.
'Wait, wait, I don't know if I can do that,' Dean said nervously. 'I mean, sure I have experience, but I've never killed a Basilisk or anything, that's pretty cool, how did you even do that?'
Neville seemed to understand what had just happened, and he aggressively shook his head, looking more than a little ill. He crossed the room back to his own bed and drew the curtains.
‘Dean, please.’
‘May I introduce Mr Ollivander?’ said Dumbledore. ‘He will be checking your wands to ensure that they are in good condition before the tournament.’
‘It’s a dragon!’ shrieked one of the first-years, losing her head completely.
Mrs Weasley waved her wand over the stove as he closed the kitchen door. ‘What would you like for breakfast? Porridge? Muffins? Bacon and eggs? Toast?’
‘At least now we know what happens if you ignore them,’ said Sherlock.
‘We’ve been hearing explosions out of their room for ages, but we never thought they were actually
‘That almost sounded smart,’ Sherlock said, snorting softly.
‘Like who?’ Ron said, shocked.
Dean gave John a discreet thumbs up and got a faint smile in return.
Cas blinked and the spoon fell out of his hand.
Sherlock shrugged. ‘I’ve sent a message to my brother, but I don’t see why we would get any further than we have before. No one wants to take responsibility.’
‘Why do you not look happy about that?’
‘No, I’ll be all right, thanks,’ he smiled. He caught Sherlock’s intense expression and cleared his throat. ‘We ought to work out how to… how to control it… better,’ he said, trailing off as his stomach fluttered.
‘You witnessed them?’ Madam Bones asked, leaning forward intently. ‘How many of them?’
‘Watson isn’t a champion.’
‘Actually, I think we will,’ Ginny said, grabbing Hermione’s arm. ‘Come on, Hermione.’ She dragged Hermione out of the room, and they heard them both climbing the stairs with purpose in their steps.
Dean knew exactly what had happened and he could feel the static from Cas’s Shield Charm pushing him away. He waited until conversation resumed and Malfoy stomped away, seemingly no worse for wear.
He sloped away into the frame of the portrait and disappeared from view at the very moment the office door opened again. Fred, George and Ginny were ushered inside by Professor McGonagall, all three of them looking dishevelled and shocked, still in their nightclothes.
John sniggered. ‘He really doesn’t want to go, then.’
Umbridge held out her hand. ‘They’re clearly helping you cheat. I will be confiscating them.’
‘Wand,’ grunted the security wizard.
‘And you’re making me go in alone?’
before bidding the rest of them goodnight and climbing the stairs to the girls’ dormitory.
Hermione rolled her eyes. ‘They should have the right to fair pay and time off, same as the rest of us-’
John didn’t touch his, he just rested his head on his arm with Sherlock sitting next to him squeezing his hand.
‘Who cares what they think? We all know it wasn’t him.’
‘Yes, yes, we know about Quidditch,’ Hermione said tensely. ‘Well, the other thing to decide is where we’re going to meet…’
‘We’re going to help the Ministry,’ Mr Weasley shouted over the noise, rolling up his own sleeves. ‘You lot, get into the woods and
Dumbledore stopped pacing and looked at Harry. ‘My apologies,’ he said, sitting back down at his desk.
‘No, he said he’d finished it all.’
‘But that’s exactly why you will be helpful,’ Sam said eagerly. ‘Most of what I can find is about fully realised Seers, and only from second-hand sources. Next to nothing is known about developing Seers, and I think it could be some of the most valuable information out there, especially for new Seers.’
It was Mr Crouch. He and the other Ministry wizards were closing in on them. Everyone but John and Sherlock got to their feet to meet them.
‘His sister?’
Ollivander stood and stared at him for a while, head tilted. ‘Perhaps… But no… but maybe…’ He disappeared and they heard him rummaging around right at the back of the shop. When he came back, his brow was furrowed and he was holding a dusty old box, with the fabric peeling at the corners. He picked up the wand inside and held it for a moment. ‘Silver lime,’ he muttered. ‘It’s been a very long time since I sold one of these.’
Dean grabbed him to stop him from falling, and looked to Cas for help.
Trelawney didn't appear to notice John's departure, and spent the rest of the lesson striding among them, muttering what sounded like threats under her breath.
veil of Death, isn’t that so cool?’
No one saw them at first and they entered just as Fleur said, ‘Why should ‘e complain? ‘E ‘as ze chance to compete! We ‘ave all been ‘oping to be chosen for weeks and weeks! Ze honour for our schools! A thousand Galleons prize money – zis is a chance many would die for!’
‘Tact isn’t really your strong suit, is it?’ said Sherlock.
'But Dobby talks of you all the time, sir!'
‘It’s me,’ Sherlock said, grabbing him by the shoulders.
'Of course you can,' said Mrs Weasleys. She was completely white, but looked resolute. 'He knows what Fudge is. It's Arthur's fondness for Muggles that has held him back at the Ministry all these years. Fudge thinks he lacks proper wizarding pride.
Cas nodded, and kissed Dean’s hand. ‘See you tomorrow,’ he murmured.
‘It’s nothing,’ Cas said hastily, and indeed, one of his front teeth was missing.
‘Then let us not carry this on any further, and I assure you, we shall not make the holding of a full criminal trial for something so trivial as underage magic a regular occurance, am I quite clear?’
‘You’re eating again, I notice,’ said Ron, watching Hermione add liberal amounts of jam to his buttered toast.
Cas’s eyebrows shot up in shock, then he shook his head. ‘
They continued walking, the buildings getting smaller and less imposing the further out they went. They passed a library, some pubs, and an overflowing skip, then Mr Weasley stopped them in front of a red telephone box.
The barman glared at him for a moment, then, throwing down his rag irritably as though he had been interrupted in something very important, he started passing up dusty Butterbeers from under the bar.
‘HA!’
‘And how do we do all this?’ Harry asked.
‘Not at all. Exactly what I would have done.’
‘Come again?’ said Ron.
‘We are honour-bound to give service to the present Headmaster of Hogwarts!’ cried a frail old wizard. ‘Shame on you, Phineas!’
It was too cold to make the potion outside, so they set up Cas’s cauldron in an empty classroom.
‘He doesn’t have to tell you that,’ Dean said angrily. ‘It’s private.’
They went up to the Gryffindor common room where Ron and Hermione had books and parchment spread out over the tables, and Hermione appeared to be writing a letter. There was no sign of John or Sherlock, but judging by the way Sherlock was looking at John during the meeting, Dean was sure they were spending some alone time together.
‘How come you’re not in Ravenclaw with brains like yours?’ Terry demanded.
‘What’s going on?’ Dean demanded, pushing through them and cupping Cas’s pale face.
‘Nah,’ he said. ‘Gabriel’s.’
Sherlock nodded.
They sat down at the Gryffindor table and were joined by their other friends.
Cas shook his head, but wrapped his arms around Dean’s neck, resting his head on Dean’s shoulder. ‘I don’t know what to do.’
Cas squinted at them. 'They are?’
‘See!’
‘Oh,’ said Hagrid, said Hagrid, with a most unhelpful glance towards the corner where Harry, Ron and Hermione stood hidden, ‘oh, tha’ was Fang. He broke a mug. So I had ter use this one instead.’
‘How are we getting there?’ Sherlock asked.
‘No, he’s not. The curses can be a lot for people to handle.’
'Yeah, you are,' said Sirius, 'and just as well, isn't it, if the first thing you're going to do on your weekend off is organise an illegal defence group.'
Once outside the hospital wing, Dean again leaned against the wall, reeling from everything he’d just heard. It hardly seemed real. He took a moment to catch his breath, then dragged himself up to Gryffindor Tower.
John finished his dinner, and got up to make himself a cup of tea, but Mrs Weasley pushed him back into his seat.
One of the Nifflers had suddenly leapt up and attempted to bite Pansy Parkinson’s watch off her wrist. She shrieked and jumped backwards.
‘Sorry,’ he said. ‘Meet me in the library at lunch.’
John threw on some clothes, only pausing for a moment when the Dark Mark spiked through his head again.
Harry shrugged. ‘Bagman said Hagrid would be lending them some creatures, and there would be spells in place.’
‘Want a jam tart, Hermione?’ Fred said, offering her one.
‘Yeah, it can be a bit scary.’
‘Wait here for me,’ Dumbledore said. ‘Our examination of the grounds will not take long.’
Molly’s eyebrows shot up. ‘
‘So what happened to your face, then?’ demanded Malfoy.
'Did you find out anything?' Sherlock asked in interest.
‘Lots of homework?’ said Hermione brightly, catching up with them. ‘Professor Vector didn’t give us any at all.’
‘Very well, very well,’ Snape snapped. ‘Leave your things here, I want you both back down here to test your antidotes.’
‘Liar. However, I do not deny that her information as invaluable. Without it, I could never have formed our plan, and for that, you will have your reward. I will allow you to perform and essential task for me, one that many of my followers would give their right hands to perform…’
Harry looked sceptical at this.
Cas reacted first.
There was a general murmur of agreement.
‘It’s okay, Hermione,’ said Harry. He looked Zacharias in the face. ‘What makes me say You-Know-Who’s back? I saw him. But Dumbledore told the whole school what happened last year, and if you didn’t believe him, you won’t believe me, and I’m not wasting an afternoon trying to convince anyone.’
John tugged on the neck of his jumper, feeling very closed in.
Smith did not move, nor did anyone else.
‘You’re at The Burrow with the Weasleys,’ Sherlock murmured, handing him some water. ‘It’s August, nineteen ninety-four.’
'No…' John groaned again, his breathing becoming heavier.
Dean opened his eyes enough to see Harry slide off his chair onto the floor and stare at the fire.
‘You’ll get used to it,’ Sherlock said bracingly, his hands lingering for a touch longer than was necessary.
Snape examined Goyle, whose face now resembled some sort of poisonous fungus.
John shook his head, whispered, ‘Screw it,’ and pressed his lips to Sherlock’s.
‘Oh, I’m sorry.’
‘I still don’t quite understand that part.’
‘But you’re behind – very behind – on dealing with Dark curses. So I’m here to bring you up to scratch on what wizards can do to each other. I’ve got one year to teach you how to deal with Dark-‘
‘We’re not
‘John!’ Sam grinned. ‘How are you doing? I wondered if-’
John faltered, lowering his hand slightly. ‘What?’
has to make the first move,' Hermione pleaded with him.
‘Running from what?’ said Sherlock, coming over.
‘Oh yeah, and my sister put Sherlock in the Full-Body Bind. Good times.’
‘Oh no,’ said Hermione. ‘It’s always packed and really noisy. I’ve told the others to meet us at the Hog’s Head, that other pub, you know the one, it’s not on the main road. I think it’s a bit… you know…
‘That’s good, right?’
‘I expect you’ll both be glad when this is all over?’ said Mr Weasley.
Harry's potion had been congealing in his cauldron and Dean wrinkled his nose as it began to issue foul black smoke that smelled like burnt rubber. Snape swept over and peered down his nose at it.
I expect, cauldron leaks.’
‘Nothing, nothing,’ said Mr Weasley airily.
‘Ooh, he used the ‘L’ word,’ Dean said in a stage whisper.
With great difficulty, owing to their bulky backpacks, they crowded around the old boot in the semi-darkness, waiting…
‘Of course we are,’ he smiled.
‘I’m worried they won’t want me on the Ravenclaw team anymore, if I miss too many practice sessions this week,’ Cas confessed to him at lunch.
Dean followed him upstairs, waiting for him to change behind the privacy of the curtains.
‘We’ll bet thirty-seven Galleons, fifteen Sickles, three Knuts,’ said Fred, ‘that Ireland wins, but Viktor Krum gets the Snitch. Oh, and we’ll throw in a fake wand.’
‘Well, I certainly don’t,’ Percy said sanctimoniously. ‘I
Cas looked him up and down and said, ‘Taller.’
‘At least come to Hagrid’s,’ Sherlock suggested. ‘You need to warm up. It’s too cold out here.’
'Did Mycroft know about this?' John asked Sherlock, aghast.
‘They’re a bit young to be gambling,’ said Mr Weasley. ‘Molly wouldn’t like-‘
'She's been a WHAT?' Harry said loudly.
‘Let’s assume that you’ll be able to walk by morning, there’s still no way you can carry your bag, so I’ll come with you and help you with your books.’
‘Thanks for having us, Mrs Weasley,’ Dean said as they climbed on board, closed the door and leant out of the window to talk to her.
‘I’ll go with you,’ John said, standing up with him.
The final bars of the song played out, and the gathering applauded them. They began a faster, more upbeat song, and Dean was eager to join in, but a familiar face at the door to the Great Hall caught his eye. 'I'll be right back,’ he said in Katie's ear, and dashed over to the doors. As he thought, Castiel was outside, sneaking back towards the marble staircase.
‘Alfie, come back here!’ another voice called. A red-haired girl of around fifteen ran over to them. ‘I’m so sorry, he gets really clingy sometimes-‘ She cut herself off and looked at them for a moment. ‘Castiel, is that you?’
'But if he was supposed to be back by now…' said Hermione in a small, anxious voice.
John found himself between Sherlock and Mrs Weasley in the back seat of the car, and looped his arm through Sherlock’s, uncomfortable with so many people so close to him.
‘Father,’ said the boy with straw-coloured hair. ‘Father...please…’
A blank silence greeted Hermione’s words.
‘What? We gotta eat sometime.’
John took one look at him and swayed violently.
It took a few more minutes for Cas to feel slightly better, but they had no more time to wait once everyone else started leaving the house.
‘I need to find a place where thirty-four people can practise Defence Against the Dark Arts without being found out by a teacher. Especially Professor Umbridge.’
‘I’m worried about Cas,’ Dean confessed. ‘He was doing so well, what happened?’
Trelawney pulled her shawls about herself and surveyed the class.
John sighed.
‘Hang on,’ said Angelina, ‘we need to make sure this doesn’t clash with our Quidditch practice.’
‘That’ll be for MACUSA to deal with. Come on. Dinner.’
‘Yes he has,’ said Luna.
John shuddered. Though they had no effect on him within the memory, he recalled the sensation vividly.
'Not really,' Cas admitted. 'I wanted to practice though.'
‘Will you still be here when I get back?’
‘No one’s saying it was him,’ said Dean.
‘That’s the one,’ Dean grinned. ‘Let’s go.’
Sherlock nodded.
‘It doesn’t matter, just, please?’
John rubbed his eyes, trying to clear his head. ‘Yeah, am I doing something wrong? I tried to use my power tonight, and up until now I thought I was getting better at it, but then nothing happened. Nothing at all.’
There was an appreciative laugh and an outbreak of applause as Dumbledore sat down neatly and threw his long beard over his shoulder so as to keep it out of his plate.
Dean nodded. 'Then what are you?'
‘Unwell, or cursed?’ Then he moved on to Cas. ‘And you – you’re awfully quiet. Something to hide?’
‘What’s this?’ John asked, as Sherlock sat down and tucked them both under the blanket.
‘Cas, if you have to go, you have to go.’
John hurried into the kitchen, closing the door behind him, and hiding them both behind the kitchen counter. He pointed his wand at the door, intending to lock it, but he couldn’t remember the spell.
‘What the hell?’ Dean said to Gabriel. ‘He’s never told me to shut up before.’
‘Over there,’ said Hermione, pointing. ‘There was someone behind the trees… they shouted words – an incantation.’
‘What’s that?’ Cas asked, shifting painfully.
‘No, really, we
‘I’ll do that then,’ said Moody, staring at Malfoy with great dislike.
‘What is that?’ Umbridge asked, pointing at the broken shards of china on the floor that had been Hermione’s mug.
Cas smiled. ‘I think I can make that happen.’
‘Yeah, but there’s nothing we can do until he drops his Shield Charm, right, Cas?’
Welcome back everyone! Thanks to Pepipanda, hhhelcat and OtakuElf for the awesome comments. I had a really good time talking to you all last time. I hope you all enjoy this chapter and I'll be back again in two weeks!
John groaned quietly.
‘What did you do?’ John asked Ron.
‘See, he was always protecting you,’ Dean whispered as he carefully climbed into the bed beside Cas.
‘On excellent form, I thank you,’ said Dumbledore.
Sam grimaced. 'Kinda, yeah.'
Dean turned and saw Sam sprinting towards him. 'What happened?' Dean asked.
‘No, I just want to get to the library.’
'We weren't saying anything like that, mate!' said Ron, aghast. 'We weren't having a go at Diggory, we didn't - you've got the wrong end of the -' He looked helplessly at Hermione, whose face was stricken.
‘Not really,’ John replied.
There was a flash of fire and the phoenix was gone.
enter. Screw all those guys who’re in it for that stuff. Show people that the best way to get anywhere is by being a good guy and working hard.’
‘He’s smarter than he looks.’
‘Well yeah, obviously, but Harry took them seriously. He’s pretending to be asleep.’
‘I would love some,’ he rumbled, looking at her intensely.
They just sat, staring at each other. Dean knew that if he moved or said something, Cas would bolt. He could see Cas’s legs twitching, so he held eye contact while he thought of something to do. Before he could though, there was a rustling of bushes ahead of them, and John and Sherlock burst into the alcove, kissing fiercely.
'See here, Dumbledore,' said Fudge, 'You-you can't seriously believe that. You-Know-Who - back? Come now, come now… certainly, Crouch may have
‘I could eat some toast, if you wouldn’t mind.’
Once outside, however, Cas pulled Dean aside, down another shadowy alley.
‘Fawkes!’ said Sirius at once, snatching up the parchment. ‘That’s not Dumbledore’s handwriting - it must be a message from your mother - here -’
John kept an eye on the others as they were coaxed into the ward by the Healer that was looking after Lockhart, while Sherlock slowly sipped his tea. He winced as they bumped into Neville and his grandmother, visiting Mr and Mrs Longbottom for Christmas, and Neville stared at his shoes while his grandmother explained what happened. Soon it became too difficult for John to watch, so he turned his attention back to Mr and Mrs Weasley. Mrs Weasley was still shouting, so John watched her until she began to calm down, long after he’d finished his cup of tea. Eventually, Bill, Fred and George wandered out of the tearoom, and John and Sherlock followed after them.
‘Talk to me, John,’ said Sherlock, stopping suddenly. ‘Tell me what’s wrong.’
'I'm not hungry.’
‘How’s domestic life treating you these days?’ she asked.
‘You haven’t seen that many Chasers,’ Sherlock grumbled and Cas frowned at him.
‘If you say so,’ Dean sniggered.
John looked up from the paper, horrified, face burning, and heart in his throat.
The walls on each side were panelled with shiny dark wood and had many gilded fireplaces set into them. Every few seconds a witch or wizard would emerge from one of the left-hand fireplaces, and on the right-hand side, short queues were forming, waiting to depart. John couldn’t help but be impressed, and he felt Sherlock’s amusement.
‘I’m all right,’ he said shakily, as much to Sherlock as Mr Weasley, and got to his feet, still holding the pressure point. ‘Let’s just go.’ He threw one more fearful look back at the statue, but it was gold again, so he forced himself to calm down.
‘No he hasn’t,’ Hermione snapped.
‘And on Wednesday, I think I’ll come off worse in a fight.’
John and Sherlock hastily broke apart and stood at either side of the alcove opening, avoiding each other’s eyes.
‘Looks like you’ve got one,’ Ron said, pointing up at a grey owl soaring towards them.
Dean shook his head. 'It's just that I - I thought we'd be safe here,' he mumbled. 'I thought Sam would be safe here…'
'Come on, man, I know you've got a favourite,' Dean smirked.
‘I don’t know, Dean,’ Gabriel snapped. ‘I have to go.’
‘Tripped over a tree root,’ he said angrily, getting to his feet.
No point in pretending… well… come on, Longbottom, I’ve got some books that might interest you.’
Sherlock cleared his throat. ‘It’s in your room, isn’t it? I’ll get it.’ He kissed John’s forehead, then raced up the stairs.
Some good news, I got a new computer and desk and everything so things are going a lot better now. For some context, my setup before was a broken laptop hooked up to my tv and a wireless keyboard, so writing was a bit difficult. Now that it's better I'm going to attempt to stick to a two week schedule, so look out for me every two Sundays!
‘Where have you been?’ Umbride said, cutting through Hagrid’s babbling.
‘You will notice,’ said Snape, ‘that we have a guest with us today.’ He gestured towards the dim corner of the dungeon, and they saw Umbridge sitting there with her clipboard on her knee.
Professor Trelawney herself was in a foul mood. She slammed a copy of
‘You’re a good friend, Cas,’ John mumbled.
Most of the front page was dedicated to a picture of Harry. John began to read the article underneath, but Dean said, 'No, not that,' and turned the paper to another page headed:
‘But what if he learns?’
‘Bagman wanted to tell us what’s happening at Hogwarts,’ Ron said grumpily. ‘At the World Cup, remember? But my own mother won’t say… John, you don’t think you could...?’
‘You’ve got to be joking,’ Sherlock said, looking up. ‘You can’t possibly think we had anything to do with this?’
His mother then jumped out from behind the counter and slammed a heavy saucepan on the Death Eater’s head, knocking him to the floor.
John shrugged. ‘He once worked out how to find someone’s bed based on the architecture and the amount of litter on the floor, without even speaking to the person. I’m sure he’d have no problem finding mine.’
'Why not?' Cas said, not changing trajectory at all. 'John and Sherlock go in all the time.'
Cas nodded, holding back tears.
Cas shivered, straining to contain his magic. 'I'm supposed to come here when it's too much, to let it out safely. But it's just getting stronger.'
Professor Umbridge was not inspecting their lesson, nor was she in Snape's dungeon when they arrived for double Potions. Dean's moonstone essay was handed back to him with a large, spiky 'A' written in the corner. Dean was pleasantly surprised, but he knew he'd scraped the pass only by what Cas had written in it.
‘You are John Hamish Watson, of number twenty-two, Kings Road, Chelmsford, Essex?’ Fudge said, glaring at him over the top of his parchment.
The wizard in baggy trousers accompanied them towards the gate to the campsite. He looked exhausted with deep, purple shadows under his eyes. Once out of earshot of Mr Roberts, he muttered to Mr Weasley, ‘Been having a lot of trouble with him. Needs a Memory Charm ten times a day to keep him happy. And Ludo Bagman’s not helping. Trotting around talking about Bludgers and Quaffles at the top of his voice, not a worry about anti-Muggle security. Blimey, I’ll be glad when this is all over. See you later, Arthur.’ He Disapparated.
They sat together for a while longer, while Hagrid awarded Ron his prize, which turned out to be a large slab of Honeydukes chocolate.
John exclaimed angrily, but wordlessly, and he stormed out, followed by Sherlock howling with laughter.
Cas let go of Dean’s hand and covered his face, taking several deep breaths. When he spoke, it was barely audible. ‘My father.’ As soon as the words came out he clamped his hands over his mouth and whimpered, clearly terrified.
your type?’ said John.
‘As if that would stop you. Does he have a telephone, or should we send a letter?’
‘Yes, well, the idea was quite popular,’ Hermione said happily. ‘Ron, will you pull up some chairs?’
John smiled. ‘That’s not what I was going to say. Actually, I was going to ask if you’d like to go to the Ball with me?’
‘Oh, yes,’ said Umbridge, looking back at him with her hand on the door handle. ‘The Ministry is determined to weed out unsatisfactory teachers, Hagrid. Goodnight.’
The door clicked open, and the Death Eater crept slowly inside.
Dean watched him go, troubled.
Everything was blurry, and John couldn’t focus, but the area seemed familiar. Shadows and shapes flickered around them, and he realised that they were people running. Running away from flashes of light, it seemed. Spells perhaps.
‘Your eyes turned white,’ Sherlock muttered.
Dean nudged Cas gently, drawing a smile out of him.
being enslaved!’
‘I told you, I’m not hungry,’ Cas said with an irritated expression. ‘Please stop worrying.’
‘Where am I?’
It wasn’t until Sam and Ginny fell asleep right at the table that Mr Weasley realised what time it was, and insisted that they all go to bed. Everyone but John and Sherlock left for their own tents, leaving it quiet but for the singing and celebrating from around the campsite.
'I don't,' Dean reassured. 'I do think it's really freaking cool, but you're still the same old Cas. It doesn't bother me.'
‘An ugly old bat in outsize specs?’ Ron muttered under his breath.
‘So tell us what happened,’ said Dean.
John shrugged. 'Dunno. Felt true when I said it.'
So when Sherlock Summoned John’s textbook across the room, John wasn’t impressed.
‘Uh, I’m not so great with the pounds,’ said Dean. ‘Dollars are more my speed.’
‘If you do, You-Know-Who wants them.’
John hesitated. The flower seemed a bit much.
‘Yeah, your dad, not your brother.’
‘Dean, what is it?’ Cas asked in alarm.
‘Uh, are you sure you want to?’
‘Yes,’ Snape said quietly.
Dumbledore disappeared, and the room went silent.
'With a sword,' said Sherlock. 'I was there, I saw him do it.'
‘Or why you’re back so late,’ Harry added. ‘Sirius told us Madame Maxime came back weeks ago-’
‘Enjoying it?’ said Ron. ‘I don’t reckon he’d come home if Dad didn’t make him. He’s obsessed. Just don’t get him started on his boss.
Harry then blew a whistle and everyone lowered their wands.
‘Well, I on’y just got back,’ said Hagrid, waving an enormous hand at his bag. ‘Maybe someone else came ter call earlier an’ I missed ‘em.’
'Detention, Mr Watson. You will come to my office after class today.'
not to use the information I extracted from her.’
Cas nodded fervently.
‘Excuse me?’ said Cas, folding his arms.
John sunk down onto a seat at the table, not paying much attention, as he had heard all this already. He noticed that Harry was now describing it as though he had been watching from the sidelines, rather than through Nagini’s eyes.
Dean turned away, and Cas let his face betray his relief.
He felt as though he was walking in slow motion, his hands began to shake, and he could feel himself sweating. By the time he reached Sherlock, he could hardly speak through the dryness in his throat. ‘Sherlock,’ he said, voice cracking.
‘But it doesn’t have a newspaper,’ Hermione frowned.
Gabriel came in, went straight over to Castiel and pulled him into a hug. ‘You just love making me worry, don’t you? Are you okay?’ He pulled away and looked him over.
Cas nodded, his eyes already closed.
‘You can’t tell?’ said John, his head spinning quite severely.
‘Good morning, Dean,’ Cas said quietly, lightly brushing his hand against Dean’s. ‘Will you go to breakfast with me?’
‘You’re the one with the visions.’
'Nah,' said Dean, throwing himself down in front of the fire. 'He had some super important organising to do in the hospital wing.'
Turn around and face me like a man, why don’t you?’
‘Whoa,’ he said, sitting up. ‘That was real good, Cas. Wow. Can’t wait to see what you’ll do with a Stunner.’
‘Er – but maybe this is not the time… no… where was I? Ah yes, the Triwizard Tournament… well, some of you will not know what this Tournament involves, so I hope that those who
Both nodded and moved sideways out of their frames, but instead of emerging in neighbouring pictures, neither reappeared. One frame now contained nothing but a backdrop of dark curtain, the other a handsome leather chair.
Dean paced around their room while Sam packed up both of their trunks.
Harry nodded. ‘Professor - I was in Divination just now and - er - I fell asleep.’
They unpacked all their books at the table by the window, away from everyone else, and quietly got to work.
‘They’re after
They filed down the front steps and lined up in front of the castle. It was a cold, clear evening; dusk was falling and a pale, transparent-looking moon was already shining over the Forest. John felt himself being drawn towards the trees, as did Sherlock.
‘I saw you change your nose just now.’
Hermione didn’t turn up for Herbology, and John relied on Molly heavily as his energy waned. It was all he could do to walk down to Hagrid’s hut, and sit down in front of it with a thump.
‘I’ll do my homework if you go to the Ball,’ Dean had said.
A huddle of teenagers in their pyjamas were arguing a little way along the path. When they saw Hermione and the boys, a girl with thick, curly hair turned and said quickly, ‘O
‘I’m not sure there’s much I could tell you. She does what she pleases, really.’
Karkaroff spat onto the ground at Dumbledore’s feet.
John dusted himself off. ‘Okay, where to first?’
‘Okay, stop, you’re not pruning it, you’re giving it a close shave,’ Molly said, holding up a hand to stop John from angrily chopping at the quivering bush.
'Quite a period,' said Umbridge, making a note on her clipboard. 'So it was Professor Dumbledore who appointed you?'
‘Sherlock, I’m going to be having these visions for the rest of my life. You have to sleep sometime, now go to bed.’
‘I’m mentioned,’ said Mr Weasley as he reached the bottom of the article.
John tutted. ‘I’m fine,’ he insisted.
‘I don’t need to,’ Sherlock said softly. ‘I’ll be right here while you rest.’
The next day’s Care of Magical Creatures lesson found them being led into the Forest by Hagrid, who was carrying what looked like half a dead cow.
‘I’ve been saving my pocket money all summer for this,’ said Ron as one of the salesmen approached them. Ron bought himself a dancing shamrock hat and a large green rosette, but he also bought a small figure of Viktor Krum, the Bulgarian Seeker. The miniature walked backwards and forwards over Ron’s hand.
‘Yeah, I bet it was,’ said Ron. ‘We met Draco Malfoy in the woods and he didn’t look worried at all, and we all know the Malfoys were right in with You-Know-Who.’
‘Cas!’ said Dean. ‘Are you okay?’
‘Here!’ They turned around and saw Harry hurrying towards them, accompanied by Professor Dumbledore.
Hermione and Ron looked up from their homework and John’s scream.
‘What happened?’ Dean said in alarm.
Gabriel sat down on the bed. 'It's my fault. I convinced him to enter.'
‘It’s just an expression,’ Ron said hastily.
‘She didn’t run amok! She just picked it up off the ground!’
‘Sherlock, what-?’
‘This is Cas,’ said Dean. ‘A friend of mine from school. Cas, this is Jo Harvelle.’
Hermione nodded, and she, Harry and Ron gave it a try.
Dean elbowed him.
‘Oh yeah,’ said Dean. ‘Worth it to give Malfoy a beat down if you ask me.’ He looked around and noticed a lot of Ravenclaws looking excited and triumphant. ‘What are they so happy about?’
Sherlock bristled, but Dumbledore spoke up before he could say anything.
‘I see two possibilities, Alastor,’ said Fudge. ‘Either Crouch has finally cracked - more than likely, I’m sure you’ll agree, given his personal history - lost his mind and gone off wandering somewhere-’
Cas nodded his head towards the Whomping Willow and they both slowly climbed through the tunnel for the second time that day. Cas finally lay on his bed, exhausted, and Dean hunted around for somewhere else to sleep, finding another bed that he assumed was Gabriel's. It took a while for him to fall asleep, his mind buzzing with ideas.
‘That is true,’ said Voldemort, sounding amused. ‘A stroke of brilliance I would not have thought possible of you, Wormtail – though, if truth be told, you were not aware how useful she would be when you caught her, were you?’
John sipped it gratefully, still shivering slightly.
‘What? Oh… oh, yeah, we did. Yeah, on the third night after the last Gurg was killed we crept outta the cave we’d bin hidin’ in an’ headed back down inter the gully, keepin’ our eyes peeled fer the Death Eaters. Got inside a few o’ the caves, no go - then, in about the sixth one, we found three giants hidin’.’
He pulled out the empty jar and placed it on a table in front of him. After casting an Unbreakable Charm, he threw every spell he could think of on it, until he was satisfied that it really wouldn’t break. He carried it around with him the rest of the day, hoping to give it to Cas at dinner, but Cas didn’t appear. Dean badly wanted to go and find him, but he knew that Cas must be feeling really bad if he went as far as to ask for a break from studying, so he reluctantly climbed up to Gryffindor Tower instead. It was quieter than usual, since the Gryffindor Quidditch team were down at practice. Dean laid out his homework on a table near the window, but found himself struggling. He bit his lip and looked around the room for inspiration. His gaze landed on Hermione.
