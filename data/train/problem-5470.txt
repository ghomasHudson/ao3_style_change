“Please, Alpha,” Dean repeats. “Fuck me, Alpha. Wanna feel you. C’mon, baby, please.”
“He made me a Grindr profile,” Castiel interpreted. Hannah huffed indignantly, but Charlie burst out laughing.
The door opens and Dean comes back in with a bucket full of water. Castiel steps away from the wall to help him.
“Sorta,” is all Dean volunteers.
Dean tried to concentrate on the firm hold around him rather than the laughing, pompous face of the alpha in front of him, but blood was rushing through his ears and he was pretty sure he was going to snap again. He managed to let himself get carried away from the jail, though, and back to Cas’s ugly car. He even climbed into the back seat under his own steam. To his dismay, though, Cas climbed into the back seat with him instead of the front as Hannah got behind the wheel.
“Dean does good work,” Mr. Harris said, reaching out to sign off on the paperwork for the repairs.
“There are dangerous things in the Bunker, too, but we don’t protect them by threatening to destroy them.”
He knits his brows in confusion. “Who are you?” he asks, but before he can even finish the question, she’s gone.
“We should sleep.”
“So,” Cas says when they break apart. “Might I ask if I might stay the night? If that is amenable?”
Sam grimaces. “Sammy,” he finishes. Castiel smiles at him in solidarity.
obvious, if you’re worried.”
With that, Castiel had agreed to meet a stranger for no reason that was clear to him at the moment. He hoped he wasn’t getting himself into any more trouble. He had to finish his project, and he doubted Naomi would let him finish it from prison.
“I’m sorry, too,” he says quietly, cautiously. “I know you’ll miss her. So will I.”
, Charlie.”
“Do you want to hear this or not?”
“Fuck,” Dean hissed, flipping his laptop closed and storming into the bathroom.
Somewhere around the fourth round of the other guys trying to shoot each other with more and more creative weaponry, Gabriel convinces Castiel to drink a beer. It’s hardly his first one, but it still feels strange to sit in an unfamiliar apartment and impair his judgement.
“Dammit,” Castiel swore, moving to follow.
“We should take this to my bedroom,” Dean says. “Don’t want Sammy or, fuck,
“I love you, angel.”
Castiel tried to relax as Dean circled his hole with one slick finger, teasing the nerve endings as Castiel moaned and pressed his ass up in the air and his face into the mattress. Dean dipped the tip of his finger into his entrance and swore again.
After that, Dean was more comfortable with her appraisal as he went through several pairs of pants and a couple of shirts. They selected a few things, and made their way to the counter to check out. Dean handed across the account number from the envelope, and the cashier barely concealed a look of shock when she saw the numbers.
“No—” Dean gulps out, his eyes flying open as he grasps at Cas’s hand. Cas freezes, blue gaze locked on Dean’s. The firelight dances in them, far too close to be polite. Dean’s heart races, eyes darting down to Cas’s lips, which are
Dean jumped at the curse and the sound of the outer door slamming. He immediately abandoned his homework and went to check on Kevin.
Dean has to concentrate for a moment before finding the general vicinity of where hunger pangs might be. But no, his entire midsection is one big ball of pain right now.
Dean starts spending more of his time researching how to heal an angel. It’s been nearly a month, and Cas’s condition hasn’t changed. Dean’s sense of smell hasn’t returned, either, but Sam’s decided that he’s on it, so Dean lets him do whatever makes him happy.
“Dean, no—”
“Dean,” Cas breathed. “Dean, would you dance with me?”
Castiel went back to his bungalow feeling strange. He stopped by a pharmacy and bought a number of scent-blocking products, including body wash, deodorant, and a body spray that all guaranteed to cover his scent completely. He lingered for a moment in the aisle, looking over all of the products marketed to alphas, many of which touted an enhancement of their natural scent, or guaranteed a complete block of their scent to keep others from noticing any changes in emotion or any weaknesses.
“Enough!” Bobby snaps. He waves his hand at two chairs in front of his desk, forcing them into the back of Dean and Castiel’s knees so that they sit. “You gonna listen to what I got to say, or are you gonna keep bitchin’ at each other?”
“Sorry, Cas,” Dean says, settling on the arm of the couch next to his brother. “You can play winner?”
“Picky is not prudish,” Hannah added.
“Is he having a heart attack?”
“Dude, maybe he wants to go public.”
Warnings (sorta spoilery, so be warned for that, too): the not-so-nice tags are coming into play with Michael. Nothing sexual happens, but Dean is made to feel very uncomfortable and there is some definitely uninvited touching (of a non-sexually explicit nature -- see end notes for more details) and a major power imbalance here. Dean does not consent to these things. This is where attempted assault/nonconsensual intimacy come into play. There is no sex or sexual contact between Dean and Michael (nor will there be), but things are not okay and it is at the very least harassment.
The city of Lebanon is still sleeping outside of the Bunker as Castiel walks the dark streets, following the fastest route to the closest city gate. He hopes that Dean was taking the most convenient route; if not, he’ll have to expend some energy on a tracking spell, which he doesn’t want to do until he’s left the city walls unless he absolutely has to.
Dean tried not to panic as Adler left the room. The problem was, taking any deep breaths meant breathing in Adler’s stench, and Dean didn’t think he was strong enough for that. He focused on calming his heart rate.
Dean stopped, doubled over in pain, hand on his stomach, an involuntary groan pulled from him. Cas’s hand was suddenly on his back, searing, icy cool against the flaming heat of his skin . . .
“No you don’t.”
Suddenly Dean was drenched as the skies opened up into a frigid, pouring rain. He gasped in shock, but Cas grabbed his hand and said, “Come on!”
“Cas doesn’t need to be here.”
“No, it—it wasn’t—nevermind.”
“No, I’m sorry, I meant how long do they usually last? Have you been getting them regularly?”
“All the time, actually.” Dean smiled back, a small but genuine smile, and Cas felt a blush rising up his cheeks. “Would you like to join me on the bench? I know I staked my claim, but I would be willing to share with a visiting dignitary should he feel so inclined.”
“Let me take you.”
Castiel licked his lips, hope burgeoning in his chest. “Dean, will you . . . would you do me the great honor of . . . of bonding with me?”
that curled its way behind his ribs and lodged firmly in his chest.
“Got any bright ideas, Red?” Gabriel asked.
The house was nearly silent, except for the occasional creaks of the foundation settling. A voice wheedled at the back of his brain; he hadn’t actually seen or interacted with Dean since his heat hit. Had Dean been thinking about him? Was he doing all right? Perhaps he might need something, and Castiel could provide it . . .
Dean holds out his fist, and in the middle is a tiny, miniature plastic snow globe. Cas takes it gingerly from Dean’s hand and holds it up close to his face. Inside is a single evergreen tree, decorated with colorful bulbs, and when he shakes it a cloud of glitter kicks up, sparkling as it drifts back down.
Castiel chewed his lip. “My work is important,” he said.
“Wait, that sounds like you’ll do it?” asked Charlie. Castiel inclined his head.
Gabriel parted ways with them, the singed back panel of his coat disappearing amongst the throng, likely on his way to the refreshment table. Hannah sighed as he left. Castiel patted her gloved hand reassuringly where it rested on his elbow.
“I agree.”
As he heals, it becomes clear that Michael actually left him in good physical condition. His eyes are back to normal first, losing their light sensitivity and pain (but maybe he checks out the selection of reading glasses the next time they’re at Wal-Mart, only because the Men of Letters’ writing is frickin’
“Not fair,” Dean grumbled. “Looks, brains, and Captain America’s metabolism.”
Dean swallowed hard enough for his throat to click. “He, uh, told me I’d get his bite and a ring someday, so . . .”
“C’mon, Cas. Let’s get cleaned up and something to eat,” he says, leading Castiel to put the bucket on the stove. Castiel takes his cue to drop the topic and lights the coals and heats the stovetop so it isn’t stone cold, but he doesn’t have the power reserves to do much more than that. Dean leads him over to a chair to rest while he gets their bath water and dinner ready.
“I’m fine, Kevin,” Dean snapped. Mercifully, Kevin dropped it.
“Look at me, Dean.”
“He’s in mechanical engineering. That shit’s hard! And he’s really only got one more class to graduate, he’s gonna do that in the summer—"
. According to the
“Man, do I love you,” he breathes. Castiel grasps onto him more tightly.
“Are you cold, beautiful?” Michael asked, the slightest slur around the edges of his words. Dean shook his head.
Kissing Dean then would have been easy as breathing, but Cas managed to stay still. His heart ached as a single tear escaped the omega’s beautiful eyes before he wiped at it furiously.
- Dean goes into heat
!” Dean cried out, and suddenly the air was awash with the smell of omega come, sharp and acidic. Their scents mixed together in the air, and suddenly Castiel wanted nothing more than to curl up in their nest, surrounded by their mutual scents. He wished that they could.
Charlie nodded, regarding him shrewdly. “You’re doing good work, you know,” she said. Castiel lifted the corner of his lips in a small smile.
Dean considers that only briefly. Gabriel, since that’s definitely who this is, is nothing like a typical beta, or a typical rich asshole. Dean didn’t used to be anything like a typical omega, either, but for all appearances now, he is. He rubbed the wrist that usually held the Cartier watch, which he very purposefully didn’t wear today.
The low burning in his arm that he’d been tuning out all day flares suddenly, blindingly hot, and Dean can’t resist slapping his hand over it, pushing hard against the pain. Tears sting his eyes as he breathes through it, trying to focus on letting it ease, but if anything it gets even hotter. He bites back a soft whimper, eyes clamped shut, which is why he jumps when a gentle hand touches his shoulder.
The muffled groan emanated from deep under the covers, where just the top of Castiel’s mop of unruly hair peeked up above the comforter.
Castiel rolled his eyes, crossing his arms and squinting at the screen.
and a fool. Years later and you’re still fighting John’s battles—”
After a tense few minutes, the carriage was brought around. Castiel moved to help Hannah but Gabriel and Samuel stepped in, carefully guiding her down the steps and out into the snow.
“Much as I hate to break up this moment,” Bobby grunts, “we got some stuff to do before you go, and you should probably rest and leave early.”
“He chose to die?”
“I know the incantations, Bobby, they’ve been crammed in my head since I was a kid!”
way. He grips Cas’s biceps, fingers digging into hard muscle, the thought of those arms pressing him down into a mattress flooding his thoughts, and then a trickle of slick eases from him. Cas groans and pulls away.
Dean smelled like . . . like . . .
He closed the front door behind him with a heavy
. Finish your project, graduate, fine. But then
“Fuck fate,” Castiel spits. Dean laughs.
“Okay.”
Dad hadn’t wanted them to hunt. He’d wanted them to have a wife, and kids, and a white picket fence.
“Dean Winchester,” he said.
clearly remember. Besides, why would your friends want to hang out with a high school senior?”
Dean kicked at the ground and a tense silence fell for a moment. “Kevin won’t shut up about it,” Dean said at last. Castiel smiled.
Speaking of, the smell of something absolutely
“It’s an
“No, no, please, lecture me a little more,” he said with a grin that softened his words. “It’s a far better occupation than dancing. And it’s Dean, by the way. Mr. Winchester was my father.”
Castiel lay in his bed that night turning the note over and over in his mind. The clock beside his bed read two in the morning; his headaches and the constant need to vomit kept him awake most of the night. Perhaps Hannah was right and he should postpone his next dose. The doctor wouldn’t notice if he put it off until next week, right? It wasn’t as though he was going to skip it altogether; he would just give it a few days to see if his symptoms would level off.
“Dean?”
Dean strokes in time with Castiel’s languid thrusts, bringing them closer to the edge together. By the time his orgasm rushes toward him, Castiel no longer has much control over his magic, and it’s tethering them together so once one falls over the edge, the other follows quickly after, sending them spiraling with pleasure until they finally collapse in each other’s arms, completely spent.
“Kinda sick of sitting around on my ass, y’know? Medical leave is great and all, but woke up this morning just kinda . . . itching to do something.”
Cas could hardly breathe, but Dean was warm beside him, their release cooling on Cas’s belly. He reached a hand over to smooth through Dean’s hair.
Cas growls at that, pushing Dean back onto the bed and yanking Dean’s jeans the rest of the way off. Dean sets about getting his boxers and socks off as Cas divests himself of the rest of his suit. Finally, he’s naked, and Dean can’t help but stare.
“Dean, wait!”
“Sam said it’s because you’re scent bonded. Cinnamon and cypress. Vanilla and evergreen. I thought . . . I thought you knew?”
Dean blows a sharp breath through his lips, considering his options. He can leave Cas behind easily enough; he knows the terrain and he’s better travelled. Besides that, he’s been preparing for something like this since he set out on his own, and despite Cas’s superior magic ability, Dean is far better equipped for the task.
“For me, it was the complete opposite,” Castiel confessed. “My family had money, we were always traveling, dining in fancy restaurants. I attended private schools and it wasn’t until I went to college that I realized that it wasn’t personal fault that led to poverty and hunger. When I found out about the ways the system created and maintained inequities, well . . . let’s just say I wasn’t invested in commercial farming the way my family was.
“It’s okay, Dean. It just means that you might need a little help conceiving. Trust me, this could be a very simple fix.”
“There won’t be any grandchildren if you die, Dean.”
He blinks, vision clearing enough that he notices the fuzzy, flannel-wrapped figure slumped on the couch nearby. The figure unfolds, and it’s all long limbs and shaggy hair.
“Sam?”
Castiel sighed tightly though his nose. “Charlie, the entire point of my project is for omegas to tell their own stories. If you or I stand up and read them, they immediately become something far different. It’s a basic tenet of ethnography that—”
“Dean . . .” he croaks, hoping to wake Dean before the situation becomes even more mortifying. Dean stops, stilling behind him.
“Hi, guys,” Kevin said. “This is Gilda. I have to go to a meeting with my advisor, but I figured you could interview her first then I’ll come back later when it’s done?”
“I’m not wearing cologne, Dean.”
Castiel scowled. “If you can envy a family too poor to support its eldest child and heir’s education, leaving the rest of the family with debts and an uncertain future, and a mother left to raise four children alone.” Winchester’s jaw fell open, and then it was Castiel’s turn to blush. “Forgive me, Mr. Winchester, propriety isn’t my strongest suit.”
Cas blinked owlishly. “Looks?”
Cas seethes. “That’s not true. I went to the park with Sam—”
it!” Gabriel exclaimed, grinning. “I knew you couldn’t set an eligible alpha like you loose in that henhouse without
“You’re so beautiful,” Cas says, reaching for the button on Dean’s jeans. Dean flushes pink from his chest up to his scalp.
It took them twenty minutes to figure out that the school had a car service they were expected to use if they ever ventured off campus. It actually turned out that Kevin had an inside connection with the beta security company that kept a close eye on the omegas at the school at all times and managed to get permission for the two of them to leave with a beta from the community. They just had to sign out at the gate with the time they expected to arrive back.
“And if you tell me ‘you gotta’ you’re

for Cas, he could’ve stayed out of it. Cas reaches out and takes the spell from Bobby to look it over. He squints at it. “Is this Enochian?”
“Tell him everything, don’t tell him anything, whatever, but you’re gonna need a Mage, Dean.” Bobby holds up the page he was working on translating over the last few hours. “You’ve gotta use this incantation, and it’s gonna take a Mage a helluva lot more powerful than me to get it to work.”
“I didn’t know there was ownership on benches in the quad,” he replied, though he gathered his notebook up. Dean noticed a stack of flyers next to him.
Dean had revealed early on in their friendship that he considered himself bisexual, which had been a boon to the “let’s-explore-what-turns-Cas-on” adventure they’d undertaken that semester. So, it was hardly a surprise when two striking young men came up on the screen. They were both athletically built, one with a slighter frame and sandy blond hair, the other taller and dark-haired. Some sort of inane story line was hashed out, and then they were kissing, deep and sensual. Dean had been right; even if all of the mechanics of it were the same, there was something more intimate and less . . . jarring about this one. It was still porn, but it was porn with
The evening news report played on the television in the background as Castiel attempted to put his notes in some sort of order. His literature review wasn’t helping to calm him at all, but he wanted to be busy to distract him. Adler had been right, at least according to the news. More local omegas were being sentenced to prison for unlawful possession of controlled substances. They were apparently set up by local law enforcement for trying to obtain suppressants. According to the reporter, all three were house-omegas with multiple children at home.
“I don’t know what to think, I don’t know you at all,” Castiel quipped.
“The owner of the house you’re sitting in, buck-o. And Cassie’s big brother, so careful who you piss off.”
“No . . . no ill effects?” Cas asks, tracing a finger lightly over the sensitive skin on Dean’s arm. He shivers.
Dean scoffs and rolls his eyes, tossing his napkin down on the table. “You know what, never mind. I don’t think I want to eat anything here, anyway.” He stands, looking down at Castiel, and freezes. Castiel isn’t looking at him with disgust, or pity, or confusion. He’s not even ignoring Dean’s outburst. The look in Castiel’s eyes is such extreme disappointment that it nearly takes Dean’s breath away. Nick’s sputtering tears Dean out of the moment.
Dean hitches his bag higher up on his shoulder before looking Castiel up and down again. “Did you even bring anything?”
Their cheap apartment wasn’t very well-insulated; they’d tacked blankets over the drafty windows and stuffed towels into the cracks. As the wind howled and the snow piled up outside, Dean brought two steaming mugs of only slightly grainy hot chocolate to their tiny couch. He handed one to Cas, who took it gratefully, huddled under a thick comforter he’d stress-knitted during finals week last year. Dean slid in next to him, ignoring the excited shiver that ran through him as he pressed up against Cas’s side. Cas, seemingly unaware of the effect his proximity was having on Dean, snuggled up next to him and tossed the blanket over Dean’s lap.
“Sack full of little Michael Phelps-es, huh?” Dean joked. Dr. Banes pursed her lips, but Cas gave Dean’s weak joke a little eye roll and a fond smirk. Dr. Banes cleared her throat.
Subject: Date Proposal
“And I can’t let this take away from finishing my project,” Castiel finished.
“Yes,” Castiel panted. “Want you. To come for you.”
“Merry Christmas, Dean,” Cas breathed into the scant space between them.
“Apparently you’re allergic to nutmeg.”
Dean took the envelope, trying to get his brain to catch up. “Uh, yeah, I think . . . maybe. Um . . .”
Castiel shakes his head to clear it, willing the voices away. “I love him,” he grits out. The despair lifts a fraction, allowing him to press on.
“Then tell me,” Castiel says sadly. Dean narrows his eyes suspiciously and Castiel sighs. “Tell me, and perhaps I can help you.”
It feels inevitable, in the end, as Dean drifts forward, for Castiel’s eyes to drift closed as Dean brushes their lips together. Castiel shivers at the contact, reaching out to run a hand through Dean’s hair, pulling him back in for a firmer kiss as Dean whispers, “Cas . . .”
“I wish I could coat my hand in your slick to . . . to . . .”
“You’ll get used to it. This is important, Cas.”
“C’mon, alpha, can’t leave me like that,” Dean said, wrapping his arms around Cas’s waist and grabbing handfuls of his ass. Cas growled, tangling his fingers in Dean’s hair and pulling his head back to run his nose along the line of Dean’s throat. Dean shivered again, baring his throat to his alpha. Cas pressed gentle kisses on Dean’s mating mark, then left a hot trail up to his ear and along the underside of his jaw. He started to go a bit weak in the knees at the attention Cas lavished on his scent gland until he realized . . . Cas was scenting him. Subtly, sure, but he was searching.
“It’s fine,” he said, managing to stop himself before he blurted out
Dean was taking a difficult seminar over the break, so he ended up staying up much too late working on papers. Sometimes Cas would wake up and Dean would be slumped over his desk, asleep with the lamp on. He smiled at the endearing sight of his best friend drooling next to his laptop, and sometimes he would gently wake Dean up to get him to move to the bed.
“Strange,” Castiel breathes, stopping to peer closer at the one on the end. It’s the simplest of all of them, a crystal-clear blown glass bell jar encasing a long cylinder with a thin, red rod in the center. Except now, the cylinder is full of swirling red smoke, the rod snapped in half and leaning against the cylinder’s wall. It’s all enclosed, so Castiel isn’t worried about the smoke escaping, but he can’t begin to fathom how it broke.
“So, you think that Novak turned them in?”
alpha
Sam. He needed to talk to Sam.
“Drive through to the administration building, please.”
“The invitation was clearly intended for all of the elder Shurley siblings. It wouldn’t do to have only two of them arrive.”
“I dunno, you don’t really talk much.”

As Dean was drying off, he realized that it wasn’t just water soaking his skin. The shower had helped equalize his body temperature, but he was starting to sweat, and a slow trickle of slick was leaking from his increasingly sensitive hole.
“I’m sure he’s fine. We haven’t even been gone a week yet. Besides, his glamors are pretty much famous. He spent a lot of time pretending to be me to get out of chores as a kid.”
Cas narrowed his eyes at her. “What do you mean by that?”
He hit send before he could overthink it.
Cas smiled weakly at the lovely new omega. “It’s nice to meet you, Gilda. Hannah can help you with paperwork, then we can get started.”
“Are you living here?” Castiel asked.
Dean sat across the table from him and somehow managed to avoid looking at him once. Castiel tried not to steal glances, but found his eyes flickering over to him more than he liked. Dean was gregarious, smiling and laughing and making conversation with everyone at the table except him.
Dean turned his head to meet his eyes. “Early day tomorrow,” he repeated, as though that were any kind of excuse. Castiel stared at him for a moment, trying to decipher whatever was going on behind those stunningly green eyes.
“You’re very good with them.”
Dean nodded, but didn’t speak. Crowley steepled his hands and gazed at him, leaning back in his chair. “So, then, please explain to me why you were unchaperoned in the company of an unmated alpha?”
Dean didn’t heed him; he dashed past Hannah out into the downpour.
Under normal circumstances, Cas would be a terrible traveling companion; he’s a silent, heavy presence by Dean’s side. But given the situation, and their destination, Dean manages to find comfort in the fact that he has the most powerful mage in the kingdom by his side.
to me in any way.”
Garth was waiting for them as they opened the lab, grinning as he led a pretty female omega into the office space. She was small, with golden-brown ringlets and a wide, shy smile. After a moment, Kevin came trotting in behind her.
Cas panicked as Dean’s eyes grew huge and frantic, darting almost comically between Hannah and Cas. Cas could see his decision a split second before he acted on it, watching the omega’s instinct to run pull his muscles taut and Cas called out, “Dean, wait!”
It’s been months since he’s heard the sound.
She looked at something on one of the three computer screens in front of her, then nodded. “You may have a seat, Mr. Winchester. President Adler will be with you shortly.”
He hardly registered Cas’s hand on his face, but he definitely felt the soft press of Cas’s lips against his cheek, cutting him off. He closed his eyes and leaned into the touch automatically. Cas pulled back and rested his forehead on Dean’s temple.
“I’m fine!” Dean shoved a few more items into the bag, but then slumped forward. “Lisa dumped me.”
“Sonofabitch,” he mutters, voice rough and painful, too.
“Cas?”
“Dude, Charlie’s out!”
For some reason, he smells sandalwood everywhere he goes. Most strangers on the street wear blockers, like Dean does, like everyone does, but sometimes he’ll catch a whiff of it and nearly follow it. Stores seem to favor it in their air fresheners, and the hippie store just around the corner from his apartment reeks of it. One night he comes home with a vanilla air freshener, and his entire apartment smells like it before he finally realizes what’s going on and unplugs the stupid thing from the wall.
It was wet, and hot, and Dean could feel the slick beginning to trickle from his hole as he pressed impossibly closer to Cas. He felt safe, and warm, the alpha’s arms tight across the small of his back, hand pressed firmly between his shoulder blades.
Dr. Banes was nodding, making more notes in his chart, like she’d been expecting that. “Okay, Dean,” she said seriously, looking up at him again. “First, you did the right thing coming to see me. Usually for couples in their early thirties with no pre-existing issues, like you and Cas, we recommend that you see a doctor after a year of unprotected heats without conception. Next, we’re going to run a few tests. Given your history of erratic heats and your height and build, I have a suspicion that we’re probably looking at o-PCOS, but I want to get some bloodwork and an ultrasound just to be sure.”
“Nah, he’ll eat meat just fine, he’s just always been more into the green stuff. I guess that’s why he got the magic and not me.”
“Yeah, but—”
“Yeah, yeah, sure. Anyone.”
“I don’t know,” he replied. “But it’s dangerous.”
“We’ll have to do that again so it counts.”
Kevin nodded, and chills ran down Dean’s spine. He knew the consequences for misrepresenting secondary gender all too well. Benny’s wife would be lucky to ever get to return to her family. Especially if she’d been working, not just “helping out” at the diner owned by her alpha.
“Dude, that was last week. C’mon, Sammy’s packing up the car, I’ll meet you in the garage.”
The other omegas near Dean cringed as Michael eyed their near-empty plates. Dean wished he could acknowledge them, reach out in solidarity, but rules of social conduct required he only speak when engaged directly by an alpha. His stomach turned, however, as he thought of Michael’s attitude toward omegas and food. Was he expected to restrict his food intake? Would Michael restrict it on his own? If he lived with Michael, would he be allowed to set his own meals? The knot in Dean’s stomach grew tighter, and he couldn’t force himself to take another bite.
Thank you all so much for reading! I hope that you enjoyed it!
“Fuck!”
With that, Gabriel hung up. The adrenaline pumping through his veins was starting to wear off as he made his way back to his car. It was parked in front of the diner, where several news cameras and a team of officers was combing the scene. He quietly jumped in his car and drove away.
The door slammed shut and Cas rushed into the living room where Hannah was standing, arms crossed and fire in her eyes. Despite that, Cas breathed a sigh of relief.
“Did he message you?” Charlie asked slyly.
Castiel peels himself out of his traveling boots, setting them next to the door. “That sounds wonderful,” he says. Dean stands watching him for another moment, hovering, before thinking better of whatever was going through his head and moving out of the door.
“Don’t start, Gabriel.” Gabe raised his hands innocently.
“What about Cas? We can’t just leave him here alone.”
In the end, he would endure, because this was necessary to complete his task. Dr. Milton had called twice since he’d notified her of their success at getting omegas to interview, and both times she had indicated that she was not satisfied with such a small response. Castiel assured her that he would get more, it would just take time.
Dean blushed, still looking at the floor. “I, uh, found my box of ornaments. The one from my—my mom’s house.” He blinked a few times, clutching tightly to Cas’s hand. “Found ‘em in the attic, and wanted . . . just wanted . . .”
“Bobby—”
“Get your own, Red,” Dean replied, kissing Castiel gently on the cheek. Castiel turned his head toward Dean, earning a soft kiss on the lips. Charlie pretended to gag.
“You’re just you,” he whispers, gathering his strength.
Dean’s attention snapped to the figure standing at the back of the room. Novak’s hands were in front of him in supplication, and it was only then that Dean realized he was growling. But this man, this
“At Vinehall, I’m home,” said a gorgeous brunette, flipping her hair over one shoulder.
“Are we able to have a fire?” Cas asks, his hands held over the pile of tinder he’s gathered. Dean shrugs.
“I . . . my name is Castiel Novak. I’m a researcher with—I’m currently conducting a project at Vinehall School, and—”
The brothers fall silent at Castiel’s sharp word. Castiel takes a deep breath. He isn’t sure what’s going on here, but he has a gut feeling that perhaps all of the strange occurrences tonight might be connected.
“It stands for ‘Omega Polycystic Ovary Syndrome.’ It’s actually quite common in male omegas, especially those with your physique. It’s also the most common cause of male omega infertility.”
“Cas, I’m sorry,” Dean whispers, voice thick with his own tears, and Castiel melts.
Dean brushes his arm absently, the dull burning pain reduced to what it had been this morning, shortly after they’d left Lebanon. It’s too much to hope that it will last long, but he should be able to get some sleep tonight, at least. He’s suddenly exhausted.
“You have to eat. Is it the suppressants?”
Red-haired Charlie Bradbury sat at the kitchen table, holding a mug of coffee and quirking an eyebrow at Cas.
“President Adler,” he said, inclining his head. He placed his hands behind his back and kept his head bowed, working to get his panic under control. If Adler scented it, or if, oh
Dean snarled and pushed past Hannah, ignoring the strong hands on him as he launched himself toward the police officer. Arms like steel wrapped around his chest, holding him back, and the officer started to laugh.
“Good morning, Omegas!”
“My name is Nick, and I will be your server this evening,” he says entirely to Castiel. “Could I interest either of you in a glass of wine this evening? Or perhaps one of our own house-label ales?”
“Not sure about that,” he muttered. “How is the, uh, research going?”
-right here, guys,” Dean stammered, clearing his throat.
It took a little over an hour for Gabriel and Castiel to pack up all of Castiel’s stuff. Well, it took Castiel over an hour, because Gabriel kept going through his things and teasing him or critiquing them. When they’d cleared the bedroom, he looked strangely disappointed.
“Proximity doesn’t matter, I can hear them from here.” Rowena shakes her head. “What?”
The gangly teen that showed up on his doorstep grew into an extremely handsome, noble man, and despite what Dean thinks of himself, Castiel knows that Dean is one of the best men in the kingdom. It doesn’t matter what his past holds, or whether or not he has magical talent; Castiel would trade any of his brothers for Dean’s company any day.
. The scent of apple pie and old books surrounded him, deepening and sweetening the longer they were together. The sharp notes of nutmeg and cloves became stronger, and finally underneath, something else. Intangible, undefinable.
“I told you already, I don’t ‘have’ him. He’s down there,” she says, gesturing at the smoke. “Go directly toward the center; that is where he’ll be. Find him if you can, but be warned, Castiel. I’m watching.”
Sarah tossed a pillow at him and rolled her eyes. Gilda giggled from her spot on the small sofa as Kevin stumbled out of his room.
They take off across country again. Stull Valley is a small, black mark on the map just north of Lawrence, which is at least a day’s journey from Fallstown. They travel in silence, cast in a small glamor from Cas to help them blend into their surroundings. Dean is still convinced they’re not being pursued, but it is better to not announce their comings and goings across the kingdom. Dean is well-known in these parts, and though Cas is reasonably certain most of the folk in the area have little cause to recognize him, it’s better safe than sorry at this point.
“Wanna watch a movie?” Dean asked.
So, aside from the overwhelming fear, he barely remembered his first (and up until now, only) heat.
“I’ll stay with you forever,” Castiel gasps.
vouched for you. You owe all of this to
“Yes, I would agree,” Cas says, running his hands up and over Dean’s chest, tweaking first his right nipple, then his left. Dean tugs his bottom lip into his mouth, but then Cas’s thumb is there, freeing it from between his teeth. Dean manages to get Cas’s thumb into his mouth, sucking at it, causing Cas to groan.
“Dean Winchester?” Crowley mocked. “Of course I am, idiot. Get in here and sit down.”
“I’m scared, Cas,” Dean breathed, swallowing hard.
“Dean,
“Dean, you’ve hardly touched your dinner,” Abaddon remarked, venom laced in her tone to match the blood red of her lips. Dean swallowed against the lump in his throat.
And if spending time alone at night with a bottle of wine and candlelight made something warm flutter in Dean’s stomach, he wasn’t going to be the one to complicate it,
was there next to him. Dean, who wore his heart on his sleeve, whose big green eyes lit up at the chance to help someone out, even if it was a bit embarrassing. Dean, whose friendship Cas valued above everything else, whose arms felt warm and reassuring and strong when they enveloped him in a hug. Dean, whose hands had ventured under the covers to touch his own cock when the sounds and the images of the porn before him became overwhelming.
“Oh, this? He’s just my little brother, Cassie. He insisted on coming along. Wouldn’t take no for an answer.”
happen, Dean, and . . . They will be monitoring you so closely, you have no idea. I am willing to bet that every move you’ve made since you came here has been watched and recorded. Oh, god, that’s probably how they knew about the kiss, anyway . . .”
He tried to remember everything he’d learned about the proper way to greet alphas of a higher social ranking than you.
Dean swallows around a lump in his throat, nodding. “Yeah, yeah, I know. Sam told me. I’m sure you did everything you could.”
Maybe . . . maybe there was something he could do to see exactly what it all meant.
“And it definitely isn’t a party without me,” Gabriel quipped, but he did become slightly better behaved after that.
The sounds from the porn helped. He thought about what Dean had sounded like the other night, breathy and quiet, moans practically forced from him as he stroked himself in secret. He could feel Dean’s eyes on him now, and that thought had him growing thick and hard in his hand. It was starting to feel even better as he filled out, blood rushing toward the point of contact as he teased himself up and down his shaft. He reached into the little drawer in his bedside table and pulled out a new bottle of lube he’d stashed for this occasion. He popped the lid open and drizzled some on his fingers. It was cold, so he warmed it up for a moment before reaching under his sheet and wrapping his slick hand around his cock.
“Read it.”
“We’re going to stay here tonight?” he asks. Dean nods, taking off his weapons and checking them before laying them all out on the table. “Oh. I suppose I can take the bedroll.” Dean looks up sharply at him.
“And you’ve arranged Castiel’s clothing on your bed, where you sleep, to be closer to your injured mate while he is recovering.”
“Are you nervous?” Dean shook his head, but Cas didn’t buy it. He moved closer, reaching out to touch Dean’s bare knee gently, nuzzling Dean’s thigh. “You’ll be fine,” Cas said, placing a delicate kiss on the smooth skin lightly sprinkled with soft hair and a generous dusting of freckles. “This isn’t our first rodeo, as they say.”
, it read, and a phone number. There was nothing else scrawled on the paper in Gilda’s neat handwriting, and Cas had no idea what this would be for.
to know. If they’re walking into the darkness, what does Dean have to lose?
“I’m sorry,” he whispered, wiping up the evidence of what he’d done. Dean didn’t reply, though Cas couldn’t blame him. “How much longer, do you think?” Castiel asked.
“Well, that’d be a story to tell the grandkids. Killed by egg nog.”
Seeing how cautiously happy it made Kevin, Dean gathered up armfuls of similar sweaters, some khakis, a couple of pale-colored button-ups, and a blazer or two and followed Charlie to the dressing rooms.
“Shit,” Bobby curses. “And it was just . . . swirling?”
“All right,” Gilda said, and Cas couldn’t help but get excited. So far they’d had omegas that weren’t strictly traditional. Kevin and Dean were male, which was rare, and also came from non-traditional backgrounds. Kevin was raised by a single beta mother, firmly middle class, and outspoken. Dean’s past was mysterious, and he certainly wasn’t a typical omega in appearance. Sarah’s family had raised her with upper-class omega expectations, but she was an active part of her father’s art dealership. Gilda could be another chance at a “typical” Vinehall omega to add to their participants.
“Why’m I up, then?”
“Alpha?” Castiel asks at last, which breaks the spell. Dean looks up at him, wetting his lips again, before reaching out and stroking Castiel’s cheek.
Dean had taken the bag and rushed up to his room. It took more guts than he’d known he had to stick the needle in his thigh the first time, but the suppressants and topical blockers made him, for all intents and purposes, a beta, and he’d never dealt with another heat after that.
“I’m from a very traditional family, Mr. Novak. I was raised with the belief that omegas are special, cherished, fragile. My grandfather supported the bill that made it illegal for omegas to work outside of the home when he was in Congress. My mother is from an old family that sent all of their omega children here. That is the world from which I come, sir.”
Dean stared for just a few seconds, long enough for Milton to raise an eyebrow, before immediately dropping his gaze to the floor. “Hello, sir,” Dean said, trying to make his voice as meek as possible. Damn, he hadn’t practiced this enough.
you, baby,” Dean said, pressing kisses into Cas’s deep collarbones, just visible under the opened neck of his Oxford shirt. Cas chuckled, but extricated himself from Dean’s grip.
Cas wiped his hands on his shirt.
He was down the steps and out to the carriage before Dean could get out another word. It had been the champagne, that was all. Surely that buzz under his skin would fade as the alcohol did.
____________
Dean stared at him for a moment, green eye searching for something. “I promise I’m not always this big of an asshole,” he said.
“It is strange to think that any version of me would not know you.”
Sam’s rambling is interrupted by a door opening down the hallway, followed by a chorus of laughter and the missing guys. Castiel immediately tenses as the rowdy group rambles into the living room. Gabe lands on the couch next to Castiel, the sweet, musky smell of weed wafting from him. Ah, so that’s where they were.
“Coming right up.”
When she was angry, Hannah had a frown to rival Naomi’s. Cas let her seethe while he gathered some fliers up again.
Gabriel stood and stalked away from the table, leaving Dean and Cas in silence.
Castiel’s stomach felt unsettled and it had very little to do with his suppressants this time. He knew his work was used to support Omega Rights groups across the country, and had even demonstrated with a few during his years in Berkeley, but his work was vulnerable now. If he was caught demonstrating, not even his “good family” would get him back in the favor of Adler and the Vinehall higher-ups.
“What in the hell were you thinking, Castiel?” she demanded. “You were supposed to take him straight back to the school, not bring him here and . . . and . . .” “Nothing happened, Hannah,” Cas said, but he winced. Her eyebrow shot up.
“Dean?” he calls out as he descends the ladder.
Dean knew Bobby was right, but it still sucked. As if the indignity of having to ride shotgun in his own car wasn’t enough, he could smell his own sour pheromones permeating the air in the car. He’d been using the scent-neutral stuff for almost a month now and it pissed him off every time he could scent changes in his emotions in the honey-leather smell. Sam had been ruthless, at first, picking up on every nuance with his sharp alpha nose, wondering why the hell his tougher-than-nails older brother was transitioning off his suppressants and letting the world scent him for the first time since puberty. Dean couldn’t tell him the real reason, so he’d had to explain at least
“Yeah you are, can feel it, feel you gettin’ tighter,” Dean panted. He wrapped an arm around Castiel’s waist and held him tight, grinding deep into him, cock nailing Castiel’s prostate. A high-pitched whine worked its way out of Castiel’s throat as Dean turned his head enough to kiss the corner of his mouth sloppily. “Come for me,” Dean gasped, and then Castiel was soaking the sheets beneath him, shuddering out the last waves as Dean’s thrusts got more erratic.
“Okay, okay, I have an ulterior motive coming here,” Gabriel said.
The male omega was named Kevin Tran, and his interview went fairly smoothly. Castiel got him talking about his mother, which took up much of the hour. She’d raised him as a beta, so there were quite a few stories he could tell about his childhood before he presented. Castiel felt a pang of pity that he had to hide when Kevin’s scent dropped low with sadness as he spoke about his dashed hopes of Harvard (or Princeton, if Harvard was out). In the end, Castiel scheduled another interview time and thanked him.
“Dean, I am the most powerful Mage in the country. Whatever is going on, I’m not proposing that you let me handle it, or help, but I could help
Dean doesn’t even slow down, shaking Castiel’s hand from his arm. He seems to debate between two books, one held in each hand, before tossing one onto the table and the other into his bag. “Don’t really have the time for a debate with you, Cas.”
“I’m only gonna tell him what he needs to know,” Bobby says while Dean glowers. Bobby turns to face Castiel. “This idjit is leading you two into something so dark and twisted it ain’t even in any of the regular books. But due to factors that’ve been in play longer than the two of you’ve been alive, Dean is . . .
He ran a warm (but not too hot, not good for conception to raise his body temperature) shower, letting the water run over his body. His skin was starting to feel too tight, prickly and sensitive, which was part of the heat, but . . .
“Stull Valley,” Cas replies. Dean nods.
“Anyway, what I was going to say is that you’re all clear for another round of IUI, but guys . . .” She looked back and forth between the two of them before putting her chart aside. “I’m not going to pretend that your situation isn’t tricky. I know we talked about this before, but I need you to seriously consider your options.”
“So.”
“Cassie, you back with us?” Gabriel asked, caution in his voice. Castiel took a deep breath of whatever had been shoved in his face—it felt like a sweater—and felt the adrenaline begin to recede. When his hands started to shake, he finally nodded. Gabriel sighed, patting his back.
“I am aware you teach at eleven, but please don’t dawdle on your way to the meeting. The representatives of the Campbell Foundation will be here promptly at noon for the luncheon.”
“Hannah?” he asked breathlessly.
Sam’s leaning against Baby in the garage when Dean finally makes it out with his duffel.
Charlie laughed, rushing through the racks and grabbing frilly skirts and blouses to try, clearly enjoying the levity of the trip, while Kevin thumbed through the racks of polo shirts and khakis. Dean saw him eyeing a pale blue cashmere sweater with something like longing, and pounced.
Now that the weed smell has dissipated, Castiel can smell what must be Dean’s scent. It’s definitely masculine, musky, like dark chocolate and motor oil. He’s the heavier notes in the apartment’s ambient scent, and it’s just as alluring as his appearance. Castiel blushes, his thoughts wandering somewhere far from appropriate while standing alone in the dark with this stranger.
But there was no time. Cas smiled and walked toward Dean. “Welcome,” he said. “Please, come in. Let me introduce you to Hannah Johnson, my research assistant, and this is Garth, he’s been assigned to us as a chaperone for the study.”
“Give him back to me, or I will destroy you,” Castiel growls.
Cas held his hips still as he came into his waiting hand, breathing slowly to hide his orgasm from Dean, who seemed to have gone quiet himself. For one terrifying moment Cas thought that Dean had been watching him, but when he chanced a glance out of the corner of his eye Dean was still watching the screen. He wiped his hand on the side of the bed tucked up against the wall and went back to watching.
For a moment Dean looks more vulnerable than Castiel has ever seen him, and he wants to crush him to his chest and keep him safe from everything. His face hardens and he seems to come to a decision.
“We could have left him at home,” Castiel replied.
Without a second though, Dean fled the bungalow and raced out into the rain, leaving Cas reeling behind him.
“What was that about?” Hannah asked, watching her walk out of the door. Cas stared after her.
Castiel looked toward Hannah in the front seat. “Hannah, can you take us to the park just outside of town?” Hannah rolled her eyes.
There were three or four packets of papers, each a different pastel color with graphics of smiling young people engaged in different activities on the cover. A large booklet in the middle was embossed with the same ink as the return address on the envelope. The dusty blue cover had a seal made of crawling vines circling an old building in the center, with the words “Vinehall School” in academic print below. Dean reached for the shiny booklet, and opened it, the smell of violets wafting off of every page.
“Enough, get a room! You know I love you two, but there’s only so much this single gal can take.”
The email alert chimed on Castiel’s phone, and he pulled it away from his ear to look at it. The email address was unfamiliar, but his heart skipped a beat when the sender’s address in the preview began with “winchest—“. He put the phone back to his ear quickly. “Sorry, Charlie, I have to go.”
The luncheon couldn’t pass quickly enough, and when it was over Castiel rose from his seat with a vague excuse and dashed off toward his office.
It was a bathroom mirror selfie, just like Castiel’s, clearly taken in a hotel room. Dean had turned his back completely to the mirror, strong muscles visible beneath tan skin dusted in freckles. Just visible above the counter was Dean’s ass cupped appealingly in a pair of fashionable red cotton briefs trimmed in white.
“Wow, I guess they must serve the good shit at Vinehall parties. Remind me to get myself invited next time!”
, even with the suppressants in me. There was an
“Thank you, but I’m not hungry.” Hannah narrowed her eyes at him.
“You can read it?” Dean asks, the spell lifting as he calms down. Bobby nods.
“I think it’s best that we . . . that you and I . . .” Cas’s inner alpha rebelled at the thought of pushing his omega away. All he wanted was to gather Dean in his arms and tell him it would be okay, that they would be safe. But they couldn’t, not now that he knew. “Dean, please just
“Still need you to fuck me, though,” he growled, almost indignant. Cas brushed his lips over Dean’s jaw.
Dean sighed. “Sure, Cas.”
Turns out Dean was maybe holding back, or maybe he just has a read on Castiel now. Despite reinstating the folding-is-safe rule, Castiel quickly loses both socks and his own jacket, while Dean simply has to remove his shirt.
“We do. What perspective would you bring?”
“Keep your voice down,” Castiel said. A small group of omega students were walking by, each dressed in airy fabrics and pretty pastels, voices soft as they spoke to each other behind their hands. A cloud of delicate omega scents drifted past them, but it was all muted under the scent of the official school scent blocker they all wore. They all smelled mostly of violets.
“Yeah,” Dean says, but there’s something strange in it. “You kind of are.”
SPOILER!!!!
“Well, you’d better go. I know it takes at least two hours to do your hair.”
He’d never felt so safe. Never felt so protected,
“Cas—”
And he truly has
“Michael Milton” was his name. Dean hadn’t known that before. Instinctively, he cowered in his seat, trying to get himself as far out of view of Milton as possible.
“Thank you, sir,” he murmured. Michael practically purred.
“Hey, there, Alpha,” Dean said, brushing Cas’s sweaty hair from his forehead. Cas kissed the tip of Dean’s nose.
“You look wonderful tonight, Dean,” Michael murmured, close to Dean’s ear. Dean shivered at the feeling of Michael’s breath ruffling his hair and hoped Michael would misinterpret it.
. His hair is a mess, and he has deep purple smudges under his eyes. He practically melts when he sees Dean.
Arousal pools in Castiel’s abdomen, coiling tighter and tighter as he grinds against Dean. Little moans and whimpers escape him as he plunders Dean’s mouth with his tongue, pressing deeper as he humps harder against Dean and into his fist. Dean tears his mouth away to press against Castiel’s ear.
The ecstatic family members had already been and gone, so now Cas was watching Dean watch her sleep in the quiet early evening hours.
Dean whistles low. “How many siblings does Gabriel
At first Castiel thinks that Dean’s outburst is because his brother just spat beer all over him, but then the salty, sharp scent of alpha arousal mixed with Sam’s natural pheromones rolls across the table. Dean gags and presses his hand over his mouth and nose.
“Dean . . .”
And damn Cas, too perceptive for his own good. Dean swallows hard, then gives the barest of nods.
“I, uh, got something for you,” Dean says at long last. Cas lifts his head in question while Dean fishes in his pockets. “Thought you could put it in your collection.”
And Castiel lets him, lets Dean gather him in his strong arms, one wrapping tight around his narrow waist, the other scooping up between his shoulder blades, and Castiel wraps his own around Dean’s sturdy shoulders. Castiel buries his face in Dean’s neck, right at the joint where his scent is strongest and breathes deeply. He shudders in Dean’s hold, a fresh rush of slick running from him, staining the air with its scent. Dean groans against him, and Castiel decides.
“I’ll see you around, Cas,” he said.
Adler burst out laughing. “Oh, Castiel, she’s
Because Dean might’ve been nesting, but Castiel had been
Dean continued to grip his slacks tightly. “I, uh . . . I dunno, I don’t really remember. Can we try something else?”
“Yup, that’s me,” Dean said. “And who’re you?”
“Yes, it is. And it’s
, though; orgasm wasn’t the end goal. As he slipped one finger easily into his hole, slick gushed out, covering his fingers. He moaned, trying to carefully explore with one finger first. It had been a while since he’d been on the receiving end of this.
echoes inside his head with each step as he strides after Dean, pressing a hand on the door to keep it open as Dean throws his duffel down on the bed.
“Right.”
, Dean thought, slick starting to stream from him and his dick starting to fill.
Dean nods, shuffling a few maps around. “Hey, Cas, come help me with these calculations.”
Castiel sipped lightly at his beer. He’d never really acquired the taste, even though Dean had spent most of his early twenties trying to convince Castiel to drink with him or accused him of “wasting it.” It didn’t really matter; the extra he’d bought would be gone by morning, anyway.
Gabriel, it turned out, lived in New York City and could drop by any time Cas wanted. Cas told him that he was pretty busy right now, but would think about it.
“Okay, then, Mr. Wizard, keep up.”
Dean locked himself in his room. He couldn’t shake the feeling of something crawling under his skin, something he knew was separate from the heat itself.
“Yeah, okay.” Another long pause. “So, just thought I’d tell you that Charlie got out. I was gonna go see her, if you wanted.”
He doesn’t.
Castiel hoped Dean was paying for dinner as the Uber dropped him off in front of the college town’s only truly upscale restaurant. Kale had started as a joke among the small group of vegan professors on campus shortly before Castiel’s arrival at the university until one of them went to culinary school and decided to open a high-end restaurant in the heart of downtown. Now, it was frequented by the few elite that managed to pass through town on business with the university. He gave the name “Winchester” at the door and was escorted to a semi-private table near the windows looking out onto the courtyard. Dean was waiting, still just as hot as ever in the suit he’d worn to campus that day. Castiel’s cheeks flushed as he pulled his chair out and sat. He ordered water before turning to face Dean with a raised eyebrow.
He probably wouldn’t be able to smell a damn thing, now. Cas felt like he was walking around with a perpetually clogged nose now that the suppressants were in full effect. All told he could barely eat, wasn’t sleeping, and couldn’t smell anything. Why some people chose to live their entire lives on the stuff was beyond him.
In the end, Dean didn’t change before his meeting. If this advisor was supposed to help him, then he had to see what he was working with. So, Dean stomped across campus in his jeans, boots, and flannel, and anybody who stared could fuck off.
is not a Christmas movie.”
The dorm hallways were warm and brightly lit, though with finals week coming to a close, many of the students had already cleared out for winter break. Since Cas was the youngest and the last to leave the nest, his parents had decided they were going to do Christmas in the Grand Caymans. Alone. Which meant Cas had gotten special permission to stay in his room over break.
. He didn’t want to bring up Michael here, in the sanctuary of Cas’s presence.
Cas could do little but writhe against Dean, hands scrabbling at the sheets and the pillows around him for purchase. His hips pistoned up into Dean’s fist, the head of his cock catching on Dean’s as Dean jacked them. Dean swiped a thumb across the head of Cas’s cock, pressing roughly into his slit, and suddenly Cas, already so close to the edge, was babbling, heat building in his gut.
“Oh?”
“Well, that was a perfect first subject,” Hannah said, even though Castiel wouldn’t look at her. “Do you think maybe you could have found someone who would have
“Strangers passed through all the time. It shouldn’t have been any different. But then . . . there was one . . .” Dean gulped. “Sam—my brother, he had a rough childhood. He got into some trouble, wasn’t gonna graduate, but then he turned it around. He’s really smart, gonna make a lot of himself, but me and Bobby, we couldn’t exactly pay tuition, and even though Sam was better, did so well his last two years of school, he wasn’t gonna get any help. So one day this alpha turns up at the shop, threatens to shut us down, have us all arrested, unless . . . unless . . .”
Dean lost his grip at that, shifting just enough to let the pressure up a little and Castiel whined at the loss. “Don’t worry, beautiful, I got better plans,” Dean said, stroking gently over Castiel’s cheekbone. Castiel shivered. Dean pressed another soft kiss into the hinge of his jaw, then breathed hot in his ear, “Gonna bury my cock in that perfect ass of yours.”
of telling me your plan? Do I mean so little to you that you couldn’t even stoop to telling me good-bye?! That I had to
All told, it takes about a week for Sam and Dean to return from their hunt. It turns out to be a vampire nest, which makes Cas clutch compulsively at his still-bandaged wrist and sends a shiver of dread down his spine.
“There’s nothing to explain. We were both consenting adults who had a casual encounter, and now I find out you’re part of the board giving me money. I understand how that looks, so of course we have to keep it a secret.”
His bladder was still full from overnight, knowing the test was most accurate first thing after waking up. He was going to have to make a decision soon, or wait at least another day before sitting and agonizing over it again.
The empty air on the other end of the call taunts him as Dean flips his phone onto the couch. It isn’t that he doesn’t date alphas, exactly, but as a male omega there are just so many challenges and issues wrapped up in dating alpha men. Dean’s avoided the whole thing since he was in his early twenties and horny. His last alpha boyfriend had been in college, and they’d broken up when Dean said he wasn’t ready for mating and pups.
“If anything, I’ll just glamor myself into you,” Sam jokes.
“Why? ‘Cause I’m an omega? Dude, you’re not seriously suggesting what I think you are?”
Dean’s blood runs cold. He’s staring down at the map fragment and has gone completely rigid. “Dean?” Castiel asks. Bobby just claps Dean on the shoulder. “Do you have a location? What’s going on?”
“It ain’t somethin’ you can heal,” Dean murmurs. Castiel continues to reach for him, anyway.
“Mmm,” Dean sighs. “Wait, what?!”
, and so hard for him. Cas’s cock is just as lovely as the rest of him, uncut like most alphas, long and thick with the suggestion of a knot beginning to swell at the base. Dean wants it in him yesterday.
Dean reached up to cradle Cas’s face in his hands and pressed back, dragging the kiss to a deeper place, before pulling back to brush them gently together.
“Both!” Dean exclaims. “Look, I can’t say I’m not grateful that you wanna help, but I just . . . I can’t . . . Fuck!”
Castiel seethed, though he knew Gabriel was right. Shockingly, Gabriel took pity on him. “Maybe she’s in the foyer?” Gabriel suggested.
“Oh, I can just—” Castiel lifted his hand to use his grace to remove the snow, but Dean took a step forward, insisting.
“I love you,” Cas said, pulling Dean from his dark spiraling thoughts. He could probably smell the sharp anxiety that was starting to seep into Dean’s worn leather scent. Dean managed a tight smile at his mate, who had propped his chin up on Dean’s thigh, continuing to rub soothing circles just above Dean’s knee.
“Well, forgive me if I can’t help but remember that the man sitting across from me had his dick in my ass not thirty-six hours ago,” Castiel hissed.
Dean concentrated on his lap, his hands clasped tightly. He knew all of this; he could handle it, he could be what they wanted. He could follow the rules and forget about Cas.
“A while? Gabriel, it’s been six years.”
“Um . . . like a band-aid, right? Quick and painless?”
,” Cas moans, hands pressing under Dean’s waistband, grasping for his ass. Dean arches his back, pushing himself into Cas’s hands. “Dean, where?”
There was a chest of drawers on the opposite side of the room where he stashed his bag of belongings and settled in to do some reading for class. He was going to miss at least five days of classes, if not more. He might as well study while he could.
Cas was incredibly nervous. His hands were slick with sweat again, and he barely recognized when the movie came on. He took deep breaths, steadying himself, as he reached into his boxers and began to stroke his cock.
up on his knees. They have a quiz on the next section of chapters in English tomorrow, and, yeah, okay, Castiel read it already, but a thorough re-read is essential to retention—
They’d taken to sleeping this way, face-to-face with the pup in the middle, cocooned and protected by her fiercely devoted parents. It had been a comfort during those early months while Dean had been on medication to prevent another miscarriage, then again in the second trimester when Dean’s cervix attempted to fail. He’d been determined to avoid bedrest, and though there was little either of them could do to affect it, somehow he’d managed to get all the way into his eighth month before he was medically required to start working from home.
But Cas is healing. Slowly. Like a human. Bruises fading to nothing, cuts knitting closed with new skin. He’s still pale, too pale, but he hasn’t seen the sun in so long that’s not surprising. Dean is back to his vigil, but with Jack there now they almost take turns. Sometimes Dean and Sam go to tackle small hunts (which Dean still sucks at, but he’s learning to work without his sense of smell – he’s sure it’s not returning at this point), sometimes Sam takes Jack. But never Dean and Jack; one of them is always with Cas.
Castiel chewed the inside of his cheek, but refrained from biting back. “Sixteen.”
without the recommendation from someone like me. You need me, Castiel, so I suggest you toe the line. You’re already on extremely shaky ground.”
“Holy shit,” Dean breathes, scrolling through Castiel’s resume. CEO of Perdition Ink, a Dartmouth degree in Classics, Yale Law, a list of accomplishments a mile long . . .
“Possibly. Though, depending on our compatibility, it could be closer to an hour.”
.” The door is loud as he slams it and Dean’s shoulders are tense as Castiel is suddenly close, so close, like they had been earlier when Dean had looked him in the eye—why won’t he look him in the eye now? “You are an
The quad was busier than the first day he’d ventured here, after his panic attack in the auditorium. He wandered to his bench out of habit, enjoying the weather. It was a different experience, clothed in the armor of the school around him. No one even glanced at him as he moved toward the bench, only to find it occupied.
He dragged himself into the shower and forced himself into a charcoal-gray suit that he saved for special occasions. He considered his favorite blue tie before settling on a forest green one. He grabbed his briefcase and headed out the door to face the day.
, Dean thinks.
Here we are, folks! All of my amazing readers, thank you!!
Castiel didn’t meet her smile. “I’m likely going home to California soon,” Castiel said flatly. “I’m going to parse my files for the rally and send you what I have. I have to . . . Dean wants me to delete his first.”
Orgasm wasn’t the goal. Getting stuffed, knotted, and filled was.
He was right on the verge of calling when the lock rattled and the front door swung open, admitting a rush of wind and snow, and a very frosty Cas laden with several full reusable grocery bags. Dean rushed toward him and grabbed a few bags so Cas could turn and shut the door.
“I’m aware of that now,” Cas says. “But you were also kind, and selfless, and I wanted to protect you. I’ve always wanted to protect you, though you’ve never given me any clue as to what in your past you were running from.”
“I’m sorry, what did you ask?” he managed, though his mouth was dry. Dean looked at him with concern.
Dean managed to scrape himself up from the bench and trudge back to his dormitory, where he flipped through his meagre wardrobe. The letter had instructed him to dress his best, fully presentable, in order to meet his advisor. Dean didn’t know jack shit about how this worked, but he was pretty sure an advisor was supposed to help him with his academic track. At least, that’s what Sam had said about alpha universities.
The spell is finally broken as Nick returns with their entrees. As he’d discussed with Benny, he gets the steak when he’d ordered lobster, while Castiel gets a modestly-portioned dinner salad. It takes Dean a second to get into gear to set the plan back in motion. Dean shivers, suddenly pushing away a strange thrill of guilt at throwing a fit in Benny’s restaurant, but Benny had been cool with it as long as Dean doesn’t make
“Charlie—”
“Cas, wait.” Castiel stopped, but didn’t turn. “I’m sorry if I’ve done anything to offend you . . .”
getting all scent-drunk!”
“Shh, sweetheart, you have to relax,” Cas breathes, soothing Dean. He reaches up for a kiss, gently tracing feather-light circles on Dean’s obliques. Dean kisses Cas, legs wrapped around his waist as Cas starts to press in again. Dean takes his length more easily now, and then Cas is in to the hilt, his knot nudging at Dean’s entrance. He’s never felt so full, so complete.
“Kidnap?” Dean exclaims. “Are you kidding? He’s the one who won’t leave me alone. He’s practically a stalker.”
“What do you think?”
“Scent compatible, I believe,” Cas says. “Sometimes, with a particular predisposition to another’s pheromones, blockers are insufficient to mask the scent.”
Dean sits carefully in the chair he’d had Sam set up next to Cas’s bed and bundles himself tighter. It’s honestly pretty hard to look at Cas, but Dean does. He has to. There are livid splotches of bruises all over Cas’s swollen face. Blood still stands out from his busted lip and broken nose. Bright purple marks stand out against the paler skin of his neck where Dean’s hands had wrapped around it. If Dean hadn’t wrested control back in time, Michael might have torn Cas’s throat out. It turns his stomach.
“What’s up, Cas?” Charlie said, flashing him a grin, looking him up and down. “Ugh, you, too? You guys are so hot, it’s totally unfair. If I were into dudes, I’d be all over that.”
Dean started, hugging himself against the cold as he turned and backed away from his unexpected companion.
“Well, thanks.”
Hello Dean,
With an enthusiasm Castiel refused to acknowledge, he clicked back into the message, hoping to find something promising there. He couldn’t help but grin at what he saw.
Shit, Dean was losing it. He needed . . . he should . . .
Flashes of his dream appeared to him then, and with a shock, an image of blue eyes, dark hair, and a voice like gravel. “Alpha!” Dean cried, thick, clear ropes of come painting the bed below him.
“Thanks,” Castiel said, taking the cloth from Dean and wiping himself down perfunctorily. He ached, but it was a good ache. Castiel focused on that as the tension rose between them.
He couldn’t find Hannah, for all of his searching, but he did manage to drag Gabriel away from a crowd who had taken to gambling on dice in a corner.
Dean’s head was buzzing. He stared down at the envelope. A large embossed return address was stamped in the top corner, his own name and mailing address hand written in the center in rich black ink with many unnecessary flourishes. The whole thing smelled like violets, and Dean’s stomach turned over.
Castiel chewed his lip. He didn’t have any pictures that showed as much as Dean’s; he’d have to take one, and how should he do that? There was a full-length mirror in his bathroom, and the lighting wasn’t bad, but wasn’t that tacky? And what should he wear?
“Dean,” Cas gasps, “fuck, Dean . . .”
“Okay, Dean. You’ve got clean sheets and toys in here,” Gabriel said, indicated the wardrobe, “and Cassie and I will drop by with food and water. How long do your heats usually last?”
Sam’s hand is still on his shoulder, stopping him. His heart aches with the loss, with the
Slowly, Castiel moved across the room, kicking his shoes off and shrugging off his jacket. Dean reached up and loosened his own tie, pulling it over his head and discarding his suit jacket. Castiel took in the details of Dean’s features up close as they slowly unbuttoned each others’ shirts. This close, the grey in his temples and stubble was more pronounced, streaks of silver scattered through his honey-brown hair. As they dropped their shirts to the ground, Dean slid his hands under Castiel’s undershirt and gently tugged it up and over his head, fingertips skirting over Castiel’s sides and causing him to flinch. Dean smirked.
“Yes, Naomi has fine tastes,” Castiel replied, sipping at his water. Dean shook his head.
Dean’s eyes fly open to meet Cas’s blue ones. Cas smiles. He’s doing that a lot more now.
“I’m going to recruit,” he said. He avoided Hannah’s gaze as she sat at her desk and began to pull her lunch from its bag.
As the appetizer arrived, Castiel was grateful for the change in the atmosphere. He munched thoughtfully on the crispy bacon and mushrooms, the silence stretching long between them. Castiel watched Dean as he stared of out the window and was struck again by how handsome he was. If it had been any other time and place, he would have been beside himself to be out on a date with this man. As it was, the phantom of Dean’s touch, the fluttering kisses on his neck, the feel of him stretching Castiel wide for the first time . . . it was all distracting enough that he had to shift in his seat.
“Bartholomew Boyle” was tall, and relatively handsome, except for the creepy leer that seemed permanent on his face.
“Yeah, okay. Honest mistake.”
“You are an anatomically complete male alpha, correct?”
Except Dean, if Michael showed up.
Dean fell through the open door, stumbling over his feet as Cas caught him by the shoulders. The alpha was trying to have as little contact with him as possible, which Dean both resented and felt grateful for. Cas propped him up against a nearby wall and rushed off.
. And I can’t have any distractions, Gabe.”
“Mortal.”
“Gorgeous,” he says. Castiel blushes.
Sam managed to turn his whole attention to the phone, matching Dean’s serious tone. “Yeah?”
“Oh, they’re fine. Max thinks he’s found his true mate, though if that’s the case he’s an evolutionary marvel, because this is the
Dean regards him for a moment, then his expression grows hard. “My full name is Dean Winchester,” he says stiffly. “Winchester Wood is my family estate. The darkness in Stull Valley is my inheritance.”
a few weeks ago, and I’ve tried to distance myself, but I . . .”
,” he breathes, holding him close.
“Get control over your omega,” he said as Dean struggled. Cas had his chest pressed flat against Dean’s back, holding him tightly even as Dean fought harder to get away.
Castiel held the phone away from his ear at Charlie’s shriek. “Please, Charlie, a little louder. I think I still have a functioning ear drum.”
“Yes, I’m doing a research project with omegas at the school, so Mr. Adler thought it best that I go on suppressants for the time being. He had mentioned something about special permission . . .”
Dean checked the clock and briefly considered lying, but even though Cas was barely awake, he would somehow know in the morning. And tomorrow (later today, really) was probably the worst day to start out angry with each other.
“You finished with those charts yet?” Bobby barks. Dean lifts his calculations up.
Balthazar scoffed, unperturbed, and slid Castiel’s phone from his grip, dancing away when Castiel tried to grab it back. “Oh, please, Cassie, this is getting ridiculous. I’ve already done all the work for you. All you have to do is scan through the specimens and make your choice.”
After a quick shower, Dean could feel the heat rising in his guts again. He had to lean on Kevin as they approached their building’s heat rooms. A beta guard took one look at Dean and unlocked the nearest room, showing both omegas inside. Kevin dumped the bag Dean had managed to scrape together on the floor, then high-tailed it back to their room, or anywhere other than there, really. Dean didn’t blame him.
Dean looks away. “Since you let Sam into the Society,” Dean mutters to his pie. Cas nods.
“Not yet, little Omega. I’m going to court you, and then when the time comes, I will possess you, body and soul.”
Additional warnings at the end of the chapter.
“Would be shorter with you, I bet.”
“That,” Castiel agreed. “I want that.”
“Nobody said anything about a date,” Dean said, an eyebrow raised. “
“The Beringer?” Nick asks Castiel. Castiel doesn’t glance at the menu, he instead looks to Dean.
A pink tinge appeared on Dean’s cheeks. “Yeah, I say your name a lot, Cas, we live together—”
It was strange to move through an alpha’s home and not get any of their scent. There were traces of something old, faint, but there was no way Dean could be sure it was Cas’s and not a previous resident. The suppressants were certainly doing their job. The rain had probably washed off all of Dean’s blockers, and he would have worried if he didn’t know that Cas’s nose was likely completely disabled by his shots.
“I don’t know, but I know that whatever it is, I don’t want to let it go.”
How long will Dean let him follow?
It wasn’t that bad, actually, because his roommate, Dean, was taking a couple of classes and would be staying, too. The two Freshmen had been matched randomly by the school’s roommate assignment software, and got along famously. Dean was a social butterfly, but also fiercely introverted and dedicated to his studies so he treated the room as his sanctuary. He was dating a gorgeous Sophomore named Lisa, but Cas had never seen Dean invite her back to their room. Probably because she had an apartment off campus with a friend, but it was still nice to know that he could depend on his room being quiet when he needed it to be.
Edited to add: I don't want to spoil anything, but please don't worry about Dean being with anyone other than Cas. He's in a bad situation, but it won't go that far! I might have minimalist tags, but that's definitely something I'd warn about.
“I know,” Charlie said. “I mean, you kinda are the one who saved my ass by calling big brother here.”
The pit of dread in Dean’s stomach grew heavier as he walked down the marble-floored hallway of the administration building. The fucking thing was built like a palace: vaulted ceilings, gold leaf accents, gleaming marble, the whole nine. They also kept the thing like a walk-in freezer. The temperature was cold enough to hang meat. Dean wrapped his arms around himself in his stupid cashmere sweater to stop shivering.
“Castiel is just waiting for the right person,” Hannah said.
“Please,” Castiel pants, not knowing quite what he wants. Dean presses soft kisses into his throat and dives back in to devour his mouth as he reaches down and wraps his big hand around both of them.
“Are you seriously considering hooking up with one of these men, Castiel?” Hannah asked, looking over Charlie’s shoulder as she scrolled through the messages.
The snow piled up all night, and when they woke up the next morning tangled up in the covers on Dean’s bed (“It’s
Dean slips into the cream loafers he found at a consignment shop and runs another hand through his heavily spiked hair. Sam’s a beta, and has never had to worry about all of the politics surrounding secondary gender. He’s also been extremely lucky: he married his college sweetheart, Eileen, and they have two gorgeous pups that keep him busy.
Castiel chewed on his lip before managing to reply.
“Please, Alpha,” Dean said, running his hand down the door. “I’m sorry, Alpha, I’ll be better.”
“No way!” he finally managed, while Charlie and Kevin laughed along with him. “It’s really not that interesting, dude.”
Dean ran a hand over his face. “Shit, Bobby. So, what, they own my ass?”
Castiel’s apartment was nowhere near as opulent as the hotel where Dean was staying, but Castiel couldn’t bring himself to care that he hadn’t done the dishes, nor picked up the living room as he pulled Dean inside and over to the couch. Dean pushed him back onto the cushions gently before climbing into his lap, kissing him soundly. Castiel groaned as his hands found their way to Dean’s ass, grabbing hold tightly as Dean writhed on top of him.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Um . . . I read, mostly.” And fix cars, but since that’s what got him into this whole mess, Dean left it out. Milton made a face.

“Samson!” Gabriel cries, grinning at the enormous alpha youth standing in the doorway. He’s all arms and legs, nearly a foot taller than Gabriel, with floppy brown hair and a kind face.
Dean nodded, mouth dry. Crowley adjusted his chair to lean a bit more forward.
“Nah. Bobby’s organizational system is a mystery to everyone who doesn’t know him. It’s here somewhere.”
Castiel blushes, but doesn’t deny what she’s implying. “How can I help him, Ellen?” he implores. She regards him with her deep brown eyes.
Castiel looked over at him, somehow still dressed, a strange tension in his limbs. He didn’t want to think too deeply about what possessed him to say: “Stay.”
“They let betas into Harvard?” Dean asked. Kevin smiled, for real this time.
“So? It’s college! Isn’t that the time to experiment?”
, the door swung open to admit his doctor.
Speaking of, the heat rooms really needed a tub. The small standing shower was not worth it when he knew he was just going to get filthy again in a few minutes.
“And I’m sure you’re still recovering from your ordeal with the archangel.”
It’s fucking hot outside, because it’s August, but Dean still got roped into playing a game of tag with Mary, Patrick, and a handful of other pups their age around the fringes of the CandyCorp picnic. He’d been losing on purpose for a few rounds before a few of the older pups decided he’d function better as “base,” so now he’s just standing still while pups fight to get their hands on him to be “safe.” A couple of Charlie’s coworkers and their spouses have joined in the game, too, chasing their own pups around the open park space. Sam is trying to chase after Mary without trampling the small children, so Dean watches as he trips over his own feet, falling face down into the grass. Dean throws back his head and laughs, and a few of the pups surrounding him dissolve into giggles.
Cas squints at him—which is definitely one of the things Dean thinks is endearing about him but is definitely
“How could you not give me the
“Deep breaths, Cassie,” he said, rubbing Cas’s back. “In through the nose, out through your mouth. Jesus, did somebody roofie you?”
How long had it been since they’d left? Had Hannah managed to catch Dean? Perhaps she was driving, and couldn’t answer the phone.
“Yeah, well, do I got wine goggles on when I wanna kiss you every minute of every god-damn day? I don’t think so.”
“In a manner of speaking. For all that matters, yeah.” Bobby watched Dean’s face pale, then sighed. “You got yourself into some real shit here, son.”
“Uh, yeah. Sorry, I can not use it, if you don’t like it.”
He notices the pause, but Castiel doesn’t push. “It’s a bit cramped for two adults and two growing boys,” he says instead.
Castiel Novak is fucking
“Thanks . . . again,” Castiel said. Dean just nodded.

will still be there in a week or two or more. But Dean knows better. An omega without his sense of smell is vulnerable, weak . . .
“What?” Dean demands.
“Oh? That boy absolutely
So, when Kevin burst into their room with news, Dean wasn’t quite as excited as Kevin had hoped.
The ballroom was lit with the soft glow of candlelight, gentle music drifting from a string ensemble in the far corner. It was hardly crowded; from the overwhelming smell of violet scent blockers, the room was also overwhelmingly full of omegas. Sarah had warned them that alphas would be few and far between, which meant they could successfully stick to themselves all night and not be judged for it.
“I know, I know. Look, I dunno what to tell you. He’s
“Yeah, well, he’s Gabriel’s youngest brother. His parents ran out of the popular angel names after four other boys.”
Dean, it turned out, was staying in a fancy downtown hotel just a few blocks from the bar. They didn’t talk much on their way, but at one point Dean reached out and slipped his hand into Castiel’s back pocket. Castiel’s pulse kicked up and he wrapped his arm around Dean’s waist in return.
“Hey, you want that?” Dean asked, making Kevin jump. He shrugged.
“You are the luckiest pup in the whole world, Emma,” Dean murmured, his scent thick with pride and love. “Your papa and I love you very much. We waited a long time for you, kid.”
“Ticklish?” he teased, but Castiel got his revenge as he dug his own fingertips into Dean’s side, causing Dean to crumple with laughter, falling to the bed as Castiel chased him to continue his assault. Dean finally got hold of Castiel’s wrists again and flipped them so he straddled Castiel’s chest, Castiel’s feet planted on the floor. Dean kept eye contact as he pulled his own undershirt over his head. He pulled back at first when Castiel reached up to trail fingers down the dusting of silvered chest hair that led over Dean’s waist (trim but soft around the edges) and disappeared below his belly button and into his pants. Castiel followed it further, skating fingers over the impressive bulge pressing against Dean’s zipper. Dean shuddered, then reached down and pressed Castiel’s hand firmly into the hard line of his cock.
“Yeah, I’m sure. He was safe and sound when we got home, nothing weird.”
Jack beams at that, then his smile falters again. “I couldn’t save Castiel,” he whispers. “I tried, and I couldn’t. I don’t have any grace left.”
“One night, while his two eldest sons were hunting alone in the thickest part of the wood, they were set upon by a large pack of hounds, so big and vicious that the few survivors of the attack claimed they had to be hellhounds. The brothers were torn apart; there was nothing left to bring back to the father. That night, a dark cloud gathered over the entire valley, turning every field barren and every forest dark and impassable, trapping the residents in their homes and isolating it from outside help. By the time anyone discovered what had happened, the entire valley was dead. Just, gone, Wiped off the map. All that was left was a big, blank smudge on the map.”
Eager to help, Castiel moves over and helps Dean with a few star chart configurations while Dean firmly ignores Castiel’s attempts to catch his eye.
Dean glances at him. “What, the pups?” Castiel nods.
The door closed behind Gabriel, but Adler didn’t speak. He walked through the living room, taking in the small pile of boxes and personal belongings waiting to make it to Gabriel’s impractical car.
“Sorry, sorry! Look, Cas, I just wanted to explain—”
“I happen to be Archmage of Lebanon, which you might have forgotten, and I am not
Castiel rolls his eyes, but Dean’s are dancing with laughter. “You’re incorrigible,” Castiel laments fondly. Dean grins.
Cas pales. “Dean, my apologies, I—that is completely unforgiveable. Trust me when I say that I am completely disease-free and will be able to provide you with recent test results as soon as I can get home to—”
“I hope you don’t think I’m used to this kind of thing,” he said.
“Awesome.”
,” Castiel continued, “I am not interested. As I’ve said at least once every six months since we turned sixteen: please refrain from interfering in my love life.”
“And you’re a student here at Vinehall, Dean?”
This was stupid. This was so, so stupid. How could he have been such an idiot? What was he going to do now? It was still raining . . . maybe the rain . . .
Cas complies, sliding out and punching back in, grazing Dean’s prostate with that gorgeous, fat cockhead as he plunges in again and again. Dean could hardly do anything more than hang on while Cas fucks into him.
Dean couldn’t reply, wasn’t sure what Michael wanted him to say, but Michael didn’t seem to care. Dean turned away, staring out at the Vinehall grounds. Michael sighed.
“Don’t be cute. I obviously think you guys would be great together. But it’s also, y’know, a favor to me. For my boss.”
He can’t remember answering, but he must have, because suddenly he’s filled with a gentle, soothing sense of calm, radiating from his right shoulder down into his arm and eventually through his whole body. It eases the burn until it fades to almost nothing before the palm starts to retreat.
“I can’t afford it,” Kevin said. His own wardrobe was more traditionally “omega” than Dean’s, but it still had wear and tear, and wasn’t made of the high-quality materials found in this shop. Dean shrugged back.
“No one should be afraid to talk about their lives,” Castiel said evenly. He could hear Naomi’s frown.
“I’m sorry you’re so far from him, then,” Cas said, resisting the urge to reach out and touch Dean. Dean smiled lightly at him.
“I’m passionate about my work,” he said carefully. They held eye contact for a moment, then Gilda nodded slightly, pocketing his card.
“Fine,” Kubrick says, and moves back to let Dean and Castiel through the gate. Kubrick slams it with a clanging finality behind them.
incorrigible,” he counters.
“They handed us these on our way out of the door, after you bolted. This one’s yours.” Dean accepted the envelope with a nod. “You sure you’re okay?”
He checked his email first, hoping to have heard from Naomi. His inbox contained only the usual newsletters and group updates from the university, along with a brief message from Hannah that she had caught a cold and wouldn’t make it in to work today. With no interviews scheduled, Castiel thought he might transcribe for a few hours and then make his way back home. He was already dreading the walk back.
With suppressants, Cas wouldn’t be a very compatible mate, anyway, but better safe than mauled by desperate omegas.
He didn’t need the reminder.
“Gods, do that again,” Dean moans, throwing his head back. Castiel uses the opportunity to kiss his way down Dean’s throat, fingers dancing with sparks down his exposed arms. “You feel so good, Cas.”
“Which no man living can read,” Castiel interjects.
Castiel smiled encouragingly at him. “That’s okay. You don’t have to share anything you don’t want to.”
“I can’t—I gotta get home.”
The world is overwhelming for a new omega, something his beta brother Gabriel can’t really understand. That’s one of the reasons why Castiel has become such a homebody in the last few months.
“OF A BITCH!!!”
Dean presented him with one of the porn DVDs they’d watched together. In fact, it was the one Charlie recommended, the last one they’d watched before Dean had moaned Cas’s name. Cas swallowed hard.
“Dean—” Castiel tries as Dean walks past him, and for a moment it looks like Dean’s going to ignore him before he turns around and strides to Cas and pulls him into his arms. They’re tight around him, tighter than Sam’s, and Castiel can actually
“Dean, you have to stop,” Cas whispered in Dean’s ear. “Please.”
Dean let go of a breath he didn’t even know he was holding. “Heya, Sammy.”
Michael pulled a long, thin leather box from his jacket pocket and handed it over to Dean who tried not to let his hands shake as he took it and opened it.
“Castiel Novak,” he said. The very tall man extended his hand next.
“Castiel.”
“If you ever do need anything, let me know.” He leaned against the desk and looked Dean in the eye. “I take good care of my things, Dean. When you graduate, you’re going to be my companion. You belong to me. One day, if things work out the way I’d like, you’ll wear my bite and my grandmother’s ring.”
“So stealin’ the Book of the Damned wasn’t enough, you had to kidnap the Archmage, too?” Bobby asks, sinking heavily into a chair behind a large wooden desk.
“Sure thing, Jody,” Dean said.
“Fuck this stupid tie,” he muttered, fumbling with his bowtie. Sarah took pity on him and helped him tie it properly before turning back to Dean.
The pause that followed was long enough that Castiel reached out and stopped the recording device. “Thank you, Dean, for sharing that with me.” Dean nodded.
“So, let’s get to know each other, shall we? You can sit.”
“It’s okay,” Dean said, holding up a hand, but Dean did not look okay. A blotchy red rash was spreading down his neck, sweat beading across his forehead. He pressed a hand to his chest, his breathing quick and labored.
Dean manages to get them and the living room cleaned up enough that they can make their way to Dean’s bedroom. Dean’s bed is basically a nest, piled high with pillows and blankets and all of them soaked in Dean’s alpha scent. Castiel climbs in and rolls around in it, gathering handfuls of blankets and pressing them into his face. He looks up to see Dean’s face in the light from the single candle they’d brought from the living room, gazing softly at him.
Charlie blinked at him for just a second, then seemed to recover. “Yeah. Yeah! Come in! Cas is with someone else right now, but if you just wait here, you’ll be next!”
Castiel swallowed hard, steeling himself. “With all due respect, sir, I’m an academic researcher. If my integrity is compromised, all of the work will be for naught, and your own reputation—”
“Yup. According to this, the convergence happened at the last full moon.”
“You still called your brother. Thank you.”
Dean manages to suppress his grin as the kid tries to process the fact that he is the guy meeting what is probably one of the richest alphas in the dining room right now. He follows obediently, a slight spring in his step, as the host leads him to a quiet table near the windows at the back of the restaurant. Dean smiles politely at the host as he gestures to the table, but stops dead when he turns.
“I came to record stories. Omegas’ stories. We have far too little of that in our society, I think. We tell omegas what to think, rather than asking them to tell us for themselves.”
“Oh, don’t worry,” he whispered, kissing the sensitive spot below Dean’s ear and eliciting a shudder. Dean took advantage of the opportunity and rolled on top of Cas, grinding his hips onto the alpha’s cock, spreading his slick all over. Cas groaned.
Bobby peers it at, then whistles low.
Gabriel looked suspicious, but clapped Cas on the shoulder. “All right, then. Let’s get you the hell out of here.”
“Har har,” Kevin said, swinging open a door. “Charlie, this is Dean, my roommate. Dean, this is Charlie. We met in an online fan forum last year.”
Dean nearly choked again. “Were what, together?” Castiel shrugs. “No way, man. It’s ladies for Charlie, all the way. Nah, Gabriel’s a good boss. Kind of a dick, but you expect that from a tech mogul.”
,” he hisses, stabbing the steak with the fork. He kind of wants to cry because the fork sinks right in, parting buttery meat that smells divine. Maybe he can talk Benny into something to go after this.
“Yup, same page. No hard feelings.”
Dean walked into the office, hesitating on whether he should close the door behind him. Crowley looked at him with disdain.
“I know,” Cas replied softly. Dean pushed himself to his feet.
“It’s what
“Later, Cas.”
“I’ll send you appropriate books. You won’t find anything inappropriate at Vinehall, but I’ve heard you’re venturing out on the town now.” Dean started, but of course Milton knew. He’d paid for Dean’s new clothes. “You do look lovely in the sweater I bought you. Would you like more?”
Milton didn’t seem to mind, though. “Hello, Dean,” he said, his voice rich and smooth. The sheer amount of
The Uber driver was late, which meant Castiel had to wait in the fancy hotel lobby while people walked past him and stared. He knew he had to reek of sex, so he was grateful when the car arrived and he could avoid getting the police called on him for prostitution.
“Sorry, Mr. Winchester, but I have office hours in a few minutes.”
“It was Benny and Andrea. Charlie stood up for them, and she got arrested, too. Gilda just told me.”
“Okay, Doc,” he said, looking up. “Lay it on me.”
“Yeah. So what do you say, fellas? Wanna figure this out once and for all?”
____________
“Dammit, Sammy, if you tell me, we might be able to save him!”
“Dean, what is it?” Castiel asks, taking the bucket from him. Dean clenches and unclenches his fist, breathing deeply. “Is this something to do with what happened the first night?”
In truth, he has no idea what he’s doing, but Dean takes in a sharp breath when Castiel places his thumbs in his own waistband. The flickering candlelight around them illuminates him enough that Dean can watch as he teases himself with his thumbs, first dipping in deep, then moving to the front where he flicks open the button. Dean’s tongue darts out to lick his lips, his hands flat on his thighs while he watches Castiel openly.
“I have until December,” Castiel said. “I’ll get what I need. And I will send you my literature review by Saturday.”
“Sorry, sorry, it’s just, I thought about looking into him when you sent me the screenshot, just to make sure he’s good enough for my bestie, and then you find out he’s the head of the board of the company behind your grant? That’s just . . . Cas, this is
“Yeah, but he’s also a really good guy, Dean. Plus, look, you’ve been on a long streak of dating other omegas, so, maybe an alpha might be different? Could change things up a little?”
The inside of Blue was, well,
Castiel inclined his head toward her, ignoring the subtle dig. As an interior designer with his own successful firm, Castiel found himself cornered by Bela at every one of Sandover’s company parties he’d ever attended. The first one had been a lavish New Year’s Eve party hosted in one of the swankiest restaurants in town, and he’d been nervous; Castiel’s social skills were rusty at best on a good day. It had taken a great deal of coaxing from his new boyfriend to get him to return to a party after Bela’s thorough dressing-down ended in stares and titters from the other executives and their dates.
“Fuck, baby, I want you,” Dean breathed against Cas’s lips, left hand grazing down Cas’s side and toying with his nipple. Cas arched into the touch, biting hard on his lip.
“On it.”
Dean nearly jumps when Jack pokes his head into the bedroom door. “Dammit, Jack. We gotta get you a bell.”
“Enough, Gabriel,” Hannah tutted.
He ended the call without a reply. He would have to screen his calls more carefully from now on.
“Mmmhmm . . .” Cas trailed off as he leaned forward. Dean compulsively licked his lips a moment before Cas slotted their mouths together, feather-light and tentative. Nervous. Why was Cas nervous? He had to know Dean wanted this, too?
“It could have been worse, I suppose. How was World Literature?”
Well, that was blunt. “No,” Castiel said.
“Fuuuuck,” Dean groaned, pushing himself up. There were protocols for this, but he couldn’t remember them right now. Heats came in waves, but Dean had been pumping suppressants into his body for so long, there was no telling what this might be like. He needed to get Kevin; the kid would know what to do.
“Oh my god, Dean, you guys are gonna get in so much trouble!”
“One set up is more efficient to pack, if you think about it,” Cas offers. Dean accepts it gratefully
“Hey, bright side, though? You can go with me, Gilda, and Sarah.”
and walked away. Castiel excused himself from the table as gracefully as he could, keenly aware of Dean following him.
,” Castiel says, and suddenly a deep growl erupts from Dean. Castiel jumps back, but Dean clears his throat and reaches for the cards.
“I understand,” Castiel said. “The impulse to run from your past. I feel it, too.”
“Many of the omegas here already know who their mates will be,” he said. “Is that true of you?”
He hung up without hearing her “Good night.” He touched the pendant again, lost in thought.
something Cas ever needs to know—then says, “Manhattan?”
come instead?
“I guess I can accept that. I’m pretty persuasive. Oh! I also think you should move in right away. Let’s go get your stuff!”
He needed to check in with Sam, just to touch base. To reassure himself that Sam was okay.
“Dean . . .”
“I’m only wearing blockers, Dean,” he says softly. “And, am I to suppose, the same is true for you?” Dean nods. “So, would it surprise you to know . . . you’ve smelled like honeysuckle since the first night I met you?”
Castiel ground his teeth and turned off the television, throwing himself into his research. He had a lot of work to do.
Castiel’s stomach is in knots. “The key to an evil curse is . . . love?” he breathes. A long moment passes between them until Dean reaches out to gently touch Castiel’s cheek.
“All right, see if that will work,” Gabriel said. Castiel slowly lowered the sweater from his face to sniff cautiously at the air.
And he isn’t. Certainly not after it’s his fault that Cas is like this. He should dismantle that stupid nest in his room, put everything back, ignore his dumb omega nature like he always has and start living like the beta Michael turned him into. He hasn’t had a heat since, probably won’t have another one again. And then Jack says that bullshit about mates, and his head is reeling . . .
Castiel’s back slams against the door, punching a surprised breath out of him, and Dean breaks away just far enough to gasp out, “
“Dean—”
“Hey, uh, Kevin?” Dean asked. Kevin looked up from his book.
“Perhaps he can. Perhaps he can hear and see everything. How would he feel know it is
“Can I touch you?” Castiel asks. Dean nods. Castiel reaches out and wraps a hand around Dean’s thick shaft.
“Completely?”
“Of course,” he said. Hannah shot him a look, but Castiel pressed very gently at her arm to calm her. Zachariah chuckled.
If there’s one thing that letting Michael wear him to the prom taught Dean, it’s patience.
Dean can practically hear the eye roll on the other end of the phone, and maybe he smiles. Just a little. “Thank you, I’m fine. It’s Jack we should be concerned about—”
“I guess I’ll go,” Dean said softly. “It was, uh.” He cleared his throat. “I liked seeing you, last night.”
Dean looked up. “What?”
Castiel seethed. “I cannot even
to go after Dean, to protect him. “I can’t go without knowing . . .” he stops, licking his lips. “What is going on?”
Samuel cut across them. “Please, I insist.” Hannah blushed prettily, which caused an irrational rush of anger to surge through Castiel, though he was unable to refuse.
Dean can feel Cas’s eyes on him, boring holes into his skull. This was his own damn fault. If he hadn’t developed fucking
Late one night, Dean is tossing and turning in the room the Society has so graciously offered him—since he saved the world and everything—when he decides enough is enough. He gets out of bed and pads quietly down the hallway toward Cas’s study. He glances for a moment at the ancient instruments still and quiet on their wall, the smoke having disappeared when Cas recited the spell. He gives them a wide berth before heading down the hall to knock on Cas’s door.
Castiel sat at the table with them cautiously. “Okay, so what is this about?”
Because Castiel is nothing special, just some geeky omega, who’s smart, sure, but definitely not worthy of this stunning, brilliant older alpha whose hands feel strong and warm where they caress his shoulders. Whose gaze feels like it can see right through him, and whose scent wraps him in its arms like coming home.
“Really, Dean?” Cas asked, hands grasping at the back of his shirt. Dean nodded.
The next few hours passed in a haze of slick and come, his ass so stretched he could practically pull the knot from his channel without deflating it. He whined as he shifted his hips, circling them so the knot would rub against all of his walls. What kind of alpha did he have that would send him such an inadequate knot? Didn’t his alpha know what he needed? Couldn’t
Still, though, he’s eighteen and still newly presented. He can’t help the tiny trickle of slick that drips from his hole. He doesn’t think Dean notices; it’s dark, though, and Dean’s slight nostril flare could be completely unrelated.
The sound of the foil wrapper, another click of the lube bottle, and then Dean was straddling Castiel’s ass, the thick head of his cock pressing between his cheeks.
“You okay?” Dean asked, easing his fingers out of Castiel, his eyes full of concern. Castiel smiled sheepishly.
“Nah, don’t think that’s a good idea,” Dean chuckled. “Enclosed space and all.”
“Dean, I can’t . . . we should . . .”
“Baz, don’t be a dick,” Charlie replied, without heat.
“C’mon, Cas, you know I can just find it later on my own.” She raised her brow as he stared her down. It was the knowledge that she could do far more damage later on her own that had him unlocking his phone and sliding it over. Charlie’s eyebrows hit the ceiling.
Jazzy Christmas music was playing from the stereo system in the corner, boxes scattered around the floor in various states of unpacking. In the opposite corner stood an artificial tree, the kind with lights already attached, and dancing—
Castiel gets another excellent hand (a full house with two cards in the flop), but he must be overeager because Dean makes a big show of sniffing the air before folding.
Castiel blushes all the way up to his hairline. “It’s Castiel,” he manages. Dean just continues to smile.
Gilda blushed. “You mean, am I ‘promised?’” Cas nodded. “No, I am not. I . . . my family has not designated a mate for me yet.”
The now-familiar scent of omega mourning still filled the house when he entered. It had grown a little stale, less fresh than it had been in recent days. So, it wasn’t the scent that surprised him as he made his way through the kitchen and into the living room.
The knocking had grown more insistent until Dean had stumbled to the door, wrenching it open. The beta took a step back from the crazed omega and the overwhelming heat scent that probably rushed through the open door.
Between him and cosmic consequences.
Gabriel whistled low between his teeth, but didn’t say anything. Cas nodded and took another drink of water.
“Hannah,” he said with some relief. She kept him grounded.
The last interview with Kevin Tran had been a full forty-five minutes, so it was going to take quite a while to transcribe. Cas had gotten used to the speech patterns of some of their regular participants, so he was actually cutting down his usual transcription time significantly. The Tran, Fay, and Blake files were all pretty large. Large enough, in fact, that Castiel would soon be able to start compiling and processing the data into his final project. He still needed the extension from Naomi to continue gathering data, but if he simply stayed with Gabriel, instead of returning to California . . .
“Dean—”
. . . He shakes his head, and Sam’s expression pinches. He’s worried, and suddenly it’s jarring that Dean can see that, but can’t catch a hint of it on the air.
Hannah stood in the hallway, arms crossed and eyebrow raised. Cas sighed and pushed past her.
It was far-fetched, but not impossible. But . . . no, surely if he was . . .
! I can’t believe I didn’t . . .
He went into his room and slammed the door behind him, taking deep breaths. Something sickly and bitter tickled his nose. Great, now the blockers were wearing off and he could scent his own anger and panic coming off of him in waves. He tried to take deep breaths to calm himself, but he couldn’t get Milton’s cold gaze out of his head. Before he made a conscious decision, he was in front of his laptop with his Skype app open.
Cas wanted to scream, to shake him, to tell him that no, it had nothing whatsoever to do with self-preservation, but he bit his tongue. He was attempting to save Dean, not drag him down further.
“Hey!” Dean said, perking up. Cas quickly pulled his hand back. “Benny dropped off a six pack a while ago. Want to get drunk and watch porn?”
Castiel woke the next morning to a world blanketed in white. The snow had been late in coming this year, from what the locals said. To Cas, whose recent experiences with snow had been rather sparse, it seemed like someone had muted the entire universe. Gabriel had been up early to go to work preparing the case for the LaFittes, so Cas found that the driveway had already been shoveled. Nevertheless, Cas didn’t want to risk driving in such unfamiliar conditions. The house was only a couple of miles from the school, so Castiel set out to walk.
“That was rhetorical, son,” Adler said. “I agreed, didn’t I? I’m still not sure about the whole thing, but you come from a decent family and I have a lot of respect for Dr.  Milton. Hell of an alpha, even if she’s female. I’m sure you can behave yourself.”
“How can I do that?” Castiel asks.
“No fucking way, Sam, you’re staying here. You’re lucky I stopped here at all—”
“Yes.”
,” Dean corrected through clenched teeth. “I’m Dean. Winchester.”
“I’m not wearing anything special tonight,” Castiel muttered. Dean shook his head.
“Dean, I know you’re in there. I know you can hear—”
____________
Rowena looks far too knowing for Castiel’s liking. “Oh, dearie, I gave up attachments long ago. You would know better than me.”
“He’d destroy his collection?” Castiel gasps.
“So, why is Dean going to this omega companion factory again?”
Crowley didn’t say anything, simply looked up at him and raised an eyebrow. The air rapidly fled the room.
Dean didn’t miss the tone in her voice, blushing again and looking down at his shoes. Castiel made a few embarrassed noises, then went to get his coat.
case.”
“Dean . . .”
They ran several blocks in the wrong direction to go back to the main Vinehall campus, but soon reached a small bungalow near the edge of the school’s property. Cas opened the door and dashed inside, pulling Dean in behind him.
and that’s . . . not a great idea.
Dean knows that the closer they get to their destination, the further the Mark is going to drive him from his own sanity. It probably won’t be long until he loses any of the feelings he’d ever had for Cas. Sam thinks he can overcome it, that there is a failsafe built into the spell, but Dean isn’t sure. If John really is dead, then that means Dean is going to inherit all of the Mark’s power and wrath. He needs Cas to be far away before that happens. Perhaps if they can cast the spell from a distance, Dean can go into the valley alone.
“Wow, even hotter in person,” Dean said with a wink. Castiel gaped like a fish.
After a few moments, the ache returned, so he pushed a second finger in alongside the second, and he started to edge toward relief.
“Yes.”
. Dean couldn’t remember the last person that had shown them as much kindness as Cas did that day. Probably Bobby. It was over a bowl of hot broth and good, rich bread in the Bunker’s kitchen, watching Cas move gracefully and efficiently through the room, that sixteen-year-old Dean fell in love.
“You’re so broken, now, like this. Does he know, you think? Can he see you crumple under my hand? You’re nothing more than an insect.”
It took three minutes to develop, which were always the longest three minutes of his life. Determined not to peek, he set the test down carefully on the edge of the tub and washed his hands. He programmed an alert on his phone, then packed away the rest of the tests.
Cas cleared his throat. “If you could just follow us into the interview room, Dean.”
“Yo, earth to Cassie!”
“Oh, dearie, I’m not so sure about that.” She takes another long, smooth drink. “Though, they have a knack for it, don’t they? Those Winchesters. Taming things that shouldn’t be tamed. They certainly wear on you.”
Dean snorts. “I was flirting with you, Cas,” he laughs, remembering the day well. Cas smiles.
The wedding reception was in full swing around them as Dean and Cas laughed, recalling the story of how they finally got together to the church’s newest head pastor, Jody, and her daughter Claire. Zachariah had quit in a huge huff when the church had announced they were going to perform same-sex marriages and welcome gay and lesbian pastors and leaders. It had been that change that brought Dean and Cas back to their home town after they graduated from college, and it was with great glee that they were married on a weekend three weeks before Christmas, almost eight years to the day they’d nearly burned it down.
Cas goes to get his coffee, and Dean settles down again. This is completely different than their first date already, and it’s not just Dean’s attitude. It’s almost like something has clicked into place this time, and Dean finds himself cautiously excited to see what happens next.
“Gabriel is quite fond of her. I always wondered if the two of them . . .”
“Whoa, calm down, buddy,” said the omega, concern marring his perfect features for a moment. A hand reached toward Cas, then snapped back as though shocked. “It ain’t—
. . .”
Sam’s face appeared.
No matter how long it had been since Castiel heard that voice, it still made his heart skip a beat. The longing that tugged at him hadn’t lessened by proximity; if anything, it was even stronger. Castiel rubbed a hand across his chest, knocking his tie askew, before he turned to face Dean.
A contract.
“Last night on Earth,” Castiel says against Dean’s lips, cupping Dean’s face with both hands. “Do you have plans?” Dean smirks.
“Yeah, it’s not a problem right now, but we’re gonna have to fix it before the semester starts. So, hey, I got you somethin’!”
“Fuck, alpha . . . shouldn’t be here . . .”
“Gabriel!”
“Do you wanna come in?” he asked, meeting Castiel’s gaze in a challenge. After being called, Castiel could not leave again until he was released by his charge, though he was not required to remain in the same location. Dean knew that Castiel was free to refuse.
“Extinguishing spell might be handy,” Bobby says before the map suddenly catches fire. Dean cries out, reaching for it, but Castiel grabs onto his shoulder on instinct to hold him back. Dean watches in shock as the map burns until suddenly the fire disappears, leaving behind a small scrap of the map, untouched.
“Forgive me if I’m highly skeptical.”
“Of course. We are neighbors, after all.”
A stranger looked back. His freckles stood out against his skin that looked almost creamier, somewhow; the peach undertones brought out by the peach of his sweater. His eyes were sharply green and sparkled beneath long lashes. The sweater was fitted enough to show off the definition of his shoulders, but also reveal how it nipped in at his narrow waist. He looked every inch a Vinehall Omega.
“That’s lucky. My brother, Sam, y’know? He’s all the way out in California. Man, I’d love to get to have lunch with him.”
one he’s been certain is ‘the one.’” She chuckled and shook her head, her lively hair wobbling with the movement. “Anyway, how are
“That bastard,” Dean hissed, white-hot rage starting to pump through his veins. He grabbed his coat and pushed past Kevin who tried to stop him at the door.
Dean belonged to Michael Milton.
been a disaster? What were you thinking, Castiel?”
“Oh, I don’t read. Not books, anyway. Y’know, omega’s place and all that,” Dean says matter-of-factly. Castiel’s squint becomes a scowl.
“Winchester,” Crowley drawled. “I think I distinctly recall advising you to be careful and to follow the rules, didn’t I?”
“No apologies needed,” he said.
Dean shrugged. “So we carry an epi-pen from here on out, no big deal.” Cas glared further. “I’ll make sure to be careful. Now come up here and cuddle me, dammit.”
Dean opens his mouth to ask, then realizes . . . “Uh, you don’t have to,” Dean says, holding out his arm and rolling up his sleeve. Cas winces away, but then Dean reveals his inner elbow and moves closer. “See? It’s gone.”
“Th-thank you,” managed Dean. Michael pulled away, and Dean felt a knot in his chest loosen.
Dean looks at him strangely for quite a long moment before he manages, “Sorry, Cas, I gotta go. Sam?”
had hurt one of his friends, his
A huge explosion emanated from the screen and Dean jumped, startling Cas from his nap.
“Knot me, alpha,” Dean breathed into Cas’s ear. “Knot me. Fill me.
“Gross, Dean, god, you’re gonna smother me back here,” Sam complained, cranking down a window. Dean bit his lip and willed his pheromones to clear of distress. Even as family, Bobby and Sam’s alphas would respond to it and none of them could afford to stress out right now.
All of the color drained from Castiel’s face and he had to work on his breathing again. Too many questions were spinning in his head, ones that he wouldn’t ever get an answer to. Besides, Dean was not his concern. Despite their few interactions, and the kiss . . . Dean was not, nor would he ever be, any responsibility of Castiel’s.
“What have you done with Dean?” he demands. She raises her eyebrows.
“As usual. Talk to you later.”
“Well, fraternizing with the other Novak is one thing. He’s your brother, after all. But all of the crap with Bradbury? Being at the scene when those deviants were arrested? Fucking
In all of their exploration, though, Cas had discovered something, a terribly guilty secret that he would take with him to the grave.
“So you’re Dean.”
Jack must have sensed the change in Dean’s mood, must have scented it even as Dean could not. “I—I apologize. I’ve been learning more about the world without my powers, and secondary genders, and I thought . . . you and Castiel . . . your scents . . .”
“You boys mind bringin’ that map over here?” Bobby says, voice tight.
“I’m nobody, Cas,” Dean continued. Cas shook his head.
Castiel squinted at the small box in the top left corner. “At least you didn’t lie about my age,” he conceded.
, and a chill runs down his spine.
“Don’t be such a stick-in-the-mud,” Balthazar said as he kissed both of his cheeks in farewell. “It doesn’t have to be true love, you know. Sometimes it’s better if it isn’t.”
“What?” Dean asks, laughing a little himself.
Castiel folds for the next two hands until he finally ends up with a pair of queens that lead to Dean losing his jeans. He expects a strip tease like before, but Dean simply shucks his pants without even moving so Castiel can see him. Castiel’s frustration must waft through the air to Dean, because the alpha grins like the cat that caught the canary.
“Cassie, pull up a chair and sit a spell,” Gabriel said, gesturing for Cas to join them.
If Adler knew, who else knew? How did he find out? Was there someone close to him, or to Dean? Would Dean be punished for this? Had he been already? Panic and bile rose in his throat as Cas recognized that Adler expected a response.
“Can’t bring the omega in,” the other guard said. “Leave him with the beta, and you can come in.”
“You miss him.”
“Alpha,” Dean whined. “N-need you, Alpha.”
“It is a free campus,” Castiel managed to reply. Dean was bundled against the cold in a dark blue wool pea coat and a sage green cashmere scarf, though Castiel thought he would look better wrapped in leather. Dean barked a laugh, a harsh, unnatural sound.
Cas’s cheeks were flaming red by the time Dean was finished, and Dean suddenly couldn’t find anything better to do than chug the rest of the wine in his goblet. The room was kind of spinny by the time he was done, but Cas was gazing at him with fire in his eyes, not just the kind reflected from the low-burnt candles.
And he smelled
“I don’t personally care, as long as it’s all gone by morning,” Cas said, swallowing another mouthful.
While Castiel hesitated, another message came through.
omega, I mean. He didn’t come from a wealthy family. His family name isn’t one I recognize.”
“Yeah, I do. He’s, uh . . . he’s kind of everything I’ve got.”
“Mom and Bobby were in the area, said there’s a basic salt-and-burn outside of Wichita. Thought we could take care of it.”
that wafts into the hallway.
He never received another email after the date he sabotaged, so Dean figures he’ll probably never see him again, anyway.
Cas did eventually manage to make it out of the door. Dean rode out another wave of cramps after Cas left, but he hadn’t felt any of the fever or
Another moment passed, but Dean didn’t move. “I’ll . . . see you around,” Castiel said.
Castiel smiled softly. “I am. You worry too much, my friend.”
Something tiny broke inside Dean, and he tore his own gaze away from Cas. Michael spun them in a circle, the crowd blurring together.
“Probably going to go see my mom. Been a while since I visited; with all the upgrades I’ve been working overtime and haven’t had the time to travel, you know?” Castiel nodded.
Sam didn’t look like he would let it go that easily, but mercifully he didn’t pursue it. “It’s good. Finals next week, then I’m going home for the break, I think. Will I see you for Christmas?”
“Love you, too, little alpha.”
didn’t . . .” He wipes a hand down his face, disbelief marring his features. “I know none of this makes any sense right now, and I wish I could tell you, but Castiel, you have to go with Dean.”
