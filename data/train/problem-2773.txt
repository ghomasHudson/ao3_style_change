“Cross my heart, I won’t tell. Still, I gotta ask, you got a budget for this? It can get pretty pricey,”
“I think you’re right,”
She groaned and rolled her eyes.
Castiel gave himself two minutes.
The ring box in his hand weighed a thousand pounds. Somehow, his heart weighed even more.
He liked Ellen. She was easy to talk to. He never had to pretend to be something he wasn’t, never had to pretend to understand the finer points of conversation. She wasn’t a metaphorical speaker. She said what she meant, and she meant every word of what she said. It made conversations with her so much easier. Not to mention, she had a poker face to rival his own, and didn’t get offended when he was stone-faced during their conversations.
Cas nodded again.
“He’s been busy all day. No cell service,” His voice sounded tinny, even to himself. Ellen would see right through the lie.
When Dean sat down next to Cas again, he was very careful to sit as far away as he could and placed the coffee-milkshake drink on the table in front of him instead of handing it directly to him.
“Alright, Barbie, enough. Cas is here for Jimmy’s car. Walk him through all the repairs,”
He squeezed his eyes shut. He didn’t want to think about this right now.
The walk to the diner was short, just like the walk to anywhere in Lawrence, and before he knew it, Dean was staring back at his own reflection in the glass door.
Castiel shook his head.
Claire didn’t rise to the barbs in his voice. Instead, she rolled her eyes and began picking at her already-chipped-to-hell nail polish.
“Dude, I can’t leave you alone out here,”
read it.
“I’m okay, thank you,” Castiel didn’t even try to disguise the fact that his voice was completely devoid of emotion. He knew Dean wouldn’t take offense.
Castiel shrugged, fear and amusement warring for dominance in his body. He wasn’t quite sure whether to be scared of her, or to laugh at her antics.
Castiel didn’t respond, just watched the clouds in his brother’s face shift and warp.
He’d certainly offered a pillow when Castiel had needed it. He was lucky Dean had been there. If his headache was anything to go by, Castiel probably would’ve end up with a concussion if it weren’t for the assistance.
“Is that Cas’ new book?”
He sighed, but Cas spoke before Jimmy could.
Castiel pointed at a mirror, and she looked into it, a guttural shout tearing out of her mouth.
Castiel focused on his fingernails. There was a particularly nasty hangnail that he’d been worrying at all day, and it suddenly seemed incredibly interesting. More interesting than discussing a break up that had happened almost a decade ago.
Dean suppressed a sigh. He wasn’t sure why he ever bothered trying. It’s not like he and Cas would ever be friends again. Hell, he wasn’t even sure if that was something he wanted, let alone whether or not it was something Cas wanted. Honestly, he really wasn’t sure what his goal here was.
Dean huffed, frustrated with his own anxiety. Jimmy wasn’t an icicle. He wasn’t a piece of trash caught in the branches of the felled log. He wasn’t a rotten fish carcass that would surface in a few days. He was on a business trip, and he’d be home soon.
Jimmy stared at him for as long as he could get away with it before turning back to the road with a sigh. His bright blue eyes sagged, a hint of exhaustion that he’d only allow Castiel to see. Jimmy didn’t like to appear weak.
“Personally,” Castiel began, voice quiet, “I’d take anything sudden. Something where I don’t know I’m dying until I’m dead,” He remembered what it was like to expect death. He didn’t want to ever experience that again. He rubbed at the graft scars on his wrist.
Castiel clarified, “Fine, you’re starting to sound like Dad when he was punishing
“Naw, I teleported. Course I walked here, Bobby. You think I’d be able to get Baby to start up when it’s this fuckin’ cold outside?”
Castiel stared at the bird poop again, wishing that something would happen to derail this conversation. Anything. A car accident, a phone call, any sign that there was a god listening in on Castiel’s suffering and was willing to lend a helping hand.
“Meeting some friends at the movies,”
“Claire,” Jimmy’s voice was a stark warning, trailing off as he stared at the grave in front of them.
His heart rate tripled as he surveyed the water, eyes alert for any sign of Jimmy.
He hoped Cas would take the news okay.
He grimaced. Short of walking home for a quick shower, it looked like the towel was his only option.
Castiel pushed down the wave of anxiety that rose in his gut.
Castiel shot his brother a glare as soon as he hit END CALL.
“So,” Castiel mirrored.
Dean froze.
Fuck, why was he so stuck on this now?
The drive home from the mechanic shop was significantly more stressful than time behind the wheel normally was for Castiel. Maybe it was leftover nerves from his chat with Dean, maybe it was anxiety about Jimmy, maybe a combination of both. Whatever it was, though, it was compounding itself into something way worse. The sunlight glinting off the snow was bright, stabbing his eyes. The sound of the engine was a humming buzz in his ears. He almost didn’t consciously recognize the oil light flickering on, the red dot barely registering against the humming in his brain.
“You can keep looking in there, you know. I don’t mind,”
Castiel turned off his author brain.
The walk to the diner was uneventful, if colder than usual. He wondered where this cold snap was coming from. Sure, Kansas was usually cold in the winter but, damn, this was bad even by Midwest standards. The wind whipped through his thick coat, piercing through the scarf wrapped around his nose, tickling his scalp through his hat. He shivered.
Closure was something you tried to get when you knew there was no chance of getting anything else. At least, that’s what Castiel thought closure was supposed to be.
He generally found it difficult to go a long period of time without thinking about Cas. On a good day, he could make it a few hours. On a bad one, it was every waking minute. The most innocuous things would remind him of the goofy kid he would play tag with while growing up, or the gangly the teenager he had crushed on for years.
“I didn’t know you were coming,”
“When’s the last time you heard from Jimmy, Cas?”
Dean hoped Cas’ coffee opinions hadn’t changed too much since he’d last bought him a drink.
“I don’t like it either,” Dean’s face was grim, “Have you tried calling him today?”
Charlie rolled her eyes, and waved Dean away with a hand.
“Call me next time. Don’t walk. This ain’t LA. You’ll get frostbite in that coat,”
“It’s me, Claire,” Castiel’s voice was raw as he forced out the words, “It’s me,”
“Well, I’m sure he’ll turn up. Isn’t there supposed to be a parade committee meeting again tonight?”
“Well, this was fun. I’ve, uh, gotta go now, but thanks for the chat,” He paused, ever so slightly, “Talk to ya later, Cas,”
You had to get pretty accurate about your aim when the man catching was a stubborn old codger who refused to wheel around an empty field to shag your overthrows.
“Goin’ somewhere?” Dean asked, eyes on Eileen and making sure she could see his lips.
“Not much,” She shook her head, “Just that he was missing, and you were the last one to see him. That’s it, I swear. I thought he was just being paranoid,”
Castiel was just starting to return to himself when the knock sounded on the door.
“You know, the whole ‘wistful joy’ thing or whatever,”
“You need help with floats again?” Dammit, why was his voice so shaky. It’s not like he was talking to Cas. Just around him.
“So, if you could choose any way to die, how would you do it?”
Cas’ head snapped up, searching for the source of the intrusion. Dean scrambled to turn his phone off.
“Listen, Jody, I – “
Castiel opted instead to rifle through Dean’s glove compartment.
“Okay, one, gross,” Sam’s pulled a face, “Two, that’s a dick move,”
“Okay, so then let’s build up to it. We can walk this side of the river for as long as you need and when you’re ready, we’ll wade in as far as we can,”
Jimmy had been the golden child to Castiel’s scapegoat. In their parents’ eyes, Jimmy was the outspoken one, the extrovert with the world at his fingertips. Castiel was the hindrance to their perfect life, the flaw in what could’ve been flawless. Castiel had often compared himself to Hephaestus, the son of Zeus just waiting to be thrown from Mount Olympus.
It was ridiculous, really. Dean had thought he’d done everything right. He’d bought champagne, planned a whole date night, and set up a party at the Roadhouse to celebrate afterwards. He’d scrounged for weeks to be able to afford a nice ring. Platinum. Expensive.
“Do you want me to take a look at the frame? Make sure the thing wasn’t fucked up in the accident?”
“And,” Jimmy pressed on, “that if you didn’t do that, it would be a waste of both money and fireworks, since you didn’t get the full experience,”
Sure, he got better about recognizing the signs earlier on and was able to circumvent them more often than he had been able to as a child. Sure, living alone in the city meant he had a controlled environment where he could manage triggers and keep emotional interactions to a minimum. Sure, he had structured his personal life around not needing to be in an office everyday thereby avoiding the need to interact with people regularly.
Even if she was an asshole about it, Claire was right. Hell, maybe she was right because she was willing to be an asshole about it. Whatever.
“Do you need a ride home?”
Castiel’s heart stopped in his chest.
Biting his lip and hoping the pillow would be enough for a few minutes, he returned to the fireplace, making quick work out of starting the fire. Soon, the sound of burning wood punctuated Cas’ tears and the heavy thwump, thwump thwump of his head against the pillow.
“I’d rather be a dick than a murderer,”
Castiel trained his eyes on a speck of bird poop on the windshield, a solid fixed point that was more pleasant to look at than his brother right now.
She scoffed.
He took a sip of his coffee. It was still warm.
He hadn’t screamed. Not at first.
He loved the faded yellow paint, and the way it seemed to blend into the yellow winter grass when the light was just right. He loved how he could walk along the length of his property line and never run into another living soul. He loved how the Kansas River bent and snaked across his land, and the way the willowy trees lined its banks.
It wasn’t like Castiel had wanted to hurt himself. It was an impulse, a need. He had to hurt himself. It was the only way to calm the screaming in his mind. The only thing that quelled the image of Jimmy under the water…
As the last of the stars faded, Castiel made a decision. He’d wait until seven. Jody would be at the sheriff’s office by then, and he could call her, and she’d talk some sense into him.
“Claire, you can’t do that,”
“Yes,”
All of those sureties were thrown out the window when he visited his hometown, though.
Jimmy’s hand came down softly over his own, gently peeling Castiel’s fingers away before placing his own hand on the wheel.
He looked good, despite the shapelessness of his clothes. Hell, maybe Dean was far gone enough on the man that the shapeless clothes
Jimmy glowered.
Dean led Cas back into the shop and grabbed the keys from the rack hanging by the door, deftly handing them to Cas.
He regretted his selfish generosity the moment he got to the bar.
Business trip. Kansas City. Castiel repeated in his mind. They were just being overly cautious with a search party. That was all. If Jimmy was alive and in the city, this whole thing would just be a funny story someday. A ha, remember when that happened story.
“I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to upset you,” His voice sounded sincere, and Castiel was pretty sure the lifted eyebrows and wide eyes signaled contriteness.
When he returned to the front room, clothes in hand, Cas had quieted down. Now, instead of loudly wailing, he was just sitting there quietly, resting his head against the pillow with tears streaming down his face. He was angled towards the fire, but he wasn’t looking at it. His gaze was a million miles away.
Dean seemed to be teetering on the edge of saying something, the words poised at the tip of his tongue.
“Heya Dean, how ya doin’?”
Dean smiled, but it didn’t reach his eyes. Castiel took a sip of his drink.
“It’s pretty cold outside. How’s Bobby doing?” Jody’s voice was polite and disinterested, mostly just making conversation for the sake of talking. Everyone knew Bobby was always worse when it got cold.
It wasn’t a far drive to the coffee shop, just a few turns and a stop sign away. Castiel sighed as he parked the car, shoving thoughts of Dean and kissing into a box in the back of his mind.
“Since when?”
A young man proposes to the love of his life, only to be rejected. It was a depressing story to tell, one his publishers had balked at when he’d first submitted it. Honestly, he was pretty sure that if it weren’t for his previously established reputation for storytelling, the
Dean laughed.
He spent a good five minutes fantasizing about what it would be like to have Cas sit across from him in one of those boats. How the wind would blow his dark hair around, and the fireworks would flash against his blue eyes. He’d probably bring that stupid overcoat, and it wouldn’t be enough to combat the cold draft blasting off the water, so Dean would have to lend him a jacket or a scarf. He’d lean in as he offered it and plant a kiss right between Cas’ eyebrows on the spot where they crinkled together whenever he made that stupid face Dean loved so much.
He cleared his throat.
“Yeah,”
Jimmy’s answering smile was timid, happiness tinged with nervousness. Castiel figured his brother felt compelled to walk on eggshells. That was usually how people responded to episodes like he had displayed earlier.
The service bell in the office rang.
He didn’t realize how long he had been staring until his phone’s alarm went off, signaling time to head back to Bobby’s. The ringtone was sharp, jarring against the otherwise serene ambiance of the park.
“Tomorrow morning, most likely,”
She answered it quickly.
Jimmy was good about not judging Castiel for stimming. He didn’t really understand it, not in the way that other neurodivergent people did, but he didn’t make fun of Castiel in the way everyone else did. The whispers had followed him his whole life.
“In the flesh,”
“I gotta get dried off. Let’s go inside, okay?”
The book in Dean’s hands was on the thinner side, thinner than the last one Cas had written. It was slim, with a dark green hard cover and silver detailing running down the front in patterns reminiscent of vines. Kinda girly, but whatever. Dean ran his hands across the title, feeling the indentations under his fingertips.
Still, even in the wake of his wife’s death, Jimmy hadn’t done anything like this. He hadn’t disappeared without a trace for over twenty-four hours. Hell, Castiel could barely remember a time where Jimmy hadn’t gone more than twenty minutes without announcing his presence to the entire world, a habit that had only compounded when he’d gotten access to social media.
Dean put the car in reverse as Castiel did what he was told. Inside the glove compartment, there was a polished worry stone.
“No,”
Cas frowned deeper.
“I know what I said,”
“Alright, I’m gonna skip on the ASL lessons for now,” Dean griped. He knew he was far behind where he should be in his studying, and he didn’t want to be made to feel guilty about it while he was in the middle of bitching about something else. He’d have Eileen teach him some new vocab later, when he was less irritable.
He pressed hard against his eyes with the palm of his hands.
“Look, man, we can meet back out here again tomorrow morning, I swear. But you gotta put on better shoes,”
Claire’s smile widened at his teasing.
Dean didn’t need to ask. Bobby’s wife, Ellen, had the parade meeting schedule posted on the same board as the daily work schedule. It was a subtle attempt by Dean’s pseudo-mother to guilt him into attending. Like clockwork, it showed up every year, and every year Dean avoided going to the meetings like his life depended on it.
“No,” She said as she tapped. Sam repeated the motion.
Where the hell was he?
series right under his nose,” She huffed a sigh, “Besides, it’s kinda pathetic to see you sitting here like this. You could just talk to him, you know? It’s been years; you’d think one of you would’ve cracked by now,”
Jimmy nodded, before saying, “Yeah, that’s a good idea. I’ll see you tomorrow morning,”
Castiel watched as Dean rushed off. He wasn’t quite sure why Dean felt the need to rush away like that. He should’ve taken his time to carefully pack his things away before leaving. It would’ve meant he was less likely to misplace any of his belongings. That would’ve been the logical thing, at least.
“Cas,”
“That’s awesome, dude. Listen,” he winced at how over-the-top fake happy he sounded before segueing into the whole reason for his call, “I got you marked down for a new suspension here, but I see that Bobby didn’t go over anything beyond ‘give me a new suspension, please’ and I wanted to touch base with you on that,”
Claire hopped up, light and spry in a way Dean didn’t think should be physically possible in a pair of Doc Martens.
Dean’s heart stopped in his chest.
Before Dean could respond though, Claire interrupted him with an excited shout.
“You know,” Sam started, voice hesitant, “If you don’t make them, he’s probably just gonna find someone else,”
Castiel didn’t want to consider the possibility.
It looked like today was going to be one of those days.
As everyone was standing up, and Dean made to join them, Cas caught him by the wrist, dragging Dean’s attention to him.
Jimmy was fine.
He tried his best to sell the bluff. In all honesty, he was pretty sure most mechanics in the area wouldn’t bat an eye at the request, especially with the amount of cash they could make off of it.
Jimmy gaped at her.
That was how he used to deal with his parents when they were at their worst. He’d turn off his emotions. He’d stare blankly ahead of him. He’d breathe.
She hung up before Castiel could say goodbye.
“I was wondering if I could run some ideas by you, and – if you’ve got time, and you like the ideas – we could meet up today to discuss the details in person?”
“Stop making a mess!”
A voice interrupted her, nasally and anxious.
He really was. Dean could hear it in his voice.
“It’s not exactly easy to get past what happened, Claire,”
“I’m being metaphorical, Cas,”
And he’d survive.
characters to you. You listen to them, analyze them, and then write them down in your little books. Don’t think I’ve forgotten about Dean and Jensen,”
He regretted the joke as soon as he said it. The silence returned, as heavy as it had been before.
“When Claire was little,” He started, his voice a million miles away, “Amelia and I used to take her out on the water in these little paddleboats. Nothing fancy, just dumb little things that Claire loved to push around,”
Castiel was sure Dean could hear his pounding heart from across town.
“Sorry,” Sam was sheepish, “I’m just trying to be prepared,”
Cas pursed his lips.
Because of the lack of public space, the park was almost never empty, despite it’s proximity to one of the few other public spaces in the town – the cemetery.
Dean was standing next to Jody on the gazebo’s raised platform. He was arranging various supplies and handing out packs to the various searchers, flashlights and packs of handwarmers. He stopped to look at Castiel before apparently deciding for the both of them.
Dean sat down next to Cas on the couch.
The lifelessness in Cas’ normally sharp eyes was concerning, to say the least. His jaw was loose, not quite hanging, but enough that Dean could see his mouth parted. That wasn’t the worst part, though. Every bit of him seemed to sag, as if the only thing holding him up right now was Dean’s arm around his shoulders.
Or improper installation.
He winced as the thought brought up Jody’s comment from earlier.
Dean knew damn well why his brother couldn’t step in for Eileen. His final year of law school, finals, wife who was eight months pregnant and could pop at any moment. Of course, Sam couldn’t step in.
Castiel couldn’t fault him for it, though. If he’d heard the gossip correctly, Chuck had up close experience with being swept away, and it was only fair for him to know better than anyone what had probably happened.
She scoffed.
“I’ll let Jimmy know,”
It’s not that he was strapped for cash. In fact, it was rather the opposite. He had gotten rather lucky with his writing. It wasn’t everyday that an author published a best-seller. It was even less common for an author to have several best-selling novels that afforded them the luxury to work on their stories full-time. Castiel was even rarer than that. He had more money than he could use in a single lifetime.
“Now boarding flight eight-zero-five-three for Kansas City at gate twenty-two,” the soft, mechanical sounding voice said over Castiel’s head.
“No! My
Ellen Singer was something else, to say the least. Stronger than half the men in town, and smarter than all of them, she was a whiz at business and interpersonal problems. Between her and Bobby, their two businesses made up a large chunk of the non-college-town related income generated for the town. Ellen herself was effectively the town’s matriarch, and she showed it by taking on as many public projects as she could get her hand on, including the parade.
“I already asked, he’s unavailable,”
He’d thrown the medal in the trashcan along with his uniform and a lit match.
What he did not like, however, was the physics of the river bend.
He breathed a sigh of relief. They were almost to the tip of the tree now, just a few more feet, and he’d prove to himself once and for all that there was nothing out here. Jimmy wasn’t missing.
As it stood, he was currently sitting in his
“I can’t compromise with stupid,”
He looked at Castiel. Castiel resolutely did not look at him. There was a tense set to his jaw, a muscle locked in place that ticked every time he swallowed.
It never really got easier, having a meltdown.
Shoving the remainder of his lunch back into his bag, he scurried off, desperate to get away from Cas.
The cold only served to make him nervous, though, unlike the annoyance it would normally invoke. His mind kept rotating around Jimmy. Was he lost somewhere down the river, an icicle wearing a nice watch?
Dean rolled his eyes.
He was wearing it now, actually, layered under his trenchcoat. It was one of the few pieces of cold weather clothing he owned, despite being borderline threadbare. There was a patch on the cuff from his feeble attempts to fix a hole that had formed years before, and he didn’t have it in his heart to take it to a tailor. He didn’t want to risk them messing it up. It meant to much to him.
He glanced at Cas.
“He wasn’t wearing the best shoes for walking along a muddy riverbank,”
The thought sobered him slightly. Fuck, if something had happened to Jimmy, what would happen to Claire.
“Hey,” Dean started, voice tense, “Does Claire know Jimmy’s AWOL?”
He was dressed and ready to go in under 10 minutes, warm layers retrieved from the floor in his front entrance where he’d left them the night before and his good boots laced and ready to go.
In the background, Dean heard Jimmy’s hazards flip on, a
“Maybe you should stay up on the pier… I can check the water,” Dean offered.
“Yeah, well, I figured I might as well make sure that you got a good mechanic, since you seem so damned determined to get these fuckin’ boats made,”
As always, thank you for reading, and I really appreciate your comments!
“Dude, have you met your brother?” Shit, that was rude, “I just mean – “
Time was up.
Time to go in.
Jimmy cleared his throat. When Castiel met his eyes, his brother cocked an eyebrow before gesturing to the graves in front of them. Claire and Jimmy had already laid their flowers down in front of the headstones, they were just waiting on Castiel to add his to the mix.
He sighed, eyes falling back to the book in his hands. He’d never actually bought one of Cas’ books. The man had released almost six of them in the time since they’d last spoken, and he hadn’t bought a single one. Man, he was a shitty friend. Ex-boyfriend. Whatever.
“Don’t do that,” Castiel ground out, eyes focused on the road and left hand fixed steadily on the two o’clock position on the steering wheel.
When Cas had been younger, he’d generally been pretty okay with dealing with the discomfort clothing caused him. He’d had to be, with the way his parents dressed him. Hell, even now it seemed like he was generally able to wear uncomfortable clothing without a problem, judging by the weird trench coat he had been wearing the other day. Still, there was no point in risking giving Cas something with a tag or a pair of briefs that would pull on his leg hair. He was already in meltdown-mode, now it was mitigation time.
He pinched his arm.
Castiel still had nightmares about the way they treated him as an openly gay, autistic teenager. It hadn’t ended well.
He traced the border of his river, cursing when his eyes landed on the felled tree leaning into the water.
The stranger Jimmy was talking to came into view.
Dean released a jittery breath.
“Ya comin’?”
“Kinky,” He waggled his eyebrows at her.
“Okay fine, let me rephrase,” Jimmy steepled his hands together, resting his elbows on his knees and leaning forward, “What do you think the town would think of a fireworks show?”
“I wouldn’t have to lecture you if you’d just act your age,”
They were quiet for several minutes as Ellen continued talking, something about the process for awarding a festival booth to the applicants. The gnawing in Dean’s gut wouldn’t go away.
“You dedicated
“Okay, let’s get you out of those waders, then,”
Dean knew better than to pity him, though. Looks aside, Bobby’s disability was deceiving. He was whip smart when it came to business, mean as shit when he didn’t like someone, and a damn good influence to have around while growing up. The wheelchair hadn’t stopped him from teaching Dean how to toss a baseball back and forth better than almost any other kid on his high school team.
Claire’s text had really thrown him off kilter.
“Since when is lecturing my daughter the same thing as how Mom and Dad treated you?”
He heaved a sigh, running a finger down the book’s spine.
“Cas?” He didn’t look at Cas’ face to see if he’d heard him, he just kept talking, “Remember when we were kids and you couldn’t speak?”
Chuck hadn’t been within a mile of the river since.
“Look, man, all I’m saying is, it can’t be that bad of an idea,”
This was a bad fucking idea.
“Hey Jimmy, it’s Dean,”
“Claire Novak!”
At five, he broke that promise and dialed Jody’s personal number.
Jody huffed.
“The Christmas parade is coming up. I was hoping you would be okay with helping out again this year?”
His own mother was buried there, right next to Dean’s old man.
“No, you’re saying it’s
“That’s good, I was worried about him,” Jody said before turning to order her food. When she finished, Dean stepped forward and ordered for him and Bobby, plunking cash down on the counter for Krissy to count.
“Claire and I were gonna visit their graves today. Would you like to join?”
He remembered the sound of glass crunching, and the way his neck had snapped forward when the impact had hit. His arm had been trapped when the car’s frame had given way, pinned at a strange angle that left his nerve tingling and his hand numb.
Castiel wasn’t sure if it was a rhetorical question. He kept his eyes trained on the side of Jimmy’s face.
If Cas were anyone else, this would be the worst set of clothes to offer them. Threadbare, pockmarked with holes and old oil stains, the logos barely visible. But Dean knew Cas would appreciate them for what they were: soft, comfortable, and most importantly, not likely to overstimulate him.
He shrugged.
Trigger warnings for character death, self-harm, and interactions with a dead body. Also, Cas does have an autistic meltdown in this chapter. I will remind you that I am autistic and am basing this meltdown on ones I have had in the past. As I’ve mentioned before, I really will not appreciate comments regarding my portrayal of autism from NT ppl, as my intention is to share my personal experiences, not to represent some universal archetype of what you think autism looks like.
“Oh my God, would you just shut up and let me pack? I don’t need you to lecture me over every little thing I do,”
That memory was one that he kept buried in a box in the back of his brain, and yet, it seemed determined to make itself the primary thought in Castiel’s brain.
“Yesterday, while Claire was packing,”
“What’d he say?”
“Um, yeah. Hey. Hi,” Dean’s voice was awkward, pitched up significantly higher than usual. Castiel frowned.
Maybe Castiel needed Jimmy, but Jimmy didn’t need him.
There was no point.
Cas saved him again.
Goddamn, the man had a voice on him. Low and rough, it was all worn leather and gravel and a number of other things Dean couldn’t think of when his head was spinning like it was at that very moment.
“I’ll deal with it. Clean yourself up, why don’t ya?”
When the phone call ended, he stared at the glove in his hand for a moment before slipping it on and returning to picking up trash, spearing an advertisement for men’s work suits and shoving it into his waste bag.
One long squeeze of his hand.
Fuck.
“I agree,”
The drive to Dean’s house went by quickly, and in less than no time, they were standing on Dean’s front step as he fumbled with his keys to let them inside. The waders were in the spare closet by the front door.
As soon as the phone call ended, Dean dropped his head to the desk and let out a loud groan.
Not until the gas tank caught fire.
“I have no idea what you’re talking about,”
His thoughts were spinning in their tracks, burying themselves in the mud in his brain.
He and Dean’s dad, John, had served in the Marines together decades before. They’d been best friends, buddies at arms, the perfect duo, and the only ones the other could trust.
Castiel interrupted him.
“No,” He signed alongside his speech, tapping his index finger against his thumb, “I wouldn’t,”
“Uh, sorry,” He stammered, “You had whipped cream on your… I just… Sorry,” He finished lamely.
“Just like Dad,”
He tried not to think about the only person whose touch felt like nothing more than an extension of his own body. A natural meld that did nothing to upset his senses.
Castiel considered his words.
“Can the two of you stop flirting? I need to get home
“Hey, hey, hey, don’t do that,” Dean tried to soothe. Cas didn’t listen. He slammed his head against the wall again. The crack felt like it ricocheted through the entire house, punctuated by Cas’ wails.
Dean rubbed his eyes to clear the unhappy thoughts away.
In the distance, he saw Cas’ frame disappear into the crowd, snowflakes swirling in his wake.
She wanted to be a writer someday, just like her uncle Cas. Not that she’d ever admit that to anyone. She was much too scared of being vulnerable enough to admit it.
Castiel spent the morning puttering around the house, his earlier conversation with Jody ringing in his ears on repeat.
That was, until
“A strong, handsome shoulder to cry on,”
Jimmy made more than enough money at his job, and he refused to let Castiel give him any financial support. Not even for Claire.
“Yeah, I’ll be there. Can you text me the details?”
It also had to be why he couldn’t get his mind off of Dean.
He scrunched his eyes shut. He didn’t want to listen to Dean and Jody’s hushed conversation. Hell, he’d done a good job of not noticing that Dean had even let Jody in in the first place.
There it was. The little hint of a smile.
There was a counter for them to order from, and a high school student was standing there waiting for them. Dean was pretty sure her name was Krissy. Wasn’t she one of Claire’s friends?
The irritation and anger from yesterday had all but vanished, leaving Jimmy a completely different person. Dean was glad to see it. He hadn’t liked the side of Jimmy that had come out at the coffee shop, and he hoped he wouldn’t see it again any time soon.
Dean wasn’t sure how to break the silence. The tension in his body felt ready to snap, a frayed thread supporting his entire weight.
Without warning, an image of Cas flashed through his mind. Cas, anxious and worried and scared, worrying away at the stone in his hand, looking to Dean for support. For help. For reassurance.
Dean guffawed.
Castiel didn’t blame Dean for wanting to get away from Jimmy. He did blame Dean for making the walk to the car awkward.
Sometimes, Dean could really see the family resemblance between Jimmy and Cas. They were both stubborn as all hell, for one thing.
Honestly, if it weren’t for the two of them, neither Dean nor Charlie would’ve ever had the guts to come out. Hell, if it weren’t for them, Cas’ parents would’ve killed him when they stumbled in on him and Dean kissing. The moment Dean had seen the murderous glint in Michael Novak’s eyes, Dean had dialed Jody and begged her to intervene. Because of her, Cas had lived to see another day.
“Please,” Dean whispered. If he was about to uncover Jimmy’s body, he didn’t want Cas there to see it. His eyes landed on Cas’, wide and pleading, and his heart broke in his chest. The desperate look on Cas’ face was devastating, raw and vulnerable in the way only Cas knew how to be.
Jimmy shot him a devious smile.
“Doin’ good, how ‘bout yourself?” Dean tried his best to stay relaxed. Jimmy and Cas didn’t share many traits, despite their close relation. While Jimmy’s voice was much livelier than Cas’ was, the timbre was still the same. It was one of the few similarities outside of their looks that they both had, and it always sent a gut punch rocking through his body when he heard it.
Jimmy had been missing for less than forty-eight hours, if Dean’s math was correct. If he really had been the last person to see him. He was an adult man who was used to not having to tell anyone where he was going or when he had things to do in the city.
“How much did Cas tell you?”
Castiel wasn’t sure. If he were being honest, he’d admit that he didn’t want closure. He wanted Dean. He wanted this yearly cycle, because it was the only part of Dean that he was convinced he’d be able to get.
“You can’t just play with people’s lives like that. It’s mean. I’m a person. Dean’s a person. We need to be treated like people,”
“I’ve got an order for a broccoli cheddar, and another order for a chicken soup, chicken salad, and a tomato rice soup,” Krissy announced to the almost empty diner.
Dean exhaled slowly, blowing out the breath he’d been holding since Cas had reached for his hand.
Dean stayed quiet, though. As if he were content to just keep his eyes on the road.
“NOVAK, 2007 PRIUS, SUSPENSION REPLACEMENT” was first on the docket, written neatly in Bobby’s ex-military handwriting.
Sometimes, he was convinced that he was the only one who found the date worth adhering to.
Dean knew there was nothing he could do to stop what was happening, only mitigate the resulting damages. He also knew he needed to get out of his frozen clothes. His teeth were chattering, and his hands were shaking.
She cooed.
Castiel picked at the hangnail, finally freeing it. A stripe of blood appeared against his cuticle. He pressed the thumb from his other hand against it to staunch the flow.
who needs plot twists when you can just hit your readers over the head with a mallet I like to call "foreshadowing"?
He bounced it in the palm of his hand, rubbing his thumb over the smooth indent in its surface. Years later, and it was still a perfect fit. Experimentally, he rubbed a thumb up the indent before deftly spinning it between his thumb and forefinger, before sliding his thumb back down.
Despite all that, the book was still about Dean, for Dean.
That wasn’t right. They weren’t supposed to visit until the fourteenth. They always went on the fourteenth. Castiel scrunched his nose, brow furrowing.
Still, it didn’t stop him from his new-book-release ritual.
“Is that why you had me come pick you up?”
“Is it in the parking lot?”
“So,” Dean started. His voice was quiet, as if he were scared to upset Castiel.
Life wasn’t a storybook, despite how much he wished it was.
He left with a wave, and the churning feeling in his gut that he was making a mistake.
It had fallen a few weeks before, and he hadn’t felt safe hiring anyone to come and pull it out of the river. Now, it lay halfway out across the water, catching bits of debris and trash in its dead branches. It had been a royal pain in his ass since it had landed with a crash while he’d been walking nearby.
Jimmy’s lockscreen was an old photo of him and Claire. She was about four years old, gap-toothed and grinning below a neon pink bucket hat. Jimmy was holding her on his hip smiling.
Normally, it felt a bit like a superpower, as if he had traded communication abilities for the ability to think about the world the way he did. It made him feel strong, like he could think his way through any situation. He absorbed knowledge like a sponge, becoming smarter with each passing day. Information came easily to him, and he could connect the dots between two seemingly unrelated items with ease. He was a good writer because of that very skill.
He was concerned about the slip and slide of the silt and river rocks underneath their feet.
“Whatever,” Her voice was cold.
“No, ma’am,” Cas said, equally as penitent.
“That’s fine but stop making a fucking mess!”
“I’m sorry you’re goin’ through this, bud. It can’t be easy,”
It took him almost a full hour to calm down enough to speak again. By that time, Claire had returned, stomping into the house with her heavy combat boots. The sound of footsteps didn’t set Castiel off like it had earlier in the day, and he took that as a sign that maybe the worst of his overstimulation bout was over.
Maybe if Dean repeated it enough times, he’d eventually believe it.
“Yeah, I know how to fuckin’ read, asshole,”
Castiel knew there was no point in asking Claire why she couldn’t just walk home, even though the coffee shop was less than a mile from the house. His niece was stubborn enough that when she decided that she wanted something done her way, doing it any other way would be a personal affront. Besides, he trusted her enough to assume she had her reasons for being picked up. Maybe Jimmy wouldn’t let her leave without an excuse?
Dean looked up.
Jimmy’s eyes grew even more distant, cloudy and exhausted.
Dean dropped the logs in his hands, figuring he could deal with a little hypothermia if it meant preventing Cas from getting brain damage.
“Sammy, would you let Eileen get on one of those death traps?”
In his life, the only person he’d met who understood his need to stim, who truly got it, was Dean. Castiel had long suspected that Dean had undiagnosed ADHD. He certainly fit the bill. Couldn’t follow directions to save his life, had a temper meaner than a firecracker, impulsive as all hell, and the list went on. On the other hand, he was smart as a whip, good at making decisions on the fly, and great at coming up with off-the-wall ideas. So yeah, probably neurodivergent as well.
Claire’s face flashed across the screen, a newer photo of her showing off her new nose piercing. Her nose was scrunched, eyes wide in a comical pose.
“However,” Cas interrupted Dean’s spiraling, “If Dean has said no to your request, I’m sure he has a good reason,”
The fireworks exploded against his fingertips, trailing all the way up his arm. His dizzy brain locked onto the sight of their hands clasped together, and he smiled when he saw the bandaid on Cas’ thumb. The bumblebee design suited him.
A pang of worry settled deep in Dean’s gut. He remembered seeing how Jimmy had been slipping in the mud of the riverbank, his impractical business shoes a hazard to his safety. The stupid fucker hadn’t gone back down to the water line after Dean had left, right? He couldn’t possible have been that idiotic…
“It is not,” Jimmy formal inflection reminded Dean that, despite the differences, Jimmy and Cas were still technically twins.
Maybe it was the airport. The storm cell floating over most of the Midwest had delayed his plane for hours on end, leaving him stranded at the airport bar, waiting for the intercom to announce his flight was ready again. He swirled his drink in his glass, a strange mix of whiskey and some unidentified sweet mixer. He’d just pointed to the first thing on the menu when he’d sat down, hoping to limit contact with the bartender as much as possible.
“Cas!”
Dean wiped his hands on his coveralls, dirtying the last few clean spots.
“Actually,” Dean’s voice was just as uncomfortable as Castiel felt, “It’s gotta be picked up today. Bobby needs the space for another job as soon as possible. Can you let him know that it’s gotta be out by noon at the latest?”
Jimmy’s eyes widened to the size of some of the memorial plaques lining the ground.
He drained the rest of his coffee, a desperate attempt to warm his chilled soul.
Maybe that was why he was so concerned. Maybe Jody was right. Jimmy probably had just forgotten to tell Castiel about a business trip he had, or something like that.
He heard Cas turn to look at him.
Castiel, on the other hand, hated sparks. He hated the feeling of fireworks buzzing under his skin. Maybe the people who liked them only did so because they experienced it so rarely. Not Castiel. He experienced it ever damn time someone touched him.
He jerked his head back, flexing the fingers of his scarred hand. Rocking forward onto the balls of his feet, he counted the flowers. It was easier than thinking about traumas long past.
She harrumphed.
Fuck.
“Hey, Dean, I’ve got you on speaker. My brother’s here with us. Before you go, I wanted to ask you about something?”
He surveyed the river one more time, scanning it for anything unusual. The snow around the edges gave him almost as much anxiety as the felled tree. If Jimmy hadn’t been bludgeoned to death on the floor of the river or drowned in a tangled lump underneath the tree, then the hypothermia would’ve taken him in no time at all.
Everything was too much.
One. Two. Three.
No. Dean stopped the thought in its tracks. Jimmy was fine. He was safe and on a business trip. He would be home in a few days. Dean didn’t need to worry about him, because he wasn’t dead.
“Great, we’re heading out in a few minutes. We’ll drop the car off at the shop and then walk the rest of the way,”
“Your niece,”
The only thing he could do successfully was mourn their death every year. It was easier to deal with them when they couldn’t talk back or chastise him for the sloppy way he was dressed or how inappropriate his hair cut and five-o’clock shadow were.
“Check the glove compartment. Stop tearing at your skin,”
“Hang on, wait, Dean,” Sam protested, “Why don’t you come with us?”
His phone buzzed.
There was a thump as Claire presumably tossed her suitcase open, but otherwise, the house fell silent. Jimmy had crossed a line Claire had drawn in the sand, it seemed.
“We met down at the river, after dark,”
She glared daggers at him before shooing him away.
“Yeah, that’s what he told me,”
He was almost tempted to text Balthazar and ask him to schedule an impromptu signing somewhere in Kansas City, just so he’d have an excuse to drive out and look for his brother. The only thing that held him back from doing so was the knowledge that his agent would tear him a new one for calling him before noon. He wasn’t exactly in the mood to get yelled at today.
“Hello Dean,”
“Oh, um,” He wracked his brain for an innocuous answer, “Well, you’re just in time. To help, I mean,”
“Bobby tricked me,” The quietness of his whisper didn’t do anything to mask the bitterness in his voice. Cas picked at the bandaid on his thumb.
to him,”
“You know,” Cas whispered, voice quieter than before and laced with hesitance, “As soon as I left the shop earlier, Jimmy’s oil light came on,”
There was surprise etched into the lines of his face, eyes wide and staring at Dean.
“I know you miss him,”
Dean glared at Charlie, hoping his eyes were properly conveying the
Castiel already regretted asking the question. He knew if Jimmy didn’t pick up the car, he’d have to do it. Still, he had no way of knowing whether or not Jimmy would be back in time to pick it up, or if he’d even respond to a text message or a phone call. As annoying as the whole space issue was, he’d hate to inconvenience Dean further just because he couldn’t figure out where Jimmy was.
Jimmy didn’t have to reply. Dean knew he remembered. Everyone in Lawrence remembered.
“I’ll, uh, see you later,” Dean turned on his heel and walked off in the opposite direction. Castiel watched him for a moment longer before unlocking the car and climbing in behind the driver’s seat.
This was the stuff he hated about his autism.
Insane.
“I can take a look at it, if you want,”
“What’s on the schedule for today,”
“I can help a little,” He said hesitantly, “Maybe,”
i've decided mondays are my new update day, because that coincides with when i have the most free time in my schedule.
Cas squeezed his hand for one long, painful moment.
Cas had certain levels to how he responded to things. First, if things were slightly overwhelming, he’d get frustrated. Then, he’d start getting angry. Sometimes, he’d reach a full-blown meltdown, although those had tapered off when they entered their adult years. The worst times were when he lost the ability to speak.
They hadn’t found much to bury beyond her charred bones, no other physical reminder’s of her had survived the house’s destruction, save for a single photograph Dean’s father had carried out in his wallet that night.
He stepped forward, and the stone he landed on slipped underneath him, settling into a less precarious position. He sloshed forward, sputtering as ice cold water splashed his face. Cas sucked in a breath, his hand tightening on Dean’s.
“That wasn’t a ‘nothin’’ look,” Castiel frowned. He began to worry at his thumb again. Part of him was still scared that this was a bad idea,”
Bobby greeted him with a grunt, the same way he did every morning. Dean was used to it by now. He knew Bobby didn’t mean any harm by it; he was just a crotchety old man who cared more about Dean than Dean’s own father ever had.
He fought like hell, though, kicking and punching at the tree to try and break free of its grasp. He couldn’t open his eyes for fear of them freezing over, so he opted to muscle his way through.
“I just,” Jimmy paused, running a hand over his eyes, momentarily blocking his sight of the road.
He laughed.
“A car accident. That would be my last pick if I had the choice,”
He could do it, though, if he really wanted to. It wasn’t often that he indulged in the perks of being a celebrity, and it was even less often that he leveraged those perks for the sake of his own gain. Still, he was tempted. He knew any bookstore in the city would jump at the chance to have him visit. The buzz that his presence would generate would be enough to put any small shop on the map. He’d done it before for some of his favorite shops in LA. He could do it again out here.
Fuck.
Dean winced. He knew she didn’t mean to sound accusatory, but he definitely took it that way. Jody’s bluntness could be a little disconcerting at times. She didn’t doublespeak the way most people did. She said what she meant. When she said Dean had been the last one to see him, she wasn’t implying that Dean was responsible for the fact that he hadn’t been seen since the night at the pier. She just meant that Dean had been the last one to see him. Still, he couldn’t help but feel like this whole mess was his fault.
“If you say so. I’ll have Jo text you. Talk to ya later,”
Dean winced. When Cas got overwhelmed, he had a hard time finding the right words to explain his emotions or his worries, and it often resulted in him using I don’t know as a defense mechanism. It wasn’t that he didn’t know, it was that he didn’t know where to start. Most people didn’t understand that, though, and as a result, many of Cas’ genuine concerns and worries, hope and dreams were often overlooked as simple fantasy or paranoia.
Dean swallowed around the lump forming in his throat.
He looked at Cas’ face, and the expression there almost stopped his heart. There, in the corner of his mouth, so subtle that only Dean could’ve caught it, was a smile. Just the barest hint of one, but it was there. It disappeared just as soon as Dean saw it, but he wasn’t disappointed. It had been there.
“No. I mean, maybe? I texted her asking if she’d heard from it. She’s smart enough to figure out what I meant by that,”
He knew he was going to meltdown the moment Dean had picked him up.
Dean sat awkwardly perched on the edge of a particularly plush loveseat, afraid that if he leaned too far back, he’d never be able to stand up again. The strain of the position put a crick in his lower back, and he felt the muscle twinge any time he so much as slightly shifted his weight.
The coffee pot dinged. He retrieved a chipped mug from the top shelf of the cabinet. It was an old thing, a gift from long ago. The logo on it had long faded, and he’d had to paint over various nicks and chips in the ceramic with clear nail polish, so his fingers didn’t accidentally brush up against the unpleasant texture of unglazed ceramic. Still, it was the only comfort item he kept in this haunted house. The one he saved for mornings like this when he wasn’t sure if he’d survive the day.
“Don’t get what?”
“And he didn’t respond?”
Alright, that answered that question. Apparently, Cas had taken his advice after all.
It hadn’t really been his fault. At least, that’s what the sheriff had said. Faulty brake lines in a car could’ve stemmed from any number of things. It could’ve been a manufacturing error, deliberate tampering, improper usage.
“Don’t you think that’s a little overdramatic,”
“Fine, I’m about to be busy. I need to prep for the rush,”
Dean suppressed a sigh, pulling the muddy glove out of his mouth. It was his day off, the one day a week he got to rest and relax. Granted, picking trash out of a muddy, icy riverbank wasn’t exactly relaxing, but it was certainly better than heading into town to grab a coffee with his ex-boyfriend’s brother.
“He mentioned something a few weeks ago, something about a lady in the city braking too suddenly. I hadn’t realized it had resulted in a collision,”
“My life isn’t a soap opera, you know,”
His anxiety spiked, and he couldn’t stop himself from saying, “Yeah, me too,”
“I’d definitely say that turning down a marriage proposal counts as something going wrong,”
“I was saying, I don’t get it. I don’t get what went wrong with you and Dean. The two of you were practically made for each other,”
“Can you lift your leg for me?” Dean asked gently, kneeling to help ease Cas’ foot out of the inbuilt boot. Cas did as asked, a puppet on Dean’s quiet strings. Dean guided Cas’ foot back to the bare floor.
“He means, I hate fireworks. You know that, Jimmy,”
“If you want to, you could always help out with the committee again this year. I’m sure Dean would love to have you around,”
When it was just Castiel and Jimmy left standing on the porch, staring down the road at a rapidly disappearing station wagon, Jimmy sighed.
Jody Mills, the town sheriff, was one of Dean’s favorite people around. She and her wife Donna were fixtures of the community, and almost singlehandedly responsible for Lawrence’s tolerance for LGBT couples. It was hard to harass Donna when she was busy delivering baked goods to the local hospital or running donation drives for impoverished communities just outside the town limits. It was harder to harass Jody when she was the one with handcuffs on standby and held very stringent views regarding punishment for hate crimes.
Maybe it was when he’d moved to California for college. Maybe they’d never actually needed each other.
Footsteps echoed through the quiet room, reverberating in Castiel’s skull. He suppressed the urge to cover his ears with his hands, settling instead for rocking back onto his heels and then forward onto the balls of his feet repeatedly. The repetitive motion was calming.
It wasn’t even the ass-crack of dawn yet, and here Dean was, two bouquets of flowers in his hands. A dozen white lilies, and a half-dozen sunflowers. One for the Novaks, and one for Mary Winchester.
Cas shook his head.
“Yeah, right, like you get to be the one to tell me I have to treat people like people,”
Castiel winced. Jensen had been the main romantic interest of
Jimmy coughed.
Castiel almost dropped his food. Why was Dean calling the house?
Before he gave himself the time to regret his next move, he had scribbled his phone number on the cover of Cas’ information packet with one of the pens from the pile in the middle of the table.
The Christmas parade. It was a yearly tradition in Lawrence, just a little rinky dink deal through the areas of town near Kansas University. In reality, it was more of a county fair than a parade. A bunch of food booths and carnival games, cheesy winter decorations, and Jack Frost nipping at everyone’s noses. It was cute, a good first date for local teenagers and college students. A little old-fashioned, but fun, nonetheless.
Dean wasn’t quite sure how to describe the change in Jody’s demeanor when she went into Sheriff Mode. Something about her brow setting a little higher, her eyes hardening into a mask that no one could see behind, her shoulders stiffening as she prepared to ask hard questions.
No, Jimmy had to be alive. Dean was just being overly cautious, checking the river for any number of things. There could be trash floating that he needed to grab, or someone’s fishing supplies that had gotten caught in the current. That’s what he was looking for. Obviously.
He wasn’t sure if it was his innocence, or theirs. Either way, it was a lie.
his appearance.
“Hello?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yes, everything’s fine,” Castiel wasn’t sure why Dean cared.
It had felt strange, at first, like dipping a hand into a frozen lake, the sensation forcing its way along numbed neural pathways until he felt the heat. White hot, and expanding painfully. His hand had felt like it was simultaneously shrinking and growing at an infinite speed, like the life cycle of a star in the sky.
He was so lost in thought that he almost missed it.
“Then I’ll go to Kansas City, see if I can find anyone there who’ll do it!” Jimmy’s voice was getting heated. Cas stiffened next to Dean. Too late, Dean remembered Cas’ issues with raised voices. Jimmy, it seemed, did not notice.
“Dude, I’m serious,”
Of course, he had. Leave it to Jimmy to expose the raw underside of Castiel’s vulnerability to a teenager going through – in his own words – an asshole phase.
The freezing cold river that was a mile and a half upstream from the drop off point on Dean’s riverbank.
LOCAL AUTHOR RETURNS HOME they always said, usually accompanied by a picture of Cas at some local monument. Last year, it had been at the gazebo in the center of town.
“Can’t Sam step in for her?”
The thought came to him, entirely unbidden and unwelcome, just like the constant memory of Jimmy slipping through the mud along the river. The way he’d kept falling. The dirt stains on his knees.
Cas heard someone shout in the background. Something vague and indistinct. The words spurred Dean into gear again though.
“Good,” Dean poked the waders in Castiel’s hands, “Go get changed,”
“Asshole phase,”
Claire, Cas’ niece, stood in front of Dean, staring down at him with an impish grin. Her blonde hair was pulled back tight into a braid, showing off her multitude of ear piercings that would’ve broken the dress code at any corporate store. She stood loosely, a relaxed posture that made it seem as if the very weight of the world could roll right off of her shoulders and she wouldn’t care. Dean knew differently though. He could see behind the dark smudge of eyeliner, studded leather jacket, and tough exterior she tried to present. He could see the bags under her eyes from late nights studying, and the ink marks under her nails from writing.
“Figured you’d want that back eventually,” Dean was focused on the road, both hands on the steering wheel. Castiel felt himself relax incrementally. Dean had always been an incredible driver, even when he was goofing around or driving with poor form. He seemed perfectly in tune with his car, driver and vehicle melding into one instrument that was suited just right for driving down the road at eighty miles an hour with classic rock music blaring on the ancient speakers.
He hoped that he would manage to avoid running into Cas until Jimmy was found. If he couldn’t even convince himself that Jimmy was okay, how was he supposed to convince Cas?
anyways i still refuse to edit my drafts, especially when they took this much fuckin energy to write
Cas’ arms went up without hesitation, and Dean slid the clean shirt over them, slipping it down around his head gently.
They were a sour reminder that there were people in town who had actually like Michael and Naomi. Not just liked but loved. Loved them enough to hand deliver a bouquet of white lilies every year on the anniversary of their death.
“It’ll be just a few minutes,” Jimmy waved her concerns away, “Now, Cas, what do you think about a fireworks show?”
He twirled his pen in his fingers while the phone dialed. Jimmy picked up, signature advertisement salesman voice turned fully on.
Cas nodded.
He steeled his shoulders, tightening his grip on Cas’ hand.
“Hey, Ellen, how can I help you?” He winced at how pathetic he sounded and hoped Ellen would be gracious enough to not comment on it.
Dean made a decision.
“Actually,” Jimmy’s voice sounded like Claire’s had when she had been talking him into buying Cas’ book. Fuck, maybe Claire and Jimmy were more similar than he’d thought, “I was hoping you would be willing to sit in on the committee this year? What with Eileen’s pregnancy being as advanced as it is, it’s only fitting for her brother-in-law to step in, don’t you think?”
He could’ve gone and bought himself an entire wardrobe just for his visit to Lawrence. He knew people who bought entire wardrobes only to toss the clothes out after one wear. Hell, his agent was like that. She always scoffed when Castiel refused to buy new clothes for meetings or interviews. She almost had a conniption when he tried to wear a flannel he’d had since high school for his TV interview with Conan. In the end, he hadn’t worn the flannel, and had opted to just borrow something from the show’s wardrobe team. It was probably for the best, after all. The flannel had been a gift from Dean.
Jimmy’s lips quirked, a smile hiding just behind his eyes.
Dean snapped before he could stop himself.
He breathed in as deep as he could through his nose, exhaling through his mouth.
He couldn’t decipher the face Jimmy made, something between smugness and irritation.
“Look,” Jimmy’s voice was quieter, the tone he used to take with Cas when he was on the verge of one of his meltdowns, “I really think this is a good idea. I think we can make it work. Why don’t you meet me down at the coffee shop on main, the one next to Chuck’s store? We can hash out the details there. Does noon work?” He didn’t give Dean a chance to find a way out of the meeting.
Dean had a really bad feeling about the felled tree, and he’d had it ever since he saw it that morning. Now, though, with his heart in his gut and Cas’ hand wrapped tightly in his own, all he could feel was an all-encompassing dread. All day long, he’d been telling himself that Jimmy was fine. Jimmy was on a business trip. Jimmy would be home in a few days. He wasn’t sure when he’d stopped doing that. Now, all he could hope for was that they wouldn’t find him drowned underneath the damn tree in the river.
Jimmy’s voice cut through Dean’s burgeoning panic.
Cas squinted at the number and didn’t speak again until the end of the meeting.
Castiel’s hands ghosted over the scars tracing up his right arm, where his skin had been grafted.
The three of them jumped when Claire’s ringtone blared, a heavy guitar riff that could’ve made even Dean’s ears bleed.
