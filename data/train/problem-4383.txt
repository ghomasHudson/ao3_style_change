It took him a second to hear the cheering, and as soon as he did, all the old fears returned. A blush rose to his face and he pulled back from Cas at the same time that he pushed off Dean and stumbled to his feet.
“No, I know that. But it wasn’t just that.” He might have imagined it, but he thought he heard Cas’ breathing pick up on the other end of the line. Maybe he’d already guessed what was coming next. It didn’t matter though. “I needed to tell you that I’m-”
Crowley shuffled his feet and didn’t respond, and this time Cas did let his expression show. Just a single quirked eyebrow as he stepped forward to join Dean.
A little weight left Dean’s chest, but a part of him didn’t believe Cas. Of course he would leave him. It would be too weird, too tense, when he didn’t feel the same way. But he had to tell him. Even if it meant getting his heart broken.
It took him hours to notice it. He hadn’t felt it in the moment. Hadn’t felt the Cas’ hand stick slightly to his shoulder as it pushed him away, leaving him to face the Empty alone.
When they finally stopped she looked up at him, tears thick on her face from the full-body coughs that had taken her over just moments before. “Fuck off,” she whispered, her voice hoarse.
He walked away, nerves buzzing in excitement. That had gone better than he could have hoped. At least he hadn’t looked like a total idiot.
His hands were tight on the wheel as he pulled over to the side of the long road. It had gone through the forest for a while, but now it was hugging a beautiful coast line, the horizon seemingly miles away, the sun glittering off the waves.
He wasn’t worthy to be talking to Cas. To be in the same room as Cas. He was the one who had dragged him to Earth even as Cas pulled him from Hell. And Cas kept choosing him over and over. And as much as Dean hated it… he loved it. He loved him. Not that he would ever allow himself the pleasure of saying it out loud.
“Next time,” Dean grit his teeth to stop himself from saying it, to stop himself from hurting his little brother. But he couldn’t stop it. “Next time you won’t be able to save me.”
Cas handed him a credit card and Dean started down at his hands, almost letting his jaw drop. Was this guy a fucking angel? No human being could look this perfect.
He closed his suitcase and zipped it up before dragging it over to the other one already stationed by the door.
Dean took a sip, letting the liquid warm his core. There was almost no one here, just a couple families with smaller kids. He passed the cup to Cas, trading him for the sleds, and turned toward the hill.
Dean raised an eyebrow and smirked. His heart was starting to pound less fervently against his rib cage and he felt in control again. “Nine and a half,” he said with a wink.
It had started out ironically. A stupid show to watch and make fun of, because, yeah, it was completely ridiculous. It wasn’t his fault they made it so damn easy to get invested. He was only human and they had some damn good editors working for them. Most of it was probably fake, anyway. He wasn’t going to find love here.
She gave him a last encouraging smile and turned down the hallway. He watched her walk for a second, then made his way to the elevator, waiting for the ding and resisting the urge to fix his hair.
She turned from them and Chris held out his arm to lead her into the next room. Dean’s face hurt from smiling and he let his face fall for a second, conscious as ever of the cameras fixed on him.
Stella stepped back, taking the knife with her. She looked down at it thoughtfully, then tucked it back in her jacket. Dean vision was starting to go blurry on the edges but he tracked her eyes carefully. Her mask was starting to slip a little, and he could see the barely contained heat brimming under the cool surface.
He leaned forward on the bed a little and craned his neck until he could see the clock. 2:30pm. Two hours til he was getting picked up.
He stood while he waited, trying to stop himself from pacing. A camera was still fixed on him, though Ketch had disappeared to God knows where. He fidgeted with his cufflinks, shivering without his jacket even though it was a pleasant night.
He couldn’t look at the kid. Not now. So instead he looked up at Sam, his eyes broken, pleading for him to understand. To understand why he was sinking lower and lower as every happy thought left his body. To understand why he would never be truly happy again. To understand that today, he’d lost everything.
“How did we not know he had a son?” Cas said bitterly. It wasn’t often he regretted killing someone. He always made sure he had a good reason, so why would he? But this, if he lost Dean because he’d killed Gavin Delfino…
“Don’t mention it.” He rubbed the back of his neck and looked down. This wasn’t how he’d expected their first time alone to go. “I mean- I know you would have been fine. I didn’t mean to-”
As soon as Lisa had left the room producers had swept in, directing people all over the place. Hannah pulled him aside again into the same room for an interview and he rolled his shoulders to ease his aching back before smiling into the camera.
Why hadn’t he just said it back? He’d meant it. He loved Cas. Maybe he always had. And not like he loved Sam. It was just Cas, only Cas, Cas was gone.
Coughs racked her body and her arms flailed uselessly at her sides and her eyes flew open. They were filled with terror, but they fixed on him, met his gaze with desperation.
Scott nodded at her and turned to more fully face the guys. “Today, we’re going to be exposing you gentleman,” he paused briefly, glancing at the stage and smirking, “To the fine art of male exotic dancing.” Some of the braver guys in the group cheered again, but silence fell quickly. “Each of you will be performing on that stage later this afternoon. You’ll each have your own coach to help you, teach you the art.”
“It started with AC/DC and after that it just spiraled.” Her whole face seemed to glow when talking about Ben, and he couldn’t stop the wide grin covering his face. “I think Led Zeppelin is the current favorite.”
One of the black tuxes leaned forward and nudged his partner, pointing at Dean. “Hey,” he started, “you’re the one who organized this whole thing, right?”
Cas felt the blow to the back of his head before he could even turn, and immediately pain shot through him, his vision dancing with black spots. Instinctively, he turned to find Dean.
When Sam didn’t answer, Sonny asked again, this time commanding, sure. So Sam told him. He told him about Jack. Told him about Chuck. Told him about Cas, or what little he knew. Then he told him about that day. About the vamp hunt. About Dean’s choice. The choice that ended it all.
“I lifted ‘em off the motel manager. He almost caught me, too,” Dean said as Cas and Jack started to laugh.
Dean broke into a run. The voices seemed to be coming from around the corner of the house, probably one of those little alcoves with couches set up.
It went fuzzy for a while. Then he saw bright lights above his head and let his eyes fall open. He was in a hospital bed, tight bandages clinging to his arms.
She exchanged a few words with a couple of them and then held her hands out to the building behind them.
It wasn’t just for that, though, that he deserved the pain. It was for the years of wasted opportunities. Years of mistreatment, of taking the angel for granted, of stolen glances that never quite made it to words.
Mick rolled his eyes but nodded. “Maybe you’re right. I’m going to get a drink, can I get you anything?”
Dean let the shirt fall to his side, his eyes still fixed on Cas, a curious expression on his face. And Cas, he couldn’t help but stare back.
sacrifice himself to save the world. And he knew it would be hard to convince Sam he was okay with it. To keep him in the dark. And yeah, he knew his brother would be pissed. But Cas had said it was for the best. And Cas didn’t like secrets… not after he’d lied to them for a whole year. So if Cas thought this was best then it was best.
The ground felt cold beneath his legs, and it seemed to dig into him as he reached out two fingers for her neck. He pressed them into the vein and waited, breathless. He breathed a sigh of relief when he felt a steady if somewhat weak beat against his fingers. He pushed himself up with his good arm and went to finally leave when suddenly her whole body seized.
Another wave beat against the sand, higher up on the beach, reaching all the way back to where his feet were curled behind him. He shivered again as it covered him, but the sound of the water receding steadied him.
“Dammit,” he said under his breath. Stella’s arms pushed against the floor, tears flowing freely from her eyes as she struggled to push herself up. Cursing himself silently the whole time, he lifted her by the shoulders, letting her sit up straight and open her windpipe.
“Cas,” Dean whispered against his ear, panic mounting in his chest. It never got easier, seeing him like this. It probably never would.
Even in this reality, even across the phone, he could hear the smirk in Sam’s voice. “Oh, well I’m sure you’ll be busy then.”
Lisa stepped forward and smiled warmly at them. “If you guys are a little nervous, that’s okay. This is about trust. It’s about showing me why you’re here, and showing me you can have a great time. I don’t expect you guys to be great at it,” the guys all chuckled here and she joined in, “But I expect you to have fun with it.”
Dean kept his eyes shut. There was no reason to be awake yet. No reason to ruin this perfect peace, every muscle relaxed and breaths coming free and easy. And there was no reason to disturb his husband.
The smell of salt was heavy in the air and a slight breeze blew through the window, rustling the heavy cream curtains. The sun was just starting to peak over the horizon, but it hadn’t yet climbed high enough to send light cascading over their bed.
The memories came with a sharp stab of pain. Dean wasn’t there to laugh with him. He hadn’t been there to wake up next to. To make Cas coffee before he flew into a murderous rage.
He was warm. Impossibly warm. His husband was wrapped around him and the heavy weight of their blankets pushed him further into the mattress.
This got a roar of approval from the guys so Lisa shrugged, glancing down at her clipboard as if to double check.
After what seemed like an eternity, Cas finally untangled himself from Dean and stood. He quickly pulled on sweats and a t-shirt and gestured for Dean to do the same.
He could do this. He was never going to make hundreds in tips but maybe it was enough for an audience of Bachelor superfans.
Sam clenched his teeth and forced back the tears gathering in his eyes, leaning back against Dean’s dresser and opening the messaging app.
“Hello, boys,” a gravelly voice tinged with a British accent whispered as a man wearing a black trenchcoat emerged from the shadows.
“It’s okay,” she cut him off. “Really,” she said again when he hesitated. “Thank you, though, for not downplaying this. It’s just- I’m really okay,” she smiled softly. “Wait here.”
Cas heard his name and looked up, trying to ignore the way everything was moving in slow motion around him. He nodded to the other guys mechanically and fixed a smile on his face, following the coach that took his arm and glancing back to see Dean walking behind him, his face flushed again.
Cas had softly opened the door as usual, crossed the room quickly and laid a hand on his forehead. Everything had been so easy between them since Purgatory, even with all the pain swirling through the halls of the Bunker. He’d whispered a few soft words and smoothed back Dean’s sweat slicked hair.
“I love you, too,” Dean added, his voice thick with emotion. “I’m sorry it took me until now to say it. But I do. Of course I do.”
He didn’t talk about it anymore though. It didn’t haunt him as much now. New traumas had filled its place. But the visions of Hell somehow stung the most, rang the truest.
The tide was starting to rise. Each wave now came nearly to his knees, leaving white foam behind it. He idly reached out a hand and dragged it through the wet sand, mind searching for the words. The words that would make this all okay. That would fix his unfixable mistake.
Two more guys walked over and joined them. The first was in a burgundy suit that complimented his dark skin tone perfectly. Dean could see his muscles bulging and rippling through the fabric, and the guy carried himself like he owned the place. No, that wasn’t it. He was in control, yes, but it was more that he was hyper-aware. Dean’s gaze swept up him one more time and he nodded to himself. Probably ex-military.
Crowley released the hand from his jaw and patted his cheek twice. “Sure, darling. And after your guts,” he spat the word, almost like it offended him, “are spilled all over the floor… then I’ll kill Castiel, and damn all the retribution that will come with it.”
Still, he could almost hear Sam’s voice in his head, repeating ‘Kids are the best’ with a mocking grin on his face. Whatever, Sam didn’t know a thing about women. The fact he’d landed Eileen was a goddamn miracle.
Even with his thoughts swirling and his heart still pounding in his chest, Dean couldn’t stop the smile that formed when he saw his Baby sitting ready and waiting. That was some consolation, at least. Some consolation for being separated from his brother, from his life, from the apple-pie job he’d been about to take. But there was no use dwelling on the past now. He was dead. And he wasn’t going back… not this time. So, he might as well put a few things to bed while he was here.
Lisa and Scott made a few more notes on the clipboard they were holding, glancing up once or twice at the guys and whispering without pointing.
Dean leaned forward on the couch and crossed his hands in front of him, settling them on his elbows on his knees. “I work with cars, mainly. My- well, my uncle- he owns a yard and I set up a repair shop in the back.”
“What?” he said shortly. He didn’t have time for casual calls today. Didn’t have time for any calls, really.
In a suddenly aggressive move, he reached down for the blade and the gun. He held them, weighing his options, weighing the pain.
“Alright, well,” she raised the cocktail glass in her hand, “Have some drinks, some food. Enjoy yourselves! I can’t wait to get to know all of you.”
And they were his final moments. He had no delusions about that. Cas was never coming back. Ever. There were no deals, no resurrections, no last ditch efforts to save him. He was just gone. The love of Dean’s life was gone.
“Fine,” he shot back. “Maybe it’s not, but we’re talking about this.” Cas just shook his head, meeting Dean’s eyes defiantly.
Before long, they were at the base of the drive leading up the mountain, waiting for a signal to continue.
, that had swept through him. He opened his mouth to answer, not even sure what he was going to say, but a door swung open behind him.
He and Cas had made the plan quickly. Too quickly to talk about anything else. Which Dean was grateful for, because he’d been just about ready that night. Just about ready to bite the goddamn bullet already.
Cas’ arm pressed against his chest and it was harder to draw air but he didn’t care because every breath filled him with the smell of Cas. Cas, who was human now. Cas who was sweet and awkward and nerdy and commanding and perfect. Cas, who was
Cas shrugged and grabbed some clothes from his suitcase before heading to the bathroom. Then he checked his watch, 8:07 am. Okay, so he hadn’t woken up
Cas had been wrong. On most levels, he was still just daddy’s blunt instrument. He was the man that John had groomed, had controlled. He was the man that John had caught, when he wasn’t a man at all. When he was just a boy in high school, trying to figure himself out. When he was with another boy his age, all smiles and laughs that turned into screams of fear and pain. He was the man who had been too afraid of his father to fight back, too desperate for his approval to live his own life, too alone in the world to turn anywhere else.
“Helps you with what?” Cas said. And Dean wanted to bury his head in his hands, or better yet, sink underneath the floorboards to a world far away from this conversation.
“Alright, who’s ready?” he asked playfully, greeted by a loud cheer. Once things had quieted down, he pulled the card out and started reading. “Castiel,” Cas smiled, high-fiving the guys around him with enthusiasm he didn’t really feel. “Gabe,”
Sam smiled a little but dropped his eyes to the table to give Dean space. His eyes stayed down, and he left them there when he answered. Dean expected a speech. Countless empty words about acceptance and love and equality and support. But Sam just said two words. “Tell him.”
Cas kept his face composed, but inside he felt a little thrill. Family? He’d thought it was just another of Crowley’s goons, one of the indisposable goons he called on when he didn’t want to get his hands dirty.
He could get a handle on his grief for five fucking minutes. Dean deserved that much. Dean deserved a hell of a lot more than that much.
When Cas finally spoke, his voice was hoarse, even lower and scratchier than usual. “Thank you, Dean.”
He scrolled past the texts between him and Dean and hovered over Cas’ name. It didn’t seem right, somehow. Hell, most of the time just being in the same room as them didn’t seem right. He always felt- had felt like he was intruding. Like he was interrupting something personal and private and
Hell had never really left Dean. Cas had pulled him out, lost angels in the process. But part of it had come with him. Even all these years later, he still sometimes woke with the heavy stench of sulfur filling his nostrils.
Cas gulped and glanced at Dean, who had lost his flustered look and was standing with a cocky grin on his face.
It hurt to see him like this. Dean never let it show. But in these quiet, dark, mornings, to see his badass, terrifying husband stripped of all that in face of the horrors they had been through… it unsettled him.
“Didn’t think the great Dean Winchester would be able to get over years of repression, but yet here we are. You ready to go, sunshine?”
Dean, on the other hand, was a natural. He made all of it look easy, like he’d been doing it his whole life. And he did the whole thing with a swagger in his step that Cas knew for a
Dean froze. This… they didn’t talk about this. They didn’t talk about the time Sam had come back to the motel early to find a man leaving. They didn’t talk about the boyfriend he’d had in high school that had lasted until John beat the shit out of both of them. They didn’t talk about it because it wasn’t a part of himself Dean wanted in the open. John was right. He was wrong, broken, useless.
“Cas,” he whispered above the sound of the waves. “Cas, please say you can hear me. Please,” he choked on the word and clenched his jaw. “We need to talk,” he squeezed out through gritted teeth.
When he stopped talking, when it was all out in the open, Sonny was quiet. For a long time. The sound of his breathing barely audible through the phone.
When he came to, his cheek was pressed against an advertisement for a weekend getaway to Cabo that had been dirtied by its time outside. He peeled himself off it and sat up, head ringing as he glanced around the alley.
Cas moved toward him, but before he could even take two steps, the cool rush of electricity jolted through his system and everything went black.
One of the other guys went next, and Dean didn’t pay much attention. Instead, he stared at Lisa, letting himself daydream for a second. She could be his wife. In just a few months, he could be engaged.
But he fucking wanted it. Eventually, with the right person, Dean wanted to be in love. And that terrified him.
Cas sighed, his breath hot against Dean’s skin, and Dean propped his chin up to look at him. His expression was thoughtful. But it wasn’t annoyed or disappointed. It was almost sad. Because they finally had everything, finally had rid the world of Chuck, and he was still haunting them. Still making them question if they ever had any free will.
“Looks like your friends are here,” he said quietly, tracing the man’s hairline with the cool metal. Cas noted distractedly that his hair was sloppy, like he’s cut it himself months ago and never bothered to try again. From behind him, he could see the drops of sweat running down the sides of his face, but not the man’s eyes. He needed to see his eyes.
Hair and makeup didn’t take long, the producers pulled them away for another round of interviews, and then they were standing with the other guys backstage waiting for the audience to trickle in.
“Bye,” Dean added, racking his mind for something, anything, to make the guy stay. But it was too late. He was already walking away.
Lying to Billie, that had been easy. Maybe too easy. Because there was a small part of him, a part he hated more than anything, that hated Chuck just enough to make this seem okay. But that’s all it was. Just a small part for him to cling to when he lied to everyone around him except Cas. Because after everything, there was no way in hell that he was okay with Jack giving himself up. Or any of his family, for that matter. But especially Jack.
And every time he heard their piercing screams in his ear. But he could deal with those. He couldn’t deal with the small whimpers, the pleading, the defeat. The sound of a small child gasping as he dug the razor further into their neck, his eyes clouded over as he tried to be somewhere else. Because if he was in the moment, if he let himself be there, then he knew he would enjoy it. His sick, twisted mind would enjoy it. Even when he wanted to turn the razor on himself.
“It’s a big, new world out there.” Bobby was still smiling, a peace in his eyes that Dean had rarely, if ever, seen when he was alive. “I guess the question is… what are you gonna do now, Dean?”
“At the bunker.” Sam’s voice was tight, dripping with something Dean couldn’t identify. It was anger, on the surface. But underneath there was panic, fear, confusion, love, pity. It was raw, pure, and not something Dean could face at the moment.
Jack would say something simple but full of meaning. He would look at Dean with that expression that was so eerily similar to Cas and let Dean speak, choosing instead to listen.
“Well,” Sam started as Jack joined them. “I think technically Jack and I won the race, but this definitely tops that.” He clapped Dean on the back and Dean finally raised his eyes.
Cas squinted, looking at the man in front of him. This isn’t what he’d expected from Dean. Maybe from Mick or even Benny… They seemed like they had their lives together. But Dean?
Sam looked back at him and smiled, his eyes far away. “I think I was 13, or 14? Dad was on a case in,” he paused, frowning, “Where was it, Dean? Colorado, right?”
He could still feel him quivering slightly beneath his arms, but Dean nodded. He stood without taking his arms from around Cas, then guided him through the halls of the small cottage to the kitchen.
The first rose ceremony had been a mixture of nerves and hope. He wasn’t exactly sure if he was hopeful of getting sent home or getting to stay, but either way, he was here now. And there was no going back (he could leave… but honestly the free food and nice house made it worth sticking around for just a little longer).
So they would do it again. He would figure out a way before tomorrow night to save them both. Because Dean Winchester was his. And he’d be damned if he was going to let Crowley take him.
Charlie had disappeared to god knows where, but Dean didn’t care. He just dropped his eyes and tried to push down the blush rising on his neck.
Cas brought a hand to cover his and Dean let his hand still, the steady weight of Cas’ hand impossibly warm against his skin. “Of course.”
“Cas,” he breathed. Because with those two words, everything seemed a bit more okay. This other way, this plan, it would work. Jack would be okay.
The angel, or probably human in this daydream, pressed a kiss softly against his lips before standing and getting dressed.
changed.” Dean stared back into her eyes, a question on his face. So she went on. “The old you never would have admitted that.”
It was then that Dean woke up, the feeling of a blade still heavy in his hand. Cas whispered to him softly, bringing him back to his room, far away from the torments of that place. Something had been different in the air though. It was so sweet between them, so open, that Dean hadn’t even hesitated before scooting over and making room for Cas on the bed.
As soon as the angel was settled, he snuggled into him, wrapping his entire body around him. They didn’t normally get this close. It was easier to pretend it was platonic otherwise.
Dean let out a frustrated sigh and pulled the book back toward him. “Man, we been looking for this thing for days. It probably isn’t even our kind of thing.”
The guys all clapped, clearly feeling an energy that Cas didn’t. His world was still spinning, the lights and smoke crowding into his brain and leaving little room for thought.
After a minute, Cas pushed off the bed and walked to the door. “I have to go to work. Why don’t you think about it? But, Dean,” he looked back with parted lips, “You could have it. Everything you always wanted. All of it.”
“There’ll be four different acts today,” Lisa went on. “Two groups of four--firemen and some policemen. One group of three, those guys will be robots. One duet for the cowboys. And,” she paused for effect, “One lucky gentleman will get to do a solo act all by himself as a bachelor!”
In the end, he’d gone with a dark brown three-piece that looked like a damn good Brioni knock-off. He couldn’t afford it. But he didn’t care.
He laughed and a couple of the guys joined him. When it was quiet again, he said, “Well, I hate to steal you away from here, but it is time for your first rose ceremony.”
Cas just stood there for a minute. The cold air reached out for him, enveloping him. It seemed to call to him, to beg him to lay down on the damp floor and stay there. Wait for some construction crew or teens looking for a fix to find him, body deteriorating slowly. But he couldn’t do that. Dean was still out there, otherwise they would have found a body. And Dean needed him.
He just stood there. Probably for hours. His mind was still playing catch up but his body was in shock. Cas was- Cas was gone. And they hadn’t even fought Chuck yet. Cas was gone and he had no clue how to get him out. Cas was gone because he’d made a stupid deal to save their son.
And he did deserve to feel it. Of course he did. Because he froze. He had stared at Cas, his mind processing his throat dry, words forming in the back of his throat but stopping there. His hands had shook slightly while the rest of him went still.
Dean felt tears well up in his eyes and he stepped closer in the wet sand, pressing himself against Cas. But the former angel wasn’t finished.
It was kinda embarrassing. But by the time she saw that, they would be engaged, hiding away from the public and watching the show together.
“We’re just having some fun. Remember why you’re here, man,” he added, before dropping a hand on Cas’ shoulder. He stayed there for a minute, their eyes meeting, and then he turned.
He didn’t say anything when she reached him, just stood there, his face a mask of confusion even while his heart raced.
“What next? Sammy will probably want out… he could settle down with Eileen, be happy. He wouldn’t have to be all out either, they could do small hunts on the side. Who knows what Jack will do. What about you, though?” Dean squeezed out the last question quickly, afraid of the answer. He couldn’t keep going, even if the world was safe, without Cas by his side.
He should have just said something. He should have just said that he loved him too, that he couldn’t say when it started but it had been years, that there was no way he could escape it and he didn’t care because Castiel was the best thing that had ever happened to him.
When the limo started rolling again, the conversation immediately stopped. Everyone was staring out the windows, waiting for the first glance of this season’s bachelorette.
“Let’s go,” Cas repeated, his heart beating rapidly in his chest. He couldn’t tell anymore if it was from nerves or-
She called up everyone one by one, and with each passing person, he could feel the impending disappointment grow. When she called Benny he breathed an internal sigh of relief. And then right after she called Nick and he had to stop himself from rolling his eyes.
As he walked past the fountain and toward the door, Hannah gestured for him to follow her into a side room where a camera was set up in front of a chair.
to go first. Still, Cas was glad they were getting it over with. Better to go now when his heart was still beating then in about twenty minutes when it had stopped completely.
“This-” Sam cleared his throat and Dean looked over at him, still tangled with Cas. “This isn’t real.”
But as much as he wanted to let the strong facade slip, the minute he walked into the living room, his blood ran cold.
“You don’t get to-” Dean paused, drawing in a deep breath as he unclenched his fist. “You don’t get to just say shit like that and shut up, Cas.”
He reached a hand up for Cas’ face and cupped his cheek. Then he leaned in, pressing their lips together. Cas kissed back immediately, letting Dean’s hands fall and running them up his back into his hair.
No one really said anything on the ride. Made small talk, mostly. Not that there was much small talk left when they had no connection to the outside world. But there was something about the tiny interior of the limo, the cameras so close, that even at the producer’s leading questions the guys stayed quiet.
“And Cas,” Dean immediately interrupted. Inwardly, he cursed, but outwardly he held Sam’s gaze with what he hoped was a blank expression. Sam slowly raised one eyebrow, but it wasn’t snarky. It was full of pity.
He was wrong. The djinn had created a nearly perfect world, but it wasn’t possible. He couldn’t let it be possible. And it wasn’t even because he knew Cas didn’t feel the same, it was because he didn’t deserve that. Didn’t deserve to be happy.
But there was something so ruggedly real about a city he always claimed was full of the fakest people in the world. Tall palm trees standing out on the crowded streets, the sounds of angry drivers floating up through the window, a heat that hung in the air so heavily it was almost visible.
Dean walked over to the mirror, snatching the waistcoat up from the bed on his way. He shrugged it over his shoulders, almost buttoning it before he remembered his tie. He’d brought a silver collar pin (no, Sam didn’t know about that one) and he fastened it quickly before looping the tie around his neck.
Dean let his fingers trail down to the floor where his gun and a large silver knife lay discarded. He’d grabbed them from his dresser with shaking hands before collapsing. And now he sat, the voices of his family in his head.
He pulled the card from the envelope slowly and Cas felt his hatred for this guy grow. He was looking around at everyone with a slight smirk touching the corners of his mouth, then he cleared his throat.
Her companion’s eyebrow raised at the word husband and Cas rolled his eyes slightly, forcing a civil expression.
It still didn’t feel real. Cas said to give it time. They’d only been married two days after all. But somehow, he didn’t think this would ever feel real. He didn’t think this bliss was allowed to be real. Because there was nothing hanging over them. Sam and Eileen were on a hunt. Jack was back at the bunker. His family was okay and so was the world.
Still, his mouth got a bit drier with every ring. This could ruin everything. Everything. And here he was about to confess when there wasn’t even something pushing him. When there was a world-ending crisis looming. This wasn’t the time.
He nodded and cleared his throat. “I think that went really well. I think if I can just be myself, I won’t have a problem.” He tried to remember the person he wanted to portray to the audience. The cocky, slightly arrogant, but overall sweet guy. “And I’m really hopeful that I’ll get a chance to talk to Ben about Zepp, kid’s got taste.”
He got dressed quickly, his fingers shaking slightly on the buttons. Mostly, though, he was in control. And if he went home tonight, what was the worst that could happen? He’d go back to the garage, Bobby would give him shit, Lee probably would too, and then he’d get on with his life.
He dug his hands into the sand and made a fist, wincing as the coarse grains cut into his hand. The waves beat against the heavenly beach, gray water foaming against the sand.
He heard footsteps behind him as he looked around, trying to get his bearings as quickly as possible. A bright fluorescent light hung from the ceiling and he squinted at it, quickly averting his eyes. He knew Cas had a few places like this too, but he never pressed him for details. He figured it would be safer for both of them.
He called his attendant while he started his second glass of water and asked him to clear his schedule today. He’d had a few meetings with art dealers that were in town, but nothing he couldn’t miss.
“Sam can go,” Dean went on, ignoring him. “If you wanna do this alone. Or he can stay. I don’t give a fuck.”
Cas stood and went into the main stage area where a buffet had been set up. He made a beeline for some honey and toast and then left the room, not bothering to chat it up and see how the other guys were doing.
It hadn’t been enough. To save him. Dean’s death was on him. Because it had been Dean’s choice… he wasn’t stupid enough to miss that. Dean had wanted to die right then. And Sam hadn’t been able to change his mind. It wasn’t a fucking rusty nail that killed his brother. Dean killed himself.
He knew why though. He could never have that, could never have him. Waves washed over the hole in his heart that would never be filled. Pain, sadness, emptiness, they washed into it and then slipped away as the waves receded.
Cas tried to find the part of himself that was jealous, that wanted that time with Lisa, but it wasn’t there yet. It would be… he was sure. Just not yet.
“He’s gone,” Dean said hoarsely. He’d have to tell him at some point. He’d have to get it over with. He’d have to let his soul open up and let out his darkest secret.
Jack counted them off with a ready, set, go, and before he knew it, the sled was slipping over the edge and hurtling down the hill.
“Chuck created us. But he didn’t create this. I am yours, Dean Winchester, and you are mine. We are intertwined, our destinies connected from the beginning. We will always come back to each other. Be it Heaven, Hell, or even Earth. And that is
The first cut wasn’t deep. It was the kind he did for spells and sigils, the kind that would heal up immediately if it needed to. He let himself relax for the second cut, let himself welcome the pain that he knew would course through his body.
“He’s not with me,” Cas said finally. He knew he’d have to play this perfectly. Sam didn’t like breaking the law, not when it wasn’t absolutely necessary. He knew exactly the kind of work Cas was in, and he could never condone it. But he wouldn’t stand up against it either.
“You too, angel,” Dean said, letting the ball of emotions vibrating in his chest come undone and seep through him, love for Cas radiating so powerful he wondered why it wasn’t visible. “You too.”
A few minutes later, Lisa walked into the room. She settled onto the couch and exchanged a few words with the guys while the producers arranged everyone around her in a semicircle.
Instinctively, Dean backed up, his hands held up defensively. He took another deep breath, glancing back to the car as if he still had a chance to run, and then turned to face John.
The guy took them through the steps, and Cas’ mind settled, falling into the routine. The first half wasn’t that bad. Simple stuff, more about owning the move than skill, according to Jay.
Great. Of course that was where Cas jumped. Maybe it was his conversation with Sam, the quiet acceptance that still beat quietly in the room, but he considered it. If it went terribly, he wouldn’t lose Cas. He knew that. No matter how much he’d fucked up before, the angel had stuck by his side. So he wouldn’t lose him. But he would make things different.
It was on the side table next to the couch. Dean and everyone else claimed it was probably bad form to display any affection or weakness in the place he so often conducted business.
He silenced the voice and closed the contacts app. He went through the rest of his phone, trying to figure himself out. He was a mechanic, no surprise there.
It took three limos to get them all there. Which seemed like an extravagant waste of money but hey, it looked good on camera and that was what counted.
Words spun rapidly in his head and he couldn’t grasp any of them, couldn’t string them together in a way that would tell Cas how badly he wanted it. So he just nodded again, waves of shame already crashing over him.
He opened one of them up, taking deep breaths to push everything away, and his eyes widened. A large bag of salt, two handguns, a vile of what he could only assume was holy water, and even an angel blade sat innocently inside.
“Lisa is great,” he said immediately. “I mean watching her last season I was immediately drawn to her. She’s such a good mother, such a sweet girl. And she’s hot as hell, too,” he added like an afterthought.
When it really came down to it, though, he hadn’t been able to drink. It felt like dishonor on Cas’ memory. To numb the pain that Dean deserved to feel totally and completely for the rest of-
Cas had to give him credit. He didn’t even know who Crowley was and still without hesitation he went after him. Although, Dean always did have a temper to him.
Lisa walked out to the front of the group and gestured to a guy who’d come from some back room and was now standing next to her. His leather jacket was only done halfway up, showing his bare chest beneath. Cas nodded appreciatively as his eyes involuntarily moved up the guy’s body. This was more his style.
Dean watched distractedly as Benny walked up to her, tilting his head like he was used to wearing a hat. Lisa pouted at something he said and then smiled, her eyes glittering the whole time.
“Can I get a coffee, black?” the guy said. And, oh god, stuck in the closet or not Dean would have married the guy on the spot.
“Well,” she said, smiling broadly. “We all know why you really want him. He’s just your pretty little trophy wife.”
Sam knew Dean would hate him for it. Would snatch the phone from his hands and glare at him and probably avoid him for the rest of the day. Looking through his stuff was right up there with talking about his feelings in terms of unpardonable offenses.
Dean burst around the corner, and without a thought, grabbed Jake by the shoulders and pulled him away from where he was, pushing himself closer to Lisa.
“Shit,” he muttered, immediately trying to turn to wake Cas. Not that it normally worked. Cas would appear to be awake, his thoughts coming out in jumbled, fractured sentences, and in the morning he would remember none of it.
He read all morning, already feeling like this was going to be the worst part. The waiting. The boredom. The constant cameras waiting for any sign of drama but mostly capturing the most mundane interactions that had ever happened on the planet.
“It’s okay, angel. We’re here. I’m okay. You’re okay.” He repeated the words over and over. For minutes. Waiting until Cas could ground himself, caught in the knowledge that there was nothing he could do except hold his breath and repeat those words until they sounded hollow.
“The groveller you sent to beg forgiveness? Pardon me if I’m not bowing before you,” Cas said, letting his voice drop into its lowest registers.
“God, someone woke up on the wrong side of the bed,” Charlie said, tucking her hair behind her ear. “Or maybe just a bed with no one in it.”
He extended a hand toward Dean as he got there, a smile fixed to his face. There was pain there. But he looked like a good guy.
“I feel like some guys really know where they stand going into this, and some don’t. It’s scary, for sure. I already know where I’m going and I still feel the nerves.”
They stayed there for a minute, Dean’s hand heavy on Cas’ shoulder. The rest of the tension slowly seeped from them and finally Cas gave a small smile.
“He made a deal,” Jack supplied. His voice was tight with emotion. Dean risked a glance up at him. He looked just as alone as Dean felt. His father had been taken from him. “To save me,” he continued. "When he experienced a moment of true happiness, he would be taken.”
Some of the guys in the car cheered--Dean couldn’t help but notice that lamp guy was just staring out the window, knuckles white as he clutched his ridiculous offering--but Dean let out a shrill wolf whistle, grinning from ear to ear.
“I mean it,” he said firmly. Then he let his head fall back onto Cas’ chest, loathe to lose Cas’ eyes but missing the feeling of him.
So Dean let his head be whipped back and forth, his entire face swollen and bloody and bruised and his arms dripping blood. And he focused on his hands, on the rough rope coiling around them. He was so close now, to being completely free. The longer he strained against the constraints, the looser they felt around him.
“Cas,” Dean repeated the name softly before he could stop himself. Then he nodded and dropped his gaze again, writing the name in shaky letters.
“Sam,” he started before stopping again. The silence had lifted and he could breath, could think. Then something inside him pushed him, decided to stop being a coward. “It wasn’t just Cas. For a long time. But now… it’s just him, Sam. He’s it for me.” The words caught in his throat, clawing their way past all his guilt, all his fear, all his years of self-hatred. But they made it out all the same.
Dean gulped again and nodded. He was sure he was being obvious… but at this point, what did it matter? He had to find Cas. He had to find Cas and tell him- well, and give him an answer. He had to explain why he hadn’t gotten him out while he was on Earth. Had to explain that he’d tried… even if Sam didn’t know.
“There’s this case we were on a couple weeks ago,” Sam started, “I could really use his help remembering the details.”
When he came to, he was lying on the floor of a dirty warehouse, tears he didn’t remember shedding streaking his face.
By the time he was heading down the stairs, the smell of freshly brewed coffee was wafting up from the kitchen. His mouth watered and he rubbed his eyes as he wandered inside, ignoring the camera crew standing to the side and going over a clipboard.
Cas responded immediately, his hands slipping around Dean’s waist and pulling him in tighter. When they finally broke apart, Dean pressed their foreheads together, breathing heavily. There were tears on both their cheeks, and he wasn’t sure who they were from or when they’d started falling.
. So Sam was happy here too. Maybe he could just… Dean glanced at the clock. “Uh, Cas is gonna be home soon.”
“Alive,” Dean repeated slowly, tasting the word on his tongue. Cas was alive. “Where?” he blurted before he could stop himself.
Jack was walking away and it was too late. It was too late because Dean didn’t think he would have to say anything. He thought Jack would bring it up and they would never have to know that he missed Cas so desperately it hurt. It hurt so goddamn bad.
Dean blushed again and glanced anxiously at the customers, some part of him thinking he would be on the ground, face bleeding and throbbing in pain. But one of them just tried to hide a smile and the other didn’t even look up from their phone.
When he forced himself to sit back up, Benny and Harry had claimed the other bunk bed and Nick had sprawled dramatically on the twin in the corner. Dean was just standing in the middle of the room glancing around dumbly.
Dean took a step forward and rotated the knife slowly in his hand. “What was he? Some bastard son from an affair with a whore?” He snorted and looked back to Cas with raised eyebrows before turning his attention to Crowley.
“I had a really great night with you,” she started. “You really are a great bunch of guys, and I’m really looking forward to getting to know you. You ready to start dating?!” she added with a bright smile.
He felt the old feeling taking over. The one that made him numb. Made him not want to process and just keep everything inside where no one would know.
Dean clenched his fists, still hidden inside of his pockets, and forced himself to keep eye contact with his father. He was older than him here. His dad looked the same age as Mary, carefree even as his face slipped into a scowl. The youth didn’t make him any less intimidating. Didn’t stop memories of whiskey-fueled beatings from playing over and over in Dean’s head.
Dean’s thoughts were interrupted as the room fell silent and Chris Harrison walked in holding a champagne flute. He tapped a fork against it (rich people… what the fuck) and the room fell silent.
Because they did find their way back. Over and over and over. It hadn’t been easy, and before they’d been married, they were more often lost to each other than not, but they’d still done it.
He thought he saw a shadow flit briefly across Dean’s face but before he could be sure, it was gone. “Always get up early. It’s how my dad raised me. Now, c’mon. Get some food.”
Dean watched as all of the guys who had left their jobs and homes to get a chance at this said goodbye. The room already felt emptier without them there. Just seventeen guys and one beautiful woman.
“Dean, what happened?” Sam said, resting an arm on his shoulder. Not the one with the handprint. Not the one that mattered. Not the one that stung with loss.
He set the gun carefully next to him, choosing to ignore how badly his hands were shaking. They hadn’t really stopped since Cas had told him. Since Dean had stood there mutely, the words,
He could see the next street opening out in front of them, barely one hundred feet away. Cars sped by and people milled about under the glow of the street lights. Barely one hundred feet to go, and Cas felt all of his senses suddenly go on edge. He wasn’t sure what he’d heard, or even what he’d seen, but something was wrong.
Sam’s eyes widened just a fraction and then he nodded once, slowly. And Dean thought he was going to drop it there. But he understood even better than that. He understood that Dean needed to say it. “What did he say?” he asked softly.
There was silence on the other end. He could hear Cas’ breaths, could almost see his brow furrowing in concern. When Cas spoke again, his tone had softened and his voice was lower. “Why did you call me?”
“Don’t you know?” Cas added, spreading his hands and squinting in a way that sent Dean’s heart pounding.
He shook his head, knowing at this point he was stalling, though for the life of him he didn’t know why. Then he whipped the blinds closed and slipped out of his sweats and loose t-shirt. He threw them haphazardly into one of his two suitcases that could stand to be packed a little neater, and turned to the other, carefully pulling the suit out.
Then Sam walked up and Dean finally met his eyes. He expected judgement, amusement, or some scorn. But all he saw on Sam’s face was pride. Pride in his older brother for finally taking this step, for finally doing what he should have done years ago.
He hadn’t spent long looking at them though. His eyes always found their way back to Cas. Just like they always had. But now it was okay, it was allowed.
Cas walked around to the front of him and lowered himself to look straight into the man’s eyes. He let a small smile creep onto his face and traced the man’s throat with his knife, letting the smile grow as he did.
The light near the window was even brighter, but the sink was there, so he squinted as his glass filled. After chugging it, he felt a little better. The splitting headache receded and was replaced by a single thought. The only thought he’d ever cared about in the last few years.
Once they were all packed into it, it was hot and uncomfortable. But Dean didn’t care. His heart was racing in excitement.
He couldn’t help the smile that spread across his face. Dean sounded so young, so innocent. He only let himself get like this when he was talking to Cas. That’s when the wall came down. “Yes.”
“Not really,” Crowley said smoothly. “And after all that, after you made something of yourself, got off the streets and started making a, what would they call it… a positive impact on the world…” He trailed off, snorting and looking Dean up and down. Dean scowled back at him, but let a cold smile slip onto his face before Crowley went on. “After all that you fucked a Don.”
Anger was starting to take over now, his blood boiling as he stared fixedly away from Sam and Cas, eyes burning into the wall.
Dean gulped at that and looked at the floor. She wasn’t right. Lies made a helluva lot better. He pulled her into a hug, his mind spinning. There were so many lies in his life. And there were some he could come clean about, some he had to come clean about… but there were some he’d been waiting years to come out with. So maybe he could start there.
He pulled back his blood-soaked shirt from his shoulder and looked more closely at the wound. Neither cut was nearly as deep as he’d thought they were, and he rotated his shoulder a couple times, nothing there was a sharp stab each time, but he could still move it.
“I know I told you it’s a shit drink that’s a weak replacement for coffee,” he went on, grateful for Cas’ responses to his words, desperate to fill his mind with something other than the memory that had overpowered him, “but I might have been lying. It’s actually pretty damn good. And since Christmas is coming up soon I bought some.”
He cut off as another wave crashed on the shore, lapping up toward him and soaking his jeans. It was freezing but it grounded him, bringing him back to the cold, windy beach and away from the dungeon in the bunker.
Some of the guys decided to stay up and wait to see if Benny got a rose or not. If they had one more person to worry about or not. But Cas was beat.
He finished the drink and set in on the counter before calling their name, then he returned to the cash register. Ash handed the other customer their drink and the three of them were left alone in the coffee shop.
Cas chuckled bitterly, and this time a tear did escape his eyes, tracking slowly down his face. Dean watched it in fascination, tempted to wipe it away but afraid of ruining it’s journey. “I never thought- dammit, Dean,” he said softly.
Cas let his gaze slip slowly away from Dean and looked to Jay. His eyes were drifting back and forth between Dean and Cas, but after a second, his eyes landed permanently on Cas. “We need you to learn this too, Castiel. We only have about an hour until you guys need to be in hair and makeup.”
He stood up, blushing when he noticed for the first time that he was naked, and walked around the room. There wasn’t much in the bedroom, just their clothes tucked in a little closet.
“Cas, angel, please I need you to wake up,” he whispered into Cas’ ear, shaking him slightly. It never worked when he was violent. As much as he wanted to shake Cas until he snapped out of it, shout at him until he came back to him, it never accomplished anything. All that got him was a bruised jaw and a tearful, regretful husband the next morning.
He stepped forward, his breath settling and becoming smooth before he struck her on the temple with her own weapon. Her eyes rolled back in her head and her mouth dropped open. For just a second, she stood there, swaying, Then she crumpled to the dirty ground.
would be the understatement of the century. But he was Dean fucking Winchester, it wasn’t like he was going to advertise his dirty little secret.
“I’ll-” A strong wind attacked the beach, stealing the words from his mouth, so he ran forward til he was right in front of Cas. Too close to Cas. “I’ll have you,” he whispered.
Without thinking, he got out from the car and walked down the hill to the beach. He chose a rock on the edge of the sand to sit on, not wanting to venture further toward the ocean.
He craned his neck up again to see a soft smile on Cas’ face. As he watched, it became more devious, more snarky. That emotion looked good on Cas, even though he almost never wore it.
“What the fuck? Just cuz you’re filming this shit doesn’t mean you don’t step in… what the fuck?” he repeated in disbelief.
The line went dead and Dean hung his head. It was all too perfect. It fit too well, it didn’t feel real.
“And it really,” the man glanced at his wife, then back at them, “It really works? I mean how much older are you?”
Dean let out a little huff--Cas had to push back that damn smile again--and then took Cas’ offered arm, leaning into him slightly. He nodded to an older couple standing in the corner. The woman had a floor length red gown on, completely with a sparkling diamond necklace wrapped around her neck.
Cas gulped, his eyes going wide. Jay pointed out the various releases on their clothing, tips for getting it off easily, and then left them to practice, his trained eyes watching them carefully.
“Yeah,” Cas responded. “Didn’t really used to be. But my ex… well, it doesn’t matter. They’re amazing.”
He ran his fingers absentmindedly over the line of suits in Cas’ closet before pulling on jeans and a flannel from his own. Then he left through the door after Cas.
Dean’s face lit up like it always did when he talked about the shelter. He wet his lips the answered, “Yeah. It really did. We made $7,000 more than our goal and there was lots of press there. If we follow it up… we should get all eight women into apartments by the end of the month.”
Dean clapped him on the shoulder and passed him one of the sleds. They were huge, meant for two people. The underneath was slick, primed for speed. Sam had wanted more basic ones, but Dean had insisted. If they were doing this stupid Christmas thing, they were at least doing it right.
It had been a few weeks since the case. Sam hadn’t mentioned it once, true to his wishes, but he knew it couldn’t last long. Every time he and Cas were in a room together Sam looked at him with a soft glance that almost always turned pained. Sam’s words echoed in his head,
Cas’ could only nod, the song became foggy and distant and the lights danced around him again. He felt his breathing pick up again and he looked down, blurry eyes making out his shaking hands.
Dean laughed and after a second they both joined in. “That’s better than going crazy,” he said nonchalantly. “I’m sure she appreciated a little silence.”
Cas’ tear-filled eyes swam in his vision as he lifted the metal to his skin. His hands were more steady now, but there was still a slight quiver that made the silver seem to dance and bend before his eyes. So he squeezed them shut, taking a deep breath and letting it out.
“Alright, my name’s Jay,” the coach said, slapping his hands together. He wasn’t bad looking, Cas mused softly, grounding himself more. “We have about an hour before you guys are supposed to get some sort of lunch, and then another two hours after that before call time. Which is plenty of time to learn about a two minute dance.”
He glared up at Benny who just shrugged and gestured at his claimed top bunk before jumping off it and rummaging through his suitcase.
The sun was hanging lower in the sky now. Like it knew they were here, watching it. Cas pulled Dean in tighter to him as they watched it slip lower down, colors exploding across the horizon.
He got his hands ready, letting go of the rope he was still holding tight around his wrists. “Well he’s dead. And he’s never coming back.” His jaw ached with every word, but it paid off. As soon as the words left his mouth her demeanor shifted completely. She narrowed her eyes and let out an almost feral growl before lunging forward, striking him across the face.
He looked back to Cas, who finally raised his watery eyes to meet Dean’s, standing next to the other side of the bed to face him. “Cas, what’s she talking about?”
The other guys moved sluggishly after him, sitting up and rubbing their eyes before getting a change of clothes out. He half expected them to sleep in their tuxes… at least they weren’t that sloppy.
“I-” Dean took a deep breath and pushed himself against the brick wall. It was cold outside, but not unbearably. Still, a coldness was seeping through his limbs even as he started sweating more than before. “I want to tell you what I was going to tell you in Purgatory.”
“Castiel?” The guy had said it like it was a totally normal name, not something out of the goddamn bible.
All three of them visibly relaxed, and Sam reached into his case to grab whatever he was going to show them. And Dean could have left it there. Hell, he probably
The cold air bit into them the second they stepped out into the busy New York street. Cas wrapped his coat tighter around himself and slipped Dean’s arm through his own.
A million emotions crowded into Dean’s heart. Joy, love, happiness, but mainly confusion. “Then what’s wrong?”
He looked down at the handprint again and fit his hand into it. It shouldn’t have still been wet. Not now. But it was, sticking slightly to Dean’s fingers.
Dean barely had time to take him in before he was crashing into him, his arms wrapping around the angel and holding him tightly to his chest. After a second, he remembered to breathe, and he took in Cas’ familiar scent that was now surrounding him.
He switched the blade to his wounded arm and gripped it tightly, wincing as the tendons moaned under the fractured skin. Then he slowly dug the knife in, this time taking his time. He could feel his skin being torn apart, and with each new drop of blood that appeared along the cut, he saw Cas.
Dean went to the producers and started making a list of different foods he wanted ordered. Garth went and sat by the pool, dipping his feet in without even rolling up his jeans. And Cas? He went upstairs to find his book, the one form of entertainment allowed in.
“There’s some great guys here, for sure. I don’t know how many of them are really Lisa’s type… but, you know, I think she could find someone out of this group.”
“I remember,” he said with a wink. Shit, he was gonna have to turn that off whenever he wasn’t around Lisa.
The gun he’d tucked in his waistband (despite Dean’s protests) felt cold against his skin, and he reached back for it without thinking. Dean glanced down at the weapon and his eyes widened. Still, he rolled his shoulders back and glanced around the alley, his eyes narrowing as quickly as they’d opened up.
he immediately corrected. Cas hadn’t picked anything out. This wasn’t real. Cas wasn’t his, those lips kissing him hadn’t been his, the weight over him, so safe, so warm, hadn’t been real.
Once they were out of the room, Cas’ mind started to clear a little more, and he looked around, blinking. He could do this. He’d be fine. Just a duet… at least he hadn’t gotten the solo act.
Lisa wrapped her arms around him then pulled back, nodding and smiling to his words. She laid a hand on the lamp and Dean thought he could see her say “thank you,” before bursting into laughter again.
Cas was silent. Completely silent. Not even his breathing made a sound. After he hadn’t responded or even moved for a while, Dean shifted and looked up at him. His eyes were gleaming, swimming with tears. None of them spilled over the edge though, just made his blue eyes shine in the dark.
Dean whipped around and staggered to his feet, water pooling around his ankles before it disappeared. He rubbed his eyes as if the thing in front of him were a mirage, a cruel trick being played on him but no-
“But maybe I’m starting to believe it. Maybe I’m starting to believe that I’m not complete shit. I still am. God, you didn’t know- But that’s the point, isn’t it? You did know. You fucking knew every goddamn fucked up thing I ever did and you still,” his voice broke and he cleared his throat, desperately holding back the tears burning behind his eyes.
Because, yeah. Maybe he would get sent home. Or maybe it wouldn’t work with Lisa. But she was sweet and sexy and he got free drinks tonight no matter what.
“We got-” he paused, as if to reconsider. As if every word wasn’t carefully weighed before it was spoken. “I got caught up in something. And they took Dean. He’s alive, though.”
“Yeah.” He grinned as she shrugged his jacket off from her shoulders (he hadn’t even realized she was still wearing it) and draped it over him. Then she pinned the rose to his lapel and pulled him in for a short hug.
Lamp guy still had barely uttered a word. He was closest to the door since he was getting out first, and he just stared out the window, letting the conversation pass by without him.
But that didn’t mean he wasn’t gonna try. That he wasn’t gonna enjoy the ride. Hell, the free food was half the reason he’d signed up.
“Well, shit, kid,” he said finally. “I’m sorry,” he stopped for a minute, as if holding back tears. “I’m sorry you had to go through that.”
All the guys started making their way over and Cas followed, glancing up briefly at the sign on the building. Squinting against the sun, he could make out the word “Nightclub” in big block letters.
“Cas-” he immediately broke off. He didn’t know what it was about tonight. Why he felt so comfortable next to the angel, why the room felt so peaceful, so hopeful, why he thought he could actually have this--but he wanted to tell him. He could tell him.
Cas’ weight was warm and steady behind him, and Dean let himself relax even as his adrenaline spiked.
“Get changed. Bathroom’s down the hall to the right,” he sipped from the iced coffee in his hand and cocked his hip. “Then the real fun starts.”
“Hey,” Caitlin said, her tone suddenly shifting. “That thing,” she paused, turning to face him. “Were you scared?”
Dean didn’t know what he’d expected to find at the hotel. The five-star suites on the show were always so nice, every detail catered toward the contestants.
There was a thread with Claire. He opened it and nearly lost himself, the tears hot and heavy behind his eyes, ready to escape. But he didn’t let them. Dean offered Claire advice, if he had to guess it was about Kaia. Told her just to talk to her about it. Told her that it didn’t have to be awkward now that she was back from the dead. Told her to grab onto any happiness she could find and never let go.
“No, really, man. What’s the lamp for?” Dean folded his arms across his chest and let his weight fall onto one leg.
The footsteps came to a halt and Dean resisted the urge to turn his head to see who had entered the room behind him.
Hannah nodded and set down a clipboard she’d been holding. “Thank you, Dean. If you’ll go through that door back there,” she pointed behind the chair he was sitting in, “The other guys are waiting. Lisa will be in as soon as she’s done greeting people. Feel free to help yourself to a drink, but remember that you can only have two drinks an hour. Food is in the kitchen.”
She glanced up, and to her credit, gave no sign of recognition. “Yes, it is. And you are…” she trailed off, with a quaint raise of one brow.
The group cheered and Cas cast a side-eye at the rest of the group, seeing only Michael not clapping. Dick.
Their steps echoed off the walls as they left the din of car horns and squealing tires and entered the relatively quiet alley behind the venue.
“You’re gonna fall off if you sit like that, man.” He cleared his throat again, pointedly not looking at Sam, and reached for Cas’ legs. “You gotta wrap ‘em around up to the front like this.”
Cas finally looked away, looking at Sam thoughtfully. Then his entire body seemed to sag in defeat and he sank down into the chair behind him. “He can stay.”
“Benny’s a great guy,” Dean said immediately. “We have a lot in common, and I think we both feel a lot more relaxed now that we know not everyone here is an enemy.”
“So,” Chris went on, twirling the envelope in his hands, “Have an awesome week. Enjoy your time with Lisa…” he glanced off at the producers for a thumbs up to keep going, “And I hope to see you all at the next rose ceremony.”
The sounds were the worst part though. He never saw them in connection with the visions--those were always silent--but they still rang in his ears. It was mostly at night, but sometimes he’d be walking down the street with Sam, on some case or rather, and see someone that looked like one of the souls that he had-
His heart was pounding in his chest but he didn’t dare look back. He knew if he did, he would crumple to the ground. His legs would just give out and he would take whatever punishment John deemed necessary. So he just walked. Got behind the wheel and tore away, his throat dry and his hands shaking but his heart at peace.
Another day. Another customer. Another overpriced cup of coffee that was so full of milk and sugar and flavor that it shouldn’t even count as coffee.
The silence that blanketed the room was heavy, suffocating, but Sam didn’t break it. He just kept looking at him, his eyes sincere but devoid of pity. Just ready to take whatever he said next and move on with it. And he was grateful for it.
He burst out into the bright sunlight, collapsing on the ground, leaning against the Impala. It hadn’t even lasted long. Why was he so upset? He’d been there for less than a day.
Jack took a deep breath in and then his eyes lit up in two golden circles. Dean felt some of the crushing weight that was on him lift just from that and the world seemed to stand still for just a minute, pain fading away to hope.
Cas nodded mutely and set the hot chocolate on the counter before hopping down. He took Dean’s hand in his and led him out to the balcony overlooking the small lake.
“I guess they’ll have to get the money,” his voice was still soft, but he let a slight edge creep into it.
She ran her eyes over all of them, connecting with Dean for a second before moving on. When she’d dragged it out just long enough to be awkward, she held the rose a little closer to her chest and said, “Castiel.”
He looked back at Cas, a desperate question in his eyes. But Cas didn’t look at him, just cast his eyes down, his expression lost.
Cas nodded and turned back to the food, so Dean took that as his cue to leave. To leave and finally get some one-on-one time with Lisa. He had to find her, or why was he even here? If he didn’t make it past tonight… well, if he didn’t make it past tonight he wouldn’t even have the chance to fall in love. And he was here to fall in love.
The questions were boring. How was he feeling? Some retroactive stuff like, what did he think when he walked in? How did Lisa look today?
“We stopped at this little roadside stand and got hot chocolate. Dean tried to make me think it was magical or some shit. Then we got to this giant hill. I mean,” he gestured to the steep hill behind him, “This thing has nothing on it. It was freezing, too, so the snow was almost ice. We pull up to the hill, and Dean pops the trunk, and in it there’s just these two,” Sam starts laughing then, and after a minute, Dean joins him. There’s a sadness behind it, too though. And acknowledgement of how fucked up that situation really had been. “These two trash can lids.”
He drove for a while before he came back to his senses. Before what he’d done really sunk in. He could picture John talking to Mary, the disgust in his voice obvious. He honestly didn’t know what his mom would think. But at this point he didn’t care. There was only one thing on his mind. Only one infuriating angel he could think about. And he was here. Alive. In Heaven.
The producers had warned them not to be shy in holding back their reactions. They were all already miked, and while Lisa wouldn’t be able to hear much through the limo, the fans seeing this in a few months would appreciate the reactions.
Dean moved next to him, shifting slightly so they were both facing Crowley. He felt Dean pull the knife he kept inside his jacket out and let it hang loosely at his side.
Dean fumbled with his shirt, and when he got it over his head, Cas was standing by the door. “What are you doing?”
“Of course.” Another pause. Another well of unspoken questions. Then the one Sam knew would be coming. From each and every person he called. “Can you bring him back?”
His hands were loose around the wheel, and he could see out of the corner of his eyes that he’d gotten a little bit of blood under one nail. It glittered slightly in the fading light, taunting him, and he tried unsuccessfully to dig it out. Right when he was about to pull over and fix it, a soft buzzing pulled his attention away. His frustration mounting, he pulled his phone from his pocket.
Just then, the doorbell rang and they let him go meet the other guys in the living room, a few of them also trickling in from interviews. Garth went to get the card and stood at the front of the room, pulling everyone in with his magnetic yet ridiculous energy. Cas liked Garth. He was one of the only non-crazies in the house.
Sam smiled in spite of himself, smiled through the tears he hadn’t realized were streaking down his cheeks. “That would mean a lot to him.” After a brief pause, he kept talking. He didn’t know why this man made it so easy, why he felt so safe with someone he’d never even known. “He was applying for a job. Did he tell you? Is that what he called about? He was gonna be a mechanic.” He laughed bitterly. “A normal life.”
A limo pulled up to the curb but Dean looked up at him, and as so often the case with them, he understood exactly what he needed. “We’ll walk,” Cas said to the valet.
Standing with a smirk on her face was Meg. Well… it looked like Meg. But one glance at her told Dean it couldn’t be. There was something ancient about her eyes, something immensely powerful that no mere demon could possess.
He took one step closer to Cas, so close they were almost touching, and steadied himself. “I won’t” his voice broke and he cursed silently to himself before dropping a hand onto Cas’ shoulder and trying again. “I can’t lose you again.”
A few of them were fidgeting nervously, but most of them were peaking past the wall, looking at where Lisa sat in the front row.
“And you are…?” he responded, mostly out of politeness. If it were up to him he would have gotten the hell out of that kitchen by now. Maybe he could find Lisa; he didn’t have all night anymore.
Benny smiled at that, listening to Dean go on about how he’d fixed her up, built her from the ground up. He left out everything before she’d gotten totaled, and Benny didn’t ask. He didn’t need the cameras getting that just yet. And he was extremely aware that every word he was saying was being recorded.
Jake turned and looked at the producer and cameraman. He held up his hands like he was waiting for them to do something, but they both just stood there.
That wasn’t to say he didn’t approve of their relationship. He often said he’d never seen Dean happier.
his mind finished the lie. “Just,” he tried again. “Just promise you’ll stay, this time. Promise you won’t do anything stupid.”
“28,” he said, his eyebrows drawing together. If this conversation lasted longer than Crowley would have real reason to hurt him.
Then he walked back to the car, trying to gather himself. Because he had to tell another lie. And he wasn’t ready for Sam to be pissed. Wasn’t ready for his brother to think that he wanted to sacrifice his son, when that wasn’t true. Couldn’t be true. And now Cas didn’t know either.
“Dean,” Jack started, and Dean looked back at the floor. He knew what was coming. He’d been prepared for this. But he still couldn’t do it. “What made him happy?”
“I’m afraid you’re no prize next to the angel who played God. Sweet of you to say though,” she said. Then she started to fade, Cas with her.
Sam walked over and reached down a hand to help Dean to his feet. Dean took it, keeping his eyes down and trying to ignore how hot his face had gotten.
But for him? Lies were stopping him from being with the love of his life. They were stopping him from being honest with his brother. They were setting him on the path to ruin relationships with every member of his family.
“Got any classics?” Dean asked, his mind drifting back to his Baby. That was the hardest thing to leave behind. Not the job, not his family (okay, maybe), but his car…
He pulled Cas into a tight hug and then stepped back, grinning down at them as Dean immediately took Cas’ hand in his again.
The guys cheered as Chuck stepped forward, clipboard in hand. “Alright,” he shouted over the crowd. “Everyone up on the stage. Get loose, we wanna see some good dancing up there. You have three minutes to show Lisa what you got, and then we’ll decide which routine you’ll be doing.”
With Cas pressed up against him and his cheeks flaming red, he finally looked over at Sam and Jack. Sam’s smirk hadn’t faded, and Jack was watching them with a pleasant smile.
Dean woke up and immediately wished he could go back to sleep. His jaw ached, and when he tried to shift it there was a sharp pop so he decided to let it be. Rope scratched against his tied hands, and he struggled to shrug his shoulder against the bindings and ease some of the tension filling him.
Lisa took a second to gather herself, shooting a glare in Naomi's direction, and then nodded once toward the limo.
“What happened?” Sonny’s voice was steady but it had already dropped a little, something thick and broken behind it.
And more than anything in his life, Cas had been the one to help that trauma fade to background noise. Of course Sam had too. Or he’d tried. But Dean couldn’t really let Sam in. And sharing memories of Hell with Sam felt cruel, when his brother’s experience in Hell had been a million times worse. Some of that pain had been taken by Cas though.
Dean felt his cheeks heat up and his throat started to close. But he wouldn’t stand silently again. He couldn’t.
It wasn’t enough. He was a stupid fucking idiot who couldn’t be happy. Who would never be happy knowing that somewhere out there Cas was alive, Cas wanted him, and he had fucked things up too badly for him to ever come back.
his mind said. A constant loop, trying to pull him away from Cas. He wanted to say it out loud, to force himself to see it. Instead, he breathed softly, “Cas.”
Her smile slipped fractionally but she nodded. Dean instinctively looked to the side where the cameras were and saw a producer (Naomi, if he remembered right) hiding a smile behind one hand as she nudged a cameraman and pointed at Jake.
All told, 14 guys were going on the date. 14 guys sharing time with Lisa. A recipe for the perfect night.
The wedding had been beautiful. Maybe not by typical standards, but Dean had loved every second of it. They’d been in the woods out behind Donna’s cabin. Dean just wanted close friends and family. But way more people came than they had planned for. Hunters they’d helped out, even some people they’d saved. And in the end, Dean was grateful to look out at the huge crowd in the evening light and see them all smiling back at him and Cas.
Cas tilted his head and Dean’s laughter redoubled. He had thought he would be angry. Cas was alive, and he hadn’t even dropped in to let them know he was okay. But he didn’t care. Not in this moment. Because Cas was standing right in front of him. Cas was real.
Dean gulped under his stare but held his eyes. “You’re family,” he said weakly, wishing that goddamn phrase even
“What the hell are we doing?” Cas muttered, hoping it was quiet enough that the mic pack wouldn’t pick it up. There were no cameras in here, at least, thank God.
“Ready?” he asked, and Dean wasn’t sure if he was talking to the cameras or to them. He found himself nodding anyway.
That one was deeper. It split open the vein, causing blood to spray from his arm, covering his clothes in red. Dean let a small smile curl at the corners of his mouth. The blood didn’t look like his life. It looked like his prison. And it was leaving. So he could be free.
“Listen to me, though. He’s gone. Chuck is defeated, and yet the universe goes on. He has no power over us. Do you understand?”
Cas appeared slowly, his form materializing slowly from the shimmering air. He blinked several times and looked around slowly. A soft smile spread across his face as he saw Jack and Sam and then he looked at Dean and his face froze. It was still half of a smile, but it was also terrified.
“Should I read the solo up to the groups of four, or the other way?” she asked seriously, looking over their heads at Chuck.
“Are you still there?” Cas asked, the sound of a car door shutting ringing through the tiny speaker on his phone.
“Cas,” Dean cut in. “If you make it past tonight, that is… which-” he shook his head and then schooled his face, remembering to play nice. “Cas is better, is all.”
“Gentleman,” Chris said, rubbing his hands together as he walked into the room. “How’s it going? Liking the house?”
“Well, I’m not sure that’s a good thing,” he said, mainly because he didn’t know how to respond. Yeah, he’d changed. After the sixth or seventh apocalypse it was kind of expected.
Dean always knew he’d go out at the edge of a blade or the barrel of a gun. He hadn’t thought he’d get to choose which one.
“He's-” he started. He couldn’t say it. Otherwise it might slip away. He’d hadn’t even mentioned Cas’ name since it happened… it hurt too much. It hurt too much to think about what Cas had said. To think about how he’d just stood there, the world collapsing all around him.
Cas smiled and nodded with the rest of the guys, his eyes wandering around, staring pointlessly at the other contestants.
“Mom, can you give us a minute?” His eyes never left John, but he saw her nod out of the corner of his eye before disappearing back into the house. John stepped outside and closed the door, gesturing to a set of deck chairs.
Dean’s next words left his head and he just nodded, his mind racing. Was she going to send him home? Or get one of the executive producers to talk to him? Did he break a rule he didn’t even know about?
He passed through the small hallway into the gorgeous room where a large group of guys were waiting. From the looks of it, they had been the last limo.
“The Empty?” Jack asked quietly, and Dean jerked his face up to look at him. Jack had known. He’d known about the deal. Of course he had… it was to save him.
The strippers on stage started their dance as the contestants started coming to life, realizing what was happening. Cas watched the stage for a minute--cowboys weren’t really his thing--then turned curiously to see the rest of the group’s reactions.
Dean jerked back and then came to meet his eyes, afraid he would get that glassy faux-lucid look that Cas got whenever these episodes hit.
But now that he’d noticed it, it was all he could look at. That bright red handprint standing out starkly against his jacket. It was perfect, really. Not a drop out of place. Just a handprint and nothing else. That was all he had left.
Lisa was a good sport, staggering dramatically back with a look of mock horror on her face. It was all forced though, and when he finally walked up to greet her, she gave him a look like she wanted to run. She gave him a quick hug and exchanged a few words before gesturing for him to go inside.
“Crowley,” he said, fighting to keep his voice even. Getting jumped in the alley had been one thing. He’d reacted instinctively, immediately reverting to who he’d been all those years ago. But now the pressure was more drawn out, his nerves stretched to the extreme. And adrenaline wasn’t gonna cut it.
Dean finally let his eyes fall from the screen and he looked into his brother’s worried face. Not into his eyes, not yet. Just into his open expression. Into the love that was so free of judgement but so full of pain. Sam had lost people, too. Sam had lost Eileen. But Sam wasn’t weak.
When he was out of sight, she held up her hands in a shrug and looked around for a producer who was already coming to take the lamp. She gave him a quick kiss on the cheek and exchanged a few words and then her attention was back at the limo.
He ignored the disapproving stare on the P.A.‘s face at his word-choice and led the way through the crowd and up the stairs.
“I will, Cas,” he said forcefully, his heart pounding in his throat. He could do this. He’d just killed an ancient witch for fuck’s sake. He could do this.
Dean shrugged and looked down at the outfit. “Wild West was fu-” he glanced at the cameraman behind Cas, “Friggin’ awesome, dude. Don’t tell me you’ve never seen a Western?” he added with a lopsided grin.
Dean got on the sled and looked anywhere but at his brother and kid while Cas climbed on behind him. Cas pulled his knees to his chest, almost not touching Dean at all.
He didn’t blame Cas, he’d gotten involved with this, and he knew full well what the risks were. He’d chosen Cas. Or, really, Cas had chosen him. He might play the tough guy to everyone else, but both he and Cas had no confusion over who was in charge. He belonged to Cas. He had to belong to Cas so fuck any consequences that came with it.
“No, Dean,” he could see his brother’s frustration mounting. “You’re poisoned, a djinn got you. I killed it, but you didn’t wake up. You have to wake up.”
“I haven’t heard from Dean in days. Cas,” There was a soft thud on the other end. Sam must have sat back down. He probably had run a hand through his hair, too. “Please just tell me he’s with you.”
The producer moved on and the rest of the guys followed him while Dean and Benny shuffled into the room, followed by the other three.
The other guys trickled down slowly, clapping Dean on the back and helping themselves to eggs, bacon, and fresh coffee.
He was gone. Not dead yet, thank God. But Cas needed a plan for tonight. Because otherwise Dean would die. They would both die.
“In the flesh.” She said it flatly, without any sass or attitude. And that only served to make Dean’s skin crawl more.
He was the exact kind of guy Cas had expected to find here. Arrogant, unfeeling, fuckboy vibes practically rolling off him. He was a dick. But Cas had plenty of experience with dicks.
“I know, I just-” he took another deep breath and let out a heavy sigh. “You have to promise me you won’t hate me. Or leave me.”
Dean grit his teeth but nodded. They did have a show to make. But there was something about Naomi… he just couldn’t stand her.
“Right,” Balthazar said with an eye roll. Cas wanted to pull a gun then, a knife, anything to make him take this seriously. But Balthazar had never been easily fazed. “You just married a man twenty years younger than you for his winning personality.”
When he popped Baby’s trunk, he couldn’t help but roll his eyes at the contents. Sam and Jack really knew no end to their family Christmas activities. It wasn’t like he was really mad, of course. This was the first Christmas they were really together, the first Christmas with no Chuck, no world-ending crisis, and if they wanted to do corny shit like sledding, then he was all in.
Sam ran a hand through his hair and leaned forward. “We’re having a- I don’t know how much you know about hunters. But we’re giving him a hunter’s funeral. In a few days. I know he would have wanted you there.”
Sam’s face fell, still riddled with confusion and hurt, but a fraction of understanding starting to dawn. Dean didn’t care, though. None of it mattered. He should have been free. Should have been gone. Still should be.
Dean could see himself in Cas’ arms again, his head pressed into his shoulder, firm arms holding him tightly. He could taste Cas’ lips against his own, could feel his steady weight and warmth, his scent filling his nose. He could see Sam’s eyes widen in understanding when he stepped into the room.
He pulled Dean’s chair out and gently guided him down with his hands on his shoulders before pushing the chair in for him. He took his seat right next to Dean, and then sat in silence as the rest of the table filled up.
He snorted to himself and dropped his bag on the floor next to the small twin-sized bed. This was just for an afternoon. Tonight… well tonight he got to actually meet Lisa.
Dean took one look back at Cas. Looked into his eyes, the way he stared at him, the unguarded trust. He wanted it. But he had a job to do. So he let go. The living room faded around him, Sam with it. The last thing he saw before everything went black was Cas, tears in his eyes as he reached for Dean.
He grit his teeth together and breathed sharply through his nose. “So, you his daughter? That your brother that’s six feet under?”
Cas thought bitterly, as the producers explained how there would be a knock on the door, Chris was coming to do the date card, blah blah blah. No one actually fell in love on this show. And if they did… then it was pure chance.
He held the phone to his ear and waited on baited breath as it rang. Once. Twice. Then a soft click.
And Sam wasn’t having the wake alone. He couldn’t do it alone or he would throw himself right into that goddamn fire and burn right next to his brother.
He noted a few familiar faces. Benny was sitting on the couch striking up a conversation with a shorter guy with brown hair. Lamp guy was in the corner by himself, sipping on a cocktail already.
“I think it’s really amazing. What you’re doing for all these women…” he trailed off and Dean nodded slowly, his eyes glittering with amusement. The guy coughed into a handkerchief and then went on, “it must be nice getting to be around them all the time too.”
Most of them were looking incredulously at the stage, laughing nervously and cheering while their eyes opened to the fact that
When he looked at the next name, he frowned thoughtfully. Sonny… that was the name of the man who ran that boy’s home. Dean hadn’t ever told him what really happened there. Sure, he’d given him some story about a girl and a life away from Dad and some semblance of happiness. But there was something else. Something big.
Cas refocused his attention on Garth, who had finished the list of names and was now flipping the card over to read the date aloud.
On the other hand, he could easily see her with some of the guys here. Benny was great, and so was Cole. Mick was nice, if a little nerdy.
“I didn’t-” Cas started. “I never thought-” He stopped again, looking at Dean with an expression of pure wonder.
A song Cas didn’t know started playing and Garth opened the buttons on his bachelor costume ever so slightly as he got into his routine. Next to him, Dean chuckled appreciatively and whispered, “
Cas made a soft sound of surprise and Dean immediately felt arms wrap around his stomach as Cas’ face pressed into his shoulder. He looked straight ahead, letting the wind whip through his face and sting his eyes. But his heart moved from frantically pounding in his chest to leaping into his throat.
He sneered up at her, trying to gauge how closely she was paying attention. Then he tried to decide how quickly he could get a hand free and strangle her. Probably not fast enough.
A new song started and the lights started up again, this time in sync with the song. As they all watched, a line of men in cowboy hats (and heeled boots too, figures) walked out to the front of the stage, matching the steps to the beat.
“This is my brother,” came the response. Sam cleared his throat again. “I’ll be over there in a few, okay? We can get a game plan together, and then we’re getting my brother out. We’re getting him out, alive.”
Cas gulped and silently cursed. Great. Panic attack on national TV and in front of De- Lisa--check. His Bachelorette Bucket List was going great.
Dean just scoffed and grabbed his suitcases before shoving one under the bed and pulling a pair of gray sweats and a loose black t-shirt out.
“Cas,” Dean breathed as he reached him. And Cas almost let a smile slip out, just at that one simple word. The smile he reserved for himself, when no one else could see him. The smile that he even hid from Dean, most of the time anyway.
“How do you think that went?” she asked. “And, I’ll remind you since it’s been a few days since you did one of these, please include the question in your answer.”
Cas was lying to him again. And he’d known. He’d known what Dean was going to say and he didn’t want to hear it. Dean bit his lip and let his head fall against the brick wall.
Chuck was there waiting for them, and he gestured to a big building at the corner of the busy street they’d gotten off of and waved them forward, the whole time talking rapidly into the mic by his mouth.
As soon as he saw the name, it all melted away. All the frustration, the nerves that he would never admit still wracked him whenever he killed a man, the sound of tires rolling up still echoing in his mind. All of it gone, replaced with a single name:
Dean sought for the words to describe it. To tell Cas that they’d been happy. That they’d had everything. That they’d been everything to each other. But he couldn’t.
“Wow. You sound like you don’t even care. And here you go on and on about how much you love this kid-”
Neither of them looked too disappointed and he glanced between them, eyes narrowing. “What did you do?”
Cas walked up to her, his face still serious with maybe the barest hint of a smile at the corners of his lips.
Dad would laugh. Would say he was a weak fag who was getting worked up over nothing. Would say that giving up was the most selfish and cowardly thing Dean could do. And maybe it was selfish. Maybe it proved how much of a coward he was. He was past caring.
He did, with a quick nod and salute, and Dean finally let his eyebrows relax from where they’d risen halfway up his forehead.
“Your mom-” Dean started to repeat but trailed off. “So you brought her a fucking lamp? From the hotel?”
Dean waited for the footsteps to fade completely before jerking his hands against the ropes. They were tight, professional. But they were also rope, which meant he should be able to get out of them given time. He wondered briefly why they didn’t use zip ties or even handcuffs, then he turned his attention back to the task.
When they broke apart a second later, he couldn’t stop the grin splitting his face, the happiness bursting through him, clearing his mind of thoughts.
Everything was fading, his vision growing blurry. He felt impossibly cold, even as his cheeks grew hot. His breaths were coming a little faster, too, each one racking his lungs and shaking his body.
He shivered a little and turned his attention back to the ropes cutting into his skin. After a minute, he started to feel the bonds loosen a little. Before he could slip a hand out the echoes of footsteps once again made him freeze. These were different though, lighter. He twisted his fingers painfully upward to grab the slack rope and make it look tight, and then straightened his shoulders, sitting still.
“Did-” Dean took a deep breath in and then started again with a new steel in his voice. “Did everything go okay?”
He barely reacted when Sam looked around frantically, crouching by his brother and shaking his shoulders, trying to see if he was okay.
In the bathroom, Cas slipped the thin material over his head, his chest starting to feel tight again. He made sure all the velcro was tight (he didn’t want it to slip before it was
Cas chose a simple black button down that tucked easily into a pair of tight blue jeans. Dean had tried to argue they were too tight for an occasion like this, but Cas had simply smirked and reminded him that choosing each other's outfits was his idea.
“D-dawg?” The voice sounded tired, as if he’d just got up. Sam glanced down at his own phone as saw the time. One in the morning. Shit. “Something wrong?”
Dean sighed in content and let his hands wander up from the snow to wrap around Cas and pull him toward the ground. Why they hadn’t been doing this all along, he had no idea. Cas was everything. Cas meant everything. So why couldn’t he and Cas have everything?
He let go of his hand and looked up at the other man as Jake moved on to greet lamp guy. He felt a shiver run up his spine as he met his eyes. His lips were barely curved up like he’d told a joke that only he found amusing. His dark eyes were cold and emotionless and Dean fought to hold his gaze, his eyes instead drifting up to his black hair cropped close to his head.
Dean pulled back and looked into Cas’ wide eyes, watching as he gulped and tried to gauge Dean’s state, his reaction that he’d never gotten to see.
To say his friends and family had been shocked when they found out he was submitting an audition to the goddamn
He didn’t remember drinking either, but a half-empty bottle of whiskey sat on the table and his head was pounding. His throat felt dry, and he swallowed, staggering to his feet to find water.
The music started up and they took the stage, the crowd going wild, Lisa in the front with a soft smile, her hands crossed over her legs as she leaned forward.
Dean grinned over at him and picked at the salad that the waiter had just brought. “We are so going out for burgers after this.”
Dean gulped and nodded, letting his head fall on Cas’ shoulder. The sun was fully above the horizon now, and it warmed his back as he leaned into Cas.
He just hoped to God they had beer and he wouldn’t have to drink this fruity shit for the next couple months.
His new visitor entered the room slowly, as if waiting for Dean to turn his head. When she finally entered his field of vision he felt white hot anger course through him. It was the girl from the alley. Stella, apparently.
