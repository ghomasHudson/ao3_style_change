work. “Dean’s sleeping if you want to know. He tends to fall asleep most of the time after we…”
Sam nods, liking the sound of pizza. "Alright. That sounds good."
With a crack of thunder, and the slight shaking of the bunker, Castiel is projecting out a shadow of his wings across the wall behind him. His once full shiny black wings, now weak, broken and pitiful, with the shadow of feathers falling off with each movement.
“Ugh, Dean.” Castiel breathes, as Dean starts sucking on his neck, leaving marks that unfortunately won’t stay for very long.
angel.” He assures him. “Or alternatively a star ornament instead of an angel one.”
While they've got a vast library of lore on the supernatural stored away I know the library of the bunker, Sam isn't sure they'll find anything here for sure. But he had promised Dean that they'd look.
But clearly if the victims are werewolves, it's not exactly any normal vampire killing.
“Well, whatever we watch, it’s most definitely
“Really?” Dean asks, folding his arms across his chest. “Doesn’t look like nothing.”
The article details the findings of multiple dead bodies scattered across town. All of them drained of their blood. Sounds like vampires.
"I thought Dean had said it's just a vampire they're hunting?" Jack asks.
And Sam has elected to ignore the fact that Dean will be pissed once they get back and find the library decorated for Christmas. That's not something he needs to worry about just yet. He'll worry about that later once Dean and Castiel return from their hunt.
Mary's right. They've searched through almost every book lining the shelves that has anything to do with vampires, and so far they've come up with nothing.
“So how are they?” Castiel asks, once he finally makes his way towards the others after he’s done cleaning up in the kitchen.
But now, with everyone seated around the table in the library, with all the food and drink set out in front of them, everyone - including Dean - has a very merry Christmas in the bunker.
placement of the tinsel.
Dean shrugs, before getting back to examining the bodies. "Maybe you're just imagining things, man."
Clearly becoming frustrated, Dean has to stop himself from throwing a punch at Sam in the hopes that it'll make him understand.
He's just glad that no one has decided to put on any Christmas music. Now
Castiel nods. “Well, yes. It did.” He says. He won’t deny that it
Castiel rolls his eyes at Dean's words. It really doesn't look as bad as Dean seems to think it does. And it's not like it's the end of the world to have a few decorations up.
, it's it's all available on YouTube! Not in the greatest quality, as it's all crappy VHS recordings, but they're still very much watchable. However, there is finally an account on YouTube that's posting every episode in HD quality
"Why not?" Sam frowns. "Don't you think it would be a nice thing to do? We've never been able to do it properly before." He says. "And mom, and Jack are up for it."
Sam takes the bag from Dean, following his brother and the angel into the kitchen, setting the bag down on the table with the rest, before the three of them sort through it all and pack it away.
hopes it means that they were at least okay.
her cooking.
Though now that he really thinks about it, this could be exactly what was up with that woman at the morgue. Maybe she could be this cobiescu vampire?
Dean nods. “Well, Cas, you don’t really
Truthfully, Sam is rather surprised that Dean doesn’t want to decorate the bunker. He would’ve thought that Dean would be up for it, but he guesses he was wrong. A least he’s up for a big feast on Christmas though. At least there’s
way? Why did it have to result in him dying in the end?
"W-well, yes but..." Dean trails off, not really having an answer to that.
“Sam, I hope you’re not planning on putting me on top of any Christmas trees.” Castiel says, narrowing his eyes at the youngest Winchester.
Sam shakes his head. He's never heard or come across anything like this before. What seems like a vampire that feeds on werewolves? "Usually? No." He says. "At least... not that I'm aware of."
Jack’s not left the bunker in weeks (at least as far as Dean knows), and Dean thinks it’s about time he goes out and gets some fresh air. The kid has been spending too much time inside watching any and every movie and TV show he can find on all of the streaming services they’ve got hooked up in the bunker.
Castiel looks over at Dean. "Dean..." He sighs, moving to stand closer to him. "That's not necessary."
"The hell?" Dean asks, as he stares at the box Sam just gave him. "
"No, Dean." Castiel says. "You're not ruining this for Jack or your mother."
loved you."
"Come on, Dean." Sam sighs. "It'll be our first
“Are you in a better mood now, Dean?” Castiel asks, once both he and Dean have cleaned up after their activities.
“Doesn’t mean you can’t be of more help.” Castiel says. “Could you at least get the rest of the stuff for burgers done while I cook the patties?”
use bedrooms to sleep in.”
down with."
when he doesn't want any Christmas decorations up, and Castiel is assuming that means a Christmas tree too.
While he’s at it, he decides he can bring some more food to Dean. Just in case he wakes up before he returns to their room and questions where he went off to. Maybe he can attempt to make a burger for Dean. Although, he’s not very skilled in cooking….
“Dean, you’re supposed to be helping me, not just sit there and watch!” Castiel says, facing away from the stove to stare at Dean who’s seated at the table in the kitchen sipping on a beer and being of not much help.
He searches through the boxes of dismantled trees for the one they'll get, setting the box in the trolley once he's found it.
decorating of any kind in the bunker. But they
get Castiel back, and then he can tell him what he never got the chance to.
They don't fancy staying out for too long, especially around this time of year when practically every store is super busy. So they make their way around the supermarket as fast as they can, while grabbing everything they need plus a few extras and setting them down in the cart.
“Lunch is ready!” Dean calls out, wandering off out of the kitchen to round up everyone else, leaving Castiel to clean up the mess, and set everything up on the bench for the others to make their burgers the way they want.
But monsters that actually have no need to feed on humans at all, and live off the blood of other monsters instead? This is new to him.
Dean too shrugs. “Don’t know.” He says. “We can just flick through Netflix until we find something.”
Castiel tilts his head to the side. “A
"Hey, I
He's not sure
Castiel nods, relieved that Dean's agreed to drop it for now. He turns to Sam, giving him an apologetic look, before he's following Dean into the kitchen.
"Dean, you're making a mess." Castiel says, watching as Dean eats a large burger, sauce squirting out from between the bun onto the table, and sauce and mayo dripping down his chin.
"Will do." Sam says, before he's saying goodbye and hanging up.
“Hello, Sam.” Castiel says, standing awkwardly in the entryway to the library.
Dean frowns at Castiel's words. "Seriously?" He asks. "Come on, Cas! They'll be fine without us for a while."
Shaking Castiel off him proves to be a little difficult (which Dean should've expected), but he gets himself free from his angel's grip in the end, despite the initial struggle.
He's grown used to Dean's messy eating, but they're in a public place, he should at least try to not eat so messily.
much.” Dean says, as he scrolls through the selection of movies available. “Maybe a horror movie. What do you think?”
"I think we have almost everything." Jack says, looking from the shopping list, to the items in the cart as he mentally checks off each item. "It seems like we have everything except for a couple things."
Sam nods. If this is all they need, then they can go pay for everything then head home. "In that case let;s go pay for these then head home." He says. "Mom and Jack will have likely finished decorating by now."
"Cas." He chokes, looking up, tears streaming down his face. "I don't know if you can hear me, but…" He stops, trying to bring himself to say the words he should've said years ago. "I… I should've told you years ago. I… I love you. I've
"You got anything, Cas?" Dean asks, glancing over at the angel who's seated on the bed in their motel room surfing through his laptop for what could possibly be going on here.
“Cas, it’s okay.” Sam says. “You don’t need to apologize. Besides, it worked, right?”
Hell, this'll be Sam's first Christmas ever with their mom, and Dean's first since he was three years old.
Sam nods, getting up. “Okay, well I’ll go talk to mom and Eileen.” He says. “See if they have any ideas on what we should make… or at least attempt to make.”
Thing is, he's still not sure
Castiel sighs in frustration as he looks between the brothers. He's rather used to the brother's squabbling by now, but it doesn't make it any less frustrating when they do argue over something. Even when it's something that's really not that big of a deal.
Castiel can't say that he's surprised that Dean's decided to come in right this second. He
for going out to get Christmas decorations, but if he was being absolutely serious about it… well then he’ll make sure he doesn’t end up locking them out.
By the time lunchtime has rolled around, everything is done, and the table in the library is set, the kitchen is an absolute mess. But that’s a problem for later. They’ll deal with the mess after everyone has eaten. For now though, the hunters, the angel, and the young nephilim are getting ready for the Christmas lunch.
"I know." Dean sighs, dragging one of the chairs out from the table, sitting down. "Cas has already threatened me to leave them up. And I don't want to upset Jack." He says. "So they can stay, but I don't have to like them."
“Good huh?” He asks.
Sam looks confused at Castiel’s words, before he laughs, realizing what he had said and how it must’ve sounded to the angel. Castiel must’ve taken it as they put actual angels on top of Christmas trees.
"Wait..." Mary starts, visibly confused. "It doesn't sound like much of a case if the victims are werewolves."
Dean turns to him, feeling betrayed that his angel is on Sam's side. He was hoping that Cas would be on
He's never heard of anything like this. At least, not that he can recall. He's heard of and met a few monsters living off of other food sources instead of human by choice.
“Well... yeah we
Dean hums, burying his head in the crook of Castiel’s neck. “Mmm…. Food sounds good.” He says. “I want burgers. I’m hungry.”
be a bit of an issue at times....
Castiel doesn’t follow Dean to his room straight away like he’s been doing often. Instead he gives the older Winchester some time to himself, which is probably the best course of action to take. Let Dean have some time to calm down from his and Sam’s dispute, and then go to him. Preferably with food. Castiel is certain that Dean will want some food soon.
Castiel nods, guessing that that
Honestly, Dean wasn't too happy about getting up at fucking six in the morning, but Castiel had dragged him out of bed to help everyone prepare everything. Apparently everyone else was already up at five, except for him. Castiel had mentioned something about talking the others into letting him get at least another hour of sleep before getting him up.
He had hoped that this wouldn't happen for awhile yet, but from Dean's distraught state and the fading presence of the Empty, it has happened. Castiel is gone, and there's nothing they can do to get him back this time.
“No signs of your brother?” Eileen asks.
"Uh, I think five boxes should be enough." Sam says.
"Dean… I know you don't want all these up, but just think about Jack for a moment." Sam says. "It's his first Christmas, and we have to make it as nice as possible for him. And for mom."
"Sam, I like this one." Eileen says, walking towards the display of Christmas trees towards a medium sized dark green tree in particular. She turns to Sam, who's right behind her pushing a trolley full of decorations, snacks, and other items they've run out of in the bunker. "What do you think?"
He didn't get the chance to say the words back to him, and now…. Now he'll never get the chance to.
In the end, he just wants this all to be good for Jack and their mom. This is all for Jack and mom, and Sam is almost positive that Dean won't do anything to ruin this upon knowing who this is all really for.
"Dean..." Castiel sighs. "There's nothing wrong with them wanting to decorate the bunker for Christmas."
a week if not less to get everything set up before they return, so
Jack nods. Now he's just got to figure out which five he should make….
"Alright." He nods, looking over at Castiel. "Come on, Cas."
"I'd be more cheerful if I didn't have to get up so damn early." Dean mutters, cutting up apples.
Dean nods, moving closer to the bodies and looking them over. Castiel on the other hand, takes note of the way the lady looks a bit nervous.
"We are
With this confusing discovery, they're not sure if they really have a case here or not. But they need to do some research on the matter and figure out what the hell is going on here before they figure out what the hell they're going to do.
In all his many,
"Cas-" Dean starts, unsure of what to say. Not that he's able to get another word out anyway.
"Right, I'm gonna get something to eat, then..." Dean starts, trailing off as he finally gets a good look around the library.
"Uh, maybe you and Cas can go check it out?" Sam suggests.
“Uh, anyway…” Sam starts, figuring now is a good time for them to figure out what they’re going to do about the food for Christmas dinner. They can’t just leave Jody to do all the cooking and be the only one to bring food. Even though she is an amazing cook. “I know none of us here are fantastic cooks, but we’ve got to decide on what we’re going to make. We can’t just leave all the cooking for Jody.”
feel a little off about her.
If only this was all just some bad dream, and when he wakes up Cas will still be here. But when does he ever get what he wants? When do
"Well, I don't see why we can't." He finally says after a moments silence. "What's wrong with decorating the bunker? I don't see it as a bad thing."
“Mom, can you help Eileen and I hide these somewhere where Dean can’t find them?” Sam asks, once they’ve looked through everything, double checking that they’ve got what they paid for, and haven’t forgotten anything. “I’d hate for him to find it all and try and get rid of it all. He’s not too keen on the whole idea of decorating the bunker.”
And once everyone’s made themselves their burgers, they leave the kitchen, leaving Castiel alone to tidy everything up. Not that he minds them all leaving him to clean up the mess by himself though. It gives him something to do while they all have their lunch.
Sam falters, not exactly expecting that. "Y- you
they smell like.
“Hello, Dean.” Castiel smiles, as Dean stops next to him, setting a kiss on his cheek.
Then they're off on their way to go gank some vampires.

"Alright." Sam announces just as he gets up from his seat and pulls his phone out of his pocket. "I'm gonna go call Dean and give him the news."
what Castiel’s warning is if he even thinks about taking anything down. “You’ll lock me in the dungeon with no pie until Christmas is over.” He sighs, shaking his head. “But it doesn’t mean I have to like it.”
Castiel looks up, holding up the arm so Dean can see the claws on the hands in place of fingernails. "I don't think these were humans."
Castiel feels his cheeks heat up a little in embarrassment at being caught staring, and he turns around to finish drying himself off then gets dressed.
Castiel turns to Dean, eyes narrowed as he grabs a hold of his arm, pulling him close. "Don't even
Dean walks over to Jack's bed, looking down at the laptop screen. "Hey, you're watching Buffy!" He says. "I don't think I've watched that in years."
Sam is undeniably confused....
that'll be enough time to get everything done. Though they don't have a lot of decorations to put up, so it shouldn't take them too long. They weren't planning on going too overboard with the decorating.

Actually, Dean thinks it has
Instead, he chooses to not say anything as they walk into the bunker's library, where Sam and Eileen are still seated. And Castiel knows
Dean holds up his half eaten candy cane to Castiel, urging him to try it. "Try it." He says. "It's bacon flavoured."
Dean looks over at Castiel, expecting to hear him put in his input on this situation, but instead he appears to be deep in thought about something.
"I don't know..." Dean says. "But I think maybe we need to do some research. And figure out what the hell is going on here, and why a vampire is feeding on a werewolf."
“And I keep telling you, Dean.” Castiel starts, setting the food and beer down on the bed. “I don’t have a need for a room. I don’t sleep.”
"It's not like you haven't done stuff behind Sam's back before, Dean." Castiel says. "In fact, that's rather a fairly big Winchester trait."
"It's strange." Castiel says. "I don't think I like it."
Sam shakes his head, unsurprised that Dean would offer him one. "No, I'm okay." He doesn’t really like bacon to begin with, so he knows for a fact that he won’t like bacon flavored candy canes.
Castiel sighs, letting go of Dean's arm. "That'll have to do then." He says. "But if you decide to change your mind in the middle of the night and come out here and try to take everything down, I'm locking you in the dungeon until Christmas is over." He warns. "
got to have a word with Sam about those Christmas decorations he bought when he specifically said not to.
The two dead bodies drained of all their blood aren't human, but werewolves. So they appear to be dealing with some sort of vampire that feeds on werewolf blood...?
Or... maybe he'll be able to tolerate it if it's nothing too overboard if Sam insists they need to decorate.... But he's not going to admit that just yet. Not even to Castiel.
with it exactly.” Dean says, shoving a fork full of pie into his mouth. “I just don’t want the bunker to be decorated in Christmas shit is all.” He shrugs. “I mean, I’m all for getting Jody and the girls around and having a big dinner, but decorating? Not happening.”
Castiel nods, closing the laptop and setting it back on the bed next to him. "Good." He says. "Then I guess we should get going now."
Sam laughs, shaking his head. “Thanks, Cas.”

Dean goes quiet. He knows that Castiel is right with that. He
and I have been thinking...." Sam starts, scratching the back of his neck nervously. "We were thinking that maybe... since it's nearly Christmas and all, that we should celebrate it this year." He says. "
Jack. He doesn't want to upset the kid.
Then again, he's really only agreed to this whole thing for Jack, and it wouldn't be fair to the kid to have his first Christmas cancelled just because he didn't want to get up early. Dean can't hurt the kid like that.
"Hello, Dean. Hello Sam." Castiel greets, as he walks into the library and over to Dean's side.
Not the greatest situation he notes. So he starts to think of the only way to distract Dean from yelling at Sam.  Unfortunately for Sam though, the best thing he can come up with, is distracting Dean with sex....
And he's
And of all the ways Castiel could admit it to him, why did it have to be
"Wha- why?" Sam asks, finding it hard to grasp what Jack has just said. "
"That's actually a thing?" Dean asks, dumbfounded at this news. "Monsters feeding on other monsters?"

have a big dinner for Christmas. Why can't Sam just leave it at that?
"Could be, as long as they don't touch Garth and his family." Dean says. "But I think Cas and I should stick around here a bit longer. Just to be sure."
Sam looks to his mother and Eileen, who’ve both stopped, and are waiting for what they’re to do next.
sort of clean up before he fell asleep, but a shower would be much better.
“I still don’t like having all this crap up…” He sighs.
Dean opens his mouth to say something, but closes it, not having an idea on what the hell to say. He looks down at the body he was looking king over, before opening its mouth.
"Cas." Dean smiles, eyes lighting up as he sees his angel, and pulls him down to sit on his lap. "Want a bacon flavoured candy cane?"
that’s what they’re doing anyway.
“That sounds like a good idea.” Castiel nods, agreeing with Dean. they should probably get Jack out of the bunker for a bit.
"I don't care." Dean says. "They went behind my back and bought them when I told them not to."
He looks over at Castiel, finding the angel reading through the article as he sits on the edge of the bed. And he can't help but stare at him for longer than necessary. There's just something about the way that Castiel squints his eyes a little as he reads what's on the laptop screen that he finds adorable.
Nor does he get the chance to figure out a reply as Jack walks over to them.
He suspects that Dean already has, but it doesn't hurt to ask just in case he's managed to forget something.
And he can never resist his angel, so he kisses him back. Although, he’s not entirely sure what brought this on, though he can guess. But he doesn’t care, as he pulls Castiel closer to him, and trails kisses down Castiel’s neck as the angel rubs their crotches against each other, causing him to completely forget Sam standing behind him staring at him with wide eyes.
"I can go with you, Dean." He says. "Let Sam sit this one out."
But Castiel doesn’t move from his spot. There’s something else he’d rather do before they do any cooking, and that’s have a shower. The pair of them aren’t exactly clean at present.
He shakes his head. He's not sure
, Cas.” Dean cuts him off before he can finish. He knows
It doesn’t take very long for everyone to start piling into the kitchen, although Castiel notices Sam frown as he sees that it’s burgers for lunch. Not exactly what he was hoping for, but he should have known it'd be burgers again if Dean's the one who sorted out lunch.
He hands the file over to Mary, who's quick to read through it. "I guess that's why we've never heard of them before."
At least, Dean sounded like he was sure the victims are werewolves.... Sam's not so sure Dean would lie about something like this, nor would he have any real reason to lie about it.
Vampires don't feed on werewolves, at least, not from what Dean is aware of. He and Sam have never come across anything like this, and judging by dad's journal, neither had he.
“Not anymore, and certainly not for me.” Castiel sighs. “What remains of my brothers don’t have the power to fix them.” He says. “And even if they could, after all I’ve done, they wouldn’t do it for me.”
Knowing that Dean likely won't take know for an answer, Castiel opens his mouth, allowing Dean to shove the end of the candy cane for him to try. And just like he had thought, there's not much of a taste for him. Although, there is something, and he's not entirely sure if he likes it….
He's definitely proud of the kid, but unfortunately he can't properly congratulate Jack right now. There's other issues on his mind right now that he's finding himself more preoccupied with.
Castiel huffs out a laugh, pushing Dean away from him. “Later tonight.” He promises. “Now we should get back out there and finish helping the others set up.”
He shifts closer to Dean on the bed as Dean eventually sits back too after finishing off the pie. He rests his head on Dean’s shoulder, taking another sip of beer as Dean opens one for himself.
this cobiescu vampire….
. Is what Dean would say if he was in any sort of shape to make a coherent sentence.
But Sam is already heading out of the kitchen by then, completely ignoring what Dean had said.
"Alright." He says, standing up. "Let's get to it then."
Anyway, thank you to whoever read this fic!
And he can’t say no to spending the day with Dean and Castiel. Even if it
Castiel is the first to notice all the decorations that the others have put up, and he thinks it doesn't look too bad. And they haven't seemed to go too overboard with everything. Though even if there's not a lot of decorations up, he knows that Dean won't be happy as soon as he notices them all....
"Nothing about any sort of vampire-like creature that feeds on werewolf blood." Castiel sighs. "Honestly, I'm not even sure
is a strict NO. However, they do have some music playing through the speakers in here, and Dean can thankfully say that it's music that he enjoys. Truthfully he would've thought that Claire, or even Sam would've put on Christmas music just to piss him off, but it seems they've decided not to.
it's a vampire killing a werewolf, do we even have a case here?" Castiel asks.
Taking a seat on the bed next to Dean, Castiel grabs one of the bottles of beer. “What is really so bad about decorating the bunker for Christmas, Dean?”
One of them really should've taken a pen with them so they can check everything off, Jack thinks. At least then it would be easier to figure out if they've got everything. But Jack thinks he can figure out without a pen to check everything off. There isn't a hell of a lot they have to get after all.
He looks down at the food and beer in his arms. His arms are both full, so it’s a little difficult for him to both knock on the door and open it. And with the volume Dean is playing his music, Castiel isn’t sure if the hunter will be able to hear him if he calls out to him to open the door.
"No, Sam." Dean says. "We can do a big dinner or whatever, but we are not going to make the bunker look like Rudolf threw up everywhere."
"Nothing." Dean says. "But I told you I don't want the bunker decorated in a bunch of Christmas shit, Sam! You went behind my back and bought decorations when I told you not to!"
Castiel sighs. That doesn't give him much of an idea of how to distract him. He guesses that he could always keep him occupied with sex much like last time, but... he'd rather do something else instead. Not that he doesn't enjoy having sex with Dean, he'd just prefer to go a different route.
The library that’s covered in Christmas decorations…. Thankfully it doesn’t appear to be a lot though, but Dean still doesn’t like it. But he’s agreed to leave them up for mom and Jack.
Even so, Dean's
"Sam... I can kind of get wanting to celebrate Christmas, but we are
"They appear to be entries of a few encounters the Men of Letters have had with them." Jack says, as he sits down, grabbing one of the files and opening it. "According to their notes, it seems as though there's not many of these vampires left."
Dean just huffs in response, not entirely in the mood to talk. He's still not happy about leaving all these decorations up, but he's decided that he's going to have to tolerate it for Jack and mom's sake.
It only takes Sam and Eileen about three hours, give or take, to return to the bunker after their trip out to the store to get Christmas decorations, and so far as soon as they walk in, there is no signs of Dean anywhere. So it seems the older Winchester hasn’t stuck to his threat of locking them out of the bunker, considering they were able to come inside without difficulty.
Castiel shrugs. “What movie?”
"No, Cas, fucking..." Dean starts. "Sam went behind my back and put up all this shit when I said not to!"
about upsetting our son, Dean." He says. "The decorations are staying."
Not entirely happy with this chapter, but it'll have to do.
"Hey, Sammy." Dean says, taking the seat directly across from him. "We need to have a talk about what you and your girlfriend did when I told you
well Castiel making food will go down, but he's curious to see how it goes. And burgers sound like they might be the easiest for him to make, granted he doesn't under cook the patties or burn them. But it's the thought that counts.
- more commonly referred to as a lycanthrope or a werewolf."
odd. He's got no idea on what Sam could possibly be nervous about. Unless he got Eileen pregnant or they're planning on having a baby.... He hopes that's not the case. They don't need a baby running around the bunker.
"Stay out of this, Cas!" Dean says, putting a hand up in front of Castiel, indicating him to stop talking, "Sam. While what you say may be true, you
And he's going to make him take it all down. They can still have a Christmas dinner, hell, he's not going to say no to food, but... no decorations. Not a single decoration.
Nor does he want Castiel to lock him in the dungeon without pie until Christmas is over….
Jack can't help but smile a little at the sight of Castiel and Dean's bickering. He finds it adorable if he's being honest, and while he knows that Dean and Castiel haven't had the most easy relationship, and there has been many problems (some he doesn't even know of), he knows for sure that they're the perfect fit for each other despite everything. There's nothing that will ever pull them away from each other.
It’s not the most impressive feast, but it’ll do just fine for them all. And Dean, as he’s sat next to Castiel and Donna, finds himself glad that he didn’t force Sam to cancel the Christmas festivities, even if it is only a small Christmas lunch. Especially as he sees how much Jack is enjoying himself on his first Christmas. Cause in the end, he ultimately agreed to this for Jack, and he’d hate to see the kid disappointed.
"Seems like it." Sam says. "Dean... I'm not sure you guys really have a case here. Seems like these cobiescu vampires are doing us a favour."
Sam nods, glad that everyone is informed on what to do. Mom and Jack are to start decorating the library, while he and Eileen go out to get a tree and a few more decorations specifically for the tree.
Nodding, Castiel takes a sip of beer as he watches Dean.
It's early in the morning, and Dean isn't sure if he's ever seen the bunker
"Well we don't have very many decorations to begin with as I don't want to go too overboard, so maybe just the library." Sam says. "And maybe just anywhere else where it'll look good."
?" Dean asks, sitting at the small table in the motel room with Castiel sitting across from him as he's got his phone on speaker phone on the table between them.
He needs to tell Cas that he loves him too. Just believing in the chance that Cas has always known isn't enough.
"Dean." Castiel warns, grabbing onto Dean's arm before he's able to go storm off in search of Sam. "Just let it go."
Besides, Castiel asked what he could do to help lift his mood right now, and this will potentially help.
“...yeah?” Dean says, but it comes out more like a question.
Dean sighs, shaking his head.
drinks and cooks at the same time - even when you shouldn’t do that.
Unfortunately Castiel gets what Dean is suggesting, and puts a hand on his chest, pushing him away a little. "That is reserved for later tonight."
"Sam, something happened in here." Jack says, as he looks around the room, feeling the presence of something terrible left behind.

The only one of the others to come out of hiding, is Sam. Jack, Mary, and Eileen don't emerge out from wherever they may be hiding out in the bunker.
Sighing in frustration, Sam closes the book in front of him and leans back on the chair he's seated at. "Has anyone found anything yet?"
"Hi, I'm Agent Armstrong, and this is Agent Pritchard." Dean says, as he and Castiel approach the front desk once they're in the building, holding out their FBI badges. "We're here about the bodies that turned up dead recently."
In fact, he’s not going to say it out loud, but he’s actually enjoying himself. Although, he’s still dreading the clean up afterwards, but for now he’s choosing to ignore that. That’s a problem for later.
very well be right with his suspicion. She could be what they're hunting.
He doesn't even want to get up. All he wants is for Castiel to be back here with him safe and sound, and
It does however seem to be what they're hunting. The victims are werewolves, and the killings are consistent with every other vampire killing he's ever seen.
"Hey, Dean?" Sam says, breaking the silence between the three of them as they're packing everything away. "I've been thinking...."
to be on his side!
"Well then." Dean says. "Time to go pay her a visit."
want happening.
Castiel on the other hand, pays him no notice as he examines over the alarming amount of junk food he and Dean had gone out to buy,m as he's packs it away into the pantry and the fridge.
At Dean’s words, Castiel turns to him, whacking him over the back of his head, before turning to Sam. “
"You have to eat your fruit and vegetables, Dean." Castiel says.
Castiel looks to her. “My wings used to be a lot better than this.” He says, signing to her.
Dean shrugs. “If they buy Christmas decorations...
He should've said something. He should have said it back to him. Instead he was too in shock to react the way he wanted to.
Sam looks around, figuring that Dean may have a point about the mess, and that it might be pointless, but all of this is for Jack and their mom. They've never had a Christmas with Jack or their mom. It may be a few years since Amara brought their mother back for them, and since Jack was born, but they've had other things to worry about more than celebrating Christmas.
"No, it's not." Sam chuckles, watching as Dean tries to shove the end of the candy cane into Castiel's mouth in an attempt to get him to try it. "I think it's supposed to be a gag gift. Eileen and I found them at the store and decided to buy them for Dean."
He’s not sure how he feels about Dean watching him attempt to cook…. Does Dean
doesn't like the sound of that.
"So what's the plan for tomorrow?" Castiel asks. "We going to talk with the families of the victims, or going straight to the morgue?"
“A Christmas tree, Cas.” Sam says. “You can’t have Christmas without a tree and an angel on top.”
“Dean’s right, Castiel.” Mary says. “They were great.”
Sitting back in the chair, Castiel waits for Dean to finish eating so they can leave and find a motel for the next few days while they take care of this case.
“Uh…” Sam stammers, trying to figure out what to say. “Nothing?”
"Come on, Cas, try it." Dean urges, as Castiel pushes his arm away from his face.
"This sounds like it'll be a lot of fun." Jack says, smiling.
"What's in the files?" Mary asks.
what he was hoping not to find upon their return.
Though they still need to get a tree. And they may need Castiel’s help in getting one, whether that be by him keeping Dean occupied, or him helping to get a tree, Sam’s not sure yet. He’ll figure that out later. Maybe if Castiel is keeping Dean busy while they decorate, they can try to get Crowley to help them get a tree instead.
He can’t say he’s surprised that Dean has put a box of beer in the cart even though it’s not on the list. Almost every time they go to the store, Dean is adding beer to the things they need to buy.
He doesn't want Jack to be upset because of Dean. They've had enough of that already. And he's not going to let Dean get his way and deny Jack of a good first Christmas. Or a Mary a good first Christmas with her sons. So the decorations are staying up.
Glancing over his shoulder, he finds Dean with everything else they need out on the table, and is busy cutting up an onion.
I've been stuck on these last two chapters for way too long....
He looks over at Eileen - who's not said a word this entire time - to find her not paying attention to the Winchester's arguing as she stays buried in her book. Castiel isn't sure if that's because she just can't hear what they're saying, or if she doesn't want to get involved with it. He thinks it's more than likely the latter. Although her not hearing them
"At least he'll be in a good mood afterwards." Alex says.
Sam looks up at him, smiling a little. “Hey, Cas.”
He chooses to drape red and green tinsel across the backs of the chairs and around the edges of the tables, but after examining over it, he takes them off to put elsewhere. While it does look alright, having tinsel on the back of the chairs and around the edges of the table will likely make a mess and not be the most comfortable thing to have there while someone is sitting and working at the table.
good cooking.
"Well, I know you like bacon and candy, so…" Sam says. "Enjoy I guess?"
"Eileen and I are going to go out and buy Christmas decorations!" He says over his shoulder, leaving Dean and Castiel to stand in the kitchen watching after him.
At the threat of being locked in the dungeon and no pie, Dean sighs, giving up. He'll let the decorations stay. He'll agree to almost anything if it means he gets his pie. And quite honestly, he doesn't fancy being locked up in the dungeon.
Castiel turns around, his attention back onto the meat patties he has cooking on the stove. Thankfully, they’re not burnt, but one side of each patty
With that, they're making their way to the checkouts to pay for everything, and then they're on their way back home to the bunker.
awake and busy before. Christmas morning has arrived, and everyone is up and in the kitchen either cooking or preparing food for lunch.
“Dean!” He calls out anyway, hoping he can hear him over the music. “Dean, it’s Cas. Can you open the door for me please? My arms are full.”
“Um, yes.” Castiel nods, looking over at Mary. “I uh, I hope they taste alright. I think I may have added a little too much garlic in the patties.”
"I'm gonna get him back, Sam." Jack says, turning to face him, his eyes glowing gold. "Fuck the Empty and it's deal with Cas." He says. "I'm going to get Castiel back."
Endings aren't what I'd call my strong point.
sorry for though, is for initiating it in front of Sam.
He's pretty sure they haven't forgotten anything, considering there wasn't a lot that they needed to buy. All they needed to get was a tree and some more decorations along with a bit more food and drink that they've ran out of (even though Dean and Castiel had gone to the store to stock up on a few things a couple days ago).
"Fine." He says. "If pie is on the line, then they're staying." With that being said, he's moving away from Castiel, and sulking off to his room.
It's not something that he'd eat all the time, but it's not as bad as he expected it to be.
"Hey, uh..." Sam starts, making his way into the library where Eileen, Mary, and Jack are all seated after having just finished adding the last few touches to decorating. "Dean just called, and uh, they need some help in figuring out this thing they're hunting."
In his grief, he barely even notices Sam and Jack rushing over to his side shouting for him. All he can do is stare off into space at the spot the Empty took Castiel away.
Dean nods. "Alright, let's do this." He shuts off the impala, and gets out. Castiel follows soon after, and they make their way inside the morgue building.
"Well we're all out of beer back in the bunker." Dean says. "So even if it's not on the list, it's a necessity."
But Dean doesn't say anything, or allow Castiel to come near him as he too leaves the kitchen, grumbling to himself under his breath.
Jack nods, pausing the episode on his laptop as he gets up, moving to get his shoes and a jacket on. “Okay.”
“Well, that may be true, Cas.” Dean says. “But
Sam has just come to him asking if he can distract Dean for the next few hours while he and Eileen go out to get a Christmas tree. But Castiel isn't entirely sure how Sam is wanting him to distract Dean.
"Dean really likes pie, doesn't he?" Jack asks, watching Dean go.
Mary nods, grabbing one of the bags, as Eileen and Sam grab the others, and they make their way through the bunker, trying to find somewhere they can hide everything from Dean. maybe they can hide it in one of the rooms Dean never goes into.
"What do you think?" Dean asks.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Alright.” Castiel nods. “I don’t care what movie we watch anyway.” He says. “I’m happy with anything.”
“Alright. Thanks, Cas.” Sam nods. “By the way, we might need to to keep Dean distracted again when we go out to get a tree.”
Dean looks over at him, a look of confusion crossing his face. "What do you mean?"
"What do you mean?" Dean asks, looking over to Castiel.
Well, Castiel isn't exactly wrong there and Dean
still smell of sex.
Taking a bite from it, he gags a little at the initial taste. It doesn't completely taste like bacon, but there's a weird greasy kind of taste to it. It's a weird taste, leaves a funny after taste in his mouth, but… he thinks he kind of likes it.
“Sounds like a plan.” Dean says, right as Sam’s heading out to go find mom and Eileen, leaving both Dean and Castiel alone in the library.
While that’s true, it doesn’t mean that Dean can’t be of any help. He barely even helped to make the patties, so Castiel was left to make those mostly by himself, so he hopes they end up tasting alright - not that he himself will really be able to tell if they taste alright, He’ll have to get that opinion from everyone else in the bunker.
decorate the bunker. That's... not exactly what he was expecting to hear.... At least it's not that Eileen is pregnant....
"I think this'll do." He says, looking up at Eileen. "There anything we're forgetting?"
." Sam explains. "Turns out the Men of Letters had a few run ins with a couple of them in the past. And according to their notes, there doesn't appear to be much of them left. Not a lot seems to be known about them."
They’re supposed to be cooking burgers right now. Well, Castiel was meant to, but now it’s the both of them after they discovered Castiel doesn’t quite know how to work the stove properly. But all Dean has been doing is sit at the table drinking and giving Castiel instructions on what to do.
"There anything else we still need to get?" Castiel asks, glancing over at the list Jack's holding.
Getting up slowly, Castiel tries not to wake Dean as he gathers up his clothes from the floor and gets dressed back into them. He should probably have a shower later, just to clean himself up more. He and Dean
It also really doesn't help that all I've been motivated to write fanfic for is for Prodigal Son - which is a fantastic show, and I highly recommend watching! I just wish it never got cancelled, cause I need a season 3, especially after
Castiel turns to Dean, unsure of why Dean is claiming they took hours to make. It was only an hour tops. “It didn’t take
"Not that I'm aware of." He says, stepping away from the bodies.
"Fine." He sighs, getting up and heading off towards the kitchen. He's not happy about it of course, but... he'll just deal with it later.
"I didn't know what else to watch, and I thought this looked good." Jack says. "And I like it."
to get Castiel back more than ever. For Dean's sake.
They've still got other stuff in the trunk of the Impala if they haven't packed enough. Baby is always packed and ready to go gank some monsters.
"Hopefully Sam and Eileen will be back with the tree soon." Mary says, while she sets up little Christmas themed figurines on top of shelves and in the center of the tables. "We're starting to run out of decorations.
"Mom, you and Jack can start decorating, and Eileen and I can go out and get a tree." Sam says.
"I've been thinking - well,
Sam has just called them, informing them that they've found out what it seems to be they're hunting. A cobiescu vampire.
"Well, you're not wrong." Dean says, having to agree with Castiel on that. It does taste rather strange, but he likes it. "You want one, Sam?"
Sam thinks they should really start thinking about getting a few small jobs on the side to earn money in a way that's not illegal. Unfortunately, that's not exactly possible for them.
side. He's
As realisation hits him at what had happened here while they were gone, he drops to his knees next to Sam and Dean. "Cas is gone…" He says, his voice barely above a whisper.
Honestly, he really thought for sure that Dean would be on board from the start to decorate the bunker for Christmas. So the fact that he's not is rather surprising.
"I guess I'll just ask them if they're hungry then." He says. "Which means we need to turn back and check with Jack and your mother."
Jack's beaming at the praise and feeling rather proud of himself for finding out what creature is that Dean and Castiel are hunting. Now alls needed is to inform them of this.
And Jack's going to do everything he can to get Castiel back. It'll be harder than the first time, but he's going to do it. He

Although a real tree would look much nicer, a fake one is just as good and cheaper. It's not like they
Castiel nods. "Thank you." He watches her leave the room, before he's turning to Dean - who's still busy examining the bodies. "Did something seem a little off about that woman to you?"
Castiel sighs, watching Dean go. "Yes." He says, knowing
“You want to watch a movie?” Dean asks, looking down at Castiel.
Dean shakes his head, not having a clue on what's going on with this case now. It's clearly not a normal vampire killing like they had thought. The victims appear to be werewolves, not humans. He's never heard of a vampire drinking the blood of a werewolf before, and there's nothing about anything like this in dad's journal.
"No, not quite." Dean shakes his head. He grabs his phone out of his pocket, pulling up Sam's contact. "I'll give Sam a call. See if he, mom, and Jack can check out the books in the bunker." He says. "Maybe the Men of Letters had encountered something like this before."
“Hey!” Dean says, walking over to Sam, whacking him on the back of his head. “Don’t complain. Cas spent hours making them.”
Nodding, Castiel follows Dean to their room, finding that Dean has more or less packed everything he'll need for this hunt already.

“Absolutely.” Dean hums. “Would be
“These vampires look nothing like the ones we hunt.” Jack comments, just as Dean and Castiel make their way into his room. “None of these monsters do.”
went behind my back when I said no to decorations."
"At least try to act cheerful, Dean." Castiel says, as the two of them make apple pies.
“Sammy.” He starts. “After mine and Cas’s shower, we need to have a chat.”
"Well..." Jack says, standing up. "I guess we need to hit the books then, and find out whatever this thing could be for Dean and Castiel?"
Dean hums, pulling Castiel in close, peppering kisses on his cheek and down his neck. He absolutely feels like he’s in a better mood now, although he’d be in an even better mood if they did more than just blowjobs. But the main thing is that Castiel agreed to do at least
“Hey, Cas.” Sam says, walking into the kitchen with Eileen following behind him. “Eileen and I are gonna head out to the store.”
Jack has never done anything like this before, so he's excited to decorate and experience his first Christmas with Castiel and the Winchesters. Even
Now Dean won't say no to sex later tonight, but they can slip away now too, have a little quickie. Then get back to helping prepare food for later. The others will be fine without them.
the one to pick out pie at the store earlier when they went out. Dean
He’s not entirely sure if he and Eileen bought enough decorations, but they don’t necessarily have to decorate every room in the bunker. They mostly only need to decorate the library room, and that’ll probably be enough. But if they haven’t bought enough decorations, they can always go back out to the store at a later date.
“Oh my god!” She says.
"Sure." He says as he finishes his coffee and gets up.
"I'll leave you gentlemen to it." The woman says, before beginning to head out of the room. "I'll be out front if you need anything."
As Sam says an angel on top, Castiel backs away a little. They put angels on top of Christmas trees?
He's really not got much of an idea of what Dean and Castiel are up against. He had asked Dean of he's absolutely sure that the victims are both werewolves, and Dean had said that he's certain they are, and that the cause of death looks rather consistent with a normal vampire killing.
"We need milk, cheese, potatoes, cauliflower, pasta…" Jack reads through the list as he walks bedside Castiel while pushing the shopping cart in front of him. "Is pasta something you usually have at Christmas?"
Dean shouts all of a sudden once he and Castiel have finished putting together four apple pies.
Hearing footsteps approaching the map room, Sam spins around, ready to get all defensive in case it’s Dean, but he relaxes as he sees it’s just his mother, Mary.
you won't be getting any pie."
Nodding, Jack looks back at the shopping list, before looking around the store. They're in the produce section of the grocery store, and Castiel has stopped to pick out what fruit and vegetables they need off the list and setting them down in the cart.
“Hey, mom.” Sam says, beginning to relax, relieved that it’s not Dean who’s made his way into the map room. They’d have a problem if it were Dean instead of their mother.
"Alright, we'll be back soon." Mary says, before she and Jack are off to get pizza, leaving Sam and Eileen alone in the bunker.
"Yeah, you may have a point." Sam says. "But this is all for Jack and mom."
"Mary, how does this look?" Jack asks, stepping away from the bookshelf he was just stringing Christmas lights up on.
"I'm sorry, Cas." He sobs. "I love you…"
Castiel sighs, shaking his head. “While I do appreciate that, Dean. I’d prefer a little more help than that.”
need to watch him cook?
Maybe when the time comes to decorate the bunker, he can talk Castiel into taking Dean out somewhere. Where exactly, is up to him, just as long he keeps Dean occupied long enough for them to get all the decorations up.
"Werewolf..." He says, finding a set of werewolf fangs. "What the..."
Dean stares at him, mouth agape slightly. He's not entirely sure if he had heard him right. "You want to
promised that you’d be the one attempting to cook.”
He's not sure what the appeal us of what Sam is suggesting, but he also doesn't quite understand why Dean doesn't seem to be happy with it. Its not like it's anything life threatening... at least, he thinks it's not....
true, but he's sure that she knows what they're arguing over.
He wraps an arm around Castiel's shoulders as they make their way out of their room and off towards where the Impala is waiting for them in the garage after they say a quick goodbye to everyone else in the bunker.
Considering none of them are fantastic cooks, they can only really stick to cooking things that are simple and well within their cooking skills. Fortunately (well
He really doesn't understand why Dean doesn't want any of this. Everything looks okay, and Sam, Eileen, Mary, and Jack don't appear to have gone completely overboard with everything. And it even looks like they've only kept the majority of the decorating to the library.
Christmas with mom,
“Nothing’s
He doesn't mean to be all grouchy, but it's early. Too fucking early for his liking. Maybe if they had waited another hour or two to wake him up he'd feel more cheerful.
Castiel does not understand....
what's about to go down between the two Winchester brothers, and there's not much he can do to stop it....
But he takes the pie into his mouth anyway, which causes Dean to smile.
"Okay, we've got at least a week to get a tree and decorate the bunker before Dean and Cas get back." Sam says, looking around at everyone.
Sam smiles. It seems Jack has found out exactly what Dean and Castiel could be hunting. "Good job, Jack."
Entering the bunker’s library, Castiel finds Sam seated at the table on his laptop - most likely searching for any cases that need taking care of - while Eileen sits next to him at the table reading.
Dean would come in right at this very moment as they're discussing something Christmas related.
Dean.
they're still alive by next Christmas....
Though wanting to celebrate Christmas he gets, even if he's not so sure he likes the sound of that. When have they ever properly celebrated Christmas anyway?
"Looks like someone's going to get laid." Claire says, from next to Jack.
Dean glares after him. "If you do, I'm locking you both out of the bunker!"
Dean looks up at him, before he's opening the box and grabbing one out and unwrapping it. He gives it a quick sniff, not sure what to expect. It doesn't really smell like bacon, in fact, he's not even sure
I've always wanted to add a cobiescu vampire into a Supernatural fanfic, so here we are! If you're curious to know, a cobiescu vampire had appeared in one of my all time favorite shows growing up, Big Wolf on Campus, in the season three episode titled,
With any luck, Castiel might have him occupied with
The lady nods. "Alright then." She says. "Follow me." She gets up off her seat behind the desk, motioning for them to follow her down the hall. "You're lucky you came just now." She says, as she leads them into the morgue's freezer room. "No one's shown up to claim the bodies, and we were set to have them cremated."
Jack shrugs. "I think I prefer Willow." He says. "But yes. Buffy is cute too."
to believe that he can.
Dean folds his arms across his chest. He's down for at least having a big feast on Christmas night. Any opportunity for a lot of food, and he's down. He's not going to say no to food. Maybe they can even get Jody and the girls around too, and have Jody bring some of her
"How much jelly do I have to make?" Jack asks, reading through the instructions on the back of one of the boxes of jelly crystals.
"Dean." Castiel sighs. "Even if he does put up decorations, I don't think he's going to put up a lot." He says. "If anything, I think he only plans on decorating the library anyway."
Dean hums in agreement. He thinks Willow is pretty cute too, but he always had a thing for Buffy back when he was younger and Buffy the Vampire Slayer was airing on TV. And who wouldn’t? Sarah Michelle Gellar is gorgeous!
Sam sighs, sitting back in his seat as he watches Dean stalk around the library, glaring at all the Christmas decorations. Though he doesn't make a move to tear any of them down.
you want them up anyway? I thought this is the type of stuff you'd be wanting to do?"
Dean makes his way over to Castiel, wrapping an arm around his shoulders. "Come on. Let's go make some food." He says. "You promised you'd attempt to make burgers."
The residual presence of something that he knows all too well.
Castiel sighs, but obeys, following Dean off towards the showers.
Dean shrugs. "Whatever you want, Cas."
Castiel has to agree with Sam there. Going behind Dean's back to buy Christmas decorations to decorate the bunker is nowhere near as big a deal to anything else they've pulled. It's like the least serious thing they could ever think of doing behind each other's backs. Dean's just making too big a deal out of this.
Castiel looks up at him, furrowing his eyebrows a little. "I think I know who might be this cobiescu vampire." He says. "The woman that was working at the morgue. Something armed off about her."
Standing in the kitchen, Castiel stares after Dean in confusion. Not quite understanding what just happened.
They've been searching for hours for anything this thing that Dean and Castiel are hunting could possibly be, and so far, they have come up with nothing. Nothing that could possibly explain what this thing could be.
“Uh... o-okay.” Sam says, knowing exactly what the chat is going to be about. It’ll be about the Christmas decorations that Dean told him not to buy, but he bought anyway.
"Dean, talk to me! What happened?" Sam asks, trying to get him to say something. "Where's Cas?"
"By the way. Eileen and I found something at the store you might like." Sam starts, having just remembered that he and Eileen managed to find in the candy section at the store not long before they were ready to leave.
From inside the room, Castiel watches as Dean confronts Sam. He can guess that Sam and Eileen have returned back to the bunker with bags of Christmas decorations, and Dean has caught them with it all.
Titling his head to the side, he grabs an arm of the body, pulling it out from under the sheet. "Dean..." He starts, finding what appears to be claws. "Either they didn't take care of their nails very well, or these bodies didn't belong to humans."
"Do vampires usually feed on werewolves?" Jack asks.
“Don’t be sorry, Cas.” Dean says, patting him on the back. “It’s just a shame that you’re missing out.”
"I don't like this area." Dean says looking around at all the fresh fruits and vegetables.
"Hey, we can have Christmas." He says. "Get Jody and the girls around. Have Jody bring some of her awesome cooking... get mom to bake a bunch of pie..." He trails off, his mind wandering off towards food, before he's shaking his head. "But we are
He’s not sure if Dean
some crappy Christmas movie - Castiel moves in close to Dean’s side and Dean opens the bag of potato chips, scoffing back the majority of the bag by himself as the two of them sit back enjoying each other’s company as they watch the movie.
Not long after their activities, Dean had fallen asleep, leaving Castiel laying back on the bed next to him wide awake as he stares at the ceiling. He feels as though he should go apologize to Sam soon about his strategy in keeping Dean busy.
"Yeah. Good work, kid." Dean agrees.
At least he’s being helpful now….
Jack nods, glad of the chance to leave the bunker. Even if it
“Sam and Eileen have gone out to the store.” He says, watching as Dean sits down on the bed, already digging into the apple and rhubarb pie. “You’re not really going to lock them out of the bunker, are you?”
Dean’s not even sure what TV show Jack’s watching now. Last he checked Jack was almost finished watching Lost.
Castiel makes his way over to him, but doesn’t take a seat. “I uh… want to apologize for my method in distracting Dean while you-” He starts, but Sam cuts him off.
Castiel sighs, setting down the knife he was using to cut up apples. "Is there anything I can do to lift your mood up?"
Sam looks from Dean to Castiel in surprise. He wasn't expecting Castiel to have been the one to make them, and it seems everyone else is surprised to hear it too.
He looks at every bit of red, green, silver, and gold tinsel strewn across the shelves. At the Christmas tree in one corner covered in tinsel, baubles, candy canes and fairy lights. And what looks like a few wrapped presents under the tree. He's not sure if they're real, or just there for decoration.
They'll likely be able to wait until tomorrow to put the tree up. Dean and Castiel will still be busy taking care if the vampire case, so they'll be able to put the tree up and decorate it before they get home.
Castiel nods. “Yeah.” He sighs, laying back on the bed and stares up at the ceiling, as Dean sits next to him, finishing off the rest of the pie.
not happy about there being Christmas decorations all over the library....
"That we should." Dean nods, slinging his duffel bag with everything they'll need over his shoulder after putting his laptop in the bag too. "Come on."
Dean shakes his head. "Nope. I don't understand why anyone would even think of making something like this, but they're not bad."
. I don't know if they've ever appeared in anything else or it's just a thing in Big Wolf, but I've been meaning to add them into a Supernatural fic for the longest time, and now I finally have!
do you suggest I'm to keep Dean distracted?"
Castiel sighs, smiling as he shakes his head at Dean's words. "Well let's just get a move on before the store starts to get too busy."
“Well, you figure something out, and Cas and I can go and get some things from the store.” Dean says. “Maybe we can take Jack with us. Get him out of the bunker for a bit.”
Humming in agreement, Dean pulls his gaze away from Castiel as he doesn't say anything, and stares down at his phone. He's sure Castiel will tell him what's on his mind soon enough.
If Dean knew they'd have to get up early today, then he would've cancelled the whole damn Christmas lunch before Jody, Donna, and the girls got here.
Jack nods slowly, unsure if he believes that to be a good idea. But he doesn't press the matter any further. If Dean wants more beer, then he gets more beer. Denying him of beer might not end well.
Sam and the others have gone behind his back and decorated the bunker for Christmas.... This is
And as soon as Sam has hung up, Dean turns to Castiel, finding his angel still deep in thought. Dean's not entirely sure on what, but he thinks it may have something to do with that woman who works at the morgue.
Dean nods, standing up. He personally didn't sense anything off about her, mostly only her being nervous about two "FBI" guys coming into her place of work to check out a couple dead bodies.
"I have some ideas…" He trails off, pulling Castiel closer by the waistband of his sweatpants.
years of life, he's never heard of this. He wasn't even aware that there's more than one type of vampire, and by the look on Dean's face, it appears that Dean had no idea either.
The woman at the front desk looks up at them, her eyes landing on the badges they're holding. "Why are the FBI wanting to investigate this case?" She asks. "I wouldn't think this is something that they'd be concerned about."
While he and Eileen are out getting the tree, Sam thinks that they should maybe also buy a few more decorations. Decorations mainly for the tree, cause what they had bought last time are likely going to all be used for decorating in the library and anywhere else around the bunker they find places for them that'll look good.
Sam looks at Jack, confused, and fearful. "What?"
"He made a deal with the Empty." Jack says. "To save me, after I died the first time. That it would take him instead, but it wouldn't take him right away." He explains, teary eyed. "When he found true happiness, then the Empty would be summoned to take him away… permanently."
Castiel looks at him, confused. Both at Dean automatically pulling him down to sit on his lap, and at his offer. "You...
am I supposed to be on your side, Dean?" Castiel turns to him, tilting his head to the side. "And... I don't understand the appeal of Christmas, but I don't see why it's a bad thing if we celebrate and decorate the bunker."
He looks up at Castiel, then to Dean, who's walking ahead of them.
If there's one place that's likely to have some sort of information on whatever this thing may be, then it's the bunker. As far as they're aware, the books in the bunker's library has everything they need to know about every monster they've encountered, so if there's something about this, then it should be in there.
Dean glances over at Castiel, before he nods. "We go wherever our supervisor sends us." He says. "Now, we'd like to take a look at the bodies, please."
Kicking the door shut behind him, he pushes Castiel back towards the bed, and climbs on top of the angel as soon as he hits the bed.
Dean himself is seated at the table surfing through his own laptop searching for any possible clues on what the hell this could be. Unfortunately, he's not having much luck. And by the look on Castiel's face, it doesn't seem like he's able to find anything either.
Jack isn't entirely sure of the need for Dean to randomly exclaim that he and Castiel have finished making pie. But he supposes that's just how Dean is.
"Fine." He sighs. "But I still don't like it."
Dean hums in agreement. "Buffy's kinda hot ain't she?"
A small part of him feels like that's all that's going on here, but the hunter in him believes that to not be true. There's a chance that this vampire or whatever it is feeds on humans and the two dead werewolves were just a one time thing. He's not wanting to take any chances on this.
Castiel nods, watchung as everyone fixes themselves up a burger. Even Jack who appears to have finally came out of his room makes himself one.
Mary nods. "Anywhere specific you want us to decorate, or just everywhere?'
But at least Castiel was paying some attention to her to sense that there may be something off. And he
He gets up off the bed and makes his way over to Dean.
side, not
Dean nods. “Good.” He looks over to Castiel, indicating for him to follow. “Come on, Cas.”
Sam goes to speak, but stops as the sound of footsteps approaching can be heard, causing him and Castiel to turn, finding the footsteps belong to Dean.
"What's a cobiescu vampire?" Castiel asks.
Nodding, Castiel gets out of bed, waiting for Dean to follow. And to put some pants on….
He's not sure, but it's possible. Something did seem off about her after all.
Sam nods. He doesn’t see much point in bothering Jack right now if the kid is happy watching puppy videos on his laptop for now. Jack will be fine on his own anyway, but he’ll go see the kid later and tell him what’s going on after they’ve got all the Christmas decorations hidden somewhere where Dean can’t find them and dispose of them.
.” He says around a mouthful of pie. “I’m not having the bunker decorated in Christmas shit.”
They’re sticking to simple Christmassy meals that are easy to make… and well in their spending budget.
“Well, just so you don’t burn the bunker down.” Dean says, making his way towards the kitchen. “Come on!”
Castiel sets the arm down, moving closer to get a better look, finding werewolf fangs in place of human teeth. "I thought this was a vampire killing?" He asks, tilting his head a little in confusion. "Do vampires usually drink the blood of werewolves?"
hope it’s not going to be very soon. Hopefully they’ve got at least half an hour before shit hits the fan.
Castiel can’t help but let out a soft laugh. Of course Dean is hungry. “Well how about I attempt to make you a burger?”
Dean narrows his eyes at his brother and angel. He has a very strong feeling he knows why they've made this suggestion, but he doesn't make a comment about it, besides, going hunting with just Castiel doesn't sound so bad. Although Castiel may not quite understand a lot of human things still, but he's getting there. At least he's a
“Great.” Sam nods. “That should give us some time before Dean comes out and starts complaining about all of these decorations.” He says. “What about Jack?”
"Maybe because of the mess? Or it's just a little…" He looks around. "I don't know, pointless?"
“Dean, there’s no mention of beer on the list.” Jack says, watching as Dean sets a box of beer down in the shopping cart once they reach the aisle with the alcohol.
Dean knows Sam could be right, and these vampires are doing a good thing by keeping the werewolf population down, but they're still monsters. He thinks that maybe they should probably check this out a little more, just to be sure this isn't just a one off thing.
“You’re gonna watch?” Castiel asks.
Castiel isn't sure why Dean did that. He
But... in a way, he should have expected it. Sam is just trying to do a nice thing by planning to celebrate Jack's first Christmas, and their first Christmas with mom.
Jack smiles at the praise. He's happy that he could be of help to Dean and Castiel on the case without having gone out with them.
(See the end of the chapter for
Then again, as he watches Dean drag Castiel out of the kitchen, shouting that they'll be back out later, Jack guesses that maybe Dean had other motives for it. And it would probably be a very good idea not to go get them back out here anytime soon.
Jack frowns. "You're not going to make him take everything down are you?" He asks. "I was looking forward to having my first Christmas with all these decorations up."
Dean looks at his angel. "Sam here - and everyone else in this bunker apparently - wants to celebrate Christmas this year. I'm down for having a big feast." He says. "But they're wanting to decorate the bunker too - which I'm

it. Although, he's not going to admit it out loud. Hell no is he going to be admitting it.
He can see how Sam would get the idea that they're supposed to be a gag gift. Who the hell makes bacon flavoured candy canes? Though he won't lie, he's got to try these out.
Sighing, Castiel shakes his head as he takes a seat next to Dean. He doesn't particularly want to be here while Dean argues with Sam, but it might be best if he stays in case he needs to separate the two brothers for any reason.
Castiel looks to Dean, before turning to Jack. "Yes, it was." He says. "And well done for figuring out what it was, Jack." He pulls Jack in for a hug, proud of his son for figuring it out.
"Why don't you want them up so much, Dean?" Castiel asks, looking around the library. "They look okay to me. And look. It doesn't seem like they've gone too overboard."
Rolling his eyes, Castiel sighs at Dean’s words. “Remember what I told you, Dean.” He says. “The decorations stay up, or I-”
But Dean just keeps on bringing it back, seemingly not wanting to give up until Castiel tries it.
"Celebrate Christmas this year." Sam repeats. "And decorate the bunker. Decorating the bunker was more Eileen's idea than mine."
"You're back." Jack says, going on to give them a hug, but stops as he sees that Dean doesn't seem to be in a very good mood. "Uh... how did the case go?" He asks. "Was it a cobiescu vampire?"
Although, he’s certainly not sorry for initiating sex with Dean, and it
“I woke up and you weren’t next to me.” Dean says, wrapping his arms around his angel from behind. “And, why did the bunker suddenly start shaking, and why was there thunder?”
would it take him?"
The morgue would be the perfect place for her to hide in plain sight. Easy way for her to dispose of the bodies, and no one would think twice.
And Castiel is glad to hear it.

At that, Castiel raises an eyebrow, folding his arms as he tilts his head to the side a little. “Dean, you
"Really?" Sam asks, not entirely surprised that Dean doesn't find them too bad.
But decorating the bunker in Christmas decorations that he can only assume is going to make the bunker look like Rudolf threw up everywhere? No thank you. He
There will be
"I uh... nope." Sam says, before he's quick to change the subject as he sees Dean carrying his laptop. "What you got there?"
"Okay." Dean starts. "Well, Cas an' I will stick around here for a bit longer." He says. "Make sure you congratulate Jack for us in finding all this."
The Empty has taken his angel away from him, and it's final this time. Castiel is gone, and all Dean can do is sit on the floor of the bunker's dungeon and sob.
"I jus- I just am, okay!" Dean says. "If you and Eileen want to decorate your room, fine. But you're not... you're
Castiel looks at him. “Don’t we already get enough horror in our everyday lives?”
They had decided to stop off at some diner to get something to eat before checking into a motel. And of course, Dean just had to get one of the diner's biggest burgers.
And he thinks that just maybe they need to have a bit of a talk with her....
Dean looks between Sam and Castiel, before down at his laptop. "I found us a case about three towns over." He says. "Thought we should go check it out."
"Honestly? I don't know." Dean says.
While they wait for the pies to bake, they help Jack to decorate the cookies he’s made. They’re nothing fantastic, none of them have any artistic skill, but they turn out well. And Dean finds himself very impressed with the fact that Jack managed to make the cookies by himself and didn’t manage to burn any of them.
we can just cook a bunch of patties and if anyone's hungry they can make a burger or two themselves." Dean suggests. "I think that's the easiest way to go."
"Alright, here we go." Dean says, parking up the impala on the street outside the morgue. He looks over at Castiel. "You ready?"
"Alright, can do." Sam says, just getting off the phone with Dean.

Jack on the other hand though.... Sam's not sure if he has found anything. He had sent him down to look through the books in one of the storage rooms in the hopes that there may be something in there.
"He said he's sure they're werewolves, and the cause of death is consistent with a vampire killing. The bodies drained of all their blood and all..." Sam says.
Pizza now, then put up the tree either later or tomorrow. Sounds like a good idea.
Dean loved Castiel? And he never got the chance to tell him?
Sam stares at Dean. While Dean may be right, it's not like he hasn't gone and done worse behind his back before. And it's not like Christmas decorations will kill anyone.
Truthfully, he doesn't mind it when Castiel stares, but they've got something else that needs to be done instead of staring at each other in the showers. They need to make some food, cause he's hungry.
Dean sets his knife down on the bench, turning to face Castiel. He has a few things in mind that might help. If they can just get away from the others for an hour at least.
have the money for a real one anyway.
form of decorating?"
"Yup." Dean says, slipping on a jacket. "Fake badges, guns, knives, change of clothes, money for burgers, beer, and pie..." He lists off everything he's packed that they'll need. "It's all packet, Cas."
“Cas, you know it’s technically
He needs to have a word with them for buying Christmas decorations when he had told them not to. They went behind his back and bought them anyway, and he's not happy about it.
He hopes that Cas can hear him, but he knows that it's likely that he can't. Not in the Empty. But he's choosing to believe the small sliver of hope that Cas can hear him. He
Castiel stares at Sam. "So...
Sam and Eileen think they should all celebrate Christmas this year,
Dean's interest perks up at Sam's words, and he watches as Sam leaves the library to go grab whatever it is that he and Eileen had found. He's definitely interested to see what Sam had found for him.
There's no point in trying to get his own way with all this. Not when everyone else disagrees with him.
"Now, where's Sam?" Dean says. "I need to talk with him about all this crap." He gestures around the library at all the decorations. "It looks like Santa and his damn reindeers threw up in here."
As soon as they reach Jack's room, Castiel reads over the shopping list as Dean hands it to him. It doesn't appear to be anything too fancy that they need to buy, but hopefully they can find everything at the store that they need.
Castiel has been wearing more of his clothes lately instead of his own. Dean's not sure why, he's never bothered to ask. But he loves it.
"You know, leaving a tree in the library will be in full view of Dean, Sam." Castiel says. "He's going to see i as soon as he walks into the library."
"Thank you, Cas." Sam says, before turning to Dean, looking rather smug. "It's five against one, Dean. You're outnumbered." He says. "We're having Christmas this year and decorating the bunker."
“Last I checked, he was busy watching puppy videos on his laptop.” Mary says.
Thankfully, it doesn't take too much longer for Dean to finish off both his burger and the fries Castiel barely touched, before they're off to find a motel. But first, Dean insists they stop off at the store to get pie and a six pack of beer before checking into a motel....
Sam smiles at Castiel, glad to hear that the angel is down for celebrating and decorating the bunker. At least, that's what he gathers from what he had said. It's what it sounds like, so he's assuming he's up for it.
. It's all he wants. Forget defeating Chuck for a moment, he wants his angel back.
He doesn’t find himself caring right now in his arousal. He’ll deal with Sam later. For now though, he’s got something else to take care of.
“Here, try this.” Dean says, bringing a fork full of pie towards Castiel’s mouth.
more sense than placing a real angel on top of a Christmas tree. For a moment there Sam had him thinking people used real angels on their  trees.
"When the bodies are drained of all their blood, then yes." Castiel says.
He doesn't see what Dean's problem is....
“I just checked on Dean.” Mary says. “He and Cas are busy watching movies in their room.”
it'll be Jack's first. Shouldn't that warrant at least
Yes, Dean is down for that.
"Looking good, Cas." Dean says, slipping his shirt down over his head. "Gotta admit, you look good in my clothes."
At least he's not going to take everything down and ruin it for Jack.
"According to the lore on them Jack found, they don't feed on the blood of humans, instead they feed on an alternate blood source;
Though, just as they pass the door to Dean and Castiel’s room, Sam freezes as he hears the door open.
“You made these, Castiel?” Mary asks, surprised to hear that the angel was the one to make them all lunch.
Sam moves closer to get a better look at the tree. It's fake of course, but it looks almost exactly like a real pine tree. And it's a decent size too, not too big and not too small.
decorating the bunker. End of. Not happening."
"Help us carry all this into the kitchen, Sam." Dean says, passing over one of the bags he's carrying to his brother.
I gotta see!”
Unfortunately Dean knows the answer to that, but it hurts. It hurts so much, and he wishes it didn't have to be like that.
Castiel doesn't say anything in reply, but he does smile at Dean's words. He's not sure why he's been wearing Dean's clothes lately, but Dean seems to like it, so that seems like a good enough reason to keep wearing Dean' clothes more often. And he rather likes wearing Dean's clothes too.

Mary momentarily stops what she's doing to take a look at Jack's work. "It looks good, Jack."

for the time being. He can’t believe he’s even thinking about it, but he rather hopes that’s the case. Unfortunately he’s fully aware that when his brother and the angel are intimate with one another, they can take a very long time doing it. But in this instance, it’s somewhat of a good thing.
And there's no doubt that Dean will for sure complain about

Dean chuckles at the angel, shaking his head. He finds it cute when Castiel gets like that.
But he's not sure how much jelly he needs to make. They might have gone a little overboard with buying jelly. Ten boxes seems a little excessive, but they had a hard time at the store choosing which flavours to get, so they settled on getting one of each. It's just a good thing they were fairly inexpensive.
to do with that. Especially with the fact that Castiel had mentioned that there seemed to be something off about that woman.
are you so against decorating the bunker for Christmas, Dean?" Sam asks.
He's sitting in the bunker's library currently with Eileen, Jack, and Mary going over the game plan for getting the bunker all decorated for Christmas while Dean and Castiel are off on a hunt.
"Dean, come on...." Sam sighs. "This will be our first Christmas with Jack and mom. What's so wrong about decorating the bunker as well as celebrating?"
Although he has a slight worry that he added too much garlic and maybe a little bit more herbs than he was supposed to…. But Dean didn’t really tell him how much to use, so he hopes they’re okay.

At Mary's words, Jack smiles. He's glad to hear that Mary thinks he did a good job. Although he thinks he could possibly do something else to make it look a bit better, but he'll figure it out later, as he moves onto decorating a different part of the library.
"Let's hope the kid is awake." Dean says, before knocking on Jack's closed bedroom door. "Jack!"
