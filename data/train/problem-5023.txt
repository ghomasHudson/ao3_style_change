Dean cleared his throat but was spared from having to say anything further by the arrival of Sam and Eileen.
“What? He should know what kind of crazy he married into. Dean’s afraid of flying, Cas. You couldn’t pay him a million dollars to set foot on a plane.”
Dean closed his eyes and nodded, giving himself over to the inevitable. Leaned in, and slotted his lips to Cas’s.
Dean shoots upright and jabs furiously at the radio. The blush has spread to his ears. “Why does every fucking Christmas song sound so dirty,” he mutters under his breath.
She fought with his zipper and reached unceremoniously into his pants to stroke him. He squeezed his eyes shut tight, willing his dick to cooperate. But after a few moments of inactivity, her hand stilled and she leaned back, raising her eyebrow in question.
Cas pulled back abruptly and frowned, his wings falling away to trail along the floor. “Dean?”
couples things. And when they broke up, Cas would leave, and Dean can’t bear the thought of seeing Cas walk out of his life for good.
“Sex,” Dean explained. And then much more quietly, “With a guy.”
Cas said he struggled with depression. His family were a bunch of dicks. Hell, Dean was a dick. Maybe if he had been there, Cas wouldn’t have done this. Dean could have made it better, could have talked to Cas, could have made him smile. He could have found the goddamn balls to reciprocate Cas’s heartfelt affections.
Castiel looked up and was worried to see Dean’s expression had turned serious as well. This was it. Dean was going to say everything was over. They couldn’t possibly be friends anymore, not after all this.
“No, it’s fine,” Cas said. “You told me about your family. It’s actually...well, let’s just say we have some things in common.” He cleared his throat. “My family is very religious, so…” he trailed off and looked at Dean expectantly.
-----
“Right,” Sam said, snapping into action. “Okay we can fix this. There’s gotta be a way to reverse the spell.”
“Yeah, Dean. I love her. I know you think this was spur of the moment, but it’s really not. I’ve loved her for a long time. You’re the only person I want there with me, but you should know that I’m doing this with or without you.”
Right, coffee. Castiel sets to work measuring the grounds into the filter, and filling the carafe with water. This, he can do. If he is useful in nothing else, at least he can make coffee for Dean. He first learned how to brew a pot when he was human and working at the Gas & Sip. That had been where he’d had his first taste as well, making every effort to blend in with the humans around him who all consumed the rich, hot liquid like it was some sort of magical elixir. Which really, Castiel supposed it was, if its effects on Dean in the mornings were any indication.
“Cas.”
He peered over Sam’s shoulder at the leather-bound volume he was pulling out of his bag. “What is it?”
All three of them jumped to Sam’s aid as the cat dug its claws into Sam’s denim and clung tightly as Sam shook his leg. Kevin got there first and pried the cat off.
Dean stared at him in horror and curled himself around Cas’s bowl, pulling it close to his chest. “It’s not an
Now that they were back safely in the bunker and research well underway, Dean’s panic from earlier had eased off. He yawned and his eyes glazed over the passage he was reading on animal curses. He sighed, then grinned. “This book is just so ribbeting, I can’t put it down.” He prodded at Cas with the end of his spoon. “Get it?”
He wondered if maybe he should have tried to find some kind of cage for transport. What was to stop the cat from climbing all over him while he was driving? Or worse, attacking him like she had Sam? Cas had never had a cat before. He liked them well enough, and he always stopped to feed stray cats whenever he could. But he’d never had one in his home before, nor in his car, and he wasn’t too sure what to expect.
Dean rolls over and pulls the sheets up to his neck. He lets out another yawn, and Castiel can hear his breathing begin to even out. It isn’t until he can hear soft snores from the other side of the bed that Castiel dares to speak the words:
Today though, Dean didn’t feel free or alive. He felt like shit. The drive seemed to go on forever; certainly much longer going back home than it had been coming. He couldn’t shake the feeling that he was headed in the wrong direction.
“You know,” Dean said between mouthfuls of food, “even once you’re back to normal, I wouldn’t mind if you wanted to watch over my shoulder while I’m cooking.
On Saturday, he pulls his impala — his baby — out of the garage and into the driveway. He waits until Castiel is outside gardening before he heads outside himself to wash his car wearing his short shorts that leave little to the imagination.
began.
Cas stands abruptly, sending various cats scattering and furrows his brow in concern. “Dean, what are you doing? You shouldn’t be here.”
He shifted in Cas’s lap, rolled his hips down. Cas let out a filthy groan and Dean’s fingers clenched where they were buried in the back of Cas’s wings.
"Yeah, uh.. excuse me, sorry," Dean muttered, suddenly distracted by the sight of Cas across the room looking profoundly out of place.
Before, Castiel always wondered what it would be like to be with Dean, and he allowed himself the private agony of contemplating
Cas moaned his admiration, and Dean quickly turned his attention back to the stovetop.
Things take a turn for the worse the day the batteries die in the TV remote. Castiel is poking around on the TV when he stumbles onto graphic porn. He scrambles to change the channel as the sound of exaggerated moaning fills the room, but the remote refuses to work.
It wasn’t until that night, when the texts had stopped for good, and Dean was lying in bed alone and listening to his father snore loudly down the hall, that he realized with a sharp pang that he was maybe a little in love with the dorky idiot. And that, just maybe, he had made a terrible mistake by leaving. Dean laughed out loud at the impeccable timing of this particular moment of insight that came with all the grace of a swift kick in the nuts.
The panic in Dean’s chest turned to white hot rage, but he shoved it all down. He felt his jaw twitch, but otherwise, presented a stoic face to the doctor.
didn’t want to come because it was an open and shut case.”
“Holy shit. Delete that!”
"Because whatever shit you made me drink last night turned me into a fucking cat."
“That’s weird,” Dean says. “How can that be playing if the car’s off?”
They texted regularly, and even skyped every week or so. Eileen often joined in and Dean grew to love her more and more each day. Sam seemed truly happy, and more relaxed with her than he had ever seen him before. Eileen would lean into Sam unconsciously, Sam’s arm would wrap around her, and he would get this dopey grin on his face whenever she wasn’t looking. It was cute as hell to watch, but it always left Dean with a peculiar sort of ache in his chest whenever he was faced with their easy intimacy with one another.
“I already said I was sorry about the coffee this morning.”
“It was the only way I could reach you,” Cas frowned. “And these aren’t exactly the real things either,” he said with a sigh. “They’re sort of a… manifestation, and will remain as such until they’re fully healed, I think. The real ones are much larger, but don’t translate to this plane of existence while I’m contained to a vessel. They’re more vulnerable when materialized this way. More… sensitive.”
An hour later, Cas was loathe to move. The cat had drifted closer and closer to him, and was now sprawled across his lap with her belly in the air. Her head hung upside down off the other side of his lap, eyes half closed, tongue hanging out just a bit, and purring louder than Castiel had realized was possible for a creature of her size.
“Merry Christmas, Cas.”
“Dean?” Castiel asks, his deep voice pitching higher than normal.
At work the next day, Dean buries himself under the hood of an old Toyota for most of the afternoon. He tries to keep distracted, but his thoughts inevitably stray back to Cas. He doesn’t want to think about it—tries really hard not to—but a niggling feeling in the back of his brain and a sinking feeling in his gut have him examining the the past week in detail.
Dean emits a noise that lands somewhere between a laugh and a sob and pulls Cas into a tight hug. He burrows his face in Cas’s hair and finds himself unwittingly murmuring over and over again, “I’ve got you, Cas. You’re okay. I’ve got you,” the reassurance more for himself than for Cas.
talk, about important shit and how they feel about things.
“It’s what he calls me,” Cas explained with an embarassed shrug.
“Are these my fantasies or yours, Dean?”
Cas wandered back into the living room with the tuna and nearly dropped it.
And so, Dean stood in the middle of Cas’s living room modeling not the first, not the second, but the third suit Cas had picked out for him from his closet.
He’s so lost in thought that he nearly misses seeing the beige Continental out of the corner of his eye. Dean slams on the brakes and stares. There, parked in a tiny strip mall plaza next to the sleazy motel—that’s nowhere near Cas’s office—is Cas’s ugly-ass car.
Once home, Dean makes himself scarce and Castiel busies himself with job applications. He considers one which would take him out of state. Perhaps it’s time for a fresh start. Maybe moving halfway across the country will be the push he needs to finally get over Dean and move on with his life.
“I… uh… that would… yeah, okay. Yeah, that would be… uh… nice, yeah. Thanks.” Dean groans inwardly, but Castiel’s face lights up. The smile from the other day is back— the one that sets butterflies fluttering inside Dean.
It was warm and safe, and Dean felt himself beginning to get sleepy. But as much as Dean wanted to stay there forever, he knew he couldn’t. He couldn’t lose himself here, couldn’t get too comfortable. This was just supposed to be a fun time.
Something inside of him snaps, and just like that, Dean is struck with the sudden, painful realization of several things in quick succession.
Cas breathes out loudly, and Dean flinches, his heart hammering in his chest.
“Yeah Cas, we can be done. We’re done. C’mere.” He pats the space next to him on the bed. Cas hesitates in the doorway for a moment, his hands in fists at his side. Dean pats the bed again and Cas seems to jolt out of some kind of stupor, and this time he comes, collapsing in a heap on the other side of the bed.
“Dean? What’s the matter, son?” he asked, crouching down next to him.
Cas cocked his head to the side and squinted at him like he was deranged.
"You can say that again. Come on. Let's go get some food and scope out the place."
Dean lost track of time entirely as Cas slowly dismantled him piece by piece, until Dean was a sobbing, quivering mess. A long time must have passed, because Dean found himself hard again, leaking onto the sheets beneath him. He tried to move, tried to generate some friction, but it was just not enough.
“Dude, it’s rabid! Stay away!” Even Meg and Kevin had backed up a couple steps.
"Why do the costumes have to be sexy?" Cas asked, as Dean held various clothes and props up to Cas and pursed his lips in consideration of each one.
This was not good. This was not shaping up to be a quick and easy fuck. Not that they’d even managed to get to the fucking part. Dean sighed.
Dean dove for cover behind the couch and Cas managed to call the bird back to him. It perched happily on Cas’s shoulder and nuzzled against his face. “Asshole,” it cooed softly.
“I am not!” Dean snaps. He closes his eyes briefly and takes a deep breath. “I’m not,” he tries again, quieter.
That’s why Castiel smiles fondly at Dean as he shuffles into the kitchenette wearing only his t-shirt and boxers. He pours himself a cup of coffee and collapses onto the small sofa that squeaks under his weight. Dean looks rumpled and sleepy, but well. He’s relaxed and whole– he feels safe, Castiel realizes. Comfortable and happy. So happy. It warms Castiel’s heart, even as he feels a small, sharp sting somewhere at the realization that Dean has managed just fine without him in the time since Castiel has been in the Empty.
He clicked to the next track, and the next. Bubbly, peppy pop songs filled the room and Dean groaned. This was not at all what he had in mind when he had told Cas to update his playlists. He moved the disc changer to the next CD and Zeppelin came through the speakers. Much better. He flicked ahead to the next track, which Dean recognized, and unless he was very much mistaken, this particular ordering of songs was…
Sam’s voice turned serious. “You were always there for me growing up, and my childhood wouldn’t have been what it was without you, Dean. I can’t imagine not having you there, and well…” he looked over at Eileen and put his arm around her shoulder. “I want you there for my kid, too.”
“Hey now, he’s not
“I went back for him after the—well, uh. After the Michael thing. I remembered that we’d locked him in the trunk and I let him out once I was sure he’d shifted back to himself. He was so grateful he swore he was naming his next child after me. I assumed it was just a figure of speech.”
They makes plans for drinks at Castiel’s house that evening. As Dean walks back to his own place, willing himself not to skip with glee, Castiel calls after him.
“What the fuck?” Dean shoves hard at Cas’s shoulder.
Sam cleared his throat. “Well, Cas. I told my brother here that I was getting married. He reacted… poorly. Started going off about shotgun weddings and rash decisions.”
The sun was in fact shining through a large window, glinting off a mirror. Dean blocked out the light with his hand and continued his survey of the room, which was large and swanky, but looked like it had been ransacked. There was a Renaissance style painting that appeared to have fallen off the wall and was resting crooked on the floor. There were clothes strewn everywhere. A tan coloured coat over a chair, black dress pants hanging on the edge of the mirror, a shoe halfway under the painting. Dean recognized his own jeans crumpled in a heap at the end of the bed and looked down startled to discover that he was entirely naked. He grabbed frantically for the sheets and pulled them down over himself, which only succeeded in pulling them off of his bedmate and further exposing the nakedness of the man peering down at him.
“Everything we’ve ever done, everything we are, is because Chuck wrote it that way. It’s worse than I thought, Cas. I can’t even pick a damn lock, anymore. I—I’m not even sure I know who I am.”
"Yeah," Sam nodded. "Perfect opportunity for monsters of any kind to blend in with their surroundings, really. What do you say, Dean? Should we check it out?"
As Dean's breathing returned to normal and he quivered through the aftershock, he became aware of Cas's hands stroking up and down his back in soothing motions. He was laid boneless against him, their chests flush together, and Dean's head buried just above Cas's shoulder in a spread of feathers. They smelled distinctly like Cas, but much stronger—ethereal, like the crisp air before a storm, and familiar, like home. Both wings, he realized, had arched around and wrapped him in a sort of cocoon of warmth. Dean held his breath as reality settled in and a sudden, overwhelming shyness returned. He wasn’t sure if he should move.
It’s far better that they just remain friends, and better still that Dean keeps his big mouth shut.
“We haven’t yet determined the severity of his neck and back injuries,” she said. “Paralysis is entirely possible, but frankly, it’s a secondary concern at the moment. First, we need to get him stable and see if he wakes up. If he does…” she trailed off and her gaze narrowed on Dean, sizing him up. “You should prepare yourself for the possibility that he won’t be the same. He’s suffered a major head injury, and the effect that will have on his brain function remains to be seen.”
Dean glares at Ishim, who could crush him like a bug, and Cas feels a swell of affection for Dean’s reckless impudence.
-----
Cas’s arms tightened around him, pulling him close, chests flush together. Wings encircled them both. “I’m right here, Dean,” he whispered in his ear, voice low and deep, sending shivers down Dean’s spine.
“Sure thing,
Dean closed the cage door carefully and watched the parrot peck aggressively at the pellets lining the cage floor. He decided he’d wait until the bird had eaten his fill before he’d risk opening the cage again to fill the water.
“I don’t deserve you.”
They watch a lot of TV and old movies. They’re nearly foiled by the remote control, before Cas has the bright idea to use his tongue to press the buttons.
~~~~~
Cas hummed, and kissed the tip of Dean’s cock, which was painfully hard now and leaking. Without warning, Dean felt a finger move low and circle his rim. It was a soft touch, just a gentle brush against his skin, but Dean’s whole body convulsed and before he knew what was happening, he was coming all over his stomach in hot, thick streaks.
Cas had to admit, even with the awkward position, this was kind of nice. He was warm, and comfortable. He could probably get used to having a small, furry companion around.
into a pond. A frog agrees to retrieve it for her if she will love him and keep him as a companion. Her father, the king, makes her keep her promise and she must carry the frog around with her to eat from her plate and sleep on her pillow.”
As Dean draws closer, still oblivious, Castiel can’t seem to stop himself. He reaches out a hand and brushes softly over Dean’s bare chest. Dean inhales sharply and Cas risks looking up to meet his gaze. They stare at each other both unspeaking, before looking down to where Castiel’s hand is still pressed to Dean’s chest, just above his heart.
Cas shrugged. “I’ve always been very fond of languages.” His long fingers moved in intricate motions too fast for Dean to catch. Dean watched in fascination, his heart swelling at the smile that broke out on Sam and Eileen’s faces in response.
Castiel arches an eyebrow in question and Dean just scowls back at him. “It’s too dark. I won’t be able to get a good look at her until the storm lets up to see what’s wrong.”
“Cheese still needs to be grated.”
“I’m sure you were a very good dancer.”
Pure, unadulterated terror coursed through Dean and he stood, stock still, in the middle of his ex-husband’s living room, hands full of his CDs. He might as well have been rifling through his underwear drawer. Dean considered hiding and looked around frantically.
Sam crouched next to him. "What the hell?"
“I've done this with Sam before for fourth of July,” he says. “I figure we've got about thirty seconds before—”
Dean breathed out. “It’s fine, we managed. I took care of Sammy. I always have. I got a bunch of part-time jobs to keep us afloat when Dad couldn’t manage or was off on a bender. Dropped out of school when it got bad, but I wasn’t much good at school anyway. Sammy was always the smart one. I was so proud of him when he got into Stanford, but it kind of tore me apart at the same time, you know? He left and….”
Sam picked up on the fourth ring, his voice slurred with sleep. "Cas?"
If you're so inclined, I'd appreciate any feedback of the good or bad variety. Constructive criticism is completely welcome! This is my first time writing anything longer than a coda, so I'd like to be able to take your suggestions and improve for next time.
When he came back out, Cas handed him the annulment papers. “I finished them while you were gone today,” he said. His voice was quiet, barely more than a whisper, and sounded hollow. “If this is what you want, you just need to sign here and here, then I’ll take care of everything tomorrow.”
“I don’t know.” And Dean really doesn’t know, doesn’t have a clue. “We’re not exactly ready to take on God, not in this state. Weren’t even sure we could, before, but now… now we’re just… nobodies.
Dean snorts and Cas shushes him.
Then he thinks of some of the things he’s said to Cas just this past week alone when he lashed out in anger and how Cas had taken that too.
“Let’s go then.”
“Shit. Okay, we need a lawyer. My brother’s in pre-law. If we did get married, he might be able to help us get a divorce. Or an annulment. You can do that if you don’t consummate the marriage, right?”
There was another bang, a flash of lightning, and the outline of something pressed against the door. Sam lurched back, and Cas topped off the edge of his seat with a squeal. He felt somewhat vindicated by the fact that even Meg and Kevin had jumped a little this time. Kevin hit pause on the video as they all turned their attention to the backyard.
“Dean,” Cas says as he climbs off.
“Of course, Dean.”
Dean was mentally calculating the time and distance to Vegas when Bobby returned.
“Well alright then,” Dean said. “I guess Kermit’s coming with me.” He grinned and picked up the bowl. “Let’s hop to it, Cas.”
“What?”
bad.” Dean scritched the top of Cas’s head and Cas rubbed himself against Dean’s hand in response. “Not even that slimy, really.” He scooped him up and held him out to Sam.
“Cas, we need to talk,” he says, eyes fixed on the ground.
Dean rolled his eyes. “For fuck’s sake, he’s just a frog. Look, it’s not that hard.” Dean planted a quick kiss to the top of Cas’s head to demonstrate.
“That sounds accurate,” Cas said, and Dean detected a hint of softness in his voice now.
“Anyway, the Disney movie is based on the story of The Frog Prince. A spoiled princess accidentally drops a
He made his way back to Cas’s place late that evening, feeling like absolute scum. What he found when he returned only made it a million times worse.
He couldn’t seem to stop smiling when he returned to work. Bobby’s eyebrow arched so high it threatened to slide right off his forehead and he mumbled something that sounded suspiciously like “love-struck idjit.”
his brain supplied. And yes, Dean would be here tonight. That would make it worth it, right? He smoothed down his shirt and knocked on the door. He heard yelling from within, and heavy footsteps heading to the door.
A cute brunette waitress greeted them and showed them to a booth. Out of deference to whatever the hell it was he had with Cas at the moment, Dean did his best not to check her out.
Cas has always been besotted with his stupid pet ferret, which Dean maintains is really just a longer, smellier rat. But Cas and the ferret are a package deal so Dean insists they both come stay with him. Cas is reluctant at first, not wanting to impose. Dean snorts, indignant and deeply offended at the idea that Cas could ever think of himself as an imposition, until they finally hit on the crux of Cas’s hesitation.
He handed over a stack of forms. “I’ve printed these off for you. You’ll need to fill them out, both of you sign, and then submit them to the courts here in Vegas. The courthouse probably won’t be open until Monday now,” Sam mused.
“I’m sorry, I gotta… I gotta go.” Dean said, trying to walk and hop into his jeans at the same time in his hurry to leave. He made it out of the bedroom and was nearly at the front door and pulling his shirt over his head when Cas called to him again.
But now Dean’s offering to trade blow jobs. It’s not something Castiel ever imagined being able to have, and he knows it’s a terrible idea. Dean obviously doesn’t feel the same way; his proposal is both pragmatic and temporary. Once they quell their raging libidos things will return to normal. Castiel isn’t sure he’ll ever be able to go back to normal after something like this though— to have such close intimacy with Dean only to have it snatched away. But if they do nothing, Castiel will spend the rest of his life wondering
“Oh no. When he gets out, he’ll be in the ICU. Because you’re not family, you won’t be able to see him until we’re certain he’s stable. I suggest you go home, get some sleep, and come back tomorrow rested.”
"It's fine," Cas said, but slumped against Dean's chest.
Dean’s breathing evens out and he clears his throat. “You uh, want me to take care of that?”
Dean pulled another chair next to Castiel and spun it around so he straddled the back of it. It squealed on the tile and Castiel looked up. The apron just barely covered Dean’s spread legs.
Dean was crestfallen. “I have failed you as your big brother,” he said with gravitas.
“What?”
“Waiting for you.”
Dean looks between them, confused. "Someone want to clue me in?"
“Sam told me all about him, you idjit.”
Dean spun around again. “Dude!” He spluttered. “Stop objectifying me.”
He gets there, briefly. But loses it again before Cas can fully settle in his lap, nowhere near as hard as he needs to be. As he should be. Arousal thrums in him, but abstractly, a dull ache, ghosting around the edges and out of reach.
“And you said it was a gold ball?”
Cas was fastening the third button from the bottom when Dean realized his mouth was hanging open; he snapped it shut and turned around quickly. In his haste to leave he walked headfirst into the doorframe and swore loudly.
“I’ll take her,” Cas said, cutting her off before she could continue. Three sets of eyes turned to look at him. Four, if you counted the cat. “What? I think she’s cute. I’ll give her some food and a warm place to stay tonight, and I’ll drop her off at the vet’s first thing tomorrow when they open. They’ll either find who she belongs to, or find her a new home.”
Back in the living room, Dean spread the papers out on the coffee table again. His car would be ready the following morning, so he was anxious to get everything finished today. Though, the thought of leaving Vegas– of leaving Cas– was beginning to make Dean feel a bit…
As he walks, an unfamiliar voice echoes in his head:
“We would hate for our baby girl to grow up without her uncles around,” Eileen said, one hand on her belly.
Dean looked around and tapped Eileen on the shoulder. “Isn’t anyone else coming?”
Dean can feel his face burning and he squeezes his eyes shut, willing himself to focus. He grabs his own cock in hand and strokes furiously, coaxing his erection into hardness.
Dean coughs. “He said, ‘I know.’ Fucker. Granted, he was wearing a tux, too, and had just finished a pretty impressive tap routine himself, so who even knows. Maybe I imagined the whole thing. And when I was finally coherent again, I was too scared to ask but he smiled at me in that fucking Garth way, you know?”
Dean does a double-take and stares slack-jawed. There, sitting on the floor just inside  the front window, is Cas and a cat. A whole bunch of cats, actually. ANIMAL RESCUE, the sign on the door reads, as Dean pushes it open. A bell dings loudly and Cas looks up in surprise. A redhead also looks up from where she’s filing papers at the front desk, but anything she might have been about to say is lost under Cas’s voice of surprise.
And he tries, he really does. But he lays there, long into the night, always listening carefully for the sound of Cas’s breathing and glancing over every so often to see his shoulders rise and fall with each breath. In and out. In and out.
he typed back.
Dean turned full circle to look at Cas, doing nothing to hide his incredulity. There was even, he noted with amazement, pancake batter splattered in the man’s hair. Cas looked startled and bewildered, and held up his hands in a helpless, sticky mess.
chirped the bird, once Cas had left the room, and Dean jumped. He moved closer to the birdcage, peering at the parrot.
He caves now.
“Hey, it’s okay,” Cas said, keeping his voice as soft and soothing as he could muster. “I know life must be awfully scary for you right now. I promise you’re safe here. Nothing’s going to hurt you. I’ll take care of you, and tomorrow we’ll get you checked over by the doc. Maybe we can even find where you came from and get you reunited with your family. Hmm? How ‘bout that?”
“Got you on a flight out of Kansas City that leaves in an hour if you want it,” he said. “You better step on it though, if you want to make it in time.”
They had moved to sit on the couch, albeit rather stiffly, each occupying opposite ends with a long expanse between them. Dean itched to move closer and narrow the gap, but Cas was sitting as far away from him as it was possible to get without sitting on the armrest, so he stayed put.
The panic he had felt a few moments earlier was nothing to what he felt now.
“Any luck in Heaven?” Dean asks as Cas makes a beeline to him. Cas looks exhausted, his shoulders hunched and weary, so Dean’s pretty sure he knows the answer.
“Dean and I have been through a lot together.” Castiel isn’t sure how much to tell her and so he stops there. Has Dean told her how they met? How her firstborn was ripped apart in the depths of hell and how Castiel pulled him out? Not likely, he thinks. Dean has been treading delicately around Mary, terrified of overwhelming her. Although understandable, Castiel thinks this is an unfounded worry. Mary is much stronger than Dean gives her credit for, he can tell that about her already.
“Dude, that was epic. Battle scars to prove it!” Dean holds up his bandaged hands. His smile is cocky and self-assured, but Castiel can hear the small quiver in his voice that belies his confidence.
“It just seems a shame, is all.” Cas said. “I married a… a Greek God.” He gestured haphazardly at Dean. “I had what was likely the best sex of my life with you, and I don’t even remember it.” He turned to face Dean fully, staring intensely. “I just wish I remembered being with you,” he said very softly, with another sad, slow smile. He dropped his head heavily, and stared at his lap.
“The other day, when I was calling to Meg, and— I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have laughed.” Castiel looks pretty devastated, actually. He looks about as embarrassed and uncomfortable as Dean felt the other day.
“Goodnight, beautiful.” Cas kissed the top of her head, then turned in for the night.
“Does he know any words?” Dean asked, gesturing to the bird.
If it were only about himself he would have caved years ago.
“You never asked.”
“But you live in Vegas!” said Dean incredulously. “Surely you must be living it up here.”
Cas pulled back, and with a firm hand to Dean’s chest, shoved him down onto the bed. Dean fell back, grinning, and landed with a soft thump. Cas came sidling after him, his weight pressing Dean down into the mattress. That too, was a new sensation. Cas was a solid line of hard, unrelenting muscle where before it had always been soft flesh and curves. The hot, heavy weight bearing down on him made Dean feel surprisingly vulnerable in a way he never had before. But it also made him feel oddly safe and he was startled to realize just how much he trusted the man sprawled on top of him, pinning him to the bed.
Of course, Cas could say yes. He might be willing to give it a try. And then everything—
“Dean Winchester and Castiel Novak?” came a call from the chapel. Dean looked up and turned in his seat, nearly falling out of it in nervous excitement. “We’re ready for you!”
“Yes,” Cas relents. “It’s… what I would have liked. But it would mean about a twenty percent cut in pay and we’re not exactly swimming in money here.”
“Inside—?” Sam frowned and opened the lid to the cooler and jumped back in surprise for the second time in as many minutes. He glared at Dean. “That’s a frog. In the cooler.” His nose wrinkled. “The cooler that we put
Dean’s face goes bright red. “You’re right, it was stupid. Forget it.”
Dean takes a deep, steadying breath and sinks into the chair next to him. Everything’s laid bare now and Dean drops his head to his hands, caving finally to the inevitable.
He waits until Castiel is close enough, until he’s within hearing range, before he looks him square in the eye, and smiles wider. He runs his hand over Baby’s hood, and as seductively as he can manage, he purrs, “Hey there, sweetheart.”
Just this once, Cas thinks. Just this once and then he will confess and repent and never be tempted again.
Of course, having Dean there might make everything worse. He would witness firsthand what an absolute wimp Castiel was. Did he really want Dean to see him cowering behind the couch with his hands over his ears? Because that’s what happened the last time he tried to watch a scary movie.
“If I plan to do anything else stupid, I’ll let you know.”
“I shit you not.”
“Bitch.”
Cas pulled back first, and Dean stumbled forward in a daze, steadied by firm hands on his shoulders.
Cas says nothing, just glares at him every so often over the top of his paper.
Dean let out a breathy laugh. “Yeah, well, I meant it when I said I sucked at relationships. I’m a colossal fuckup, Cas. I don’t know how to do this. Any of this.” He shrugged helplessly. “But I know that my life got a little brighter that weekend in Vegas when I woke up next to you. And when I left, it got… darker again. I thought I was doing the right thing, but now I’m not so sure.”
Dean comes apart beneath him. His moans fill the room, and his bandaged hands grapple at Castiel’s back. Castiel wishes he could feel Dean’s nails drag down his spine, that their marks might leave him with something — anything — after this is over. While Dean lets loose a stream of colourful expletives, Cas remains stoically quiet but for his laboured breathing, too afraid of what words may escape were he to open his mouth.
Suddenly desperate, Dean grappled clumsily with Cas’s belt, managed to get it only partway unhooked before Cas ripped it in two and tossed it to the floor like it had personally wronged him.
“Thanks,” Sam said brightly, and Eileen patted him on the arm in agreement. “I’m not doing family law though, which is why I don’t know this too well. I’m more interested in civil rights or environmental law.”
Often Cas would send him dorky little jokes.
He’s good at that part— keeping his mouth shut and locking it all up inside. His secret to holding it in is to let it out in small, private moments so as not to burst with the force of it all and accidentally spill his sloppy heart out all over Cas at inopportune times.
for all that long. The enormity of sharing his life like this with Cas still catches him off guard sometimes and leaves him breathless. It’s everything he’s ever wanted, but a part of him never really expected he’d get to have it.
Eileen raised an eyebrow, smiling. Sam laughed. “No strippers.”
Castiel often brewed coffee for Dean at the bunker when they were between cases and mornings were a slow, lazy affair. Those were the nights when Dean slept soundest—when there were no cases to worry about, no apocalypse looming, no monster on the horizon. Over the years, Dean had begun to shed his layers when he went to bed, and since Castiel’s time as a human, he had come to understand that clothes were an odd sort of protection. When you went to sleep scared, not knowing when you’d need to wake quickly and defend yourself, it was safest not to get too comfortable.
“I think I’ve got it!” Sam finally announced, breaking the monotonous silence.
"It's me, you ass," said Dean.
“No. I can call it though. What’s your number?”
“I see that. Thank you!” Cas took a huge bite and moaned. “This is incredible, Dean.”
"It tasted like ass," Dean scowled, and Castiel stared at him in fascination. It was precisely the same scowl the cat had worn the previous night and how could he not have recognized that expression earlier?
Dean laughed. “It’s a terrible place for a lamp anyway. We’ve broken it twice now.”
“You cook like that, you can stay as long as you want,” Cas grinned.
Dean moans again in response and Castiel tries to pull away.
“I heard everything,” Cas says. “How long?”
Cas’s voice was low and husky when he spoke next. “Perhaps we should get going if we don’t want to be late.”
Cas’s apartment was dark and empty when Dean let himself in. He reached over instinctively to flick a light on, and heard the bird startling to rustle around in the other room.
“It’s getting late.” Dean announced, even though it wasn’t. “We should… go… to bed…”
“So, what now?” Cas says eventually.
He nudges one of the beers at Dean, then slides the other down to Charlie, who is seated on Dean's other side. As she reaches, their fingers brush and Charlie visibly flinches. Castiel pulls his hand back quickly, but the exchange does not go unnoticed by Dean.
Dean let out a long, shaky breath.
“You’re freaking out now,” Cas points out calmly.
"Are we going to talk about it?"
Dean opened his mouth, but nothing came out.
“I dusted the witch,” Dean said. “But not before she got Cas. She was aiming for me and Cas—there was this little gold ball that she threw at me and Cas jumped in front of it and—” he peered over the edge of the cooler. “You dumb sonofabitch,” he muttered. “It should have been me.”
“Course you have, Rapunzel,” Dean said, grinning.
-----
“Yeah. It kind of poofed into gold dust and got all over Cas. I was able to get the shot that took her down, but by then Cas was… well.”
- A hospital scene where Dean is given some bad news that Cas has been in an accident
Dean set the needle down to respond.
"I—" Dean started, and then cleared his throat, thinking better of continuing that sentence. "Cowboy?" he offered instead, holding his Stetson up to Cas's head.
This was bad. Castiel sighed and slumped into the kitchen chair nearest to him, letting his head fall into his hands. “Of course, Dean. Always. But if you heard me last night, then you already know that.” He rubbed wearily at his temples.
“You brought your mother?”
Cas was hard. Thicker than Dean expected, and curved just slightly at the end. He stared, enraptured, stroking him steadily, letting his thumb slide across the head.
There are surprisingly few things they can do without the use of their hands. Nearly every board game at the cabin requires the use of fine motor skills; Monopoly is out of the question entirely. Cas gets one of the little green houses wedged in his bandages and spends the rest of the afternoon trying to pull it out with his teeth.
“It’s been sitting awhile, so it’s probably cold by now. I’m sorry.” Cas looked dreadful. His shoulders were slumped low, his eyes sagged, and his whole face was lined with exhaustion.
“You can keep me from driving, Dean. Not from hunting.”
“Cas!” With a wince, Castiel turns to see Dean in the bed next to him sporting identical bandages on his hands. Dean’s face is pale and contorted with worry.
They arrived before Sam and Eileen and so Dean took the opportunity to talk up the bartender to see if he could glean any information from the previous night. She took one look at the two of them and broke into a gigantic grin.
“Damn straight I do. Tell me about it.”
“Dean.”
Dean always hated storms— that is, until one burst through the door of a barn and took root in his soul, flooded him wholly, and washed the darkest edges clean.
“It’s okay,” he said. “You don’t have to tell me. I don’t–”
“Right. Yeah.” Dean straightened, blinked rapidly, and gave his head a shake. This was going to be a long night.
“Sam,” Dean drawls, “went to sleep. After his laptop got a virus, and the wifi went down, and he nearly electrocuted himself trying to fix the modem, he called it quits on today and turned in.”
“You’ll make a very good lawyer, Sam” said Cas, and Dean marvelled at the fluidity of his hand gestures as he signed to Eileen.
break up with Dean?
“The mugger.” Cas said. “Is he— will he live?”
But all at once, there was a sudden gust of wind. A blinding flash. A sweep of something long and dark across Dean's line of sight.
Dean shivers. “Is it still a criminal offence? Is that why we never… you know?”
“Oh, Dean,” Cas murmured. He brushed his lips softly against Dean’s, then pulled back. Warm blue eyes studied Dean for a long moment, searching his face. Then he kissed him again, squarely on the nose. “Are you ready for this?”
When he landed in Vegas, Dean hailed a taxi and went straight to the hospital. He made his way through endless off-white walls that smelled of disinfectant and death. A volunteer directed him to central reception, who directed him back to the emergency room. The calm, unhurried demeanor of everyone he talked to made him want to scream.
“Blow jobs, Cas,” Dean huffs. “We could give each other blow jobs. If we both promise to close our eyes, we could just kinda pretend, you know? Come on, I dare you.”
Dean sighed, fingering the ring in his pocket. He hated telling this story. Truth be told, he didn’t tell it to many people. But something about the earnest look in Cas’s eyes made Dean relax; and besides, it wasn’t like he was ever going to see Cas again after today. Still, it wasn’t a conversation he was particularly keen to prolong.
Cas remained in the middle of the sigil, still looking very much like a disgruntled frog.
“Right, okay. For the omelettes, you gotta flip them at just the right moment. If you wait too long they’ll burn, and if you flip ‘em too soon they’ll fall apart and run all over the place.”
Dean lit the match and tossed it into the bowl.
He doesn’t need sleep, not really. But Dean’s insisting he get some rest, and it’s not a bad idea.
“Is who okay?” Dean furrowed his brow in confusion.
Dean waited expectantly for more, but Cas changed focus quickly.
The hunt is done and they are heading home, just in time for Christmas. But the two of them have been bickering for hours. They do this
Suddenly feeling as though he was intruding on something intensely personal, Dean hastily ripped a single sheaf of paper from the first half of the notebook— a rougher sketch of bird that Cas clearly hadn’t been happy with, as he’d scribbled over it. He closed the notebook and set it carefully back in the desk, shutting the drawer quietly.
As it turned out, Dean Winchester was the marrying type after all. And with this wedding, he was determined to never forget a single moment.
A clamor behind them. "Holy shit, dude!" Dean looked up to see that a college kid had appeared in the doorway. Others crowded behind him. "That was some fucking incredible special effects."
She squealed excitedly and Sam’s smirk took on a level of smugness Dean hadn’t realized was possible.
“Pleasant?”
“Sam, can you please tell Cas not to leave dirty dishes in the sink?”
Dean wandered down the bunker’s halls carrying Cas in the bowl and humming to himself. He found himself outside the room that Cas often spent time in and pushed the door open gently, unsurprised to find the room bare but for the sparse Men of Letters furniture. There were no clothes, no photos, no personal effects whatsoever. Nothing to show that Cas had ever been there at all.
“Yeah, seventeen of them. Garth fixed me up. Knocked me right out with some kind of laughing gas and went to town.”
Then the mound of blankets moved.
Dean ground his hips again, and gasped at the feel of Cas growing hard beneath him. Cas let out a low, unrestrained growl, his hands tightening on Dean’s hips.
In the morning, Dean woke to a frog on his pillow right next to his face.
“I’m not hungry.” Dean mumbled. Unfortunately, his stomach chose that precise moment to grumble loudly.
Dean smirks. “Oh hey. Didn’t see you there, Cas.” The nickname flows off his tongue easily.
“Oh,” is all Dean can manage for a long moment.
Cas’s frown deepened in confusion.
The Winchesters are all exhausted by the time they make it back to the bunker. Sam and Mary both stumble off to their rooms almost immediately, but Dean lingers a moment.
Back at the motel, Dean ushered Cas into a chair. He’d managed to get out of the lab coat and Dean cut away his clothes, baring him to the waist. His wings looked as though they could stretch the span of the whole room, but Cas pulled them into himself and they hung grazing the floor. Dean pulled another chair around to face him, dropped the first aid kit onto the table next to them, and began setting out the needle and thread.
“No dice?” Sam asked.
Dean wanted to say yes but he couldn’t get the word out. He just opened and closed his mouth helplessly, like an idiot. A beat passed and Cas started to withdraw his hands. Dean panicked, suddenly more scared of Cas not kissing him than he was of what would happen if he did. He grabbed Cas’s hands before he could pull them back all the way and held them in place.
Sam sighed. "I was just experimenting a little. I thought I had translated that Latin and—"
“Cas wait,” Dean urged, and pulled his boyfriend back a moment.
“Yard sale,” Sam said with a smirk. “They were practically giving it away.”
“We gotta get you a hat, Cas,” Dean says to the opposite wall as he returns his mug to the coffee maker.
“I prefer CDs,” said Cas, pointing to the long shelf of them behind Dean. Dean took a quick survey and found it filled with an array of medieval music, loads of classical shit, and some of those relaxation CDs that mimicked nature sounds. Notably absent was anything from the 20th century.
Castiel started towards his living room but paused when he realized that cat wasn’t budging from the foyer. It stayed sitting there, staring at him with wide eyes.
They drift closer as the night wears on, until they’re snuggled together in the middle of the couch. Doctor Sexy fades into the background as Dean explores the contours of Cas’s mouth with his own.
Cas’s glare was no less effective as a frog. He squinted at him, pupils narrowed, and Dean had the distinct impression he was being scolded.
“I’m fine.”
“Huh,” mused Dean. “So why live here?”
Cas isn’t sure what to do with himself when they finally arrive back at the bunker. The Winchesters all tumble out of the car, stretching long limbs and yawning. They make for the door of the bunker and Cas watches them go, wondering if perhaps he ought to leave them to their reunion in peace. Then Dean turns back to him, stony-faced.
“Hey, Cas.” Dean’s voice had changed. It had gone quiet and soft.
"Your stethoscope’s crooked," Dean admonished, and straightened it around his neck. He brushed his hands down Cas's shoulders for good measure, knocking out the wrinkles in the lab coat.
Predictably, there was no response.
. It’s the most incongruous thing he’s ever experienced, going down on his best friend like this. And god help him, he loves it. He loves the heavy feel of Dean in his mouth, the strangled, gasping sounds that Dean’s making, the way Dean’s stomach clenches and his legs squirm. He’s intoxicated by the scent of Dean all around him.
“Why didn’t you stop us?” Dean asked weakly.
-----
“Yeah.”
“Balthazar?” asked Dean. “Really?”
John cleared his throat from the other side of the table. “Maybe he was bisexual,” he grumbled. Both Bobby and Cas turned to stare at him, mouths agape.
“I know you think I hate you, Pimmy. Because I call you a stinky, overgrown, oddly shaped rat.” She blinks up at him, and he sighs. “I don’t though, okay? I couldn’t hate anything that he cares so much about. And don’t tell him I said this,” he whispers conspiratorially, “but you’re actually kind of cute.”
Cas made a careful nest of some spare blankets in the corner of his room. He fluffed a pillow and put it in the middle, and, with a final stroke of inspiration, turned on a heating pad to put underneath.
He finds Dean blinking up at him in surprise, come splattered across his bewildered face. Castiel would apologize but words — and really all higher brain function — have abandoned him entirely. Dean’s blushing furiously, freckles dancing across his nose, his eyes wide and shining. There’s a streak of white across his cheek, and another clinging to his hairline.
Dean’s at the Roadhouse when he gets the call, waiting for Cas to join him for their usual burger and beer. Typically Cas beats him here, orders for them, and has stolen the pickles from Dean’s burger by the time Dean arrives. But Dean enters the Roadhouse to find their table empty, which should have been his first sign that something was wrong.
“Shit, Cas. That’s—”
It was an odd mix, and Dean’s mind stumbled onto a terrible possibility. What if these weren’t Cas’s CDs? What if the cookbooks and the fresh food and the signs of life in the kitchen weren’t from Cas?
Dean furrowed his brow, trying to remember his social security number. He was filling out his address in Kansas when Cas returned with a bowl of hot, buttery popcorn and sank onto the couch much closer to Dean than he had been before. Not quite close enough that they were touching, but if Dean were to spread his leg out a bit, their knees would bump together. He kept his leg very still.
“I like the view.”
Sam snorted in disgust, but Cas’s heart melted just a little. It was cute, really. The cat was large, with muted tortoiseshell colouring, like it couldn’t make up its mind what colour its fur was supposed to be. It was mostly a rust colour, with blurred splotches of tawny brown and white. Its eyes were a bright, vibrant green, like there was fire behind them, and it had long, delicate whiskers. It was scowling, its tail flicking back and forth angrily, its fur was all mussed up, and its nose was dripping. But Cas was suddenly smitten with the thing, and thought it was really quite beautiful. He crouched down to pat it on the head and Sam gasped at him.
-----
Dean’s dick throbbed, swinging with every insistent thrust from Cas. He made to reach down but Cas swatted his hand away, and Dean whined. Slowly, the arm around Dean’s waist moved lower, trailing through the come and fresh pre-come that had smeared on Dean’s stomach. It inched closer, but just shy of where Dean wanted it, and he let out a loud, desperate moan. Any inhibitions he may have had vanished in a flash and Dean found himself begging.
“Alright, that’s it,” Cas announces as Dean fidgets uncomfortably. “Take off your pants.”
He jumped a little when Cas reached over and squeezed his hand. While Dean had been staring at his brother, Cas had evidently been staring at him. His emotions were swirling all over the place and so, without giving it too much thought, Dean squeezed back and was grateful for the reassuring gesture.
There was no sign of Cas when he finally emerged from the spare bedroom and Dean had learned his lesson about walking into Cas’s room unannounced. He wandered down the hall. There was no sign of Cas, but the TV was on in the living room. Some sort of cooking show was on, and Gordon Ramsay was spewing profane insults.
The sun had fully set by the time Castiel pulled onto his street and into his driveway. Cas had chattered away to the cat on the drive. Just small talk, telling her where they were going every time he made a turn. It was a little stupid, perhaps, to talk to a cat, but she did seem to calm down with Castiel’s voice, and her face looked less angry. By the time they arrived home, the cat was no longer scowling. It was sitting quietly on his passenger seat except for the occasional sneeze, just looking a little bewildered.
“God, yes,” Dean groaned. He scanned the menu, did a double take of the prices, and resolved to stick with just coffee. His wallet had been empty of any cash when he found it that morning, and he was certain there wasn’t much more than a few dollars in his account at the moment. He would just drink his coffee, sort this marriage shit out, and be on his way.
“Dean. . .” Castiel’s hands betray him again, sliding up and stroking through Dean’s hair. It’s electric to finally feel. One hand trails down Dean’s neck, coming to rest with a thumb stroking against an erratic pulse, and Dean tips forward, eyes closed— his forehead bumping gently against Castiel’s own.
In the ER, a nurse was finally able to tell him that Cas was in surgery. Dean found this concerning, as Cas had been in surgery when the hospital called over five hours ago. Surely that wasn’t a good sign.
“Dean!”
“We’ll manage.”
“There sure as hell better be.”
The next evening they’re sitting around the table researching when Dean finally pipes up.
Once back at Cas’s apartment, they both found they were too exhausted to look at the papers just then. Dean panicked for a brief moment over the sleeping arrangements as Cas walked him down the hallway, but he turned left and ushered Dean into a spare bedroom.
“I’m not mad Cas, I’m worried.” This at least he needs to make clear.
~~~~~
“You okay?” Dean asks, his back turned as he peels off his flannel shirt. His t-shirt rides up, revealing the soft dimple of his lower back.
When he offers to blow Cas instead, Cas just kisses his forehead and tells him to get some rest.
He knelt next to Dean. “Please, let me,” he mumbled. He scooped as much of the egg goop into his hands as he could manage and stood up. “I’m sorry if the alarm woke you. I… I wanted you to sleep in… I wanted to surprise you…”
“Marched right past the leggy blonde who was making sex eyes at him all night, mind you,” Sam added with a wink at Cas.
Cas is silent for a moment, then nods. "Okay. Me first, though."
“Hmm.” Dean yawns. “Well, I’m glad you’re you, Cas. Don’t know what I’d do without you.”
“Lift and flip,” Cas muttered, intensely focused.
“Mhmm,” Cas nodded between the kisses he trailed up Dean’s jawline. “Just as long as you don’t hog the bed like you did last night.”
But Cas’s touch turned suddenly tentative again. As Dean tightened his legs and tried to thrust upward, urging him on, Cas’s hands came up to frame Dean’s face and he held him still. He peered down at Dean, his expression serious.
They continue staring at one another, and Baby waits with bated breath.
They had been so certain it was a vampire. And they weren't entirely wrong, as it turned out, but in a twist that surprised everyone, they'd discovered the hard way that demons were capable of occupying a vampire as a vessel, effectively combining both powers together into a super monster with strength enough to immobilize even an angel.
“Dean?” Cas asked. “Everything okay?”
Dean stares at the shadow of Benjamin’s wings burned into the wall where he was slain. They are broken and burned looking and he realizes with a pang that Cas’s wings must be like that too. He hasn’t seem them since Metatron’s spell. The sick feeling in his gut grows worse. Cas is more fragile than he’d realized and certainly not in the the state he should be if cosmic consequences are headed their way.
They talk about how their furnace has been making funny noises, and make plans to call a few companies to get quotes for repairs that they almost certainly can’t afford.
He pushed Cas up against the wall in the hallway, leaning in to suck bruising kisses down the line of Cas’s neck. This he could do. This was familiar. The scratching sensation and burn of stubble against his lips was new, but intoxicating, and Dean savoured the salty tang of sweat on Cas’s skin, wondering what he would taste like further down. He bit gently on the flesh of Cas’s shoulder and was rewarded with a sharp inhale of breath.
“Dean?”
“Works for me,” Dean says, and Castiel stands to go. But Dean stares him down. He points to his coffee, raises a finger in warning, and Castiel sinks back into his seat in silent resignation.
“Just… you know,” he mumbled. “Hang out here more?”
“Why do you think I pick Sam up from work all the time and bring you both coffee and treats? I’m not that nice of a brother, dude. I just wanted the excuse to see you. But Jesus, Cas. You’re so fucking smart and beautiful and so far outta my league.”
He nearly lost his cool again when he took in Cas’s post-shower hair and the little trickle of water making its way down his neck.
Dean obliged, but did so reluctantly and fiddled with the cuffs. He felt like a Ken doll that Cas was dressing up and parading around. With every new suit he was forced to try on, he felt his dignity slipping slowly away. “This is ridiculous,” he said. “Why do you keep making me turn around?”
Several options later and it had become apparent that Cas was reluctant to lose the trench coat. In a stroke of inspired brilliance, Dean replaced it with a long white lab coat instead and pronounced him Doctor Sexy.
“You know,” Sam said, clearing his throat more emphatically. “There another thing that often prompts transformation in fairy tales. Ever heard of true love’s kiss?”
Dean stabbed at his sausage and they ate in silence for a few moments.
Eileen reached over to give his hand a squeeze. “I know it was a bit of a shock for you,” she said. Her tone was gentle, but her eyes were twinkling and she looked like she was trying to hold in laughter.
Dean let out a low whistle. “You are so outta his league, Eileen. Are you sure you want to go through with this?” He spoke slowly, turned to face her, and enunciated his words carefully so she could read his lips. He’d only ever talked to Eileen a couple of times before in skype calls with Sam, but he knew the drill.
“It was there, I swear,” Dean says. Had he taken it out? He’d packed some in his bag on the last hunt they were gone for and—“oh shit, I left my bag in the trunk.”
croaked back at him.
A beat passed, and then the cat lunged at Sam’s legs. “Arrrrgh!”
“You didn’t want to—that’s—that’s so stupid. I would never. I—”
Cas nodded weakly and felt his own cheeks beginning to warm.
"I can't go through it again." Cas says solemnly, and Dean sobers quickly.
“Where’s Sam?” Cas asks, looking around the darkened library.
“Yeah, fine. Thank you.” Castiel accepted the books from Dean and suppressed a shudder when their fingers brushed. He stood up and found Sam trying to reassemble the pyramid.
But the look Cas gave him was not one of pity. It was something else entirely; an odd sort of look that Dean couldn’t quite put his finger on. Almost a look of… recognition? It was not at all what Dean had been expecting, and he had to wonder: was Cas harboring some sort of dark and tragic past of his own?
me,” he said again, incredulously.
“Thanks Dean.”
“No, idiot. I told him I love
Sam and Jack leave, and then it’s just the two of them. Dean slurps his coffee loudly. A long moment of silence passes, but it’s comfortable and familiar and Castiel sinks happily into it.
“Awful. Cruel, and twisted, and broken beyond repair.”
"I wasn't a girl cat, okay?" Dean huffed. "And this is so not the point. Don't think you're getting off the hook this easily, Sammy."
“Cas.. please. Please, I need… fuck.. Cas… please, please, please.” His vision blurred, and Dean was stunned to realize that he was crying it was so fucking good.
“Hmm,” Sam mused. “Alright, it’s late. We’re not getting anywhere. Let’s turn in and get some shut eye and we’ll start research again in the morning with fresh eyes.”
Castiel pulls back and stares, transfixed, at Dean’s face. It’s flushed, and his green eyes are wide and searching. Castiel’s eyes are drawn to the place he’s been seeking: Dean’s lips, parted slightly. Dean’s tongue darts out as he licks them nervously, and Castiel surges forward, pressing their lips together.
Cas’s eyes flicked up to meet Dean’s briefly, before returning to stare at the floor.
Cas smiled shyly. “So imagine my surprise when I woke up next to you this morning.”
Cas scoffed, offended. “Don’t be ridiculous. You can stay with me as long as you need, Dean.”
“Pets aren’t presents.”
Dean’s pulling taco shells from the oven when Cas returns to the kitchen with bare feet and damp hair, and snakes his arms around Dean from behind. He nuzzles into Dean’s neck and Dean sighs at the familiar warmth of Cas pressed along his back.
Outside, the sun has come up and the rain has turned into large, wet snowflakes. It’s beautiful, but only Baby sees its splendour. Neither Dean nor Castiel pay the world outside any mind.
True to Cas’s word, the diner was only a short walk down the street. Dean’s stomach continued to grumble as they entered and were hit with the smell of bacon frying. It was a little classier than the diners he was accustomed to back in Kansas, but bacon was bacon.
"This is Meg," Cas says, drawing Dean’s attention away from the orange kitten. He smiles proudly at an ancient-looking tabby cat that limps slowly toward him. Her fur is still mangy, even though it's evident someone's been brushing and caring for her. One eye is nearly swollen shut with some kind of infection, an ear looks as though something took a bite out of it, and her tail is bent at an odd angle. She hisses at Dean like she wants to scratch his face off and leaves a wide berth around him, which suits Dean just fine.
Eileen laughed and pulled him into a hug. When she leaned back, she wiggled a finger under her chin, then pointed at Cas with a raised eyebrow.
But, much to his surprise, Dean kisses him back. As the kiss deepens and their tongues find one another, Dean lets out a low groan and chases the taste of himself, his tongue darting further into Castiel’s mouth.
Castiel hums noncommittally. His left arm has wrapped around Dean’s side and his thumb strokes ever so lightly against Dean’s arm.
“Hey! Cas!” Dean let out a nervous laugh and blushed. Beautiful, confident, larger-than-life Dean Winchester was standing naked in his kitchen and
It’s Castiel’s turn to scowl at him as he strokes the cat. “This is Meg. Isn’t she an angel?”
The summer soon draws to a close. The night before their bandages are set to come off, Castiel makes a particularly risky move. He isn’t sure what makes him do it. Maybe it’s the sounds coming from Dean, or the fact that their time at the cabin alone is coming to an end. Or maybe it’s Dean muttering Castiel’s name under his breath, his eyes open and staring. Whatever the reason, Castiel pulls away from Dean’s dick with a soft pop and watches as Dean exhales heavily. With the next breath, he makes his way up Dean’s body, pressing kisses up the length of Dean’s torso. He traces the hard lines of Dean’s body with his tongue. He shoves, just a little to one side, and Dean goes willingly, collapsing bonelessly into the couch cushions with a gasp. Castiel follows, covering Dean’s body with his own and drawing his tongue across a nipple. Dean shivers beneath him.
His thoughts are interrupted when he realizes that Mary is now staring at him.
There was a shuffling sound, and then Sam's voice was much more awake. "Dean? Why are you calling from Cas's phone?"
Cas, however, seemed altogether unenthused about the prospect, and he collapsed onto the couch with a huff.
Dean laughed. “You beat up your mugger!”
“Trippy as hell, man. I was, uh, tap dancing. In the bunker. In a white tux and dancing with a—god, with a lamp, I think?”
Dean has not always been such a deep sleeper. After Castiel pulled him from hell all those years ago, Dean hadn't slept well at all. He almost always slept fully clothed and often left his boots on as well. Castiel hadn't realized straightaway that this had been unusual behaviour. He himself didn't need sleep, and while he understood well enough that it was a human requirement, he hadn't fully appreciated all the rituals of nightfall.

“It’s ten minutes from us, and it’s up for sale,” Sam said, practically bouncing up and down. “The cheque should cover most of it, or at least a sizable down payment. I talked to the seller, and he’s agreed to hold offers for a few days to give you a chance to come see it, if you’re interested.” His words started to spill out quickly in his excitement and Eileen placed a hand on his arm to slow him down. He took a deep breath and continued. “It needs quite a bit of work, but you’re handy, and it’s on a big lot. There’s even beehives out back.”
Dean Winchester was in his kitchen frying eggs.
“So uh, I guess we found my family then,” Dean said. “But is there any chance you might still want to keep a stray like me?”
"I've been telling him the same thing," Charlie pipes up. "Job offer still stands, Cas." She points to a job posting on the bulletin board for a Fund Development Coordinator. Dean can’t make out all the details from where he’s sitting, but Cas has been talking for years about transitioning to nonprofit. He’s crazy good with numbers but Cas was never meant for corporate bottom lines.
Dean groaned. There was no way he had enough cash to stay in even a crappy little motel for much longer. “Maybe the garage will let me stay overnight and I can sleep in the backseat of the car.”
He thinks of Purgatory and the crypt and all the other times he’s put himself out there and Cas has walked away.
Dean folds his hands across his stomach and they settle into a comfortable silence as Castiel chews away at the pork rinds and Dean stares up at the ceiling.
Soon, Dean’s curses trail off into broken gasps. He shudders as he comes suddenly between them and Castiel nearly sobs at the feel of Dean’s cock pulsing and hot against his own. He aches to bury his face in the crook of Dean’s neck, but he veers to the side and sinks his face into the couch instead as he spills his own release. He bites down hard on the cushion to keep what can’t be said from spilling out as well:
“I’ve never been scared of anything before. I can mess with explosives, and jump off buildings. I can spend the night in a haunted house, or streak naked through a football field. I don’t back down, Cas. Not from anything, ever.”
“Except you’re not,” Dean insists. “You’re nothing like that.”
“Bitch.”
Dean grunts as the full and considerable weight of Cas barrels into him for a hug and he chuckles as he returns the embrace.
he wasn’t going to like this. The music had his stomach twisting in knots already.
“You little shit,” Dean laughed. He found a remote for the TV under the bird’s cage and turned it off. Balthazaar ruffled his feathers indignantly and squawked angrily at him: “
Dean’s been telling Cas for months that he should look for work elsewhere if it makes him this unhappy. He hates that Cas loses eight hours of his life every day in an office cubicle having his soul slowly leached from him. He hates that every night Cas comes home, it takes a little longer for him to relax, to shed himself of the stresses of work.
"About what?" Dean’s instantly awake.
“I’m a little foggy on the rest,” Dean admitted. Judging from Sam’s texts, he hadn’t handled it well. What Dean was still struggling to remember was how he’d managed to wind up married and in bed with a total stranger when Sam was the one who was supposed to be tying the knot.
“There’s more,” said Eileen, nodding at the envelope.
“So we just wait here then?” Castiel asks.
“There’s a washroom down the hall and to your left if you’d like to, uh, freshen up.”
Dean winked at him. “See ya then, Cas.”
“Nah, it’s fine. You’re welcome to join us Cas.” Sam said. “Besides, I guess you’re kind of family now.” He elbowed Dean in the ribs and ushered them both into the chapel.
“It suits him. He’s an eccentric sort of parrot.”
"Sure. Totally fine," Dean grunted as he helped him up to standing and held on tight, not trusting himself to let go. "Just sprouted wings and got stabbed, no big deal." Cas leaned heavily on him and Dean braced against the added weight. "Come on, let's get you out of here and patched up."
“I don’t regret what I did even if it costs me my life.”
“Fine, I’ll buy another couch,” Dean relents. “In the meantime, my bed is huge.”
Dean let his head flop back on the pillow, his cheeks aflame. He had to crane his neck again though when Cas ran a finger through the stickiness pooled on his stomach, brought it up to his own mouth and tasted, his tongue running sinfully over his fingers.
Castiel scrambled to regain his balance and made his way carefully back down the rungs. He had hired Sam on as an employee at the bookstore nearly six months ago. Sam had been eager about the job, desperate for another source of income to fund his schooling, and had a shared reverence for books that Castiel hadn’t been able to turn down. Over time, Sam had also come to be a cherished friend. Castiel’s once solitary existence was now peppered with weekly evenings spent with Sam and his friends.
– Dean leans in and presses his lips to the corner of Castiel’s mouth, his eyes fluttering shut. It’s soft and tender, and ever so brief. Dean pulls back a second later and they both stare at one another in mingled shock.
Castiel offers a small, sad smile. “You think it’s any easier for me when I lose you?”
They drink to a better way.
Dean watched the waitress walk away, hips swinging. He poked at the elaborate fruit garnish on the side of his plate. Ridiculous. No self-respecting man wanted his strawberries cut into flowers. No self-respecting man wanted fruit anywhere on a breakfast plate, for that matter. Cas, however, looked quite taken with the arrangement on his own place and started poking at it happily.
slimy, not really.
Cas felt around for his phone to call 911, and kicked himself when I realized he'd left his cell in the living room last night after his call with Gabriel. He picked up his bedside lamp, the only object in the vicinity half-resembling any sort of weapon and began to tiptoe down the hall towards the noise.
body can’t handle liquor quite as well, so he had to slow down hours ago to make sure he could stay awake until Cas got home.
“Um, I flew,” Dean said.
An hour to Kansas City. Three hours or so by plane to Vegas. Four, maybe five hours before he could be at the hospital later tonight. Five agonizing hours in which Cas might not make it through surgery. If he drove, he wouldn’t be there until nearly lunchtime tomorrow, by which time…
Castiel sighs. “I'm sorry, Charlie, that you had to experience that. The full extent of heaven's torture is nothing any human should be subject to."
And fuck yes, Dean wanted that. He wanted more, wanted everything that Cas was willing to give him. But something made him hesitate. Perhaps it was the look in Cas’s eyes; his expression was soft again, and he gazed at Dean with unchecked affection. It was unnerving, and the level of intimacy flooding between them in that moment was more than Dean could bear. If he didn’t get a handle on himself quickly, he’d be in deep trouble.
Surprisingly, Dean gives a hell of a blow job. He seems to have gotten over any shyness now, and moves his head faster, his motions deeper. Castiel experiments with a tiny thrust up into Dean’s mouth, and the resulting moan from Dean reverberates everywhere. Dean slows for a moment, taking Cas as deep as he can and holding still. Castiel would give anything in the world to have the use of his hands; he wants to touch, to feel himself pressed against the inside of Dean’s cheek, to stroke Dean’s face and run his thumb along Dean’s lips where they’re stretched to accommodate him. When Dean gags slightly Cas tries to pull back, but Dean follows him, bobbing his head eagerly, heedless of the saliva that is pooling or the wet, slick sound that he’s making.
Daytime isn’t a whole lot better for Dean.
the bird chirped.
“Cas, I—”
“Yeah, you dig it?”
Dean blinks, overwhelmed by the full force of Cas’s devotion. “Uh, yeah. Roger that.” Hoping to lighten the mood, he smirks, clicks his mouth, and fires off finger guns. “Right back atcha.”
“Oh he can understand us alright. He was giving me the stink eye the whole drive back.”
“Oh, he’s still around. Not much to tell there. Mom died a long time ago, but he’s never been the same.” John Winchester had fallen to pieces when Mary died, and never quite managed to put himself back together again. Not for lack of trying on Dean’s part though. Dean stared resolutely out the window as he spoke, so Cas wouldn’t see his face. Then he carefully schooled his features and turned back to face him, bracing himself for the inevitable look of pity that he always got.
Then there were firm hands on his shoulders, briefly, and then bright blue eyes full of concern swarming his vision. He watched the stranger’s lips moving. They were a little chapped, and very close.
Now that Cas was closer and his face was no longer in shadow, Dean could see the outline of dark bruises on his face. His lip was cut, one eye was swollen, and there was an ugly gash on his neck. Dean sucked in a breath at the sight and reached for Cas’s face without thinking. Cas flinched and leaned away before Dean could make contact, and he dropped his hand, curling it into a fist at his side.
“I know, Bobby! You don’t have to tell me.”
Dean’s fingernail grazes over his slit and Cas jolts upward. Unfortunately it’s the precise moment that Dean has chosen to lean down and their heads bump together with a dull thump. Cas is mortified, but Dean bursts out laughing and then kisses him hard. He pulls back to examine the spot where they collided.
She purrs contentedly, her engine coming back to life.
-----
Dean tried to keep the hurt out of his voice, tried not to sound like a small, petulant child when he asked, “Why have you never shown them to me before?”
“Shit!” he said, a little louder this time.
-----
For now, he perches on the edge of the map table next to Dean, who has sprawled out in the languid way he does when he's relaxed and comfortable, feet propped up. He's chatting easily with Charlie and Castiel can't help but smile. Although it's not
“What do you think?” He grinned down at the cat who was staring at the makeshift bed with apprehension. “Go on, try it.” He nudged the cat, but she dug her claws into the carpet and wouldn’t budge. “Oh, for heaven’s sake.” Cas leaned down to pick the cat up, but as he tried to set her down into the blankets, her forepaws clung around his neck and dug into his t-shirt.
Sam and Eileen exchanged rings, a minister said some brief words, and they kissed as husband and wife. Then they all congregated back in the bar for celebratory drinks. Cas eyed his warily and asked the waitress for a glass of water.
“Sweetheart?” Dean scoffs. “That thing? Really?”
Dean’s eyes snapped back up and he nodded.
All at once he realizes that this will never be enough and it will never be a one time thing. For as long as Dean will have him, Cas will want this, will want Dean.
“Well I’m not gonna argue that,” said Sam.
Dean regretted it instantly, because Cas stopped whatever magic he’d been doing with his fingers and looked up at Dean. His blue eyes were huge and earnest, his voice impossibly soft when he spoke next.
She was looking up at him with expectant eyes. The tuna was untouched.
He was dimly aware of a shout and a bone deep groan from somewhere behind him before he collapsed face-down in a heap, his own stickiness smearing beneath him. Cas landed warm and heavy on top of him, but managed to roll them both to one side slightly so that he was curled tightly around Dean’s back. He could feel Cas’s stubble between his shoulder blades as his face burrowed in and his gasping breath fell hot and heavy on his skin.
"Hey there, Indy. I see you've got a whip too." She winked, and Dean realized with a jolt how very young she looked. "Know how to use yours?"
“Please?” Cas adds.
Dean looks around and meets the eye of the redhead at the desk who’s eying him curiously. He winks at her. “You don’t mind, do you, sweetheart?”
“They’re really good drawings, Cas,” he muttered down at the bowl as he made his way back to the library. “You’re uh… you’re really talented.”
“It’s one of the strongest muscles in the human body,” he explains to Dean who stares at him with a strange expression as Cas stretches his tongue out and uses the tip to press down on the buttons.
This was what he needed, Dean reasoned. A good, hard, fast fuck and he’d be able to put this guy out of his mind and go on with his life. A quick, no-strings-attached night of fun, and Dean would be able to stop fantasizing about what it would be like, would be able to sleep at night without dreaming about blue eyes and all the different things those sinful lips could do.
The waitress returned with their coffees and Cas placed their order. Dean reluctantly agreed to the Sunrise Special as well, and privately looked forward to it as his stomach continued to grumble. He stared as Cas measured a careful spoonful of honey and stirred it gently into his mug. He raised his eyebrows in question.
- Description (though not in extreme detail) of severe injuries that have the doctors and Dean wondering if Cas will make it
“It’s a lift and flip motion, real quick.” Dean demonstrated the movement in the air a few times, moving Cas’s hand with his so he’d get a feel for it.
Sam wrinkled his nose. "That's disgusting. I—hey there, girl!" A dog had bounded over to Sam's feet and was now staring up at him expectantly, tail wagging. He knelt down to pet her.
-----
“Nah, it’s fine,” Dean says, and slides to the floor. He nudges at Castiel to take his place on the sofa. “Really, man. It’s weird if I don’t. We’re supposed to be helping each other out, right?”
Happy 40th Dean. You deserve all the happiness you can find.
“You really care about him, don’t you?” Cas asked when Dean hung up the phone, a little misty eyed.
he thought. The ring had been his mother’s before she died and he’d gone and lost it in the throes of a one-night stand he was too hungover to even remember. The shame that had been roiling low in his gut only intensified, and he took a deep breath so as not to start retching again.
-----
“Dean...” Cas said.
Castiel arrived at Sam and Dean’s place the night before Halloween with no small amount of trepidation. As much as Castiel liked Halloween, he really wasn’t fond of horror movies. He’d never quite had the constitution for it, and he was already beginning to regret his decision to come tonight. He could be at home with a cup of tea and a good book. Why was he even here? Chances were good he wouldn’t make it through the night and would just make a fool of himself. He should have skipped this evening, and come back next week for regular games night. Everyone would have understood if he’d just said he was tired.
Cas grunts and squirms out of Dean’s hold, and Dean’s immediate relief is replaced with fury when the paramedic trying to give Cas oxygen announces with no small amount of irritation that Cas had been one of the last to evacuate, having stayed behind to help trapped animals out of the building.
Dean snorted into his own coffee. As he looked down, his eye caught on the flash of silver in Cas’s hand. He was still wearing the ring. Cas followed Dean’s gaze and jolted in surprise.
Dean could feel himself blushing. “Well fine, then we can say we were drunk. They can annul it if we weren’t in our right minds, surely.”
“Jesus, Cas!” Dean swore and nearly fell out of bed. “Not any less creepy when you’re an amphibian.”
“It’s on the flight patterns of migratory birds.” Cas gestured at the documentary that was playing and clutched a pillow to his lap. “I thought I’d just… tune in for a bit before I go to bed.” His face was bright red.
-----
He’s indignant when Cas tells them to wait outside at the diner because Ishim doesn’t like humans, but Cas cuts him off.
“Well they can’t exactly start without us now, can they?” He pressed Cas up against the wall and leaned in to kiss him. He began to snake his hands up into that beautiful, dark head of hair when Cas grabbed both his hands firmly and stopped him with a serious look.
“Excuse me?” In a heartbeat, Cas has gone from quiet and sullen to outright pissy and, if Dean’s not mistaken, there’s a flash of anger in those blue eyes.  “It was fucking stupid and you know it. I don’t know what happens now, what the consequence for you are gonna be, but whatever it is it wasn’t worth it.”
Dean just stared dumbly at where Cas’s fingers had brushed his. Cas was
He sighed, and made his way up to bed. After spending the weekend in Cas’s bright, shiny penthouse, everything Dean looked at now seemed like shit in comparison. Their home was small and dirty and dark and dank. But, it was home, Dean thought. This is where he was meant to be.
The omelette slipped a little, but all in all it turned out okay. Cas looked up over his shoulder at Dean and beamed. “It worked!”
The plane ride was terrible. It reaffirmed every worst fear Dean had about flying. The seats were small, the booze was weak, the air was stuffy, and every bump of turbulence had Dean cursing under his breath and trying to bargain for his life with a God he didn’t believe in.
“I’m not!”
“It’s… pleasant,” Cas said carefully.
“I’m locked out by the warding,” he offers. “I could use the company.”
Dean's face glows in the light of the small flame and his freckles are cast into sharp relief. When he looks up and grins, his green eyes blaze with a certain maniacal glint that Castiel is all too familiar with. He should stop this, he really should. But Dean has already lit the fuse on the firework he holds, and he's pressing his lighter to the base of the one in Castiel's hands too.
She huffed and wriggled out of Dean’s hold. Her eyes flashed in anger, but all Dean could think was that they weren’t the right shade of blue.
Cas frowns. “Dean, I’m serious. You really shouldn’t be here with your allergies.”
Castiel winced and moved the phone back from his ear. His brother Gabriel continued to shout in his ear over loud background music that Castiel could hear thumping.
Cas concedes and walks him back until his knees hit the edge of his bed. He sinks down, and pulls Cas down to meet him. Bared to one another, Cas settles into the space between his legs and presses soft nips to the inside of his knees.
Cas says, very quietly, “You’ve never been ordinary to me.”
“Or to nerds such as yourself.”
“How was the hunt?” Sam asked. His nose was buried in a book and he didn’t look up when Dean trudged into the bunker library.
Meg inched forward and crouched down on the floor next to him. “It looks like an overgrown rat.”
“Doubtful. You’re already pretty fucking perfect.”
They did not have thirty seconds. And they did go out with a bang. That much, at least, Castiel can remember.
Dean tensed at the sudden, telltale rush of grace; relaxed when he found himself clean and dry instead. Strong arms wrapped around shaking limbs and Dean went boneless with exhaustion.
who you are. And it has nothing to do with your lockpicking skills. Or your performance in bed, or the way lube magically appears in your bedside table, or how your ass always tastes like caramel.”
Hope sparkles in Cas’s eyes, but his voice is steady and even when he speaks. “What are you saying?”
“Of course Dean. Sleep well.”
When Cas finally
Dean swore at Sam, and Sam swore back. As things grew increasingly heated between the brothers, a growing realization settled over Castiel. He cleared his throat, and both brothers fell silent.
“Blasphemous.” Dean felt the upward turn of Cas’s mouth as he smiled into the next kiss. “Obstinate.” Three more kisses trailed down his throat. “Mine.”
Cas turned in his resignation to accept the job at the shelter, and Dean has never seen him happier. Their renovations are on hold, their Christmas “tree” is wobbling dangerously to one side, and they’ve agreed not to exchange gifts this year. But seeing Cas like this is the best gift Dean could have ever hoped to receive.
He looked around the living room while he waited. The Vegas skyline was a beautiful as always and Dean stared out at the lights for several long moments until the height made him dizzy and he moved back into the center of the room.
“I do.”
Cas deflates, his shoulder slumping. “I knew you’d want me to apply.”
“He lured me here,” Dean grumbled. “He lured me here for a goddamn wedding. And hell, isn’t he supposed to ask my permission first or something? Shouldn’t he have told me before now? How did he expect I’d react to that?!”
Cas’s eyes narrowed to slits and he did not let go of the frying pan.
“Oh, I know!” Dean said, suddenly remembering the spider that had taken up residence on one of the kitchen shelves that Cas has absolutely forbade him to kill. Sometimes, Dean caught him talking to it when he didn’t think Dean could hear him.
Dean shivered at the bold intensity of Cas’s words and the truth he knew they contained. But he quickly suppressed it, snorted instead. “I’m not some delicate flower here, Cas. You’re not going to break me.”
Dean’s jaw dropped. “What?”
It’s fine, really. No big deal. Just two friends sharing a bed. Eventually Cas curls towards the wall on his side of the mattress and is courteous about not pulling the blankets with him. Dean lays on his back, staring aimlessly up at the ceiling and listening to Cas’s breathing even out. The cadence of it is soothing, and he closes his eyes and lays perfectly still. But apparently not still enough, because after awhile Cas huffs, still facing the wall.
Again though, Cas had different plans.
“I like driving alright?” snapped Dean. Cas was looking at him with a soft expression again and Dean rolled his eyes.
“Come visit us in California when you can,” Eileen said, signing.
Sam’s wedding was a tasteful affair.  Nothing, apparently, like the debacle Dean had participated in the previous night.
They go back to alternating blow jobs on the couch, but with some of the awkwardness now behind them. Dean certainly seems more relaxed. By contrast, Castiel’s anxiety has only grown with each passing day because he’s not sure what to make of Dean’s flippancy. Whenever they finish, Dean chuckles and cleans himself off and they carry on— like they haven’t just swapped frenzied blow jobs and made each other come hard enough to see stars.
“You can sign?” asked Dean, incredulous.
Cas plunks himself down by the Christmas tree set up in the corner of the rescue and several small kittens immediately jump in his lap. Dean sits next to him, shoulders brushing, and waves softly at the little orange kitten that goes catapulting off Cas's knee and whizzing by them.
“Hmm?”
Halloween had always been Castiel’s favourite time of the year. He loved watching the leaves turn colour and crunch underfoot. The crisp air that carried the smell of winter always made him want to curl up with a cup of tea and a good book. And he loved the theatrics of Halloween: the skeletons and ghosts that hung from porches, carved pumpkins alight with candles. It was all so magical.
Dean fell asleep to the softness of wings all around him and the warmth of Cas's breath on the back of his neck.
- Very brief (just a single line) mention of depression and possible suicide.
Cas smirked. “You seem to be more muscular than I am through the shoulders.” Cas licked his lips and his gaze ran lasciviously up Dean’s body.
He let go, and peered over Cas’s shoulder as he made to flip the first omelette. They were so close that Dean could have rested his chin on Cas’s shoulder, could have wound his arms around his waist. He cleared his throat and carefully angled his hips away.
"It was supposed to help!" Sam insisted. "It was a brew to help with allergies."
"Serious," Dean agreed. "Of course, yeah. Come on, Cas. Let's find you a costume to wear."
And, because books didn’t always sell like they should, he also sold various oddities that gave his store the air of an old-time apothecary: amulets, herbal remedies, natural bath products, quills, pretend hex bags. They were all trinkets, but with the atmosphere he created, he had cultivated a small following of admirers, and people often travelled from surrounding areas to visit his store.
Cas sighs and settles back into the pillows.
“I love you,” he whispered into the space between them.
“God, don’t be!” cried Dean. “I’m so fucking glad you did.”
It all came crashing to a halt three days later when his phone rang at work, late one afternoon. The screen lit up with Cas’s name.
“I’m telling you, Sam, that’s all I know,” Dean sighed an hour later as they pored over still more books.
—would change. They’d probably stop hanging out at the Roadhouse and start doing couples things. And Dean would inevitably fuck it up, because he doesn’t know how to
Sam plucked Cas out of the bowl between his thumb and forefinger, nose wrinkling, and set him carefully down on the sigil he’d drawn. He then cleared his throat and read the spell aloud.
“Hey Dad,” said Dean. “Thanks for coming.”
Dean beamed.
why you were showering as soon as you got home.”
He kisses him back.
“I love you, Dean. I’ve loved you for a long time. I’m going to continue loving you in whatever way you’ll have me, for as long as you’ll let me. I would be both humbled and honored if you choose to give this thing between us a try. But if you don’t— if you truly want to remain as ‘just friends,’ then that’s fine too. Honestly.”
Cas is the guy who was once so guilt-ridden that he sent his old insurance company an apology gift basket after Dean made him switch to one with cheaper premiums. He’s the guy who keeps tuna cans in his car for stray cats, and is so averse to conflict that he drives three towns over to see the same dentist he’s seen for years because he doesn’t want to switch to one closer. He’s the guy who won’t ever let Dean kill a spider and insists instead on scooping them up, talking softly to them, and setting them carefully outside. There’s a goddamn centipede living in a jar in their kitchen window right now, because Cas said it was too cold to put it outside in the December snowstorm. Dean was ready to stomp on it, but Cas— well, Cas felt
But the cat was deeply interested in Cas’s bowl now, and tried to jump up on the couch. Tried, because her lower half didn’t quite make it, and she hung suspended for a moment, back legs flailing below her. Cas gave her a gentle tug, and she heaved herself up onto the couch next to him, sitting down with another sneeze.
He fingered the keys to Cas’s apartment, turning them over in his hand. There was a brass keychain in the shape of a bee hanging off them and small photo of his parrot. Oh god, the bird! Cas was so devoted to that bag of feathers, he’d be devastated if anything happened to it. Dean tried to calculate how long Cas had been gone and the bird left alone, but he couldn’t be certain without knowing when the accident happened, and his thoughts kept circling back to Cas lying cold and alone on concrete.
Sam rolled his eyes. “But then there was the woman who dropped dead while eating an apple and the model who pricked her finger doing needlepoint and fell into a coma.”
“I’m afraid not.”
He managed to keep sending money each week to Sam, who complained every time that he didn’t need to. It's what Dean had always done though, and he didn’t see why he should stop now. Sam had years of expensive schooling left, and now a wife to take care of as well. To stop entirely would mean that his brother had no more need for him whatsoever, and Dean just couldn’t bear the thought of that.
The cat’s bravado seemed to deflate a little as Cas scooped her up in his arms. She shivered against his chest, and he curled his arms around her protectively.
“Coffee to start, boys?” She asked, as she laid menus in front of them.
“I don’t know,” Cas scowled. “I can’t say I’ve ever been in the position of having to annul a drunken marriage before.” His tone wasn’t overly harsh, but Dean flinched all the same. Cas took a deep breath and his face relaxed. He gave Dean an apologetic sort of smile that Dean found a bit bewildering. “Your brother. You said he can help us?”
“No, it was a wasted trip,” Cas confirms. “I got your messages. So you’re… ‘normal’ now?”
“Ah, naked?”
Sam snorted loudly. Eileen turned to him and Sam made a few rapid hand gestures that Dean recognized as finger spelling. She turned back to look at Cas, then at Dean, and her eyes twinkled mischievously.
“Well, alright then. I guess you really are coming home with me.” Cas closed the door and walked around to the driver’s side.
remember?”
Cas looked up and frowned at Dean’s untouched plate. “What, does it surprise you that I’m gay? We did wake up in bed together.”
It's all too familiar, and Castiel lets out a sigh of relief at the tangible proof that Dean is alive.
Sam stood up and went to the sliding glass doors that looked out to the backyard, now obscured by darkness. “What the—”
“Mr. Winchester?”
“Well, answer it,” he said.
“Sam called me a coward,” Dean says, as he steps over the threshold. “Dared me to man up and do something, and honestly Cas, he was right. I’m a goddamn coward.”
Dean shook his head and continued. “I don’t know what happened. I was in a parking lot, just sitting in my car. I drank this weird, nasty stuff that Sam gave me to help with my allergies, and then the next thing I knew, I was a cat. Luckily my window was open, so I was able to squirm out and get home.”
Cas stared. He lowered the frying pan, but still held it in a death grip in front of him with both hands.
A few moments passed, and when Castiel didn’t start the car, the cat turned to return his stare, her tail twitching.
“Fuck off. You need to recharge before you go using your mojo again.” Dean gestures angrily to a bandaged wound on Castiel’s shoulder.
In the end, he decides the not knowing will kill him more than the pain of seeing, and he’s slamming the car door more forcefully than he’d intended and stalking towards the motel entrance, oblivious to the cold December air, past the other parked cars and the storefronts and the—
Castiel looks around in bewilderment and Dean can’t contain his grin.
Cas looked at him with squinted eyes, considering. Dean felt a bit like he was being sized up. Finally, Cas sighed, and spoke.
"Right, yeah," Dean mumbled through a mouthful of cocktail wieners. "Check these out, they made them look like fingers." He held one up to dangle in front of Sam's face.
Their furnace is turned down to save on the gas bill, but snuggled together they barely notice. The weird noise has stopped, too. Evidently the only thing wrong was that it needed a new filter.
Finally, Cas inched forward, slow and careful, until he was fully seated. Then he stilled again, stroking Dean’s hips. The slight burning sensation gave way to a feeling of incredible fullness. Cas leaned to drape himself over Dean’s back and the change in position had Dean seeing stars. He moaned uncontrollably into the pillow and Cas stroked his hair, kissing down the back of his neck.
The next morning Dean wakes with a start to find the bed empty. He shuffles sleepily into his living room, lured by the smell of coffee, and stops short at the scene before him.
Then he pulled his hand back and stood up abruptly. “So what do you say? You want some breakfast?”
Dean remembered now. Sam had wanted to meet him in Vegas; this much he knew. Dean had driven all the way from Kansas, excited to see his little brother who has been studying pre-law at Stanford. But he had been surprised when he got there to see that Sam had not come alone.
Instantly, the force that had been holding Dean pinned to the wall receded, and he slumped to the ground. Cas crumpled to the floor next to him with a grunt
“Dean, may I touch you?” the voice was asking.
Dean redoubled his efforts on the engine.
As his mind swirled with terrible scenarios, a horrible new thought occurred to Dean. Cas had been hit by a car– what if it hadn’t been an accident?
Dean hung his head in shame. “I’m sorry…"
It was not like any music Dean had ever heard. In fact, he was loathe to call it music at all. It was just a single, low-pitched voice making… noise.
"Because it's Halloween. That's just the rules for a college Halloween party, trust me." He held up a pair of fluffy, sparkly wings and snickered when Cas scowled at him. "Don't want to go as an angel, huh?"
"Please don't make me wear that again."
The pause timed out on the movie then, and the television came on. It was tuned to a documentary channel and the droning voice of a British narrator bellowed through the speakers making them both jump. Cas scrambled to turn the volume down and Dean scrambled to his feet, shuffling to adjust himself so his hard-on wasn’t visible.
Dean sighed. “We should probably take a look at those annulment papers, eh?”
“Dean?” Cas’s voice came out squeaky and high pitched, and he quickly cleared his throat.
“It’s faster,” Sam admitted. “If you can get it, that would be ideal, but I’m not sure if it would apply in this case. There would need to have been a lack of consent...or if one of you had already been married that would be an easy out.”
“Focus,” Dean hissed.
“I didn’t realize it was a mortal sin,” he mutters. “Angels bumpin’ uglies with us mud monkeys.”
“Hurry up,” Dean growled. He jolted when Cas bit down on his ass, then laved tender kisses over the spot.
Castiel feels pretty fortunate, all things considered. They've made it back through the portal in one piece and managed to save dozens of other souls in the process. Lucifer remains trapped on the other side. The loss of Gabriel weighs heavy on him, but he sets his grief aside for now. He doesn't forget about it exactly, just tucks it away inside of himself, not ready yet to examine it.
“Mhmm,” Dean mutters.
"The other Castiel," Charlie explains. "From our world."
Any retort Dean had been about to say dies on his lips and he is left staring slack jawed at Cas’s back as he walks away towards the diner, trench coat flapping behind him.
Dean felt that their father’s absence from the whole thing was glaring, but decided not to verbalize that particular train of thought with Sam either.
“I’m a freelancer,” he said. “I don’t have an office to go to, and there’s not often a lot of reason to leave the apartment.”
“I’m sorry…”
They sat in silence.
But when the doors opened and a harried looking doctor emerged, Dean took it all back, and wished the moment between not knowing and knowing could go on indefinitely, because she did not look like she was coming with good news.
“Why, Dean Winchester, are you asking me to be your date?”
“I was just going through my phone trying to figure out what happened last night and there are, um, photos. And videos.” He held his phone up for Dean and hit play. Dean heard the sound of his own low moans coming through the speakers and he froze. Peering closer at the video, he saw himself on his knees. The video was shot from above, looking down on him. The Dean in the video had his mouth firmly wrapped around a sizable cock, head bobbing slowly up and down, eyelids fluttering. He pulled off with a soft pop, a low moan, and started licking around the head.

Cas took one last look at his face, nodded solemnly, then began to slide lower down Dean’s body, pressing wet kisses all the way down. He took Dean’s leaking cock in his hand, making a fist, and moving slowly but firmly up and down the shaft, making Dean sigh loudly in relief. Cas leaned down to tongue at the slit, then around the underside of the head. Dean squirmed, and Cas dropped his hands to hold Dean’s hips firmly in place.
“Right. So that’s a no. What else ya got?”
Ignoring the reproachful glare from Cas, Dean made a clean sweep of the spider web and deposited both it and the spider into the bowl.
Sam chuckled. “You can have our honeymoon suite after tomorrow night if you want,” he offered, “but you’ll have to pay for the extra nights yourself.”
Cas considered this. “I really don’t think that applies in our case, Dean.”
"Yeah," Charlie says. "It's just… he looks exactly like him. It's creepy. No offense, dude."
He kisses the freckles on Dean’s nose and cheek and just above his lips. He kisses along his jaw and down the column of his throat. He tastes at the space behind his ear and then continues lower. He latches onto a nipple and Dean groans, stoking the fire that’s growing in Cas’s belly.
And then Cas started moving. Slow and gentle still, but the sensation was unspeakably intense. Cas whispered softly into his ear, little murmurs that Dean couldn’t make out, but that sounded suspiciously affectionate. Frowning, he pushed back to meet Cas’s thrusts, urging him to pick up the pace and fuck him harder. He was rewarded with a loud groan from Cas, whose rhythm stuttered for a moment.
“Well that’s just great,” Dean said. “Where are we going to find a princess?”
“Dude!” Dean’s eyes flicker open and he glares up at Castiel. “Eyes closed!”
“I do.”
It was supposed to be an easy hunt, Dean thought idly, as he flew through the air and smacked heavily against the wall. He groaned as his head slammed into drywall and his vision blurred.
“That was you.” Castiel repeated, and squinted at Dean in disbelief. He tilted his head to one side, considering. The eyes were certainly the same shade of green. He frowned, then gasped as the previous night started coming back to him. “You slept in my bed!”
“Don’t.” Cas laughed bitterly, and tucked the papers away. He cleared his throat and spoke again a little softer. “You don’t have to leave on my account. You can stay in the spare room again, and I’ll submit these first thing tomorrow morning.”
The sight took Dean’s breath away. Cas looked completely debauched; his eyes hooded, cheeks flushed, lips wet and swollen. Dean lay panting, and realized that he probably looked much the same.
"Keep an eye out for any suspicious activity," Sam reminded them as they made their way through the throng of party goers.
Dean coughed, and did as the voice said. He breathed. In and out, and within moments, his vision had cleared and his breathing became easier. He gulped in a deep breath of air.
“Mr. Novak was involved in a hit and run accident. He came to us badly injured. We’re not sure how long he’d been there in the road before someone found him.”
It’s not that Castiel dislikes Mary. In fact, he finds her quite fascinating. Endearing, even. But at the moment, he’s certain her presence will not speed things along. Dean is evidently of the same mind. He’s headed toward the house with Mary in toe when he turns around in exasperation.
He’s been so busy he hasn’t even had the chance to get to know the neighbours yet.
“I didn’t do anything, she just stopped!” He shoots Castiel an angry look and runs a soothing hand over her dash. “What’s wrong Baby, hmm?”
“You’ll always be worth it, Dean.”
Dean kisses him, soft and slow and sweet, and Cas is overwhelmed. Dean pulls back a moment later, anxiously searching Cas’s face.
And Dean had been there in high school when Castiel came out as gay. Castiel had been both relieved to rid himself of such a secret and terrified of how Dean might react. He needn’t have worried though, and their friendship never faltered.
“You own them and you’ve never watched them?” Dean asked.
Dean shuddered helplessly through another grace fuelled orgasm and swallowed a strangled, delirious whimper. He’d lost count now. Behind him, Cas stiffened and groaned into his shoulder.
