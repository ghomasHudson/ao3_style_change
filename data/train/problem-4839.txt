Which, that was odd, Steve thought.  Because just a few nights ago, the team had the rare night off with everyone in the Tower and ended up in a four-hour long card game that ended on a Draw Four card under Mjolnir and a lot of suggestions about who was being small and petty now coming from Iron Man, who had obviously heard about Thor’s comment back on the helicarrier from his boss.  How much did Iron Man share with Tony?  Enough that Tony could live vicariously through his bodyguard?  That…wow, Steve thought, suddenly troubled.  They’d invited Tony, at least sometimes.  Early on, anyway.  Team dinners and the like, though Iron Man always said Tony was busy or had some other engagement.  Some excuse that sounded plausible enough at the time that none of them had questioned it, but now, Steve wondered if maybe Tony just hadn’t felt welcome.  More an interloper than a real part of the team, and Steve could admit that he hadn’t exactly gone out of his way to convince Tony of the opposite, had he?
“I…may have tried, ah, demonstrating my, um…feelings.  Which did not go well, so…yeah,” Tony replied, rolling his bottom lip between his teeth.
She would tell him she understood how hard this was for him.  That was the next line. He would say that being back in the field was helping.  She would nod, tell him that was good, that he was getting back into the world.  She would send the form to Fury.  He would get his next mission.  Maybe next week, some of that would even be true.
Steve shifted them around just enough so that his truly unfairly broad shoulders blocked Tony’s angle to their avid audience, his other hand winding its way up to cover one of Tony’s.  To the rest of the world, it had all the markings of an embrace, two lovers holding each other on a night out, even if it wasn’t anything close to that, even if this, too, was a lie, like everything else, just something Tony could use, because that’s what he did, he used people, used them until there was nothing left.
“Buck, I’m going to leave this in the coffee can, okay?” Steve said, walking back into the room with a handful stuffed with bills.  “I made a list for groceries, if you want to pick some up.  And I wrote down  your medicines and appointments.  If you miss another PT, they’re gonna take you off the schedule, so…”
This was a terrible idea. If Rhodey were here, he would have told Tony that this was a terrible idea, and then gone along with it, but Rhodey had taken his Jiminy Cricket roadshow back to DC for a couple of days, having made Tony promise not to do exactly what Tony was doing. He was pretty sure there had been a list. Going back over to Steve's was right under sleeping with Steve on the not-to-do list, he was fairly certain. At least he hadn't worked his way to the top yet, though the night was young, he thought with a long, semi-exaperated sigh.
“You hear that because you suck that thing he calls a cock and moan like a sword swallower,” Nyma said with an impish grin.  “She is baiting you, Raj’Inama.  A little worm to catch a bigger fish.”
Steve felt he should probably voice some sort of objection when his Alpha threw the other man across the room, but found he could only muster a vague appreciation of the trajectory.   Poor form on the landing, though, Steve thought with a sympathetic wince.
“What do you think?” she replied, raising a perfectly arched eyebrow at him.  “Howard saw dollar signs.  Connections he couldn’t dream of making on his own, despite his delusions of grandeur,” she said with a grimace.
“You could always tell the good stuff,” Steve replied, voice a rough whisper.  He lifted bright eyes to Tony, heart-wrenchingly blue and wide, and Tony felt his whole body seize with something that felt a lot like desperation.  “You’re going to get them, though.  Stane, Pierce, whoever else was responsible for that.  This whole thing you’re doing…I can’t tell you what that means to me, Tony.  To know the people responsible for putting those weapons in hands that would use them against us, who didn’t care about anything except themselves, all those people who looked the other way while we were dying, to know that you’re going to see them brought to some kind of justice for it…I never thought I’d get that.  Thank you, Tony.  I mean it.  What you’re doing, it’s really something, you know?  It really is.”
“Relax for me, baby,” Tony soothed. “You’re so tense.”  Steve almost apologized, but caught himself.
Anto reached down and picked up his sack.  He pulled out the spear-thrower and nocked one of the small, sharp-tipped spears.  He stepped around Steve, ducking the hand that shot out to stop him, and pointed it at Tyber.
“Love you, too. So much,” Tony whispered against the top of Steve’s head, voice breaking. His eyes were stinging and his chest felt like it was wrapped in a vice. How do you hold the world in your hands, Tony wondered. He hadn’t realized he’d spoken out loud until Steve lifted his head to look up at Tony, eyes soft and almost pained.
It took a few beats. Tony had actually twisted the doorknob in his hand and felt the latch release before it hit him. His mind was still busily castigating himself for even letting himself think, want, hope, whatever, mocking him with a steady drumbeat of
“Nonsense. Everyone likes me,” Danen replied, lifting his chin and giving Steve a haughty look.  “I get a mark on my skin for everyone I entertain, didn’t you know?” he quipped, freckled face spreading into a wide grin.  “Perhaps Zola will add yours to his collection?  And we will see what keeps the King’s attention so well, eh?”
Steve once told him about waiting in a bunker for the shelling to start.  Forty-six hours.  Sitting there, waiting.  Knowing it was coming, but not when or how bad it would be.  Able to hear the whine of shells as they cut through the air overhead, the explosions rattling around them as they huddled there, pinned down by a heavily armored German line while they waited for reinforcements.  Not being able to do anything to stop it, just having to wait.  Playing (backgammon) cards they made out of the wrappers from their rations to try to pass the time.  How he got to the point of wishing the shells would hit them, even knowing what that meant for everyone in the bunker who wasn’t Steve.  Just to get it over with.  How much self-loathing came with that wish, even as he hadn’t been able to shake it.
Steve held the piece up and stared at it for a moment, before putting it back down next to the robe.  Not nearly as dainty or filigreed as some of the other pieces at his disposal, this one had a structural quality to it that reminded him of Tony for some reason, and he wondered if Tony had any input into the design or had simply chosen something he liked.  The King sent it.  Special for you, Steve mentally repeated.  Either way, it was something Tony wanted to see him in, and that thought alone was enough to make a flare of heat burst low in his belly, though he pushed it aside as best he could.
He woke, blinking, rubbing at the haze in his eyes.  The first thing he noticed was that he was naked and in a bed that was not his own. The bedding was softer than anything he knew, and a deep red in color.  The room was different, too.  Familiar, almost like something he dreamt, once.  Stuffed to the ceiling with books and all manner of oddities.  His shield, sword and armor were leaning against one wall, Steve saw, cleaned and oiled now. Waiting.
He shook his head, frowning at the stray thought.  Why was he thinking of that all of a sudden, when he never thought of that night, not even when his mother pressed for answers in the days after, when his father didn’t come home and Steve secretly prayed it would stay that way?   It was just a derelict old castle. Malevolent as it may look, it was likely little more than an abandoned ruin that no one remembered except in stories told in the dark to frighten children into obedience to their parents and the good book.
“Really,” Steve assured him.  “Asked for you specifically.  Said you are…far more helpful than I am.”
“You like that, eh?” Tony surmised.  “Well, you’re gonna love this.”  Tony crooked his fingers, hooking them up and pressing further into Steve’s body, feeling Steve’s inner walls firm and then relax, until he found the tight bundle of nerves and stroked against it with the tips of his fingers.
“Sure, Cap.  Like I said, every Avenger gets one,” Tony announced.  Though, every Avenger did not get one chosen to have a view of Brooklyn and offer good morning light in a space that could easily double as a studio.
“I go to meetings down at the VA center sometimes,” Steve told him.  “Nothing regular, but I try to. When we can.  There’s a counselor there. Sam.  Well, he’s a peer specialist, they call them.  Helps other veterans find services, that kind of thing. I’ve—I talked to him, some. He lets me bring Bucky when I can get him to go, even though, technically, the meetings are VA-sponsored.  I did a lot of research on the internet, trying to find some things to help Bucky that we could do, just to, you know, help him cope.”
He cleared his throat and shot an annoyed glare at Tony before continuing. “So, as I was saying, I hope you will all be able to offer some assistance to the Captain.   And no, Stark, quit bouncing in your seat.  I’m not going to “go over the rules for being around Steve” with the Avengers, and no, “Stay away from him, that means you, Barton,” is not rule number one.  And I’m pretty sure rule number four is illegal.”
Someone brought him dinner on a silver tray with the different options separated by raised lines.  He ate because his body needed it. The quiet had a different quality when you were eating alone than when you were just alone, Steve thought to himself as he chewed. The television was on, though muted, and a scrolling bar of news ran along the bottom telling him about gas attacks, a celebrity divorce, a shooting, and a big bank being fined for something Steve didn’t understand, though he remembered his mom asking for a loan one time while he sat stiffly in the chair beside her in a too-big suit jacket and shoes stuffed with newspapers, trying desperately not to start coughing.  He’d pinched his cheeks before they went in to get rid of the pallor, but by the look the bank officer gave him, it didn’t exactly give him the bloom of health. He couldn’t remember what the man looked like. It was odd, those old memories that were hazy and flawed, but easier to look at sometimes, softer and muted as they were.
“Got called to come to the principal’s office,” Tony admitted quietly after a beat of stillness.  “Ross wants to talk.”
“Twenty-five,” Steve responded, sounding a bit like he was answering his drill sergeant.  Tony watched him put the slice of pizza he’d been holding down on the plate and duck his hands under the table.  Rubbing his legs or twisting his hands together or some other nervous gesture, all over a simple question.  Maybe he thought he was too old for Tony.  Or too young.  Who the hell knew?
“Yeah, well, technically, I’m not doing anything except footing the bill,” Tony pointed out.  “Except Matt said he’d do it pro bono because he likes you more than me or loves America or something, I don’t know.  Just take the damn lawyer, Steve, God, you’re killing me here.”
“Do you have to ask?” Tony smirked, before launching into a discourse about his workshop and robots he’d named and seemed to constantly be on the verge of donating to a city college, though Steve could see the obvious fondness when he talked about them.
“I used some new cleaner on the urinals.  Seemed to do a good job,” Steve said drolly.  “Diluted bleach is still best, but this got the job done.”
“I’ll just—“ Tony pointed behind him.  He darted a quick glance to Steve, who gave him a nod, and turned to rush back into the garage.
Steve felt the hairs on the back of his neck bristle, but said nothing. Stane set the goblet down and tossed the ledger aside, standing up.  He was of a height with Steve, but given now to softness with his age, but he still new how to use his size, Steve noted, watching him move around the room, showing little interest in what he found, but looking, nonetheless. Probably because he could.  Some show of power he thought he still held.
The photographers had disappeared from the red carpet by the time he and Steve made their way down the steps.  A number of other guests were also waiting for their rides.  Tony kept himself plastered to Steve’s side while they waited for Happy.  Steve still hadn’t let go of his hand, and for that, Tony was eternally grateful.  He thought he might start shaking and never stop, but for Steve’s solid grip on his hand, keeping him together somehow.
Tony’s fingers fidgeted as he adjusted his tie, trying to catch his reflection in the window while the sedan rolled through the Los Angeles traffic.  Twenty-seventh time’s the charm, he thought dully, willing the tie to straighten.
Half an hour later, Steve was standing outside Brock’s door, ready to knock when the door was jerked open and Brock stood on the other side, his face a mask of accusation.
“Sure, Steve,” Natasha said calmly, mouth pursing into a moue as she considered her cards.  “Your move, Tony,” she said slyly, looking over at him from beneath her lashes.
“You look good,” Tony said. His voice slurred, and he blinked somewhat hazily at Steve, but it was a happy, loose sort of dazed.  The kind of easy softness that Steve didn’t think he’d seen on Tony’s face before.
Tony’s hand moved from the back of Steve’s head to the column of Steve’s throat, and then Tony’s cock was jerking in his mouth, hitting the back of Steve’s throat and coating it with warm jets of come.   Tony’s hand held fast against Steve’s throat, pressing lightly so he could feel the shape of his own cock held inside Steve’s throat as it pumped through the aftershocks, thrusting hard down into Steve's throat.  Steve felt his own cock responding as his throat worked convulsively around Tony's cock, trying to swallow the jets of come coating the back of his throat.  His hips jerked as the orgasm that had been building all morning slammed into him.  He sucked hard at Tony's cock when Tony pulled back a bit, trying to keep him deeper, earning a pleased growl from his Alpha.
“Fifteen minutes,” Howard said, giving Tony a pointed look when the boy raised his head at the words.  “You’re not off the hook, you hear?”  Tony watched him for a moment, but said nothing, only nodded, once, slowly.
Shivering slightly at the odd thought, Steve forced himself to try to look around and gain his bearings.  There was little to help him mark his location.  Everything was grayed out, the way snow might cover the village in the winter, painting it white, but the only white he could see was specks high above.  The rockface of the mountain sheared upwards into jagged points, disappearing into a thin layer of clouds that seemed to almost hover there.  Fog blanketed the  gorge beneath him, making it seem bottomless.  Even the sky appeared colorless. The sun, if it was up, was not visible here, hidden, he supposed by the mountains and their skirt of clouds.  He wasn’t even sure what time of day or night it was.  It could be either, he realized, rather disconcerted by the notion. The hoary sky gave away nothing of its secrets.
“You’re not a student, Tony.  You can’t be here,” Steve protested as he unzipped his backpack and pulled his textbook, two highlighters and an assortment of half-chewed pens with various business logos on them that made Tony want to weep when his mind flashed to Steve chewing on the end of a charcoal pencil while he figured out how to get what he wanted to draw to somehow leave his head and come to life on the page.   It was strangely comforting, the normalcy of the habit.
“You said you took the money. From Howard,” Tony choked out, the words seeming to stick in his throat as his body vibrated with tension, like his skin was stretched too tightly around his bones all of a sudden. “Is that—was that true? Did you take the money? It wasn't in the pre-nup...was it some side agreement with Howard? It's okay. I understand. I mean, we were kids, right? So, its okay. If you took it. I just—I just need to know. For the lawyers,” Tony added, swallowing around the lie.
“Stop ah-ing.  It’s making me nervous,” Tony protested in a jittery voice.  “It was stupid.  I don’t know why I did that in the first place.  It was my birthday.  He took me to Caltech.  Caltech, Jarvis! I was excited, and got carried away.  I don’t know what I was thinking. I…it was stupid, okay?” Tony said, tossing his hands up in the air, before shoving them across his chest and tucking his hands under his arms.
“Tony, it’s okay,” Steve replied gently.  He sounded hesitant and kept blocking the water, as if he expected Tony to bolt if he got a little dewy, but there was no judgment in his voice, just understanding and sympathy.  “Do you want to get out?”
“Company’s yours.  Always has been,” Steve shrugged, sidling over a bit on the bed so he could lay on his back and pull Tony into the curve of his body.  “You wanna make omelet makers, I’m onboard.  In good conscious, I can’t really see my way to giving you an endorsement, but do what you want.”
“Look, it’s just—he—Steve—he took care of me, you know?  I may have given him a bit of a hard time about it.  Not the best patient, here.  You may be familiar with that particular personality quirk,” Tony acknowledged when she rolled her eyes.  “So, he gets some ravioli, okay?  It’s not metaphorical ravioli, for Christ’s sake.  Hell, I bought you donuts that time you stabbed me in the neck. It’s a thing,” Tony grumbled.  “Don’t look at me like that,” he protested as her gaze went hard and knowing.
Tony had done this.  For him.  Taken one of Steve’s nightmares and destroyed it, more fully than Steve would have allowed himself to do, he recognized that much, and there was something humbling in that, this willingness of Tony’s to bear the burden of mercilessness.  All while Steve was wandering the gardens, watching Tony work and looking at maps.  I would have killed Rumlow, Steve mused.  Had I the chance. Honorably.  In a fair fight.  He would have died.  Quickly and easily.  But, I wanted this, even if I refused to give in to that viciousness, and Rumlow would have died, mocking me, with an insult on his lips, taking as much power as he could with him when he did.  Instead, he would die alone, in ignominy, with no way to hurt anyone else, and when Steve thought of Rumlow, if he thought of him, that is how he would remember the man who once tormented him.  Hunched over on his knees and screaming from a throat so parched it burned, with no one hearing him except the wind and the sea birds who floated on the gusts by the shore, searching for fish and answering with their own screams in return.
These times, though.  The on-my-way-missed-you-times…Tony thought he might like those the best.  Maybe because they were rare, as if they required enough torque and friction to push past whatever held that part of Steve in check at other times.  And, God, did Tony like it when all that carefully crafted, polished and perfected exterior fell away and that edge of power, that hum of violence, leashed and caged for Tony, only for Tony, got just that much closer to the surface, that much closer to being set free, and it was all for Tony.  All
“Come to Papa, baby,” Hammer said, gesturing towards the pile of chips that the dealer had stacked in a tray.  “Sorry, old friend, old pal, old chap,” Hammer said. “Looks like I win tonight.”
“Jesus,” Tony breathed out, arching his back at the same time he twined his fingers tightly through Steve’s, holding on.  “Jesus.  Steve.  I—“
“Garden club.  Best tomatoes,” Tony replied, twisting his mouth around the words.  “She was very proud.”
He wondered what Tony was doing.  He would be back in New York by now.  No long lines at security for him.  Probably in his workshop, Steve thought with a slight smile.  The way Tony described it, the space sounded almost fantastical to Steve, but it was easy enough to picture Tony fixing some delicate piece of machinery with tiny, precision tools or wrenching some huge metal part into place.  The man was good with his hands and surprisingly strong for someone who seemed to live a life of leisure, Steve thought, then coughed and shifted uncomfortably in his tiny seat while Brock’s head tipped forward and he let out a muffled snore.
“How bad is it?  You know, he strikes me as the type to have tried a Flowbee back in the day.  You missed the Flowbee.  Right.  God, your late-night infomercial oeuvre is sadly lacking,” Tony groused.
“Maybe it would be easier if I could.  Walk away, I mean,” Tony called out. “But, I couldn’t manage that ten years ago, and I hated you.  I sure as hell can’t do it now.  Steve, please, I’m not playing some kind of game,” Tony said, reaching up to grab Steve’s shoulder and hauling him back.  “I’m not doing this to hurt you.  God, Steve, that’s the last thing I want to do.  I’m doing this because I can’t do anything else.  I can’t go back to not having you in my life, because you—
Moving back to the wall and into position, Steve lined his cock up with the stranger’s hole and slowly pushed inside. God, it felt good, he thought, letting out a groan as he bottomed out in one long, slow thrust. This was easy. His body knew the right thing to do. He found a good angle that hit the hard nub deep inside the man’s body and got a rhythm going, taking his time and savoring the warm, liquid heat of the man’s channel clenching around him like a glove. It wasn’t long before he heard a broken-off shout from behind the wall and felt the man’s body shudder and bear down as he must have orgasmed, though Steve wasn’t quite done, so just kept pumping his cock in and out, enjoying the feeling of the man’s inner walls shaking around him as he came.
With a sigh, he ducked into the cave and knelt in front of the Stranger, waiting.  As always, the Stranger didn’t know how to signal him with a tap on his shoulder to indicate it was acceptable for him to raise his eyes.  Instead, the Stranger made sounds. All kinds of sounds. Long, humming strings of sounds.
Which, in retrospect, probably explained why it took him about three seconds too long to realize it was Obie and not Steve who was walking into the suite.
“How about I stop thinking myself out of being happy and you stop blaming yourself for my decisions?” Steve suggested softly.
“They weren’t—he was good,” Tony corrected, though why the instant need to do so burned through him so quickly, he wasn’t sure.  These were Steve’s friends, after all.  With the exception of Jane and possibly Wilson, both of whom seemed to be relatively new to the circle, They knew him probably a lot better than Tony ever had, so what was the point?  But, he couldn’t not say it, so there was that.  Some leftover need to defend someone who didn’t need or deserve it, who the hell knew?  Except…except Steve had been good at his artwork.  Damn good.  Better than that crap Pepper made him buy.  “You were good.”
The ride back to his hotel took a bit longer with morning traffic, particularly since Steve and Brock’s hotel was well off the Strip.  Happy punctuated the ride with the occasional tidbit about some point of interest that sounded like he had been reading Vegas brochures in the hotel lobby.  Still, Steve appreciated the effort since he couldn’t muster much in the way of conversation.  He was still too preoccupied with thoughts of the night before swirling in his mind and his own failing attempts to keep them at bay.
The unexpectedness of the question sent a jolt of shock through Steve.  He stood there, in front of a large, black platform boot, with silver stars glowing up the sides, and tried to find some kind of answer that he wanted to give.
The bottom floor of the inn held a large common room with benches and tables for serving food and drink surrounding a stone-faced hearth over which a pot of stew brewed, a common enough sight, even to Steve’s eyes.  Smells from the kitchen and the crush of people filled the room, but the rushed mats on the floor were new, and someone had hung sprigs of lavender on the doorways.  Cam ushered him towards the stairs. No one spoke to him, let alone touched him, though Steve could feel the weight of their curiosity on him.
He heard Tony make an aborted sound that might have been a gasp or a cry, he wasn’t sure, but when he looked up, Tony was watching him intently, eyes dark and mouth slightly parted. Steve bent his head again and nuzzled his nose into the thick, curly hair that surrounded Tony’s cock, then lowered his mouth and darted his tongue out to lick one of Tony’s balls. The skin there was wrinkled and soft with a fine down of hair covering it. He gently lapped at it, tasting the salt and sweat and his own juices on his tongue as he cleaned. Finally, he pulled it into his mouth, and felt Tony’s cock jump against his cheek and a few drops of warm wetness hit the side of his face as he worked it around in his mouth, swirling his tongue and sucking lightly. The other ball was heavy and full now as he gave it the same attention, enjoying the different texture of it in his mouth.
“I’ll have you know that the evening went very well.  Great dinner.  Nice view.  The fountains are great.  Have you seen them?  You should see them.  I told Steve about the company and that Estes guy.  Barnes played referee on that one.  Steve’s in love with me, I
“You did say SHIELD wanted him to Bond,” Jarvis reminded him.  “Seemed rather urgent, if I recall the night your father met with Director Fury.”
“The same,” Coulson told him.  Steve nodded and ducked his head, mouth tightening into a flat line.  She wasn’t the same.  She would never be the same. That was the problem.  “I should let you get going,” Coulson said. “Don’t want Tony to get lonely up there.  Though, I’m sort of interested in what that would produce.”
That was...definitely perfect. Mostly. Almost. It was. It was just...odd. But, good-odd. Definitely odd of the good variety.
“I know about keeping the government’s secrets, Director.  But, surely, Anthony would have to know before agreeing to the Bonding,” Steve said. “Otherwise—"
This is a story of how an Omega had an adventure, and found himself doing and saying things altogether unexpected, Tony mentally paraphrased with a sigh, closing his eyes against the white-bright of the sun as it peeked out from behind the clouds.
He had no idea what he was going to do now.  He’d lied to Brock.  To say that Brock was going to be disappointed in him was probably an enormous understatement, but Steve just hadn’t been able to go through with it.  Standing there, pen in hand, he’d tried.  He’d really, really tried to make himself go through with it, tried so long that Janie asked him if he wanted to sit in one of the conference rooms and think about it.
Tony looked down and felt his cheeks flush warm with embarrassment.  He’d forgotten that he had gotten all maudlin this morning and put on Steve’s ARMY shirt.
“Tony…are you…are you okay?  With this?  Being here, I mean…you seemed—on the way up here, you seemed…well, I don’t know.  Agitated, I guess,” Steve asked, bringing his hand up and running it through Tony’s hair, just behind his right temple.   Steve’s eyes dipped down for a flash, landing on the center of Tony’s chest before drawing back to Tony’s face with a look tight with concern.
He pulled out his wallet and took out a ten to pay for the coffee.  His finger briefly touched the folded paper tucked inside, and he paused, squinting up at the Tower in front of him, before tucking his wallet back into his pants’ pocket.
me out of bed with a sweet piece of ass like that in it. Bet he takes it like a champ, huh? All slick and easy, you know how they get, but tight, too, ‘cause you know they aren’t going to pass off some subway O on Captain America? No way, man, no way.”
A stab of self-loathing churned in Steve’s gut.  He would have to do something to make this right, he thought, as he shut the door to his apartment, stripped out of his clothes as he went to his bedroom.  He put on the loose-fitting pajama bottoms and lay down atop the cool sheets on the bed, trying to think of something that could convince Tony that this wasn’t about Tony or anything Tony had done, just Steve and his…his…crush?  That sounded too high-school, but the word ‘crush’ had the ring of desperate truth to it.  That was what it felt like sometimes, being crushed, everything wrung out, every feeling squeezed forth in Tony’s wake, but unable to do anything about it, immobilized by the force of it all.  Which was really just a fancy way of saying scared, Steve thought.  Tony thought he was brave, had said so time and time again, but when it came down to it, Steve had let Tony suffer while he tried to make things easier on himself by pushing Tony away.
Tony hummed, taking another bite of his risotto, then waiting while one of the servers refilled his wine glass.
His knuckles made contact with the punching bag with a satisfying thunk, each hit draining some of the frustration the past few days had wrought.
“Um…yes.  I…help with the painting,” Steve said, turning to Tony to see if he’d said something wrong.
“Where’s Tony?” Peggy asked.  “I thought he’d be home from that school by now.”  Jarvis, sitting on the sofa across from her, looked down at the cup in his hands, still full, Steve noted, his expression carefully shuttered, which probably answered more than Steve really wanted to ask.
“I should get ready,” Steve said, standing and brushing the crumbs off his robe for the birds to find.
Whatever it was that Steve couldn’t just do—which, if he’d been in a mood to do so, Tony could’ve told Preston was really not a good approach with Steve-- but anyway, whatever it was ended up lost forever, probably somewhere with Preston’s dignity, Tony assumed, since Steve just grabbed the poor man by the shirtfront and tossed him out the open door behind him with a flick of his wrist.  Preston hit the far wall hard enough to make a deep, round indentation in the drywall and splinter the wood behind it.  He sort of just slowly slid down the wall to the carpet below with a wide-eyed stare and his mouth forming an ‘O’ of surprise as he titled over and slumped to the side.
He felt, as much as heard, Tony walk over to stand in front of him, suddenly deeply attuned to the other man’s presence.  He lifted his eyes and tried to focus on Tony.  Steve could smell him, sweat and metal and
“You really think it’s your metaphor I’d have a problem with if I followed the Vatican Councils?” Steve asked.
“You know me so well,” Tony said, looking down at the small box clutched in his hand.  Hammer was probably dirty, at least to some degree.  Hard to get where he was without greasing a few politicians’ palms to make it happen.  It had been years since Tony poked around HI’s network, more out of curiosity, drunkenness and a desire to see just how easy it would be than any real interest in corporate espionage. Hell, the backdoor he’d put in HI’s network was probably still sitting there, waiting to be used.  Hammer did his cybersecurity in-house, which meant it was run by a bunch of sycophants who couldn’t get jobs literally anywhere else.
, Steve’s mind hummed.  It was a nice name.  Some of the names now were so different, but Anthony…he liked how it sounded.  Someone would Bond with Anthony, and soon, most likely, given his age.  Hopefully, someone who would make him happy.  Alphas wanted their Omegas to be happy, right?  Someone like that probably had a line of suitors.  His parents would undoubtedly make sure they found an Alpha who would take care of him.  Someone who would appreciate that spark of spirit Steve could see so clearly in the picture.
Maybe Tony would like to visit?  They could take a tour.  Maybe Tony could see some real robots up close.  Get some ideas, maybe.  He would like that, wouldn’t he?  Steve pictured Tony’s face lighting up at the suggestion, his voice getting fast and high-pitched with excitement, his eyes bright, looking up at Steve with happiness instead of the dull, snappish fear that was always lurking there.
“I guess it doesn’t matter now, not really,” Natasha said.  “You should ask Bruce or Helen.  You know I’m not the science geek around here, just the muscle.”
“Um…” okay, so it was harder to actually say out loud than it had been in his head.  “I’m…fine, I guess.  But…um…well, I wanted to ask about maybe some…additional work?”  He could feel the flush heating his cheeks as he said it.
“Some nights.  Not always. I’ll wake up and the bed, it’s too soft, like…like I’m going to sink down, right through it, and I’ll wake up and be back over there.  I know it doesn’t make sense,” Steve told him.  “I know it’s stupid.  Crazy. Whatever you want to call it.  But, the floor is solid and the bed’s not, and I can tell myself nothing is going to happen over and over, but those nights, if I want to sleep, I have to sleep on the floor.  And I hate myself a little bit each time I do it.  It’s like that part of me, that messed up part, is winning when I do it, but it’s not.  It’s not, Tony, because we’re here.  Each day, we keep going, and we’re here.  The messed up part isn’t winning, but it wants you to feel like it is, so it tells you how stupid you are when you sleep on the floor because that’s the thing that’s getting you to the next day.”
“Probably because you have a suspicious nature,” Steve said, slipping into an easy grin as he leaned back in his chair.  “Though, to be fair, not entirely without some justification.  Should we…should we head out?” Steve asked, casting a look over his shoulder.  Tony followed his gaze, surprised to see that there were only a few other patrons left in the restaurant.   Tony waved the head waiter over and settled the bill while Steve stepped out to the restroom.  When he walked out of the alcove where the Chef’s table was located, he found Steve complimenting the Chef and apparently, along with waxing poetic about the food and service, thanking the man for preparing dishes that didn’t kill him.
kept you up nights.  He was fancy, little night music, I don’t know,” Tony replied.  “Look, the point is, I’m trying here, so can you…you know, give me something?” Tony asked plaintively.
“If you ever leave my bed without permission again, I’ll chain you to it,” the King told him as Steve’s eyes snapped to his, wide with shock.  The King stood up then and walked back to his chair, sitting down and pulling out another volume from the stack of books while Steve looked on in mute helplessness.  “You may go,” the King said without looking up from his book.
He kept measuring things by some entirely different scale, probably because he wanted to see more in these gestures than was really there.  To make all this something it wasn’t.  To make him something he wasn’t.
“Thanks,” Steve called out, not looking back, just forward.  Head down, shoulders back, soldier, we go forward.  The mantra’s voice in his head sounded like Phillips, but Phillips was dead, barking orders at God now, and Steve was here, head down, shoulders back, going forward.
“I will never hurt you, Tony. I give you my word. I know that doesn't mean a lot to you right now, and you got no reason to trust me. I hope you'll change your mind on that, but if you don't, that's okay, too. Promise still stands. But, you're my Omega. You're—we're bonded. I never thought I'd have an Omega, and definitely not one like you. I mean, look at you,” Steve continued almost shyly, throwing out a hand in Tony's direction.
“When have you known me to do something that rash?  Anyway, I have to get back.  You’ll be best man, right?  Great, thanks, bye,” Tony said, thumbing the phone off on Rhodey’s bark of his name.  He looked over his shoulder at where Steve sat at their table.  Table at the back of the restaurant, with his back to the wall, able to see all the exits.  Soldier, Tony thought.  Well, not like he didn’t have a type.
“There is no reason we can’t take a regular flight just like everyone else, Tony.  We can charter a boat to the island once we get there,” Steve replied, clearly not understanding about the pole, thank God.  He suspected Steve would not approve.
“I seem to recall we figured that out pretty well, eventually,” Steve said, biting his lip between his teeth to hold back a grin.
The back of his hand itched.  Not a scratchy-itch.  The stinging kind of itch.  The kind that got under your skin, like an army of ants marching through your veins.  That—the itchy, stinging pull--was what woke him, all at once, with a sharp alertness that had been learned—no, remembered—in the dark of a cave.  He knew it was a combination of the IV and his imagination, but he couldn’t quite shake the idea, not here in the dark when terrible ideas seemed more possible.
“The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory,” Tony amended when Steve gave him a blank look.  “They’re trying to detect cosmic gravitational waves.”  Among other things that Tony wasn’t supposed to have been hacking into the MIT and Caltech servers and reading up on.  Also, probably not the National Science Foundation servers, either, but it wasn’t his fault the firewall was clearly built by the same people, so that door had practically already been open for him.
Okay, I know it isn't a real update, but look!  Stripper!Steve!  No wonder Tony wanted to fake marry him.  Find more art and commission info at sgtjimbarnes.tumblr.com.  In the meantime, enjoy the beauty that is a mostly naked Steve Rogers.  Tony sure is.
“Well, see, then, yeah,” Tony replied, mentally stumbling for words. “What I'm saying is, it's fine. Well, not fine, but, I mean, I'm not going to let what happened before keep us from having something we both clearly want now.”
“BARF.  Really gotta work on that acronym, though, it is strangely appropriate for a college crowd,” Tony admitted with a shrug.  His hands were unbuckling his belt and pulling it out of the loops with a zip.  It, too, went on the counter, next to Tony’s jacket.  “Yeah.  That bit of tech is probably the most self-indulgent thing I’ve done. Present company excluded.  But, it makes the point.”
Steve watched Fury walk away, his back to Tony.  Tony looked down at the plate of food he was holding, wondering if he could make it to the exit before Steve did.
“I was just over at the slots,” Steve frowned, turning a bit to where he had been sitting not too far away. Though, the casino was crowded and all the lights and noises made it hard to find people, he supposed.
“Not you,” Tony replied with an apologetic look.  “Not this time. There’s something that I...have been thinking for a while that I want to show the Raj’Inama.” He looked over at Steve, a flash of something strained and almost pained darkening his features for a moment.  Steve frowned, a question on his lips “Which I very much hope he will like,” Tony said in a thick, rough voice, his eyes going soft and bright. Steve frowned, a question on his lips, but Tony cut him off before he could ask it. “Now, good night, you two,” Tony finished quickly, turning and walking away before Steve could say anything in return.  “Cam, see that he rests, and there’s a horse in it for you.”
A splash cut him off.  Just to his left, behind one of the larger rocks whose algae-covered top was just visible at low tide.  Shellhead’s head appeared, then his eyes. He hovered there, lolling in time with the waves, just out of reach.
He pushed the button again, then tried the one for 4A, which got an equally less-than-rambunctious response. He pushed them all like a child in an elevator, then fingered the edge of the call box off and glanced inside. Huh. Either the rats around here were into electrical engineering or some seriously heavy bondage, because they’d carried off most of the wiring, he thought wryly. Probably the only thing in the whole building worth carting off.
But, he couldn’t forget Zola’s demand that Steve call him Master.  He couldn’t forget Sitwell’s hands on him while he hung there with hatred burning in his veins as Rumlow looked on.  He couldn’t forget Hammer telling him to crawl.  He couldn’t forget Cam in his white robe.  So brave, braver than Steve had ever been.  Braver than Steve was now.
Tony pulled the ribbon off the box and flipped the lid open, revealing an assortment of pastries, including his favorite chocolate-covered glazed. He picked one up and bit off a large chunk, chewing slowly, mostly to give himself a moment to answer.
“No jumping on the bed.  If you build a pillow fort, you have to put them back when you’re done,” Tony said.
Tomorrow, Steve would no longer be able to ignore the reality of what was to come. Tomorrow, he would have to begin to put his plan into motion or give up on it, curl himself around Tony and let this be who he was for the rest of his days.  Tomorrow, he would decide.  Whatever the outcome, the inertia that had sunk into his bones the past few months would have to cease.  Since the night he’d told Tony what Lord Stane offered and watched as the full force of Tony’s wrath was turned on the man who had been as close to family as anyone for Tony, Steve had let himself be carried along by whatever it was between him and Tony, swept through the days like a leaf floating down a river as it thundered over rocks and gullies.
By the time he navigated New York City traffic back to the Tower from Brooklyn, the skyline was lit up like Christmas, his name clearly visible in the middle of it all. He thought again of Steve's comments about the Tower, and couldn't help trying to look at his bouncing bundle of capitalistic excess through that filter. It was on the ostentatious side of gaudy, sure, but there was beauty there, too, at least to him. And to Steve, apparently. He decided to just ignore the too-obvious parallels in that particular sentiment.
“Believe it or not,” Steve continued, his eyes dropping to where the dog tags dipped just below the curve of Tony’s black tank top.  “They tried to deny you’d been there.  As if I don’t recognize a level of destruction from a box of scraps that only you can achieve by now,” Steve teased.  The attempt fell flat, sounded almost wistful when you took away the words, but Tony appreciated the effort.
“No, no, belay that,” Tony said quickly, slashing a hand through the air and turning around to face Steve. He winced tightly as he seemed to catch the edge of the drafting table with his hip. Steve’s frown deepened. “I—I’m fine. No, really, don’t give me that look, it’s entirely within the realm of possibility that I am not, in fact, just saying that,” Tony said, holding up one hand. “Seriously, Cap, I’m fine. I’m fine. I’m—” he broke off and groaned, covering his face with his hands.
Steve supposed that was one way to put it, though he doubted General Rhodes had been quite so delicate.
“He’s…I don’t know. Talks a lot. Seems nice enough,” Steve said with a shrug he realized she couldn’t see, and looked over his shoulder in automatic embarrassment. “He’s what they say, I guess.”
Impossible, Tony thought to himself.  It was physically impossible.  The amount of force that required…and it happened so fast…it really was impossible.  Sometimes I’ve believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast, Tony recited to himself.  The car door opened next to him and Steve hopped into the seat beside him. The driver opened the door in front of Tony and climbed behind the wheel without a word and started the engine.
He turned the phone on and scrolled through his somewhat thin contact list for Nat’s number. The screen was cracked, distorting her name, and he had to hit it a few times to get it to dial, like the damn phone itself was fighting him on it.
“I—“ Tony started.  He broke off and sucked in a breath, glancing down for a long moment.  “I don’t want you to walk away from this.  I don’t.  I need your help.  Not just with Stern and that whole thing, but this whole marriage thing is a great distraction.   Everyone thinks I fucked up.  Not without some precedent, I’ll admit.  I’ve gotten five emails from Obie, all about whether I got a pre-nup or how I can get a post-nup and what lawyers he used for his divorces.”
Tony shoved a hand down the front of his panties and grasped his own leaking cock.  It was so hard and full, smeared with pre-cum from where it had spread in the confines of the panties.  He stroked it, coating it with his own pre-cum until it was smooth, giving his hand a twist just over the head.  Then, his hand was jerked away and planted next to his head on the bed.
“That worked.  It worked, until you made me take it apart, but it worked,” Tony cut in, almost out of air, his throat was so tight, but it had
“I guess not,” Steve agreed, somewhat reluctantly, screwing his face up into a frown. “Though, the Devil would probably lie about it.”
Ellis even had ice brought down from the mountaintops and stored in deep vaults under the keep, which they used to cool their drinks and, on the first night Tony arrived, even had a massive block of it carved into the shape of a deer’s head.  At Steve’s skepticism, Tony insisted they go down to the Great Hall to see what remained of it, and even though the sculpture had largely melted by then, Steve could see the outline of what it had been. Such a thing seemed amazingly decadent, all that effort for something you couldn’t even use, but Steve supposed you only had the opportunity to entertain royalty so often.
“You could never be like them, either, Tony, not really,” Steve said in a harsh, bitter whisper tinged with an old regret.  “You’re mine, and I’m yours, and this…this will never be what that was.”
“Sorry,” Tony said with a grimace as he gently pressed the cloth to Steve.  “I’ll have them be sure to leave warm water next time.”  It was cold, but not uncomfortable, Steve thought, though the thought had little substance to it.  Letters formed into words, that was all it was.  Everything was feeling right now, and this feeling wasn’t bad, so he settled into it and let Tony clean him.  “You should soak tomorrow.  Not that I don’t appreciate your enthusiasm, but you are far too rough with yourself.  I noticed the first night, too.  You must take your time.  There is no hurry.  Besides, I like getting you ready. I know some don’t, but…it pleases me,” the King added, giving his head a little shake as his brows drew together and his lips tugged up at the corners.
“Eh, you know, I'm really not all that broken up about it," Stark cut in, face scrunching up a bit as if the notion bothered him.  "Anyway, as long as you beat that, you’re not even in my top ten bad dates, the way I see it,” he offered, holding both hands splayed in front of him, then reaching for a piece of bread and taking a big bite.
I’ll start leaving him tomorrow, Steve thought with a jolt that felt like being dunked in ice water.  He wasn’t ready for the next blow, which hit low, finding the place where his ass and thighs joined, so hard it made him jerk forward with the force of it.
His phone pinged, and Steve picked it up off the dresser to check his texts.  A new text from an unknown number informed him that a car was waiting for him downstairs.
Maria waved her hand in the air with a tittering laugh.  “Listen to me go on.  You’re retired, out here to enjoy the holiday, not listen to me complain about my husband’s long hours at work!  Daniel, get some shots of the house. It’s so pretty this time of year.  I don’t know why Howard won’t come here more often.  I like it, away from all the hustle and bustle of Beverly Hills,” she said in a tone that implied that this must be the thing to say, whether it was true or not. “Tony used to love it here when he was little.”
“I really do.  You really love me, too, huh?” Steve replied, cocking his head to one side as he tried to angle his body so he could look up at Tony.  He squinted a bit, smile going wobbly and a bit giddy, then grinned, full and happy, up at Tony.  Like a switch being flicked, Tony thought to himself.  Except, I can flip it the other way.  Sometimes.  Maybe not all the time, but sometimes.  Who knew?  Maybe that’s what love is, when you got down to it.  Not that thing that fixes you.  Not the thing that changes the whole world.  But, that little push that switches you to happiness.  That one thing that tips the scales. Tony blinked, throat suddenly tight, and swallowed around the lump that had floated up from his chest.
“Get some sleep, okay?” Brock said, then yawned and punched at the pillow before flipping over on his stomach.
The shield is gone, swallowed by the sea, and so was I, Steve thought to himself.  That had to mean Er’Skeen was wrong about him. Wrong about the prophecy. Like Tony said, prophecy was a changeling, molded to fit whatever circumstances arose.  It wasn’t real, any more than the remembered taste of the bitter brew that filled his mouth was real, but he couldn’t seem to shake the feeling of wrongness that always accompanied those memories, like his foot missed the last step, and even though he wasn’t falling, his mind didn’t seem to know that.
“This is an ‘I’m going to start chewing in the candle wax if we don’t get some breadsticks’-fine,” Tony answered.
The desire to earn Tony’s attention coursed through him, slow and tortuous. To be worthy of it by being good.  To be seen only when he knew he had already done well. To not worry about being seen, only being good. No need to think about what anyone else thought of him.  It didn’t matter. No one was paying attention.
“Has to be more than ‘just a guy in a suit’ to do what he does,” Steve countered, feeling his spine stiffen at the slight.  Just a guy in a suit? Iron Man?  “He’s a hero, too, right?  He’s an amazing pilot.  He’d have to be smart to work that suit.  I’ve seen just how sophisticated—ah.  The model.  At the Smithsonian exhibit.  It looks pretty complex.”
“I—I just don’t want to. Tonight.  I don’t want to do this,” Steve replied, holding Tony’s gaze steadily.  His stomach roiled, not with fear, exactly, but with a desperate hope.  The worst kind of terror.  The one that dared to want something impossible.
“I missed you, too, Colonel,” Barnes said, then stood, saluted, and grinned as he moved to the bench across the aisle.
The prompt request was for something from Gift With Purchase Remix.  If you haven't read it, I don't know how much sense this will make, but basically, Steve is a hooker because he needs money for his mom's medical bills (I know), and Tony picks him up and sweeps him away from the clutches of Hammer, who had Very Bad Plans for dear Steve.
As they drove, Tony tried again to picture the faceless man he was going to meet, but the image that kept creeping in was someone who looked vaguely like Obie, just in a military uniform, jowls shaking while he told Tony to make sure he got a clean, close shave, just like the commercials promised.  He’d tried to find out some information on the Internet about Captain Steve Rogers, and there had been some hits, but no one seemed particularly likely.  The one active duty hit he found was married with three kids and living at Fort Bragg, which, okay, sure, some oil-soaked sheik might decide to get himself an Omega on the side, but not a corn-husking Presbyterian from NeverGoHere, Nebraska.  The other Captain Steve Rogers he was able to find was retired and raising bees, and as nice as that had initially sounded, not really someone whom his father would look to for connections.
“No,” Steve cut in. “I’m not…Bonding.  No.”  His jaw clicked shut, hard.  He could feel his teeth grate together.  That was…that was insane.  Obviously.  She didn’t understand. For a moment, his memory pulled up a stack of photos, black and white, bent at the edges from being passed around, grime-covered prints on them, and he quickly shoved that thought away, where it belonged.  Bonding was for…people who weren’t him.
Tony’s hand wrapped around Steve’s cock again, stroking the over-sensitive skin a few times, making him groan.  Releasing him, Tony’s hand worked downward, cupping and lifting Steve’s balls, then lower still, tracing an oil-slicked finger down the crease of Steve’s ass until it found the pucker of his hole.
Tony was kissing his shoulder, then. A long line of kisses, nipping and sucking, even as his finger burned a path deep inside. It always hurt a bit, just at first. Not a bad pain, just a stretching, searing burn and the sense of being full that slowly abated as Tony worked at his hole.
Steve let his head sink to Tony’s shoulder, rocking his forehead back and forth against the hardness of Tony’s collarbone, then pressing his mouth there as he wrapped his arms under Tony’s, winding them up Tony’s back and pulling the other man’s chest to his.  He heard the small hitch of breath from Tony, then felt him shudder once and go nearly limp.  After a moment, Tony’s hands snaked around Steve’s waist until they fit together, intimate, yes, but it already felt like something had shifted. It might have been both of them.
“Steve,” Tony tried. “Can we—can we just, maybe, I don't know, go somewhere—the hall, back to the coffee shop or—fuck, I don't care—just—just to talk?” Tony stuttered, his jaw grinding together with the effort not to beg. He could feel his hands curling into fists against his sides, fingers rubbing back and forth against each other in an effort to keep his agitation in check before he did something truly stupid, like throw himself at Steve and—and what?
Tony caught Steve’s expression and barked out a laugh. He  lifted Steve’s hand and brushed his lips across the knuckles, then ran a hand through Steve’s hair and went back to digging through the bag, pulling out a loaf of hard bread wrapped in a course cloth, strips of dried meat and two apples. “Eat,” Tony urged, handing a strip of the salty meat to Steve.  “Or we’ll end up giving them something to truly try to ignore,” Tony said, rolling over and planting a kiss on top of Steve’s head.
Just two guys being fake-married pals, sitting inches apart, almost holding hands, trading wedding rings.
“Fascinating, to be sure,” Jarvis said.  “I’m glad you have something more to your liking to occupy your time up here. I must admit, I wondered. Rustic is not exactly a concept I normally associate with Tony, and yet, here you are. Roughing it, so to speak.”
“M'good,” Steve answered, drawing his gaze away from the night sky. “Can't believe we put a man on the moon. Can you imagine?”
“You look nice, too,” Tony told him, craning his neck a bit as he offered the compliment and adjusting his tie, though it didn’t need it.  Steve had the thought that either Tony’s hands or mouth needed to be doing something at any given time, and then felt his cheeks warm at the unintended meaning.
“Thanks,” Tony said again, glancing at the pad of paper Steve was holding.  Today’s test will be a written exam, it seems.
It was horrible.   He put a car battery in me, Steve.  He saved my life, but there was a fucking car battery in me, and I thought maybe they’d take it away, if I didn’t do what they wanted.   It was terrible and awful and all the words he didn’t want to say, and there was a gaping hole of wrongness in his chest, which sort of made sense, didn’t it, Tony getting his heart scraped out and a desperate replacement cobbled together from bits of karma and failure.
Stane straightened his suit jacket and made to walk out, stopping as he brushed past Tony.  “You have no idea the mistake you are making here, Tony, my boy.  I’ve always tried to look out for you.  Even when you were your own worst enemy.”
He looked up at the man, who smiled again, softer than before, and Steve thought it was a perfectly nice smile. He wondered why he had thought any differently before.
But, Hydra was different, Steve knew.  It was a different kind of warfare that Shmidt and his ilk brought with them, with their blasting cannons and the black powder that burned with such force it could tear holes through rock.  The wall is a shield, but it is not impenetrable, and can be breached, whether through it or under it, and once that happens, it is nearly impossible to shift defenses quickly enough to prevent invaders from making their way inside, simply due to relative numbers.
Tony stared at him for a long time, mouth slightly open, his eyes narrowed a bit, unsure and...calculating?  Yeah. Calculating some equation in his head that Steve was some kind of variable in, but he had no idea what it was.  “I’ll go,” he said finally.  “It’ll be nice to get out a bit, right?”
Two weeks of absolutely wonderful later, and Steve had gotten a lead on Bucky, somewhere in Northern Europe according to Natasha. Which is how Steve ended up in Dierdre’s office down in marketing, shuffling back and forth on his feet and trying not to blush as he asked for another copy of the Captain America promotional poster he’d viewed all those weeks ago. The one Tony had, uh…liked…so much.
“Hey, not my fault you named them,” Tony pointed out with a shrug.  “Besides, fish ponds. That’s a thing people have.  Charming in a quirky sort of way. Totally normal, though.”
“Are you okay?” Steve asked, the same way he'd asked that day on the street outside his building, like he cared, like he was concerned, like he wanted to take it away, and God, didn't that fucking sting like a son-of-a-bitch? The utter gall of it, maybe that was the final straw, Tony thought, feeling something close off inside him, something that had been trying to open for too long.
“An artist paints truth?  Did you just say that out loud?” Kirk demanded, shaking his head with a disdainful look.
“I thought—I thought maybe,” Tony stopped, breathing out a huff of air. “I thought maybe this was what was missing.  That if I could give you this, maybe—maybe this would be enough.  But, I think—I see it now—I needed it, too.  Maybe I always did.  I didn’t understand, not until—kneeling there, seeing it.  I know it will never be the same for me as it is for you , but…I needed to see it.  For you. For James.  For them.  I’ll never know the full measure of what was taken from you, from him.  But I needed to see it for me, too. It is a hard thing.  To face the worst of what you can do,” Tony said, turning to face Steve. “But maybe it is the only way you can ever be capable of the best of yourself.”
No—that. That wasn’t what he’d meant to think.  Which, okay, that didn’t make any sense, either.  Crap.  Stop it, brain.  Eat your eggs.
“Tell us what to do,” Natasha replied, as calm as any of them, though her voice quavered, and maybe it was that, the fissure in her armor that broke through whatever it was clawing itself around Tony like a vice, holding him in place, holding him together, keeping what he was seeing at some kind of distance that his mind could allow.  “Bruce.  You have to tell us what to do here.”
“God, Tony, if they want a pound of flesh, it was on me. Not Wanda. Certainly not on you,” Steve rushed out, one hand going to tug at the neck of the uniform.  It was too tight. Binding.
Tony was watching him, skepticism narrowing his features into sharp relief.  Of course, Tony wouldn’t trust Steve on this. Why would he?
If he closed his eyes, he could see it.  Jimmy’s Balloon Darts on the Bowery, Tony remembered.   Colorful balloons on a pegboard, with a big sign dangling from the front of the booth warning, No Leaning Over the Table.  The tang of salt and fried food in the air, his stomach still protesting from too much saltwater taffy and too much screaming on the Cyclone, feeling almost lightheaded because this, this moment, was so good, so perfect, full of promise and a future where he got to have this so often that he got used to it.
“Yes.  Yes, she did.  Or, she thinks she did.  I met her many years ago, when I was very young.  And
“So,” Tony began, then left the syllable hanging, making a quickly abortive attempt to tap at the center of his chest before letting his hand drop to his side, where he snapped his fingers almost in time to the floors that lit up on the elevator’s keypad as they descended.
“Under no circumstances are we having this conversation right now,” Steve said, because he was very responsible and mature like that, even when he didn’t know what he was talking about.  Sure, if you’d asked Tony a few hours ago, he’d have said absolutely not, but now, the idea of not doing this when Steve was in heat was utterly preposterous and surely Steve could see that?
“I want to help.  I want to—to make you feel good,” Steve said. That seemed right.  Vague enough, anyway.
“I’m not hungry,” Tony replied.  “Water is fine.”  Mostly, he just wanted something to hold in his hands, but his throat was parched, and he kept having to clear it, and drinking gave him something to do that wasn’t talking.  Always a plus for his interpersonal relations, as pretty much anyone could attest.  Rogers picked up a bottle off the credenza and carried it around the table, holding it out in front of him towards Tony.
Tony stared down at him for a span of heartbeats, then let out a breath, lips quirking into a half-smile.  “You will join me in my carriage today,” Tony announced. “Rhodey insists on riding with his soldiers, and if I lack for company, Lord Harris insists on joining me and telling me more about why I should strip lands from Lord Emerson because the old reprobate has managed to produce thirteen bastards and no legitimate heir, despite the, no doubt quite formidable efforts, he committed to the attempts.  Breakfast first, though,” Tony said.
“I--” Steve began, glancing over towards the balcony where the same grayish light that covered the castle and gorge seeped in through a slit in the curtains. Was it late? Had he missed a whole day on his bizarre trek up here? It was hard to say. “I couldn’t impose.”
“Well. I promise you, that wasn't it,” Tony replied with a long, agitated sigh, the weight of it all suddenly almost too much. He needed to sit down, but he needed to move, the two impulses leading to jerky, nervous movements that he caught Steve watching with a frown and made himself still. Or tried to.
“Tony, you can’t do this,” Steve protested again, turning around and taking a step towards Tony. He was looking between Tony and his neighbor like he half expected one of them to let him in on the joke.  “You---Tony, come on.  You can’t—you.  Stop it.  Come on, he’s going to believe you,” Steve said, nodding at his neighbor, who sucked a long drink from the ubiquitous Styrofoam cup in his hand, then ducked inside his apartment where, and Tony had to physically resist the urge to roll his eyes again, the sounds of bottles clinking together could be heard.
“Whoa, wait, wait,” Tony interrupted, holding up his hand in a stop motion as his eyes went wide.  “This? This is what has been preying on your mind?” Tony demanded, his voice high with something that might have been relief.  He let his hand fall down against his thighs with a loud clap that reverberated through Steve’s chest.  “That I will—will,” he sputtered, as if searching for the word, “What? Tire of you and you will end up in some—God, does Cam still go on about the mines and the birds?  I really must take him on a tour or something.  Our mines are very modernized, you know, with proper ventilation and the latest—why am I saying this?” he shook his head and looked askance at Steve.  “You truly believe I would ever allow—” he stopped abruptly, mouth pursing in frustration as he tapped a finger to his goblet.  “I must remind myself that you know nothing of our ways, and all of this is foreign to you,” he sighed.  “Steve, you are a Royal concubine, a position that very few ever hold, and not only that, but you are—you are placed above all others.  Sold to others? You would never be…that would not happen.  I promise you.”
It took some time before Cam returned to the tent, but finally, the boy came back and announced that it was time to join the King and his guests for dinner. As they ducked under the flap of the King’s tent, Steve saw that it was nearly dark. The temperature was actually rather pleasant, he realized, as a low breeze ruffled the hem of his robes and made the beads and metal discs that adorned his outfit click softly as he walked.
.  Amazing.  Stupendous. They didn’t make enough words for what last night had been, Steve thought, smiling a bit at the ridiculousness of the thought.  In his wildest fantasies, he could never have imagined the way being with Shellhead made his body feel. If it was wrong, then he would say however many Hail Marys he needed to say, because the sin was easily worth the price.  Surely, though, God wouldn’t have made a body to feel that way and then forbade it?
But...what if they didn’t?  What if they sent him up to Stark’s suite? Could he really do this?  What was it, that saying he’d heard...lie back and think of--think of something.  Think of more zeros than he would ever see in his bank account again, he thought with a rueful grimace.
