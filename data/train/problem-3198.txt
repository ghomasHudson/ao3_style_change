She barely avoids certain death. As she passes an open doorway, Cas’ hand yanks at her shoulder, and something whizzes past her face, glinting and sharp. It speeds through another open doorway across the hall, into what Jess can now see is the kitchen. The object, a fireplace poker, embeds itself in a table that’s set up barricade-style at the far end of the room. The tabletop has already been pierced by an impressive collection of kitchen knives, but the poltergeist seems to be moving on to blunt objects now, having run out of sharps. Jess watches in disbelief as the pots and pans dangling from hooks above the stove take on a life of their own, throwing themselves at whoever is sheltering behind the table.
Rowena’s eyes flash purple fire in their depths. When she stands, her chair careens across the room to crash against the wall, shattering into several pieces with the force of impact.
Jess shrugs, moving her bag to the floor to make room so she can sit as well. “Fine. Cas was kind of moody, but what else is new? And Max seemed a lot more cheerful than I’ve seen him so far. Missouri really took him under her wing. I think the two of them sat up for a long time talking last night.”
: Welcome back! Reading your comments over the past week has been our main source of pleasure, so we're thrilled to share the next chapter so you can see what's happening to poor Cas.
A low voice rumbles through the silo. Fear lances through Castiel as he places the owner of that voice:
“Well, it’s the end of the world,” Scott says, a hint of irritation sparking in his voice. “It’s a little grim.”
The demon — Meg — laughs. “Clearly it wasn’t your razor sharp wit that attracted the boy to you. Lucky you’ve got a pretty face.”
“Cas!” Dean shouts, hoping that his words will do what he can’t.
A war wages behind Castiel’s eyes. Dean wants to push but holds himself back, knowing that Castiel has to make this decision on his own. He’s almost given up hope, but then Castiel sighs. Against Dean’s fingertips, the hard line of his jaw softens. “I don’t know what I want,” Castiel begins. His low, rough voice is almost inaudible as he confesses, “It’s been years since I was with a Dominant.”
A hint of desperation clings to the soft cry escaping from Castiel. His fingernails scrape at the material of his pants like he’s desperate to hold onto something. His hips shift restlessly, though in such small movements that Dean can tell he’s trying desperately to control himself. Despite Castiel’s best efforts, the bulge rising in his groin is proof enough of his slipping self-control.
He’s just come to that conclusion when the door to Castiel’s office opens. “Detective Winchester,” he says, giving no indication of whether or not he’s still displeased with Dean. “I think that I’m going to make an early night of it.”
A tiny frown darts across Cas’ face. “No,” is all Cas says. Dean’s heart clenches in his chest. For a moment he thinks that it’s over, but then Cas leans down to kiss him again.
They sit, looking at each other. Dean realizes they moved a little closer together while they were watching, but Cas is still almost at the other end of the couch from Dean, and suddenly that’s just too far away.
The bunker’s corridors are silent, but the inside of Castiel’s head is a cacophony of memories. It feels like mountains have risen, oceans been formed, in the time since he last passed this way, carrying Dean’s weight on his shoulders, murmuring soft reassurances.
Dean. Laughing on the couch next to him, sharing a crappy meal of fast food with him at a rest stop. His face gone slack with sleep, his eyes snapping in anger. A thousand different shades, and here he is, close to death in a filthy, abandoned silo, still trying to protect Castiel.
And yet. Sam has been having visions, apparently caused by demonic influence, and he was willing to lie about it: not only to Castiel, a stranger, but also to Dean, his brother. And, maybe worst of all, to Jess, who was the subject of Sam's visions. How was Jess helped by Sam keeping the truth from her? He was seeing the death of his girlfriend, his
“Come in,” she says, with infinite compassion in her eyes.
“Hello, Jack.” Castiel walks in and settles himself on the bench seat opposite his son. “Aren’t you going to eat your cereal?” He nods down at the soggy, misshapen cookie bites floating in milk.
the voice roars.
With effort, Castiel manages to drag himself away from the siren song of Dean’s lips. “Dean.
Sam had probably expected more of a fight from Dean, being well aware that he wasn’t too fond of being cooped up with strangers. The last time it’d happened, with the Apocalypse World hunters, Dean had been miserable and mostly stayed in his room.
A shadow falls across him as the stool to his immediate left is occupied. Castiel glances to his side in vague interest. He licks suddenly dry lips as he takes in the appearance of the man next to him. Bright green eyes gaze appreciatively up and down his frame, leaving tongues of fire in their wake. Plush lips part around the lip of a bottle as the man kills the neck in one long swallow. He tilts his head back, revealing the pale skin of his throat. Castiel’s eyes wander down from the man’s face to look appreciatively on his broad shoulders and narrow waist. Bowed legs bracket the stool, and Castiel can’t help but wish he was between them.
than your friend.”
Another sob wracks him, and more tears run down his face, no matter how hard he squeezes his eyes shut to prevent them. He had let himself hope that, this time, when he became fully human, he would be allowed to stay by Dean’s side. Not in the way he truly wished to be, of course, but perhaps as a friend.
“Hello, Eileen.” He shuffles fully into the kitchen and takes a seat opposite her. “I was hungry,” he admits.
“I know.” Jack’s eyes are a little watery as he pulls away from Cas, and Dean feels an answering lump form in his own throat.
“You shut up and listen!” Bobby snaps, actual heat in his voice. “This isn’t some stupid werewolf or a wendigo or something that’s driven by instinct. These are demons. They’re smart, ancient, and they don’t give a piss about humans or anything else, and there’s precious few ways to hurt them. You can exorcise them and send them back to hell, but they’re not going to stand there quietly while you do it.”
All in all, it's the most luxurious place Dean’s stayed in (it’s luxurious for normal people who don’t spend an inordinate amount of their time either squatting in abandoned houses, or shelling out $50 for a night’s stay at a no-tell motel, so for him it’s like a damn palace), but the sight of the bed fills him with dread. He drops his bag to the ground and turns to Cas.
“So you think if I troll around the courthouse and the people who are following the trial, I might be able to nab this kid?”
Jess pauses to consider. “I know that salt and holy water are big no-no’s for demons, but those hurt the host too. Is there any way to hurt the demon without hurting the host?” Jess swallows. “Brady… He’s a friend. I don’t want to injure him if we don’t have to.”
“Well, shit.” Aggie sounds almost impressed. “That’s a complicated little tangle of lies. What are you going to do about it?”
“No, I’ll try and win just so I can stop that sass,” Dean bickers back. He shoves his foot into Castiel’s shin and grins around another mouthful.
Hannah knocks on the door to Novak’s office before she swings it open. “Castiel. Dinner’s here.”
Jess’ hand falls out of Sam’s as he looks around. “You hear that too, right?” he asks.
Dean snorts. “Big surprise.” He can practically feel Castiel bristle next to him. Sam, who’s hunched over his laptop in front of the desk by the kitchen door, clears his throat pointedly. Not in the mood to apologize, Dean plows on instead. “So why’d you figure it’s Sam and Jess being targeted here? There’s, what, twenty people living in this building? Could be any of them.”
“Oh, I’m sorry, princess, are you afraid you’re going to break a nail if you do some heavy lifting?” Bobby’s voice is thick with sarcasm. “It ain’t like you have to read any of this. Besides, you wanna stay here rent free and eat me out of house and home, you’d better do something to earn your keep.”
“Honey, stop bothering the nice woman about your car, all right?” Cas’ fingers, which have been masquerading as flesh and blood, but which are really ten pieces of titanium, close around the crook of his elbow. “I’m sure it’ll be fine.” He starts tugging Dean towards the door. “Honestly, I think he loves his car more than me!”
“What?” Castiel wheezes. Horror floods his body as his brain starts to put together the implications, but he can’t… It’s not real. It’s not.
,” she says. Without looking, she reaches out towards Dean, closing her fingers.
, and then he starts to catch specific details. He spies what looks like a tennis court and a small amphitheatre. A wide pavilion is next. It’s ringed by several gazebos, beyond which, Dean catches teasing little glimpses of clear, blue water. Interspersed between trees are the cabins, all of which have sidewalks leading up to the front doors.
Jess pulls up a single shoulder in a lackluster shrug. “It’s fine,” she says noncommittally. “It’s… You know.”
notice that the skimpy black tank top she’s wearing makes her boobs look nice, goddammit. “Ash is a fucking genius.”
“Cas--Steven’s the same way,” Dean confides. “First day here, I think we hiked about five miles.”
Reluctantly, Dean nods, and he starts to drive. This time, it takes them mere moments to make it back to the clearing where the Roadhouse sits. Dean could swear it took longer than this to get to the bridge, but it’s hard to tell. And, like Bobby said, time up here is different.
Once he arrives at work, he goes through his morning routines. He boots up his computer while checking through his paperwork, making sure that nothing new landed on his desk while he wasn’t looking. He ignores the calls from those who wish him less than well asking how his babysitting gig is going. He makes sure that Kevin Tran’s face hasn’t gotten pinged on any alarms and does the same for Linda Tran as well as the ever elusive Edgar.
Jack’s cheerful voice cuts through that pleasant train of thought. “Well, who’s ready for lunch?”
“That’s how it’s supposed to work, yeah.” Zoe’s eyes are soft as she looks at him. “You’d be surprised how many people come here in the last gasps of their relationships. They’re trying to recapture the spark or reconnect without the pressures of their outside lives, or whatever desperate people try to do when they don’t want to admit that it’s over. It’s pathetic to see these people who hate each other trying to pretend that they’re still in love. But you guys… Even last night, when you were fighting, I could tell how much you cared about him.”
Three hours later, Dean is willing to amend his hasty declaration. Sleeping on this couch might not be the worst thing he’s ever done, but it would at least crack his Top 100 list of ‘Terrible Things Which Dean Winchester Has Endured’.
Cas is capable of. He’s only seen Cas look like that…
Cas casts him a disgruntled look as he takes his place in the passenger seat. “You have no respect for modest, hard-working cars.”
Ignoring Sam’s irritated huffs in his direction, Dean reaches for the gun tucked at his own waistband. From his vantage point of standing behind Dean, Castiel is witness to the glimpse of pale skin revealed when Dean accidentally untucks his shirt. Feeling as though his mouth has been filled with sand, Castiel swallows, and tries not to notice how Dean’s stance reveals the bow in his legs to a truly obscene degree. Or how the slightly too-large leather jacket does nothing to diminish either the broadness of his shoulders or the narrowness of his hips. When he shifts, suddenly uncomfortable with his position behind Dean, Castiel then tries not to notice how Dean’s forehead furrows in concentration or how his lower lip pouts slightly until he squeezes the trigger.
to work.
Panic grips his chest as he thinks about his father walking away from him. The part of him that’s eternally eight years old and desperate for his father’s approval wails and begs to throw himself down at John’s feet and beg for mercy.
is elegantly simple, with a plain wooden board in front of a long driveway. The background of the sign is painted a creamy, soothing, white, while the letters are painted gold. Majestic oaks line either side of the drive. Something in Dean scoffs at the sight, but some other part of him yearns for the world that sign promises.
Jess listens to Cas outline a vague plan. It sounds good, but she’s rusty. What she needs is an outside perspective.
The elevator moves swiftly, as it always does. The first time it zoomed towards the sky, Dean’s stomach had lurched, half of it left on the ground as the rest of it hurtled upwards. Just like the rest of the building, Dean doesn’t think he’ll ever fully adjust to it, but he does the best he can. After a few seconds, the elevator stops at the top floor, and opens into a small foyer. There are only three apartments at this level, and the unit he shares with Cas is the first. The key turns smoothly in the lock, and he walks into the apartment which has been his home for the past two years.
“Yeah,” Jess says, looking out the window at a pair of grain silos flashing past. “Could be nothing.”
Her good mood vanished, Jess leaves the kitchen to head back towards Sam. It seems as though their moment of peace is over. Now, it’s time for war.
Cas doesn’t tell him a lot, these days. In the past few weeks, Cas has become distant and strange. More often than not, Dean’s found him lost in thought, staring into space and chewing on his thumbnail. Dean practically had to shout to get his attention the other day, and Cas startled out of his thoughts so violently that he almost ended up smacking Dean in the face. Cas is always hyperalert. Catching him unawares makes Dean wrong-footed and uneasy, and the feeling never disappears.
think I’m insane — but please just listen to me, alright? My name is Ava Wilson, and I’m from Peoria, and I think you’re in danger.”
Sam slumps. Only Eileen’s presence at his side keeps him from collapsing entirely. This is it then. If Amara won’t help them, he’s lost Dean forever.
Sam sits down in the spot Cas just vacated and twists off the cap on two bottles, offering one to Dean, who eyes it with open suspicion. “Holy shit, Sammy. Never knew you to drink with me unless it was a special occasion or someone died.” A brief flash of alarm crosses his face. “Wait, no one died, right?”
Sam moves, though whether it’s to pull Eileen off of Ruby or to help her is anyone’s guess, but before he has to decide, Eileen is thrown backward.
“And you never will,” Jo answers, false sweetness dripping from every word. She turns to Jess. Her bright grin is equal parts friendly and terrifying. “So, yeah! If you want to borrow one… Well, you can’t, but, you know, it’s the thought that counts.”
“I’ll come too,” Jess says. “This was my lead. I want to follow up on it.”
She trades a glance with Pamela, and the two of them grin as one.
“Where is it?” she asks, her voice raspy and used-up in the way old people’s voices often are, but sharp and attentive too.
Sam has texted him the address of an intersection in one of the outlying neighborhoods, the press of cars apparently too dense to make it further into the city. Castiel supposes it doesn’t matter where they go, because the end of their story will find them anywhere.
worth a try.”
He wants to stay here, wants to tease Cas about his cooking, wants to help their kids do their homework. Wants to see the heat in Cas’ eyes as he turns and his eyes take in the whole of Dean’s body.
“Hi,” Dean says back. Cas’ fingers twitch against his. Without really thinking, without daring to breathe, Dean tentatively opens his fingers, leaving enough space for Cas’ fingers to slide into the spaces between.
Castiel smiles at the memory of the incensed farmer showing up on their doorstep, brandishing a pair of paper wings tied together with string.
“I’m hungry. Am I allowed to go out for food?”
“You always were the best hacker in the family, Sammy. Let’s see if you’ve still got it.”
Two pairs of eyes snap to Sam. Dean’s are filled with furious betrayal, Cas’ with frustrated confusion. Sam ignores them both, rolling his own eyes to the ceiling. “Yeah, look, I’m sorry to cut in your drama or whatever, and I’m sure that you two could keep this up for another three weeks, but I value my sanity. Dean, nut up and tell Cas you don’t speak Enochian. Cas, stop running into a brick wall and tell him what you want. I mean, good God, it’s like I have to do everything around here myself!”
Bobby smiles at him from the porch of the other version. “Heaven ain’t just reliving your golden oldies anymore,” he says, toasting Dean with his beer. “It’s what it always should have been. Everyone happy. Everyone together.”
“Sam,” Eileen finally asks, her eyes dipping down for a moment before she focuses back on him. “Where’s Dean?”
“Don’t argue with him sweetie, you know that you’re only going to lose.” She plants a sloppy kiss to Sam’s cheek, with a kind of casual intimacy that causes something in Castiel’s chest to tighten. “Hi Cas. Is Dean being awful yet?”
been working out more. Through trial and error, he’s discovered that physical exhaustion has the side effect of making his mind too weak to spiral, so he’s been spending long hours at the gym, shadowing boxing until his arms are weak noodles. He’s run through the parks of the city so many times that he now has a running tally of his favorite bushes.
“That question’s a trap if I ever saw one." Dean tries to ignore how his leg is tingling where Cas touched it. God, he’s pathetic. “But I guess we better add Cas Harvelle being a fool to that list you made.”
Dean twists to keep her from yanking the phone out of his hand. He ignores the dull pain of Jess’ fingers digging into his elbow, and snaps, “Sam? Answer me right now. Are you hurt?”
It’s all somehow too close to spill those details out to Sam. Castiel feels an oddly possessive urge to protect those moments and shield them from the outside world. They’re
“Has anyone seen Jess this morning? Ash?”
“To meet up with Jess and your brother,” Castiel says flatly.
His body takes hit after hit, but he barely acknowledges the pain. He can’t, not if he wants to survive. He thinks he feels Cas next to him, but in the melee, it’s difficult to tell. He grunts as a fist strikes his ribs. Pain lances through him, and he drops to a single knee.
To be that close...to be that close and not be allowed to touch...Dean wants to refuse. He should refuse. But Cas also thinks that he’s his husband, and from what Dean has seen, Cas’ husband would never refuse a request such as this.
Dean falls into step beside Cas as they head to the backyard of the farmhouse, where Bobby and Rufus have laid out an impressive arsenal of guns and knives. Ava, Scott, Max and Andy are eyeing it with expressions ranging from eager to wary. Jo is there too, arms wound around Ava’s waist from behind, chin tucked over her shoulder. Dean wonders vaguely when the hell
“Dad?”
Almost unconsciously, Castiel draws a breath into his chest, and another. His muscles tense. The voice sounds staticky, like a badly tuned radio, but it’s unmistakably Dean.
“Brady lost a few years of his life, and that sucks, but he’s still alive.
When Meg finally sets the crop aside, Castiel is shaking. While he’s no longer suffering from the pain of a potential spiral, his clarity lacks the comfort of absolution which Dean could give him. Instead, it’s sharp and focused, bright and unyielding. It leaves Castiel feeling cold and dazed, even as Meg works lotion and antiseptic into his skin.
Rejection zings through Dean, quick and vicious. He turns away before Cas can see it on his face. “Yeah, sure. I’ll take mine tonight then.”
“Look, if I knew what to do about any of it, I’d tell you.” Outside the window, a green road sign flashes by. Twenty miles to Omaha. “But I don’t. Jess and I are out of sync, and I don’t know how to fix it, or even if I want to. I have no idea what’s going on with the vision thing, or how to fix that either. Basically, I can’t do a damn thing. So I’m just trying to get out of my own head for a day or two and spend some time with my brother. Is that so hard to understand?”
Too bad his bravado is all for nothing.
Cas’ immediate expression of annoyance smooths to one of polite neutrality once he sees the identity of his visitor. “To what do we owe the visit?” he asks, voice stiff and wooden.
“Time to nut up or shut up, guys,” Jess taunts as she walks up to the firing line drawn in chalk on the ground. She holds her gun like it’s an extension of her arm, and when she swings around to face the targets, her body settles easily into her stance.
“Why should I believe a single thing that comes out of your mouth?” Dean snaps. “Not like you exactly got a history of being trustworthy.”
No, every one of his instincts is screaming at him that these threats are legitimate. Worse yet, that the person behind them means exactly what they say: That tomorrow is the day that it all comes together.
He doesn’t share his family’s sob story with outsiders, not ever. The only people who know are people who saw it play out, like Bobby and other friends of his dad’s who came and went over the years. The one time he tried, with Cassie, it all went spectacularly wrong.
~*~*~*~*~*
The lump Dean’s been trying to swallow down for the past twenty-four hours rears its ugly head once more. It’s lodged right at the base of his throat, which turns previously simple tasks, such as eating and breathing, into Olympian feats of strength. Every time he twists in his covers, he can remember exactly how Cas’ warm weight felt pressed atop him. He remembers the slack look of trust and peace on Cas’ face as he slept, uncaring of the world around them.
The air freezes around him. Sam and Bobby’s faces distort oddly, going wavy and fuzzy at the edges. Dean shifts in alarm, but the board no longer creaks underneath his feet. Dean’s heart thumps in his chest, once, twice, and then Sam is turning to him, a vapid smile on his face.
Cas emerges from the shower a few minutes later and Sam watches, impressed, as he does a sketch of Meg’s face from memory, only asking Sam to fill in a few small blanks where his own impression of her face has faded. Then, Sam pulls out an old Winchester family photo. It’s the one he used to have framed in the living room of his Stanford apartment: all four Winchesters, alive and happy, Sam just a baby in his mother’s arms, and Dean a smiling preschooler. It’s also the only picture of his father that Sam is willing to keep around.
But less than forty-eight hours ago, I was convinced that Jack had managed to defeat Chuck and had somehow taken his place, and I’d died from a rebar to the back in a weird, mime vampire juggalo hunt.”
cared. I cared about you. I cared about Sam, I cared about Jack. I cared about the whole world, because of
So Dean does. Pretty soon, it turns out that being on the road with Castiel isn’t nearly as awkward as Dean expected it to be. (Certainly not as awkward as that time Castiel had him cuffed to his own damn car.)
“I really am sorry,” Sam says, just loudly enough to be heard above the rumble of the engine. “For not telling you about the vision. And for putting Cas in harm’s way.”
Stunned silence follows her initial statement, and Jess hurries to fill it before Aggie does. “I know you want to help, but if this fails, if we,” Jess’ voice breaks, “lose, then we’re going to need someone to be the second wave. You’re going to have to pick up where we left off.”
After a while, Sam gently wraps his fingers around Eileen’s wrist, partly for comfort, partly to grab her attention. “Dean’s baseball game is next weekend. Do we know yet if it’s going to conflict with Beth’s dance rehearsal?”
April, and then he went to heal you, but I don’t think he had enough power, and he passed out. He’s been unconscious for about thirty minutes now.”
Fuck. What did Ruby tell him?
“Whatever it is, keep playing it,” Andy says, grinning. “I haven’t felt this good since the black-eyed SOBs started getting close.”
He’d been so stupid, thinking he could have it all--Dean’s arm around his shoulder, Dean’s hands sweeping through his hair, the rough brush of Dean’s lips on his skin. Greedy and impetuous, he’d grabbed and he’d grasped and never once considered the consequences of doing so.
The barn has disappeared. In its place is an abandoned house, set in a small clearing with tangled brush pushing at the boundaries of the small piece of civilization. On a road with mingled gravel and dirt, sits in the Impala. The windows are fogged. And inside...
Jess. Dean.
Grateful for the permission, Dean ducks behind the bar. He opens the fridge and grabs whatever his hand lands on first. He’s not picky, and if Castiel had a preference, he should have specified.
It takes a bit of jiggling of the room key in the lock and a sound kick from Castiel, but eventually, the door opens, revealing a motel room much like the thousands of others where Dean’s spent most of his life. A faint whiff of sweat lingers about the place, and even from where he’s standing by the door, Dean can see a thin layer of dust covering the battered furniture.
Ever since he watched his mother burn on the ceiling when he was four, his anger has sat just a little too close to the surface. Dean knows this about himself; knows that, if he lets it, his anger will turn from a constant, low simmer of irritation into a raging brush fire he has no way of controlling.
“Great. The more the merrier.” Pamela motions for Dean to sit down opposite Sam, then touches the note with the tips of her fingers. Ava does the same.
Something crumples in Sam’s expression, and he curses quietly. “Cas, there’s something I need to tell you.”
Dean leans in to kiss Cas again, and this time, he lets it linger. He really
When Sam finally opens his eyes, he’s deathly pale. Three feet away, Ava vomits onto the grass, Jo kneeling by her side and rubbing her back.
Rage.
“Not that we owe you an explanation,” Sam says, planting a foot on the metal rung of his stool. “But Cas and his family helped us out when we first realized Azazel was after me. You know, they picked up the phone when we called? Gave us a home to come back to after a hunt? Probably hard for you to imagine anything like that.”
After he sits, there’s a tense moment. Castiel hasn’t seen Balthazar in weeks, not since he was staying in this very apartment, and he hasn’t spoken to him since the warehouse. Sam kept him informed of what Balthazar did: took April’s body from the warehouse, smoothed over matters with law enforcement, and put the Shapeshifter case firmly underneath government control. His actions have made Castiel’s life minimally easier in the past weeks, but there’s little forgiveness in Castiel’s heart. He can’t erase what Balthazar was trying to turn him into or the road of hedonism Balthazar was happy to lead him on.
“Hello, Sam,” Cas says, once he’s settled. “I can hear you. Go ahead.”
. “I used to think so too. But did you know I met her? Sam and I both did. Her spirit was trapped in our old house back in Lawrence."
He’s cut off by a sharp gesture of Cas’ hand. “No, I’m fine.” Cas stands up, and though he’s a little wobbly on his feet, he stays standing. After a few seconds, he looks stronger. “I’m not leaving Dean in there any longer than is absolutely necessary.”
“Gardening is one of Ash’s many talents,” Castiel says. His dry voice is almost more than Dean can take right now.
When he gets Cas back, he’ll tell him all of that. He’ll tell him…
He stands still, gathering the last remnants of his grace around himself, to protect his mind as best he can from the foul tang of despair that thickens the Empty’s atmosphere. As he does so, he becomes painfully aware that the spell took more grace than he could spare. If there was ever a chance of returning to Heaven to recover its full strength, that chance has now most likely passed.
Cas’ eyes flicker with barely restrained heat. He looks at Dean as though he’s a banquet, and Dean is ready to be devoured. To be looked at like that, like he’s the only thing that Cas wants… His cock hardens in his pants, pressing against the restrictive confines of his zipper.
“I’ll do it.”
Castiel signs, and takes a fry.
“I know,” Cas says, his face splitting into a wide, gummy smile. No shadow lurks behind his eyes, no hint of tears glisten in his eyes. There’s just happiness, radiant and absolute, gleaming from his face.
He blinks and then he sees a little clearer. The man advances on
, the door shut behind Dean. Castiel stared at the thin barrier of wood, his stomach sinking.
“No, I’m going with you to St. Louis,” Jess interrupts.
Dean almost swallows his tongue. Out of the corner of his eye, he sees a muscle in the corner of Cas’ jaw ticking like a metronome. “I’m sure that will be awesome,” Dean finally says, feeling like he’s gargling glass. “Thanks for your help.”
Well maybe not a kidney. But he’d definitely at least mow a lawn or something. A weekend spent LARPing (which he enjoys anyway, not that anyone other than himself and Charlie need to know that tidbit) is a small price to pay for Charlie covering up his poorly made dick-decisions.
When Sam steps into the corridor, he finds Ash, cradling a laptop in one hand and banging on Bobby’s door with the other. A carmine silk robe hangs off his shoulders, exposing his bare chest.
But as he walks away, he can’t resist a solemn nod at the FBI goons, and a cheerful, “Agent Mulder. Agent Scully.”
(See the end of the chapter for
(There’s a metaphor that Castiel is willfully ignoring.)
From what I’ve tasted of desire
He just needs… space. Just for a little while, so he can process. His own future, and Jess’, hinges on the outcome of their talk, and at this point, he doesn’t even know what he wants that future to look like.
Regretfully, he pulls away from Dean. His eyes catch a stain on the pool table, and he curses quietly. He tries to rub it away with the bottom of his shirt, but there’s still an incriminating spot on the felt.
Castiel shudders. He’s shattering, and Dean is the cause. He’s going to see what it looks like when Castiel gives in and allows himself what he wants, and he’s going to be lucky enough to pick up the pieces afterward. Castiel’s voice is small and halting when he says, “I want to obey. I want… I want to be
He didn’t say any of that, and he doesn’t say it out loud now. Instead, he keeps taking swigs from his bottle until the world goes pleasantly hazy at the edges and an awful, stupid idea occurs to him.
“I know, Bobby,” Sam says, grateful. “I’ll remember.”
a hex bag though, how did it get here?” Pamela asks. “Got a feeling this Meg chick was a little busy fighting for her life when y’all saw her last. Also, I doubt she was planning to let any of you come back here alive.”
Cas wakes slowly.
“Still hurt?” The question is unnecessary, but Castiel asks it anyway.
“Yeah. Too bad she’s with a douche.” When Cas raises a questioning eyebrow, Dean explains. “She gets herself dolled up and he slaps on some khakis and an ugly ass polo? There’s not trying, and then there’s putting
skin that tingles everywhere Dean touches it. And
“I wouldn’t have expected you to. Bill always kept to himself. He liked to work alone, and he usually just did the small hunts. Poltergeists, salt and burns, cursed objects. Sometimes, he’d want to do bigger hunts, but I’d tell him, I’d say
“I love you.”
For the next week, Dean’s days fall into a predictable routine.
“Unclench, Sam. I ain’t about to bite your head off.” With that, Bobby closes the last bit of distance between them and pulls Sam into a rough hug. When he pulls back, his hands stay on Sam’s shoulders, and penetrating brown eyes fix on his face. “Wanna tell me why you’re looking so spooked?”
“What do you think he’ll be like?” Jess asks, after they stop at a gas station to refuel and use the bathroom. She chews idly at a Twizzler and stares out the windshield. When she feels Castiel’s eyes on her, she turns in her seat to look at him. “Andy, I mean.”
Ash melts out of the corner by the staircase where he’d been sitting curled in on himself, staring at nothing. Jess doesn’t think she’s ever seen him like this: drawn and distant, no lazy smirk or mischievous twinkle in his eye.
“What makes you think the gun Elkins mentioned is the same as the Colt?” Jess asks.
He manages to find a blanket to wrap around Cas’ shoulders. It will do until they get out to the car where he has a spare set of clothes. For now, he helps Cas to his feet. Cas looks around him, his eyes wide and huge, as though he’s overwhelmed with the world around him.
“I am,” Castiel answers, and because that sounds short and peevish even to his ears, he adds, “You’re looking better.”
Cas groans into his mouth, nipping at his lower lip in punishment. “Dean,” he says, low and hoarse like he’s gargling gravel. “Dean, it’s all right.”
“Dean doesn’t understand Enochian, Cas!” he shouts.
It’s clear what Ellen is implying, and even a few days ago, her words would have sent Dean into a spiral of panic and denial. Now, with fear for Cas churning through every part of him, he just can’t spare the energy.
“I know,” Eileen answers. It’s all she needs to say.
“Novak--”
They argue back and forth another few minutes, but eventually, Castiel goes to retrieve the journal from the trunk, and Sam buries himself in a stack of maps to try to pinpoint the coordinates. It doesn’t take him long to find the place: Blackwater Ridge, Colorado.
Azazel stands just beyond the outer reach of their wardings, Ansem's lips pulled into a rictus grin. “I’ll give you one last chance, folks,” he sing-songs. “Come with me willingly, join my army, and I’ll let you live. Might even let your loved ones keep a few of their limbs if I’m feeling charitable. If not… my children and I are going to attack.”
It must be the cold making Dean’s eyes sparkle as he looks Castiel up and down. “Your turn. Show me what you’ve got.”
you here?”
in his chest, and his grip on Cas’ shoulder tightens.
“Anyway,” Dean says, wiping the sheen of sweat from his forehead, “when he left, he said he was getting out of the game. And here he is, very much not out of the game.”
Time moves in strange, hazy leaps after that. Castiel knows that Meg takes him in hand, easily and efficiently. She leads him back to the bedroom, one hand on the back of his neck like a promise, and from there, directs him to strip. He waits for her next instruction, numb and trembling. His penis is limp; his heart stutters every few beats as it threatens immolation.
“Can it be a big deal to me?”
, he signs as he pulls back.
Behind him, Sam’s voice falters, stumbling over the Latin, before he continues. The syllables come fast and furious as gnats swarming. With every word, Dean can feel the world solidifying once more, becoming stable underneath his feet.
Naomi’s eyebrows raise in silent acknowledgement when she sees him sitting at the bar. She doesn’t come to him. Of course she doesn’t. Instead, she murmurs a quiet word to the maitre’d, who then escorts her to a table. She sits, skirt folded neatly under her thighs, her legs making a perfect 90 degree angle to the floor. Her hands rest flat on the table, one over the other as she stares ahead with a serene expression on her face. Castiel’s glower goes either unnoticed or unacknowledged.
Once Cas is fully seated, he’s done being careful. In a single, smooth movement, he pulls out and slams back in, setting a punishing pace. Dean groans and pants helplessly, his knuckles white around the headboard as he holds on for dear life.
“Elkins said it was passed down from one hunter to the next, and that it had five special bullets to go with it,” Castiel says. “He said he took it off a dead hunter in the ‘70s and had kept it ever since.”
of Jericho.”
Dean ignores her, which is as good as an answer. “There’s no future,” he finally says, his voice harsh. “I’m just some dumbass dropout fuck-up who’s gonna be lucky to make it to thirty, let alone have a job. There’s no reason why I should make Cassie or anyone else put up with me. I’m just gonna do my fucking job as well as I can for as long as I can.”
“No, it’s crap,” Dean says. Bobby chuckles, and Dean’s lips curl up as he remembers that night, sitting on the Impala’s hood with his father while Sam slept in the back seat. One of the few truly good memories the two of them made together. “But it was fantastic.”
“He—” The words are stuck in Castiel’s throat; a biological impossibility, and yet, a fact. With a supreme effort, he forces them out. “He’s gone.”
At least I had the decency to tell you that my family wasn’t one that you wanted to meet, but you just kept on making excuses for why I couldn’t meet yours.”
It feels like being tugged through quicksand, the Empty finally realizing that something is wrong and seizing onto him. Darkness covers him, and Castiel can’t see anything, can’t scream, can’t hear. All he knows is the strength of the grip around his hand, the fierce flare of hope in his chest even amidst the ripping pain.
Sam studies the list, then turns to Eileen. “We should have all that in the storage cabinet, third door down the hall from the kitchen.”
They’re very green, Dean’s eyes, Castiel notices as he sits, and then hates himself for noticing.
he’s a hunter.” She sounds surprised, but it’s not a question.
Relief and something approaching fondness bursts in Dean’s chest. Seeing Cas there, waiting for him, soothes the still-raw wound of Dad’s departure, and for the first time since he encountered the empty room, he feels like he can finally breathe. A smile tugs at the corners of Dean’s lips, and he tries to suppress it. Cas lets out a little snore, his body jolting with the force of it. Dean’s smile spreads across his face, and after a moment’s futile battle, he allows it. It’s not as if anyone’s here to witness it.
Bobby’s voice is like a pinprick of logic in the overwhelming darkness of battle. Dean nods, but then his thoughts are interrupted by a blur of motion.
“You remember that time Sam insisted it was a wraith, but you and I were determined that we were going to find a ghost?” Cas asks, talking about the piece of broccoli in his mouth.
“’Cause you got to go off with Dad on hunts, and he taught you everything he knew. That’s what
For a second, nothing happens, and Dean fights the urge to rip Ciara’s hand away from Cas’ skin. He stops himself when his eyes catch the gentle glow spreading from Ciara’s fingertips and onto Cas’ skin. Small tendrils of gold thread over Castiel’s skin, and in their wake…
With three hours to go until the end of Azazel’s ultimatum, the Roadhouse has become a command center. A table by the door holds ammunition belts loaded with salt rounds; another creaks under piles of shotguns and handguns. Maps are spread across another, and lore books litter the top of the bar.
But what if he
Dean bites his lip. While he wants to grab credit, he also doesn’t want to look like the Researcher Extraordinaire, only to fall flat on his face a few weeks later. “I had a tip,” he finally says. “Some other hunter was already in town. He must have been working the same case. He said to check if the victims had damaged pituitary glands, and they did.”
Zoe licks a stripe up Dean’s neck. A shudder of revulsion shakes through him, and he narrowly avoids retching. “So, what?” he pants, trying to distract himself from the bile churning in his stomach. “This is some kind of
“We’ll find Cas before the three days are up, save him, kill that demon bitch. There. Made your plan.” Jo’s voice is hard as flint, her fingers wrapped around the handle of her knife like a lifeline. Before anyone else can speak, she slams her palm down on the table, the sound as loud and startling as a gunshot in the tense atmosphere. “Fuck. First Dad and now Cas. That’s what we get, right, for letting fucking
Though Dean hasn’t said anything out of the ordinary, Castiel still looks like he wants to bolt. His hands are jittery, his fingers unable to remain still for longer than a few seconds at a time. His eyes dart from Dean’s lips, down to his hands, and then back up.
It’s an overwhelmingly quiet afternoon. It’s nice, because Dean loves to spend time with Cas when there’s no imminent blood or monsters on their horizons, but it’s also
Or getting ready for battle.
“You should go home.”
Silence follows Meg’s words until, almost simultaneously, they burst into loud peals of laughter.
“Just, uh, need the bathroom. I’ll be right back.”
Dean can’t even lie to himself anymore. It might have started out as hate-sex, as a way for them both to release some of their mutual tension, but that’s not what it is anymore. Somewhere along the way, whether it was between the late dinners, the trips to the shooting range to improve Cas’ aim (Cas can manage to shoot a gun without breaking his shoulder, which Dean considers a huge accomplishment), or yeah, in between all the fucking, Dean Winchester went and fell hard for the man who he’s supposed to be able regard as nothing more than a job.
“You can’t,” Castiel says through gritted teeth, as he sees his last hope for rescuing Dean slip away from him.
“Thing is, John Winchester might have been a good dad at one point, but that all died when Mary Winchester did. After that, he was raising soldiers, not sons, and Dean bore the brunt of it.”
Dean’s laughter slowly subsides to a quiet chuckle. Eventually, he straightens up, eyes narrowing as he looks at Castiel. “Back to the point. Who the fuck are
Let Dean Winchester and his brother do whatever the hell they want. The only reason Castiel cares about any of this is because he needs Sam. Rather, he needs Sam’s connection to Azazel if he wants to find the demon that ended his childhood on a blood-soaked floor, fifteen years ago.
. Being there like that, having our emotions feed on each other… It wasn’t good. For either of us.”
It was as perfect as Castiel could make it; down to the Impala sitting in the Roadhouse’s parking lot. He created every inch of Dean’s Heaven in homage, in apology.
Castiel feels it before he knows what’s happening. It’s a rift, a tear, something which ripples throughout the universe and comes to hit him in the chest. He staggers backward, hand clutching at his shirt.
Cas looks at him and for a moment his face reflects the same horror that Dean feels while trapped inside the crypt. Then the expression is gone as though it never existed, leaving Cas’ face with the oddly superficial blankness that sends a shudder of revulsion trickling down his spine.
kind of weird.” There’s a particular inflection she puts on the word
He pushes all thoughts of Jess and shifters, radio-silent brothers and missing fathers to the side as he homes in on the demon’s inkwell eyes. After a few moments, he could swear he sees something moving beyond the impenetrable wall of black: dirty, viscous smoke, curling and winding around the woman’s skull, writhing through her veins. Abruptly, he becomes aware that one of his arms has risen, the hand reaching out towards the demon, fingers twisting as though he can physically yank the contamination from the woman’s body.
“No,” Jack says. His eyes close as his fingers touch Cas’ forehead. “But I can feel...something.” Dean sees the furrow of worry on Jack’s forehead, ignores it. He forces a relentless sort of optimism on himself, the kind that would feel painful if it were called anything else.
“Don’t be ridiculous.” Sam’s tone is the exact kind of prissy guaranteed to piss Dean off. “It’s easier to start with a baby blanket.” Dean rolls his eyes towards the ceiling. “Anyway, I just finished my morning run and I’ve got a few hours before Jess wakes up, so I’m sure I have plenty of time for dealing with your trauma. Shoot.”
Time slows down into separate seconds, unconnected to each other. Each exists in its separate bubble of agony and realization. Dean is gone. Dean was
“He’s still alive,” Sam croaks. “Brady’s alive.”
As soon as the door closes behind him, Jess kills the light and turns over, facing the wall.
“Dean.” Cas places a soft hand to his cheek. “Dean, you’re shaking. What’s wrong?”
“Dean?”
The bell on the door jingles a cheery tune completely at odds with his dark mood as he storms outside. He paces around the edges of the parking lot, breathing in the air that smells like grease and stale cigarette smoke. That’s where Cas finds him a few minutes later.
Just as Dean starts plating two servings of perfectly crisped bacon and outrageously fluffy eggs, the front door opens again, and Sam walks into the kitchen, looking just as worn out as Castiel feels. “Oh. Hey, guys.”
With a final glower at Castiel’s back, Dean follows Jo and the others out the door.
“I made a few good investments on the stock market, sold while it was hot, and bought the land,” Ash explained when he broke the news, shrugging like playing stocks was no big deal. “Now feels like the right time to do something with it.”
Max is standing by the door, frozen in place. When Jess’ eyes meet his, a flash of fear crosses his expression. A particularly heavy thump draws Jess’ attention back to Sam. She experiences a moment of despair as she takes in the purplish color of his face, the way his legs have gone completely still.
“In a regular contract, you and I would have already negotiated limits and kinks. I would know what interested you and how far you were willing to be pushed. You would know what I expected of you, and how I would punish and reward you.”
This time, Cas’ sigh is tinted with frustration. “With all of these omens gathering, that's impossible. Maybe there was a professor, asking strange questions? A friend acting differently? Hell, a neighbor lurking in the doorway for a second too long?”
Pamela’s voice is soft and kind. “You had to have someone put you under?”
In the distance, he hears the sound of an engine revving and tires screeching against wet pavement. At that point, his stomach clenches. He has just a moment’s warning, something hot and sour rushing up his throat, before he sprints to the toilet. He retches into the bowl and winces at the wet splash echoing through the tiny room.
It does him no good: the bunker, for all its space, is only so large in the end, and Cas was once a heavenly messenger who has the patience of millennia. Add that to the fact that Dean needs to eat at least twice a day, and the game of
“You’re welcome to test us with silver and holy water first, of course,” Cas adds.
Mary's spectral hand brushes across his. Castiel gasps as a wealth of emotion and memory flood through him. He sees a flash of a red, squalling baby, and then a chubby toddler just beginning to walk. He senses loss and loneliness, but above all else, the
An eternity passes in the second before Cas’ hand shifts and his fingers wrap around the back of Dean’s hand. Cas squeezes and galaxies erupt in Dean’s chest.
“We can go back to my place,” Cassie says. Her eyes dart furtively to Dean, but he’s busy checking his phone. He only looks at it for a second, but his frown tells Jess that he doesn't find what he's looking for. Jess is irresistibly reminded of someone who's waiting for their crush to text.
“Well, lucky you ended up in here. You can help me bus some of these tables. If you work really hard, Cas might give you a beer at the end of the night.”
Sam blinks hard, trying to dispel the fog hovering in his vision, but it stays put, leading Sam to conclude that the fog is real. Also real is Jess, tied to the tree next to his. There’s a trail of dried blood down the side of her face, but her eyes are clear and full of concern for him.
Time passes. Eventually, Dean acknowledges that he’s crossed the line from being contemplative and has now moved into wallowing territory. He pushes away from the tree and starts down the path. He only makes it a few steps before he stops. He doesn’t recognize this part of the resort, which is weird. He’d thought that he and Cas had traversed every part of the resort, but they seem to have missed this particular section. The hair on the back of Dean’s neck prickles. While he’s not lost, it doesn’t mean that he’s comfortable.
He lives every second of terror as Meg wears his face and plunges his arm into Dean’s chest. He sees the light go out in Dean’s eyes, as a thin tendril of blood dribbles from the corner of his mouth. “Cas,” is the last thing Dean says before he crumples to the ground.
card, but he’s stopped by a cool, clear voice calling down the hallway.
“Kind of.”
Bobby tosses his shot back and holds the glass out for more, never taking his eyes off of Castiel. Castiel refills Bobby’s glass, and under the old hunter’s watchful eyes, he drinks his shot. He’s not a lightweight, by any means (a naturally high tolerance and growing up in a bar both contribute heavily to that fact), but the whiskey is strong, and he can already feel a telltale tingling in the tips of his fingers.
Startled, Dean jerks. The Impala swerves, but manages to stay on the road. “Jesus,” he curses softly. “I thought you were asleep.”
“Fuck him,” Dean says, with a reckless sense of glee. “Come on, Cas,” he urges. On a whim, before he can stop himself, he reaches out to tug at Cas’ wrist, pulling him out of the kitchen. He looks to the speakers, mostly so he can pretend he didn’t see the swift flash of surprise in Cas’ eyes (it’s surprise, it has to be, what else could it be other than surprise), as he leads him to the living area. A quick shove of his toe sends their coffee table sliding a few inches across the floor, leaving behind another lovely scratch in the hardwood.
After another moment’s deliberation, Castiel takes out the Colt and loads three bullets into the chamber. He leaves the other two nestled in the box: one for Azazel, and one for the demon who killed Castiel’s family, should their paths ever cross.
It’s almost dinnertime by now, and Castiel really wishes they’d thought to stop for food on the way to the motel. Calling around for delivery seems like too big a risk, so he chokes down a protein bar from his duffel and keeps an eye on the windows. He really wants a cigarette, but it’s a non-smoking room and he doesn’t want to chance going outside.
“It’ll have to be. I don’t know anything else.” Jess' throat grows thick with emotion. For a moment, she wants nothing more than to run to her big sister, who always seems to be able to solve every problem.
, but then Cas kisses along his jaw, and Dean loses himself. He twists his fingers in Cas’ hair, trying to hold on as Cas works his way down his chest. He kisses along Dean’s ribs and stomach, nipping at his hips and running his fingers along the dip of his waist.
Sam smiles, his eyes glassy. “I’ll call you when I get there.”
They find Ciara at a gazebo on the shores of the lake. Foxglove flowers sprout around the edges of the gazebo, interspersed with the white flowers which Sam identified as columbine. Ciara’s gaze is fixed on the lake, and her face is troubled. One finger traces a design over the grain of the wood. The hair on the back of Dean’s neck rises as he watches her. He’s transfixed, at least until Cas steps forward, his gun focused on Ciara.
“You wanna take that bet?” Sam asks, already yanking the steering wheel hard to the left. The tires squeal against the pavement as the truck wobbles precariously, but it rights itself and they’re tearing down the street. Jess punches at her phone, trying to look up the address while Sam weaves through traffic.
Within a few short moments, they’re led to a small table. Dean, who finds the heat no more tolerable than before, sinks into his seat. As though it’s a point of pride, Cas remains unaffected by the weather. Dean doesn’t even think he’s sweating. The beer that Dean orders tastes delicious, cool and crisp, and he kills the neck in a single, desperate gulp.
As he walks further into the building and down the line of bedrooms, he hears voices and snatches of laughter, light spilling out from under the doors in small golden puddles across the linoleum floor.
“This is going to be one of those things that sounds worse than it actually is, so I’m going to need you not to freak out until I’m done, alright?” Storm clouds gather on Dean’s face, so Sam speaks quickly. “So about a month ago, I started having really weird dreams. They showed me the same thing all the time: I dreamed that Jess was dying; burning up on the ceiling, the same way Mom did.”
Dean’s eyes widen. “Okay, if you’re suggesting that Sam should—”
Sam knows he owes Ruby nothing, but maybe that’s not what this is about. Maybe it’s about proving to himself that he’s more than the darkness inside him; about moving past old hurts so he can hold on tight to his happiness in the present.
Just read the tags, loves. Everything is possible.
“Every single day, I saw it. A little bit more of the man I loved was slipping away, and I couldn’t… I couldn’t stay and watch that. I couldn’t watch what we had die.”
“What do you mean?” Jess asks, pulling up a box of her own.
Nightmares used to be a staple of his life; horrible, screaming things that would wake the whole house and send Ellen and Bill scrambling to his side. After a while, however, they subsided into an occasional torment. Now, they’ve started up again.
“Off,” Dean grunts, ripping his mouth away from Cas’ long enough to make his wishes known. He tugs at the lapels of Cas’ jacket to make his wishes clear, and then kisses the smirk off Cas’ lips.
Cold fear curls around Castiel’s heart. He knows Dean isn’t his to have, not in the way he truly wants, but he’s grown so used to being able to see him and talk to him. The thought that, even now, Dean might choose John Winchester over him is devastating. And yet.
When the front door closes behind Rufus and Ash, Jess chances a glance at Dean. He’s collapsed into a chair between her and Bobby, across the table from where Ellen and Pamela are sitting. His face is a mask, eyes huge and glassy. He’s still clutching his phone close to his chest.
The world stretches before him, intimidating in its infiniteness. He and Sam can go anywhere,
“Oh yeah?” Dean’s hands are clenched, knuckles white, fingernails digging into his palm. “Sam figure in there at all?”
“Fine, be like that,” Dean says, with all the dignity he can muster (not much, but it’ll have to do). “I’ll figure it out. You just watch. When you least expect it, I’m coming back at you with the right answer.”
, so if you could stop attempting to seduce the bartender, that would be nice! Asking questions about dead bodies is hard enough. It gets harder when everyone thinks you’re cheating on me!”
Once I’ve finished scarfing down a Danish, I ask Castiel how he built Novak Enterprises Inc. from the ground up. Castiel smiles, but it’s the smile of someone who’s heard this question too many times and is no more comfortable with it the hundredth time than he was the first time. “You’re referring to the transition of power between my uncle and myself?”
It wasn’t fair. Dean deserved to live to a ripe old age. He deserved to enjoy the world for which he fought so hard. He should have grown old, should have found peace, should have discovered the foibles and pitfalls of normal, human existence. Dean worked too hard, for too long, and he deserved a kinder, softer fate. Instead, he’s here, and all Castiel can do for him is to craft his Heaven with painstaking care.
, he thinks. Just as before, the clearing appears out of nowhere in front of him, just a few hundred yards away. He falls into a run, ignoring the panicked beating of his heart.
“Can you stop?”
“A doppelganger,” Becky says the next morning. She blinks slowly, and her face is a roadmap of disbelief. “You think that my brother has a doppelganger who killed his girlfriend.”
But Dean also has experience on his side, as well as a gut instinct that hasn’t let him down yet. And his gut tells him that there’s more to these threats than just routine intimidation. They’re too specific, too perfect, too tailored. They’ve gone into too much detail about Castiel’s routine, who he’s close to, his potential weaknesses. At first they went after Hannah and Cas' brother. Then, they went after Jo. Now, they’ve targeted Dean.
This time, when Dean and Cas enter into his house, they do so hand in hand, together.
After that, he stumbles back to the annex through the freezing night air. Next to him, Sam and Jess are obviously just as exhausted. Dean considers just falling into bed without worrying about anything else, but he’s sore, smelly, and covered in blood and grime. All things considered, he’d rather sleep clean.
It’s not fair to take out his aggravation on Cas. It’s not Cas’ fault that Dean’s incapable of focusing. It’s definitely not Cas’ fault that Dean’s been holding a torch for years and it’s only just now started to throw off some heat. But once he’s released his pissiness he can’t take it back. All that’s left is flop down into Cas’ squashy armchair, arms folded petulantly over his chest. Cas, demonstrating much more maturity than Dean, turns his chair back towards his computer. After a few seconds, the sounds of typing fill the room. Dean allows himself to become lulled by the sound, so that when Cas speaks and breaks the silence, it’s a surprise.
“But Sam has a point, too,” Jess says, and this time, Sam is the one who looks slack-jawed. “We can’t go up against a potential army of demons with one gun and five bullets. We need options.”
), but now he finds it comforting. He gets antsy if he stays in one place too long, with the weight of everything he doesn’t have pressing down on his shoulders. As his laptop reluctantly putters to life, Dean tries to ignore the discontent nipping at his heels.
When he walks in the door, Kelly’s head lifts up from the book she’s flipping through. Her smile is a balm to the hurt places inside him, the ones that he likes to pretend don’t exist, because he was happy, yes? That was the whole point of everything, was to be happy. “Hey, Cas,” she greets him, shifting over and patting the couch next to her. “I was wondering when you’d be by.”
But Sam never quite learned how to leave well enough alone, especially when it comes to his brother, so he asks one more time, just to be sure. “You’re really alright with us leaving?”
Her fingers punch at Sam’s name and she listens to the phone ring several times. “Come on, Sam,” she curses, tapping her foot anxiously. “Pick up, pick up, pick up.”
Dean blushes, the tips of his ears turning red. “Yeah. I mean. If you wanted. And if you didn’t want, that’s fine, because i know you said once that angels didn’t–”
He shrugs and forces his mouth wider, until his cheeks hurt with the force of his false smile. “Feeling better now.” He doesn’t miss the slow sideways slide of Cas’ eyes to the bottle on the couch. Dean tries to shift and block Cas’ view without making it obvious. He doesn’t want to talk about it or see the thin slice of worry in Cas’ eyes.
Right now, though, that mystery is the farthest thing from Dean’s mind as Cas’ lips open to his tongue with a small moan, and then—
“Uh-huh.” Dean’s not wholly convinced. Castiel is brilliant; there’s no way that he isn’t playing at least three different angles with this request. But Dean can’t puzzle it out of him, and besides, would it really be such a terrible thing? They’re in the range, which was built for safety, and Dean is nothing if not an expert in firearms. What trouble could Castiel really get himself into?
Sam thinks that Cas is going to need more than a second, but he keeps that opinion to himself. Instead, he sets up the ingredients of the spell. Rowena’s voice echoes in his head, reminding him that
looks at you.”
Dean bolts upright, gasping for air. Coming out of a dreamroot sleep is always brutal, like being shoved off the top of a bunk bed. He scrubs at his mouth, trying to rub away the lingering taste.
Dean squints at his brother. “All right, what aren’t you telling me?”
“I promise, I’ll eat actual food tonight,” Castiel says. “I just need to finish this paperwork before I leave. Oh, and Hannah?” Castiel pulls one corner of his mouth up into a smile, though it feels more like a grimace. “I think there are a few files on your desk that you forgot to bring in this morning. Could you make sure that they find their way to me by the time you leave?”
Well, suck it up, dickless, because that’s what
“Yeah, fuck off Harvelle.” An alarm dings softly on his phone. “And that’s my cue. Babysitting starts in thirty minutes.” He glances at Charlie. “You’ll be done and cleared out by the time that I’m back? Set everything up in the guest bedroom?”
Dean sighs and lets his hand flop to the side. With those thoughts twisting through his mind, even the prospect of jerking off has lost its appeal. He wriggles underneath the covers, flinging out a hand at the lamp until he manages to find the switch. The room plunges into darkness, and Dean closes his eyes.
Jess makes for the saggy, brown velvet couch that sits catty-corner from the stove and pulls out her phone. It’s a burner, her well-loved iPhone having been disposed of before she left California, along with all other means of identifying and tracking her.
Scott grimaces sympathetically. “I’ve been practicing all this time, and I only just got the hang of how to do this yesterday.”
(Sometimes Castiel wakes from a deep sleep with his heart racing and his veins screaming for some kind of chemical relief, and it takes Dean’s soft touches and gentle kisses to bring him back down to the earth. He can’t forgive Balthazar for making that his reality, or for forcing Dean to deal with the aftermath.)
The older woman drops off Jess’ sandwich and salad combo. “Thanks, Aunt Stacey,” Emily says.
“John Winchester,” he says, and suddenly feels an almost irresistible compulsion to hide the gun in his hand. That, or cock it and point it at John’s head.
Dean curls his fingers in the rough denim of his jeans. “Yeah, well. Lucky it’s not, because I definitely screwed the pooch on that one. He didn’t even stick around to make sure that I woke up.”
“Well, Dean-o? You in or are you out?” Ash asks. “Whatever you decide, make it quick. If Ellen catches us back here, she'll rip us a new one.” With that encouragement, Dean decides that he’s most certainly in. He clambers into the back of the van, and Ash shuts the door behind him.
It happens twenty minutes before the ultimatum is up.
With that, Dean crosses the street and approaches the park with determined strides, Castiel at his heels. “Dean, we’re two grown men who, in case you hadn’t noticed, aren’t currently in possession of any children,” Castiel hisses. “You’re going to get arrested. Again.”
Cas moans against Dean’s skin, low and deep, like he’s having the most amazing time, and the vibration of Cas’ voice travels right through Dean’s core, making him burn and pulse all over.
Cas’ eyes roam his face, like he’s seeing it for the first time. The moment feels too heavy, too intimate, so Dean grins and says, “You won’t get far anyway. I know where you live.”
Dean keeps his smirk in place until Baby’s door slams shut, then scowls at the dust-brown mountains that rise up beyond the parking lot. He shouldn’t let this asshole bother him. It’s not like he’s planning to stick around to make friends. In fact, he’s definitely ditching Castiel, the first chance he gets.
Hospitals are good, because they mean that he’s not dead. Hospitals are bad because they mean he was hurt badly enough to need an actual doctor, as opposed to his usual medical care of whiskey and dental floss. Plus, hospitals require insurance, and they’re generally a hell of a lot quicker to catch on than any ten law enforcement agencies that Dean’s come up against.
Dean spins around in his chair and fixes Castiel with a glare. His hackles have been up ever since he came back from making those phone calls, and, judging by the tense set of his shoulders and the flash of anger in his eyes, he’s just been waiting for an excuse to start a fight. “First of all, you don’t know that. Second of all, what kind of hunter are you, huh? Demons or not, there’s
Castiel walks out of the office, but he doesn’t leave the floor. He stands in the middle of the bullpen and he watches Uriel pack up his office. Castiel could almost admire his dignity, if he didn’t have Uriel’s words still seared into his skin. When Uriel leaves, he does so with his head held high, and his eyes straight forward. Castiel never takes his eyes off of him.
The small tremor in Jack’s voice tears Castiel out of his spiral, and he reaches out to touch Jack’s arm. “You
to fight with Jo, but the idea that he could be attracted to Dean Winchester is… Well, Jo’s not often stupid, but sometimes she’s the dumbest person on the face of the earth.
“Robert Steven Singer, if you think I’m leaving you here to face this down without me, you got another thing coming.”
It’s suspicious that Gael is alone when the rest of the guests and workers are huddled inside, circling the proverbial wagons against danger. Out on the lawn, he’s isolated and an easy target, yet he doesn’t seem alarmed as he opens his eyes when Dean approaches. “Michael,” he says, his voice never wavering from its calm, measured tone. “I’m surprised to see you here.”
let this chance slip through my fingers. Please, Dean. Help me.”
He looks around and finds that they’ve pulled over by the side of a rural highway. “Where are we?”
“What happens if you can’t reach him?” Sam asks. One by one his fingers release Dean’s wrist.
Castiel draws his blade and assumes a defensive stance. The darkness flickers again, this time accompanied by a harsh crackling noise. It reminds Castiel of the sound of static from a television or radio speaker.
“If you’re referring to your car—”
Dean spits his last question out, low and venomous. “Why’d you keep hunting, Cas?”
Cas is next to him. Cas is
“It’s girls’ night!” Pamela’s boots echo on the stairs as she comes downstairs. Her outfit is all black leather and heavy boots, like she’s planning to go out clubbing or possibly commit murder in a dark alley. “Come on, Ellen, they’re waiting for us.”
Sam looks at Jess. Her face is grim and tells him everything he needs to know. Together, they bend down and yank the cover off. The smell hits them almost immediately, and Sam rears back, his hand flying up to cover his nose.
When Cas realizes that an answer from Dean isn’t forthcoming, he walks past him towards the kitchen. He comes back with two glasses and a bottle of whiskey. Dean doesn’t really know where Cas found the whiskey, but he’s not asking questions. Cas pours himself a generous two fingers and then hands the bottle to Dean. The whiskey goes down fiery but smooth, and it’s almost good enough for Dean to miss Cas’ next words.
After that, it’s almost insulting how easily the hunt comes together. Dean spends an uncomfortable few hours skulking underneath the town’s bridge, which is in a neighborhood filled with all sorts of unsavory characters. He sees at least three drug deals go down and several more women leave in cars.
The blonde is unabashed. The glint of the streetlights on her glasses strikes Dean as oddly sinister. “If Seraph is going to paint himself as the protector of the city and receive government dollars for doing so, don’t you think he should keep the city safe?”
“If old Piss and Vinegar won’t go with you, I will.”
go with Sam? We've got stuff to talk about too, and I don’t see why I have to babysit Captain Tightass here.”
“Yes, that’s him. He used to talk to me a lot when he came by.”
“Sam. Nice to meet you,” he says, friendly but sufficiently curt that he hopes he can dissuade any flirting, if that’s where this is going. He’d rather not leave Jess alone for longer than absolutely necessary, and he’s itching to check his phone. The librarian gave him a fierce glare and a lecture about the library’s cell phone policy earlier when she saw him texting Jess, so he was forced to silence his phone and tuck it away. Right now, it’s burning a hole in his pocket, and Meg is an obstacle to be overcome.
“Their loss is my gain. You’re exquisite.” Dean indulges himself and allows his fingers to trace over the lines of Castiel’s lips. “Other Doms didn’t do justice to you, but I want you to put those experiences out of your head. Can you do that, Castiel?”
“Why not give this case up? You’ve gotten threats over it; why not pass it on to someone else?”
Jo looks like she wasn’t expecting any different answer, but her eyes flash with anger. She shoves her chair away from the table, the legs scraping across the floor. “Good to know that my curfew is still intact when it’s the end of the world.”
. “Dean?” he asks.
“Dean,” he says, his voice strangled and tight. “Dean, what are you…”
Dean’s fingertips press a little harder. “Yeah. He blamed me when Sam said that he was going into law. Blamed me more when Sam dropped the Stanford bombshell. He said that if I’d been better that Sam wouldn’t have chosen to leave.” Dean chuckles mirthlessly. He doesn’t realize that his fingertips have stalled until he clenches his fist on the warm skin of Cas’ back. “The kicker of it? Once Sam came back to Kansas, Dad never said one fucking word to him about, not until he died. I don’t think he ever forgave me for Sam leaving in the first place.”
It’s a little early in the day to get drunk even by Dean’s standards, but in the privacy of his room, there’s no one to judge him. He kills the neck of the first bottle in a single gulp, trying not to think about the fact that the book he picked to pass the time is the same one Cas was reading when they first met.
The pain subsides slowly, in waves, and the world takes its time falling back into alignment. Jess’ expression is equal parts grim and concerned when Sam catches her eye.
“What did he say?” Dean finally mumbles. “Dad. What did he want?”
Dean cocks a questioning eyebrow at Sam even as he makes grabby hands at the six-pack in a mute request for another beer. Sam hands it to him.
“No, it’s nothing like that.” Jess curls up against the arm of the couch and pulls the blanket around herself, letting her sister’s deep, familiar voice comfort her. “It’s demons again. I need to know how to kill one.”
“The Shadow will try its best to trap you and frighten you. You’ll need to keep your mind clear if you wish to have any hope of finding Dean.”
