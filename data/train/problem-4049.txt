Dean grinned, slung his arms around Castiel’s hips, and pulled him against him.
go and get a Renault. Damn those French cars. Yeah, they might be looking fancy, but it won’t take long for them to fall apart. Now I gotta fix the handbrakes, and only last year the servo steering had caused difficulties. But Hank won’t ever learn”, Bobby grumbled.
After a while, he perceived Castiel's hand shaking his shoulder a little, and Dean awoke with a start – he must have fallen asleep on his therapist's leg, leaned into him. He realized he was less intoxicated, and a blush crept on his cheeks and his neck, as he stretched with a groan and then turned around to Castiel, still sitting behind him on the couch. How long had he slept on him? What had Castiel done in the meantime? It should have bothered Dean, that he had lost his inhibitions around an almost stranger so quickly, that he had paid no heed to his presence. He already trusted him so profoundly, that he could sleep next to him. Castiel's smile swept all those worries easily away, and Dean was hypnotized by the mellow gleam of his infinite, blue eyes.
Dean studied Castiel's body as the orgasm was taking over him, how it made him boneless and taut by turns, how ragged and throaty his moans resounded as he held on to the mat desperately. Then, with one lengthy sigh, he slumped down on the ground and panted wearied, canting his head to the side so that he could cast an half-closed eye at Dean. A small smile spread on his mouth as their glances met, Dean still felt stunned due to the sensual incident, which had surprised them both in its untamed ferocity. He dared to let one hand stroke through Castiel's ruffled hair tenderly, recognizing how much his lover liked it as he hummed faintly and leaned his head towards Dean's palm. Dean couldn't resist the secret smile appearing on his lips as he watched Castiel closing his eyes, looking nothing but relaxed and utterly satisfied. He looked so beautiful, it tore Dean's chest apart.
With a disapproving grunt he grabbed the close-fitting black shirt and a plaid dark blue button-down shirt and put both on, feeling disappointment rattle through him, tightening his throat. When he observed himself in the mirror though, a tiny tender smile came to his lips – he looked natural like this, the outfit definitely suited him; he ruffled a hand through his hair, a sigh left his mouth. He had wished for something more spectacular than worn-out jeans, a shirt and an opened button-down, he had wanted to impress Dean with a perfect suit or another clever outfit, but no, he just looked like a lumberjack. He wondered if Dean had the same difficulties finding something nice to wear, but then again, Dean was so handsome, he was probably one of those guys that could wear anything and look good in it. An unnerved groan left him when he gave up and threw his arms in the air in defiance, grabbed his car keys and left his apartment.
At last, Castiel opened his eyes and looked up into Dean’s face. His expression was neutral, he didn’t move, didn’t even blink. Dean wondered if he knew he was awake, if he understood what was taking place. He gave Cas a soft smile, moved a bit closer as he stooped over him. Endless tranquility dwelt in Castiel’s deep blue eyes as he contemplated Dean, a small smile tugged at his lips. Dean didn’t have words when he studied the sunlight refracting in Cas’ beautiful blue eyes. He felt so happy it almost hurt. And yet, he felt like puking out his innards, he was so upset, so worried. Then Castiel’s eyes closed a little, their look became unfocused.
Then Castiel thought of Anna’s smooth red hair, her soulful eyes, how they had talked and shared their secrets deep into the night since forever, it seemed. Anna hadn’t been a saint, far from it, but she hadn’t deserved to die. Castiel imagined the sensation of her smooth hair gliding through his fingers, imagined her hearty laughter. To think he would never be able to converse with her again, to have her company… He coiled himself up into a small ball, cried until his body was shaking and convulsing. Outside, the thunderstorm was raging, the onslaught of rain seemed infinite. When he was completely exhausted from crying, Castiel drifted off into a light sleep, hoped he would never wake up again.
“Can’t believe I have the house all to myself by this evening,” Bobby said and wiggled his eyebrows comically. Dean grinned.
“Yeah?” Dean stepped closer towards the kitchen counter, where Castiel stood.
Dean started writhing against him, his pelvis grinding against Castiel's, and he could clearly perceive Dean's hard-on pressing against his upper thigh. Castiel stifled a low moan, instead he moved his head to bite ungently into Dean's neck, feeling the man arch his back to be closer to him. Heat encased them, drawing nearer and nearer, until it finally closed in on them, leaving them panting and moving against each other frantically, their hands clutching the other's hips and ribcage. In his feverish state Castiel barely noted how hard Dean made him, all he could focus on was this wonderful friction, Dean's hands on him, touching his sides forcefully, his nails leaving bloody marks on his pale skin as his palms slid under his shirt.
“Aren’t you mad? Or didn’t you get the news about yesterday yet?”
“West Oak Street, house 2921,” Dean croaked, grimaced, as he tasted more blood in his mouth. Once more, he opened his eyes, even though they felt heavy as tons, and regarded Jack. The boy was still trembling, his fingers clutched the phone anxiously, and tears were welling in his eyes. Their eyes met, and Dean smiled at him kindly.
Dean watched him, a little bewildered, as Castiel disappeared in the corridor, the sound of the fridge being opened reached his ears. He made use of the lonesome moment and fixed his borrowed boxer shorts quickly. Castiel reappeared with two opened bottles of ice-cold beer and the sweetest smile painted on his lips. He sat down next to Dean and handed him a bottle, which Dean accepted enthusiastically. Deep down inside of him a voice of the past scolded him that it wasn't like him to cuddle after sexual activities, but when Castiel leaned against him, it felt natural to put an arm around his shoulder and to breathe the scent of his hair in. They took sips from their bottles and remained quiet for a second, their attention rather focused on each other than on the movie. Dean sighed contentedly as the pleasant, tasty beer chilled his throat. He squeezed Castiel amicably and chinked bottles with him.
Before Dean was sure if it was the right approach to this disaster, he sat up and wrapped his arms around the weeping man, pulling him into a bone-crushing embrace. Instantly he felt answering hands on his back, drawing him closer. Their chest collided in one hard line; it was good to feel the reality of firm bodies instead of vague terrors filling their minds. When Castiel buried his face on Dean's shoulder, Dean didn't care about the blood or the water and the tears saturating his T-shirt. All that mattered was to hold Castiel in his arms again, to know he was alive. His moist breaths warming his shoulder were the most comforting feeling Dean could think of in this moment.
All the attendees left the room when the hearing was over and Misses Coleman hobbled out on crutches, supported by her husband. Dean and Bobby stayed on their seats, and Castiel sauntered towards them with a reproachful look. He knelt down on one of the chairs in the row in front of them, his arms supported on the back of the chair as he considered the other two men with a meaningful glare.
At that, Castiel stopped working, even put the knife down and fully regarded Dean with disbelief in his wonderful blue eyes. Humour was dancing in Castiel’s look, a small smile playing around the corners of his mouth.
Author's note – thanks for your interest so far! I'm happy about all the alert messages I received…! Jfyi, I'm currently finishing chapter 10… feedback is as always appreciated.
He was just starting an intricate piece, which Dean knew, because he had heard it in several movies before, and it was well known to him – the „Masquerade Waltz” by Aram Khachaturian. Dean had always loved this dramatic composition, but he had never heard it played on the piano before. He stood in the doorway while he watched Castiel’s fingers creating magic, getting every note right with a certainty that baffled Dean. He was absolutely smitten, loved the way the song sounded on piano. However, he was somewhat taken aback when he recognized the dark expression on Castiel’s focussed features, how grim he seemed, how forceful his left hand played the bass line. He was apparently still in a bad mood. Dean studied the bruise on his face and wondered if Castiel was thinking about Aaron. A gaping wound opened in his heart, which bled with sympathy for the other man. Castiel was creating such beautiful music with his fingers, but he was suffering deep inside, and Dean wished he could take his pain away, that he could lift the burden from him.
Hot Chocolate - You sexy thing
Dean scoffed, rolled his eyes. “No, I didn’t. Because I’m not interested. Like I told you a million times before.”
“In consideration of Bobby’s provisions, I’d say we’re cooking Hungarian goulash. It’s a hearty and saturating meal. And don’t worry, I’ve got a hunch you will like it. It’s also perfect for when you don’t know when someone will be back because it can cook for hours, that even makes it better”, Castiel said. He then put all the stuff on the kitchen counter they needed to prepare: onions, carrots, bell pepper, potatoes, and a cooled pack of beef from the fridge. Then Castiel got the instant broth, a can of diced tomatoes and many different spices. Dean watched him utterly mesmerized, how structured and concentrated Castiel was, how confident in his actions. It truly impressed him.
Of course, they often had guests, there seemed to be an endless coming and going. Also, what amused Dean greatly, was Jessica’s excitement about him and Cas owning a house now together – she constantly brought them gifts she thought they might like and need for their shared household; Dean didn’t know whether to laugh or cry whenever he laid eyes on the dreadful, multi-colored kitchen towels she had given them, or when he glared at the stupid deco-chicken figures at their kitchen table, which were just sitting there gathering dust. They were kind of cute, but also kind of dumb. For some reason, unbeknownst to Dean, Castiel loved these small porcelain figures, so they
Dean widened his eyes and shook his head rather annoyed. “What’s the matter,” Dean imitated sardonically. Then he walked over to the sink and filled a glass of cool water for Cas. He returned to him and thrust it into his hand, knelt down beside him. “Drink,” he insisted, watching Castiel gulp down the cool liquid greedily, as if he was terribly parched with thirst. When he was done, he sighed satisfied, but Dean got up and fetched him another glass and made him drink it too. Then Castiel lay down on the couch again, and he regarded Dean with big questioning eyes.
Dean closed his eyes and concentrated on the vision his brain was showing him. He could see everything perfectly, and it was so beautiful. He sensed Castiel wrapping an arm around his waist, too, and his fingers delved into the pliant flesh of Dean’s hip like an unspoken, secretive agreement to Dean’s proposal.
"Hi Dean, no you're not, I'm fine... Just trying to find something to wear. I just got out of the shower", he answered innocently, knowing he was beginning to tease. He heard Dean gasp at the other end of the line and heat churned in his lower stomach; his heart began to flutter, and when he caught sight of his eyes in the fogged mirror he saw his eyes had become glassy, heavy with want. Dean's voice and his little staggered exhales did something to him, made him want to touch himself indeed. Absentmindedly he let one palm slide over his lean torso, down his ribs, over his abs and almost down to where he needed it most, but Dean's dark chuckle made him stop.
He wasn't in the best of moods when Castiel knocked at his open door hesitantly, leaning against the doorframe and giving him a mellow look and a tender smile. He looked gut-wrenchingly admirable in the lush, golden morning light, how he stood there in the door with his white uniform, his dark hair strictly combed in a side parting. His eyes were refracting the light and shone in their plain, luscious colour at him, cut right through his heart. His rosy lips looked delicate, and his skin appeared even softer as a ray of light hit it. Dean felt his breathing falter for a second; Castiel looked angelic, fresh and pure like a flower at the crack of dawn, just blossomed and wet with morning dew. His feelings were already quieterfrom just looking at him; without knowing it, Cas was his calming anchor, which brought him down to earth. The smile he returned though wasn't as heartfelt as he had aimed for. Castiel entered the room and they exchanged quiet "Good mornings"; Castiel was sitting down on his bedside quite naturally, his legs hanging loosely from the mattress.
interrogating Castiel to make sure he was good for Dean, and Castiel mused he liked him, that he understood him in a grim way. Dean however whined at some point that John should let it drop, that he was old enough to decide with whom he would spend his time, and John's features softened at that, and he seemed to realize how much he had put Castiel through the mill. He laughed a bit embarrassed and apologized, shaking Castiel's hand again. Then Dean came to Castiel's side again, and he slung his arms around Castiel's neck, ignoring the amused scoff of his father blatantly, as he kissed Castiel greedily in front of John, Ash and Jo, indifferent to their thoughts. Castiel laughed into their kiss – John said, if Dean ever let go of his mouth again, he should come over for dinner someday, and Castiel held up his thumb to show his approval.
They entered the dark house, let themselves into the kitchen, their hands letting go of one another in the process. Dean assumed it wasn’t that late yet, but he was dead tired and only wanted to continue sleeping. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw the kitchen clock, showing him that it wasn’t even eleven yet. He and Castiel both went to the stairs, and he followed Castiel upstairs. The sudden question arose in him, whether he and Castiel would go separate ways now, whether Cas rather wanted to sleep alone in his bed. Upstairs, they stopped in the hallway as if they had silently listened to the question occupying Dean.
"Oh, plunge me deep in love – put out my senses, leave me deaf and blind, swept by the tempest of your love, a taper in a rushing wind", Castiel suddenly said quietly, making Dean's skin crawl effortlessly. It shook him deeply, to hear Castiel's sweet words, he assumed he was reciting a poem. A blazing fire burnt within him, having something to do with the way Castiel turned to him and smiled tenderly. He was slowly but certainly turning to jelly, melting right in front of Castiel. The attraction between them was tangible, making it difficult to breathe. Castiel's cold fingers brushed over Dean's outstretched hand, their eyes never leaving each other, and he placed his palm confidently on Dean's chilly fingers. Dean heard his own heartbeat vibrating loudly and excitingly in his ears, delight bloomed inside his mind. He turned his hand and grasped Castiel's and held it firmly in his.
Bobby was overjoyed when Dean finally opened up to him, removing the seals from his soul. Simultaneously he felt sorry for Dean, because he could imagine the weight of the inner conflict he had going on. He wished it was all that easy that he could tell Dean to just give it a go and confess his feelings for Castiel… but then again, he also knew Sam had a point there. Castiel was truly burdened with the abusive relationship he had left behind not even a month ago, and it might have been way too early for him and Dean to get involved with each other. Bobby reached out a hand over the table and placed it on Dean’s, squeezing his hand sympathetically. He smiled sadly at Dean and shrugged his shoulders.
Somehow he had managed to walk outside, into the park he had been to with Castiel the other day. The sun was shining brightly, and the flowers were blooming. There still was no warmth in the sun, but it was evident - spring had finally arrived. The trees were almost completely green, the grass looked lush and fresh. Dean was exhausted when he reached a bench and sat down on it, placing his crutches next to him. For a while he leaned back against the wooden frame with closed eyes, enjoying the sun's rays resting on his face. He breathed in the clear air, felt the light breeze stroking through his hair.
They were spiraling towards one another dangerously fast, and Dean felt Castiel tense up, but this time with arousal. His thighs clenched around Dean's pelvis firmly, his breaths became ragged and chopped off. Dean was just about to either comment on their clingy embrace or kiss Castiel hard and possessively, but then the intimate minute passed and Castiel scrambled away and to his feet. He glared down at Dean with a tremulous chest – his eyes contained a savage, exasperated expression. His cheeks were heavily reddened and his pink lips were supplied with hot blood and therefore swollen, as if they had kissed for hours. Dean sat on the ground and looked up at his former lover with a frown, not comprehending the shift in his demeanor. He recognized Castiel was clenching a fist. Their eyes met. Castiel didn't look sad or forlorn anymore, he looked embittered and uncompromising.
"That's pretty dumb of you, but alright."
Dean bit on his bottom lip while listening to Castiel speak so openly, his throat laced up with an overwhelming feeling of profuse gratefulness to have him back in his life, safe and sound. After all the torments Castiel had experienced, his smile was even more precious, as they both knew how much suffering and strength it had taken them to get here. He remembered Castiel’s tears and desperate confessions whispered at night; to see him smile again brought a joy to Dean’s heart that was closely bordering on pain, it was so intense. A vehement wave of love for Castiel suffused Dean, made him smile a twitchy smile. He moved closer to leave a soft kiss on Castiel’s forehead, as if he could bless this wonderful human being with this gesture and shield him from any possible future harm – Castiel slowly raised his eyes to Dean, as if he had seen a ghost, amusing Dean to some degree.
Jo took the serving tray into her hands and regarded the two men challengingly, asking them if they wanted another round. Dean raised his hands in defeat, dismissing her offer.
They separated for a moment, regarded one another with lust-hooded eyes, hazy glances. In the candlelight, mixed with the faint yellow light of the bedside lamp, Dean looked especially gorgeous. His skin glowed as if tanned with gold dust, his clean-cut features looked as if painted, and his green eyes were gems burning with a passionate fire, all framed by his dishwater blond hair. His chest was heaving with rapturous commotion, and his fingers on Castiel’s hips were trembling with a desire that left Castiel speechless. He felt wanton when his hands traveled to Dean’s shirt, unbuttoned it hectically. A knowing expression was in Dean’s eyes as he quietly regarded Castiel, how his lover peeled the shirt off his torso, revealed the bare skin underneath.
“Didn’t seem like that when you were gone,” he said quietly. Dean inhaled deeply, fought against his nervousness as he tried to get Castiel out of the abyss he had fallen into.
His throat was cording up with the bitter-sweetest kind of pain, one that was made of felicity and torture mingling. A million thoughts were resting on the tip of his tongue, praises and whole poems and verses he wanted to recite to this man he didn’t even know the name of but loved so dearly.
“Don’t you think we’ve waited long enough, Dean? I know now what I want, and I want you. I wanna be together with you, always…”
“Didn’t
"I envy you, I don't have siblings. There's no more family. My father passed away when I was a teenager, my mother died last year", Castiel admitted quietly, and Dean's heart churned with a squeezing ache of terrible sympathy. He had never meant to upset Castiel, though it felt wonderful to get to know him better. When Castiel raised his eyes to Dean's, the blue orbs were filled with a grim determination and years of suffering – they seemed wise and old to Dean, he was aware he was staring into a soul, which had seen a lot, which had aged all too fast.
Castiel has to smile melancholically when he hears Dean confessing it's all because of him, that he is to blame for Dean's arousal. Castiel feels a terrible yearning awaking inside him, and he wishes it was really him who did this to Dean, that he could be the one to please him. It had never occurred to him to share physical intimacies with a human, but during the last years he had learned what it was like to desire somebody, in this case no other but the man he had saved from Hell over four years ago. It is a longing Castiel can't completely comprehend, but the thought of touching Dean, of actually kissing him, makes him blush hard. It makes him feel vulnerable and unbosomed.
A lengthy sigh left Dean, he thought he could breathe properly again. Castiel holding him so affectionately lifted the veil of confusion, doubts and guilt easily, relief expanded in his chest. Castiel's warm breath wavered against Dean's cheek constantly, a queasy sensation ran down his spine as he leaned back and molted in the silent embrace. Castiel smelt of the massage oil, a heady scent of oranges and something unique Dean couldn't name, but of which he knew it was solely Castiel's essence. The naked torso against his clothed back was hot and Dean found pleasure in the comforting heat enveloping him gradually.
„That’s rich, coming from you,” Jo answered, and stuck out her tongue at Dean. It made Dean roll his eyes inwardly – whenever he was around Jo, they were behaving ridiculously, like little kids. Maybe it was because Jo had always felt like a little sister to him. Jo pointed at Dean and gave Castiel a warning look, her eyes wide open.
“Thanks, buddy,” Dean said, and his voice sounded just as bad as he was still feeling, all rough and husky. He picked up the glass of water and greedily swallowed it all with long gulps, sensing how it revived him and made the pain more bearable. Then he put the glass on the nightstand again and sighed long and heavily, closing his eyes momentarily as he listened to his insides.
A shadow of uncertainty flashed over Anna’s pale features. She blinked confused, lowered her gun a little. For a fleeting second, Dean hoped she believed him, that she would listen to him, come to her senses. But then his hopes were shattered, broke into a million shards, as Anna leveled the gun at him again. Mercilessness hardened her petite face.
He looked carefully at Gabriel, was silent for a while as the plan became solid in his head. Would he help him?
"I brought you your favourite guns and knives. There's some holy water in there, some salt, a spray can, and silver bullets. Hope that's sufficient", Sam said quietly, as he leant down to Dean. Dean patted his shoulder and thanked him.
"Look, I mean no harm, and you know that. It's just... this make-believe world, it never lasts. I know what I'm talking about. I've tried it with Jess for an even longer period, and you know perfectly how that ended. All I'm saying is, you will leave this place in five weeks, so don't get used to his company. We're not meant for this, Dean."
“Who gives a damn, Dean? Everybody needs an outlet for this frigging boring adult life with all these responsibilities. Some do sports, others beat their wives or get drunk, and others dress up. I don’t think there’s any harm in that. And if you stop giving a damn what others might be thinking of it or you, you can really have a great time… why don’t you come with me and try it?”
"It's okay, Dean", he heard himself say mildly, and satisfaction rumbled within him, because it really was okay – they were coming together again, they were understanding the other again. All those days spent between agony and heartache seemed far away, their brittle hearts found solace in each other's company. Castiel felt how the pain was uplifted from his body, and he felt so light, so alive, his whole body seemed to buzz with love and bliss. Now that they were healing, the desire for his lover ate him up, and he wanted to devour him and be devoured by him desperately. It had been too many nights without him, his body almost hurt in want of his touches, his caresses...Castiel breathed heavily, filled with pent-up desire for Dean; it had been so long, too damn long... one and a half week without him had felt like an eternity, so he wasn't surprised when his arms came around Dean's waist, and as he pulled him flush against his body, his drenched clothes, and as raw want sifted through his every pore.
"You don't know what you're doing to me," Castiel whispered, a melancholic smile gracing his lips. Dean's heart hammered hysterically against his ribs at those words, tenderness for the other took a hold of him. He couldn't do anything to rescue himself, liquid, hot flames of his oncoming orgasm licked at the bottom of his spine as the minutes elapsed. He began to loll in Castiel's embrace, his body twitched uncontrollably – lewd moans and gasps resounded, and still, Dean couldn't stop drowning in Castiel's mellow, deep blue eyes.
"Well, I've had my share of one-night stands, can't lie. But those times are over, I sowed my wild oats."
Dean chuckled. When he looked into Castiel’s eyes again, he was stunned by the humor dwelling in them, how zestful it made him seem. Speechless, he watched Castiel fetch everything from the nightstand with a concentrated frown; Cas’ fingers were shaky when he put the bottle of lube and a wrapped condom into Dean’s hands. As their fingers brushed together, Dean could sense Cas’ nervousness. With sympathy, he studied the flustered small smile on Cas’ kiss-wet mouth. Dean then sat down at the other corner of the bed, leaned his back against the cool wall, and beckoned Cas to come over. With a confused mien, Cas complied with his request, sat down on Dean’s lap, his brow furrowed. Gently, Dean stroked up and down Cas’ bare thighs, looked up into his lovely face, drowned in his storm-blue eyes.
"No!" Sam exploded suddenly, fierce wrath written all over his face as he sat up on the edge of his chair. "We cannot involve other hunters in this. What if some demon talks about Azazel's plans for me again? There's no way you could defend me against a bunch of ruthless guys you don't even know!"
"It made me understand how much you mean to me... and it scares me sometimes. No one came this close to me within the last years, and I lose my usual wariness around you so quickly... it's just... sometimes it feels like a dream and it's hard to believe that this is real... this thing between us, Cas,... I really want to give it a try."
“I like bees, always liked them,” Castiel gently said. Dean beheld him, marveled at the vivid glimmer in Castiel’s deep blue eyes, how beautiful he looked when he got enthusiastic about something. “Even if it might appear like nothing but chaos to the human eye, all these little insects work together and in total orderliness. Every one of them has their place and knows their role. It’s beautiful… to me, it’s just another manifestation of God’s work, an example, which can be applied to humanity as well. There’s a bigger picture here, even if we can’t always see it.”
Phew, please let me know what you think about this chapter.
. Sam sobered up and beheld Dean with an exhausted expression in his eyes.
Gabe pursed his lips, overdramatizing as he gave Castiel a sad, disappointed look. Castiel sighed at that but couldn't help suppress the smile that tugged at the corners of his mouth. Gabe was sometimes such a childish bastard, an adorable asshole Castiel had grown rather fond of during the years.
Their movements became slower, their breaths deeper, and slowly but surely, they were falling asleep. Their lovemaking and the turmoil of today had exhausted them. Castiel went out first. Dean kept stroking his arm incessantly, cherished the feel of holding Castiel like that. He enjoyed every minute of their togetherness, the intimate way they were lying together in bed. He knew it was the last time he would be happy, so he tried to gather all the strength he could get from this moment. Finally, Dean dozed off, too, his lids heavy with tiredness.
But Dean didn’t have time or nerve to worry about the Capulets’ wrath or their ensuing schemes of revenge. He was a free man! After days, he could finally leave the prison behind and get his life back! He barely stifled a big grin when he walked up to his waiting father and Sam. John gave him a scolding look – after all, Dean had cost the family a six-figure fortune, and on top of that, the money would go to the Capulets, their arch enemies. But the Montagues could afford it; it was a trifle in comparison to their wealth. And what little did money mean in exchange for Dean’s life, his freedom?
“How are you holding up, Bobby? What have you been up to lately?” Dean asked out of pure interest. He was already a little inebriated after so many beers – and judging by the funny glint in Bobby’s eyes, the older man was pretty smashed as well. Bobby shrugged his shoulders nonchalantly.
“Your love is not mine to take, though you may have mine until the end of times.”
Dean smirked when he remembered Jo and her feisty nature, wondering how long it had been since he had seen her. However, his mind couldn’t stop worrying about what was going on, why Jo was calling in the first place.
„Why did you stay with Aaron if you weren’t happy? I mean, from what I figured out, you weren’t happy in over a year or something. Bobby told me the last year had been hell for you. And now you’re saying you didn’t have a lot of fun in ages… Just curious.”
AU, swearing / curse words, fluffy, romance, ficlet
Castiel's limbs were heavy, his body seemed slack, when he decided to roll off of Dean after a few minutes of content silence. He lay on his side and searched for Dean's face, and when they both looked at each other, he noticed the pleased smile on the gorgeous man's lips. He was beholding Castiel with such intensity that he thought he was never going to be able to forget those lovely eyes. A weird sensation churned in his stomach, and it resembled soothing warmth and a notion of being home so frighteningly that Castiel couldn't help but smile cautiously as well. When he was here with Dean, nothing else seemed to matter; they were here in a shielded place, safe in their own little world.
Gabriel closed his lids, fought an inner battle, turned half away from Castiel. Then Castiel grabbed his hand and squeezed it mildly, made him open his eyes and look at him again.
Castiel blinked a few times, trying to make himself understand that this here was really happening, that Dean's words were honest, that this wasn't a hallucination. Blindly he found Dean's other hand on the table and put his above, then he leaned forward and almost closed the gap between their mouths. Dean's eyes were darting over his face, his mouth stood slightly agape.
The whole day seemed like a blur to Castiel. He could only remember last night – Dean’s frail smiles, the candlelight burning like gold in his eyes, how they had made love – and the terrible awakening the following morning, all alone in Gabriel’s chapel, surrounded by silence and freezing cold. Dean was gone. Castiel had returned to the Capulet’s mansion with slow steps.
had decided to keep them.
Castiel sighed and looked at Dean a little amused, fondness glowing in his ethereally beautiful blue eyes.
“You’re a show-off, Cas. It doesn’t matter how big the chunks of onions are. It’s dark in my stomach, it can’t tell the difference anyway.”
“God, you feel so good,” he moaned and moved his ass lower again, taking more of Dean inside. “I’m always impatient, I forget how big you are.”
with my life again, I want to make something good out of all this crap that has happened to me… Maybe I’m just ready for another chapter of my life, you know?” Dean explained himself, slowly unraveling the thoughts in his head.
It was tiring to turn his head, but Dean wanted to see Castiel's face, he needed to read the honest affection written crystal clear in his admirable eyes. Once he tilted his head and met Castiel's eyes it hit him hard as he saw more than he could have possibly asked for. A gentle understanding for Dean's breakdown danced in those lovable blue eyes, while Castiel's hand kept working on Dean's downfall with sweet cruelty. For the love of God he couldn't avert his gaze from those dilated pupils, those agape plump, pink lips. Castiel seemed to cling to every of Dean's reactions, he seemed totally mesmerized with the way Dean's body heated up, how it began to tremble with each forceful stroke.
His brother touched his shoulder carefully, bit on his bottom lip, as if not sure if he should stay silent or speak. Yet the urgent need for knowledge seemed to be written plainly over Dean’s features, for Sam spoke at last.
There was an awkward silence at the other end, and Castiel feared he had made Gabe puke with his little sermon. The next time Gabe spoke, Castiel realized the adult logic part of Gabe had taken over; whenever Gabe talked with him like that, Castiel could feel the five years separating them, and he couldn't help but feel like a little brother who got the tirade of his older brother.
He loved Castiel's dominant behavior when his lover covered Dean's growing, clothed bulge with one palm nonchalantly, squeezing it with gentle pressure. Dean's mouth opened up to a surprised, aroused "oh," and he unwillingly buckled his hips so that Castiel could touch him better. But then, Castiel had bent forward, his plump, sinful lips brushed over Dean's teasingly. They had stared deeply into each other's dilating eyes, and goose bumps had spread on Dean's skin. Castiel's mouth was so near to his, tickling with its proximity, and longing spread in Dean's chest. Castiel kissed his lips fleetingly, a sly smile appeared on his warm mouth when he took in Dean's desperate, heated up sight. He groped Dean's cock tighter and stroked him through the fly of his pants, making Dean growl and his lids fall shut.
Nevertheless, Castiel still didn't seem to understand what Dean was feeling for him when they had come back to Earth. He had wanted to stay in purgatory, regardless of the depth of Dean's sentiments for him. Castiel's confession had hurt like a bitch then, and his suicidal tendencies weren't soothing either. Dean has been worried for Castiel's safety and his well-being since he had escaped from purgatory, and all the son of a bitch ever seems to do is run out on him time and again.
They got to talking, while it darkened outside, sipping their beers and eating in between. Against the night’s darkness, they lit some candles and incense sticks, whose small snakes of fogs danced through the air. A mix of Castiel’s favorite music was quietly playing in the background, adding to the relaxed atmosphere of this evening. Dean picked out Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, Blue Öyster Cult, and some eighties’ bands with soft synth-pop music, thinking he quite liked Castiel’s taste.
"You're still loose...", Castiel heard himself murmur, and he began fucking Dean with his long, slender fingers. Dean squirmed and sighed somewhat relieved, and it shook the very foundations of Castiel's heart. Even now, as he was savagely slicing him open, Dean relished his brute ministrations, got lost in the way Castiel's fingers moved within him. It touched Castiel deeply, and he felt a sore pain tightening his throat, wondering what it would take for Dean to turn his back on him. Hysteria poured over him and clutched him firmly, and it made him spat out the next words, and Dean tensed up once more. He didn't know if it was a suppressed sexual kink speaking through him, or if it was his inability to let Dean go, he just knew he needed him, and that it made him berserk that someone else had taken advantage of him tonight.
"The other Winchester, you know? God, I hope I made enough food, Sammy could always eat for two", John enlightened Castiel, then he walked towards the kitchen too, and Castiel followed with hesitant steps. He figured he would meet a voluminous, food-ravening person, presenting himself as Dean's younger brother – when he accessed the room though, he had to throw his head back to actually look into those giant's face. He was goddamn
Castiel put his hand above Dean's and gave it a light squeeze, then he opened his eyes and smiled honestly at Dean. He got up and together they walked to his apartment door slowly. Dean observed Castiel running a hand through his hair and sighing agitatedly as he followed him.
“Cas, what’s wrong? Talk to me,” he requested. He needed to know what was bothering Cas so badly.
Dean wandered around aimlessly and sucked in the cheerful atmosphere of the party guests all around him. He wasn’t particularly looking for a hookup or someone to distract him from the heartache Lisa had left behind. He also wasn’t keen on getting drunk, for even though no one had recognized them so far as Montagues, he didn’t forget where they were, and what dangers this might bring upon them. Therefore, he strolled through the Capulets’ magnificent mansion with a glass of cool whiskey in his hand and contemplated the costumed guests quite contently. He never tired looking at the innumerous murals and oil paintings everywhere; they were truly awe-inspiring, not only because of their masterful execution, but because of the scenes they depicted in gruesome detail: There was the murder of Jesus Christ, his body covered in bleeding wounds, the thorny crown cutting into his forehead’s skin; there was the winged archangel Michael leading the heavenly armies to battle against shadowy black creatures… Dean paused in his movements and studied the paintings thoughtfully. He had already known that the Capulets were a strictly religious family, still, he was taken aback by how seriously they seemed to take their beliefs.
Dean woke up in the early morning, way before Castiel’s alarm clock went off. Outside, early singing birds were twittering in the grayish morning light, while a red big sun was rising. He rubbed the sleep out of his eyes and turned to his side, surprised to find Castiel was wide awake and regarding Dean silently for his part. He looked haggard, as if he hadn’t caught a lot of sleep this bygone night. The expression of his eyes was sinister, but the littlest of smiles tugged at his lips when their eyes met. With a gentle hand, he stroked along Dean’s cheeks, his fingertips playing with the slight stubble of Dean’s unshaved skin.
And that was it. Dean gathered a few of his belongings that evening and returned to Castiel's cleared out flat. At first, it had felt weird to wander through the emptying rooms, knowing he would spend the coming nights in them, but then Castiel had hugged Dean from behind and pressed against him reassuringly, and that was when Dean had felt home again. Home wasn't a place or a building; home was in Castiel's arms. Castiel set the alarm clock for six o'clock when they went to bed that night, even though he didn't have to get up for work anymore. He told Dean he still had to take care of a few things and that Sam would help him the next days. Also, Dean had to be back in the rehab-center in time for his training.
“Hey, Jack. Remember that old movie with the dinosaurs you saw in the store the other day? The one Cas and I didn’t want you to watch because of the age rating?”
Sam and Dean had set up their camp at Castiel's vacant flat this Friday. They unloaded their remarkable weapons collections on Castiel's living room parquet. The whole floor was littered with guns, knives and ammunition. Castiel was adamant to cook for them a tasty three-course menu. He had said he didn't know if he ever got the opportunity once they were on the road to display his cooking skills, and then the Winchesters might never know what a great artist he was when it came to food. Also, since Dean had illustrated quite graphically what greasy meals Castiel would eat from now on, the dark-haired man had insisted on having at least one last delicacy. So, while Castiel labored in the kitchen, quietly humming to himself, Dean and Sam sat cross-legged on the floor and polished and cleaned their armory with concentrated countenances. Occasionally, Dean's eyes would flee to Castiel working in the kitchen, unaware of the placid expression in Dean's face, and he would observe him tasting his meals with an adorable pout.
“You’ve got to be kidding me,” John muttered through gritted teeth.
Suddenly there was Dean's hot breath entering Castiel's ear, and his face was so near, it made Castiel rigid with hot peaks of arousal pumping through his whole body. He was so
Dean searched for Castiel throughout the whole day, forgoing lunch gladly. He ignored all passers-by with a fierce mien when they regarded him with worried looks; he ignored the fine weather and the overall cheerfulness of everyone outside because of the lovely spring's day. Though he didn't know this town he limped through the park and all other public places he could reach, frantically seeking for penetrating blue eyes and a dark mop of hair. Deep inside he assumed nothing would come of his extensive search – after all, he was just another insignificant human and if a demon had taken Castiel along, only God knew where to find him. Still, Dean persuaded himself if he just kept looking for a few minutes longer, he might be rewarded with the sight he missed so sorely.
„Oh yeah, I have an ace up my sleeve. Just wait and see, buddy…,” he muttered with a secret smile.
"Is this the reason why you were awake in the middle of the night, doing the dishes?", Castiel asked, picking up his neglected massage, kneading the supple flesh of Dean's hips and the small of his back, drinking in every of Dean's agitated grunts and groans. Dean seemed to be losing it completely, unable to tone down the sounds coming from his mouth, nor was he capable of keeping his body still – he writhed underneath Castiel's strong, skilful hands, an utter, carnal mess.
„Nah, Jo. It’s getting late. And our buddy Cas here sounds as if he is chewing marbles while talking. I think it’s time we hit the road, Cas. We still have to walk a fair way,” he suggested. Castiel nodded pensively then and scratched his stubbles. They got up in unison – Dean couldn’t help but laugh when Castiel was swaying back and forth, definitely not used to this amount of alcohol he had consumed. Dean walked over to him and gave Jo a reproaching, meaningful look. She had wanted to get them drunk, and she had gotten the job done quite well.
His face was lying right underneath Dean’s; he looked up at Dean with a shy smile, a faint light was glowing in his beautiful eyes. The perse twilight of daybreak was mirrored in his irises, and the sight of it left Dean speechless. He was sure he would never tire of studying the different hues of blue mingling in Castiel’s irises… Then Cas uplifted one hand and let it come to rest on the back of Dean’s head, his fingers sifting through the strands of Dean’s hair with tenderness. A tickling sensation wandered down Dean’s back, made him shudder with delight. There was a sweet smile on Castiel’s kissable mouth as he regarded Dean knowingly, pleased about the effect he had on the other man.
"You're aware of the way Sam and I live, that we're always on the road and hunting some evil sons of bitches. And lately things have become prettyhairy; Today we've been caught off guard by a group of demons, they're to blame for my new look. They're somehow after Sam and want to see me dead, and we don't know when they will reach this town. So... you see, we need to leave soon. We would have driven away within the next two weeks anyway. What I'm trying to say is... it was unfair of me to get involved with you. Especially under the premise I was only staying for a few weeks. I've... I've never thought things between me and you would evolve into this kind of relationship. Maybe I wouldn't have given in to temptation had I known back then what I know right now. The thing is that – whatever this is between us, it has to end, and I have to leave as fast as I can. Once I'm gone, you won't be in danger any longer. And you can return to the life you knew, and I'll do the same."
Castiel sighed, paused. Dean commiserated with him, frowned darkly. Cas must have gone through hell with his parents. Dean was baffled by the cruelty they had shown towards their own son.
Without a warning, Castiel intensified the pressure of his hand surrounding Dean's length, and he pumped him hard and incessantly. Dean yelped in delight as a hot wave of lust overwhelmed him and coursed through him. The heat inside of him increased and he was tossing and turning under Castiel's feverish body; he realized his muscles were constricting more and more, keeping Castiel locked inside of him and squeezing him on their own accord. Dean heard a faint, astonished gasp escaping Castiel's mouth, and it stirred the insatiable hunger within him to see the erotic mask resting on Castiel's features. Nothing could have prepared Dean for the glance he received when he struggled to open his lust-hooded, heavy lids. Regarding his lover with half-closed eyes. It hit him hard and cut right through him to see how havocked Castiel looked: his ruffled, dark hair framed his flushed, deep red cheeks. The pearls of sweat gleamed in the candlelight as they trickled down his temples in small rivulets... his swollen, puffy lips, opened to mute, trembling screams. But what startled Dean the most was the inextinguishable fire burning in Castiel's shocked eyes as he observed Dean with each powerful thrust, how knowingly these eyes appeared whenever Dean gasped or whined impassionate.
He hadn’t exactly chosen the easiest way, but deep down he knew this was the right decision, that he and Castiel would truly make one another happy. After a moment of contemplative silence, he revealed the plan, which had formed in his mind.
Garth and Dean were laughing hysterically, holding their hands over their mouths to remain soundless – fits of laughter shook their bodies, while Ash told them about a one-night stand he had intended to have ages ago, that had gone wrong terribly.
"Hi, Cas. What is it?", Dean asked straight away, and Castiel decided to play along the game of bluntness, so he laid it on the line and responded "It's high time we had the talk we need, Dean. You better not hang up on me" - there was no reaction, but some seconds of silence, and Castiel concentrated on Dean's quiet breathing sounds. Disappointment spread inside Castiel's stomach like a cancer and it hurt terribly to hear Dean's agitated sigh, as if Dean was annoyed with him, and it made Castiel angry and perplexed at the same time. How stupid of him to think Dean wanted to solve things between them as well... Wrath took over him, and before he could control it, he heard himself blather somewhat shakily and emotionally "Know what? Just forget it, forget about it. I, uh... I'll hang up and you can proceed with whatever you were doing."
Castiel nodded again, but this time, he couldn’t hinder all the tears streaming abundantly down his cheeks. He tilted his head, ashamed, and he couldn’t say anything anymore. Dean saw his shoulders were shaking, and that Castiel was crying silently now. It was then that Bobby got up and drew Castiel into a tight hug. Dean watched how Castiel turned to hide his face in Bobby’s chest, allowing him to hold him and comfort him while Castiel cried all his heart out.
Thursday came. By now, Dean wondered if Castiel was ever going to hit on him again, or whether he had finally decided that he didn’t want more from Dean than just one hot night. Dean feared the latter – a thought, which made him feel useless, unlovable, just like a piece of meat. Maybe he had nothing more to offer now than a body – and maybe his own heart thought so too, didn’t want to give Dean permission to love and be loved again. He had decided to kill all his stupid thoughts with work to distract himself. He couldn’t stand the state his mind was currently in, it had become unbearable.
He stopped when he heard voices inside, though it was beyond closing time. The door was open, fastened so that it wouldn't lurch about in the vivid play of the wind. Castiel listened once more, feeling like a criminal, because this seemed to become a habit, eavesdropping on Dean. Seemingly, he was having another argument with his father, and it made Castiel forget his own turmoil, as soon as he heard his own name was being mentioned.
"Sounds good to me. Can we please go back now? I'm freezing to death! And who's gonna marry you then?", he teased, but his voice was shaky, still too haywired with his feelings. He laughed as he heard Dean laugh heartily. Their hands came together effortlessly, and though it was deathly cold, they took their time as they strolled back to the others.
„Night, you two. And drop me a line that you’ve gotten home okay,” Jo said with a friendly smile. Dean nodded, then turned around to go, with Castiel in tow, steering him through the crowd towards the exit. When they left The Roadhouse, the air outside was brisk and spicy. Dean inhaled it deeply, feeling it revive him. For a moment, they walked in silence, their feet in lockstep. They walked past the parked Impala; Dean patted her hood and wished his baby a good night, then they continued with their way home. The loud noises of The Roadhouse started fading away, just became a blurred murmur in the background.
Time seemed to have stopped, as they regarded each other over the distance, the multicolored light touching and illuminating their faces. People were dancing and chatting and laughing, but Castiel was blind and deaf to his surroundings, his every sense devoted to Dean. In Castiel's head the music faded away, and the movements of everyone seemed as if in slow motion, and he heard his wild, loud heartbeats resonating in his ears, loud and steady like a never-ending drum, as he drowned in Dean's stunning sight, how he smiled tenderly at him. He felt frozen on the spot, as he observed Dean approaching him, avoiding the people crossing his path. Dean stopped in front of him and took Castiel's hand, their fingers intertwined.
“Told you! Lemme get you something sweet for your blood sugar.”
A queasy feeling spread in Dean’s guts, for he knew he had been detected. Why had he been so stupid and reckless to take off his mask? Nevertheless, he didn’t care about the danger he was in, couldn’t find an ounce within him that cared about his fate and what the Capulets might do to him. All his thought was bent on talking to this stranger and get closer to him… Now that Anna was gone, he dared to eliminate the last steps between him and this tantalizing man.
Dean frowned, confused. Was he supposed to flee? They would catch him; he couldn’t escape from the law forever. He was about to protest, opened his mouth to say something – but he was left speechless when Sammy pressed the keys of the Impala into his hand, made Dean clasp them. The wet rain on Sam’s hand mingled with the blood on Dean’s hand. Their eyes met, they shared meaningful looks. Tears were welling in Sam’s eyes, and Dean felt like sobbing all over again. He nodded grimly.
Dean didn't know whether he was supposed to sulk and frown or to laugh and thank Castiel for his kind consideration. They watched one another for a few seconds, until Dean couldn't take it anymore and chuckled, face palming his heated visage. Oh my...
„Well, I believe Sam’s got a point there, Dean. Cas might need a whole lot of time to heal from what he’s been through… but when it comes to you, son, I think you’re just full of crap. I think you’re hiding behind nothing but fear… but you can’t keep hiding forever, Dean. Yeah, you got hurt pretty good… but if you never leave that behind you, you’ll be a lonesome son of a bitch just like me. And, let’s be real here, one loner in the family is enough. So… if it’s as fate willed, I think you two will stop dancing around one another sooner or later and quit your goddamn whining.”
to each other, that this was too
“Good,” Sam said. “Very mature choice, Dean”, he quipped with a chuckle. Dean rolled his eyes at that.
“Yeah, you’re right. I like it here. The neighbors are okay, except for that one student, who occasionally throws a party and smokes too much weed. But it’s a good place to live. When you come for a visit, I’ll show you around. It has this incredible magnitude a two-room apartment typically has to offer,” he joked. Cas grinned, but then his mien suddenly darkened, and he beheld Dean thoughtfully, twisted his lower lip between his teeth. A shadow of doubt crawled over his face, and he averted his eyes. He looked inwardly torn. Dean immediately picked up the change in his demeanor.
"I don't believe a word that's coming out of your mouth. I mean, why should I, Cas? I trusted you, I opened up to you, and look what happened! I'm behind bars, for the sake of another goddamn investigation. That is what this has been all about, am I right? You used me, so that you could get more details about the brothel, so that you could close it all down. And while you were at it, you thought you could have a little fun with me, right? God, I can't believe I've been so blind!", Dean ranted and raved at Castiel, his voice becoming louder.
"Dean, I know you don't wanna talk about it, but maybe you should some day, you know. I mean, Cas is really trying to make amends. He even went shopping and bought your disgusting skin mag. Don't you think it's time you start contributing your part?"
Stunned silence met him, and Dean didn’t know what to think of it. Was Cas pissed at him? Had he said something wrong? Then there was a long, unnerved sigh.
"Or maybe,... you dreamt I was doing this, didn't you?", Dean's hoarse voice said, dropped several octaves deeper. Castiel merely nodded, and then Dean closed his lids, wrapping his lips around Castiel's head gingerly. Dean's hands were holding Castiel's hips, keeping him in place, and it took all of Castiel's willpower not to push forward into that wonderful wet heat. Inch by inch Dean took him deeper inside, moving his tongue alongside Castiel's dick, and Castiel felt himself pulsate against Dean's tight throat. Slowly Dean started to suck him off, his head moving up and down, from his hilt to his head; his tongue licked his sensitive head, his teeth carefully gnawed at his throbbing muscle. Castiel groaned and sighed and shuddered whenever Dean deep-throated him, enjoying his skilled, playful caresses. God, it felt so good... He couldn't remember the last blow job he had received, but this one was outstandingly brilliant. He let his fingers glide through Dean's blonde, soft hair, tugging at some strands delicately, and at that, Dean hummed against his dick, making Castiel's knees go weak when he felt the vibration against his painfully hard erection.
“Let’s just get you settled, boy. Come, I show you the room, and you can unpack. We can always talk later. It’s getting late, and I guess you’re also tired…” he said friendly, whereupon Castiel just nodded. It seemed to Dean he was close to tears, absolutely traumatized and about to lose his composure. His knuckles were white when he held his duffel bag tighter as if he was holding onto it to find some support. Bobby patted his shoulder once, then he ascended the stairs, giving Dean a gloomy warning look as if he wanted to remind him not to ask stupid questions. Dean let them both pass him by on the stairs, confused about what was going on. He then walked to his own room, sitting down on the bed, not knowing what to do with himself.
hungover. He kept lying in bed for a moment, scolding his own stupidity and recklessness. At his age, he was really too old to be hungover, no matter how bad he was feeling. Bobby was still asleep, so Dean quietly made himself ready to leave. He wrote a short note for him, which he left on the kitchen table, thanking him for last evening and putting him into bed.
When he came to again, the gray daylight was stronger, nearly whitish – to his sleep-adjusted eyes, it was terribly bright, blinding him. The rain had turned into a drizzle, and the clouds looked less threatening, as a strong wind blew them away. He heard movement downstairs, Castiel and Bobby rummaging through the house and talking quietly with each other. Bleary-eyed, Dean produced his cell phone from under his pillow and checked the time. With an eyebrow raised, he realized he had slept for over two hours. The pain had diminished somewhat, was more tolerable now. But his shoulders were stiff and aching, and his head felt as heavy as lead. Dean felt maltreated, as if someone had punched him again and again in his sleep. Also, he was a little light-headed and nauseous, his blood sugar being at rock bottom.
Raptured, Dean watched Castiel's other hand coming up as well, approaching his face while they kept smiling at each other carefully. Castiel's palm came to rest on Dean's cheek and Castiel clasped his face and pulled him down resolutely, bringing him in. Drum beats boomed inside Dean, his heart contracted. He breathed tremulously as he saw Castiel's lids fluttering shut sensually. With half-closed eyes, he regarded his lover's erotic, flushed face, overcome with desire. Dean leaned in hungrily and brought his lips to Castiel's, kissing him slowly, testing the water. Castiel felt soft and warm against him; an electric sensation coursed through Dean as he felt him respond to his kisses passionately. Soon, Castiel's hand left Dean's cheek and encompassed Dean's back of the head – he yanked Dean forward and pressed their mouths harder together. Castiel tilted his head and opened up his mouth, hot, stuttered exhales wafted straight through Dean's spread lips.
"Listen, smart ass. Could you imagine I might have something important to tell you that has nothing to do with Cas? Just keep your trap shut for a second and listen to me. Understood?" he hissed in return, not giving a damn about the unfriendly sound of his voice. Sam was strangely quiet, his words hadn't failed to have the desired effect.
Castiel felt happy, a haze of heavenly fulfilment pounded through his mind as he breathed in Dean's unique fragrance, as he felt his naked body underneath him, holding him tightly, safely. They fit perfectly together, and Castiel understood this was the place where he belonged. The way Dean's fingers sifted through his hair while Castiel listened to his steady heartbeat, the way his palm slid underneath his shirt to stroke his back absentmindedly, showed Castiel that Dean must have felt similar, that he was important to Dean too.
Cas got up and walked out of the room, without ever taking another look at Aaron again. Dean was about to follow him as well, but something bothered him about leaving Aaron there on the ground just like this. He looked over his shoulder once more – he couldn’t help but want to make sure Aaron was more or less okay and that he didn’t need an ambulance. It just wasn’t in him to turn off this button that he cared about other people, whether they were total douchebags or not. It just wasn’t in him. He watched Aaron sitting up with a groan, wiping the blood away from his mouth. He glared at Dean with all the hatred he could muster.
"I don't ensnare anyone, they're willing and you know it," he retorted dryly, making Dean laugh briefly.
“Hey, there’s nothing there, baby… It’s getting dark and maybe you just saw a deer or whatever,” he said quietly, his voice low and soothing. It seemed to have the desired effect on Castiel, because he finally broke free from his stupor. He sighed and melted into Dean’s arm, leaning trustfully against him while Dean rubbed his cool upper arm repeatedly.
It was unspeakably satisfying to watch Castiel come undone, how his hips bucked frantically forward as Dean let his thumb brush over the wet drop of precome on the pink forehead slowly. The veil of sweet torture and overmastering pleasure was written all over Castiel's face – his brows were furrowed, beads of sweat were appearing on his forehead; his mouth stood slightly agape, it quavered sensually whenever Dean's wrist moved upwards on his dick in forceful, slow motions. Dean thought he could get off from Castiel's sight and response to his fondlings alone. He leaned forward and claimed his lips once more, with relish he realized how Castiel leaned into the kiss unrestrainedly, offering himself to Dean wholly. His hands touched Dean's bare chest, fingernails were digging into his pecs ferociously. While their tongues slid lewdly together, Dean felt Castiel's fingers were trembling against his torso, sliding restlessly back and forth. The man within his reach tensed up noticeably, Dean perceived the shudders taking over his body. The movements of his rotating hips became erratic, quicker – Dean let go of those kiss-swollen, plump, pliant lips to watch pleasure wash over Castiel.
"Yeah, Sam and me have to make some investigations. I told him I'll be in my room in 20 minutes, so I gotta go...," he explained. His heart skipped a beat when he detected the slight grumpy mien his words had placed on Castiel's forehead, as if he was wordlessly protesting. He leaned down and pressed a lengthy, chaste kiss to Castiel's temple, hearing him hum appreciatively.
of Castiel's body against his... His soft parts pressed against his idly, their hipbones collided with each other, their tummies sandwiched so that not even a drop of water had space between them... With every breath their chests moved together and the friction and slide of their smooth wet skin made Dean's knees weak, he felt absolutely light-headed and aroused. Castiel kissed his neck and sucked at his throat sluggishly. A dark chuckle rumbled through Dean when he noted teasing teeth biting his thin, sensitive skin there – Castiel nibbled repeatedly at the pulse point of Dean's throat, and Dean let him create a dark hickey there deliberately.
THANK YOU for your lovely reviews and your continuous support! Posting this now because I'm quite excited after I finished chapter 38 yesterday, and I've been all itchy ever since... Also, I'm pursing my lips while reading your lovely reviews, and I understand you already know me too well! Of course they're not talking about their fight (looks at Inferification incredulously, you know me, you really do! x3) ... now, this next chapter is... uhm... well, "mark me down as scared and horny", and full of possessiveness? Please, don't be alarmed, in the end everything will be fine...
Dean hobbled to the kitchen and leaned back against the counter with a wrecked sigh as he listened to the dialing tone. Somehow he felt his little sheltered bubble would burst as soon as he would talk to Sam. But he couldn't continue living in this dream, he had to force himself back into the reality he had known all his life. It was the only reasonable thing to do. At long last Sam answered the phone.
It was getting dark and Castiel's bones began to protest about the position they were sitting in. He withdrew in their embrace and caught Dean's eyes staring at him through the twilight, a strange fire flaring in them. Through the oncoming gloominess of the night he saw Dean's tender smile, and he replied to it calmly. It was weird that he didn't feel ashamed about coming undone in his company, nor that Dean had seen him in the most intimate ways imaginable. When it came to Dean, he wanted to lay himself bare in front of him, he wanted him to know every secret and every story that was glued to his soul, because he wanted Dean to know
"What, now that I'm involved with a man you become a womanizer? Guess that's just because I'm currently unavailable for the ladies," Dean taunted with a grin, enhancing the blush on Sam's cheeks. Other than cheering Sam up, making him feel awkward was one of the most welcome amusements Dean had grown fond of. Though that made him probably a mean jackass...
This evening turned into a pathetic display for Dean, so that he barely knew himself any longer. The bottle of Jack was his only companion as he sat in his room in the darkness, thinking about the collateral damage he had provoked. While the alcohol clouded his thinking, he found solace in the fact that Sam wasn't there to see the ridiculous state his older brother was in; clinging to a half emptied bottle of whiskey and mourning a love he had never deserved in the first place wasn't exactly an image he wanted others to see. He felt like he had lost every sense of purpose, indifference expanded in his veins like a cruel disease. He had left Castiel, and ever since, gloom surrounded him with cold, boney fingers. His chest ached and it was difficult to breathe. The moonlight enhanced his exhausted features as he rested his dizzy head against the wall. Tears were drying on his cheeks and he sighed a wrecked sigh and took another gulp of the burning liquid. In this moment, he couldn't care less about the world and its problems, the people he felt inclined to save... All he wanted was to hold Castiel again and shower him with countless, sweet kisses. What would he have given to hear his carefree laughter once more, or to be considered with a gentle smile and eyes that were brimming over with undeniable love?
„Something you wanna tell me, Dean?” he asked sternly.
Framing an expensive angel statue there were two marble flights of stairs leading up in a half circle; from the right side, Dean watched his father emerge, his eyes falling on his oldest son. John froze, stopping at the stair head. His relaxed features changed instantly when he looked at Dean with utter disbelief, then at Castiel standing next to him. Out of his back pocket, John drew his gun. He aimed at Castiel. Dean was paralyzed with fear, knew his father was a good marksman. John descended the stairs, his eyes locked on the couple. A fierce grimness was written all over his features. Dean knew this mercilessness, had seen it countless times, especially when someone mentioned Mary.
Castiel smiled at him, then he shifted closer, wrapped an arm around Dean’s hip under the blanket, and pulled him close against his body. Castiel felt sleep-warm, his limbs lithe and smooth against Dean’s body, enticingly. A shiver ran through Dean as he sensed Castiel’s body heat through the thin layer of his T-shirt, how their torsos were tightly pressed together as they breathed against one another. His head was swimming, his insides felt like jelly, when Cas tightened the grip on his waist, his fingers digging into Dean’s pliant flesh, and when he tilted his head to kiss Dean ardently, making him forget the whole world. He responded to his kiss, allowed Castiel to turn them, so that he could pin Dean right underneath him. When they separated for a second, panting, their eyes met, and even without words, they knew where they wanted this to head to. Cas bent his head down, left open-mouthed kisses on Dean’s crook of the neck, causing Dean to fist his dark hair in return, as he was searching for something to hold on to. Incredible heat pooled in his abdomen, made him grow hard, as Castiel kissed and teased all the sweet spots he had found over the years. Dean was like melting butter under Cas’ hands, thoroughly enjoyed his caresses, his determination to make Dean come undone. With Cas, it was easy for Dean to let go of any inhibitions, to lose control. Before he knew it, he heard his own soft moans, sensed his body trembling with passion, reacting to the caresses of his lover, as Castiel worked on wrecking him perfectly.
Then his eyes wandered to the man’s features which were unmasked. Dean’s heart skipped a beat when blue eyes, as blue as the darkest sea, met his. It was like an arrow piercing his heart, as if the air had been punched right out of his lungs. His eyes hungrily took in the features of the man, who was so handsome and had such a delicate face, it made Dean speechless. Not only were there gorgeous blue eyes which reminded Dean of clear summer nights sprinkled with a million stars, but there was also a sharp nose, and plump rosy lips screaming out to be kissed and taken. For a second, he got weak at the knees, overwhelmed by this uproar of wild emotions going haywire inside of him. Then he realized the stranger was regarding him with unambiguous interest – the littlest smile scurried over his kissable lips, then he shyly averted his eyes. Dean felt reborn, strengthened, his heart tripled its beat with a potency he had never experienced before. Who was this angelic man, who looked as if he had escaped directly out of paradise?
"Alright," Castiel said, and it was nothing more but a faint whisper, causing Dean's hair to stand on end.
As he set foot on the wooden floor of the balcony the hunter instincts were back – sharp and sudden. Dean felt his whole back tense up, his hands formed fists, ready to throw punches if necessary. He wasn't the injured young man anymore. He was the killer, the attacker, game for anything. His heart leapt into his throat when he detected the balcony door was left ajar. He gasped for breath. The pillows on the ground were widely scattered, lay inconsiderately on the ground. Cautiously Dean stepped inside the quiet apartment, perking up his ears attentively. Adrenaline pumped through his veins, he tried to breathe as quietly as he could.
"Whatever you say, man. You're calling the shots for the next hour. I'll do whatever you want, except kissing, that's my only rule", he said confidently, and Castiel's mouth fell slightly open. Actually he wanted to tell the man that not one sexual thing was going to happen between them, but then he started to doubt his intentions; after all, he really had a thing for this man. He was so attractive and infatuating that Castiel had breathing trouble; the caresses of his skilled hands still burnt on Castiel's skin, his body vibrated. And he was aroused, he could not deny that. For a moment he wavered between his wants and fantasies and his morals. He growled when he felt his aching leaking dick forcing him to make a decision quickly.
week of pregnancy, round like a basketball with swollen feet and a dangerous temper, so Sam thought it was she rested and didn’t have to do much in the rented house.
“These lips aren’t yours to kiss,” the stranger whispered, a frown of misery marring his delicate features.
"I love you," he muttered, feeling Castiel's smile against his skin. "I love you too," Castiel responded, then he left innocent kisses all over Dean's throat, his collarbone and his jaw. Dean didn't know for how long they stayed like this, lying together in the candlelight, in that deserted sanctuary. When they parted and reached for their clothes, they gave other fond smiles and mellow looks while they dressed, and it seemed to Dean, the world had changed in between their arrival and their approaching departure. That he and Castiel were cleansed of every sin, purified through their fusion. He had given himself over wholly to Castiel, and now they belonged together in every way imaginable. Never before had Dean allowed himself to become so attached to someone. He didn't know whether Castiel understood the depth of emotions Dean held for him, but when Dean walked up to him, a shy smile spreading on his mouth, and when he engulfed him in a bone crushing hug, he hoped his partner got the message.
Dean scoffed dissatisfied, not liking the direction this conversation was heading to, how it made him feel. His body was trembling as he tried to contain all the words resting on the tip of his tongue. He was about to explode.
The strong fingers dared to travel down to his hips and squeezed the flesh at both sides simultaneously. Dean couldn't help it when his pelvis pushed slightly upwards, towards Castiel's knowing hands. He let his forehead fall down on the mat, automatically his mouth opened sensually, as he took pleasure in Castiel's touches. His own breaths sounded thick to him, filled with lust. He just couldn't help it. Castiel's fingers crawled to his spine and his ribcage, to safer territory; Dean could hear his bones crack, felt, how his muscles warmed up. By the time Castiel was done, Dean was a slackened, boneless puddle of warmth and ease, he couldn't wipe away the satisfied smile on his lips. Damn, Castiel was going to be the death of him. He was glad he had managed to make his growing erection disappear again before he turned around and sat up, looking up into Castiel's face. He was still kneeling in front of him, beholding him with a strange, intense fire burning in his stunning blue eyes. Dean wasn't sure whether his cheeks were reddened due to their workout, or because there was the slightest hope he was appealing to Castiel too. The mere thought made his heart leap into his throat, and he gulped strainedly. If he wasn't mistaken, he was fairly certain he could spot the littlest smile tugging at Castiel's lips too – his blue eyes contained a sweet, soft expression.
"Shut it! You can't drive yet, so you'll have to accept my driving style! Better pay attention to the signals, I think we're only a few miles away."
See you soon? =)
Dean sneaked back into the rehab-center, it was past eleven – thankfully no one noted him, he slipped into his room, unseen by anyone. He was comfortably sated and the remains of his alcohol stupor made him dog-tired. When he sat down on his bed, he picked up his neglected cell phone – there were three missed calls, and all of them were from Sam. Shit, he had totally forgotten about his brother and their rule to phone each day. Dean lay down with a groan and dialed Sam's number, about to apologise to him. He had been so intrigued with Castiel that he hadn't even thought about Sam, though he knew he should have. Sam answered the phone, he sounded upset and fidgety.
Castiel convinced Dean to jog with him through the forest, which ended in Dean complaining and sweating, and Castiel going down on him right there between the trees and shrubberies. Dean, in his stead, made Castiel join him as he trained with his sand bag in the separated shed of the garage. Halfheartedly Castiel tried to imitate Dean's forceful kicks, and though he was good at fist fights, he terribly failed as he tried to kick the sand bag with his shins. At the end of the evening Dean had been crying tears, he was laughing so hard, while Castiel cursed that his legs hurt terribly – finally Dean showed some mercy and fell to his knees, and a few moments later he was sucking Castiel off, making up for his efforts in the most pleasing way.
am in this car, and I really don’t wanna die today. Let me get out first, then you can crash into your wall,” he deadpanned. Dean was amused and annoyed at the same time.
It was in the middle of the night, when Dean woke up with a start. Confused, he tried to come to his senses, wondered what had woken him up. The bright moonlight fell into their bedroom, illuminated the clean-cut features of Cas. His husband was still fast asleep and snoring next to him, undisturbed by whatever it was, that had roused Dean from his sleep. He sat up in bed, rubbed the sleep from his eyes, and listened attentively into the night. There. He heard it again. A muffled sob. Jack! In a heartbeat, Dean got up, rushed barefooted to their son’s room. Ever since Jack was living with them, he had bad nightmares at least once a week. And somehow, even though usually Dean slept like a log, he seemed to have a special radar when Jack needed him. A bomb could have exploded next to him and he would have continued sleeping – but as soon as Jack was crying or anxious, Dean was wide awake.
“Not what I meant, and you know it.”
"Gorgeous yourself", Dean replied and pulled away from Castiel, and now the light in his eyes was less dim. Dean bent forward and tilted his head, his lips aiming at Castiel's; their lids shut and they kissed each other firmly, reassuringly. Their kiss was slow and lengthy, and somewhat innocent due to Castiel's sleepy state. Their mouths slid together, glided over each other, only to press together again and again. It felt like coming home, and Dean's warmth and his unique scent and his gentle kisses were all Castiel had ached for. They let go, quite breathless and overwhelmed. Castiel smiled gingerly and pecked Dean's lips once more.
"I can drive, you know?" he provoked, but Dean just snatched the keys and scowled at his younger brother.
The fantasy of a sheltered life ended the next day – not even three weeks had passed and commotion returned to Dean like a boomerang. When he woke up this Friday morning he could see the pale blue sky outside his window. The fresh green of the arrived spring was lush, even from inside he could hear the loud chirping of the birds nearby. It seemed to become a promising day, the world looked still and halcyon. Castiel was gone as Dean had imagined – he hadn't even heard him leave once he had fallen asleep. He hobbled to the bathroom and showered languidly, allowing himself to reminisce about the last night they had spent together. He still couldn't wash away the touched smile when he had breakfast in the cafeteria. Ash and Garth commented he was unusually quiet this morning, but Dean simply had no words left to express his happiness. He was permeated with a vivid joy to the deepest core of his heart, words would have only cheapened his feelings.
wanted to live in celibacy and deprive the whole world of
“How come you’ve got any keys?” he questioned when Castiel unlocked another door expertly. He didn’t look at Dean, but even in the twilight, Dean recognized the amused grin on Castiel’s mouth.
For a while they played poker and talked lightly – though Dean was itching to show Sam the awesomeness of the common room and all the foosball tables it harbored, he rather wanted to stay in his room and have Sam all to himself for a few hours. He had missed his company, it felt homely to have him back. His usual flowery odor filled the room and comforted Dean more than he would have thought in the first place. That a nervous tension had gotten a hold of him within the last weeks only occurred to him when he perceived it parting from his body. Suddenly it was easier to breathe, a weight had been lifted from his mind. Sam was here, Sam was safe. Though their overall situation didn't look exactly peachy, Dean was glad to be able to have an unerring eye for his younger brother once more. Of course a part of that disconcerting tension remained, because Castiel wasn't at Dean's side twenty-four-seven, but he hoped, together with Sam, they would eventually get the hang of this...
Dean smiled, then bit on his bottom lip pensively. Until now, it had only ever been pipe dreams occupying his mind about leaving St. Louis and actually moving to South Dakota, but that had changed with this phone call. He wondered how quickly he could be transferred to another police station, how quickly he could find an apartment to live in… His to-do list was definitely growing, there was a lot he had to take care of now.
Castiel scoffed and rolled his eyes, then he walked over to Dean and kissed him quickly, but ardently. Dean breathed in the soapy, lemony scent of his husband, felt how it soothed his frayed nerves. Cas let a bit go of Dean, his lips still brushing over Dean’s, as he looked him deeply in the eyes, unfathomable zest for life glowing in his blue irises.
“How can you be so sure, Dean?”
Suddenly, the glass door was torn open and a guy about his age rushed inside, a furious look on his face. He bent down and scrutinized the timetable. Dean watched him attentively, how his shoulders slumped in annoyance. The guy wore a navy blue, thick winter parka, black slacks and way too thin, black Chucks. He was pretty pale, though his cheeks displayed a healthy red because of the cold. His dark hair seemed savage and wild, especially as he ruffled through it angrily.
“That’s balls, Dean, and you know it. Of course, you’re not forgetting about her. But she is dead, son. And you’re not. So, you better enjoy your life and make the best of it. There’s no other option. Except for the car-against-the-wall-thing, but we’ve talked about that enough, haven’t we? Sorry, Dean. Take it from someone who knows best – nobody said it was going to be easy, especially after you’ve lost someone. But you might find happiness again. Just give yourself some time to find your footing again. All right?”
To his big surprise, Castiel suddenly stirred. Dean winced with shock. His eyes widened. Cas was alive! The joy coursing through him was overpowering, felt like electric, warm, pure bliss. With a jittery hand, he wiped the tears away, stared at the miracle in front of him. He watched Cas’ eyelids flutter, how his breathing became deeper and regular. It was then that Dean realized Castiel must have breathed the whole time, but it had been so minimal, he hadn’t caught it.
, John! She was promised to
“My place is here, father. I’m in love with Dean, and I will stand by his side, whether you like it or not.”
Dean swallowed nervously. A huge, aching lump was forming in his throat, took his breath away. Cas had touched a sore spot, and suddenly, Dean felt overwhelmed, helplessly exposed to all those emotions he had tried to run away from. The dam was about to break and its waters were about to drown Dean. He took a deep breath, felt as if he couldn’t get oxygen into his lungs properly, as if he was going to suffocate. All at once, a different emotion awoke within him, fought against this damn feeling of helplessness – it was bordering close on anger, frustration.
With a wink she walked away, leaving Dean and Cas smiling. They chinked their beer bottles together and took a few gulps. Dean had missed the sour, tangy flavor of the only beer brand The Roadhouse had in stock. He let the lemony taste melt in his mouth thoughtfully, wondering how many years had passed since the last time he had consumed this brand. Dean leaned back against the corner booth’s wall with a sigh, enjoying the loose, high-spirited atmosphere all around him. Castiel soon did the same. They drank their beers in silence as they sat side by side, listening to Jo and letting their eyes wander all over the place.
With pent-up desire, he stroked along the inner sides of Castiel’s clothed thighs, feeling the electric wave coursing through his body, how he tensed up with want. It was as if he was unwrapping a gift when Dean dared to undo Castiel’s belt and slowly pull down the fly of his pants. Stunned he watched the thick outline of Castiel’s dick in his cerulean silken briefs. An insatiable hunger suffused Dean, as he let his forefinger stroke along the line of Castiel’s erection gingerly, exerting just the tiniest amount of pressure to pleasure the other man. Castiel inhaled with a hiss, buckling up his hips as an unmistakable invitation to Dean. Dean gulped thickly when their eyes met. The fire within Castiel’s look was all-consuming passion, the need for relief bringing a tortured frown to his forehead. The constant pulsing of hot blood in Dean’s dick was also getting more persistent; he felt his erection twitch impatiently, longing for the same relief Castiel was chasing.
"What the hell are you doing here?" he asked suspiciously, watching Sam scoff unamused.
"I'm not saying I'm a better person or that I'm better than them. After all, I'm sitting in a brothel, being an FBI agent, on top of that", Castiel said and a peaceable smile formed on his pink broad lips as he placed the bottle to his mouth again and looked over to Gabe. He saw a joyful humoured twinkle in Gabe's eyes at that, then his partner was patting his back friendly.
Hello darlings! Are you still around? See at the end for author's notes! This chapter was beta-read by the lovely Angelphoenixwings14, who proofread it thoroughly! Thanks a million times, hun! You keep saying I'm improving, but I must admit I was a bit lazy editing this chapter last time. I'll never grow tired of reading (no comma) or seeing inserted commas XDD
Their breakfast with Bobby was taciturn. Every now and then, Bobby gave Dean meaningful side glances, letting on that he knew trouble was brewing, that something had happened between Dean and Cas. But he was wise enough to remain silent and not ask them about it. When Castiel made ready to leave for work and arrange his imminent absence, Dean accompanied him outside to the porch. Again, Castiel declined Dean’s offer to drive him to work, for he rather wanted to take the bus – something Dean could never understand, for a bus certainly couldn’t compete with his baby.
Dean placed the book aside and lay down on the bed. He closed his eyes and listened to the compositions Castiel was working his way through, how they filled the house with sweet notes… Outside, it started raining, and the rain seemed to accompany Castiel’s music perfectly. A sensation of complete calm grew in Dean, he felt all at ease, while he cherished Castiel’s talent. He could have listened to him forever. After a few songs, Dean got curious, though, and he wanted to see what Castiel looked like when he played, whether his mien was as concentrated as Dean imagined. He longed to witness Castiel’s fingers flying over the ebony and white keys. He got up and left his room, descended the stairs quietly to the living room neighboring the kitchen. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw something was baking in the oven, looking a lot like a version of Shepherd’s pie. He tiptoed to the living room carefully, not wanting to disturb Castiel in his play. The man was sitting in front of the piano, his head a little bowed in concentration, his posture stiff and straight. His eyes quickly fled to Dean’s, acknowledging he was there with a brief nod, then he continued playing.
“Dean? A little break?”
“No, uncle. Your will is my command.”
“Shut up,” he only said, sounding annoyed. Cas frowned. He was not having any of it. He wasn’t the same man Aaron had known, wasn’t going to leave it at that.
“I’m so sorry. I should have listened to you,” he slowly said – his face was a mien of utter misery. Dean’s heart cried out for him, wanted to tell him that it was okay, that he wasn’t mad. Their eyes met, and Jack instantly started crying again, hot tears running down his cheeks. He lunged forward and hugged Dean fiercely, placed his head on Dean’s chest and sobbed into it. Dean and Castiel exchanged worried glances, for they rarely saw Jack this upset. Carefully, Dean touched Jack’s back, rubbed it in a soothing manner while shushing him.
Dean stopped and reflected on his words, inwardly sending prayers to the wounded of the accident. He sure hoped they were going to be alright. Except for the truck’s driver, all of them had survived. It could have turned out worse. He listened to Cas’ next words with closed eyes, they were a boon for his wrecked soul, appeased him.
There was a fondness in his look, meant for Dean alone, that overshadowed his quips. Deeply moved, Dean reached out a hand, held Castiel’s back of the head, and regarded him with a piercing look. He nodded, then, couldn’t convey with words what it meant to him that Castiel understood him, truly saw the essence he was made of.
“So, you know about my private mercy killing activities? I thought it was a secret. How come you know?”
Cas left him a voice message the next evening, thanking him for his gift, obvious glee ringing in his voice. Dean had another migraine attack, as the weather changes of autumn had come. He was pumped with migraine medicine and therefore awfully sleepy, but the feeling of a screwdriver rotating in his brain had lessened a little. He grimaced as he stared at the damn bright screen of his phone and managed to reply to Cas with a short note.
Dean got up and cooked himself some scrambled eggs and coffee. He had already forgotten about his conversation with Cas, as he was currently occupied with writing down a grocery list, as his cell phone vibrated again. He opened it and saw Cas had sent him a photo. Laughing, and in complete shock and rapture, Dean sputtered his coffee all over the screen. Damn it. With his sleeve, he wiped the screen clean and studied the photo with silent, stunned enchantment, his heart tripling its pace. A surge of tickling lust washed through his abdomen, made him half hard. He bit on his lower lip, fought against this growing desire, as he looked his fill. There Cas was, kneeling on his motel room bed, dressed in Dean’s hoodie, which he had pulled down a little. The thing was, he was
Cas let go of Dean for a second, their eyes met, their looks heavy with meaning. With a tilt of his head, Cas beckoned his lover to join him on the bed. He lay down on his side, made room for Dean, who followed him and carefully lay down next to him, mirroring his position. Their bodies found to each other as if by magic as they edged closer. Castiel barely had time to marvel at Dean’s stunning beauty, for when Dean kissed him again, he couldn’t keep his eyes open – they closed, too fraught with lust. Dean’s kisses had turned from impetuous to slow and considerate ones, intense in their depths; it shook Castiel to his core, made him sigh in tormented pleasure, it felt so good. Their hands were all over each other, exploring and appreciating what they found. They kissed and kissed, until Castiel lost every sense of time and space, until there was nothing but ease on his mind. For a while, they made out like this, French-kissing and caressing each other as if they never had to say goodbye, as if this night might last forever.
"You're so fucking sweet", Dean rasped hoarsely, and Castiel's insides thawed at that point. He tried to answer Dean's smile with his own, but felt he could not make his muscles move, he could not think or breathe or do
"Come closer... I promise...ah... I promise I won't do anything", Dean whimpered while his strokes became more manic, firmer. His lids fluttered over and over again, and through half-lidded eyes Dean smiled so sweetly at Castiel that it drove the air out of his lungs. Castiel sat down on the bed somewhat hesitantly and confused, and Dean spread his legs even wider and pleaded Castiel to sit in between them, so that he could look him directly in the eyes. Castiel gulped around a strangling lump of longing and arousal and complied with Dean's wish. The moment he looked down at him, ever so willing and ready for him, his hand stroking his hard length slowly, Castiel felt an indelible thirst drying him up, and he mused Dean was the only water reservoir in a world that resembled a lonely desert. He watched his own trembling fingers, how he placed them on Dean's both inner thighs, and how they started stroking the soft skin up and down. He knew he barely kept himself together, and his defensive wall was coming undone quickly. Castiel wondered where all of this was heading to.
“Shake my hand, Dean.”
meant. Dean surely remembered the words Castiel had said when Aaron had beaten him the last time they had been at this place… He scratched the back of his head as he pondered about injured pride and everybody’s right to make their own mistakes. Who was he to hold back Cas? If anyone deserved retribution, it was him. Dean got up and clapped into his hands once.
At that, Castiel’s eyes met hers, and their look was intense, as hard as a stone. Anna gulped at the fierce determination in his electric blue eyes. She had rarely seen Castiel so serious, so resolved.
“No, ironically enough, she didn’t. It was a warm and dry spring day, I still remember that, and Lisa and I had a day off. We went downtown for some window-shopping and eating out, nothing special. Somehow, we ended up in this infamous area, a neighborhood with a bad reputation. We knew this corner of the town from our patrols and had been there often enough. But on that day, we weren’t really thinking anything about it. There was this Italian fast food restaurant we liked to frequent, and we had lunch there. When we were done and left the restaurant, there was a fight on the street. Just a few thugs in their twenties, some wannabe gangsters, trying to solve an argument with guns. Suddenly there were shots being fired. I didn’t even have time to react. We got into the crossfire of those two gangs. And then Lisa was on the ground. A bullet had hit her in the middle… her shirt was soaked in blood.”
After a long afternoon in Bobby’s yard, fixing broken and old cars in the summer heat, Dean was soaked through with sweat, oil, and grime when he stepped into the noticeably cooler house. He opened the fridge and got himself an icy bottle of beer, gulping the liquid down greedily. He sighed satisfied when he put the bottle down again and looked out of the window. He could still see Bobby in the yard, picking up their tools and cleaning up a little bit. He would soon come inside and they would probably cook a little something. It was awfully quiet in the house. Dean wondered if Castiel was home yet – it was already after five, and usually he was done with his job at half-past four. Dean turned around and inspected the shoe rack in the hallway, finding Castiel’s clean and polished black leather business shoes there, and then he realized Castiel was home already and probably up in his room, brooding as usual.
"Forever, Cas...", Dean mumbled, and Castiel's breath caught. He nodded slowly, then he grinned.
"Oh, look who's talking! It's bizarre, don't you think, hearing that from you? You had no qualms leaving me and dad behind when you ran off to Stanford so carelessly!" Dean spat, though he knew he should better restrain himself, since he was the older brother. He was supposed to be wiser and not let his emotions get to him so immaturely. Stanford had left a gaping wound inside of him, but this pain was almost forgotten – he really didn't want to bear grudges against Sam for the rest of his life. As it was, their lives were apparently short-dated already, they didn't need to complicate things and make them worse because of hurt pride and bygone fights.
“Gesundheit. I have no idea what you’re talking about. What is all this?”
Pure bliss overwhelmed Dean then, as he let Castiel kiss him woozy, his words striking a chord with him. Never before had he loved someone so selfishly, never before had someone loved him this fiercely – no matter the consequences. He wrapped his arms around Castiel’s frame, held him closer, as their kisses deepened. They broke apart, stilled for a second as if they were both gauging the weight of the situation.
The smell of baked potatoes wafted through the air, as they entered Castiel's apartment, and Dean's tummy rebelled for food. When they were inside, he caught a brief insight of Castiel's dwelling. The place looked neat and not too fancy. There were laminate floors everywhere. From the corridor Dean could recognize there were three rooms – the kitchen, the bordering living room and at the end of the apartment there must have been Castiel's bedroom. Castiel pulled off his jacket and held out his hand, so that Dean could give him his hoodie. It was quite warm in the flat, so Dean quickly took off it off and gave it to Castiel. He couldn't help but notice how cosy and familiar it felt, to be in his apartment, about to have dinner with him. In another world, this might have been his alternative lifestyle, and he was definitely not averse to it. Coming home to Castiel sounded appealing...
Castiel bit his bottom lip, perceiving his hard-on throbbing against his black slacks almost painfully; his stature trembled with repressed yearning, his appetite for Dean clouded his mind. However, the intoxication of the intimate moment and Dean's availability impressed Castiel with awe. Of course he wanted to reach out his hand and touch Dean, and he longed for nothing more than his caresses and being near to him; but it also made him speechless and afraid with terror of wanting this so much so soon.
The late afternoon transformed to an early, sunlit evening as Sam drove Dean back to the rehab-center, dropping him off near the park Dean had walked through so many times within the last weeks. He felt the grim mask he was wearing constantly as he waved at Sam driving away and when he turned around and hobbled forwards. His heart's thuds seemed harsh and monotonic, his every motion was robotic. His mind was set on one task only – he was beyond the phase of feeling pain, for the pain did no one good, it came to nothing but more pain. The firmament was a spectacle of golden and pink rays fighting for dominance, the sun was beginning to descend. Dean took a deep breath, steeling his nerves as Castiel's apartment complex came in sight. Only one laughable talk, then everything would be fine again. He just needed to get over with it, then he could return to the life he knew – the life he was supposed to lead. Inside of him, the usually controversial voices didn't even dare to disagree. Dean felt the tiniest ounce of hope – it would be easier when he was determined, when he wouldn't give in to what-if questions.
He parked in front of the coffee shop, his eyes scanning the area suspiciously for anyone looking like Aaron. He frowned when he realized the street in front of the coffee shop was practically dead, absolutely devoid of any passersby. Maybe Aaron had run off already, but that didn’t make any sense if he was actually following Castiel and waiting for him to come out of the coffee shop. A strange presentiment suddenly came to Dean’s mind, nearly made him nauseous with unease:
"While we're on it, holding hands and all, I'd like to know your name at least," he said.
“Okay, I’m in. You can take me larping.”
Sooo, what do you think? Darlings, I'm trying to figure out when to post the remaining 6 chapters... I don't want to shanghai you with them... We're talking about 25 000 more words coming...any suggestions for the intervals in which I should post them? Until then, let me know what you think! Your opinions are always cherished...!
The awkward silence lingered only for a few seconds, then Dean seemed focused and attentive again. He watched Castiel still holding the empty paper cup in his hand; he pointed at it and said “Gimme that”, then he pushed them together and placed the junk on the dashboard. Dean observed Castiel with a scrutinizing look as if he was estimating something secretly.
He sat up, contemplated Cas breathlessly, as his craving for him ate him up from the inside. Quickly he took off his shirt, undressed completely, while he watched Castiel mirroring his movements, getting rid of his shirt as well. When he lay down on him again, their naked, heated bodies touching, skin on skin, it felt like coming home to Dean. Aroused he moaned, hid his face in the crook of Castiel’s neck and inhaled his lemony, soapy scent. It filled up his heart to the brim with a nameless joy he couldn’t quite put his finger on – it was a fleeting sensation, hard to understand and hard to keep, but precious and world-changing. Cas’ erection pressed against Dean’s, his precum bedewing Dean’s abdomen. Dean felt himself pulsate against Cas, his cheeks blushing hotly at the prospect of being inside of him again. Wordlessly, he touched Cas’ shoulder and sat up a little, made him turn around on his stomach gently. With reverence, he studied Cas’ back, his prominent shoulder blades, his lean ribcage, the dimples of his hips, right above the perfect curve of his ass…
He flopped down unceremoniously beside Castiel, rolling on his side immediately; Castiel mirrored his movements mutely. For a tense moment they studied each other's face, examining the change and the rumination taking place behind the carnal mantle. At some point, Castiel sat up briefly and carpeted them with a soft duvet, hiding their naked bodies somewhat. A subtle smirk loomed on his pink lips and Dean felt light-headed, overwhelmed with confusing emotions. Then Castiel took his right hand gently in his, intertwining their fingers. It was impossible to tear his eyes away from Castiel, Dean was tantalized by his hauntingly ethereal beauty. It pleased Dean beyond imagination that he had given relief and love to the barely smaller man; he could read in the expression of his blue gems how much their intercourse had meant to him. At this thought, Dean shuddered lightly because his heart boomed swiftly inside him, screaming at him how much it had mattered to him too. His throat corded up with overflowing joy and Castiel squeezed his hand mildly, his smile became mellow.
"Listen, Cas... I want to see you too, okay? I really want to... but, I've got to work this weekend, like every weekend. I don't know how or when-"
"Busted, I'm twenty. Went to a frat party of a friend, they were all too pissed to drive me anywhere. I live far off their house, go to a different college."
It was Dean's turn to nod; he tried to burn Castiel's appearance into his mind before he would leave. He never wanted to forget how affectionate his words sounded, raspy and thick with emotions. How his eyes sparkled, bursting with life and an ineffable joy, which made Dean antsy and utterly cheerful.
"Fun facts seem dangerous", he deadpanned, "let's hear some hard data."
"Uhm, Cas... I guess that's not a flashlight in your jeans, right?" he joked breathlessly, still wrapped up in the dark-haired man's arms. His arms were resting on Dean's chest and waist in the most comfortable way, Dean enjoyed the little weight on his body. There was a light kiss pressed against his temple, he could actually sense the smile on Castiel's lips as they halted on his skin.
hit on someone, who has just gotten out of an abusive relationship. The guy needs time to get over this, to process what has happened to him. The last thing he needs right now is another man trying to get into his pants. And yeah, I know you, that’s why I’m telling you to stop thinking with your dick!” Sam scolded him, making Dean smile a lopsided smile.
