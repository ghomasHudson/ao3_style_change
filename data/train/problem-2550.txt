“Not fucking again you won’t.” Dean replied, “I ain’t losing you again, man.” he pulled back smiling at him, and whispered, “We’ll talk more later, they saw that, let my saying what I gotta be just for us, okay? But… You
He looked around, seeing more things he could recognize, laughing at the bone with a bow around to represent Miracle, which Sam said the dog could have when they took the tree down, since it was from the pet store and edible.
Next he noticed a pair of wolves and three wolf cubs, an old timey lookin’ tv with a dollar store mustache sticker stuck on it, two crowns, sat a bit apart, one all red gems, the other clearly sharpied in with black.
“Make you? I bet you’ll ban them from the kitchen…” Claire teased, “But alright, we’ll call all of you tomorrow. And listen… I can see that tower of books behind you, don’t focus too much on looking through them tonight, okay?”
Dean rubbed his thumb on Cas’ cheek, “Awesome.” he muttered as he leaned in closer, dropping his hand off the one that was over Cas’, shifting a bit, causing Cas’ hand to move lower on his arm just a bit
“Being asked by a former angel to cuddle,” Dean laughed, “The me who first met you would never believe this.” he said as he got in beside Cas, getting comfortable, turning toward him, who turned fully toward Dean as well, and moved closer.
“I… I convinced myself it was impossible for angels to feel that the same way humans can. It was stupid, and I knew better, but it was easier to pretend that. Easier than admitting that part of myself. Easier than letting myself hope. Again, I am so sorry Cas.”
“Secular celebrations are common too, you know,” Sam pointed out, before heading back up the steps, “I’m going to get the box with the tree from the car.”
Dean placed his free hand on Cas’ side, the one on Cas’ cheek pulling Cas even closer to him, “Going to also do this as much as you allow me to.” he whispered, meeting Cas in the middle right as his eyes closed.
Dean nodded, finally, reluctantly, stepping away from Cas. He had stopped crying, for now, and moved to hug Jack, giving Sam time to come over as well.
“Alright, I can do that,” Cas said as he took the spoon Dean was stirring with, letting Dean show him. “Also, you have no reason to be shy about affection from me now, Dean Winchester.”
“Exactly, and I am working with Rowena to change how the souls there are punished, and what qualifies as deserving to be there as well.” Jack explained, “But Heaven is sorted, and I have no further requests for Cas’, and now we’re here.”
“Sammy, I’ve got it, Eileen already made the stuff she wanted and had you help, I’ve got this. I can handle cooking.” Dean rolled his eyes, “I’ve told you, don’t babysit me or whatever it is that you’re doing.”
Dean slammed his fist into the side of one of the shelves, “Shut the fuck up, Sam. He’s fucking gone
He shook his head and sat up, rubbing the sleep out of his eyes before he reached over and pet Miracle, who was asleep on the edge of his bed.
“You sure you don’t want help with something, Dean?” Sam asked after wandering into the kitchen for the fifth time, “We don’t mind helping you.”
Dean leaned in the last remaining centimeters and pressed his lips to Cas’. Gentler than his comments before would have made it seem it would be, but lasting only a few seconds before pulling away, and finally smiling at Cas, before wrapping his arms around him in a hug.
Cas smiled back and entered the room, “I think it’s safe for me to admit after I learned more about humans, your shock at my appearing did always amuse me.”
“Yeah well,” Dean muttered, looking away for a moment, “I’m not used to it yet, or whatever. Besides, we still need to talk together, set some things right. I want to make sure we’re completely on the same page here, man.”
“Shut up…” he muttered but laughed, “You deserved to at least know it wasn’t one sided or something, but-” Dean paused and sighed, “We do need to sort it all out after we eat. Jack still here right?”
“Nah, you two be all cute and domestic and decide what goes where, I’m sure it’ll look nice.” he shrugged, picking his books up from the table, “I’m going to go look through these or watch something on the laptop until lunch, or whatever.” he said, still trying his best to sign what words he could.
He laughed sadly at the Princess Leia ornament with a D20 glued in her hands, knowing it was to represent their Charlie, but he knew if he looked long enough he’d find ones to represent their other Charlie and Stevie.
“I sensed he was there the moment I had Chuck’s power, but I didn’t know what all I could do at that point, or if Cas would want to come back to earth, so I didn’t say anything to you when I left.” Jack explained. “I do want to stay hands off on earth, but I wanted to give him that option.”
“I’m holding up by not giving up,” Dean said sullenly, taking a large sip of the beer he had by the table. “You don’t worry about it, and enjoy your first holiday with Kaia, alright? Which I’m going to let you go do. Sam and Eileen will be back with the last few things soon before they make me cook.”
He was pissed off at himself, for everything. For rushing in after Billie and taking Cas with him, for not being able to stop him, for not--, for being unable to find
Dean sighed, “Guess we’re decorating then. But i can’t promise I’m buying either of you anything. The only one in this place that didn’t spring it on me is the dog.” He halfheartedly complained… right as Miracle wandered in and laid his head in Eileen’s lap. “Nevermind, he’s a traitor in this too.”
waiting for him so I can yell at him for being so stupid!” He stormed back off to the Impala, not noticing the white suit and kind eyes, standing near the trees, because blink and it was gone.
He noticed other things as well, a couple trucker caps, clearly meant to represent both Bobbys, the one they lost and the one currently on a rogue werewolf hunt in Nevada. A mother and son decorating a tree, a representation of Kevin and his mom.
Both brothers’ eyes widened at Eileen calling their names, hearing urgency in her voice, and dropped everything, running out to the main room.
“Sam saw me and laughed,” Cas glared lightly, but the corner of his lip was clearly giving away he wanted to laugh also. “Said to tell you good night.”
Dean nodded, subconsciously letting his hand follow Cas’ and lay on top of his, “Right, good. Now onto what you said. I’m calling bullshit on saying what you needed to say being enough. Maybe it was enough for the Empty, but I don’t think it’s enough for you, and it sure as hell ain’t for me. You changed me too, you know that?”
They eventually separated, opening their eyes, but stayed very close just smiling at each other. “Can’t believe I was stupid enough to not let myself have this for so long.” Dean whispered again, not wanting to break the moment. “To have what I am sure is to happen between us in the near future as well.”
“So all our loved ones are together, and when we die we can meet all of them?” Eileen asked with a smile, “I’d get to see all my parents and not just a memory.”
Claire rolled her eyes, then pulled Kaia down to whisper something, kissing her cheek, to which Kaia nodded and walked away, and Claire looked back at the screen. “Alright, sentimental honest time. How are you holding up?”
“We would have both died anyway, you made it out and helped save the universe.” Cas finally replied, “I know you would have done the same. And I’d have done it a million times over.”
Dean continued to drive around after that for a few hours, stopping only once to get gas. He grabbed whatever random fried food the gas station was offering that day, fully prepared to get home late and avoid eating and talking with Sam and Eileen.
They both drifted off, matching smiles on both their faces, ready for not just the best Christmas they’d ever known, but also for the start of the rest of their lives happy and finally at each other’s side.
He waved to them over his shoulder after turning to walk towards his bedroom, Miracle getting up and following him.
“That’s amazing!” Sam chimed in, “So how exactly did you change it? Are all the doors basically unlocked now?”
“FUCKING DAMN IT!” Dean finally yelled out, checking his pocket for his keys and storming toward the garage, shrugging Sam off when he tried to reach for Dean to stop him, “Going for a fucking drive.”
Because standing at the other end of the room, near their tree, were Jack and Castiel, The former of which was signing to Eileen, the latter already looking up, probably at Dean’s words, eyes locked on him.
“Well, maybe a little.” she shrugged, “Not many hunts now, and people that do what we do don’t get many chances to celebrate with their family and friends. We thought it would be nice. He also talked to Jody who said she and Donna are planning the same with the girls.”
“Of course Dean. If you hadn’t asked, I would have,” Cas said with the honesty Dean had only ever seen his former angel capable of.
It was simple, a little wooden ornament with wings, and it was clear that Sam had carefully painted it, a tan coat, a blue tie and blue eyes and dark brown hair.
“JACK! You listening up there, or wherever the hell you are?” Dean screamed into the open park. “I don’t know what you’re doing, or if you are trying to bring him back, or if that idiot isn’t letting you, or what. BUT DAMN IT YOU GET HIM BACK HERE NOW! Seven months since that asshole sacrificed himself because of you and I.”
He trailed off, glaring at his brother when he saw he was at a loss for words, “Don’t. Don’t tell me to try to be happy, I will be when he’s back. All I can do is research, and continue begging Jack to fix it.”
“Yes, he plans to stay for a few days, everything is in order. Well… minus Hell. However Rowena said he’s not allowed to bother her until the New Year. I don’t know if he’ll stay that long, however I did convince him that visiting us is still fine and doesn’t stop him from taking a step back in a good way.”
“For what? You planning on throwing a party or something?” Dean asked while he started plundering through the bags. “The hell did you get Christmas decorations for? We ain’t normally the type to decorate, Sammy. Pretty sure what we did a few months ago banned us from celebrating anyway.”
This time it felt much more important than the one in front of their family. This kiss was for them, the first of many that was just for them. Dean pressed more into it, sliding his hand to the back of Cas’ neck, shivering a bit as Cas did the same, causing them to both be even closer. And Dean couldn’t help but grin at the little growl like rumble Cas made when Dean nipped at his lip.
“Right, well Dean, you cooked, and got up constantly while we were eating to check your pie. So Eileen and I will clean up,” Sam said to interrupt them just a bit, “Jack, why don’t you come talk with us while we do? We’d love to learn more about what you’re doing.”
They got it down the stairs, and Eileen had moved a few chairs out of the way to make room amongst one of the many shelves and the wall for the tree.
“What did I tell you about being stupid?” he laughed through his tears into Cas’ neck as Cas’ arms wrapped around him as well.
Maybe he was pissed at every damn thing that had ever happened in his life that to him storming off after crying over a stupid little Christmas ornament.
“I knew it, I told Sam you did it on purpose, you little shit,” he shook his head, but motioned for Cas to come over. “You’re in here, help me sort out the rest of this. Grab something to eat if you're hungry.”
Dean just rolled his eyes, “Yeah, I know, thank you for reminding me.” he teased as he stood up, grabbing a t-shirt and while silently laughing, his hot dog pajama pants, and tossed them to Cas, “You can borrow my stuff until we can get to a store. Which is at least two days, I ain’t taking you shopping on ‘return bad gifts’ day. I’ll get changed in here while you head to the bathroom.
“We rebuilt Heaven,” Jack smiled even more brightly, “It’s more like earth now instead of just memories. I had the power to do it, but Cas has spent more time around humans so I wanted his advice on it all.”
“‘At the moment’ he says…” Dean huffed to himself, “Cas, I can’t tell if you said that to tease me, or because you’re you, but come on, man.” he laughed a bit. “Okay, sit down.” he added as he sat on the edge of his bed.
“Im not too late am I?” Cas asked, his voice rougher than usual from the cold, sending shivers down Dean’s spine.
Dean sat at his desk going over his homework, school was over for the day and now he was holed up in his hot dormitory trying to get through his science homework for call tomorrow. Cas, his dorm-mate, was nowhere to be found. But if Dean had to guess, Cas was probably hiding in the library like the little nerd he was.
"And I know you’re probably tired of modelling, but I was wondering if you’d model privately for me, and now that I’m asking it seems like a terrible idea… s-sorry…”
“I think you should know Dean,” Crowley snorted, shifting out of his leaning position so he could use the umbrella to point, Dean followed the direction he was pointing, only to find himself outside his childhood home.
“Why did you go seven months without telling me the whole story,” Sam said after a moment, and damn it the hurt in his voice got to Dean.
“Jack is the back up plan if we don’t figure it out. I will try other things until he fixes it,” Dean glared a bit again, causing Sam to hold up his hands in defeat.
“Goodnight, and I will, the first of many good nights as long as we’re her together,” Cas responded in just as low of a whisper and kissed the top of Dean’s hair, “I love you too, Dean.”
Granted, Dean had only vaguely explained to Sam, one night when both were a bit drunk, what the bullshit deal with the Empty had been.
“No.” Cas cut him off, “No, my grace was disappearing anyway, within a year I would have been human no matter what, so do not start blaming yourself for this. If I hadn't had to enact the deal, then I would have spent the time still helping Jack, until my grace ran out. I would have still become human, and I would have still ended up here, arguably slightly less happy.” he smiled at him, and Dean understood what he meant.
He moved again, placing his other hand on Cas’ cheek, “You said I’m why you care, and I think that’s part of it, but only because we taught each other free will, and now we’re both truly, completely free. We can sit here for days and do nothing but take Miracle on walks. We can hop in Baby and just travel wherever the hell we want.”
“One of the first things you said to me was that I didn’t think I deserved to be saved, and you were right. And maybe sometimes I still feel that way, and I never want you to be the one to do the saving again, but I know now that I do deserve it. We all deserve it. But that’s not all you taught me. You taught me faith, not in everything, but in family, you taught me to pray to the ones I know will listen, you, and now Jack.”
Cas looked at the pants, then at Dean and just raised an eyebrow, “you picked these to be annoying.” he commented as he stood up to go get changed, stopping to kiss Dean again, “I’ll be right back.
He’d just shoved another useless book across the map table, cursing under his breath as he did, when he heard the door open.
Sam was in front, and Dean almost ran into him with how sudden he’d stopped. “What the hell Sam?” he hissed, wondering why he’d stopped when there was possible danger. He pushed past his brother to see what was going on, and…
He shook those thoughts as he got back to the main room of the Bunker. He couldn’t help but smile a bit, seeing all the hard work Sam and Eileen had put into decorating.
Dean blushed when Sam explained the items of the tree, glaring at all of them to not mention his break down, including Jack, who he’d broken down to about it. “Should we get a new one for you though Cas? No wings now and all.” he added hoping that would make the others not want to bring it up.
“Dammit, Jack… you said you’d be hands off.. But please kid, please be doing something about this,” he said to possibly no one, possibly his son, who the hell knew at this point.
“This isn’t about sympathy, even though we could all use it from each other right now.” Sam assured him, “But you do need to talk about it. You’ve been looking through lore books constantly, you won’t go to the room where it happened. And now you were full on crying over an ornament to represent him.”
Seven months and he’d not found even the start of a clue, not heard anything from Jack, who maybe couldn’t do anything anyway, what did Dean know, but damn it he was going to try.
“Now, if you aren’t done talking emotions, go find your girlfriend and be sappy with her,” he said as he got up, “I’m going to bed.”
So of course when he finally got back to the Bunker around midnight, Sam was sitting at the map table, clearly waiting on him, if the look on his face was anything to go by.
Now that he looked at the tree, knowing what their theme had been, a few items stood out. The first thing he saw a little scene with a woman and two small children, a sad smile reaching his lips as he thought of their mom.
“I’m not, Dean. It’s just a lot, and I want to help if you need it,” Sam frowned, “Think of my helping as a Christmas gift if you need to.”
“So… If I’m understanding all of this right,” Dean began, and pointed at Cas, “You are human now? You said your grace is in the Empty, but also you’re here and alive.”
His fist was still clenched against the shelf, and he pressed harder against it, “His happiness… was telling me he loved me before he died. He wanted to make sure I knew. Claimed that’s all he needed to say, and then the Empty came and he was gone. So yeah, what he wanted all this time, because I call bullshit on that being all, as far as I see it, was for him and I to be happy. But he didn’t think that was possible… he didn’t, doesn’t know that-”
“And we missed you too, kid,” Dean told Jack, stepping back so Sam could take a turn. “But why the hell didn’t you ever answer me, and why did it take so long to fix this?” he asked, gesturing to Cas’ as the ‘this’ but smiled when he looked over at him again.
Dean led Cas to his room, making it clear that it was because it was the only place he wouldn’t feel like he was being watched, “Don’t think too much of it.”
“Yeah, whatever, later.” Dean muttered, whispering “thanks” before cutting the connection, then grabbed Miracle’s leash, “Come on boy, let's get a walk before they get back.”
He checked the time on his phone, realizing it was way too early for him. He knew there was no going back to sleep, so he got up, maneuvering through the stacks of books and beer bottles on his floor, and headed for the kitchen.
Dean had been in his room for a few hours reading through books, and taking breaks to pet Miracle when the dog demanded it. He knew there wasn’t anything he would find, but he had to try. He knew it… but he wasn’t going to give up.
“Yeah… alright… still pissed the kid didn’t come tell us that was the plan,” Dean huffed, glancing at Jack, who was smiling also, so Dean just sighed. “Anyway, here,” he said as he grabbed the laptop from the table, “Call Claire. She needs to know you’re safe.”
Dean just shook his head, “He’ll never appreciate those pants.” He stood up and walked over to Cas, pulling him into a hug, and kissing the side of his face. “Come on, let's go to bed. I don’t know what side you liked best or whatever, so you decide.”
He fixed himself coffee, taking water and food to Miracle’s bowl, before heading to the main room, knowing Sam was due back from Eileen’s soon, and figured he could say hi since he was up anyway. If he grabbed a few of the lore books from his floor after filling the dog’s bowl, that was his business, and he’d ignore whatever damn pitying look Sam would give him when he caught him looking through them again.
“I have nothing either, Dean, however,” Cas started, smiling at him, “I think it’s okay if this year, just being able to sit beside each other like this is our gift. I don’t need anything more.”
Dean, and well probably Jack since Dean had prayed to him a lot, was the only one that fully knew what went down.
Dean had been cooking awhile, having laughed when heard Claire yell at Cas through the computer screen. He knew she'd tell him off too, and he deserved it, no matter how noble the act was.
Castiel nodded, lifting his hands so he could sign it to Eileen as well, “When the Empty took me, only what was left of my grace went with it, and my soul went to heaven. That’s where Jack found me, and asked for help.”
“No, it’s open, with homes and land and cities, just like earth. It’s not the same, both bigger and smaller, but it’s peaceful and not a loop. I couldn’t make people immortal, so I did the best thing I could think of.”
“Yeah, right here man.” Dean called as he looked over, “What’s with the shopping bags? There better be food in there.” He complained, before signing and saying “Hello, good to see you.” to Eileen. Yes, she could read their lips well, but she was part of his little brother’s life now, it felt rude not to try learning.
Cas nodded, replying softly, “Of course Dean, I never expected any answer at all, and you’ve always spoken through actions.”
“Well the obvious first thing I need to say still scares the hell out of me, so give me a minute on that,” Dean said as he shifted his sitting position a bit to look at Cas better. “So let's start with the other crap you said and did. I don’t care how you rationalized it, I don’t care that after seven months it was all okay.”
“Yes, I’m human now, and based on my body, I’d guess a year or two older than yourself, Dean,” Cas explained, “It means I will die again, but I’ve seen what’s after, and everyone has said they’re waiting on me, and for all of you, but it had better be a long time from now.”
Dean rubbed his temples, “Damn it, stop. You and you sit down. I’m getting everyone beers, and making sure my food isn’t burning. Then you can explain.” he ordered as he went, walking faster than he’d admit to any of them later, not wanting Cas out of his sight for long.
I’m pressured into an uncomfortable position, everyone staring at me like I’m for lunch. but not Dean.
“She won’t, because she knows… never mind, are you okay? You were just raped after all,” Castiel asked, looking Dean up and down.
Dean smiled nicely at the beautiful girl who sat next to him on a picnic blanket, his car hiding them from view from anyone else. It was the first time in a while any girl at the school had agreed to a date with him, not that it mattered; all he wanted was a good fuck. And this new girl was just what he needed. She was very pretty, dark hair and blue eyes, just his type. He knew his baby brother Sam and his best friend Cas would kill him for this. But it’s not like the girl is a virgin! She told the most popular girls she had a boyfriend and they did it on several occasions. But they broke up, so it’s fine to have sex with her. He’s not taking anything, just enjoying… right?  “S-so Dean, I heard you have a brother,” Sarah blushed, looking away from the green eyed boy in front of her. Dean merely leaned closer, gently placing a hand on the girl’s thigh.
“Why?” Dean scoffed, watching his brother as he welcomed more, people into his home – this time they were Benny and his wife. Then two out of three of Gabriel’s brothers Lucifer and Samandriel, with their respective partners Michael and Adam. Next came in Kevin – one of Sam’s collage friends and possibly the smartest guy Dean knew. People began to mingle quietly, making Dean think everyone was there. Charlie and Dorothy were sitting on the floor by the tree, snuggling under a bright red blanket, drinking the eggnog Gabriel had forced on them. Lucifer, Michael, Samandriel and Adam were squished onto the couch together, drinking eggnog after Gabriel had done the same to them. Kevin was curled up on a chair alone, drinking cocoa and laughing at the story Gabriel was telling in the most dramatically Gabriel way he could manage. And Sam sat on the other single seat, facepalming but laughing at his husband.
“Did you now sweetie?” Mary replied, plastering on a fake smile and talking to her son with fake enthusiasm.
“God can you two get any sappier?” Crowley gagged, “why did you two ever break up? You seemed so happy with him.”
“Morning my l-pet,” Castiel said just as groggy, almost slipping up and admitting he was in love with the sixteen year old, looking down his chest at the green eyed beauty.
“Shut up,” Dean grumbled. The hand – Cas’ hand – trailed up to Dean’s waistline, stopping for Cas to silently ask for consent. Dean nodded, moving a hand over his mouth to stifle any gasps or moans as the hand infiltrated his underwear, bringing his hard member into view as Cas’ other hand brought out Cas’ equally hard cock. Dean’s eyes went wide at the sight of Cas’ hand wrapping around both cocks, his other arm coming up to rest near Dean’s head to keep him from falling on top of him. Cas’ hand slid up and down the two erect phalluses, coating both in a mixture of both men’s leaking pre.  Dean’s breaths shallowed even more as Cas gripped them a little tighter, not tight enough to hurt either of them, but holy fuck if he said it didn’t feel good he would be lying. “Cas,” Dean choked out, leaning his sweaty forehead on Cas’ shoulder as the darker haired male continued to stroke their erections.
The pair turned around to find Castiel standing about two feet away, brows furrowed and eyes darting between the two. He wore a stunning dark blue suit that brought out his eyes, and a corsage in one hand, no doubt to give to the female. In hindsight, Dean thought he probably should have gotten one as well.
“I’m not healed enough to swim out that far just yet. Sun damage alone takes a long time to recover from, but the other injuries don’t help. I thought I might as well stick around. Besides,” Dean reached behind him and showed off a nice sized fish, “I brought you breakfast. Or, lunch, seeing as it’s the afternoon.”
Dean smirked, going back to petting Cas’ hair. Dammit, Cas didn’t even have to wash his hair by conventional means, and yet he managed to keep the dark strands so soft. It smelled nice, too. Normally Dean would hate waking up with hair near his nose, but now he couldn’t help breathe in that subtle wildflower scent every morning. Was it weird? It probably was. Dean didn’t care, everyone could go suck it, in his opinion.
“No we won’t,” Dean assured him. “I’ve stopped the bleeding, for both of us, but I can’t fully heal either of us. We won’t attract sharks, but we will die if we don’t find land for you soon. I’m doing all I can to hold you up.”
The navigator nodded, earning a nod in return. He was about to return to his work, when Dean’s eyes widened, mouth open to issue a warning.
“Nope. You might be like that to some people, but to me, you’re like this awkward little… I don’t know, puppy, I guess.”
There was movement, and suddenly, he was pulled up to his knees again. Chuck grabbed Castiel’s chin with force, the polite mask starting to crack. The captain studied his former navigator’s face.
Honestly, Dean wasn’t surprised. He thought he smelled cinnamon as well, but that could have just been from the pie he ate earlier. Not that he minded the addition. Sweetness and spice. Angel and hunter. Each calling the other.
Captain Shurley hummed in thought, before pushing himself off the wall. Despite the swaying of the ship, he managed to move as if the ground were perfectly still.
The handsome newcomer reared his head back and laughed, as if Castiel had told him the funniest joke in the world. How was it that sunshine was able to be encapsulated into one sound?
“No, it’s not like Dean Winchester would care at all about how people think, or feel. It’s not like you would give a damn about who actually cares. You give no thoughts to the possibility that someone out there might actually have genuine feelings for you. That someone might actually love you!” Tears streamed from Cas’ eyes, but he didn’t care enough to wipe them away. Anger tore through him like a blazing sword. “Dammit, Dean, three years! Three years I’ve known you, and you think I’m losing control now just because of some stupid change to your appearance? No! I started falling when we agreed to let down our walls for each other. I kept falling when, even when you pushed me away. Every time it was just the two of us, I wanted to hold you and comfort you, and tell you every little thing right in this world, when all you saw was the worst of it. I fell hard for who you are, not for who you present yourself as, and it’s only these past few months that that attraction has gotten physical. But no, you wouldn’t see that. No, you-” Castiel ran his hands through his hair and gave a humourless laugh. “Where did you think this night was going to go, Dean? I said no because in the end, you baited me, and tomorrow morning, you would have thrown me out just like another one of your damned one night stands!”
Cas smiled. He closed his eyes as the handkerchief passed over them, and kept them closed as Dean moved the cloth further down his face. Soon, the thin fabric was replaced with Dean’s calloused palm on his cheek, and Castiel found himself leaning into the touch. He felt the thumb brush over his cheekbone, felt the roughness of the skin of Dean’s palm as he turned to kiss it.
“It is, as clear as it can be. The cargo will be safe.” Their recent bounty from a merchant ship was, indeed, something to treasure.
Or, at least, Castiel did, though he wouldn’t know. It never crossed his mind that Dean would be looking anywhere else, let alone at him.
“I, uh, you- you could say that- I mean, not to brag, but you- feel free to say that anytime ‘cause you… can.” Smooth, Dean. Real smooth. Castiel only laughed the awkwardness off.
The sky was already lightening when they reached the island. Castiel must have dozed off twice on the journey there, but Dean made sure to wake him up each time. Staying awake was important.
And though Dean had returned to deeper waters for the moment, his absence didn't bother the human. Dean had all but promised to return, without saying the words ("I still don't make promises, Cas.")
The door to the room clicked open, and in an instant, Dean had put some distance between himself and the angel, including letting go of his hand. Cas secretly lamented the lost touch, but had to put it aside as Sam walked into the room, a nurse appearing right behind him.
Dean couldn't contain, or even accurately explain, the giddy feeling that was washing over him in that moment. This wasn’t real, no way was this real, but here he was. Here they were. Dean couldn’t stop the tears of joy forming in his eyes, but in all honesty, he didn’t want to stop them. This day… it was a dream come true.
Cas couldn’t argue with that logic. After he agreed, Dean held him bridal-style once more, already used to Cas nuzzling his head into the crook of the merman’s neck.
One of the tasks Cas needed help the most with was replacing the dressing on his wounds. He allowed Dean to get into the routine of it without any fuss. Besides, it was almost cathartic watching Dean work, feeling his hands work deftly, even against the sore skin.
“Wait, Dean, where are we going?” Cas asked, worry lacing his voice as the hunter dragged him out of the door.
It was like uncovering a treasure, the way Dean pulled each wrapping away so reverently. Both males were relieved to find that everything from the torso upwards was formed correctly; the gills, the smaller fins, the talons and fangs, they were all perfect.
They reached the summit in the early hours of the afternoon, warm sunlight mingling with a cool wind that quickly dried off their sweat. Below the couple, a valley dense with vegetation sprawled almost elegantly out, like a rich velvet carpet that had been carefully gathered. A ribbon of cool river water flowed in between the creases, shining wonderfully in the light.
“On the contrary, my dear Novak.” Dean pulled away and whipped out a handkerchief from his back pocket, which he used to carefully wipe Cas’ face. “I intend to hold onto that promise ‘til my dying day.”
Dean watched this man, who had only known him for a day, start cutting the ropes of the fishnet. He waited for it to be a joke. It wasn’t. Surprise turned to astonishment, even suspicion, but overwhelmingly, there was profound gratitude.
There was a moment where everything was frozen on deck. Then, slowly, all eyes turned to the source of the surprising outburst: Castiel. The most unnerving gaze, though, was the captain’s. The navigator had seen that kind of look before. It was a hungry look, one that only a man lusting after gold would wear. He had seen it before, many times, and never dared to speak against it.
A familiar voice. An anchor, before I spiral off too deep into my own thoughts. I turn to see Dean peeking his head in through the doorway, worry and curiosity mingling into one facial expression. His eyes flick from me on the edge of my bed, to the small candle on my bedside table. I see the understanding on his face; he knows about my little ritual, so to speak.
It all happened after a seemingly normal dinner. Cas had cooked pasta, as was their usual unofficial tradition on a Friday night. Dean volunteered to wash up, which left the other man to stow away any leftovers. Only, the simple task was taking a little longer than planned. Things had gotten worse. He couldn’t stop staring at Dean. Bit by bit every day, Castiel was losing control, and he wondered if maybe this was the night where it all just fell apart. Maybe… maybe that wouldn’t be so bad.
“Dean.” The confession was quiet, but not at all thoughtless, nor uncalculated. “My human name is Dean.”
When no response came from the merman soon after, Castiel glanced over to make sure he hadn’t left (or that the wrong words hadn’t been said). Instead, he found Dean sitting in the surf, a mixture of wonder, shock, and contemplation on his face. It made Cas feel something he could only describe as mellow pride.
Dean, in turn, explained how navigation under the sea was less about sight. Rather, it was a feeling, a result of generations of memories being kept alive in skin and blood. It was how whales and turtles knew where their feeding grounds were, and how they could go back to their exact birthplaces.
To say Cas was confused would be an understatement. Chuck’s ship was now a small speck in the distance; there was no telling whether that was an indication of how much time had passed, or how far Dean had swum with Castiel in his arms. The waters were freezing, Cas knew this, but for some reason he wasn’t shivering. And his wound…
By now they were face to face, faces only inches apart. Dean quickly glanced at Cas' lips, and caught the other man doing the same.
“Cas, you’re my hope. Sam may keep me living, but you’re the one who actually makes feel alive. You’re my priority, and you should never, ever, be so used to having anyone walk all over you like that. Even if- no, especially if that person is me. You’re my hope,” Dean repeated, his hold on Cas’ hand tightening. “I can’t lose you in any way.”
“Thanks, but I think I’ve already had enough fun for tonight.” He clinked his glass against the Winchester’s, and winked. “Why don’t you go by yourself instead, handsome?”
Cas hummed and continued to display his affection. At the corners of Dean's eyes, along his cheekbones, the corners of his smile, and along the man's jawline. Dean tilted his head up on instinct, and felt Castiel's lips graze his neck, an act which widened his smile.
“Come on, think of it this way. For once, you don’t have to rob an entire liquor store just to get drunk!”
The former was handsome, with a fit physique to match. His bright green eyes, freckles, full lips and spectacular jawline, were the gossip highlights of the school. Dean was a marvel at baseball, a wonder at football, and everyone’s dream highschool hunk. The fact that he kept mainly to himself only added to the boy’s charm.
Like Cas said, it was Dean’s idea to go on a hike. At first the former angel had raised an eyebrow at the suggestion (“I never thought you were one for hikes,”) but Dean insisted.
“I should have listened to you. I should- I should have stopped and made sure you were ok, not drag you out hunt after hunt after hunt.”
They reached waist-high water before the crew members decided it was far enough. Raphael was far too eager to be the one who held down Castiel’s head, while the other two maneuvered his battered body. Cas thoroughly refused to let this be his end, but a part of him knew, denial would only get him so far.
Of course, neither man could go to sleep early that night. Castiel in particular kept tossing and turning, eventually resigning himself to staring up at the ceiling, a faint smile on his face.
Oh, if Dean had the courage, he would have opened up to Cas a long time ago. He would have already known what Cas’ lips felt like from memory, already held the angel in his arms, showering affection without shame. But courage failed him. Over and over and over again, just when they get so close, something happens. Majority of the time, Dean had only himself to blame. Why couldn’t he be better?
There was always something about finding a case closer to home that made the boys sigh in relief. Yes, having a monster nearby wasn't ideal, but on the other hand, there's no need for long road trips. No need to check into a motel, no need to scout the area to find potential exits, no need to form escape plans before actually digging into the case at hand. Everything was within easy reach. Everything was as familiar as the routine of the hunt.
If this was hell, then Castiel supposed his punishment was to relive his failure over and over again. Every element of his last conversation with Dean creeped around his mind, like vines over an abandoned house. Sometimes they would creep a little more than usual, leaving Cas paralysed in the middle of a task, his eyes open but unseeing.
“Whoa!” Dean caught an armful of dark bed hair and bright smiles as Cas slid into him. “Easy, tiger.”
Dean’s rambling only ceased when Cas threw his arms around the merman. There was nothing holding him back anymore; no walls, no tasks, no immense pride or stubbornness. As soon as he felt Dean reciprocate the touch, Castiel began sobbing. The weight of every day without Dean, every moment he struggled, and what he almost lost, it all crashed into him. The lights vanished once more with the distressed sounds, but Cas didn’t care.
That statement sent a glowing warmth through Cas’ core, causing him to blush and look away. As a result, he didn’t see the first piece of kelp to be pulled away from, what used to be, his legs.
Novak turned away from his 4th grade class, and flashed his signature smile at the kids, plus the bumbling adult they were dragging behind.
Dean spent that entire night lying awake, tossing and turning Cas’ confession in his mind. He always knew his love was meant to live on the sea, but the prospect of Cas living
“I forgot you can’t see that well underwater,” the merman said, amused. His voice was somehow clearer below the surface than above it. “Especially at high speeds. Don’t worry, we’re almost there, trust me.”
“That I’ve been an idiot.” Dean stole another quick kiss. “And that I’m crazy in love with you, Cas. I’m hopelessly in love with a hopeful angel, and there is nothing in the world I would trade that for.”
When Cas felt no discomfort, pain, or changes of any sort for a day, that’s when they knew it was done.
Cas couldn’t provide him the freedom he needed. He couldn’t provide Dean with a home, or future, or even the best protection. There was nothing of value, materialistic or otherwise, that he could offer.
“Are you calling me a liar, Winchester?” Cas tilted his head, that little bastard smile still on his face.
But if the world did not allow him kindness, then he would allow it for himself. Despite all he has done, he owed it to himself. It was needed.
“Alright. So, uh we actually have two sets of teeth, not one shapeshifting set as some sources claim. The normal ones, these ones,” Dean bared his teeth for a second to show Cas, “these are permanent. The sharp ones, they’re a little bigger, and come out during feeding or if we feel threatened. Speaking of feeding-” Dean flicked his tail, sending a splash of salt water all over Castiel.
"Not you, exactly." Cas rubbed the back of his head and looked away. "Part of the reason why I tried to upstage you in winning Charlie's affection, was because I had hoped you would notice what I did. I liked your attention, I still do, but at the same time, I'm afraid that you will see me as beneath you. In mainstream views, you are close to perfect, Dean. I was afraid that I would never be equal to you in your eyes. So I avoided rejection altogether by just… backing off."
The sun beat down relentlessly on the crew. Sea-hardened folk, even those used to the heat, had trouble working under such conditions.
Dean dared to look up, just to catch a glimpse of Cas' huge, gorgeous smile. Cue the internal screaming.
Dean grinned, eyes twinkling as he took Cas’ hand. He led Cas out into deeper waters, into a new life and future together, where they truly belong.
Lifting Dean up as one would lift their bride, Cas fought through his own exhaustion and forced himself to wade to shore. He set Dean down in shallower waters, right by the rocky archway of the cove, hoping that the dampness was enough to keep Dean alive.
"So," Dean continued. "Since we're spilling secrets, being hella gay, you got the hots for someone?"
“Apologies. I assumed after all these years, with fewer reactions, that you were used to it by now.” The angel opted not to grab a chair or make himself comfortable in any way, although no one really knew what his idea of “comfortable” was. Dean fought the gradual heat that rose to his cheeks, and turned back to face the stove.
“Well, well, well.” Chuck sauntered up to Castiel, all traces of warm familiarity gone. “I knew you wanted the merman free, but I must say, I never expected you to go so far.”
He shook his head. Merfolk sightings were rare enough already, there was no point in saying he had been seeing evidence of them for a week. The crew had sailed this route multiple times, and it’s never happened before. Besides, considering how many times the creatures had been hunted in the past, it was not surprising that some questioned whether they still existed.
Sam was on another one of his breaks when Dean retired to his room, intending to only get his headphones. God knew Dean was going to have to blast Metallica if he wanted to keep paying attention. Not that cases were ever this difficult to pay attention to, but research is so much more fun with Metallica blasting through his brain.
Dean loves Cas. God, he loved the angel so much. He trusted Cas, learned from him, taught him a few things back, but most of all, Dean had found his peace within Castiel.
The beach was soaked almost all the way up to the treeline, with natural debris everywhere. There were patches of glass here and there; it was the first time Castiel had seen that on sand that wasn’t black. Satisfied that the storm had well and truly passed, he began moving all his belongings back to their original places. Fatigue and the occasional sneeze hindered what was already a difficult task (again, sickness was the last thing the man needed). A part of Castiel wondered if staying by the trees would be better. Easier. One look at the dirtied waves lapping the shore, however, and he knew he couldn’t stay away from the sea. It was his home… and his heart.
“I know, but as you said, you’ve stopped the bleeding.” The human inspected Dean’s wounds quickly, but carefully. What remained of Dean’s imprisonment was nasty, to say the least. Though there was no fresh bloodflow, the bruises alone suggested other serious injuries. They would take a long time to heal.
"I know, I know. You're worried about my recovery, and I should be using that magic for myself. But Cas, I'm fine. Really. Most of the burns are already gone." That, Castiel noted, was true. "Besides, you were in the water again. I didn't want to pass up the opportunity, and I didn't like seeing you in pain. You know, you've… you have a lot more to worry about above the water. I just wanted to make it a bit easier."
I actually am a little sorry for this chapter, but I needed to add a bit of spice to the story (not the smutty kind, the plot kind). I can neither confirm nor deny if it gets better, but I will say, I added a tiny amount of foreshadowing to one of the lines.
“It worked!” Dean threw himself at Cas, laughing and crying and experiencing a thousand emotions at once. “It worked, it worked! Holy shit, it worked! Cas, Cas, you’re a merman! A
“Agreed,” Castiel replied as he scanned the book. “Although most people who come in here would think of
“So you keep reminding me, and I thank you for your confidence. But something doesn’t feel right.” This made Chuck frown.
“I chose this, and I will endure this in its entirety. I don’t want to risk anything worse if we stop now.”
Whatever the reason, as he watched Dean splash back into the glistening waters, Castiel realised what that growing feeling in his chest was: love.
There are many experiences in life I don’t have the right words for, yet some I do. I feel like this is one of the latter ones. I don’t have the strength to say all of this out loud, so I suppose writing my thoughts down will have to do, for now.
Their lips barely touched when a loud knock on the door startled the pair, causing them to jump apart, and causing Cas to wince in slight pain.
With a hand over his shocked, agape mouth, Cas couldn’t believe what his eyes were seeing. There, kneeling in front of him, was Dean, a silver ring in his outstretched hand shining as bright as the river. A nervous but loving smile graced the green-eyed man’s face, and just the act of it all brought tears to Cas’ eyes.
“Never.” He pulled away just enough to look into Castiel’s gorgeous blue eyes. He smirked, though there was a softness about him Cas had only seen on rare occasions. “Better get used to it, Cas. ‘Cause we’re using the buddy system for the rest of our lives.”
Dean barely got to finish what he was saying when Castiel did what he’s always wanted to do: grabbing Dean by the collar and kissing the living daylights out of him.
Cas, who shared more similarities with him than Dean would have ever dreamed. Cas, who had bled for the world as much as he did, yet still bore his heart.
“Dean, don’t be so naive. Did you really think it was going to last? A human and a merman, friends forever on a lonely island in the middle of nowhere? It’s impossible. You have your own world, and I have mine, and even if you could grow a pair of stupid legs, we could never be equals. Never.”
“Oh, hush!” Cas playfully smacked the merman’s arm, revelling at the sound of that beautiful laugh. “I mean, it’s no way to live in a place where you aren’t wanted, or can’t be yourself. So no, I wouldn’t go back. I would miss a lot, but not enough to convince me to stay there.” He leaned down to kiss the salt off Dean’s lips. “Besides, I can’t leave you alone. You would be helpless without me.”
That earned him an eyeroll in return. As he pushed the library trolley away to sort out some new returns, Crowley threw one more quip over his shoulder.
Cas didn't even have time to turn around when the merman disappeared into the water. He called Dean's name once, twice, hoping there would be some sort of response, but there was none. It worked. He was all alone again.
It started off harmless enough. One would try and get Charlie's attention away from the other, constantly calling her name back and forth throughout the school day. It eventually led to them preparing fun dates for Charlie, without ever actually calling them "dates" to her face, of course. Behind her back, Dean would constantly taunt the other male, while Cas wasted no opportunity in bringing out any savage quips. They would constantly praise Charlie, gift things to her, spoil her beyond measure… and the entire school knew about it. A lot of students had even taken bets on what the outcome would be. Some bet on Cas, others on Dean, and some predicted another ending to the feud entirely.
So Cas did. Arms still secure around each other, the two males patiently tread water, calm breaths added to the echoed sounds of the cavern. Turns out, they didn’t have to wait long.
“I’m grateful, too.” Dean allowed himself to smile. He began to clear up the kitchen when the song, and an unusual request was made. “Can you teach me how to dance?”
“Of course.” Cas handed off the shell, watching Dean as the mermaid admired all the different shades of colour. “I kept this one because it reminded me of you.”
"Classy ride for a classy lady," Dean said, throwing a flirtatious wink her way. Charlie only giggled as she hopped into the passenger seat, hiking up the skirts of her golden ball gown. Though it pained Dean not to have classic rock sounding through the speakers of his car, he made an exception and allowed Charlie to pick the songs as they drove towards the school. Suffice to say, her music choices weren't too bad. Kind of catchy, actually, though Dean would never admit it out loud.
“You know… you were wrong about one thing. You were never going to be just another one night stand for me. I’ve known you just as long as you’ve known me, and- and honestly, I’m no good with words, but if I were to list all of the things I love about you, we’d be here all night.” Dean’s voice went quieter, if that was possible. “You’re not the only one who fell. I didn’t know to reach out, so I fell back on the only thing I knew. I’m sorry, I will never, ever, do that again. I promise.”
Jo grabbed one of the Winchester’s hands while Ash grabbed the other, and together, they dragged him all the way to the other end of the bus lineup. The grown male gulped, nervousness clouding his mind. The new teacher, Mr Novak, had only been at the school for a week, but damn, did he make one hell of an impression. With soft raven hair, piercing blue eyes, and a smile that could melt permafrost, the Winchester male fell hard and fast for the “walking talking masterpiece”. It was only a matter of growing a pair of balls and talking to the damn guy. Unfortunately for him and his nerves, that matter was taken out of his hands.
Castiel broke the surface of the ocean, coughing, spluttering. A pair of strong arms around his torso helped keep him afloat, and he could feel someone pressed against his back. He was alive.
“I know. We’ll deal with that when it happens, alright? And if it does happen, they won’t get anywhere near us.” A loving kiss was placed on Castiel’s forehead. “Trust me.”
“I just- I thought I should ask first, I didn’t want to take anything you weren’t willing to give. If you don’t want to, that’s fine, I understand some people don’t like that, but-”
“Benny saved me from a very awkward situation when I was nine…” Castiel said, nodding his head at the thirty something year old man.
“I'm fine, I just had a rough break up that’s all,” Dean brushed it off, wincing as Mary all but shoved the ice pack onto his face.
“Right you weren’t at school yesterday,” Charlie grinned stepping forward as we continued down our separate lines, “he came out as bisexual, and said if you were there he’d happily kiss you as proof.”
“Yes you do!” Cas countered, grabbing Dean’s ankles and dragging him onto his back. Dean let out a breath of surprise, looking at Cas as the other leant over him and kissed him. His tongue going into Dean’s open mouth and leaving burning everywhere it touched, and that burning spread down to his crotch. Dean’s eyes remained wide until Cas’ tongue brushed over a sensitive spot in his mouth, making Dean whimper. And then Dean came to his senses. Pushing Cas away with a hand on his chest and a hand on his forehead, Dean took a few deep breaths whilst he stared at Cas. What the fuck?
The next thing I knew the pair were gone and I was asleep on the matrass, wrapped in the blanket that we normally left there. Rubbing my eyes, I looked around, seeing that the light outside was that that normally suited the morning. I slept the entire night? “What the fuck?” I rasped, looking down at my hands and smiling when I found they were hands. Only thing was… I could have sworn I still had a tail… I reached around my back and clasped at what felt like a tail… to find I still had a tail. “What the fuck!” I cried.
“That’s the way life goes,” Gabriel murmured, “come on, there’s one more place to go,” he added, walking towards the excite and beckoning for Dean to follow.
“I heard about this place, and wanted to tell you that I want to help,” Dean admitted blushing when Benny stared at him slack jawed, “and I was also thinking about raising your pay so you have more for you and giving any spare expense from the restaurant here.”
I climb out of the car, listening to the thud of the door closing as Crowley gets out, on the phone once again.
“Thank you Gabe, for last night,” Dean muttered, hoping he didn’t just sound crazy. Gabriel broke into a grin, before holding a finger up to his lips.
“Dean!” Ellen said, grabbing his face to pull him down slightly to look at his eye as Mary got an ice pack out of the freezer.
“Chains?” Dean asked, bemused by the image, “I don’t know father, I believe this new fashion sense suits you.”
“I-I had to help set the fair up,” I admitted, the redness in my cheeks enhancing as Dean’s hand appeared and cupped my face.
Dean walked over to the child who was sitting in the corner of the room, cross legged on the floor, glaring at any of the men or women who neared her. She was a cute kid, no older than twelve at most. With thick locks of blonde hair that fell to her mid back and large, round blue eyes. But Dean didn’t let that deter him. He sat facing her, placing the bowl between them as a peace offering. She stared at it suspiciously before lunging for it and gobbling it up quickly in fear he might take it back. When she got to the bottom she placed the bowl back between them and gave him a suspicious look. “What do you want?” she asked quietly, looking to Benny who smiled in a way to tell her it was okay to talk to Dean.
Nine years rolled passed with Dean and Castiel spending every day together. Sam had gotten married on the day that would have been Dean’s thirtieth birthday. His bride, Jessica, had agreed to have their wedding at the house. So unbeknownst to the blushing pair Castiel and Dean were watching them. Of course John’s speech said Dean was watching over them as their guardian angel, but he wasn’t exactly accurate.
“Well, I was worrying anyway. At least now I know what I need to worry about,” Sam pointed out, “I’ve been trying to find stuff too you know. But the last time he was there, Jack brought him back, so maybe we just wait and hope he is doing that again this time?”
“I learned don’t let Claire agree with him,” Kaia added coming into frame, “She’s lucky Donna was able to call in a favor to get us all out of trouble, or we wouldn’t have gotten out until today and wouldn’t have been home until tomorrow midway through Christmas dinner.”
“Yeah, yeah I’m okay with,” Dean beamed, then got a bit shy. “Hey, uh…, you’re human now, and need sleep. And like we said, nothing hidden in my suggesting this, but you can sleep in here if you want, because I’d not mind that at all. In fact I’d love to wake up with a reminder that you’re really truly here.”
Dean glared, tears streaming down his face, “Don’t you fucking ‘Hello, Dean’ me, you asshole!” he half shouted as he stomped over to him, ignoring the look of confusion on Cas’ face, not speaking again until he was right in front of him. “After you sacrifice yourself for me, knowing I wouldn’t have an easy way of getting you back, leaving me alone in that fucking dungeon, never able to answer you?”
And that’s when Dean noticed the ornaments arranged in a circle in the front, his breath catching in his throat. At the center was a MilkyWay candy bar ornament with a bite out of it. It was surrounded by a woman holding a heart, for Kelly Kline, a hand posed in the ASL for ‘I love you’ for Eileen, a laptop with ‘signs of ghosts’ sharpied into the search bar on the sticker, a slice of apple pie, and…
Seven months… It had been seven months since-- and still he relived it almost every night in his nightmares.
“I needed his help, before I could revive him.” Jack said with his bright smile that he always had when he thought he’d done good.
Two badges hanging close to each other, but they both had ‘badass’ written on them instead of what there ‘legal’ jobs are, he’d have to send pictures of that to Jody and Donna later, along with the stethoscope, crystal ball, and two girls building a snowman that were all nearby.
“You didn’t know it would be when you called on your deal, and I’ve said this every time you’ve died, but I mean it, don’t ever fucking do that again. Do you understand? If you die of anything, it had better damn well be normal human reasons, you hear me?” Dean paused, waiting for Cas to answer.
“That don’t explain why it’s been seven months,” Dean frowned, taking a sip of his beer, because he needed it.
He took a deep breath, and looked Cas in the eyes, smiling at him, “I love you too, Cas, and I’m so sorry it took all of this for me to admit that too you. I’m so sorry I let you die without hearing it back.”
“You know what the deal was, and I guarantee you know what he said, so stop WHATEVER THE FUCK you’re doing, AND GET CAS BACK HERE!” the last part of that yelled through sobs.
“Right, good,” Dean nodded, then looked Cas over. “I am so not good at making this not sound like I’m asking for more, but that?” he gestured to Cas’ suit, “That’s got to go when you’re sleeping.”
There were several battery operated candles and tinsel and green crap on the tables, and red and gold garland about the banisters all the way down the stairs, lights strung amongst them.
“I hear you, but you gotta explain again how Bobby doing a werewolf case… ended up with the four of you kicked out of a Casino for cheating…” Dean laughed over video call at Claire, who was with everyone at Jody’s.
“I’m aware Dean,” Cas said as he followed him in, and Dean could feel the eye roll. “We are to talk and settle things. Though I feel they are pretty settled, but I also understand you need this. There are no more private leaning thoughts on your mind at the moment.”
“Save it, Sammy,” Dean muttered, not looking at him, “I don’t need sympathy, you know that.” he continued, as he continued down the stairs.
“Good, we all deserve time together after everything,” Dean nodded as he placed the pie in the oven, “Alright, let's go let them all know it’s time to eat.
He stood up, placing a hand on Cas’ back, “Last thing I want to do right now is get back to cooking,” he smiled, “But I ain’t leaving your first meal as a human up to those two to finish either, so I got no choice.”
“Dean you’re the only person I have ever wanted to have take my virginity, you’re the only person I trust enough to let ruin me,” I accused, wrapping my arms around his neck.
“They split up and it was your fault,” the spirit told Dean, “you poisoned your brother’s relationship.”
Castiel reclined on his shared bed in the combined kingdom. When the war was done, King Dean of the South, Queen Linda of the north and King Michael decided a war such as this would not happen if the kingdoms had not been split up. Ten years went into rebuilding the old kingdom, and once it was finished, Dean and Castiel got married. Linda’s son Kevin, although he was sixteen at the time of completion was promised to Michael’s daughter Hannah. And the two kings and queens would rule their children married and deemed fit to take over the kingdom, then hand their combined kingdom down to their two children, Ben and a princess from another kingdom all together whose name was Claire. “Cas?” Dean asked, coming into their room concerned that his husband was not at dinner that night.
“An angel? Why would an angel want to be friends with a snot nosed kid like you?” Bobby teased, making Dean puff out his cheeks, Castiel hopped off the piano and sat next to Dean.
“What do you mean by you like me?” Castiel asked, walking towards Dean once more, standing less than a safe distance away from the drunk man, and closing the door behind him to close them into his room.
Castiel would only leave the attic when Dean was at school or in bed after that, Mary had gotten a job seeing as both her boys were at school now, and John was always at work as well. So Castiel would wander around the house, amusing himself with their modern appliances, unless it was the stuff in the kitchen… he didn’t particularly want to burn his home to the ground. He mostly read books though, and played the piano. He had missed playing piano.  It was the only skill he really had. So when he was innocently playing and didn’t hear the front door close, or giggling well he wasn’t about to stop playing. It was only when the door to the sitting room slid open did he think to make himself invisible from everyone, including Dean – a skill he had learnt when said boy had turned thirteen and nearly saw Castiel watching him blow out the candles. But now Dean was sixteen, and appeared to be skipping school with some girl.
“Why not? She’s hot!” Dean defended, slicing tomatoes, cucumbers and various other salady things to put on our sandwiches.
“God I forgot how gorgeous he was,” Dean laughed to himself, fully aware that he was being watched by at least one Gabriel. He plonked himself down next to the darker haired man, and drawing his knees up to his chest.
“Are you seriously intending to give me a cooking lesson?” I asked my best friend Dean as he scurried from one place in his kitchen to another. He was pulling out plates and knives and all sorts of things out… just to make sandwiches. There were five different knives. As Dean pulled out each knife he named them.
“Fuck,” Dean cried, leaning his head in the crook of Castiel’s shoulder, “fuck me please.” Castiel needed no more, he began to push his dick into Dean’s hole, millimetre by millimetre until Dean got so fed up he slammed himself down, wincing in pain slightly but not regretting it in the slightest. The two clung to each other as they caught their breath. Castiel rocked his hips as he lifted Dean up and roughly pulled him back down. Castiel thrust into Dean, slowly building up speed as he lost his self-control. Dean was thrusting himself down in pace with Castiel, mewling lewdly and probably alerting everyone in the castle of their current activity. Castiel flipped Dean onto the bed and continued his rough assault on the younger’s arse, smirking when Dean cried out, cuming all over their chests. This image was enough to finish Castiel off, and the man came into Dean.
“Because you’re mine and he didn’t ask for permission to look at my stuff,” Castiel explained as he scraped his nails down the boy’s hip bones earning another gasp from the touch of the older man.
Dean blinked several times before snorting to himself and closing his eyes. “Right, sure, why not,” he snorted to himself before his breath began to even out. But before he was truly asleep he was forced up and out of his bed as what he thought was a bucket of water was being poured on him. Before his eyes, stood his old boss Fergus Crowley dressed in what Dean remembered to have been his favourite black, Armani suit, his lips quirked up in an amused smile.
“I know,” Dean whined back. “But do you have to go so fast? I was kinda hoping to admire the view. The actual view this time.”
"Yes, well, if I hadn't been there in the first place, this could have all been avoided." He touched the pads of his fingers to Castiel's wound. Surprisingly, there was no pain. "I almost cost you your life."
As if he were reading my mind, Dean ran his thumb over the silver wedding band on my left hand, and I, in turn, do the same to his matching one.
Glancing over at the love of his life, Dean wondered if Cas would even like the other thing he had planned in the first place. He tried convincing himself that whatever the outcome will be, as long as they were together, it didn’t matter, but… to say it didn’t hold some weight for him would be a lie. And Dean was done lying so much a long time ago.
The day he stopped worrying, Cas was sitting with his toes in the water, staring out into the afternoon horizon. There was a new pile of shells at his side; he’d picked them from the ocean floor only an hour before. There was a tightness in his chest that refused to leave, and thoughts that left an edge of fear.
There were tears in those bright blue eyes, but a laugh gracing his mouth. Cas wiped the tears away, and he couldn’t stop a small laugh from escaping him.
Cas could only stare dumbfounded. His mouth was slightly open, a frown on his brows as he tried to process Dean’s words.
College finals were always a stressful time for Cas. What was even more stressful, however, was a simple game of 7 Minutes in Heaven. Only it wasn't so simple.
