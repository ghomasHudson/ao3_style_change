If Cas had even the inkling of hope that something would shift or change between them after Dean saved him, it was a bitter fantasy by the time he was up again. Dean doesn’t make a mention of that night; Cas would think it was purely his imagination and additive of the poison that conjured that scene in his bedroom, and to make Cas question if he should go back for more venom, if not when he awoke for the second time and saw a chair pulled up to the side of his bed and his hair in more disarray than when he woke the first time. When he first journeyed out of his room Dean was nowhere to be seen, and Cas surmised that he didn’t say those two words that he promised himself to keep stored within his chest cavity as Dean wasn’t around to kick him out.
Jack, for all unintended purposes, thought Cas’s hair was a riot. Cas had already his hands full (literally) trying to scrub out the color and now he had the added bonus of his son wanting to put said color in his hair; Cas wasn’t against it, but he wished to only have to deal with one thing at a time. To be honest Cas didn’t want to show Jack his hair due to his slight telepathy they had found he had when Dean started to bang his head against the wall when he kept on hearing a voice plea for dinosaur shaped chicken nuggets during lunch time one day. If Jack knew about it, then he could possibly tell Dean and Cas didn’t want to know the jokes which would emerge from that. So he compromised with his four year old son/aforementioned past God and told him if he didn’t tell Dean then he could pick out any color he wanted for his hair—proper hair coloring.
“Dean. I’ll be fine. Promise.” Dean shuffled on his feet for a moment, before reaching out and grabbing Cas’s shoulders. Cas let out a small umph before realizing that Dean was hugging him, a new occurrence. Cas usually had to instigate the hugs, but he didn’t mind this at all.
Settling in the passenger seat of Baby, Cas heard a chime from his phone. He pulled it out of his (very small and unusable) back pocket and unlocked it. He realized it was from Claire, a photo of Jack carrying around a container about as heavy as him of ice cream. His face was smeared with chocolate, and Cas mentally rewrote his action plan of how to get him to bed with a couple of liters of sugar crammed into his body before he remembered that he would be staying the night with Claire since she was watching him and lived a few hours away.
“Now,” Matt started, turning Jack around in the chair to look straight at the mirror situated in front next to all the hair products, “styles? Do you want to leave it longer? Just a trim so it’s healthy, or something else?” Jack’s response to that question was usually a very well known head tilt and squinty eyes; Cas had learned that, for all the time Jack had been God and needed to make tough decisions in a cutthroat manner, when he wasn’t on the clock managing all humanity, he was more reticent about his answers. But this time Cas could see the proverbial light bulb light up instantly, and he could see Jack smiling by way of his reflection in the mirror.
“Bud, my brain was kinda working on auto pilot. I’m—I didn’t really want that tonight, or have for awhile. We have Jack to think of.” Dean’s eyes finally met Cas’s, and Cas squinted at the man beside him, consternation prevalent on his face.
“Faster.”
Cas hadn’t asked for jeans, since he a few handed down from Sam and hemmed beyond belief, but Dean insisted, so he wore them. He had commented to Dean, once he put them on and walked into the kitchen to show him, that they were tighter around the thigh area, and then promptly made a note not to say that again as it caused Dean to choke on his beer that had just taken a sip of and cough out a common phrase of ‘fuck’.
“Are you sure you don’t need me to stay? Cas, you’ve rarely been sick yet and it’s hot as balls down here. If you’re cold you probably have the start of  the flu.” Cas would normally appreciate the effort Dean was showing, but right now he had a date with a “how to” site and 20% battery left on his phone.
After their first interaction since the case, the palpable tension that had resided between them seemed to slacken. Cas found Dean puttering around places Cas would be situated; reading in the library would only be a twenty minute excursion before Dean appeared and would ask what he wanted for dinner and a question on garden vegetables, or Dean inviting him into his room to rate old 70s albums and help to decide which to donate. It was during a trek into the kitchen and finding himself keeping Dean company that Cas finally brought up the case.
“It’s not my fault that you just decided to actually wash your hair properly. I know it was you stealing my shampoo, hun. You ain’t subtle.”
“Hmmm.” Jack stuck his lolly into his mouth and allowed the conversation to pitter down.
Also a celestial being of light and molecules, but very old.
“Jack.”
“Hmm. But haven’t you been around me enough to know my hair type?”
Dean had a case up near the Canadian border, a nest of Vampires causing havoc for the people and the moose, and was going to be gone for two weeks. Jack was disappointed since Dean had promised him to go see a rerun of Moana in theaters, but he promised Jack they could go see two movies when he returned and get a slushie.
than me,” Dean argues. “You gave up everything for me.
“I’m getting some air. I’ll be back before it gets dark so we can torch those bones and go the fuck home. I’m tired of this case already.”
“...The first time..?”
He stops himself before he can get himself in too deep. “Fuck. I’m sorry. You didn’t ask for all my crap.”
their iron grip, refusing to release.
“I remember the last time you got hammered,” Dean says fondly as he downs his first shot. “You’re a grumpy drunk when you’re all angeled up, you know that?”
“It is now.”
Sam looked to be on the verge of tears- teetering on the precipice of a complete meltdown. Cas couldn’t, nor
at him.
Sam's mouth lifts into a smirk. "Since when do you care?"
Cas gives it some thought for a moment. “I believe this qualifies, yes,” he says after some consideration.
He almost feels like he's pulled Cas down into his world.
Dean wants to fucking
for the first time.”
Dean shrugs. “Do what you did before. Watch cartoons. Play with your Flip or something.”
“Hold on, wait a second-”
“Yes Dean?”
“I’m not going anywhere,” Cas says firmly. “Not unless you tell me to- and you mean it.”
“The Shadow doesn’t like Cas very much. For waking up and refusing to go back to sleep the first time he was there. And then Cas made a deal with them…” Jack pauses, his face falling, “...to save me.”
I know I’ll never be good enough for you, I know that all I’ve done is fail you, and Sam, and everyone else in my life that’s ever been dumb enough to give a shit about me! You don’t need to fucking remind me, okay?!”
Dean feels the stinging ache of those words stirring deep in his chest. He's never bought into that- the whole 'you don't have to understand- just believe' schtick. It always seemed like some shit that Bible-thumpers spread around to manipulate people into becoming believers or whatever. Oh, if only they knew what the God they'd been praying to before was really like.
How is Dean supposed to look him in the eye and do this to him?
The house is, well- just like any other abandoned house. Filthy, dusty, dilapidated- and creepy as hell. As soon as he stepped inside Dean could feel the hairs on the back of his neck standing on end.
“Your dreams are quite entertaining,” Castiel tells him. “Back when I still could, I would occasionally look into your mind to see what you were dreaming about.”
“Because I know you Dean, you’d die before being open about your feelings.”
are minimal. As soon as they all come through the bunker door, Dean claps his hands together, fighting off the exhaustion he feels seeping deep into his bones, because fuck it- no more distractions, no more waiting around. This was
“Look, don't get me wrong Cas, I'm glad you're here, I’ve just been thinking…” Dean starts, “I've been thinking about a lot- about the possibility of you ending up there again. If… if something were to happen to you before your Grace ran out, or even…”
“It’s uh,” Sam ran a hand over his face. “It’s Dean.”
“That was not my intent.” Concerned, Cas lightly placed a hand on Dean’s cheek to wipe away the tears that had fallen. “Are you alright?”
tattooed across his forehead.
“I’ll explain everything once we get back.” He squints in confusion when he notices his restraints. “Oh. You can’t move.”
A part of him hates that Cas' happiness is attached to him. Because he
Cas's eyes light up with amusement. “We have all night. We can watch as much as you want.”
“I haven’t had the chance to say this properly,” Cas starts, “but… thank you. For saving me.”
The Shadow's smirk grows as they watch him struggle. “Nice try, but like I said- whatever remains of your Grace is no more than a light show in here, Cas.” They turn around and walk off into the darkness. “See you around.”
“You stayed with me all this time and got jack shit for it.”

And with that, they disappear into the darkness.
Do you know what it’s like for me to have to see your face every night, and be reminded of when Lucifer gutted you right in front of me?”
“Now then, I’m gonna go see who decided to knock on my door. In the meantime, you hang out here. If the Winchesters do manage to get to you while I’m gone, they won’t be able to move you.” The Shadow snaps their fingers and Castiel falls to the ground on his back. Thick, black tendrils slither over his wrists and ankles, binding him to the ground and keeping him firmly in place. He writhes in their grip, his eyes flaring blue as he attempts to use his Grace to bust out of his restraints- but to no avail.
“Yeah, but… it’s Cas’ choice, Dean. It’s
Cas rubs his bleary eyes once more. “I thought that… that I had to deal with it on my own. I couldn’t burden you with this, not after what you were going through.”
for him, I’ll do it myself!”
“You’re a good teacher,” Cas says sincerely. "Really."
“You’re just going to accept it?” Dean asks incredulously. “Why?”
Jack shakes his head, as if forcing the temptation out- the temptation of normalcy. To a being as powerful as him, normalcy should be considered an insult rather than a luxury. “...I’m sorry, but I can’t,” he finally says. “Chuck did so much damage. As the one who inherited his powers, it’s my responsibility to fix it.”
In this dream, Dean was at some shitty motel. He and Sam had been hunting a shapeshifter (or wendigo, he couldn’t remember and really, he didn’t care). Sam was in the shower washing off the blood while Dean changed into some fresh clothes. And
Dean blinked slowly, as if processing his words, before a vibrant smile stretched across his lips. “You’re… such a dork, Cas.” He gently grabbed his wrists to pull him into a loose but warm embrace.
“Of course,” Cas says. “What’s the matter?”
“...Thank you,” Castiel says. “I never would’ve been able to convince them to let me go.”
Sam turns his face away, scrunching his nose in disgust. “Oh yeah, they’re down here alright. Get the salt and the matches out of the bag.”
They’re just that, though- fantasies. He's confident for more reasons than one that that was never in the cards for him. Still, it brings him comfort to think about what could have been. And in here, that's all he can do. Comfort himself, because no one else will.
“Oh, she can understand you- for the most part. It’s really only you that doesn’t understand her.”
“Dean. I need you to think about this for a second.”
The Shadow grabs Castiel by the tie and lifts him in the air, wearing a cruel smile that isn’t Dean’s. “You think I could
But before he can even
And Cas? Well, that right there was his whole problem.
smartass.” Dean dips his hands back into the sink to grab the last remaining plate.
So he does the only thing he can do- he throws salt at them before they can reach Sam and Cas. The boys shoot him a death glare that clearly says ‘you’re next’ before they forcibly disappear.
“this is your whole
Despite this- despite settling back into everyday life relatively well, Cas is distant. He hasn’t left the bunker, thankfully- but even with Cas living with them, he still feels so far away. Their conversations are short, even when spending time together. He wonders if Cas notices it too, and if he’s as put off by it as Dean is.
his brother.
“Perhaps,” Castiel admits, “but it’s necessary. Like I said, you are prone to repression. You do not share your feelings with Sam, who has offered to help, I presume. Remember, this was just as much of a loss for him as it was for you-“
had ever given up what Cas gave up to be with him- to fight alongside him.
“Sam, don't-”
“Er, uh-” Dean catches himself, “just- we’d really like it if you stayed.”
“Jack, no it’s not,” Sam says, using what Dean liked to call his 'negotiation voice'. He'd always been good at that- way better than Dean ever was. “You are under no obligation to do
thank you for reading! if you liked it pls drop some kudos, i would appreciate it <3
father- was undoubtedly among those very same hunters- and that he had always had a specific mindset about how Dean should be- a mindset that Dean himself had adopted because that was all he knew. It had taken him years to break away from it and he’s still not sure that he’s completely free. He might not ever be.
“That can’t be a good sign,” Sam says grimly. “Angels don’t sleep.”
Could Dean not- just once- get
He hears three distinct, piercing childlike screams- and then dead silence.
“I suppose it’s because Sam doesn’t dream of me often,” Castiel ponders.
Dean sighs. “Bummer. Alright, so these kids were never found, and the one survivor described the ghosts as children- so I’m guessing the world’s greatest parents hid the bodies somewhere in the abandoned house.”
“You’re bleeding,” Cas says. “And you have an… unpleasant-looking bruise.”
“Save me? Dean, I’ve been dead for almost a month now. I am far beyond saving.”
Cas, your- your
“I don’t know if I can fix them,” Jack says as he looks down at his own two hands, brimming with new power. “I was lucky that I was able to bring back everyone here. But I have to try. Those people have just as much of a right to live as the people here.”
that? Smile and laugh with Dean all carefree like that? Why doesn’t he feel as broken up about this as he does?
what you want to do- then it’s what I want.”
Dean feels it in the back of his throat, then on the tip of his tongue, ready to spill out. But his lips just can’t form the words no matter how hard they try, and he swallows everything back down again, tears swimming in his eyes now. “Don’t make me say it,” he begs. “Please don’t Sammy, I’m begging you here.”
He'd been so excited to hear about Sam's blooming relationship with Eileen that he'd almost missed out on the second part of Sam's sentence. If only he'd been so lucky. “Wait,
“Alright!” Dean cheers excitedly. “Maybe this time you’ll do something normal. Like maybe take her to see a movie instead of a monster, you know?”
to fight my battles,” Cas snaps impatiently.
Sam returns the next day. He’s a little bruised from the hunt- and home a bit earlier than expected- but is otherwise unharmed.
“I thought you’d be exhausted.”

the reason Rowena had to sacrifice herself.
But the longer he looks at Cas, the more the words just sink deeper and deeper back into his throat.
The microwave finally beeps after a few seconds of silence. Dean snags a couple of beers from the fridge, grabs the food, and sits down at the table. “Bon Appetit,” he says teasingly.
Before he can say anything more the Shadow vanishes, leaving him to himself.
Startled, Castiel manages to glance up and spot a smiling Jack standing before him, holding up his hand.
So when he finds himself alone in the driver’s seat of the Impala, with a distorted sound coming through the radio, he gets the feeling that he’s in a dream of some sort.
The rotation of the planet feels smoother beneath his feet, and the sun's rays feel just the slightest bit warmer against his skin. The cold, vacant emptiness that had once assumed the place of humanity is gone now, replaced with the laughter of children and the chaos of everyday life.
“Okay,” he says after a moment. “If you really have to go, we… we can’t stop you. But before you go, Jack- there's one thing I have to ask you."
"...It's alright if you don't feel the same," Cas says, "I don't mind. I'm content with whatever you can give me. All I ask is that you don't shut me out. I don't want our relationship to be in ruins because of this. I truly apologize for any hurt I caused you, but I don't regret loving you, or being in love with you. You can't make me do that, Dean. Never."
“You don’t mean that,” Cas says. “When I left- I
let Jack lose his soul,
He just wants it all to stop. And
Dean hisses through clenched teeth as the sting slowly dies down. “Fuck- I didn’t even feel anything cut me.”
“So… I take it that this means that you’ve decided to stay?”
attachment issues. Most people just mourn their loved ones in peace and let them go. They don't
Dean laughs humorlessly at that. “No.”
Dean freezes when he feels Castiel’s hand on his shoulder. It’s moving slowly up towards his neck and he flinches when his fingers nearly make contact with his skin.
“Oh yeah?” Dean challenges, stepping closer. “And why’s that?”
“Inside, talking to mom. She won’t be able to talk him out of it. No one can. Not me, not you, not Jack.”
Sam shrugs. “She suggested it. We’re taking things slow this time, but if everything goes well… maybe we’ll go on a non-monster related date again.”
Jack lets out a shaky breath. He looks as though he doesn't even want to so much as
that it almost makes him smile. “I don’t understand why you’re so insistent on making my choices for me.”
Cas had decided to fly in right while he was taking his jeans off.
“Jack, it doesn’t have to be this way if you don’t want it to be,” Sam tells him. “Come on. Come back to the bunker with us.”
“I don’t know- but if he does, then that’s his call.” Sam sighs in frustration, turning to look towards the large hotel window. “I guess I just don’t understand why you’re so against this.”
“I’m still afraid,” Dean confesses. “I’m still afraid that one day I’ll wake up and you’ll be gone. I’m afraid that one day I’ll let my anger take control again and I’ll say something I don’t mean, and I’ll drive you away. I’m afraid that someone- some monster out there- will use you against me.”
“Kinda nosy, don’t you think?” Dean asks, but he’s not really expecting an answer. He smirks a bit as he takes another sip of his beer.
“No. But he said he heard good things about us from Bobby, so he trusts us.”
“Cas-“
No response.
They’ve all grown accustomed to the smell over the years. That doesn’t make it any less unpleasant.
“I’m guessing the bodies are down there?” Sam asks.

He’s not quite as surprised when he finds that he’s still crying.
“The rules of the original arrangement between us- your people and my people. Now that Castiel is human, he has no reason to be here. He’s no longer one of your people. He’s
“Cas please. It doesn’t matter where, just
Dean meets his eyes and finds that he’s entirely serious. This isn’t a joke or some sloppy plan constructed at the last minute out of pure desperation.
This is fucking insane. His brain is yelling at him to abort, to run, to get away now before he gets in too deep- but it’s way too late for that. He’s in so fucking deep he’s drowning. Cas has him- hook, line, and sinker.
love you?"
“...Then
“Cas,” Dean starts out, voice low, “can we… can we talk for a second?”
“Dean-”
Black tendrils shoot up from the ground, intending to curl around Castiel again, but Jack freezes them right where they stand. He glares threateningly at the Shadow. “Let us leave. I don’t wanna fight you. I think you know what will happen if we fight.”
“So, is this gonna be a regular thing now?”
“...Maybe it’s not,” Jack admits with a sad smile. “But someone has to.
"I got it!" Dean snaps. When an uncomfortable silence follows, he sighs and runs his hand over his face, forcing himself to keep his eyes open and his body alert. "I'll be alright. I can handle it."
“Dude, I’m telling you-
Suddenly a loud, echoing wail- one that even Castiel can clearly hear- pierces the dark, unoccupied space between them.
“I didn’t do what I did for you in the hopes that I would gain something out of it,” Cas pointedly reminds him.
Silence falls between them. He knows that this Cas isn’t his, that his mind is just offering this scenario to him to provide him with a sense of comfort and peace. Still, he decides to indulge in it, even if only for a few fleeting moments.
“So what, you’re punishing yourself?”
Dean knocks quietly on the door. He can hear a bit of shuffling from inside the room, and seconds later the door opens to reveal a very homey-looking Castiel. He has discarded his jacket and trench-coat, leaving him with his dress shirt and dress pants, and a gray blanket wrapped around his shoulders. He definitely looks a little pissed- but he has every right to be. After all, they just fought over something completely…
He tries to help Cas adjust. But he and Sam are also making adjustments of their own- learning to live their lives the way they want after years of manipulation and being pulled every which way. It’s as terrifying as it is liberating.
to imagine what it must be like for Cas.
Dean pauses. He hadn’t really meant to be that bold or open about it quite yet. Of course he was going to tell Sam eventually- he just hadn’t realized that it would end up being quite so soon.
a voice that Castiel immediately recognizes as Jack adds.
, he most certainly could.
“I'm sorry for randomly bringing it up, it's just- I know you’re not telling me the whole story here,” Sam presses. “I get that you want to save him, but something tells me there’s just...
, leave without a scratch! And you have the… the
Dean’s bittersweet laughter fills the Impala. “Yeah, you always did, didn’t you? You never once thought of yourself, did you?”
When they arrive at the bar, Dean finds that despite all of the dream-girls eyeing him up, he wasn’t really in the mood. He wasn’t really keen on having a sex dream right in front of Cas (even if it was just dream Cas). And for some strange reason, while those women were certainly attractive, he didn’t really want much to do with them. He would save that for another time, on a night when Cas
Days pass, and Dean can’t work up the courage to bring it up again.
“Castiel’s Grace!" they exclaim, “But-”
sore- but Cas doesn’t need to know that.
Sam."
Dean shrugs. “Not sure. I’d definitely have to think about it.” It would certainly make sense if this was some kind of false reality. He’s got popcorn, a good movie, and Cas laying on his shoulder.
“Yes.”
“It’s going to be… tricky,” Jack admits. “The Shadow has a grudge against Cas. It’s going to be hard to get them to give him up.”
Castiel doesn’t give it much thought before answering. “I had to try something, I suppose. I had to do whatever it takes to protect you and Sam.”
Cas could hear Sam choking over the speaker; he wondered if he caught him in the middle of his supper, though it was 1:22am. Maybe a snack; Sam did enjoy rabbit food at all hours of the day and Cas couldn’t judge. He once ate raw hamburger off the floor but that was a spe—
Even if that someone wasn’t Cas.
“Cas,” Dean groaned, hitting the back of his head against the wall, “you’re making this very hard to do with all your, you know—” Dean waved a hand at Cas’s whole figure, “holy goodness or whatever the hell you have going on.”
“Why? It’s just your hair, Cas.”
“It is the same duty I see in you when you’re with Jack. You are his father as much as I am too.”
Cas had a change of plans. He had a date with Google tonight.
“What? Learning you have a kink for curly hair?” Cas teased, and Dean jabbed at him playfully.
“Someone makes you soup if you’re sick?” Cas asked, his vocal prowess lessening now that they weren’t exactly arguing anymore. He immediately regretted it as Dean’s facial expressions shut down on him completely, an imitation of what he would do when Cas and him didn’t know anything about one another when they first met.
“I mean nothing against you when I ask this Jack; you are truly one of the best things that have happened to me in my existence,” Cas started, looking at Jack: his face, his mannerisms, his son, “I just want to know, why did you want to come back here to the bunker? You could have explored the world, the people and nature in it.”
Cas deposited the drinks at the table and excused himself, saying he needed a breath of fresh air. Outside, he wrung the water bottle in his hands before cracking the plastic top and taking a long drink, replenishing his fraying nerves. He looked up at the sky, trying to see if he could make out any of the constellations he had been around to see created. The Big Dipper was present, a solid foundation for him to find both the Little Dipper and Polaris; Cas had been told by Dean one night while out with Jack in the fields that the North Star would always bring him home, but Cas’s home was currently behind him sipping low grade alcohol and enjoying the presence of another lady.
He fails to see how he could eat right now anyway. Ever since he’s let the thought of Cas come to the forefront of his mind he can barely fucking function, let alone eat. But it’s two against one, and Jack is
“It’s not that I don’t
“Always, Dean.” Cas leaned forward to gently rest his forehead against Dean’s. “Always.”
Castiel nods. “Sometimes. They were mostly memories, but it was such an… interesting sensation. Although I did not enjoy the constant physical needs that came with being human, I was exposed to so many new feelings, thoughts, and ideas.”
“The Shadow is… reluctant to let me go,” Castiel says. “After all the trouble I’ve caused.”
The Shadow waves them off. “Get out, before I change my mind.”
he should be well past the age of questioning this shit, right?
“No,” Dean interrupts. “It’s not like that. It’s…
Time doesn't stop. The wind keeps howling and the cars keep driving by.
Dean ducks his head into his hands, running his fingers through his hair, threatening to pull it all out in chunks. “Yeah. Okay. You know what? I came in here to be a total dick and completely nuke our relationship because I thought that was best for both of us,” he blurts out.
“I don’t want to talk about it,” Dean says firmly as he takes another stab at his food. “Can’t we just leave it at that?”
“Hey, it’s alright, okay? Why didn’t you tell me that you were… that you were having flashbacks? That staying in here was your way of coping with it all?”
Sam smiles, noticeably brightening at the suggestion. “Yeah, that’d be great Cas. Thanks.”
It has to be a trick. This is just the Shadow playing games- it has to be. If he lets himself believe... even for a second...
that he'd been left here. Castiel had stopped counting the moment he arrived. There was no point, after all- or so he'd thought.
“Cat’s out,” Dean grumbles, still unable to look Cas in the eye.
“I love you.”
“Really not helping, Cas.”
“...No, it’s uh… it’s fine,” Sam manages, both him and Dean flashing him their best attempts at reassuring smiles.
Despite not needing to breathe, Castiel feels himself go breathless.
they managed to poke around in here. Billie certainly didn’t send them here, so I wonder who did..?”
They aren't pleased. They’ve hardly been around since Castiel ended up here- and it’s no secret that they enjoy tormenting him given that they have a bit of a grudge. But so far all he’s seen of the Shadow is them pacing around angrily, grumbling to themself about how
Sam knew it firsthand. But he could always see right through Dean. He knew what he was trying to say every time, and he truly was grateful that his younger brother had this ability. He didn’t know what he would do if not even his own brother could understand him. Bobby knew it too. He could read Dean Winchester like an open book, from cover-to-cover. Hell, Dean could even say that Bobby knew him better than he knew himself. It was times like this that he wished he still had the older hunter around. But it seemed like the other people that he cared about didn’t have this ability. Lisa and Ben never did; yet it was only part of the reason that trying to live a normal life just didn’t work for him. Benny, Charlie, and Kevin never did either. None of them ever got the chance. (And in some weird way, Dean was glad that they weren’t around long enough to be hurt by him. But either way, they were all hurt anyway. It was his fault that they were dead)
Michael…
He lost count, can’t see the gashes underneath the continuous flowing of the sticky red. It stains his jeans, the sheets beneath him, and the carpet when it manages to trail it’s way down, it dries slowly until it’s a deep brown crusted between the fibers. His wounds don’t slow their gushing, Sam wonders if his body had given up on trying to clot, he thinks this is a good thing.
“I need to see him!” he fights against the grip, “I need to-”
“Michael really did a number on you, huh?” Lucifer’s voice is full of a faux sympathy that Sam had learned to equate with the devil, it could almost be believable if not for the giddiness dancing in speckles of red around his pupil.
He wonders, now looking at the streaked crimson across his steadily paling skin, if it were possible to see the taint within his blood. It had always been a thought at the back of his mind, and recently he’d expected his blood to ooze black; a vile, hateful black that would perhaps finally showcase what he’d always known, what he’s always been told.
Sam ignores his smile, following the vague hand gesture to the other side of the room where it had gone quiet. If it wasn’t obvious before that the silence was Lucifer’s doing it certainly is now. Dean still strains against the cuffs holding him, he’s red in the face from yelling and if Sam listens closely he can hear the muffled shouts caught just in his throat. He’d quickly gone from shouting at the devil --nearly knocking himself out of the flimsy wooden chair with his efforts-- to yelling at his little brother to choose him. It’s not a surprise, not really, Dean had always been self-destructive in his heroism. Still, Dean couldn’t possibly expect Sam to make such a choice, not after everything they’ve been through.
“Please I-” something stops him as they exit the cave, the dirt crunching beneath their feet. Sam tries again, and again with the same result. He can’t leave, something invisible stops him, traps him just at the threshold and he bangs against it with every bit of strength he has left. It doesn’t budge, doesn’t so much as stutter in the air.
Something solid collides with his back sending him tumbling to the ground. He lands hard on his good arm and grunts as pain shoots through his wrist. He barely has time to move, let alone to defend himself, before a knee is pressing harshly into his lower back and a large hand is gripping the back of his neck, keeping him effectively pinned to the cold floor. He squirms under the weight, injured arm pressed painfully underneath him, but it doesn’t budge. He turns his head as much as possible, just enough to see his brother out of the corner of his eye.
“Don’t,” his voice is firm, absolute, and Sam instinctually pulls his hand away from the blade, “you had your chance with that.”
Sam thinks he should be used to this by now, waking up with a harsh ache behind his eyelids and the feeling of a lump forming on the back of his head. He isn’t really surprised at the feeling of metal around his wrists keeping them pinned to his lower back, but that doesn’t make it any better. He doesn’t open his eyes right away, biting off a groan as dim sunlight filters through his eyelids sending pain sparking through his skull.
“De-Dean please,” Sam gasps out, his body screams at him to move, he can’t. He hardly notices the shaking of his limbs nor the wetness trailing his cheeks, he doesn’t care, “pl-please.”
Based in season 14 when Dean was building the Ma'lak box to trap him and Michael.
Out of the corner of his eye he sees it, glinting in the yellow-tinted lights, the demon blade sits still against the wall. He could reach it, it’s right there and Dean is still rambling on. Sam doesn’t move his eyes from his brother as he stretches his good arm out. He knows what he has to do, if Cas isn’t coming he knows this is his only chance, he sends a silent apology to his brother. Dean--the real Dean--would understand.
Sam doesn’t stop nursing the wound, the hand at the side of his head strokes encouragingly and he is lost again.
The ground is moist below his knees, cold mud soaking through his jeans and sending an unpleasant chill through his body. He’d been stripped of his jacket and flannel, he notices idly, leaving him in a thin undershirt and his now wet jeans that offer no warmth whatsoever. He wriggles his hands behind his back, testing the handcuffs currently cutting into his wrists, they fit snugly and without dislocating his thumb he wouldn’t be able to slip out of them. He can’t feel his lock pick against his ankle so he assumes they had taken it.
He doesn’t recognize the men, idly noting they all looked like they could be siblings, but the girl he remembers having seen a few times. Had she been tailing Dean and him?
Still, Dean as a demon has been unpredictable, Sam really shouldn’t put it past him. Dammit he needs to think, needs to find a way out of here. His thoughts blur together, and every time he tries to focus his skull throbs, he can’t figure out a plan of escape, not in this state.
“I-” he stops, pulling his eyes away from Dean, “Just kill me…”
His soul however-- his soul sings redemption. It weeps broken tears for all those he has lost, all those he should have saved, all those he himself let down. It offers a chance to fix things, to finally do something right and rid himself of sin. His soul calls for atonement; it whispers words of revulsion and pleas for him to just get it out.
The words are hardly out of his mouth before Lucifer is moving, there’s a scream, and that glorious bright, white light that only an angel could produce. Sam clenches his eyes shut, and still his retinas ache with the force, it’s gone almost as quickly as it started. Sam opens his eyes and has to forcefully bite off a sob. Castiel had gone limp, the hilt of the angel blade sticking proudly from his chest.
The air suddenly feels warm and Dean feels like he’s coming home all over again. The surroundings have changed again. He’s not at a park anymore. He’s
Why did he feel terrible? Wasn’t this what he wanted?
“The children are this way,” he says, pointing his flashlight down the hallway. “I can sense them.”
“…You could trust in us. Trust in yourself. Have faith. And, if you will allow it…” Cas stepped closer, offering a sunny smile, the same one that always caused Dean to reflexively smile back. “Have me?”
Miracle barks again before settling onto Jack’s lap for the ride.
A large, dumb grin breaks out across his face. “Cas?”
, knowing Cas, as soon as he would apologize, he would apologize back. He would consider himself unworthy of Dean’s apology and apologize for all of their old arguments and past betrayals. Put the blame all on himself, as per usual. Quite frankly, Dean was sick of it.
“That’s not true.” Something in Cas’ expression shifts. Earlier he was brimming with confidence- and now he almost seems reluctant. Hesitant. “I never said anything about it after I came back because I thought it would cause you pain or discomfort. But I didn’t realize that you had been hurting so much all this time. I’m sorry.”
The Shadow huffs and settles back into their chair. “...Torturing her got old fast. She doesn’t have the same kind of
of it was your fault.”
“Is that a threat?”
“And for tough stuff that doesn’t come off real easy- soak it. Fill up the sink, stick it in there, let it sit for a while,” Dean continues as he grabs a dirty bowl. “Oh yeah- and make sure you clean your sponge every now and then. Dishes don’t get clean if you use a gross sponge.”
“I’m fine,” Dean insists, gently swatting Cas’ hand away. “Back’s a little sore, that’s all.”
He meets Dean’s eyes- those huge fucking eyes- and gives Dean the look that he’s never been able to resist.

that whole time. I'm pretty sure you haven't slept since... since Cas. I’m tired, you’re tired- we both need a shower and some food- let's hold off on this, at least for today.”
Dean knows he’s got a point, but-
He instinctually wets his lips and steps closer. “And… if I said… I wanted to kiss you again?”
“...You-” Dean chokes out, the boiling anger simmering down to a low heat, “...you
Hearing Cas swear like that had been rather unexpected, but Dean was hardly complaining. “Maybe some other time.”
Dean stops at the bench outside and sighs, watching the fog of his breath disappear into the evening air. He’s starting to think that all of this- the way he feels now despite all of the confusion and the hesitance- is something that’s been there for a while. It’s just been buried beneath layers and layers of other unprocessed shit.
Dean's eyes go wide at the sight. “Is that Cas’ Grace? What the hell- you mean he’s

than it did during his last visit. No wonder the Shadow can't sleep.
“I- uh,” Dean sputters, knowing fully well that he can’t deny it. “I- whatever. It doesn’t matter.”
Dean smiles warmly at that. He hasn't always been super into the idea of having a dog- but Miracle was the exception. She's a survivor- like them. “Well, tell her she’s gonna have a good home now.”
He doesn’t let Cas stop him. Because he knows that if he does he’ll give in. He’ll fall right back into that trap.
“You’d have to be insane to trust me with this,” Dean argues, laughing dryly. “I mean- someone could steal it, or I could lose it, or break it, or-”
should know. The deal is that God doesn’t mess with my people, and I don’t mess with his.”
“I… what?” Sam questions, brows raised in surprise. “He… what do you mean he made a deal?”
His eyes snap open, and he abruptly steps back, drawing in several deep breaths.
He closes his eyes, and the energy in the room becomes charged, shifting and swirling around them,
Cas chuckles. “I like you too, Dean.”
about how to stop it, or how to so much as
He’s probably a little more excited by that than he should be. “Then let us help you-“
Jack abruptly freezes in place, wide-eyed like a deer caught in headlights.
Dean lowers his head, staring down at his bottle, sliding his thumb over the label. “You sure there’s nothing we can do to help restore it?” he asks. “Can’t Jack fix it?”
“Miracle says she likes the name you gave her. She didn’t have a name before you found her.”
"What do
“...Well
“I’ve been dreaming about Cas for days now.
“Dean, you were doing what you had to-”
“Maybe

“Maybe he will.”
“You did seem to be in a better mood than usual,” Cas adds.

“I asked him that. I asked if he was really there. He wouldn’t answer.”
“...So I take it you guys, uh… worked it out,” he says awkwardly.
life- to believe that everyone around you leaves because of you. So you push them away before that can happen.”
Jack smiles pleasantly, clearly pleased with the outcome. “I think that went well!”
Sam heaved a sigh and reluctantly took a step aside, allowing him access to the door. “He might still be talking to Mom-“
Driven to desperation, in a heated moment Cas threw all caution to the wind, consequences and regrets be damned. He reached up to cup both of Dean’s cheeks with his hands, bringing their faces close together, closer than they'd ever been. The dangerous path they'd been treading on and off again for the past ten years had finally reached a crossroads. Now it was up to him to choose the next path.
“Wait,” Dean holds up a hand, “you promise you won’t let me sleep in, right?”
In a second, Dean is pinned against the wall. Castiel’s hand is fisted tightly in his shirt, holding Dean down as if he is weightless. “
“Slow down for a sec,” Sam says, trying to keep the idea that Dean has within reason. “You’re getting ahead of yourself here. If you really think that Cas is trying to reach you, then see if you can ask him where he is.”
Dean snickers as he sits down across from him, opening a beer of his own. “That must suck, man. You’ve gotta drink an entire liquor store just to get a buzz.”
“I can't believe he..." he murmurs as he holds back tears of his own. "Why didn’t he tell us? We could’ve saved him! Maybe... if we had known-”
Everything is going so fast,
Dean ignores him, continuing on. He pulls the words straight from the ache within him, like sucking the poison out of a wound. “Still, the blame doesn’t just fall on him, because I really did feel that angry, but deep down I knew it wasn’t fair to you. I’m sorry that I let myself spiral when I should’ve done better at taking care of you.”
And then the next night, while they’re curled up on the couch, Dean- being the mastermind that he is when it comes to courting- pulls a classic move and yawns, pretending to stretch his arms before letting his left arm slowly move behind Cas to pull him closer.
“Sounds like a Cas thing to say,” Sam says idly.
“Seriously, man, this is starting to get pathetic.”
Dean had sort of forgotten about that little detail. “...Oh yeah. Huh. It’s weird to live in a world where everyone thinks you’re dead and only a few people know you’re alive, isn’t it?”
"I've missed you," Jack murmurs into his shoulder. "I missed you so much."
now. Dean doesn’t really have much of a choice in the matter.
“Well now I’m
Another week passes before Sam decides that he’s had enough of sitting in the bunker, and starts to look for a case.
Dean looks away guiltily. “...I still think about that. How much I fucked up by kicking you out when the least I could’ve done was… I don’t know, given you some fucking cash, hooked you up with a place to go-”
Dean couldn’t help but feel like the angel was bragging. “Well, this is just a dream after all. And it’s
“But you can’t have Jack and you know it,” Castiel counters. “So that’s why you took Billie. You took out your frustrations on her.”
. Dean scoots back onto Cas’ bed, motioning for Cas to follow. He rests his head on Dean’s shoulder, and soon enough the two of them are enraptured in the episode, and as it goes on Cas explains what Dean has missed since it had been a while. The last time Dean had watched was with Charlie.
“...I could ask you the same question,” Castiel retorts, turning around to face them. They’re still appearing to him as Meg, sitting regally on a throne made for them.
Dean appeared to be skeptical, as if he was expecting Cas to give him some cliché spiel about needing him. That only infuriated Cas further- the fact that Dean looked at him with such expectant eyes, like he knew exactly what Cas was going to say and knew exactly how he was going to deflect it.
, walk away?!”
“Would you mind if we were?” Cas asks as he shifts closer to Dean.
“Perhaps not. But you do have a tendency to remember things the way you need to. And for you, the easiest way to cope is to paint yourself as the guilty one. The one responsible.”
he blame him. “The least I can do is help him, you know? Since I can’t stop him.”
he'd said.
“...Okay, I'm just gonna hurry this along,” Dean says nervously. “I think I’ve just pissed off some freakishly strong ghost kids.”
Yup. Dean is fucked. He can’t do this.
“I don’t
sitting beside him, and suddenly things feel different.
Castiel’s voice shakes as he tries to keep from having another outburst. “I’ve made mistakes, Dean, and through those mistakes I’ve learned the true meaning behind everything that you and Sam have taught me. Everything that I’ve done to you haunts me day and night." Cas leans in closer to Dean, and Dean feels like he can finally see the depth of the angel's suffering. "Do you know how torturous it is to lie awake in the dead of night, unable to dream, and be harassed by vision upon vision of the two of us hurting each other?! It kills me, Dean. Why do you think I’ve stayed in here for the past month?! Because I… I can’t…” Cas feels tears blurring his vision. He tries to blink them away, but they’re salty and burning hot; spilling out of the corners of his eyes as he averts Dean’s gaze. He releases Dean and backs up to the edge of his bed, using his sleeve to wipe away tears.
“I may not be able to have the kid, but I’ve got the next best thing: his father.” The Shadow twists their fist and Castiel cries out loudly. “You hear me? I’m not giving
Dean thinks it over for a moment, trying to recall someone with that name- but he draws a blank. “Doesn’t ring a bell. Did we ever work a case with him?”
“He did more than just that,” Sam says fondly. “This case- it’s a salt ‘n burn, but it’s gonna be tough. We’re dealing with three ghosts.”
“I, um…” Castiel glances down at his bound wrists and ankles. “I don’t think that’ll be a problem.”
Dean can’t take another fucking second of this. If he’s in the same room as Cas for one more goddamn moment he’s gonna
He doesn’t say it nearly as often as he should. But as long as Cas is with him, he thinks that maybe one day he could learn to say it without hesitation.
Castiel can’t deny it. The thought of Dean marching in here and boldly declaring that he was going to save him has crossed his mind more than once. He doesn’t ever let himself fully believe that it’ll happen- but a part of him desperately wishes it would, mostly so he could see Dean again in some form. Having him in memories and illusions is better than not having him at all. He had kept that part of himself deeply concealed in the hopes that the Shadow wouldn't use it against him- but it seems that it's far too late for that.
“What,
too much power.
“You think you can just pop in here without me noticing?” The Shadow stalks closer, face devoid of any teasing snark they might have had before. “You think you can just walk in here and take him from me? Castiel and I had a
He looks over to Cas whose eyes are now trained solely on him. His expression is lax as always, but his eyes shine with that same unreadable emotion they have had this entire time. Sam doesn’t know what it means, doesn’t know what he’s supposed to do. He sends a prayer over to Cas, begs for him to do something, to tell him what to do.
The feeling of death greets Sam with open arms and the cold descent into nothingness feels like an old friend. However, it isn’t often he has the opportunity to see his own corpse lying purposeless on the ground. His eyes are wide open, the hazel dulled with the final remnants of his own fear. His lips are pulled into the shape of his last word, ‘Dean!’, and he swears his voice still echoes from the damp walls.
“Don’t,” Sam cuts him off quietly, “this isn’t on you. That girl really thought she was helping those people, she said she wanted to help me. What happened to her anyway, I saw you shoot the other two but I didn’t see her?”
There’s no pressure, no shouting, no anything for that matter. If Dean reaches further into his mind it’s empty, it’s just him alone in his own body like he’s always been.
The ringing of a gunshot startles him out of the comfortable blackness that had begun overtaking his vision. He looks down, catching sight of one of the men falling to the ground, followed quickly by the other. He doesn’t know where the girl had gone, but she is nowhere to be seen.
TW: SELF-HARM BEHAVIORS AND SUICIDAL IDEATION
Footsteps are what finally break the stillness, and Sam perks up. They’re coming from further into the cave, from where they’d originally entered he realizes. He needs to get someone to see him, to hear him. He follows the sound, struggling to ignore the darkness as it closes even further around him; he presses on.
Moments pass before Dean is sagging like a puppet with its strings cut, Castiel’s grip is the only reason he doesn’t hit the ground. Anger settles in his eyes and yet even that fizzles out leaving tears he refuses to let fall.
“Just like Michael to break my toys,” Lucifer’s speaking again, Sam allows his voice to pull him from dark thoughts. The grace trails through his head taking what must have been a concussion with it and Sam’s vision clears, he can feel the swelling of his eyes go down and his nose rebuilding itself. He doesn’t realize he’d been tasting blood until that too is taken away, “He’s always had anger issues, never learned how to really cope with these things, you know?”
Pain explodes through his hand, caught off guard he can’t stop the shout. Glancing over his eyes land on the hilt of the demon blade he’d only just been wondering about, the blade which is currently pierced through the back of his hand and into the floor. Blood leaks steadily from around the engraved knife, staining the floor in a red that looks almost black in the emergency lights. Sam’s stomach twists. He tests his hand, moving it just slightly, he grunts as it shoots pain up his arm. It’s pinned, the knife dug firmly into the tiled ground below his palm, unless he wants to completely ruin his hand it’s stuck, and without his other hand to pull it out he’s screwed. He only begins to really worry when his fingers go numb after a few moments.
He yelps at the first tug, it pulls his arms upward sending a minor ache through his shoulders at the awkward angle, as it continues he struggles to get his legs underneath him, to deter the inevitable as long as possible.
“Or you can continue with your little silent treatment,” Lucifer continues making a show of circling the two chairs, “and I’ll make you watch them both die--slowly-- painfully. Up to you.”
“I mean look at you, the perfect canvas,” Lucifer sighs and it borders on fond, he’s being extremely gentle again and somehow that’s what finally breaks any remaining solace Sam had managed to scrape up, “and he wastes all that opportunity just to smack you around. You’re too good for that-- he doesn’t understand how perfect you can be-- I can make you perfect, Sam.”
He grunts as the weight of his body is put on his shoulders, pain sparks up in his shoulder blades sending a tingling sensation down each of his arms. He pulls upward, tries to angle his body so his shoulders don’t dislocate themselves. He’s only half successful, as he is pulled higher and higher his body threatens to give out, the panic shooting through his veins doesn’t help. His arms strain as he struggles to stay angled, he doesn’t know how long he’ll be able to hold position but the alternative isn’t any better.
“What do you mean, ‘what’? I’m leaving you both here-
“You know what? This is
Why can’t you let us try for you?” He stepped closer, speaking a bit softer this time. “Let
Cas says he’s content like this. Just being whatever Dean needs him to be. But he’s not a tool and Dean knows what he really wants, what he’ll convince himself that he’s okay with not having. He’s done the same thing to himself- forced himself out of wanting something out of a belief that he'll never be able to have it anyway.
God, he can’t even

gonna do to stop me? Even if you were strong enough to do anything, I don’t think you could lay a hand on Dean Winchester.”
"Don't-"
“You’re kidding me! It ends there?!” Dean whines, groaning afterwards as the credits roll.
Maybe it's just God mojo in the end, but whatever it is, Dean doesn't question it.
Dean’s eyes widen to the size of dinner plates. “No no, that can’t be true. You… you’ve been
Dean abruptly stands up from the bed. “We’ve had this discussion already, Cas. Let’s not keep going in circles.”
“You’re remembering him how you need to.”
use hot water,” Dean tells him. “Cold water doesn’t kill all the nasty stuff.” He grabs the towel hanging up nearby and tosses it at Cas. “Do me a favor and dry these off for me, would you?”
As the next episode finally begins to play, Dean’s eyes drift over to Cas. The television’s soft glow enlightens his facial features as he watches intently. Who would have ever thought? Castiel, angel of the Lord, laying next to him in bed? It was crazy enough that another man was beside him. But for some reason, Dean can’t really bring himself to feel even slightly uncomfortable. With Cas, it doesn’t feel strange.
“But then you- you looked at me with that stupid fucking look in your eye just now, and after you said that I remembered just how fucking much I-"
"And I already forgave you," he adds. "A while ago. I was never mad at you, really. All I wanted was for you to forgive me."
“I don’t know what would’ve happened if Jack hadn’t been there to pull you out,” Dean says. “But I just want you to know that I would never give up on you, okay? I never would’ve left you in there to die.”
God, he sounds so… so fucking
“I didn’t mind. I’ve wanted to kiss you for a long time.”
“Whatever.”
“Hello!”
He lifts the necklace by the chain and places it around his neck. Dean gently touches the vial and lets out a shaky breath. “Holy shit,” he says. “This is… this is
deep down, what Cas was really saying to him, no matter how much he'd tried to convince himself otherwise, no matter how much he'd tried to insist that Cas couldn't have possibly meant it in the way he thought he did- the way he
And the Shadow, of course, knows that better than anyone.
“Then so be it.”
“Sure, if Cas wants it back.” Jack turns to face him and offers him the vial. “Here you go!"
“He made a

trust Jack, and he believes in him. He has no reason not to. More than anything- he wishes he could say he's always believed in him the way Cas and Sam have, and it's one of his biggest regrets. "It's the Empty I don't trust. What if they're stronger than Jack, what if they-"
Dean asks quietly.
A small gasp escapes Dean as he mirrors Cas’ smile, tears starting to form ever so slowly in his own eyes. “It means a lot, Cas. And I… I forgive you too. For everything.”
He just likes Cas. Everything about him.
. So if there is any way that I can stop it, I’ll take it. Because Cas has given up too damn much for me and I can’t just sit here and watch him become something that he clearly doesn’t want to be.”
. His smile falls and he shifts his focus back to the road.
Cas doesn't seem all that surprised by the admission. And why would he, after knowing him so well for so long? "...Right. Of course."
Yet in all of this- he hadn’t once considered how Cas felt. Not at all.

He meets Jack's eyes, silently pleading with him. He hopes that Jack can see through him now, can see his determination.
The headlights of the car passing by them illuminate the Impala and Dean swears that for a second, just for a split second, he can see the faint outline of Castiel’s broken and torn wing against the window. It was impossible, considering that when Cas died he had no wings, but it’s a dream, so he’s learned to sort of just go with this sort of thing.

“Of course you do, it’s just…” Dean stops and takes a long swig of beer. He figures that at this point there's no getting out of it. “I… whenever I think about it I just… I just wanna fucking

Sam. The longer we wait, the longer he’s stuck there!”
“Losing my powers would be a small price to pay to spend a lifetime on Earth with you.”
“What do they mean ‘loud’?” Sam questions curiously.
He's been preparing himself for Jack's eventual departure- but hearing it still stings deep. “So you’re… you’re still gonna leave,” he says quietly. He's not sure why he was expecting anything else.
Dean follows the path of his gaze to his pillow.
“You know, once all this is over-
Dean hates that he can’t really deny it.
“...I know,” Jack says quietly. “It’s okay, you don’t have to say it. I understand. You feel responsible. I feel responsible too. But I need you to trust me on this. Trust that I can save him. Can you do that?”
“Dean, it’s okay, really-”
that something is definitely off with this place.
Dean glances over at Sam, then Cas, then again at Jack- before a huge smile breaks out across his face. He walks right over to him and pulls him into a tight hug. "Of course you can. This is your home too.”
Cas’ small smile stretches into a grin as he places his hand atop Dean’s. Neither of them say anything more; and after a moment Cas hits play on
“...Well then ask me,” Cas boldly retorts, a hint of a smile on his lips. “Ask me to stay.”
the parents. Don’t you watch any TV?”
But if it's for Cas, he thinks that perhaps this once he can make an exception.
Dean’s eyes go wide and his heart starts to beat faster as he recalls their last moments before Cas was swept away by the Empty. He’s not an idiot. He
“I don’t know. I do not know where angels go after they die. No one does.”
If you had hope that the Winchesters were gonna bust you out, then think again.”
. And now… now with you leaving, I don’t know if we’ll ever-”
Intrigued, Castiel fixes his gaze on them. “What are you talking about?”
Long story short, Dean ended up getting the angel (and himself) completely trashed. He wasn’t quite sure how he could manage to feel the full effects of drunkenness in his sleep, but right now that hardly mattered. He liked this sassier version of Castiel, and in a bittersweet moment, he wished he had done this with him when he was alive.
The Shadow rolls their eyes. “Please, Castiel- don’t get cute with me. You’re in no position to have an attitude.”
Dean’s teasing grin abruptly drops, and Sam looks between the two of them, clearly confused. “...Is it just me, or is Cas pissier than usual?” he asks quietly.
“Like?”
Dean thinks he’s about to be sick.
Dean laughs nervously again and moves closer as well- without really commanding his body to do so. “The truth is, I can’t stop thinking about you, and I haven’t been able to stop since the moment you left. Every second after that all I could think about was you. But then… then you came back. And I should’ve walked right up to you then and told you how I felt because you deserved to hear it.

been part of his morning routine. “Let’s get this show on the road. How do we do this?”
to lose himself in Cas.
Cas, who was quite a few feet in front of them, suddenly stops at the doorway of the house and sharply turns around to face them. “I am still an angel, you know. If you want to talk about me behind my back, I would recommend doing it at a further distance.”
But that doesn’t mean there won’t be side effects. A battle of that size- a battle that would be
He and Cas haven’t taken their eyes off each other. His brain had gotten every detail of him right, because when Cas spoke, he looked the other person directly in the eye, like he was staring into their soul. He felt it every time he locked eyes with the angel, like Cas was looking right through him. Cas looks so damn sincere and Dean feels like he’s losing control, like this wasn’t just his dream anymore. This was cold hard reality, slapping him in the face. “Please just tell me that you’re not lying. Being crazy I can take, but not doing anything when you’re out there somewhere? There’s no way. If there’s a way to save you and I missed it because I wasn’t looking, then I won’t be able to live with that Cas. I won’t. So please… don’t lie to me. Is this real?”

while Michael keeps me locked in my own head, drowning me for the rest of time.” He reached up and gently removed Cas’ hand from his shoulder. His hand moved down to grip Cas’ wrist. It twitched, almost like he wanted to move it lower, but he released it with a small huff. “I can’t do that. I can’t. I’m not strong enough for that. But I just might be strong enough to do this. This is all the strength I have left. So please don’t take this from me, Cas,
. “If you want, you know… after we have meals or whatever, you could help me do this. Get some practice in. But it’s up to you. You don’t have to-”
to be angry with me for letting
. Take Castiel. He’s not worth the damage that a battle with you would cause.”
“Of course I have,” Dean says defensively. “He doesn’t want to do anything about it. He doesn’t think there’s anything that can be done. I tried to get him to pray to Jack, but he won’t do it." He looks over at Cas again and grumbles "stubborn ass" under his breath.
“Why are you giving me the pity eyes?” Dean asks defensively.
he continues. He softens his voice for fear of the room caving in around them. “You were the one who taught me that, Dean. That there is always a choice.”
. But Dean can see the way his eyes brighten, almost as though he has a small bit of hope for something more than their usual conversations. (Or in this case, argument) “Hey there, Cas. Mind if I come in?”
has to try to fix this. Chuck didn’t just damage
“...Yeah. We did,” he says proudly.
“He’s suffered enough,” Jack says definitively.
Cas doesn’t move away from him, which Dean takes as a good sign. “If you’re asking for my permission, then the answer is yes. But you don’t ever need to ask me.”
. H-He’s there and he’s
can’t bring himself to say it, no matter how much he knows he should. Cas had spoken his truth- so why was it so hard for him to speak his?
Why does that have to be so bad? Can he not, just this once… just this
“That depends on you, Dean,” Castiel replies idly.
Cas doesn't say anything- but he doesn't have to. Dean knows that he's there. He's listening. Waiting. Letting Dean say what he needs to say at his own pace.
with the urge to run. But Cas wants him to stay and he doesn’t want to say no to him this time, because he thinks that if he does- he’ll only break them further. So he keeps his feet planted firmly on the floor and nods reluctantly.
Dread crept up his body, starting at his feet and traveling slowly upward until he felt it sitting thick and heavy in his stomach and chest. He felt sick. “Where is he now?”
And then again as a rebel- a fallen angel, choosing humanity- choosing
“I do. Would I have stayed with you this long if I didn’t?”
Dean quickly puts two and two together and isn't all that surprised to learn that Jack had been listening in. “Jack-”
“Everyone sleeps in the Empty,” Jack says, “but after the bomb went off, I think I woke some people up. And the Shadow wasn’t happy about that. If those people are awake, the Shadow can’t go back to sleep- and that’s what they want the most.”
“Were we
Dean suddenly comes crashing back down to Earth from the hopeful high he'd been on for all of thirty seconds. “What do you mean it’s not that simple?” he asks, becoming somewhat frantic as he suddenly feels the world spinning a whole lot faster. “You- you’re
“There’s nothing that can be done for them now,” Cas says grimly. “At this point, burning their bones is doing them a favor.” He pulls the broken twin-sized bed away from the wall before sinking down to his knees.
“Here,” Dean says as he sets a bottle of beer down in front of Cas. “You earned it.”
“You will,” Cas says firmly. “I know you will. And if this is what you want, Jack- if this is
“That’s bullshit,” Dean argues. “Jack is God now. He can do anything. Fixing Cas shouldn’t be a problem, right?”
well! What the hell, why did no one wake me up?!”

. He’s
“I’m definitely dreaming,” Dean concludes. “The real Cas isn’t this hard to figure out.”
“Do I have to say it again?”
His voice breaks ever so slightly, and that's when Castiel comes to the realization that he wasn't wrong to believe.
After a few hours, he resigns himself to another all-nighter. And with Sam knocked out on one of the beds, Dean takes that as his opportunity to slip outside, walking out to one of the vending machines for a soda.
"I can drive," Cas offers from the backseat. "I don't need sleep- I can take over for the remaining few hours."
Dean hates to think about that- about how he's probably right. About the reality that he'd be living in right now if it weren't for Jack.
“You are. Knock it off. It’s weirding me out.” Dean pushes past Sam and grabs his jacket that was hanging off the chair.
Cas looks like he wants to argue- but he reluctantly nods and lowers his hand again.
It’s the third night in a row now that Dean has dreamed about Castiel. He’s starting to think that these dreams aren’t ever going to stop. And although at one point he thought he could accept that, now... now he wasn't so sure.
“I… I know you said you felt like you had to do all of this. To make up for what happened. But Jack, I… I want you to know that I never wanted this. I know I made it sound like I was happy I was sacrificing you but that’s not true. I
“Hello Dean.”
Thing is, Dean's getting a little tired of being told to just sit there and look pretty while all the fights go down. He wants- desperately, more than anything- to be a part of this- a part of saving Cas. “So we just have to sit here with our thumbs up our asses?” he asks, frustrated.
“Hello Sam,” Cas greets. If he was annoyed by Sam's interruption, he certainly didn't show it. “You’re usually asleep at this hour.”
“That’s fine. Just getting to be here with you again- it’s more than I ever could’ve hoped for. Being here with you and Sam- hunting monsters and saving lives. Watching you eat far more than a human should be capable of eating at restaurants. Movie nights at the bunker.
but safer.
He can’t stop now- the words keep pouring out uncontrollably like the tears in his eyes. He's not sure where all of this is coming from but he doesn't doubt for a second that it's true. “And I’m
“...I know you’re worried about Cas,” Jack says as he nervously shuffles around Dean's bed. “I’m worried about him too.”
The Shadow shrugs and lazily puts their hands in their jacket pockets. If they're lying, they're dragging it out- and they're playing the part well. “Not sure. Can’t tell yet- that’s just my guess. But I gotta admit- I’m surprised anyone cares enough about you to bother. Why not just let your legacy live on as a bittersweet memory? They just can't seem to let go, can they? Talk about
But now he can’t help but wonder if he’s doing their friendship a disservice by not answering him.
When he arrived, Sam was outside waiting for him, appearing distraught- nowadays that seemed to be the only expression he wore.
Castiel practically gapes at Dean. He stares at him with wide eyes and gives him a near-exact replica of Sam’s bitchface. He doesn’t speak, for the sheer
Cas out of that shithole. End of story.”
“If that’s what you want.”
Sam looks up from his mug, intrigued. “You’ve got a plan? Already?”
The screams of the awakened in the Empty sound far too much like the screams of the damned in Hell.
Sam laughs and tries to hide his face behind a beer bottle. “Let’s just say, we talked some things out, and… I think a third date is definitely in our future.”
Cas vanishes, and Dean is immediately thrown into consciousness. The familiar surroundings of his bedroom start to come into view.
“Let me talk to him.”
“...Alright,” Dean says as he shuts the water off. “Next, I’ll teach you how to do the laundry.”
Dean knows exactly why. It’d be far too painful to do so. He almost wishes that he was able to do the same, but apparently his brain was dead-set on torturing him.
And that’s when it hits him.
“Oh, you know it is.” The Shadow suddenly drops him. He manages to land on his feet, but before he can orient himself they’re pulling him close. “This what you wanted?” they taunt as a hand comes up to cradle his cheek. “In all that time, how many times did you think about having this?”
Jack nods. "Of course. Anything."
Dean finishes pulling his shirt over his head before sitting on the bed across from Castiel. “Why do you never visit Sam’s dreams?”
Sam, who looks just as exhausted as he does, holds his hands up to stop him. “Dean, hold your horses a sec. We just got back and you only stopped maybe
your problem, Dean. It was your problem with me, too. You can’t let yourself believe that
"He's been preparing for this. He's ready." Sam stands up and claps a hand against his shoulder. "It's gonna work. I know this is difficult for you, but for once- have a little faith."
“Yeah, um... about that… look Cas,” Dean starts awkwardly, “you told me before that your powers were failing and I totally blew you off. And I’m sorry. That wasn’t fair to you. Even when we were fighting, I should’ve put my crap aside and helped you.”
Dean remarks, smirking.
Before Dean can retort, there’s another flap of angel wings and Cas is gone.
“But I
Cas sighs and looks out the window, like he was expecting this. “This is something I’ve slowly come to accept over the years. My Grace has been failing for a while.”
It’s like being a young adult again- stepping out into the world on your own for the first time without your parents holding your hand. Only in the case of him and Sam- they never had a mother to hold their hands, and their father never cared enough to do that for them.
feeling- he can’t even
He smiles warmly at him and closes his eyes. “I wish… I could’ve saved Cas. I wish I could’ve told him that I’m sorry for everything. I wish… I wish he was still here.”
. Cas had mentioned a ‘moment of true happiness’ before. He wants Cas to find that moment without having a deal with a cosmic entity hanging over his head.
He doesn't think that in his lifetime he'll ever reach a point where he can forgive himself for that, even if Cas forgives him.
“Cas-“
His reservations still pop up here and there. It’s not always easy and more often than not he has to distract himself from the bitter memories that pop into his brain at the worst of times.
“Man, we
. Dean supposes that he can relate to that.
Cas pulls the blanket tighter over his shoulders. “What is it Dean?” His tone implies that he’s clearly exasperated, but genuinely curious. Dean wasn’t exactly known for knocking on people’s doors to have late-night conversations with them.

Dean shakes his head. “Cas, look man, you’re here now, okay? And you don’t have to feel like a burden. You’re… you’re

Cas smiles tenderly. “I could sense it. I could sense that something was different about you. And once we got out of the Empty I knew. You didn’t just defeat Chuck. You’ve taken his place.”

Needless to say, Dean wakes up that morning with a headache.
Sam to reconnect with Eileen ever since Jack restored humankind, and while he'd never pressure his brother into any relationship, he's hoping that this one works out. He already considers Eileen family- and her getting serious with Sam would only further solidify that. “Oh really? And what’d she say?”
“So what, are you saying you don’t want to?” he asks point blank.
Dean doesn’t have to ask to know what Sam’s talking about as he strolls into the garage. “Right. Says the one who hasn’t even called Eileen yet to ask her out on a second date.”
Dean chooses to ignore that comment, although he knows he shouldn’t.
“And ultimately it ended up being a

Sam sighs in exasperation. “Look, Dean, your mind is probably just trying to help you come to grips with what happened. We’re both still grieving, so this is just a way of coping.”
“This is going to sting,” Cas warns. “But it’s necessary. Bear with me.”

“Yeah- and nine times out of ten we were also the ones who endangered it in the first place. Most of the time we were just trying to fix the mess we made.”
“I guess not,” he agrees. “What are you doing here, then? Surely you have more important things to do than torture me, I mean…” He gestures all around them, “I’m sure you’ve heard all the noise.”
Sam makes his way over as well, draping his arms over Jack and Dean’s shoulders. “You don’t have to give us up. Come by whenever you want.”
Dean ignores the misty-eyed look Sam gives him.
Sam isn’t quite sure what to make of it. Dean’s mood swings were unpredictable as of late. “Well… what’s wrong?”
“Sorry.”

Dean’s face softens, as it always does when Sam’s voice goes quiet like that. He sighs loudly in resignation. “It’s gonna work, Sam. I’m gonna make it work. You’ll see.”
“Sorry! It’s just me, promise. Not Jesus.” Jack looks around his pillow curiously. “Um… no gun this time?”
