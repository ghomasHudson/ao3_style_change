"My aspiring whale scientist." He doesn't even attempt to hide the fondness he feels. "Zoology is a good look on you.
As soon as he reappears on the other side of the door, Steve takes in the space around him. It’s dark and silent inside; Sam isn’t there. Dammit.
Sam points his wand at Steve next, while Steve’s mind races. It takes him several seconds to process the text in front of him.
As he twists his wand in the air, preparing to disappear from the lab as he was told to do, Steve is hit with the uncomfortable sensation of all the air leaving his lungs—and he knows it’s not just the feeling of disapparating affecting him.
And the slight upward bend at the corner of her mouth makes it seem like she knows it, too. She's got a Mona Lisa smile—if the Mona Lisa was nearly 20 meters long and covered in blubber, anyway.
one," Steve argues, getting incensed. Who else knew what an auror even was, let alone about the Bureau? "Who the hell are you working for, Tony?"
Tony gives a quick, surreptitious glance around, as if to make sure they aren't being watched, and, satisfied that the staff and other patrons are too busy annoying each other to see whatever he is about to do, he opens the briefcase.
"Uh," Steve mumbles, trying to think on his feet. "The boy, Kyle. You don't think... his dad will take all that out on him, do you?"
Steve references the folded copy of the report Bobbi gave him. An older gentleman had lived here—a classical portkey craftsman. No one could confirm whether he had been caught up in the blast or not—there was no trace of him to be found afterward, no bones, teeth, wand core, anything. But given that no one had seen him in several days, it was assumed that perhaps he was; the explosion had been so violent, perhaps he was completely disintegrated.
Steve feels his heart swell up with conflicting emotions—joy, at the idea of a young Tony having this pivotal moment of discovery, and a deep sadness, for what Tony was surely about to tell him next.
Steve doesn’t have time to dodge. He’s hit full on, and pain racks his entire body. His vision whites out and his mouth hangs slack; he can’t even hear himself scream.
- The Bar With No Doors is, of course, where Dr Strange, Wanda, Brother Voodoo and all the canon magic users in 616 hang out.
"Yeah?" He gives Tony a sheepish half-smile, and gets a little reassuring squeeze of Tony's hand as a reward.
While the rest of the team slowly files out of the room, whispering to one another about what they've just seen, Steve is out of his seat and across the room before Sam—or anyone else—can get a word in edgewise.
“In about… one minute,” Tony answers cryptically, glancing quickly at the surrounding tables, then back at Steve.
“Thank you,” he says, waving the sheets in her direction before folding them up and inserting them into his jacket pocket.
Steve steps in between the man and Tony, blocking Tony with his body. “I wouldn’t, if I were you,” Steve warns the man.
It looks for a moment like Tony might be sporting a bit of color on his cheeks as well, but he pivots on his heel and heads out of the room before Steve can be sure.
Steve is loathe to admit it, but Doom is... beautiful. His features are sharp, his skin unblemished. He's extraordinarily handsome. Steve isn't sure if his true face looked like this once, or if it's a ruse, a glamor.
Maybe this was a bad idea. Maybe he won’t be able to get Rhodes to come around on this. He’s still going to need a way to fight Doom. He should look for an alternative form of backup.
“What?” Tony takes another step backward, as if trying to propel himself away from Steve’s distasteful words. “NO! God, no. FAB would never approve of us. They’ll actively try to shut us down—if they even deign to take us seriously, that is. We have to stay off their radar.” He scoffs. “It’s not like we’re going to be working with the NYPD, either.”
"Hopefully better. Or no, not better, but at least adjusting more smoothly. I had a couple rocky starts."
He sighs, looking sad and resigned. “Can’t. Go back to your place. Or invite you back to mine. Not tonight.” Tony pushes his body the rest the way away from from Steve, leaving him a little chilly in the cool spring air.
Tony pulls back just slightly, reaching behind his back and grabbing one of Steve's hands, sliding it brazenly over his ass.
Whatever look Steve has on his face must be enough to push Tony over the edge to a decision, because he glances at DUM-E, giving the bot a wan half-smile.
The noise echoing in the bustling MACUSA foyer—the sound of hundreds of witches and wizards making their way to the building’s dozens of levels to begin their day—is considerable, but the shout from behind Steve cuts through it, and through Steve’s memories as well. He turns, and spies Agent Sam Wilson pushing through the crowd toward him. Steve pauses so his partner can catch up.
“Hey, man, it’s kinda crowded in here already—” one gentleman begins to protest, but Steve’s wand is at the ready before he can finish his sentence.
Giggling, they order the Taste of the Italy platter, and, while picking at too soft pasta slathered in inauthentic sauce, Tony talks a little more about himself, revealing a bit more about the man behind the machines.
Lower to the ground, near to the panels on the opposite side of the room, there's a rush of movement that grabs Tony's attention. For a second he thinks it might be whales, or Dr. Nu'val in the water, but he blinks and his eyes refocus in the half-light: it's definitely on this side of the transparent aluminum.
and Steve’s out of the elevator, leaving most of the nomajs inside speechless—save for what sounds like one young girl, whom Steve can hear pronouncing it the ‘best ride EVER’, before he casts a locking
"C'mon inside," Tony invites Steve. "We should talk. I'll make you tea, Roger. If that is, in fact, your real name."
you?” the father hisses at the child. He’s waving something in the air angrily—a nomaj toy of some kind. A horse? No, a unicorn. A purple one, with pink streaks in its hair.
,” Sam says. He surveys Steve’s injuries and calls over some mediwizards, who start the application of anti-shock charms and healing potions; Steve begins to feel better immediately.
"Steve,” Steve tells him plainly. “Steve Rogers.” It feels good to say out loud, not to lie anymore.
What were these other people like? Who was the team leader? What were they trying to achieve as a group? How could Steve continue working at FAB and also be... what was it? An Avenger?
“Those are… interesting names,” Steve comments, taking the mug. “Ah, thank you?” he offers the DUM-E, who actually coos. It’s incredibly sweet.
Tony nods against Steve's shoulder, considering, before looking into Steve’s eyes. “That’s fair," Tony agrees. "I mean… it’d take at least two."
“Nice patch,” she says, sincerely. “One of those new... retro things, right? It looks really good. Authentic.”
Should he just... leave? No, he can't—he still has so many questions for Tony—but he's caused so much hurt already. He doesn't want to make it worse.
"Welcome to the Olive Garden," the server greets them, not sounding all that welcoming, while depositing a basket of breadsticks on the table. "Times Square," she adds, as if that bit wasn't completely obvious. “I’ll be back in a few moments to take your orders.”
...” Steve says warily, but Tony pulls him into a kiss before he can utter another word, and Steve has the good sense not to protest that.
“They’ll be here in a half hour,” Tony explains. “When the meeting officially starts. I thought we might want a minute… you know, alone.”
Steve imagines Tony behind bars, or, worse, having his soul torn from his body by a hovering cloaked creature, and feels a sharp twisting in his chest.
"A fizzer?" Tony tries again. "That's an old, old word for it—I don't know anyone who uses that one anymore."
“I can tell you’re both, ah, men of action. You want to get moving, go hands on... I understand that impulse,” Rhodes paces toward them, sympathizing. “Maybe a personalised tour of a couple of our divisions would be more your speed? It just so happens that two of our Lead Engineers are available for the next hour, and they’d be happy to show you around. There’s Reed Richards, who can take one of you down to Biology—”
And it's not just a lusty crush, either. Tony is attractive, of course, but it's so much more than that. It's his energy, his ambition, his drive: it's infectious.
Steve tries not to openly eye the folder. As far as he can tell, no one has made any progress with the explosions while he’s been assigned to RI; Brand’s new info seems to confirm his suspicion. Whoever is behind this, they’re good at covering their tracks.
“Kyle,” Tony turns and addresses the boy. The boy looks up at Tony, wide-eyed. “I was just talking with my buddy Roger about how
Normally Steve would assume this was innuendo, Tony giving them a chance to (heh) experiment in the lab.
“A dark parasite that grows in a young witch or wizard when they are forced to suppress their powers,” Steve explains. “They can become extremely dangerous. Grindelwald—”
As they reach the edge of the balcony, Steve's spell finally manages to tag the edge of the invisibility cloak, snagging the edge of it like an invisible hand. Steve yanks back with his wand, and the cloak comes with it, releasing from the figure's body.
Steve takes a deep breath as he hears a repeated ringing sound, followed by the “click” he has come to associate with nomaj calls reaching their destination and being answered.
He feels like he’s been chewed up by a dragon and spit back out, but Steve can feel some of his healing power kicking in. Steve has always handled magical wounds better than other wizards since Project Solstice. He’s out of combat and relatively safe now; he’ll recover… so long as he doesn’t have to move much for a few days.
Even here—maybe especially here—among the vacationers clad in tacky t-shirts and khaki shorts, Tony looks
I don't know how it was in your day, but people can be really prejudiced even now. They actually told her, to her face, when she was pregnant with me, that her mudblood baby would never amount to anything."
He and Sam approach the massive, arching reception desk in the lobby, and they peer over the counter to see a middle-aged woman with dark hair, wearing cat-eye glasses. She has something of the appearance of a librarian—wise, sharp, and perhaps warm as well.
“Thank you for coming to save me. I was worried if you did, Doom would try to use your power to turn you into a bomb. In a way, I almost hoped you wouldn’t try to come for me.” He looks back up at Steve warmly. “But you did anyway.”
But Redwing sails down the hall, back toward the front door, grabbing something off the ground with his claws before returning to Steve.
Before Tony can take another breath, Steve has thrust himself into Tony's personal space, his cheek brushing Tony's own, a few centimeters at most separating the length of their bodies, all while his posture remains rigid, official. To anyone else watching, Steve is simply conveying some private information, when in fact, he's pushing all of Tony's buttons simultaneously and repeatedly in front of a room of strangers.
Slowly, gently, U wiggles her way onto Steve’s outstretched arm, while Rhodes pauses, taking in Steve’s words.
Even at little sidewalk shops, it’s all tech now, no spellcasting necessary. It’s silly, probably, but Steve misses old Mr. McDonagh flicking his wrist and using
A ball of light shoots up from the center of the room, and hovers there, illuminating the passageway. It’s much as Steve had thought: mostly featureless, walls of concrete bordering them on all sides.
“Please,” he gasps out yet again, and he’s not even really sure what he’s begging for. And Steve, the unbelievable bastard that he is, calls him on it.
Tony leans back, mouth open in shock. “The shield was real?! Oh, god, I can't believe I didn't ask you about it before. Was it made of adamantium? I've heard about these new adamantium wand cores—"
He cants his hips up and thrusts forward almost too quickly, slipping inside the sleeve as he slides halfway off of Steve's cock. Lube gushes noisily out of the sleeve, onto his balls and the sheets below. Then Steve squeezes, and all the metallic baubles inside the stroker rub up against Tony’s dick in the most fantastic ways.
He glances around the lobby trying to catch sight of the figure. The shine of brass details at the reception desk and light reflecting off chandeliers gives Steve momentary pause, but he finally sees the signature glints of light racing up one of the grand staircases, and then turning toward another stairwell.
“Everyone on active field duty. Besides,” Stoner shuffles the photos into a neat stack. “I already gave your partner your assignment earlier; you really should have talked to him first.”
Tony only looks away for a second, glancing at Steve. Blue-white light dances across the planes of his face, a refraction of the water all around them. His eyes are locked on the camera feed, just like everyone else in the room with them, his attention rapt.
Steve stands unmoving, speechless, watching Tony until he walks behind a partition wall, and out of Steve’s line of sight.
"Anyway, I can only imagine they try not to think about that part of it," Steve continues. "It's probably just nice to be alive and not have to worry about being held captive, or hunted."
Tony tells Steve the whole story—how he tricked the staff at Ollivander’s in Hogsmeade, how he bought everything in sight at Honeydukes because he knew he might never get to return, how he even snuck a sip of butterbeer at the Three Broomsticks.
to be the man in Tony’s comic books. Oh, he already is, he supposes, in some ways. But he wants to inspire Tony himself, as he truly is, and be as good and kind and strong as the man Tony read about in his darkest moments.
Under a swooping arc, the line of flight made by some kind of magical bird, it looks like, is the word—or rather, the name—in all capital letters:
“We don’t,” Steve agrees gently. “Not right now, if you really don’t want to. But I was curious what made you think of it tonight.”
Instead, he has to pretend to be knowledgeable about pizza places he’s never been to and rock bands he’s never heard of.
"It's beautiful," Steve whispers, staring up at the image, awed. "It's perfect for you." He laughs. "In more ways than one."
At least fifteen feet tall, its long, serpentine neck uncoils, arcing down over Steve menacingly. Its mouth opens, releasing a high-pitched cry.
“Because,” Steve starts, quietly channelling every ounce of distress he’s feeling into his tone as he waits patiently for the occamy to respond. “There’s a chance this could end up with someone getting murdered, and there is no way in hell I am letting Tony—
long? And have been working alongside me for at least a week? Didn’t even you bother to bug my lab?” He laughs sardonically. “How are you not hip to the fact that I’m a squib, Doom? That is some
Their cackling echoes so loudly in the lab that it actually wakes up U, who puffs up to twice the size she was when sleeping, and gives an irritated snuffle.
,” Tony says, defensive. He walks to the end the table to retrieve U, who’s been woken up by the shouting. “Is that the only thing you think is important?” he challenges Steve, draping the occamy about his shoulders.
The circle has a beautiful red and gold geometric pattern etched into one side, and the other appears to be blank… until you move it, and it catches the light, which reveals text that just says ‘hi there.’
"No," Tony says, adamant. Increasingly, he sounds as angry and incredulous as Steve did out on the landing.
“There’s also this stuff called anti-matter. It has some things in common with matter, but some ways, it’s matter’s polar opposite, too. It’s hard to explain. The most interesting thing about it, though, is it’s incredibly rare, and no one can really explain
“I can.” Tony stands his ground, staring Steve down. His voice changes; his words are careful, deliberate, as if he’s quoting a speech.
“U,” Steve grits out, pushing back on Doom’s spell with every ounce of strength he can muster. “Get Sam! Rhodes—”
"It's not illegal," he says, not answering Steve's question directly. "So what’s the—oh," Tony face falls, his delight from mere moments ago draining away. "I’m not a wizard. That’s it, isn’t it?"
It’s meant to be a peck, Steve can tell, more performative than anything, a gesture to further enrage Kyle’s cretin of a dad.
As she replaces the empty basket with a full one, she sighs tiredly, and glances back and forth between Tony and Steve.
at Doom with his off-hand. He doesn’t even bother to use his wand, raw emotion erupting from him as a powerful attack.
Steve looks down at Tony. He takes a deep breath in, and Tony’s stomach clenches. “I was wondering if we could talk about… the thing you brought up earlier tonight. About us, starting a ‘pod’.”
Back on the monitor, the edges of the blobs sharpen and form ichthyoid outlines. After what seems like an eternity—probably about ten seconds in reality—a shimmer breaks the surface: a cloud of mist bursts from one massive blowhole, then a second, and a third smaller one.
“We’ll see what we come up with, he says, satisfied, stepping away from the keyboard to let the program run.
Steve takes a deep breath and focuses on Tony’s right hand sliding reciprocally around his back, Tony’s breath rising and falling, and the delicious warmth curling in him where their bodies meet. He looks down at Tony, and Tony looks lazily back up at him, those deep blue eyes sparkling in the lights of the shining billboards all around them.
U snorts, seemingly in derision, and curls closer to Tony's neck. Tony picks up his jet boots, and turns, padding barefoot into the lab.
that rapport with the falcon that nearly always accompanies him. Sam raised Redwing from an abandoned egg, and ever since then, one always seems to know what the other is thinking or feeling; they communicate without Sam having to say a word. The bird has been so helpful with Sam's case work, in fact, that Director Stoner actually made him an official part of the force.
It reminds him of the first time he saw his mom enchanting a broom to move on its own, doing the housework for her, and realized that not every family had the special abilities that his did.
A waitress, the same one who indulged Tony’s breadstick shenanigans, is already approaching the man, probably to confront him about making a scene, but the man intercepts her before she can even admonish him.
together—there would be no way the Auror’s Bureau—or any MACUSA division, for that matter—wouldn’t want to hire someone as accomplished as Tony clearly was; with such a brilliant understanding of nomaj tech as well, he’d be a shoe-in.
"I want to talk about what you said," he tells Tony, his tone as gentle and earnest as Tony's ever heard it. "Please. Let's discuss it. Tonight?"
“The Vambraces of Erskinus,” Doom announces. “Or least, what’s left of them. One of the most powerful artifacts ever created, capable of channeling untold amounts of magic. I’ve used several conduits over the course of my trials, but this one could be the key to my success. I suppose the good
There’s a faint… beeping sound inside. The light on the security panel turns green, and… the door...begins to open of its own accord?
Steve huffs a laugh, awed. Cerrera or Stark, Non-magical or anti-magical… it doesn’t matter. He loves Tony so much.
Steve slows for a few paces, caught off guard. They’re actually heading out? He’s not going to be stuck behind a desk for yet another day?
Tony sighs. “I... I saw a little girl there tonight with her parent, and I just… I don’t know.” He shrugs, his shoulder bumping Steve’s knee. “I don’t know.”
Everyone in the restaurant is looking at them now, some people are even pulling out their phones—Steve vaguely remembers an image capturing feature being part of the device.
good at covering how terrified he is. Steve is laying odds it’s the latter; he stands by his assessment of what house Tony belongs in.
"You think I'm not serious about this?" Tony points toward his computer console, matching Steve's volume. "About my team?"
Steve takes Tony’s gorgeous face in his hands, and leans in to press his forehead to Tony’s. “I’m just happy I don’t have to avenge
The glass theme continues in the lobby; the only structures in the building that are not transparent are fixtures of glistening chrome, reflecting the late morning light.
"I... oh, Roger, I thought you were just being funny," he says, composing himself for a moment. "I was going to give you all the points for this maneuver, especially on a first date, but it’s even better if you—no!"
Steve glances down and away, dodging Tony’s kisses. “I... can talk to my boss at FAB," he tells Tony, hearing his own voice go a bit thin with indecision. "Maybe we—the Bureau—could work with your team. Might not be impossible to convince Stoner, since none of you are, strictly speaking, full-nomajs."
Grabbing the one breadstick out of the basket, he dumps the rest into his briefcase, on top of a computer and what looks like some pieces of metal—an unfinished robot, perhaps.
Apparently, though, some traces remained in this one soldier's vivid imagination, and made it out onto the page.
"You are..." Steve laughs, shaking his head, still in disbelief at what he's just seen. "You're not like anyone I've ever met, you know that?"
“I’m sorry,” Steve leans back against the workbench, his hands sliding over his face momentarily before he lets them fall to his sides. This is a mess. He sighs. “I can’t guarantee anything, but I’ll talk to Stoner Monday—”
Steve raises the orb in his hand and brings his fist, and the enchantment, down squarely on Doom’s face. Doom topples backward, crying out.
Steve finds himself hesitating. He had dreamed of working with Tony when he thought Tony was a wizard. Even just moments ago, Steve had been imagining trying to convince Stoner to hire Tony directly as a W.A.N.D.D. employee, possibly even offering Tony a job by their next date.
Tony closes the door as he holds up his jet boots and gloves. They look like they’ve been polished, but more importantly, they have a new paint job: red and gold, just like in Tony’s schematic.
He uncovers his eyes to see that Tony's are... well, about the size of the massive appetizer platters he sees at the other tables.
don’t want to be there next time, how’s that?” Rhodey snarks playfully, pushing himself back to arm’s length. “Not unless I get a full set of armor, too.”
The whole ordeal must have hurt Tony so much... To find out that you would never, ever be the thing you'd planned on becoming for the entirety of your young life. Steve could only imagine how he would have felt if Solstice simply hadn't worked. If he hadn't become a battlecaster, would he have just gone home and started a Victory mandrake garden? It would have been humiliating.
Over a dozen people are still blocking his view as the whales continue their lazy lap around, not quite having swum to where they are standing yet, and Tony is already mesmerized.
He pulls out his Two-Way Mirror, and tries to summon Sam, but there’s no answer; it’s dark and still in the reflected image of Sam’s apartment. Maybe Sam is sleeping. Steve probably should have checked before he had to stand behind that obnoxious Holyhead Harpies fan for twenty minutes. He sighs.
"Sorry, Tony— I didn't mean to—" Steve stands up from his stool, clutching the empty mug awkwardly. He should have just kept his discovery to himself.
Steve resists the urge to sush him—Steve already cast a dome of silence over them, but old habits die hard—and he can’t deny that Rhodey has a point.
They both collapse on the bed, exhausted. Mere moments pass before strong arms yank Tony in, and he finds his face pressed into a sweat-sheened pec muscle that guards a rapidly beating heart.
badly to touch himself. And Steve hasn't specifically said not to, not tonight. But Tony knows the sort of mood Steve's in, that they're both in. He knows the game they're playing. Neither of them has to say it out loud.
"Doctor Maria Cererra," Tony confirms. "She was brilliant and kind. Her work was focused on, as Jarvis would say, ‘wee beasties’," he mimics a Scottish accent once again, raising his hands to his neck to scoop up U; she coils up happily in his palms. "But she loved other animals, too. Kinda ran in the family."
The sun is setting, the entire city reflecting hues of pink and orange; it wouldn’t look more beautiful if it was enchanted.
The latest explosion site revealed a detail that none of the others did: runes carved into the floor near the epicenter of the blast.The report notes seem to indicate that they were placed there by the bomber as part of a ritual.
Tony smiles, and without warning, pushes into Steve’s personal space, his hand sliding under the lapel of Steve’s jacket. For a moment, Steve thinks Tony is about to kiss him—or something even
“Whoa, Redwing, whoa!” He shrinks back from the doorframe, covering his face with his hands, trying to calm the bird. “It’s just me.”
Steve soars a thousand feet above Central Park, just darting up into the clouds enough to maintain some cover from the nomajs below, but low enough to keep an eye on Tony's flight pattern.
"I couldn't make things... happen, like I was supposed to. I tried saying the magic words, and thinking about it really hard, and believing in it with all my might… Nothing ever worked. But then, one day, my mom got a care package from one of her old nomaj colleagues from her school days. It was a beginner's electronics kit—they had no idea about Howard being a wizard, or that I was supposed to be one, too. And that day it was like... it was like I found magic.
“Welcome to undercover, Stevie,” Sam smiles smugly, conjuring a pair of sunglasses to appear on his face. “Welcome to W.A.N.D.D.”
When he finally extracts his hand, what he pulls out is an orb, about four inches in diameter, its surface glistening in a sort of craquelure pattern, bringing to mind broken glass.
As Steve holds court on "fluke markings" and "spyhopping" and a bunch of other terminology he doesn't really follow, Tony lets himself drop away mentally from the conversation and just takes Steve in.
"No!" Rhodes says lightly, "No, you didn't, at all. I'm just covering my bases. I like you, Roger. I'm all for this, in fact. I
He walks Steve through his data: his calculations on the force of the blast, his readings on the traces it left behind, and the subtle differences between each incident.
A snap of his black, angular wand, and his signature armor materializes on his person. A green cape appears in mid-air and floats down to curl about his shoulders.
Steve didn’t trust Tony’s instincts about other people, didn’t think he had a claim to his own place in the wizarding community. Did that make him just as bad those wizards who ridiculed his mom? Or the ones who made Tony feel ashamed for not being able to do magic?
"HEY!" Tony steps in front of the creature, waving his arms wildly in the universal gesture for 'stop it'—seemingly meant for both Steve and the creature.
Doom makes a motion to cast again, and just beyond his shoulder, Steve spies the orb on its pedestal, nearly forgotten in the fight.
“That’s… it? That was your elaborate cover? Really?” Tony chuckles. “Your parents were big Captain America fans, huh? Didn’t know wizards knew about him. Was one of them a muggle—er, sorry, nomaj?”
Much as Steve had reached for his own tool of choice, Tony retrieves his phone and captures a photo of the runes, which shows up immediately on screen. Steve describes the jist of the code he and the other soldiers used during the war. Thirty seconds later, Tony has a script running, attempting to auto-decipher the message.
Tony presses a pattern into the side with the red and gold design, and the card expands, doubling in thickness, parts shifting into place, panels sliding open to reveal spinning rotors. The card—or robot, Steve supposes—lifts off Tony's hand and into the air, hovering around in a circular pattern like the baskets.
wide, like he's been hit with some kind of laughter charm and is trying to fight it with all this might. And failing.
Before Steve can even begin to explain the situation, Rhodes breaks in. “Is this some stupid wizard thing?”
Struggling to comprehend what Tony’s just told him, his focus darts from figure to figure in the projection.
He's so tired of lying to Tony, whose attention is completely fixed on him, imploring an honest answer.
They’re starting a conversation about who some of the brightest and best are in this year’s graduating class at the Academy—Tony notes he met a particularly sharp young woman named Kamala who was eager to change the reputation of the name “Khan” during their last visit to campus. Bruno Carrelli, the guy she introduced as definitely-not-her-boyfriend, didn’t seem like a slouch in the science department either. Tony could easily see them as part of a new crop of ensigns. “Though Carelli would be Pym’s, probably, not mine,” Tony babbles on, popping another grape into his mouth.
. Tony feels like an idiot all over again. He hadn’t even thought, for some reason, about the ramifications of an Augment potentially passing on his DNA. And as much as they trusted Fury and the crew of the Avenger, anyone who knew Steve’s real identity and genetic status put him in danger. It was the kind of thing Steve could waive away easily enough when it was only himself at risk, but if he was discovered, who knows what the Federation might do? If he was, say, banished to another quadrant, and a child was involved—
Steve is still just wearing the suit he usually wears to RI. He can’t help but feel he’s wearing a costume, but he has no idea what else might look good when not paired with wizarding robes. He wishes he could be himself, explain to Tony who he really is… but who he really is has already caused him enough trouble for one evening.
He crouches down next to Kyle’s seat, then, so he can speak to the boy directly, setting his bag on the floor.
He hadn't seen Italy under the best of conditions during the war. It was December, 1943, and they'd been tasked with taking back San Pietro Infine. The fighting went on for ten days in the cold; everyone was wading in muck up to their calves; the rolling hills were still flooded from the heavy November rains, and not even all the magic in the 5th army was enough to keep their boots dry.
"I thought this offer might be too sweet to resist,” Doom’s lips curl into a smug smile. “You see, since returning to the living world, I’ve spent my time absorbing every ounce of magical potency I could, by every means available to me. But it still wasn’t enough. I needed a new source. I searched and searched, until..." he gestures toward Sam. "I realized there was power all around me, trapped in the bodies of those who did not deserve it. Extracting a wizard's magical essence is a delicate operation. It hasn't always gone to plan. But even my failed experiments have proved... interesting."
right. He's the same age Bucky was, too—he has a long nomaj rifle instead of a sniper wand, but it's unmistakably him.
Tony smiles ruefully and wiggles his left hand—oh, the briefcase. Tony hadn’t put it down since they left the restaurant. Steve had nearly forgotten.
"That's a little welcome from our friends picked up by the remote mic," she tells them both, nearly glowing in anticipation. "Captain Rogers, it's been wonderful talking to you, but I—"
Tony’s hair’s a little more dishevelled than normal, and there’s a grease stain on his cheek—Steve’s fingers twitch as he thinks about reaching out to gently wipe it away.
“Hey!” Steve swivels around in the bed, placing himself in front of Tony bodily, prying Tony’s hands away. “Hey, Tony, look at me.”
The grey blobs below the surface are getting bigger every second; the drone filming them a half a mile out must be zooming in for a better view. That, or they're surfacing. Dark shapes obscured by seawater dominate the screens in the viewing room.
Resolved, she nods, and Tony grins. He pulls his briefcase up again, and extracts what appear to be several more of his calling cards, giving those to her as well.
Steve wraps his arms around Tony. Their height difference is just enough that Steve's lips align perfectly with the place Tony's earlobe meets his jaw.
Fortunately, Captain Spock had already formed something of a bond with the animals, and began to liaise with them. He wasn't entirely able to make the concept of genetic diversity clear to them, but they agreed more whales was a good thing, and they were open to the idea of continued medical care.
“It’s late—or early—and I’m tired. I need some time to…” Tony sighs, eyes flicking upward as he searches for the words. The fight suddenly goes out of his frame, fatigue pulling him down into a slumped posture. “I just need some time.”
The figure dashes down alleyways, twisting and turning, and at one point, leaping a fence—the bottom of the cloak flips up momentarily, and Steve thinks he sees silvery metal boots on the wizard's feet... Armor of some kind?
The feel of the orb in his fist is familiar, bracing; it hums with power. A glow bursts forth from the fractured and refused artifact. It’s not quite Steve’s shield, with its balanced shape and elegant curves. It’s no more than a mass of pure spell energy, but it’s enough.
“I don’t know everything right now either,” he tells Tony, not letting him look away. “But I do know I loved tonight. Every second, every word.  I wouldn’t change a thing, okay? And I know I’d like to do the whale part again next year, if we can. And the other parts—” there’s a lewd glimmer to  Steve’s stare, even as his ears are starting to go red, “—I know I’d like to do that again much sooner.”
"Of course," says Steve, nodding, both relieving her from continuing the conversation and reflecting her delight right back to her. "It was a pleasure meeting you."
"Unarmed, okay? Not a flight risk. Literally. And I’m answering your questions, though I hope the rest of them aren't as ridiculous."
He takes a few steps towards the desk and peers over the plastic wall, but there’s nothing to be seen. Huh.
Reluctantly, Steve pulls away, just as Tony is about to deepen the kiss. Tony’s eyes flutter open as he comes back to himself.
“It’s going well,” Steve tells him. He picks up his sandwich, then puts it down again. "Your staff have all been amazing.
. He can’t let the fight drift this way, into the path of the people he cares about. He has to get back up, distract Doom, keep them safe.
“Rogers,” Stoner acknowledges him, not looking up from from a stack of photographs of the blast site—eerily still for wizard photos.
Almost all young witches and wizards have magical pets growing up, but most grow out of the habit of taking the creatures everywhere they go when they finish school. They really aren't the same thing as what a nomaj would call a 'familiar'—an animal that helps with spells, or somehow does your bidding.
He had heard about the Mirror of Erised growing up, the magical glass that showed you your heart’s fondest desire—what kid hadn’t?—and always wished he could see it.
"Just once, okay?" she warns Tony, sharply, but with a teasing edge to her voice. "And only because—" she nods at Steve— "he's cute."
Finally, Steve spots them: DUM-E and U, curled up together. Steve kneels before them, cradling the phone against his ear and extending a hand to U. She sniffs at him, wary.
,” he orders. He hopes to Merlin Sam is well enough to apparate them all out of here. He has to be. They
But an entire generation of nomajs on the front line who knew about spells and magic was simply too much for MACUSA to bear. They all had to be made to forget.
Steve regains the smallest amount of focus, taking another step back from the creature, and fires off a spell from his wand.
Doom lets loose another spell from his wand; the broken glass fragments shimmer, turning to bits of metal, each one sharp as a knife’s edge. Flicking upward, he sends them hurtling through the air toward the occamy, swarming her, biting into her sensitive scales.
Tony opens his eyes on an upstroke, and through the prism of his own tears, a shoal of tiny silver fish gliding by the window look like stars as seen from the bridge of a ship coming out of warp.
. Later. Right now, you just need to get through a couple of meals. So, ask him out today, the two of you go get a bite, hit it off, and then when you finish this assignment, you can go on the magical date of your dreams.”
Tony had learned all about it in some of the articles Steve had sent to his PADD during the weeks of recuperation after his heart replacement. It had been part of a steady literary diet of wholesome reading material Steve prepared for him: nothing that could get his heart rate up. That bit—Tony flushes as a racy memory stirs—came later.
. Ever since I came back on the force, I've been... closed off. Shut down. About as emotional as..."
He pauses, and for some reason, Steve thinks he’s pulling a face on the other end of the call. “Does this have something to do with Tony?” he asks, voice dropping half an octave.
Steve manages to sit up and debrief the other aurors on the situation, and warns them about Doom’s abilities as he’s taken into custody.
Steve’s caution proves to be well-founded; the room begins to shake again. Sure enough, it sounds like the opposite wall is shifting this time. Steve uses the covering noise of the room reshaping to shut his own door behind him.
"You, too, Roger—don't hurt her, okay?" Tony pleads with Steve. "She was just protecting me. I know you have questions—that's why I came back here, to talk to you. But don't hurt her, please. None of this is her fault."
His father, Howard, used to own his own business, and his mother, Maria, was a microbiologist. It seems Tony and his father didn’t agree on a lot, but they both adored Maria; Tony waxes lovingly about both her beauty and her genius, and it’s obvious he misses her a lot.
—and seconds later, he found himself at the Top of the Rock, looking out across the city, as the sunrise painted each skyscraper in glowing citrus hues, the last of the night dissolving into mild purple grays, the stars winking out of view for the day.
charm. It zigzags skyward, the frame twisting at odd angles that, rationally, at seem like they shouldn’t fit together correctly, but somehow they meet with astonishing grace; its architecture is both geometric and organic at the same time.
people to handle this? Someone with special powers? Who might have, I don’t know, already had their coffee and isn’t still in their pajamas?” he grumbles.
Tony begins his descent to a large landing area built off the eastern side of the building, a beautiful curved balcony, twenty by thirty feet. It leads directly into the main robotics lab on the 118th floor. Tony had showed off some of RI’s larger military drones there last week. Steve had thought they were wonderful: broomless flight! How innovative!
"There was a spell," Steve explains softly. "Just a hardening charm, something like a first year might learn, but amplified to cover a greater area—and I got turned into stone. I was on a secret mission. No one knew where I was. I was trapped for over seventy years—"
Finally, just before that “stupid ratty chapeau” (Tony’s words) could give away Tony’s secret, Tony announced that he was bored with school and made a rather grand and dramatic exit by attaching tiny rockets to roller skates he wore, concealed under his robes, and shot out of the Great Hall at lightning speed, much to the astonishment all staff and students present.
"I..." Steve leans forward, elbows on the table, scraping his fingers through his hair. "I grew up in a wizarding family, Bobbi!" he gestures emphatically. "We were druidic Irish. Very observant. Mom's practice got her through some bad times with my Dad. Magic was her life, so it was mine, too. And then I was a battlecaster in the war. I don't... I don't know who I am without magic, and I don't know anything about technology. I'd be too terrified to lie, and I can't tell him the truth yet. I'll probably just... end up saying nothing at all. We'll be five minutes into the meal, and he'll realize what a huge mistake he’s made."
“Steve,” he slurs, lids growing heavy. “Do you think Dr. Nu’val is interested in transwarp engines?”
The thing behind the desk gives a squeak of its own and pulls back as well, mirroring Steve’s behavior in its own way.
Except… upon closer inspection, it seems the garage door affixes directly to the brick at the top, where it should curve inward; it doesn’t look like it has a mechanism to open, like it even
Steve is holding fast to him, but gently, as if letting Tony know he's wanted but not trapped. "Tony—"
From anyone else, Steve would suspect that this was a load of garbage; sweet lies to try and set him at ease and get the night back on track.
Tony swings his legs and uses the momentum to pop back down off the workbench. God, he’s excited today. Steve can’t really blame him. Being told you’re not special for years on end, only to find out you might be the only one of your kind on the planet? It’s got to be exciting. And maybe a little terrifying.
Sam coughs beside him, and Stoner raises an eyebrow. Steve looks back and forth between them, confused.
Steve knows he’s been a shadow of who he once was, pulling away from everyone who has tried to care for him since he woke up. Everyone except Tony, who managed to break through Steve’s defenses. He’s so, so grateful, and he fervently wants to give Tony something in return.
He laughs, suddenly, shocked by the sound of what he just said, and Steve tries to laugh along with him—but it turns into a grimace as the gashes in his abdomen complain at being jostled.
“There you go. NFC,” Tony says simply, sing-songing, as if that should mean something to Steve. “Easy as 1-2-3.”
"Oh, uh, right the… Captain America thing,” Tony dives back into his story awkwardly, apparently desperate to change the topic.
Steve has never met a roboticist before, but suddenly he can’t help but feel that this is exactly what one should look like, that this man is the platonic ideal of someone inventing the future.
A little girl in a shiny purple-blue dress, blonde hair streaming behind her, gallops over to her guardian, taffeta and tresses swaying as she comes to an abrupt stop. She looks to be about eight, if Tony had to guess. In her arms, she holds a stuffed whale. Her parent, who looks like they might be part Andorian, scoops her up into their arms, giving her a better view at the water outside. They whisper something in the girl's ear—Tony doesn't have Steve's hearing, but from body language it's almost certainly a question, something like, "Are you excited?"—and she nods emphatically in return.
As soon as Tony stands up, reluctantly taking a step away from Steve to let the professionals work, Rhodey rushes in, wrapping Tony up in a protective hug. He practically lifts Tony off the ground. Steve smiles at them, the haze of the pain beginning to recede.
“We have to go,” Brand drops a folder on their table in front of Bobbi, labelled STARBURST. “There’s been another one.” She sighs. “They think someone might have been caught up in thethis blast this time.”
Steve's freehand returns to Tony's hip, pulling him backward, filling him from behind, drawing him out of the sleeve. "Good," he praises Tony, his voice deep as the sea they’re surrounded by. “Again.”
Kelp twists and dances mesmerizingly outside the window, and Tony lies there, wondering how they’re going to top tonight twelve months from now.
pretty proud of it, anyway. C’mon,” he smiles even wider and tips his head toward the bank of elevators at the end of the hall. “We’re gonna have
Satisfied as he can be with his guess work, he runs toward an elevator car nearly full of nomaj passengers.
. He lets the title roll through his thoughts. It’s a lot to live up to, but he thinks he can do it. For Tony, he can.
Gracie is right there, just on the other side of the aluminum panel. Her dark eye is fixed on them, something calming in her gaze. She looks like a keeper of ancient secrets humans could never possibly comprehend. She's beautiful.
That’s why Steve’s here, pretending to be someone else: Rhodes Industries is a rising star in the nomaj military technology sector. Their equipment is so advanced, the briefing said, it seems to border on the magical already; it seems likely they could produce wand scanners and other magi-technological devices for the Auror’s Bureau and other divisions.
As if he knows what Steve's thinking, the man presses a catch on the side of the helmet, and its faceplate pops open, confirming Steve's worst fears.
“Both,” Tony cuts in, nodding. “I’m game for both.” He favors Steve with one more lopsided, charming smile. “See you Monday?”
Having secured the very last sesame seed bagel, he’s on his way out when he runs into two fellow agents. Familiar faces—familiar as anyone is these days, anyway.
curse on them. She hands Steve the new copies. “Save that for the soon-to-be-boyfriend,” she quips, making Scott laugh and Steve’s face heat up in embarrassment.
Steve… has no idea what any of that means, but Tony is smiling more than ever, so Steve smiles right back.
The broom handles like a dream and Steve just knows he’s going to beat Tony to their destination. Tony’s had a hard week. Maybe Steve should go easy on him—
Rick Stoner, head of the Federal Auror’s Bureau, flicks his wrist, and from his wand springs forth a 3D representation of the crime scene in the front of meeting room. Several gasps are heard from the crowd of assembled aurors at the all-staff.
"Stop it, all right?" Tony puts a hand to his forehead, seemingly pained, and holds his other hand up and out, as if to shield himself from Steve's words. "Just stop it—"
“He’s… he’s my assignment. I mean, part of it. He works at Rhodes Industries, the place Sam and I are reviewing for W.A.N.D.D. status."
Turning to regard it head on, Steve sees it’s a streetlamp flickering on the opposite street corner, in front of a two-story red brick building. It has no signage, and nothing can be seen in the row of darkened windows on the second floor to indicate what might be inside. Facing the street at ground level is a single closed garage door. At a glance, it doesn’t look particularly odd, save for looking newer than the surrounding apartment buildings and corner stores.
It’s almost entirely dark inside—giving Steve awful flashbacks of the cave system containing the hydra he fought—but if his other senses are to be trusted, it sounds like he’s in a plain concrete room. Just on the other side of it, Steve surmises, is the old City Hall station; Steve had seen it as a child, its graceful swooping curves and leaded skylights burned into his memory. Doom must be creating his own gateway from that side of the passage.
“So quit,” Tony pleads, reaching for Steve like he’s at risk of slipping away. “Work with me. Do you know how much good we could do? Haven’t you ever thought about that before?” He counts off the possibilities on his fingers. “Wizards can conjure food in an instant, apparate across the city in the blink of an eye, regrow bones and heal wounds! Did you ever stop to think how many people we could help? We—the whole wizarding community—we can do better than this!”
Rhodey taps on his chest, producing a knocking sound. “Top of the line RI Carbon Fiber and Vibranium body armor. I don’t know how it’ll do against spells, but it’s the best I’ve got. Are
He huffs a laugh. "For instance. But he's..." Steve wants to kick himself for hesitating. "He's a nomaj."
“That’s okay. I understand that,” he says, as if Tony’s rambling monologue had been at all coherent. “And for the record, I don’t know about having kids either, right now.” His gaze drifts down, and he’s starting to look as lost as Tony just was. “I… I don’t think… biologically…” His mouth forms a line. “I have some concerns. And even adopting, or engaging a surrogate, I—” Steve forces a half smile. “I don’t know either, is the long and the short of it.”
“But it’s kind of flattering. You thought I was doing real magic, y’know? And if it’s not clear, I still think you're incredible, Roger—or… whatever your name is. Hey,” Tony squints, smiling. “If it's not destroying some MACUSA code word level intelligence, could you tell me what you're actually called?"
He’s tall, with close-cropped hair, sharp brown eyes and a warm smile. His suit coat is unbuttoned, a hint of a seemingly laid back personality making itself known. Leaning against the front of his desk, he looks absolutely at home in his magnificent, airy office, its floor to ceiling windows continuing the transparency motif Steve noticed in the lobby, giving them all a beautiful view thousands of feet above the teeming metropolis below.
were a National Basketball League team from 1942 to 1943. They were funded by the United Auto Workers and replaced George Halas' Chicago Bruins, who folded in 1942. The team was an early experiment in integration, featuring at least eight African American players, most former Harlem Globetrotters.” A flying car seemed too good a logo not to use for a quidditch team, and given young Steve’s interest in a Chicago wizarding school, they seemed a likely team for him to support.
“You alright?” he asks. They approach one of the two main elevators in the center of the MACUSA ground floor, where intricately designed metal supports soar hundreds of feet upward, eventually disappearing into an illusion of the night sky.
Steve follows him to the ground, never letting up on his beating, pummeling him with punishing blows, again and again. He winds up for another—
A three-dimensional model of several figures in bright costumes, each suspended in a dynamic pose. There’s a young woman in red who’s clearly casting a spell, hands enveloped with a magical energy tinged in the same color as her outfit. A young man in green with a shock of white hair leaps beside her… Steve stares at each miniature frame in turn; the only one that’s familiar is Tony, soaring above the others in his signature red and gold armor.
The door swings open with a slam, but before Steve can cast anything, he’s hit with a blast—it's like no spell he's ever experienced,  a bolt of pure energy striking him square in the chest. He's knocked back into the opposite wall, stunned.
Steve is friendly with everyone, but he hasn’t made a lot of friends since he... came back. Sam is probably his best one.
Sam scrambles to his feet, moving to the center of the tube, trying to stay away from the magical energy now cascading over the glass panels. "Hey," he shouts desperately. "HEY!!"
They sprint toward the door and across the balcony, Steve throwing leg over his Comet while Tony leaps into the air.
Tony is standing, his shackles at his feet, looking horrified. He attempts to close the distance to Steve, his lips forming Steve's name. Rhodey blocks him bodily, trying to guide him to the door.
But here Tony was, laughing so hard tears were streaming down his face, like he was glad to have someone to tell the story to after all these years. Steve was more than happy to be that person—he’d like to continue to be that person for Tony, for as long as Tony would let him.
For minutes, they say nothing, waiting and watching in peaceful silence, the occasional fish or loose twist of seaweed floating past the window.
"Don't look at me," Scott protests, holding his palms up defensively. "I haven't eaten in forty-five years."
But the subject of the whales kept surfacing again and again. Steve always seemed to mention them casually: how often they were spotted, how they were doing, where they were when the calf was born.
Tony laughs. “Uh, no. I mean, yes, I made them. But this is just my cubicle, where I take breaks. And these,” he gestures to the bots, “are just my hobbies.”
open, the way a nomaj one would. Steve might not have noticed if he hadn’t been spending so much time around mechanical engineers, but now the strangeness of it is obvious to him.
“I brought backup,” Sam explains, panting. He stops, shocked, when it’s clear he realizes the figure crouching next to Steve is Tony, still very much alive. “Oh my god. You’re—”
"My dad didn't yell,” Tony recalls, calming. “At the time, I kind of wish he had. He didn't speak to me for about a week. I think it was less the squib thing than it was how much I embarrassed the family by showing off. I was really worried about what my mom would say, though."
Either Sam’s not at home—he wasn’t even in good enough shape to walk, let alone fly or apparate, the last time Steve saw him—or he’s in a state where he can’t come to the door.
.” Blood is rushing to his cheeks, his face is heating up. “I said it the day I met you, and it never stopped being true. Even when I thought you—”
Slowly, enjoying every ragged inhale and exhale, every thump of their syncopated racing hearts, they quiet themselves, laughter fading into contented smiles.
"I'm... mostly over it, I think," Tony reassures Steve. "I mean, my family was well off, and I’ve done okay for myself. Only one real regret, to be honest. I didn't get to do the one thing I wanted to more than anything."
.” He leans out past the door and waggles his eyebrows at Steve. “Not that I wouldn’t love to later, but—” he looks back into the doorway, “—ah,
Steve's been on the W.A.N.D.D. assignment for three weeks now, seeing Tony nearly every day, and they've settled into a comfortable routine. Tony's bots make him tea, Tony waxes philosophical about technology, Steve resolves to ask Tony out… and then the work day ends, and Steve goes home alone.
He hops off his stool and paces away. Steve assumes he's going to get more coffee, but Tony stops at the far end of the workbench from where U is resting, and grabs a keyboard. It's not connected to anything that Steve can see. He's no expert, but doesn't there have to be a screen of some kind—?
Both Steve and Steve are on “special” assignments right now—“special” being a euphemism for all paperwork, nothing in the field. Sam’s off active duty until he heals, and the same goes for Steve until he… well, until he gets used to this century, he supposes. He’s not sure how his superiors are going to determine that exactly.
Rhodes Industries is housed in a massive, modern nomaj skyscraper, entirely made of glass, as though someone had hit it with a
Bobbi turns back to Steve, closing the investigation folder and gathering up her things. “I have to go, Steve. Good luck with your date, okay?”
Steve raises an eyebrow, and Tony knows that must sound like an odd introduction. He's got nothing against Vulcans. "I'm sure they do an amazing job conveying facts and medical information. But I suspect there's something lost in the translation. I mean..." He points again to the sea, indicating the whales that are soon to arrive. "What do you think they're feeling?"
Steve tries to keep his face neutral at that, as much as he wants to sneer. Wand scanners could be placed on the end of any standard issue wand and capture the scene before them. It was useful enough, true, Steve could admit that. But it gave way to this exact situation more often than not: aurors prematurely (in Steve’s opinion) destroying the state of a crime scene. Sure, hiding from nomajs was important, but a representation of evidence was never as good as the real thing.
” Doom curses Steve again, red sparks flying. The pain is agonizing, but Steve bears it—at least Doom is still focused on him and him alone.
The neck—or is it an arm?—bends down out of sight for a moment, and then pops back up holding a coffee mug in its claw. As it wheels around the desk toward them, what Steve had previously thought was a shelving unit comes to life as well, rolling out from under the desk. A shelf with a tea kettle on it slides forward, and the kettle begins to whistle.
Steve puts a hand back, wrangling Rhodey by the shirtfront, yanking him back down and hushing him in earnest this time. The silence charm won’t work if Rhodey leaves the relative safety of the cloak. “Not.
Steve pinches and zooms in on the picture. It’s drawing of a man in a red white and blue outfit. Steve has seen some over-the-top robes in his day, but this takes the cake. It’s so tight around the character’s rear end—how did nomajs not get embarrassed wearing things like that?
Tony lifts his chin up. “Whoever needs to be saved,” he says, his voice even, expression every bit as grave as Steve. “Muggles, wizards, house elves—anyone. Everyone.”
"The school was abandoned by nomajs in '78, but it was the home of summer wizarding camps and community programs. We think it was empty at the time of the explosion—no one was found dead or injured... but our Forensic Conjurers have advised us that the detonation may have been so severe that someone in the immediate spell radius could have been completely disintegrated."
They shuffle as quickly as possible through what is now the nomaj bicycle storage room in the basement of the Woolworth Building, about eighty feet and one very powerful warding charm below MACUSA’s headquarters. Part of Doom’s diabolical plan, no doubt—if the rest of the Bureau finds out about this, they’ll be walking into a trap. Taking out both a seat of magical government and a portion of its service arm in one fell swoop would certainly make Doom’s goal of Wizarding World domination easier, not to mention that hundreds of nomajs would be caught in the crossfire.
to get ahead of his target somehow. It's a gamble, but if he can guess where they're going, maybe he can use a shortcut.
As Tony touches down, though, Steve is puzzled. It's not much of a getaway if Tony returns to a place Steve knows about, let alone to one Steve goes to nearly every day and still has security clearance for.
Steve looks like he wants to return the compliment in flirty fashion, and, hell, they're going to get worked up all over again, aren't they? But before he can get a word out, gasps and murmurs rise from the opposite side of the room.
There’s a ragged cough, and Tony answers Steve’s desperate wish. “I’m here.” Tony exhales slowly. “I really
The boy—Kyle, Steve assumes—shakes his head furiously, almost nonsensically, as if it’s a habit, a learned response dissociated from his dad’s words. His is gaze still trained down towards his hands, now fidgeting nervously in his lap. He’s clearly heard this all before and doesn’t want to risk disagreeing with his father again.
“I don't know,” Tony says again, blowing out a long breath. It’s the truth, but Tony really hates things he doesn’t know, especially big important life things, things it seems like other people know so intrinsically.
starship—for the first time in the last stages of her build out had been both thrilling and satisfying: seeing the sleek outlines of the body from a distance on approach, then taking in the millions of minute details when boarding her. The shiver he had gotten realizing he was a part of something special, something bigger than himself. He knows that feeling intimately.
"No, that's just it," Steve explains slowly, the thoughts untangling themselves as he says them out loud for the first time. "He makes me
magic. I added a little electricity to wires and a servo, and I could make things come to life. I'd attach a rotor and a motor to an object, and I could make it
Steve talks about travel and combat, trying to sub in places he knows W.A.N.D.D. (and hopefully, the nomaj military) is stationed now for locations he fought on the European front, and when Tony asks him if the time in France and Germany Steve mentioned was part of a college program, Steve hastily agrees and lets Tony’s able mind fill in the gaps.
Then, Steve feels… something else. White noise fills his ears, and there’s a slight buzzing sensation against his lips. His chest suddenly feels heavy where Tony’s hand is resting. His whole body feels heavier, and the air of warmth and brightness he didn’t even know he normally felt inside suddenly becomes heavy. It’s not a bad experience, it’s just… different. He’s not exactly sure how it’s possible he can know this, but it feels true, somehow: he feels like a nomaj.
“Doom,” Tony calls out to the dark wizard, letting his voice waver slightly. He sounds less arrogant—curious, even. “How… how would it work? You giving me powers?”
“Okay,” Tony exhales weightily, as if he’s just decided something important. “All right. What the hell, here goes: I said I wasn’t working for anyone—and that’s true—but I am working
When he tries to break away to grab a bite, he is waylaid by none other than James Rhodes himself, who insists that Steve joins him for lunch.
Steve takes in the sight of Tony, illuminated by the golden glow of his creation. He’s somewhat more solemn than before, his secrets laid bare, but he’s still radiating that infectious, profound hopefulness that Steve has come to love about him.
"Oh, I'll tell you, Commander." Steve's whisper is rough, demanding. The sound sends shockwaves down Tony's spine. His underwear seems to have shrunk about two sizes. "You'll be very clear on what I want done."
“Speaking of animal companions,” Steve glances at Sam’s conspicuously empty shoulder, “where’s Redwing?”
) is the Cap writer responsible for giving us Nomad (thanks, Steve XD). I was going to call the bakery “Gruenwald’s” but I was afraid it would be confusing this universe; it sounds too much like Grindelwald. These ideas are both, of course, nods to the inclusion of “Brubaker’s Bakery” in Avengers Assemble. (
