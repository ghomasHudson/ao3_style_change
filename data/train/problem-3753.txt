“I told you. Favorite book is more of a tier than a singular thing,” said Charlie. She smiled before opening up the book. “Let’s see how far I can get into this before Jo figures out where I am.”
“Not that simple. He’s going to try to prove that he’s got a new way of doing things. Why manipulate people into being good little citizens when you can murder them into doing it? Less mouths to feed that way,” Dean pointed out, raising an eyebrow. “That’s a lot of good people dead if we aren’t here to defend them. I get that you care about the difference between who’s involved in the fight and who’s a civilian, but I promise you he doesn’t.”
“But you shot me in the leg,” Castiel went on. “I think you did that because you didn’t really have the stomach to kill me. Because we’re friends, and even if I had betrayed you, that meant something.”
“It has?” he asked out loud, trying to recall how much time had passed and what Gabriel had been saying just before. But his memory was failing him aside from the barest of impressions that what Gabriel was saying was not right.
“I need to pretend to be happy, don’t I?” asked Castiel, noticing some of the men and women serving under Crowley watching their sport. “Oh joy.”
“You gotta trust me when I say Cas, it’s better if you don’t know yet,” said Dean. “No offense, but you’re the shittiest actor that’s ever existed.”
“Yes,” said Benny bluntly. “Don’t do that this time. You made a mistake. Own up to it and deal with the consequences for once. Drowning yourself in guilt doesn’t help anybody. It just obligates the rest of us to feel sorry for you.”
God doesn’t need to be good. God is just God. But Jack, he needs to be good more than anything in the world. Billie knows this the same way she knows how it feels for the curve of her own scythe to slice into her skin. She’s known it since she realized what he could do. The change he could bring.
“It’s not enough. It will never be enough,” says Castiel. “I’ll only ever be a reminder of a life I took from her.”
“What if it is a thing for me?” Cas asked. Dean watched him for a long time, as though he were trying to figure something out.
“Why because you were a demon? Why would that make a difference?” asks Cas. Dean tries to start in at another angle, but apparently Cas isn’t done yet. “So it’s not the body. It’s not what I am, I know that much. So when I thought, when I hoped, that things could be different, I asked myself what would keep you from going after something you wanted? And I couldn’t find an answer. So if you think you feel something now, I can only conclude it’s because you are forcing yourself to. Because you try to mold yourself into whatever role keeps the people you love close, no matter how ill it fits. But you were already enough. I’m not asking for anything from you. That’s why I didn’t come back. Because everything would have changed, one way or another, and… I couldn’t bear the thought.”
“Finally talked Mom out of the whole treason thing,” said Dean, as though his words didn’t carry serious weight. “And that your friends can stay.”
There’s a pause as Dean clears his throat. He can feel Cas staring at him while he’s staring out the window, eyes peeled for any sign of movement. The sooner they find him, the sooner they can get out of here and out of this conversation. For now at least. Dean has feeling over the next however many years they’re alive, Cas is going to want to have it again. And Dean thinks he can do that, and it does help talking to Cas about this kind of stuff. Still, it’s rough, and he’s not always so good about it.
“Half-truth. I moonlight as a travelling disk-jockey, but I’m actually an independent soft-ware developer. Cyber-security for charities and nonprofits, mostly.” She sips from her beer and shrugs. “Everyone’s gotta have a hobby, right? Get it, because the DJ gig pays more than working for a non-profit?”
“This one is different,” Benny insists, carrying on with their conversation that is broken by the periodic need to collect a rider or herd a loose horse towards the collection pens behind them.
Dean checks his watch and shakes his head. “Sammy’s asleep by now, or at least he should be. I’ll check in with him tomorrow.” Benny swats at his hand when he reaches over to grab a handful of peanuts, and he swats right back. He busies himself shucking the peanuts as a line dancing song starts and grins as Castiel and Charlie queue up in the very front. Castiel moves energetically through the high-speed kicks and stomps, and when he catches Dean’s eyes across the floor his eyes are bright and his mouth lifted in a laugh that Dean can’t hear. When Charlie misses several steps and ends up facing the wrong direction. Cas catches her arm and steers her in the correct direction without missing a beat.
Castiel snaps his head to the side to ensure the bronc rider has kicked free of the stirrups before turning Anathema away from the bronc’s flailing hooves, guiding his horse with only his legs.
Among the dusty bays, duns, and blacks she stands out like a flare. The fading sun catches her red coat, setting the deep color into an unholy halo of fire. He sees now that the videos he watched to get an idea of what kind ride he could anticipate do the thick mare no justice. She’s bigger in person, that’s for sure.
Charlie announces that she’s ready to leave and flags the bartender down to close out her tab, but Dean snatches her card before the bartender can. “This one is on me. I owe you one, remember?” She opens her mouth to object, but Dean interrupts her with an
Dean grins and shoves Cole back towards number seven. “What, worried Fine and Dandy isn’t going to be so dandy for you?” The horse chooses that moment to rear and shriek his indignation about his temporary confinement.
His head is tossed with a lopsided grin, and the way the corners of his eyes crinkle with mirth is visible even from the entrance. His hips roll as the bull spins and tips with a manufactured rhythm, too perfect to be anything close to the real thing but Castiel has an idea already of the man’s authenticity. He is clad in a blue and yellow plaid shirt and is without the leather chaps from earlier. The denim of his jeans are stretch taught on his muscled thighs as he squeezes them around the barrel of the machine.
Castiel wheels his horses head around and he scans the dirt for… there it is. Where Anathema any taller, this wouldn’t work and Castiel adds another item to his mental checklist he holds for the little grey horse. He leans down, almost entirely out of the saddle and snatches the tan Stetson from the arena dirt.
He takes his place above chute number six where the mare was herded into and visually checks that his saddle, placed on the horses prior to staging, sits square on her broad back.
“Have it your way. Madame, this way if you will?” Castiel slides down from the stool and tests his legs before offering his arm to Charlie with a flourish. She leaps off her own seat with a giddy sound and tosses a smile at Dean, who holds his hands up in defeat.
came under new management about a year or so ago, and I am told the boss is a real cutthroat negotiator. Sinclair couldn’t keep up.” Benny flips open the knife and picks idly at his fingernails with the blunted end. “He asked me about you, you know.”
Rock music blares from the stadium speakers, and Dean presses a hand to his ear to hear Benny better.
with a gentleman or two in the passed. The doubt must show through on his face because Benny quickly elaborates.
Benny is too slow to avoid the icepack thrown at his retreating back, and Dean’s aim is true this time. It lands with a squelching sound just above his belt. “You’re on thin ice, my friend!”  Dean shouts without any actual malice. Benny’s throaty laugh is muffled as the tent flap closes behind him, and Dean’s smile at his own pun goes unseen.
A flash of bravado takes over Castiel. He tilts his head to press his lips to Dean’s ear and relishes the way he can hear the other man’s breath catch. “No.”
“Not that kind of friend. We’ve worked together for a little while. Paired up for some team-roping a handful of times too when his brother couldn’t make it.”
“That’s cute,” Dean scoffs. “And so, so far from the truth. Come on, rip the band aid off. I’m a man, I can take it-- painfully straight? I knew it, knew it was too good to be true.”
The mare shifts beneath him, agitated, excited. His bronc rein is clipped to her thick halter and placed into a gloved hand, and he grunts his thanks up to the men above him.
Dean dips his head in defeat. “So you said. Listen, I don’t know where you’re headed to next. I’d really,
“I think,” Castiel raises his hand and rests it under Dean’s jaw, thumb pressing into his bottom lip. He draws Dean into him until he feels the heat of him through his chest, “I think…”
Benny’s laugh shakes not only his frame, but the frame of his mule who shies sideways and pins his ears.
arena, huh?” But Dean is already striding towards the fence with a chuckle shaking his shoulders. He removes his hat at the steel fence and swings a leg between the lower rails. Castiel is aware of Benny squinting at his face as he watches the arch of Dean’s back as he bends and slips obscenely slow through to the other side.
They’d be arriving in Kansas in a day or two, according to Claire’s last text. But for now, it was time for Dean and Cas to hit the road and say goodbye to a life lived underground. Just as Springtime was bringing fresh growth to the land once again, they were ready to break through the surface and chase the sun.
“Correct. If I could hazard a guess, I imagine Sam would not have a soulmate because of his destined...use...by Lucifer.”
figuratively. He looked at Dean with reassurance as the glow began to fade, and then back at Jack and said, “Thank you.”
that he knew, that he could remember. Then again, what he sometimes caught flashes of in his mind terrified him.  He wondered if he would be better off not pushing too hard to regain his past identity.
Charlie. Just hearing her name sent a pang of guilt through Dean. He almost put back the pie, thinking he didn’t deserve any of it, but then changed his mind. Maybe he could get Cas to eat a little, too. Not that he needed it, but Dean sometimes got a kick out of hearing Cas describe the molecular taste of his favorite foods.
They’ll burn the bodies tomorrow, invite in everyone who survived. Bobby, Charlie, and the others. If they’ll even speak to them.
“Mostly it’s reapers going around trying to convince people to leave but- Well they won’t tell anyone where they’re going so, it’s usually a fifty fifty thing if they go or not. Or it was, but then there was the whole black goo thing. People started taking the reapers up on their offer a lot quicker after that,” she says. “So it turns out, there’s this whole other dimension called the Empty-”
“Yep,” Sam said cutting her off. “So, we’re talking and he says that he might be willing to give up the book for something of equal value. This guy’s a doctor, so I’m assuming he wants equipment, and we don’t really have that, so I told him. But Dr. Benton said he had all the equipment he needed, but if I had any other books that I was willing to part with, he would make the trade. I thought that sounded like a good deal, and Dr. Benton only asked that I come back some time after ten because he had business he needed to get done.”
The both of them stayed quiet for a while after that, but eventually went back to small talk between the two of them, keeping their voices low. They probably thought he was sleeping, and Castiel did try to his credit. It was no use though, since by the time they reached the resistance outpost outside Invidia, he hadn’t managed even a moment of rest.
No one was on the mountain with him. Not Anna. Not Dean. Not even the horrifying visions of Samandriel greeted him. There was only himself. His mind finally making its point absolutely clear: he could not solely depend on distractions, no matter how debilitating or life affirming they were, to rid himself of this sadness. It was not an aberration in himself, but a part of the landscape. And perhaps it would take the rest of his life and a great deal of help to carve himself into something different.
‘You are definitely the tallest person I’ve ever dated,’ Eileen agrees, smirking a little. ‘And I’m…?’
“I didn’t know what was happening. Out of nowhere, you pointed your gun at Anna, and then you almost shot yourself, Cas,” he said, like the words agonized him. “They gave the order to take Anna out, and I didn’t think. I thought- I thought I was saving you. I thought she was doing something to you, and I- I just wanted to help. It was me. I did it.”
“If someone killed me, even by accident, even if it wasn’t permanent,” says Castiel. “How would you react?”
Cas almost left it at that. It would be so much easier not to bring up what was bothering him, and let it go. Enjoy what little time with Dean he would have in his likely short life. And yet, he found himself opening his mouth.
“Six,” he said. “I tried to uh, knock Alistair off at one point. He didn’t really like that. Made an agreement with everyone who was left that if I died next he would stop picking them off one by one. I guess they figured they had a better chance against me than him. I was nineteen, and skinny. Probably didn’t look too hard to get the drop on.”
“Cas, don’t-” Dean spits out, blood running down the side of his mouth as he chokes on his own blood. Cas doesn’t acknowledge his protest, just keeps his eyes on Billie.
Encouraged, Jack closes his eyes, and Dean can see every moment of strain as he tries to stop himself from imploding. So he knows when Jack’s eyes fly wide open that the kid can’t do it. He doesn’t know how, and it’s too much, and there’s no time, and he’s too scared. The world’s gonna end because Jack is so scared of doing the wrong thing, he can’t stop himself from collapsing under the pressure. The world is gonna end because no one ever really told him it’s okay to fail. That failure is a little bit what being alive is for.
The table had gone from polite interest to a kind of intrigued silence. Castiel decided to take that as a good sign and continued.
“You’re kidding right? Charlie idolizes Ash, and he worships the ground she walks on. They’re just not… good with sharing,” said Dean. “Only children, let me tell you.”
Castiel tried to look reassured, but it was hard to do when the three men he was going to be sharing the room with walked in and overheard the last part of their exchange.
“Yeah right,” says Claire. “He’s in Heaven, not the same thing. Jody was clear on that with me, just in case I tried to take a trip upstairs early. His greatest hits aren’t exactly the stuff of dreams.”
“How has the drive been for you both?” Castiel asked. They were resting now, and Cas had a feeling they would be camping here for the night, considering the light was fading fast now and Dean hadn’t called for everyone to get moving again.
“Sometimes I really fucking wish you wouldn’t do that,” she said blithely. Cas took the hint and stopped talking, letting Charlie fill the tense air between them with a different world. One where everything had meaning, and the villains were easily recognized if not easily defeated.
“You say that, but Sam told me about your little share and care time back in December. Wanna know what hearing that particular story told me?” asked Dean, looking Cas straight in the eyes. “Well, what it told me was that you’ve got a pretty high tolerance for pain and you’re a fucking idiot. Go see Newman. Then we need to talk about what you did with Meg.”
Cas doesn’t correct him, just grins as Dean pretends to recoil from the cat batting at the carrier door. He sneezes a second later, loudly enough to set off a new round of hissing. Dean rolls his eyes, and then reaches out a hand so Cas can help him up. Scuffing off the knees of his jeans, he looks at Cas closely, like he is trying to find something wrong. Cas does his best to keep his expression bland, loose. Silence stretches between them long enough that Dean feels the need to break it.
"Up until very recently I had convinced myself that this," he shook their hands again, "was nothing more than a fantasy. I'd made peace with that."
stalling for time; he's testing the limits of his physical capabilities. The small, small, vanishingly small part of him that still has the capacity for things like hope and optimism whisper in his ear that if his conversation with Cas goes
"I felt the edges of it," Castiel replied, and goosebumps flared across his skin at the mere memory. "But not completely. We were… interrupted, as you recall."
"Like Chernobyl," Dean says. He remembers Sam showing him the fucked up pictures of the reactor spill for a project he had to do in school. It was the only time history class had ever been interesting.
"So repair it, then," he said in challenge, and Cas met his eyes again. His nostrils flared briefly.
She spared a single glance in Dean's direction, and then she was gone, fleeing through the open cell door in a burst of smoke.
Dean was still looking at him. Castiel gave him the space to do so, avoiding his gaze, knowing it would only make him look away and study the tile floor instead. He was used to Dean staring at him. Always from a safe distance, always with the assumption Castiel hadn't noticed.
The sudden spike of guilt he feels at that thought is intense enough to make him pull out his phone and bring up Cas' contact. Stupid, stupid, stupid. He should've texted him days ago. Cas could be dead in a ditch somewhere and the last thing he ever said to him was—
"I will be," he replied, eyes falling back to Theo. He could feel the angel's fear, as exposed as Castiel's had been. It was irresponsible of him to take such pleasure in it.
Sam sighed and grabbed a plate, spooning a measly helping of home fries onto it. "No bacon. You can't have any meat until all the vamp is out of your system. Don't wanna risk you ingesting blood."
Cas answers him by slipping a hand between them and wrapping it around Dean's dick. He shudders at the contact, and his breath hisses out between his teeth at how sensitive he still is.
It hurts like a bitch to unfold himself out of the car, but Dean isn't about to ask Cas for help, so he grunts and groans as he shoves out of the passenger seat, feeling sorry for himself on his own behalf. He rests his elbows on the hood, catching his breath, and watches as Cas leans on the truck door and says something to Charlie through the rolled down window. The garage has shit acoustics, but Cas speaks so quietly that his voice doesn't echo.
"Yeah, get in line." He watches the empty fields pass them by out of the passenger window, wincing whenever there's a bump. He either needs to check the suspension, or Charlie's driving over every single pothole in the road.
Cas' truck is parked on the street when they pull up to Jody's, right behind the Impala, which upon brief inspection seems to be fine. At least the ghoul didn't fuck up his car. Small mercies.
Castiel suppressed a wince. "He wanted to know about free will, and I told him. It seemed to have inspired something in him."
Dean was unwell enough that he had no interest in talking, and Castiel was grateful for that. He held him carefully, tucking the jacket around him, keeping him steady. The tremors came and went in between fits of retching, and Cas guided him through it. There was an advantage to this upright position, he reasoned. It was easier to prop Dean against the toilet whenever he had to vomit.
Dean makes sure that he's never trapped in the kitchen with Charlie again. It's strictly couch talk from here on out.
Sam got an elbow under him, and Dean helped him sit up. Sam groaned, hand still worrying at the ruined fabric of his shirt around his stomach. It was a peculiar habit of human beings—to fuss and return to what was already settled.
Dean was about as grateful for Castiel's presence now as he had been when he was being shoved into the trunk of the Impala. His shoulders heaved as he vomited blood into the toilet, arm braced on the seat for support. Castiel kept him steady, holding his shoulders, and helped him lie back down on the floor when he was done.
"You tried to bite Charlie in the warehouse." Sam gestured to the bed of the trunk as Castiel hauled Dean next to the car, frowning. He ducked his head to wipe the blood from his nose on his jacket sleeve, then nudged Dean forward.
"Dean was the context of my decision," Castiel finished for him, tone still gentle. "But he was not the decision itself."
He looked up and found Sam standing in the doorway that led into the library. He wore pajama bottoms, and his boots had been replaced with slippers. In his hand was a cup of tea, and it seemed like he was stifling a yawn. He looked as tired as Castiel felt.
Charlie's voice was close, and decidedly far less calm. Sam broke into a run at the sound, and Castiel followed closely behind him, dodging around corpses and batting away the filthy PVC strip curtains hanging between the doorways.
"I know," Cas says, strangled, and begins walking them towards the bed. You're so strong, Cas, please push me harder. Please force my head back more. Please bend me like a compound bow. My spine can take it, honest.
There's some stuff that Dean's still getting used to with Cas, and one of them is the fact that he gets tired. A lot, actually, because Cas hasn't figured out how to moderate his energy levels properly yet, so he throws himself into everything with the same intensity you'd use to start wars. Or maybe his iron is just low. He should probably see a doctor.
"Glad you enjoyed yourself," he muttered, and closed his eyes. God, his balls ached. He'd probably start suffering nerve damage soon. "I'm about fifteen seconds away from blowing it here, so if you—"
before pressing his face back into his pillow, holding back a groan, and wills his aching body to knock itself unconscious.
This is earned, he thinks, this excess is okay. He toiled for it. They both did. Tomorrow there will be bruises on his hips from where Cas had gripped him and held him down on the bed, and by then he'll have enough energy to ask Cas to do it again. And again, and again. The thought of the future makes him dizzy.
Adrenaline still hopping, Cas gives him a sheepish, amused glance that makes him forget how fucking cold it is for a second. "Sorry. She was coming towards you both."
"Claire and Alex, mostly, until I told them to cut it out, which turned into another fight." Jody shrugs in a
"I'm good, Cas," he assures him. No point in worrying the guy. "I'm just old. Listen, I'm gonna let you go. Charlie wants to watch—Stargate." He cringes. Stupid fucking choice of movie. "You good?"
Dean looks up at him again, pulling out his best puppy face. Cas' eyes are hooded, hungry, pupils wide with adrenaline. "What?" Dean says innocently, and squeezes.
Not true. Dean's had concussions before and he's gotten along just fine without anyone's help, thank you very much. He's not even on morphine anymore—officially downgraded to aspirin.
cooked meals for him, but he wasn't about to complain. Sam was a decent cook, even if he never used enough salt.
"Not really," Castiel admitted. He could, technically—easily, even. Under different circumstances, it wouldn't be an issue. But Dean had a habit of making it difficult for him to partition his attention between multiple tasks. He took up too much room, demanding nothing less than the entirety of Castiel's vast and ancient reserves of focus. It was as intoxicating as it was distracting. And there was another part of him, a much more selfish and reckless part, that didn't want to divide himself up. Not when he was lying next to Dean, their legs tangled underneath the blankets and his mouth still raw and tingling from the rough scrape of Dean's stubble.
“Please take her to Dean Winchester. I grew her from him, and I know he will care for her. I cannot any longer. Her name is Claire,” said Kaia with a frown on her face. “Um.”
She can feel the heat of the fire as pieces of the ceiling start to fall onto the floor. She sees out of the corner of her eye as the curtains catch. She’s already almost out of time. She yanks the locket out of the plastic evidence bag they’d brought to the burned down house and sees the two ghosts materialize in the room, their feet standing out ghostly pale against the flames licking down the plaster walls. Eileen feels the vibrations of a resounding boom as part of the ceiling collapses, partly over the bed. The fire is burning so hot, Eileen flinches away from it. She only just has the presence of mind to throw the locket into the thick of the fire before rolling out from under the bed, and trying to see through the smoky haze to find the door.
“Here’s hoping for death,” said Cas, doing his best to sound ominous. Jo laughed at him, and Cas tried to stay angry at her but found himself hugging her tightly before returning to Kelly’s side. Jo gave him a little salute which he returned. Then he and Kelly made their way down the stairs.
Castiel’s hand brushed over the scar of his bullet wound and before he could blink, Gabriel had pulled out a knife and plunged it into his leg. Afterwards, Castiel shouted several obscenities, more than one of which Gabriel laughed at.
A resounding ‘yes sir’ came back at him. Castiel and Selma were then sent off, the only adjustment to Benny’s original order that he kindly asked Selma that Castiel do all the work himself. He had a sinking feeling she was going to take Benny up on that.
Cas sighs and pulls out a chair to sit next to Jack. For a while he doesn’t say anything, only thinks. Jack waits nervously, wondering what the verdict is going to be. He isn’t sure what Cas will tell him and he’s afraid of what it might be.
The only sign that Jack’s even still alive is his breathing, short and shallow. Then his eyes open and flash gold for a second before returning to normal. The halo of light around him starts to fade, and the dark cracks of unreality running through him are filled with little streams of mixed silver golden light. A small pulse of energy bursts through the room, and the binding spell sparks and fails. Jack sits up, then stands. He looks down at himself, blinks. He’s whole again, Dean realizes. If he wasn’t dying, he’d laugh in fucking disbelief.
“Right, right.” A tug of recognition at the name pulls at him, but he can’t quite place why it sounds more familiar. Either way. “I thought Sinclair & Sons usually held the rough stock contract this far out west.”
Unobstructed now, Castiel is close enough he catches a glimpse of the man’s face and somehow beyond the black mouth guard tightly clamped in his jaw he is… smiling? He wonders who has the sense of self to smile while riding a twelve hundred pound hurricane.
He stands with Benny for a little while longer, listens to his advice on his upcoming ride and affirms that his gear was checked and double checked. He checks the fit of Dean’s protective vest twice, gives his chest a thump to mark his satisfaction. Dean forces down the spike of annoyance at Benny’s fussing. This ain’t his first rodeo by any means, but he understands his friend’s caution. Injuries from a worn cinch strap or bronc rein are rare, but not impossible. Benny knows this firsthand.
Benny and Castiel trot back to their places together, Benny smirking like the smug bastard that he is.
“I’m here for a bucking horse, Dean-o. Looks cool, but no extra points from a horse that tries to mount a fence.”
Castiel’s forehead wrinkles as his eyebrows raise high. “That’s a tragedy indeed. I suppose I should… give you something to remember me by.”
His back aches, his feet are sore, and it took every ounce of willpower he possessed not to sink right into the motel bed after his brief shower. But he had given his word to Benny to at least make an appearance tonight.
The corners of Dean’s lips are downturned, his brows arched high. Castiel thinks about kissing that frown back into a smile.
. And no, haven’t heard a damn thing. Well, no. Did get a very heated drunken voicemail, but that’s it.”
His words have the intended effect. Castiel immediately looks concerned, brows knitted together over his deep blue eyes. “Okay.”
. It’s something straight out of a western, and he says as much. Benny slings an arm over his shoulders and laughs.
Castiel smiles at him and pulls Dean in for one more kiss with a hand fisted in his shirt. “Great. Text me in the morning and I’ll give you the barn number.”
Benny heaves himself to a stand and stretches, joints popping. “Still going to Silver Bullet later?”
Cole unfolds it and the sound he makes is more bark than it is laugh. “Path to Perdition. Jesus, that’s… ominous.”
Benny sits heavily beside Dean on rickety plastic chair. “That’s old Pirate, Dean. You’ve met before, I believe.”
The Silver Bullet bar is fictional, probably. I doubt Caldwell, ID has a western-theme bar with LGBT inclusivity vibes but in my world it does. This matters, because Dean is, if you hadn't picked up, totally into dudes but he's still a little freaked out by it.
He pays little mind to the names of the roughstock riders, but he perks up when he hears the name of the next horse.
Castiel nods and squeezes Charlie’s hand once more before leaning back on his own bar stool. “Benny tells me you’re a rodeo DJ.”
“We shall,” he rumbles. Even through his shirt, Dean can feel the heat of Cas’s hand where it curls around his bicep. “Dean. I’m not going home with you tonight.” His tone is matter of fact, with a trace of apology.
As promised, the red horse takes her time clearing the chute area. She takes two long strides, and Castiel holds his breath waiting for the rider to drop his heels from her shoulder too soon as seems to happen, anticipating her first jump too early. It doesn’t happen.
At the same time a pair of strong arms wrap around his torso, Castiel drops the reins in his hand and grips the man beneath his arm. “I’ve got you,” he shouts.
“Leave it to you, a man who rides horses professionally and puts a cowboy hat on before he puts pants on in the morning to be enamored with old-school western cliches.”
A warm feeling spreads through his chest as Dean grins and rolls his head to the side. “What can I say, I know what the ladies like.” Castiel watches Dean’s mouth part as he exhales softly, the hesitant way his green eyes glances at Castiel from the corners. “And the fellas, too.”
“No, but I do!” Charlie pipes up from behind him. Castiel swivels on his stool, where Benny and Charlie sit, watching them with amusement. He had been so pulled in by Dean, he’d honestly forgotten they were not alone at the bar.
Castiel curls his fingers around Dean’s wrist where it sits atop the bar, fingers tapping on the wood to a different beat than the country music playing. He hums gently, as if soothing a spooked horse. The skin there is heated and soft to the touch-- a stark contrast to the rough callouses Castiel felt on his hand previously. “I can see that. And I also don’t mind. I may work with my family, but I’m not exactly close with them, save for my favorites. To hear of your obvious bond with Sam is refreshing, to say the least.”
Garth pops out of the top of the barrel looking for all the world like a prairie dog and shakes his finger at the announcer. Their snarky exchange, all for the sake of entertaining the crowd, broadcasts across the outdoor stadium from the microphone packs clipped on their belts.
It isn’t until Dean is in the Impala, halfway to his motel that he remembers he forgot to ask Cas for his phone number.
“Bradbury. She sent a text earlier, informed me my presence was not mandatory but ‘highly encouraged’ for celebratory drinks.”
Castiel rides in their direction and a pulls up short a few feet away. His eyes are lighter than Castiel would have thought, the glass green eyes sparkling with adrenaline. He proffers the rescued hat without a word.
Dean leans further into Castiel’s space, and that’s when he notices just how close they’re now sitting. The slight movement forward brings Dean’s knee flush against his own, and there’s a hand on his thigh. When did that get there? “You want to get out of here?”
Benny gives him a final hard clap to the shoulder and turns away from Dean. He watches until Benny disappears down the steps of the platform and turn his attention back to watch what’s happening at the other end of the arena. The steer wrestling event looks like it’s just about finished, and he can see announcer of the night perched on a tall black horse, attempting to lasso the rodeo clown.
“I don’t know,” said Dean, still smiling. “Some guys just like to be the one behind the wheel. In control. You can control the pace, when to hit the brakes, how hard you want to go-“
“Mom agreed that looking for Kelly wasn’t going to be a priority,” Dean said when Castiel didn’t answer. “Figured that would make you happy. Maybe even get you to see your friends. They miss you.”
“I’m not supposed to… be involved. In earthly matters,” says Cas. He looks a little more normal now. Awkward and uncomfortable and itching to leave. Or to just not have to explain himself. It was familiar enough to get Sam’s head up and running again.
“I don’t like to count that,” says Cas. There’s a shift in Dean’s expression. “Considering she lied to me about who she was, and then tortured and stabbed me.”
“Fuck off. You think that was my call? Or that that was easy? Do you want to know what your problem is, Cas? It’s that you seem to think that if you tell people the truth they’ll do what they’re supposed to and fall in line.”
“That sounds ominous,” said Castiel. “I don’t know if anyone informed you of this, but I was chased away from Ira.”
‘Your computer friend. Charlie,’ she signs. ‘She figured out what apartment he’s staying in from his publisher. So I… hit him over the head and left him in the trunk?’
“No. No, she’s been walking on damn egg shells around me. She’s trying so hard and it still isn’t working,” said Jo. “Sometimes love isn’t enough, y’know?”
“Are you alright?” he asked. The boy shook himself and nodded, though now he looked at Dean with an emotion one should never feel in Lebanon if one values their sanity: curiosity.
“Yeah. You don’t meet people’s eyes when you’re lying,” said Benny. “You look just a little bit off to the side. It’s subtle.”
Castiel looks at Billie and then back at Dean. He seems to come to a decision. He reaches out, gripping Dean’s forearm so tight it hurts. Before Dean can even think to reach back, to ask how Cas is alive, to ask anything about what the Hell is going on, everything goes blank. His last thought is of Billie’s dry laugh, as she turns another page and keeps on reading her tragedy.
“So one more thing,” said Dean after going through a list of things they could and could not do while in McCleod city, most of which involved stroking the king’s ego and Cas’ least favorite of which was that his majesty expected them all to bow when introduced to him. “From now on, if anyone asks, Charlie and I are engaged.”
Several of his brothers and sisters had fallen in this mission, and their sacrifices would be honored in Heaven. But not yet. The Righteous Man had drawn blood in Hell and now he was to be saved, no matter the cost to the Host. Castiel had not known such a battle in many centuries, and his focus on their mission was unwavering.
much like Dean there was a part of Cas that still ached to reach out and touch it. Yet its body-language, the way it stood, the way it walked around Cas, was off enough to repulse him instead. To make him angry.
There was that idea brewing in his mind, along with another one involving an old, run-down bar on the edge of town. The place had been up for sale for years, and the possibility of buying it and turning it into a sort of “Roadhouse 2.0” held growing appeal. Certainly more than spending the rest of his life ganking monsters and worrying about one misstep costing his life.
Cas’s hands slid down to the bottom of Dean’s t-shirt—the only thing he was wearing along with his boxers, so that made undressing go a
“Am I looking at you funny? Because I thought I was looking at you like I wanted you to do that again.”
“No one’s safe here,” Dean said. He sat back, resting against the thick tree trunk beside Cas. Right against him, in fact, pressing shoulder to shoulder. “But I’ll take at least having us all together now.”
So now, this was where Dean came to say his own prayers, on whichever days their lives allowed him the time. He wondered if he’d ever stop looking for Cas when he did so, hoping against hope he’d see him sitting there like before. Waiting for Dean to come find him.
have, instead of remaking this one for...what reasons, exactly? Because it was the shape of himself which Dean knew, and he sensed Dean liked on some level? That had become comfortable to Castiel as well, almost more comfortable and familiar than his cosmic true form of existence?
For there were streamers and party lights, and a heavy bass beat booming throughout the entire bunker. Gabriel’s touch was immediately evident to Cas before he even caught sight of the archangel in a party hat, dancing around the map table with a beer in hand, Claire laughing and dancing along with him.
“Yes, they do,” Cas replied, not caring if he sounded a touch snippy. Benny didn’t like him much, that was obvious, and Cas wasn’t that keen on the vampire, either.
That, and then Dean’s mouth wrapped around the head of his penis and he almost lost all control of himself. As it was, the lights in the room flickered and he groaned out
Cas opened his mouth to say something, but thought better of it. It had been three days now since their reunion on the river bank, and he still hadn’t figured out what exactly Dean and Benny’s relationship entailed—nor did he especially want to know the details. To think about it too much was to twist him up in a way he’d learned to identify as jealousy, and he did not care for it. Dean dropped his arm and seemed desperate to get even a few minutes of rest, so Cas vowed to stay as still as possible, to let him enjoy it.
“I think that’s a good idea,” Zeke said as soon as Dean laid out his plan to depart with Cas tomorrow.
“Yes, home. You’re here. I’m here. The field near the bunker, remember? Your favorite.” Cas finally made the effort to sit up, his arms wobbly so Dean reached down to help him. Cas shuddered as Dean’s arm wrapped around him, eyes widening. Then his gaze narrowed on Dean. “Cas…?”
“No, Cas, it was awesome,” Dean insisted, cutting off the self-doubting angel. “You want to know why?”
But then he saw the angry red marks in several places on the angel’s chest and abdomen. They looked like stab wounds and slices, healed over but still raw and obviously tender. Dean's concern quenched his desire long enough to ask, as he reached out to touch one below his right shoulder, “Cas…? What are these from?”
Dean slammed his palm over the sigil, his blood mixing with Cas’s as the air seemed to catch on fire and a sonic boom exploded in his ears. There was a piercing cry followed by a groan that sounded too much like it came from Cas. Dean squeezed his eyes shut and dared not look until the barn, once more, fell silent and the blinding light faded.
He knew Dean was hurting now, still upset and angry about what he’d done, but in time that would get easier. That’s how human grief was supposed to work.
strange things, sometimes. Lights on in the barn when no one should be inside. I’ve found animal carcasses and bones, strange markings on the walls or in the dirt... Other weird occurrences, but for all I knew it was local kids goofing around late at night, playing with the occult. Kids ’round here get into that stuff after listening to too much Black Sabbath. If there is a real ghost or spirit, it’s mostly left me alone.”
“Might’ve been our fault, catching a lift.” Dean looked up, startled at the unexpected yet familiar voice. And his jaw dropped to see none other than Gabriel standing a few feet away from them.
Cas fixed his eyes—every single one of them—on Dean as he stroked himself in preparation. He looked so fiercely magnificent, every bit the soldier of Heaven he had once been. Dean understood why so many of the other angels feared and respected him, had been willing to follow him into battle. He, too, would submit himself to this beautiful creature—to the angel Castiel and no one else.
Benny does just that, and the way Dean gently grips Castiel’s hand makes him raise his eyebrows. It lacks the hypermasculine show of force Castiel would have expected from the rough-and-tumble rodeo types. The irony that he, himself, is no doubt being judged for the same is not lost on him.
Dean doesn’t respond. His eyes draw back to the man on the grey. He sits tall in the saddle, and while he’s too far away to make out any facial features the dark grey of his hat and the shock of his deep blue shirt make a pretty picture, Dean decides.
The roughstock riders had done their draw two days prior to the Saturday night event, and Dean watched as much footage as he could on the horse whose name he had drawn. Most of it was poor cellphone quality, but he had managed to find a few professional videos of the stocky red mare. She took a little longer to find her stride leaving the chute than he preferred, which was a problem when he only had eight seconds to impress the judges.
He settles the hat over the windblown mess of his hair and makes a show of tipping the bill at Castiel. “My hero,” he croons.
Castiel drops his hand from Dean’s face and presses gently against his chest. “I really do need to be awake early tomorrow.”
“You got a knife?” Dean reluctantly unclips his pocketknife from his belt and hands it over. “Much obliged. The guy runs stock transport for
Dean eases into the familiar grooves of his saddle on an unfamiliar horse, and the beat of his heart is loud in his ears. He works his jaw around the mouthguard clenched between his teeth.
Satisfied, he looks up and watches Benny and another man ride into the arena from the other side. Dean doesn’t recognize Benny’s partner, but that isn’t a surprise. He trots in on a narrow-chested dapple grey beside Benny, who is riding the ugliest mule Dean has ever seen.
“Not much, just Dean’s self-proclamation that he’s going to be the next Ms. Rodeo USA,” Benny informs her sincerely.
The saddle-bronc event finishes, and Castiel notes that neither rider was able to beat Dean for the lead. He pats the sweat-soaked neck of Anathema as he hears the next group of broncs stomping their way from the stackyards towards the chutes.
Castiel anchors himself to the saddle horn and shouts to the man to get off the bronc, but her rider is already leaning into Castiel.
“You ever wonder how he keeps the damn mic in place?” Cole shouts at his elbow. Dean follows his gaze to the center of the arena where Garth is- Jesus, Dean didn’t even know the kid could do a single cartwheel let along four in a row.
Garth is a colorful blur as he vaults over the fence to harass Bobby Singer some more during the lull, and Castiel and Benny switch to fresh horses for the next event. Finally, Castiel relents.
is pulled from two hundred voices. The cowboy, Dean doesn’t immediately recognize who, is on his hands and knees in the dirt of the arena.
Dean sees the comment for what it is-- an opportunity to turn the conversation and he seizes it gratefully. Castiel’s breath catches when Dean turns his hand upwards and runs his thumb along the top of Castiel’s knuckles. How long he and Dean have been talking, he can’t be certain, but at least long enough to match him in drinking four more beers. He can feel his face heat but cannot attribute the flush to alcohol alone.
Castiel worries his bottom lip between his teeth, and Dean’s gaze flicks down to watch before jumping back to his eyes. “What are you doing tomorrow?”
Dean twists out from Benny’s arm and only makes it a few steps before  remembering himself and doubling back to give Charlie a hug. He isn’t sure when he’ll see her again, but he knows their paths will cross sooner than later in the next month at least. “I’d stay, but…” He shrugs helplessly.
Dean turns face, and Castiel feels the rough scrape of stubble against his jaw. Dean’s exhale is hot on Castiel’s neck as he breathes his next words. “N-- No? Cas I’m not the sharpest tool in the shed, but there’s no way I’ve been reading this--” he pulls far enough away to gesture between them, “
“Dean, I…” Dean hesitates to close the distance between them, still unsure if he’s allowed to. Castiel moves against him, and then his mouth is on Dean’s. The gesture is chaste, sweet even. His eyelids flutter closed, and he pushes back softly. Castiel’s lips part against his, and the taste of beer is bitter on his tongue. It’s over sooner than Dean wants. Castiel pulls away, and Dean feels his fingers move through the hair short on the back of his neck. “Dean,” he murmurs. “I think that is one of the worst lines I’ve ever heard and believe me. I’ve heard a lot.”
Benny slips from his barstool and together the four make their way out of the saloon doors, which Dean points out are
They watch for a moment together as the man stumbles onto his feet before turning their horses to follow the bronc as he sprints and bucks along the fence line with what looks to Castiel as unadulterated glee. Benny rips the strap from the horse’s flank, leaning precariously forward on his tall mule. The horse, obviously a veteran of the rodeo, trots and hops his way to the other end of the arena with almost no guidance from Castiel.
The woman places her fingertips in his hand and does her best curtsey, an impressive feat considering she is seated on a tall stool. “Oh please, Charlene is-- just call me Charlie. Castiel?”
The pick-up men spur their horses swiftly to either side of the still-bucking dun horse. Dean isn’t sure if Benny has ever worked with the man on the grey before, but they move as an efficient team regardless. Blue-shirt reaches across the rear of the bronc and pulls the release on the flank strap while Benny presses his mule in close, and in no time at all has one arm around the kid pulling him safely from the back of the horse and deposits him on the ground.
“I’ll bet he did.” Dean looks over Castiel’s shoulder, and they see that Benny’s back is deliberately turned to them. He and Charlie appear to be debating the merits of selecting an Android phone over iPhone, but Castiel is not naïve enough to believe one ear isn’t tuned into the conversation between himself and Dean. “What did he tell you?”
When Castiel finally pulls into the parking lot outside the Silver Bullet Pub and Grill, it’s nearly an hour passed the time Benny gave him. He hadn’t intended to arrive so late, but between putting up Anathema in the stables adjacent to the main arena and ensuring his brother’s livestock were separated properly from the other contractor’s-- horses time had well and truly gotten away from him. He shifts his Dodge into park and takes a few steadying breaths before he cranks the door open.
Theo tightened his arm around Dean's neck. The vessel Theo inhabited had broad features, and a horrific looking cut across his face, the scar tissue pale and old. "What do you say?"
Theo didn't give him time to answer. Instead he circled around, boots carelessly dragging across the protruding wing as he did so, and the bones bent painfully under the weight.
He understood, too, that it was tempting fate to linger here, so he stood up from the bed. The movement was painful, graceless, but he rose to his full height, and Dean continued to stare at him, silent and inscrutable.
"Dean…." The rag scrunches in Cas' hands, and his eyes dart around the roof, restless. "I would have helped you, had you asked."
Dean was too close to look at him properly. He felt so much larger now, curled around Castiel as he was. The strength in his arms and the warmth of his skin was nourishing. Even in cuffs, Castiel felt the exquisite force of Dean's soul thrum through his body. They'd never been this close before—not for this long, not since Castiel had carried him out of Hell.
bad," he says as he frames Cas' ribs with his hands, fingers brushing over the Enochian tattoo. He knows how needy he's being; they've just spent the last however many hours fawning over one another. But Cas has this wonderful habit of putting everything in Biblical terms, like the need to fuck Dean has dire implications for the state of the universe. Which, he supposes, is technically true.
Dean frowns. Apparently they're already moving into weirdo territory with this conversation. Alright, well, two can play at that game. "Are you familiar with what happens when you eat too many of those Wal-Mart sheet cakes?" he counters. "Your shit turns green."
This is stupid. Very, really, insanely stupid. It would take nothing at all to reach across the bed and touch—well, anything, actually. Cas' elbow could be erotic in certain contexts. And Cas is not someone who takes a lot of convincing to jump into bed. They're already
Cas shifted beneath him. Not physically; his body began to refract, shimmering until Dean thought he could see the outline of him—not as an angel stuffed into the meagre vessel of a human body, but as Cas himself. It was only for the fraction of the second, but he could see him suddenly, plainly, hanging in the sky above. Giant, celestial curtains suspended from a single, tight locus, a stitch in the fabric of reality. There was the impression of vast interlocking walls, stretching in all directions, a crossroads of pearlescent marble that met in impossible intersections, emanating from the same, unknowable origin—Cas himself. A pillar, Dean thought, and understood then that angels were not just instruments but foundations, too. Load-bearing brackets upon which the universe suspended itself.
"The orders you receive can be truthful, and they can still be wrong," Castiel said gently. "When I understood that, I understood that I had to rebel."
"Jonah." The room around him flickered. He thought it was the lights, then realised it was his eyes growing heavy. "I know you don't want to keep doing this."
"It's okay," he says, rubbing his eyes. "It's not—that was a one-off thing, what happened with your husband and kid. It's something else, I promise." He pauses to yawn. "Was the husband's grave disturbed?"
His lasagna mishap may have worked out in his favour, because he's lying back on the bed without a shirt on, and Cas moves around their motel room like he's stalking the grounds outside the den of an unsuspecting prey animal. Oh, but the rabbit
Dean was listing again, this time into Castiel's chest, and he slumped back into him with a wet, rattling cough. The sweat from his cheek left an imprint on Castiel's shirt, and Dean was very warm. Gone was his resistance to being cared for—he must be more sick than he was letting on. Castiel folded his jacket closer around him, holding him gently.
Castiel helped him up, keeping his jacket draped around Dean's shoulders, and collected his washcloth and water bottle before leading him towards the doors to the hallway.
he's ever felt. His bedroom is a lot more comfortable than Hell. And the Pit didn't have cable, or microwaveable takeout. But most of the time it feels like his brain is marinating in acid, floating from one catastrophic thought to the next. And he doesn't even have beer!
Cas looks up immediately, surprise blooming across his face, because Dean never does this shit anymore, because he's a horrible useless person to be with. His arm tightens, hand flattening on the small of Cas' back, and pulls them flush together at the hips.
Dean frowned. The flush was fading from his cheeks as he thought. "You mean the—the thing where you shove your hand through my chest?"
"Thanks," he whispers, and the words don't leave the air between them. Cas kisses him one more time, agonisingly sweet, before he sits up on an elbow, smiling down at him.
"I can't torture you too much about it, anyway," she says goodnaturedly. "You're like the bunker punching bag right now. Feels like I'm kicking a puppy."
"You need time to recover," Cas told him. "I took more from you than I intended to. It'll be awhile before I can safely attempt something like that again."
Jody goes over to Cas and pulls him into a hug, which he accepts almost desperately. Not many people hug Cas these days, Dean thinks, and something awful twists up inside his gut.
Dean hears the wistful note in his voice, even though he's pretty good at hiding it now. He clears his throat and tosses Cas a grin, striking a deliberately casual tone. "What, they didn't give you shop classes in angel school?"
It took Cas a moment to respond, his mind struggling to focus on the conversation at hand and not how incredibly warm Dean was. "It… will drain you," he said roughly, looking up at him. "And it's dangerous."
Inhale, hold, one, two, exhale, hold, one, two. Inhale, hold, one, two, exhale, hold, one, two. Cas has weirdly even breathing patterns. Is that normal? Maybe he should go see a doctor.
Dean doesn't mean for it to come out like that, but Cas winces all the same. "I texted her first to see how she's doing with school," he explains.
"Yes," Cas says, sounding properly annoyed now. The expression on his face is long-suffering. "Dean, you—I'm not exactly an expert on intimate relationships, but you've seemed averse to much of it. And if you—if you aren't comfortable with continuing, or if this is moving too quickly for you, then I will accept that. It will take me some time," he adds, throat working, "but I don't want you to be with me if—if this isn't also making you happy."
"Yeah, and now there's blood all over my living room carpet." Jody closes her notebook and fixes him with a hard glare. "How much of a talk do I need to give you?"
He stumbled as his foot caught in a divot, slowing him further, and he looked down to see his right shoe ensnared in a pothole. There was water collecting at the bottom of it, and it seeped quickly through the sole of his shoe, making his sock damp. He remembered how unpleasant the sensation had been while he was human, and he didn't much care for it now.
Cas has unfortunately finished obliterating the pizza boxes with his bare hands. He takes the flats over to the blue garbage bag that Sam hauls to the recycling centre every week, leaving Dean to contemplate the many, many, many muscle groups in Cas' back and shoulders and arms.
Taking that as a challenge, Cas attempted just that. His upwards trajectory was good, but then he kept moving, stumbling forward, and then Dean was across the room, his hand under his elbow to stabilise him.
Dean moved a good deal in his sleep. He'd long ago grown used to it, and he was surprised now to find that Dean was still sleeping on his side, back pressed against Castiel's chest. His arm was tucked against the one Castiel had wrapped around him, and he began to trace circles on Dean's forearm, disrupting the fine hairs along his skin.
Cas' mouth is twitching, though he looks genuinely offended. "Were you under the impression that I rebelled against the Host, initiated a civil war, and relinquished my Grace merely because I liked you?"
Castiel scanned the exterior of the building, adjusting the collar on his coat in annoyance. The warehouse's use prior to closure appeared to be meat packaging and storage. A faded sign suspended on the southern wall read
He can't really blame Cas for this, because Dean had also been planning to have a talk over breakfast, but their eggs are stone cold by the time either of them have the energy to think about food again. The bacon is still salvageable, at least.
"Sorry about your luck, pal," he says to the cop's corpse. Even he can hear how weak the humour in his voice is, and it doesn't make him feel any better. Dean swallows down the fear that's creeping up his throat.
"Doctor's said you're cleared to leave whenever you like," Charlie cuts in, and her harsh tone sucks all the oxygen out of the room.
"I'm not used to this," he continued softly. His nose nudged Castiel's as he shifted on the bed. He opened his mouth to speak again, but the words never made it past his throat.
"I wouldn't say insane," Cas hums, tilting his head with a twitch of his mouth, and Dean rolls his eyes. But the joke is enough to pull him back down to Earth, and his fingers are steadier as he opens Cas' belt. He works the button loose, pulls down his fly, and then his fingers hook around the waistband of his jeans and boxers both, impatiently pulling them down. Cas helps, working his pants down to his thighs before they fall into a puddle at his feet, and then Cas is completely naked before him.
if he was feeling that way, but he tries to shove that down. He's not ruining his good mood, not when he just got back on speaking terms with Cas.
Dean deflates a little. He'll process that later. "Great. Only problem is," he sighs, "we already live together." It feels weird, saying it out loud like this, plain and honest. It's not relief, exactly. More like the emptiness you feel after you vomit.
The sun is setting by the time he gets back to the graveyards. He parks in a nearby cul-de-sac that backs onto the forest and walks the rest of the way, trying to look casual. He ditched his sling, replacing it instead with a backpack that carries a sheathed machete and a few bottles of water. Sammy would be proud of how prepared he is. The only thing missing is a packed lunch.
Dean rolls his eyes, hangs his head, and feels the laughter rumble out of Cas. "You're never gonna let that go, are you."
Cas doesn't sleep next to him at night. He doesn't come into his room at all, in fact, or at least, not that Dean ever sees. There's always fresh water on his nightstand, along with some extra aspirin if he needs it, but he never actually catches Cas putting it out for him—if it even is him. His caretaker may as well be Santa Claus.
next update might take a bit longer since I’m still in the process of writing the back half of this fic. thanks for all the lovely comments so far!!
"We need to—" He clears his throat. He is not going to vomit. "We need to check every one of these crypts."
But then uncertainty colours Cas' voice when he speaks, and Dean's done it again, made Cas unsure of this whole thing between them. "I'm sorry, I thought our conversations earlier in the kitchen—"
Dean grins. "I jerked off in the bathroom after, when you went to get us some coffee. God, I was hard the entire time, I could barely stand it. And I couldn't stop thinking about you—"
"I called Cas last night," she says calmly, and a bucket of ice dumps into his veins. "He's on his way into town now."
Dean laughs quietly as he slips out of his jeans and into a pair of wrinkled pajama bottoms he pulled from his bag. "I feel you."
Belatedly, he registers what Cas just told him. He tries to think of the fanciest place he's ever eaten at, and figures a king's dining table must be a hundred times more fancy than that. And now they're eating lasagna out of styrofoam containers on top of a public picnic bench, drinking warm beer out of a can.
"You gotta drink the next round in a few hours," Sam continued, worry creeping into his voice. "Might be easier on an empty stomach."
He stood up from Dean's bed before he did anything truly idiotic. Castiel arranged the water bottle and washcloth on the nightstand so that they were both easily within reach, and with a final, parting
"Goodnight, Dean," Cas says before shutting the bedside lamp off, and something aches in his chest at how far away he sounds. Dean folds his arms over himself, clenching his jaw and squeezing his eyes shut. His bed is way too fucking large.
Dean shrugged. "Well D&D is kinda like that, but cooler. And you get to sit down while you play," he added, working a finger under his sunglasses to rub at his eyes. "It's fun. You should play with us, but you have to ask Charlie how the character stuff works."
Castiel ducked under the crooked door frame, listening to the sound of footsteps rapidly approaching from a hallway to his right. It was completely dark inside; he blinked, waiting impatiently for his vessel's eyes to adjust. Another inconvenience.
Dean reached into his back pocket and offered his brother a spare clip. "More than you. Should do the trick."
"Yeah, no, I—Cas, I'm good." He laughs nervously, which makes him sound soooo convincing, and Dean realises he's gonna have to break out some more open, honest communication if he wants this to go any further. "I'm kinda wigging out, if I'm bein' honest."
He feels sick with loneliness thinking about the last time they actually touched. Properly, not just like a hand brush or whatever. It must have been in Michigan, when he had that nightmare. And how long ago was that? At least a few weeks by this point. Well, he better saddle up and get ready to deal. Something as good as Cas holding him in bed now exists in the realm of memory only, like most good things that have happened to him, and his future prospects in that department aren't all that promising.
"You bared your soul to me," Castiel explained calmly as Dean looked around, like he needed a reminder of where they were.
Dean stares at her for a long moment, gobsmacked. He really wants to hug her, but he's unsure if they're back to the hugging stage of their relationship yet or not. Charlie takes pity on him and holds her arms out, and he crushes her in a hug so hard it makes her squeak.
Jonah screamed. The room filled with his Grace, suffocating Castiel, blinding him. The window on the western wall shattered; the water in the basin trembled. The air around them was heavy with holy static, and in the next instant it contracted, and Jonah was gone.
"Yeah," he forces out, trying for a light tone. Charlie's still giving him that look, the one that says she's unsure of what to make of him. "I, um, I owe you big time."
"I think this was the first sensation I remember enjoying," Cas says quietly beside him. "The rain. It's very grounding. Even as an angel, it made me feel like a pin in the earth."
He nods, because he can't form coherent sentences right now. That's another conversation he needs to have with Cas, later maybe, about how sometimes all he wants is for Cas to use him, push his body to the brink and leave him spent and numb on the bed, unable to move or think. It's not an obligation thing; it's not even really a selfless thing, much as he'd like to pretend otherwise sometimes. The truth is that being a pillow princess for an angel is about the sweetest gig Dean can think of. And, for some baffling reason, he's landed the job. Didn't even need to show his resume.
Castiel wiped up the water and refilled the bottle, wincing as he listened to Dean dry heave into the toilet. He remembered that sensation, too. It had happened to him only once as a human, when he'd eaten a bad meal at a diner, and he had immediately blacklisted it as an experience he never wanted to repeat again.
After a couple minutes, he finally gets himself back under control. He pulls away eventually, wipes at his face, and lets out a shuddering breath.
He turned, looking at Hannah. She was staring at him, eyes restless, pinched with apprehension. Like Oren and Theo, she was also injured, spent from the fight and swaying where she stood.
Cas says nothing to that. When Dean looks up from his split knuckles, the expression on his face makes his breath hitch. There's fond, and there's loving, and then there's whatever is on Cas' face.
Or, well, it seemed that way, but his eyes slide to Claire instead, then Charlie, hovering over both of them for a long moment. "Are you alright?" he asks, and it's unclear who exactly he's speaking to.
That finally got Charlie to smile, and she grabbed his character sheet off the table. "He's pretty stoked about playing. I haven't DM'd in a while either, so I'm pumped. I think I'm gonna have to pick his cantrips and spells for him, though."
and Castiel felt his stomach clench in horror. Without his consent, his body began to breathe rapidly, making his ribs burn and his throat ache. Every time it opened, a part of him fantasised that it would be Jonah walking through the door instead of Theo. He'd stopped imagining anyone else—that sort of hope was too painful to entertain, even to himself.
He looked over his shoulder at Dean, and his breath caught in his throat. He'd seen Dean in the mornings, of course, before he'd gotten dressed or showered or styled his hair for the day. But it felt different now. It felt remarkable. Castiel knew the origin of the pink mark on Dean's left cheek; he'd been lying on the crease of his pillow case. The irritated skin around his mouth was from kissing last night. And his hair was tousled, not just from sleep but from Castiel's fingers. If he had been able to show Jonah this, perhaps he would have understood sooner.
Cas doesn't move as Dean steps up the ramp and sits down heavily next to him. Eyeballing the inside of the truck, he figures they've got about another hour's worth of work. He's dreading the mattress and box spring in particular.
Sam watched him but said nothing, idly pushing around his home fries and bacon with a spatula as Dean poured himself coffee. He itched at the brand on his arm as he took a careful sip from his mug, grateful that it didn't taste like absolute shit. He was approaching somewhere between nauseated and hungry, and the bacon was starting to call his name from the other side of the counter.
"You're very bad at lying when aroused," Castiel observed, and the answering glare Dean gave him was more than worth it.
"And give me a little bit of credit," she adds, tone light. "It's not that hard to spot. You guys were pretty cozy in that truck."
"You look better," Charlie says tentatively, watching him lean forward and stretch his back out. "You were super pale in the cemetery."
He's got Cas pinned to the wall in front of him, a firm hand on one of his thighs. Dean runs his tongue along the underside of his dick, his other hand brushing his balls, the base of his cock. The air is thick with steam as he places teasing kisses all over Cas' skin, relishing the small, frantic noises Cas can't seem to stop making. He goes slow—slow enough that his knees are killing him by the time he's done—but it's worth it to hear all the agonised moans coming out of Cas, his desperate pleas for more, the fingers twisting up in Dean's hair, and the exquisite rush of triumph as Cas groans out his long overdue relief when Dean finally lets him come.
Dean reached for him now. His fingers nudged at the curling hairs at the back of Castiel's neck, and he ducked down to kiss him. His breath was sharp with the taste of mint.
"Dean." Warm fingers press under his jaw, checking his pulse probably, and then a firm hand grabs his chin. "Dean. Can you hear me?"
He didn't need Dean's permission to leave—he could have left hours ago—but Cas wanted it anyway. "Are you sure?"
Jonah's frustration was immediate. He didn't lash out, but Castiel could feel his Grace filling the room, agitated. It smelled like petrichor. "Raphael was left in charge. We were to follow his command."
Castiel cleared his throat. "He asked me about…." The chains rattled above him as he shifted his feet. "About free will."
Cas' pace doesn't let up, and obscene noises start pouring out of Dean's mouth. Cas is still getting a hang of this whole thing, so sometimes his strokes are too shallow, or too deep, and the head of his dick doesn't always hit Dean's prostate right, but he's shaking apart anyway. He's worked up so bad, and so is Cas, and every gasp and moan that rips out of Cas' throat zings straight to his dick.
Hunched over his desk and shooting a surreptitious look over his shoulder to confirm that no one is secretly hiding under his bed or in the corners of his room, Dean carefully types out his question with his index finger, each keystroke deliberate. His other hand is busy tapping against the side of his tumbler, keeping it at the ready in case he needs reinforcements.
The pain was debilitating. He wanted to advise Jonah that this was not how to conduct an interrogation. Too much pain fogged the mind, made people too eager to placate their captor and say whatever they wanted to hear. He struggled to recall the details of his campaign in Heaven, despite its recency.
"What a horrible fate," Jody says, shooting him a grin. "People looking after you. Can't imagine the toll."
The ghoul grins, a caricature of himself. "You're funny, Dean," it tells him, the cadence of its voice eerily familiar. "Makes up for how dumb you are."
Dean wrestles Cas out of his own shirt, which is difficult because Cas has decided he's never going to let go of him, even to remove his clothes, but they manage. He's rewarded for his efforts with a broad expanse of pale skin, his arms and neck a beautiful blush of sun-kissed brown, and Dean's knees threaten to buckle when Cas pulls them flush together, kissing him again. He can feel how hard Cas already is, how hard he is, too, and the pit of his stomach is molten, boiling up and over and spilling into his ribs. They need to get the rest of their clothes off, but he can't stop touching him. The inner teenager in him is screaming
