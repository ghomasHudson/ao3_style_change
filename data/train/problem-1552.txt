Check out was noon, we left a little after eleven after having slept in and had a lovely breakfast. Sherlock drove along the coast road from Eastbourne to Folkestone where we ended up stopping for gas and a coffee. From there we ended up following the M20 then the A20 back to London with a few breaks along the way to stretch our legs and a quick lunch.
Sherlock scowls at the plate of stew Mrs. Hudson placed in front of him before answering, “I’m a Consulting Detective. I’m the only one in the world, I invented the job.” At the look on Mrs. Hudson’s face, Sherlock picks up his fork and reluctantly takes a small bite.
Our reservation has us seated in a window lined corner with a lovely view of the Pacific Ocean and Seal Rock, according to our waiter Patrick. Sherlock orders a bottle of champagne for us while looking over the menu. I elect to start with Tomato Soup with Saffron Risotto as a main dish. I can share both with Rosie. Sherlock decides to start with the Persimmon and Apple Salad with the Bouillabaisse for dinner with the idea of sharing as well.
I see Sherlock perk up, he hasn’t unpacked his computer since New York. I smile at his reaction “Yeah, I think that would be a good idea. Let us grab our laptops and Rosie’s nappy bag and we’ll be right with you.”
At the station the man is processed into the system as ‘John Doe 6-5-1854’ as he cannot prove who he is and the man behind the receiving desk refuses to take him at his word. He tells the officer entering his information into the computer who he is time and again and that everything can be cleared up with a simple phone call to the hospital. He has the right to a call, it’s the law damn it!
“Well, if you present as an Omega it would be imperative we find you a suitable mate fairly young. It’s not healthy for an Omega to wait too long to find a Bondmate.”
Still standing, Charles Crawley turns toward the window, thinning silver hair glinting in the first hint of the morning sunshine.
“No. No, I would love to help! I know just what is needed… I’ll just pop down to Angelo’s later and see what he has in mind for the tables. Does he know how many guests you have yet?”
I reach over and place my hand on his chin to look him in the eye. “Please look at me. It’s all fine. I want to learn how to help you better. Do you prefer your hands tied in front or back?”
At the back row of chairs Molly clicks on a CD player, it starts to play a violin duet of the wedding march. Our guests stand as Molly slowly walks down the aisle in a lavender dress. I glance at Mycroft then turn to watch Sherlock follow Molly toward me. I can’t help the grin on my face, or I believe can Sherlock the one on his. I vaguely hear the click of a couple cameras.
“Sherlock, move the tray to the nightstand” I order. He starts to stand up. “No boy, on your knees” I order. He gives me a look but complies. “Kneel in front of me.” He crawls over, I look down at the drips on my groin then back at him. “I seem to have made a mess. Clean me up.” He starts to turn and reach for a napkin on the tray. I bring back my Captains voice again. “No Sherlock, with your mouth, hands behind your back.” I’m beginning to harden in anticipation and spot he’s starting to do the same.
It helps, I slowly calm down. The worried look on Sherlock’s face eases as I continue to breathe along with him. As I come back to myself I notice Jorge has picked up Rosie and is bouncing her on his hip off to the side. I take a few more calming breathes “I’m sorry Sherlock. Everything is going so fast.”
I place the tray in the kitchen and look down the hall, Sherlock is still in the room with Rosie. I head over to the monitor on the mantle and turn it up, he’s singing a lullaby at her lowly. I turn the volume back down and compose myself before turning back to Mrs. H. “That looks lovely Mrs. Hudson.” I wander into the kitchen where there is a cup of tea prepared how I like. I open the freezer, grab a large icepack, pick up my cup and head out to the lounge.
It seems there was an arsonist running around Northern California the other day, there were fires breaking out all over. We were going to head down to the Rohnert Park Costco for supplies but we headed up to Fort Bragg instead to avoid the smoke and stay out of the way of emergency personnel. Hopefully the authorities catch the person or persons responsible quickly. Sherlock did a quick search and found a website that listed the fires, they all started within one-half to an hour of one another:
Sherlock snorts into my neck where he’s nuzzled his head, breathing deep “Yeah, you could say that. She’s isn’t happy not being allowed out for the wedding. Mycroft is setting up CCTV as we speak so she can watch the ceremony.” He takes a deep breath, breathing in my scent then loosens his grip finally.
“Shower, eat. Then come and kip next to me…” John closes his eye then shifts over in the bed to make room for another body.
“I realize that John, I do trust you. It’s me I don’t trust.” Looking at the ceiling, “Get some sleep. I need to think.”
Before we start eating Kevin pours us glasses of champagne “To your marriage, may you have many happy years together!” he toasts and drains half his glass. Sherlock and I sip our glasses and thank Kevin. The rest of our dinner is passed with pleasant conversation, fantastic food and pleasant company. Kevin had baked the day before so we had chocolate chip biscuits and tea for dessert.
When alone, Sherlock strikes up conversation again. “I, ah, meant to tell you earlier… Mike found something on your lower back John.”
“See babe, electricity to order. Don’t worry, what’s the next photo?” I feel him relax again under my hand. Rosie is just about asleep in my lap.
“Ta.” I head down the stairs followed by Greg. I ask over my shoulder at him “So how much did you win in the pool anyway?”
First things first, they start with setting up Rosie’s room so she can sleep in there tonight. John did have the foresight to pack up her bedding and label the container well. Sherlock and John organize Rosie’s room, bumping into one another here and there, smiling and apologizing. In the end John’s old single bed is in one corner with a menagerie of stuffed toys on it. The crib is in the opposite corner near the door, with the changing table under the window; the wardrobe holds extra crib bedding along with her clothes. One of Mary’s thicker rugs on the hardwood floor.
I wave my free hand to Sherlock’s retreating back “Right, well...I’ll just…” Sherlock, thankfully waits for me at the elevator. “He suspects something is different with us, but can’t figure out what. I wonder what he’d think if he really knew.” I wonder at Sherlock.
“You know my methods John” he jokes back at me. He leans down and starts to kiss me, walking me under the showerhead spray. He has the bottle of lube in one hand and is cupping the back of my head with the other. The kisses are getting deeper and more passionate.
Sherlock rises and shoves his statement at Greg’s chest. He glowers over Greg “John injured his dominant side, which is why I offered to write his report for him.”
It’s not uncommon for John to wake up alone in an empty cold bed. Even though he would prefer the company, he knows Sherlock would be bored to tears just watching him sleep. Today, however, the sheets are still warm and John can hear Sherlock talking to whom he believes to be Rosie in the kitchen. Happily he does a quick stretch of his various limbs before rising to do his morning ablutions.
“I cannot forgive Mary for shooting you. She almost, take that back, she did kill you. Your heart stopped twice, once in the ambulance and once in the operating room. It is still a miracle that you came back the second time, your surgeons had given up. I was confused as to why your first word coming out of anaesthesia was ‘Mary’. The fact that she later threatened you… I understand why you snuck out of the hospital the way you did. I just wish you hadn’t opened up your stiches and set your recovery back. It was easier for me to hear Mary say she shot you than for you to accuse my wife. I still do not understand why you did your best to send me back to her though.”
“We’ve tried contacting the authorities but my since my aunt is an adult and won’t admit to any wrongdoing, nothing can be done! This, this, cretin is robbing my aunt of her freedom, family and friends!
“In the morning I woke up in the same position with the same problem. I knew I loved him then, but he was so scathing in his remarks when he woke up. If he had told me then how he felt… It wasn’t until his best man speech that he admitted it.”
Sherlock watches quietly as she walks around the bed and gently runs a temporal thermometer over John’s forehead. She frowns at the number, looks at Sherlock, “low fever” she states. Then she opens an alcohol wipe and lowers John’s pajama bottoms to expose his hip. She deftly cleans a spot and quickly plunges in the prepared shot. John grunts without waking, tightening his grip around Sherlock.
“No, it just seems like everywhere I went today, he was there. He was behind me in line at the coffee shop, and then he followed me onto the tube. I finally had to come here to see if you and Mr. Holmes could help me. I tried going to the police, but the sergeant I spoke to didn’t take me seriously for some reason. She just kept giggling at everything I said! Most unprofessional.”
“Hold on” I hear an exasperated sigh over the line and grin “Sherlock, what date are you booking our flight for?”
I feel a bit sorry for him until my shoulder spasms again. “Still hard? Think about your brother, naked. Usually works for me.”
Sherlock is greeted by the sight of John, lying on his back unconscious, wrists bound tightly with a length of wire, on the floor in the cold kitchen next to him is a gore covered axe. There is a bloody gash from John’s right eyebrow to above his ear, that side of his face is a giant, blood-stained, swelling bruise. “John!” Sherlock checks for a pulse, steady, and breathing, thank goodness.
“And Mrs. Hudson and I have been washing your pants and socks. Mrs. Hudson shouldn’t have to do our laundry, we have too much what with a baby and all.”
Doctor Murray gently moves John’s hair, talking while he works. “I let an intern do the stitches, he did a stint with the elective/cosmetic surgeons. Surprised he didn’t shave the hair… You shouldn’t have much of a scar though.” He spots the cream on the counter and picks it up, “Can’t hurt to apply more antibiotic cream, they are a bit red.”
Sherlock’s blush only makes him more beautiful as does his erection. I stalk over to the side of the bed and murmur in his ear “Beautiful, clever boy. So good” as I pick up the rope. I gently turn him sideways then pull his arms behind him to tie his wrists together. I run my hand through his hair, grabbing a handful and bringing his mouth up for a deep kiss. My other hand I gently stroke up his thigh, up his taut belly to tweak a pert nipple. Sherlock moans and arches into my touch.
“Just toast and bacon for me today thanks.” Reaching for the second piece of bacon off John’s plate, shoving it whole into his mouth once again, before Mrs. H can turn around again with his plate.
“You know very well that I never went camping. I was lucky I was allowed outdoors what with violin and language lessons.” The pouting, “I had to sneak out to have any fun.”
“That’s fine John, we can cross it off and add something else. I would like to avoid inversion as well.”
“Thank you, don’t worry about it. Family should come first. That’s actually why I’m here.” Big sigh, “Family.”
Déjà vu hits him as a man bumps into him going one direction down the street, only to be stabbed in the neck by a needle by his accomplice heading the other way.
“Excellent! When can we go get your belongings?” Sherlock jumps up from his seat, removing his dressing gown, tossing it over a chair back.
Sherlock is crying too I finally notice. “John, my flatmate, my friend. I love you too. I think I felt it from the start but only realized it once it was too late myself. I missed you so much while I was gone. I guess I feared that someone as good as you would never want someone like me. But now I think we have a second chance. I want the life we used to have with you by my side, forever and always.” Sherlock is leaning forward in his chair.
“Normally, we’re called up here to back up ATF clearing out an illicit plot of marijuana.” Salt-and-pepper haired Sheriff/Coroner concedes. “I’m Sheriff Thomas Allman, I also happen to be the Mendocino county coroner. This is Undersheriff Randal Johnson, my assistant for the day.” Indicating the younger man getting out on the other side of the van.
“God I’m messed up, don’t know how you put up with all of it.” John sighs, nods and releases his grip off of Sherlock before standing. He sways on his feet a moment before offering his right hand out to Sherlock who accepts the hand up.
They worked the scenes backwards, by the time they entered the home of the first suspect both men had grins on their faces.
Apparently I passed out again when they set the joint back in. Sherlock is the only person near when I wake, there were three others before. My left arm is immobilized in a sling and I have an IV drip hooked to me as well. “What happened?” I mumble.
He shakes his head. “Fucking hell that burns! Nothing off other than the backache, a touch of nausea and feeling tired. I put the last down to the time change. Hot shower felt good, but I got overheated though.” That cleared his head.
“Chinese ok?” he asks as Mrs. H pipes up with “I have some leftover beef stew, there is enough for all of us.”
#4 on the list of fires was not a Cal Fire incident, but I have a friend who lives in the area who was told to be prepared to evacuate. Sherlock voices the conclusion I came to while following the information on the TV and Internet. Calfire.org had the times all the fires started, very suspicious for it to be an issue PG&E wires…
Robert kicks John in the back over his right kidney followed by another to his ribs, over where Muldoon had bruised them several weeks back. John cannot hold back a pain filled groan. Robert leans the barrel of a pistol onto John’s right temple and smiles as he orders “Get up old man, we’re gonna have so much fun.”
“I’d turned down his advances during dinner earlier that night. I had never had such strong feelings for someone before and it, um… frightened me a bit. I was an idiot and told him I was flattered by his attention but I was married to my work. By the end of the night I knew I was doomed and he hadn’t even moved his things in yet.”
“Hold on, yeah, one more with a subject line of ‘outside’.” He clicks the email open and reads “I’m not going to bore you with pictures of all the tools and whatnot in the garages, but I will send you the layout and where the extra wood for the woodstoves is located. Let you know what you are in for before you get here… don’t want to frighten you off, but you should be warned I live off-grid.” Sherlock looks at me in horror again “Off-grid, isn’t that code for no electricity John?”
“You’re mine, I saw you first! I fucking shot you in Afghanistan so I could get you. Damn the army and their suppressants. I’m taking what I want and nobody is going to stop me!” Sebastian Moran declares with a growl. “Jim says I can have you while he takes that meddling Holmes for himself.”
Clapping her hands together with a big grin. “Wonderful! Sherlock will be so thrilled. He won’t say but he was so lonely without you here. Won’t you be crowded, the three of you?” She pats John’s arm.
I glare him in the eyes “Greg I am a retired Army Captain, it will come out occasionally! Now are you going to take my statement or not?” I charge. Out of the corner of my eye I see Sherlock wince again; military kink 1, Sherlock 0.
“Lestrade, grab the last few biscuits and meet me at the cashier.” Rising, taking a few steps away only to hastily return, “Oh, do you have any extra clothes? I wasn’t expecting to buy anyone, I think I’m supposed to provide clothing.”
“I could have lost you today…I, I…, John, think about it.” He looks like he needs to pace. “A reward/punishment regimen, I would have to think about my consequences of my actions more fully. I can’t make the right decisions, I require help.” Almost a whisper “I need you teach me.”
John finally realizes where he is, and what he’s doing “Shite!” while quickly rocking back and to the side to sit, hard, on the floor, in front of the couch. “I’m so sorry Greg! Are you alright?” Holding his left arm in his right across his chest.
Sherlock jumps up and just about runs into our room to retrieve both laptop travel bags as I go into Rosie’s room and grab her supplies. We head out to the jeep still parked out front, I get into the passenger seat with Rosie again as Sherlock gently places our laptop cases in the back with Kevin.
Scanning around again to be sure everything is, in fact secure, John spots Sherlock sitting on the ground, cradling his right arm to his chest in obvious pain. He hears Rosie crying, in the house, with the dogs barking and howling along with her. Agent Parks a few yards away is just coming around from being knocked out and agent Kreisler is tied and gagged in the dog run. Agent Burton is MIA, presumably still up at the ‘office’ resting.
Miss Bunny Wigglesworth, our client. That is her actual name. Really. No fooling. Seemed rather chuffed when I asked if I could use her real name too…
“And now I’m choosing not to. I choose you, I should have never have chosen her over you to begin with.”
“We found you, thankfully they kept your phone and left it on. Lestrade booked them for murder, kidnapping and assault. Mycroft found most of the assault on CCTV video. They aren’t getting out anytime soon.” Coming back to stand bedside and holding John’s hand again.
Both men nod in unison, rising to their feet. “Okay” John starts, “Let’s get this thing done.” Sherlock lifts Rosie who gently places her hat on top of the snowman.
“I’d say a bloody footprint. Small, short person, it’s not that high on the wall.” I reach down and enlarge the picture a bit more “more than likely a woman from the size. Barefoot.” I glance down at Sherlock who is beaming up at me.
John walked away... more like marched away, extremely angry, fists clenched. I can tell he wants to punch someone or something. I’m glad it wasn’t me who made him that furious for a change. John has an impressive uppercut.
John frowns, “I’m not an escaped slave though… Hey, doesn’t Crawley run a bunch of newspapers and tabloids or something?”
Sherlock just hums in acknowledgement while examining the curtains and the windows behind them. “Lestrade, they broke the window to gain access to the house, there is blood on some of the glass.”
I shake my head to clear it a bit. “I hope you have lube in here somewhere Mr. Watson-Holmes because I want you to fuck me!” I growl in his ear, running my hand down to pinch his arse. With a smug grin he reaches over and grabs a tube out of his shaving kit. I should have known. “Do you hide that stuff everywhere?” I laugh out, as I turn on the shower and adjust the temperature.
“Okay, we need to process these until they become a coarse paste.” John informs Sherlock, pulling the recipe from memory. Sherlock happily plays with the food processor.
Afterwards we head over to Harrods to look for boots, jeans and casual wear. We start with shoes. Sherlock insists I find a better quality of dress shoe to go with my new suits. Kevin said we would need everyday trainers, hiking boots and more than likely wellingtons. I have my old combat boots that will work for hiking. Sherlock wants the Brunello Leather Walking Boots that cost more than what I made in a month but I am able to talk him into a pair of Timberland boots for less than half the cost. We each pick up a pair of Wellington Boots and trainers; mine a bit more practical in price than Sherlock. After shoes for us, we grab a couple sizes of trainers and rain boots for Rosie as she is growing.
Greg is bouncing Rosie on his knee, sitting on the other side of the table. I turn the statements so he can read them and point out the similarity between the victims. “In each robbery, the victims all had an exterminator over a couple days to a week before. The same exterminator, ‘Andy’s Hit-squad‘. Check out Andy and odds are you’ll find the jewellery.” Sherlock is beaming at me.
“I met him last week, not a psychopathic serial killer, seemed okay. He cares for her.” Sighing in contentment, snuggling next to John.
I could write novels with the words I could never before say to your gorgeous face. I wanted to write this so you would have something to remind you to never doubt my devotion to you ever again.
“Mycroft! I trust John, he doesn’t need to sign this… this… thing!” Sherlock is offended, he didn’t know.
“Yes Doctor. Will this hurt?” Sherlock moves smoothly into position, leaning over the table on his forearms, teasingly wiggling his bum. John spreads Sherlock’s legs a bit wider for better access.
He closes his eyes and pretends to sleep. He rubs the metal nametag on his own collar between his thumbs while trying to relax. He was having a dream of running under a moonlit sky following a tall pale man with curly hair and mercurial eyes. He knows the person in the dream, maybe if he concentrates, he’ll be able to remember their name. It would be nice to remember his own too, he’s been called ‘dog’ or ‘pet’ for far too long.
“After all this time you still surprise me John.” He has a large grin he reserves for only me. “Your room, you’ll be more comfortable there.”
John rose twenty minutes ago and took a long hot shower. From the sounds in the bathroom he is almost done. I pour boiling water into our new tea pot over a few bags of PG Tips. The last of the sausage Kevin made before he left is browned and keeping warm in the oven and I’ve put eggs in the pan to scramble.
I sit in the offered chair, Sherlock leans against the back to my right. It doesn’t take too long to tell my tale. To their credit both men cringe when I get to where Carlyle dislocates my shoulder. Sherlock gives a gentle squeeze to my right shoulder when I mention passing out and waking up in hospital. Greg blanches but keeps writing.
Mrs. Hudson pipes up “John dear, why don’t you let the Inspector and I get Rosie ready for her nap while you go and change? I’m sure we can manage.”
“No. You two have been behaving differently. You’re more assertive and now he’s wincing. I want to know what’s up dammit!” Greg waves his hand between us as he speaks.
I kiss him deeply with every word “Brilliant.” Kiss “Extraordinary.” Kiss “Amazing.” Kiss “Astounding.” Kiss “Fantastic.” Kiss “Wonderful” Kiss.
Pleased, Sherlock wants to start at the beginning. “Ask whatever you want John. Let us start simple. Harry is older and you two don’t get along?”
“Sherlock Holmes. Thank you for staying. You don’t know how boring this place is.” Holding John’s hand longer than is customary. “Afghanistan or Iraq?”
Picking up Rosie to feed her the bottle, taking a bite from his dish as well, “First she arrived drunk, not good. Then she disapproved of me, yet again… or maybe still?” Rosie started to fuss, Sherlock took a breath to calm down. Slowly, continuing in a softer voice, “Harry didn’t listen when John told her we are together; she thinks we’re still just flat mates.” Taking another calming breath, “She didn’t make it to his wedding to Mary. Couldn’t be bothered to show up for Rosie’s birth or christening. Today was the first time she saw her niece. She’s been more or less absent from his life since he was invalided home and then had the nerve to tell John he was an idiot for moving back in here.”
He gives me a quick look while we’re stopped. “I haven’t been on holiday since I was a teenager. Even then I was expected to learn something.” Watching the road once more as the car crept forward. “The summers I spent with my Grand’Mere I had to perfect my French, she refused to speak English.”
Lestrade enters the conversation again, “Molly has the latest two victims at Bart’s. They were found together, lifetime friends apparently. Shades of the killer cabbie case too, the bodies were found somewhere they’ve never been known to go to before. Neither man had the tell-tale marks of a habitual user. We didn’t find any needles or any other drug paraphernalia at the scene, their homes or where they worked.”
Sherlock’s fingers fly over the keyboard, “As I suspected, Sargent Nash is involved, he created the file. Not sure about Donovan yet… I’d like to speak with constable Sanders on his own, see if he remembers where they arrested John. His place was near Kenton.”
“I know, I know. While you’re there, see if there is a location between San Francisco and Boonville?” I try to distract him.
“Fine. Sherlock has the make, model and serial number just in case along with your names. We’ll let the Major know when we talk to him next.” John, is pulling out Captain Watson again. “Finish up what you need to do here, I need to get Sherlock to town to x-ray his wrist and we’re not leaving you lot here unsupervised.”
“Dogs, 2 apparently. America, Northern California. Says he bought an old hunting club from a family in Mendocino County a few years ago and has been living there ever since.”
The smug git. Instead of sucking on me again, he removes the rest of my clothing from the bottom up. I’m not opposed to begging at this point “Sherlock, please...” Sherlock removes the rest of his clothing, slowly as I become more unglued from the sight of him. He then takes my hand and leads me into the bathroom to the shower.
Four over brimming stockings were hung by the fire with care bearing the names of John, Sherlock, Rosie and Martha. Mrs. Hudson chose to stay at 221 for Christmas this year instead of traveling off to join her sister. She wanted a quiet Christmas, course with a four year old girl running around, how quiet could it be?
“Great idea John!” Sherlock kisses my cheek, I blush from the compliment and the public display of affection.
On either side of him, Lestrade and Sherlock turn and demand from Mike at the same time, “You know this man? Who is he?”
“You are always needed, at least by me” I declare as I start kissing my way down his throat. I kiss him lower and lower as I undo the buttons on his shirt. “Rosie will be asleep for at least two hours, whatever will we do with that time Mr. Holmes?” I moan while kissing my way down his chest.
On our way out the front door I can just hear Donovan exclaim from the top of the stairs, “Who would bring a baby to a crime scene anyway?” I hurry away before I return and punch her, I’ve never decked a woman before. It’s very tempting at the moment!
Sherlock, interrupting with a smile, carrying in crib parts, “We’ve worked it all out Mrs. Hudson, no need to worry.”
After spending a couple hours going over files and videos, agent Burton wonders looking around “Is there somewhere we can set up as a base? The hotel in town is too far away to be effective.”
Sherlock rises and grabs both of our phones from our coats and returns, handing me mine. “I’ll start with Angelo, I’m not sure how long the cake will take to complete. Then Jorge, he’ll need to know how much time he has” grinning at me.
“Almost done, last picture” this one is labelled ‘back porch/door’. There is an antique claw foot tub on the deck, it looks fully plumbed. “There is a tub, might be too cold to use it if all the firewood is any indication.” Sherlock states. “Hopefully the weather cooperates, it looks big enough for two…” he rises his eyebrows at me with a knowing smirk.
Sherlock mumbles while scrutinizing the picture “You contribute more than you realize John, don’t sell yourself short.” He gently swats my arm, pointing at something on the screen with the other. “What does that look like to you?”
“Nobody perfect… even you” mumbled, followed by a groan. John squints one eye open again, then the other; closes both with a moan. “Two” whispered through clenched teeth.
“Ask me again later.” Sherlock looks up at me, heartbroken. “I’m not saying ‘no’. I want to make sure it’s not the post coital hormones talking. In case you didn't know, I'm crazy about you, and I would be lying if I said that I could live this life without you. Even though I don't tell you all the time, you had my heart a long, long time ago. I will say ‘yes’ by the way.” I smile and kiss his head.
“Go home and think about your career Sargent Donovan. Anderson came around, I’m sure you can as well.” Turning to head into the house, calling out “Pederson, with me, Jameson man the tape.”
Sherlock probes “Did you talk to anyone while on base? Surely there are several who could benefit, if we were in London I could recommend a few of my homeless network.”
John was still wearing the awful hospital gown, the thing wasn’t even tied properly closed. Sherlock stills, staring, when John lets it drop to the floor in a heap. John squints up at him, “You’ve seen me naked before…”
Sherlock and I just finished an involved case for Lestrade. He called us in to help solve a series of locked room murders. It took 5 days and a chase across rooftops (again!) to catch our killer. He was rather determined not to go to jail but we nabbed him in the end. Thankfully neither of us were hurt apprehending our suspect. We gave our statements at NSY then headed home; 221B Baker Street.
I give her a half hug and a kiss on the cheek “We’re off to find disposable cameras for tomorrow. Everyone will be our photographers. There are a couple other items I need to pick up for the trip as well. Too much to do at once.” As I put Rosie into her pram, the shops I need are within walking distance.
Blushing a deeper shade of red, Lestrade whips his head around to stare, wide eyed, at Sherlock “What?”
“John, we can’t chase criminals into our old age. We have a several good years left to us, but yes, I would like to retire to the country. I have notes for a book on how I conduct my deductions. I thought we could both go and write. That and raise bees.” He says the last while rubbing the ring on my finger.
John answers while he carefully ties another stitch one handed with Sherlock’s assistance, “Not really a good idea to be that close to a patient.” Sherlock quirks an eyebrow at him with a grin as he snips the thread when and where John indicates. John doesn’t even try to argue, he knows when he’s beaten. “Guess I could ask Mike a favour, see if I can get a few supplies. Have him run the tests through his office.” They tie the last stich “Do you want to do it here at the hospital or at home.” John knew the answer before it fully left his mouth.
We’re late to the restaurant, but aren’t the last to arrive. Somehow we’ve beat Mycroft and Greg. Sherlock’s parents are waiting at the table for us and rise to greet us as we come near. Mummy Violet gives me a huge embrace “John, I’m so glad you two figured yourselves out. I’ve never seen my boy so happy before! That and I get something I’ve always wanted, a Grandchild! Sherlock told us of your generous offer to have him adopt your precious girl.” She takes Rosie out of my arms. Turns and gives Sherlock a one armed hug then sits bouncing Rosie on her knee. Both have big happy grins on their faces.
Greg sits up straight, indignant, “Of course I did, and I informed her in person myself. Even offered to drive her into town to see him.”
Sherlock must be tired as he doesn’t hesitate to kick off his slippers and climb into bed while removing his dressing gown, and settles in under the blankets. Cuddling next to John, arm flung over his hips. Sherlock lets out a contented sigh while closing his eyes. John kisses Sherlock’s forehead and shifts closer. Both relaxing into sleep quickly.
I place the crop beside the box on the table and pick up the cuffs. “Do you always need the crop when tied up? I can probably think of several ways to distract you without its use…” I know I have a smirk on my face, I can’t seem to help it.
John has Sherlock hold his jacket open while he onehandedly unbuttons the ripped and bloody shirt. Frowning he starts to clean the blood away from around the wound with his right hand, “You’ll need a few stitches for this. The A&E can see to it while I get treated.” Then asking the tech “Do you have pad we can put on this to keep it clean?”
Sherlock looks around for John again just as his fight takes a turn. Moose Muldoon picks John up, John manages to kick Moose hard in the groin as he’s lifted. Sherlock is too far away and can’t prevent Moose from throwing John, forcefully, against the brick wall of the alley. He watches in dismay as John hits the wall and then slowly slide down the wall, dazed. Moose advances toward John as Sherlock steps on something metallic.
“Thank you Sherlock. That was incredible, we’ll definitely have to do that again.” I know I have a sappy grin on my face.
I’m exhausted from the ups and downs of the night. I turn and see Sherlock waiting just inside the door for me. He locks the door after me, Mrs. Hudson has retired for the night already. Sherlock leans down and cups my cheek as he gives me a gentle kiss. “I believe we need to go to bed Doctor” He purrs in my ear.
“Why is Rosie crying?” Sherlock wonders looking up the stairs, John is working a short shift at the clinic but is expected home at any moment.
Lestrade comes over, putting away his phone, “I’ve called for an ambulance Sherlock. John’s strong, I’m sure he’ll be fine,” patting Sherlock reassuringly on the shoulder.
“So… you (cough) don’t mind then?” John questions nervously. Giving Sherlock’s hand a gentle squeeze, receiving one in return.
“I believe Doctor Watson has specified that the light bothers him. It will be kept off until it no longer does. Are we clear?” commanded, Mycroft stares her down.
John looks around at the flat, it’s still clean. With nothing else to do he’s been tidying up after Sherlock and Rosie daily. That and they baked a couple batches of biscuits together yesterday. “Would they object to coming up here Mrs. H? I’d rather not be too far from Rosie in case she needs me.”
Agent Kreisler takes over and leads the sheriff and his helper into the shed. There is an exclamation of “Damn. Good shot!” when the bag is opened to reveal the body within.
Doctor Barnes snaps her gaze to Mycroft, “Doctor Mark Jacobs? How did you convince him to come here?”
“John, ever since Sherlock’s been back from the dead, you’ve been absent more than you’ve been here. Dr. Gil Vega has been filling in for you. He would like more hours, I’m seriously considering giving him yours.” Sarah slightly annoyed accosts him.
Running her empty hand up John’s right thigh, “Maybe we should get you naked, give your boyfriend one last look.” Cupping John’s crotch, “Oh, nice” running her hand around to tightly squeeze his right butt cheek. With the hand holding the knife she slices the button from John’s jeans off, nicking him just above his belly button with the sharp tip of the blade. “Not going to say anything? Pity, I enjoy it when they scream.” Roberta pouts.
A week later we spent a night in San Francisco. It felt odd being in a city full of people and all their noise after the quiet of the backwoods for over a month. Sherlock seems okay with the hustle and bustle, though he seems to be on extra high alert for any potential threats. I keep jumping at the odd noise, I guess my PTSD has resurfaced again. Joy.
I look around for Greg and Sherlock and see them and Molly at the far side of the chairs. As everyone grabs a seat Greg quickly strolls down to where I’m standing by Mycroft. “Looks like you’re the groom again after all John!” poking me with his elbow as he quietly jokes stopping beside me, Mycroft frowns at him.
It’s been nearly two weeks since the consulting detective Sherlock Holmes had jumped off the roof of St. Bartholomew’s Hospital. Dr. John Watson is still trying to make sense of all that happened. Sherlock’s funeral was only two days ago but it felt as though years have already passed. Mycroft couldn’t even be bothered to show up for his own brother’s interment. John is still in a state of shock. Mrs. Hudson and Molly Hooper keep bursting into tears every time they see John. It is all John can do not to punch Greg Lestrade whenever he stops by.
“I’ll go” Sherlock offers, kissing the top of John’s head. Disengaging reluctantly from John’s hug, Sherlock takes off his coat and scarf, throws them over the banister before disappearing upstairs.
Another nurse comes in with a catheter, I think ‘John is not going to be happy’. She starts to undo John’s jeans, he’s mumbling again. I lean in to hear him better “I can pee in a jar, I’m not that far gone.”
“I am being reasonable, if not their bodies would be rotting out at the gate!” Sherlock growls in answer. The three agents pale as they listen to the men argue. “Someone is threatening my family, dammit! We’re on holiday for fucks sake!” Throwing his hands in the air. Starts to pace. Stops. Takes a calming breath while returning to John’s side. “John, you have tactical experience, what do you think of their inept plan?” waving at the documents and map laid out on the table.
Dean Martin was singing ‘Deck The Halls’ lowly through the speaker on a laptop sitting in an overstuffed red chair in front of the fireplace. There was a fire cheerily burning in the fireplace to chase away the chill from the room. Stockings were hung from the scarred mantle with care, a mantle also holding a skull wearing a red Santa hat. Next to the capped skull on the mantle a few holiday cards are displayed along with a few crackers awaiting Christmas Eve supper.
I break off a piece of the second sandwich and place it on his lips “Open up.” He takes it, chews and swallows.
“Um, okay. You going to go to my barber?” frowning, a bit confused, picking up his phone to text Molly.
Kevin is oblivious or just doesn’t care “Okay. Any who, when you’re ready Three Continents Watson let me know. I’ll be out cleaning the kennel.” He leaves without touching any of the food on his plate.
Sherlock tightens his grip on my hand. “I won’t have you die on my account, I would be lost without you John.”
“John, I trust you. We can go as slow as you need but I require release before I can relax enough to sleep.”
“Just relax Mr. Holmes. That’s excellent Mr. Holmes, in a moment I’ll touch your prostate. Please try not to move around too much.” Looking up, John notices that Sherlock has a white knuckle grip on the edges of the table. He feels Sherlock slowly relax around his finger.
“It would be my pleasure brother mine.” Mycroft steps further into the room to the second chair in the room and sits, umbrella across his lap, phone in hand
After taking off his coat, scarf and toeing off his shoes, Sherlock glances at John while grabbing the baby monitor off the coffee table before heading into the kitchen. “John made the blanket, his therapist suggested it to help manage his anger. Not sure how well that worked out as he swore like a merchant sailor several times while making it.” Sherlock places the monitor on the kitchen table, lowering the volume. Turning he fills the kettle and sets it to heat before grabbing three mugs from the cupboard.
“She was an ex-CIA operative gone rouge with three others freelancing their way around the world. Their last job, for the British government went bad. Very bad.
I lower his legs while gently massaging them. “Gorgeous boy, so responsive. I’m going to take such good care of you love. Don’t worry, you’re going to feel so nice.” I lean down and take his leaking cock into my mouth again as I slip a finger back in to find his prostate. I run my other hand over my own aching erection. I continue lightly sucking, licking and kissing Sherlock’s cock, rubbing his prostate while stroking myself. I feel myself getting closer to my own release. I pull Sherlock as far into my mouth as I can, swallowing around the tip of his copiously leaking cock.
Sherlock is sprinkling sugar on top of the last scone as Kevin comes around the corner. “Thanks for splitting the firewood, that’s a very nice surprise!” Kevin declares.
“DONOVAN!” Lestrade barks “Go home, I’ve warned you enough! How many times are you going to have to attend ‘sensitivity training’ until it clicks?” She’s just standing there agape, “Move! Now!”
Smiling, “That settles it then.” Kissing Sherlock again, “Mike is going to take my stiches out tomorrow.” Dancing his left eyebrow, flirting.
After the pyramids arrived models of the Taj Mahal followed by St Peters Cathedral then the Colosseum in Rome were sent. The most any box contained was a small Great Wall from China as well as a tiny scale replica of a terracotta warrior and a box of loose leaf black tea. The box from Japan held a beautiful dark haired geisha doll with blue-green eyes, high cheekbones and a fancy tin of Macha Green Tea. John left the teas in their shipping boxes, not trusting who sent them or where they came from. After all, he was not informed that Jim Moriarty had shot himself on the day Sherlock jumped.
Several strands of twinkle lights were in an impressive knot on the coffee table awaiting further attention. On the sofa were several boxes filled with shining glass balls and additional garlands in silver, gold and green.
“While waiting, I heard a noise behind me. When I turned, a man I didn’t know attempted to punch me. As a former member of the RAMC I am well capable of defending myself, and I did just so. I was able to block the first punch and returned one of my own, knocking down the assailant. That is when I spotted another man coming toward our position.
Smiling “Figured I’d give you your physical today. Blood draw should be taken after at least a 12-hour fast. You didn’t eat or have coffee or tea during this case, I’m going to take advantage of it.”
“Yeah, but he stopped around that first Christmas… I didn’t notice it right away. I do know, every time you had a pub night after that, John came home smelling of beer and sex.”
“I didn’t want an Alpha telling me what to do. Not allowing me to work, forcing me to stay home and tend the house… keep me barefoot and pregnant.” The last bit spit out in frustration.
Just then the door bangs open and the lights flicked back on by the Doctor followed by a pair of nurses, one male (Karl) the other having been the woman who checked a few moments before (Sandy). Behind them is Mycroft carrying a small suitcase in one hand, his umbrella in the other.
“Thanks Mike.” As Doctor Stamford walks out, John looks at Sherlock with one eye and pats the bed next to him, “Sherlock, you look exhausted. Lay next to me and try to get some sleep.” Yawns.
A bit exasperated, “The main food word I know in French is flambé, not much help with this.” Shaking the menu once in frustration.
After John is released the next day we pick up some fresh vegetables and more food for Rosie at the local Safeway since we’re in town. The checker tells us to go to Walmart the next time we need baby food as there is a better selection and price over there.
Frowning, still bobbing an ever drowsier Rosie in his arms. “Did I hear the vacuum while we were downstairs? It will all be dusty again by the time we return in a month, I don’t know why you’re bothering.”
Sherlock straightens up and I can tell he’s about to lay into Kevin. I still have his hand in mine and give it a squeeze until he looks at me. It amazes me how we can have a conversation without saying a word. I’m ordering no, he’s pleading yes, and somehow I win. It only takes a moment. Kevin is oblivious of just how close he came to being verbally eviscerated.
Meanwhile in the kitchen, Rosie is full and being burped by an extremely annoyed Sherlock who had sworn to be on his best behaviour.
“Thanks.” I cup his cheek in my hand and give him a chaste kiss. “I’ll be back to inspect your work in an hour then.”
They’ve spent a few pleasant days hanging out with Kevin, catching up and coming up with further ideas to attract veterans to the property. All three men have added to the collection of quail in Kevin’s freezer even while eating some along the way.
“As long as we’re there by October 1st either option is fine with me.” I can’t help the smile on my face. A holiday with Sherlock. This could be the best or worst thing we’ve ever done together.
When Greg returns he finds a freshly showered and shaved Sherlock, dressed in slacks and a white button down shirt, sleeves rolled up, in the kitchen pouring flour into a food processor. “Experiment?” he inquires while handing Sherlock his cup of coffee.
Mumbled, “Okay, I’m coming…” louder, “See if Mrs. Hudson can look after Rosie.” John calls down the stairs while putting on his shoes.
Kevin picks up the tale “Now that was a mucked up operation if I ever saw one! Our troops kept having skirmishes in the area they sent you Brits, it was far from secure. When we found you, you were pretty out of it. Your wounds were infected and you were delirious. The scum tortured you and Bill, but you were the worse off. Billy boy was able to walk out on his own two feet with support. We had to carry you out on a stretcher, our medic wasn’t sure you’d survive long enough to get back to base camp. Apparently you died for a minute during the first operation.”
Before he can get too far, I call up my inner Captain “Sherlock”. He stops, straitens and takes a step back. Greg looks back and forth between us. “Is that all you need from us Greg?” I ask, motioning Sherlock toward the door. “We have a date in the park planned with Rosie if we’re through.”
I head back to the lounge with my cooling tea and an icepack. I’m mortified for having hit Sherlock so hard with the crop. Fuck, between pain and guilt I can’t relax. I hear an odd noise from the bathroom… and again.
I fill a glass with water, take my half pill and sit on the other side of Rosie. “I’ll finish here if you want to go back up to bed. My shoulder will keep me awake until the hydrocodone takes effect.” I reach over to take the spoon but Sherlock keeps it.
John swallows, wincing in discomfort, before speaking low, “Yeah, didn’t feel all that well. Got a call from the day care just as I finished my last scheduled patient for the day. Told Sarah I had to leave early because of both myself and Rosie.” John had been rubbing his left thumb in a soothing circle on Rosie back as she sleeps. “She was asking for ‘Papa’ when I picked her up.” His right arm is arched over the top of his head, fingers brushing the pillows usually at the other end of the couch.
“You do realize there is a lot I don’t know about you either. All I’ve learned is what little you and Greg were willing to share, which isn’t much.” I feel him tense again “It’s okay if we have secrets from one another, so long as those secrets are not harmful. But saying that, I will tell you whatever you want to know about me. If it is any consolation, you are the first man I trusted enough to bottom for; I only allowed fingers before. Good and bad, you’re stuck with me, I’m not going anywhere.”
He feeds Rosie another drizzle of soup then takes a spoonful for himself. “I know why she’s eating this, it’s much better than the can stuff we usually eat.” He says as he steals one of my croutons.
“I guess looks can be deceiving. That has the appearance of a fancy hotel, it’s a beautiful location.” Still looking, now seeing the signs stating Sherlock was correct.
Sherlock comes back out into the lounge, “Did you take anything for your fevers?” Lightly blushing but ignoring John’s statement.
As the boys finish eating, Doctor Mike Stamford comes in. “Hey Sherlock. John. I ran into Doc Murray downstairs, he was on when you came into the A&E John. He’s glad you’re conscious, wants to offer you a job. Apparently Doctor Elias Quincy has decided to retire at the end of the fall term this year, we’ll need a new forensic pathology professor.”
I groan when I finally open my eyes a couple minutes later. My vision a bit blurry with a headache behind it. Next thing I know I’m gently rolled onto my stomach as Sherlock starts to massage my neck and shoulders. “Mmm, feels good babe.”
“I think we have decaf.” I take out a pill, split it and leave half out. I put the closed bottle in the pocket of my dressing gown. “Remind where they are if I forget later.”
Lestrade returns later that afternoon, coming up the stairs and through the closed but unlocked door to the flat he spots Sherlock working at the desk by the window, papers strewn all around him on the desk and a few on the floor. John is stretched out on the couch on his right side, covered by a crocheted throw Mrs. Hudson made for Sherlock last Christmas. There is a fire burning merrily in the fireplace taking the chill off of the room.
Sherlock closes the door on his way in. He walks up behind me at the desk and hugs me from behind kissing my neck as he rubs his hands across my chest. I tilt my head to give him better access and lean into him. I reach back and start to rub my hands on his hips, slowly working my way to his belt buckle. He gently turns me around as he kisses my neck, running his hands down to my arse, giving it a gentle squeeze.
Sherlock has Rosie in a harness strapped to his chest. He smiles at Mrs. H “See, all set then. We’ll be back then head out to dinner together around half six.” Sherlock gives her a quick half hug and a peck on the cheek then heads for the door, I follow him out. He hails a cab seemingly out of thin air and we head off.
“Good, ok.” I reach into the box and pull out what looks like a bit in leather. “Is this a bit?” I ask with a raised eyebrow.
“The police are getting rather lax of late.” Sherlock adds in, trying desperately to hide a smile, ending up taking a sip from his cup of tea.
Lestrade’s gym clothes are swimming on John, making him look small and frail. Thankfully the sweatpants legs have elastic at the bottom and a tie at the waist to keep them up. John hissed as the shirt was eased over the sores on his back. They don’t have shoes, but that can be remedied later. Sherlock helps guide a limping, sock footed John out to Lestrade’s car. Sherlock sits in the back with John as the man hissed in pain again as he carefully sat down. After fastening John’s as well as his own seatbelts he places the biscuits in John’s right hand. “Here, you look as though you haven’t eaten much for a few days.” Then unfastens the leather collar arounds John’s neck, throwing it onto the front passenger seat with a look of disgust.
I hear Greg “…took them long enough to find out they were in love with one another. Thought there wasn’t a chance after Mary.”
Sherlock crawls across the floor and opens the box, he then sits back on his heels. I want to have this conversation on even ground. “Come. Sit here.” I pat the couch next to me. As he sits next to me I pick up the crop. “How do you want this used on you? Do you expect me to draw blood? I don’t want to leave permanent marks, you have enough as it is from your ‘hiatus’.”
My brain comes back online as she is putting a bandage on Johns arm “Rosie is Johns daughter, she has none of my DNA.” I blurt it out rather brusquely.
“At least you knew I was alive! I thought you threw yourself off a building because no one believed in you.” More tears, “You jumped before I could tell you how much I” sniffle, “I loved you! Do you know how much that hurt? I couldn’t stop the man I loved from jumping…” choked sob, “I still have nightmares about it.”
There are hardly any buyers left when the blond man is led limping his way onto the rotating platform, hands cuffed behind him. The man looks as though he has lost quite a bit of weight recently. From their front row seats Sherlock and Lestrade both gasp in horror at the numerous bruises as well as the multiple whip marks crisscrossed on the man’s back become evident as the platform turns, along with raw marks around wrists and ankles. The bruising on his right knuckles suggest he punched someone or something quite recently.
John grins up at Sherlock’s scowl. “Oh, hey! Guess I forgot the time, sorry. I got involved in my project.” Holding up the yarn square in his lap. “Mrs. Parker lent me a crochet hook to play with.”
Another dweller in the household was stretched out on a rug in front of the fire soaking up as much of the warmth his little body would allow. The puppy, an Irish Setter wearing a red bow as a collar, was literally dog-tired from a long day of playing around in the snow with two men with silver in their hair.
Kevin climbs out the back. “While I was sulking up here earlier I put out new targets at 15, 50, and 100-yards. Figure we can start with pistols and work our way out from there.” He reaches in for the soft and solid side cases walking over to a bench under a small roof. Kevin opens the solid case to reveal two pistols. “These are both 45 semi-automatics. I know John shot one in the army and Sherlock said he was proficient.” Kevin looks up hopeful he made the correct decision.
“Robert shoot Dr. Watson if this one doesn’t cooperate, start with his right knee.” Roberta King instructs her brother. Standing 5 feet 7 inches tall, and athletically built with pale skin and dark hair and eyes, this woman has a murderous feel about her. Her brother is taller but has the same long, dark brown hair and colouring as his sister, he is just as cold and calculating as she.
“I’m only going to have just the one beer” holding the bottle up. “I actually came over tonight to see if you two wanted to go out for a pint… Out of curiosity, how long does it take John to recover from a headache?” Greg wonders.
Miss Diana O (Last name withheld to protect the innocent) came to us with an interesting issue. A problem that was convoluted and complicated by the laws of the land. Her aunt has beginning stages of dementia and was being taken care of by her selfish, abusive, manipulating granddaughter. Sherlock wasn’t sure we were going to be able to take the case at all until we did a quick observation. After following the aunt and her granddaughter for less than a half an hour Sherlock was furious and I wasn’t too far behind myself.
Sherlock grimaces as he pulls the covers up. “Ug that worked Sir.” He shudders, and looks at me hesitantly.
“John, Mycroft sent over Mary’s file. You probably shouldn’t read it.” There’s a thick folder on the kitchen table between them.
It does sound nice, “Right. You’re right.” I finally give in and rubbing my temple text Molly slowly left handed.
I smile back and I take a sip of my tea “You’re welcome. I was thinking, today I would like for you to think of five things you would like as a reward and five for punishment while we are out. When we get back write them down for me. I’ll do the same and see if we come up with anything similar and examine our lists together later. Agreeable?”
“I’m sure Greg would appreciate it. Maybe we can hook him up with Molly, they’re both single.” I add.
“Luke Bryan dear, if you like him you’ll just love Vince Gill, his CD is up next.” Violet informs John.
“Good, rather not do something that could kill you if you don’t mind. I read about ‘wax play’ online, watched a couple videos. There are candles that have a wax that melts at a lower temperature than the average candle. It looked like it would be interesting to try.”
Sherlock looks affronted at this. “I can watch over John and take care of Rosie myself Mycroft. If I need any assistance there is always Mrs. Hudson.”
John teasing, “Hey, that’s mine line!” opening the refrigerator again to remove carrots, celery and the ground beef. “Grab an onion and the garlic.” Pointing. “Were did we store the food processor?” glancing around, trying not to move too quickly.
Sherlock backs up to where a road forked off to the cabin. He drives up without complaint from Kevin. We find an old A-frame house with an open garage behind. The garage is half full of split firewood. A pair of old white toilets sit on either side of the door with ferns growing out of the bowls. There is a sign over the front door ‘The Dear Den’. “Quaint” Sherlock remarks.
“Hey Molly, I got your text. What’s up?” John announces walking through the door to the morgue at St. Bart’s Hospital.
The man, Lestrade, replies just as low, but without the growl, “Your brother insisted I come here and keep you company. He doesn’t like you being in here by yourself.” Looking at the catalogue and the numbered paddle on the table, “You here to buy someone Sherlock? Didn’t think you approved of slaves.” Voice still low.
I was feeling a bit nostalgic, I had the stereo volume up as I danced along with tunes from when I was a teenager. I had the music up too loud and I failed to hear Sherlock enter and climb the steps. I’d been dancing along while dusting the bookshelves to Michael Jackson’s ‘Beat It’, when the song ends I hear clapping from the doorway.
Between Martha Hudson and young Rosie the thermostat was set at, to Sherlock, a balmy 75. John was happy with the added warmth in the building as his damaged shoulder didn’t ache quite as much. That and the new windows and insulation installed after what they now referred to as the ‘Euros incident helped to keep the usual drafts at bay in the old building.
“I know what you mean. Mrs. Turner and I bet who would pay for the next holiday, I won of course.” Mrs. H sounds proud over the speaker. “You go on dear, I can finish up in here. You and John have a big day in front of you.”
“I’m Sherlock Holmes, our driver here is Detective Inspector Lestrade of New Scotland Yard.” Sherlock offers.
Sherlock drops so quickly he must have bruised his knees. He takes my tumescence in hand and gently runs his fingers up the underside and over the tip. I bite back a moan. His fingers are followed by his tongue. I can’t supress the moan of pleasure this time. He smiles up at me then takes me into his mouth and sucks, hard, flicking his tongue over the slit. My knees feel weak, I lock them so I don’t fall and reach my right hand to brace against the wall.
I lean over “John!” I cup his cheek. “John, can you hear me?” His eyes crack open “What do you keep saying?”
It has been four days of running all over London, on hardly any sleep or food for either man. Sherlock left John to watch for their murder suspect from an alley across from the front of the building, feeling it was the safer of the locations, as he took off to stakeout the rear. Little did our watchers know, but they were being watched as well.
Sherlock snorts while pushing away his own half-eaten plate of food. “Never ask that, it only brings trouble.”
I search the bag Kevin left and find ammunition to reload our empty clips while he readies the next firearms. Kevin comes back with a riffle slung over each shoulder and a shotgun in each hand. Looking like he’s ready for battle. There is a rack built onto the side of the bench the cases are on, Kevin places a firearm in each notch.
I go through the RSVP list in my head “Um, ah, 15 with Sherlock, Rosie and I. The three of us don’t need favours though so 12 if you don’t have a date. Molly is coming by herself.”
Sherlock asks “Kevin, would it be alright if I were to teach John how to drive a stick while we’re here?” I look at him, when am I ever going to drive a stick?
The small hand hovers before selecting what looks like the largest treat. “Ta Daddy. Can I take one to Papa?”
“Thankfully, no. Bruising on my bad shoulder, hurts like hell.” I grimace as I try to put my coat on, Sherlock is at my side in an instant helping me. “Thanks” He just nods back, not looking at me.
From just outside the door, Greg pulls out his notebook and starts reading, “This is the homeowner, Leland Smith, 56. His wife, Shannon, found him an hour ago. She is in the kitchen with the paramedics at the moment. She was with their daughter and their new grandchild last night. Mrs. Smith stated she talked to her husband on the phone around 9pm last night. She’s a bit too distraught to remember everything that was taken but her jewellery box is empty as is the safe in the husbands study.”
“How could I stay with her when I loved him more? I wouldn’t trade Rosie for anything in the world, but while she was gestating I resented her existence. I couldn’t abandon my kid like that!
Tugging down his top trying to stretch it lower, “This set up is giving all proceeds to charity and someone is taking a bit off the top. Quite a bit as a matter of fact.”
“Hey,” John huffs over the backseat, unfastening Rosie from her carrier, “The Beatles are not abysmal!”
There are several police cars and an ambulance with their lights flashing in front of a building halfway down the block when the black sedan rounds the corner onto Baker Street. Sherlock barely allowed the vehicle to come to a full stop before disembarking and running through the open door and into the building.
Okay, I can do this. “You know I’ve loved you for a long time, almost since day one. I came back because any life with you would be better than one without you. Even if you didn’t feel the same, it would have been worth it to me.” I can feel his smile growing on my skin. “Not sure what I would have done if you didn’t want me around. Can we sleep go to now love?”
I’m giggling going inside, Sherlock on my tail. He quickly finds the biscuits, I cut up a couple of apples and take assorted lunch meats and cheeses out of the refrigerator. We have a lovely, relaxing snack, both switch to drinking water when we finish the orange juice. Toward the end Rosie wakes and I go and get her, grabbing a jar of food and a spoon on my way back.
Sherlock slumps next to John, “I’ve never had a successful relationship” he softly admits in defeat.
“John is my husband, this is our daughter.” The CCTV camera in the corner is watching us. Before the end of my statement the fax behind the nurses’ station jumps to life again.
“In an 8-quart non-stick saucepan combine 4 cups flour, 2-1/4—2-1/2 cups warm water, 1 tablespoon salt, 1 package yeast; mix well, let rise till doubled. Stir and place in fridge overnight. Bake in the pan at 475 for 35-45 minutes in the morning. Most of the time I mix it in the morning and bake it after lunch, no fridge time. I started this loaf earlier, I didn’t sleep well last night.
John helps Sherlock rise and they go into the house to soothe Rosie and the dogs. They leave Parks to deal with freeing Kreisler for the time being.
“Hmmm. Good crunch, lovely gingery flavour. I approve. Did you two pick a house style yet?” looking at the cut pieces laying on the kitchen table, trying to figure it out.
“We will see.” Mycroft gets up and starts to leave, freezes, as he stares into the kitchen. The crop is still on the table where I left it last night. Shit! He turns to look at me again, thankfully I had just enough time to conceal my reaction.
Sherlock stops pacing when he next drifts near John. John brings Sherlock in closer for a reassuring hug and pep talk. “We’ll get through this, we always do. We work together on this though, no going off on your own. I’ll grab more ammunition, we go armed until this is finished.”
Sherlock catches up to me when I reach the top of the rise, I wait for him at a fairly level spot. I must have made quite the impression when I left. Sherlock gives me a sheepish smile, taking Rosie from Kevin who hustles into the back faster than I’ve ever seen him move before.
“Yeah, but you should probably come to Baker Street earlier to change. Mycroft is going to help Sherlock dress, we figured Molly couldn’t handle that. Molly will get ready downstairs at Mrs Hudson’s. We can walk over to the park when we’re ready, I’ll bring Rosie in her pram in case she needs to nap before it’s all over. Molly and Mrs. Hudson are having a girl’s night with Rosie after as well so Sherlock and I will have 221 to ourselves.” I blush at the last bit.
Sherlock flips the lid on the toilet down and places a folded towel on top as a cushion “Here is good.”
When done Sherlock turns off the water and grabs a towel to start drying me off. He gently pats my left shoulder and allows me to move my arm as he dries it. When I’m dried off he wraps the damp towel around my waist. He helps me back into the brace to keep the injured shoulder immobilized. He looks like he is as hard as I am as he grabs a dry towel for himself.
As I sit and take a sip I start. “Sherlock, I need to tell you something. You know how hard it is for me to say things like this…” I sit back in my chair and close my eyes for a moment and begin again. Sherlock is looking intently at me.
I take a calming breath. “No… you go on. Investigate. It’s fine, good. We’ll be outside.” He wants to investigate but he wants to be with us, I can tell from his body language. “Stay, we’ll be just outside. We won’t leave without you. Promise.” I give him a quick kiss on the cheek, squeeze his hand and leave.
Lestrade watches the exchange. “Alright, what’s going on with you two? You’ve been acting strange for a couple weeks now!” He demands.
Sherlock closes his eyes and takes a deep breath. He gazes into my eyes “Thank you John. I regret I faked my suicide in front of you and that it took so long to come back.” The previous tension leaves to be replaced with a different variety.
Quick laugh, “I was an adrenaline junkie even back then. I played Rugby with a drop-in team during Med School. At one of the games a nursing student mentioned they signed up; the corps would pay for their schooling. My scholarships covered a lot but I still owed quite a lot. Bill Murray took me to the recruiting officer he went through, we both had a year left to finish. Bill and I ended up going through boot-camp together that summer break. The RAMC kept us together when we deployed, we were a good team. He left the army shortly after I was discharged.”
Sherlock is filling the kettle at the sink as I reply “Sherlock is making dinner for us tonight, hopefully you like Bolognese. I made an apple pie earlier.” Pointing at the counter where the pie was cooling. “We just popped a batch of scones in the oven. You’re just in time for tea.”
They had even discussed when and where they wanted to retire. Tending bees on a farm in Sussex near the ocean is sounding better and better every passing minute to John as he wears a path in the linoleum in the too bright waiting room.
“Just this last bit by the door. I started with the toilet, sink and shower then the floor Sir.” He says demurely.
Blushing, Sherlock grabs his washbag and change of clothes and heads into the bathroom, closing the door behind him.
From the floor in the lounge, Sherlock and John hear the kettle beep, Greg cough, and water pouring. Greg’s still somewhat raspy voice calls out “I’ll just make the tea then, you two relax.”
The goon, Carlyle is built along the lines of a gorilla – large and all muscle. He aims his first blow to land on the scar on my left shoulder, I can’t help but groan in pain. Around the fifth punch I feel a pop as my shoulder dislocates. I can hear someone scream in agony and I’m afraid it might be me. A few blows later everything goes blissfully black again as I pass out.
John starts off by giving Sherlock a kiss on the lips, trying to put as much feeling as he can into it. Staring into Sherlock’s eyes John states firmly, “Sherlock, I love you, I’m not going anywhere. I am here for as long as you will have me.”
Kevin looks at me and I give him a wave to go ahead and answer “John patched me up when I was shot in a skirmish in Helmand.”
I look at my own fingernails, seeing a few ‘clouds’ but not as pronounced, I had abdominal cramps the other day. Looking back at him, “I believe we’ll need to be tested for Arsenic poisoning Sherlock.” I pronounce much calmer than I feel. “Your symptoms seem to be further along than mine…”
The main job I had was to find the fastest internet service and ‘demand’ they install it immediately. If you’re reading this I was successful.
“I’m coming in Sherlock” and follow words with action. Sherlock is sitting hunched over on the floor, the scent of bile is strong. As I take a step in the door, Sherlock rises, unsteadily to his knees to vomit into the toilet. “Ah, you’re sick I see. How long have you been feeling like this then?” I ask, rubbing Sherlock between his shoulder blades.
On the way out, I notice a box next to the tub, ‘Mr Heater’, with a couple small propane bottles on top. There are a few candles that were not there yesterday as well. Maybe Sherlock and were not as quiet as we thought last night, oops!
“After you came back I was a right bastard. I was so happy you were alive but so angry that you lied to me and led me to believe you had killed yourself. I feel horrible knowing I knocked you onto your healing scars. By this time I had met Mary, it was a whirlwind thing that really should not have lasted as long as it did. I just got swept along. She was tenacious and never let go, changing the subject when I started to talk to her about ending it. Nothing compares to you; it wasn’t fair to marry her when I loved you more.  It really hit home at the wedding reception during your best-man speech. You did care for me, I was just too blind to see before it was too late.”
The only bruising both men were currently sporting were inflicted, accidently, to one another, while being intimate. Just yesterday they wrapped up an embezzlement case for a well to do private client who paid them more than requested as a thank you for such a quick solution to his problem. They celebrated well into the night. As such, John was a bit stiff and sore and decided to take a hot bath this morning and relax.
A collared server came by and took his order, bringing a tray holding pot of tea and a pair of clean, but well used cups back a few minutes later. The man slowly flips the pages in the catalogue while absently tapping the fingers of his left hand on the table. He pauses and frowns at a few of the photos before flipping on to the next page, stopping at a picture of a clean shaven, blond man with fierce, dark blue eyes.
I’m careful to keep my left arm still as I sit. Can’t help but feel a bit aroused and nervous all at once. I completely trust Sherlock, but I’ve never let anyone else shave me while conscious before. Sherlock wets down a flannel with hot water, wrings it out then places it over my whiskers. Hot but it feels good so far. “Leave that on for a bit, it will soften the whiskers sir.”
“Interesting. So, you and your brothers do what exactly? Travel around the globe and collect items for this Japanese fellow.” Sherlock continues in a bored tone.
John hands Sherlock the check over his shoulder and opens the papers. It lists, in detail, all of the items that were left at the townhouse and the price for each. There is also a list of several account numbers from banks from around the globe. John looks at Mycroft a bit confused.
I greet and thank everyone for coming, Sherlock following along with me; seemingly glued to my side, hand in mine or on my lower back. Angelo catches my eye after a bit and nods toward the main table. I take the hint and lead Sherlock over and guide us to our designated places. Molly is to Sherlock’s left, Mycroft, then his parents, Rosie in a high-chair between mummy Holmes and Mrs. Hudson then Angelo and his wife Nigella. To my right is Greg then Mike, his wife Lily then Bill and Judith.
I laugh “I’m sure I can keep this one occupied” bumping Sherlock’s shoulder gently with my own. Sherlock blushes.
“You’re buying Rosie a violin for Christmas? She’s only five Sherlock, isn’t she too young?” John wonders as they enter the music store.
“He was a surgeon, been teaching forensic pathology the last few years.” Sarah gives him a look, “Arthritis, hasn’t touched a scalpel to a live patient for several years apparently. They don’t need my hands, just my brain. It’s a done deal, I start in January.”
Doctor Barnes lifts an eyebrow at Sherlock, responds annoyed, “I was asking the patient.” Turning back to look at John, speaking to him as to a child, “Now Doctor Watson, how do you feel?”
Conceding with a small grin, “Well, maybe I’d want you to take easier cases while pregnant.” Then adds seriously, “Hell Sherlock, if it comes down to it, I’ll quit my job to stay home to tend house and raise our pups. I do most of the shopping, housework and cooking now as it is anyway.”
“Doctor Watson I have an inkling you might just have an idea.” Sherlock groans back at me, he lifts my chin to give me a kiss on the lips. We start off simple and sweet but things quickly heat up as we start unbuttoning one another’s clothes.
“I started a bank account for Rosie in May, her university fund… I. No. We don’t have to worry about it.” I kiss Sherlock. “I love you so much.”
Violet sits in the overstuffed chair across from them, Siger sits on the arm, leaning back toward his wife.
Since it was Saturday, we went the rest of the way into town. Sherlock had wanted to visit the John Hanes Fine Art Gallery, he did find a couple items that peaked his interest. The artists who contributed to the gallery are extremely talented. In the end we bought a bronze howling coyote pup Rosie was drawn to. We also purchased a ballerina figurine that reminded us both of a younger Mrs. Hudson.
“Y, yes sir. Are you sure you’re alright?” asked worriedly as he gently moves me back under the spray of water to rinse off.
Trembling, voice quaking, “Sir, Holmes used false information and paid for the man in cash. Cooper thought he recognized him but wanted to make sure of his suspicions were correct and had them followed to Baker Street.” she informs him.
Kneeling and taking one of Sherlock’s hands in both of his, “I want everything with you. I will gladly bond with you Sherlock, pups or no. I told you we needed to talk when your hormones weren’t raging. We had those cases for the week after, then you avoided me… all of this stress could have been avoided.” John assures.
