"Chief!" Lassie exclaimed at the same time Jules said, "But Chief-"
Dean rubbed his face with his hand and groaned. "Does he know what it is then?"
They arrived at the station and Shawn and Lassie rushed to the morgue while Gus stayed behind. When they got to the morgue,  Dean and Castiel were on the ground, both coughing up blood. Zachariah was in the middle of saying, “—you will say yes to Michael!”
"But Chief, I'm a professional too!" Shawn whined.
"Nah, Bigfoot's a hoax. Everyone who's anyone knows that," Dean answered.
"Yeah I'm gonna go now." He walked out.
“You say that as if you aren’t a human,” Gus commented.
Shawn put his finger to his temple and made a 'duh' expression. "Psychic, remember?"
Lassie's face went blank. "Oh."
"Why don't we see where it leads then?" Shawn asked as he stepped closer to Lassie.
Shawn could've sworn he saw Lassie's face turn the slightest shade of pink. His eyes darted around the room, avoiding Shawn's gaze.
"We could ask Crowley," he suggested.
Shawn clicked his tongue at Gus. "Same thing."
Zachariah frowned. “Fine. I’ll just have to erase your memories of ever being in this town. I’ll still be here of course, just under the guise of a stupid old coroner.” He looked down at his body in almost disgust.
“Well Dean seemed pretty sure that they were angels. I mean, isn’t Castiel also an angel? He wasn’t as mean as the others,” Shawn pointed out.
"At his desk, I assume. Why?"
"You two are anything
Jules nodded and picked up a pile of papers and started walking away, so Shawn followed her.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Oh, I got that part," Shawn said. "Nevermind. Listen, you two should come to the Psych office with me and Gus. We can watch Star Wars! Or Star Trek, if you're more into that."
“Yes! Okay? I do!”
"It was right next to your taffies," Shawn replied.
Shawn jogged over to Lassie's desk and slammed his hands down while grinning. "Lassieeee!"
“Weird.”
Carlton rolled his eyes and got out of the car without answering.
Dean intervened. "Okay," he dragged out the word. "Let's just get going and worry about food later."
“Is that a yes?”
"Is that the only reason you're here right now?" Dean responded. "To get me to say yes? Well it's not gonna happen, dick bag."
Chief glared at Lassie. "Show some respect, Detective. It's not often we get the FBI here."
Lisa's smile faltered slightly. "Feds? Are you here because of the break-in?"
“I don’t even know what those are,” Dean pointed out.
“I know how to get rid of Zachariah,” Lassie suddenly spoke up.
"Like...rotten eggs."
Shawn and Gus arrived at a crime scene at the same time as Juliet and Lassiter. Shawn immediately noticed that there were marks on the guy's neck, and he was very pale.
This time Sam spoke. "We're here to investigate the murder." He glanced at the dead body behind them, then back at Chief.
"Hm. Too bad," Dean said. "But she's not, so you gotta leave before you get yourselves killed."
“So, Cain, back to the main question. Why are you here?!” Zachariah shouted.
Cas looked away. "I don't know. I assume Zachariah must be letting the coroner take possession of the body sometimes. I'm not sure if we can do anything about it."
Sam stared at Dean for a second before settling back down in his seat. "Fine."
"Hey by the way, do you guys know the feds that showed up here a little while ago?" Lisa asked.
"Yeah, exactly. A better solution, not a crazy one." Sam shook his head and went back to scrolling through his laptop.
Cas suddenly had a silver blade in his hand, and Dean pulled an identical blade out of his jacket.
"Oh, perfect!" Shawn exclaimed. "Gus has a crucifix in his desk, and I still have some holy water blessed by Father Westley!"
Suddenly she gasped and slumped to the ground, revealing Dean standing there, cleaning off his dagger. "Yep. Good observation."
attitude up, you won't be considered one anymore."
"Thanks, Jules!"
"What are you doing here, Lassie?" Shawn asked.
The man’s hands tensed, and he looked behind Dean. Dean turned around, and there was another customer sitting close by. He looked back at Castiel, who said, “I don’t know anything about the Novaks.”
She turned back to the screen and did as he asked. Carlton watched the screen for what Shawn might've seen.
Realization spread over Sam's face, then dread. "Crap. Forgot about that."
"Have you noticed any weird smells since the break-in?" Dean asked suddenly.
Dean's gaze hardened. "I said let's go," he said more forcefully.
Comments and Kudos make my day!
Dean turned around. Castiel was standing with his arms folded over his chest. Dean noticed for the first time that the other man was wearing a beige sweater, which made him look a lot less threatening than he would assume someone involved in the mafia would look. It took him a second to realize Castiel was waiting for an answer, and not just standing there to look good.
"Great, so a sexy Sith Lord that drinks blood," Dean said. "How do we kill it?"
-Meanwhile in Santa Barbara-
"He's busy," Shawn said in a whiny voice. "He said he wouldn't go, even for Despereaux. Ha, that rhymed."
Lassie looked up and squinted. "Excuse me?"
“Ah, the fake psychic and his buddy, Ca—” he stopped himself, then continued, “the detective.”
They nodded.
"Wait," Sam said abruptly. "What if the coroner is Zachariah's vessel?"
Pierre Despereaux stood in his apartment, holding a bowl full of a suspicious dark red liquid. He seemed to be listening to something.
Gus stopped what he was doing and looked at Shawn. “What?”
Dean nodded. “Yeah, it was.”
"Despereaux's there!" Shawn exclaimed.
"Why? We get murders almost every week. This isn't new."
“Well, no,” Shawn conceded. Then his face lit up. “Even better! He’s in Las Vegas!”
They stood in an awkward silence for a few moments, before Shawn said, "So are you done packing?"
"Hi guys!" Shawn said. "Fancy seeing you here!"
(See the end of the chapter for
"What?" Dean said sharply. "How does he know?"
The shorter one spoke. "I'm FBI Agent Dean De Witt and this is my partner, Sam Zuckerman."
"Weird smells?"
"The man is an art thief!"
"And who are you to stop me?" Zach challenged. "You're just a fake psychic. You aren't even a hunter! After I kill Woody here, maybe I should take you up as a vessel. You seem strong enough to be one."
"Jules, what's going on? Why are there so many people here?"
She beamed and nodded. "Anytime!"
Shawn rolled his eyes. “Yeah, sure, whatever.”
For a brief moment, Dean wondered what it was like to have a bond like the one Shawn and Cain/Lassiter had. He had never realized he wanted a bond like that. He glanced at Cas, who wasn’t paying attention to him. He knew that 2014 him and 2014 Cas obviously had some sort of relationship that went beyond friendship, but he hadn’t realized until that moment that he had ever wanted that. But he did. He wanted it so bad. He wanted what Shawn and Lassiter had between them to be between him and Cas.
"Ma'am," Dean interjected. "We don't ask why our director sends us here, and we strongly suggest you don't either. Now. Is there anything strange about the murder?"
"Great!" Dean clapped his hands and smiled at Shawn and Lassiter. "Let's go, Sammy!"
"So, Dean-o. You ready to say yes to Michael yet?"
Gus was backing away, towards the door.
“I don’t want to be involved in this!” Gus said. “I never signed up to deal with angels!”
"Then let's go!" Shawn exclaimed. "Where do we find it?"
Carlton just shook his head and rolled his eyes as they followed Lisa. They finally stopped and went into a room where there were about eight monitors showing camera feeds.
They both walked into Lassie's place, and Shawn looked around. It was a nice house. The aesthetic was simple, yet elegant, just like Lassie himself. Shawn immediately spotted three guns hidden in different places. He was sure there were more, too.
"It's a pleasure to meet you, Lisa," Shawn said with a flirtatious smile. "I'm Shawn Spencer."
The blue-eyed man set Dean’s drink on the counter. “That’s gonna be two dollars and forty-five cents.”
Dean hung up. "Thanks. So, about the coroner. What do we even do with him? Assuming he is Zack's vessel, of course."
At that moment, five girls walked into the bar together. They were all wearing long, white dresses, so that their feet weren't showing. One had wavy black hair and bright blue eyes, and if Shawn was being honest with himself, he might've take note that she looked a lot like the female version of Lassie. She was very beautiful. The other four women were equally beautiful.
The passenger nodded. "Yeah, who would willingly go to McDonald's? Everyone knows that place is
Shawn and Gus looked at him in surprise.
"Soooo...." Shawn said. "Who are they?"
Chief Vick took a deep breath. "Guys. Woody is going to examine him as soon as we get the body to the office."
“Shawn!”
"Yep! I already asked earlier this morning." Shawn bounced on the balls of his feet.
Gus' eyes widened slightly before narrowing. "Vampires don't exist, Shawn."
Shawn didn't know how to respond. He eventually went with, "Uh...I...I feel the same."
"Who's the psychic? Anyone Dad might've known?"
“Good. I’m glad you’ll have a partner, since you can’t seem to function without one. Just one thing — while you’re with Lassie, make sure you get whatever’s going on between you two resolved.”
“I’m thinking werewolf, maybe.” Sam looked at Dean. “You okay?”
"No...Lassie she's just my friend. There's nothing more going on between us."
Lassie licked his lips, and Shawn glanced at them, then back up at his eyes. He could feel the taller man's breath on his lips, and the butterflies in him felt like they were trying to learn karate.
Shawn gave Carlton a wounded look. "I think I can decide who my friends are, thank you very much, and if you keep
Shawn raised an eyebrow. "You're smitten with him, aren't you? You two are lovers in the night!"
Shawn nodded. "The one and only!"
Chief nodded. "Meet us at the office in 15 minutes."
Castiel gritted his teeth. “Did you not hear me before? I said no one gets an audience with him except those people I listed.”
There was a whoosh, and suddenly Cas was standing in front of Dean. "I'm here."
Gus rolled his eyes. “We are not going to Las Vegas, Shawn.”
Dean shook his head. "No. Just the Psychic and Mr. Clean."
Lassie huffed and folded his arms across his chest. "Enough of your games, Spencer. The bite mark could've been from before he died."
Juliet shook her head. "Nevermind. Anyways, I'm really busy right now. Carlton should be by his desk."
"Uh-huh, sure. Lassie, you're in love with me!" Shawn grinned.
Someone cleared their throat, and Dean reluctantly stepped away from Cas, his eyes still closed and the taste of Cas’s lips still there.
Cas shook his head, silently dismissing the question. He raised his angel blade toward Zachariah. “Why is he here?” he demanded.
"Oh." Lassiter nodded as he took in the information. "Okay then. Still, can you stick around for a bit? Help out with a few more cases?"
"Hey, you asked for a better suggestion."
The man smiled briefly, and Dean blurted out, “By the way, do you think you could help me with something?”
"Shawn, you coming or what?" Gus interrupted his thoughts.
Sam went back to looking at his computer, and Dean sat on his bed, trying to remember. He knew it was going to bother him until he remembered what happened yesterday, but for the life of him, he couldn’t think of a single remarkable thing. That’s when Cas decided to show up.
"Spencer, not everything is about you!" Lassiter turned to Sam and Dean again while Gus just shook his head and left the Psych office. "Listen, I know you guys are probably busy, but would you mind staying around for a while?"
Dean groaned and Sam elbowed him.
Dean jumped slightly when he saw him.
"Listen here, chucklehead," Dean said as he shoved Shawn against a wall. "Stop pretending. We all know you aren't a psychic. If you were, you'd be able to tell us our real names. Now how did you get that information?" He shouted the last question.
Dean immediately recognized the woman at the front desk and his face paled.
Shawn hesitantly nodded.
Cas stood there with his usual serious expression. Dean's heart sped up slightly at the sight of the angel. He didn't know why, so he ignored it.
Gus joined them. "Can I go with you? I don't wanna have to deal with their tension."
"Well, maybe we should just go check it out ourselves instead of wasting time in this dump," Dean said as he finished his burger and stood up. The waiter that was walking past at that moment stopped briefly to glare at Dean before continuing in his path. Dean just winked at him.
"Why are we going to Las Vegas?" Lassie asked, exasperated.
Dean gave him a thumbs-up and stood from the counter. “It’s a date then!” He then promptly turned around and left the store. After he was already out the door, he realized he forgot the blue flower inside. He turned around to go back, but when he looked through the door window, he saw Castiel pick the flower up and give the smallest, softest smile Dean had ever seen. So Dean walked home without the flower.
That must bot have been the answer Lassiter was expecting. He turned around and faced Shawn. "You don't know that."
"Not a word. Either of you," Chief said to Lassie and Jules. They both fell silent, and she turned to Sam and Dean. "Get to work." She left the room, and Jules and Lassie followed.
Shawn ignored him and continued on. “Woody! Come on, please listen! You have to kick this guy out!”
She rolled her eyes. "They're from the bank. The vault was broken into last night, and they're blaming us for not stopping it."
“I’m just a soldier.”
Lassie whipped back around. "You could've told the truth, Shawn!"
"Hello, Dean," said a low voice behind Dean.
Lisa narrowed her eyes. "Is this a prank?"
Zachariah chuckled. “That’s not gonna work, Shawny boy. Right now, it’s like dear old Woody’s sleeping. He can’t hear you.”
Lassie rolled his eyes and led Sam and Dean to the body. "He was found this morning like this."
"Because you aren't trained in this type of stuff. It's our job to protect civilians, so I'm not gonna let you two get killed while you're trying to take out a vamp." Dean started walking out of the station, but Shawn and Gus followed him.
Her smile faded. "Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to offend you or anything—"
He was suddenly back in the morgue. Dean and Cas were now standing in front of him, all signs of blood gone. Woody was slumped against the wall, unconscious. Lassie was nowhere in sight. He could still feel something inside of him, and with all of his energy, he shoved it out of him. The blue light shot out of his mouth and back into Woody, and Woody suddenly woke and stood up.
Dean smiled back, but it didn't fully reach his eyes as he flashed his FBI badge. "I'm Agent Armstrong and this is my partner, Agent Thompson."
"Well, isn't there some sort of angel exorcism?" Dean asked.
"Hm." Dean set down his cheeseburger. "Let's go check it out then!"
Spencer cut in at that point with a cheeky grin. "Don't worry, he's not offended. He's just shocked you could tell that we're lovers in the night."
"So..." Shawn interrupted, dragging out the word. "While you two panic about...whatever you're panicking about, do you wanna at least do it in a place that's not a bar? And not surrounded by dead Siths?"
Carlton and Shawn shared an equally confused look before Carlton said, "We don't know any feds."
He paused. “Castiel.”
"Of course not!"
Sam raised an eyebrow at Dean, and Dean just shrugged.
"Shawn, they smell terrible and you always leave grease stains on our bills," Gus responded.
"Wait, vessel? What does that mean?" Gus asked.
Dean held out his arms. "So we can bring Cas! There were only three guys that were killed, so I'm sure it'd work."
“I haven’t found it yet. It would be nice if you could help, though.” He paused. “No, I was joking, of course I can find it on my own. Maybe I can even trick Shawn into helping me.” Another pause. “Yes, by the end of this week.” Pause. “As you wish. Goodbye, Crowley.”
"Dean!" Sam exclaimed. Dean shushed him.
Sam and Dean looked at each other and had what Shawn could only assume was a silent conversation.
"I was just seeing what you had about the case with the guy drained of his blood. I wanted in on it, especially if the feds were working it."
"Unless there are more, yes," Dean answered. He put his dagger away and went over to Castiel and Sam.
"That's not exactly how the spirit world works," Shawn said. "They don't just tell me who exactly everyone is. They tell me jumbled information. For example," he studied Dean. "You've been through a lot of trauma. You like cheeseburgers, and you had one earlier. You and Andre the Giant over there are brothers. You have not only a gun, but also a machete and a dagger. Nice hiding place for the dagger, by the way."
Dean woke up in the motel they had spent the night at. Sam was already up, drinking coffee while staring at a computer screen. He blinked a few times, trying to get the sleep out of his eyes.
Shawn put a finger to his temple and gave them a look as if they were stupid. "I'm a psychic, remember?"
"He has a cruise with his pharmaceutical company."
She nodded. "They came and started asking all these weird questions about bad smells and flickering lights or something."
Dean shook his head. "Sorry, man, but we should really get going as soon as possible."
"Hm?" Shawn looked up - since when was he staring at girl-Lassie on the floor? - and realized the others were looking at him expectantly. "Did you say something?"
“Hm. I don’t think so. We were mostly on the road.”
-One Day Ago-
(See the end of the chapter for
"-but no one is leaving yet," he finished.
And then there was the matter of how Dean looked at him. As he spoke to him, he had this intense look in his eyes that Shawn had only seen in someone once before. He had seen that same look in Lassie's eyes the one night they were at the bar, and Lassie told Shawn that he astounded him.
"Shawn, next time I see you, I'm going to kill you," Dean said with a scowl.
“Woody!” Shawn called out. “I know you’re in there! You have to fight this guy!”
Dean glanced back at Shawn, to see if he had any clue what Zach was talking about. Shawn just shrugged and shook his head, so Dean turned back to Zach.
I'm having a hard time getting inspiration for this, so thank you guys for your patience!
"Hunters?" Shawn asked. He glanced at Gus, then back at the fake FBI agents. "We're standing over a human murder, and you're asking about animal murder?"
"Wait a second, who are you?" Lassiter asked.
"Is that something we aren't gonna talk about? Or…" Shawn trailed off.
“Shawn, everyone can tell there’s something going on. You both keep avoiding each other, and whenever you’re in the same room, you’re always staring at each other. Anyone else in the room with you two can pretty much feel the tension.” Gus shook his head. “Just get it figured out.”
“I’m serious, Shawn.”
Shawn didn’t know how to explain it. The blue light went down his throat, then suddenly he was at home. He was watching his parents from the stairs. They were sitting on the couch, talking. Arguing was a better term to apply to it. They hadn’t started yelling, but just the sound of the agitation in their voices was enough to set Shawn on edge. He turned and tried to walk out the door, but when he walked through, he ended up at Camp Tikihama. It was swim time, and he was sitting on the beach, watching Gus play in the water with Jason. The hurt and betrayal that he had shoved down all those years ago began to resurface.
“So...about yesterday—”
"What about Bigfoot?"
friends, Spencer."
A barista on the other side of the counter asked what he would like to get. It was an unusually deep voice, which made Dean look up. There was a man with bright blue eyes that matched the flower Dean still had in his hand.
Lassie looked at Shawn in surprise. "You do?" He asked quickly. Then he shook his head and looked away again. "I should go."
He gulped. "Soooo how do we kill these things? I don't imagine you guys have light sabers with you."
Shawn narrowed his eyes slightly. He could tell that wasn't the only reason, but he didn't press any further.
Dean shrugged and went to the back of the store. There wasn’t a lot back there, surprisingly. There was a sink, a freezer, an oven, and a locked door that simply said ‘Castiel’ on it. There were pictures on the wall, though. Pictures of what looked like a younger Castiel. A smiling Castiel.
Shawn looked at Gus with an expression that said 'what is going on'. Gus shot back an equally confused look.
The man nodded. “Did you need anything else?”
"Before what?" Cas asked.
Lassie ignored him and started packing stuff into a bag. Typical.
With the video paused, Shawn bent closer to the screen and zoomed it in. It was the only moment that he turned to face the screen. His eyes looked completely black.
"What? No!" Dean answered quickly. He looked at Sam for help, but Sam just shrugged. He huffed. "I meant that Castiel is literally an angel. From heaven."
The woman at the desk smiled. "Ah, we've been expecting you. Right this way." She got up and led them down a few halls. "My name's Lisa, by the way," she said as she walked.
Woody's smile disappeared, and he looked at Shawn in confusion, before looking back at the FBI agents. "Who's Zachariah?"
“So...what are you?”
"Guys!" Sam stepped in. "We don't have time to waste."
They went inside and sat down at the bar. Dean looked around, then groaned.
"Yes it did. He said he wouldn't GO, even for DesperEAUX."
Dean stepped back at glanced at Sam. Sam raised his eyebrows in surprise.
“Uh, Shawn, I think you should let him go,” Gus said. “He looks like he wants to kill you, and I have no doubt he will.”
Shawn grinned at that. “You’d go on vacation with me?”
Lassie was silent for a few moments before saying, "Shawn, you terrify me."
“Why not?” Shawn whined. “Come onnnn Gus! I even convinced Chief to let us go on official business!”
Sam's eyes widened and he looked at his brother, concerned. "Is that—"
Shawn frowned. “What are you talking about?”
"Okay this really is a touching reunion," Lassiter said, "but I'm gonna leave now."
Dean's gaze hardened and he looked behind him to see the one and only Gabriel.
Lassie stepped away. "We shouldn't be doing this." He let go of Shawn's hand and started heading towards the door. "I have to go." Shawn tried to tell him to wait, but he was already out the door.
Gus looked at Shawn. "I told you!"
Chief intervened. "Spencer, Guster, we are in the presence of proffesionals. Please stop messing around!"
Dean flashed the man a charming smile and said, “I’ll take anything cold and caramel.”
Lassie froze for a second before going back to packing. It was quick enough that most people wouldn't notice, but Shawn did. He furrowed his brows in thought.
They drove to the bar in silence, except for Dean's music playing. When they got there, Dean saw a blue Toyota Echo in the parking lot.
Cain immediately shook his head. “Just get it over with.”
“Look, whatever’s going on between us, we should put it on hold while we’re here, okay?”
"Like what?"
Shawn went to the station and frowned. It was a lot busier than normal. People were rushing bye, and there was a group of people at the desk, everyone shouting. He went over to Juliet's desk.
After the hunters left, Shawn turned back to Lassie. "You never answered me. What were you doing here?"
"Crowley? Really?"
"What?" Sam asked.
Lassiter gave Gabriel the death glare, and so did Gus. Shawn seemed caught up in his own world.
"The Good Lion?" Dean asked skeptically. He shook his head. "Whaddaya say we go check it out then?"
“Yes! Come on! Fight him!” Shawn pretty much shouted.
Cas hesitated. "Yes, but I have no way of knowing how damaged the vessel may be. I'd have to get close enough to touch him, and I don't think Zachariah would let me that close."
"I don't know. We can't just kill him, and there's no way to prevent Zachariah from inhabiting him if he already said yes."
"Yeah! One of the coolest professions in the world! He's like a real life Neal Caffrey!"
"So if crucifixes and holy water don't kill vampires, what does?" Gus asked. "Garlic? Silver bullet?"
"Who's Zachariah?" Gus asked. "Do I even want to know?"
Okay so I don't actually know what happens to the vessel when they're possessed by an angel, so I kinda took a guess. (They probably just black out, like Sam did with Gadreel, but idk I wanted to make it more interesting)
"We're going to Las Vegas!"
"You think I didn't try? I did try! But you wouldn't listen!" Shawn took a deep breath. "Look, I think we should just both take a deep breath, okay?"
Shawn clicked his tongue at them all. "None of you have any faith in me! If Jules was here, she'd trust me."
Gus suddenly sat up at that. “It’s ten o’clock?! Why didn’t you wake me up sooner?”
"Apparently."
Chief Vick gave Shawn a side-eye before confronting Sam and Dean. "And why is the FBI here?"
Dean waited for him to elaborate, but when he wouldn't, he just turned back to Shawn and Gus. "You two need to leave, now."
Lassiter turned to face Shawn incredulously. "Excuse me?"
"Sounds like a demon to me," Dean said. "But why would a demon be stealing art? Did they just get a new house and they're looking for some nice new decor?" He scoffed.
“My name isn’t Lassie,” he all but growled. He then walked toward the door, but Shawn reached out and stopped him.
Dean paused to think. "That...actually would make sense."
Those words stung more than Shawn was comfortable with. "I had no choice," he said softly. "It was either that or you guys would lock me up for something I didn't do."
"We should get going," he said aloud. He looked at Lisa. "Thank you for your time."
"Wait you mean like the agents from Feds?" Shawn asked.
"This way," Lassiter said curtly, walking in the direction of the coroner's office. Shawn and Gus decided to come along as well, much to everyone's annoyance.
"Fine," Chief spat. "But if this case isn't solved within 24 hours, I will let Lassiter and O'Hara onto this case."
Zachariah looked at Lassie in utter fear, and Shawn realized Dean and Cas were standing in front of Shawn in an almost protective manner. That’s when it dawned on Shawn that maybe, just maybe, this wasn’t Lassie. No, this was someone much more powerful, and much, much more murderous.
When they finally arrived in Las Vegas, they were both singing whole-heartedly to Bohemian Rhapsody. Carlton pulled up to the hotel they had booked a room in and parked the car. Before either of them got out, Carlton turned to look at Spencer. Shawn. Whatever
“Busy day?” Dean asked.
For a second, Zachariah’s face shifted and became more Woody-ish, then went back to being Zachariah.
Dean spoke up. “Hold on just a second.” He saw Cas shoot him a look out of the corner of his eye, but he ignored it. “Who’s Cain?”
Woody shrugged. "Okay!" He walked over to the head of the table where the body was laying. "Stanley here was drained completely of blood, and the only wound he has is this mark on his neck. Now, most people don't bleed completely out from a simple wound like this, even if it did puncture the artery. The mark looks like a bite, but not any I've seen before. I'm honestly not sure what bit him."
“Nice to meetcha, Castiel. I’m Dean.” He reached across the counter to shake Castiel’s hand, but the other man just glanced down at. Dean nodded and took his hand back with a tight smile.
Dean looked at Sam in exasperation.
"Enough of your games Spencer! I'm tired of you always doing this!" Lassiter once again faced Sam and Dean and got out his handcuffs.
"Ummm Lassie, you never answered me," Shawn said.
"....What?"
He looked up when Lassie and Shawn entered, and a half surprised, half delighted expression appeared on his face.
Anyways enjoy this chapter and comments are always appreciated!
“You do? Without hurting Woody?”
“Guys, we gotta go save Dean and Castiel!”
"Nice blueberry," he muttered sarcastically.
“You’d have to be an associate first.”
Shawn turned himself and Gus away and started speaking in a low voice. "These guys aren't FBI."
Shawn interrupted. “Who cares?! We gotta go now!”
"He's one of the douchiest angels in the Garrison," Dean answered. "No one likes him. Your coroner buddy looks exactly like him."
Shawn exchanged a look with Gus, and he slowly stepped away from Lassie, letting go of his hand. “Uh, Lassie? Are you okay?”
"Those do nothing to vampires," Sam said. "In order to kill it, you gotta chop their heads off."
“Okay, fine. How do I become a soldier?” If Dean couldn’t get an audience with The God as he was, then he decided he would join the Novaks and rank up until he could.
Dean narrowed his eyes. It was obvious this guy was lying, but he didn’t want to push it with the other customer in hearing distance. “Ah, too bad.”
When they got to Lassiter's house, Lassie told Shawn to stay in the car, which Shawn completely ignored.
"A friend," Dean answered shortly before looking back at Sam. "Let's just go check into a motel for the night. I have a feeling we'll be here longer than we expected."
Dean nodded. “Yeah. Did we do something this week? The past few days are kinda hazy for me.”
"Did not."
"If I wasn't a real psychic, how would I know you two aren't actual FBI agents?" Shawn countered.
"Gabriel!" Zachariah said. Dean thought he could almost detect a hint of fear in his voice. "How lovely it is to see you. I was just on my way out!"
Shawn clicked his tongue at Gus. “Don’t be a mongoose, Gus. He won’t kill me.” He looked back at Lassie. “You won’t kill me, right?”
Chief sighed as Shawn grinned and said, "I'm Psychic Detective Shawn Spencer, and this is my partner, Mr. Clean." Gus folded his arms and smiled like Mr. Clean.
"Despereaux is in Las Vegas, and I need a partner to go with me to check it out."
"It only appears to someone after they 'express their desire for female companionship'." Sam closed the computer.
Sam huffed. "Look, if you have any better suggestions—"
"That's alright. Anyways, this was captured on last night's feed, and it's the only time we've actually managed to catch the thief on screen." She played a recording of the security.
Gus slapped Shawn's arm. "You do realize they're basically strangers, right?" He hissed.
Sam sighed and closed his computer before standing up as well. "Fine. Let's go."
Cain stopped moving, and the room went silent. Everyone seemed to be holding their breath as Cain slowly looked toward Shawn. “I told you, my name isn’t Lassie.”
Sam looked at Dean in question, but Dean just shrugged. He was just as confused as Sam.
Lassie raised an eyebrow skeptically. "How do you know?"
Dean furrowed his eyebrows and frowned in confusion. He looked back at Shawn and saw the pained expression on his face, and he realized this must’ve been about their holding-hand thing earlier.
“Sure,” Dean said, even though he had no idea what that was.
"No, no, it's not a prank. Just...those things tend to be linked to this guy we're chasing."
Carlton's face went blank as he stared at her. "Wh-what?"
Dean nodded and pulled up a picture on his phone. A black ‘67 Chevy Impala.
“You mean the whole week-long cruise thing? Yeah, that seems sooo much more important than Pierre Despereaux.”
Lassiter groaned and put his face in his hands. "What now, Spencer?"
Lisa Braeden looked up at them and smiled. There wasn't even a hint of recognition in her eyes. "Hi! How can I help you?"
Zachariah scoffed, but Shawn could see a bit of nervousness in his expression. “He’s too weak. He can’t fight me.” He smiled smugly. “You want to save your friend?”
For now, he just had to level up.
"Ow! Lassie, what was that for?!"
“Okay, then. That wasn’t expected.” Zachariah looked between Cain and Shawn. “You guys got anything like that you want to do?”
Shawn grinned. "Me and Gus traced the murders back to a group of guys who visited here a while ago, so we decided to stop by and see if the vampire works here or something. Any of you want a drink? They've got some awesome pineapple margaritas here."
Lassiter looked between Sam and Dean, then back at Shawn. He seemed to realize how serious everyone was. He slowly put his handcuffs away. "I can't believe I'm listening to a bunch of nut jobs right now."
“But if you take their offer, it can be again,” Shawn pointed out. “I can have my memories washed, too. I won’t remember that you’re...Cain, or whatever.”
The drive to Las Vegas was quiet, as long as Carlton blocked out Spencer’s constant talking. He knew Spencer was just trying to keep things from getting awkward, but he didn’t bother giving any more than one-word answers. Eventually Spencer just turned on some music. ‘I Will Wait’ by Mumford and Sons started blasting in the speakers, and Carlton groaned.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Leave, before he returns and kills us all,” Cas said threateningly.
"Ma'am, with all due respect, I can do whatever I please." Dean and Chief had a mini staring contest.
Shawn stayed back for a moment to see how Dean interacted with Castiel. The trench-coated stranger had something intriguing about him, and Shawn wanted to know more about him. From what he could tell from having interacted with him in this short amount of time, he was stoic and reserved. He didn't know how to tie a tie correctly, and he hadn't had his trenchcoat washed in a while. Shawn could see a small dark stain on one of the lapels, and if he had to guess, he'd say it was a bloodstain.
Once they were in the car, Sam turned on Dean, but before he could say anything, Dean held up his hand to stop him. "I told you to never bring her up again. So don't."
"Hey, a little help over here?" Shawn called. The girl-who-looked-like-Lassie kept trying to get him to dance. He looked down and saw a hoof peek out from the edge of her dress. "She has hooves," he said mostly to himself.
Spencer — no, Shawn — nodded, the usual glee in his face replaced with actual seriousness for once. “Of course. Just...why?”
"Oh, it was plenty funny to me! Anyways." He turned back to Lisa, his face taking on a serious facade again — a facade that Carlton could see right through, but apparently Lisa couldn't. "The man in the video actually happens to be an old friend of mine—"
Shawn shook his head. "No, the light's in the wrong place for his eyes to be shadowed like that. Either he's wearing black eye contacts, or he's a—"
Lassiter froze. "You two are really going along with this?"
Sam's eyes widened and he whispered something else to Dean. Dean nodded slightly. "So I assume you'll be taking Stanley here to the coroner soon, right?" Dean asked.
Shawn rolled his eyes. "Gus, don't be Randall Peltzer from the Gremlins. This is obviously the work of a vampire."
Castiel glanced at him but didn’t answer. Instead, he took the order of another customer. When he was done, Dean spoke again.
Dean took the dagger and stabbed the girl who was approaching Castiel next. This time he had a furious expression on his face. Almost as if...no, that couldn't be.
"Why are you here? Why are you letting your vessel take control? It's not like you."
"How fun is this?" Woody asked. "Four guys all working a case together!"
Lassie furrowed his eyebrows and frowned again. "Excuse me? Is he telling the truth?"
"Listen," Dean said, speaking to both Gabriel and Zachariah, "you douche bags are going to let the people who aren't hunters leave, and we can work this out. Got it?"
Dean narrowed his eyes. "I'm not talking about animal hunting. You're a psychic, right?"
Dean nodded in agreement before saying, "Wait a second. Cas left before we got to figure out the whole thing with Zachariah."
Dean shook his head dismissively. "No time to explain. What do we even do if the coroner is Zachariah's vessel?"
"What bar?"
Dean rolled his eyes. "No thanks. Cas, can't you poof them away, or something?"
"I'm Dean Winchester, and this is my brother Sam. You know all those stories of monsters you were told as a kid? They're all real. Well, mostly."
Shawn just mouthed a silent 'oh'. That's awkward. He guessed these girls weren't vampires. He glanced over at Dean, who had a hardened look in his eyes.
Gus shot Shawn a glare, and Shawn sighed and pouted. “Fiiine. I’ll ask Lassie to go with me, then.”
"Hello to you too, Castiel. Can't I just drop in on my two favorite brothers? Well, Zachariah isn't really a fave of mine, but Cassie, you are!" Gabriel grinned and a snickers bar appeared in his hand. He peeled back the wrapper and took a bite out of it.
"I don't know, man. Maybe they want to steal money or something." Shawn turned back to the group. "Anyways, as I was saying before De Witt and Zuckerman showed up, Stanley Mordachi was killed by a vampire!" He stuck his fingers to his gums like vampire fangs for effect.
"He said that there's no vampire nests anywhere near Santa Barbara. Apparently another hunter cleared them all out a few months ago."
“Shawn, listen to me!”
Lisa chuckled at their bantering. "You sound like an old married couple."
“Not right now,” Castiel cut him off. “Give me five minutes, and I’ll meet you in the back.”
“What?”
Chief Vick walked up to the four. "Stanley Mordachi. He was found this morning. There are no witnesses, and so far no suspects."
The man raised an eyebrow. “Like what?”
"I didn't know what else to do, man," Sam says as he leans back, his voice cracking. "I didn't know what else to—I didn't know how bad it was, and he seemed to be fading fast, and I didn't want him to die thinking he failed me or something, but I—"
Dean.
They go into town to walk around the local flea market, which isn't something Dean has ever done in his life. It's right up his alley, though. He has a ridiculous amount of fun with it, strolling along with Cas, haggling for shit he doesn't even need, talking to perfect strangers. He buys a new pocket-knife, some alligator-skin boots he'll probably never get the opportunity to wear, and two slices of pie. Cas buys a lava lamp and a weighted blanket that Dean assumes is for him until Cas corrects him and admits that it's for Dean.
like he's stripping down when he usually refuses to. When Cas squints, wrinkles form beside his eyes. Dean wants to reach out and brush his fingers over them, which is so goddamn weird that he's judging himself.
Lassie rolled his eyes. "Okay. Why isn't Guster going with you?"
"Nice place, Lassie."
Spencer started laughing, and Lisa hesitantly joined in. Carlton shot a glare at Shawn.
Sam glanced at Dean, then looked back at Lisa and nodded. "We think the criminal could be someone we've been chasing all over the country."
The man nodded and started preparing the drink. Dean watched him and let his mind wander to how he was going to find the ring. It was like looking for a needle in a haystack, and there was no way to light a fire that would burn the hay.
He puts his food back in the bag and goes out to get his own change of clothes for a shower. When he shuts himself in the bathroom, the door closes with an almost-silent click—shame. He takes his time, going through the motions, guilt eating away at him until he almost can't stand himself. After, he scrubs himself dry a little too harshly with the towel.
He's important. And he can go away and never come back. That, Dean has already suffered through. The Dean who went and visited a meadow as much as he could would be
Dean makes a small sound, gasping, "Why?"
"Cas, come on, he turned out mostly alright in the end," Dean says lightly, then immediately clears his throat and starts shaking his head when Cas cuts him a severe look. "I mean, he was a pain in my ass, so good riddance, really."
It's crude and childish. It's Dean being as much of an asshole as he can be, and he's very skilled at that particular trait. It should not be in any way enticing, and yet, frustratingly enough, Castiel's fingers itch with the urge to touch Dean, to cross lines that he knows he can't. He is, in so many ways, endlessly weak for Dean Winchester and so,
"You don't have to do that," Dean mumbles, but he reaches out to take the lone flower when the kid holds it out more forcefully.
especially if you take the sex out of the equation.
"Don't say I didn't warn you, Carl Fredricksen," Sorine says, shrugging.
Castiel also tells them what Heaven is like, who's all there, how peaceful it is. On one hand, Dean's happy to be alive in the way he wasn't only yesterday; on the other, he kinda wishes he could be in Heaven, if only to see those he misses again. But Castiel assures them that time is different in Heaven, that it won't feel very long to those waiting by the time Sam and Dean make it up there. So, sure, living until they're not doesn't seem so bad, especially when they know what they've got waiting for them after.
When Dean asks about Benny, he gets an answer he wishes he didn't have to hear. His heart drops when he's informed that Benny has been dead for years. It was more than just the things they got up to while they were in Purgatory together; it was about the fact that they were genuinely friends. Again with the whole theme of friends not fucking friends, but in fact, they do. And Dean has. Benny, included.
You wouldn't do that to me. Tell me you wouldn't—"
So, Dean begs off for a shower. He actually does need one. He leaves reassuring Sam that he's okay, yet again, and then he goes to his room to fight his way out of Michael's stupid clothes.
Castiel opens his mouth, then closes it. He searches Dean's face again, before saying, "I don't want anyone else to fall for me."
lmao, pls leave me to my happy ramblings, im just here to have fun.
Castiel turns to look at him, waiting. "Yes?'
"He never wanted to be just friends," Sam murmurs sadly, his shoulders slumping.
Dean is so
"I know," Dean rasps. "I'm just not—I don't know how to explain it. I
Later that night, Dean isn't surprised when Cas knocks on his door and slips into the room. He doesn't say anything at first, just stares at Dean with furrowed eyebrows and exceptionally sad eyes.
you don't want to, but you have to, okay?"
"Do you want to talk?" Dean asks, instinctively.
Castiel is back, and Dean stops counting for how long. When he wakes from dreams he can't really remember, he doesn't have to go far to reassure himself that Castiel is still here. He just turns over, and there he is, right next to him.
It's the same as with the fingers, but on a border scale. Bigger, for a lack of better term. Because, well, Cas' dick is bigger, so Dean's mouth is fuller, and this somehow correlates as better to Dean's brain. He's not aware of the ache in his legs, or the strain in his knees, or the twinge in his back. He actually
"Kids, huh?" Dean croaks.
"It has rapidly improved," Castiel assures him.
"What?" Sam responds. "No, but—"
wouldn't get jealous anyway, so.
to home.
Dean's heart plummets. "You
"Was that weird? That was weird," Dean mutters as he shuffles over to the bed. He sits down on the end, his back to Cas.
Castiel blinks at him. "I...stole your heart?"
It's just never the right moment. Dean keeps waiting for things to get better, even just one second of relief. But things don't ease up, and it gets easier not to say it each time that he swallows it down.
"That is true," Cas murmurs.
Dean stares after them for a while, then spends a solid minute imagining putting a brick to Shawn's face—roughly, of course—to show him the art of fucking subtlety. It is only after he's divulged in this, admittedly, violent fantasy that he comes to the rather abrupt realization that he's jealous.
Angry Dean. We know him well. 😔
"You're going to get a shower, then?" Dean asks, jerking a nod at his shirt in Castiel's hands.
"I don't—I'm not—" Dean cuts himself off with a groan, his head falling forward to land on Cas' shoulder. He pants into his neck, his hands flying up to grab Cas' arms, nails digging in. "Don't know. Don't care. Just—just… In. I want—get
Oh. Oh, that's… Okay, that's kind of cute.
But Cas says it, and right now,
come at the price of his life.
Dean suddenly wishes with a vengeance that he could do something for Castiel,
He knows it now, because he's suddenly fucking terrified of what happens when Cas pulls away. They can't do this forever, but if they could, Dean knows he'd never murder another soul.
It's such a
is he so goddamn hopelessly in love with the person he's most furious with, unable to have a quick fuck with an old friend just because it might mean something, and all he wants anything to mean something with is Cas?
It feels like his brain is constricting, and it comes to him slow and clumsy that Cas isn't coming, that he's going to die right here. He fights it, even after that realization, because if he's gonna go down, he's gonna go down swinging. He feels like someone is pressing on his chest after having set his insides on fire, and he can't open his mouth or he'll—
"I imagine you would have been upset."
"Yeah. Yeah, go ahead. Floor's yours," Dean mumbles, grinning without meaning to.
"Yeah," Dean breathes out. "Yeah, Cas. Jesus Christ. Come here. Fucking come here."
Sam sighs. "Dean, it's going to work."
"Little over a month now," Dean forces himself to say, his fingers twitching and curling into fists. He stuffs them in his pockets and looks away.
"I want to ruin you," Cas whispers, like the confession is shameful instead of the hottest thing Dean has heard in years. "You couldn't possibly understand how deeply I want to just
Dean's so damn proud of him for that, for being unlike any other angel, for adapting and learning to bend when others might break. It's Dean's fault, and he hates it, but Cas is so goddamn
Cas not only wins the battle, but he wins the war while he's at it. He finishes what Dean started, getting out of his own pants, which is great because Dean was
Dean thinks, then continues to think it on a perpetual loop of steadily rising panic.
"Got it in one." Dean hisses in triumph when he finally locates the thermos. "Why aren't you typing? You're still not typing. Dude, come on."
"Look," Tim bites out, "I don't know what you think Shonda can tell you, but talking to her right now isn't such a good idea, okay? Come back...never."
"Just stay here for a minute."
All the warmth that Dean has been collecting since Castiel got back suddenly disappears like a flickering candle being blown out. He's cold all the way down to his bones. A numb, horrified cold that hardens around his twisting heart. And
He can't refuse to, not when Castiel is so sincere, not when he means it in the way promises are supposed to be—never broken, cradled safely in trust that could make someone float while taking a leap into nothingness, completely blindfolded.
"Okay," Sam says. "Okay, sure, but—but what if you, um, meet someone?"
"What?" Castiel snarls, slamming his book shut and whipping his head around to glare at Dean directly, and it's Dean's fault that they're this close to begin with, so it's Dean's fault that their noses brush.
Castiel hums. "You're welcome."
"Oh, so it's like that? And you're trying to leave? Cas, what the hell is wrong with you?"
Sam blurts out, practically sailing across the space to slam into Castiel and hug him, still crying just a little, his gratitude palpable.
When he leaves, he stops by a dark red, nearly purple flower, considering. But no. No, he's got one at home, if only he'll convince himself to bring it out again. Maybe one day.
"Fuck no," Dean blurts out immediately, incredulous, appalled at the mere insinuation.
"Obviously!" Lassie yelled. "You stare at her and follow her around like a lost puppy with heart eyes!"
"Why can't we go?" Shawn asked.
"Then you can't come with us."
“We don’t need Woody,” Lassie said in a low voice.
Dean smiled. "Great. Lemme just call Cas." He took out his phone and dialed a number. After a few seconds, he smiled and said, "Cas! We need you in order to catch the Sith Lord." He paused. "No, you aren't going to be bait....we're at the uh," he checked the motel room key, "Hacienda Motel, room 116."
"Those are Baobhan Siths," the dude who was supposedly Castiel responded. Shawn wondered if he had ever had fun in his life before. He certainly looked like he didn't.
"Okay, so what is Cas?" Gus asked.
"Not funny, Spencer," he growled.
“I can’t hear you, Lassie! The music’s too loud! ‘Well I came home, like a stone, and I fell heavy into your arms!’” he half shouted, half sung the lyrics. Carlton rolled his eyes and accepted his fate. The rest of the ride was spent with music being played too loud, and Carlton would never admit that he quietly sang along.
Lisa didn't respond.
“Hello, Dean. Sam.” Cas was looking at Dean intensely, and Dean started to wonder if something was wrong.
Spencer seemed to reconsider his words. "Fine. Contacts it is, then." He rolled his eyes.
Sam shook his head. "I don't think so. His name is Shawn Spencer. He works for the police department there, and has solved tons of murder cases. He owns an agency called Psych."
Carlton started sputtering as his face turned red. "We — Shawn! — we aren't — that's not—"
"That didn't rhyme, Shawn."
"Nice change of subject, Spencer."
"Oh be quiet, Spencer," Lassie cut him off. "Let the adults talk."
“Well then, Carlton.” Shawn ignored the death glare that Lassie shot at him.
“I’m fine.” Cas looked away. “I was just checking in on you. I...I wanted to make sure you were okay after dealing with the siths.”
“Why not? He’s the one that brought my past back to me.”
"Great. How do we find it?"
Dean nodded. “That’s a risk I’m willing to take.”
"Lassie, they aren't real FBI agents," Shawn said. "They can't help."
Shawn grinned. “Despereaux, man!”
"I am sensing that what we're dealing with here is a vampire!" Shawn burst out as he put his fingers to his temple. "The marks on his neck look like a bite mark, and he's very pale, meaning he was drained of all blood!"
Sam looked over. “Hey. So get this,” he started rambling about some case in New York while Dean got up and poured himself a glass of El Sol.
“I’m ready now,” he said. He opened his eyes and looked at Zachariah in determination. “Take our memories now.” He resisted the urge to look at Cas. He didn’t want to know what kind of expression was there, because if he did, he knew it would be a lot harder to let Zach take their memories.
"We aren't 'going along with' anything," Dean said, using air quotes. "This guy's a literal idiot. You wouldn't ever find us going along with him. But right now he's telling the truth. We hunt anything that goes bump in the night. Vampires, werewolves. Hell, we even hunt demons!"
At that moment, Chief Vick walked up. "Agents," she said to Dean and Cas. "I thought the case was solved?"
"But—" Sam tried to protest, gesturing at Lisa.
Carlton saw Lisa shift out of the corner of his eye, and he immediately closed his mouth, stopping himself from saying his next retort. He glared at Shawn, as if to say, 'We'll finish this later,' even though he knew they wouldn't. No matter how much he pretended to dislike Shawn, he actually enjoyed their arguments.
Whatcha doing Lassie? 🤔
"Excuse me," Dean said loudly. "What's going on here?"
"Are we supposed to know what those are?" Gus asked.
"You wanna be bait?"
Lassie sighed. "Fine, I'll go. Does Chief know?"
Zachariah chuckled. “You really thought this...this monster here,” he gestured at Lassiter, “was really just a simple detective? No...he’s a demon. Not just any demon, though. He was the first demon. The father of murder.”
“Turn it off, Spencer!” he yelled over the music.
"Son of a bitch," Lassie said disappointedly. "I'm gonna need you two to turn around. You're under arrest for falsely impersonating members of the FBI."
She gave him the side-eye and furrowed her eyebrows. "Why don't you take Gus?"
"I knew you took my taffies!"
Dean waited for him to elaborate, and when he didn’t, he asked, “How do I become an associate?”
"Woody," Shawn said with a warning tone.
Dean glanced between Lassiter and Zachariah with a frown, then looked at Cas in confusion. ‘Who’s Cain?’
Please give Kudos if you enjoyed this! 😊
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean narrowed his eyes. "No. Like the agents from real life."
"Oh, right. Of course! Hey by the way, guys," he looked at Sam, Dean, and Castiel, "If you want, you can come hang out at the Psych office for a while."
They set up their stuff in the room they were sharing, which thankfully had two beds, before heading to the local museum, from which there were reports that art had been stolen. Each night for the past week, another piece of art had been stolen. Most of them were paintings, but the most recent one was an ancient relic that had indecipherable symbols on it.
Cas nodded. “Good. I’ll...I’ll be going now. Call me if you need anything.” With that, he disappeared.
Gus nodded. "He has bite marks on his neck and is drained of blood!"
Lassie scoffed.
The two looked at each other with wary expressions before Sam said, "If you were a real psychic, you would know who we really are."
Eventually the other customer left, and Dean rounded on Castiel. “Alright I know you’re hiding something. What do you know?”
"She your girlfriend?" Shawn asked Sam.
"You said art museums, not historical museums." Dean took a giant bite of his burger.
After they got back to their hotel, a black car lurked outside in the shadows, where no one would be able to see it. In the car were two men. The driver turned toward the one in the passenger seat.
Chief Vick narrowed her eyes. "What about Lassiter and O'Hara?" She asked, gesturing to Jules and Lassie.
Carlton walked into the museum and flashed his badge at the woman working at the front desk. She had dark brown eyes and even darker hair. "SBPD, here to talk to the person who runs this place?" He looked around the room. There were a few paintings hung up on the walls, which were a warm wood color with swirls of amber.
"Again, who are you to stop me?"
"They're totally the FBI!" He whispered at Gus.
"I am sensing that you two have a secret that you aren't telling us!" Shawn announced, pointing at Sam and Dean with one hand and doing the finger-to-the-temple with the other hand.
Shawn was standing in front of Gus’s desk, where he had apparently fallen asleep at his computer. Gus groaned and slowly woke up.
~~~~~
It's been a while since I last updated this!
"Lassie...I always thought you hated me."
Lassie looked at Shawn, and Shawn could tell there was definitely a change in him. There was some sort of rage in his eyes, and that was the moment that Shawn began fearing for his life. Whatever was happening to Lassie was something so...so otherworldly.
"He still works there?"
Kudos and comments make me super happy!
“Despereaux is back!”
Dean nodded. "And we gotta kill it."
Lassie scoffed. “A couple of humans saving Dean Winchester and an angel from another angel?” He rolled his eyes. “Figures.”
"But this might be the only time we get to see a real vampire!" Shawn whined. "Let us goooooo!"
"So since you know that I'm not psychic, I think me and Gus deserve to know who exactly you are," Shawn said.
"Yeah, Shawn," Gus said. "We should leave."
I'm going to be updating ASAP!
Don't worry guys! This won't be the end. Not gonna spoil anything, but they will eventually figure things out
Dean had an idea, and just the thought of it made his heart leap up into his throat. He looked at Cas and made up his mind. He wouldn’t remember this anyways, right?
"Lassie? What are you doing here?"
"Well…" Sam peered at the computer screen and clicked a few times. "This other website says no art was actually stolen; that was just a rumor. It's just that the art museums were broken into."
Something in Cas’s gaze gave Dean the impression that there was something he didn’t know. Maybe it had to do with the feeling that he was forgetting something.
Dean and Cas walked into the station and were immediately met with Shawn and Gus, who were being escorted by Lassiter, all while yelling something about hot dog stands.
"You guys ready to go, or do you wanna just keep standing there, staring at each other?" Sam asked.
"First of all, their names are totally the last names of the agents from Feds. But also they don't act like FBI. They slouch, and their shirts are wrinkled." He glanced at the fake agents for a couple seconds before turning back to Gus. "And the tall dude is carrying a dagger. The shorter one's carrying a shotgun."
-fast forward a couple months-
Sam got off the phone and looked at Dean. "Cas said it's not a vamp, Dean," he said in a low voice.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean raised an eyebrow and took a giant bite out of his cheeseburger. "And?"
Sam and Dean both nodded.
“What do you want, Shawn?”
"Spencer!" Lassiter yelped. He noticed Sam and Dean and straightened up. "Agents."
Chief nodded. "Detective Lassiter, would you please escort these two to the coroner?" She walked away without waiting for a response, and Lassiter glared at Dean while Dean just smiled smugly at the detective.
Lassiter tried to say something, but Shawn cut him off. "Let me finish. I know usually I'm always joking around about things like thid, but you get a serious Shawn moment here. I thought you hated me, but I've been in love with you for years."
Sam was at a table with his computer opened in front of him, and Dean was pacing around the room.
He looked out his window.
"Meanwhile," Dean continued. "You two idiots stay here, out of danger. Me and Sammy gotta find the vamp that killed Stan the Man over there."
"When do we leave?"
Sam shook his head. "He said he'll have to come and see for himself."
“He’s back in Santa Barbara?” Gus slowly went back to what he was doing.
I'm kinda losing inspiration for this fic, so I think I'm gonna complete it a lot sooner than I thought I would
Shawn was still holding Lassie’s hand tightly. They were at the Psych office, after they escaped from Not-Woody.
I'm so sorry I haven't updated in a while, I just haven't had any motivation, and I've been kinda busy with school and stuff. Anyways, enjoy
"Jess," Shawn heard Sam whisper. He saw that Sam was looking at the one blonde, and he guessed she was Jess.
Cain barked a humorless laugh. “But then you guys would still know who I am. I can’t have that, see. I can’t have anyone knowing who I really am, not without them ending up dead.” He turned his glare back to Zachariah. “I think I’ll start with killing you.”
So I know this chapter kind of ended suddenly but I was having trouble coming up with what's next. Hopefully the next chapter will have more action and get into the storyline more!
Dean shook his head and leaned back in his chair. “Nah, I was just hoping to relax here for a while. What’s your name?”
“Gus, it’s like, ten o’clock in the morning, wake up!”
"Uh-huh, sure."
He reached out before he could change his mind and pulled Cas closer to him, crushing their lips together. He felt Cas stiffen for a few seconds before melting into the kiss. He cradled Cas’s face in his hands, never wanting the moment to end. He kind of wished he could remember just this moment, but he knew it had to be taken away.
I just got a new job and I’ve had writer’s block for a while. Anyways, hopefully I’ll update again soon!
"Sure, but we're probably just going back to our motel," Sam answered.
“FIne, Shawn. How do you suggest we deal with an angel possessing our friend? Huh? Last time I checked, none of us know the first thing about that. And how do we even know he really is an angel? Aren’t angels supposed to be peaceful and, you know, angelic?”
Lassiter packed faster. "I don't know what you're talking about."
"Does that mean you're really a psychic?" Lassie asked quietly. He finally made eye contact with Shawn, and the sincerity in his eyes made Shawn be the one to look away. His face must've given him away. He heard Lassie curse under his breath. "I was actually beginning to trust you, Spencer."
“Is a caramel frappe okay?”
"Wait a minute," Gus said, turning to Shawn. "How did you know there was a crucifix in my desk?"
They got in the car, and Dean drove to the police station after giving Sam a voicemail, telling him where they were going.
Zach chuckled. "It was my means of camouflage, I suppose. I figured you wouldn't kill a kooky, innocent, old coroner. But now that you know who I am, I suppose I could just kill dear old Woody."
Shawn shook his head. "Not gonna happen."
"I'm going home to pack up some stuff, because I assume we'll be there for a few days at least," Lassiter said.
They walked away, leaving a bewildered-looking Lisa behind.
“Cars,” Dean blurted out. “I can fix them. And drive really fast. And really do anything relating to cars.”
"It is," Cas whispers.
There is the question of how, precisely, Jack managed to do that. As he enters the kitchen with Jack trailing after him, Castiel asks it. He murmurs a very careful, "Jack, what did you do to get me back from the Empty?"
Henry shakes his head. "As far as the weather channel knows, it'll carry on into tomorrow. We've also got an extra cooler or two if you need to store some milk or something. Wouldn't want anything to spoil. I can bring everything down to you."
Dean purses his lips. "Wanna break the news to Sammy for me?"
decided—"
"What?" Dean asks.
you?" Castiel hisses, leaning up and pushing Dean back by—well, by his face. "Dean, are you out of—"
it is.
"What a fuckin' question," Dean mutters, tilting his head down with a sigh. "Like, not physically? Just shit we don't ever talk about? Something that'll piss me off and get me ready to fight?"
"No," Cas says, clearing his throat. He drops Dean's arms entirely and backs off, leaning out of reach before Dean can figure out how to work his arms again and grab onto him. "You need a shower. I need to… I have this—other matter to attend to. I'll be back, and I'll contact you to stay in touch."
"Thank you. I will...stick it out, as you said."
"Mm, good," Cas rumbles, a hint of smugness seeping into his expression. He flicks his gaze over Dean, slow about it, like he's savoring it. "That's good to know."
me?! How can you be so goddamn smart and so fucking
Castiel narrows his eyes. "Not even metaphorically?"
Dean sits the trashcan aside and waves Cas off lazily, lips curling up. "Don't worry about it. I don't mind. I mean, just, the cup was—we got more, so."
"You never know until you try.
"Yeah, it was—it was good," Dean mumbles, his gaze flicking down to Cas' mouth. It looks so inviting now. Fuck. "I, uh, slept
Dean swallows. "Yeah, man. You can—you can come in. I've got something to show you anyway. Come look at this."
like a very normal message to send someone at almost midnight. It reads:
"Love you?" Cas asks, his voice softening, and Dean manages a very tiny, very stiff nod. "That's like asking why the world's tilted a little. There are countless explanations, but when it comes down to it, some things just are, and we're better off for it. We'd never know the seasons without that tilt, and I'd never know love without you."
Claire hums. "Yeah, and I want world hunger to disappear. Life sucks, people are hungry everywhere, and Dean Winchester will sustain multiple injuries if he breaks your fragile heart."
Dean jolts against the counter, his elbow knocking into the side of it, yanking him out of his own head. Well, obviously Zoey doesn't find interest in all those things because she doesn't know half of them. Whatever. It's probably his lips, or something.
Dean narrows his eyes. "Okay, either you and I had two entirely different conversations last night, or you're just fucking with me."
"Never once in my life have I ever been scared of Cas. Not even for a second."
Things get really, really still within him. His mind is quiet. His feelings are muted, numb. There's just a low thrum of anger and determination that exists in his every inhale and every exhale. Their options are limited, and something's got to give.
Dean's chest feels tight. "Reckon it is. Gotta wake up every day and remember it."
"I'm done. I'm just—" Sam shakes his head and tosses his hands up, turning around and marching out of the room, muttering under his breath something that sounds like
"Yeah, I'll read it," Dean agrees, lips twitching. "I'll make Cas read it, too. Gimme one sec. Cas!"
"And there were a lot of times it nearly ended with us dead," Dean points out, eyebrows raised.
"I did it wrong. Sorry, I was trying to, uh, keep it...not that," Dean confesses. "I didn't know it would
of you."
"Not...particularly," Castiel ventures cautiously. "I would prefer Dean to go uninjured."
"I like to talk about her sometimes," Sorine announces at one point, her feet dangling near the exhaust pipe. She swallows harshly enough for it to be audible, and her nails click against the aluminum can between her knees. "Other times, I can't even really—I can barely think about her. I never know what it's going to be. I don't get a choice in the matter, and I don't think a lot of people get that."
"What?" Cas asks, still oh so confused, clearly not having any idea at all.
"We had reconciled. I missed you," Cas murmurs.
Cas looks to the side, his throat bobbing again as he takes yet another step back. "I'm sorry, Dean."
"Well, I wouldn't
There are moments when it becomes too much.
Cas blinks at him, and Dean blinks back, and then they're both dipped into awkward silence. Dean is just as startled that he said that as Cas is. It feels like they just skipped a few steps, abruptly arriving at the resolution before they've even fully identified the problem. Dean didn't even think that through.
Cas blinks at him, reaching up to catch the mixtape against his chest, staring at Dean with slick lips, deliciously rumpled. Dean glares at him, then marches away before Cas can say a goddamn word.
"You don't have to sit all the way across the room, Cas. You do know that, right? You can sit next to me. I won't bite," Dean offers with what seems to be forced casualness.
"I...I don't really know," Dean admits awkwardly. Guilt is starting to gnaw at his insides. Shit.
"I actually do wanna tell you something really important, something I—I should have said a long time ago," Dean murmurs.
"I understand existing better when doing it with you," Cas tells him, soft and tender, meaning it because he's helpless to it, "but this you. It can
Sam takes a deep breath, then slowly lets it out. "You're not the only one who lost people, Dean. I lost them, too. Jack lost them, too. He didn't even get them. And I—I know now that it's different for you when it comes to Cas, but I've
The day passes sluggishly, and Dean's thankful for that. He wants to feel every second of the time spent together. He wants to not waste a moment, because Jack deserves so many more than he's gotten.
Sam sighs. "When are you gonna stop letting him be afraid of you?"
"It means he's not getting a full glass of wine, and I think he should get a full eight hours of sleep, and I wish he'd stop being so hard on himself sometimes."
Dean laughs softly and ducks in to kiss him.
expand. He blinks at Dean, then recoils back. "What? Dean, no, it's—it is
and good. "Now me."
There's not a lot of ash to gather. What remains of Cas' has already started to be swept away by the wind, traveling far and wide. Cas always did like to fly, Dean thinks. He'd like that he still gets to do it.
Cas has been on their side, with them, for so long now. Dean trusts in that, because that's how it's supposed to be. This isn't right. It feels
teaching him to be crazy about your car, like you. Come on, you're bad enough, especially about a car that probably drives like a boat."
"Mhm," Cas confirms, sighing in faint exasperation. He shakes his head. "He's very excitable, especially about the library. He volunteers to read to the children on the weekends. I've been told that he's exceptionally good with them, but I suppose he would be. He is in their age range."
Sorine clears her throat and opens her eyes. "I really did try to give her my heart, you know. As soon as I found out that she'd probably never make it to see the top of the transplant list, I asked if they'd take mine. They wouldn't go for it, and Levina said I was crazy. But I just thought—I figured it'd be good, you know? Every time she'd see her reflection, her heart would race. Every time she'd smile, it would skip a beat. And—and that would be me. She'd always have me. That would be enough, that's what I said, because the way it happened… I don't get to always have her. I didn't get to have her at all, not really."
"I have to rinse it," Cas reminds him, holding up the glass and tossing him a smile over his shoulder, looking a lot more energetic than Dean does. "I will be right back."
When Benny pulls back, he glances over Dean's shoulder, and he chuckles. "Hot-wings doesn't look very happy right now."
"And what? You like his better, or something?" Dean asks, sounding vaguely affronted.
is a blush. His lips quirk up.
room," Castiel feels compelled to point out, his fingers flexing. Maybe Dean will just leave before this all gets out of hand. He doesn't want Dean to go, though. He never does.
"Hey!" Dean barks, his voice rough and sharp. "What the hell are you
Except, as he goes to leave, Dean says, "And where the fuck do you think you're going? You can help wash dishes like the rest of us worker bees, now that you are one. You wash, I'll rinse."
Dean thinks incredulously, staring around the living room with his eyebrows raised. There's not really a mess. It's all just...clutter.
Not this shit again. Cas!"
He has the phantom flutters in his chest like he's about to take flight, that instinctive need to get away, but it's only a missing limb that provides him no help now. He is human and he goes nowhere. All he can do is stand there and stare at Jack, knowing he cannot go because he is human, knowing that Jack could bring him if he truly wanted to. Perhaps even through death, though Jack has no desire to interfere. Castiel would agree to it, he has to know that, but it will never happen.
He doesn't say anything else. He doesn't cry. He doesn't leave for a very, very long time. He just stands there, eyes closed, feeling the breeze and feeling numb all the way through.
"You can barely keep it together," Sam says gently, treading carefully but determined to continue on nonetheless. "Look, I know what this feels like, okay? I know
"Stop being nice to me." Dean swivels his head, peeking up at Castiel with his cheek still pressed to the bar. He swallows, chewing the inside of his bottom lip. "Are you happy, Cas?"
Dean sighs. "No, I meant Indiana Jones. Duh, Sam, obviously I meant Cas."
Castiel urges. "Just stop it. I am
"No, there was no wedding."
to calm him down, especially in light of the last conversation they had. Dean's an asshole, but he's not
"I can help you forget about him, at least for a little while," Lee whispers, thumb pushing against his pulse point, the words exhaling over Dean's neck to leave a trail of goosebumps. "Just like we used to do. Ain't no need to talk. You remember how it was?"
"Dean," Castiel whispers, the name escaping in a fragile rasp, like a frozen bubble, too crystalized to pop. He fucking
"You gotta let me go, if we're gonna go," Dean points out breathlessly, turning his head, seeking and seeking,
"Some form of retirement is in my future, that's for sure, but not for a while. I'm glad you're liking it, though." Sam flashes him a broad grin. "I could do with a vacation every now and again, maybe."
"What's up, kid?"
You're not, great, cool. But it'd be okay if you were, right?"
Okay, so maybe—maybe—
When he does, he blinks out at the man standing on the other side, looking just as startled as him. He looks fairly normal overall—shorter than Dean by an inch or two, probably in his late thirties, blond hair and blue eyes and a strong jaw.
giving her a car, and you're not
So, that's great.
This is immediately a mistake.
that, but then it was, and I—I—"
after, and
There's nothing. There's no one. Dean swallows and thinks, his mind racing, eyes flicking back and forth like the foliage will open up and spit out answers. Or, better yet, spit out
Jesus Christ. His head is spinning.
"Mmph," is Cas' muffled response, his eyebrows drawing together as he pulls back to try to escape the likely very irritating finger poking his nose.
Dean waves him off and starts tugging on Sam's shirt to get him to stand up. "Yeah, yeah, whatever."
"Oh, shut up," Claire grumbles, then heaves a very loud sigh. "Cas says hi, by the way."
Dean's voice only wavers slightly when he says, "Hundred percent positive," but what quivers in his tone is not doubt. It's suspense.
"Oh, Sammy's coming with me. His hands ain't broke." Dean grins and reaches down to smack Sam on the shoulder. "Seriously, Cas, it
Cas flicks his gaze between Henry and Dean for a second, then recognition brightens his eyes. All at once, there's a tiny smile at the corner of his lips as he looks at Henry. "Thank you, but Dean will handle it. Apparently, he insists on it. Will you and your wife be alright through the storm?"
Sam sighs, nodding. "Okay, so what about slowing down? You thought about it?"
Dean," Castiel declares with a gusty sigh, looking up at the ceiling. He has no faith left to beg anyone for patience, outside of his faith in Dean, and he's surely not going to grant it to him—that much is obvious. "Just assume that at any point in all the time I've known you, I would have gladly had sex with you. A decade ago, yesterday, tomorrow, and a decade from now."
Dean doesn't say anything in response. He can't.
Dean glances back towards Cas, who is following the other Dean around with his cloudy gaze, something fond and bitter rolled into one in the twist of his lips. Dean feels his heart catch against his ribs, because he's been thinking…
"Do you often speak of a father who did better? Do you ever mention a life without pain, or one without ever having gone to Hell?" Castiel murmurs, cleaning the last plate and passing it to Dean.
"No!" Dean blurts out before he can stop himself, then quieter, "No. It's—I don't mind. I know you're just—I know. It's okay."
"Okay," Castiel repeats.
Cas' breath punches out of him, stuttering, and he opens his eyes. He looks down at Dean like he's the one on his knees, actually, his gaze worshipful and reverent. Awed. Fully fucking blown away. If Dean could grin with a dick in his mouth, he would.
Dean shook his head and gave Cas a thin smile. "Nothing."
"Wait!" Lassiter called. "I wanted to talk to you two!"
Castiel looked impressed, then asked, “Can you handle a gun?”
"Okay, so what if I am? That doesn't change anything. You're in love with Juliet. Everyone can see that. So what if I...like...you? So what if I hate watching you be so desperately in love with her? So what if I just want to be your friend, and I keep messing up? So what if I can't help but be a jerk to you, no matter how hard I try not to?" He turned away again. "Forget it. Forget I said anything."
“He’s just The God around here,” Castiel said, not amused. “And you don’t get in touch with him. No one does except the underboss, the consigliere, and the caporegimes.”
"I swear to all things holy, if you say demon, I will literally punch you in the face, Spencer."
He was suddenly back at his house, sitting on the couch. His dad was in front of him, explaining why his mom wasn’t there. Shawn refused to listen, and he went up to his room. He didn’t answer when his dad knocked on the door. He didn’t eat. He didn’t leave his room for days.
Pierre set the bowl down and looked toward the door of his apartment. His eyes went from completely black to their normal blue. "Time to cause some chaos."
Dean looked over at his brother. "That makes even less sense. Why would a demon go through the trouble of breaking into an art museum, just to leave behind some sulfur and not steal anything?"
"Ooookay." Shawn sat down on a couch. "Does this have to do with your undying love for me?" He joked.
Sam was giving Shawn the death glare so hard, that Dean knew if looks could kill, Shawn would be a dead man. Dean shook his head and put a hand on his hip. "Of course he's not telling the truth. If you want, you can call our supervisor yourself."
Suddenly a black '67 Chevy Impala rolled up to the scene, and two guys in black suits stepped out.
While Woody was talking, Shawn noticed that Sam was whispering to Dean again. He stepped closer to hear what they were saying, and he caught the word "vampire".
Dean sighed. "He's out on his morning run or whatever. I'll call him and tell him what we're doing." Dean seemed to realize right then how unnecessarily close he and Cas were standing, and he couldn't help but glance down at the angel's lips for a second before looking away.
"Santa Barbara is the self-proclaimed 'Murder Capital of the World'. I think we should check it out; see if there's anything demonic." Sam looked back at his computer.
Shawn looked around and saw that the other two Siths were dead now, and Sam was cleaning off a dagger of his own that was similar to Dean's. Meanwhile, Gus was hiding behind Castiel, and Castiel was touching the body of one of the Siths with his foot, as if to check if it was still alive.
As soon as Woody saw them, he gave them a big smile. "Hello again! You're new," he said to Cas.
"But Lassiter is my head detective!" Chief said. "You can't just exclude him and his partner!"
Lassie grabbed his arm as if it was in pain. He frowned and rolled up the sleeve of his shirt, revealing what looked like a welt, but was too precise of a shape to be just an accident.
Sam nodded and took out his phone.
Lassiter sneered at him. "Wouldn't you like to know?"
"Zachariah," Cas said firmly. "We need to talk."
"That's up to us to find out, since you two aren't hunters," Dean said. "Sammy, call Cas. I got some suspicions about the friendly neighborhood coroner."
(See the end of the chapter for
“That was weird.”
“Great.” Zachariah smiled and snapped his fingers, and everything went dark.
Shawn stood back and watched Lassie pace back and forth. He didn’t know what was going on, but he decided he would have to talk to Sam and Dean about it. Maybe they knew what was going on. That’s when he remembered that Dean and Castiel were still facing off against Zachariah.
“Lassie who are you talking to?” Shawn asked.
Lassiter's face paled. "Noted."
"Well, we have to try. Come on, we should go now."
“How do I get in touch with The Godfather? Or whatever you call him.”
"Feds?" Carlton asked.
"Well," Sam shrugged, "I dunno. An artifact maybe?"
He shook his head as if to clear it. “Wow. What a complex monkey-brain,” he said in a distinct Zachariah voice.
Shawn rolled his eyes. “I didn’t even know you were here until I came to tell you this fantastic news.”
Also if you want to add me on tumblr, my username is @destiel-its-natural-habitat
"Well they don't really get paid for it, but yes," Shawn answered.
"Oh, I'm fully aware. Which is why I want them to come!"
Lisa stopped the video and turned to Carlton and Shawn. "That's it. We don't have anything else other than that."
Dean shook his head. “Other than that. I feel like something really important happened yesterday.”
Dean nodded slowly, trying to take it all in. “So...when do I get my first order?”
"First of all, it's Castiel, to you," Dean said sharply. "And he's an angel."
"I don't hate cheeseburgers, Shawn. Just the bacon cheeseburger."
Fifteen minutes later, they were all crowded in the Coroner's room around the body. Woody walked in and smiled. As soon as Sam and Dean saw him, they both gave him intense looks of hatred.
Cain seemed to consider this. “You realize they would take away all memories of these past few days, right? You wouldn’t remember...you wouldn’t remember any of the moments.”
"Don't 'Look, Lassie' me! You've been lying to us all since day one! How are we supposed to trust you?!" Lassie turned away and scoffed. "I can't believe I trusted a child in an adult body."
“I can’t believe I’m saying this right now, but you don’t have to do this,” Dean said. “We could have Cas wash your memories of us and Zach ever being here. You could go back to your life as a detective.”
"Great idea! I'll go with you!"
"By the way, do you happen to know where Lassie is?" He asked.
"Zachariah," Dean all but growled. "Why are you here?"
"Werewolves?"
Sam frowned. “I’m pretty sure we were on a Baobhan Sith case in Texas.”
After Woody finished speaking, Dean spoke up. "We would like to work on this case with the Psychic and his pal."
The next morning, Dean called Cas almost as soon as he woke up.
"So. Um. I know things have been awkward between us," Shawn said.
“They’re ranks. The Underboss is basically second in command. Consigliere is the advisor. Corporegimes are the people who command the soldiers.”
When Dean came back to the Cafe the next day, there were significantly more customers. He guessed Fridays were the international Cafe day. Castiel didn’t give any sign that he recognized him, so Dean sat at the counter again and ordered another black coffee.
"Maybe it's looking for something."
"Does he always leave like that?" Shawn tried to joke around, but that probably freaked him out more than the Siths did.
Suddenly there was a new voice. "Brothers! How wonderful to see you both!"
"Gabriel," Cas said. "What are you doing here?"
Sam and Dean were sitting in a restaurant in a small town in Nevada. Dean was reading the local newspaper while stuffing a burger in his face, and Sam was scrolling through his computer with nothing but a salad in front of him.
Shawn's eyes widened. "Dude," he hissed at Gus. "I think those two are the FBI!"
Alright guys I definitely completely redid this chapter and deleted the other one so read this before I post the next chapter! :D
Kudos and Comments are always appreciated!
Zachariah glared at Cas. “You think I know?” He looked back at Lassiter. “Whe are you here, Cain?”
"Oh, shut up, Sammy." Dean grabbed his keys and walked out of the room, Sam and Cas following him.
“Mornin’ Sammy.”
That’s when Lassie decided to arrive, and he had a blade of his own. Well, sort of a blade. It was more like the jawbone of a donkey, with teeth on it and everything. It kinda grossed Shawn out, if he was being honest.
Lassie nodded with uncertainty. "I think so."
"Las Vegas, man!"
Dean nodded again and thought about all the guns stocked up in the trunk of his car. “I own a few,” he said casually.
“Lassie, wait!”
"Well there's something called a Baobhan Sith. It's a monster from Scottish lore. Apparently it appears as a beautiful woman who seduces her victim before drinking their blood. We could be dealing with that."
Dean smiled at her. "Yes! It is. We were just hoping to talk to the coroner about some last minute things, just to seal up the case."
Castiel narrows his eyes, clearly not believing him, but he thankfully lets it go. "I do not know how it is, Dean, you know that."
"Shut up," Dean snaps, glaring at him over his shoulder as he pours Cas some of his cheap wine. He jerks his head towards the fridge. "Grab us a couple of beers. You think Eileen would want wine, or is beer good for her?"
Dean thinks, because it does. It just has to. Cas deserves that. Hell, they all do, but Cas has given just as much as the rest of 'em. He's lost and lost and lost, too. He needs this win. He's
Fucking why?
Jack half-turns, gesturing to a plate behind him on the stove. "Want some bacon?"
"How is Jack?" Sam asks. "You've seen him?"
"Have at it," Dean says with a snort, feeling lazy and warm and, ridiculously enough, very safe.

"Are we stopping?" Cas croaks.

"Keep pushing it, and Cas might actually give into the urge, and see, that just ain't gonna sit right with me," Dean tells him, which is the closest to saying he actually cares as he'll ever get.
"They already know," Jack murmurs. "They're here, outside the kitchen. And you cannot come with me. You know why. It's okay, Castiel."

"That looks like a lump of charcoal."
Castiel's eyebrows furrow. "Is it safe?"
with the Dean he's come to be as of late.
"I love you, Dean," Castiel murmurs, and he does.
"Oh, right." Dean relaxes slightly, seeming to take comfort from the words. Castiel supposes it's a comforting thing to be reminded while you're in the arms of a man and your father is John Winchester. Dean swallows and tugs at him. "Okay, do it again."
"And yours?"
Castiel trusts that Dean would stop him in whatever way necessary if he needed to. But this—he's outright asking Castiel to silence the storm in his mind, and if he's absolutely sure, Castiel will do his best. He genuinely can't refuse Dean anything, but this only works if Dean is sure.
"Sammy,
There's really no finesse to how it happens. Cas just kisses him with so much fucking intensity, and then he reaches down to grab Dean's hips, jerking them fast, guiding him into rocking along to the motion. It's hot and heavy, and Dean is making these shocked noises that all sound like approval to his ears, sparks lighting up in every nerve.
"I draw the line at cats. We ain't getting a goddamn cat. Well, Eileen's kinda like a—"
Dean scoffs. "Shut the hell up."
"I saw you," she says quietly. "As we were leaving, I saw you just… I mean, this place clearly means something to you. I'm sorry we fucked it up. I really do want to help you clean up, if you'll let me."
didn't make you happy?"
Castiel resists the urge to curl his lip when he thinks of Crowley. "Sometimes, I could not tell if my dislike for Crowley existed out of jealousy, or simply because I never liked him, or both." Cas holds up a hand when Dean's mouth drops open. "Before you add your comments, I'm not insinuating anything between you and Crowley—though, I am aware that he likely took advantage of your time as a demon. That being said, Crowley had feelings for you and absolutely no shame in expressing them, complicated as they may have been. I'm not suggesting he was in love with you, but I wouldn't count it out. He wouldn't have turned away the offer to have sex with you, at least."
Dean's face twitches, and he stares at Sam. "You think I waited this long?"
and his mouth must taste like morning and coffee, but Dean wants so badly to lean forward and kiss him anyway.
Dean wakes up the next morning and caves like a stack of cards in a storm. He opens his eyes, and that's it.
Second of all, Cas has no goddamn right dressing up like a fucking doctor and further ruining any chances Dean might've ever had of ignoring just how gone on him he is. Not that he had much going for him in that department anyway, but
"Well, they are working, Cas," Dean points out.
"He's dead," Dean says flatly.
So, Dean's plans to have a nice evening out are very promptly dashed by Zoey, who matches him drink for drink without swaying in her seat at all. They still do have fun, admittedly, talking in the way strangers do when they have stories to tell that they don't want to talk about to anyone who knows them. Unsurprisingly, they talk about sex, because apparently both of them like sex a lot and have quite the different repertoire of stories to tell.
"How is it?"
Jack's back the next time that Cas goes to work, so Dean spends those five hours with him. They watch TV for a few hours, and then Jack asks if he can drive Baby, but Dean's in no mood to leave the house. His compromise is taking Jack outside and letting him get under Baby's hood, teaching him how to maintain her, how to take care of her.
"I didn't," Dean confesses gruffly.
"Dean, she's in her early twenties now."
"Sexual orientation matters very little to me, and I have no opinions based on the ridiculous structure of society that reflects on the subject, oftentimes negatively. I am very aware that it is okay to be gay, Dean," Cas says, his eyebrows furrowed.
that shit hurts. To know that he—that he—
Dean scrambles away from the desk with the mixtape because he knows that look in Sam's eye. He's all little brother right now, and oh god, this does not bode well for Dean.
"As soon as Jack takes me," Cas tells him, his voice hushed, apologetic. "He mentioned that he hoped to visit with you and Sam before we went and at least tell you both of what he'd achieved. He knew I would come here, but neither of us expected that you would be waiting when I did."
It just says:
"Cas," Dean murmurs, "can I ask you something?"
Lee's eyebrows fly up. "You mean to tell me that he got you in his bed and didn't fall a little bit in love with you? Now, that just don't add up. I'm speaking from experience here, ya know."
"Yeah, well, she was a teenager when I met her, so she'll be a teenager forever," Dean says, snorting at the mental image of Claire's scowl if she heard him say that. He remembers being young, getting annoyed every time older hunters would treat him like some kid, and here he is, doing the same thing. The cycle of life, he imagines. Happens to the best of 'em. He'd bet if his Bobby was still alive, he'd still call Dean
"To live to see freedom?" Dean exhales deeply and shakes his head. "Everything. I'd give everything."
Sorine chuckles weakly. "Yeah. She knew, though. Her mom died a little after she was born with the same thing, and she told me at the end that she knew she'd go the same way. Somehow, she knew."
That's practically a blink in Dean Winchester driving time. Jesus, Cas is so goddamn
Sam presses on, "yes to the witch thing. It's something I'm interested in. So, yes."
Dean holds off for as long as he can take it, too much going on in him and around him for his resolve to last very long. He breaks and starts babbling, like all the blocks that's kept him from saying everything he's wanted to have come crumbling down all at once.
"It does," Castiel admits.
"No, no,
"He provoked me," Cas mutters, and the vampire certainly
Really, though, Kaia's alright. They have somewhat of a shaky history, considering Dean once put a gun to her head, but she apparently doesn't hold it against him, which is nice of her. He apologizes anyway about it, because he knows he should, and she gives him a small smile while simply accepting it, no muss and no fuss. He had thought she was shy, but either Claire has brought her out of her shell a bit, or she feels more at home in her own skin, because she turns out to be really funny and easy to spend time with, so effortlessly
Dean shrugs a little helplessly. "I dunno. I mean, that's what it looks like, because the second I tried, I thought of him. I just...feel bad, I guess. And listen, that just ain't like me, Zoey."
The first week rolls into the second, and it doesn't change that much. Dean mows the lawn. On Sunday, he goes with Cas to get groceries again, chuckling when people at the farmer's market comment on him coming back. He learns how to fix the wiring for the fan in their room, so Cas doesn't have to struggle with it anymore. He fucks it up bad enough that the fan doesn't work at all one night, and Cas genuinely doesn't get a wink of sleep, so Dean stays up with him in solidarity. He has it fixed by the next night, and despite his exhaustion, Cas looks like he wants to kiss him again.
how hypocritical that makes him, but he can't help it.
"You mean in a sexual setting."
Well, that's okay, too."
"Right," Dean rasps. "That. It was—I was supposed to come here and make you answer a question, then force you to, um, say you don't want me to my face. That was the plan, originally, but—"
Speaking of Lee, he comes into the bathroom behind Dean a few minutes later. Dean glances up in the mirror, in the middle of washing his hands, and he raises his eyebrows in question because Lee isn't heading for one of the stalls. No, Lee is just leaning back against the door, his hand wrapped around the handle, a lazy grin on his lips.
"Funny, though," Claire says cheerfully.
Three months, three weeks, and six days—one day out from four months—after Castiel comes back, Dean wakes up in the middle of the night with a jerk, flailing out of a dream that he has been trying to outrun for a long time now. It's all for no reason, however, because he doesn't remember the dream at all. He just wakes up with an odd sense of panic and the sudden urge to make sure Castiel is still here.
"He fell for you," Sorine murmurs.
"Claire," Kaia says, shooting her a look.
It's a joke.
Cas tilts his head a little. "And me?"
Rubbing a hand over his mouth, Dean wavers at the doorway. Stop? Cas is asking him to stop?
hard not to, or to stop.
He won't, however. He forces himself to inhale, then exhale. It does little good, but he won't give Dean the satisfaction. Whatever he's doing—whatever the reason he's outright goading him—Castiel wants no part of it. The only thing he wants is—
Dean doesn't say anything for a while, because he needs his coffee. To get through this, he
Yellow is such a cheerful color, Dean thinks. It promotes happiness, if not outright inviting it in, if not a representation for it already existing. Flowers and birds are yellow, nature's way of smiling. Bananas are sweet, buses for kids a stand-out color like a beacon of innocence, and bees make sure people breathe. The sun is depicted as yellow, a bright thing, warm and alive.
Castiel gets the feeling that he could ask for anything in that moment, and Dean would bend over backwards to get it for him. His mind turns to places it shouldn't, places he's appalled at himself for even going, and the knot twists in his chest like a harsh reminder. He has to stop. So far today, Dean has been kind to him, and Castiel loves him so much. No matter how or why Dean has awakened his libido—that was never actually asleep to begin with, really—Castiel won't let it control him.
Despite how Dean's only
It's weird to miss the afterimages of someone on top of just missing them, but Dean does. When he leaves, he misses the pieces of Cas that he has left. He starts taking a flower with him when he goes, holding them in his pocket, putting them on his nightstand until they inevitably die, too. Every time one does, it's like watching Cas die all over again.
"But you have to," Sam says, leaning back as he drops his hand, an apology written in every line of his face when Dean opens his eyes to look. "Loss like this… It'll make you waste away if you're not careful, and I can't—Dean, I can't let that happen. I

specifically—he is breathtaking.
Dean's heading right for him the
he thinks,
In the end, the perfect solution is breakfast for dinner. Pancakes are simple, and he even digs into Sam's stash of fresh fruit to steal some blueberries, to give that option as well. He has chocolate chips hidden away for a rainy day—meaning they're stashed away from Cas, who enjoys them, just waiting for the next time Dean has a horror movie marathon. It's a little bit of a sacrifice to use it, but chocolate chip pancakes are too good of an opportunity to pass up, really.
you…?"
"I know," Cas assures him, though he also wonders if perhaps they did, but Dean just rewrote those memories as well, "but you two did share a bond. You cared for him very much. I...didn't like it."
"Good morning, Dean," Cas says as he steps into the kitchen, and then he comes to a screeching halt and does a double-take. He squints. "It's only just five in the morning. Why are you awake, and why are you not upset about it?"
He tries not to let what Claire said get to him, mostly because he's distantly aware that she only lashed out because she cares about Castiel. It makes sense that she would, especially if she believes he's heartbroken, which he's not. He isn't.
"Oh," Castiel says. "Okay, Dean. But you're not—you don't—"
They fall into the room together, Dean still chuckling because he can't really stop, Cas humming in approval and amusement as he works Dean out of his shirt. He's so much better at getting Dean undressed than Dean is at getting him out of his ridiculous amount of clothes. Jesus, why the fuck does he have so
"Anything," Cas murmurs, pressing in close after tossing the shirt away. His hands—broad and hot and soft—press against Dean's sides, dragging around like he's cupping his ribs. "You can have anything, Dean. There's nothing I would not give you. You only need to ask."
"Did any of them make you do that?" Cas asks with a pointed look down at Dean's pants.
Again, I am sorry. Additionally, I did make up that song for this fic. So, there's that.
"It's slow," Sorine says. "No medicine in the world can cure it. You either see the other side of it, or you don't. And that's—that's all there is."
"Of course you did," Dean mutters, turning his face into the pillow a little, the rest of his words coming out muffled with exhausted sarcasm. "Why wouldn't you? It's stupid, so
"Could be a while."
"Kinda," Dean admits, abruptly remembering Sam's offer. "Sam kinda had this idea, and I maybe kinda like it. Dunno how it would work out, but I figured you'd have something sensible to say about it."
And, stupidly, Dean blurts out the very first thing that crosses his mind, which is, "Well, you're here, aren't you? So I already do."
"Long as he keeps his hands to himself, I won't. So, what's up? You're not calling just to check in. I can hear it in your voice. Your halo fall off, or something?"
Sam's jaw goes tight, gaze darting between Dean and Castiel, and maybe he is no longer a safe alternative. That remains to be seen. "Okay, what the hell is going on? There's obviously something wrong between you two."
into each other's skin.
Dean scrubs his hand over his mouth, then under his eyes, hating the moisture there. "Right now. Don't wait for the right moment. There's not a right one, there's just the
When he gets home, he's worked himself up into a pretty big panic. He comes barreling in and tosses his bag on the table, just as Cas is coming into the room. "Hey!" he calls out.
he's talking to. He has just enough mind to make sure it isn't Shawn—a sort of instinctive thing he does without meaning to—and then he stops paying attention at all. He's just watching to fill Castiel in on whatever he misses, that's it.
Dean holds up one hand off the wheel in silent surrender. "I'm not, I promise. You do you, Sabrina. No judgement here. Pretty sure your little stumble into Hogwarts doesn't have to end in a big ol' battle now that Dumbledore has been taken out of the picture."
"Okay," Sam says softly, his throat bobbing as he looks to the side and blinks hard. He nods jerkily at Dean. "I'll spread your ashes where you spread his."
For a long time, he smooths out wrinkles on the curtain. He knows—he
"Precisely," Castiel agrees, the knot in his chest only growing more tangled by the moment. He flicks the water off his fingers and leaves without another word. He has nothing else to say.
Again, it's lucky he doesn't have the space to be mortified right now, because there's something kinda pathetic about how his mouth waters at the sight. Drool quite literally comes out of the corners of his mouth, slipping past Cas' fingers, and there's another distant slurping noise that Dean's brain has decided doesn't come from himself.
"Bite me, kettle," Dean mutters, passing him his glass and Jack's kool-aid, as well as one of the beers for Eileen. "Listen, Sam's gonna send us his codex to look over. Reading material before bed, and hey, remind me to run something by you later."
"You don't have—" Dean snaps his mouth shut and freezes like a startled deer when Cas abruptly leans across the space between them, reaching out to catch his face in one hand, tipping it up so their mouths will meet in the middle.
Dean thinks fuzzily, his hands flying out to complete the task he's been given. It's a little easier from the front like this, even with him splitting his attention between sucking on Cas' fingers and tugging his pants and underwear off. This is what gets him to open his eyes finally, just the feeling of Cas' dick being revealed. His eyes only open halfway, like he's coming out of a daze, but they immediately latch onto his target.
When Cas tries to give the mixtape back, Dean sidesteps the idea of heartbreak and chalks it up to Cas not knowing how gifts work.
"I—yeah, for sure. Definitely. Jesus. So, Anna—I mean, shit,
is true, but it's not like she doesn't already know that. There's nothing to say about death, not really. There never is. So he doesn't say anything at all.
me. You had every opportunity to change your own situation. If you were unhappy and wished to see me, or talk to me more frequently, you could have said so. You never did." He draws in a quiet breath, then slowly releases it, and Dean can feel him getting closer. Too close. "And, as I've said to you before...I left, but you didn't stop me."
He goes through the motions, speaking when spoken to, making sure to keep space between them, distracting himself only a bit with other things. Yet, he is still too aware of Dean. He knows it when Dean approaches him and has to force himself to ignore it. That plan is ripped right from him when Dean rips the book right out of his hands.
worth the break in routine."
"Well, you ain't no walk in the park either, pal," Dean says, clicking his tongue.
"He's fine," Cas tells him, his gaze dropping, then slowly crawling back up.
Dean's pretty sure his brain whites-out, and in fact, he thinks he goes blind for a second. He freezes in place, needing a second to reboot, and it's only Cas' frustrated groan that starts him back up again. His voice cracks when he says, "Whatever you want."
"I missed that, too," Cas rasps, his voice wrecked, but not to the point that the teasing amusement threaded through isn't audible.
Dean jerks so quickly to motion him to a stop that it would be slightly amusing if there surely wasn't an insult in there somewhere. His eyes are a little wide, and he makes an odd choking sound as he rushes to say, "No, it's fine. Keep it. Whatever."
It's like a revelation in his head, sparks lighting up and going off. Fireworks.
Castiel ignores Dean for his own sanity, moving over to the chair and focusing entirely on Jack. "You're staying?"
"Of course, Dean."
He'll have to get up and get the details eventually, but he's dreading it. His head is
Sam is kneeling on the deck, the woman he saved tucked against his side, shivering but alive. Dean meets his brother's eyes and has no idea what to make of the expression on Sam's face. He doesn't know it right now, but Dean will make that same, exact expression when he sees Sam drink demon blood for the first time.
if I'm truly happy! I won't be anyway. Take me with you."
"Well," Castiel murmurs, "we'll need to again."
"No," Dean murmurs, averting his gaze just as Cas glances up at him. "But you could get into my head, right? Mind-whammy me somehow, I mean."
Did he know?
"My intro?"
"Mm, I see." Cas looks faintly amused, shaking his head as he moves further into the kitchen. "I thought I heard someone up. I honestly didn't expect it to be you and certainly not in such high spirits."
The thing is, Dean is always so pissed off at Cas. Frustrated with him. Annoyed by him. Expecting things from him. But there's also that trust, along with a persistent fondness, among other things that he doesn't dare give a name to. If he doesn't name 'em and doesn't acknowledge 'em, then they're not there and they have no power over him.
"I, uh—" Dean pauses to clear his throat, coughing a little. His mouth is so dry. "I kinda can't, um."
Talking about Cas is either a hit or miss with Dean. Sometimes it's okay, and Dean will talk about him with no problems. Other times, Dean shuts down entirely, or cries, or flies off into a rage, or just goes and hides in his room for a few days. Fortunately for Sam, it's the former right now.
"Monopoly?" Jack asks, eyes lighting up.
"Yeah, sure," Dean mumbles, hating the way the tension creeps back up on them, crowding them. He follows Cas into the living room, taking one end of the couch while Cas takes the other, and it still feels too close. And not close enough.
