He’s not thinking at all when he raises his right hand and makes a sort of swoopy falling gesture, and, sure, Tony doesn’t exactly have a reputation for being sensitive but even he knows that was bad.
He sounds ridiculously sincere, a lot like Steve does sometimes (birds of a feather, and all that), and Tony has no more idea what to do with it than he does when it's Steve.
Steve laughs, the sound short and more than a little surprising. “Sorry,” he says instantly. “I’m not- I’m just relieved-”
(He might not be at the L-word, not quite yet, but he can see it coming, now that he’s letting himself look.)
So why the fuck is JARVIS taking so long?
: I love it. The village is just lovely. I think I’ll enjoy visiting.
"It's Tony, Peggy," he reminds her gently, carefully. "Howard died over twenty years ago, remember?"
He sees the Winter Soldier when he closes his eyes, his imagination filling in details that the black and white CCTV footage doesn't. Tony has managed to zoom in and use lip reading software to decipher Howard's last words, but his mind plays them loud and live in Howard's voice, followed by the crunch of his skull on the steering wheel. He sees the Soldier's hands around Maria's throat, around
Pepper waits until he's helped himself to a few salmon nigiri and one of those daft little cups of hot sake before answering. "Bruce was just telling me about his afternoon in Barcelona," she explains.
"Fair," says Clint, passing Bruce one of the beers before sitting at the table and picking through the assortment of takeout containers. "Tasha'd be my first call for corpse disposal, too."
“Okay,” Tony repeats, bobbing up on his toes so he can press a kiss to Steve’s cheek. “Now, I really do have things to be doing, before Pep decides she needs to fly back from Miami to beat me into shape, and you should get back upstairs before your boy comes looking for you. Or, worse, Natasha does.”
Again, JARVIS doesn't jump to answering the way he's supposed to. "Sir, I really don't-"
“Best head down there, then,” he says reluctantly. “See if you can slow Thor down any, would you?”
In response to his obtuseness, Bucky reaches out, taking the mug from Steve’s hand and draining it, glaring at Steve the entire time.
Man, Sam could definitely get used to this whole
Tony's not answering his phone, and JARVIS doesn't offer to take a message.
"It hasn't yet, Sir," JARVIS says, and although he knows it does them both a disservice, Tony can't help but picture his namesake, the man who read him bedtime stories and patched up grazed knees and taught Tony every goddamn thing he knows about right and wrong. Edwin Jarvis may have been the inspiration for JARVIS, and his death was definitely what left the black hole that started Tony down the path to creating his AIs, but the man had layers Tony couldn't hope to code and the AI has grown far beyond anything Tony could ever have dreamed of. They're separate entities, only the name and the accent and the insubordinate loyalty in common, and yet Tony can't imagine his JARVIS with any other face.
Tony makes an effort to swing by the kitchen at least one meal a day, but either Steve and Barnes show up or neither of them do; even on the days Steve and Sam go running first thing in the morning, Barnes still waits for Steve to get back before he goes to breakfast.
"Tony," Steve says carefully, putting his untouched drink down on the nightstand before shifting to face him head on. "I'd rather you took all the time you needed, even if it means you not speaking to me for the rest of our lives." Tony grimaces at that, and Steve is quick to clarify. "Don't get me wrong, I'd hate it, and I really would miss you, but it matters more to me that you're okay than that you like me."
, a guess further supported by Steve's forcibly calm, "Whoa, pal, maybe don't swing that quite so hard."
She doesn't answer, not right away. Tony isn't sure if it's that she's thinking or if she's too busy putting the hurt on someone; she's not breathing any heavier than before and her voice is perfectly even when she does speak, but since he's talking to the Black Widow that really isn't any indication either way.
"I know, I know, I'm late," he says, not really making a whole lot of effort not to sound like the proverbial cat, surrounded by a handful of yellow feathers and the family bird suspiciously absent. Anyone who spent the night with Steve Rogers is entitled to a little smugness, and even if Tony's not announcing who he woke up next to this morning, he still gets to be damn smug about it. "I was out to all hours fighting fascists, I'm sure you know how it is."
"I can translate it," Tony answers, a little perplexed by her mentioning it, since he's never expressed any problems with foreign languages in the past. "Well, JARVIS can, but he's never minded giving me the credit in the past."
"You've known since then?" Steve asks.
[His primary purpose is, as ever, to protect Sir, from himself as much as from other people. JARVIS can hardly be blamed if doing so requires him to occasionally withhold information.]
He knows how he
"How long have we got?" Steve asks, jerking into motion, scooping up the few articles of clothing that have escaped from his duffle bag; he has to be ready when the jet gets here,
Despite this cripplingly logical argument, Stark remains silent, shaking his head just slightly. Not enough to mean
"Right, sure, but, in my defence, I was avoiding dealing with massive amounts of trauma when the giant rabbit happened."
, says the part of Steve's brain still capable of calm, rational thought. The list of things unresolved between them is a long one – how Tony's dealing with his parents' deaths and Bucky's part in them; Howard's possible involvement in the Winter Soldier project; why Tony decided now was the time to answer Steve's call; what it is they're doing together and whether Tony wants them to be more as much as Steve does – and they shouldn't be falling into bed together without at least acknowledging them.
He has to know Steve always checks with JARVIS before going to find him, but Steve still like that he’s essentially making a plan for them, even if it’s just a plan for Steve to spend the evening sat on the couch doodling while Tony works.
"And you said…?" Bruce prompts after a moment, as if it's not absolutely fucking obviously what Tony's response to that was going to be.
that wants to come out, because even if it's JARVIS and he almost certainly already knows how much Tony cares about this, he prefers to keep his emotional stupidity to himself. And he knows it
“Better,” Barnes says, then moves on to the really fucking complicated part of this conversation; Natalia might have ordered him to talk to Stark while Steve isn’t around, but there’s something else Barnes wants to discuss while he’s here. “Now, I need a favour.”
Stark looks up at him again, eyes narrowed, brandishing the spanner in his hand at him like the world’s most ill-advised threat. Ignoring the fact that threatening the Winter Soldier with anything is a piss poor idea, the thing is so tiny and delicate that Barnes himself would struggle to use it as a weapon. Hell, even Natalia would have a hard time of it, and Barnes is reasonably sure she once killed a man with a paper clip.
“Nah, I think she’s doing just fine,” says Barnes, smiling. Or, actually, he’s grinning, the most human expression Tony’s ever seen on him. He pushes away from his corner, shoulders thrown back, something almost cocky to his stride as he makes his way from the table to where Tony’s still leaning against the counter by the coffee machine.
No, Steve definitely isn’t asking permission. He just doesn’t want to come home to find his friend bleeding.
They should talk before they do this, Steve absolutely knows that, but the rational part of his mind is definitely not running the show right now.
Nathalie slides her oversized shades up to rest on top of her head before stepping inside, picking up a basket and following a zig-zag route around the grocery store. She’s already stocked up on non-perishables on her first few days in town – canned goods, flour, sugar, powdered milk, coffee, all those other boring things it'll be useful to have waiting in the cupboards next time she needs to get away from the city for a few days – so this trip is purely for things she
"Happily," Bruce says, and the conversation trails off as the three of them eat, Tony pausing every few mouthfuls to take another swig from his drink.
“So you won't do it for me, you won't do it for the world, and you won't do it to avenge your parents even though
"I said yes," Tony answers, carefully holding back the
Yeah. Tony’s proven to himself that he can be in the same room as Barnes without having a freakout, even if he wasn’t there all that long. Next step, catch Barnes when Steve is elsewhere, so that he can ask about the Howard situation.
Metal Man says he's not scared of Hulk.
Tony doesn't say anything, even if he doesn't actually expect Natasha to pick up (assuming this is actually her number, because there's no way she'd let Steve save anything under her actual name). It's good that he doesn't, because he so hates having to eat his words: the phone only rings three times before it's answered.
“Sucks, that,” he agrees, then gets busy with slathering his own bagel in cream cheese and digging in.
"Don't give me that look, Bruce, it wasn't my idea." Still, Tony's not actually all that offended by his scepticism, since his own reaction to Steve first suggesting it was every bit as disbelieving, with a healthy measure of surprise mixed in. "It was… Okay, the first time, it was after the thing with the sewer 'gators, a few months after me and Pepper broke up. You remember, Steve nearly lost a leg to one of them, and we got back all hyped up on adrenaline and relief, and it just- happened, Jesus, Bruce, you have no idea-"
“I’ve only just got you back,” he says, the words coming out slower but not actually any less desperately. “I didn’t want to make you uncomfortable, finding out this new thing about me.”
in his nightmares until the day he dies. "The problem is that I won't be brave enough to."
Tony frowns at it, then up at Steve, then back at the plate again. He doesn’t accept it, but he does pick up a single blueberry, dragging it through a pool of syrup before putting it in his mouth. “For…?” he asks, then makes a tremendously distracting production of licking the syrup off his fingers.
"Can we do anything?" Bruce offers after a moment. He sounds bleak, like he's well aware Tony's going to refuse but he feels obliged to say it anyway.
The things he's thrown at the walls (and floor, and, on one particularly stupid occasion, the ceiling) can be repaired, welded or glued or just swept up and chucked in the trash and replaced. When Tony breaks physical things, he can just open his wallet and keep pulling out bills until the problem goes away.
. She wasn't a scientist or a spy, and there's no way she could have been a threat to Hydra. She was a- a fucking
and all that. Talking is good."
Thor kills things too fast. Spoils fun. Hulk likes killing bugs slow.
His quiver is on the table, too, with what looks like the same number of arrows he had before, but his bow…
"Sleeping with," Steve corrects, and at least
"If he's not told anyone so far, there's no way he'd answer us now," Pepper agrees sadly. "And I've no doubt you'd be just as reticent, wouldn't you, JARVIS?"
Steve shifts his head back, far enough for his breath to ruffle Tony’s hair when he sighs. “Sam knows. About us, I mean.”
“Let me take a look at your arm,” Stark answers, neither a request nor an order but somewhere in between. “It causes me actual pain to have tech that damaged in my home, never mind that god-awful noise it keeps making.”
"That won't be necessary, Sir," JARVIS announces, like Tony's going to take his word for it.
“Nah,” Bucky agrees. “Won’t have to. Hey, Wilson,” he adds, as Sam returns from breakfast, JARVIS apparently having decided his exile to the communal floor is at an end. “Get your ass in here. Steve’s gonna ask Stark to go steady, and since my wooing experience is rusty and his is goddamn non-existent, it’s on you to make sure he doesn’t fuck it up again.”
No. Just no. Bruce has got to be talking about something else.
"Will he answer?"
“Okay,” Steve says, deciding to take him at his word for now.
. Because Clint can be a tactless dick sometimes, but he's their tactless dick, and Tony was too wrapped up in his ugly, fucked-up grief-rage to think about who he was talking to or how personally Clint might take his anger.
"I didn't mean him," he says desperately. "Bruce, he knows I'm not talking about him, right?"
,” she says brightly.
I said yes, because who the hell is going to turn that down, even if it isn't exactly what I wanted, and… yeah. Here we are."
There's a bug behind Metal Man. He doesn't know it's there.
Tony’s feet are back on the floor before he finishes the request, and he smiles as he waves away Thor’s very earnest apologies; turns out, having probably bruised ribs doesn’t make Thor’s enthusiasm any easier to resist, or any harder to forgive.
The asset has chewed through its leash, and it ain't ever going back.
The Soldier nods, eyes downcast, and drops to his knees on the jagged looking gravel of the rooftop, no effort to go slowly or brace himself, no sign at all that he feels the pain Tony's pretty sure he ought to be feeling right now. His left arm is held out to the side rather than cradled against his chest, sleeve sliding back far enough to show an inch of steel before the biohazard/crappy knitted glove that covers his hand.
FHD ducks his head, hair hanging over his face, so Clint can't actually tell if he says anything, but he's fairly sure the guy hasn't broken his silent streak. He does step to one side, though, not so much gesturing to a table in the opposite corner of the room as he is deliberately unobstructing Clint's view of it.
“And,” Bucky continues, frowning again, “even if I hadn’t, you should have known I wouldn’t give a damn. Who you love doesn’t change who you are, dumbass. Doesn’t matter how many billionaires you take up with, you’ll still be the same idiot I grew up alongside.”
Steve will make himself a literal obstacle, when someone finds the Soldier, and, sometimes, Tony doesn't think that'll be enough to stop him.
– to find Bucky, but it won't reduce his chances of finding him if he waits until after Tony wakes up and they have the conversation Steve should have made sure they had last night. It's okay for him to rest, at least a little longer.
Rather than replying, Sam looks between Steve's mug, his plate, and Steve himself. "Oh, man," he says, not unkindly, putting down his book. "Steve, what happened?"
It's his own voice that answers him, from a conversation who knows how long ago, well before all Steve's shit with Hydra and his undead BFF. "
. Clearly this is exactly what Tony thought it was, but that doesn't mean he's going to talk about it. He's ignored JARVIS' efforts to needle him about Steve for this long, he's sure as hell not going to give in to Bruce's attempt now.
Still, he allows Bruce to herd him over to the beat-up couch Tony has spent the last decade refusing to replace, sitting when Bruce gives him a very pointed look, then claims his unsugared coffee and, less enthusiastically, the cake.
can't be down to bad wiring (as if Tony would ever allow such a thing).
face, don't think I don't know you all do that, and oh, fuck it, I'm just going to say it, okay. Didn't Bucky fall off a train? Into a ravine. In, what, '45, wasn't it?"
He looks across at Tony, not exactly smiling, but there's something optimistic to it, and Tony can't quite manage to look away from him.
There's a moment where she looks uncertain, and Tony remembers he's asking about a man she knew for no more than two years almost seventy years ago, that there was a war going on at the time so it's not like they had time to hang out and chill, and that the only reason she knew Barnes was because they were both… well, whatever they were (or are, or, Tony supposes, will be) to Steve.
to feel. He wants to keep being pissed off at Steve, because he thinks being pissed off with Steve will make this a hell of a lot easier, but letter-Steve is every bit as earnest as real-Steve and even if Tony doesn't agree with what Steve wrote, he can't escape the fact that Steve meant it.
“Your pal Thor showed up, let the cat out of the bag,” Bucky explains. “Completely missed the fact that Stark clearly wanted him to shut up.” He frowns, arms as close to crossed as the damage to the left one will allow. “So, get to explaining.”
This is nothing Steve hasn’t heard before, and usually he wouldn’t argue it; subtlety is an awful lot more complicated than charging right in and hitting things, and all in all Steve would rather leave the
, Tony thinks, extracting his hand. Here’s the
“Okay,” Steve agrees. “Coffee it is, and maybe we can talk about telling people about us, if you were- If you wanted to.”
Steve lets himself get half a pace closer, almost close enough to touch. “I mean it, Tony,” he says. “I can’t imagine how hard it must have been for you, and you did it anyway. I can’t even begin to repay you.”
Tony scoffs, reaching for another mug, this time finding an inch of coffee at the bottom, thank god. "Don't lie, everyone knows you love me, Bruce."
"I can't read minds, Tony," she prompts.
Besides, it’s clearly safe enough up there, because the archer is sat at the very edge of the rooftop, his legs dangling in a way that makes the asset feel deeply uneasy. He’s leaning his elbows on the railing surrounding the drop off, a pose that would be relaxed but for the way he’s staring over his shoulder at the asset.
“Ah, of course you do,” Clint answers brightly, apparently not actually needing a committed response. “Everyone loves beer.”
I was asleep."
He's holding a gun.
"I'd offer to make you coffee," is the first thing he says upon seeing the even more chaotic than usual mess down there, "But I sort of think you've had enough already."
side, is all. What's the point in creating a hyper-intelligent butler-slash-offspring-slash-goddamn-guardian-angel if he's going to team up with someone else?
, he reads, which is promising, but the next sentence has his heart sinking.
look, because if Tony is healthy and calling him intentionally, Steve is allowed to be invested in this. It's his heart, and if he wants to put himself in a position where it's going to get broken, that is entirely his choice.
. He and Steve had been fooling around for months without anyone knowing about it, and it makes zero sense for Bruce to have figured it out now that Steve's made it perfectly clear it's not happening again.
Once a scan for heat signatures reveals that the four of them are the only people left above ground, they regroup at the elevator, where it takes Tony a matter of seconds to override the security and get them access to where they want to be.
He nods.
"Thanks, J," Tony says, then offers Barnes a smile that hopefully only looks a little bit uncertain. "So, you got a bag we can stick this stuff in? Only, I've got rules about the number of pointy things people can carry in my presence, and you're way over quota."
“You would?” Steve asks, which is about when Tony has to stand up and round the table, still holding his hand, only stretching his arm in a very slightly uncomfortable way in order to do so.
"Wilson does," Tony answers without thinking. "I mean, I think he does, anyway."
Cookery, it has to be said, is not Steve’s strong suit. He can manage toast and cereal, not that those entirely count as cooking, and his skills at boiling pasta and heating up a jar of sauce are unparalleled, but when it comes to preparing something that might actually count as a healthy, home-cooked meal, he’s somewhat less competent.
"You thought I was helping Steve find my parents' murderer," he manages incredulously, more of a repetition than a question. "Then, what, you thought I'd bring the Winter Soldier into my home, build him a nice cushy floor all of his own?"
“God, no,” Natalia answers, laughing. She rises, stretching, and offers Barnes a hand. “I’m going to downstairs, where the food might actually be edible, and Yasha’s coming with me, aren’t you?”
"You have access to resources the rest of us don't," she explains, in a tone that suggests she thinks he should be able to figure it out for himself. "If everything I've read is true, Steve wouldn't have lived long enough to sign up for Rebirth without Barnes. They've been friends so long they're practically brothers-"
” No, she's in a public place, that can't be her question; her Nathalie Rousseau identity can survive a few minutes without the smile and the bubbliness, but asking if anyone’s dead is much too noticeable. “
Sam shrugs, heading into the bathroom for a few seconds before returning with both of their toothbrushes and a mostly empty tube of toothpaste. "Out of town, someplace. JARVIS said he'd send us coordinates when he's found a place."
until he woke up before starting cutting; at least Tony's torture-surgery had been because they didn't have and didn't care to procure anaesthetic, whereas Barnes' had been entirely intentional, the fuckers). "Sir, if you don't respond within the next minute, I will be forced to summon one of the Avengers. Sir? Sir?"
"I mean it, Steve," Tony says, more or less nuzzling at Steve's neck, hands fluttering over his chest and stomach like he can soothe his pain away just like that. "We're a team, most of us haven't got any family other than each other, and if the history books are at all correct Barnes was pretty much your family too which makes him ours by association. All of us'll do whatever it takes to help you with this."
putting stuff away again. He’ll do emotional support and gallant loser at anything from poker to hand-to-hand, but he draws the line at housekeeper) before sitting down.
Natalia says Barnes won. He’s less sure, but apparently this is a non-optional twenty-first century tradition, so Barnes waits until Natalia has challenged Steve to a sparring match in the gym before taking the stairs down to Stark’s workshop.
Pepper's cell rings a dozen times before she picks up, growling, "
No doubt, Sir's unhappiness will continue past that point, because Captain Rogers frequently displays the same poor communication skills Sir does, but physical proximity should at least get them slightly closer to fixing things.
“Suuuure,” Sam agrees, once again deciding not to ask.
Hulk likes Angry-Sad Cap, too. Almost as much as killing bugs.
"When someone wakes up next to you muttering
Clearly, thoroughly enjoyable sex followed by sleeping a full eight hours has completely addled Tony's brain, otherwise he would have realised that waking up at half past ten in the morning in Barcelona still gives him over three hours to get back to Manhattan for the meeting at eight.
Steve nods, looking both completely exhausted and like he really wants to go back to hitting things. He doesn't, thank God, and Sam gives him a few moments before breaking the slightly tense silence filling the gym.
, and all that. Make yourself comfortable."
"Sir," he says. [Caution is another thing outside of his basic parameters, certainly not something Sir would have written into him. It is not the reason he pauses before continuing.] "I believe I have located Sergeant Barnes."
Well, whatever. As long as JARVIS isn't pushing him to read whatever bullshit Steve's written him, Tony really doesn't give a shit.
explanation just as clearly as if Clint had said it, if only because he’s so freaking familiar with them himself, and figures this is where he stops asking questions. If it was Steve, he’d push, but he doesn’t think he and Clint are at a point where that would be acceptable yet, so he just lets it go, nudging the bagels a little closer to his side of the table.
"Well," Bruce murmurs later, once the doors to the elevator have closed. "I think that went well, don't you, JARVIS?"
“Huh,” Natasha says, once the doors close behind him. “Guess that’s what it takes. Good job, Thor.”
"I have had a very long, very difficult day, and you do not want to play games with me, JARVIS." Tony pauses to take a breath and a healthy swig of his drink. "You know exactly what this is about."
He chooses the former, but only very reluctantly. “Last time?” he echoes, confused, because, sure, maybe Steve didn’t bother calling him, but Tony’s prepared for that, and absolutely prepared to keep his feelings well aware from any sex that they’re having.
Thor wasn't scared, even when Hulk hit him. Hulk misses Thor.
to be sorry for.”
look, not that it's anything like as impressive as Steve or Pepper's, though it is probably on a par with Rhodey's. Unlike any of the others, Bruce doesn't try back up his disapproval with an attempt to talk Tony out of a bottle.
The mission – Captain America – is another matter.
"You'll find him," Tony continues after another kiss. "You'll find him, you'll bring him back here. Bruce can do chemicals, I've got technology sorted, Pepper has about a thousand shrinks and lawyers and PR-whatevers on speed dial. Anything you need, Steve, anything, you just gotta ask and it's yours."
Rather than restarting the elevator, JARVIS apparently decides the appropriate response is to open the doors onto the team's floor. "Doctor Banner and Agent Barton have expressed concern for your wellbeing, Sir," JARVIS says. "I believe they would find your presence at dinner reassuring."
They’re all more-or-less finished and squabbling about whose turn it is to do the washing up when Tony arrives, at which point the light-hearted arguing comes to a very sudden halt.
“New?” Bucky says, incredulous. “Steve, I’ve known you were a fairy since I caught you ogling Jimmy Hauptman back when we were fifteen. Do you actually think that’s what I’m pissed at you for?”
"I suppose there's a slight chance he's told Colonel Rhodes," Bruce says eventually. "Failing that, the next option would be actually asking Tony, but I can't see that going well."
The third door leads onto the rest of the floor. Like the door to the bathroom, it has a lock on it. Also like the door to the bathroom, the lock only engages from the inside.
"Yeah," he says, "Okay, yeah, sorry, Brucie-kins."
“Oh,” Thor says, immediately dejected. “Heimdall told me all was once more well between yourself and the captain. It saddens me to hear that isn’t so.”
"Sorry, have you met Steve?" Wilson says softly.
Tony turns around, a glass in either hand, and just stands there a moment, quirking one eyebrow at Steve.
Abruptly, Sam feels like a dick. After months of listening to Steve talking about Bucky-this and Bucky-that, and then the way he reacted to Steve calling him Bucky, it hadn’t even occurred to Sam to ask, and he should have done. He absolutely should have done. Yeah, he’s been calling the guy Barnes, but he never asked, just assumed he’d be uncomfortable with a stranger calling him Bucky. After all the training he’s had (admittedly none of it in helping people with the level of trauma Barnes has, but that’s neither here nor there), Sam should have known better than to assume.
Today is the first time in weeks that JARVIS has let her know that Tony has left his workshop, and Pepper is determined not to waste this opportunity to pin him down and impress upon him why it's so important for the owner of a company to make an appearance at meetings every now and again. She may be CEO (and very happy about that fact, too) but there's no denying that the shareholders find it reassuring to know Tony's still alive and still inventing.
In a city of eight million people, the asset can disappear once and for all.
Tony sighs, long and exaggerated, and downs what's left of his drink before answering. "My parents' deaths weren't an accident." He makes grabby hands at the beer Clint's still holding.
Barnes doesn’t say anything in the few seconds Tony is mortified and silent, though, and Tony continues, figuring hey, he can’t actually make it any worse. “And before you, you know…” That, Tony’s hand decides to follow with a throat slit gesture, and, Jesus Christ, that’s a whole hell of a lot worse, fuck, Steve’s going to be so fucking disappointed in him when he hears about this.
"Thanks," Bruce says, spending another few moments pondering his next words, then decides he might as well just go for it. "I'd never ask you to tell me anything Tony's specifically told you not to, but if I was to talk to him about someone, you wouldn't let me make a fool of myself by mentioning the wrong person, would you?"
Maybe if it was just his friendship with Steve, it wouldn't be an issue. In the course of his lifetime, Tony has screwed up more friendships than he can count, and, sure, Steve's a great guy and being friends with him is a hell of a lot easier than the antagonism they had going on in the beginning, but if they quit being buddies Tony can live with it.
(because Tony built him, didn't he, so he knows how much processing power JARVIS has and therefore knows he could have run all possible interpretations of and responses to Tony's words in a fraction of that time; obviously J is making a point, even if he hasn't let on what that point is yet).
Except Clint has apparently missed the memo about how they're supposed to be ignoring the fact that Tony's hitting the bottle pretty hard, because he doesn't hand over the beer like Tony expects him to.
“Hard pass on that,” he says eventually, which makes Natalia smile again.
"He's not been in the Tower for a few days," Bruce explains. "I tried calling him a few times, but you know how he is."
“Sure, breakfast sounds good,” Sam says. He’s not quite frowning, but Steve gets the impression he’s not far from it, either. “You’ll let me know if Steve needs backup, right, JARVIS?”
The jet can't land here. Even with the vertical take-off and landing system Tony designed, the roof isn't large enough (or sufficiently reinforced) for it, nor has Steve seen any handy vacant lots in the vicinity. "Where's the jet going to land?"
It's fine. Steve's busy taking selfies with Bruce and Wilson in the
It doesn’t last, of course; Bucky tenses up the moment he realises Steve is there, pulling away from Natasha, though she makes zero effort to move.
“I don’t- What?”
“Oh,” Steve says again. “Sorry, Buck.”
“Oh,” the asset answers, returning to his bedroom.
Later, he’ll tell Steve that it’s only to be expected that Barnes might struggle with accepting his freedom, after everything he’s been through. He’ll tell Steve that Barnes will get better, with time and help, and he’ll suggest that Steve talks to Sam in the morning, maybe reaches out to people with more experience. He’ll encourage Steve to be patient, to have hope, even if Steve having hope for Barnes’ recovery must surely equate to having hope that his current relationship with Tony will end. He’ll take Steve up to the penthouse, help him out of his sweaty clothes and into a warm shower, then tuck them both into his bed and hold him until they both fall asleep.
, not Tony via JARVIS or JARVIS acting of his own accord) sent him the blueprint.
“So, hey,” he says, tone deliberately light, even if his position between Barnes and Thor means he currently feels anything but light. “Thor, this is Steve’s friend Bucky Barnes. Barnes, this is Thor.”
pity-party with a serving bowl sized cup of tea and a box of slightly stale doughnuts down in his lab, except JARVIS sent for him rather than just shutting down whatever Tony was working on until he's eaten and slept. Clearly, he thinks Tony needs to talk to someone more than he needs to get out of the shop, and, unfortunately for Tony, Bruce is the best person JARVIS was able to get hold of.
Steve walks through the hotel in a daze. He's aware enough to be grateful there's no one else roaming the corridors at this hour – even outside the US, people are going to notice Captain America wandering around a hotel in the middle of the night, hair still dripping down his back after his shower and zero effort made to conceal his identity – but not enough to really be thinking about where he's heading or why.
"Captain Rogers requested assistance with a Hydra base as Sir was leaving Washington DC," JARVIS reports as she ascends. "He was hoping Sir might prove willing to put him in contact with Colonel Rhodes."
Jim loves the guy, he does, but that doesn't mean he wouldn't quite happily strangle him sometimes.
"JARVIS says I have to eat here so you guys stop fretting," Tony paraphrases, in answer to Bruce's questioning look. "Anything I like in this lot?"
He’s still holding Tony’s hand, so Tony tries not to jump to conclusions “There is?”
Sir flinches, though JARVIS puts it at equal odds between it being at the name or at the suggestion, then shakes his head. "Don't," he answers. "I got this. Power up the Mark 58, J."
"Yeah, sure, laugh it up. At least you know I won't be late this time…"
“Well, Sir?” JARVIS asks, once Steve is on his way back upstairs.
"Tomorrow," Pepper concludes, stepping onto the jet's ramp before Tony can hit the controls to close it. "The company needs you here, tomorrow, at 8am."
"The Winter Goddamn Soldier," he agrees. "Fucking Bucky Barnes."
on Cap's best buddy and to hell with the consequences or the fact that it wasn't his fault? Because I don't know about you, but I don't want to see my actually decent family ripped apart so Tony can get revenge for the shitty one he was born into."
Tony needs more information.
“Good,” Steve says again, eventually. “So, if we’ve cleared that up, there’s something else.”
"No," Steve answers. It's not entirely a lie, because Tony didn't text him, and if Steve says anything about the note Sam will just tell him to call, hear Tony out. Worse, Sam'll sound so reasonable and logical about it that Steve will think it's a good idea. He'll call, and Tony will make a joke of it, tell Steve that it was fun, sure, but that it would be better if they didn't do it again. It would be better if Steve stayed away, for good this time.
to eat. A bag of red grapes for snacking, bread and cheese for lunch, everything she needs to throw together a bolognaise for this evening, a pint of ice cream and the darkest bar of chocolate she can find just in case the occasion calls for it.
“Look,” Clint says softly, fingers scratching at the label on his beer. “At some point Steve or Sam or whoever is going to want you talk to a therapist. If you’re anything like the rest of us, you won’t want to do it, but… Something happened to me, a couple years back. Not as bad as what you and Nat  went through, but this guy got into my head, made me do some shit I never would have done if I’d had a choice. Fucked me up pretty badly for a while, and I was a stubborn bastard about it, refused to listen whenever anyone told me to get help.”
"Sir is currently uninjured," JARVIS tells him, thankfully answering Steve's questions in order of urgency rather than asking. "He has not slept in thirty-seven hours or eaten in sixteen, and I estimate his current blood alcohol content to be around 0.06%." He pauses a moment to let Steve convert these statistics from average person to Tony Stark (answer: not ideal, but not so bad that Tony might have had JARVIS call him as the result of either sleep deprivation or intoxication, and definitely not enough to trip any of JARVIS' safety protocols – whatever this call is about, Tony's sober and stable enough to have had JARVIS make it intentionally) and continues with, "Sir has asked me to pass on a message to you."
He knows he should feel bad about that and maybe, by the time Steve ends things for good, he will, but right now, Tony feels warm, content, and entirely uninclined to tell Steve he can’t have his cake and eat it. After all, he’s been a lot worse than cake in a lot of his relationships, and if that’s all he can have from Steve, he’s willing to take it as long as he can have it.
“Okay. See you then.”
FHD shrugs a second time, still seeming unfamiliar with how that's supposed to work, and tilts his left hand (now holding yet another wickedly sharp knife); Clint assumes this means he isn't entirely sure, and sets to checking pulses. To his surprise, he finds all but one of them is alive; that one, he leaves, but the others he binds with belts and bootlaces before confiscating the contents of their pockets. No weapons on any of them, which is definitely not how Clint remembers his fun introduction to them going; he assumes FHD helped himself to anything stabby or shooty when he knocked the goons out, which makes giving Clint a half empty gun kind of a dick move (though since he took out a Hydra team and cut Clint loose, he maybe shouldn't complain too much).
Sam follows him, because that’s mostly what he does nowadays, but he muses about it on the way down to Steve’s floor. From what Steve said, it sounded like Tony broke things off without explanation, but in conjunction with Tony’s attitude something doesn’t ring true; Tony’s acting like he was dumped, not like someone who did the dumping, and he’s trying very hard to put a brave face on it.
Halfway through page two, when Tony's huddled on the floor trying not to puke up everything he's eaten in the last
All of which brings him back to the second reason he loves having a billionaire paying the bills: before today, Sam didn't realise hotels could be this nice.
“Uh,” Clint says, sounding unsure, and then, “Oh, Natasha? Not sure, actually. Why?”
Tony halts his endless, restless fidgeting, even his hands falling still on the screwdriver he's been flipping from one hand to the other since Bruce entered the room.
Looking at it that way, all the effort Steve’s put into keeping his feelings to himself seems a lot more like selfishness than self-preservation.
Maria nods. "Stark?"
Because, okay, Howard worked a lot and drank even more, Tony won't deny that. He was almost never home, always in the office or the lab or on his stupid, futile rescue mission, and when he was there he was either absent or angry. And maybe Maria could be cool, distant, substituting praise and affection with expensive gifts Tony neither needed nor wanted. Sure, she spent half the time not a whole lot more sober than her husband was, but it's not like being married to Howard could have been a picnic, and all Tony's fuck-ups sure as shit couldn't have made her life any easier. But he never went hungry, never lacked clean clothes or hot water or anything he could possibly need.
"I know you're there," the Soldier says, his voice low, rasping like he's not spoken aloud in days.
That… is actually a very good question, and something that would definitely have occurred to Tony to have an answer for if he'd thought this through. Except he didn't, and now he's waited too long to answer and Peggy is staring him down, eyes narrowed, and no amount of looking out the window and pretending he's fascinated by the well-maintained flowerbeds and absolutely hideous garden gnomes is going to put her off.
As much as he was expecting to be discovered, the asset was not ready to see the son of two of his victims.
And then there’s Barnes, standing in the middle of the room, looking uncomfortable and saying absolutely nothing.
“Hey,” Tony says.
Steve slams one final punch into the bag and then, shoulders braced like he's expecting an attack, says, "I'm sleeping with Tony."
"You're welcome, Nephew Tony," she answers, their old inside joke, dating back to when Jarvis first suggested to a five year old Tony that he should call her that. "It was good to see you."
Still, he’s got a slightly more pressing Steve problem to deal with, namely the fact that the man is jittery as hell and getting more so with every second. “Chill, man,” Sam instructs. “We’re trying not to freak the guy out, remember?”
"And what are the chances of her actually letting me see it?"
“I didn’t have friends when I was a kid, Tony,” Steve explains, thankfully oblivious to Tony’s useless inner monologue. “No one wanted to put up with the scrawny, sickly kid who was too stupid to stay out of fights he couldn’t win. Before I met Erskine, there were exactly two people who gave a damn what happened to me: my mom, and Bucky. And Bucky? He was smart, he was handsome, and he could have been friends with absolutely anyone he wanted, but for some reason he picked me. And, even after he stopped being my only friend, he was still my best friend, but he has never and will never be more than that. It’s not what either of us want.”
, and it doesn't actually help at all because, "Tony, Steve left."
me, Natasha. I need to see it."
"Tony, no," she says softly. "I don't think you should do anything you don't want to do. I'm just making sure you understand how much you mean to Steve." She pauses a moment, like Tony's supposed to have some kind of response to that, then says, "I'll send you everything I've got on Barnes. Take care of yourself, Tony."
Natalia positively beams.
believe that he knew it was Bucky he was designing it for, or that it was at Hydra's instruction.
“Right,” Steve says, sort of shaking himself out of whatever stupor he’s in. “I made dinner, if-” He sort of motions in the direction of the table, which Tony is just now noticing has been laid properly, with the good cutlery and the even better plates, the stuff Pepper picked out back when this was her home too.
"Oh, Tony," she says, sounding a little bit sad and an awful lot tired. "I think it's time I was heading home, now."
The lights are off, and in the half-darkness it takes a moment for Sam to locate Barnes, standing in the corner furthest away from them. He doesn’t move, and Sam doesn’t take his eyes off him, even as he murmurs, “Could we have a little light in here, JARVIS?”
, because that’s who he is going to be now ‒ is expecting Clint to say something about it, but all he does is smile again, clap Barnes on the arm, and say, “Okay, cool. Like I said, it’s good to meet you for real, Barnes. Hey, you disappeared last time before I could offer, but I totally owe you a beer, you want one?”
expression whenever he tried to bullshit her. Tony feigns indifference, the same way he always used to.
Steve has always run hot, and he’s even warmer than normal after his workout, his shirt damp with sweat, not that either of those things are going to put Tony off hugging him. His arms go around Tony almost instantly, and Tony responds in kind, one hand stroking Steve’s back while the other threads through his hair.
"No Hawkeye?" Wilson asks.
His departure leaves a heavy sense of discomfort in the room, Tony too stunned first by the attack on himself and his parents and then by Clint's apology for him to find words.
The name hits him just as sharply as it always does, filling him with a stinging blend of grief and resentment. Howard might have been a distant and fairly shitty father, but Tony loved him all the same, and it's not fair that he's gone, that he and Maria were murdered for whatever the fuck Hydra wanted them murdered for (all his searching, and still Tony hasn't managed to find an actual motive behind their deaths). It fucking sucks that Tony's been an orphan for more years than he hasn't and he's still stuck in Howard's shadow, that he can't hear his name without his brain automatically adding
[He needs it now.]
,” Tony answers emphatically. “Tell me you saw the note, Steve.”
could deserve what they did to him)… Tony's been beaten and shocked, cut up and drowned, over and over until he begged his captors and the universe to please just let him die, but that's nothing, absolutely fucking
Why wouldn’t Tony think he was that unimportant to him, when Steve’s worked so hard not to let on how much he cares?
“Who says I’m unemployed?” Nat answers, enigmatic as ever, and, honestly, Steve knows better than to question her. She’s always had her fingers in more pies than he can count, and the collapse of SHIELD isn’t going to have lessened that number any; Steve makes a mental note to check in with her later, see if there’s anything the rest of them ought to be concerned by.
would have asked him to.
"Indeed, Sergeant Wilson," answers the
It's not up to him, though. The world is ticking on just fine, mass destruction has been averted, and Tony believes Pepper will absolutely follow through on any and all threats she's made regarding his anatomy if he's not back at the Tower in time for her meeting.
If he was having this argument with anyone else, this is the point where Tony would storm out of the room, have JARVIS take him down to the shop, and then proceed to drink himself close to unconsciousness whilst building something unnecessarily loud and explosive. As it is, he's already in the shop, well over the legal limit, and getting away from JARVIS is damn near impossible unless he leaves the building and takes no tech with him.
"Yuh-huh."
"Just fucking peachy," Tony replies, still very bland. "Thanks for letting me know about Steve."
"Hey," Clint manages, after they've both spent far too many seconds fidgeting uncomfortably. It's just like ripping a bandaid off, he tells himself, and blurts out his next sentence before he can overthink it enough that he runs and hides. "So, I shouldn't have said that shit about your parents and I'm sorry."
"To be fair to him, I've heard things about your gift-giving prowess, and none of them are good."
“That’s good…?” Sam offers, when Bruce doesn’t seem inclined to defend himself further.
"Okay," Sam says. "I completely get why you didn't let on that you were awake, but, man, I spoke to Tony yesterday and I would have bet my life that the two of you were on the same page. He didn't text you or anything?"
Steve shakes head, very much disagreeing. Maybe Tony was showy in his relationships before Iron Man, maybe it's possible to google him and find the sort of things Steve would never have expected to find in the public domain, but Tony has been far more discreet since then. His relationship with Pepper was public, but none of the details were, and not one of his other partners has shown up in the tabloids after the two of them broke up.
The failed mission is another matter. The asset's research suggests the mission is tenacious, unlikely to call off the hunt for the asset, and since the asset failed to kill him before there's no reason to believe it can kill him now, even in self defence.
Stark, freak of nature that he is (being a freak himself, Barnes is well-equipped to recognise it in someone else, even though his own freakishness is a hell of a lot less natural), looks somewhat less perturbed by the threat on his life than he was by Barnes’ previous declaration. In fact, he looks sort of amused, a little bit of a smirk playing around his lips.
Clint shrugs. “I mean, I asked him if he was okay with Bucky or if it was some kid nickname he wanted to get rid of and he’d prefer something else, and that’s what he said, so…”
) in. Bruce misses Pepper. Due to his friends' aforementioned failure to recognise his lack of psychological training, Bruce knows that Pepper and Tony's on-again off-again relationship wasn't making either of them happy, that Pepper spent most of her time worrying about Tony and Tony's idea of a solution was to make enormous and poorly thought out romantic gestures that he couldn't actually follow through on, that they're both happier now that things are permanently off between them, but Bruce misses her thoughtful, rational presence all the same, and not just because he's now the one JARVIS deems most capable of convincing Tony to leave his workshop after having locked himself in there for over forty-eight hours.
“Thank you,” Steve answers, shifting one of the plates on the table an inch to the right, then straightening up the cutlery as well. The neatness does little to soothe his nerves, and unfortunately only occupies him for a few seconds before he ends up pacing again.
"Understood, Sir." A pause, the kind that's usually followed by JARVIS being the hideous smartass Tony almost regrets programming him to be, and then, "I take it that means you aren't interested in reading the letter he left you?"
to be called that anymore. The people who called him that were cruel, and the asset is indescribably pleased to be away from them. The asset was their tool, taken out of the box when they had a use for it and, if it was lucky, put away as soon as it had served its purpose. It wasn't a human being, not to Hydra and not to itself.
"No, I meant that's
“As opposed to the position where I’ve murdered his BFF?” Stark says. “Yeah, I can totally see how that’s better.”
There's a noise that sounds awfully like someone being punched in the face (nasal cartilage makes such a distinctive sound), but the pained grunt that follows it is masculine and therefore not of concern.
But, hey, Howard might have been an asshole, but he probably wasn’t a nazi.
He already knows he’d rather die than wind up in Hydra’s control again, has a hundred plans for how he'd kill himself or force the people after him to kill him rather than take him alive. He knows he'd fight to the death to prevent someone hurting or killing or taking Steve, thinks he'd probably try just as hard to protect Natalia or Sam or Clint, if it came down to it. What's one more name on the list, particularly when it's someone Steve is in love with?
"Forgot that Europe is in a different time zone?" Pepper asks, her annoyance now replaced by amusement at his expense. "For a genius, you aren't half stupid sometimes, Tony."
The asset is being hunted.
, Tony thinks. It's probably a conversation that'll go better face-to-face, anyway, and he'll be seeing Steve tonight at the latest.
The first page isn't so bad, really. Mostly just the facts behind the Russians finding Barnes, the location, time, a few details about his injuries: an assortment of broken bones, a fair few cuts and bruises, his left arm mangled beyond saving.
Natasha takes over when it’s time to actually start cooking, and within a few minutes there are several bowls of fruit and a large pile of waffles in the centre of the table.
“Tony,” says the best friend shaped brick wall Sam’s just run into.
Tony regrets it.
Stark might be expecting an extreme reaction to this, in which case he's going to be deeply disappointed. If Barnes’ memories from back then are to be trusted, Bucky was exclusively interested in women, but he would have gone to the ends of the earth to keep Steve happy and healthy. Bucky cancelled more than one date to sit by Steve’s sickbed, broke off more than one relationship because they couldn't handle the fact that they wouldn't ever be more important to him than Steve was. Significant, yes, maybe even just as important, but never more.
“Uh-huh,” Clint agrees, sounding doubtful. “You gonna stay there long?”
He's on his own at a table in the corner, far enough off to the side that none of the waitstaff seem to be trying to hurry him away even though his plate is empty. Steve joins him, nudging an empty chair out with his foot and dropping into it heavily, frowning down at his plate.
" Tony repeats, more incredulity than it is a question. "You got my AI gossiping about me now? Pretty sure there's supposed to be a cone of silence when it comes to stuff like that, buddy."
JARVIS put the lot's security cameras on a loop as soon as the last car left for the day, so there's no risk of anyone noticing two men appearing from nowhere. It also means there's no one besides the four of them and J to notice how awkward Tony's greeting is, and thankfully the only one who acknowledges it is Bruce, who doesn't do anything more than frown slightly which is basically the same as doing nothing at all.
And yet, despite his excellent intentions, Tony finds himself elbow deep in designing from scratch an entirely new arm for their most recently acquired brainwashed assassin when JARVIS announces he has a visitor.
“Mostly just that,” he says. “Think he wanted to know you were okay after he shot you. Called you Natalia, wasn’t sure if I should tell him you don’t go by that anymore.”
Stark turns on his flashy, media-friendly grin and strikes the hands out,
It’s not a long walk to the town centre, and Nathalie drifts from shop to shop, familiarising herself with what the little town has to offer. There’s a small number of boutique clothing stores (just about passable), a shoe store Nathalie immediately dismisses as painfully unfashionable (the kind of shoes her
He's almost at the door when Peggy calls out to him, waiting until he looks back at her before saying, "Of course, if you really want to know about Bucky Barnes, you should talk to Steve."
“Jesus, dumbass,” Bucky answers, then sighs, the sound one of sheer exasperation, which is when it occurs to Steve that this is the most Bucky-ish conversation they’ve had since he got him back. Steve hadn't ever expected to see the man he used to know again, the same way the Bucky he pulled off Zola’s table wasn't the same one who went off to war. He knew Bucky would be different, and it's never once bothered him, but if he looks past the physical changes the man in front of him is every bit the old Bucky, like all he was waiting for was an opportunity to yell at Steve for doing something he thinks is stupid.
Frowny homeless dude doesn't crack a smile. Actually, he frowns more, and then pulls a knife from behind his back.
has elected to notify him rather than anyone else who's home, he's really got no option but to try.
“So that's how it is, then,” he says lightly. “Knew I shouldn’t have believed Steve when he said there was nothing there. I mean, there's friendship and then there's breaking through however many years of brainwashing to save a target’s life.”
expression (and if it's true that practice makes perfect, working with the Avengers means that expression has to be as close as it gets), and Tony huffs a loud, exaggerated sigh. "What I
“I didn’t mean to suggest he has control over your actions, Tony,” Thor answers (or doesn’t, really, since it in no way resolves Tony’s query), his words coming quickly and sounding very serious. “I do not believe Steve would take advantage of your relationship like that.”
Clint laughs, making a grab for a third doughnut, but apparently Bruce isn’t over his
"Awesome," Wilson says, mustering up enough energy to push himself away from the wall and starting a meandering path in the direction of the jet, Bruce following after him.
Natasha, on the other hand, isn't, so Tony isn't going to tell her that she's right. Steve can't ever be allowed to see what's in the file.
“Sorry,” he says. “Had a complete brain fart, forgot that Steve has- It’s you!”
“And bringing him up is supposed to sway me how?”
“Steve…” Tony says, the word catching in his throat, because, sure, maybe he can see Steve being that good, if he really thinks about it, but not him. He’s not that selfless, and no one else alive has ever been naive enough to tell him he is. “You really need to lower your expectations of people, Cap.”
"If I may, Sir," JARVIS says, taking it upon himself to speak through Tony's external speaker as he answers Bruce's plea. "I have located a nearby hotel I believe ought to meet your specifications. I have also taken the liberty of inquiring as to whether they have space for you to park the quinjet, and gentleman with whom I spoke believes their roof should suffice."
“Yeah, I know he does,” Clint says. “But I thought it might be one of those childhood nicknames you spend your whole life trying to get away from, so I figured I’d give you the chance now. Is there something you’d prefer to be called?”
He pops the avocado roll in his mouth, then promptly slams all four chair legs back onto the floor and dashes to the sink, sticking his mouth straight under the tap.
was an all-encompassing statement about Bucky’s well-being or if it just means that Bucky and Tony didn’t injure one another.
Hulk jumps on the bug. It squelches.
, but that doesn’t actually make it any better.
Sam’s left wondering what it is that Steve
He stands up, pushing his chair back too quickly and grimacing at the noise it makes, then pauses briefly to plate up the last two waffles. He drowns them in syrup, the way Tony usually has them, and bats Clint’s hand away from the leftover blueberries, tipping them over the top in a poorly presented but earnestly intended apology gift.
"Tony," he says again, no idea what's supposed to follow it, but it turns out not to be necessary; Tony throws back his drink, mutters, "Fuck it," and flings himself around and into Steve's lap.
Steve wouldn’t lie to him. If Steve says he’s not a prisoner here, then the asset believes him. He’s not locked in the elevator. Steve wouldn’t do that to him.
"I swear, I have no idea how Pepper and James have put up with you so long," Bruce mutters.
"Wonderful," Banner murmurs. "JARVIS, tell Tony we need him in on a Shelob situation."
Still, at this point he really doesn’t think finally asking his question will make Barnes feel any worse, even if Tony’s feelings are very much dependent on Barnes’ answer; he clasps his hands behind his back, hoping to at least avoid any more terrible gestures, and says, “Just, in the files, I found- There was a blueprint, for your, you know, arm, and it had his initials, so I thought. Yeah. Did you ever see him?”
"Okay," he says, giving up on finding anything useful. "Time to call this in. Can I offer you a lift somewhere? Maybe buy you a beer to say thanks?"
It's not so much that he doesn't want to help – of course he does; these are his friends and Bruce wants them to be okay – as it is that he
JARVIS doesn’t answer, so Tony no longer has an excuse for not looking at Steve. “Okay,” he says, after a few seconds of watching Steve fidget uncomfortably, his thumbs tapping against each finger in turn, the movement rapid and a little uneven. Nervous, Tony thinks, though he’s got no idea what Steve has to be nervous about.
"Indeed, Sir. And I assume expecting you to take my advice would be asking too much."
), and then listens some more as Tony gives all his usual reasons why that's not an option. Or, on the other hand, Jim makes the effort to explain to Tony yet again that a) most people tend to panic when they get phone calls in the middle of the night and b) not everyone’s job comes with the same flexible working hours Tony allows himself, only for Tony to dismiss all Jim’s very reasonable complaints (
“Oh dear,” Tony says, because Pepper might have bullied him into not running away from his problems-slash-imminent-dumping but she can’t bullying him into dropping the pretence that he’s fine with it. Not from the other side of the country, at least, and since she’s in California until Friday Tony gets another few days of pretending he’s absolutely okay. “What’re you making him promise, J?”
Or, no, it explains why Steve was angry and miserable, because only a soulless monster wouldn't be angry and miserable after their BFF comes back from the dead and tries to kill them. It
"Of course you do," Tony replies, landing on the rooftop at – based on his analysis of the footage from DC, at least – a safe distance from him, right hand raised. "I'm wearing the world's least subtle suit of armour.

, just disbelief, and Barnes is really struggling to make this simple for him.
"Ugh," Tony answers, then says it again just for good measure. "
The asset falters, confused. “Steve said it was okay,” he answers slowly, before it occurs to him that his alarm is probably due to the fact that anyone sitting on a rooftop at this hour probably doesn’t want company. “Sorry, I’ll… I’ll go.”
He stops, like that’s it, all of it, and Tony thinks, maybe. Maybe he’s hearing Steve right, maybe he’s really saying what Tony wants him to, but, “I need to hear you say it, Steve,” he says, almost begs, even as his hand reaches for Steve’s again. “I can’t believe you unless you say it.”
That's when he watches the video again.
“Um,” Tony says, still not entirely sure what’s going on; he’s both dumped and been dumped a lot, but not once has the dumping been preceded by a home-cooked meal. Even when it was Pepper, they went for the
He's worried, for a moment, that Steve will be upset that he's letting Natalia close so soon after she got back but is still keeping Steve at such a careful, safe distance. He would be within his rights to be hurt, or jealous, and although Barnes knows and almost manages to believe that Steve won't cause him physical harm he does still expect him to make his displeasure known, whether by word or deed.
He is probably the world's leading expert on the Winter Soldier, but the Soldier is only half the story and Tony knows only the basic, boring, history book facts about Bucky Barnes.
a laugh, either. It seems redundant to say it's the first sound Clint has heard from him, given that he's only just got his hearing back, but from the way the guy startles Clint thinks it actually
"Put him through, J," he repeats. "I'll talk to him."
“Your Rhodey.” Tony thinks he can be forgiven for being sceptical, given that he’s never parachuted into enemy territory with nothing but a prop shield to rescue Rhodey from a prison camp. Not that he wouldn’t rescue him, but he’d trust Rhodey to hold on long enough for Tony to get slightly better tooled up than Steve was, even if Steve already had superhuman abilities and a whole lot of determination on his side, and, okay, that’s a shitty example, but he’s sure he can think of other times where Steve has acted way less than platonically where Barnes is concerned. Abandoning his friends and sort-of-home to look for him. Dropping the shield to let Barnes beat him to a pulp. Basically everything ever.

enough to think it.
Hulk looks at Angry-Sad Cap. He's pointing at more bugs, bigger than Hulk's.
; Steve wouldn't take it back for
Tony's visited Peggy here enough times that he doesn't need showing to the sunroom. Surprisingly, it's actually an accurate name; the room is light and airy, pleasantly warm, and the scent of impending death that always suffuses places like this is almost unnoticeable. Peggy doesn't spend a lot of time in there, but the fact that she's out of her room suggests she's having a good day, hopefully better than she has the last few times Tony has visited her.
Again, it doesn’t seem like Clint actually needs Barnes to respond, because by the time Barnes manages to make himself move, Clint is on the back of a couch, sock-clad feet planted on the cushions. There’s an open bottle of beer in his right hand and a second, still unopened bottle on the coffee table in front of him.
Pepper departs for her next meeting shortly after this, while Bruce remains in the kitchen, picking at another slice of cake and trying to decide if he really wants to meddle in Tony's personal life the way he's about to. Reluctantly, he thinks he does, but he's also well aware of how inquisitive his friends are, and in the event that he is wrong he would prefer not to accidentally start a rumour that will undoubtedly work its way back to Steve and Tony eventually.
“But I left a
Only and entirely because of that, Steve does too.
Tony sees Barnes flinch out the corner of his eye, and rushes to add, “Not like that! He’s a friend, definitely a friend. Just… enthusiastic. Thought you should be warned.”
"That's what I said," Steve answers, a little too defensively.
“No,” he says sadly. “I don't think I did.”
"It's all yours," Tony says as the box clicks open, then proceeds to give a quick rundown of the shiny new features he's added to the primitive tech Wilson is used to: the controls for the Redwing drone; the goggles with built in HUD, a much simplified version of that in Tony and Rhodey's suits; the basics of the flight controls. Wilson's grin gets bigger the longer Tony talks, his eyes boggling, and Tony's not actually sure how much he's actually absorbed by the time he finishes up the explanation with, "Anyway, it's all super-intuitive, so I'm sure you'll pick the rest up as you go."
ass!” Bucky says again, even more emphatically. “Well, at least now I know why Stark looked like he was waiting for me to punch him the whole time Thor was talking. I mean, I knew you could be thick sometimes, but this really takes the cake.”
“Here,” he says, sliding the mug a few feet down the counter before setting the pot to refill, too, because at some point the rest of the team will pass through the kitchen and Tony’s fairly sure JARVIS will out him as the dick who finished it off if he doesn’t. “Brace yourself,” he adds, still not looking directly at Barnes. “We’re about to have incoming.”
when he pushed Tony about the fact that his parents were neglectful at best.
Clint crosses to it quickly, surveying the collection of belongings the Hydra goons took from him while he was unconscious. His phone is in pieces, and the meagre amount of cash that was in his wallet is missing (seriously, he can't have had more than six bucks in there, and the fact that some prick decided to take it is even more annoying than the way they got the jump on him), but his hearing aids are still there, undamaged, and Clint breathes a metaphorical sigh of relief as he puts them back in again; he can and does go without them when he's at home, safe, but right now he'd like to have a warning if the asshats who attacked him come back.
"Always," Bruce answers, his hands clenching and relaxing, the veins in his neck pulsing green. This is usually a danger sign, their cue to get the hell out of the room and put it on lockdown, but right now danger is exactly what they need. Tony moves all the way to the left, Steve to the right – pulling Sam behind him so that he can cover both of them with the shield – and the cluster of Hydra agents waiting to greet them receive a sudden and not entirely friendly introduction to the Hulk.
That was quite a lot for one go, Tony realises, and the fact that Bruce takes his sweet time suggests he thinks so too. Or, Tony realises, once Bruce actually does speak, he's just trying to psych himself up to say something he knows Tony isn't going to go for.
“We can leave telling people until tomorrow, though, right?” Tony asks, in the brief, brief pause between kisses.
They should talk about this, about everything, but Tony's knees are at either side of Steve's waist, his ass is pressing down on Steve's thighs, his lips are-
“I hope everything’s okay,” he says, rubbing the back of his neck. “The burgers are Sam’s mom’s recipe, he says they’re pretty hard to mess up, but, well, I wouldn’t put it past me to manage it.”
Hydra, he would fight. Steve or Natalia or the others, he would attempt to flee.
Tony left him to it yesterday, because clearly Steve has some things to get out of his system and if it’s bad enough for him to destroy two of Tony’s theoretically indestructible punching bags, he thinks violence is probably a better way for Steve to work out his anger than other, more pleasant activities. Plus, Steve knows where he is and has never hesitated to come find him before, so Tony had sort of figured he’d show up in either the shop or Tony’s bedroom as soon as he was done hitting things.
"Well, okay, then," Tony says on his way over to the minibar. "
"Tell you what, J," he says. "If you can get a hold of her, I'll ask for the file."
in place of a signature, like Tony didn't even want to put his whole name to it.
"No!" Tony snaps, then shakes his head, trying to take the angry edge off his words. "Thanks, J, but it's really not a good idea right now."
“Maybe not,” Barnes agrees, “But I am now. You fuck with Steve, it’ll be me that kills you, and I’ll be a hell of a lot less efficient about it than the Soldier was.”
, Tony thinks, but even he knows that's not an appropriate request to make in his current location. Instead, he nods in what Kimberly will hopefully interpret as gratitude, forces his smile a little brighter, and submits with poor grace to a pat down from one of the burly, well-armed security guards (and maybe Tony set off the metal detector, but he warned them in advance that it was going to happen so there was no need for them to overreact like that, but, hey, at least SHIELD collapsing hasn't reduced the security of their nursing home any).
the point), and landed Steve in the hospital with injuries that would have killed a regular person three times over. Sam has every right to hate him, and his willingness to pretend for Steve’s sake that the Winter Soldier isn't beyond saving in no way impacts upon Sam’s ability to loathe him in secret.
Steve doesn’t think he meant it as an actual instruction, but he’s perfectly happy to take it as one; when he completes his current lap of the park, he immediately heads for the tower, slowing to a slightly more reasonable pace in deference to the number of pedestrians on the street.
There’s fuck-all Tony can say to that, so he just sips at his wine, trying to stop his brain motoring on through the conversation before Steve has actually said anything, since he’s apparently already invented a non-existant break-up.
"That everything?" Tony asks, because cracking wise is preferable to either showing his surprise at the Soldier apparently disarming himself or demanding to know where the hell he was hiding everything.
“How did you get up here?” he demands, sounding slightly alarmed.
There is absolutely no question in Tony’s mind about how Barnes will take the news that his lover has been sleeping with another man, but he’s also pretty sure pointing that out is not at all in his best interest. He likes what he and Steve had before, even if he might have wanted a bit more dinner-and-a-movie than fancy-a-quickie, and he’s not going to risk his chance at getting it back by suggesting Steve maybe not hide from Barnes the fact that he’s sleeping with Tony.
"Tony Stark, get down from there this instant!" she orders. She's fully expecting to be ignored, which is why it takes her a moment to react when Tony's head appears out the back of the jet.
information, not that he can't tell them anything at all, meaning perhaps Bruce has more options than risking embarrassment and possible mockery by asking Tony or Steve.
"Yeah," Tony manages after the second iteration of this message (second one he's aware of, anyway, since JARVIS sounds worried enough to have been talking at him for a while). His voice is hoarse, the words coming out in broken bits between shallow gasps. "'M here, J. Don't- don't call anyone."
“Very good, Sir,” JARVIS says, relaunching all the holograms Tony closed down when JARVIS first told him Barnes was out and about.
to look like.
"Think it's dead now, buddy," says Arrow Man.
In response, the door to Sam's borrowed bedroom swings open, revealing a line of lights leading down the hallway. He follows them to the same fancy elevator that brought he and Steve up here earlier ("This is my floor," Steve explained, with the down-to-earth abashedness that is his real superpower, only to clear off to
It’s too late to worry about that, though, so Sam just throws his all into sprinting after Steve, only to stop very suddenly three feet into the Avengers’ living room.
"I believe you have Sir's best interest at heart, Doctor Banner," he says eventually "As such, I will endeavour to be of assistance to you." There's a pause, and the room gets noticeably cooler as he continues. "Should you ever give me cause to believe otherwise, please rest assured that I am both capable of and willing to make your life very difficult."
"You are?" Steve asks; after Tony leaving him like that, the only reason Steve can imagine him reaching out is if something big is going on, and in the Avengers' lives, big is never a good thing. "Is he alright? What's happened?"
They're in a little town not too far outside of Omsk celebrating the absolute obliteration of another Hydra base with crappy beers and a debate about their next destination when they're interrupted by Steve's phone ringing.
He thinks the Avengers know, but no one tries to stop him, nor do they try to remove his weapons after Stark gave them back.
“I like you, Tony,” Steve says, plain as day. “I like you a lot. A lot a lot, and I thought, if you wanted to, we could actually go out for dinner sometime?”
"Bucky," Tony says again. "As in, James Thingamabob Barnes, your BFF from way back when?"
Even muffled, he sounds sincere, far more than he ought to, given the circumstances, and Tony can’t wrap his brain around it. Steve could have called, but he didn’t, and now he’s back again, holding Tony, hands running up and down Tony’s back, every breath ruffling Tony’s hair, and he’s saying he missed him. Tony doesn’t understand it, can’t, and he…
It’s not that Tony’s bitter, and since he only leaves his workshop during the daylight hours very occasionally, he can’t really complain. He
Mentally speaking, he's all over the shop.
They can always talk tomorrow instead.
. She tried to force Sam in on it, too, but apparently he’s just as fearless as Steve is, since all he does is shake his head and leave the room, despite Natalia’s smile, leaving just the two of them to compete.
God, does he want.
The asset isn’t entirely sure he wants to stay (he’s not here looking for company either), but the archer is already scrambling to his feet and ambling in the asset’s direction.
No, Tony’s not doing it, no way at all.
"Of course I want to see you!" Steve announces. He's too emphatic, too enthusiastic, but since there's no one around other than the two of them and Tony's smile seems to be less mocking than it is surprised, Steve doesn't feel the need to tone it down any.

They're all too personal to throw out. Even though they're travelling under false identities and staying in the sort of places no one would ever expect to find Captain America, they still get the occasional
"I need to see that file," Tony says, though it's only when JARVIS replies that he realises he's done so aloud.
Howard Stark was never anyone's idea of a perfect man. He already had the beginnings of a drinking problem back when Steve knew him, and by all accounts it only got worse the older he got. He would flirt with any woman who stood still long enough, would do a hell of a lot more than flirt with anyone who returned his interest, and Steve doubts that stopped after he married. His awareness of other people's feelings bordered on non-existent, and there's no question at all that that ignorance coloured the way he treated his son.
Tony laughs. "Yeah, no, that's not happening."
"I know, Tony," Bruce agrees, his hands raised, palms facing outwards, and it's funny, isn't it, that his placating gesture is almost exactly the same as Tony's attacking one. Or, well, not funny, and probably not ironic, either. Just a coincidence. "It was pretty clear on the helicarrier that he's every bit as human as the rest of us. I'm just wondering if maybe he misunderstood something."
Even when he had a permanent home in Washington, Steve still came by the Tower reasonably often, but he hasn't visited in months, not since he told Tony and only Tony the Winter Soldier's identity. Bruce assumed it was because Steve felt his determination to find Barnes put him too much at odds with Tony, has even considered the possibility that Tony has suggested he not return (though, honestly, Bruce can't actually see Tony doing something so unkind, however hurt he may be), but…
"I couldn't possibly speculate on that," is JARVIS' response, which Bruce interprets to mean
"Right. I can see why that's complicated." After all, a previous boyfriend coming back from the dead as a tortured, brainwashed assassin can't exactly be good for a new relationship.
He stops, pinching the bridge of his nose and taking a series of deep breaths before turning back to whatever the hell it is he's working on.
"Ugh," Tony says again, though by now he's mostly resigned himself to the mortification of talking about his shitty non-love life. But, whatever, he'll do it, and if he's really lucky Bruce will fall asleep again and Tony will get the supposed cathartic benefit of spilling his guts without the person he's spilling them to actually remembering it.
Still, it's better than it could be, so Tony figures he'll go with it. "Live and in the flesh," he says, giving a little
, Sam thinks. Tony Stark's home. Totally explains everything. "Sure, sure," he says; since meeting Steve, Sam's life philosophy has mostly just been
"You ready, Bruce?" Tony says quietly, as the elevator begins to move.
"I just wish I knew what was bothering him," Pepper murmurs over coffee and cake four days after the mission.
"Don't let me interrupt, then," Clint says, promptly making a start on his dinner as Bruce picks up his story again, talking about this sculpture and that building, what Sam said about one thing and how Steve spent twenty minutes staring at another without saying a single thing, and it's at that point that Clint realises what's odd about this story. "Hang on, when was this?" he interrupts.
A human being on his knees, begging Tony the way he must have begged them back in the beginning.
Steve is aware of Sam moving, but it's a vague, distant sort of awareness, up until the point where Sam plucks the phone from his hand, which is also when Steve realises he's been silent for too long.
“I don’t think St-” Sam starts, only to stop very quickly when Natalia turns her gaze to him. “Um, two minutes? Is that long enough, Steve?”
Steve apparently doesn’t pick up on his confusion, or at least doesn’t realise it’s entirely genuine, because he takes another step back and says, “Stop being obtuse, Tony. I know you regretted it.”
“I’ve known you since you were this high, Stevie,” Bucky says, gesturing somewhere in the region of his knees (he’s exaggerating their initial height difference, Steve thinks, but perhaps by not quite as much as Steve would like). “Maybe you did a decent job of keeping it from most people, but, yeah, I knew.”
The masters aren't hunting for the asset. Captain America is, but he's expecting the asset to keep moving, not visit the place that its body once called home.
The base is situated under what appears to be the offices/warehouse of a completely normal transport company a short distance from their meeting point and, according to Steve and Sam's research (greatly assisted by JARVIS), the majority of non-subterranean employees have no idea that their workplace is a smokescreen for Hydra. Although Steve is of the opinion that anyone who sees as many
"That'd be because I have no idea what you're talking about," Steve answers.
Barnes’ expression, when Tony turns to look at him, very clearly translates to
It's fine, Tony tells himself, making his way up to the hotel roof to retrieve the suit from the quinjet. Steve'll call him once he wakes up, and they can arrange another time to meet up when Tony's schedule is completely clear for a few days.
Steve’s shaking his head, pacing back and forth, never coming closer or moving further away from Tony. “This is different, though,” he argues, though it’s far and away the least argumentative argument the two of them have ever had. “You have to understand that. This… It’s not just magnets for my shield or a new uniform, Tony. This is
“I can do cliff notes,” Tony says, in an
For a few seconds there's only the sound of Steve's breathing, and then, "Tony?" Steve asks uncertainly.
"Helicopter Parent, huh," Sam mutters, no expectation of an answer (Tony Stark: totally explains everything). He crosses the room to the chair where he left his pants and shirt not quite enough hours ago, tugging them back on and shoving his feet into his favourite, fight-friendly sneakers (not that he thinks that last part is likely to be necessary, but it never hurts to be prepared). "So, wanna give me directions, creepy ceiling dude?"
Somewhat foolishly, the only response Sam can manage here is, "Stark?"
“Because if you don’t agree, I’ll have to ask him.”
Steve sits up the second it does, reaching for the note, hoping against hope that it'll tell him something else, something good, something to convince him that this isn't what he thinks it is.
“Um,” says Tony, glancing over at Barnes again. “Yeah, Steve’s a good friend like that. Yeah.”
"Sir, Captain Rogers and Sergeant Wilson departed the tower approximately fifty-three hours ago," JARVIS reports, when Tony's had enough time to decide that he needs to know, even if he's still not entirely sure that he wants to. "They are currently investigating a Hydra base in Springfield, Pennsylvania. Would you like me to connect you to their communications system?"
"The Winter Soldier," Clint says, not entirely a question, though Tony answers anyway, particularly since Clint sees fit to surrender his beer.
“Oh, they’re still together,” Natasha chimes in, her sudden appearance making both Tony and Thor jump. “I think what you meant is
Natasha sighs down the phone at him, like Tony doesn't know that any sign of emotion she expresses is nothing more than an affectation.
The fact that Barnes suddenly seems to have turned into a human being is, on the other hand, faintly terrifying, not least because he’s just discovered that Steve and Tony are screwing and he’s swaggering in Tony’s direction.
"Captain Rogers has been in the gym for a number of hours," JARVIS says. "As per my Helicopter Parent Protocol, I am required to notify Mr Stark when team members begin exhibiting unhealthy behaviours, however in the current circumstances I feel it would be better not to alert him."
“Off,” he says insistently, tugging at the fabric bunched at Steve’s armpits until Steve raises his arms and shifts back just far enough for Tony to get him all the way out of his shirt. He runs his hands down Steve’s torso, all the way from his shoulders to the waistband of his trousers, nails dragging every place he knows is going to make Steve shiver, rocking his hips into Tony’s.
Her tablet pings, and Maria glances down at it, her heart sinking as she reads the alert. "Three confirmed injuries," she amends, "And one unconfirmed abduction-by-spider. Any questions?"
“Yeah, sorry, I remember Clint saying,” Bucky agrees, offering Steve an apologetic look before going right back to his point. “And of course I knew. You’ve never been subtle, have you?”
He's ready to head for the elevator, all set to finish up his
"Okay," he agrees; chair-bound as she is, she can't actually go anywhere, and the nurses have told him it'll cause her less unhappiness to play along than to tell her that there's now someone else living in whichever of her past houses she considers home. "I'll let one of the nurses know when I leave."
“Bucky was so insistent, though,” he says, like Barnes has seen them interacting enough to make a statement either way. No sooner has Tony thought it than Steve very effectively counters it, “And I figured he was wrong, obviously, but then when Sam came up he didn’t even question it. They both acted like it was a fact, insisting I should tell you, and I had to wonder if I agreed too quickly when you suggested such a casual relationship.”
"The message, Sir?" JARVIS prompts.
He grumbles his way back to the Tower, into the elevator, and up to the team kitchen, where he finds Pepper and Bruce eating sushi as they scroll through what seems to be someone's twitter feed and Tony mainlining coffee and determinedly keeping his back turned on the holoscreen.
, but we weren't
“Clint,” Natasha starts; no one else would notice the quaver in her voice, but no one else knows her the way he does. Even so, Clint only knows her recent history with the Soldier, not the beginning, and so he can't understand why she's refusing.
Again, Tony's not fully sure he's okay with that, but he's willing to pretend for the sake of getting what he wants (Natasha's spent the whole time Tony's known her doing the exact same thing, so she hasn't got any grounds for complaint). "Scouts' honour," he says.
Barnes feels the corners of his mouth twitch upwards, entirely without his consent, and he returns the gesture before taking a tiny, uncertain sip of his drink.
"Jesus Fucking Christ," Tony mutters, repulsor powering down as he lowers his arm. He flips his visor up and raises his voice for his next words, because he doesn't know how the fuck else to say what he has to say. "J, get a vehicle to my location ASAP. Something comfortable, nice and roomy, plenty of trunk space for the suit and Sergeant Barnes' arsenal, and then get a message to Cap."
"We had an argument," he says, which is both accurate and vastly lacking information. The same is true of his next sentence, too. "I didn't want to talk to him about it."
"Huh," Clint says eventually. "Guess that explains why Steve wasn't in a chatty mood before he left."
It's not just Steve, though. If Tony gets as wasted as he wants to be, he'll end up back upstairs yelling things that he's not sure he means, and the fallout won't stop at him and Steve. It'll roll right over the whole team, in a way they probably can't come back from.
"Thanks," Steve says, jamming his toothbrush straight into his bag along with everything else, then pauses in his packing. "Hey," he adds, waiting until Sam looks up at him. "Thank you, Sam. I don't think I could have done this without you."
"Sir is proving reluctant to join the call," JARVIS reports. "Attempting to override now."
"You've just been sending him Hydra bases, right?" he asks.
His cell has three identical doors. The first leads to a closet full of clothes in his size, comfortable and light, all loose enough to allow for easy movement without there being any excess fabric that might get in the way during a fight. That aside, they're all civilian clothes, lacking a sensible amount of padding or protection, and the asset wears his armour underneath.
JARVIS waits just long enough for Tony to be sure he's still sulking before answering. "If you mean the letter from Captain Rogers, I believe he left it on the bar in the penthouse."
Either way, he's not comfortable discussing the possibility with Pepper, for reasons that have very little to do with his uncertainty and everything to do with her past relationship with Tony.
Maybe those are his initials at the bottom of that blueprint. Maybe they're genuine, and Howard really did design the arm, but Steve doesn't, won't,
"As touching as all this is..." Bruce says, dust-dry. "Don't we have a building full of fascists to take care of?"
He’s not exactly surprised when Barnes doesn’t answer for a good twenty seconds, because from what he’s seen Barnes rarely speaks unless he’s thought through his words for at least that long.
"Hi, Clint," Pepper says, much more nicely. "Don't mind Tony, he's sulking but won't tell anyone why."
Bruce doesn't know what to do with that.
These wings are like those dreams he used to have, where he was running flat out and then, at the point where he couldn't possibly go any faster, he'd jump and just- take flight. No propulsion, no engines, no tech, nothing keeping him up there, just him and the air. Those dreams became less frequent when he started flying for real, then vanished entirely when he left the Air Force, replaced by warped memory-nightmares that had him waking up in a cold sweat night after night after night.
Sam sleeps in the jet on the way back. Steve doesn’t.
Steve’s getting at is, or how it relates to Sam knowing about them. “He guessed, after Barcelona.”

," Tony answers sharply. "Damnit, JARVIS, quit trying to make me talk to him. It's not fucking happening, okay?"
"Yeah, because rejection is exactly what I live for!"
The other three are silent for a bit, and then Pepper tilts her head to one side and says, "Should we be worried about this? It's so hard to tell with you all."
“Okay, Steve,” he answers, patting Steve’s hand where it rests on his chest. “Okay.”

Okay, so, if you've made it this far, I want to say thank you again for reading. If you enjoyed either the fic or the art, please drop us a line letting us know.
the first sound he's made since he showed up in this shithole, maybe for much longer than that.
Sam wanted to hate him, he really did, but looking at the man all he can see is a torture victim, a prisoner of war. A traumatised vet, and hell if Sam isn’t going to try and help him, even if it is so far above his pay grade he needs a telescope to see it from here.
Pepper was always good at remembering what his doctorates were (and, more importantly,
“Don’t I always?” she answers sweetly, smiling at Steve until he backs out of the room.

Tony, on the other hand, is well on his way to having a problem so, really, Clint helping himself to one of the unopened bottles of scotch in the elevator is basically his good deed for the day. He's not going to drink all of it, but a couple of glasses after an argument like that isn't an inappropriate response.
thirty seconds later), which sets off down without Sam as much as looking at a button. There's no awful elevator music, no sound either; the only way Sam knows it's moving at all is the swooping in his stomach, and even that seems muted somehow, far less than it should be in an elevator moving this quickly.
It’s the strangest cell the asset has ever been kept in.
"But, Pepper-"
"And? You say that about everything I do."
[Please.]
See? He doesn’t need Sam to talk to him about identity. He’s figuring that shit out all on his own.
(There's a set of blueprints for the arm, hidden in the depths of the Winter Soldier file. It's a work of genius, mechanically speaking, the interlocking metal plates concealing intricate circuitry that fantastically replicates the complexity of the human nervous system.
Sam hears the
He shifts away from Tony and rolls until he's facing the other way before sitting up, his feet on the floor, elbows on his thighs and head in his hands. "The things they did," he repeats, his heart in his throat, voice almost nonexistent. "The things they made him do."
Steve drifts on the edge of consciousness, more relaxed than he's been in a long time. After months of lumpy mattresses in uncomfortable motel rooms or hostel dormitories, even a cheap hotel would be a luxury, and the place Tony has picked is a long, long way from being a cheap hotel. The bathroom is beyond opulent, the air-conditioning has the room at the perfect temperature, and the bed is the largest Steve has ever seen and every bit as comfortable as those back in the Tower.
"Nuh-uh," he says. "People who lock themselves away for days only get beer if they explain what's bothering them."
” Steve says, trying to convey how serious he is, because he’s trying to be responsible and think things through for once. Yes, he wants to sleep with Tony, tonight and tomorrow and as many times after than as Tony is okay with, but not if Tony’s going to wake up the following morning and wish it hadn’t happened. It hurt, knowing that he was Tony’s mistake, and part of Sam’s many lectures on self-preservation has apparently sunk in because Steve doesn’t want to do this if he’s only going to get hurt again.
It's a bird, Steve realises after the fourteenth picture; an artist, Sam is not, but he is apparently very determined to get his point across.
“Oh,” Steve says, feeling a warm rush of relief, untangling the knot that’s sat in his stomach since that morning. “
Probably not tonight, though. Tonight, Sam thinks he has just enough energy to order almost everything on the room service menu, run himself a bath, eat his mountain of scary-expensive food while soaking his aching muscles in said bath, and then collapse into a deep, dreamless sleep in the largest, most comfortable bed he's ever seen before.
,” Tony hisses once his heart recovers. “You are not helping things.”
"I wouldn't presume to tell you what you should or should not care about, Sir," JARVIS says – lies, really, since he usually has a great many opinions on what Tony should care about. "I merely thought you should be aware of its existence."
“You know I
Of course he does, Steve realises, as Tony exhales further curses, inching his way out of the bed. Tony showed up to help because he's a fundamentally decent person, far more so than he gives himself credit for being, and then the adrenaline hit, the giddy rush of relief that they were both alive and unharmed, and good sense flew out the window. He wasn't thinking about the vast gulf between them when they fell into bed last night, neither of them were, and it was just like when they first started sleeping together, equal parts surprising and thrilling. Steve was too caught up in the moment to slow it down, too delighted to have another chance at something he'd thought he'd lost to make sure Tony was going to be okay with it when he woke up in the morning.
He's not okay, and he's not going to be okay until he knows that Bucky is, until Tony decides he's ready to talk to him again, until Hydra is gone for good with no chance of returning. Since talking won't help with any of those things, Steve would much rather not.
, but he is choosing it, claiming it for himself. He can be Barnes, and Clint can tell whoever he wants to tell.
"I don't know, man. Clint said there are rules about encouraging your ego." He smiles tiredly, then adds, "Seriously, though, they're amazing. Thank you. And thanks for showing up, too. I know that can't have been easy for you."
"Since 'it' is attending
"I have, Sir," JARVIS agrees, still unrepentant. "I was under the impression you would want me to do so."
"Absolutely worry about us, JARVIS," Wilson protests just as immediately. "Steve, please, I was just being noble. For the love of God, please don't make me sleep in the car again."
"Am not," Tony mutters sulkily.
“I think that's my line, Tony,” says the last person he was expecting to see here.
“Yeah, I get that,” he says, pausing for a long moment. “I'm not asking you to, I promise, but… He asked after you, Tash. Seemed pretty worried that you weren’t around.”
acid bath thing, and not, like, getting Hulk to eat him or something."

He's planned the hypothetical assassinations of thirteen random office workers (
Still, Sam and Bucky both maintain it’s absolutely necessary, so he’s willing to make the effort, and if his handmade burgers are really too awful to eat they can just throw them out and order in.
“That’s really not what I’m worrying about,” Steve answers, but he sighs, then sort of smiles. “Fine, I’ll go. Behave yourself.”
“It’s easier if you get it over with quickly,” Tony advises, when Steve continues to just stand there.
He trails off, pressing a kiss to Steve's shoulder, the closest Steve's ever seen him to being lost for words. His arms are threaded around Steve's waist, squeezing just hard enough for Steve to feel it, and this, the easy, comfortable, not-a-relationship-but-not-quite-not-a-relationship-either closeness Tony has with him, is what Steve was worried about.
"I didn't know you were still doing that," he says lamely.
“But it’s your house,” he says. “You should be able to feel safe here.”
At that, Tony shuffles back, propping himself up on one elbow and looking at Steve. "Okayyy…" he says, as somber as he ever gets. "You're trying to tell me that you, Mr
"Oh," Tony says, then kicks into the overdrive, mile-a-minute way he talks when he's not entirely comfortable. "Hey, well, since you're here, d'you want to come in? Share a drink? Or not, whatever, it was just a-"
Steve’s smile is smaller this time, more cautious, but Tony feels his own face answer it, quite without intending you to.
And, even then, JARVIS will know where he's gone.
Natasha doesn't so much as acknowledge that he's spoken. "Don't let Steve have a full translation."
"Understood, Sir," JARVIS says again, before lapsing into a very sullen silence. Or just silence, really, but Tony knows it's not a nice friendly one.
explain, stepping back until Tony has to choose between unlocking his legs from around his waist and falling off the workbench.
s, then nudges Tony aside, pouring coffee into both mugs and adding an insane amount of sugar to one of them. They both got over the desire to dilute their caffeine with milk decades ago, so neither of them is disappointed by the fact that the workshop fridge doesn't have any. "I brought cake," he says. "We're going to sit down, you're going to eat something, and then we're going to talk like adults rather than locking ourselves in our workshops and sulking like children, okay? And when I say
“But you… Everything you’ve done for him, that’s not just friendship.”
"What?" Tony says, in the moment before he figures it out. "No, it's fine for you to ask, but Rhodey's not as big on going AWOL as you are." A muted gasp comes through the phone line, and Tony realises his foot is still in his mouth. "Shit, no, I didn't mean us, Steve. I just meant, you go where you have to, but Rhodey will insist on talking to the higher-ups, and they're not going to give him permission, and- Look, I'm on my way back to the city, but if you call the Tower and let Clint and Bruce know what we're in for, they can have the jet ready to go as soon as I get there."
He knows how it'll go, because it's happened seventeen times since he met Sam: Sam will give him his
is Tony's immediate thought, followed closely by
“Hey, don’t let me interrupt,” Tony says, making a beeline straight for the coffee maker without looking at any of them. He’s obviously trying very hard to sound light, but it’s only sort of successful, and even that is belied by the fact that his shoulders are rigid with tension, spine just about straight enough to use as a ruler. “I mean, I’m a little offended you’re all apparently having a breakfast party in my own home without inviting me, but, hey, I’m the only one of you who works for a living, maybe you just thought I was too busy to join you. Which, yeah, I am today, absolutely too busy, but it would have been nice to be asked, you know?”
Steve grimaces; sure, he was turned down more times than he had hot dinners, back in the ‘30s, but he doesn’t need Bucky to remind him of it, even if he’s doing so in an attempt to cheer him up.
“That's how it is,” Barnes answers. “Problem?”
Fortunately, JARVIS seems to be doing a decent job of stalling Thor, because Barnes is still the only one on the communal floor when Tony steps out of the elevator, standing hunch-shouldered in the very corner of the kitchen, eyes darting all over the place.
Natalia laughs under her breath. “No,” she agrees. “They did things to my memory, too.”
“Go get changed, Steve,” she says abruptly. Judging by the way Steve jumps and glares at her, she’s probably also kicked him under the table.
FHD doesn't reply, his eyebrows drawn so close together they're almost one, and then he reaches for Clint's right hand, hooking a gloved finger through the rope binding his wrist to the chair arm. He gives it just as intense a glower as he's been giving Clint, then sets to introducing the rope to his knife.
It's the sound of the city, home, but that's unimportant compared to the fact that it's Tony's voice, and that in itself is less important than what Tony's saying.
Tony pulls up another screen alongside the file and the specs for the gauntlets, then keys in the code to start running diagnostics. He's not sure what he's expecting to find, or even if he's expecting anything, but he's not good at doing nothing.
"The locations you've been sending us," Steve explains, because he is extremely grateful that despite his anger Tony is still willing to help, even if he's getting a middleman to do the actual sharing of information. "Or the ones JARVIS has been sending, but I figured it was because you told him to, right?"
Tony knows about the Soldier's missions. He knows how the Soldier was trained and stored, about his skills and weaknesses, has unintentionally memorised the names, dates and means of execution of all of his victims. He knows about the Soldier's conditioning, far more than he could ever be comfortable with.
Bruce can't dismiss the possibility that he's reading entirely too much into things, because surely Tony 'Overshare' Stark wouldn't have kept quiet about the fact that he was seeing Steve, not given how enthusiastically he's raved about the man's assets. Then again, Steve is as reserved a person as Tony is extroverted, so perhaps he's managed to curb Tony's more explicit impulses, meaning Bruce also can't dismiss the possibility that he's
“Okay,” Tony agrees easily; given that he was expecting Steve to refuse, he’s not overly concerned by it, and, anyway, if Steve really wanted to do the touchy-feely thing he’d be talking to Sam rather than hitting stuff. “D’you want to fuck instead?”
Tony knows that's not what this is, that Peggy has never compared him to Howard and found him wanting (god, the praise she'd heaped on him when he closed down the weapons arm of SI still fills him with warmth after half a decade). He's just been visiting long enough that her mind is starting to slip, and asking her to talk about the past like this definitely isn't helping, but it stings him anyway.
The security guards on the door greet him by name, which is still a bit of a mind-fuck (he’s spent years knowing security would much rather move him out of places like this as soon as possible, so being welcomed is taking a while to sink in), and he throws a wink to the cute newbie working the reception desk on his way over to the elevator. She blushes, and smiles shyly, both of which are every bit as gratifying as they have been every other day this week, and Sam’s still grinning to himself when he rolls up at the Avengers’ floor to see whose turn it was to sort out breakfast today (it’s great that they all try, but some people were just not meant to cook).
, altogether undeserving of what happened to him (as if
The bed is empty when Tony wakes up, which isn’t exactly unusual. Now that he’s started up running again, Steve insists on going out first thing in the morning most days (and, as if that’s not already crazy enough, he chooses to do so outside, rather than in the state of the art gym Tony put a lot of effort into getting someone to design), so even when Tony goes to bed next to him he doesn’t normally wake up that way, and apparently Steve is stealthy enough to get up and get dressed without disturbing Tony.
Clint… shrugs. "I mean, kind of, yeah. It's what you did for the rest of us."
feel comfortable with it. Mostly, it feels strange, unfamiliar, and Barnes just sits there, still, and tries to work out how Natalia wants him to respond.
“Fine,” Bucky continues. “So, say you’re right, and the only person you asked him to hide it from was me? You ever think that’s maybe just as bad as making him hide it from everyone?”
, Clint thinks, turning to the two people in the room who don't seem to have gone completely insane since the last time he saw them. Unfortunately, they both look just as confused as Clint feels, so his silent plea for an explanation goes unanswered.
JARVIS hesitates a moment before replying. "There is an emergency staircase down the hall to your left, Sir. If you wish to use it, I will not prevent it."
Even if he's still the asset in his head, he is
His parents loved him. Tony knows that, even if it was twenty years after their deaths before he realised his dad didn't think he was a complete and utter waste of space.
“Widow, Hawkeye and Falcon are too fragile to go up against the Soldier, Thor spends half his time on another planet and the Hulk isn’t exactly good at following orders. That leaves you and Steve, and I know who it’ll hurt less. You care about him as much as I think you do, you won’t put him in that position.”
. "What's this one?"
(See the end of the chapter for
your old man."
"Good
Steve pulls a face like he's about to object, which, no. Tony's not arguing with him about this. If Steve wants to sleep in that shitty little car, that's his prerogative, but Tony is spending the night in whatever hotel JARVIS has found for them.
“I won’t hurt her,” he says decisively; if he was willing to let Stark take a free shot at him, he’s definitely not going to fight his spiderling, who probably deserves vengeance more than anyone.
, Tony reminds himself as he steps off the still cloaked jet.
The Winter Soldier killed Tony's mom, and Steve wants to take his side.
"Shit," he says again. "Pepper, I swear, I thought I was late, I-"
Still, he’s also not known for his patience, and Tony is fidgeting more than a little bit by the time Barnes finally answers.
," he says, "is that it can't be that important, if you won't remember it in the morning."
“I like coffee,” Tony says inanely.
“So, hey,” he starts, reaching for a second doughnut. “You remember that time you all fucked off to Spain and left me tied up in a basement somewhere?”
"Fine!" he announces, flinging yet another shitty virtual blueprint into the virtual trashcan, because three hours have passed since he closed the CCTV footage of his parents' murder and set to working on the tweaks Pepper is demanding he makes to the new StarkPad and he's still only managed to recreate the same problem over and over. "Where is the fucking thing, J?"
Tony's workshop is as noisy as it usually is, a combination of robotic beeps, angry hammering and rock blasted loud enough that Clint wants to turn off his hearing aids. Fortunately, the hammering and the music break off as soon as Tony realises he's there, before he has the chance to acquire any more damage than he already has. Unfortunately, the ensuing almost silence isn't actually a whole lot better.
as he's going to get, given that Bruce is pushing him into emotional honesty or whatever. "What is it you want to know?"
Sam leans back in his chair, hands raised in surrender. "Okay," he says calmly. "I just thought it was an interesting word choice. I mean, how did you know he was sneaking, if you were asleep?"
"And you, Peggy."
and he’s also not greeting Sam. “Sergeant Barnes requests that you return immediately to your quarters.”
“I missed you,” he murmurs, the words muffled where his face is pressed to Tony’s hair. “God, Tony, I know it’s… Well, even so, I missed you.”
He wasn’t expecting to be relieved, just like he doesn’t really think he would have been surprised if Barnes had said yes, Tony’s father was Hydra. Either would have suggested Tony still had enough faith in Howard to be disappointed by his being an even bigger jackass than he was to his family, and… Well, Tony would have said he gave up expecting better from Howard back before he turned ten.
If he's willing to die keeping Stark out of enemy hands, he might as well promise. He won't be alive to keep it.
Tony's getting dressed now, Steve can tell as much without opening his eyes. He can picture it just from what he can hear: the soft whisper of material as he pulls his shirt over his head; the zip of his fly and shthwap of leather as he fastens his belt; the faint thud of his hand against the desk as he leans against it to slide his shoes back on, one foot at a time. Steve helped him take off most of those clothes last night, touched just about every inch of the skin Tony's just covered up again, and it was good, it was
"Understood, Sir," JARVIS answers agreeably, but since he's getting his way there's no reason for him not to be agreeable.
There's yet another pause, long enough for Tony to reflect on his words but not so long that he manages to work out why Steve is hesitating again. "Right," Steve says, sounding kind of… hurt, maybe. "Sorry, he's your friend. It's not really appropriate for me to have asked."
"What can I tell you about Bucky Barnes, then?" she asks rhetorically, or so Tony assumes, since she carries on without waiting for him to reply. "Well, to begin with, he was a charmer, was Bucky. He was handsome, and he flirted as easily as he breathed. I don't believe there was a woman on any of the bases he was posted at that he didn't turn on the charm for."
There’s a lot of conditionals in there, but it’s also a lot closer to an affirmative than anything Stark’s said so far and Barnes thinks the man wasn’t lying when he said it was the best he’s going to get. And it
“Come on, Stevie. Stark obviously thinks we used to fuck, and that’s why you’re hiding your thing with him from me. What the hell were you thinking?”
Steve might not be an expert in 21st century pop culture, but he knows enough to know what that means.
Bruce doesn't know if he genuinely thinks the conversation with Tony was a success, or if he's merely imitating Bruce's sarcasm, but his response is the same either way. "How many times do you think Steve and Sam have had a very similar conversation?"
"Sorry, Peggy," he says, genuinely, achingly contrite; he should have known better than to ask her if she remembers something, that he's not even supposed to correct her when her mixed up memories aren't causing her distress or likely to lead her into harm. "I'm sorry."
"What're you working on?" he asks, because a) it's often a lot easier to get Tony to act like a responsible adult if he distracts him by expressing an interest in his work first, and b) Bruce actually
He knows Steve would answer, if he asked, as would Sam, but he thinks it would hurt Steve to know that he’s asking about Natalia and barely able to speak to him. He’s trying, but Steve knows everything about who Barnes used to be while Barnes is barely scraping by in return, and he doesn’t know how to ask Steve without it seeming like it he cares more for someone who isn’t there than he does for the person who is.
"I went to see Tony last night," he says. "I think I was planning on talking to him about how he's doing, and about- about us, but, well…" Steve fidgets a little, his face heating, very much uncomfortable with discussing his sex life in such a public location.
being honest," Tony protests, offended. "I'm not saying we weren't, you know,
Bruce shakes his head, just a little. "The same way you did?"
This is Tony he's talking to, so Jim’s fully expecting the answer to be a firm no – best case scenario, he picks up his story from where he left off, but it's far more likely that he'll start over so that he can be sure Jim’s heard absolutely all of it. He's surprised, then, when Tony thinks for a few seconds before answering.
“Uh-huh,” Clint says again, even more doubtfully. Nathalie doesn't argue, nor does she say anything else; sooner or later, Clint will get to his point, and she can wait an awful lot longer than he can. Sure enough, only a few seconds later he sighs, and there’s a definite note of desperation when he continues. “Look, Tasha, I get why you needed to do your own thing after everything that went down with SHIELD, but we could do with you here. Tony found Barnes.”
. There's nothing else, just a very wonky
He’s Iron Man, for crying out loud. An actual goddamn superhero, with the action figures and nemeses to prove it. He’s in his own home, he has the prototype mini repulsors on his wrists if Barnes even twitches the wrong way, and JARVIS is ready to sound absolutely every alarm in the building if he needs to. There’s no need for Tony to be nervous.
doesn't really work when for months Steve has been calling him and getting JARVIS instead is only a tiny, tiny part of his decision).
He's halfway to DC before it occurs to him that Peggy, given her Alzheimer's and her feelings for Steve, might not be an entirely reliable, unbiased source either, but by now Pepper will have discovered Tony's out of the shop. There's no way he can get back there without her catching him, and then she'll start trying to drag him to meetings, and it's not like he's got any better ideas so he might as well carry on.
"Files," Tony answers, fidgeting incessantly as he gives what is possibly the most concise and relevant response Bruce has ever heard him give to a question. Unfortunately, it's also entirely uninformative, and however long Bruce waits it doesn't seem like Tony intends to elaborate.
looks. Tony opens his mouth to come clean about him and Steve at least half a dozen times, if only because it'd be nice to talk through what the hell he should say to Steve when he sees him, but chickens out every time. It's just- if he and Steve don't work things out, he'd rather not have yet another failed relationship be public knowledge.
, Steve,” he promises. “JARVIS told me he was there. I wasn’t surprised.”
He waits, hoping Tony will drop the pretence and accept that Steve knows what happened last time, and that maybe Tony left a note but he didn’t actually want Steve to contact him. He waits for Tony to acknowledge that he’s being evasive, even if he knows better than to expect him to apologise for it, but Tony just continues looking at him.
For the first time since he escaped, the asset has been able to rest without fear that Hydra will come for him the second he closes his eyes, and he’s not ready to give that up yet.
"Tony," he says, after swiping at his phone screen, not making much effort to sound like he's not freaking out. "What's happened? Is everything okay?"
Tony very carefully bites back the
"I missed you too, Steve," he murmurs, gaze intent, focused. His hands are planted on Steve's shoulders, his body a warm weight everywhere they're touching, and Steve finds his own gaze drawn to Tony's mouth, his hands itching with the need to crush Tony to him.
Barnes grimaces, fairly sure he's not going to want to agree to Stark’s demands any more than Stark wanted to agree to his. He will, most likely, because Stark cares for Steve too much to ask anything unbearable from Barnes, and because, if he's completely honest, Barnes is more than a little scared that Stark will take it back if Barnes refuses him.
Clint ignores the bagels, instead taking a glittery purple monstrosity from the box of doughnuts. Sam was raised with some damn strict rules about food, including the fact that it shouldn’t ever sparkle (and it definitely shouldn’t be torn into pieces and dunked in coffee before it’s eaten), but he’s also far too sensible to argue with anyone as handy with a bow and arrow as Clint is, so that also goes on the
"And Tony's going instead?" she asks, now even more surprised.
Half the time, Steve doesn't even realise he's doing it. Or, rather, he knows he's drawing, but it doesn't really register until he looks down and sees that ridiculous monkey chasing after things it can't have, his mental state spread across the page for anyone to see.
approach, no arguments, no prevaricating, just a very straightforward
"It's not that I don't enjoy hearing about your life, Tony," she says with a smile, her frail grip on his hand tightening slightly. "And one day you or Steve will definitely have to bring this Thor to visit me, but I feel like there's probably a specific reason you're here today."
"But-"
The bath products smell familiar, even if the asset can’t work out why or where from. He doesn’t use them.
But, because Sam knows just how black a hole self-recrimination can send him into, he pushes himself to look on the brighter side, which is actually pretty damn bright. For the first time since he got here, Barnes has expressed a preference for something, and that’s definitely something to be celebrated.
Steve looks around at a room that is every bit as opulent as the one he left, and tries hard to pretend that the over the top elegance is something he could ever really feel comfortable with. His options for seating seem to be a spindly-legged desk chair, what he suspects is a genuine Victorian era fainting couch, and the astonishingly large and still perfectly made bed. Only the latter looks substantial enough to support Steve's weight, so he perches on the very edge of the mattress and pretends he's not jittery with equal parts post-fight adrenaline and anxiety about talking to Tony.
"Look," he says, faking calmness as best he can. "It was what it was, and then he told me his ex killed my parents and we broke it off so Steve could search for him. It doesn't matter who suggested it, because the whole thing's moot anyway."
“Okay,” Tony says, after a moment of that. “So, don’t think I’m not pleased to see you, because I absolutely am, but it’s been long enough that I’m entitled to ask. What brings you by, Thor?”
Bruce is at the table, unloading far more cartons of Chinese food than the three of them can eat in one sitting (assuming Bruce isn't planning on hulking out, at any rate), while Clint's ass is sticking out of the fridge.
As much as Tony wants to say he’s only begrudgingly accepting Barnes’ presence here, he can’t, not after seeing him on that rooftop, begging not for his life but for a quick death. Tony isn’t a saint, not by a long shot, but it would take a heart an awful lot harder than his not to feel something for him then, and one even harder than that not to break now, as Steve quite literally cries on his shoulder.
: What happened?
– but it's enough that Clint stops talking shit about Tony's parents. He shakes his head, then closes his eyes as he takes a deep breath.
"My apologies, Sir," JARVIS says. "Captain Rogers seems to have ended the call."
“So, it goes both way,” Stark concludes. “You turn, I put you down. I turn, you put me down. Deal?”
Bruce
!" Clint announces, loud enough that FHD flinches, but he's too occupied with picking up the shards of his almost new bow and muttering curses to apologise. He's going to have to ask Tony for a new one, which usually results in having to listen to him bitch about how he doesn't build them fancy, expensive equipment just for them to smash them to pieces at the earliest opportunity (not that any of them take him at all seriously, because everyone knows building new and better stuff is one of Tony's favourite things to do), but since all that shit went down between him and Steve, Tony hasn't been the same.
It’s definitely a matter for later, though, because Tony is already heading back to the elevator, coffee mug in hand, and Steve thinks making sure he’s okay probably takes priority.
Barnes shrugs.
"Oh, that Steve," Tony says dismissively, his best and most innocent smile firmly in place. "What about him?"
It's a bit of a surprise when the only people who answer Clint's distress call are Hill's minions. Not that he's complaining, because the Hill-clones are scary efficient (in addition to being practically indistinguishable from one another) and Clint's out of there barely twenty minutes after they rock up, but it might be nice for his teammates to express maybe a little bit of concern for him.
“You wouldn’t,” Steve answers, even though he’s about ninety-eight percent sure Bucky’s joking (and, Jesus, Bucky’s joking again. Steve would have given him the opportunity to yell at him weeks ago, if he’d know that was what it would take).
“Couch,” Tony says into their kiss, not wanting to move apart even for that long, so it comes out garbled and incoherent. That doesn’t actually seem to matter, because Steve is turning them around and lowering Tony to the closest worktable, and okay, fine, this is every bit as good, zero complaints for Tony on this one.
list, and the three of them continue eating in a semi-comfortable silence.
, the asset tells himself.
He can live with not being Steve's fuck-buddy or his friend, but he can't handle losing the Avengers as well, so right now he needs to be sober and rational and deal with this in a way that doesn't end with him pushing away everyone he loves.
reading too much into things.
“Or maybe you just need to think better of yourself, Iron Man,” Steve bounces back, like telling the self-proclaimed narcissist he should have a higher opinion of himself isn’t complete bullshit. “I do love him,” he continues, ignoring Tony’s grimace completely, “but not the way I think you think I do, okay?”
and he said
"Establishing connections now, Agent Hill," JARVIS answers, as the first reports of people drawing guns start to roll in, shortly followed by the news that bullets don't seem to be doing any good.
that wants to follow, on account of how he likes Bruce and Rhodey says he needs to start being better to the people he likes. "Or, well, I said
For more than a few moments, Tony doesn't say anything, though it seems like he's about to more than once. Steve hadn't meant it to be anything other than a fond, light remark, but it looks like what he's actually done is make Tony uncomfortable, and he's all set to apologise when Tony starts talking.
“But, seriously, if they can stick you in a chair and make you try kill your BFF, they can do the same to any of us and, like you said, I don't want to put taking me out on Steve's shoulders.” A pause, barely long enough for Stark to take a breath, and then, “Besides, I know how the fight on the helicarrier went, and the fact that lying there letting you smash his face in while he tried to convince you were buddies actually worked is just going to make him try the same stupid thing again.
"I need to tell you something," Steve says, once Tony's spent a good half hour rigorously checking him for lingering injuries (not that Steve's complaining about that) and then twice that long swearing at Steve for not calling him in to help (
But, okay, clearly Steve didn’t want to talk to him after Barcelona, but would it have killed him to say more than hello before tearing off after his precious Bucky again?
Tony doesn't answer.)
It’s a week before the asset decides to test it.
"A drink sounds good, Tony," Steve interrupts, stepping aside so that Tony can unlock the door and wave him in.
"It's fine, you can keep that," he says, nodding at his mug in Bruce's hand. "I'll get a fresh one."
“No,” Steve answers. “I guess I get why you thought that, but he’s… Bucky’s my Rhodey, you know?”
The horror of it renders Barnes silent, barely even breathing. The Red Room did awful things to their operatives,
Steve shrugs. “It is for me,” he says, like it really is that simple. “I’d do the same for any of you guys, and you can do the
The sound of Tony's repulsor powering up is both noticeable and more than a little threatening, and the Soldier's half flinch is gratifying enough to make up for the time Tony spent adding a completely cosmetic sound effect to his silently engineered weaponry.
It's not a question, so Tony doesn't actually feel the need to answer. "You took a copy," he says. "Send it to me."
There’s no buttons inside the elevator, either, and the asset immediately feels trapped. He thinks he could pull the doors apart, if he tried, but that doesn’t make him feel any less confined, and he doesn’t want to imagine what consequences he might face for damaging the building.
"Yeah, maybe," he says. "You want a drink? I'm getting a drink."
Barnes bares his teeth, as bad an imitation of a smile as Stark’s was. “You'll like this one,” he says, making it sound light, normal, as far as possible from the almost-desperation he feels. “If they get me back, you gotta promise that you'll put me down.”
"That's that, then," Pepper says. "Maybe we'll get lucky, and he'll decide to pull his head out of his ass all on his own."
JARVIS, being Tony's creation, hesitates only a couple of seconds before trying again. "I don't mean to cause you further upset, Sir, but murder implies a level of autonomy I don't believe Sergeant Barnes possessed at the time."
"So, what, he deserved to have his skull crushed?"
He looks up from his plate to see Steve frowning, sort of like he’s sad and sort of like he’s not go a clue what Tony’s talking about.
“This is usually where you’d give me your name,” Clint prompts eventually, still smiling, like maybe the asset isn’t making as big a mess of the interaction as he thinks he is.
Finally, just after noon, JARVIS announces that Tony has just flown into his workshop (unexpected, since Pepper was sure he took the Aston for his impromptu day trip), and that she has approximately three minutes to get to the roof before he leaves again.
"Oh," Sam says, still not quite operating at a hundred percent. Which sucks, because Steve is quite clearly in need of any support Sam can offer him, so Sam decides to pretend it's not ass o'clock in the morning and jams on his metaphorical counsellor hat.
"-And the best chance Steve has of finding him and of keeping him from being killed by your country or any other is to rely on your resources, but he told you anyway."
Barnes nods, having heard pretty much precisely what he was expecting to. “So, if I turn and Stark has to kill me, you’ll show this to Steve so he knows what I said, yeah? Hell, if I turn and Stark doesn’t put me down, show Steve. Make sure he knows Stark put his relationship above saving innocent lives.”
"I think I'm offended," Bruce says, fortunately not sounding it. "Man of Tony's approximate height and weight, give me all of twenty minutes and you wouldn't even know there'd been a body there in the first place."
Even though he is here to threaten Stark with physical harm If he voluntarily hurts Steve, Barnes doesn’t know if he would follow through on it. And if Hydra or someone else gets their hands on him, if they try to force him to harm Steve against his will, if he doesn't have a
"Fuck if I know, J," Tony answers, kicking off from the roof. "Guess I'll figure it out when I get there."
interested in Tony's work, most of the time.
“I believe so,” JARVIS answers just as quickly. “Sergeant Wilson, would you be willing to visit the communal floor for the time being? I can confirm that there is coffee there, and that Agent Barton is in the process of making breakfast.”
Still, it's cute that Stark is making the effort, so Barnes doesn't actually laugh in his face. Just looks as unimpressed as he can, right up until the moment Stark says, “I'm not breaking up with him for you.”
, but. Just, Buck reckons you like me more than I thought you did.”
"Ohpleaseno," is Tony's knee jerk reaction, which, he realises a split second too late, is probably exactly what Bruce wanted.
“It wasn’t planned,” Bruce says reasonably, when Tony actually pauses for breath. “Natasha decided we were having waffles, and everything went from them.”
The woman on the reception desk recognises him, not in the
"Stark," Natasha says, before he can hang up. "He told you."
"Huh," says Natasha. "I'll correct our records."
thing first. “You really don’t,” he says. “I knew this was coming, sooner or later. To be honest, I thought it’d be quite a lot sooner, actually.”
Still, Tony can totally convince Steve he’s wrong, if he puts his mind to it. There’s no reason this
There's silence, presumably while JARVIS tells Steve Tony will actually talk to him, followed by the faint static even Tony's tech has yet to find a way to keep out of international phone calls.
Tony thinks, though Steve doesn’t stop long enough for him to say it, just keeps going.
“-A child, you don’t have to coddle m-” He’s so busy defending himself that it takes a moment for Steve’s words to sink in, at which point he stops abruptly. “Hang on, you’re not?”
"Um," Clint manages. "Please don't stab me?"
