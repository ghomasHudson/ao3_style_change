“No.”  The force of the word cuts Sherlock short.  “My girlfriend’s just broken up with me because of you and I’m feeling more than a little cross.  So, if you could.  If you could fuck off, that would be great.”
“Sorry,” John says.  “Didn’t mean to interrupt you.  But I’ve got to go to the clinic.  Make sure you eat that, yeah?”
He feels John shaking with ill-suppressed laughter.  “Mad, you are.  And brilliant.”
The door of 221B opens to a hushed tableau – all is coppery stillness, the late evening sun streaming light through the parted curtains at the window. Sherlock reclines in his chair, basking in the honeyed glow with a rare tranquility that makes John stop and stare. He is not merely relaxed, but asleep, arms draped loosely over the armrests.  His head is tilted back to expose the pale line of his throat.  His soft, full lips are slightly parted and his lashes flutter as his eyes twitch behind closed lids.  Immersed in a dream, he is as peaceful and cozy as John has ever seen him.  The picture sends a twinge of pain to John’s heart.  He steps out of his shoes, crosses the room, and stops before Sherlock.
Sherlock understood.  He nudged the front door wide open and ushered John inside, releasing his elbow but keeping close until they got to his armchair.  John fell into it with a sigh and rummaged through his pocket for the pill bottle.  A drink would have to wait.
himself think – but obeys pure instinct, biting down on his lower lip and pushing his hips back.  John’s sigh unravels into a sleepy groan and his arms tighten as his own hips bow forward, pressing his cock to the cleft of Sherlock’s arse.  Sherlock fists the fingers of one hand in the bedclothes.  The other hand fumbles downward to grip himself, painfully hard and leaking with excitement.  A soft whine escapes him.
For an instant, John looked like he had been slapped.  Then the shock was wiped away by a wave of anger.  “Shut up.”
Molly waved a hand.  “We’re not bothered.  I’m her godmother, after all.  Besides, she’s so sweet.”
Sherlock tightens his fingers around John’s, feathers the pad of his thumb over a knuckle.  “I meant the bluff, actually.  I know many people, yes, but the owner of this restaurant isn’t one of them.”
“You haven’t,” said Sherlock.
“My brother has a special… fondness for Lady Smallwood.”  Sherlock cringed at his own words.  He had taunted Mycroft for not having a ‘goldfish,’ but to imagine his brother in any goldfish-related entanglement had the same effect as sticking his fingers down his throat.
child,” said the first.  “Humans age quickly, do they not?  He will be grown in a blink and gone in another.  Best to enjoy him while I can.”
He had just finished a job in Berlin when he got the text.
“It doesn’t really matter, anyway,” she had said.  “Nowadays, it’s only an honorary title.  And it’s not as if Sherlock would…”  She trailed off with a snort.  “Sure.  Let’s give it a go.”
They are married on a cold, dreary Saturday at the end of January.
An electrical pop cuts through the chatter and clatter of cutlery.  Sherlock and John look up in unison.  Lestrade stands, fiddles with his microphone.
She gave him a withering stare, fingers curled around the salad tongs.  “You’re terribly transparent, you know.”
“We asked Alexander if he wanted to join us, but on such short notice…”  Molly shrugged.  “He’s quite busy getting ready to head back to America.  Said he had a lot of important things to sort out.”
“Even unrequited love?”
Sherlock drags him into a kiss to shut him up.  There is a bit of a tousle; John's laptop is almost dropped, but eventually they make their way to the sofa.  Pinned beneath John, Sherlock arches up his hips, gasping as the hardness of John's clothed cock ruts against his own.  His heart races as he slides his palms beneath John's jumper and rucks it up, tugging it over his head and tossing it to the floor.  The moment he is freed, John comes back to him, fierce and flushed and hungry, hands questing over his chest, down his waist.  Sherlock's lips part and John plunges his tongue inside, tasting each hitching breath.
“Right,” said John.
“No need to fear,” says Sherlock.  “It’s gone now.”
“She will be,” says Sherlock.  “She’s besotted with Watson.”
“Sleep in my room tonight,” says Sherlock.  John blinks at the non-sequitur.  Uncertainty clots in Sherlock’s chest, but he forges onward.  “Your mattress is ancient; you’ve been having trouble sleeping on it for the last year, at least.  Honestly, John, you really should sleep in my bed every night.”
ready.”  Sherlock hears the petulance in his own voice, hates that the transport has seen fit to betray him at the worst possible moment.  For God’s sake, it isn’t as if he’s some blushing virgin.  His experience may be scant, but it must count for
“But!” Moriarty threw up his hands.  “Until then, I’ve got to make do.  Got a business to run, you know.  Even if it is full of hopeless sods.  Honestly, you can’t leave them alone for ten seconds before everything goes arseways.  Ridiculous.”  He shrugged with a put-upon look.  “But I have managed to scrounge a few diamonds from the rough.  That’s why I made this – to show you one.”
“Right, then.  Goodnight.  Or afternoon, I suppose.  You’ll be fine looking after Rosie for a few hours?”
“Oh,” said John, fighting not to cringe as the weight of the situation fell upon him.  Sherlock made no such effort.  Selkies and their daughters had been the subjects of marital abuse for years.  If someone stole their coat, they could no longer take seal form and return to the sea.  They were forced into a life of servitude, of bearing their captor’s children and keeping his home.  Only when they found their coat could they flee, and their abusers were careful not to let that happen.
A shiver skates down Sherlock’s spine as he pushes off the wall.  He fetches up the blade and waggles it at Piggy with a smirk. “Thank you.”
Sherlock is in no mood to be coddled.  Narrowing his eyes, he says, “I’m staying right here.  Lestrade needs my help, or he’ll be chasing his own detectives’ footprints around in the snow until daybreak.”
“No,” says Rosie, “it’s your turn now.”
Something niggled at John – a gap in the picture Sherlock had painted – but he was too exhausted to push for details.  Instead, he took a bracing sip of tea and prepared for the worst.  “And the shooter was…”
Violet stares at Carruthers with empty eyes.  Her jacket has been torn off and her right arm is sleeved in blood from shoulder to elbow, but otherwise she appears unharmed.
John stares at him in wonderment.  Then, nodding frantically, he shifts and thrusts into the slick, tight space between Sherlock’s thighs with a groan.  Prying one hand away from the bedclothes, John digs his fingers into Sherlock’s hip and fucks him desperately,
“You’ve both lived there for years,” says Sherlock, his voice like chipped ice.  “Have you forgotten?”
John’s mind registered these small differences like raindrops hitting a windowpane – a mere patter to the thunderclap of what he saw in Mary’s eyes.  In that flat, dead gaze, John saw the reptilian creature he had only ever chanced to glimpse.  A monster masquerading as human.
“Here we are,” Craig said.  He turned the laptop so that the screen faced his audience.  “So.  Took me a while to track him down, but—”
“Don’t encourage her!” John hissed.
“Maybe he isn’t a danger without his sister to manipulate him.”
“Don’t tell me you’re jealous of an invertebrate, love.”
“Oh, Sherlock, you can’t believe that’s true.  John—”
The buzzer rings.  Sherlock pays it no mind.  Minutes pass in silence and it slips from his thoughts entirely, leaving not so much as a footprint.
After Baskerville, Sherlock had watched John sleep.  That night in the Cross Keys, ensconced in one of their adjoining rooms, Sherlock had waited while John fought off a nightmare.  He could have stayed in his room, but he’d heard John and gone to him.
“That you like being rescued.  My damsel in distress.”
“This,” said Moriarty, his accent a lilting voiceover, “is Rosamund Mary Adelbert.  American,
“Don’t be daft.”  She pulled a chair to Sherlock’s side and took his wrist between her slim hands.  Sherlock bore her ministrations, silently chanting at himself not to commit homicide.  John would be cross if Sherlock killed Sarah. Probably. Most likely.
He knows it’s an unfounded fear.  But that doesn’t stop it from worming into his thoughts, gnawing into his dreams like a malicious parasite.
Sherlock made a room for John in his Mind Palace.
“Later,” he agreed.  His eyes slipped shut.  In a very short time, the warmth of Sherlock beside him and the rhythm of their twinned breathing lulled him to sleep.
A burst of inspiration:  Sherlock presses his thighs together, still slick with sweat and his own come.  “Like this, then.”
“You’re obscene,” he murmured.  “You know that, right?”  He squeezed himself one last time, wincing, and slid off Sherlock.  He turned and swung his legs off the bed, still looking at Sherlock over his shoulder.  “Madman.”
There was not a single picture of Effie or her mother to be found, but Sherlock wasn’t surprised.  As private as he was, it came as no surprise that Alexander would try to keep his wife and daughter out of the papers.   He could not, however, keep the details of their sad demise concealed.
The young man stared at his hand with suspicion, then took it in a brief, firm shake.  “You’re with the coppers?”
John’s expression darkened.  “I am absolutely
“Right,” he mutters again.  “Well.”
“We don’t have time to waste!” John barked.  “My daughter is in danger.  Get us a car
Sherlock hesitates, then concedes with a nod.  Between walking with Catherine and returning to Baker Street, the former is preferable by a slim margin.  “Fine.  Let’s… walk.”
“Do you want children?”
as the door is slammed shut.
Sherlock says nothing, but continues to glare in staunch silence.  Sighing wistfully, John moves to his side, tips up his chin, and kisses the sulking line of his mouth.  Sherlock springs into action, latching onto him like a barnacle, but John only draws away with a chuckle.  “You’re going to be trouble, aren’t you.”
John looked at Sherlock from the corner of his eye.  “Right.”
“Sherlock agreed,” Molly put in.
“Bet you never saw this coming.”
Later, John helps Sherlock into bed, divesting him of his clothes with a sort of reverential silence.  Sherlock lets himself be undressed; lets himself be cared for.  John hands him a t-shirt and sweatpants.  He sets to undressing himself, finds a t-shirt and a pair of boxers.  Turns off the light and closes the door.  They slip into bed, gravitating toward each other like two valence electrons.  Their faces are inches apart, brushing each other with quiet huffs of breath.  John reaches into the slim gap between them; Sherlock grips his hands, fingers intertwined.
John looks at Sherlock, the lines around his mouth and eyes soft.  He nods.  “Right.  You’re absolutely right.  Sorry, I…”  He breaks off, regroups.  “Of course I want to tell her.  It’s only…”
“You came here for the chair,” Sherlock surmised.  Wiggins’ instant of wide-eyed surprise confirmed it.  “Why now?  It’s been here for a month.  It could have been removed at any time.”
Sherlock leapt from the sofa like a released spring.  “Wonderful.  Spectacular!  Alexander, let’s be on our way.  Craig, perhaps you could get John a cuppa until he gets bored or is summoned away to suck bogies out of little Rosamund Mary’s nose.”
Rosie nods, sober expression belied by a trembling lip.  Sherlock steers her out of the office, past Ms. Carvel, and into the hallway teeming with students.  They don’t speak a word until they’re out of the building.  As they stand on the curb, snow crunching and soaking into their shoes, Sherlock exhales in a feathery gust and says, “Tell me what happened.”
“I do have questions,” I say, “if you’re willing to answer.  I was wondering if you could tell me about… about my mother.”
Lestrade shook his head.  “The baby is fine, I promise you.  Well, she’s having a bit of a meltdown, but that’s to be expected.  They’ve had a fright.”
John strides in, looking bemused.  “What’s this, then?”
Confusion flits through Elise’s dark eyes, but she only smiles.  “It’s just as well, really.  I’m here with Catherine.”
The pen halts mid-signature.  A compliment from Sherlock Holmes.  It’s almost worth Donovan’s written complaint.  Greg taps the papers into a neat stack and grins.
Violet looks at him, jaw set.  “I looked you up, Mr. Holmes, and with all due respect, I doubt you’ve ever had to pinch pennies.  You’ve probably never lived in an awful flat, never skipped a meal you didn’t want to. So yes, I took the job.  I needed to eat.”
“You’ve done it before.  I don’t see why it’s suddenly beyond you.  Age finally catching up to you, is it?  Or perhaps it’s the four pounds you’ve put on since last month.  Weight gain will do a number on your endurance.”
“You have no desire to be a mother,” said the other woman.
Rosie is silent for a long moment.  Then she blinks, blinks again.  Tears well in her eyes and slide down her cheeks.  Voice wobbling, she says, “Sh-she made fun of me.”
On the far side of the room stood the Mazarin Chair.  The pale stone gleamed from its nest of vines in the splat.  Identical to its sibling at the shop in every aspect, save for—
“John.
Angelo came ‘round to give John his cane.  Watching John hanging out the door, lifting the cane in farewell, Sherlock could not fight back a smile.
culture and ruined his entire experiment.  The row had been catastrophic.
Harry lifted her ID card and flipped it over, displaying an insignia printed onto the plastic: a simple graphic of dragonfly wings.  Sherlock studied the insignia, apprehensive.  Fair Folk and mazikeen were required to declare their species on official government documents – licenses, passports, visas – but the same could not be said for businesses.  He looked at Harry.  Her set jaw and intent stare told him all he needed to know.
“That’s enough,” said Maili.  “He’s only a child.”
Fury flashed through Mycroft’s eyes, muzzled and coldly controlled as soon as it arose.  “I have her husband and infant child.”  His gaze slid to Rosie and away.  “Although I can see from no less than three suffocation attempts that her regard for little Rosamund
Despite sitting, despite being shorter than the average man, John has the uncanny ability to look down his nose at someone.  He does so now.  “Mr. Wilkes. It’s Dr. Watson-Holmes, actually.”
Mycroft was silent for a moment.  When he spoke, fury trembled in his voice.
A shout from the flat made him pause mid-way down the stairs.  “
John notices, of course.  Smirking, he rises on tip-toe and says into Sherlock’s ear, “Do you know how many times we’ve come here and I’ve thought about dragging you into a broom cupboard or an empty office?”
Sherlock’s heart thunders in his chest.  He remembers, suddenly, the first time Rosie said his name; how she couldn’t string the syllables together, how the cadence of
“Take off your clothes,” John says, and Sherlock scrambles to comply.  Each garment puddles on the floor until he stumbles into the tub, naked and hard, folding himself around John.  They’ve tried this sort of thing before, with mixed results – someone inevitably slips, cramps, gets shower water sprayed in their face.  The bath is not nearly as conducive to fucking as Sherlock would like, but right now he’s too desperate to care.
John glances at him, and something in his gaze snatches Sherlock’s slipped moorings.  The fear rising in his chest sinks back down.  Biting his lip, he nods.  John turns back to Rosie.  Her eyes wander from John’s face to his and Sherlock’s joined hands on the tabletop.
”  Sherlock exhaled the word on a sigh.  “And don’t bother getting up.  You can’t come along.  Mrs. Hudson, try not to be too much of a nuisance.”
I didn’t cry.  –SH
In Sherlock’s humble opinion, Rosie is something of a prodigy among her peers.  Sharp and independent, she is bound to grow into a woman to be reckoned with – a woman who will know what she wants, and who will have few scruples getting it.  Having an adrenaline-addicted doctor for a father, a psychopathic ex-assassin for a mother, and a sociopathic genius for a godfather will do that to you.
I know you act like you don’t care about your body, but you do realize your brain is a part of your body, yes?  That damaging it will ruin you?”
Minutes later, Rosie falls asleep slumped against Sherlock’s side.  The sleeve of digestives, half-empty, threatens to roll from her inert fingers.  Sherlock extricates it with great care and sets it on the table.  Sitting back, he finds the remote and lowers the volume to a muted hum.  Pictures flash across the screen, but they mean nothing to him – his focus is on the child at his side.
“Sherlock,
“You do so well with her,” Mary said.  They watched Rosie for a few moments before she spoke again.  “Oh, I forgot to mention – I was going to try picking up a half-shift this Saturday.  I asked Helen and she said it couldn’t hurt.  They’re understaffed and we could use the extra money.  Is that okay with you?”
As always, if you see mistakes, please let me know so I can correct them.  :)  Happy Holidays!
John studied the form for a moment.  “Who’s Evelyn Ferrier?”
John understood; the same need hummed under his skin, burning down to his fingertips.  Dropping to one elbow, he angled his head and pressed his lips to Sherlock’s.  Sherlock whimpered into John’s mouth, hands skittering down his front, fumbling with the buttons of his shirt.   In seconds he was pushing the open shirt off John’s shoulders.  John sat back on his heels and freed his arms from the sleeves.  Sherlock had shrugged off his dressing gown, and John grabbed the hem of his t-shirt and peeled it away.  Sherlock stilled.
I choose my words with care.  “My dad told me about you.  My adoptive dad, that is.  Alexander Grant.  I… ever since I can remember, I wanted to meet you.  All orphans do… but then again, I suppose I’m not really an orphan, am I?”  A nervous laugh bubbles out of me.  I will myself not to bolt for the door and tear down the street, put this whole endeavor behind me.  “Dad, well, he never really said so, but I knew it hurt him.  Until he offered to tell me your name.  So, um.”  I gesture to myself, feeling small and silly and insignificant.  A cast-off child.  “Hello.”

“What,” John snapped.
He heard Shan snarl,
laugh, then – a startled bark, dissolving into giggles as he covers his mouth. “Um, no.  No.  I don’t think the publisher would be too keen on that.”
Sherlock bristles, hot with jealousy; “love” is
John tries to articulate a response, but all he can manage is a sort of strangled whimper.  Sherlock is pressed flush against him to hide them both behind the doorframe.  A thousand pinpoints of touch connect them, and for John, each is wired to a neuron lighting up like the bulbs on a Christmas tree.
“You’re going to see Harry,” said Sherlock.  “Why?  You made it quite clear you have no interest in associating with her.  Unless…”  He paused, waiting as more clues came to light.  Shadows under John’s eyes: sleepless nights.  Red crescents on his left palm: constant stress, repeatedly curling his hand into a fist.  The empty glass beside his laptop, filmed with the dregs of scotch.  Two fingers: bracing himself.
The daze is of mixed wonderment and disbelief, like a mingling fog of two strong scents:  the sweetness of cinnamon and burnt sugar paired with fetid swamp water.  And still, days after being submerged in it, Sherlock is no closer to wandering out than he was at the start.  He bumbles from amazement to confusion to doubt to terror and circles back again.
“Ah.  Well.”  Sherlock eyed John’s armchair from across the room.  The pink polyester casing and handle of the bag protruded over the edge of John’s Union Jack pillow.
Sherlock stands, wincing, and clicks shut his magnifier.  “The murderer used a length of piano wire made from a steel iron alloy.  The serrations in the spine are quite distinct.  Piano wire is typically made strictly from steel; the alloy is unusual. We simply need to find where it was made and trace the killer from there.”
“A lot,” said John.  He looked back down at Rosie.  She had fallen asleep, her tiny fingers curled around the cuff of his sleeve.
Slipping off his shoes, John padded across the lino and through the living room.  Mary tended to pass out on the sofa during Rosie’s sporadic silences, but her spot was empty.  A faint outline of her form creased the cushions.
dream– he embellishes, threading the sound of that shivering breath into Sherlock’s gasps and cries, stoking his own desperate rhythm to a knee-shaking climax.  Even asleep, he has the presence of mind to clench his teeth.  To hold the name in his mouth as the fever burns through him.
“Yes,” said Sherlock, and whirled around and stumbled out of the crowd.  He narrowly avoided knocking John over in his headlong flight.  It was by some twisted sense of grace that he managed to stagger to a public bin before vomiting, sweat springing to his skin as convulsions wracked him.
Maili’s pale face flushed.  “You shouldn’t laugh.  We’ve already gone too far, Eirene.”
“You smell like formalin.”  John sniffs once for good measure and frowns.  “Do you know, I don’t mind it.”
Sherlock responded with a forceful kiss.  John made a high sound of amusement in the back of his throat and Sherlock slipped his tongue between his lips, determined to silence him.  It worked – the pitch lowered into a hum as John opened his mouth, letting Sherlock in.  They kissed deeply as John worked Sherlock slowly, torturously toward his peak.  When he reached it, he came with a shudder, clinging to John’s shoulders.
“‘Course.  I won’t tattle.”  John debated winking, but suddenly felt as if all the energy had gone out of him - his insides were leaden and sticky with dread for the knowledge he held in his hands, an obscure sense of shame.
Again Rosie says nothing.  Sherlock can see not a shred of remorse in her eyes when she glances at Samantha, glances at Ms. Helens, and dips her head.  It’s like watching a statue crumble.
He waited with baited breath; the reply knocked it out of him in a convulsive bark of laughter.
Sherlock, relieved that he had the foresight to take her practice violin, glowers at her.  “Don’t be daft.  You haven’t played long enough to properly hate it.”
doing here?” John snarled.  Wiggins shot him a mulish glare, only to flinch as John twisted his wrist.  “Explain yourself.
“Breast milk,” Sherlock supplies.  “If that comes as any surprise to her, she truly hasn’t got a brain.”
“Rosie and I can keep each other company for a few hours,” he said.  “I don’t think we’ll manage to burn the house down.”
Catherine’s brow furrows and she begins to draw her hand back, glancing at Elise.
John mutters, disentangling himself from Sherlock.  “Shit, shit,
“We can’t just—”
“I see congratulations are in order,” he said.
And so, a few days later, Sherlock finds himself in a contemplative state of sorrow as he and John stroll side-by-side through Hyde Park.  John keeps a brisk pace, cheeks flushed with the chill and silver-gold strands of hair tousled by the wind.  To look at him, you would never guess that he almost choked fatally on sea-phlegm.  Small mercies.
“Try again,” Sherlock said, “and don’t bother lying.  I’ll know, and John will be utterly
John strode into the kitchen before Sherlock could reply.  There was a briskness in his step, a buoyancy that shook years off his countenance.  Sherlock busied himself with his tea, hoping the steam rising from the cup would account for his flush.  Judging from Mycroft’s weary expression, it was a futile effort.
.  For God’s sake, he is a wreck.
In the end, after excessive cursing, throwing on his jacket, shoving the gun into an inner pocket, and locking the office, John raced out and hailed a cab.  Something in his manner must have unnerved the cabbie, who sped Eastward at a quick clip.
Snicking the magnifier shut, Sherlock stands.  He shouldn’t be surprised that John wants to date again.  If anything, he should be surprised that John has waited almost four years.  Ever since Mary… well.  Perhaps Sherlock is mistaken.  Perhaps four years isn’t so long a time when you’re a widower.
Sherlock sets his jaw and nods.  It seems an impossible task, but he will try.  For John.
Sherlock nods, fingers tightening around his wrist.  He knows he should send John away, but at the moment, he cannot muster the willpower.
“Mary was looking for something another person hid,” said Sherlock.  “Leverage against her.  Leverage
“Lay Rosamund down on the table for a moment.  On her back.”
But Oldacre is upon him, slamming him to the floor and wrapping his hands around his throat.  Sherlock stumbles, eyes streaming, each breath a gasp.  His vision blurs so Oldacre and the surrounding flames melt into a demonic chimera.  The hands at his throat tighten, bending cartilage and vessel and bone.
They sit in companionable silence for a spell, watching the miserly Scrooge learn about Tiny Tim’s fate.  Rosie goes very still when The Ghost of Christmas Yet-to-Come arrives, cloak billowing and face in shadow.  Sherlock crooks an eyebrow at her.  “Are you frightened?”
“It’s okay,” Catherine croons.  Rosie sobs and the knife flashes closer, closer to her cheek.  “Sshh, pet.  Don’t want to cut up your pretty little face.”
“Sherlock!” John hissed.  His fingers curled in the fabric of Sherlock’s coat sleeve, dragging him back to the present.  His eyes were wide with ill-restrained panic.  “What happened?  Is Rosie...”  His voice betrayed him and he stared, pleadingly.
“Shit,” John mutters.  “Shit, I’m sorry, Sherlock.  I was just—”
“No,” Sherlock grumbles.  “I hit my head
John shrugs, expression glazed.  He smothers a yawn with the back of his hand, jaw creaking.  “Dunno.  You need more rest, and when we
“So,” John says quietly, “Dover Castle.”
“Yeah, um.”  John stood and, though Sherlock loomed above him, managed to look upon the detective with a captain’s disdain for an unruly underling.  “If you could pull your head out of your arse, Sherlock, that would be fantastic.  I think we can both agree that I’m generally helpful when you go rushing into danger, yeah?  So, shut.  It.”
The news is not a punching blow nor the bite of a bullet.  It is a knife, sliding into the tender places between ribs in slow increments.  An anticipated attack.  John can’t even find it in himself to be mad, not really.  Perhaps, after watching him fall and watching him bleed out on the operating table, John has become numb.
Mrs. Hudson narrowed her eyes at him.  “Yes, and it’s this:  if you plan on going back to Mary when this is all said and done, I want you to go up there, have your little talk, and then
“I’m c-cold.”
Pepper waves off his unspoken doubt like she would a gnat.  “Please.  A book of your adventures with Sherlock Holmes?  People have been waiting for this.  Especially now that you’ve got rid of all the dry bits.”
her.  Not a word, understand?”
Inside, the flat is as desolate as the rest of the building.
Sherlock hummed, pulling out his mobile and starting to text Lestrade.
Outside, the sun rises in an opal-blue sky.  Sherlock and John finish their breakfast and set to work clearing away the debris of Christmas.  They bin wrapping paper and bows, strip down the tree and fold the stockings.  All the while, Sherlock’s thoughts drift to his sock index, to John rifling through it.  Warmth suffuses him, but there is nothing acrid in it, nothing shameful or afraid.
Sherlock broke the surface of the pond spluttering and gasping.  As water and pond scum and the echoes of Eirene’s furious screams drained from his ears, he became aware of a frantic barking.  And, even more frantic: his brother’s voice.
Mrs. Hudson waved a hand.  “It’s nothing.  Now, how do you feel?”
that’s strictly true if you don’t consider illegal immigrant Fair Folk.  But one could have—”

McFarlane shrugs in disbelief.  "It's mad, isn't it?  I'd never heard of the man before he asked me to draw up the will.  But he confessed to the whole thing.  Said he'd been plotting my downfall for years."  He shakes his head, takes another drink.  "I'd never
John looks at him.  It’s a steady, impassive look, without anger or reproach.  Once, such a look would have infuriated Sherlock – he would have seen it as a challenge, the unspoken version of a gauntlet thrown.
I'm Zingiberis on Tumblr.
A palm settles at his jawline, thumb sweeping the corner of his mouth. “How?”
The Times rustled as John raised it again with a noncommittal grunt.  “No, you really aren’t.”
:  darting across the surface of the pond, blurringly swift, flew the damselflies.  Hunting, probably – they were vicious predators.  Even the nymphs ate other insects.  Sherlock watched, entranced, pen poised above the blank page of his notebook.  Waiting for one to come close enough to sketch.
Anderson, of course, seized upon the lowest hanging fruit.  “Maybe a Fae killed him.  Maybe they didn’t want change, so they silenced him.  This is all pretty weird, innit?  All the blood drained out?  Could be a redcap.”
“You’re,” he croaked.
“Who’re you, then?” he asked, eyes flicking from them to the doorway of Lucy’s flat.
“Sherl—oh.  Well.”
He must have shifted in the night, for though John is nowhere to be seen, he is certainly
Andy shrugged.  “She said she had to get it just right.  I dunno, I’d have drunk swill if she offered it to me, but she was…”  He blanched. “She

that has accompanied the others.  He peruses shelves of scotch and Irish whisky, staring into amber glasses and finding his own confusion reflected back at him.  He studies Swiss watches and leather shoes and silk ties and knows, with a keen sting of love, that John deserves them all but that none of them are
“Sherlock,” says John through gritted teeth, “Sherlock, I need—”
“What’s next?” he asks.  “More cinderblocks for shoes?  Me sleeping with the fishes?  Although I must admit, that tactic worked out quite well for me.  In the long run.”
My heartbeat stumbles at the sound of the pet name.  Dad never calls me Rosie – only Cathy, or Catherine when he’s cross with me.  I grew up giving my middle name little thought.  It only became relevant when Dad sat me down – twenty-two and fresh out of college – and offered to give me the name of my birth father.
On the last day of the year, as they wait outside Sammy’s family flat, Sherlock says to John, “We should tell Watson.”
outside her sphere.”
John shifted, and his hand dropped from his hair to sweep a path across his chest. His fingers brushed the edge of Sherlock’s wounded hand and Sherlock drew away with a pained hiss.
Sherlock had heard John, and he had given him that miracle.  He’d come back.  And all John could do was give Sherlock a sliver of hope.  It was a doomed hope, as slender and frail as a winter-waned twig.  John could snap it in two with a word.  He could give Sherlock the plain, cruel truth and urge him to help him find Rosie.  Focus on someone who could be saved.
Sherlock was perplexed.  “That’s what I was suggesting.”
“I do,” says Sherlock.
Light erupts, piercing the black void and throwing shadows into corners.  The laughter swells and reverberates through the room, amplified and multiplied like the joined voices of a murder of crows.  Slitting his eyes open, Sherlock glares in the direction of the light.
Mary sighed again.  “You Holmes boys are bloody nuisances.  Can’t say what you’re told to say, can’t die when you’re shot in the heart.  Maddening.”
A set of furniture came into view, half-concealed by a marble statue of a couple in a tender embrace.  Sherlock strained his gaze as they drew slowly nearer, but he could not make out the details of the chair.  Perhaps he had been mistaken.  If Mycroft wasn’t here, there was no reason for Mary to strike.  Everything would be fine.
I am full of surprises.  –SH
Sherlock does.
“Thank you, Mrs. Hudson.”
Sherlock studied him for a few seconds of silence.  Then, flicking his eyes down to the hairy corpse, he said, “I take it Molly and George are doing well with Rosie.”
The cold air lashes Sherlock’s face as he stalks through Regent’s Park, his every breath dragging out behind him like a snapping banner.  Snowflakes arrow through the air and prick his face, but he presses on, determined to create more distance between himself and Baker Street.
?  It’s a body.  Fished it out of Surrey Water.”  Another sigh, draining the fury away like pus from an infected wound.  “Just… hurry.  You’ll want to see this.”
John goes to the loo and twists the shower lever, jetting hot water into the stall. Steam curls in the air as he tugs off his sweat-encrusted shirt and bloodstained jeans.  The nurses cleaned off the cuts on his face, but the itch of stale blood crawls across his skin.  Tossing aside his clothes, he steps into the stall and lets the scalding water buffet him.
“That’s because you’re you,” Sherlock snips, “and I’m me.”
Sherlock hums, the low noise vibrating through his body to resonate into John.  “Bit weird.”
– Sherlock couldn’t bring himself to care.
The memories last for a few heartbeats before they vanish, usurped by the warm solidity of Sherlock’s body pressed against his.  John sucks in a breath.  Prays Sherlock can’t feel his heartbeat reverberating through his ribs.
“Why?” Sherlock presses.
She pats his cheek tenderly and moves on before Sherlock can fathom a response.  A pocket of silence cloaks him, suffocating and alone.
“Oldacre,” Sherlock croaks.
“It means,” says John, “that you’re wearing me out.”
“Sherlock,” she calls, “there’s a letter for you.”
“I said none of this was necessary,” said Alexander.  “I know you’re smart.  I’ve read the blog, the one by that bloke who follows you around.  John Watson, was it?”  He glanced around the kitchen, as if expecting to find John shooting up at the table.  “Is he here, too?”
“Are you all right?” he asks.  “You look a bit peaky.”
to break your arm.”
Sherlock drags out his chair and sits at the table.  Picks up a pen and starts scrawling mindless circles into the nearest sheet of paper at hand.  Black chaos unfurls across the page.  Words bubble up his throat, bilious and foul.  An illness he has nursed for years.  “I can’t.”
“Don’t call her that.  The woman I married doesn’t exist.”
“No, no,
“Hmph.  Fine.”  John gave the memory stick a dubious side-eye.  “If that thing gives my computer some kind of… psychotic virus, you’re buying me a new one.”
“Glad there’s a line somewhere,” John sighed.
The look lasts less than a second, though Sherlock feels the contact stretch between them like a rubber band reaching the breaking point.  John is the first to look away; the band snaps, stings Sherlock with the recoil.  He drops his gaze back to the murk of his tea.
“If you say
John’s movements were swift and sure.  Before Sherlock had fully processed Moriarty’s command, he felt a knee dig into his back, forcing him onto his stomach.  John’s hand slipped from his collar down to his wrist and pinned it to the tiled floor.  The blade came down.
Sherlock glares, affronted.
Sherlock is staring back at him, eyes wide and lips parted.  His skin is bone-white, his curls in matted disarray. He is beautiful.
this,” Sherlock accuses.
“You do all of this,” he said.
“What—who the bloody hell is Craig?”
John schooled his expression to indifference.  “I’ve got to go.”
Sherlock thinks of Charles Porter with his eye put out by a sharpened candy cane.  He thinks of Theresa Goodwin, face pulverized and fingernails ragged from being buried in coal.  Edmund Brown, skin the blue of a robin’s egg and tongue poking out between his lips.  None of these deaths have been
thinks all that Father Christmas rot is ridiculous, of course.  But John has notions about happy childhood, of which Father Christmas is a linchpin.
Sherlock crests a great wave.  In his mind’s eye, John is kneeling beside the bath, an easy smile creasing his face as he dips his fingers into steaming water.  The pads of his fingers brush Sherlock’s bare knee, as quick and delicate as moth wings.  The fingers meander upward, drifting to Sherlock’s inner thigh.  Sherlock shudders, sighs; John’s smile widens.
“What she didn’t understand,” said Sherlock, “is that the peaches would only grant immortality if grown in Faerie.  She grew them here, in the human world. She must have realized her mistake at some time or another, and started looking for ways to bring out the peaches’ power.  Hence the tea.”
“Did they give you painkillers?”
Irene –
“Could be nice,” Sherlock says.  His attempt at levity is just as shoddy as John’s, the emotion behind the thin veneer just as intense.  “And keep me from getting bored.”
Fuming, Sherlock stalked up to John’s room.  The door was locked, but such things were child’s play to Sherlock’s nimble fingers.  The bolt slid free and he turned the knob, pushed the door open with a creak.  A beam of light from the corridor pooled on the floor, illuminating John’s room:  Spartan, but clean.  Sherlock crossed to the bed and considered the old, lumpy mattress.  Envisioned John, curled and compact, in the dent at the center of the bed, turned on his side to face the door.  John would never let himself be caught unawares.
John thought of what Molly had said – that Sherlock was mid-way through withdrawal.  His resolve wavered.  Was he really cruel enough to do this when Sherlock was already in so much pain?
With a bit of fumbling, he disentangled himself from Sherlock and slid off the sofa, darting into the kitchen before Sherlock could voice his protest.  He returned moments later with a medical kit in one hand and a rubbish bin in the other. Bidding Sherlock sit up, he knelt beside the sofa.
“As long as he’s not making off with any body parts, he’s all right,” said Lestrade.  He walked through the doorway and stopped, hands on his hips.  He glanced between Sherlock and Harry with a wincing smile. “Well, might as well introduce you. Sherlock, this is—”
Standing in the center of the room, John turns from his study of the mirror and offers a tentative smile.  Clad in dark trousers and a button-up in royal blue with his hair swept into an artful curve, he cuts a sleek figure.  All he’s missing is his shoes; there’s something oddly intimate about seeing his sock-clad feet, toes curling against the carpet.  Sherlock drags his focus back to John’s face.  Tries to ignore the smooth, jewel-tone sheen of the shirt.
“Thank you.”
“…Sherlock,” said Harry, looking delighted, “you’re much more handsome in real life.  Not my type, ‘course, but I can see why Johnny likes you.”
“Sherlock.”  John draws back, tipping up Sherlock’s chin so they’re looking each other in the eye.  “I know you better than anybody, remember?  And I don’t believe that you were never sad for a victim before.  I think you were better at burying your feelings.  Hiding them from yourself.”
“Who?” Sherlock called.
John shook his head.  “No.” His thumb wandered, brushing the hinge of his jaw and smearing a clot of dried blood.  Sherlock stared at the ruddy smear as if spellbound.  “No, I wasn’t.  But I.  I was taken there, for a time.”
and told himself they no longer existed.
“Sherlock.”  John drops his hands from his face and scowls.  Sherlock stares back, unrepentant.
“Anything?” John asks, glancing at Sherlock and then out the window.  The warm, cozy light of the kitchen halos him in an orange glow, limns his silvery hair with honeyed gold.  Sherlock shoves his hands into his pockets, feels the evidence bag crinkle against his fingertips.
A couple of Easter eggs:
Sherlock is treating a plate of mouse epithelial cells with cetuximab when John bustles through the door of 221B, preceding his greeting with a guttural cough.  Lowering the pipette, Sherlock studies John and pronounces, “You’re ill.”
Sherlock warns, “I won’t lay a finger on you.”
“Really?  I feel fine.”
and Sherlock is far from okay.  Sherlock is alive, but even that seems a tenuous arrangement.
“She hates me
His hesitation was a near-fatal mistake.  Still howling in pain, Moriarty raised his hand and bellowed a curse.  A blast knocked Sherlock off his feet and an invisible weight bore down upon him, flattening him to the floor.  He choked as the air rushed out of his lungs.  His ribs creaked, sparking bright starbursts of agony.  Moriarty was going to crush him.
“You think it’s Woodley,” says Sherlock.
“John?” he asked.
“Yeah.”  John scrubbed his face.  A pointless effort – he had been sorely mistaken to think he had cried himself out earlier in the day.  “H-his daughter was Rosie’s half-sister.  Effie.  She can’t be replaced, of course, but…”
John rounded on him, his accusing glare half-masked by a sarcastic smile.  “That’s good.  That’s a good deduction, yeah.”
“Never.”  A pang of worry; his answer was meant to be cheeky, not an oath.
“Watson,” he says by way of greeting.  He crosses the room and slumps into his armchair with a sigh.
Mrs. Hudson hesitated, darting a wary look at Sherlock.  He nodded once.  He didn’t trust himself to speak without shouting.  Mrs. Hudson dithered until John offered to escort her out.
said Mycroft.
The bedroom door snicks shut behind them.  John loosens his tie, tugs it off.  “Going to wash up.  You coming?”
Sherlock dips his head to press his lips to John’s, tasting himself and the sour tang of sleep.  He nudges his big feet and knobby knees against John’s until they lie with legs intertwined.  “I may be amenable.”
The following hours are a time course of a different kind.  At hour one, John is banging about the flat, determined to demonstrate his robust health by tapping away at his laptop, offering to cook an elaborate dinner, and inviting Sherlock on a walk around Regent’s Park.
His thoughts drift, too – a dense, amorphous fog that wearies the mind and threatens to congeal into a dark mood.  He can feel it seeping at the corners of his subconscious, ready to submerge him in its black, oily depths.  The conclusion of the Father Christmas Killer case was less satisfying than he had hoped.  The usual high of solving a case is absent, and despondency is creeping forth to fill the hollow.
Mary knows this.  And she knows what John will choose.  She smiles and snuggles into the circle of his arms with a contented sigh.  John waits until she is fast asleep before he lets out a convulsive, choking sob.
John’s hand rose and covered Sherlock’s.  “I’d heard that objects can hold emotions.  Love, hate, grief.  It’s like a stain, or a scum of oil.  You can’t wash it off.”  His thumb brushed over Sherlock’s knuckles, absently.  “I believe it.  Whoever’d had that magnifying glass before had imbued it with so much
She raises her head and frowns at him.
“Gosh,” said Sherlock, “with an attitude like that, you’ll be a model ruler in no time.”
everything feels.  There is no monumental shift in his perspective, no sense of being out of place. It is simply him and John, walking to their bedroom as they have countless times before.  Even the weight of the ring on his finger seems to lessen.
Where had his best friend gone?  Where was he?  Had anyone noticed he was gone?
When at last he sinks into slumber, the dream rises fast in his mind, a riptide pulling him in.  Limbs twining, spines arching, mouths moving together, stealing soft murmurs and cries. A gasp as John grips, thumbs digging into the soft places beneath iliac crests, and thrusts up into tight heat.
John rolls over in his bed and punches his pillow with a muttered curse. It is Christmas Eve, and all he wants to do is go to sleep for about ten millennia and forget that this atrocity of a night ever happened.
“You’re new to the Met,” said Sherlock, suddenly determined to throw her off her guard.  “Moved to London after your divorce went through.  Second… no, third crime scene.  You’re keen on being head of forensics – bold for a new recruit, but not impossible for you. You’re clearly competent, even if you are an alcoholic.”
Mrs. Hudson folds her hands neatly in her lap and studies me.  “You’re her,” she says at length.  “Rosamund.  Rosie.”
“Spoiled ponce, you are,” John muttered.  “What, have you got some other pressing business to attend to?”
“I won’t tell if you don’t,” Sherlock says, and follows the key to choose a milk-chocolate caramel.
“Fine,” Sherlock snapped.  “Just bloody cold.”
“I’ve already—”
“Give me a lock of his hair instead,” said Moriarty.  “I’d like to keep it.  A token from my sweet Sherlock.”
“I do.”  John’s thumb rubs a circle over the jut of Sherlock’s kneecap.  “It’s… it’s possible that she could end up the same, yes.  But it isn’t certain.  Not yet.”
“Yeah?”
Lestrade says, and there’s a steel edge to his tone that gives Sherlock pause.  “We already checked the CCTV footage outside Honeycomb Primary School.  We verified it was Catherine who took Rosie.  On top of that, we have a relative of Catherine’s willing to testify to her… erratic behavior.”
John’s eyebrows rose.  “What, she gets the royal treatment?”
Inside the flat, Sherlock slumps across the room and sinks into his armchair with a sigh.  John hovers, uncertain.  He should leave Sherlock in peace.  He should go back to Mary.
Alexander shook his head.  “That,” he said, “is where you are mistaken, Mr. Holmes.  My daughter – Effie, we called her – is dead.  Has been for the last five years.”
Mycroft’s eyes slitted open and regarded John with an impassive look.  Even dying, he was infuriatingly calm.  “I’m sorry… I couldn’t protect… your daughter.”
Since John, though – since John, Sherlock’s standards have been revised.  Drastically.  They’ve had practically every kind of sex imaginable:  tender and romantic, frantic and needing,
“Mr. Holmes!” she cries at his retreating form.  He keeps walking, but much to his chagrin, he hears her voice grow nearer.  “Mr. Holmes, wait!”
“You’re beautiful,” he blurts out.  Bites his lip.
John dropped his pen and clambered through his desk drawer for his keys.  “Where are you?”
“Be my guest,” said Sherlock.  “I’m sure you’ll ferret out whatever she’s hiding.  You’re
“He builds walls to protect himself,” Mrs. Hudson said.  “And you’ve gone and climbed right over, haven’t you?  So.”  Briskly, she wiped her hands down the front of her apron, as if washing her hands of him.  “If I go up there later and find Sherlock under some black cloud of depression, well.  I’ll know who to blame, won’t I?”
“Dr. Watson,” he said.  “How did this…”  He trailed off, at a loss for words.
With that pronouncement – stripped of anger, but with the complete conviction of a God casting down an unworthy supplicant – John left the room.
“Right.”  John’s shoulders sag.  He is facing away from Sherlock, but somehow he seems very far away – an island, remote and forbidding.  Sherlock almost thinks he prefers John pacing.  This is too… too quiet, too uncertain.  As if John is weighing his options on a knife edge.
The nurse flushed prettily and smiled.  “Just don’t tell, all right?”
John turned toward his armchair, pressing his palm against the rectangle of his mobile phone in his pocket.  Nerves crawled beneath his skin.
“Stop spoiling our fun,” said Eirene, her tone frosty.
“John, really, it’s no trouble,” said Molly.  Her voice was bright over the line, but John was a new parent.  He had a good ear for notes of exhaustion.
As John limped around the flat, Sherlock made a pretense of moving his rubbish about while he took in the army doctor’s appearance.  He didn’t
“All—all right,” Alexander said, clearly wrong-footed.  “The email address on the blog?”
“—it’s just how you’re made.”
“Maybe she should lock him out,” John muttered.
“Piss off, Mycroft,” Sherlock said, reaching for the door.
Morley – a pretty brunette who had the misfortune to flirt with John – shrinks back, face scarlet.
His words are lost in a moan as John drops to his knees and unbuttons Sherlock’s trousers with dexterous fingers.  Gripping one of the shelves behind him, Sherlock shoves his free hand against his mouth, smothering a whimper as John pushes down his trousers and pants.  The first brush of fingers against his cock sets his nerves aflame.
Peeling off his gloves, Sherlock reached for the low branches of the tree. He plucked each berry with infinite care, wary of bruising the tender, red flesh.  When he was done collecting, he turned to leave the grove, only to stop as his eyes fell to the leaf litter beneath his feet.  The red pulp of fallen berries gleamed like rubies.  Like droplets of blood.
A weight settles over Sherlock’s shoulders, startling him from his reverie.  He knows the heft and drape of the Belstaff without having to look, just as he knows who would bother to see that he’s kept warm.  It isn’t a long list.
As with the candy cane murder, the cause of death is apparent at a glance. The victim – middle-aged woman, burly with a short, matted cap of hair and a position as assistant manager at a pet shop – wasn’t murdered here, in a market with Tower Bridge and the Tower of London looming overhead, glittering against the night sky.  She was killed elsewhere and placed in the stand like a doll at a child’s tea party table.
“Shut up.”  But there is a smile in his voice as he steps closer.  “Close your eyes, love.”
The twist in Sherlock’s belly loosens.  “John.”
He gathers the tray, turns – and collides with Sherlock, standing soundless and still behind him.  John flinches, jostling the tray, and one of the teacups wobbles.
“Goodbye, Sherlock Holmes,” said Maili.  “For now.”
For a moment, Sherlock says nothing.  Then there is the sound of a ragged, shivering breath, and Sherlock says, “Good night, John.”
“Sherlock,” said John.  “How did they know we were coming here?”
Sherlock was dashing for the door before he remembered John.  “John!” he shouted toward the kitchen. “Su Lin’s tea!”
And without awaiting a reply, he turned and disappeared into the BMW.  The car pulled away from the curb and glided into traffic.  Sherlock and John watched as the sleek, dark form shrank into the distance, then turned a corner and was lost from sight.
“Tedious.”  A second voice – deeper, rumbling around the three syllables.  “Nothing but a few cheating spouses and a pickpocket.”
“It’s partially an apology because I cocked up and forgot and it’s partially a prelude, if you must know.”
The breath freezes in John’s lungs.  He schools his expression to neutrality as his mind flies ahead, conjuring echoes from the dream that has plagued him since Christmas Eve.  That mortifying,
either.  For weeks at a time, he would be the man he showed the rest of the world – the good one.  Then, just when we started to hope he’d changed, he would revert back to his old self.  His
“Your sister was a party to the abuse,” Sherlock realizes, leaning forward and steepling his hands under his chin, elbows on knees.  “That’s why you were estranged.”
The doctor chewed on his lip and tapped his feet against the floor.  “Right, yes.  Well, then, I’m sure you’re aware that it will take a long time for you to return to full physical function.”
John watches her watching him.  Fear clots in his throat.
“You’re certain?” John asked.
“Sorry,” said John, wiping welling tears from his eyes.  “It’s only-- well.  It's nothing.”
“I understand.  I’m sorry.”
Sherlock widens his eyes in feigned shock.  “Oh!  Well. There’s the egg on my face.  I just thought you were listing my many charms.”
Greg sighs, “before you cause a riot.”
And then:  a sixth bang, but this sound was full of rumbling and roiling, thunderclouds scudding across an open plain.  It ripped through the flat, ripped through Sherlock’s ears on a blast of heat that hurled him to the ground.  Smoke billowed and dust clogged his mouth, his throat, as he gasped and cried out. He lay face-down on the floor. Gagging on grit, blind with tears, he reached out and planted one hand against the floor.  Pain lanced through his palm.  Echoes of the slashes left by Su Lin’s shattered pots.
But never afraid.  Never vulnerable.
John emerges from the kitchen with his medical kit and an ice pack in hand.  “Right.  Let me take a look at your head.”
His words were lost as the trill of a police car siren sliced through the air.  The scant flush that had returned to John’s features vanished.  As soon as the cab halted, John was out the door and running toward a cluster of flashing lights surrounded by crime scene tape.
DI Ferguson greets Sherlock with a hearty clap on the shoulder, startling him. The tree-bark crags of his face pinch in confusion when he sees Sherlock is alone.  “Where’s your better half, then?”
Sherlock blinks at him.  He wants to ask
The door swings open and John walks in, a Styrofoam cup in one hand and a book in the other.  The wrinkles beneath his eyes have deepened into grooves shadowed by a sleepless night. Sherlock thinks of his own cutting words, of the pain on John’s face.
Amidst the flurry of tittering laughter, one voice was sharp with reproach.  “The Queen prefers golden-haired children.”
“It’s my greatest skill,” she chuckled.
Given Mofftiss' treatment of John in S4, I know some people will take serious offense at how John acted in this chapter, but I implore you to stick with me if you are able.  I tried to resolve this in a way that, while problematic, is believable and keeps with the major theme of this fan fiction.
Sherlock repeated, dragging out each syllable with care.  “Not ‘mongrels.’”
“Not at all,” said Mycroft, surprising him.  “I want you to keep an eye out for this man, nothing more.  He’s highly skilled, and therefore highly dangerous.  If you get so much as a whiff of him in London, I want you to tell me immediately.”
His fingers wrapped around the refrigerator handle, knuckles white.
“Rowan berries.”  Sherlock feathered one fingertip across the dried husks.  Seven berries, perfectly ripe when picked, scored through with a length of twine.  Their skins were withered and wrinkled now, but he could feel the charm humming through the twine like a vibration on a plucked harpstring.
“Okay,” I say, and reclaim my seat in the armchair.  Sherlock leads John to the sofa and they both sit.  I look around for Mrs. Hudson and realize that she’s vanished – must have slipped out during the initial shock of our meeting.  Before me, Sherlock leans forward, propping his elbows on his knees and steepling his fingers under his chin.
The flat in Putney was small but immaculate.  With the floors scrubbed to a fine sheen, the carpets hoovered, and the windows sparkling, every aspect of the flat reflected on its expert homemaker. As they walked through the kitchen, Sherlock swiped a forefinger over the windowsill over the sink.  The pad of his finger came away clean.
Donovan raises her eyebrows, leveling a smug side-eye at Sherlock.  “We were all thinking it.”
Sherlock pouted.  “I don’t want
John blinked.  “That—”
Sherlock forced himself to look at John.  The mazikeen’s face was open with curiosity and devoid of the disgust he had expected.  Averting his eyes, Sherlock said, “Anyone can see Fae.”
He looks away, cheeks pink, but Sherlock’s brain rushes ahead, unfettered, plucking deductions from the grooves on John’s brow, the bags under his eyes.  The clean, silvery sweep of his hair—
Sherlock draws a shuddering breath.  Tries to find the words, to give shape to the terror clawing at his insides.  “I—I want it to be good.  For you.”
As if summoned by John’s ill omen, bile rushes up Sherlock’s throat and his entire body clamps down on a twist of sudden, spiking nausea.  It is only by some stroke of luck that they reach the loo in time for him to retch into the toilet, John’s hand rubbing a slow circle between his shoulder blades as he shakes and shakes.
Too late, Sherlock tunes into the song: something about carrying love.  “What?”
Maybe… maybe John would have never been disgusted.  It certainly wouldn’t be the first time he caught Sherlock off his guard.
Harry nodded and began to speak, but Anderson cut her off.  “What about other kinds of Fae?  Spriggan?  Goblin?”
“Sherlock,” John says suddenly, his voice frantic.  “Sherlock, please, you have to be careful.”
John subsided instantly and looked away, the tips of his ears turning pink.  The facts clicked into place:
Lucy shook her head with wide-eyed incredulity.  “I know how it sounds.  But these people sent my father death threats when he left the cult.  Part of the reason he moved to England was to get away from them.”
“I…”  Sherlock can think of nothing to say.  He is reeling from the unexpected sting of Rosie’s words, carried like a slap.
Sherlock blinks to clear his sleep-muddled vision.  The room is awash with a pale grey glow that chases shadows into corners.  John is a warm, solid weight at his back, one arm slung loosely over his side, fingertips brushing the bedclothes.  Sherlock reaches down to slot his fingers through the spaces between John’s.  A muffled sigh brushes the nape of his neck.
Sherlock had just got back to Baker Street and out of his tiresome clothes when Mycroft’s goons came by to collect him.  This time, he opted for the bedsheet.
“Of course,” said Mycroft.
It’s that gesture – the
Sherlock, much less…”  He trails off, waving his hand at the air between them.
And then:  John’s hand at his shoulder, the touch so light Sherlock might have mistaken it for the brush of the Belstaff.  His hand lingers, presses, and Sherlock can feel the imprint of his palm mold against the bump of his clavicle, perilously close to the nape of his neck.  Sherlock’s nerves spark like a wire stripped to the core.  He feels John’s fingers pressing through wool, through his silk shirt, down to hot skin.
They sit in silence for a few heartbeats, taking in the quiet of the flat, the hush of still waters after an ocean storm.  Sherlock shifts in wordless demand and John raises his arm.  He feels Sherlock move to lie down on his side, his cheek pillowed on John’s thigh.  John settles a hand into the coarse thicket of his hair, fingers gently weaving through curls.  It’s nice, this.  Really nice.
Rosie is too tired even to wince when John helps her out of her coat and jumper, peeling the sleeve away from her injured arm with extreme care.  The cut on her arm is deeper than that on her face, but after studying it, John promises she won’t need stitches.  He cleans and dresses the wound, then guides Rosie to the loo to help her wash off.
,” Sherlock said curtly.  The needle slid home and he depressed the plunger.  “Don’t worry.  Just needed to relax.  Controlled usage, John.   Not addiction.”
“Shut up,” Sherlock grumbled.  Pushing down memories of warm lips and ragged breaths, he added, “Sit.  You must be absolutely exhausted, walking up the stairs and… standing around like that.  And look!”  He swept a hand toward the heaping tea tray.  “I’ve prepared light refreshments.”
“Rosie?” John murmurs.
make you regret it.”
“Yeah.”
With a stifled sob, Lucy turned on her heel and bolted from the kitchen.  As the sound of her footsteps retreated into the sitting room, John looked at Sherlock.  “You shouldn’t have said that.”
Winter pursed his lips.  “It’d be more fun if I could chase him.  As it is, I’m not into queers.”
“Oh?” John mumbled, drowsy.  As if Sherlock’s words were a soothing bedtime story.
a mutinous part of his mind insists.  Sherlock silences the thought as easily as he might pluck lint off his trouser leg.  He’s had a long time to become adept at it – coming up on a decade, actually.  It’s a bit pathetic, but he’s resigned himself to it.  He’s luckier than he has any right to be, with John and Rosie living at 221B when they could have very well stayed in the house in Chiswick.  John would have been completely justified in cutting Sherlock out of his life on more than one occasion, but for some reason—well.
John is staring at him, eyes dark, lips parted.  Their gazes lock and John transforms the sound into a ragged cough, covering his mouth with his closed fist.  “Sorry, sorry.  I’ll just…”
of the mallet man.  Sherlock cracks his eyes open and grimaces as sunlight spears his retinas.  Groaning, he turns on his side, reaching—and finding his target gone.  Bracing himself, he opens his eyes.  The other side of the bed is empty.
She continues to natter as Sherlock and John mount the last stair and holds open the door as they shuffle inside.  Wordlessly, John leads Sherlock to the sofa and deposits him onto the cushions with care.  He watches Sherlock for a moment, lips pursed, eyes hard.  Then he turns and stalks down the corridor toward Sherlock’s bedroom without a word.
Now, tramping down the pavement beside the boating lake, Sherlock’s rational mind finally catches up with him.  Perhaps he was too hasty.  Perhaps John has every intention of ending it with Elise – a clean break, a new start.  An empty slate for them to write their own story.
Sherlock’s cry tore John’s focus away from the man.  The consulting detective was bounding toward him, mouth stretched into a wide grin.  But for his expression, he looked horrible – face pale and sheened with sweat, the grit of stubble smeared along his jawline.  His coat billowed, allowing a glimpse of the rail-thin frame underneath.
“All right?” asks John.  “You’ve gone tense.”
“Right,” Sherlock says.  He pushes back his chair and stands.  A drunk Molly, he decides, is both formidable and horrifying to behold.  “I’ll go check on John and Gilligan, shall I?”
Sherlock cannot move – cannot make a sound.  He can only stare, frozen by a terror greater than anything he has ever known. His perception narrows to the space between the knife and John’s pale, vulnerable throat.
Running – stumbling – toward a crumpled form on the pavement, knowing he was too late.
“Are you hiding from him?”
he thought, staring at the tender tableau before him:  mother and daughter, both healthy and whole.
“So callous!” exclaimed the puppet.  “Honestly, it’s no use to anybody. Defective, remember?”  It tapped the newsboy cap, indicating the aneurysm in its cradle of swollen blood vessels.  “Any second now could be
“I could extract it myself.  I’m quite handy with pliers.”  Sherlock left it unsaid that, if Harry’s teeth had the long redcap roots he anticipated, they would be a trial to pull.  No matter.  John probably wouldn’t mind if Harry had a sore jaw.
far gone on him.”
friend to put up with you, now wouldn’t it?  I must commend you, Dr. Watson, on your patience.  Positively inhuman.”
the creases in John’s brow say.
Rage flared, as automatic as breathing, strained like a long-neglected muscle.  Mary waited until it had passed before setting her thumbs to the screen.
“Mary?”
The café comes into view first.  Shrouded by fog, its awning is the color of faded rust.  “Speedy’s Sandwich Bar & Café,” it announces in dull, ditchwater print.  A row of colorful soda cans stands on the windowsill.  Beyond, people are hunched over breakfast in their booths.  I haven’t eaten yet, but anxiety sits in my stomach like a stone.  Haven’t got an appetite.
They had a few minutes still to wait for the bus.  Sherlock found his attention drifting to their surroundings – the cozy houses, the tidy lanes, the sprays of ivy climbing walls and shrubs peeping through garden fences, lush and budding with spring.  There was something pleasing about the scene, but it didn’t feel quite right – like slipping into a fine coat, only to realize the shoulders were too tight.
“Give Sarah my love,” Sherlock retorted, determined to have the last word.
Twiddling the pencil, Sherlock considers the empty Wish List.  “Well, what do you want for Christmas, Watson?”
“Are you in a lot of pain?” asked John.
From the corner of his eye, Sherlock sees Rosie’s shoulders hunch as she curls into herself.  Anger prickles across the back of his neck.  “I don’t see why this is necessary.  Forgive me if I sound
John’s eyes widen.  “Sherlock, are you okay?”
it… the very idea sends a shiver down Sherlock’s spine.  He wants it, of course he wants it.  He is plagued by it.  But John was married once before, and it ended in a noxious conflagration of bitter regret.  John loves Sherlock, but he may not want to marry him.  Sherlock must tread lightly.  If he is to determine the answer to this particular puzzle, he must remove himself from all emotion.  Better to rely on something impartial, quantifiable.
Sherlock is still digesting that statement, light-headed, when John pulls him to the next door down.  This one, unadorned, yields under John’s hand and he hurries Sherlock inside.  Sherlock glimpses shelves, spray bottles, a mop – and John’s words come back to him, shooting a bolt of lust down his spine to smolder in his belly.  If someone had told him a quarter of an hour ago that he would be sexually aroused at the sight of a broom cupboard, he would have laughed in their face.
“No,” said Sherlock.  “It doesn’t. Not at all.”
As John, Sherlock, and Rosie walk down the street, Rosie chatters on and on about the wonders of Sammy’s flat.  “They haven’t got a skull or a microscope, but they
Sherlock was rather taken with Harry.
“The trust fund,” Alexander continued, “was not to be used until the company – Goldenrod Research Hospital, that’s what it’s called – started on with its first patients.  Most of the ground level work was being funded by substantial grants, and I wanted Effie’s contribution to help the kids first.”
“You don’t know that,” John snapped.  “’Mistake to theorize without all the data,’ wasn’t that it?  Besides, it’s obvious that Lucy loved him.”
Above Sherlock, Zhi Zhu stiffened with a gasp.  His hands slackened on the silk scarf and he pitched forward, the bolt from the crossbow protruding from his back.  Sherlock wheezed, each breath a scrape in his throat. With shaking hands, he shoved the Spider’s inert body off of him.  The fairy toppled to the ground. Dead.
“Sorry, mate,” Lestrade says.  “That one’s taken.”
John emerged from the kitchen, a new bottle in hand.  “That certainly sounds… final.”
Mr. Holmes trains his intense focus on me.  “May I deduce you, Ms…. Grant?”
John bellows.
“Powerful, isn’t she.”
“What,” John began, but his voice trailed off.  Sherlock pulled the plastic object out and held it up to the light.  His eyes hardened into shards of ice.
(Greg, no doubt hastily procured at the Pasty Shop and WHSmith at Paddington Station).  Thanking them, John set the flowers and pasty aside, making a mental note to bin the latter the moment they left.  He thumbed through the book while they took seats beside the bed.
John, who had leaned forward to inspect the stone, dropped his gaze to Rosie.  The baby had awakened silently and was reaching for the stone.  Her little arm flexed, palm outstretched, before she winced and took it back.
“Sirs!”  The PA shrieked from the doorway.  For all he was a small man, he was quick on his feet; he must have rushed to the security cameras, seen what was happening, and rushed back in less than a minute.  “You cannot—you can’t
Sherlock stands so quickly his chair clatters to the floor.  John makes the mistake of trying to stand, too, but his feet tangle beneath him and he topples sideways, face gray.  Sherlock races to his side as he fumbles his mobile phone from his pocket and dials 999.  “John.  John!”
Sherlock felt the force of the fairy’s words wrap around his mind, softening wariness into muddled complacency.  Tension bled out of him, loosening his shoulders and sparking a restless energy in his feet.  He could dance—he would do anything for her—he would dance until she bade him stop, dance until his feet bled, until the cracked soles of his wellies fell apart.
“Caught on quick, didn’t you?” John smirked.
“We can help you,” said John.  “Keep you safe.”
She returns to her game as Sherlock stares, disconcerted.  She is simultaneously too clever for her age and completely oblivious to that fact.  She mimes Sullivan gobbling up the hapless doll while the others retreat behind the walls with tinny screams.
Sherlock’s heart kicks into a gallop as he watches their exchange.  For God’s sake, he really is in trouble.  He almost misses the old days, when even the tawdriest insinuations about himself and John would not have merited a blink.  Far better than getting breathless at an innocent remark.
Mary’s thoughts turned to Sherlock Holmes and John Watson.  One of those men trusted her, and it wasn’t the one who had shared her bed for the past two months. “Shared” was a generous term for the sparse, stilted words John traded with her day after day.  It was a generous term for the tension that filled any room they happened to occupy – and not the good kind, either.
John raised an eyebrow.  “The Mazarin stone?”
John halts, looks at Sherlock.  The light from outside renders his pale skin icy and blue.  Sherlock’s hands itch to touch, to caress, to seek beyond that cool façade.
Winter forced a tight smile.  “Selling me out to Mycroft Holmes wouldn’t do you any good.  You need me.”
“Damn,” Sherlock hisses.  He sets the pipette to the glass bottle and ejects the rest of the acid.  Screws on the cap with shaking fingers.
“Not too many, mind,” says John.  “You don’t want to make yourself ill.”
“Yes, I see that now,” John chuckles.  “That woman will be the death of us.”
“Brilliant.”  John swipes a thumb over one of his cheekbones.  “See you later, sweetheart.”
“Uneventful,” the first man amends with a chuckle.
John chuckles weakly against his neck.  “Yeah?  And when d’you think that will be?”
“Yes,” they say in unison.  They share a glance, smother mirrored smiles.
“Mrs. Hudson brings up food.  Sometimes.”
But, as always, John has an uncanny knack for slipping through Sherlock’s defenses.  John says Sherlock will always amaze him, but Sherlock thinks he’s got it the wrong way ‘round.
Sherlock hums and stands on shaking legs.  Still averting his gaze, he drops the fleece blankets to the floor and sets to work on his shirt buttons.  A choked sound reaches his ears and he looks up: a kneejerk reaction.
“The wound—”
“John is my husband,” says Sherlock.  His voice is too quiet, too timid.  Such a thing should be declared with pride, but suddenly Sherlock feels very small.  Pathetic.
“I owe Wilkinson a debt of gratitude,” says Sherlock.
is the new parish priest, arrived to the post after the sudden death of his predecessor.  Sherlock steers John down the aisle, impervious to the darkness, and ushers him into a stifling, dusty room.
“That’s him?  William Wiggins?” Lestrade said.  In an undertone, he added, “Your old dealer?”
John pops the chocolate into his mouth and shakes his head with a grin. He gestures to the candles, the tinted water with a helpless sort of chuckle.  “This is ridiculously decadent, you know.”
“You’re going to be okay.”  John’s voice seems very far away.  “Sherlock, love…”
, and Donovan’s ready to take a swing at him.”
John tore into his peripheral vision, racing toward Moriarty in a dark blur. The knife – still wet with Sherlock’s blood – came down in a vicious arc, slicing through the meat of Moriarty’s hand.  The fairy screamed as his palm opened, blood spurting.  The severed ends of his index and middle fingers fell to the floor in a spatter of crimson.
He offers a forced smile.  Guilt rakes its claws over Sherlock’s heart.  “I… I’m so sorry, John.”
John.  Where was John?
“What did you steal?” he asked.  Su Lin’s eyes fluttered, closed. “Su Lin!  What did you steal?”
“Look at her,” Mary said.  “Rosamund Mary Watson.  Rosie.”
“Uh, yeah.”  I don’t know how I feel about being called
John bites his lip to ward off a grin.  “This is.  Um.  On your back, yeah?”
“You had to be resuscitated.  Sherlock was a mess about it – always underfoot and barking at doctors and nurses like a madman.  If he hadn’t been for his leg, he would probably have been escorted from the premises.”
John sat back abruptly and reached for his jacket, digging into its pocket for his mobile.  “I’ll call 999.  See if we can get you to hospital.”
His thumb brushed the bracelet of raw skin on John’s wrist, and John sucked in a sharp breath.  His eyes – pupils wide and dark, ringed by ocean blue – met Sherlock’s.
!” Billy Wiggins shrieked.  His free hand went to his face and he slid to his knees.  “You again!  You’re bloody insane, you are!”
The words – simple, unashamed – shook John to the marrow of his bones.  His heart thumped and his hands shook, not with nerves but with a terrible restraint.  He wanted to reach for Sherlock, to grasp and cling and hold.  It was only the echoing condemnation of his own words that held him back.
That’s wrong, that’s all wrong.  John is the brave one, the soldier.  John invaded Afghanistan.  He protects Sherlock from the foulest scum of London.  He watched Sherlock leap to his death and bore the sharp sting of Mary’s betrayal and he kept going.  Sherlock draws his strength from John.  Now, John’s fear creeps over him like oil on still water.
“I’m not…”  John trails off and hitches the smile back up, rueful and forced.  “I guess I…  I might be.  A little.”
Sherlock fumbled in his pockets.  The mobile phone slipped from his fingers and clattered on the floor.  A cursed hissed between his teeth as he bent to retrieve it.  Clumsily, he tapped on the screen, navigating to John’s number.  The phone rang twice and went to voicemail.  John was still on the Tube, unreachable in a labyrinth of concrete and steel.
“John—”
“It is rather justified when all my enemies end up on your doorstep, don’t you think?”
Christmas Eve.  He has woken more than once with Sherlock’s name on his lips and a need like a fever burning through him.
John scrubs a hand over his brow, mussing his unwashed hair.  “So, Carson steals Laurence’s girlfriend’s overnight bag, intending to plant the poisoned shampoo—”
“Quite well,” Sherlock says tightly.  “A fair sight better than you, at least.”
“They have the shop bugged,” he said, already whirling toward the stairwell.  “Alexander and Rosamund are—”
Sherlock shrugs.  “Haven’t the foggiest.  Perhaps he’s afraid of the long arm of the law.”
You’re angry.  –SH
Sherlock had always been keen-witted.
He turns on his heel and staggers out of the sitting room.  His feet thump against the stairs as he climbs up to his bedroom; the door creaks open, snaps shut.  Sherlock is alone.
“Just an errand,” Wiggins muttered.
Sherlock dips the end of his forefinger in the water, careful not to get his bandages wet.  The water is warm – not too hot, but to his chilled skin, everything feels a shade more scorching than usual.  He thinks of Father Christmas with his withered face, of photographs turning slowly in the air.
“I’m fine.”  With a force of will, Sherlock uncoils his spine, sitting up straight and relaxing his shoulders.  “Lestrade has a case.  Apparently, someone’s been murdered with a candy cane.”
Sherlock’s frown deepens.  He and John rarely talk about their dreams.  They have spent years tiptoeing around each other, pretending the whimpers and shouts in the wee hours are too soft to bleed through the walls, pretending the silken notes of the violin and the cups of Earl Grey and paracetamol tablets beside the microscope are coincidences, snags in the fabric of the universe.  Even now, after a year of sharing a bed, they are still hesitant to share this vulnerability with each other.  It’s easier, late at night, in the dark – whispered confessions and choked voices take on a dreamy hue, easy to dismiss in the light of day.  All the same, Sherlock can count the number of times they have confided in each other about nightmares on both hands.
“Ash,” Sherlock says, or tries to say.  The word emerges a croak.  His throat feels like it’s been rubbed raw with sandpaper.  “The ash.  I’ve…”  He can’t speak anymore – he tries to swallow spit, gags.  Feels the need to vomit again rising.  “I’ve solved it.”
Sherlock’s fingers stilled on the strings.  A question rose to the forefront of his mind:  was John aware of his redcap ancestry?  Was Harry?  Neither had any physical traits to reveal their status.  Without his second sight, Sherlock would never have guessed it.
Anderson caught on, far too late, and mumbled a vague non-excuse to cover his retreat.  Donovan was left standing in the alcove.  She darted a glance past Harry, as if contemplating flight.  Then she set her jaw and looked Harry in the eye.
John thumbed through his Recent Calls list and tapped on an unmarked contact.  Raised the phone to his ear.  Listened as the tone droned on, on, on.  A part of him was itching for an answer; another part hoped the phone would never be answered.
Sherlock steals inside and races down the stairs to the basement.  On the first sweep of the house, officers found kerosene canisters for the derelict heater.  Sherlock seizes a canister, sloshing it to make sure he has enough, and bolts upstairs.  His mind whirls, thoughts pinned to a specific corridor, to the wall at the end. A false wall.  He would stake his life on it.
Sherlock nestles close, pressing his face to the curve of John’s throat.  He can feel John’s heartbeat against his cheek, hear the susurrus
“Fine,” Sherlock says.  “Really, Lestrade, I should think you’ve all the evidence you need by just
Sherlock was just about to push the woman away or start shouting for John – or both – when a familiar voice floated through the doorway.  “Sherlock?  Who is that?”
They spill through the doorway and into the open air.  Firefighters swarm them, drag them away from the blaze.
a difference between admiration and a… a crush.”
Sherlock tries to look affronted, but to quell the smile tugging at his mouth is no small feat.  He settles for a shrug.  “You’re a doctor.  Feeding people up comes naturally to you.”
They slip into a hush, each looking at the other with wide-eyed expectancy.  At last, Sherlock says, “You first.”
John nodded wearily.  “Right.  Thanks.”
Sherlock has returned, full stop.  Sherlock isn’t his to pin down.  John has a (murderous, lying) wife and a (helpless, unborn) child.  He doesn’t have Sherlock.
“I can say filthier things,” Sherlock says, lowering his voice to a feline rumble.  John’s hands find his waist, snake around to the small of his back, the curve of his arse.  “I can say anything you like.”
At those words, Mrs. Hudson’s smile faded.  She sat in the chair beside John’s bed and took his hand.  “I should say, John.  You’re out of the woods for now, but it was a bit touch and go for a while.”
“No,” Sherlock conceded.  “It isn’t.”  A pause; John could practically hear the gears turning in Sherlock’s head.  Then, with a clean, removed snap of deduction, he breathed, “Alexander.”
“Right.”  John’s face tells Sherlock he doesn’t believe him.  He slips his fingers around Sherlock’s arm and leads him up the stairs.  Sherlock can only follow, mute with shock, certain that to speak will be to crush the fragile hope fluttering in his breast.  He doesn’t want John to stop touching him.
Sherlock, do you—do you wear them?  Tell me you wear them.”
Drawing back, he threads his fingers through John’s hair, tidying the artful sweep:  perfect.  “I’ll have my lock-picks on hand next time.  We can christen Garrett’s desk, if you like.”
John had survived.  Again.
Sherlock fell still as understanding settled slowly into place.
Sherlock followed John’s lead and looked away.
“Mrs. Hudson, I helped put your late husband in the electric chair.  You won’t have a hint of judgement from
John emerges from the corridor with two fleece blankets in hand.  “Budge up,” he says, and Sherlock obliges.  His stomach flutters as John wraps one blanket around him, then the other.  Not nausea from the concussion, but a sickness of another kind.
“Don’t harass my officers,” Greg says.
A hiss and a squeal of brakes announced the approach of the bus.  It rounded a narrow corner and rolled to a stop, sagging low to the ground as the doors swung open.  Sherlock climbed aboard with John in tow.
Second half of the double update.  I apologize that these two are pretty case-heavy, but the next few chapters are more action-packed.  :)
“And if you must know,” said Sherlock, tugging his coat down from its peg and toeing on a pair of slippers, “I’m being summoned by the Queen.”
Sherlock goes back to bed.
“Wait,” Rosie commands, and when the words
So helpless?
They did look quite suspect.  –SH
“I’m sorry,” he said, after a weighty pause.  “I only want us to be…”  Again, his throat closed.  He couldn’t say it, couldn’t wish for them to be like they had been before.  That had been a lifetime ago.  He tried a different track.  “Rosamund is a lovely name.”
His back was rigid, his legs locked like a vise.
“Indeed.”
Rosie’s brow furrows.  “But it was wrong.”
“That was good of you,” he says.  The words are at odds with his grim tone.  “Really.”
John tensed.  Mary’s hands stilled.  She pulled back with a frown.
Winter shrugged.  “Technology.  Incredible stuff, really.”
“So.”
“Right.”  John heaves himself to his feet.  “S’pose I should.  Bed.” He rubs a crick out of his neck. “’Night.”
”  Damn it.  It’s practically instinctual.  “Go on.”
The unanswered question:  Is John in love with Sherlock?
“Humor me,” said Sherlock.  “I promise I’ll come to the point soon.”
Sherlock and John arrived at Ryder Street to find Garrideb’s Antiques closed, door bolted and windows shuttered.  Without bothering to knock, Sherlock fished a set of picks from his pocket to work on the lock.  John watched, mesmerized, as Sherlock’s fingers flexed and twisted with nimble certainty.  He was snapped from his study only when the lock clicked as the bolt slid free.  The door creaked open and Sherlock stood.
The car stops at the stoop of 221 and they disembark.  Sleet pelts down as the tail-lights round a corner and vanish. Sherlock shivers.  John, fiddling with the lock, curses under his breath. The bolt slides free and they step inside.
A faint chime.  John lifted his head, frowning, and the chime sounded again.  Pushing his chair back, John padded through the kitchen and stopped at the base of the stairwell.  He peered into the gloom, waited – and a third chime tumbled down the stairs.
John lowers a hand to cover Sherlock’s.  Tearing his gaze away from the sight of their joined hands, he looks up. Sherlock’s expression is all intense focus and rising passion, a combination like flint to the kindling within John.
As always, if you spot a mistake, please let me know so I can correct it. :)
“Did you have something to tell me?” John prompted.
Sherlock began walking toward the door, but John rushed into his path.  Halting, Sherlock scowled.  “What?”
“And somehow, I don’t believe the Bruce-Partington plans are gone.”
Sherlock pries his fingers from John’s hip and reaches down between his legs. John makes a sound someplace between a whimper and a moan.  Sherlock takes his time, winding him tighter, tighter.  John’s body is as taut as a bowstring when he comes at last, eyes screwed shut and brow sheened with sweat.
“Pepper says she would be able to meet with us for dinner,” John added, somewhere between tangents.  “If we have some time while working on the case…”
John stared at him like he had grown a second head.  Chewing on his lip, Sherlock clarified, “Alcohol.”
“Um.  Maybe a bit.” John clears his throat and shifts closer on his knees, eyes downcast, the bay leaf spinning a chaotic pirouette. His fingers shake as they settle on the bedclothes.  “This is. This is a lot.”
Mary shrugged helplessly.  “We’re still understaffed.  Indrah just went on maternity leave, too.”
but his words have gone away.  John peels off his jacket and drapes it over the back of a chair.  The mattress dips as he climbs into bed and curls against Sherlock’s side.  One of his hands quests across Sherlock’s chest, fingers starfishing at the spot above the bullet scar.
Seconds bled into minutes as John studied the article on melanoma, but he failed to take in a word beyond the abstract.
Craig shrugged.  “I can give it a go.”
“Gosh.  And here I was going to ask if I could sleep in your room from now on.  But if my sordid past really bothers you, I’ll stay in mine.”  John swallows his words.  The offer had sounded much more flippant in his head.  “Um.  That is, if you want me to.”
“John?”  A bell-like voice rings through the din; Sherlock turns, sees Elise standing amidst the throng.  Her eyes shine with recognition and she strides forward.  “Didn’t think I’d see you here.  Shopping for a tree, are you?”
“Cake.”
“Fine,” said Sherlock.  A forest filled with eldritch terrors.  A pale hand clasped around his wrist, dragging him through the foliage.
Finally, sensing John’s growing impatience, Sherlock concedes that there’s nothing else he can do.  At John’s request, Lestrade grants them the use of a patrol car to get back to Baker Street.
Sherlock’s face convulsed and he cried, “No!”
“Sherlock?”  Lestrade’s voice is wary.  “Are you…”
Sherlock is still shaking when they leave hospital.
“No,” Sherlock said.  “No, I have to go now.  Imperative to the case.”  It wasn’t, but he couldn’t bear waiting for John to make a Sherlock-sized space in his schedule.  “I’ll be perfectly fine on my own.”
– and scratches the side of his neck, just above his shirt collar.  A red mark peeks over the crisp, white edge, flowering into what Sherlock hopes will bloom a violent rose and wither damson.  Something flurries in his belly, as delicate and lovely as dragonfly wings.  He feels his glower fade into a small smile.
John sighs and rolls his eyes in feigned exasperation.  His gloved fingers squeeze Sherlock’s and they fall into step side-by-side.
– as they tittered and smirked.  With skin tones ranging from darkest night to milky white, others sporting pastel hues, all garbed in silken gowns of every conceivable color, they made a flamboyant pack.  The fairy with the moss green gown and fawnskin hair was the plainest among the bunch, but all had an ethereal beauty that set Sherlock’s nerves on edge.  All had pointed ears.
“I’m not—I’m fine.  I’ll be fine, I promise.  It’s only that…”
“Yes.”  Sherlock checks the urge to shift from foot to foot.  Shoves his gloved hands into the pockets of his Belstaff, telling himself it’s because of the cold.  “It’s only fair.  I’m a significant part of her life and…”
Rosie frowns.  “Did you fall down?”
Still Sherlock said nothing.
“Of course.”
“He could have
“He watches you sleep, you know,” Mary says.
“Alive,” John gasps, almost to himself.  Then, “Call an ambulance!
It should have been weird.  When had it stopped being weird?
“I’m high,” Sherlock sniffed, glowering at the pair, “not deaf.”
“It’s only my brother,” said Sherlock.  John turned his glare to the door, looking like a lion on the hunt, readying himself for the kill.  At last he nodded, but the deadly calm did not leave his demeanor as Sherlock went to the door.  He drew back the bolt and turned the knob.  “Mycroft.”
The squeal of brakes jerked John from his reverie as the cab slowed to a stop.  At Sherlock’s pointed look, he opened the door and climbed out.  Alexander emerged from the opposite side and limped to the sidewalk.  Sherlock joined him moments later and scanned their surroundings with a grin.
But John… John might want children.  He might want the chance to be a father.  The chance to have what had been stolen from him, a lifetime ago.
“Don’t be ridiculous,” Sherlock sneers.  Hurt flashes through Rosie’s eyes and he adds, “Yes, I do.  Obviously.”
“John,” he answers.
“’A new scarf.’  Now it’s your turn.”
He picks up the phone.  John’s name flashes across the screen.
says his thumb and the space between forefinger and middle finger.
Sherlock thinks acidly.
A hush fell around the circle; the giggles were muted as the Fairies exchanged nervous glances.  Maili clenched her fists in the silk of her gown and bit her lip.  “You should not say such things.”
With his heart slamming and face stinging with the cold, Sherlock races toward the alleyway.  Blackness swallows him as he runs inside, smoking out all traces of starlight.  For a single moment, he is utterly blind.
Sherlock’s face brightened.  “Oh, yes!  Of course!  Let’s be off!”
“Oxford Street.”
It was only then that Sherlock realized he was shaking—he was afraid—terror raked shivers down his spine, cutting off his voice as effectively as talons rending his throat.  He wrapped his arms around himself and shook.  He was all but blind and surrounded by people he didn’t know, and
“Of course,” said Greg.  “But I’ll admit that memory stick helped.  Got us the hard evidence when all I had was a hunch.”
“And now?”
“But—”
“What the fuck,” he mumbled, and turned on his heel to enter the flat.
“It’s Top Gear.”
John’s hands stilled.  His mind went blank.
But Sherlock’s got a look on his face that says he has a good idea of what Greg omitted – namely, a cross between fury and nausea.  His eyes flash to the other officers, a spark of spite tipping Greg off the instant before he opens his mouth.
Whatever the reason, Sherlock slides his finger under the flap of the envelope, tears it open.  Feels his heart stutter as the edge of a photograph is revealed.  With shaking hands, he fumbles the picture out of the envelope.  He feels as though his very blood has turned to ice.
bring me the P200.”
“Leave it,” Sherlock calls back.
“You’ve reached the voicemail of Sherlock Holmes, consulting detective.  The only one in the world.  I can’t come to the phone right now – either I’m on a case or I’m prematurely so bored of whatever little trifle you’ve come to bother me with that I’ve slipped into a coma.  Either way, not answering.  Leave a message if your case is better than a four.  If not, don’t bother.”
Sherlock stands at the window of their sitting room, violin perched under his chin, bow gliding over the strings as the thought burns feverish through his blood.  It has been a year since he and John began sharing their bed – a year since a case cut too close, since the band of tension between them stretched to the snapping point, since angry shouting collapsed into angry tears and angry tears dissolved into frantic  confessions. Sherlock would be lying to himself if he thought he had only been harboring the thought – the
“Catherine killed those people because of me,” Sherlock interjects.  “She took Watson because of me.  Tell me, John, if I wasn’t a part of your life, would she have been in danger?”
“All the same,” John chuckles, “it’s not on to leave children with their godparents without a little warning.”
“Yeah,” said John at last.  “Yes, of course.”
“Doesn’t matter.”
Catherine’s smile wavers, but she rallies and brings it back with full force.  “Just a chat, I suppose.  I was walking with Elise earlier, but she said she had to meet with John, so…”  She shrugs, eloquently.  “Here we are.”
Sherlock, arms shaking with the weight of his burdens, is gobsmacked.  He never expected to have so many friends in need of gifts.  He never expected to have so many
Rosie lifts her chin with a look of supreme condescension.  “Thank you.”
Sherlock and John departed the Vauxhall flat to investigate the first of four addresses.  As their taxi sped toward Marylebone, Sherlock stared out the window, anticipation thrumming through his veins as the city sped past.  He felt ready for anything - any puzzle, any nemesis.  They had triumphed over Negretto Sylvius and Ioane Sala.  With his brilliance and John’s courage, they were ready to tackle the case.
In the dead of winter, the White Cliffs of Dover are grand and imposing.  An iconic staple of holiday postcards, the cliffs now loom above the strait, their chalky faces crusted with bands of ice.  Footpaths ribbon along the slopes and skirt the cliffs’ edges.  In the distance, the shores of Calais are hidden beyond a thick mist that hunches over slate-gray waters.
“I know, love.  I know.” John climbs to his feet and pulls Sherlock into his arms.  Sherlock leans in his seat, rests his head against John’s chest.  The steady
Greg snorted.  “Should’ve seen Anderson’s face when he said ‘well done.’  I thought he was going to faint.”
“You ordered takeaway,” he said.
“Would you… stay for a minute?  I’d ask you to sleep up here, with us, but the bed is going to be crowded enough.”  He doesn’t even mention Rosie’s spare bed, which is suitable for a five-year-old but absurd for a grown man.
“I can fathom countless reasons.”
Sherlock stiffens, wipes a line of bile off his chin.  Looks up at John, eyes wide.  “You…”  He trials off, blinking.  “What did—”
Rosie furrows her brow, looking both affronted and confused, but ultimately decides it isn’t worth the effort.  “Do you know,” she says, slowly, “that Father Christmas isn’t real?”
“I do apologize, Craig,” Sherlock interrupted.  “Don’t mind him.  Please continue.”
is the haggard, wild look in John’s eyes when he is dragged from a nightmare of sand and blood, his mind straddling the border between dreams and reality.
girl.”
“You’ve been busy,” he murmured, lifting one page to study more closely.  The grainy street camera shot was of a sallow man in an ill-fitting coat.  He stood in what appeared to be a market of a city square – Budapest, Sherlock mused.  His neck was craned over his shoulder, as if he sensed the camera’s eye.  “Kołek Niedziela.  Which sort of toady is he?”
A queasy weight of secondhand sorrow sits heavy in Sherlock’s belly.  Sammy’s brother, he recalls, died in a traffic collision.  His eyes flick over Rosie’s head to meet John’s.  John nods in wordless confirmation.
John lowered his gun.  Heart racing, he stepped around the circle to squint at the letters curling across the paper.
it says,
“She might
Winter picked up the menu with an offhand manner.  “Speaking of keeping tabs on people, I followed the Sylvius case until the police were done with him.  Nothing to report.  It was all very neat and tidy.”
A signet ring rests in the bag, dull in the low light.  Sherlock squints to make out the crest – an ornate rendering of the letter
They contact Violet and agree to help her.  A trap is laid.  Violet will take her usual route to work.   Sherlock will follow at a discreet distance.  When the stalker joins Violet’s route, she will about-face and Sherlock, equipped with a rental bike, will cut off all escape routes.  A simple, effective plan.
“Oh, God, didn’t he…”
Mary looked at him over her shoulder.  Her cheeks were pink and she was smiling.  “Hi.”
When he wakes, he finds a dream in his arms.
“Yes, Mummy,” Sherlock says, aggrieved.
Sherlock finds Violet’s bike a few miles down Portsmouth Road.  It has been dragged off the road and propped behind a stand of trees.  The front fender is dented, the headlight smashed.  The seat is smeared with blood.
“Not really,” said John.  “You were quite creepy, if I recall.”
On the morning of the second day, Sherlock is ruminating on the case when John strides out of the bedroom, dressed in a dinner suit with his hair pushed into a sleek sweep.  “Sherlock? Are you almost ready?”
“I’ve given you a more than sufficient statement,” Sherlock says tartly. “And I’ve gift-wrapped two criminals for you.  Honestly, another statement is simply excessive at this point.”
For the next hour or so, Sherlock tramped around the flat, impotent rage fizzling in his veins.  Stupid,
Alexander shook his head.  “This was… different.  Effie was our baby.”  He drew a shuddering breath and continued in a rush.  “Rose had always struggled with a part of herself.  She didn’t think I could see it, but I could.  I saw that there was a darkness in her, a sort of… block, I guess.  She couldn’t feel the way normal people do.  She couldn’t understand it.”  He smiled sadly.  “I loved her anyway.  God help me, I loved her.  She was… incandescent.”

“You saw them,” Sherlock says, a little breathless.  “The…”
data – had years of John protesting every insinuation that they were a couple, years of John dating women and shagging women and
I begin a feeble protest, but Mrs. Hudson is already tottering toward the front door.  “Coming!”  The door creaks open, admitting a gasping clamor of the city and a pair of voices.
There’s a bang like a gunshot as the door between their rooms flies open, bounces off the wall.  There’s a distorted shout and John’s face is suddenly above his own, eyes wide and streaming.  John races past him, throws open the window, and races back.  Seizes Sherlock under the arms and drags him bodily from the room.
Now, things are different.  Now that Sherlock has become the target of John’s sweet nothings, he can condone all the other nonsense.  That includes the baths.
His legs immediately threaten to buckle.  Frantic, Sherlock reaches into the darkness at his right, praying for some support to cling to.  The heels of his hands strike a hard, metallic edge and he seizes it – a shelf, he thinks.  Leaning against it, he waits while his circulation pumps sluggish blood into his legs and prays the shelf won’t topple.
“You’re
“Well done, John.”  Sherlock strides toward him and takes his hand.  “We have limited experience sleeping in the same bed.  Best to repeat the conditions – multiple times, of course. We have to ensure their validity.”
Something in the inflection of those words – between the cadence of
At the National Antiquities Museum, a frazzled Andy explained Su Lin Yao’s prized teapots.  “If they dry out, then the clay can start to crumble. Apparently, you just have to keep making tea in them.”
“There were… photographs.  In the freezer.  Porter, Goodwin, and… others.”
A cold, stony weight of unease settled in John’s gut.   “Oh.”
Sherlock glances at John, who stares back, mouth open.  John deliberates for a beat, sighs, and nods. Sherlock continues.  “Though it’s none of your business, I know many of you have a vested interest in our sex lives because you have nothing better to do with your tedious existences.  Let me put an end to your suffering.  John and I,” he points, as if the officers are too dim to know who he means, “are in a committed romantic relationship.  It began last night, when John brought me to orgasm three times.”
That being said, Rosie is genuinely
He has less than a second to be self-conscious about his flushed face and dripping nose before John is bringing his face close to Sherlock’s, brushing their lips together.  The touch lingers, then retreats with a little gust of air, as if John has exercised considerable restraint to pull himself back.  They stare at each other for a long, charged moment.
The pen stills, nib buried in a snarl of black.  The band around Sherlock’s heart tightens further. Threatens to splinter him.  “You don’t know that.”
Perplexed, Sherlock follows his line of sight.  He looks down to his own shoulder, which is bare; the t-shirt he wears is old, the fabric threadbare, the neckline loose.  With his arm lowered to manipulate the bow, his sleeve has ridden low on his bicep.  The flat, basking in the luxury of fixed heating, is a few degrees warmer than usual.  There is no need for a dressing gown.
Rosie looks dubious.  “Does he think Father Christmas is real?”
“But Peter…”
And what a capricious sea it is: a tempest with towering waves, astounding joy at the foaming peaks and terror in the slumps of the valleys.  He is a pirate crew of one – captain, first mate, lookout.  He revels in the high points and weathers the low.
It was with a dead thud that John recognized the handwriting – of course he did.  It adorned his marriage certificate.
“I see,” Sherlock repeated.  He felt helpless, backed into a corner.  The morphine wasn’t working quickly enough, blotting out guilt and shame with seeping, mossy edges.  God, he wanted another hit.
Groaning, Sherlock turns back around and clamps his eyes shut.  “Well, I won’t be trying anything else tonight.  Not after you’ve thoroughly murdered my libido.”
Now, though… now John knows, more or less.  Surely gifts are acceptable?
John’s answering grin is wicked.  “The sock index.  I know you noticed.  You always do.”
“Har har,” Lestrade drawls, slurring a little.  “Don’t be a tit.  Only got the call ‘cause of the other case.”
John glowers at the thin square of light framing the closed door.  It isn’t his fault Irene Adler is dead.  It isn’t his fault Sherlock is heartbroken.  And if Sherlock is going to pine and wallow and reject John’s help in favor of snarling about his fucking sock index, he can go hang.
John scoots forward in his seat, reaches out.  His fingers are light against Sherlock’s temple, threading through his hair.  “I love you, too.  So much. Sherlock, you can’t—you can’t even know. Sometimes I’m terrified by how much I love you.”
“And he no doubt told you he’s busy at the clinic.  He
John dips his head for another kiss, but as Sherlock tilts his head, his injuries make themselves known.  He winces, breaking the kiss, and John’s eyes fly open in alarm.
Mrs. Hudson sniffled and covered her mouth with a hand.  “I sh-should be furious with you, John Watson,” she exclaimed, “but oh, you’re my boys, you and Sherlock both.  Please keep him safe.”
“Don’t be ridiculous,” he says, feigning annoyance.  A gleam of amusement flickers through Mary’s eyes, there and gone in an instant.  She’s rarely amused by his wit these days, and if she is, it’s a fleeting phenomenon.  “I told you I would always be there for you, didn’t I?  If you could do me the courtesy of a little
“Because your fine motor skills aren’t fully developed,” Sherlock says curtly.  “You’ll drop it.”
“Sh—”
“Hmm, no, suppose not,” drawled the puppet.  “I’m having so much fun.  But I’ll find it eventually.  I’m close.” A ragged, nasal inhale whistled down the line.  A predator scenting the air.  “I can almost
With a dubious glance at Sherlock, John shifted Rosie in his arms and laid her gently on the kitchen table.  The infant wriggled, but otherwise made no protest.  John stepped to the side and watched as Sherlock approached her.
John picked up the article on reward circuitry and slid it under the pile.  He picked the next one from atop the pile – genetic mutations in melanoma patients – and stared at it without absorbing the words.  “Right.”
he tells himself.
Sherlock snickered.  Mycroft, glaring, muttered, “There is a conspiracy at work here.”
Sherlock stills with his hands outstretched toward the shards.  Awareness flickers through his eyes.
“So,” said John, “you think this stalker wants to marry you?”
“No—”  John pauses, considers.  “Not in my state, anyway.  Still a little fuzzy.”
“All correct, Mr. Holmes.”
“Yes,” Sherlock said hoarsely.  Clearing his throat, he repeated, “Yes.  It’s in your chair.”
“Just… humor me?”
“A surprise?”
“Are you all right?” Sherlock blurts out, then presses his lips together, like he regrets the slip.
John laid his palms down on Sherlock’s, compelled by a force like magnetism, like the metal and blood and bone and heart of Sherlock Holmes were attuned specifically to him.  Separately, they were forever straining and incomplete.
John ushers Sherlock inside, mindful of his shaking shoulders.  He follows him, every muscle frayed, every nerve ending dead.  He is detached from the unwieldy weight of his own body.  He wants to cut himself free and fly into nothingness like a kite with a severed string.
Normally, he would let the call go to voicemail; he’s closing in on the answer like a tiger stalking its prey, crouched amidst the blood cells and waiting as the final piece of the puzzle wanders into the open.  Later, trying to recall what, precisely, made him pick up the phone, he will draw a blank.
“I wouldn’t move if I were you,” he growls.  Watching him,
you nutter.”
“My work is based on hard science – facts, irrefutable.  You can’t simply romanticize—”
Chuckling, John nudges Sherlock and runs a thumb over his knuckles.  “You can’t fool me, Sherlock Holmes.  Deep down, you’re a hopeless romantic.”
Here, though – here, Sherlock’s mind draws a blank.  A week ago, he would have envisioned disgust twisting John’s features as he hurled the knickers back in the drawer and slammed it shut.  But the parameters of their relationship have shifted, muddying waters that were once so clear.  Sherlock has begun to wonder if he misunderstood the very foundation they stand upon.
Alexander exhaled a gutted laugh.  “
Mary drew to his side, face softening as she studied the articles.  John wished he had hidden the topmost one from view.  Mary’s hand fell on his shoulder, kneading the scarred flesh beneath his shirt.  “I’m sorry.”
of his heartbeat reverberates through him like the pound of a war drum.
Sherlock offers a sluggish smile.  He turns his hand over to clasp John’s, careful of the pulse oximeter.  John leans in until his face is inches from Sherlock’s.
Ralph Smith, Violet’s uncle, had gone to one of the company’s top competitors with a newly-developed pesticide in hand.  Harmless to plants and people alike, and certain doom for any weed it touched, Smith’s product might have upheaved the agricultural industry in the United States with a single stroke.
Alexander tensed under his hand, eyes flashing bright and burning in a glare.  Sherlock released his sleeve and took one step back, instinctively planting his feet and turning slightly to present a narrower target.  Something told him that, crippled or no, this man would prove a formidable foe.  It was all in the posture, the bearing:  standing straight despite his leg, lifted chin, direct stare, hands clasped behind his back—
“Has Mycroft eaten all the profiteroles?”
“I’ve had a lot of practice being horrid to you,” Sherlock says, and the words are meant to sound flippant, but they don’t, they don’t at all.  It’s as if the hypnotic work of scrubbing has loosened his tongue.  “It only follows that I’d be adept at the opposite.”
Lestrade stopped him outside the police tape.  “John.  You haven’t spoken to him in a month?”
Sherlock grumbles mutinously and sips his tea.  The honey soothes his throat and curls warm and golden in the pit of his stomach.  Or perhaps that’s just the way John is looking at him:  soft and fond.
“You’re a mazikeen,” Sherlock noted, and the man’s eyes widened. “Half-selkie.  Come to check on your sister, have you?”
For a second, he thinks he can hear the whistling breathing hitch.  It’s a withered sound, like frozen branches clattering together in a gale.  Brittle laughter.
Sherlock unfolded from his armchair and went to the window, peering into the night as John strode down the street.  Anger rendered his gait menacing – he was again the lion, pacing across the plains.  Melting into the blackness, lost to sight.
Mrs. Hudson planted her hands on her hips.  “Sherlock Holmes,” she said, in the tone of someone about to launch into a scathing tirade, “if you think I’m going to—to contribute to your habit, you’d better think again.”
Mary grinned guiltily.  “Oh, yeah.  That.  Um, well, I was so completely fagged out, you know?  I was mostly working from muscle memory.”
“But why—”
“Er.  Quite.”
“Oh, stop.  You’re the one who keeps saying she doesn’t have a proper brain yet.”
The thought took John aback.  It had come so simply, as natural as breathing.  It felt as if he should have been thinking it for years – feeding Sherlock up, caring for him.  Loving him.
Sherlock closes the door to the loo and twists the shower lever, surging hot water into the bathtub.  As steam fogs the mirror, he opens the cupboard above the sink.  A squat row of candles stands on one shelf, as orderly as soldiers.  He gathers a handful and places them on the rim of the tub.  The wicks are reluctant to light, damp from the steam, but eventually he has tongues of flame licking a merry line around the rising water. Lastly, he crumbles a bubble bar under the running water, tinting the water purple and filling the loo with a perfume of rosemary and lavender.
Half an hour later, with the scavenged remains of their meal splayed across the table, Sherlock was still curled against John's side, knees raised to his chin like a child.  John didn't mind his weight; Sherlock was warm and pliant, if angular.  On the telly, Daniel Craig waged a threatening tête-à-tête with Javier Bardem.
Sherlock climbed out of the cab and followed John slowly, as if stumbling through a dense fog.  Facts were piecing together before him, startling and true.  Just like John himself.
As always, if you spot mistakes, please let me know so I can correct them!  Thank you.
“Come with me,” says John.
“Of course not,” says Catherine, rolling her eyes.  “Lottie miraculously always has prior commitments when I ask her.  Well…”  She trails off, smiling a little sadly at Sherlock and John.  “It was lovely to meet you both.”  She extends a hand, which John shakes.  She offers her hand to Sherlock, who stares, envy coiling inside him like black bile.  He wants nothing to do with Elise or her friends.
But Rosie only glares at her father through red-rimmed eyes.  She hurls down the violin bow; it arcs to the floor like a javelin, bouncing off one end and wobbling to a landing.  Blinking back tears, she spins around and races for the stairwell leading to her and John’s room.  Her footsteps fade as she retreats up the stairs, followed by a
“Come on, darling,” he sighed.  “Please, go to sleep…”
Mary’s response was prompt.
Ms. Helens stiffens.  In his peripheral vision, Sherlock sees John tense, jaw clenching as if to bite back a rebuke.  Years’ worth of little deductions flood back to Sherlock like a wave of bile; John’s own family life was tainted by abuse, though he’s never been open about it.  Swallowing past the guilt, Sherlock stares intently at Ms. Helens, awaiting her answer.
he thought,
“You don’t seem very devoted to your search.”
He knows better, now.
I'm Zingiberis on Tumblr.
“It’s your punishment for forgetting our anniversary.  Now, let’s eat.  This smells great.”
we h-have—we have to wait on that.  Sorry.  Just ended it with Eli—… I need to be tested again.”
“I’m fine,” John says.  “This is fine.”
Sherlock’s gaze slid toward the kitchen.  Mrs. Hudson had cleared out his paraphernalia and Mycroft had chased away his dealers, but there was a tile above the sink that could be pried off, a hole carved into the wall behind it, a few packets of powder stashed inside for emergencies.  A hit, that was all he needed.  Just a small hit to stop the shaking…
Reluctantly, he unwinds one arm from Sherlock and reaches for the phone. Sherlock snuffles sleepily, pressing his nose into John’s ribs.  John puts the phone to his ear.  “Hullo?”
In any other situation, Sherlock would be ripping his hair out at the roots. But now – now, he cannot fathom boredom. He is enraptured by the man in his arms, guiding him around the dance floor with the ease of long practice. Practice that Sherlock gave him, years ago, ensconced in 221B with the curtains closed against prying eyes.
“Necessary,” Mycroft corrected.  “Never interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake.”
“Bye, Mycroft.”
John can hear his pulse roaring behind his ears.  “Yes.  Okay.”
– were through, if Sherlock had read John’s implication correctly.
Without another word, John pivots and walks out of the alleyway, as easy as a man on a morning stroll.  Sherlock stands stock-still in his wake, blood pumping hot and urgent behind his ears, between his legs.
“I…”  The words stick in Sherlock’s throat.  “W-well, what were you, then?”
After all is said and done, though – after Sherlock informs Lestrade about the counterfeiters, he and John spend an interminable, awkward cab ride back to Baker Street, and hobble on numb legs up the stairs to 221B – they need a fair bit more than blankets to chase away the cold.  And the stink of the Thames.
John lowers his gaze, feeling flayed under Sherlock’s scrutiny.  “Um.  Yes, I. I suppose so.”
Sherlock blinks.  For a single heartbeat, his irritation evaporates and shame rushes in to fill the space.  Then he rallies, falling back on his tried-and-true defense:  scorn. “There’s no need to pitch a fit.”
“Got something I think will help,” he announces by way of greeting.  From John’s bed, Rosie peeks blearily over the covers.  Her own bed stands vacant on the other side of the room.  Between the two of them, it must be a challenge to walk.
John chuckles.  “That’s… infallible logic, yeah.  Certainly wasn’t dull last night.”
The tremor halts.  For a moment, Sherlock is silent.  Then, with the slightest prickle of impatience, he says, “Don’t stop.”
It’s a plague, this thought: it will not relent.
“Your talisman.”
Rosie sets up her castle while the adults open their gifts.  Mrs. Hudson beams at the teapot and giggles when she opens John’s gifts to find a kit of tea caddies.  She kisses each of them on the cheek and pronounces, “You two are nauseating.  Already getting couples’ gifts, bless you.”
Sherlock took a proper look at Craig’s text.  A second glance made his racing thoughts stumble in shock.
“They are,” says Ms. Helens, “but Rosie—”
Sherlock winds his arms around John’s shoulders and cants his hips, feeling his clothed, hardening cock press against the placket of John’s trousers.  John bites his lip, face flushing.  His mouth moves, words lost in the thumping, throbbing din of techno music blaring through the dark hall.  Sherlock reads his lips: an admonishment,
“I must get that in writing,” Sherlock muses sleepily.  He nestles into John’s side, throwing an arm across his torso. “For the next time you start whinging about my experiments.”
Sherlock searches for the right thing to say.  The warmth of minutes ago has abandoned him; his hands are shaking.
“No,” says John, “not that.  I’m talking about when she said your risk-taking would catch up with you.  She was right.”
On a cool, tepid-gray morning in February, Sherlock wakes to the fresh scent of herbs.  Eyes shut, he drags in a breath, savoring the cozy, slightly fusty aroma and all the mental images tethered to it – steam unfurling from an RAMC mug; rain-stippled windows and slate skies beyond the glass; the scrape of damp wool on his nape as he turns up his collar against autumn sleet.  It is the scent of comfort, of warmth, and Sherlock burrows in, waiting for the fog of sleep to reclaim him.
John crosses the room, two steaming cups of tea in his hands.  The morning light smooths out the creases on his face and brings out slivers of brown-gold in his hair.  Setting the cups down on the nightstand, he sits on the bed and feathers his fingers along the edge of the duvet.  “Good morning, love.”
John reaches down and settles his hand over Sherlock’s, thumb brushing over his knuckles.  Sherlock’s eyes widen.
“Sherlock,” he said.
“Well,” John mutters, “we know your notion of being saved is quite skewed, don’t we?”
The night after he jumps, John doesn’t sleep.  He thought he knew nightmares, thought he was inured to the sick lurch of surprise.
“Sherlock!  Listen. Listen to me.  Don’t lose your wits just yet.”
“Er, yeah,” said Sebastian, shrugging.  “Whatever.” With a wide, close-lipped smile, he leaned forward in his chair.  “I’m glad you could make it over. We’ve had a break-in.”
“Peaches!” Sherlock replied.  He whirled around and raced down the stairs before John could reply.
“I think,” says John, breathy, “we should stay.  Can’t be… can’t be rude.  To our guests.”
“No,” John says abstractedly.  “That’s not it.”
“Nothing,” Sherlock says, far too quickly.  He wills himself not to look at the sheet of paper, not to check for a telltale fume.
Double update again today!  I might continue doing two chapters a week until this is over.
“Shit—”  John sets aside the tea tray as Sherlock begins to crouch.  “Don’t, Sherlock.  Leave it.”
Sherlock craned his neck and scanned the room, but there was no sign of John.  He must have left.  Didn’t want to waste time on a losing battle when he could be holding his newborn daughter.  Sherlock dropped his head back onto the seat cushion.  A shimmering fog floated on the backs of his eyelids.
“You’ve been watching Baker Street, too?”
But one detail of Sherlock’s speech snags his attention.  “You said I have recurrent nightmares.”
cleverer person, at any rate.  So, unless you’re considering turning to the criminal masses, it’s safe to say I’m your best bet.”
– but in the meantime, Sherlock will be greedy.  He will keep them close.
“Hold on,” he gasped.  Shifting his weight to his right arm, he gripped Sherlock’s hip with one hand and sank in deep.  Sherlock yelped, but the cry twisted into a chant of
“You had an accomplice,” Sherlock says, thinking, frantically,
“You can’t—you can’t work me into this state and stop!”
“Sherlock,” Lestrade begins.
Mycroft smiled and scrunched his nose, derisive.  “And this favor would be…?”
Lestrade’s protestations faded into the background as he strode over to John.  The mazikeen’s expression was arranged in a stiff mask of innocence.
“Oh, for fuck’s sake,” John muttered.  “That’s repulsive.”
see things he might have noticed before, if he hadn’t been so preoccupied with Rosie and dismissive of everything else.
Hours after the disappearances, the first child was restored with as little ceremony as it had been stolen.  The girl – a swarthy little thing from Edinburgh – was found wandering the hills on the outskirts of the city, blinking and dazed.  Her shoes were missing and her tattered socks were caked with dried blood.  When asked what had happened, she said she couldn’t remember.  She was taken to hospital and slept for three days straight.
“Of course.”  John can hear the smile oozing across Mycroft’s features.  “I will keep you informed on the baby’s progress.  Once she is recovered, we can discuss her future… situation.”
– the consequences would be disastrous.  Sherlock was no stranger to death, but this felt… different, somehow.  Lucy Ferrier had come to him for help.  She had trusted him, and now she was gone.
“Did you meet any other applicants?” Sherlock asks.
Sherlock arrives on the scene with John in tow.  Ducking under the police tape and weaving through a crowd of officers to find Donovan, Sherlock blinks as spots of white in his vision swim with the blaring police lights.  He can barely hear the chatter as they pass, the keening of Mr. Ferrier and Jeff as Hopkins tries to console them.
“Oops,” says Mrs. Hudson.  She hauls herself out of her chair with a little huff.  God, she must be pushing a century.  “Looks like I misjudged.  Wait here, will you?”
He looked at the wriggling baby in his arms and felt the prickle grow into a jolt, traveling from her warm weight through his hands and into his chest, his heart.  John was helpless with love for her.  His Rosie, his baby.
Still Father Christmas says nothing – only stares, unmoved, the beam of his torch steady on Sherlock’s face.  After a long, charged moment, the beam sweeps up toward the ceiling.  Sherlock raises his head and follows the glow.
“It makes you human.”  John dips his head, kisses Sherlock gently, lingeringly.  “The most human human being I’ve ever known.”
“I admit,” Alexander said, his tone measured, “I haven’t been completely honest with you.”
The following evening finds Sherlock at his microscope once again, testing a second blood sample with the Coumadin.  If he’s right – as usual – the owner of this sample was quite cleverly murdered by her mother-in-law by what most would consider a papercut.
John stares at him for a beat, shakes his head, and chuckles.  He presses a knee between Sherlock’s thighs and pushes his weight forward, bringing their bodies flush together.  Sherlock gasps and John licks into his mouth, a slick and filthy promise.
Sherlock turned off the tap and looked at him.  “John, I would very much like to kiss you right now.”
“That’s mad, you know.”  John shook his head, but one corner of his mouth lifted in a smile.  For an instant, he looked younger – almost mischievous. Sherlock had an impression of John as a boy, all skinned knees and tousled hair and wild abandon.  Then John set his jaw and the smile vanished.  He scooped the crumbs into his open palm and rose to his feet.  “Besides, Harry’s teeth would be no good.  Probably eroded from all the drink and bile.”
First off, they keep
He settles for the armchair.  He will only sit for a few minutes, he thinks.  Just until his head feels clear.
Sherlock turns his head, finds Rosie standing in the doorway leading to the stairwell.  He cocks his head and she mimics the motion, birdlike, blue eyes inquisitive.
Sitting in the front seat with his hands clasped loosely over his knees, Hope was apathetic.  From the smear of shaving cream behind his ear to the pilled, ill-fitting jumper he wore, every aspect of the man suggested lifeless indifference.
“You forgot our first anniversary and think I’m still going to bed with you.”
“No,” says John, “but I don’t want you to freeze because His Nibs is too lazy to put on his coat.”
As John obligingly nibbles on a Delser Cracker, Sherlock fills the now-empty glass with ginger ale.  He is watching bubbles fizz and pop against the glass when John says, “You’re a marvel, you know that?”
Sherlock lowers his gaze to the teacup in his hands, bereft.  He raises the cup and takes a sip.  The tea has gone cold.
“Alexander,” Sherlock said, “tell me what
“Right.”  John’s voice was hollow.
Sherlock looks closer, frowns.  Looks closer still.  His mind flits back to Elise in the doorway of 221B, her expectant smile – lips a violent shade of crimson.  If she had given John so much as a peck, it would have left a mark as damning as any footprint or fingerprint.
But John only chuckles and tosses the duvet at him.  “Get up, you madman.  Her Majesty will be back in a minute.  She needs an audience to watch her open gifts.”
every drug you bring into the flat.  Side-effect of having a five-year-old, you see.  I don’t want anything dodgy within her reach.  You’ve not got any alemtuzumab in the flat, least not as of this morning.”
Sherlock lengthens his stride, determined to put as much space between him and Molly as possible.  He nears the bar, eyes picking over the dull detritus of humanity in his search for John. A television is mounted to the wall above the bar, showcasing a football game.  Lestrade sits in the neon glow of the screen, elbows on the bar and neck craned to watch.
Twenty minutes later, he arrives at Oldacre’s house on the edge of Bunchrew. He pays the fare, disembarks, and walks toward the glittering discord of police lights.  The fury that propelled him out of the restaurant has banked, smoldered down to hot embers of guilt.  Shame fills his mouth with the taste of ashes.
The door creaks open and John comes in, a steaming cup of tea in each hand.  He meets Sherlock’s eye with a weary smile.  “You look… energized.”
“Play with me, Sherlock,” said the puppet, its speech garbled and red.  “Play the game.”
“That…”
Pursing her lips, Rosie lets the matter drop.  Sherlock, eager to distract her, picks up the remote and changes the channel.  A Doctor Who Christmas special fills the screen.
John looked away, a muscle twitching in his jaw.
it’s more than a bit not good that John is thinking like this.  Sherlock hasn’t returned
“You look beautiful, darling,” says John indulgently.
He makes one edit, and one alone.  It’s a shot in the dark, a leap of faith.  The publishing house might throw a tantrum.  They might call John demanding he rein in his recalcitrant husband. They might reject it out of hand, delete it and publish the book without a word of its existence.
“Yes, well.  After that?”
Sherlock blinks again, his mind tripping as it races to process the question.  He swallows convulsively, feels his throat close around his pulse.  He thinks,
A muscle jumped in John’s jaw.  Eyes narrow, he nodded.  “Yeah.  Took me a long time to sort that, I know.”
“D’you know,” begins Rosie.
Then, shockingly, she says, “One of my classmates, Timmy, has two mums.”
“I know,” Sherlock repeats, while his traitorous thoughts whisper,
Mrs. Hudson gave him a put-upon look.  She made a bit of a show of looking at the IV bag hanging at John’s bedside and arched an eyebrow.  “Strong stuff, that.  You forget when you haven’t tried in a while.  Herbal soothers only go so far.”
“I’m sorry,” he says, or tries to say.  His voice is a scrape of sandpaper.
John rolls his eyes.  “You are such a cock.”
Sherlock nods.
, all jumbled into fragmented speech.
“Yeah.  Yes.”  Sherlock closed his eyes and pressed his hands to his forehead.  “And I fell… no… it
“I don’t wanna,” Rosie protests.  “I want you to!”
Before John, he would never have considered such a method.  Before John, sex had been a vague interest at best – a clammy, too-close discomfort.  Before John, the concept of one person finding their perfect match in another had seemed ridiculous, a fantasy of the romance-addled masses.
Apparently they did.  When the Fair Folk had a fancy for them.
“Right after…”  And the words crumbled on Sherlock’s tongue.  He had left the house after lunch, with the midday sun presiding over his journey.  Now, shadows crowded around them.  Beyond the cover of trees, lurid streaks of violet and salmon unfurled in the sky like pennants heralding twilight.
a case it is, with a pair of madmen and a dead woman tucked away in a cottage in the Cornish countryside, with the sky slate gray and the land jutting in peaks and crags and the sea a seething, misty veil in the distance.  A salty breeze plucks at John’s hair, tosses strands across his brow, and Sherlock’s hands itch to smooth them back into place.  He takes to keeping them in his pockets, keeping them in check.
John returned minutes later, expression dark.  “He’s gone. Where…” Then he saw Sherlock’s face.  His eyes widened. “Are you hurt?”
“What…”  Sherlock begins.
“That you like rescuing me.”  Sherlock leans forward, bats his eyelashes like a maiden.  “My hero.”
Sherlock won the Ian Monkford game, but he had little time to revel in his victory.
Winter smirked.  “Just a little peek now and then.  Checking in, you know.”
“Oh, my God,” John is saying, over and over and over.  “Oh, God.  Sherlock.  Sherlock, can you hear me?”
John is a little surprised to realize he isn’t angry.  Not exactly – annoyed, maybe.  But not angry.  Not furious that Sherlock has invaded his life and laid bare one of his most shameful secrets without pause.  This may just be how Sherlock is, full stop.
“Of course.”  Limbs leaden, he retreated to his armchair, sinking into the cushions with a sigh.  With a wave, he said, “Go on, then.”
Silence.  Then, John gasps.  “Oh, God.”
“Sherlock,” John hisses.
A shape hurtles toward Woodley, so swiftly Sherlock’s eyes can scarcely follow. The shape – the man –
“Athleticism does help,” says John.  “Good equipment, too.”
“Indeed,” Mycroft said at length.  “In any case, he wasn’t the big fish we were hoping to catch.  He was chum.”
“Father Willis.”  Sherlock’s voice is a murmur, a warm breath in his ear.  John shivers.  “Come back to replace the votive candle.  He knows Father Mays lit one before he killed him.  His fingerprints are all over the wax.”
told me that.  She told me that all the time.”
John utters a little gasp.  “Oh.  Oh, my God.”  Then he’s reaching for Mr. Holmes, and Mr. Holmes takes his hand in a firm grip.  John’s face is drained of color.  For a moment, I’m afraid he’s going to faint.
The gunshot came first.  Sherlock staggered.  Then came the gasps, the screams, filling the hall with their discordant symphony.  Clamoring, mindless terror filled the air as people stampeded for the door, knocking into each other, pushing each other aside to clear a path.  Sherlock swayed.  His mobile tumbled out of his hand and clattered to the floor.  John’s voice was so small, so far away… and then it was gone, lost in a metallic crunch as a woman ran past, crushing Sherlock’s phone beneath her heel.
John snorts at that.  Still shaking with laughter, he leans down to kiss the pouting line of Sherlock’s mouth.  “You have no right to make something so ridiculous sound so… so.”
“John,” said Sherlock.
“Sod my head,” Sherlock mutters, running his hands up John’s neck, twining his fingers in silver-blond hair.  “Kiss me.”
Ice fills Sherlock’s veins.  John’s tone speaks volumes: hesitation and purpose intertwined, opposing elements sharpening into a single piercing weapon.  John doesn’t want to hurt Sherlock’s feelings; John needs to be clear that whatever happened under the mistletoe – didn’t happen,
“Oh, stop,” said the puppet.  “This is
“Sherlock,” says John, gentle but firm, “Let’s go.  You need to be monitored to make sure you haven’t suffered any brain damage.”  He lowers his voice.  “Let Lestrade sort out this mess.  Tomorrow, we’ll focus on the killer.”
The paramedic goes white.  Poor thing. Really has no idea who he is trifling with, though clearly he has the sense to know the danger in which he’s just placed himself.  He gives an audible gulp and offers John a hand.
His eyes do water a little, at the baptism.  But that’s only because the church is abominably stuffy.
“You came back to London shortly after you were discharged.  How could you…”  Sherlock trailed off, blinking as understanding dawned.  “Time dilation.”
This is all so new – being in London, looking covertly for my birth father, being
) shoulder.
He says, “I’m cold.”
“Yes.”
Ms. Helens scrutinizes Sherlock like she might a tiger in the zoo – intrigued, but all-too aware of the claws beyond the glass.  “He wanted to know where my brother worked and where he received care.  He had trouble keeping a job, but I told the Detective Inspector the most recent places he’d worked.  And Catherine looks…”  She trails off as her fingers curl tightly in the knit cap.  “…Catherine looked after him.”
Not a large room, mind.  Barely the size of a broom cupboard, it was tucked away far from anything of significance.  Nowhere near the foyer, the galleries, the halls. He didn’t want John to distract from the Work.
“Yes,” says Sherlock.  His own voice sounds faraway, muffled by the rhythmic churning of the Thames.  “Yes, I do love your father.”
A picture filled the screen, replacing Moriarty’s face with that of Mary Morstan.  Stripped of several years, her skin was smoother, her eyes less shadowed.  Her hair, pulled back into a neat bun at the nape of her neck, was tinted caramel.
“Don’t, John,” he hissed.
Without another word, he led the three to a sitting room, where he bade them sit on a sofa with cushions so deep John feared he would sink in and never be rescued.  He shifted uncomfortably as Craig pulled a laptop from a shelf crammed with more laptops, video games, and a tangle of wires.  Taking a seat across from them, he flipped open the laptop and began typing.
Sherlock is awake, staring at him from the bed with glassy eyes.
“Yes,” said Sherlock, “but given that Sylvius and Sala were able to slip through Mycroft’s net, he was beginning to suspect an inside job.  I told Alexander I had to remove him as a suspect.”
“Ta very much,” John says as Sherlock sits beside the tub, brandishing his bounty.  His expression turns to mock outrage as Sherlock rips off the plastic wrapping, lifts the lid, and inspects the labels written underneath.  “That’s cheating.”
John’s mouth works.  “Well, then. You understand.”
“In a meeting.”  Sherlock doesn’t elaborate, and Ferguson has enough sense to cut straight to the case.
“McFarlane family crest,” Ferguson supplies.  “Confirmed it from Hector McFarlane’s mum, Ella.  Doesn’t get much more solid than this.”
John says sharply, and Sherlock shuts his mouth with a click.  John’s expression softens.  Squeezing Sherlock’s hands, he interlaces their fingers, drawing close and lowering his voice.  “Don’t talk like that.  Please.”
When he slips into slumber and the dream begins –
“No.”  Sherlock craned his neck.  From this vantage point, he could just make out John’s right wrist, the skin puckered and red.  “Su Lin had a garden on the top floor of her building. Cultivated the peaches for hundreds of years.  The first ones might have granted immortality, but they would go rotten like any other fruit.”
With a sudden yank that spoke of inhuman strength, Moriarty rent the coat down the middle.  Sherlock flinched, feeling as if something inside him had been torn away.  Lucy.
A buzz cut through his reverie, and he tugged his cellphone out of his pocket to study the screen.  The text was from an unknown number, though the country code was from the United Kingdom.  Bemused, he thumbed the screen open and read on:
Sherlock blinks and registers the cab waiting for them at the curb.  “Oh.”
Rosie tenses and studies the crumbs.  Diligently, she wipes her hand on her shirt, then brushes off the sofa.  “Better.”
He must have dozed off mid-seductive pose, because the next thing he is aware of is the
Finally, while studying the accessories in a high-end clothing shop, Sherlock’s eyes come to rest on a pair of topstitched leather gloves.
“Suppose you don’t normally start being a terror until after midnight.” John frowns.  “Or until the wee hours, anyway.”
Sherlock’s eyes flicked toward the open door.  He looked like a cornered animal.  After a moment, he hobbled toward the door and shut it.  He hobbled back to his chair and set himself down with supreme caution, grimacing.
“Apologies for the wait,” he said.  Coughing delicately, he waved one hand, sending dust motes spinning.  “It’s only that the last chair of this set has been here for years, and though it’s valuable, this is a small shop…”
“Good man.”
”  He looked at the chair – at the smooth, unmarked legs.  “
“What?”  John blinked. “Sherlock?”
The answer comes to Sherlock in an instant.  Frankly, he’s embarrassed that the NSY got to it first, but they had a dozen men to do the work, and none, presumably, with head injuries.  It still rankles him.
“Oh.”  Sherlock shrugs and glances at John.  John is mid-way through
Next updates will be on Wednesday and Friday.
is lines grooving his eyes, softening his mouth – the sense of languid contentment when a case is solved and the villains have been vanquished.
“I like you
Sherlock looked up from Toby to ask, “Can you track the signals to their receivers?  We know where the GPS devices are – we need to find the people responding to them.”
“Sher-lock,” said Mary in a singsong voice.
“Sherlock?”  John’s voice rings through the air.  “You there?”
“All right?” he mumbles.
“No.”  Lady Smallwood sighed.  “I know he’s a genius, but really.  He can be a complete pillock about some things.”  She looked at Sherlock askance.  “I apologize if I’ve alarmed you.”
John’s face contorted as though in great pain.  The wrongness of it sank into Sherlock, hurting in a deep, visceral way.  John shouldn’t be in pain.  It spurred a torrent of thoughts and
But when Sherlock musters his courage and strips off his glove to hit the “answer” button, the call is disconnected.  The screen goes dark.
“The killer,” Sherlock gasps.  Still straddling his lap, John shoots him a beleaguered look.  Sherlock pinches the crease of his thigh and John slaps his hand away.  “Just one moment, Lestrade.”
“It’s not so bad,” says John, eyes lingering on an imperial purple wool scarf.  A potential gift for
The fact that he’s alive now might almost be called
“Ah.  Lovely.”
Surprise flashes across Sherlock’s face, swiftly concealed.  “Yes.  Yes, of course.  I’m fine.”
“Sherlock,” said Mrs. Hudson, “I didn’t hear the door open or close, and I had the door to my flat open all morning.”
The moment Violet Smith sets foot in the flat, Sherlock feels an iron band cinch tight around his heart.
Gritting his teeth, Sherlock banishes that thought to the back of his mind.  Now is not the time for self-pity; now is the time to be brilliant.  He has to make the killer talk, make him gloat.  The clever ones always gloat.
Lucy shook her head.  “It’s not just that he’s stalking me, Mr. Holmes.  It’s…”  She paused, blew out a sigh.  “This sounds… mad, I know.  But when I mentioned the stalker to my father, he… he told me about his life before.  Before he met my mum and had me, when he lived in America.  He was part of some kind of cult.”
“Remember, I’ll check on you every few hours,” John says as they shuffle to Sherlock’s bedroom.  Naked and damp, Sherlock lifts the duvet and slips underneath, grateful for concealment.  The room is lit with a pale, rosy light from the city beyond the window drapes.  London is just beginning to rouse, but Sherlock can’t imagine staying awake another minute.  As John leaves, he closes his eyes.  Sleep claims him.
Until… until.
“That’s… incredibly fucked up,” John concedes.  “So, this killer is using Paget Shopping Center – where Porter and Goodwin worked – as a hunting ground.  That narrows down our search, at least.”
The reserve on John’s face slowly melts into understanding.  His mouth softens, and oh, Sherlock wants to kiss that mouth, and half-steeped in dreams as he is, it seems the simplest thing in the world to reach out and draw John to him.  John lifts his chin, lips parting, and Sherlock kisses him with the earnest abandon of a dreamer.
John’s fingers flew, opening a new webpage and typing in the address.  A map proclaimed the address to belong to a business in St. James’s.  He closed the webpage, shut the laptop, and wedged back the piece of comforter in what he hoped was a successful recreation of the scene.
“I can handle myself,” said Harry, with a conviction that suggested she had spent her life doing just that. “Anyway, I’m used to it.  Can’t be gay
“Yeah.”  John’s breathing is just as irregular as Sherlock’s.  “Christ, yes, Sherlock… hurry…”
Their tranquil beauty catches Sherlock off-guard.  He exhales a sound, half-breath, half-
John lowered his head and pinched the bridge of his nose.  “Jesus Christ.  Ignore her. She’s talking nonsense.”
Sherlock led John into his bedroom.  As he passed the threshold, John saw a jumble of nails, screws, and bars on the floor.  Some of them had been put together, taking shape:  a railing, bars, a base.  His breath caught; he knew what Sherlock was building.  He had built one himself.
John eyes slip closed and his hips cant forward.  Falling back, Sherlock curls two fingers over the waistband of John’s boxers and tugs, eager and insistent.
“Doesn’t seem to have slowed you down,” Wiggins grumbled.
“I love you,” said Sherlock, “and when your heart stopped after Winter shot you, I felt as though I would go mad with grief.  For ninety-six seconds, you were, strictly speaking, dead.  Ninety-six seconds.  I was dead for two years.”  Full lips pressed together, bloodless with pressure.  “John, you may have hurt me.  But after knowing what it’s like to lose you, I will never forgive myself for letting you think I was dead all that time.  I may spend the rest of my life trying to earn your forgiveness, but I will never forgive myself.”
“She is still the Queen.”
John wore the necklace whenever he went out, concealed under layers of jumpers and coats, unnoticeable unless you were looking for it.  Sherlock was always looking.
He mentally flicks through the information compiled in his research.
”  He fell silent, a wrinkle forming between his brows as he looked pensively at the letter.
He thought it was a fish, at first.  A shape darted through the water, bone-white, skimming the surface with scarcely a ripple.  Sherlock glanced down and his eyes widened: not a fish.  A hand
John covers his face with his hands.  “You
Sherlock has the petri dish of the final blood sample sitting on the microscope stage when his mobile begins to ring.
For all Sherlock’s whinging, Greg Lestrade is not, in fact, an idiot.  He’s actually quite sharp when he has to be.  The position of Detective Inspector didn’t just fall into his lap. It’s only when Greg is well and truly stumped that he’ll call in Sherlock, and even then, it’s a toss-up as to whether the little snot will deign to put on trousers and grace them with his presence.
“Helen,” John said.  The head nurse at their clinic was notorious for bending rules.
“Of all the Bond films, that one is perhaps the most ridiculous.”
“Rosie’s at Molly’s for the night, so you’ve got the place to yourself.  You can play beautifully or terribly to your heart’s content.”
It was the steady thrum of the heart monitor that woke John, each
With a bemused smile, John walks inside, still studying the wig.  “This hasn’t got mold in it, has it?”
“She hurt me!” Samantha exclaims.  As she turns to glare at them, Sherlock sees a fresh red bruise welling on her jawline.  “She put ice in her snowball!”
Piggy hesitates, darting a glance at Sherlock.  John keeps his eyes fixed on Cotton Bud, but his finger tightens around the trigger as if he’s read the thug’s thoughts.  His voice is quietly menacing.  “If you so much as scratch him, I’ll put a bullet in you.”
“Got an old friend of yours with me,” Sherlock replied.  “We were just reminiscing about the good old days.  Honestly, I think he was looking at you through
she bellows.
“Um.  Yeah. Yes.”
But something about the case nags at Sherlock – it seems too cut-and-dry, too
Yeah.
John drew a steadying breath, praying his voice would not break.  “Right.”
“Local,” the second voice barked.
To her credit, Rosie looks a bit discomfited at the sudden outpouring of love.  Even five-year-old Britons know too much sentiment can never be a good thing.  She studies them in silence for a while, face screwed up like she’s trying to divine a reading from murky tea leaves.
His hands twitch.  Without John’s touch, he feels as though every impulse is short-circuited.  John watches intently, then says, “Would—would you come up, too?  She’s had a shock.  I think seeing both of us will help her rest.”
Sherlock pursed his lips around a retort.
“Yeah, I…”  Bracing his weight between Sherlock’s hand and the wall, he took an experimental step.  “I think so.  Just need to get to my…”
Sherlock turns, entwines his fingers with John’s.  Follows John through the sitting room, down the corridor, into Sherlock’s bedroom.  The door clicks shut behind them.  John looks at him, and
It’s a deliberate avoidance, like skirting a steep, deadly precipice. Dread twists in Sherlock’s belly. “I know.”
Sherlock looks around the stall with apparent interest.  “An interesting design, these confessionals.  The traditional one, I believe.  Unless I’ve deleted them.”  He shrugs, the motion a languorous slide against John that can’t possibly be accidental.  “The priest is hidden away, but the penitent is so… exposed.  No doors to hide behind.  All their secret sins out for the entire world to know.”
Beyond the glass, two teapots stood out from the group, the clay polished to a lustrous sheen.  Hundreds of years old, and yet—Sherlock’s hands twitched at his sides. Did Su Lin feel her own mortality when she handled the teapots?  Or were they mere objects to her, nonexistent past the scope of her own life?
“Oh.”  John’s fingers tighten in Sherlock’s curls, sending pain skittering along his scalp.  Arousal pulses thick and syrupy in Sherlock’s veins.  Leaning forward, he swallows down John’s cock, choking off a groan as John pulls his hair, sharp and painful with his own desperation.  His hips twitch, a restrained thrust, a moan: and then John is coming, pulsing and bitter, filling Sherlock’s mouth.  Sherlock swallows, swallows again.  When John’s bitten-off cries have ceased, Sherlock lets his prick slip from his lips.  He kisses the inside of John’s thigh.  John’s fingertips glide over his scalp, sparking nerves in their wake.
Sherlock turned his head for a better vantage point and stopped as something in his peripheral vision registered as
Sherlock begins to shake in his arms.  “She was so cold when I pulled her out of the water.  She barely felt human.”
“Really?  I was just going to ask if you would marry me.”
Sherlock offers his hand.  “Come here.”
But Sherlock had looked at him, and John felt his misgivings crumble.  It was a look of fear and vulnerability, one that clamped John’s jaw around his words.
“John Watson,” said Sherlock, “you are the strongest person I know.”
Sherlock scrutinizes John, head tilted, as if he expects to discover something from a new angle.  Nodding, hands curling into fists, he turns on his heel and stalks down the corridor to his bedroom.  The door snaps shut behind him, leaving John alone.

“She could be—”
Sherlock turned on his side and draped his arm over John’s chest.  He hadn’t been in aroused moments ago, but the warmth and solidity of John’s body presented an alternative to a hit.  He wriggled closer, feeling his cock thicken against John’s thigh.
What had possessed him to pry into John’s personal affairs?  John was interesting by virtue of being a mazikeen, as well as a doctor and soldier.  Whatever vices he suffered were none of Sherlock’s concern.  In fact, if he hadn’t encouraged John’s penchant for danger, Sherlock would have been dead by now.  Dead twice over, thrice over.
“Don’t you have nappies to change?”
Sherlock sees it, the moment before Donovan leads Violet to the police car. The young lady turns, her vacant eyes finding his, lips forming silent words.
John curled one hand around Sherlock’s prick, smearing his thumb over the head.  Sherlock jumped and whined; his hands dropped to the bedclothes and gripped tight.  Precome beaded on the tip of his cock, smoothing John’s strokes.
John pulls away with a grimace.  “Lovely.”
A message.
“…and you’re being, er.  Quite cheerful.”
“You’re heavier than you look,” John said.  He stood and held out a hand to help Sherlock up.  “Alright?”
Sherlock responds with a slow, cautious nod.  The tenderness in John’s tone has caught him off-guard.  He’s never given much thought to his hands, aside from their role as essential tools to the Work.  Why should John cares how he treats them?
“Well.  Yes, somewhat.”  John lets his head rest atop Sherlock’s.  “My mad genius.”
“What pieces?” Sherlock asks, eyes narrowing.
Sherlock humors him.  Flicking his gaze up and down John’s form, he gathers data on the person he knows most and least in all the world.  Because every time he thinks he’s got John Watson figured out, John reveals a yet-undiscovered piece of himself.  He is an elegant chemical compound breaking down and down and down again.  Sherlock can get down to the very atoms only to find them breaking again.  His greatest unsolved mystery.
John had no Mind Palace.  His memory was less convoluted, more direct.  As far as memory tricks went, he needed a single folder, into which the sheaf of Sherlock’s medical report was tucked.
Sherlock’s hands shook as he put the tea tray down on the sitting room table, making the China rattled and the tea slosh.  He flexed his fingers and stared at his hands; the shaking lessened, but a low-grade tremble coursed through him like an electric current.
Sherlock was nothing if not selfish and reckless.  “Well, I won’t be on my own, will I?”
“You… you certainly cut to the chase, Mr. Holmes,” she says.  “DI Lestrade didn’t ask about my childhood.”
“Fucking hell,” John groaned, and thrust again, again, rough and uncoordinated.  Sherlock was lost in his own pleasure, hand blurring over his prick – and then he stiffened, spurting over his fingers with a sob.  The spasms of his body tightening around John’s cock drove John immediately to his peak and he pushed as deep as he could go and stilled, pulsing into that tight heat, cursing under his breath.
“Not exactly,” John said.  He stepped forward and took Rosie into his arms.  As Mrs. Hudson removed the towel from her shoulder, he noticed a yellowing stain of spit-up crusting the fibers.  “Sorry.  Was she…?”
“Not you,” says John.  “Sorry.”
John laughs weakly when Sherlock returns, their mop bucket in one hand and a sleeve of Delser Crackers in the other.  In the crook of his arm, Sherlock has tucked a bottle of ginger ale.  He sets down the bucket beside the bed, sets the bottle on the nightstand, and rips open the sleeve of crackers with his teeth.
“Homework.”  Rosie’s nose scrunches at the word.
It isn’t that funny.  In fact, it’s distinctly un-funny.  But Sherlock doubles over, clutching his belly as his chuckles boil into gales of laughter.  It’s because he’s with John, and everything with John is absurd and nonsensical and
“Well.  Maybe a little.”
Mrs. Hudson beams at him.  Sherlock can’t tell if she’s seriously misjudging the hard look on John’s face or if she simply doesn’t care.  In the kitchen, the kettle begins whistling and she leaves to attend to it.
God, he couldn’t blame the man for being shocked.
Sherlock scoffs.  “And you call
I'm Zingiberis on Tumblr.
John stays.  They spend the rest of the day in bed unless absolutely necessary – food, the loo, milky tea – and the sun roves through the sky to slump across the western horizon and vanish over the cusp of the world.  John is always at Sherlock’s side, the rhythm of his heart pressed to Sherlock’s ribs, the susurrus of his breath fanning against his neck.
“For a first anniversary. Or, in our case, a belated first anniversary.”
“Goodnight, John.”
Mary’s eyes widened.  “If Sherlock doesn’t want you around, of course.”  Her unspoken question rang in the silence between them:
I'm Zingiberis on Tumblr.
I love you, John. –SH
“And Sherlock turned in the memory stick,” Molly added.  Greg shot her a look of mock indignation and she smiled, amending, “You figured it out before then, of course.”
“John, why do I…”  He trails off, hesitant.
It’s all John’s fault, of course.
“Yes,” said John, “she wants her… Um.  I have to feed her.  Be right back.”
thrills through his heart, floods his veins with molten gold.
“…your eyes.  Sherlock?  Are you listening?”
“Right, sorry.”  The smile hardened into a firm line.  “We have to talk about last night.”
In his dreams, Sherlock is lissome and lovely, every shiver and hitching breath setting John’s blood on fire.  In his nightmares, Sherlock is falling and breaking and shattered and bloodied.
Sherlock remembers lying on the cold, hard floor of the freezer, feeling each sensation ebb as the chill nibbled into flesh and bone.  A phantom shiver skates down his spine.  Had Peter made the connection, watching Sherlock slowly freeze and remembering his young sister?  “Your brother’s condition was less severe, back then.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Brilliant deduction, yeah,” says John, but he sits beside Sherlock and raises a hand to his forehead, so he must not be
John slides his feet forward, tangling them with Sherlock’s.  He smears a lazy, uncoordinated kiss to Sherlock’s shoulder and mumbles, “Love you.”
Sherlock senses he is being watched.  He turns to find John in the kitchen doorway, leaning against the frame with arms crossed.  He catches Sherlock’s eye and smiles, then calls, “Right, it’s time for dinner.  Come on.”
“God.”  John sighed.  “Fine.  But I’m bringing my gun.”
John nodded and tacked “new blankie” onto the ever-growing list of Rosie’s needs.  He reached into the crib and offered Rosie his hand.  Her fingers wrapped around his forefinger, tiny but strong.  She dragged his hand toward her and John obliged with a chuckle.
Sherlock notes, studying the corpse’s pale hands.  The fingernails are neatly-trimmed.
“Did you just call me a—”  A giggle bubbles up from Sherlock’s chest, surprising him.  “A
The ride to Roland-Kerr Further Education College passed in a reverent kind of hush.  Sherlock sat at a dining table across from Jefferson Hope and a pair of pill bottles was placed before him.
Sherlock added, “I trust Alexander, John.  You have nothing to fear.”
Sherlock’s last recourse was to punch John.  John was much more amenable after that.
Mycroft had known what had happened between Sherlock and John the moment he set foot in the flat.  Possibly earlier.
“John,” he says.
“Thank you, Mrs. Hudson,” Sherlock said.  “You can go now.”
“Thank you for looking after her,” John says to Mrs. Hudson.  “Bit… last minute, I know.”
“I said ‘raving,’ not ‘shouting!’” Sherlock shouts back.  In the periphery of his vision, he notes the wary looks of passers-by, but he can’t be arsed to care.  “And those were all for cases!  They help the Work!”  He draws up to his full height, glowering down his nose at John.  “Which is more than I can say for you!”
Mycroft coughed wetly and croaked, “Sherlock.”
Sherlock wished he still had the bruise John had given him; its bloom had been lovely and violent.  He had tracked its progress for a week before the blues and violets had faded into the color of rot.  The skin now was unblemished – as dull as a blank sheet of paper.  Sherlock wanted to tear it into pieces.
Sherlock hesitates for an instant before climbing onto the bed and crowding into John’s embrace, burying his face in the crook of his neck.  John gathers him close, one hand stroking the small of his back as the other buries in his hair.  He can feel Sherlock’s heart drumming hummingbird-swift against his breastbone.
“My God,” Sherlock said.
“Do you have any qualms, doctor?”
And John, being John, knows what Sherlock is thinking without a word spoken.  He reaches for Sherlock’s hand, clasped on his lap, and pauses.  Sherlock rolls his eyes and takes the proffered hand, trying not to think about phlegm or the clogged drainpipe sound or the standard incubation period of influenza.  Their fingers twine and press, and it’s nice, it’s better than nice.  It’s love.
A niggling question wormed through John’s morphine haze.  “And Sherlock… has he been here?”
John takes a swig of his beer and shakes his head.  Around their table, the pub is alive with voices raised in laughter and conversation that promises to become bawdier as the night progresses. “Lucky that we had a case to investigate, really.  It’s no trouble.”
“Well, obviously you didn’t hear it, with all the bustling and cleaning you do.  No doubt you were singing some dreadful Iron Madame or whatever and you didn’t hear.”
Sherlock blinks.  “About what?”
“Come on me,” Sherlock rumbled.  “I need it, need you to mark me…”
The thought clangs in John’s mind, so loud he’s certain Mary can hear it.
“Sherlock?”  John cocks his head, a furrow deepening in his brow.  “You okay?”
John sighed and leaned back against the seat.  “Well, I’m ready for anything.  Let’s crack on, shall we?”
“Right,” Sherlock replied.  “Yes, of course.”
John’s smile was grim.  “‘Course not.”
“Why do you need to be forgiven?”
For a moment, standing together in a haze of rosemary and lavender, watching the candle flames flicker like streetlamps on a misty night, John does not react.  Then recognition sparks in his eyes.
Rosie blinks, looks from her father to Sherlock and back again.  A little furrow forms on her brow.  “Are we going?”
“Sherlock!”  Meaty hands clamped around his shoulders and dragged him onto the banks of the pond.  Dazed, Sherlock blinked.  His brother stared down at him.  His eyes – usually remote, disapproving – were wild.  The freckles splashed across his nose and cheeks were vivid against his ashen skin.  “Sherlock.  Can you hear me?”
“It doesn’t have a taste,” Sherlock mumbled, his words puffing warm against the crook of John’s neck.
But John was a soldier and, as he had done so many times before, he soldiered on.  He looked Mycroft straight in the eye and nodded.  “Right.  That’s that, then.”
Lucy, Westie’s fiancée, was clearly a selkie.  A mazikeen, yes, but half-blooded.  The genetic quirk of selkies gave female offspring all the traits of selkies and male offspring none.  Born with their own seal coat – the logistics of which were as mythical as the Fae themselves – women descended from full-blooded selkies could opt to live on land or sea, without the compulsion to belong to either.
might propose to
“I assure you,” said Sherlock, “she is.  Only she recently murdered the closest person my brother had to a friend, so she’s in hiding for now.  I can arrange for you to visit her, once we have her in a secure facility.”  The last remark was delivered with indifference, and John realized with a jolt that Alexander could turn on them if he still loved Mary.
John was surprisingly excited about the whole affair.  For such a reserved man, he was eager to talk about his time in Scotland – visiting his grandparents in Edinburgh, of his grandad regaling him and Harry with stories, tales of warm hearths and ghosts on windswept knolls.  Seated across from John, Sherlock was enraptured by his husband as the flat land gave way to rolling hills and jutting crags.  The Scottish Highlands unfolded in all their epic grandeur, and Sherlock was blind to all of it.
