He picks up and reads one of the scientific papers on his father’s desk one day after school. It is about how some people are attracted to another person by scent. That's why some frown upon perfumes and think wearing them is a bad idea. Sherlock considers not putting on his father’s cologne the next morning but does it anyways.
'I'm John.'
'In my chair.'
After saying these two words he went back to hunching over his bag, rustling through its contents.
'A pleasure.'
As the weeks turned to months and these months passed, it became evident to me that my fascination for people had extended that of the girl with pink hair.
I tried to ignore the fact that all 28 of my classmates were potentially looking at the back of me as I was proving for the thousandth time that I was just an intelligent douche who was 'asking for it'.
The clicking of the keyboard had a different sounding pattern to it.
'I swear Im trying to kick it over to you.'
'Well why are there two ch-'
John switched his hands as they walked. He removed his right hand from Sherlocks and quickly filled the space with his left hand. His right hand lovingly slid up sherlocks arm, to where it bent at the elbow, and wrapped itself around the skinny arm. They were now walking with linked arms instead of intertwined hands. As John hugged the mans arm tight he momentarily rested his head on his partner. He couldn't quite reach Sherlocks shoulder.
Sherlock giggles.
John looked nervous but somehow managed to make friends almost right away.
When he gets to school he is so excited to make friends but realizes he doesn’t know how. He watches the others play. Observing in silence.
We sat on the floor of our high school. In a hallway of crowded people, all I saw was her. Surely we disgusted the people who walked by. In fact, we did. I read it plainly on their faces and saw the body language of the people who looked on us from the corners of their eyes, faces to the floor. My weak ego would be damaged by their disgust if I had cared. But with my girl at my side, there were no shits to be given to the passer buyers.
'I said, what will it be this morning?' John was calling out from the kitchen turning the oven on.
The days continue on the same for a while. Every morning starts with freshening up and every day is spent observing the social behaviors of the other children. He spends so much time observing and has gotten very good at it. So good that he can never understand how he almost missed the day John walked into class for his first day.
Without answering, he stood from his chair and followed John to the carpeted area. He let the boy who was good at making friends, and good at fake wrestling matches, grab blocks from a nearby storage chest. It was decorated to look like a pirate’s treasure chest and Sherlock had longed to go play with it ever since he saw it on the first day. Longed to, but had not had a reason to until now.
'What?'
When the bell rang I debated saying something to him but I held back and gathered my things, leaving the classroom faster than I ever had. With the thoughts that the events that had just played out were also part of some elaborate dream, I headed towards the stairways with the doors, and walked in shock to art class.
In fact, I felt sorry for them. An emotion I was told I lacked. The people who displayed disgust were more or less confused and hated us because they simply did not understand. There were many things my peers did not fully understand. The poor souls who had not experienced love. To them it was foreign and what scared them most was how young we were. As if high school and love did not belong in the same sentence. On the same page.
One of his long legs had made its way in between Johns two outstretched legs which John didn't mind one bit. He too lay on his back focusing on his rising and falling chest as he tried with every breath to fall back into sleep until morning when it would be time to meet his lover again.
‘Sherlock?’
‘You fucking dick.’
Sherlocks shiny black shoes were visible from where they lay on the floor.
Sherlock lay asleep on his stiff wood like back. His torso and chest moved agreeing with every breath.
John piped up.
‘John. Would you like some ravioli?’
Even the simplest most obvious remarks could sound half smart coming from the mouth of John Watson.
'Yes, Tetris and tea is all there is to life.'
When the game found its way to Sherlock's lap the device was already slightly warm.
After another much shorter pause of conversation, the two boys laughed. First Sherlocks short burst of deep laughter followed by a smooth layering of Johns higher more enthusiastic chuckles.
Sherlock felt warm in the face and was now staring at John with a huge smile as they sat next to each other on the carpet.
I looked at his dumbfounded and slightly red face.
Kneeling down beside Sherlock he took the man's hand and looked down at his shirt which had red creeping out behind his black overcoat. He said nothing. Looking at Sherlock's face he could see his eyes start to flutter open.
He left the table and began preparing himself for a visit to the graveyard.
On the subject of friendship, today was a very special day indeed. John had invited me to his rugby match. The previous two times had been random and for my own personal interest of observing John Watson. This time was at John's personal request and I think I was going to rather enjoy the experience.
Realizing I was frozen at the front of the room I moved robotically towards my desk. I sat. Facing the front of the room. I felt guilty for pretending he did not exist.
A tired Sherlock walked to where John sat and planted a kiss on his head as he wrapped an arm around Johns shoulder, leaning over from a standing position for a quick morning embrace.
'Ya?'
‘What?’
'Ok guys. We're going to take up page 243 questions 1-3. I don't see why any of you didn't finish, it wasn't that much..'
Ever since Sherlocks forced withdrawal from crime scenes and overall recent dissociation with life in general, John had been attempting to get Sherlock to try doing things. Anything.
It was a weekend evening in London. That time of day that wasn't afternoon and most definitely not night. It was a weekend, so John had not been to work that day but for some reason, he was feeling drained of energy.
'Mrs. Hudson? No. Why would I have a chair reserved for someone for which I have nothing to talk about that cant be said in a 5-second chit chat while standing?'
John seemed perfectly at peace with this statement he had just conjured from his own mind a spat to the floor for all to see. Sherlock was not.
After dressing himself and entering into the living room, Sherlock was welcomed by one of Johns smiles. He felt like a toddler being praised by its mum after getting themselves dressed for the first time. He should feel insulted but he accepts the glowing smile and mirrors it back.
Sherlock lay on the sofa looking up at the ceiling. After being banned from 'every crime scene on the face of the earth', as put in the dramatic words of detective Lestrade, his world had become a dark patch of boredom.
When they got to the car, John removed the keys from his pocket and gave them to Sherlock. In the lighting of the car park, Sherlocks uncombed hair was again visible. John had forgotten about it on the short walk, the suns rays had distracted his eyes.
The overwhelming feeling of what Sherlock thought was pure boredom came back full force and continued eroding his organs as the laptop which was now hot from use heated his legs.
‘Sherlock’.
'Yes please.'
'Don't you hear the sounds of the keyboard?'
John had always known Sherlock lacked a certain ability to see life through truly optimistic lenses. They shared some bloody wonderful years together but now a wave was coming to retrieve Sherlock back to the dark, where John had found him, and his fear was-the sea that sent this wave was too strong to be fought against.
The experience was nice but by the end of the day, the two men found peace in the fabric of their own chairs.
What I wanted more than anything was a relationship with him. A friendship of sorts I suppose. Unfortunately it was true, I didn't know how.
Sherlock stared at the boy with blonde hair. He wasn’t supposed to be here. It was 10:00 in the morning. The time which was soon to be followed by lunch and recces. This was when the boy went to talk to the girl with dark red pigtails, after participating in a playful wrestling match with some of the other boys. Sherlock stared at the boy in front of him now with unmoving eyes and an unmoving posture to match which might have put others off but did not the boy that was in front of him now.
A good kick sent the rock flying up ahead and on the walking path of John.
With his puzzle book on the side table next to him, he watched his most challenging puzzle stumble out from the bedroom.
It was a whispered shout equivalent to normal volumed talking.
After the ritual of morning tea, he would venture to the living room where he could read a newspaper or try his hand at a crossword. He also had a bunch of new word search books.
And he really was concerned with the questions coming out of the tall mans mouth.
"Now it's only fair I get to feed you."
It's not like I am confessing deep love for the gentleman in sweaters. Simply, I had yet to know what I felt and there was no need to take a beating from some heterosexual, white kid for coming across as homosexual.
Every day I was constantly bombarded with posters promoting our schools' gay-straight alliance. It was complete bullshit. I felt no need to join a group of people with different sexual orientations meeting up weekly.
They had been a Christmas gift from Molly after she confused his interest in writing words for finding words.
In the mornings John nestled into Sherlocks chair so he could see when Sherlock exited the bedroom which left the man with curly hair to sit in what had come to be known as Johns chair.
Red was bleeding through Sherlock's sharp white shirt.
It is the minutes between each class that causes my palms to sweat. Crowds of people walking in every which way.
They're standing on the street waiting for a cab to take them home.
John glanced up and back at his screen in an instant.
'Sherlock, I'm going to boil some tea water now. Did you want to try your luck?' He said, gesturing to the laptop.
When John sat next to him on the carpet Sherlock picked up on a scent. It was the smell of alcohol lingering on the smaller boys clothes but the curly haired child who now sat cross legged on the floor, mistook it for a special kind of cologne.
Sherlock's heart did one single faster and slightly stronger beat against his chest like a drummer hitting a drum one time for his entire performance. He had finally caught a glimpse of Johns wedding ring staring back at him. It was something he might never get used to seeing.
A long pause rang clear.
John set his almost done puzzle aside devoting all his attention to his tea. The cup warmed his hands and the liquid warmed his inside.
Sherlock let his head fall back into Johns neck.
He rolled his eyes, proceeding to drop his hands from a confident steepled position at his soft mouth to an unsure, thrown overboard position as one hand landed to his side and the other dropped off the couch completely, as it was now dangling right above the floor. Sherlock tilted his head from his resting position to look at the one thing that could medicate him-the sunny face of John Watson.
Mr Lull started to talk. 'As I mentioned yesterday our new student is coming today.' I immediately turned to look at our teacher. I turned back to the board as quickly as I had turned away. I started to panic on the inside as I kept writing mindlessly on the board. All this meant was one more person. One more set of eyes when I answered questions on the board. 29 pairs of eyes.
'Ok'. He said. The nod he gave earlier apparently wasn't an adequate confirmation of Johns plan to visit Mycroft.
Once I got passed the busy roads and entered the more quite areas of the walk, I tried my best to just put my hands in the deep pockets of my overworn coat and 'pretend' to not care about anything in the world. Just one lanky leg in front of the other, and an unforced frown as I looked at the sidewalk ahead, until I reached my destination.
Sherlock nodded.
Sherlock began tapping his hands against Johns chairs arm rests. What did he want for breakfast? It was a question he was faced with every morning but the sleepiness of the hour made it seem like a new question every time.
'Ah. You're kidding me.'
'Yes?'
The boy stopped and sat straight up looking at me. I rolled my eyes casually and hopefully this action wasn't visible to the newcomer.
‘Thanks I’ll just take my napkin back’
The two men are standing face to face, a respectable distance between them, in the comfort of the home they have built together.
'I am.'
Sherlock retraced his steps, walking back from where he came, to flop into Johns chair.
The only man Sherlock could imagine sitting in his chair, other than himself, had now gotten up to go to the kitchen. He hadn't even noticed.
But it was John who seemed more surprised.
My completed homework layout on my desk. My pencil in my hand as I tapped it on my right thigh.
John paused his game and changed his body language resting his chin and right side of his face in the palm of his hand leaning forward to look at Sherlock.
The veteran looked to his left to where his best friend lay. Still breathing.
Sherlock jumped up from the floor and ran after his friend. One couldnt stop laughing and the other couldn't stop muttering swear words.
She looked at me through eyes of great color and as I sat with the back of me leaning against the wall, I turned towards her body. She sat on her knees, her dress coming up slightly over her knee caps. Her one hand sat sweetly in her lap and the other sat enclosed in my two pale hands.
It’s become much more than just routine. If the other kids didn’t want to play with him he decided he didn’t want them to. He covered himself with cologne, this time too much. He had masked every part of himself including his natural scent, which was now drowned in cologne, in the new hopes of creating a bubble around him. A way to turn his loneliness into a form of protection from the cruelty of others. Friendships were a foreign concept to him but he wasn’t prepared to let himself get hurt by his fellow classmates.
John let the delicate chin of Sherlock resting on his head temporarily push out any negative thoughts he had about his possible guilty involvement in the death of Sherlock's happiness and willed himself to fall asleep.
‘John’
I smiled one final smile at the smaller boy with the beautiful face before sitting the remaining length of class in silence. I copied the note for the day into my blue notebook and occasionally looked at the boy to my left. John.
Sherlock bursted out laughing still lying on the floor as John began standing up, furiously showing himself out.
Turning a corner around a brick building signalled to the couple that they had nearly reached their destination.
Every day was a pattern, a rut, which was supposed to keep you occupied from the realization that your whole life was one big rut. Math followed by Art. John and Aliya and a need to choose. To choose what - was less obvious to me.
Sherlock looked down at the screen.
With the almost emptied mug in one lap and an almost finished book in the other, they indulged in each other's company. Kissing deeply and feverishly with a certain cry for physical attention, until Sherlock stopped it with a light kiss on John's forehead.
shit shit shit.
John paused. He seemed to be preparing what he was to say next as he slowly stacked blocks one on top of the other. What was said was simple.
Time passes, not a word being said.
The smile was quick and tired but not forced. When it was over he returned to focusing on his own breathing, although he felt Sherlock's breaths were slightly more meaningful and deserved an audience. Watson returned his gaze to the ceiling that was hidden from him behind darkness.
‘John?’
It had been the price of serving in the war that had pulled him from sleep, but it was the psychological war he determined must be invading Sherlock's mind that kept him up.
'Got you.' The detective echoed back sweetly.
'You know I've asked myself the same question and the answer is yes, as far as I'm concerned.'
It was things like this that forced me to question the current relationship between myself and the young man who sat beside me in math class. Unlike Aliya, I saw John every day. He had yet to miss a single class. I admired his timeliness and also like Aliya, admired the way he dressed himself. His sweaters were a staple to his wardrobe. I noticed how strong his arms and back looked and sometimes I couldn't stop noticing.
'John, this whole time your left hand had been lying dead on the table. You mean to tell me you type with one hand?'
As John walked off towards the kitchen, Sherlock began his first game of Tetris in ages.
Is he not feeling fulfilled?
It was clear to me John was who I had my eyes on. Although Aliya still fascinated me, it was John who I wanted to be mine.
Instead he refrains himself from his first instinct and says 'Yeah. I just need to get something quick.'
'Got me.' He said, face going slightly red.
'Huh?'
‘Do you wanna play blocks?’
He lay on the floor waiting for someone to find his body. John Watson was in the other room making sure Janine was ok even though Sherlock had earlier expressed how she would be fine.
A small sigh escaped my thin lips.
It was as if, for one hour each day, we switched personalities. I was more dominant when in fact, quite the opposite was true at all other times. The boy I had grown fond of was a social butterfly and certainly a force to be reckoned with especially when he took to the rugby fields after school.
With every math class and every look at John, I realized more and more the need and want I felt to have his warmth pressing into me. How much I wanted to feel his sweater and skin make contact with my own skin.
John looked around an expression of humour on his face.
Though it was dark and no one was there to witness it John couldn't help but smile.
It was a deduction he was proud of.
'Did you want to drive or did you want me to?'
Around one of these fingers was a ring, he was sure of it. He was the one who had placed it there. After not being able to see the ring from where he was positioned across the room, he protectively lifted his dangling hand from its position in unfamiliar territory, sitting in the air above the floor of 221B. He placed it on his chest hugging the hand with his own wedding band on it. Sometimes he could never be too sure.
The seductive look Sherlock was now piercing John with was more charming than sexual, but still took its desired effect. John felt warmth on the inside that no hot beverage or food could provide.
'Is this it?'
‘Oh god yes’
Yes, he found himself on this couch often with a sense of leading a purposeless life, but after this particularly difficult blow, he found no way of coping.
Bonus:
Sherlock pats his pocket where the single cigarette rests.
'Special treat?' He insists, trying to win Johns approval.
Sherlock remembers this night too and thinks about it as he stares at his now empty chair. The deep black, clean fabric staring sharply back at him.
Sherlock jolted from thought and continued to stare the boy down. He was smaller than him and had a face of slightly rounder shape.
His smile received questioning from Sherlock.
John went into the war with few friends, came out of the war with fewer and by now had no one from the war with whom he considered a friend he could confide in.
Every step he took into the room revealed more of his tall friends body.
Sherlocks hand moved slowly up to John's face as he looked up at the human equivalent to the solar system.
'Wh-what are you doing?'
My mother did not fully discuss with me my want to take an art class but I assumed she was, behind my father's back, glad for me. It's not like it was drama. I know what the kids like to tease boys who take drama for. I'm not completely socially uncomprehending. Just a few paintings, stolen glances towards the girl with pink hair and art would end. No big deal. Mycroft's laughter was also something that I had grown used to.
The war veterans tired eyes smile at the always-a-detective-at-heart's sad eyes.
A couple of kicks of it only landing on his side of the sidewalk before Sherlock explained himself.
Sherlock removed his hand from John's only slightly scruffy face and reached into his right breast pocket of his dress shirt.
'Its whatever you decide.'
‘Oh you cock’
‘I guess that’s a no then?’
John was the first to wake up and make his way to the kitchen for a morning tea alone before a breakfast shared with Sherlock. On weekends the couple slept in for long hours or utilized their time in the bedroom to keep the romance alive. On weekdays, a recently retired John Watson was not yet accustomed to having nowhere to be in the morning.
John left again leaving Sherlocks head to rest on the back of the chair as the smell of french toast started to enter his nose.
The mornings domestic chit chats continued as John opened his mouth.
‘Why do you think I’m here next to you.’
John turns his body slightly towards Sherlock, having had the great idea to feed him.
He took himself and his mug into the bedroom and sat on the bed next to Sherlock, their backs touching the headboard and their legs stretched out in front of them. John never fails to notice how much further Sherlock's thin legs stretch past his own, on top of the covers. They stretch out as if trying to touch the other side of the room.
As John reached for the finished kettle it was time now to make a decision on the kind of tea bag he wanted to reach his mug. The choices were narrowed down to two as the other choices had run out long ago and had yet to be replaced. It was a simple choice that took very little time and thought process to make. Either he reach up and remove a tea bag from the box he usually preferred or reach slightly more to the right to retrieve Sherlock's preferred tea choice. Staring at the options, he used his hand to grab neither option but instead to close the door of the cupboard and in its place open another. The same hand that rejected the tea now reached for a packet of instant porridge.
Is our relationship boring him?
Sherlock's exact whereabouts were unknown, although John assumed he was upstairs. He had heard light footsteps coming from above awhile ago but had not recently heard signs of movement, suggesting Sherlock had now found himself in a seated position.
It was scary at first. The realization I wanted to die. To throw myself off of a building. I often dreamed of the feeling of flying towards the pavement below. My body hitting the ground with a satisfying thud and this would be the end of a very pathetic school boy. Death, of course, was not the only thing I thought about. My mind was racing at most times and It hurt that emotions hardly accompanied these thoughts.
Sherlocks book finds a home on the nearby night table. He now has both the mug and the spoon in his possession and is feeding a quite content, laid back but much more awake John Watson.
And God oh why? Why are there doors to the stairways and why do people feel the need to hold them open for me and why must I always thank them?
‘I don't want to die’
A sweet smile was placed on Johns face but Sherlock saw through to what he viewed as disappointment.
He half expects Sherlock to announce something like 'I'm not a child', or a questioning 'What are you doing?'. Instead he watches Sherlocks face change and his body shift slightly away as John reaches the spoonful of mush up to Sherlock's face.
'John your observation skills do amaze me on a regular basis but Im afraid you have mistaken this rock for a ball.'
'Try my luck? I hardly think Tetris is a game of luck.'
I thought about every stop light and crosswalk long before I reached them. Looking down at the ground to avoid eye contact with drivers and other pedestrians that may pollute the morning streets, and looking at the same time for stupid drivers who didn't know that a red light meant stop was a skill I had mastered. Every time I looked out for those idiot drivers I questioned why I was doing so. It wouldn't be the end of the world to get struck by a car. I thought about this often too. Getting hit by a car. Not quite in the suicidal sense, just in a cracked hip bone, no-school-for-a-couple-of-weeks, sense.
He moved his whole body to the left and nuzzled himself into the taller body of Sherlock Holmes. He heard a grunt escape Sherlock and felt his arm wrap around him.
Once seated he entered a staring contest with the other man. It wasn't direct eye contact or intimidating but it was clear that both men were looking at each other.
Out of seven games he had played I had attended two. By simply attending these games I felt I had learned a lot about John but every minute spent with him I seemed to learn something more about the blonde boy.
What would I even say? Supposing I wanted a relationship with John, what would I have to say? Would I risk a recently attained friendship for a romantic one? I desperately wanted to find someone to love me in return. Logic was telling me there was no merit in a romance. It was just friendship with kissing and hugs. But the more thoughtful part of my mind knew otherwise. Knew it meant more.
Sherlock looked over questioningly.
Sherlock smiled a half smile to match Johns half smile which was really a full smile hidden behind an aged hand attached to an arm enwrapped with a well loved brown jumper.
John kissed Sherlock's cheek.
It was at this point that Sherlock realized John had been crying.
'Is this alright? I'm not sitting in Mrs. Hudson's chair am I?'
‘Ravioli ravioli what's in the pocketoli?’
A hand moved up to cup Sherlock's face as the other one stayed on the coat over the red clothing.
'And does me sitting here make this my chair then or is there a 3-year sitting minimum I'm unaware of?'
Sherlock glanced over.
He could hear footsteps coming now. It was unmistakably John coming closer. His brown shoes moving cautiously. They had just broken into the office of Charles Magnussen and had found Sherlock's supposed love interest injured on the floor. The soldier was brave but maintained in touch with his cautious side.
Sherlock was surprised at the words that fell out of his mouth and into the carpeted area that he now shared with John. It was so natural talking to this stranger.
My desk was one of the few attached to an empty desk. If the new student sat down there... I stopped. The teacher was now talking to a new voice. The voice of a young male. I was done writing. Slowly capping the marker I prayed that when I turn around, the desk beside mine would not contain a new person. Slowly turning around I saw him. He was looking at me. Why was he looking at me?
It was dark in the room as cool night air filled the shared bedroom of Mr. Holmes and Mr. Watson courtesy of an open window.
Perhaps I was jealous that I did not know how I identified. Jealous of everyone who seems to know exactly who they are and what they're supposed to be in life.
John was never a good sleeper. In his younger days, every night brought him back to the war. These days, war was still a plot of some of his dreams but was not an every night affair. He was non the less gifted with a consuming fear of the night.
'So I was thinking,' hesitation as he swallowed his food creation. 'That maybe we could go visit Mycroft today. You know, with Rosie coming home tomorrow and College starting in September we'll be too busy to go for the rest of the month.'
It was math class now. I had made it to second last period. I was a lucky man to know final period was art with Aliya. It was at the expense of my older brothers laughter and my father's disapproval that I had taken an art class. If only they knew it was for the purposes of observing a female interest maybe their male senses would kick in and perhaps congratulate me. Although at this point I had nothing to show for my admiration. Nothing to be congratulated. I was still, at this point, alone. Which didn't bother me as much as one would think it should bother someone in pursuit of love.
John had no intentions of forcing his partner to eat what he had made, but his looking into Sherlock's eyes was hopefully pleading his request for the younger man to try some.
It was tedious work as he maneuvered the cane with him.
Johns smile grew as he disappeared into the car.
'I thought you said you were writing something.'
He was now walking across the room to a Sherlock who was starting to slowly move his thin body into a seated position.
Mr Holmes was enjoying this ever so much but he had made the decision that perhaps he had tortured his friend enough.
It ached him physically, chewing at his heart and stomach.
Both men are now looking at each other, smiling. Everything being forgotten including the tiredness each of them may have been experiencing.
'Nothing.'
Young Sherlock is so proud for his first day of kindergarten and he shows this pride through is decision to freshen up. He finds his way to his fathers bathroom which connects conveniently to his parents bedroom. He has already put a comb through his hair. He loves how his hair looks. Curly and dark. He finds his dad’s cologne and decides to put some on. He is careful not to put too much on. He is aware of how his mother dislikes when his father stinks too greatly of the sometimes overwhelmingly powerful scent.
'Is this all there is to life? Tetris and tea I mean.'
It was past noon and John wasn't an idiot. He could see Sherlock's pajamas under his lengthy housecoat. He knew he had been up to nothing all day.
And with that he had turned his brain fully on, allowing unwelcome thoughts into his head like the open window welcomed air into the flat without questioning its desire to enter.
John giggled as he spoke these words.
A pair of glasses sat on his face. They hadn't been a necessary piece of equipment when they met 23 years ago, but Sherlock had grown accustomed to seeing the glasses while John participated in any activities that required him to look at a screen or read anything he deemed worth reading. John still thought stars and planets were worth his time.
‘You want to be alone too?’
It took effort.
John looked over and slightly up at Sherlock whose expression had softened in the time passed since John had joined him. John doubts he is even reading now. Although his eyes move convincingly across the pages, John figures he's been trying to deduce what has been finding its way from the mug to John's mouth. He probably hasn't been exposed to porridge since he was a child.
'Oh. Right. Ok.'
On the other side of things was Aliya. I saw her most days except the ones where she ditched class, sometimes for weeks at a time. This confused me so because I thought she was in love with art. Maybe she was in love with the idea of art, like I was in love with the idea of a friendship sparking between John and I.
‘You’re not going to die’
John remembered something he had read,
He was in the doorway now.
'Ready.'
Sherlock felt Johns smaller chest and arms wrap itself around his shoulders and upper back and leaned into it.
He read the instructions on the back as he ripped open the packet at the top. He smiled a tired, half sided smile. When he was a soldier on duty he heard a bunch of Americans refer to the stuff as oatmeal.
Sherlock smirked finding his own attempt at humour rather funny.
I would not define it as obsessing over her but I did think of Aliya often. Laying next to me in bed in the mornings after I woke up was just one of the less forgiving places of which I thought.
'See if you can beat my high score.'
'Ok'.
It doesn't take a detective to notice Sherlock is reading something. It appears, by the lack of a creative cover and the way Sherlock is holding it so intently to his eye level, to be a book of non-fiction work.
When the inexperienced instant oatmeal maker was convinced that he had followed the step by step instructions to the best of his ability, and was satisfied that a mush of what appeared to be oatmeal now sat in the bottom of his mug where once sat dry oats, he decided to join his flatmate upstairs. On his way, almost forgetting a spoon.
Sherlock chews slowly and swallows before taking the spoon out of the hands of an unsuspecting John.
‘I don’t think you’ll ever be alone. John.’
‘John’
He wasn't sure if he should talk to Sherlock in the morning about his concern for his mental health. Any talk of emotion or sign of concern might prematurely push him off the edge from where he was presumably standing.
Here I was again thinking about two people at once. Two people with wonderful souls. I felt an urgent need to choose. It was this urge that was driving me crazy. It's not like I would have to choose. Having to choose would imply both were romantically interested in me, which was not the case.
John realizes his mug is emptying quickly and begins now to play with its mushy, remaining contents.
Johns questioning of his own role in Sherlock's misery brought himself to deep waters. He was sure Sherlock was happy with him but couldn't help being concerned that his partner had recently been wearing a deep shade of sadness that was becoming visible and showed no sign of being shaken off anytime soon.
To me, the worst part of school was getting there. The long walk that awaited me every morning. The people. The cars driving by. It was all very hateful.
No matter how many times Sherlock assures him he wouldn't be bothered by Johns interjections as he read, John rarely bothers the man when he reads. Instead, he looks down at the contents of the mug.
“Well, I guess rugby could be considered a hobby of mine. It's relaxing, the physicality of it all. Great way to let off steam.” John paused, and Sherlock looked up to see him smiling and staring off in the distance. “ I also like to study and read up on medical discoveries and techniques.” He continued, pointing to the books on his self. “Those medical books were given to me by my grandfather last Christmas. They are the most up to date books he could find on medical practices and techniques. It’s fascinating, Sherlock. The way the body works, the way it can heal itself. It’s just-ugh I can't explain it. It’s just amazing.”
“I play video games or watch movies, as simple as the sounds.”
"Sorry I'm late, I couldn't find the class."
Sherlock complies after stealing another cookie from the plate. John laughs, clipping it short as he takes the offered wrist. He takes an alcohol pad from the bag and swipes up and down his arm cleaning up the dried blood.
“It makes it to where you can’t ask a question you don’t want to share, smart, I like it. Shall you start or I?”
He sighed loudly, and heard Sherlock shift and mumble incoherently beneath him.
"Oh. Umm...I am the youngest of two siblings. I do have an older sibling who attends Uni: Harry. My parents are happily married, and do travel a lot. Harry is a recovering alcoholic in an on again off again relationship with girlfriend Clara. I am interested in becoming a doctor once school is done and am hoping to get a rugby scholarship."
"My brother and I make a game of it," Sherlock says cooly.
Sherlock winced at the sound, which jolted his brother into action. Sliding to his knees besides his young brother he began to speak.
'God he's beautiful...' John shakes the thought from his head. No time for that.
“You don’t have to answer if you don’t want-“
"And that's...?"
“Anxiety gone?”� John asks seeing Sherlock’s chest rise and fall regularly.
‘Better now than never to think about what you saw. What you heard.’ He thought somberly. His mind traveled back to what he saw in the bathroom. Sherlock, knees to his chest, eyes blown wide with fear at some unknown scene in his head.
"I see my brother has taken to you, John," Mycroft says as he takes John's offered hand. "Do not let it be misplaced."
Thirty minutes came and went and John answered the knock of the door, gathering the food and setting out plates around the styrofoam boxes. His mouth watered as he got a whiff of the egg rolls.
John scratched the back of his head. “I...experimented over the summer when I wasn’t watching movies. Realized I didn’t quite care who I was with as long as I liked them.” John answered blushing slightly.
“It’s...it’s simple music theory.” He explained, still looking at John. “Once you understand the way music works, the way notes are meant to be played, putting them together is all up to the imagination. The possibilities are endless.” He finished.
" m'sorry..."
John hung up the phone, and sighed. He ran his hands over his face and looked at the kitchen clock. The digital numbers gleamed back at it him, the neon lights telling him it was nearly eight o’clock. He heard the water turn on and smiled.
"You're of them but not them."
"Excuse me?"
"Sectoral heterochromia."
"Why'd you protect me? Why did you pick my books up? Why are you talking to me? You must have heard what they say about me. I'm a freak. Useless," Sherlock mumbles through the tears John notices Sherlock ha begun trembling.
"John! What-" Sherlock's startled words are cut off by John.
“I can teach you if you want.” Sherlock replied sincerely.
“No need to thank me mate.”John says as he accepts the out stretched hand. “Shit, you’re bleeding!”he murmurs eyeing his arm.
"So I see your parents have gotten that divorce after your father's affair with his secretary."
"William Sherlock Scott Holmes! I will not have you blaming yourself for this. I would not be here with you if I did not choose it."
"Hey. Are you okay?" John asks afraid he's the one who had frightened Sherlock.
“I can’t wait.”
"First period," He says while nodding, before following his brother's exit.
“I didn’t. It was all we had in the kitchen," John says as he watches Sherlock eat two more cookies like a starving man. A thought strikes him, and fearful of the answer, John finds himself asking: "When was the last you ate?"
“You’re sure your current opinion of me won’t change if I answer honestly?”
Silence echoed between them for a moment, before John nodded. Seemed that was all he was gonna get out of Sherlock tonight, and he’d rather not pry. He’d tell John when he was ready, or never, and he was okay with either. He opened the styrofoam box in front of him.
“Yeah. Unless...you don’t want...” John says looking around unnerved.
John smiles. 'At least the teacher is nice,' John thinks.
“Is your family not filled with government officials?” Sherlock mocked. “I thought it was normal.” He finished aiming for a joke.
“Keep drinking-oh! There’s snacks too. I want you to eat. I’m going to get the med kit and clean your wrists.” He says as he stands up. Sherlock only nods.
“Well, I did skip a year, John.” He reminded him.
“mhmmm, John?” Sherlock asks blinking up as John leans him against the couch.
“Nah mate, seems your the lucky one.”
“Are you religious?”
"Sherlock it's highschool , not jail. It will not kill you to go. There are no more Private Professors. Every Professor sent to the house, you've managed to run off, and the others are afraid to try. Now please, Sherlock, go to school."
Sherlock nods. "Last Saturday. My brother made me eat dinner." He answers.
“Yeah. Yeah, I can see that.” He replied running his hand across his face. “Well, I don’t think I can top your family.”
“You seemed to have opened up a few of the newer ones. Doesn’t look to bad. Need to clean and wrap it though to fight infection. Nothing I can’t do at home.”John says while rolling his sleeve back down.
John smiles again and leans against his locker. Sherlock looks at him. Up close John is really quiet handsome.
"I've been meaning to ask, who's Bond?" Sherlock asks a he points to John's collection of "James Bond" movies.
Mycroft said sounding worried. He had tried his hardest to keep the irritation out of his features. The next thing he needed was Sherlock blaming himself. He turned his mind away from that train of thought, not wanting to relive the moment he found Sherlock curled up in the bathtub, wrist a mangled mess, all because he had told the younger boy he had made him late to a meeting that could potentially lead to him loosing his job. No. Not that again.
Sherlock followed.
Sherlock looks up sharply at John and searches his face again before smiling shyly.
'No. Stop. Delete, delete, DELETE. Don't think about him here. You can't, you have to try and make this work. You can pretended to be normal.' Without noticing it, Sherlock found himself rubbing the scars on his left wrist with his dominant thumb. He has scars up and down both arms, but the ones on his left arm are deeper due to....
John felt a chill go through him. 'One protective big brother, check.'
Sherlock looks down noticing the red seeping through his long sleeve shirt.
‘Right now. It’s time for sleep.’ He thought as he rolled on to his belly.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"Well I find it creepy that your brother knows that you're here, but I don't mind you staying the night. Harry's at her girlfriend's and my parents are out traveling, it will just be us. I'm sure I have some extra blankets..." John stops and looks up at Sherlock. "If it's cool with you,that is."
"Leave him alone, Troy," John says pushing off his locker to stand in front of Sherlock.
"Really? That's not what people usually say. Or how they react." the last part is mumbled, as if he had spoke a thought out-loud.
“Two rehab trips and twice as many relapses says otherwise,” John replied sighing. “But it’s still something to hope for.” He smiled at Sherlock as he finished.
“No, no, no, keep your head down and breathe.”
Instead of answering, Sherlock silently rises to his feet and offers John his hand.
“M’sorry, John. I can leave if you want. You,”� Sherlock gulped. “can forget we ever met. And we can go back to being-“
“Starving, hope you got soy sauce.” Sherlock replied taking the offered food and biting into it.
Hey loves! Just a small update to let you know what is going on! I’ve been struggling with things in my life for the last few weeks and have been trying to take care of it all. I haven’t abandoned this story at all so don’t worry! I hope to write the next chapter soon once my life isn’t so hectic. Love you all.  Hope to post soon
“What was that?” He questioned, eyeing the bright pink blanket and grey pillow the blonde was holding.
“Okay, well good. So how I was thinking it would go would be one of us asks a question one answers and then you have to answer your own question. What do you think”
John H. Watson has the high school career that every boy dreams of. All of his teachers love him, and being the captain of the school's rugby team gained him mass popularity. All the girls in the school want to shag him; all the boys want to be him. As if that isn't enough, John is friendly to everyone he meets (as long as he is treated with respect, that is). All in all, he's the modern day highschool jock they have so often depicted in movies.
He looked down at his hands. The same hands that had cleaned... he gulped...that had cleaned Sherlock’s suicide attempt wound.
"Mycroft," Sherlock says with what John could have sworn was gratitude.
"Who was that?"
"Hey, Freak! Heard you came back this year, didn't think it was true though," Troy Glosner says walking up to where he and John are standing.
But that’s not what caught his attention. No. What made him stop cold in his tracks and sent ice through his veins was how he was able to count every rib on his body. Spinal notches visible through thin skin, the stark whiteness only disturbed by what seemed like cigarette burns.
“Movies I guess would be another hobby of mine.” John said, seeming to not have heard the younger boy. “I watched the entire collection of Bond films over the summer, spent half the time analyzing the filming techniques. I guess that’s about all I’m really interested in though.” John finished, finally looking at Sherlock.
“First game if you want too. The season starts soon. I’ll let you know the schedule when I get it. Ah! Home sweet home!” John exclaims as they get to a little robin blue house in the suburbs of London. Sherlock watches him struggle with the lock and key before he unlocks the door. He enters and looks back at him. “You commin?”
He gasped as pain flooded his body, making him drop the scalpel on the bloody bathtub tile. He keened as he looked at his arm, blackness edging in the corners of his vision. He could no longer see the paleness of his skin. All he saw was the beautiful waterfall of crimson.
“You can say that again.”
Troy froze. "You fucking freak." He snarls under his breath before he shoves Sherlock into the lockers and grabs him by his jacket. Sherlock cannot hold in his small wine as Troy leans in.
John cut him off.
"Hey! Would you look at that? We're locker buddies!"
The boy looks startled by the question.
“Your nothing but a goddamn freak, you know that? I wanted you fucking aborted as soon as your Mother found out, but heavens to Betsy she had a fit about that. So here you are. Long limbs and curly haired, barley able to speak beyond stuttering, and being a goddamn pain in my side,” His belt dinged as the buckle hit the floor, and he folded it once upon itself.
"It doesn't look too bad. Just opened the scabs. You worried me; that was a lot of blood. Thought you nicked a vein." Sherlock remains quiet as John wraps his wrist in gauze. "Keep that on overnight."
“That’s that then. Stay seated. I’m going to get you some food and grab the medical supplies from the bathroom. Your wrist still seems to be bleeding.” John says as he strides from the couch. John walks into the kitchen then promptly begins making tea. It’s a habit John had picked up from his father. “Tea solve most of life’s problems, Johnny Boy.” his father’s voice rings in his head. While the water gets hot he prepares a plate of chocolate cookies and a bag of crisps. When he finishes he hears the distinct click of the water boiler going off, signaling the water was ready.
“Oh, don’t be boring, Asta,” Atalanta admonished her.
The look John shot him was both curious and hopeful.  “Who was the first?”
“Not a word,” Mike replied awkwardly.
The crack of the riding crop striking flesh was loud and made her flinch even from the observation room.  It was hard not to admire him, even when he was violently flogging a corpse.  Nero watched sadly from her shoulder and she brought a hand up and stroked her fingertips along his spine.
Sherlock glanced at his daemon as he snapped the phone shut.  Atalanta was looking back, approval written in her smug expression.  It seemed John was not so plain after all.
“There’s no link been found
The ex-army doctor pulled a mobile out of his back pocket, holding it out to him.  “Er, here…use mine.”
Kato’s rumbling purr filled the room, claws kneading into John’s bare leg as dexterous fingers scratched into his spotted fur just so.  John knew there would be faint scratch marks in his thigh come morning, but he could not drag up enough will to care.  Drawing silent comfort from each other, there was no need for words as they sat together in the darkened room.  There would be no more sleeping that night.
“Problem?” Atalanta inquired smugly.
“That man is infuriating,” Greg replied, not quite collapsing into his chair as he ruffled through the case file of the last suicide.
“Doesn’t mean you weren’t impressed,” Danae countered.  Greg turned to her and fixed her with a glare.  His daemon met it with her own steady gaze and the detective soon turned away in defeat.  She was right, of course.  “So…are we going?”
The screen turned on and he turned to his laptop to keep from saying anything he would regret.  The page for his blog filled the monitor, blank as the day he had started it nearly two months ago.  He rested his hands on the keys but no words came to him, just like yesterday and the day before that.  Snapping the lid closed in anger, he huffed silently as it would appear that it would remain blank for yet another day.
“Really?” He sounded surprised, walking back to the microscope.  “I thought it was a big improvement.”
“Afghanistan or Iraq?” Sherlock asked quickly, examining the phone and drawing ‘John’s’ attention away from Atalanta’s scrutiny of his daemon.  Societal norms would not let him examine another’s daemons; there is nothing against daemons scrutinizing each other.  It is considered rude, but not taboo.
Large paws, seemingly disproportionate to his small stocky body, padded over the sheets his extended claws catching on the material.  Pressing his wet nose into John’s cheek, his human was pulled violently into the waking world.  Sitting up with a heaving gasp, Kato nearly tumbled from the bed, cursing softly as he tried to pull his claws from the comforter without shredding it.
“I dunno,” he shrugged, cradling his foam cup to warm his fingers.  The weather was surprisingly chilly for the time of year.  “Maybe get a flatshare or something?”
No one was surprised when she settled as an English Springer Spaniel.  The Watson family had always had canine dæmons, aside from the occasional fox (and the estranged Great Uncle Charlus Watson who no one talked about as his dæmon settled as a wolf).  It was unseemly and never discussed in polite company.
It made them worry but Adelyn never pursued the issue.  Later, when both her sons were older, she would regret that decision.  But at that moment, she had been comforted by the knowledge that Sherlock was closer to Mycroft then herself and thought that perhaps they were just getting to old for such affectionate gestures from parents.
“We’ve only just met and we’re gonna go and look at a flat?”
When John and Kato were twelve, Harriett and Titus dropped out of school.  Bobby did not notice, he did not notice a lot anymore.  Harriett drank like her father and moved in with her girlfriend.  John and Kato were left alone to deal with their family that was slowly but surely falling apart.  Bobby rarely left the house anymore and Marah could be found most days staring listlessly into the fire place, eyes glazed as her human drank himself from one drunken stupor to the next.
“It will be alright, Nero,” Molly told him softly in a comforting tone.  It was hard though, when she desired the man so, and yet his daemon could not be more disinterested and cold if she had tried.  Atalanta made it seem so effortless, the way she ignored Nero and every other daemon they met.
“Come on,” John bit out, smiling ruefully.  “Who’d want
The trip went well for just over a month and then disaster struck.
Mike turned and he felt a smile break across his face at the sight of his old classmate.  There was no mistaking John’s daemon for any other, a strange curiosity for a man who was as normal and laid back as any he had ever known.  “John, John Watson!” He saw the man pause and turn to them.  Mike heaved himself from the bench and Asta bounded after him as he made his way over.  “Stamford, Mike Stamford,” he supplied as John gave him a confused look.  “We were at Bart’s together.”
John glanced at him, surprised that Mike remembered his sibling.  His throat burned as he replied bitterly, “Yeah, like that’s gonna happen!”
The storm that had caught them by surprise had come out of nowhere, and in seconds Harriett and John were obscured behind a thick downpour of rain.
John broke his stare with Atalanta, gazing at Sherlock in confusion, but it was not he who answered.  “We don’t feel one way or the other,” a distinctly male voice replied and Sherlock turned to John’s daemon, John’s
Adelyn thought it curious that Atalanta addressed Mycroft just as often as Sherlock engaged Erimentha.  She often heard her eldest explaining that it was improper and then her youngest would comment disdainfully and ignore him completely.  Though never done in polite society, she did not think long upon it as she knew that her youngest adored his brother.
“Is that it?” John’s question halted them before the door.
Sherlock and Atalanta did not seem to know what to make of it.  Having spent much time alone they were baffled by the presence of their parents.  Mycroft seemed amused by it mostly.  Erimentha perched on his shoulder with a smug look of indifference upon her bird face as they watched their younger brother and his dæmon struggle to cope with the affection being forced upon them by both parents.
Atalanta turned to Sherlock, bored with the turn the conversation took.  Grabbing his own mobile and checking for a signal, the detective continued as if no one had spoken at all.  “We’ve got our eye on a nice little place in central London.  Together we ought to be able to afford it.”
Undeterred by how bored he sounded she gazed into his gorgeous blue eyes and tried again.  “I was wondering if you’d like to have coffee.”
Asta sat on the furthest end of the bench, pressed between the side arm and human’s thigh.  She was sulking, and aside from the hand resting comfortingly on her back, Mike was ignoring her.  John and Kato had always been an odd pair, and he remembered how Asta would bemoan about Kato’s stand-offish ways.  The clouded leopard had always been polite, but he rarely interacted with other daemons and fighting in a war clearly had not changed that.  Now only if Asta would stop whining about it.
Mike grinned, releasing his hand as he gestured to himself.  “Yeah, I know.  I got fat!”
“You shouldn’t call her that,” Kato replied sourly, extending his body so he could prop his paws onto the arm of the chair.  He liked the psychiatric appointments even less than his human.  “She doesn’t like it…and no, you promised that we would go to the park today.”
Recognition lit up his face and John smiled as he took Mike’s offered hand to shake it.  “Yes, sorry, Mike.  Hello, hi.”
“She’s so pretty,” Nero mumbled softly.  Molly nodded in agreement, but she was not looking at the daemon.  “Her fur is so white…it looks really soft.  Do you think-”
Sherlock studied them intently, eyes darting between man and daemon as the endured the scrutiny as only soldiers can: unflinching and unyielding.  “I know you’re an army doctor,” Sherlock began, tone smug as Atalanta stood taller, tail flicking in a haughty way.  “And you’ve been invalided home from Afghanistan.  I know you’ve got a brother who’s worried about you, but you won’t go to him for help because you don’t approve of him – possibly because he’s an alcoholic, more likely because he recently walked out on his wife.  And I know your therapist thinks your limp’s psychosomatic – quite correctly, I’m afraid.”
“So, bad day was it?” She joked, but it fell short as the man did not even acknowledge her attempt at playful banter.
“Just to the shrink’s office across the courtyard,” his voice was dry and held a note of derision as he sat at the small desk, leaning his cane against the chair.
Looking at them now, Bobby and Marah debated this fact with a heavy heart.  John and Kato may have survived the jungle, but not all of them came back from it.  Something was missing from the both of them, and it left the boys a little less.
Donovan nearly threw her phone down as Tharin became absolutely still.  Danae looked over in concern, neck outstretched as she lightly touched the hare with her nose.  At the contact, Tharin relaxed, ears twitching, and Donovan’s hand unclenched.  “If you’ve got texts please ignore them.”
“I don’t even know her,” she replied, laying her head on her giant paws as she gazed out of the office door.  “We’ve known them for four years, Greg, and in all that time Atalanta has only talked to me once.”
“Detectives Inspector, how can suicides be linked?”
What followed felt like a three ringed circus.  His semi not-answer was followed by a question.  Greg socially blundered and spent the next minute trying to back track before the text alerts drowned out the response.  When his mobile buzzed after everyone else, he grabbed it while Donovan wrapped up the interview.
The heavy rain created flashfloods and landslides.  Eight went missing in the initial chaos, three were found almost immediately after they had regrouped.  Their guide had dragged them back to the visitor’s center where Bobby and Marah found themselves alone.  He had been so sure Katelyn had been next to him, but in the initial chaos she had run after the kids, Varro soaked and clutched to her chest as she stumbled though the underbrush.  It had only taken a second, and then he had lost sight of her completely.
"I'm so sorry Sherlock."
"What?"
“Oh John, really I’m full you don’t need too-“ he was cut off from his excuse by John holding up a finger.
In front of him, Sherlock sat with his knees drawn to his chest, arms locked in front. Green eyes peered out at him from a dark forest.
Anyway dolls! Please enjoy this chapter, and like always feel free to comment or leave a kudo!!
“Not really. I identify as agnostic.” Sherlock replied, stretching.
“Freak, queer, sociopath...”he rambled to himself as his hands pounded his skull trying to quiet the storm inside. He had not thought of that specific memory in months and his knees ached with memory of the pain.
Startled, John sits down next to Sherlock who still has his head tucked away.
Sherlock sits up and looks at John for a moment.
“Well John, what are you planning here?” He questioned out loud.
“Okay, okay that’s all right. Just breathe.” Sherlock finds himself pulling his knees to his chest and wrapping his arms around his legs. He puts his head on his knees and breathes deep.
He sank down against the door and let what he saw sink in.
“Good for nothing freak. You even scare your nannies! No wonder no one in school wants to be friends with a stuttering idiot like you.” His father taunted.
“You’ve never had a friend before? Ever?”
“No, no it’s fine. A bit unexpected but...”John seemed to understand what Sherlock can’t say and nods.
Somehow, he knew Sherlock had been brought back to a childhood trauma. Child abuse, it had to be from the way he spoke of his father.
“Eighteen.”
‘Maybe...I should go and check up on him?’ His mind questioned.
“Well?!” John questioned again.
“I’m aware that you have questions, John.
“Fine. Since you, like my brother are so determined to get “meat on my bones” “, he raised his fingers to indicate the quoting, “Chinese food sounds nice.” He finished, lowering his hands back down.
“Whatsyourfavoriteseason.” He sputtered trying to hide his nervousness.
He walked down to the kitchen and sat down at a chair. Sherlock followed not five minutes later, still damp. He sat down and faced John, hands folded under his chin.
“Oh Sherlock, no.” Mycroft cried, collecting his trembling frame into his arms. “No, don’t let fathers words get to you.” He cooed as Sherlock sobbed into his jumper. “Come now,” He said looking at the bloody mess of Sherlocks knees not minding the blood seeping into his jummper. “Let’s get you washed up, yeah? Maybe play Pirates before bed?” Getting no response from the trembling mess in his arms, he stood up, and proceeded to walk up the stairs humming a lullaby to try and soothe the ache in the young boys heart.
"My, don't. John's not a goldfish," Sherlock says softly looking at his brother. The brothers share a look John cannot figure out. They must have had a conversation like this before because Mycroft nods before turning and saying, "I'll be in the car. Don't be long."
"I was trying too." Sherlock mumbles.
'Yeah, I've watched waaaayyy to many Bond movies.'
“No...one..to..call” �Sherlock gasped.
“Egg roll?” He offered.
"Here. We should probably get off the floor," John says as he heaves himself up and reaches a hand down to Sherlock. Sherlock tentatively takes his offered hand and lets himself be pulled up.
“Fucking cry baby.” His father laughed, as he forcefully tore Sherlock from the wall and slammed his hands and knees into the broken class littered on the floor.
“How’d you know chocolate was my favorite?”Sherlock mumbles as he stuffs another in his mouth.
Sherlock scurried to find a way to clean his mess, his year two mind scrambling. But he was too late. He felt the unkind hands of his father grab him by his nape, and slam him into the wall.
" I don't know what's happened in your life, but to see how it's affected you. God whatever hell you've been through to make you-I'm so sorry, Sherlock." John says suppressing a sob as he grabs the boy's shoulders, looking him in the eyes. The eyes that meet his shift in color and he finds that he can't look away.
“At home?” Sherlock asks confused.
"Friday."
"Most people would be trying to fix me. Say that I'm broken; that I need to be fixed. But you..."
“No. I’ve had plently of those,” Sherlock replies more calm now that his breathing was regular again. He turns his head and looks at John. “A friend.”
“If I have any say in it, I will.” his brother said defiantly, staring dead straight into eyes that so matched his own. Oh how he hated the resemblance he had with his father.
‘Quick, clean, smooth.’ His mind thought as he traced his finger over the blade.
“What?”
...........……........................................................
‘Make it go away, gotta make it go away, make it quiet again’ his mind continued to ramble as he shakily got to his feet. He walked to his bed and without thinking flipped over his pillow and grabbed the scalpel hidden there.
Sherlock says nothing but lifts his head to gaze at John with tear-rimmed eyes. John cannot decipher what the celestial-eyed boy sees, but assumed it is good by the way Sherlock cracks a smile.
“What do you fancy for dinner, Sherlock?”
"Uh. What?"
Sherlock’s heart sped up. ‘Damn it. Not now.’ He said scolding himself for blushing.
Sherlock caught the bedding and looked down at it. The bright pink was almost blinding. He had always liked the color pink. “It’s...good John. Thank you.” He replies with a smile.
John sucked in a breath and looked down. “Eh...yeah so,” he looked around and Sherlock noticed a slight blush on his cheeks. That was odd. ‘Must collect more data’ he quickly thought before John continued.
‘How’d his mother die...’  he thought. He quickly pushed away the thoughts flooding his mind on that subject.
“I guess playing my violin could also be considered a hobby.” He chimed. “You should see it, John. Vintage, German-made circa 1880. Made from well-flamed maple with a fine belly grain, varnished in orangey brown. It’s beautiful.” He paused. “It was my mother’s. It got passed down to me.” He finished his thought quietly.
“I mean,” John scratches the back of his neck, and Sherlock can’t help but notice his shirt rise up just a bit exposing the light abs on his stomach. “Well yeah. That’s what friends do right? They learn about each other.”
“Yeah, I’ve got you. You were feeling dizzy on the couch and you fell.”He stands up and walks quickly to the kitchen, bypassing the tea opting to get a water bottle from the fridge and the plate of snacks. He enters the living room to find Sherlock picking at his bleeding wrist.
“Your mouth’s too small now,” Atalanta informed her and Molly flushed crimson, visibly fighting not to look at the daemon as she fidgeted uncomfortably.  It was considered rude to do more than glance at another’s daemon, ruder still to talk to one that was not your own or your significant other’s.  Even then there were rules and protocols, tedious things neither he nor Atalanta paid much mind too.  John seemed to be of the same mindset because he was looking directly at Sherlock’s daemon and giving her a pointed look.  His expression clearly stating he thought she was being impolite.
“Yeah, well, just ignore that,” Sally did not quite snap at the balding man.  “Okay, if there are no more questions for Detective Inspector Lestrade, I’m going to bring this session to an end.”
“Just in,” she replied, moving over to the table as the man sniffed the corpse.  “Sixty-seven, natural causes…” she trailed off as Nero darted down her arm and onto the table.  The tiny gecko made its way over to the other daemon while being careful to stay clear of the humans, both Sherlock and the corpse.
He huffed in annoyance, part from the question and part from the emotions he was picking up from his dæmon.  Edmur had approached Kato slowly, like he had every time they had an appointment.  Stopping just shy of touching, the caracal stretched his nose forward in greeting.
