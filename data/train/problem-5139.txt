“You got me whiskey for my birthday?” Dean raises his eyebrows and inspected the newly bought bottle in his hands, “And you tell me I have a drinking problem?”
Sam looked down and went to set next to Dean, why would he think this made Sam upset?
Sam chuckled and shook his head, “happy birthday Dean.”
“Dean, I’m sorry for asking.” Sams was almost at a whisper, god he regretted asking now.
“Sam, please.” Deans voice broke “you don’t wanna know why.”
imagine.”
Sam at this point was laughing to near tears, “He was so pissed off but you were more drunk than I’ve ever seen you and dad thought it funny how you tried to hide it.”
It was Deans 39th birthday, Cas was out doing Chuck only knows what. Sam had just gotten back to the bunker with a cherry pie, a six pack of whatever beer was the cheapest and a new bottle of Tennessee Whisky. The bunker smelled of pizza and a hint of old spice which meant dean was out of the long needed shower and Sam had gotten back just in time. He hurried down the stairs and placed everything on the map table and the whiskey under it.
It took them about an hour or so to finally get the bottle drank and the both of them to become somewhat tipsy, like it was the first time they drank whiskey. Sam was slouched with his head tipped back over the chair he was in and Deans was on the table, Sam was a bit of a lightweight and Dean was the one to hold his liquor but tonight the awful beers plus the whiskey had them more than they’d like to say. Sam brought his head forwards and cleared his throat making Dean look up.
“And-and what do you mean by it changed you?”
“I was worried you’d get drunk then dad would have gotten pissed at me.” Deans smile falters slightly, Sam noticed how his whole demeanor changed after that, he wasn’t as lose as before, he felt vulnerable Sam could tell in his face.
Sam couldn’t say anything, he didn’t know what to say. It all made sense to him though. How every time that Dean would get back with their dad he would just stand outside the motel room for hours drinking. He started smoking a little while after that. It also makes more sense now that Dean flirts with every woman he sees weather it’s a bartender or police officer.
“Your birthday present. That I might have forgotten about.” He reached under the table and slid the bottle to him nearly knocking the empty beer bottles off the table.
Dean smiled and rolled his eyes, “yeah?”
“Dean, look,” Sam reached his arm across the table but Dean leaned back and quickly taking both hands with him, whipping his eyes with one and running the other through his hair, with a labored breath he looked across at Sam and weakly smiled.
Deans head was in his hands, “Sam, does this not bother you?”
That was something he didn’t expect.
“I didn’t know why he wanted me to go with him until he sat me down at a bar and told me to go and talk to this man.” Dean was looking anywhere but Sam at this point, he was way to scared of what his brother was going to think of him after this.
“Dad make you do that?”
“I wasn’t sure why at first, I knew he hated us going with him on hunts I thought maybe it was because dad hated getting us involved but we were both good and knew what to do but I knew not to argue, he kept saying they were too advanced for us.” Dean was trying everything in him to keep from breaking down right then and there.
Dean looked at Cas and back to Sam smiling like he’s just won the world, and maybe he had.
Sam smiled while shaking his head slightly, “do you not remember?”
“Yeah and you didn’t let me saying something about you deserved that or something” Sam watched as something in his brothers face softened and seemed to almost hurt.
“God Sam, I thought he was gonna rip me apart but he just laughed and only bought beer from then on. And I remember you begging me to give you a sip of it.”
Deans face turned a tint of red and his voice stuttered a slight bit, “W-well Sam, we hunted and killed things. That is a reason to s-start drinking.”
Dean sat down, “I don’t know, I knew I was different than you and dad, I just didn’t know how or why but when this started, I don’t- I don’t know I seen men like you do women.”
Frank had launched into the opening track of the album
“Ah, some English guy Jo recently got into. Any time it looks like I’m even going near her phone, she bites my head off thinking I’m going to change the playlist,” he laughs while wiping down the bar top. “I’ll send her out when she finishes up in the office.”
Dean scrunched his nose in disgust.
“Sammy, come on, I know you like his music now. I’ve caught you listening while you study!” Dean all but whined down the phone to his goody-two-shoes, law-school-going little brother.
They shared small smiles and just stared at one another for a few moments where the chaos surrounding them seemed to melt away.
Jo stepped forward again, grabbing the cash from Dean with a satisfied look on her face, clearing her throat. “Everyone! Mark the day!,” she called out to the Roadhouse at large. “August 3rd, 2021, 12:40pm. Dean Winchester expressed interest in music made in the 21st century!”
that’s cool. are these the kind of concerts with like mosh pits and stuff??
The next song just as insistently held his attention as it started, with Frank declaring to Dean’s otherwise empty home:
Frank and the band blazed through a few more songs, and the two men sweat and danced and sang. Dean experienced his first circle pit during “Try This At Home.” He ran in circles while getting shoved with Cas right ahead of him, laughing all the way. The crowd surfing resumed for other songs like “Long Live The Queen” and “Glorious You,” though Dean and Castiel silently agreed neither of them would be partaking in that activity tonight. They jumped around like little kids for “Polaroid Picture.” Then “Plain Sailing Weather” started, one of Dean’s top songs. Probably his second favorite. And he basically lost his mind as he sang along at the top of his lungs.
“I found her, ladies and gentlemen, the best dancer in New York!” Frank declared to the room as he started waltzing with the dazed fan while picking back up the song in broken breaths. “
“Can you send me this playlist so I can listen to more of it?” he asked Jo, not looking at her as he fished some cash out of his wallet to pay his bill.
That was nothing new, of course. Dean had always been drawn to music, always related to lyrics that fit his life or current circumstances, and annoyed his family and friends by playing the songs out on repeat, over and over. But, like Jo had teased him about earlier, he didn’t do this with
Some people laughed as Frank began to explain what he wanted everyone to do, others just kept cheering. Dean and Cas just continued to stare at each other from across the floor, smiling, while somehow managing to clap in the appropriate places.
“Frank Turner. He’s kind of folksy, kind of punk. Depends on which song or album you’ve got on. I heard him on the radio a few weeks ago,” she explained, shrugging.
Dean kept the album on repeat all night long. He knew this was the beginning of something new, something to be excited about. Considering most of Dean’s days looked the same—not that there was anything wrong with routine—this really delighted him to his core. Even once he turned the music off to finally go to sleep, he found himself snuggling down under the covers in the dark, humming his new obsession with a smile on his face.
“Thanks, man,” Dean said as Ash handed over his burger, fries, and Coke. “Who do you have on right now?” he asked, pointing at the speakers over the bar.
After the bridge, the music slowed and Frank crouched down on the stage as he waved his arms back and forth. “Clear a space, clear a space!,” he urged.
By the end of “Get Better” Cas and Dean were screaming along with Frank, their beer bottles clutched to their chests in one hand while the others were raised above their heads to finger point for emphasis. They shouted, “we can get better, because we’re not dead yet. We can get better, because we’re not dead yet!” and as the song abruptly ended, they cheered as loud as they could. Dean turned to Cas with a wide wild smile on his face, buzzing half from the beer and half from the energy in the room. Cas just kept applauding and laughing in elation, smiling back at Dean.
exactly cas. that’s it.
I'm sorry to hear about your difficult times, Dean. Thank you for sharing that with me. I didn’t mean to pry. But I get it. It’s… it’s a defiant life affirming sentiment, one laced with hope.
album cover, and, of course, “I Still Believe” is from his album
forearm.
“Whoa, this is my first show so I didn’t know what to expect, but free merch definitely wasn’t close to anything I thought would happen.” Dean replied as he started sorting through his small haul of goodies.
doesn’t matter now anyway, shows sold out now
“Smartass,” Dean grumbled. He had been trying to convince Sam to go with him to that nearby concert since tickets were only $25, but Sam refused to budge since it was right in the midst of his midterms.
Cas threw his head back with a laugh. “Exactly! And once we finish our beer if you decide you want to head deeper in the crowd we can do that, too.”
Punishing drums came rushing out. Ah, “Four Simple Words” was to be the final song of the evening then, Dean thought, though it seemed that they were skipping the first verse -- opting instead to jump straight into the second one. Doing so erased the slow build of the song, which made it a hard and fast ordeal. One that inspired the pit to open back up and crowd surfers to rise again. In the chaos, Dean and Castiel were pushed forward through the crowd a bit more than they had been all night long. They shared an amused look as they sang along, not caring one bit. It was the end of the night -- why not end up down the front?
well i always feel like i have to fight for what i have, to get it and keep it. and there’s been a lot of difficult times in the past that i sometimes still struggle with but it never really stops me you know? the best people i know really are looking out for me and its a nice reminder that i really am not dead yet.
“Why are you even so set on me going with you? What about Jo?! It’s her fault anyway!”
Apparently but dude all the songs ive heard so far from this guy are great
artists. And this song was new! Well, it came out in 2015 according to Genius.com, where he’d been obsessively reviewing the lyrics, but that was new for him!! New
“Hello New York! Welcome to show 2,612! My name’s Frank Turner, I come from Winchester in England. Let’s sing this one together:
What if Frank Turner’s set didn’t live up to what he imagined? What if he played songs Dean didn’t know? What if he and Cas got separated in the crowd; would he be okay on his own? Why did he care so much about being separated from someone he only met tonight, anyway?
Dean nearly jumped out of his skin, startled by a deep voice coming from behind him. He quickly turned around to a man nearly his own height, with dark hair and blue eyes. Realizing he’d been staring for a moment too long, Dean shook his head slightly, asking “Cas?” and smiling with relief when the man nodded. He felt comforted that Castiel matched his profile photo so he was easily recognizable, but he wasn’t counting on him being nearly his height, having a voice like that, or eyes quite so blue.
As people did, he jumped down into the crowd, directly to the left of Dean, who turned to look at Castiel with wide eyes. Castiel shook with laughter at the face Dean made; he had clearly been trying not to freak out but was not very successful in hiding it. Frank wandered back through the crowd a bit with his microphone in hand, eventually settling in front of a random fan with his hand held out in a dramatic flourish.
Sorry man. I know how much you wanted to go. I’ll make it up to you.
than everything else he listened to, anyway. He just couldn’t get over how much the song spoke to him.
“Nope!” she replied, popping the p at the end, “we just want to spread the word; there’s a lot of great artists on the label with Frank. Here, I think I have download cards, too.” And with that, Kate began digging back through her magical tote bag of swag.
It was smaller inside than he expected. There was a small balcony that wrapped three-quarters of the room, and a bar on each level. The stage stood about four feet off the ground and people were already crowding around the front, chattering excitedly. In the back of the room was the main bar, and the pair made their way to it, each ordering a beer as they made their way through small talk.
Cas didn’t even notice Dean spent the rest of the song watching him sing along and finger-point with a smile on his face. Jenny ended her set with a bow and lots of cheers as the house lights came up again. There was a small rush of people heading back towards the bar that ended up maneuvering the two off to the side of the room to avoid the stampede.
“Hello, Dean. I saw your comment in the Frank Turner Army. If you’re still interested, the ticket is yours. Let me know.”
You can’t see it, but I’m sure you know what face I’m making at my phone right now.
A few minutes later, Dean had another new notification waiting for him—a friend request from one Castiel Novak.
“Uhhh… the 3rd?” he called back.
Just curious. It’s really special to get to hear your favorite songs live and in person.
Fine, I’ll listen, eventually.
. I never got to tell you, but “I Still Believe” is my favorite song of his. I had a religious upbringing and always struggled with belief, or faith, in general. But, I like the idea of putting that faith in music and people.” Cas shrugged a little at the end, his quiet discomfort a little obvious as he shared a vulnerable piece of himself with Dean.
Dean let go of a breath he didn’t realize he had been holding and smiled down to himself. Castiel got it. He
On a late Friday night, just as Dean had finished loading his dishwasher his phone beeped from somewhere on the counter. It was another message from Castiel, which made Dean smile. He was growing quite fond of him already and was glad to have a friend who didn’t seem to judge him or want to constantly take the piss out of him. The show was only days away now, and their conversations never really ended. They just continued on with them throughout each day.
“Yes, Dean,” Sam sighed. “I do like his music. I also want to pass my classes and actually become a lawyer. Which is why, you know, I study so much.”
Three dots appeared immediately, telling Dean that Castiel was online now and replying.
He browsed for a while, before he got up to start his nightly rituals. One post stuck out in his brain as he crawled into bed; it was sharing a new batch of just announced tour dates for a month or so from now. There had been hundreds of comments on it. Everyone had been buzzing with excitement, wondering about when tickets went on sale, gushing about how many shows they were planning on going to, planning pre-show meet-ups. That wasn’t something Dean had ever felt or experienced before, but he had noticed that one of the shows would be at a venue only a 45-minute drive from where he lived. Compared to some of the other comments he’d seen, that wasn’t bad at all. Not like driving Baby was a hardship to endure. He made a mental note to look into the tour more as he clicked off his bedside lamp.
Yeah, this song was better the second time round. And the third. And the fourth. Honestly, Dean lost track of how often he had heard it now, because midway through that first listen he just put that song on repeat and sat back on the couch and promptly zoned out. He’d only been startled back to reality when the timer on his phone went off, alerting him that his pizza was done. And even that didn’t bring him all the way back to the world, didn’t make him take “Get Better” off of repeat. It was like this guy was singing from his soul, Dean’s soul, that is.
After a few more playthroughs of “Get Better,” Dean navigated through the Spotify app to find the album it belonged to, one called
Two weeks after Jo accidentally changed his life, Dean was scrolling through his Facebook feed while listening to his carefully curated playlist after work. He was startled from his semi-sightless gaze when he latched onto the words “Frank Turner” that appeared on his screen. He clicked on the post and was redirected to the Facebook group, The Frank Turner Army—the same one he had requested to join a while ago. Apparently, he was granted membership without noticing, so he took the time now to wade through the posts made by a global fan community that he was surprised to be kind of part of now. People shared tattoos inspired by lyrics, photos and videos from shows, debated current events as they related to certain songs, selfies with the man himself, and an inexplicable amount of llama posts…? Maybe the latter was from a song he didn’t know yet, though he wasn’t sure if he really wanted to know.
Dean settled again after the chorus had repeated itself, and opened up iMessage.
Ha. ha. Very funny. Listen to the song bitch
“COME ON, HUG SOMEONE!” Frank continued to urge in between the lines of his song.
It certainly didn’t feel okay, but what else could Dean say or do about it. Scrubbing his hand through his hair, he closed his laptop and decided to turn to a reliable old friend for the night: his beloved playlist. It was second nature at this point for Dean to play it before bed, and he allowed himself this little sulk tonight in the dark, with him on the couch. His eyes closed and attempts were made to slow his breathing. Calm down. Everything was fine, just like always. He’d just thought that maybe, just this once, he would get to do something he was truly excited about. Not going to the show wasn’t the end of the world, and there would be more opportunities, he repeated over and over, as he was pulled into one of his favorite songs as he drifted, “I Am Disappeared.”
am i being interviewed now? Lol
“I know. I’m sorry, Dean. Next time he comes around we’ll all try to go, okay?”
“Should we get on line?,” Castiel gestured to the queue that was slowly filtering into the venue as he began walking to the back of it.
“So, these are just free? No catch?” he questioned.
-------
A few songs had played through while he checked his emails, laughed at memes in his group chats, and hopped over to Twitter to see what the world was gossiping and arguing about today. Then he heard it. The harsh drumbeat that had originally caught his attention during his lunch hour. He sat upright, putting his beer down as he quickly switched his apps over to open Spotify up to double-check what he was listening to. The song that had swept him off his feet was titled “Get Better.”
“It’s the sparrow from his
Towards the end of “Photosynthesis,” Frank took the opportunity to introduce each member of the band. Then, he told the crowd he intended for them to borrow something from the world of death metal shows, with a twist. Instead of having his fans do a “wall of death,” an activity that involved splitting the crowd in half and having each side run at each other at full speed, Frank wanted them to do a “wall of hugs.” He asked for the crowd to split entirely, all the way from the front of the stage to the very back by the bar. As everyone moved to a side, Dean realized he had lost Castiel again -- he was across the divide waving hello with a laugh.
Yet, Dean couldn’t suppress his smile as he looked at the ink. When he looked up at Cas’ face, he felt his own flush a bit and he rubbed the back of his neck self consciously. “Thanks for sharing that with me, Cas,” he said quietly. “You know this is only my first show of his, but I really do appreciate the ticket. I can’t remember the last time, if ever, that I was excited about a new artist that was still actively touring.”
“I’m sure :) A friend of mine who was supposed to use the ticket had something come up so now I have the spare. Don’t want it to go to waste, and would rather it go to someone’s first time.”
He enjoyed this one, but it wasn’t one he’d paid as much attention to. Dean thought he should probably try to fix that at some point, but there were just so many songs to know and only so many hours in the day. He noticed he had a handful of notifications on Facebook waiting for him as he tapped his phone to check the time. Surprised to see one of them as a reply to his comment in the fan group, he waited for the page to load, feeling the faint buzz of
. Let alone going to one with a stranger from the internet. Granted, at this point, Castiel hardly felt a stranger but that was essentially what he was. What if this was all some long con and the ticket he sold him wasn’t genuine? What if he ditched him once they got into the venue? What if he didn’t ditch him and he turned out to be annoying as hell during the gig? There was just too much to worry about, and with nothing else to occupy his mind, Dean instead fixated on all these what if’s.
Dean paused. He liked Castiel, and considered them friends already. But he wasn’t sure if he should open up like this to him. Not when he didn’t share those sorts of things with even his closest friends or Sammy. But he would never really feel comfortable doing that with them, and, oddly enough, the more he thought about it, he realized he did feel okay with Castiel knowing.
Isn’t she wonderful, ladies and gentlemen?,” he asked while he twirled the woman around. Dean and Cas stood there with mouths agape, clapping and laughing at the spectacle of the show.
Dean was sort of speechless at that. He just stared at Cas, this thoughtful and kind stranger from the internet who was doing his damndest to make sure he had a great first gig, with his beer bottle halfway to his mouth. He cleared his throat as he felt his cheeks begin to flush, and let himself smile. “Thanks, Cas. That sounds like a solid plan. And hey! No one can crash into us and spill our drinks over here!”
“How have I not heard of this guy before?” he muttered to himself aloud.
-------
As the crowd kept parting, Frank went on talking. “By being in this room tonight, we constitute a community. And the thing about a community is, you demonstrate to each other and to the outside world through your actions the kind of values that you think are important. Right?! And this is my fucking show, so I’ll tell you what values we’re talking about. We’re talking about kindness, compassion, tolerance, and consideration. We’re talking about not judging people. We’re talking about not giving a fuck about where somebody’s from, what they believe in, who they wanna fuck, or what bathroom they wanna use.” The crowd kept erupting into louder and louder cheers of agreement as Frank shared his values. “We’re talking about making sure that every single person in this room is an equal individual, ladies and gentlemen! That’s what we’re talking about. So, with that in mind, my friends, we’re not actually going to do a ‘wall of death’ this evening. Instead, we’re going to do a ‘wall of hugs.’”
Dean nodded his thanks and tucked into his meal, continuing to enjoy the tunes. He didn’t listen to much newer music, a fact that… well, everyone in his life liked to tease him about. Why mess with what you know you like, right? Dean liked the classics; he had no need for anything else. But still, he found himself paying more and more attention to the music as he ate. One song with pounding drums came on, and he perked up, attentively listening to the lyrics. By the time the first chorus ended with the firm line, “we can get better, because we’re not dead yet,” Dean had to put his burger down to focus, leaning across the bar a bit as if that would help at all. In the mostly empty Roadhouse, Dean felt something shift in him. The music felt heavy, hitting him full force, as if it was being played specifically
The song seamlessly transitioned into “The Next Storm,” one Dean was very familiar with. He bounced in his place as he sang along, his beer bottle since abandoned on a nearby ledge along the wall. Castiel saw that Dean had discarded his empty and opted to follow suit, not even bothering to finish the last half of his drink. “Do you want to head into the crowd a bit?” he asked after placing his bottle down.
Thankfully, after their sprint, Frank brought everyone down for a slight break with “I Am Disappeared.” Another one of Dean’s favorites. Based on the look on Castiel’s sweaty face, he felt similarly about the song. The two men stood shoulder to shoulder as they sang along with soft smiles, their eyes drifting closed for periods of time as they felt the gravity of the lyrics. A song like this was powerful enough, but with the addition of the crowd singing along nearly louder than Frank himself, it was nearly unbearable for Dean. He found himself tearing up a little as he felt the music vibrate within him, and he willed the tears to stay in his eyes. Not that anyone would have been able to tell due to how sweaty everyone was. As the song approached its crescendo, the crowd began clapping along, so Dean and Castiel joined in, too. He could feel it deep in his chest, the power of this song, all these songs, this music. Dean raised his right arm above his head, finger pointing again to emphasize every phrase that felt like it was being ripped out of his soul. Castiel watched him for a moment, and did the same.
Cas looked away from down the bar, first at Dean, then up at the ceiling as if it held the answer he sought. He tilted his head again slightly, like Nipper, the terrier dog in the classic ad for His Master’s Voice. After a moment he nodded and smiled with his eyes. “It’s the Menzingers. They’ve toured with Frank in the past. They’re great live. This song is called ‘Good Things.’
While Sam was talking Cas made his presence known to Dean. He had tears in his eyes and smiled like Sam was taking the words out of his mouth.
Dean nodded, at this point neither of them knew that Cas had walked in and was hearing the last bit of their conversation.
“Hush, please and let me get this out.” Dean grabbed Sams hand and looked at him finally. Sam placed his other hand on top and let Dean finish.
“Sam.. he, Dad,” Dean paused to breath a hard breath, “Was not, well he wasn’t really,”
Dean stopped and thought for a second while Sam got two glasses from the kitchen, that little shit. He did remember.
“Sam that you?” Dean shuffled in wearing his dead men of letters robe over a plain white shirt with grey sweatpants and slippers.
Dean laughed “he made me do a hell of a lot worse Sammy. And I don’t know, it changed me.”
“Is that why you look as Cas the way you do? You like him?”
“Why did dad do anything Sam? He wanted to find moms killer and I did just as bad, I guess I wanted to more.”
Sam sat up, his smile faltering like deans had a few moments ago, “Yeah but, I don’t know, you didn’t drink when we came back from a hunt, only when you came back with dad...”
“Yes, Michael?”
“Yeah,” Cas says, nodding fervently, then crashes their lips together once again.
The rhythmic strumming of an electric guitar and steady beat of a drum flow through the wood door as they approach. He hums along to the familiar tune and holds it open for Castiel, because contrary to his brother’s belief, he can be a gentleman when he wants to.
Aaron gives him a lingering sideways glance, one hand flat on the deck behind Cas. When did he get so close? “So... what about you?”
Instead he begs,
means more.
Blue-Eyes immediately pulls away from him (to Dean's mixed disappointment and relief) and straightens up, smoothing long, tan fingers down his front. He has dark brown hair, all mussed like he just rolled out of bed and Dean can’t help thinking it’s sexy as hell. Nearly as tall as Dean, broad-shouldered, and about the same age, if not a little older. Can’t tell much else, covered as he is, but he looks fit—not that he’s ogling the guy or anything.
“There,” he murmurs softly, finally smiling, “
(An incredibly hot nerd with a voice made for porn.) But Dean knows a thing or two about absent fathers, and sees a kindred spirit in Cas. It just intrigues him even more.
“Nope, sit. Eat. I got you.”
“But what if I decide to stay here?” he says. He tosses back the final sip of his second beer. “What will you do?”
“Uh-huh. Look, Dean, I love you, but you’re about as subtle as a sledgehammer to the face.”
He keeps his eyes peeled for the Lincoln as his brain spins scenario after scenario, beginning with the mundane and devolving into the horrific. Thoughts like, maybe Cas has a cold, become maybe Cas got hurt, become maybe Cas is dead, and by the end of the week it takes all Dean’s willpower not to call all the hospitals and morgues and dig through the
He kisses Cas again, ignoring the curious stares of passersby. The arms encircling his neck, holding him tight, tell him he's safe,
Dean clears his throat. “You, uh… you ever want that?” he says, cocking his head toward the people nearby.
“Drink some water or juice for me, too. Will you do that?”
“Thank you again.”
They’ve barely finished packing up their gear when the first rumble of thunder rolls overhead and rain begins to fall. It’s a mad dash to the Impala from there, and since Dean had parked so far down, they’re fucking soaked to the bone by the time they shut themselves inside.
“Yeah. I suppose my greatest regret is that I hardly knew him. He was rarely home when I was young, and we were never close. Soon as my brothers and I turned thirteen, he sent us to boarding school. It felt as though he controlled every aspect of my life. Still does, sometimes, even now that he’s gone...”
He's straddling the line between Dick Tracy and overworked tax accountant; cheap black suit, white shirt, backward blue tie, and rumpled beige trench coat.
“Dean—”
“I’m sorry I fell asleep on ya like that, it wasn’t uh. Planned or anything.” Dean rubs his neck self-consciously. “Probably think I’m a real creep.”
Dean holds a hand up, cutting him off. “Nope. Coming here was my idea, so it's my treat. House rules.”
“We should have a housewarming party! You gotta let off some steam. Might as well meet the locals, too.” Castiel’s lips part with a rebuttal but the sound is halted by Dean’s palm, held vertical in the air between them. “Nope. House rules. We’re doin’ this. No ifs, ands, or buts.”
“Are you cold?”
“Not yet, anyway.”
The flush of heat spreads from the tips of his ears down to his collar. With a humiliated lump in his throat, he sluggishly raises his head to meet the most brilliant eyes he’s ever seen. Beautiful, bright green, surrounded by long, full lashes. They crinkle at the corners, sparkling with amusement. And now he can't make up his mind whether this is a nightmare, like the ones he had of showing up to class naked as a kid, or the beginnings of a pornographic
“Yeah, Cassie?”
Castiel takes a final pull from his beer, setting the empty bottle back on the nightstand as he swings his legs over the bed and stands. Stretching languidly, he twists his arms first over his head, then again behind his back, listening to the cracks and pops of his neck and spine before shaking his limbs loose again with a relieved groan. He glances over his shoulder just as Dean looks away, busying himself with pouring a finger of Jim Beam into two cups. Dean hands him his, in a Batman coffee mug of all things.
“Let me hear you, sweetheart,” Cas gently orders, the desire in his voice palpable. He knows Dean has misgivings about being noisy in the bedroom but makes a point to draw every last gasp and moan from his lips anyway, intent on breaking down Dean's walls with such tender, patient baby steps. “You're going to be so tight for me, so hot,” he continues. “Push in one finger now, dragging against the rim with your knuckle as you go. Slowly. Slide it in and out, tugging and pulling, loosening yourself up until you're ready for a second finger.”
What if he hadn’t stopped? What if he wanted it just as badly? What if Castiel had encouraged those starved and desperate caresses with his own? As good as they were above his clothes, oh, he’d give anything to feel Dean’s hands beneath them. On him right now, with his skin all hot and slick. He brings a leg up, propping his foot on the edge of the tub as a hand dips down low between his thighs. Just a hint of pressure against his perineum, teasing and too light. A single finger circling, he rubs around his rim but doesn’t press in where he wants. Not quite yet.
“Dean, maybe we should talk about this,” he says, but it comes out sounding more like a question than a request because the part of him asking is also terrified the answer won't be what he longs to hear.
Half peeved and half worried, he toes off his boots and hangs his jacket in the small closet in the foyer before wandering to the second floor. It’s not until he reaches the top that he hears the shower running and sighs with relief.
“I wouldn’t do that to you, Dean.”
To be marked, claimed, as Dean’s. Knowing Dean bears similar bruises. A flare of possessiveness unfurls in his gut, and he can’t help wondering what else Dean would let him do.
Why he even cares so much, Dean has no clue, aside from it being rare to have new people around. Okay, and yeah, the guy is
“I need an actual answer, Dean.” Is it possible to
Now, Castiel stands in the center of his office, staring dumbly at the name flashing across the phone in his palm, a knot tightening in his gut. Dread sits at one corner of his mind, fraying at the edges, anger seeping in, the sour tinge of bile crawling up his throat. The fingers of his free hand twitch. He flexes them unconsciously.
Castiel cocks a singular dark brow as the burly man gives him a long and lingering once-over that under any other circumstances might peak his own interest. Benny clicks his tongue against his teeth, making a pleased sound deep in his throat. He holds out a hand.
He watches Cas stomp up the stairs (for lack of a better term, ‘cause he’s pretty sure each step is landing just on the hard side, at least more than is necessary). Rolling his eyes, he grabs his wallet and heads into town.
“Will you open the door?” Cas pauses, and Dean sucks in a breath. “Please?”
Gradually, Dean begins finding new excuses to drop by. At lunch for a soda and snack. After work for a six-pack. On days off to fill up Baby’s tank. Then he starts switching shifts with Benny. When Bobby notices, he gives Dean an uncomfortably scrutinizing look, and just starts scheduling him for the days Cas will be there.
Elbows drawn to his knees, he grinds the heels of his palms into his eyes, mind cartwheeling between punching the wall and shouting. Instead, he sits in abject silence, face in his hands, until something like hollowness settles where his heart used to be. A grim calm, one that tells him he’ll need a stiff drink or an excellent lay just to
Without thought, his free hand automatically winds between the strands and
The introductions fly quickly from there. Bobby and Ellen are the next to show, with Jo and Charlie right behind. They greet Castiel with tight hugs and genuine smiles that fill his heart with warmth and calm his nerves a bit more. Meg arrives with Krissy, the waitress Castiel had seen that first night at the diner, and twins Max and Alicia who run a thrift shop in town which Dean calls a “New-Agey tourist trap”. There’s a man named Rufus, who arrives alone and merely grunts at the both of them before wandering in to locate Bobby. A sweet, bubbly, gangly man (a dentist, he's told) named Garth and his wife. Ash, from the motel, brings two other men Castiel has yet to meet who quickly help themselves to drinks and food.
He doesn’t believe in fate; that stuff’s only for fairy tales and romantic comedies and that one play his English teacher had the class read in high school he’ll never acknowledge made him tear up a little. Yet he can’t quite shake the idea that they were meant to meet because... Cas feels like a piece of Dean he never knew was missing.
Dean winks before sauntering away, calling over his shoulder, “As you wish!”
But it put Sammy through law school, because even the full-ride to Stanford didn’t cover living expenses and housing, and Dean wanted all his brother’s focus on school, not hopping between classwork and a job. He wanted better for Sammy because that kid deserved the damn world even if Dean had to scrape and claw his way through to give it to him.
The elevator had broken three months prior, and the landlord still hadn’t seen fit to fix it. Nor had he fixed the leak in Castiel’s bathroom sink, or the off-kilter dishwasher that threatens to pop from its fixtures when he pulls the upper rack all the way out.
She does an exaggerated hair flip. “Yes, I am.” Then her face turns serious. “I can’t make guarantees for everyone else, though. And you’re gonna have to talk to him, eventually. Tell him how you feel. You know that, right?”
Just then Charlie sidles up next to Jo, waving a cherry popsicle. “There you are!” She gives Dean and Cas each a one-handed hug, grinning brightly. “Come on, Bobby’s already got the grill going. You promised us your famous burgers!” she says, pointing the popsicle at Dean.
The man at the register stares back, wide-eyed and silent, until someone clears their throat. Dean snaps his jaw shut with an audible click, unaware both that it’d been hanging slack to begin with
“What kind of offer, exactly?”
“Oh.” Castiel’s heart sinks a little for reasons he can’t quite discern. “My apologies. I can put her in her crate while you work.”
“Take one hand and grip your hair. Gently, though. Just scratch at your scalp, no pulling.
Dean coughs. There’s no way in hell he heard that right. “What?”
He stares as the faucet drips onto the porcelain below, and doesn't that just feel like the icing on today’s cake of misery. After a long moment, his gaze drifts to the mirror. The permanent circles beneath his eyes give him a gaunt, near skeletal appearance, they’re so dark, and the eyes themselves are glazed and bloodshot. The thick stubble around his mouth is rough against his palm as he scrubs one hand over his face and turns to make his way to the living room, legs ready to give out beneath him.
Cas stands in the doorway, dripping wet and beautifully flushed. His damp hair’s spiked in forty different directions, piercing eyes narrowed, a towel slung loose and low around his
There’s a flash behind the other man's eyes Dean can’t quite decipher from this distance. Did he overstep? They did hang out at the Lodge a few times, ate together, watched what little was on rotation with the motel’s crappy cable setup. But maybe he’s not comfortable doing it here? Or maybe he’s still pissed? Christ, first night in and he’s fucked it all up—
that?
Claire sits curled in his lap, purring contentedly. He’d considered leaving her with Hannah but wasn’t sure how long he’d be away. She wasn’t too happy about flying or being stuck in a crate for part of the trip, but he feels better having her with him. He drags a palm down her silken fur as the cab leaves the pavement and pulls down a winding dirt road that leads to a large, colonial farmhouse. Scratching behind her ears, he peers through the windshield as the driver parks.
Thick, strong arms wrap around his back. One hand moves, a slow stroke between his shoulder blades, firm but soothing. His face warms and heart
. Dean’s teeth scrape over the plump flesh of Cas’ lower lip, nipping and teasing, coaxing a whimper that he swallows readily.
When he next wakes, there are multiple people speaking, but the duvet tucked in close under his chin is warm and everything outside of it is freezing and sucks ass so he burrows deeper, shivering violently, body feeling clammy and disgusting. A miserable moan escapes when another bolt of pain lances through his head just from that tiny bit of effort.
Sam catches him watching Cas squat down to lift the other end of the bed. His eyebrows shoot into his hairline and he gives Dean a look that says “really?”
“Yeah. Payments quit comin’ in, and Bobby said your dad stopped calling. Didn’t know why. Figured he gave up on the place or something.” Dean shrugs. “I still went by every once in a while to mow the lawn and shit, but after my business took off and we hadn’t heard from Chuck in a couple of years…” he trails off. “I’m sorry.”
It isn’t Sam’s fault Mom died and Dad went off the friggin’ deep end. Isn’t his fault Dean got stuck with so much responsibility so young. Isn’t his fault he got a childhood and Dean never did.
“I’m sorry,” Dean says wearily. He parks a hip against the counter and rubs the back of his neck, feeling sheepish and ashamed and still stupidly turned on. “I, uh… I don’t know what got into me.”
It’s soothing and nostalgic, the steady sound of it against glass and metal with the rhythmic
“You know what, just because it isn’t a heart attack on a plate doesn’t mean it isn’t good!”
? She begins backing away toward wherever it is she wandered over from and salutes. “Don’t give up, is all I’m saying. Be seeing you, Dean.”
Dean groans, only half-feigning misery because he knows he’s not actually being given a choice. “Nah, I don’t think so.”
This… this, Dean can do. He can cook some goddamn burgers, and pretend everything is fine.
“Are you alone?”
and though Cas had wanted to go along with him, it'd been Dean’s idea for him to stay behind. Jack might be an all-powerful nephilim and hunter-in-training, but they’re still just a kid, and with Sam busy tracking leads and appointing cases to the rest of their steadily growing network, at least one of ‘em had to stick around to help them out (and keep him out of trouble).
The further into the house Castiel wanders, the more he thinks about his father's life here and how it made him the man he was, the more unsettled he feels. Backing out, he turns and tiptoes up the stairs, which creak and groan mildly under his weight. He grips the banister but quickly withdraws his hand, almost black with dust. Grimacing, he wipes it on his coat and continues his search.
With an endless stream of repaired engines, replaced batteries, changed alternators, fixed brakes, etcetera, Dean’s days more or less blur together as they always have. He loves the work, though. Loves fixing things with his hands, seeing the fruits of his efforts, feeling useful. But he can’t prevent the longing for more stirring under the surface like the current beneath a frozen river, the nagging sense that something is
“Can we, uh. Can we put this behind us now? Have a few beers, marathon Dr. Sexy, hang out like we always do?”
Cas’ jaw makes a valiant attempt to meet the floor, and if not for the niggling of doubt in the back of Dean’s mind now screaming
The moment he answers the call, Castiel knows.
But no, that wasn’t Castiel’s life.
Bobby’s gruff, “Morning, Princess” greets him from across the table while Ellen frowns disapprovingly by the stove where she’s frying eggs. He knows the reason behind her expression but isn’t about to prod that issue with a twenty-foot pole before he’s even had his first sip of the day. Hopefully, she’ll be kind enough to give him a five-minute head start.
Maybe it’s outside the gender role norm or whatever, but cleaning, cooking, building and fixing things, taking care of people… that’s how Dean shows his love. Not with platitudes and pretty words, but with actions, and—
“Feel like I’m gonna puke, but yeah.” Castiel’s head cocks in question. Dean chuckles and shakes his head. “I fuckin’ hate heights, man.”
His thrusts are shallower now, frenzied as he clings desperately to the body underneath his. Their mouths meet, awkward and messy and perfect, and it’s all he needs to topple over that cliff, his cock pulsing within Dean, hips stuttering as he rides those final waves. They remain that way for a long moment, neither ready to let it end, but inevitably the exhaustion sets deep into Castiel’s bones and with one final gasp he slips free, smoothing a comforting hand down Dean’s arm when he whimpers from the loss. They collapse together, side by side, breathing hard with limbs thrown akimbo.
, the Righteous Man. Has even
What Cas lacked in practical experience when they started having sex he’s sure as shit made up for with raw enthusiasm, an utter lack of shame, and possibly a porn habit to rival his own. Took him a while to grasp some stuff, like dirty talk, but once he saw the affect it had on Dean he went all out. Same for kinks (Cas even told him he’s been “researching,” whatever the fuck that means), and of course, dude takes it on with the same solemnity and conviction he does everything.
“Oh, yeah? How’s that?”
Fuck, how he wishes at this moment that Cas still had wings because hose days of calling for him without the constraints of human travel have long since passed but are still close enough to taste the memories of.
,” he drawls, punctuating the last letter.
“I’m fine,” he responds evasively.
“Like,
Friday, Dean drags Castiel to Sioux Falls in the beautiful Impala he'd seen that first night at the diner, affectionately dubbed
And really, who can blame Dean for watching Castiel’s ass until he turns the nearest corner? It’s that glorious, and absolutely worth any looks it earns him from passersby. Soon as Cas disappears from view, Dean glances around to make sure no one’s looking directly at him before subtly adjusting his inappropriate semi.
“But you might sell it?”
but still hasn’t said a single word about today. Maybe he forgot...
“Dean,” Cas says, voice low, and their eyes meet.
When Father first became ill, they’d gathered in that bleak hospital room around the family patriarch, stiff and silent. The twang of antiseptic and bleach and decay burning his nostrils, making him nearly as sick to his stomach as the tension riddling the air, sharp and glistening like knives. Each of the brothers likely contemplated in their own way, in that devastating moment, what it would change, though they already knew the answer.
Setting the lube and condom beside them atop the duvet (which is undoubtedly about to get
Castiel refuses to claim the downstairs master, discomforted by the idea of sharing the space with the ghosts of grandparents he’d never met, of lying alone in the dark under the weight of their memories. A history unbeknownst to him, elusive, daunting, yet intriguing nonetheless. There are times when it’s painful just being
so obviously touch-starved.
His body tenses, face pulling into a scowl. When he glances to the side, Bobby’s already gone. And when did he turn the music off?
Castiel accepts, flicking off the lamp and sliding into bed. Dean hauls the blanket up over them both, lying back with one arm behind his neck. His eyes close, and the slight upturn of his lips, the smoothness to his features, say happy,
She frequently references his looks, and now he is unsure whether she's doing so to tease the two men or sincerely finds him attractive. "I'm sorry, is that a flirtation?" he asks.
“I’m sorry.” His gaze drops to the deck at their feet. “I just had to get away for a minute.”
Cas, but still feels he knows... nothing at all. As though he's from another goddamn plane of existence entirely, merely a visitor passing through Dean’s on his way to somewhere, or some
How can Cas sound so fucking composed, his voice coming out even and methodical like he's reading aloud from a lore manual or spell book? Dean's practically writhing on the sheets, nipples perky and tender, cool air settling upon his warm saliva in a contrast that sends shivers down his spine. Trapped between satin, lace, and the coarse hair of his treasure trail, his cock pulses desperately with each jolt of friction as he shifts his pelvis forward and back. And there Cas is with his gravelly voice comin' out like whiskey and velvet, smooth and steady even as it burns going down. He's a bastard, and the snarky, rebellious part of Dean itches to let him know it.
His phone abruptly shudders toward the corner of his desk, an obnoxious disco song reverberating off the stark white office walls. The unique ringtone Gabriel had set for his contact ID just to bug him, but Castiel never bothered or cared enough to change. Just as the phone slips from the wood surface and careens to the beige carpet beneath his feet, his hand shoots out and catches it mid-air.
“Well I mind!” he argues, arms folding over his chest to mimic the other man’s defensive posture. “You’re taking my bed.”
“But what?”
Because somehow, Castiel thinks it won’t feel like much of a home without Dean.
Sorry for the long wait between updates, but life has been... uh. Well, life. Hope it was worth the wait! (Please don't hate me for the cliffhanger lmao)
“Eden? Why didn’t he ever mention it before?”
He groans, scrubbing the rough palm not busy steering over his jaw.
to meet you, cher. Have to say the description did
That explained why the house hadn’t fallen apart, but it still looked like it hadn’t been touched in years. Castiel hums curiously. “But you stopped.”
“Depends.” He grins, hoping he sounds a helluva lot smoother than he feels. “Is it working?”
that he means every word.
“Hold up." She stops him, hand held in the air and an incredulous look on her face. "You’re telling me
Dean chuckles. “That bad, huh?” He tugs off his gloves and glasses, sitting back on his haunches.
on mother-henning him through it.
“Thanks, Dean.”
“I didn’t expect to find so many people comfortably out in a small town like this. Um. No offense.”
“You like it.”
together.
Tina's is nothing at all like the bland, mass-produced corporate chains one sees all across the country, clones upon clones littering every other street corner. There's character in these walls, in the black-and-white checkered floors, red booths lining one wall, round Formica tables down the middle, and long stainless steel counter and vinyl-topped barstools. Maybe a common sight once upon a time, but decades later it fills him with a warm combination of foreign and familiar, much like he felt watching vintage films on Turner Classic Movies with Gabriel as children. A sense of better, more innocent times, though he is at least self-aware enough to recognize the idealistic naivete of that sentiment.
“Hold this,” he orders, pushing one of Dean’s legs up and guiding the other man’s hand. Dean obeys admirably, hooking his hands under both thighs and presenting himself. Castiel holds his breath, just for a moment, needing it to clear his head, then lies on his belly and gets comfortable.
Paper plates, napkins, and utensils sit at one end, toppings and other fixings lining the back of the table. Mustard, ketchup, mayo, bar-b-que sauce, a jar of relish, sliced onions and tomatoes, dill pickles, a head of iceberg lettuce, a tupperware container full of cooked bacon, and packages of sliced sharp cheddar. Dean’s mouth waters just thinking about the meal he’s been looking forward to all week.
. He shouldn’t think it, knows he shouldn’t. Half asleep and hardly coherent, murmuring in that lethargic, dulcet voice, Dean couldn’t have known what he was doing. But that doesn’t stop the throbbing between his legs, the hum of desire flooding his veins, doesn’t mollify his appetite in the least.
Castiel’s eyes widen. Through gritted teeth he rasps, “
“You… you
. Silently folding her arms across her chest and tapping her foot, lips drawn into a thin line, Charlie goes full “done with his shit” mode. He gulps thickly, avoiding her gaze while he tries to wrap his tongue and his head around his next words. “I can’t. Cas is… he’s different.”
“Every time since I met you,” Cas says.
“You’re tellin’ me.” Dean laughs again, then lies with him, their shoulders rubbing.
It’s incredibly discomfiting, walking through someone else’s home, someone else’s life, and his heart thrums, chest feeling tighter with each step. Charles Shurley had been a secretive man, never particularly warm or benevolent toward him or his siblings. Castiel did everything he could to understand the man, to win his approval, had even gone to work for his company a bit after graduating from university. But he was a tough person to know, reclusive, and mercurial.
Two and a half cups of all-purpose, unbleached flour, spooned and leveled. One teaspoon salt. Six tablespoons unsalted butter, chilled and cubed. Three-fourths of a cup of vegetable shortening. Half a cup, 120 milliliters, of ice water.
He never did. And Dean fucking loves him for it. Damned if he’ll tell him so with words, he’s never been good at that shit, but he hopes every second of every day the man knows it from Dean’s actions because—
“Yeah.”
Rubbing his stubbled chin, Dean relents with a sigh. “I dunno what it is about this guy. He’s just… different.”
Benny nods solemnly. “He’s right. What do you have to lose? You miss your chance, you’ll regret it.”
“While on this hunt I asked the man what he thought and if he knew any of the people who were attacked, he said no but I could tell he did..”
“Dean I’ve seen you let love go past you because this life doesn’t allow it, the life we live tells us that brining someone into it could mean they die or something worse. But Cas, he’s been here with us for years and has come back from the dead every single time. Dean I’ve seen him look at you like this bond you both share when he brought you out of hell is all he’s gonna have with you. If I didn’t know any better when Castiel turned human it showed him how to love and how it felt, he’s changed and so have you. The way you all look at each other when your hurt, you care for him and he does you too.”
“You mean liking?”
“I love him, Sam.”
“You said you didn’t remember that little incident.” Dean laughed loudly “yeah I remember it very well, I was so bored and just started rummaging through the motel and what do you know, I find a bottle of unopened Jack Daniels Tennessee Whiskey.”
“Fuck.” Sam whispers “why?”
“I have a question.”
“Dean” Sam interrupts, “I-“
Dean was fully aware he was crying but why he wasn’t sure, his chest felt lighter and like he couldn’t breathe at the same time.
Dean could only nod and follow his lead. Noticing the tickets in his hands, Dean started pulling cash out to hand over to Castiel but was met with a hand over his. “Don’t worry about it. Buy me a few drinks inside and we’ll call it even. You’re saving me from having a ticket go to waste.”
“Jerk.” With that, the line went silent and Dean checked his phone to confirm, yep, Sam had hung up.
As one might expect, Dean didn’t let go now that he’d found something he liked. He kept Frank Turner’s music on repeat for the next week. To the relief of everyone in Dean’s life, Frank had a deep back catalogue and they weren’t stuck with the same handful of songs rattling around their skulls to drive them mad. So, Bobby didn’t complain at work, Sam quietly accepted Dean would keep sending him links to songs to check out (and admitted he did like his music, too), and Jo made sure even if something else was playing, she’d change the playlist over when Dean walked into the Roadhouse with a nod and a wink.
Who are you and what have you done with my brother Dean?
Whatever, Sammy could grumble all he wanted. Dean just knew if “Get Better” didn’t get him hooked, then this one, aptly called “Demons,” surely would. And then maybe he would not need to turn to strangers online to talk to about this music.
-------
He laughed. “No, far from it but I agree. I think Dean is going to enjoy it immensely.” He gave Dean a fond smile at that.
His shows can vary a lot. It depends on if it’s the full band, solo, duo, etc. The venue size plays a big role too in how the fans act. But the one we’re going to is fairly intimate, and it’ll be a full band show. It’ll be a great time.
-------
“Jo takes night classes now at the local community college and can’t miss a class,” Dean replied. He had been pacing his apartment while trying to convince Sam, but at the reminder of Jo also not being able to tag along with him to the gig, Dean sat back on his couch with a defeated feeling in his chest. “It’s just been so long since we did something like this, you know?”
The brother I know doesn’t listen to new music, this could be a link to hack my phone.
Then the lights went out, and everyone screamed.
He thought. Folk music wasn’t really his thing, like, at all. Yet he had to admit he had been enjoying the last 20 minutes of whatever he heard. Knowing he was about to get mercilessly teased, he swallowed the last of his Coke and stood up to leave.
You need to listen to this song too dont sass me just do it
Now, it was Cas’ turn to grab Dean in an excited panic like he had done earlier. Because what the band played next was
Dean worried his bottom lip between his teeth. He had never been in a crowd like that before. Hell, the only time he’d really seen live music had been in the bars he frequented or at county and state fairs. He also didn’t know what to make of Castiel referring to the concert as “our show.” He understood he meant the one they were both going to, but it seemed like he was planning to spend it with Dean, when Dean had expected to be alone for it -- like nearly everything else he did. He then found himself smiling at the thought of having someone to potentially share this experience with.
Frank kept talking. He went on about how, sure, maybe in the grand scheme of things a wall of hugs didn’t amount to much, but it did allow everyone to be open with each other, instead of closed off. It allowed everyone to feel connected to the community, and that everyone in attendance could take those values and feelings outside after the show ended and use them to try to make the world a little bit better. Now, Dean understood fully, finally, what Castiel had meant earlier about believing in music and people. This was what he had been talking about. This was what Dean wanted, too.
He thought as he read Castiel’s initial message as quickly as possible.
“Add to cart,” he said as he quickly went through the process of ordering a black t-shirt with big white letters spelling out “Not Dead Yet,” clearly from “Get Better.”
but that didn’t mean he didn’t want to. He always wanted to. He just wasn’t sure how or where to begin.
The two broke apart again, rushing to hug other people they didn’t know while they sang along. The song ended and somehow without even trying, Dean and Cas found each other next to one another in the crowd again.
“Let me explain how this works,” Frank continued. “You stay on your side until I shout ‘wall of hugs!’, and not before, and then you run into the middle and you hug a stranger. Don’t hug somebody you know. Hug someone you don’t know. Find someone you don’t know and give them a fucking hug! Do it respectfully, don’t be an asshole. But give a stranger a hug! Are you gonna do this with me?” And the crowd erupted again in a resounding, definite
Cas leaned over close, closer than Dean expected him to, and spoke directly into his ear. “Not personally, of course,” he chuckled, and his warm breath against the shell of Dean’s ear made him smile and nod, and close his eyes. “However,” Cas continued, and Dean reopened his eyes to keep watching Jenny, “I did do a little research into her music when she was announced as support for this tour. Not enough to sing along, really, but enough to know I’d enjoy her set.”
Castiel swallowed down a big gulp and nodded, returning the position to speak into Dean’s ear now. “Just got a little too hot from the crowd and all our dancing. Figured we both could use some water. I was going to come find you once I caught my breath but you beat me to it.”
Dean’s attention was drawn back to the bar with a little tap to his hand from the bartender. He smiled sheepishly for getting distracted and fumbled slightly to pay and tip. Then he was able to quickly return to his spot next to Cas, relieved no one else had swooped into their space.
A new song started with a chaotic sounding yell, and he checked what it was; “Out of Breath.” As he did so, intense, fast music came barrelling through that made Dean’s soul feel alight. He opened a new tab and navigated back to Genius.com to read along to the lyrics, smiling as he did so:
He snorted; yeah, that sounded like his kind of album. He saved Jo’s playlist to his account, went back to the album proper, took the app off of shuffle mode, and allowed the album to play through normally. He was surprised when a simple acoustic guitar and honest sounding lyrics met him in return:
Will you dance with me? I’m a terrible dancer.
-------
“If youre sure,” Dean replied again, “then yeah. Im dying to go. Franks been all I can listen to since I first heard him.”
Dean flipped her off, not dignifying her roasting with a response, and headed out the door. Whatever, he had a name and could remember some of the lyrics to that one song he really liked, he could always Google it himself.
-------
Dean looked out at the room. The crowd was like a living, breathing beast of its own. It moved and spoke as one, and everyone seemed so blissfully
“Sure! Does your friend want to jump in, too?,” she asked, already walking around her table to stand next to Cas.
Dean bumped his shoulder into Cas’ to get his attention after the cover ended, and held up his own empty bottle in silent question: do you want another? Cas gave a small smile, nodded, and handed his own empty to Dean. Due to most of the crowd being captivated by Jenny, there was basically no wait at the bar. He ordered and waited, turning back slightly to watch Jenny play another original song that he didn’t catch the name of but knew he liked right away. She sang:
It was another two weeks later, with two weeks to go to the local show, when Dean saw it. A post in that fan group he joined from someone claiming to have a spare ticket to the gig Dean was basically desperate to attend at that point. Swallowing nervously, he typed out a comment alongside the others that had already expressed interest: “I’d love to go. Never saw him live before, just became a fan.” He read it over a few times before nodding to himself and pressing enter to send it with an exhale. Despite being in the fan group for about a month now, Dean had never commented on any posts. He had hardly interacted at all beyond a few likes here and there, mostly just content to lurk and watch discussions play out in real-time.
And then a man ran on stage from the wings for a blaring harmonica solo. Dean should have expected it, it was in the recorded version of the song, after all. But in the moment it caught him off guard, and he laughed so much he shook loose of Castiel’s grip. Cas turned back to him smiling away, like this was the best time he ever had. It was certainly becoming one of the best times Dean had ever had.
. He let his eyes slip closed and let the music just wash over him as he absorbed it. He had to know what this song was, who it was by, he just had to know
under his skin. The original poster, a man named Castiel Novak, had been the one to reply. “Hey, can you check your ‘other’ messages on here? I’ve sent you a DM. :)”
Satisfied with his little dance break in the crowd, Frank started making his way back to the stage. He clambered up quickly and resumed singing in earnest while bouncing around the stage with his band. The hole in the crowd he had created quickly filled back up as everyone began dancing with all their hearts, silently coming to the understanding that this was their last chance to do so. Some people waltzed even though the tempo had picked up again, some jumped, some moshed, some even tried to get crowd surfing again.
” Dean watched and laughed, though he made sure to return the favor. The two of them were face to face, smiling and screaming along as they held their fists to their chests:
That works for me! There’s no bad place to watch a Frank show from, trust me.
Dean nodded. “Who is this?”
Dean slid onto a barstool and placed his usual order with Ash, the lovable geeky stoner working the bar, before pulling out his phone to poke at mindlessly. He just needed to breathe, get out of his head a little, and maybe this afternoon wouldn’t go so badly back at his uncle Bobby’s auto shop. Scrolling aimlessly, he found himself unconsciously bopping his head and tapping his feet along to the music piping out from the bar’s speaker system. It seemed like every song was by the same band, opposed to the miscellaneous variety of rock songs that was usually on.
Jenny took the space between the two of them as Cas snapped a few photos on his iPhone. The three huddled over it to make sure they turned out okay. They thanked Jenny again, and then walked to take a look at Frank’s table of wares. There was a lot of merch Dean wanted here, but he didn’t want to carry it all during the show, telling Cas as much. As they turned to head back to the main level they were stopped by a woman with short red hair.
Before he knew it, Jenny was up to her final song of the night, which she told the crowd was called “Last Person” as she thanked them for their time and attention. Cas turned to him smiling as she said the title of the song, leaning in to speak again. “This is one I know!” he said excitedly, as he quickly turned back towards the stage and cupped around his mouth to amplify his whoop. Dean just laughed.
. This song was his. This song was
Castiel’s whole face lit up at the suggestion. “Not at all, come on.”
The little link on the right side of the screen that had read “tickets” for the past two weeks next to the New York date had changed. Now it simply read “sold out.” Dean tipped his head to the backrest of the couch and banged his head repeatedly against it in frustration. He reached for his phone again, opening up his texts.
-------
“Thanks,” Dean smiled as he accepted the water. He leaned over towards Cas’ ear so he could be heard without having to shout, “You okay?”
He accepted the message and wrote back as fast as his thumbs would allow. “Hi Castiel. Are you sure? I know some other people had commented before me about the ticket.”
As the outro of the song petered out, the tears fell from Dean’s eyes. He let them linger for a moment as he took a shuddering deep breath and lowered his arm. Castiel watched him with an understanding look on his face and offered him a smile and a comforting shoulder squeeze. A quiet way to check in with Dean, again, to make sure he was okay. Dean wiped his face, erasing the evidence of tears along with his sweat, and nodded. He was more than okay. He was alive. He thought this must be what living really feels like. And he smiled brightly as “Recovery” started up, and the crowd around them roared back to life once more.
All Dean could do was laugh more as she yelled. He threw a $20 on the bar top, still laughing as he walked away with a wave over his head, the heavy Roadhouse door slamming shut behind him with the jingle of a bell.
That was the dream, wasn’t it? To live such a fulfilling, exhilarating life that by the time death came knocking on his door, he could flip him off with a cocky grin? Dean glanced around his small one-bedroom apartment, already mostly dark with the day's end. Sure, he wasn’t exactly living that sort of life
Jerk.
Really, who am I texting with right now?
“Once more unto the breach?” Castiel asked as he took a step forward, nodding back to the crowd.
As the song ended, Dean realized Castiel wasn’t near him anymore in the crowd. He panicked slightly, looking around for his perfect gig buddy. But he couldn’t see him anywhere. Frank had already begun playing a slightly slower love song, and Dean hadn’t realized just how hard he had pushed himself through the first half of the set. He took a deep breath and wiped the sweat from his brow, before turning to weave back through the crowd to where he and Castiel had been standing earlier at the start of Frank’s set.
for the first time in a really long time.
He pulled away, shrugging slightly and turned back to the stage, and Dean turned his head slightly to watch Cas watch her for a few beats. Dipping his head to hide his smile again, he turned back to the stage to watch the rest of Jenny’s set with Cas, whooping loudly and clapping as well as one could with a beer bottle in one of two available hands. Cas kept laughing at Dean’s struggles to applaud, and eventually, after her fifth song, held up his free hand towards Dean as if he wanted a high-five. With a furrowed brow, Dean looked between Cas’ hand and the man himself, and slowly raised his own hand to high-five back. Cas smiled wide, a big gummy thing that scrunched his nose, and made crinkles appear near his eyes, and he pulled his hand back to smack it against Dean’s wildly as if they were applauding like everyone else with two free hands. They both dissolved into laughter at this once the next song began, which surprisingly was a cover of Nelly’s “Hot in Herre,” which, of course, only made them laugh more.
Dean could understand that. He dropped back onto his couch while pondering Castiel’s question for a moment before realizing he didn’t need to think much about it at all.
He settled back against the couch, eating and smiling to himself as he resumed his idle scrolling and reading of his phone. That is, until the second track started and he practically yeeted himself upright again. “Get Better” was track two. And by now, he’d heard it enough to hum along confidently, and even sing along to the refrain. Because, dammit, this was his new
Cas just rolled his eyes, a movement that was a whole-body affair, and shrugged with one shoulder. Dean opened his mouth to protest again, but Cas had grabbed him by the wrist and was leading him along the wall of the venue down towards the front of the stage.
He understood exactly what Dean was feeling about that song and put it into words. Right there on his screen.
If you had told Dean this would happen, to expect it from someone he befriended online a few weeks prior, he wouldn’t have believed it. Or would have thought it was incredibly corny, at the very least. But all he could do was laugh along with Cas, like this was just something they did all the time and not the first time two veritable strangers were hanging out. It wasn’t too much, it wasn’t awkward, it just felt natural to be next to him with music he liked surrounding them and vibrating within their cells.
Dean shook his head slightly, trying to clear away the worries that plagued him. Cas looked on at him with a furrowed brow and a slight tilt to his head, as if he was trying to figure out exactly which gears were turning inside Dean’s brain. He tried to give Cas a reassuring smile as he changed the subject. “Should we grab another round before the big event?” he asked, trying to appear nonchalant.
“Hey, Joooooooo!” Dean sing-songed as she approached him with his bill, eyeing him warily. “Who’s got two thumbs and a ticket to see Frank Turner now? This guy!” he laughed while flashing some cheesy thumbs-up at her.
It had already been a long morning, full of rude customers who had been testing Dean’s patience. He pressed the heels of his palms to his eyes and shook his head, taking a moment to gather himself before getting out of his pride and joy, his 1967 Chevrolet Impala, and heading into the Roadhouse for lunch. He usually brown-bagged it every day, but on top of everything else going on today, of course, he forgot his lunch on the kitchen counter. He sighed before opening the door to the familiar dark bar and grill, plastering on a smile to avoid getting the third degree from Ellen and Jo, his mother and little sister for all intents and purposes.
He sat back again once his impulse purchase was complete, then found himself on Facebook where he meandered through a group called The Frank Turner Army that had over 15,000 members. He wasn’t really one for fan groups for anything, but, dammit, he needed to find people to talk to about this music and it seemed his brother and de-facto sister were not going to be the ones he could turn to. He requested to join and closed the page.
“Ladies and gentlemen,” Frank yelled as the final notes of “Photosynthesis” rang out. “One more song! Let’s fucking do this!”
“get better” no question is my favorite. I love the way it sounds. I love the energy of it and uh i relate to the lyrics a lot. It was the first song of his that really spoke to me so yea
As they waited for an opening with the bartender, Dean had finally noticed that slightly above the noise of the chattering, restless crowd, there was music playing. He tried to focus on it because it sounded like something he might enjoy, but he didn’t recognize it. Might as well refer to the expert, he figured.
His afternoon at the shop passed in a blur. Thankfully, Dean was stuck under a few cars and saved from having to deal with any of the folks who came through. He couldn’t get that one song out of his head the whole time he worked, even as he tried to drown it out a little with some of his favorite well-played tapes.
He took his hand in his.
By the time Dean made it home and tossed his keys on the side table, he noticed Jo had texted him a link to her Spotify playlist. He immediately clicked on it and connected to the bluetooth speakers in his kitchen as he rummaged through his fridge, finally settling on a frozen pizza for dinner. He set the oven to pre-heat at 350 and settled in at the counter, holding a beer close to his chest while he caught up on all the notifications on his phone he missed throughout the day at work. He allowed the music to pull him in, not resisting, not straining to get more of it now that he had it, just basking in it while he decompressed from his day. When the oven finally beeped that it was ready, he slid the pizza in and then plopped himself down on his couch.
It seemed Castiel picked the right spot in the set for them to take their breather, allowing them to rest during the slightly calmer songs. But now, it felt like they were ramping back up again in energy and tempo. The crowd responded in kind, with Dean and Cas right there with them, eager to scream along to “If Ever I Stray.” The song ended and Frank started directing the audience to clear out the pit. He wanted to see a circle pit, he said, a massive one. People around them scrambled to comply and somehow Dean and Castiel ended up on the edge of the circle on one side.
“Great. I’ll add you on here so we can keep in touch!”
Sometimes. Sometimes crowd surfing, too. It’s likely that will happen at our show but if it makes you uncomfortable we can make sure we’re not by those parts of the crowd when that happens.
“Want to check out the merch table?,” Cas asked as he turned to Dean. He shrugged and nodded back, following the dark mess of hair down a flight of stairs to a lounge area with an even bigger bar sitting at its’ center. Along the far wall down here was a series of folding tables set up with merchandise for sale from Jenny Owen Youngs and Frank Turner. They headed for Jenny’s table, surprised to find her selling her own merch to the group of fans in front of them. They both ended up buying CDs, which Jenny autographed for them. As Dean turned to leave, he heard Cas ask her for a photo.
Dean hastily licked the ketchup off his fingers and wiped the rest on his permanently grease-stained jeans. Sure enough, waiting in a corner of the Facebook messenger app that Dean didn’t even know existed, was a message for him. That was sent yesterday!
Dean turned back to Cas and nodded, he did want to go further into the crowd. To become one with them all. Castiel grabbed his wrist again and the two started to snake their way past the outer edges of the audience to make their way further up towards the center. When he found a place he was satisfied with, he turned around to check in with Dean, raising a thumbs up in silent question, “is this good?” Dean nodded and returned the gesture, just in time to join in singing for the big refrain:
Kate looked up quickly, having finally found the cards, and gave each man one. “Oh my GOD! You’re going to have the best time! Is it your first gig, too?,” she asked Cas.
The venue was swarming. Somehow, in the short time they had been downstairs, the room had filled up substantially. Dean tipped his head back to try to get a better view of the balcony, and it appeared just as packed, if not more so, than the main level did. He took a steadying breath, a little overwhelmed by the sold-out crowd and the uncertainty that came with anything new that was highly anticipated.
Ok, fine. The song is good. Isn’t this who Jo won’t shut up about?
Dean blinked a few times, stunned, and then dipped his chin to smile to himself. The mention of a father’s car being built to last, as his own pride and joy was his dad’s, was like a punch to his chest that he was not expecting in the slightest. The opening verse reminded him of his favorite kinds of days; out on the open road with good tunes and better company with the windows down and the wind whipping through your hair. He turned towards Cas, who was bouncing his head to the tempo and smiling softly. “Do you know her?,” he half-shouted, in order to be heard over the music and murmur of the crowd, nodding towards the stage.
