"Alright," John said. He needed to get ahold of that as soon as possible. Not because he was in any hurry to follow the rules written there, but to be able to devise ways to get around them. He was mulling over this when Anthea lead him towards the building a little to the left of the soccer field.
. All muscular shoulders and thighs and strong calves and oh – Sherlock has never felt this way before. He was wrong. There was absolutely nothing similar about his previous experience to this. His eyes ran up and down John. He couldn’t look away even if he wanted to. He was gone.
They both stopped and grinned, Sherlock realizing it was the first time John had said his name. He also realized he liked it. A lot.
“It was for a case,” Sherlock said. John heard him shuffle around the living room and walk towards the kitchen.
John slept soundly, albeit colorfully. He dreamed of dark hair and sad eyes and an intense need to protect. When he found consciousness, it was with a heavy heart.
After a few more seconds, feeling like a pervert all the while, Sherlock finally tore his gaze away from his new friend. He turned and started fussing with his things, slightly panicking. What should he do? Should he say hi? Let John know he was there? It would be weird if he didn’t, right? Would not saying anything make him seem more-
The night Sherlock had was fitful and restless. His erratic bouts of unconsciousness were filled with strong hands and blue eyes and smiles that made his cold heart ache. He awoke with fits and starts, willing himself to forget. Surprisingly, this
“You up for an early shower, too?” John was smiling at him. He was still showering and this time, he turned towards Sherlock.
Their eyes met as Sherlock shook his hand. John blinked. He felt a warmth spread across his chest, short-circuiting his brain and making his mouth dry.
She moved even closer and put her hand on John’s knee. “I’m doing okay. I miss hanging out with you.”
Greg had just closed the door when Molly said, “Sorry your plans were ruined.” She smiled at him sympathetically as she settled on the floor, back against the side of the bed.
John threw a pillow over Sherlock’s crotch area and moved even closer, totally dumbfounded. Why was his flatmate drunk? Did something happen? Was this for a case?
At the end of the year, they were living together at 221B Baker Street; Sherlock still indifferent to other people except John, and John still… well, bisexual.
Sherlock winced from the contact, barely acknowledging the taunts and the slowly increasing volume of laughter.
“C’mon, John,” she murmured. “I know you’re not dating anybody… And I miss you…” She started to kiss his neck.
John and Sherlock have arrived in Somerset to investigate the murder of an American Governor on request of a young and naive police detective, the body on the beach provides clues however John misses a vital piece of information that only Sherlock can spot arousing questions in them both.
Lestrade sat at his desk with both his feet crossed atop his desk, a coffee in his right hand and a jam donut in the other. It made John lick his lips. On Sherlock’s entrance Lestrade nearly choked. Through a mouthful of dough and jam he scoffed “Sherlock you are not allowed to be here! Mycroft will kill me! And I mean actually kill me, dead as a door! There will be one of his sparrows here with a bullet with my name on it!”
“Right so, would you rather always have to say everything on your mind or never be able to speak again?” Sherlock didn’t even have to take a breath.
Sherlock stood and marched off into the oncoming maelstrom away from the cold wash he’d just been given.
“Agreed. Now my question John.” John didn’t know it but Sherlock very much wanted to win this game, and in his mind, him winning was for John to drink a lot more than him.
As John proceeded to pour the milk, stir the tea and bring it over daintily to where Sherlock sat, Sherlock said something that nearly made John spill the boiling liquid all over them both.
“I’m a soldier man, do you think I am not used to nakedness? I have had weirder patients than you, if you had to do therapy naked I would let you, anything that gets you to the chair I don’t give a flying fuck. Come on Detective Holmes, get to the chair, naked or not, your choice.” John left the room at that point and Sherlock struggled to put on a dressing gown before following after John to his office.
John looked up to meet grey eyes, "did he put money towards the creation of this?" Sherlock nodded slow and concise. "Sherlock, he funded the beginning of war." Sherlock nodded gravely once more then spoke softly, "it appears obvious now why his life fell apart, left the church certain he'd get a huge chunk of that black gold, divorced when that didn't work out, joined politics to ensure his safety, I imagine once Barack came into presidency his views would be forced to scatter, he was on a path John, he managed to get his hands on this documentation once more and has fled with it, hoping it'll save him, maybe hoping to use it to black mail later on, the question is were his murderers aware of this, and if so were they assigned to him to end his life off American soil, and if yes, who by? Them leaving this all suggests no but he's too involved that it thwarts any other motives." John began to pace, paper still in hand, thinking so hard he felt a headache coming on. "There's more." With the younger mans words, John stopped pacing, and he inched closer to the pages once more. Sherlock pointed to one directly in the middle, John unafraid leaned down to study it. He understood this one, "the French government knew about it." Sherlock uttered a woeful "yes." John stood upright as comic as a meerkat.
‘The Langbury’ was atop a hill facing out to sea. It was large and the white night lights made it much more intimidating that the orange mellow of the streets below. There were not even any moths flitting about in awe of the electronic beams. The door had been left open for the two of them, clearly someone knew they’d be in late or they were just extremely trusting hotel owners. A teenage lad sat at reception with his face squashed into his palm, eyes closed breathing heavy. Clearly John wasn’t the only one who wished for sleep. Without any consideration at all Sherlock pinged the bell and the boy awoke with a start and immediately went into job mode, “good evening, welcome to the Langbury where we offer exclusive services such as spa days and even tours of this historic town called mine head, how can I be of assistance today?” He said it all as if it were the same word. John was almost certain he was just sleeping talking, his eyes were so heavy and his head was slowly swaying. John knew how he felt. Sherlock spoke as if it was still midday, not a syllable dragged, “Rooms for Sherlock Holmes and John Watson please.” Then all of a sudden the receptionist sprang to life, he sat up straight and his eyes widened, “you are that detective bloke from London! It is a pleasure to meet you! I love a good crime story me, yeah, you must be here about the beach murder then? Who did it? Actually who is it, no one even knows that yet! Must be someone big if you are here!” He laughed nervously and Sherlock did nothing to ease it. Both Sherlock and John merely stared, not amused. John raised an eyebrow and spoke in a knackered drawl, “if you don’t mind it’s late and we have to be up early, so if we could just have the keys to our rooms…”
John continued, “before reporting her death to the police did you move Eleanor from her place of death?” Henry hesitantly nodded, “did you dress her and apply make up to her face?” Another hesitantly nod, “did you brush her hair and place her in her bed?” Another nod. “How was she before you moved her?” Now it was Sherlock that was lying back and John that was leaning on his elbows. Henry spoke slow, soft and afraid, “I let myself in with my key to hers, she’d just got back from Shanghai, the trading’s I mentioned in my letter, she’d been with them, doing what she did, as soon as I found her, like that I blamed them, the gang, the smugglers, so after I wrote the letter and sent it to you I went out there, to confront them, they say it wasn’t them, they said they’d do anything to discover who it was, it seems I wasn’t the only one who loved her.” Now Henry took a sigh to truly answer John’s question. “She was naked, face down on the floor, she looked afraid, her eyes were really wide and her mouth open, I’d never seen bruises so fresh, she was still,” now a tear rolled down his cheek and he stuttered out the final words, “she was still warm. I debated calling the police immediately but she would have loathed to be found like that. So I couldn’t leave her as she was, so I did my best.” Sherlock said matter of fact, “you realise that your tampering makes it difficult to find a murderer don’t you?” He nodded and with a weak smile Henry added, “that’s why I contacted you mister Holmes, you’d be able to figure it out regardless.” Sherlock ignored the flattery and he had a burning question he needed an answer to, “why bring a lawyer in today if you didn’t do it?” Henry wiped his face of salt water and actually laughed, “Because ‘Sherlock Holmes’ is intimidating. I was afraid, that’s all, Mark is… was a friend.” The smile faded and the three of them sat for a while. It was probably ten seconds maximum but it felt like a millennia whilst they just sat there. Henry asked hesitantly, “So who did it?” Sherlock and John looked at one another, then back at Henry, then at the same moment both said, “We thought it was you.” Henry was appalled and exclaimed “me?! How could you think I did it?!” Sherlock rolled his eyes and said, “half brother lawyer cheating on his wife with his sister, also involved in the same smuggling gang as the victim, oh yeah such a difficult leap.” John loved it when Sherlock was sarcastic, in another circumstance he would have laughed. Then Sherlock did something strange, he repeated himself, something he detested doing, “half brother lawyer cheating on his wife with his sister, wife with his sister, wife with his sister.” Sherlock looked at John with wonder in his eye, then things happened very fast, he looked back at Henry and asked without really wanting an answer, “Henry, tea? Coffee? I’m dying for one myself, John let’s get coffee, we’ll be back soon Henry, it’s okay don’t panic we know it wasn’t you.” Sherlock pulled John, the folder and its contents from their seated positions to then be dragged out of the door. On the door closing, all John could say was “what the fuck was that! We fucked it up! Shit, jesus, who did it if not him oh god! We have no other leads!” Lestrade came out of the door with the one sided window in the same fashion, and the three men stood in the corridor, two only giving expletives and the other in deep thought. After a moment of loudness Sherlock said even louder, “shut up! Mind palace!” John and Sherlock had talked about the mind palace in therapy many moons ago but he was yet to see it in action. He ceased everything and stood completely still like a puppy who’s just been caught stealing from the cupboard.
Sherlock nodded and ended pacing on John’s final word, stopping at the body and looking down at her cold form. “Do you think she’s beautiful John?”
Sherlock ignored John’s exclamation. “Educated backs up the fact that they may be in some powerful position, rewards also usually come from upper-class, middle if we’re lucky. So they are influential and rich. Potentially a politician who’s been hiding the fact they have a secret failure of a sister. Maybe a clergyman who has a daughter who left the church in a crime obsessed rage. Maybe a well-known actor with a bastard daughter that his wife doesn’t know about. Or maybe just a friend wanting to see justice for their murdered lover. Who knows!”
Mycroft looked down at his manicured cuticles for he knew the next thing that needed to be said would not be received kindly. Once clearing his throat he said “I’ve told Lestrade that he is not permitted to give you any cases until you have successfully finished your treatment.”
"What if they paid these Americans to murder Delaney, say they were his bodyguards or something, if Parisian congress is involved, then they may have known of whatever Delaney's plans were, hell he may have been a flight risk from the start, walked round for the past fifteen years with a big red 'X' marked on his back, if they knew he was visiting England to visit his mothers grave they could have paid a big enough fee to persuade these Aryan Americans to kill him off, makes sense then that they've travelled to France, pick up their pay check" Sherlock listened all the while, "Sherlock you were right, they are headed to Paris."
“What are the facts dear Watson?” The change of sound made John stop his automatic pace, the men stood still, facing one another. Maybe a meter apart, Sherlock measured it to be three feet exactly. John took a single step, watching his feet as he did so, closing the gap to two feet now he took to looking his detective in the face. John took a deep breath, bare foot and now full of tea he was finally ready to crack this thing. “We have the initial letter from anonymous, full of details and clues itself, proved by the finance statements and letters in mandarin we found later, we think anonymous to be the half-brother, lawyer…”
Sherlock took a sip of water and shuffled in his chair for a moment. “Cocaine gave me a hit unlike anything else, I have taken it in every form but straight into the veins gives the largest amount of focus. It’s like injecting petrol into a well-oiled engine. It makes me go without any quandary; I can focus entirely on the work and I can almost forget that I am as human as the police officers and the cadavers I work with.”
Holy bananas. What should I write about next? Should I continue this fic? Start another one? Let me know pleaaase.
On reaching Scotland Yard on 8-10 Broadway, John witnessed Sherlock rather gracefully propel himself over a fence. John moved with too much momentum to stop himself from attempting the same. He ended up awkwardly flipping himself over and landing on his back on the concrete. Sherlock turned just before reaching the front door to make a brief smirk before continuing through the spinning doors. He really did like John. John sighed on his back before jumping up and following after Sherlock. Thank god that limp was gone.
He waded into the bar space from the night before, he headed over to the table at which they sat. A couple sat at this table now, munching upon breakfast, "move I need to go to my mind palace." Both looked as if Sherlock had just slapped their grandmothers and then taken his dick out, he used his hands in large exaggerated movements, "MOVE." Grabbing their croissants, they left frantic and terrified. Sherlock sat where he had only hours before. Where was his phone. He tapped his hands upon the crumbed table and felt the device spinning under his fingertips. It was here last, he was fidgeting with it. Then as he was leaving he put it in his belstaff pocket and tipped the barman. The bar. He leaped to its surface and was huddled over it in seconds, and by this point the entire breakfast buffet had become an audience. He ran his hands over its sticky plateau, skating to find where he had put the money. A sniff and a lick next to a beer mat confirmed where he had placed the blue euro note. He should not have drunk as much as he did. By the time he had left that room his phone was not in his pocket, and someone had removed it at the very spot he now stood. "Tu!" he bellowed to the same barman from the night before, "qui d'autre était ici hier soir?!"
His legs lay beneath him and he was reduced to a pathetic sprawl. An undignified action that Sherlock knew he did not deserve.
"Where is Redbeard?" Sherlock asked for what felt like the one hundredth time that morning, "you know where he is darling, stop insinuating that we go get him, he's too big for the plane sweet heart" spoke his mother. Sherlock huffed and placed his squidgy face on her shoulder so as not to look at any of them. What he was able to see was the many people rushing about the airport terminal, trying their hardest to get to wherever they needed to be. All moved at the same pace, regardless of if their flight was to be off in seconds or not for many hours. "Where are we going?" Mycroft was speaking with some urgency now, and he was almost being dragged by his father by the sheer pace they were going. "Myc' you figured out where we were going before we booked the tickets, why are you asking?" Their father was kind, but impatience was getting the better of him. Mycroft's little palms were starting to get clammy, he was scared of flying, he had been since he could remember, but no one else ever knew this, he thought in acting dumb they'd worry and turn around, or at least pause. He confessed it was minute probability but he had not said anything dumb since he was Sherlock's age, maybe they'd just notice. "It's a very long flight" was his only manic reply.
John knew he was right of course, he went to place his hands on the ground in order to help himself stand but Sherlock stopped him, “no! We can’t have any fingerprints mixing with whatever could be on deck, I realize we have just rolled around but let’s not change anything more.” John nodded, then awkwardly tried to raise himself without using his hands, it proved tricky so Sherlock grabbed one of his arms and together they stood. They smiled at one another once more, still not quite over what hilarity had just passed. It was a memory both were to treasure for many years.
They both still had their coats on so there was no need for faffing around. They walked straight to the door and Sherlock left the residence first with a sudden spring in his step. John was his friend again. That is all that mattered. Maybe they could solve another mystery before the night was over. After all Lestrade knew he lived now so maybe he would ring with a case. John was a little more hesitant, and anger still sat at the pit of his stomach. To almost give himself the potential for an excuse he faced Mary in the doorway “Are you sure?” Mary simply nodded and gave his face a small pinch; “Yes husband I am.”
On seeing Sherlock enter Molly immediately brushed her hair behind her ears with her fingers. “Hi Sherlock” she said whilst her cheeks turned pink. On John’s entrance she became even shyer about the whole thing, her wide smile dimmed and worry got stuck in her eyes.
John’s breathing was erratic and audible. He wanted to hide, everything in him wanted to hide, pull the duvet cover over his head and be in the ignorant bliss of denial telling himself over and over 'this is all just a dream.' Instead he sat stock still like a wax work unable to make a noise. He went to stammer but was cut off by an obvious command from one of the gun swindlers. It was in Mandarin so John had no idea what was being said. “John, he’s told me to tell you to get some clothes on, and once you’ve done that get down on your knees in front of the bed.”
"Yes I know, tortured, neglected, I was near pneumonia, malnutrition blah blah blah it doesn't make a difference! The case John, this is what I was saying, it defies all! Eleanor is dead and we need to solve her murder, it's our job."
Sherlock began to pace, from Molly who stood maybe five feet away, back to Eleanor. Back and forth like a tiger in a zoo.
After what felt like an age, an arch lay ahead, above it read, 'l'empire de la mort.' John understood enough to know that that meant 'the empire of the dead.' As he stepped beneath it, he felt his blood run cold. He heard voices bounce around the walls, excited children fascinated by such a gruesome sight. John weaved around the underground maze, looking intently for the heart made out of skulls. What if he couldn't find it? Was this all just some rouse to get him out the way? But why? He checked his phone, the hour was minutes from being up, he picked up his pace. All of a sudden bones and skulls sat delicately stacked, high enough that they were taller than John himself, they seemed to go further back than the eye could see, enclosed in darkness. As a doctor he could name every one, femurs sat with femurs, tibias with tibias, fibulas, clavicles, humerus, ulnas, Radius, and skulls. So many skulls. John could feel the hollow eye sockets stare at nothing and only at him. All arranged in an immoral pattern for no reason other than morbid fascination and a need for space above ground. Checking the time, he was now officially late to supposedly rescue his friend. Or to die.
John sat up straight and his face turned aggressive, like a pit-bull who just smelled fresh meat. “This man next to me, too weak to look me or you for that matter in the eye, his brother is THE British Government, without Britain your country would be nowhere, our trade and empire made your country what it is, if you kill us whether that be now or any point in the future, the British Government will ensure that each and everyone of you are stamped out with an efficiency that will terrify any sane man. So not only will you let us go and never harm us in the future, you will answer our questions.”
“Now John, you’re going to meet an associate of mine, Molly Hooper, she works with cadavers. She is simple and is completely besotted with me, hence simple. The fact that she has affection for me however, proves very effective in time sensitive matters such as what we find ourselves in now.”
John panicked, his eyes flickered to the door, waiting for Sherlock to float in and fix this mess he'd made himself, "no, no that's not what I said, don't quote me on any of this!" With that the reporter stood and walked triumphantly out of his seat and headed for the door. En route however, he met Sherlock who had heard enough of the conversation whilst walking towards the bustling breakfast room. "Good morning deceitful journalist, you can print Delaney was murdered and you can also print that Detective Sherlock Holmes and Captain Doctor John Watson are on the case, have a nice day" spoke Sherlock with not a shred of sincerity. John sighed with relief, he wasn't in trouble after all. Sherlock left the man standing in limbo before hurrying out of the room. As Sherlock sat at the table, John asked rather than providing a pleasant greeting, "why'd you do that?" A tea pot arrived and John thanked the smartly dressed gentlemen and as Sherlock began to pour them both a mugful he said, "with us involved, and confirmed involved, they are less likely to focus on the actual murder, but instead they'll focus on you and I, they'll most likely assume we're lovers, especially likely due to the fact that we did in fact share a bed last night, we live together, you were my doctor and you're a military man , several kinks many are attracted towards and to top it all off we do actually look like a couple that could work, it's brilliant, people John, gold fish are so distracted by gossip they can't actually focus on what matters. Milk?" John's jaw was practically scuffing against the table top. "Sherlock, I'm not sure if I want the public involved in my... our sex lives." Sherlock raised an eyebrow and said as a joke, "oh so we do have a sex life now?" They laughed before a waiter interrupted with "are you ready to order?" John shook off his slip up and said, "full english please," Sherlock said the "same" and the man asked how they like their eggs, at the same time both men said, "sunny side up" before sharing a surprised smile. As the gent walked away John wondered if that would be quoted in tomorrows papers.
Sherlock focused on the pages in front of him, “Oh not sure just picked it up really.” John was so enthralled he couldn’t focus on anything but Sherlock’s face, “people just don’t ‘pick up’ Mandarin Sherlock!”
“Yes quite, she definitely had money, anonymous was right about that, bear in mind she only has an apartment in this building, but even a floor of that building is spacious.”
This reunion with Lestrade was not what he had planned. His intentions were to meet with him in private, something that Sherlock couldn’t consider with his excitement to see John again. He wanted to surprise and impress his only friend. He believed that John would be only joyful. Maybe Sherlock wasn’t human after all. Why could he not just be more like a gold fish? John had him believe that he had the potential, if not had become empathetic. It seems in the mutiny of loneliness he had lost it all. All that John had pieced together and shaped of him. Lost with that jump from St. Barts.
About ten seconds after the door closed Sherlock keeled over in pain. He rolled onto his back and moaned in agony. John became the army doctor again. No resources and a wounded soldier. This used to be what he lived for.
The drive proved fairly arduous and mostly exhausting. Sherlock and John were now much more comfortable sharing this tight vehicular space after John's kind words atop the mound splayed at the side of the road. Eight hours and fifty five minutes dragged by before reaching an end point. There was traffic all the way to Dover, including dead stands at points on the motorways and several bouts of road rage from Sherlock (of which John was surprised by.) An agonising wait at the ferry port was particularly stressful. Most dull were the people that 'helped' them, to the point that for once John agreed utterly with every begrudging comment Sherlock made about the employees. They were sloths in neon jackets, flailing arms as way of direction advice and slurred sentence quips that resulted in nothing other than confusion and chaos. Eventually they were on the ferry, one of the last ones to leave dock. It was only then that both parties began to relax. John felt that initially excitement about an investigation across the channel seep back into his now tired bones.
Sherlock now stood about a meter from the bed and he had both of his hands in the air in what could only be described as submission. At this point in time there were six people all in black, faces covered, pointing guns at both Sherlock and John. Sherlock was perfectly calm, or at least he appeared to be, and he continued to attempt to keep John calm, “John everything is going to be alright.”
The upward curve of a smile on Mycroft’s face and the calm tone was deceived by the sadness of his eyes and the severity of his words. Brothers finally arrived at eye contact and Sherlock new he was in fact serious; this was no longer a game. In rivalry Sherlock really had lost the altruistic connection to his brother, yet Mycroft remained empathetic to his brother, always had and always will.
The board's orange glow shaped letters informed the pair that their train was in thirteen minutes. Sherlock asked John to go and get their tickets, John asked "why me?  What are you doing that is so important?" Sherlock rolled his eyes, "John just get the tickets, here." Sherlock handed John a card from his wallet but John furrowed his brow, "no I'll get them." John began to walk away in a mild huff but Sherlock chased him and nudged his arm, "John it's the card for the joint account, the work account." Sherlock raised his eyebrows in a 'take it' suggestion. John sighed, he'd forgotten about the joint account. When he took the card he realised that he didn't know the pin number but Sherlock beat the question, he grabbed John's arm once more and put his mouth close to his ear. He breathed in John's ear, "1971," John felt the tingle of the breath move down his neck and shake his spine. Then he realised, this was the year of his own birth. Sherlock surely didn't create an account with him in mind, would he? John pulled his face away, both hands remained connected through the thin piece of plastic that made their cases a reality. John's confusion clearly showed, "yes John I'm aware that is the year of your birth, thought it would be easy for you to remember." With that Sherlock was away, heading back towards the boards or wherever he apparently needed to be. John could not move for a second, he really let his romantic side take over it seemed. He blushed and the heat in his face forced him to turn away from his friends general direction towards the ticket machines.
John breathed deep, the air smelt new, different, then he realised, he was in fucking Paris, he sat up quickly. For a moment, he was youthful and prepared for anything, then the twang of his head thwacked against his skull. It had been a heavy night, he knew it was a success though, he felt no anxiety, which was nice considering a hangover usually always twinned with regret. He rubbed his temple with his fingers as he threw off the covers. Almost immediately his phone buzzed, loud and inconsiderate, the screen read 'Sherlock' in big black letters. He was ringing which was unusual, he always preferred to text, John answered, "Sherlock I..." before John could say one more word he heard a voice that was definitely not Sherlock's, "we have your friend, we know you two are snooping, you've been following us, we have your friend, and we will give him back if you agree to stop following us, otherwise we will have to kill you." John was shunned into momentary silence, "where can we meet?" There was a pleased sigh at the other end, "meet at the catacombs in one hour, he will be by the heart made from skulls, don't be an idiot." The phone cut out and John was already down the stairs when it did. He ran out the hotel front doors and was in a Parisian taxi in seconds.
Sherlock let out a bone-chilling scream as the knot swelled inside of him. It was bigger than he could ever imagine. He needed it out! He tried to pull forward only to find John holding him down hard.
Relax? How was he supposed to relax? He had a dildo shoved up his ass and had just been given some mystery pills.
He opened the lid and squirted a large amount onto his large erection. He was in too much of a hurry to prepare his lover with his fingers. He was used to being taken by it so he shouldn’t have a problem.
The massive bollocks and knot were covered in the wolf’s coarse earth-brown pubic hairs, making a delicious sight as they knocked ruthlessly against Sherlock’s ripe ass, which jiggled and bounced partly from the harsh impacts.
The bunny let out a long moan as he accepted the position he was in. He was on his hands and knees getting water injected into his intestines. There was was nothing he could do about it. He might as well accept it and enjoy it. He carefully spread his legs and tried to get his body to relax.
him. Sherlock wanted him in front of all those people. He wanted them to know who he belonged to. He had consented to this before but now he
The pale bunny was already gagging badly as the cock plunged and stretched open his mouth. But he somehow managed to take it. It immediately began pummeling deep inside his throat, forcing its entry for the wolf’s pleasure and the bunny’s pain. Every time a cramp hit his body he would try to cry out which was deeply muffled by the enormous inches of the invading member. The motion of Sherlock crying out in pain sent vibrations of pleasure all through John’s lust-filled body. Tears were starting to leak from the corners of the bunny’s light blue eyes and drool was leaking out of his mouth.
Sherlock wanted to demand to be released but he couldn't. John was happy. He was making John happy. That was enough to get him through the pain. He was grateful that John still had the cuffs on him. If they weren’t then he would have found a way to free himself from his prison.
John was having his Friday drink with his fox friend. His fellow canine seemed awful interested in his lover.
Sherlock’s nails dug into John's skin even deeper as he felt his orgasm approaching. For a moment the universe was whole around him. No stress. No one judging their relationship. No cases that needed to be solved. It was the only the two of them locked together in an act of ultimate pleasure and love.
“Our sex sessions can get pretty rough,” the wolf explained. “I need to know you can handle something as simple as this.”
She was still going full steam when John came to tuck her in.  To her surprise, he was carrying a new bag.
If Sherlock was a female wolf he would be filling him with pups. It irritated him a bit that he could never produce pups with his mate but it was something he could live with. He loved Sherlock regardless.
Sherlock gave a resigned whimper. He knew fighting with his wolf would do no good. The doctor knelt down next to Sherlock and began to lubricate a rather large nozzle. He put the nozzle at his bunny’s entrance and began to push.
bunny. Yet, he couldn’t help but feel turned on. He liked the idea of showing his little bunny off. Sherlock was capable of taking so much.
“Luna,” he said suddenly causing John to jump. “Rosie hasn’t mentioned her and she hasn’t been over. The two of them are having trouble.”
While he was trying to mentally scream at his body to listen he felt his knot deflating even more. He cried out in relief as it slipped free from Sherlock’s body.
The bunny began to shake slightly as he laid down on the bed. He felt very nervous about what they were getting ready to do. He trusted John not put his life in any danger but that didn’t make any less scary. He felt his heart began to race as John climbed on him.
All of this photos are from pexels and pixabay. They are nice sites for free images. The backpack is my own picture. That is my own back pack. I got it from aliexpress (it's a cheap, direct from china site). I knew it was going to be a galaxy backpack but I wasn't expecting the British flag. I knew I had to use it for something.
John felt like he was going to run out of oxygen as he claimed what was his. His lungs were starting to burn. Sherlock was arching and writhing on his monster cock.
John went out and bought new hand and ankle cuffs. Medical grade padded cuffs. They would make the process so much easier for both of them. He bought a sex wedge and attached the cuffs to the side. The wedge would make sure his pet was in a perfect position and the cuffs would hold him there.
The detective decided that maybe he was better off helping his lover than worrying. He crossed over to the sink and started placing dishes in the warm water.
Happy with that Rosie put her phone away. She lite up one of her cigarettes and took a deep drag from it. She smiled as smoke filled her lungs and went back to studying. She didn't think she needed to ask for cigarettes. Karen was pretty nice about giving her cigarettes when she wanted them.
A few kids were gathering around the scene. Rosie felt her heart race as all eyes fell on her. What had she done? She’d hurt Luna and she was in a lot of trouble.
“I’ll you another bottle with formula in a bit,” John said bringing down a hand to play with his ears. “Have you slept at all?”
The fox smirked as he began to pound inside of the bunny tight little ass. The bunny wailed and clung to his lover's broad chest and shoulders. The most intense pressure was building inside of him. It felt like their knots were starting to grow. They were both going to knot!
His wolf had ordered him to the bathroom. Sherlock walked into the bathroom and knelt down inside of the tube. He knew if he put up a fight he would just get spanked and he would still have to take the enema.
Before John tried again he grabbed a hold of the handcuffs with one hand. He was more than willing to help the detective stay in place. He added a little more lube to the toy before he picked it up again. Carefully, he started he started pushing the toy inside.
John smirked as he pushed Sherlock down on his cock. No matter how many times he took him the bunny always felt tight as a vise.
Sherlock began to whimper as the tool was slid forward. No matter how many times they used that particular tool it still hurt. John began to play with Sherlock’s fluffy white little cottontail. That action always seemed to calm the bunny down.
Sherlock remained stood tucking his shirt into his trousers. He’d been through quite an ordeal it seems. Coldness seemed to have taken over his tall form. Drugs had spent a large time manipulating Sherlock’s life, especially in the past few years. Work was all he had, much to his brothers concern. The addict’s eyes cast to the floor in an obvious attempt to avoid the elephant in the room. Mycroft watched his brother intently, continuously noting that his appearance was troublesome. Undernourished was the first thing that came to the political mind. His cheeks had hollowed making every word and expression dramatically jut out just as much as the detective’s collarbones. His hair was longer than usual and his pale complexion had changed to an ill unwashed yellow, no longer was there that moonlit glow dancing from his brother’s skin.
On seeing Sherlock, all of the staff they passed either audibly sighed or rolled their eyes. There was a collective ‘here comes trouble.’ Sherlock it seems had single handedly made the police of London work in a mutual understanding, all because they were less intelligent than he. And Sherlock wasn’t even getting paid for it, nor did he ever have the agenda to make the police work as a group without divide.
Sherlock could tell all of this by the smallest of details. Even mannerisms. And the speed! Sherlock probably figured out the darkest secrets of around thirty people before he’d finished his Americano. They checked in and went through security with nothing noteworthy happening, and the people watching game continued even once the two men had taken their adjacent seats on the plane.
Immediately without hesitation Sherlock moved the pawn that was allocated in front of his King from D2 to D3. Now the space on the board was starting to free up. John felt a pang of excitement to see Sherlock’s king exposed.
Sherlock’s toes wriggled in his shoes. He watched them through the leather as the words pulled from his gums.
Sherlock gazed directly in front of him looking the most concentrated John had ever seen a person. He spoke as if alone, John wondered briefly if Sherlock did that alone, rolled off his ideas as if in a dialogue, even if he was alone. “The language also suggests that they are educated...” John shot a slightly confused look, Sherlock looked irritated about having to explain himself “regards, array, all of, knowledge, particularly, inform…”
John, Anderson and Sherlock arrive at the apartment of a dead woman to discover she had a very curious hobby...
On entering the building Sherlock hesitated at the bottom of the stairs. It was a sort of hallway. Just a large set of stairs with a wooden door bearing a lock at the top of the stairs. At the bottom of the stairs lay checkered flooring and nothing but a cupboard under the stairs that would fit in the Harry Potter series, and another front door. It was a patterned glass that made looking through unclear. You would be able to see colours and movement but nothing specific. It was dark and dormant beyond the glass. No neighbours it seemed. There was a bicycle against the wall; it looks like it had been unused for a while, as it had nearly made a permanent imprint on the eggshell white wallpaper behind it. On making quick deductions about his surroundings Sherlock pointed up towards the top of the carpeted stairs.
“You keep your nails short and your hair irrefutably in place, some may say it was the army that made you this way but the childhood pictures about this room tell me otherwise. Suggesting that you like things in a certain way, you need control, if there is no order in your life you spiral, a very human thing to do. You walk bare foot and you speak your mind, so you are confident and competent in all you attempt to do. I imagine on your signing up to the army there was no control in your life, everything was everywhere and there was nothing that could be done about it. A family death maybe, someone close to you was ill or maybe you were just too bogged down with the big questions no person can comprehend. Either way you needed escape, but it had to be specific, planned, nothing less than controlled. You may have considered other professions initially such as Doctor, hence why you are here right now, but it proved long hours and it didn’t satisfy the clear addiction to adrenaline you have yourself. So then the army, structured and a rush all at once. You feel the chase just as much as I do Watson, which is why coming on a case with me is a most splendid idea. Your move.”
By this stage Sherlock had finished his drink and he took a piece of ice into his mouth on the last gulp and chewed on it loudly. John gave a surprised disapproving look, Sherlock pulled his head back, almost near enough to head butt the window behind him, "what?! The cold and the hardness of it helps me think." John giggled, "I have never met anyone who has eaten ice like that before."
“Nothing is easy John.”  So the two men attempted to entertain themselves, or attempted to sleep mostly (to no avail,) for the next twelve hours of their flight. They talked about their intentions on arriving in Shanghai occasionally. Both companies did some reading about the locations and the economy of China. Research was always good. Preparation was important, and John especially liked feeling ready for whatever he was about to face.
Ignoring the sarcasm Sherlock continued his line of thought whilst John moved his own pawn from E7 to E5 so that it was placed directly in front of Sherlock’s moved pawn. “War. The game originates from India; the translation of the original name translates as ‘four divisions’, as in of the military; infantry, cavalry, elephantry and chariotry.” As Sherlock spoke the four divisions he pointed to the various pieces on the board. John watched his fingers as they followed the words that soothed from his lips. “Humanity needs war just as much as chess requires a board. None of us know why we are here, yet we are driven by some innate purpose to do something. War gives people that purpose; it satisfies that burning question of why are we here."
On John’s returning he asked Sherlock, “you not need to go?” to which his companion replied, “I went around an hour ago I think.” John hummed before realizing, “how’d you get out? You’re in the middle seat?!” Sherlock made a half shrug and said, “I just climbed over you, and you didn’t even flinch, I nearly fell into your lap at one point as well.” John was surprised at how that image didn’t even disturb him. He felt pretty comfortable with the idea actually. He shook his head as if to get the idea physically thrown out through his ears.
“The man you have just proceeded to torture, for god knows how long, is not only a dear friend of mine, he is also a man of huge influence.”
With slight relief Sherlock took an awaited inhale of breath and squandered over John’s question. “Well, John my estimate would be most likely escape.”
Then just like that there he was. Down a corridor talking to someone in his department with some impatience. Files in hand. On seeing Sherlock and John he threw his arms in the air, wide as if he was trying to reach the corners of the room. Unashamedly he exclaimed "Thank God! Finally you bastards are here! You both look exhausted. Shit, you okay?" The two nodded, and John was happy to see Lestrade, he was always pleasant, or at least he had been so far. "The case..." Sherlock began, "we've reached a dead end here, we are going to get his hand writing when he comes in some how, but we haven't been able to do much without..." Lestrade went to say 'you' but stopped himself, especially in front of his colleagues, and well, Sherlock. Sherlock completely ignored what was being said and spoke hurriedly, "when are you bringing him in?"
It was at this point that John broke down. The fact that Sherlock was in arms reach the entire time made the entire ordeal worse. He could have been behind him in a queue somewhere and never even noticed all because he hadn’t turned around. He felt betrayed and deeply uninvolved. Tears rolled down his angry cheeks.
“So their co-operation ended there. As did her life.” Sherlock sighed and then concluded, "my statement was her everyday spendings, ate well, she travelled a lot understandably, mainly first class with British Airways, lots of currency exchanges, Yen obviously. It all matches up."
Sherlock stayed out of it. After all this was not his home. This was not quite his John as it was two years ago either. He shuffled his feet anxiously. If he were completely honest with himself he would prefer to have some private time with John. The self-admission made his eyes cast to the floor.
Sherlock knew it immediately, it only took four beats, "California Soul by Marlena Shaw." His face was like that of a proud peacock. "Right yes, yeah, your turn." Sherlock sat for a bit longer than twenty seconds but he gave a clearly nervous, "yes alright" before he began a very sweet hum. John tried not to laugh he really did, he bit his tongue and tried to focus on the road, as if he was intently trying to recognise the song in Sherlocks shaky hum. After maybe fifteen seconds of humming Sherlock stopped and said an impatient, "well?!" John shook his head violently from side to side with a very restrained smile. Every muscle in his face was aching from its constraint. He cleared his throat and said, "Sherlock I don't know I'm sorry." Sherlock huffed, "it was the original scooby doo theme song." John could not hold it any longer, he laughed so hard that he had to pull the car to a stop on the hard shoulder in fear of crashing. He folded himself over the steering wheel in an attempt to find gravity again but it was not there. He laughed until Sherlock got out of the car and stomped onto the grassy merge. Once John was able to put his ribcage straight again, he sat up and did feel genuine guilt. He could not have helped it. Then he looked out the left window and saw Sherlock sat in a huff at the small hills peak. The fact he looked so lost wiped the smile from John's face. He appeared so alone on that verge. John vowed there and then to not make fun of his friend, or at least persuade his friend to be comfortable enough around him to laugh along. John sighed, he so wanted this to be fun for them both. He was trying but Sherlock was so different to anyone he had ever met. He needed something other than this. Maybe he should buy him a crossword book at the next stop. John felt maybe he had not been very considerate of Sherlock, it wasn't his fault he got bored so easily, John felt he had been impatient in that stupid pink car.
Both John and Sherlock head back to 221b, they plan and prepare for their interview with a potential murderer tomorrow morning. John reminisces about the case, and it is evident that this partnership is valuable and one they both wish to hold onto for as long as possible.
Sherlock rested his elbow on the armrest and looked out the window, what if he never saw Redbeard again. It was a thought that would not leave his brain the entire trip.
These thoughts raced through John, all in a mere moment of Lestrade leaving, Sherlock asked further, “did your wife know you smuggled just like your sister?” Henry went to exclaim but John spoke up before he had the chance, “we know, don’t waste time, we met the gang ourselves and they treated us very poorly but they told us things about you, just answer his question.” Henry’s game was up, he sighed heavy, “yes she knew, but only recently, we had no money and we didn’t know how we were going to afford the savings for the kids tuition fees for later in life, so Eleanor got me in, my wife found out after I had been lazy with the money installments.” Sherlock nodded and shuffled his position slightly, “was she upset about it.” Henry replied, “yes, she wanted me to stop immediately, she always knew Eleanor did it but she didn’t know I was involved. She wanted it over.” Then Henry’s eyes went wide and he erupted into a fit of tears. He’d seen it; he’d seen the realisation the detective he basically hired had had a single moment ago. Through a stream of tears he wretched, “that man is going to arrest my wife isn’t he?” Sherlock and John said nothing, Henry spoke with more urgency, “isn’t he?!!!” He curled himself up on his chair and wept into his knees. John nodded to Sherlock and they both stood to leave Henry alone. They solemnly walked out the room and retreated to the room next door with the mirror window. All they had to do was watch to ensure he did nothing to hurt himself and wait in silence for them to bring his wife and the mother of his children to be interviewed in the room further along the corridor.
“Oh yes right, that, well I have established some deductions about you that let me see that escaping would be a more than likely option for yourself.”
"They liked her, I think the boss may have even loved her, his pupils changed when he spoke of her, and they were comfortable enough with each other to not only play poker, but Eleanor was comfortable enough to beat him without feeling like there were consequences. He was fixated with her, all they asked me about was about her, why would they ask me that if they killed her. Easy, they didn't. They want to know who killed her just as much as us. So the smuggling gang had nothing to do with her death, so anonymous. The lover. The lover and relation, we don't know yet, but definitely lover. Unless their hand writing is exactly the same, which either means anonymous is the perfect scribe or they are the same person, the latter is more likely. Lover and Eleanor wrote letters to each other often, they didn't sign their name, meaning she just knew who it was, the lack of identity most likely means that the relationship was secret, which backs up the idea that they were related, there is shame or at least anxiety involved. We need to get in touch with Lestrade. Where's your phone? They gang most likely tapped mine, they took it off me then gave it back. Whereas yours was left behind, just in case you were going to ask why I need to use your phone. Hurry John. Please."
John was still out cold; Lestrade carried John himself to the police car. Sherlock would have found it to be something funny to witness if the circumstances where the slightest different. His best friend being carried by Lestrade. Getting sat up in a mocked position. His head being propped up whilst Mary struggled to put a seat belt on him. No, not funny at all. (Actually it really is.)
Some more orders were given and to both John and Sherlock’s panic, John's hands were tied, his mouth was covered with thick silver tape and a black bag was put over his head. By the noises that ensued it sounded like Sherlock was given the same treatment and the knock of his elbow against John’s confirmed that for him.
Sorry it has been so long! I have been writing my Johnlock fic and going back to uni has been absolutely crazy! Hope you are all well and enjoy x
Whilst Sherlock and John found some much needed refuge amongst that tryst of rocks, they found no evidence of anything of case value being washed upon the shoreline. Still, with happy hearts at their childhood venture, both Doctor and Detective walked with their shoes in their hands. John still had the file of mostly photographs tucked securely in his jacket. Perfectly parallel to the other, walking in perfect synchronicity leaving footprints in the sand as unique to them as the genetic code that lay in their cells. It reminded Sherlock of that first morning he'd properly met John, in his office he'd noticed John bare foot and speaking as liberal and as fascinating as he pleased. He liked that about him instantly. Walking back to the nest of housing that sparked off into bone idle streets, it was clear that the borrowed white tent had now been taken down and removed from the sand. Unusual site now gone from the scene, any visitor may land upon these shores without any knowledge of the horror that was hidden from sight in that tent. John thought briefly that it may have now even been returned to the admittedly more prepared police unit who provided the privacy for the deceased white male. They walked in silence practically the whole walk of the beach, and it wasn't until the warm sand became cold concrete that words were exchanged. "We leave as soon as we get this car then?" John asked, paraphrasing in full knowledge that Sherlock would understand. John and Sherlock walked still holding their shoes until they reached the entrance to the premises of the bed and breakfast they'd shared a bed in last night. They hopped on the spot until socks and shoes where back on feet, irregardless of the fact that sand still hid between their toes. They collected their belongings, which had been left at reception on request. Sherlock paid using their work expenses account, and to both mens pleasant surprise, the rental sat outside, just over an hour early, for it was only twenty past two in the afternoon.
At this point John was at his wits end and was on the verge of explosion, when to his surprise Sherlock spoke up in the voice that John knew and missed so much. “We have had a family emergency back at home, please if you could just pay for everything on this card and then we will be leaving as soon as the transaction is made.”
Sherlock sat on the edge of the bed and felt in his right pocket for his phone. Empty. He checked his left pocket.
“Well, then. Yeah… yeah,” John had taken another gulp from his pint. “Fuck. If it’s so bloody obvious then he must know already.”
“I definitely want some,” she said coyly, coming up to his side and taking the rum bottle from him. She poured them each a generous portion and topped it off with some Coke. “Cheers!”
, Sherlock thought wryly. And because he couldn’t say, “I was running from the people who were making my life a living hell,” he just huffed and said, “It’s a small black phone.”
Greg came back with a glass of water and some aspirin. He placed them on the bedside table and sat next to John. All three of them were silent for a while.
I was supposed to write an only-John-and-Sherlock fic (you know, the one where they're the only two characters apart from secondary characters that are just there for context) but this got away from me. I feel like friends are an essential part of the school milieu so enter Lestrade, Anderson, Stamford, and Dimmock!
On the next Monday she came to school hoping to talk to her ex-girlfriend  Maybe she could apologize for making her sit with the other kids. Maybe Luna had finally calmed down.
The bunny whimpered as his wolf wrapped a hand around his small erection. He gave it a few gentle pulls. His ears perked up as Sherlock’s breathing began to change. The tension and worry were drifting out of him.
John quickly began to go faster and harder. Sherlock let out a yelp each time he pushed in. He could feel his knot starting to swell. His orgasm was quickly approaching.
John gripped his lover’s hips as he pushed inside. He knew he should be taking slow but he couldn’t stop himself. It was so tight and his need to reproduce was scratching at the back of his head. He slammed the rest of his cock in hard.
The bunny began to pant as his insides tried to accept that water that was being injected rather quickly into him.
Karen looked over her shoulder to make sure no one was watching before she removed a small bottle from her pocket. She dumped a few in her hand before carefully slidding them to Rosie.
John groaned. “You have the most remarkably beautiful ass, my little bunny.” John brought down his hand, harder this time, striking the firm flesh, again and again, turning the creamy white flesh, to a bright pretty pink.
Sherlock tried to focus on the pleasure the knot was bringing him. It was pressed into his prostate hard. He let out a whimper and tried to relax in John’s hold.
The wolf wrapped his strong arm around his lover and lifted him into the air as if he weighted nothing. He nuzzled his face into his bunny’s soft chocolate curls.
“Come on into the bedroom when you’re ready,” John said running a hand along his bunny's ears. “I want to fuck you.”
He walked up to the counter and demurely asked the saleswoman where their sexiest Halloween costumes were. She took the bunny to the back where there was floor to ceiling skimpy outfits. Sherlock bit his lip as he tried to decide on the best one to tease his handsome mate with.
Sherlock sighed but nodded. He didn’t want to push John at all. He sat down flat on the floor his legs stretched out in front of him. John didn’t need to worry. There was no way he was going to forget he had the plug inside of him. It felt huge inside of him. He knew in time his body would adjust but that time wouldn’t come fast enough.
Sherlock whispered something that John couldn’t make out. When John didn’t respond to it Sherlock repeated it a little louder.
Sherlock cried heavily as body struggled to adjust to the situation. He wasn’t really crying because of the pain. He could handle the pain. He was just overwhelmed by the sensations he was feeling.
Little did the wolf know but in that short moment when John told Sherlock that he would be attending the party and then told him to go out and find a costume,  wear that the little bunny hatched a plan. Sherlock knew why John loved these type parties. He got to hang out with his soldier mates and their wives who all loved to show off for the handsome ex wolf-soldier. Sherlock hated them because for four hours John’s attention would be away from him and it distressed the little rabbit so very much.
“Well, I would say that the scars on your arms tell me that you have in the least been methodical and almost clinical in which veins you have used, the repetitive scars are usually the worst, whereas you have many marks but they are all small and unnoticeable at a brief glance informing me that you have been trying to hide your drug use, either to your brother or the police or whomever. Doesn’t matter. The fact that you’ve been avoiding discovery tells me that you are aware that drugs are only a temporary part of your life otherwise you’d let the scars be worse than they are for accepting that drugs will damage your skin anyway so why bother maintaining there current state. This is a good first step, and by what you’re saying about your drug use being for your mind just means that we need to find more for you to do in those limbo points between cases. That sounds fair?”
“Well I guess understanding the drug your addicted to normally gives the feeling of being better than the drug, knowledge is power as they say.”
get him, his ego is big enough." They shared a laugh before John hurried after his long legged friend. He could not wait for a cup of tea in his chair. It had been a long fortnight and even though the flat hadn't been his residence for long, it already felt like home.
On hearing his name Sherlock looked into John’s tearing eyes. “I’m okay John, they just want to frighten us is all.”
Sherlock got up off his chair and went to walk out the door, on which Anderson appeared at the door. They stood face-to-face, almost eye-to-eye and both said at as a form of hello a sly “Sherlock.”
John and Sherlock rushed about the bustling streets of London. When bumping into a stranger accidently Sherlock would ignore them, but John would give a hastily sorry in passing. Sherlock had a steely look on his face; nothing else mattered in his world but this case. John had no idea of the route they were taking. London was a big place, and even though John knew it well, at this speed, nothing looked familiar.
John shut the lid and unzipped the largest of the two pockets to find a plain grey cotton t-shirt. He brought them over to Sherlock and as carefully as possible slipped the top over Sherlock’s head and down his pale and gashed body. On the trouser front he now hesitated. “Erm…”
John thought for a second before answering, “I imagine in life she would have been someone who would definitely turn heads.”
John rubbed the back of his neck, smoothing down the stray hairs with his right palm. On his first word he leant forward and rested his elbows on the table and placed his conjoined hands of the table’s surface.
Sherlock drew a line under this first set of information before turning back to meet John’s gaze and say “players. Who’s involved?” John looked down at his entwined fingers, and spoke slowly with caution, “Anonymous, could be a relative or a lover or both, and, the Asian black market smugglers who wrote those letters in Mandarin.”
The taxi driver turned around and said “which one?” to which John replied, “doesn’t matter. Just drive.”
For some reason John didn’t like the word ‘needs’ in that sentence. It haggled him a little bit, Sherlock didn’t have ‘needs’ right? Well he was soon to find out.
Sherlock was now incredibly focused on the names of the files. John saw that for the foreseeable future he’d be introducing himself it seems. Didn’t bother him in all actuality. John strode over to Molly and confidently said “Doctor John Watson, I’m Sherlock’s doctor and it looks like I’ll be with him on this particular case.”
However as the months rolled on his certainty in his best friends return wavered. After around a year the doubt positioned itself and around two months ago the acceptance of death overpowered anything else, but hope stood firm and it seems the underdog belief was correct, John always had followed his gut. Once again it did not fail him. He did wish it were sooner. Two years is a long time.
Sherlock placed his hands behind his back and jumped down from the table with a surprisingly loud thud, the noise forced John from his concentrated state to look up from the envelopes to Sherlock who was now a mere foot in front of John. To the extreme that John had to crane his neck to look into Sherlock’s eyes.
“Of course, but I do promise you John that you have not gone insane and I am one-hundred-percent here.”
“This isn’t a Tolkien story you know, the world has a certain level of expectations about feet John.”
Sherlock practically scoffed and swiveled his head round so that his body was facing John but his eyes were on Lestrade.
Sherlock walked away into the rest of the room away from their conversation. John gave an impressed huff and a shake of the head. Sherlock really was brilliant. “Who said that line Sherlock?”
Sherlock got onto his hands and knees. He let his white ears fall in front of his eyes. Sherlock let out a cry of pain as John started pushing the thermometer inside of him.  He began to whimper as the tool slid deep inside his tight ass. John wasn't giving him much of a chance to adjust to it.
The bunny felt John’s broad hands, hot and possessive, squeezing and kneaded the firm, taut flesh. “You’ve been a naughty bunny and you know it.” John’s voice was low and predatory in his ear. “You wanted to act like a child, teasing every cock in the room, tarting your ripe little ass around and giving everyone a show. Well if you want to act like a slut I’ll treat you like one.”
Sherlock took it and began flicking through before replying, “even if it wasn’t people rarely change their numbers. Too much fuss apparently. Aha!”
Sherlock glanced up at his companion. He was a couple of inches shorter than John, a fact he was contemplating while walking in silence with the taller boy.
The cabbie, a big man with a dark beard, said, “I’ve been there. Just make sure he doesn’t puke. I just had the carpets changed.”
“Listen, John, you have to tell him. If things go south, at least you have no regrets. I mean, he’s never been that way to anyone else. He likes you. I don’t know how deep down it goes but there’s no harm in trying, right?” Molly had said.
John, thinking hard, decided he couldn’t let Sherlock run away without at least trying to do something. Breakfast, he thought, elated. Everybody eats breakfast. He would invite Sherlock to eat breakfast with him.
Sighing, the young boy unlocked the door to his room and went in. He dropped his things on the floor and kicked the door closed. The minute he heard the door slam shut behind him, all thoughts of harsh words and cruelty disappeared. He always tried to keep his room free from all the shit he had to put up with every day. This was his own place. His palace.
It’s not that John never thought about it. He just never let himself dwell on the attraction he felt towards his mad flat mate. It had crept up on him, this feeling of fondness, then fascination, then want. He would try to date and once or twice, they even lasted a few weeks, but he would end up comparing them to Sherlock and wasn’t that just the saddest thing in the world?
“I found it!” John’s voice was triumphant as he emerged from behind a tree a few feet away. He help up a phone in one hand that Sherlock saw was indeed his.
He wanted to get used to it. He did. It just seemed like every single day they found new ways to make this place miser- no, that wasn't the word. Unlivable. That was it.
John did have a juvy record that would make any school shudder at the thought of welcoming him, but he also had something that swayed most of them. It was his last name and everything else that went with it.
“What? You tried to seduce somebody?” John tried to smother a grin as he imagined what that would have been like. His obviously asexual flat mate turned down anybody and everybody who hit on him, deducing them to an inch of their lives and making them run screaming out the door.
Sherlock was good at tamping down his desire to eat. And when he got hungry, he often snacked on chocolate cookies he sometimes hoarded in his room just to tide him over. Mycroft had been the one who got him hooked on those, the fat bastard.
Hot showers were one of his favorite things in the world. As John let the water wake him up fully, he felt the hairs at the back of his neck stand. He turned to see Sherlock seemingly getting ready for a shower of his own. John felt his insides flutter and enjoyed that rare fleeting feeling without shame. He knew he would eventually have to deal with the confusion, but for now…
Annoyed with himself, Sherlock tried to decide whether to look for it now or later. He wasn’t in the mood to run into one of the faculty and be forced to go to class. If he postponed the search, however, there was a good chance that somebody else would find it and-
When Sherlock opened his door and surreptitiously peered down the hall in the general direction of John’s room, what he saw made his heart leap out of his throat and shut the door. He took a step back and heaved a huge shuddering sigh. He didn’t really see who those people were that were crowded around John’s door, but they were large and musclely and generally what he considered to be
Walking quietly towards the stalls, he saw blond hair and strong shoulders. Water was cascading down his back and his head was tipped up while he rubbed his torso. Eyes closed, the boy turned his head and Sherlock saw who it was.
“Sherlock, what are you doing?” John asked gently, trying to calm his racing heartbeat and interested dick.
"The dorms are across the campus, in front of the soccer field," she said. "It has a great view at the back and all rooms are singles, as you probably already know. This ensures students’ privacy and comfort.”
and he bit back a curse at the pain. Too late. Sherlock’s eyes were blinking up at John in confusion.
“You, too, man,” John grabbed his hand and shook it firmly. They both pulled away at the same time and opened their doors.
John inhaled sharply at the pain he saw reflected on those piercing eyes. His heart constricted for this beautiful boy who was so obviously broken.
For a second, he got caught up in the sensation of lips on his skin and his hand came up to cradle her head while she continued nuzzling his neck. He was just realizing where he was and who he was with (
“Come on, let’s get you to bed,” John said as Sherlock stood up shakily. “I’ve never seen you drink like that before,” he commented mildly.
“You already got a breakfast date with some hot chick?” Mike laughed. “Alright. Just wanted to welcome you to the school. See you soon, man!”
Two raps at the door and he was on his feet, startled and skittish like a newborn colt. John licked his lips and crossed the door to open it.
John nodded, taking it. His feet were already on the move to go upstairs. "Thanks. Do I have to come back at a specific time or anything like that?"
he thought. At least that sperm donor he called his father had some sort of use. And honestly, it wasn't even drugs, really. Just weed. A lot of it, to be sure, but he was over all that. Really.
He couldn’t fathom any reason why Sherlock would be sleeping on their couch naked. John put the groceries and his backpack down on the floor and crept closer towards Sherlock.
John made a hmm sound of acknowledgement and started to relax as he walked beside Anthea. It was a beautiful and warm April Monday. Granted, he wasn't in the best, most relaxing situation in his life, but the worst was over. He had finally been admitted. It was touch-and-go there for a while.
“Uh…” John absentmindedly rubbed the back of his neck. “I kinda already have plans, but rain check?”
They jumped apart and Jeanette looked up in annoyance at the doorway behind John. “This room is occu—,”  she started to say when her eyes went wide and John looked over his shoulder to find Molly and Greg sandwiching a passed out Sherlock between them, their arms around him.
