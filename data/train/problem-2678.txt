A waiter came by with a tray and I took a glass of champagne, downing it too quickly. I must be careful when I drink. I don’t have a good head for spirits, but the desire for them is strong in my blood. It must be the Irish strain in me. Alcohol killed my brother outright and I was told my maternal grandfather succumbed to the demon as well, even though the man was a respected physician who should have known better.
“Holmes, please don’t walk away,” I begged. “There are a few things I must make clear.”
“Perhaps. These things are... complex. It’s something I’d rather not discuss, if you don’t mind.”
That sent up a gigantic red flag. “You don’t need help with the rent, Holmes. I don’t know where your money comes from, but I know you have it.” I pointed to his watch. “That’s a Patek Philippe worth God knows how many thousands of pounds. I used to know someone very well who wore one. So don’t deny it.”
One thing that set the Jesuit schools apart then, and still do, is the way the students were strictly kept at all times. I have heard a multitude of horror stories from men who endured the English public schools. Even the highest, like Eton and Harrow, allowed the boys to prey upon one another, the older ones venting their lusts upon the younger lads. The custom of fagging – a junior boy becoming the servant and property, body and soul, to a senior – is an old and vicious one, but one that was unknown in my school. Sins of the flesh were guarded against every minute of the day. A priest was always on duty in the dormitories, seeing that each boy kept to his own bed. ‘Particular friendships’ and crushes between boys were expressly forbidden, boys never being allowed even to walk in pairs, but always in groups of three or more. In fact, when I later heard stories of the shameless things that went on in the schools of my peers, I could scarcely believe them. It seemed that only boys who were privately educated at home, as were Holmes and his brother, and those in strict religious establishments such as mine, escaped being debauched.
And he was still. Or at least as still as Holmes ever can be when he is not unconscious. The wound looked raw, but I saw no obvious sign of infection, thank heaven, so I went about my work.
But he only shrugged. “What can he do, Dr. Watson? We must hold the prisoner here, Inspector Lestrade’s orders.”
“Holmes, you cannot be serious!” I said to him. “What will we do when we get to this... this place on Cleveland Street?”
“I’ve tried.” My forehead was aching and I rubbed it. Gladstone, who had been dozing before the hearth, awoke and stretched. Then he came over and nuzzled my bad leg. He often did that when I was distressed, as if he was trying to comfort me. “Good old Gladstone. You’re not a young fellow anymore. You’ll need someone to care for you, too, won’t you, lad?”
“You will never be asked to join the Order of the Garter with that attitude towards sodomy,” I pointed out. “And a knighthood is out of the question.”
“An excursion across the Channel might be just the thing,” he mused. “There’s a delightful hotel on the Left Bank. The landlady serves the most delicious pastries for breakfast. She will bring them up to the room on a tray and serve you in bed with your café au lait. And she would not bat an eye at seeing two companionable gentlemen sharing a comfortable berth.”
“Don’t you find that for a novel to be true, it must be exactly like life, Doctor?” said Miss Morstan, turning her large blue eyes upon me. “I cannot enjoy a story that is too fantastic. It seems so silly.”
I attempted to contain my outrage, but it was impossible. “This is intolerable! This boy should be in a hospital! Do you think he will run away? He can barely stand!”
“It was a delight, John,” Wilde bowed. “And I shall be looking for your tales in ‘The Strand.’ I adore stories of suspense and adventure. I would love to try my hand at one some day.”
“Please tell me,” I urged. “I am sick of secrets.”
“I don’t know about that.” Holmes propped himself up on one elbow and studied me. “Addiction to prescription narcotics after two extremely severe wounds suffered in the service of one’s country does not signify someone who is either an ass or an idiot. It suggests a man who has endured much and fought a valiant fight. Many strong men have traveled a similar difficult path.”
It was amusing the way Holmes and James were conspiring to keep me safe from what they saw as a husband-hunting harpy. But poor Miss Morstan was surely an innocent party. Her genuine concern for my welfare had touched me deeply.
But I didn’t respond. I refused to respond.
I closed my eyes as Wiggins eased me back onto his thin bed.
“There’s not much what is a secret in these parts, especially with the servants,” claimed Alfie. “We know everything going on, both above and below stairs.”
“Nah,” he said dismissively. “It wouldn’t have been proper. None of the maids at Sherringford are allowed followers, the village girls in Market Sherrin are silly wenches, and the girls working at Campton Grange are my cousins. I like them all, but I never felt anything more for any of them.”
“Don’t question me!” he bellowed. “Pack your things!”
After hastening away from Italy, I spent the next few months touring the continent. I visited Greece, taking in Athens and Delphi, as well as a few of the scenic isles, until I landed in Alexandria. There I found another English colony that gladly gave shelter to a young wanderer. I connected myself to the family of an attaché at Her Majesty’s embassy. The ladies of the family were preparing to travel alone through North Africa, via Tripoli and Morocco, and on to Gibraltar and the gentleman’s next appointment.
And I braced myself for the days to come.
“Buck up, my boy! I’ve had worse – and so have you.” He reached out his hand and touched the fresh mark on my forehead. I had removed the plaster that morning and it was a mere trifling cut, halfway to being healed. “We will both carry scars from the Moriarty Wars.”
“Not Mr. Holmes. He doesn’t know yet. It is I who may be moving to other accommodations.”
“So I have heard, Mr. Wilde,” I said rather archly. But the man was so open and good-humored it was hard to be cynical about him.
“The ladies?” I huffed. “How would you, of all men, know what the ladies like?”
Holmes stepped to the bar and ordered two pints of bitters. He handed me the glass and I tasted it.
It was not what I desired, but it was something.
He looked away, unable to meet my eyes. “Freedom is an overrated commodity. But if you must have it, then use it wisely. Adieu, Johnny Lad.”
“This is my brother’s house and my family home!” Holmes said defiantly. “If I cannot share an innocent bed with my bosom companion in his convalescence, then be damned what society thinks! Honi sont qui mal y pense! That’s my motto!”
“Nonsense. There’s nothing to apologize for.” Holmes eased himself back on my pillow, more than pleased with himself. The narrow bed may have been crowded, but it had never before felt so comfortable.
“What if the animal is rabid?” He squinted at the wound.
I shrugged and climbed inside. I did not care when we were leaving or where we were going. I had given up my life, my self, to the Irishman’s enterprise and nothing else mattered.
“Are you going to give us an Affirmation or what?” the Metallica fan growled.
And then...
Holmes blinked. “What question was that?”
Surprised wasn’t the word. “James, what the deuce are you doing here?”
“So Charles’ father already knew of his son’s... proclivities?”
“That has a much simpler answer,” he replied. “The truth is that I’m an unrepentant heroin addict and if I don’t kick my habit soon I shall undoubtedly die.” He glanced at his watch and got off the bed. “As I feared, it’s almost time for Group. I imagine we had better show up there or Fred will come looking for us. Come, Watson! The game is afoot, as the Bard said. If we do not sing, then we will get no supper.”
“What is, my dear boy?”
“His name is William Fisher,” Charles said sullenly.
“We see, but we do not observe. We sense, but we do not perceive. We feel, but we do not act upon those emotions. We move through this life like sleepwalkers, or like Gladstone there, taking each moment as it comes, heedless of the future and forgetful of the past.”
The journey to Hampstead was not long. The house loomed dark and menacing. It seemed uninhabited, but I knew it was not. At least not yet.
“Recreation,” stated Holmes. “That means ping-pong and checkers. There’s also a television set permanently tuned to football or ‘EastEnders,’ depending on the time of day. I am told they once had a dart board until one of the inmates went after his counselor with one of the sharp implements. He missed. Pity, that. Do you play ping-pong, Watson?”
It was a nondescript house on a nondescript street, with nothing sinister in its aspect, and nothing to signal that it was a place of assignation for sodomites, only a gaslight at the door and a brass knocker in the shape of a unicorn.
“Help?” I frowned. “Whatever do you mean?”
“And I can move into this room...” I stood in the doorway of the smaller bedroom. Perhaps we could simply be friends – with a congenial fuck only when it was warranted. No emotional attachments, no muss or fuss. That would be the best course of action for both of us. “With no strings attached?”
“Poor old Gladstone has little experience of cats,” I pointed out. “He likely thinks she’s some curious kind of dog and is content to leave it at that. Let’s hope things remain at truce between them.”
“Lord, my boy!” she said. “Don’t take on so! I know you receive the attentions of women as your due, so you should expect that men with a taste for boys will also pursue you, but don’t act like a prudish schoolgirl when it happens. It is the way of the world, John. I merely warn you against being preyed upon by scoundrels such as Brigham and Spencer. If you wish to take a male lover, find one worthy of you. With your beauty you could easily catch a prince or, if you wish to remain here in Rome, a Cardinal. But I would suggest you stick to married women. They are less trouble in the long run, although they won’t give you such expensive presents. And their husbands might take a shot at you now and again, but that is the chance you must take for love.”
I felt breathless with anxiety. “Are you suggesting that people believe Holmes and I are... are in some kind of beastly ménage?”
John confronts the Irishman.
Having listened to Holmes’ playing for many years, that did not surprise me. He could coax the sweetest sounds from a violin that I have ever heard – as well as the most dissonant, when the mood struck him. “What did your grandfather say to that?”
“It was created to look like a ruin,” said Holmes, tapping his pipe against it. “‘Nor mourn the unalterable Days, That Genius goes and Folly stays.’”
“I am that, madam,” said Holmes, tipping his cap to her. “I am right barmy. I’m planning to take young John here back to my dungeon and do unspeakable things to him ¬– for a negotiated fee, of course.”
“No, thank you.” I walked by and didn’t look back.
“A sorry business,” I mused, as Holmes and I sat in the library that evening. It was filthy weather outside, with the rain coming down in torrents, and the chill that infested the old house had caused us to draw close to the hearth in search of warmth.
“James. The footman. His mother is Mrs. Hopkins, the cook.”
“Stay away from Sherlock,” he continued. “I know he’s your roommate, but there are others here who have a positive outlook. Spend some time with George. He’s a good counselor and he’ll steer you right.”
“That you are the most loyal, truest, and satisfactory friend and compatriot a man could ever hope for,” said Holmes. “And if I were a man who prayed, I would pray every day not to lose your good will and your constant companionship.”
“Oh, drat!” I cried in dismay. “I’ll have to send him a note to cancel the engagement.”
Holmes cocked his head. “Wiggins has not been in my employ for an age, dear boy. I know these street urchins all look alike to a gentlemen, but surely you’ve noticed that Mr. Wiggins no longer comes to the house.”
There was no use in prevaricating. “John Watson.”
“There is nothing to say!” the lad said in defiance.
“So it seems,” I nodded. “But... it is too late!”
“Mick is as chipper as ever,” Holmes replied. “He is quite the fixture at Scotland Yard these days. He even told Lestrade that he was thinking of joining the constabulary. Of course, Lestrade was properly horrified. But believe me, there are worse men in the ranks than a former renter, and if only Lestrade would remove his head from his posterior and face reality he might come to see that Wiggins would make a better detective than most of the inspectors already at the Yard.”
“Certainly.” I gathered up my newspapers. “I need to unpack my valise.”
“Good Lord, Bunny! He’s got a cane! I wager he’s old enough to be your father.” The friend rolled his eyes. “And not even rich! Not a ring or a diamond stickpin to be seen.”
“No, they are not,” I allowed.
And the carriage rattled off down the street.
I glanced around, noting the shadows encasing the library. “Is it as late as all that?”
“Yes,” Holmes agreed. “A minder. That would be intolerable. I didn’t spend the past few months since you left rehab being a good boy and working their blasted program only to be placed in another pseudo-prison once I was officially released.”
I was suddenly overcome with an overpowering weariness and only wished to go to my bed, but James had taken the trouble to draw the water, so I was obliged to bathe.
“The wheel,” explained the driver. “It’s broken.”
I enjoyed myself in Amsterdam. I found the ladies of easy virtue agreeable and they seemed to like me. But all ladies seemed to like me. My mirror told me I was handsome, even girlishly pretty, blond and blue-eyed like my mother. But I was also strong of body, hardened by my years with the Jesuits. I could get by on small rations, my feet were nimble, and my hands quick with a sword. I was also a dead-eye shot. I thought of the Army, obviously, but before I turned myself over to another authoritative institution, I wanted to taste a little of the world as a free man. With my few possessions in a small pack, I set off across Europe to see what I could see.
“Nothing,” he muttered.
“You flatter yourself, Watson. I’m not in your bed, I’m in Mycroft’s bed! Or King James’ bed. Besides, it’s infinitely more comfortable than mine. That feather tester was old when our beloved sovereign was still a blushing girl! But Mycroft ordered this mattress new a mere fifteen years ago. It’s only logical that I should prefer it.”
“I am not a casual observer here, Lestrade,” said Holmes. “I am seeking redress for a young gentleman who was being blackmailed by this William Fisher. Others must also have been abused by the victim. And he may have had accomplices. Blackmailers of Fisher’ class rarely work alone. I wish to question the suspects. Have they been removed from the premises?”
“Look at that fine arse!” yelled one muscular chap with a shaved head. “Speak to me, darlin’! I have something you’d like right ’ere!”
“Group,” said Holmes. “Oh joy. At three o’clock. Yes, I think we shall remember. We’re not raving idiots -- at least not yet. But give us sufficient time and we may surprise you.”
“No,” I affirmed. “Not at all. But I cannot simply disappear. You know Holmes – he would turn the city upside down to find out what had happened to me. And that means he would eventually come to this door. You know him well enough to realize that is merely the truth.”
“Is it serious, Mr. Sherlock?” asked James.
“See?” said my new acquaintance. “A straight flush. Just as I said.”
I was so stunned I had to sit down. “But... why?”
But I remembered a lad of ten or twelve – it’s difficult to tell the ages of these boys who live in the shadows and are often the worst for nourishment – not this ruddy-cheeked would-be fashion-plate. I tried to remember that last time I’d seen him, but alas, I could not. The boys came and went, but the Irregulars remained, always perpetually in early adolescence.
“I bow to your private tutelage,” I said. “I suffered through years of a bleak Jesuit boarding school, followed by a sojourn in a seminary in Holland.”
“I’ll try,” he sniffed. “But will you do somethin’ for me, Doctor?”
Holmes yawned. “After a little sleep, then, it will be my turn to play the conqueror – if that is to your liking, my dear boy?”
And to that I did not say a single word.
“Get my bag, James,” I instructed.
Too late for... what?
The Irishman crossed the room and poured himself a glass of claret from a crystal decanter. “I would offer you a glass, Johnny Lad, but I doubt you’d accept a drink from me.”
And then there were all those notes from my excursions with Holmes. One day, perhaps, they might form the basis for... something.
“Was it?” Now he had my interest.
When the young man had gone, Holmes got off the bed and undressed. Then he pulled back the bedclothes and got in beside me.
“Certainly not!” I insisted. “They offer, but I always refuse. Then they laugh and offer me more. I thought it was a game to them to try to wear down my resistance.”
“You seem to be doing well,” I replied, looking him up and down. And he did seem well. Although not tall, he was robust and well-fed. And his clothes, including my hacking jacket, were fairly brushed, if not exactly clean.
I stared at the lad. Wiggins of the Irregulars, Holmes’ contingent of street arabs and urchins. His eyes and ears on the streets on London. When I first came to know Holmes, Wiggins was called his ‘lieutenant’: a filthy child with a sharp eye and a quick wit who was the chief of the Irregulars, the one who took orders from Holmes and sent the boys out to do his bidding. He also collected their fees and, I assume, distributed the same to the boys, according to their deeds.
“Er... yes,” I confessed. “I promised to care for it for a friend who is... away.”
“My rib,” I marveled. I had seen enough chest wounds in Afghanistan to know that each bullet injury was a story in itself. “It didn’t enter the lung?”
“Yeah,” Mick shrugged. “When she got old enough she went on the game. It’s the only way for somebody like Dilly to make money, Guv. She can’t work at no real job. Who’d hire her?”
“Mrs. Hudson,” I began, not knowing how to tell her what needed to be said. But the direct approach seemed best. “Remember what we were speaking about not long ago?”
“You’ve been feeding him kippers again,” I observed. “You know what that does to him.”
“You are a liar,” I muttered under my breath.
“How the devil did you get in here? The door did not open and I doubt you climbed in through the window.”
It was a good morning.
“No one is taking wagers on this sport,” Holmes returned.
“A habit of manners, my dear boy,” he said. “Besides, I wish to insinuate myself into your good graces. If you are going to lodge with me I want you as an ally and not an enemy.”
“Undoubtedly.” I set down my newspaper. “Why would they want you to go there specifically? You have shown little interest in art in the years I have known you.”
The Irishman.
“I’m going,” I said serenely. “Give my regards to your charming wife. Tell her that her son needs rest and a mother’s care and all will be well.”
“You must have been a child once,” I commented, trying to picture him. A whip-thin boy with wild dark hair and eyes that missed nothing.
“No.” I shook my head.
“I can,” he said simply. “For I am a prodigy. I could do advanced calculations from the cradle. My mind is like a machine – if such a machine for calculating existed. It does not – yet – but I do. And I am not the only one who can do this. I have, in my travels, met two others whose minds can almost match my own – almost. It must be a trick of lineage, for they are brothers. Perhaps we three are related through some far distant ancestor. That would truly be an irony. So you see that I do not believe in luck. However...” he paused significantly. “I am Irish, which means I do believe in fate.”
No wonder it looked familiar, for it was my own.
I waited, hoping the minutes would slow until they stood completely still.
“I...” I stopped, unable to think of a good reason. I could not very well tell Stamford and his wife that I could not dine with him because I was preparing to abandon my long-time lodgings, my profession, and all I held dear in order to indecently cohabitate with a master criminal who was otherwise bent on murdering the man with whom I was in love.
I leapt from the sofa and bolted to the door. I needed air. I needed to breathe. I needed to think!
The ladies soon withdrew, leaving Stamford and I to the claret and cigars.
“Certainly, my dear boy.” He eased off as we came into lower Baker Street. “It’s only the old family pile. Sherringford Hall. But you might find it amusing.”
And now I was going to reclose that newly opened heart. I was going to leave him in the night without an explanation. And without another word from me for the rest of my life.
“Buck up, man!” I urged “There is nothing anyone can do if a chap is determined to harm himself. But you were right to tell me the truth. My friend Mr. Holmes will get to the bottom of this!”
“So, I’ll leave you chaps to it,” said Fred. “By the way, doors are to be kept open at all times.”
“You can trust me, John,” he whispered. “As I trust you.”
Mick stared at the ticket. Then he looked at James, his expression full of conflict.
But these public displays depressed me. My fear was that I would meet someone I had known in my previous life. And it was difficult to avoid such a happenstance, especially since London, although a vast city in theory, is like a small village at a certain level of society – you meet the same people at the same places. And whenever I saw one of my friends from my days of freedom, I would turn away, as if I did not recognize them. And I would see them whispering. I knew that my liaison with this wealthy Irishman was known and commented upon, much to my shame.
Monday morning found Holmes and myself once again in Mycroft’s leaking carriage, lurching towards London in a driving rainstorm.
“Lead the way,” I said.
“My landlady doesn’t allow one,” I confessed, pouring myself a cup. “Or a hot plate. The electric kettle is the only appliance permitted. I usually make myself a piece of toast when I get to the clinic. Or else I pick up a pastry or something on the walk over there.”
“Abroad?”
“How did you find me?” I asked with trepidation.
“Are you planning to tell me what is going on?” I asked once we had left the city and were jolting along. Ironically, it was the same road I had taken with Holmes in Mycroft’s carriage not so long before, and heading to the same place – Sussex.
“Damned how I am!” It was all I could do to keep my temper in check. “Where in thunder is Holmes?”
“Make no promises you cannot keep,” he returned. “That’s my credo.”
“Wiggins,” Holmes called. “Might I discuss something of importance with you?”
I began to rise, but his hand stayed me.
“Time’s up, gentlemen!” said Collins, standing at the door of the cell.
“No, Guv!” Mick pleaded. “Don’t even speak of him! Please?”
“No, not my wound,” he said. “At least not the wound in my side. Another wound. One that is not so easily healed. But one only a doctor can cure. And only one particular doctor.”
The Irishman’s lip twisted. “Then you do not know yourself, Johnny Lad. You are in a fog of denial. But Sherlock is not. No, he knows all too well.”
Holmes and Watson plunge into the underworld.
“What will happen to Dilly?” asked Charles, his lower lip trembling.
“It’s life,” the lad shrugged. Then he glanced out the window. “Here’s the street! It’s Number 19.”
“Are you ill, my dear boy?” he asked gently. “Let me get you a drink...”
“But the past feeds the present, John,” said Holmes. “For years I feared to declare myself to you. I could not convey my feelings and so I stifled them. The Punchbowl was a venue where I could punish myself for my cowardice, and where other men might beat the lawless desire out of me. And I did it knowing I could always return home to you and that you would bind my wounds without question.”
Chapter 1
“It would be my distinct pleasure, my dear fellow.”
“But... how?” I whispered.
Stamford frowned. “You’ve been lodging with Holmes far too long,” he said darkly. “Mark my words, you’ll turn into as much of a misanthrope as he is before long. And then it will too late! A pair of sad old bachelors, that’s what you’ll be! Get out of Baker Street, man! Didn’t you sell a few stories to the ‘Strand Magazine’? That one about the African safari was quite entertaining. Writing must bring in some extra mint.”
Now my curiosity was aroused. “But how?”
“You are not here for your conversational ability!” the Irishman snapped.
“Oh, he certainly resembles a swine,” Holmes agreed. “However, he also knows I’d never survive any gaol in this country. I’ve put away far too many criminals who would love to get their hands on me in a place where there was no escape.”
“Yes, we made love,” I said, the words thrilling me. “One time. One last time. And I’m not sorry.”
“Of course.” I turned to Holmes. “I’ll see you back at the room.”
“But how...”
“My feelings for you are of no consequence,” I declared. “This is not about you. This is about Holmes. If this is what I must do to keep him safe, then I will do it.”
Holmes returns.
May in Sussex burst into glorious bloom and the lovely weather and even lovelier verdant countryside mirrored my blissful mood.
“He doesn’t moon after me!” I retorted. “The very idea is absurd.”
“Here, now!” said Constable Clark with a frown. “None of that stuff! This is a respectable hospital!”
“I don’t think my brother Mycroft would look kindly upon that,” returned Holmes, blowing out a puff of smoke in the direction of the enraged major.
“So have we all,” I returned. “We are all sinners. It is all about the degree of our transgressions. But punishment always falls most heavily on the weak, the poor, and the powerless.”
“Good lord, Holmes! If you want to speak with me, why not come through the main door like a normal person?”
She went out in a flurry of tears, which distressed me greatly. I was on the verge of tears myself, but there was nothing else to do but force them back and continue packing.
“Wait,” I said, halting before the stairs. “I need to go back to Baker Street and conclude my affairs first.”
“It’s nothing,” I said, brushing off her praise. “A few trifles I offer to the public from my imagination.”
As soon as I had taken one sip I knew it was drugged, but I finished it anyway. Rather drugged senseless than to be fully aware and fighting a battle I was bound to lose. For there was no point in fighting. If this consummation had happened in another way, at another time, another place, I might not have been fighting it at all. That I was attracted to the Irishman was not in doubt. He was magnetic, even mesmerizing. I often wondered if he used a form of the hypnotic arts to lure men into doing his will – the power of his mind was certainly strong enough. Still, this was not the way I would have chosen to meet my fate. Unfortunately, that choice was not mine to make.
“They are not my exploits, dear lady,” I replied. “I am only a mere bystander to my friend’s deeds.”
“I’m sorry, Wiggins,” said Holmes. “I will endeavour to get to the bottom of this. But there is nothing I can do at this moment. I’m afraid you will have to go.”
“You will not be boxing any time soon,” I insisted. “Trust me – I’m a doctor. And I am also your good friend...”
Nothing. Nothing to say.
A log cracked loudly on the fire and the hearth flickered briefly. I heard Gladstone groan as he dreamed his doggy dreams.
“Do you really know who the murderers are?”
“As you wish.”
“I... I need some air,” I murmured. “Let us leave this place – immediately!”
There was no reply, so I gently took the pipe from his mouth and set it on the bedstand. “Another time, then,” I whispered. Then I, too, shut my eyes and surrendered myself to slumber.
“What did you say, Doctor? What? Easy there. We have you.”
I was at attention in an instant. “Your wound – are you in pain?”
After a while I thought I’d go mad if I didn’t get out of there. I began to pick up the books on the Irishman’s private shelf and read them, trying not to let my mind rot or turn to evil. His personal library was an eclectic one, containing everything from the classics in Greek, Latin, and Hebrew, to the sensational novels of Wilkie Collins, but tilted towards the sciences, both practical and theoretical. And so I read. I believe those books saved my sanity, but I didn’t understand how I would be saved until much later.
I slipped off my clothes and swiftly submerged myself in the bath. Before I could stop him, James was vigorously scrubbing my back with a stout bath brush. And, I admit, the warm water and his cheerful ministrations soon caused me to feel more at ease than I had in ages.
“Yes,” I said. “But that matters little because he doesn’t love me. He doesn’t love anything. He is incapable of such emotions. And that is, in the end, a fortunate thing, for he will not miss me too much. And then, after a time, he will forget me absolutely.”
And now it was here.
It wasn’t more of the same. Not in the slightest.
He bowed. “As you will have it, Father Watson.”
We watched the door close behind the servant.
“What was that all about, James?” I inquired. “Why did you or Holmes not tell me the lady had come to see me?”
“Love?” I asked, racked with guilt for what I had just done to him.
Of course, Holmes was nowhere to be seen.
“I concede that’s a slight problem. If the pervasive Fred or one of his lackeys gets wind that a ‘particular friendship’ has developed between us, he’s sure to move you elsewhere – probably in with Arthur or another equally odious individual.”
I finished my tea while my patient rattled on. I knew Captain Phillips would never see that the real danger to the British Empire wasn’t in pursuing half-wild tribesmen into punishing mountains, but was here, on the squalid streets of London, with the poor and the sick, the desperate and the unscrupulous.
“No,” I said finally. “When Mr. Holmes needs my assistance, he will summon me.” But then I realized that if he did not do so soon, then it would be too late. “James, I must tell you something. I might need to go away myself. If that happens, then you must do whatever you can to aid Holmes. In my absence he may need... someone. You came here to be a valet, to be a good servant, and Holmes will need that when... when I am no longer in residence. Mr. Holmes is a brilliant man, but he can be very disorganized and slipshod when it comes to his personal habits.”
“In the past I have always turned away from comfort,” he confessed. “My parents were both passionate people, but their passion was for each other only and not for me, or for Brother Mycroft, for that matter. And my grandfather, the Old Earl – well, you can imagine that he was not one to show affection to children. He saved his kisses for his horses and his whores, in that order. Even my nanny was a stern and cold old trout, hardly the kind of female who could take the place of a boy’s parents.”
“Don’t choke on that,” I cautioned. I sat next to him, on the edge of the sofa.
“You’re not planning on burning the place down, are you?” I joked.
“Has the dog been walked?” I asked.
My heart beat faster at the sound. “Holmes.”
“Thank you for the referral,” I said in all sincerity. “It’s difficult to start up a practice after all these years, but I need to regain a measure of my independence... especially now.”
“Indeed,” said Holmes. “It’s elementary.”
“But you gamble,” I retorted. “You told me so yourself.”
“As you will – Arthur,” Holmes bowed to the burly man. “Much to my surprise and delight, I actually do have an Affirmation to make today.”
“If I had wanted to run you through, you would already be dead,” I replied.
Holmes reached into his pocket and took out a crisp five pound note. “Then think of this as payment for medicine for Dilly and adequate food for both prisoners.” He slipped the note into the warder’s jacket pocket. “Plus a pint or two for yourself.”
“Yes?” I looked up to see Miss Mary Morstan standing beside the bench. I immediately stood and removed my hat. “Good heavens, my dear lady! What on earth are you doing here?”
Holmes shook his head. “Lestrade will never allow it, as you well know. It has nothing to do with Dilly Mitchell, but with the prestige of Scotland Yard, especially now that the newspapers have gotten wind of this sensational and tawdry crime. I saw Lestrade this morning and he’s so puffed up with himself there was barely room enough in the building for him, his ego, and anyone else.”
The pain... too much.
“Lestrade is still crowing over his catch,” commented Holmes. “He’s afraid his pigeons will fly if they get too close to a window.”
I did not return to 221b until late that night.
“Get off me, cat!” I sputtered.
And now...
“They’re gone. To their New World.” Holmes tipped his hat in acknowledgment. “May they make the most of it.”
James’ eyes widened as he took the ticket. And in a moment James and Mick were in each other’s arms. “Thank you, Mr. Sherlock! Oh, thank you! You won’t regret your kindness!”
“Heavens, woman, whatever is the matter?”
“I don’t know.” Holmes wrapped himself around me. “But for now we still have a few more minutes before I must return to my lonely cradle. We’ll have to steer clear of one another during the daylight hours. You must work your program like a dutiful boy, Watson. And I will continue to be the recalcitrant jester, a bad example to all and sundry. Then we should be left in peace after the lights are doused. Are we agreed?”
Watson goes to the gallery to see some paintings.
“How did you come by my tweed jacket?” I finally asked, my curiosity getting the better of me.
“No, it isn’t about the cat.” I paused, gathering myself like a horse faced with a five bar gate to jump. “Tomorrow... I will be leaving Baker Street.”
“What?” I asked.
“Oh, yes,” said Holmes. “We’re all so very, very happy for you, my dear boy.” He stared at me and my heart sank. Now I was one of the enemies.
“Let me come to London with you!” James exclaimed. “I’d valet for both you gentlemen! Gentlemen need someone to care for them, it’s not fitting otherwise. You’re ever so nice, sir, and Mr. Sherlock seems much more congenial than Mr. Mycroft. I’d be honoured to serve you!”
“The doctor from the village took the bullet out,” said James. “He said it went through your heavy overcoat and your tweed jacket and your shirt and by the time it got to your chest, your rib bone hindered it from doing further damage.”
“No, thank you,” I said. “Not today.”
I strutted away, laughing, very pleased with myself for having scored off the pretentious gentleman.
“You don’t think they did it, do you?” I asked.
And then there was Holmes himself. And the whole love disaster. I knew if I moved in with him I was leaving myself open to more grief and certain heartbreak.
“You two carry on,” he said. “I will go in search of some of that champagne our host offered.”
The next six years were bleak ones. The school I attended was the same one my brother had passed through, a strict Jesuit establishment on the coast of Yorkshire, facing the wild and windy North Sea. The order of each day was prayer and study, prayer and more study. The Jesuits did not go in much for the games that are the rage at most public schools in England, although we did play cricket, learned to shoot and ride, and had rudimentary lessons in music and art. But the main study of these stern men in their black Spanish robes was Logic and Latin. On those two things everything else hinged. And if you stumbled in either you felt the pain across the back of your hand, or, if it were a more serious error, across your backside. And I don’t mean the simple swat of a cane. No, the Fathers knew how to inflict pain in ways that make me cringe to think of so many years later. I often fancy I know what the Inquisition must have been like for those poor Jews and heretics, for we were all subjected to the same flinty-eyed Inquisitors.
I nodded and tipped my hat to her, but she turned up her nose and tugged at the poodle’s lead. I was obviously beneath her interest. It must be my clothes. Must be. Because my person is pleasing to the ladies. I know that from personal experience.
“I’m sorry, Mrs. Hudson, but it is already decided. Dr. Anstruther will be taking over my practice, so if my patients come calling for me, send them to him.”
“It’s this bloody mud,” the driver said, cowering. “We’ll need another wheel. Or another carriage.”
“But one day... you might.” His voice was soft, the words almost a whisper.
“Yes,” I said. “Tomorrow. We’ll see to it.”
One hot afternoon, as I sat in a Roman café  with an elderly English lady who had befriended me, she upbraided me for consorting with the city’s most infamous sodomites.
“Never fear, dear lady,” I said, taking her delicate hand. “I will see to his recovery personally. Soon your boy will be as good as new.”
“Not a jot, my lad,” said Holmes. “Here, take my glass. One whiskey is enough for now.”
“Honour!” He spat out the word. “Fools are honourable! Women are honourable! Your honour has brought you here, Johnny Lad. Doesn’t that make you rethink your notions of honour?”
A stranger walking into the room and seeing us would think it a mundane sight – two old friends drinking together, sharing a fine claret. But things are not always as they seem.
“I like them well enough,” Holmes returned. “In their place.”
The Irishman smiled poisonously. “Some men would say you would be more a fool to come here unarmed.”
“I was worried about you, sir,” he said. “And about Mr. Sherlock, too. He hasn’t come home for two nights.”
“I said it is nothing!” I tried to push him away, but he insisted on helping me to my feet. “I must have stumbled.”
Holmes opened it and as he read his face turned somber. “Watson, may I have a piece of your scratch paper?” I had my writing paper by my side, as always, and I handed him a sheet and a pencil. He scribbled something in his crabbed scrawl and offered it to James. “Send this wire immediately. After you leave the Telegraph Office, you may meet us at St. Bart’s. The doctor and I must go there without delay.”
“Or afraid,” Holmes said. “Watson, don’t you ever long for the sensational? For the thrill of danger? Don’t you ever wish to step lightly on the edge of the abyss?”
I tried to sleep beside this stranger, but it was impossible. He snored, but it was different than Holmes’ snoring. That difference wrenched at my heart. As soon as it was light outside I quietly dressed and fled the flat, beginning that long walk home. The Walk of Shame some call it. More like the Walk of Deflated Expectations. It was a hard trudge to my bedsit, but it gave me time to think. Halfway back I realized that I’d just had sex with a man and didn’t even know his name. That depressed me more than anything else.
“It seems rather quiet tonight,” Holmes observed. His restless eyes were taking in every inch of the premises.
Once in my chamber I was beset by a strange weariness. I undressed, washed, tended to nature’s needs, and then got immediately into my bed. I had a novel by Mr. Wilkie Collins that I had been planning to read, but found myself unable to pick it up. Instead, I stared up at the canopy draperies and listened to the ticking of the clock on the mantel.
“Get in,” he finally barked. “I wish to make an early start.”
“No!” I stayed his hand. It was icy. I often think his veins run with iced water instead of blood.
“Friend not here now,” said Ivan. “You want that Ivan should give relief? Only 3 bob extra for good customer.”
I considered retreating to the continent or even America, but I had no ready funds. If I fled, it would be in complete penury and that I could not contemplate. I also thought about joining the Army or Navy, but I would need to buy a commission – I knew I would never survive in the ranks of common soldiers or sailors. And I dared not ask my brother for another pence. I went into the drawing room and stared at the portrait of my mother that had once hung in my father’s house in Guildford, a house long since sold. It was the only thing left of my childhood, yet as I gazed at it, I thought only about the value of the gilt frame and what I might get for it at the pawnbroker’s. That’s when I cracked, weeping until I had nothing left. That night I lay in bed and turned over in my head the many ways a man might kill himself.
He did not need to tell me that the police were on his scent and we were one step ahead of Scotland Yard. I went and packed my things, including my medical books, for I still had hopes.
He sat slowly on the bed. “Help me now. Please.”
“Be careful!” Wiggins protested. “Dilly ain’t well. She’ll never last in the clink, Guv’nor. She’s got a bad chest.”
“Someone whose egotism has disconcerted you, Holmes?” I raised an eyebrow. “Shocking!”
A very simple thing – it seems.
“On horseback!” he laughed. “The beast is tied behind a tree.” It was long a joke between us that Holmes was the world’s worst horseman and could barely stick to a saddle in the best of situations. “I don’t know which will be the death of me first – the deuced nag or this deuced weather.”
And in doing it, I sealed this devil’s bargain for the second time in my life.
“A fixed point, Watson, that’s what you are,” he mused. “Good old Watson.”
“If ever you want a friend, just ask for Stan,” he said. “I’m either here or at the Crown. Four shillings will put a smile on your face, sir – guaranteed!”
“You won’t find a cheaper or cleaner room in the West End,” she snorted at me. “Some places are full of riff-raff, ya know?”
“Yes.” I didn’t even blink to admit the truth. “I’ve been going at least three times a week, as well as checking in with a substance abuse counselor who works at Dr. Koenig’s clinic. But I’ll go with you, even every day, if that’s what it takes.”
“What did he do? Tell me!” I demanded. I had to know the horrible truth.
“I know,” I said with a shudder. “I am sorry for that. I know I can never erase that sordid picture from your mind. And I can never take back that moment of... of supreme weakness. But I am a weak man. I have ever been weak and sinful. I believe it to be my nature, although I have struggled against it. But it has been in vain. Which is why...”
“There, Watson! God! Yes, that!” Holmes gasped, his eyes squeezed shut in the intensity of pleasure. “Oh, God! John!”
There was a crash and loud voices. Holmes calling to Lestrade. The rain. Boots. Men.
We both froze at the sound of footsteps on the ancient lino, but they passed by our door.
“Griffith?” I said. “You wired him this morning, didn’t you?”
“I know everything, John.” He lay his head carefully against my shoulder, his hand touching the edge of the bandage around my chest. “I’ve always known everything.”
“You mean like taking illicit and dangerous drugs?” I didn’t want to sound judgmental, but I had to point out the obvious.
“I’m not a schoolgirl,” I said, tossing my head. “I can see myself.”
“I... hear you.”
I didn’t remember such a package coming to Baker Street, although I usually retrieved the mail each day, so it must have come in that morning’s early post. My curiosity overcame me and since it had already been opened and perused...
Then Gladstone made a noise that is much like a sneeze, but which signaled a function considerably more unpleasant to other parties sharing his space.
“Are you happy right now?” I sincerely inquired.
“Yes,” said the Irishman through gritted teeth. “Plans have changed. We head for the coast as soon as I finish these instructions for my lieutenant. I have a boat waiting in Sussex to take us to France.”
I winced. “I thought I was saving your life.”
That night the Irishman didn’t sleep, but paced back and forth on the carpet, his hands behind his back, thinking.
“But no longer,” he said. “Because I am not afraid now. Not afraid to admit what I’ve never been able to acknowledge before. That I...” He stopped, as if the words would not form on his lips.
John Watson remembers the most painful moment of his past.
Holmes took out his pipe and lit it, as he always does when peeved. “Is there a way to mitigate this situation, Collins? A bribe, perhaps, to get poor Mitchell some decent care?”
After my first year of medical studies ended, the Irishman and I traveled to Ireland. It was my first visit to his homeland, which was also the land of my mother’s family. We stayed with an elderly relative in a crumbling mansion in Clare. It was beautiful, but desolate. I spent my days riding or walking across the treeless terrain, while the endless wind howled at night even at the height of summer.
A carriage ride to oblivion.
“I cannot repay you.”
As the major blinked and gaped at his stricken son, much of the fight seemed to go out of him, his shoulders slumping in dejection. “Come into my library, Holmes. We will discuss this further in private.”
“But then you would inherit the title, Holmes,” I reasoned. “You would be a peer of the realm!”
I sighed. “That is not an uncommon crime. Mr. Holmes has solved many a case of blackmail, including one for a very exaulted personage involving some compromising letters.”
“And you are something as well,” he retorted, anger in his tone.
I’d just spent half the night shagging my head off and ordinarily the last thing I’d be thinking of at six o’clock in the morning was more of the same, but in this case...
I tried to discern a purpose in his eyes, but they were veiled to me. “Yes, I have been reckless,” I conceded. “And now I am in arrears. I confess I don’t know where to turn.”
“Another case solved by Scotland Yard,” he gloated. “And I’ll bid you gentleman good-night.”
“Very good, sir,” said Lovell. But once again the butler’s countenance displayed his intense disapproval. Perhaps I, a product of the middling orders of British society, could easily service myself, but Mr. Sherlock, the son of an obviously ancient and distinguished family, was expected to behave in a manner befitting his exalted rank. In other words, unpacking his own valise was lowering himself in the eyes of all the servants. Lovell’s demeanor seemed to suggest that Holmes’ proximity to me was somehow to blame for this appalling misconduct.
“Oh, Doctor!” she cried, clasping my hand in her dainty one. “I am so relieved to see you looking so fit! Dr. Stamford told me you had been injured – shot! – in some confrontation with a desperate criminal! I have been so distressed you cannot imagine!”
“I would entrust my secret with no one else, John,” he said, accepting the kiss. “Only you. There will never be anyone else. Do you understand what I am saying?”
For young John Watson there was no escaping the Irishman.
“Because...” I swallowed. The only thing was to be truthful. The Irishman could always sniff out a lie, but the truth he could not deny. “Because I love him. I have for many years. You took us for lovers, but it’s not that. For me it’s much more than that. He is everything to me – my entire reason for being alive. I didn’t make myself face that fact until very recently. And now that his life is in danger...” I paused, trying not to falter. “My own existence is meaningless. I have done nothing worthwhile in my life, nothing to leave my mark on the world. My loss would cause barely a ripple. But Holmes is a different story. His loss would be a great tragedy. His great mind and intellect...”
Holmes opened the door on the first knock.
Mrs. Griffith was sitting by Young Charles’ bedside. The lad looked decidedly better, but the bandage was still around his neck, hiding the marks of the ligature.
And when the Irishman was done with me, another, lesser man would probably take me up, and so it would go. I’d seen it happen to women and I had pitied them. But I vowed not to pity myself. I vowed to find some way to survive without becoming something that the world would despise.
“And what about when we get back to Baker Street?” Holmes queried. “Then what will we do with it?”
“You have a place where you belong, Watson,” said Holmes. “Which is by my side, my loyal companion and partner in crime-solving. Now go to sleep. In the morning I’ll show you the most fascinating place on the estate – the hives. You’ll find them riveting. And the beekeeper is a most amusing fellow.”
“Thank you, Doctor Watson!” exclaimed James. “You are too good!”
“Perhaps under the bed?” Holmes suggested.
I went into his room. As was usual, it was cluttered and the bed unmade. The print of ‘The Sleep of Reason’ presided over all, but the livid monsters that troubled the sleeper’s dream seemed tame compared with the real horrors of a life lived without honour or love.
But his eyes were closed.
Something was pressing against my face. Smothering me. Trying to kill me.
“You are far too blunt with people, Holmes,” I chastised him. “A little bit of a bedside manner might serve you better than confrontation.”
On a Saturday evening that part of town, so near to the sinister pleasures of Piccadilly and Soho, as well as the theatres of the Haymarket and the hotels and restaurants of the Strand, it is as bustling as Regent Street or Covent Garden during the daylight hours. I was sure I would be able to slip into Mycroft’s building under the cover of the darkness and the crowd, but I did not want to take any chances. I had the driver let me off at Trafalgar Square, then I walked, twisting, turning, and doubling back, as Holmes had often instructed me, through the nearby streets, hoping against hope that if the Irishman was having me followed, my shadow would be lost attempting to mimic my perambulations.
Someone was wrapping me. Lifting me.
“Please sit, John,” said Fred as he slipped into a chair repaired with silver tape. “I hate to be blunt, but I must warn you about Sherlock.”
Holmes stepped forward. “My dear Mrs. Hudson, if you could accommodate Mr. Hopkins for a while, Dr. Watson and I would be most grateful.”
The boy in Gloucester Place had a simple sprain and not a break. He was in some pain, but he was more interested in the bandage I wrapped around his ankle. His mother was the one who was most distraught, crying and wringing her hands.
“Yes,” I said. “Let us leave.”
“We are gathering information,” he replied testily. “If you do not wish to take part in the investigation, say so at once and I shall tell the cab driver to pull over so you may get out.”
“Yes,” he said. “She was my grandfather’s mistress. And her son, my father Osric Holmes, was born on the wrong side of the blanket.”
“If you say so, sir.” James shook his head. “But Mr. Sherlock isn’t going to like it one little bit. He’s a jealous man, although he doesn’t show it. And he figures that...” James paused awkwardly.
“Not very,” I admitted.
“That will be seen to,” said the Irishman. He nodded to the silent servant, who left the room. “Whatever you need from now on, I will give to you.”
“No, it is not my wound,” he insisted, setting his pipe aside. “It’s the memory of... of my own youthful folly.”
And now I was placing myself in his hands once again.
Holmes reached for his pipe and filled it. He had smoked a small bowl at the table after dinner, but since we had retired to the library with the sherry decanter, he had refrained until now. “The natural sciences – that was my father’s realm.”
“I thought you were long gone from London.”
“Settle down, Wiggins!” the warder snapped. “Don’t you be cheeky with your betters.”
“Don’t think I know him,” said the man, taking in our evening clothes. “But we welcome gentlemen, long as they behave themselves, know what I mean?” And then he guffawed.
“No, thank you.” I did long for a cigarette, but having quit I felt I might as well attempt to make a success at something.
“Don’t be vulgar!” I snapped.
“Damn it all!” Holmes muttered under his breath. “Come, Watson. We must depart.”
I turned away, unable to face my most intimate friend. “You push me to my limit, Holmes.”
“She was American,” Holmes corrected. “Her father was a professor at that university and a great believer in the education of females. My mother was a noted Bluestocking and a confirmed spinster until she met my father. He brought her back to Sherringford and they were wed. My grandfather was not at all pleased, but he could hardly protest his only surviving son’s selection of a bride, especially considering my father was the product of my grandfather’s illicit liaison with Mlle. Yvonne.”
“He’s still alive,” the Irishman stated sourly. “The air-gun should have done the trick, but Moran is too hot-headed these days to shoot straight. And then that idiot with the knife! Now Holmes has gone to earth, like a fox. But he will emerge... one day. I have patience. He does not.”
“I wasn’t worried,” I replied. “I’ve ceased to worry about you, since you refuse to worry about yourself.”
“Quite.” I held on for dear life as we rocketed through London. Holmes was without a doubt the worst driver I’d ever known.
“Yes. Did that take your powers of deduction to discern?”
“Oh, I wouldn’t want to crowd you two gentleman,” James asserted. “But I don’t mind sleeping with a cat. I love all animals. Like old Gladstone here.” He knelt and rubbed behind the dog’s ears. “Such a good dog he is, aren’t you, lad?”
“Holmes, don’t you feel it might be best to get off the bed?” I suggested. “At least while...” I nodded in the direction of the footman.
“He eats, sleeps, and farts,” I stated. “That is what he wants, that is what he needs, that is what he does. No more and no less.”
John remembers the past as he contemplates the future.
The lad was crying in my arms. I stroked his soft hair, attempting to soothe him. “I say that you should have a little more compassion, Holmes. The boy is distraught! And youth often does foolish things in the name of love.”
“What was that, Watson?”
And now it will likely ruin the only friendship I value in the world, separate me from the only living person I care anything for. The only person since my mother died for whom I have ever felt... love.
Companions sharing… a bed?
“He will not come tonight. He’s already told me so. He rarely comes here, except to change clothes. I believe he lives in his chair at the Diogenes, eating, sleeping, and cogitating in that same position for most of his waking hours.”
“I’m alive,” said Holmes, opening his eyes. His eyes are hazel, green in some lights, golden in others. “Don’t worry.”
“Good evening, Mrs. H.,” said Holmes. “Lovely weather, what? Here is a present for you. Watson, give her the box.”
I shook my head in mystification. “Only the very wealthy could conceive of building such an absurd thing! And in London children were living in the street, hungry and friendless. As they still do to this day.” I thought of the young Mick and Dilly forced to make their way in the world from the moment they were able to walk out the door of the Workhouse.
“You may withdraw, James,” I said, finally.
Reaching London in the New Year, I fancied myself a well-traveled, self-proclaimed expert in the art of love, proud to be still in firm possession of my manhood. In other words, I was a smug and insufferable young jackass. And I was happier and more carefree than I have ever been in my life, before or afterwards.
“This message was delivered about an hour ago.” She handed me a telegram. “It’s from Mr. Holmes’ brother and is marked as urgent!”
I knew that a lady would be offered, along with the meal and port afterwards. Some school friend of Stamford’s bride. Or a spinster cousin. She might be homely and awkward. Or beautiful and accomplished. But she was likely to be as poor as I was. Eager to marry and get out of her parents’ house, or out of her situation as a teacher or governess. A husband-hunter. And I was the prey.
I shoved them back into the envelope, sick at heart.
“Yes.”
“Is that the way it had to end?” I asked later that night. Holmes had left his bed after turning out the lights and come into my room. That was the way of it – he always came to me. And always after it was dark and everyone else abed. “Is that the way it always has to end? A dying secret in a God-forsaken place?”
“Don’t pain yourself, sir!” Alfie cried. “The doctor only wants to help you!”
“I do not need to cheat,” he said. “Cheating is for those who don’t have the brains to win in the only way that matters – by using reason. By using logic. And by using mathematics. I win because I follow the cards. I calculate all the possibilities. I don’t guess which way the cards fall – I know.”
I found him easy to talk to, although my mind kept returning to Holmes, wishing he were the one I was talking to, drinking with, and, after an hour or so of banter, going home with.
But still I stood, paralyzed by my own indecision.
“Yes, sir,” said Barton. “Come, Mr. Charles. The ladies have gone. Please let the doctor have a look. He’s here to help you.”
At that moment I felt as though the blood in my veins had turned to ice water.
I placed the loaded revolver on the bed-stand next to the jar of oil we had used in our exertions.
I quickened my pace, finding my way into the twisted streets of Soho.
“The dog wants air, Watson,” Holmes reasoned as he paced the sitting room in his ragged dressing gown. “He wants stimulation. The refreshment of a change in scenery. He needs to arouse his canine instincts anew. Pursue rabbits and stalk other vermin. Water new and exotic flora. Dig his claws deep into the soil of Sussex.”
And always in the background stood the Irishman, smiling grimly to himself. Always on the fringe of it all, watching me. Sometimes he’d disappear for days and I knew he was off somewhere, doing business. I did not ask what that business was. I didn’t want to know what it was. But that thought of it kept me awake many, many nights.
I took the cloth and pressed it to my head. “Thank you.” I paused, watching him pace nervously. “You really think that was a gun?”
“But the lady didn’t answer your letters, did she?” said Holmes.
“Elementary deduction,” he shrugged. “I only know a little about you, Watson, but when I’ve observed you longer I undoubtedly will be able to tell more.”
“It’s the rear passageway,” Holmes stated. “I noted a small crowd of malingerers in the main street. Quigley claims this building is connected to its fellow in front. We simply go up the backstairs to the third floor and through another doorway to find our villain, Mr. William Fisher. Have you the revolver at the ready, Watson?”
Never expecting anything from him.
“Marriage is far from my thoughts,” I replied. “Even if I had the money, I lack the inclination.”
“Yes,” I said. “And I will ask for nothing else from you, for you have given me the only thing I desire – my freedom.”
“That’ll suit nicely,” said the boy. “It’s good-sized for two.”
“Like Oscar, I think they are beautiful.” Ross fingered the sleeve of my coat. “But not as attractive as the man who inspired them. Unlike Oscar, I am partial to reality and not fantasy. He searches for the perfect artifact, but I am content to find a congenial companion – even if only for a night.”
“That’s tragic,” I said. “He seems a brilliant man.”
I tell myself that, although the illness was – and is – of his own making.
“Indeed,” Holmes sniffed.
“You were ever a liar, Johnny Lad,” the Irishman hissed in my ear. The steel was cold on the thin skin of my neck. “Always a lying bitch! Holmes sent you to me to tempt me. And I fell for the bait like a love-sick fool. Well, it’s the last act of your miserable life! If I cannot have you or my freedom, then I will not let Sherlock Holmes have his only desire, his only happiness!”
“Moran? Is he your new favorite?” I asked. I tried to picture the man who had shot at us. Was he young? Old? A thug? Or a gentleman? The Irishman had all kinds in his service.
Baker Street would never be my first choice for a long-term residence. The street is noisy and dirty, with cars and motorbikes shooting up and down at all hours, the local tube stop is crowded with tourists on their way to Madame Tussaud’s, and it was too far for me to walk to the clinic, adding expense and inconvenience to my daily commute.
“Mr. Holmes,” said the major. “We had word that a physician was visiting Sherringford, so I took the liberty of calling for you. You are closer than the nearest doctor, who is in Market Sherrin. I hope this does not put you out.”
“Oh, no,” I said. “I must beg off.”
The Irishman took me by the elbow and pulled me out of the crowd and into a passageway off the main salon. I hesitated for a moment, but then I went. I didn’t fear him anymore. My fear had long since been replaced by loathing.
The monkey stared at the chessboard for a moment, shrieked, and then turned over the board, scattering the pieces.
“And the morocco box. I began that when I was at university. It was a minor pleasure, but it also alleviated boredom – and desire. I had a friend at my college and I felt things for him that I did not want to feel. And so I did not feel. Soon that pleasure became a necessity. Over the years I have tried to control it... but you know that I always go back. I cannot shake it.”
Now Holmes’ face was all concern. “Of course, my dearest fellow. Come then.” He took my hand and led me from the gallery and out onto the pavement.
“My dear child!” said Lady Percy, kissing me on the cheek. “How delightful you look!” Then she adjusted my cravat. “You need a stickpin to finish the effect. I will give you one of my late husband’s. He won’t be needing it any time soon.” And then she laughed. Lord Percy had been dead for over twenty years.
“I don’t care,” I said, turning my head to the wall.
That startled me. That is what the Irishman always said after he took a drop. He often said that whiskey was a gift from the gods, created to stimulate and inspire mankind. Of course, he usually spoke these words as he was plying me with alcohol to keep me docile and pliant, so I viewed his philosophy with a somewhat skeptical eye.
“Spoken like a cradle Catholic,” Holmes interjected. “Now, Charles, if I am to get to the bottom of this trouble I will need to know details. Names, dates, places – I must have all! We are here to help you out of this muddle, not to judge you.”
Frankly, it was hellish.
“I never did,” Holmes scoffed. “I let reason and logic be my guide, as always.”
“Yes,” he said simply.
I lay back down and put the flat hospital pillow over my face. It smelled of lemon disinfectant, the pillowcase scratchy against my cheek.
The Criterion bar – the place were my fate had been sealed eight years before.
“Yet you were not there today,” he returned.
“How long has Dilly been ill?” I asked.
“But what about America?”
So Sherlock Holmes was not only making use of these children of the streets for his crime-solving intelligence, but he was assisting them as well. He once told me that Wiggins was as bright a boy as any attending the finest public school in the land, Eton or Harrow or any of those. He only lacked the advantages of family and money that those boys had to make good in the world.
I left him in his chair and made my way into the main hall.
“Indeed,” Holmes conceded. “I, too, feel the same way. The city calls to me, my dear fellow. Moriarty might be on the run, but there are other miscreants walking free, other mysteries to be solved, precious jewels to be recovered, missing heirs to be tracked down, embarrassing letters to be retrieved. The game is always afoot, Watson. And London is where that game begins.”
“It’s good for you.” Lovell brought out another plate and placed it in front of Holmes. “Fresh watercress and braised leeks. Your system could use some cleaning out,” I said. “So eat it. All of it. Or you’ll get no dessert. There is dessert, is there not, Mr. Lovell?”
“Good morning, Doctor!” James spat on the toe of my brown boot and shined it up vigorously.
“Idiots!” The Irishman leapt from the carriage. “Fix it! The boat is waiting at Rye. I want to be in France tonight!”
“A shilling,” said the man. “Each.”
And yet... within minutes I had three drinks set in front of me. A thirtyish fellow in a polo shirt came forward, smiling, but was elbowed aside by an aggressive boy who looked to be no older than twenty-one, who in turn was sent on his way by a tall man in an expensive leather jacket who took my arm and pulled me to a corner table.
“Holmes, tell me you aren’t seriously considering breaking Mick and Dilly out of gaol.” I touched my friend’s shoulder.
“What about your Twelve-Step?” I asked. “Aren’t you supposed to attend meetings regularly?”
Another police constable was standing guard over the two suspects, who sat forlornly upon an unmade bed. One was a dark-haired young man who twisted his cloth cap nervously in his stained hands. The other was a girl of about 15, her long yellow tresses dishevelled and her face tear-stained.
“Looking for a friend, captain?”
“I did not,” said the Irishman. “I don’t need to kill. I have others who perform such deeds – if they need performing.”
“This one,” said Holmes, his ear to the door. “There seems a disturbance in our Mr. Fisher’ room. Perhaps he and his compatriots are enjoying their ill-gotten gains. Or arguing over them.”
“I congratulate you on your studied improvement at such an advanced age,” I said sourly. “I, on the other hand, nurse a damaged leg, suffer the remnants of a wounded shoulder, and endure a stomach ravaged by enteric dysentery, as well as an occasional recurrence of malarial fever. And, on top of all that, I am losing my hair.”
“I doubt that,” I drawled.
“Calm yourself, my dear boy,” said Holmes. “Mycroft has provided a specialist for Mr. Mitchell’s care. Of course, the irrepressible Mr. Wiggins is none the worse for wear for his sojourn in the Bridewell.”
“Don’t say that!” Charles sobbed. “I’ll find you a doctor...”
I took a deep breath and felt the sharp jab. My hand went to the bandage. My left side. “What did it hit?”
But I, who had been so tired before, found sweet sleep strangely elusive.
“I’ll get that for you, sir.” James put the stick into my hand. “Let me help you.”
“That won’t be necessary.” I shifted in distress, for Holmes was chortling beside me and I feared the servant would discern that something was amiss.
I turned around and looked at him closely. “Why not?”
“And Holmes?” The Irishman practically spat out the name.
Dilly opened his eyes. They were a brilliant blue, the only spot of color in that dim and dreadful place. “Charlie. I prayed you’d come. Unless I’m dreaming?”
Quite ill.
“Mycroft has offered us the use of his house in Sussex,” he said. “If you can tear yourself away from your practice for a few days, I thought we could leave on Friday.”
“Quite.” Holmes began pacing up and down, glancing up at the ceiling, taking in the appointments of the room. “So tell me, Major,” he said. “Your wife and daughter don’t know what has happened, do they?”
“Good God, Watson! Speak! Are you all right?”
The Irishman’s eyes narrowed. “Methinks the boy doth protest too much.”
“But I meant it,” I confessed. “I am glad I came here. I know you hate everything to do with this place and its method of treatment, but my individual therapy sessions are helping me. And I don’t even mind Group. I feel I’m making progress. And I need to make progress in order to leave here as something other than a hopeless addict.”
“I would if I were able, dear lady,” I said. “But know that the happiest years of my life were spent in this house and that is not hyperbole. I will never forget the time I lived in 221b.”
“I’ve been an idiot,” said Holmes. “I have pretended that emotions were nothing to me, but it was only because I did not trust myself to those emotions. Self-discipline has always been my refuge – I could not allow myself to lose control for fear all would be lost!”
And so I found myself being guided away from Piccadilly and towards Leicester Square. I recognized the Salisbury, which is on St. Martin’s Lane, as a theatrical public house. I had never been there myself, but knew its reputation as a meeting ground for actors, producers, playwrights, and other types who populate that dramatic milieu.
I made it to the top of Sherring Hill none the worse for wear. But the folly up close was a disappointment. What looked white and sleek from afar was actually grey, weather-worn, and crumbling, a pillar signifying nothing and abandoned to the elements.
She was exactly the kind of female created to tempt my slumbering appetite for women. Blonde, blue-eyed, and clean-featured, with a face both refined and quizzical, there was little that escaped her notice as she surveyed me, yet her expression was extremely amiable and sweet-natured. Her dainty hand slipped into mine and I felt a thrill that I had not experienced with a female in many a year.
“He was my brother.” I whispered. “You destroyed him.”
“Holmes... I need to tell you something,” I began.
“He staked me and helped me get me situation,” said Wiggins. “He’s a capital bloke, is Mr. Holmes. A real gentleman!”
“Then what on earth are you doing here?” I asked. “In rehab in a seedy suburb of North London?”
“Please end this bickering!” I cried. “My head aches enough without a row! James, if you would go down to my consulting rooms and bring up my bag. All I will need is in it. I’ll take care of my wound myself.”
The Irishman squirmed on the hard seat of the carriage. His back was obviously plaguing him in the damp weather. I knew it was so, for my own leg and shoulder were aching as well.
“What is this?” she said in a fluster.
“Good,” murmured the Irishman, his fingers entwined with mine. “Good.”
“It’s my head,” I said. I put my hand to my forehead. There was a small gash just above my right eyebrow. “It’s nothing. A mere scratch.”
The butler directed the two footmen to take our bags and we followed him up the narrow staircase and into a newer section of the house.
But while the Fathers had warned me about the Daughters of Eve and their ensnaring temptations, there was one aspect of carnal knowledge that they had neglected to warn me about. For it was not only ladies who found me appealing.
I opened my bag and retrieved a small bottle of laudanum and a spoon. “This will allow you to sleep, Charles,” I said, giving him a minor dose. “Let yourself rest for now. Things will look brighter when you awaken.”
“You are the very devil!” Holmes exclaimed. “A worse nanny than Mrs. Hudson when you put your mind to it!”
“Why in heaven’s name?” I inquired. “What was in those letters that was so damning?”
I don’t know what I expected to see, but it wasn’t Sherlock Holmes reclining on a pile of large pillows on the floor of a room rigged out like the tent of an Arabian sheikh, smoking a hookah, and playing chess with a monkey wearing a fez. I had to blink to make certain my eyes were not deceiving me.
“This is the place,” said Holmes, rapping on the roof of the cab. The vehicle halted before a lively public house. I heard music within and the sound of shrill laughter.
“Just as well,” he said, easing back on the bolster. “I thought Young Hopkins would never leave. He ever was a talker, even as a small boy.”
“Oscar keeps a room at the Savoy for his assignations,” said Ross. “It’s not far and I have the key.”
“But Moriarty has escaped!” I exclaimed. “He is free to scheme and harass us both into eternity!”
And before I could move or call out, the Irishman seized me and wrenched my cane from my hand. He braced it against his boot and withdrew the sword, pressing the deadly steel against my throat.
Mycroft’s estate was approximately ten miles outside Chichester on a desolate stretch of road, not within sight of the Channel, but well within reach of the unrelenting wind and rain that blew off it. The sun, which had been attempting to break through the clouds for most of the afternoon, finally gave in the ghost and instead decided to set, leaving us to arrive just as dusk was falling.
“It... it just happened,” said Mick, avoiding Holmes’ gaze. “Don’t ask me anymore! ’Cause I can’t say!”
I decided to wait until that night. Then Holmes couldn’t get away, or wiggle out of it, as they say. He would have to listen and answer to me about Miss Mary Morstan.
The evening, which had been so delightful, suddenly seemed blighted and dispiriting. All that Stamford had – loving wife, comfortable home, secure profession – was always to be denied to me. Love – that also would be denied to me. And the devotion of a decent female, like Stamford’s Jane, or like Miss Mary Morstan, would forever be out of my reach.
I laughed out loud at that. “You would have made a very singular literary critic, Holmes!”
He shrugged. “Just a feeling. You seem so sad. And now you’re going away. I thought that... but never mind. It’s not the business of a servant to question his betters.”
“None whatsoever,” I acknowledged. I stood and felt a cramp in my bad leg. I shook it out as best I was able, but I was glad a hot bath awaited me upstairs. “Are you coming up?”
I said the words, but I wasn’t sure I believed them. Holmes said he knew who had done the crime, but the culprits were not in hand. And if the Irishman was truly involved, that complicated the matter even more.
“I am glad you told me,” I said. And I kissed him, very gently, upon the lips.
“Hopes?” I said. “Hopes for what? That my recovery would fail, as yours has so many times? So you’d have someone to share your failure? A pitiful little acolyte you could watch go down in flames? Someone to feel superior to? You already feel superior to me and everyone else in the known universe! You’ve had so many chances and wasted them all. You’ve obviously a brilliant man, but you’re also a stupid one. Stupid and foolish because you insist on punishing yourself over and over again. I don’t understand why and I don’t really want to know why you wish to destroy yourself, but I don’t wish to be destroyed with you!” I stopped and covered my face with my hands, trying to steady myself. “I only have this month to get myself straight. If I don’t I don’t know what I’ll do. I can’t get a position as a doctor if I’m an addict and my disability pension isn’t enough for me to live on. So what the hell am I supposed to do? You seem to belong to some rich and powerful family and can afford to fritter away your existence, always knowing that money will give you whatever you need -- drugs, rehab, whatever it is you require. I don’t have that luxury. I must succeed here or I might as well off myself! Not that anyone would give a fuck if I did!”
“Our dog,” he repeated as the housekeeper and butler exchanged glances. “He will eat anything, so be careful of what you drop on the floor. He also emits certain odors, so he will need to take the air regularly.” Holmes handed the end of the lead to the red-faced woman.
And I, most of all.
He glared at me. “I have travelled it before. Long ago.”
That was an understatement. “An infectious wound. I’m damned lucky to be alive.”
“I know this road well,” I remarked. “Do you know it?”
“Any word for me?” I was grasping at straws. “Something? Anything?”
“Right then,” he said. “Good-night, Doctor. And good-night to you, too, Mr. Sherlock. By the way – I dusted the secret passageway. If you’re going to be using it regularly you wouldn’t want it full of cobwebs, would you, sir?”
“Then learn something,” he said. “Watch.”
And then he smiled – a lascivious, knowing, welcoming smile.
A long and excruciating hour later Fred dismissed the Group. Holmes immediately took my elbow and guided me from the room.
“Undoubtedly with that chimpanzee as his colleague,” I added.
I turned down onto my street from the Cromwell Road, wondering what in blazes I’d do with myself until Monday. And that’s when I saw him. Sitting on the front steps, smoking his pipe, his expression quizzical.
The young footman’s eyes were pleading. But his proximity to my person unsettled me. Although he looked nothing like another young man of my brief acquaintance – Mick Wiggins being slender and dark, while James was tall, blond, and as strapping as a Guardsman – they both roused a physical response I was loath to acknowledge.
The dining room at Sherringford Hall was, like the rest of the house, murky and cheerless. It was paneled in dark, ancient wood that I am certain was historic and priceless, but it did not put one in the humor for a companionable meal.
Young John in trouble.
The rain had ceased, but we stepped out onto a disgracefully muddy road that sucked at our boots and spattered our trousers. The grass on the verge was even more sodden, but Gladstone snorted and sniffed there quite happily.
“Poor Mr. Charles! Is he going to be all right, Doctor?” Alfie asked with genuine concern.
“I say, Watson...” he began.
“Afghanistan?” He was holding me up, his strong arm under me.
That is, until he makes them clear.
“He is a brilliant man,” Fred acknowledged. “He’s also a menace to himself and others. Don’t let him be a menace to you, John. I think you will be a success here. Don’t let Sherlock and his negative attitude sidetrack you.” Fred stood, ending the conversation. “It’s nice that we’ve had this little chat. I’ll see you at dinner.”
“No, this is splendid,” I replied, tucking in. “I find myself quite famished this morning.”
“There’s always someone around to help you find your way,” he said. “I’ll light the fire for you, sir. This chair is the one the old Earl always used to sit in.” He indicated a worn wingback near the fireplace. “If you need a book, just ask and I’ll try to find it.”
“There is not, my lad,” said Holmes, puffing his pipe as we stood at the bottom of the gangway. Around us passengers prepared to embark, trunks were carried by, and cargo was hoisted into the hold. “Unless they lay railway track on the surface of the ocean.”
I’d just arrived in the main unit after my 72 hours in mandatory detox and had as yet told no one my story. I was saving that for later. Telling your story in Group was a feature of the treatment, or so I’d been advised.
Confound the man! I knew for a fact that Holmes hated the country and became restless if he was separated from London for more than a few hours, that he detested walking, unless he was in pursuit of some miscreant, and that history had little significance to him if it did not shed light on a case. Yet he had set his mind on this trip to his brother Mycroft’s estate in West Sussex and he would not be denied.
“He’s the proprietor. The place is not a house in the way of, say, Madame Marie’s in Kensington, or Madame Clary’s in St. James, where the girls are resident. It’s more a house of assignation where boys bring gentlemen and are then provided rooms, although Wiggins says Hammond will arrange a boy for a good customer.”
At least, that’s what I told myself.
The boy, Thommie, protested mightily when we told him we must leave, but Holmes silenced him with a sovereign. We left the house on Cleveland Street promptly and found a hansom in front of Middlesex Hospital to take us back to Baker Street.
Holmes continued puffing silently.
Flashback:
“Come, Watson,” said Holmes, linking his arm with mine. “Let’s hurry! I’m deucedly hungry! It was quite unneighborly of the major not even to offer us so much as a crumb of toast or a cup of coffee while we were at Campton Grange. I will need something to feed my body while my brain feeds on thoughts of blackmail and sodomy!”
My ears perked up like a foxhound that hears the bugle, but I shook it off. I was not expecting to meet anyone in this part of town. Unless, of course Stamford might be on his way to the Criterion and thereby hail me. But this voice was nothing like Stamford’s baritone. Instead, it was a high voice. Not feminine, but more a light tenor. And the inflection was decidedly of the lower orders. Even, perhaps, that accent from the vicinity of the Bow Bells that some term Cockney.
“Yeah, Bill,” said his compatriot. “A dirty shame. No one would want to kiss that cheek after we got finished with it. A pity, that.”
Just as Mrs. Hudson was bringing in Elevenses, an unexpected patient came to the door. His name was Captain Phillips and he was sent to me by Stamford, whose patient he had been for the past year. But now that Stamford had removed to Chelsea with his new bride, it was too far for the old gentleman to make his accustomed weekly visit. As he lived in Montague Place, Stamford immediately thought of me here in Baker Street. While I appreciated the recommendation, I would be lying to say it did not irk me somewhat to be getting cast-off patients from a man who was once my junior assistant.
I picked it up off the table and turned it in my hand. It was an ordinary china cup with a blue willow pattern. A cup like any other. Holmes drank his morning brew out of it every day and had done so ever since the first morning we began living here together.
At ten o’clock James helped me to bed, leaving two glasses of Mycroft’s best whiskey with soda on the bed-stand. “For later,” he said, with a cheeky grin.
“But only because she had to!” Charles cried, still using the feminine pronoun. “She had a room near Covent Garden where we would go to make love. I gave her money to keep her off the street. Or rather I gave it to her brother.”
Tying up some loose ends.
I referred the man to a specialist in Harley Street; I fear he has a weakness in his heart which is causing a lack of blood flow. A serious complaint and one beyond my ken, I fear.
“Don’t know, Mr. Holmes,” the warder confessed. “Maybe tomorrow, maybe next week. There’s a lot of prisoners waiting for a hearing.”
He stopped me. “But I do understand, my dear fellow. It is you who don’t understand. And I apologize for that, but it could not be helped.”
“Good boy,” Holmes yawned.
“Which is it?” I grumbled. “He either is or he isn’t!”
He looked older. Much older. With a waxed mustache and a pince-nez he looked a genial scholar, but his grey eyes still blazed with a malevolent light.
“Yes, Doctor!” said Alfie Barton, brightening. “Campton Grange is part of the larger Sherringford estate – the major is the Earl’s tenant – so many of us in service here were trained at the Hall. My mother and Mrs. Hopkins are sisters, and my own sister is a parlour maid there. Jamie and Harry and I was all born at Sherringford and raised up there.”
“That was splendid!” I praised to my hostess. “If your husband eats like this every day then soon he will not fit through the front door!”
“Thank you, James,” I said, opening the bag. I took out a bottle of alcohol, cotton, and a roll of tape. “I think this should be sufficient.”
“I say, Holmes – is this... wise?” I was still shaken by the knowledge that James had been Holmes’ confidant.
That caught me up short. “What do you mean, the extra he pays you?”
“You sweat enough?” Ivan spread a clean cloth on the marble slab. “I scrub you now?”
“It is possible to be an American and also Irish-born. The United States of America is full of immigrants.” He blew a puff of acrid smoke over my head.
I understand why he does it, but I hate it.
The House on Cleveland Street.
“I won’t turn away again, my dear boy,” he said. “Now that things are resolved between us.”
I wanted to go there to see Holmes, if only to assure myself that he was not in pain, that his wound was being seen to, that...
“Your soul?” the Irishman snarled. “You still believe you have a soul?”
“First names only, Sherlock!” said Fred.
It irked him that I had been out. But it irked him more that I would say nothing about that evening, where I had been or what I had done. But I had vowed to myself that I would never relate what had passed then to any man. Or woman. But especially not to him.
That was Holmes’ idea of pillow talk – pointed maxims and painful observations. If I was expecting romance of any kind, then I was in the wrong bed with the wrong man. But I didn’t care. I wasn’t thinking of the future and I wasn’t hoping for anything beyond that moment.
“I am not going to attempt anything, John Watson,” he replied. “And I am not a sodomite. I do not put such labels upon myself. It is limiting. I open myself up to all possibilities, as should any truly rational man.”
I strolled on Hampstead Heath, I visited my tailor in Mayfair and ordered expensive clothes – money was no object, as the Irishman’s credit was inexhaustible – I lunched at the Café Royal, and I drove in the Irishman’s carriage. On rare occasions he accompanied me, usually to the opera or the theatre, especially when an Italian singer was presented or there was an offering of Shakespeare, preferably a bloody tragedy.
Then I went back into my bedroom and took out my pistols. I have two – the service revolver I brought back from the East and a newer American Colt. One is a familiar old friend, but the other has a keen and deadly accuracy. If there was to be a standoff, I did not want to be left flatfooted.
Three patients. That wouldn’t seem a great number to an established physician with a thriving practice, but to me it was three more than I would have had a few months ago, when I often sat for hours waiting for even a single client to darken my door. It was during that period that I began to write down a few notes about the exploits of my good friend Sherlock Holmes. Just for my own amusement, of course, since many of his cases involve the great and mighty of this and other lands, and most are of a sensitive and often personal nature. But I find that I enjoy penning these narratives. I flatter myself that I have a flair for framing a story and parroting dialogue. Perhaps I might try my hand at something for the theatre one of these days.
“Good heavens, Wiggins!” I exclaimed. “It’s been an age since I’ve seen you. How old are you now?”
“But they got most of them,” James added. “I had a note from Mick – he says all of Scotland Yard is in a tizzy over this affair!”
But that left one person yet unspoken of. “And Dilly Mitchell?”
I wanted nothing more than to strangle him! “Holmes, you are the most confounding creature on earth! You readily insult your body with drugs for your own amusement, but when you are in real pain, then you deny yourself. Is that sensical?”
Until I found my gambling debts catching up with me. I was barred from my club until I paid my debts of honour. But my brother, already beginning to sink in his own financial seas, would not settle them. Then a fellow I considered a good friend became engaged. I also owed him money and he demanded it, needing all the ready cash he could gather to set up his new household. I gritted my teeth and paid all I had. Other creditors pressed me and I tried to make good. But my allowance was not enough. I resorted to the pawnshops of Holborn and gained a little money from my possessions, but it was still not enough. I asked for a loan from my countess, but she refused and broke off our liaison. Then the wife of the MP, deciding I was now a liability, closed her door to me. I began to panic, not knowing which way to turn.
“You were hit?”
Before he entered the carriage, the Irishman took out his pistol and checked the chamber. Then he hid it in the folds of his overcoat and stepped in beside me. Moments later we were off.
We were able to joke about it because all of the fearful anticipation, all of the awkwardness, dissipated in our fulfillment. It was as if we had been performing thusly for many years – giving and receiving mutual satisfaction, rejoicing in the discovery that our bodies fit together in a way I would have hardly thought possible. In a word – perfectly.
He’s a good actor, generally. He even told me he’d studied at RADA and spent a couple of seasons with a repertory company in Liverpool, doing Shakespeare, Shaw, and Panto, with him as the star, of course. Although it sounded like the kind of bragging story someone would make up, in Holmes’ case I believed him. He had that theatrical air about him, that over-the-top manner of the ham actor who is never off-stage, and that affected way of speaking that was either learned in Drama School or by growing up surrounded by aristocratic phonies – or both.
“I did!” Mick whined. Then he turned to me, his dark eyes tearful. “Don’t let him browbeat me, Doctor. I’m telling you everything!”
Mick Wiggins was pulled along roughly and the swooning Dilly Mitchell carried out of the flat while Lestrade stood over the corpse of William Fisher, a satisfied look in his eye.
“No burden, sir,” he said, but his face told a different tale.
“Dollar then,” said Holmes, rolling his eyes. “James, I am counting on you to keep this young rascal on the straight and narrow path. And if you ever think of going astray yourself, remember that I’ll tell your mother if you do!”
“Not quite that,” I said. “Eight years this autumn, as I recollect.”
“Don’t believe that, John,” Holmes said, staring into my face. “Do not doubt me! I left you in the dark because you are so open, so guileless, that Moriarty would have sniffed out the fact that the noose was tightening around him and all his empire. He would have read it in your face. Then your life truly would have been forfeit. I could not allow that to happen. Instead I placed you in a different kind of peril – and I will never forgive myself for that.”
Watson back in the real world.
“You are not ill yourself, old man?” he said, now all concern. “You look quite wrung out.”
The hansom entered into a dark area of London. The streets were narrower and the houses older and in ill repair. But there was an air of activity – men darting in and out of public houses and other buildings that seemed to have a sinister purpose. But I saw well-dressed gentlemen as well, mingling with the lower orders.
“If you feel well enough to travel, I’ll make the arrangements tomorrow!” he vowed. “I shall wire Mrs. Hudson and tell her to air out our rooms – as long as she promises not to touch anything! That damned woman and her dust-mop will be the death of me!”
“And then I was deucedly worried when you did not come to dinner,” Holmes pouted. “Are you ill, my dear boy?”
“Sodomites?” I exclaimed. “Whatever do you mean, Lady Percy?”
I left Mrs. Hudson to deal with the cat, while I sped up the stairs, unable to imagine who was waiting in the sitting room.
“Super, just super.” She stood and offered me her hand. “I’ll make the arrangements. Dr. Koenig will see that you find a place to live near the clinic. It shouldn’t be too difficult. Earl’s Court is chock-a-block with bedsits.”
“Of course,” Holmes sniffed. “A pair of petty malefactors named Harrington and Noonan. Fisher was not kicking in a fair share of the loot he was getting from the victims he and Wiggins and poor Dilly Mitchell were blackmailing. Instead, he was gambling with it – and losing. But the gambling dives in London are part of this greater syndicate, as are many of the lower public houses, opium dens, and brothels – including the one we patronized this evening. So Fisher’ cheating of his criminal fellows came swiftly to the attention of the brutal genius at the center of this vast enterprise, a man so dreaded that even his minions tremble to speak his name.”
My heart pounded like a hammer. I could picture the scene as clearly as if I had been there. “Did you never tell your brother?”
I immediately moved to the stricken man in the bed. His eyes were glazed, but he clutched at the sheets, unwilling to release them
“Not technically true, but close enough,” Holmes returned. “Now get yourself upstairs. We have unfinished business that won’t wait another moment.”
Two slanted green eyes stared back at me, impassively.
“Yes, you are,” said another voice.
“Servants are the eyes and ears of an estate, just as my Irregulars are the eyes and ears of London,” Holmes stated. “They know all, usually without being told. Secrets are the air that they breathe.”
“You frightened me, Watson,” said Holmes, his voice low and almost caressing. “Your face – I cannot describe it except to say you looked haunted. If you wish to confide in me, I promise that any confidences will be kept to the very grave.”
Alas, you can imagine how it was. I lost and continued losing. The gambling establishment allowed me credit, which they must have known I could not repay. But I plunged ahead, deeper and deeper, until I was all but lost. I realize now that it had all been decided beforehand. I was a dupe and never had a chance.
“No,” I replied. “I had better go now. I will return in the morning to change your bandage.”
I believe it saved my life. It certainly saved my sanity.
“I have eyes everywhere in this city – never forget that,” the Irishman hissed. “I know how you live and I know where you live. I have known it since the day you moved into that rat hole in Baker Street. It is beneath you, Johnny Lad! And Mr. Sherlock Holmes is beneath you. He fancies himself a genius, but he is a fraud. His egotism verges on the unbalanced. Mark my words – he will end up in an asylum before long. There’s a wide streak of insanity in the Sherringford family. The old Earl was barking mad – and so will be Mycroft and Sherlock in their turn.”
“’Allo, Charlie,” Thommie greeted him. “I’ve brought two amiable gentlemen.”
“Then let us scamper up to your undoubtedly unworthy lodgings and remedy the situation,” he said, taking my hand. “And afterwards I have a proposition for you. Is that satisfactory?”
There was no reply.
“I don’t have a normal life,” I returned. “I left so-called normal life behind long before I was wounded. My parents are dead and my brother and his family are in Australia. The friends I knew before I went into the Army aren’t the kind who would be of any help to a damaged man coming out of drug rehab. When I leave here...” I shrugged. “I don’t know what I’ll do.”
“Surely not,” said Holmes. “Now hand over that toast and tea. I’m as hungry as Gladstone after a brisk waddle across the sitting room. I couldn’t swallow even a morsel at dinner for concern about you.”
Sherlock Holmes was standing there, waiting for me. He was leaning against a lamppost, smoking his pipe thoughtfully.
“Certainly,” I replied. “Gladstone should be quite comfortable on the rug before the fire.”
I spent that first day in bed, hiding my face, refusing food. Another servant, a female this time, came and brought me water to wash and a clean nightshirt and a blue silk dressing gown. She told me to put it on.
The next day, after my brother left the house, I walked out, aimlessly. I found myself on the High Street, looking into windows, my hands shoved in my pockets, my misery at its height. That’s when I became aware of a large carriage halted in the road nearby. A familiar carriage with a crest on the side.
“My hand was unsteady from my anxiety over your situation,” he explained. “The Professor was holding your own sword to your throat. I had to act swiftly. And I was aiming for Moriarty’s head, just to be precise.”
John Watson graduates.
“I don’t know how to play Commerce,” I said, turning around. I was met with a long, thin face and a pair of cold, piercing grey eyes under a shining cap of black hair. “We weren’t permitted card games at my school.”
“Not intentionally,” he replied with a straight face.
The Irishman came back in the early evening. He poured me a small glass of burgundy, just like the first one.
“Here, Gladstone!” called James. “This way, boy!” The dog was off his lead and wandering in the direction of the lake.
“I’d make certain your water was always hot enough, sir,” James murmured. “If I was to work for you.”
Thommie was standing by a small bar at the back of the room. He was flushed from his toils, drinking a glass of beer to quench his thirst.
“Yes, sir,” he agreed. “Very different. But I don’t know what to do about it.”
I knew I must wait for word from Holmes and not lead the Irishman to his door. That would defeat all I had gambled upon. The only thing to do was to attend Stamford’s that evening and take dinner with him and his wife. That would discharge my final social obligation before I took leave of my old, simple, and cherished life.
The Irishman leaned back against the leather seat and carefully lit one of his long French cigarettes. He did not offer me one. He silently smoked for some moments, gazing out the window at the passing streets.
I had not walked halfway down the Esquiline Hill when I became aware that a carriage was following me. I lengthened my stride, but the carriage kept apace, slowing and speeding up to match me. I was apprehensive, but also full of champagne courage, so I stopped and challenged my pursuer. “If you want something of me, make yourself known!”
“Oh, yes, so he said.”
“Shall I pour you a cup, Holmes?”
“Of course,” he returned.
He leaned back. “You are an impertinent boy.”
“A fortnight?” I was standing by the fire, but my hands were like ice. “But I have brought no clothes with me. No possessions at all.”
Lady Lee finished the song to much applause. The creature curtsied and blew kisses as if he were on stage at Covent Garden. Then he began another number, even more obscene than the first, this one about a soldier with three legs – except one was decidedly not a leg.
Everyone. Except Holmes.
“I suppose it won’t do any harm,” Collins said grudgingly. He was not a hard man, but dealing with criminals every day had jaded him. But unlike some in positions of power, he seemed to have no wish to inflict undue hardship on the prisoners under his sway. “You may visit Wiggins and Mitchell.”
“Come now, man!” said Holmes. “Show us upstairs so we may wash and dress for dinner.”
“Take your cane,” came a voice from the sofa. “And if you think that beast can run you are even more deluded than our friend Lestrade.”
But would that be the whole of my life? I had always hoped for more. A home and family I might call my own. Domestic happiness. Things Holmes eschewed and even mocked outright.
And then there was the subject of Miss Morstan.
But what mattered to me?
Besides, I had so many questions I wanted answered. And Holmes was not the most forthcoming person in the world.
“I must go,” she said, standing abruptly. “I am meeting the Princess di Cristalli for tea and mustn’t be late.” She bent to kiss my cheek. “God bless you, John.”
Yes, he would forget me much sooner than I would forget him – which would be never.
“They sound perfectly suited,” I said.
“Yes.” I took out the pistol and checked the chamber. “Ready and loaded.”
“Pardon, Mr. Watson.”
“Harry and I will empty the bath in the morning, sir, while you’re at breakfast,” said James. “Mr. Lovell says that Mr. Mycroft ought to put in a bathing room, with a tub and pipes for the water, but he’s never here long enough to feel the need for one.”
It was the painting of my mother, Marianne Healy Watson, that once stood in my father’s study and which I had last seen in my brother’s house many years before.
In the face of the young man’s enthusiasm it was difficult to say no.
“Hush, my dear boy,” he replied. “There’s no need. No need at all.”
“If you will excuse me, please?” he said to them.
“Hardly!” he laughed. “James, my lad, why don’t you see if Mrs. Jenkins might send up some beef broth for the doctor. And tea, as well. For both of us.”
“No idea. Perhaps he had a brief Heavy Metal encounter there. Regardless of his choice of geography or his lamentable mixing of metaphors, Mr. Carson and I sadly parted ways.”
I got out of the bed and washed while she changed the dirty linen on which I’d been broken in. When I was clean, I put on the silk dressing gown and looked at myself in the mirror. I was still the same as I’d been before – my face still smooth, my hair in golden curls, and my eyes as blue as the Italian sky. But now I knew what I was, what I was born to be. Not a priest, or a solicitor, or a physician, or a even worthless layabout. I was a whore. A thing to be used by men stronger and greater than myself.
“Wife. Children. A secure home. A place to belong. A place to feel safe,” I whispered.
“And how do you know all this just from this wound?”
“You can tell me, Barton,” I coaxed. “If the lad is in trouble, then my intimate companion Mr. Sherlock Holmes will come to his aid, as he has for countless others, both great and humble. The major said it would be the ruination of their family, but surely it can’t be as bad all that.”
And she promptly burst into copious tears.
“Perhaps this is not the right time.” He turned his face away. “I feared it would not be the right time. But it never seems to be the right time. So often in the past I have wanted to... but then something always interfered. Something always stood in the way. Most often it was my own misgivings, or my own stubborn-headed pride, or... or something in your look that stopped me, as it has almost stopped me now. And then I could not. I dared not.”
Not a surprising development. As Holmes has often reiterated to me, blackmail is a vile crime that requires physical evidence, and inappropriate epistles are a common avenue for a scoundrel to harass a careless correspondent.
“That is a faint hope with such knaves!” Holmes cried as he kicked open the wooden door with a strength that always amazes me. “Stand down, Mr. Fisher! You will not escape now!”
Holmes peered at me with his relentless hazel eyes. “What is the matter, my dear friend? I have rarely seen you so flustered.”
“You’re oh so glad,” he said in the dark. “Oh so happy.”
“Yet this handwriting is not Irish,” Holmes opined. “It looks more like that of a man educated at a second-rate public school, probably in Derbyshire. With some Army background. Right-handed, too. But that’s obvious.”
“I’m not forgetful of the past,” I said, turning away. “The past sits on my shoulder like a great dark bird, blighting my very existence and making any future happiness impossible!”
But I was deceiving myself. I wanted to see him again, if only for one last time. There were so many things I needed to say to him, especially to explain to him why I was going away, even if it was a lie concocted for the occasion.
Finale: Safe in Baker Street.
The young man’s face fell. “I’m a good servant, Doctor, even if I’m just learning. Please don’t turn me away! Mr. Holmes – I appeal to you! Don’t send me back to Sherringford! If I have to stay there, I won’t be able to stand it. I want to be in London, where there’s people and things are happening. Nothing ever happens in Sussex. I’ll go mad down there.”
“Ah!” Holmes nodded. “And how is the clinic of the admirable Dr. Koenig? That is where you landed, isn’t it? He’s a former flame of the Director, so I assumed they wouldn’t hesitate to make use of your talents, not to mention your agreeable nature.”
“I imagine.” Holmes stood up and began pacing the room. The morphine was wearing off already and I feared he’d resort to another, stronger dose. “These people are beneath you!”
“Oh, very well,” he said, pulling the bedclothes up. “Now invite the bugger in!”
Holmes rolled his eyes. “Gladstone is as spoiled as ever and that scrawny alley cat is scrawny no longer. Wiggins will never be able to reclaim his pet. Mrs. Hudson and the girls have grown too attached to it.”
“I’m sorry but I must take my leave. I... I am not feeling too well.” I called for my hat and coat. “Please give my regards to your dear wife and to Miss Morstan.”
So many things told me to turn down Holmes’ offer. I knew so little about him – and what I did know left me puzzled and apprehensive. That his brother was ridiculously wealthy was evident, as was the fact that Holmes was the black sheep of some ancient and eccentric family.
I stared at the murky night and felt a yearning within that I knew would not be denied.
“Then I am not rational,” I said. “Because I assuredly am not a sodomite.”
“I have a friend who runs a clinic in Earl’s Court,” she continued. “He can always use a competent doctor. The pay isn’t stellar, but it’ll keep you busy. And you’ll be practicing again. Would you be interested?”
“I know,” Holmes said. “It is amazing. And in that time I have neither murdered anyone nor been murdered myself, which proves the supreme power of my self-control.”
I swallowed. “Until?”
We entered our chamber to find James asleep on the sofa. He sat up and rubbed his eyes. “Good heavens, Doctor! What happened to your head?”
“So they say,” Holmes agreed. “My ceaseless questions drove the Old Earl to distraction. And I went through tutors like he went through mistresses and steeds – using them hard until they were useless and then moving on to the next. And I excelled at many pursuits. My violin master wanted to take me to Vienna to study. He said I might be the next great virtuoso on that instrument and I must study composition and prepare myself for a career in the concert hall.”
That sent the women into paroxysms of giggling and fan-waving.
“Don’t move!” He ordered. “There may be a worse injury.”
And so I spent my first year of study. And I did well. I was not at the top of the class, but I was not at the bottom, either. Being in the anonymous middle was exactly where I wished to be, just one of many, not standing out in any way, either for good or ill. I put my expensive suits and my jewelry away and dressed somberly. I proceeded as I had among the Jesuits, eating simply, drinking not at all, exercising my body and expanding my mind – and I thrived on that regimen.
“Hardly,” Holmes sniffed. “Somewhere else altogether. The game is truly afoot, Watson! We go to find Mick Wiggins’ and Dilly Mitchell’s compatriots, and, I trust, clues to the killers of William Fisher. I mean to solve this case!”
“Of course, my dear fellow,” Holmes pronounced. “No strings whatsoever. We shall be bosom companions, as gentlemen lodgers were in the Old Days. And nothing more, as you would wish.”
“The tall bloke at the pub. He’s got a big cock, but yours is no smaller, I swear, sir!”
I shook my head. “It must be someone else who resembles me.”
“I can’t see the Channel from up here,” I said, squinting to the south. “Let alone France.”
Stamford laughed. “I know what you mean, old man. Women have marriage on the brain, that’s the truth. But it wouldn’t hurt you to meet the lady in question. It might even help.”
Holmes frowned. “Because the other room is my room and has been all of my life! Don’t be silly, Watson! This is the best solution. Trust me. And now, I believe I will take my rest. It’s been a long and tiring day.” And with that he turned over and buried his head in the pillow.
“Don’t add blasphemy to our presumed sins, my dear boy,” Holmes retorted. “If there is a Supreme Being who created these bodies, then assuredly He made them for such delight as this. Now, shut your mouth and fuck me once more, this time even more forcefully, if you would be so kind.”
“Of course I know all, my dear boy,” he said. “I would be a piss-poor consulting detective if I did not.”
“You are more beautiful than I had imagined, Johnny Lad,” he crooned as he caressed me afterwards. “I am intoxicated by you. Possessing you is a privilege I will not take for granted. You will be cherished, as you well deserve. And no one else will ever have you again. I will keep you safe and sound, I promise you that, my beauty.”
The footman entered, carrying a large silver tray. “I brought you tea and toast, sir. The toast is cut on the diagonal, just the way you like it. Couldn’t let you go to bed without a nibble, could I?”
“If you mean that little Mary Ann, then, yes,” said the warder. “He’s doing very poorly.”
“The Governor?” I frowned.
Would there be no way to escape him? No place where I could be safe from his malevolent sway?
“No matter.” He shrugged and reached for the morocco case. “I have other diversions.”
“Not eating anything will give you a right headache, that’s what my mum always says,” James maintained. “Let me bring you some toast at least. Cut on the diagonal, just the way you like it.”
“Your brother owns a block?” That made me uneasy. What on earth was I getting into? Who exactly was Holmes’ brother and how much was a block in Central London worth? I couldn’t even estimate it. “A block of buildings?”
Charles hesitated. “He said he’d kill Dilly if I told!”
He lifted an eyebrow at me. “Of course! What else?”
“And neither was I,” Mrs. Hudson returned tartly. “But I have one. And so do you. I will bring up your tea as soon as I’ve gotten this visitor settled in the kitchen.”
“Give that to me!” I exclaimed, taking it out of his trousers and into my own hand. “If you believe I will let you plunge into darkest Soho by yourself with only this infernal thing for protection, then more fool you!”
“Mrs. Jenkins had him down in the kitchen by the stove, but I thought he might pine there all by himself,” said James. “I hope it was right to bring him up here, sir.”
“And I swear I am not,” he said firmly. “And if our assailant had not been in such a hurry to kill me, which hindered his aim, we both might be the worse for a tear in your pants!”
“I will send him a note, telling him that you are visiting a friend and will be gone for a fortnight at least,” said the Irishman. “You will sign this note.”
I looked at him.
I stared at him, my face flushing. “If you knew I was in there, then why the devil didn’t you come in?”
We are getting deeper into the mystery...
Chapter 4
He directed James to place my grip on a low stool and then he withdrew. The footman hastily lit the hearth.
“I was born in Calcutta,” Miss Morstan confirmed. “But I was sent home at an early age after my mother died. My father was a captain, but he never served in Afghanistan that I know of.”
It was fruitless to protest. “Yes, James, toast would be splendid.”
“A meaningless landmark. Something that is nothing,” Holmes explained. “Built for the purpose of having something to look at where there was nothing before. Hence, the name – folly.”
But then a thought came to me. Perhaps if I enlisted her to my cause, she might help me? Might see her way to letting me escape?
“Yes,” he acknowledged. “I have known of your liaison with Professor Moriarty since the first week we lodged in Baker Street.”
“Good lad. That she might.”
“I’m not a lord,” Holmes drawled. “And never likely to be one. Let no man say that Sherlock Holmes cannot tie his own cravat!”
“Tonight you will attend my salon,” Lady Percy instructed. “There will be cards and music and conversation. Wear something suitable with a decent cravat. And if you are approached by someone who desires you, either male or female, be a man about it. It is time you grew up, John. Italy is the perfect school for learning about life. Tonight will be your first real lesson.”
Alive.
“I have every right,” Holmes retorted. “Mr. Wiggins was formerly in my employ. And Mr. Mitchell is connected intimately to my client and his case.”
“Nonsense!” Holmes exclaimed. “I am twice the man I was at 20 – stronger in body, more alert in faculties, and certainly my intellect is honed to a knife’s point, far sharper than I could ever have imagined as a mere callow youth.”
“Destiny. Kismet, as the Mohammedan would say. I believe that certain things are determined by a higher power. Certain meetings. Certain successes and failures. And that certain people are bound by fate to rule over others.”
“As do I,” I replied.
“Covent Garden?” I blinked. “Are you in need a some fresh vegetables? Or flowers for Mrs. Hudson?”
We dodged down an alleyway off Baker Street and into a secure garage where Holmes parked the Jag. The cab was waiting in front of the building. Holmes and I and the cabbie, tempted by a handful of ten pound notes, carried up my things.
Finally a hansom came by and I flagged it down. I brought out my trunk, my valise, and a box of books tied with twine. The cabbie loaded them into the boot and I climbed in, my medical bag at my side. I looked for all the world like a prosperous doctor starting off on a long vacation.
“You’re good with the little nippers,” said James as we walked back to Baker Street.
For the next three days I walked about in a muddle, unable to commit myself completely to the program, but also unwilling to allow myself to be taken over by the overwhelming personality of Holmes.
Mrs. Hudson crossed her arms over her ample bosom. “Have you ever heard ‘fight like cats and dogs,’ Doctor? Because it isn’t just a saying, you know.”
“The loo,” Holmes confirmed. “Too many cups of tea in the middle of the night.”
“Henry!” I cried, stepping towards him.
“A medical emergency,” he informed me. “There has been a summons to Campton Grange, which is the next estate over. Someone has been injured.”
Holmes glowered. “Gentlemen like Charles Griffith?”
I frowned. “I have never heard of those, Holmes. Are they taverns?”
“I make no judgments about tastes, warped or otherwise,” Holmes replied. “But the lad’s nature is what it is. A leopard cannot change its spots, nor a tiger its stripes. Fear not, Charles, your so-called sins are not my concern. So, this light-of-love was not exactly a lady. But he was a prostitute, am I correct?”
“Oh, Colonel!” gushed one silly woman. “Were you wounded?”
And I lay in bed, also thinking.
Resolved! Nothing was resolved! In fact, things were more complicated than ever. How would we live, now that we were breaking the law every time we committed those acts deemed as ‘gross indecency’? James knew the truth, and I was certain that Mycroft, in his saturnine way, also knew. But what of Mrs. Hudson and the girls? Could Holmes and I live under her roof as lovers and keep them all oblivious?
“The consummation?” I recognized the quote. The Irishman loved to show off his knowledge of Shakespeare. But this quote referred to death. To self-slaughter. “To be or not to be.” Under the circumstances I became even more afraid. I backed away, but there was nowhere to go. No escape. The windows were barred and the house infested with the Irishman’s minions. I would look like a fool attempting to run.
I felt the Irishman’s eyes on me before he spoke.
Once we were in his flat, I felt uneasy. But he gave me no time to think – he had my kit off swiftly and deftly and before I knew it we were in the bedroom, getting down to the business at hand. He didn’t bother with questions such as top or bottom, or niceties such as what I might prefer or not prefer. He was in charge and that was that. Luckily, he believed in safe sex because I was so out of practice for the complete act that I didn’t even go out prepared, more fool I!
“In the East Wing,” Lovell returned. “In the Earl’s old room. It has just been aired.”
I told the Irishman I was not sorry for the choices I have made and I reiterate that statement. I would not trade these past eight years for any amount of money or any measure of fame or fortune.
The Irishman gave the coachman the order and he turned. A few minutes later we stopped before the old building. It was very late and the street was dark and still.
I rubbed my aching head. “James, I hate to repeat myself, but we have no need of a valet – truly.”
I met Holmes on the steps in front of Campton Grange. The major had not seen him out. In fact, the house, which was full of family and servants, seemed strangely deserted, as if holding its breath.
I wondered if Fred knew I was gay, if that information was in my medical records somewhere. Not that it should matter. Although it had always mattered. Mattered to my disapproving father and my disgusted brother. Mattered to my commanding officer in Afghanistan, who suggested I keep it to myself even though the official policy of the British Army was tolerance and acceptance.
Fear crept up my spine like a spider. “Is it that dangerous?”
“Yes,” she replied. “I don’t know why you have agreed to this arrangement and I don’t want to know, but it is not too late to escape. You are a mere child, John. You have your whole life ahead of you. Do not waste it... this way.”
My old St. Bart’s dresser, Stamford, the very fellow who introduced me to Holmes, invited me to dinner. He’s lately married and, as all newlyweds are wont, he and his bride are determined that everyone they know should also be married. To that end they invited me to dine with them in their new house in Chelsea – a house apparently paid for by the in-laws, who have also set Stamford up in practice.
“But how did you know?” I probed. He did not answer. “Then why don’t you play yourself? You could win a lot of money.”
The door creaked open. It was one of the counselors, George, a wizened former heroin addict with tattoos covering his skinny arms. “Fred says this area is off-limits during evening hours. And the film is over -- it’s time for Final Affirmations.”
A sad-eyed woman in a faded blue cardigan held up her hand. “I’m Betty and I’m addicted to prescription sedatives. I just want to say that I’m so very happy to be here and I’m glad to be getting help with my problem. Everyone here is so supportive and I’m happy to be here.” She paused, flustered. “I already said that. But I am happy to be here.”
“Yes,” she said. “The young man who answers your door in Baker Street. I left my card a number of times in the past week, ever since Dr. Stamford said you were back in London. But then when you did not answer my notes...”
“Only if you come with me.” His eyes pinned me like a butterfly is pinned to a board.
“That they were. But they were thugs for hire. Such fellows are clumsy and I detest clumsiness. Here. I give you back these.” He took a sheaf of papers from his coat. “It was beyond foolish to rack them up. Pray do not do it again.”
“So, you found him! Is the man dangerous?” I asked in alarm.
“Damn you to Hell, sir!” the major sputtered. “I’ll have you thrown out of this house on your ear!”
“Your wound... You... shouldn’t be riding.” My mouth was dry, but my hands were wet, somehow. With mud. And... something else. Something warm in the cold mire. “Oh, God! Where is Moriarty?”
“That he was going to put me in the Earl’s room.”
I strode past the servant into the parlour. Over the mantel, where an old Spanish masterpiece once had hung, was a new work. Or not exactly new, but new to that place. It was a portrait of me, done not by the Sicilian in Italy, but by a fashionable portraitist in Paris. I looked like a young and arrogant lord in my expensive suit, my hair golden and my head tilted at a haughty angle.
“Doctor?” James called once more. “Are you all right?”
“I told you before you left for India that it was a confounded mistake!” he exclaimed, his voice rising in anger. “It was one thing to waste your time with useless medical studies, but to throw away your life in the Army of the damned British Empire? You could have ruled a real empire by my side, here in London! Instead, you almost lost your life and did lose your health – and your looks! – in a cause that is beyond worthless.”
“No, that wouldn’t be right,” I said. “You must be hungry, James. Why don’t you go down to the kitchen? Mrs. Hudson will find you some supper and a place to sleep tonight.”
Not that I expected him to.
But I cannot! Cannot think. Cannot remember!
Confusion...
“I want to...” I began hesitantly. “To say that I’m glad I’m here.” It sounded so cliché, but I plunged ahead. “I need to be here. I couldn’t handle the pressure... or the pain all on my own and so I relied on the drugs until I couldn’t handle them either. But I have to do it now. So I want everyone’s help. I would be happy to have everyone’s help.”
It was an invitation to the opening of a new art gallery in Bond Street. Scribbled at the bottom were the words: “You will find something of interest here, Mr. Sherlock Holmes.”
“I have engaged an attorney for the boys,” said Holmes, imperiously. “Mr. Humbolt Savage, barrister. He, along with their solicitor, Mr. Leland Grooms, will be seeing them tomorrow. In their absence, I am to be their representative. I have brought Dr. Watson, who is known to you as a first-rate physician, to examine them and ascertain the state of their health. I believe Mr. Mitchell is ill.”
“I am leaving.”
He slipped his arm under my neck and lay his head upon my shoulder – my scarred shoulder. But never had that mangled skin ever craved a touch so much.
“Yes,” Charles agreed. “We all warned him, but Reggie wouldn’t be dissuaded. He wrote the boy verses and enticed him to my room when I was out. There he seduced him. The boy cried and fought, but Reggie had him anyway. Then he ran home and told his father. After that there was the devil to pay.”
I petted Gladstone, knowing James would see to him. Then I went into my bedroom and set about packing the few possessions I wished to take with me. The rest I would leave here. Holmes could do whatever he wished with them. Perhaps he would seek out a new man to share lodgings, but I doubted it. There were few who would put up with his myriad eccentricities, and he was so much the misanthrope that there were few he could stand in close quarters for very long. He once told me that even at university, where most men make their dearest and longest-lasting friends, he had only one close companion, and even that fellow drifted away after Holmes left his college, typically without feeling the need to take his degree.
“Whatever! Now shut up and lie still!” I ordered. Then I glared at Holmes’ brother. “And I need that water now, if you please.”
“Your aid is not necessary, I assure you!” I finally told him. “I am not going to fall and break into pieces!”
“Look me in the eye,” I begged, stalling for a few moments longer. “You know I didn’t betray you.”
“I’ll go climb into me duds,” said Thommie. “Wait right here, gentlemen. I’ll be back in two shakes.” And the boy disappeared through the side door.
“Don’t know how you manage with Holmes,” Stamford remarked. “He’s certainly a queer duck. I don’t think I could live with him as long as you have.”
“Oh.” Holmes shrugged. “Mycroft’s only physical pleasure is in gratifying his stomach, his single vice exercised at the table. He has his meals sent to him at the Diogenes Club from the Café Royal and he demands only their best. Consequently, he had his cook here trained by a Frenchman brought for the purpose from Paris. Even though Mycroft is only resident in this house for a few weeks a year, he could not countenance the thought of bland British cooking for that period. Hence, this is the best place to eat in all of West Sussex, even including the dining room at the Albert Hotel in Chichester, which is accounted the finest in the area. Does that answer your question, Watson?”
The side door opened and another figure emerged. This was a slender lad with black hair and huge dark eyes. He was wearing only a silk robe, which he swiftly doffed. His body was pale and soft compared to the taller man. They made a studied contrast that was quite enticing. I held my breath as they began caressing and kissing each other.
“Here,” I said, taking out my own matchbox. I lit his pipe and watched him take a draw.
In that I mean the details of life and limb.
“Yes,” said Holmes. “I need to stretch mine as well. Too much coffee this morning. It goes through me like a sieve.”
“Of course, my dear lady!” I said, feeling the depth of her distress. “Let us talk of things that are more lighthearted.”
“But...”
He returned to the carriage and the door slammed. I watched the conveyance clatter down the narrow street into the enveloping darkness.
“That is more than satisfactory, my good fellow,” said Holmes. His fingers dug into my arm in excitement. “Now we are getting somewhere,” he whispered to me.
“The Guv’nor give it to me. Told me it would bring me luck ’cause him wot wore it before was a good man who brought him luck, too.” Wiggins raised an eyebrow. “Didn’t know he meant you, Doctor. He holds you highly, does the Guv.”
“All right.” I stood up and headed to the shower, but then I stopped. “Where did you say this building was again?”
“But the evening is still young, Watson! We were planning a few hands of cards,” said Stamford.
“The tender and honest emotions of a lady can never be misconstrued, my dear Miss Morstan,” I told her warmly. “I cannot promise that I will never be put into such a position in the future, but I assure you that I will take as much care for my own life as I would for yours, if it were to be placed in my hands.”
I found digs just off the Cromwell Road and not far from Dr. Koenig’s clinic. The room was a basic bedsit, with the W.C. on the landing and half a window that overlooked the landlady’s back garden. But I didn’t really care because I spent almost every waking hour at the clinic. In truth, I buried myself in my work, which was exactly what I needed.
Secret.
“James?” I looked up in surprise. “Holmes took James away? Did he send him back to Sussex?”
“You will return to Mrs. Hudson’s parlour and go to bed,” Holmes ordered. “Let Watson alone – for now.”
“Yes,” he said. “I cannot have you remain in London until time has permitted things to be confirmed between us. And I am sure you do not wish to be shut up in this house for months at a time.”
“How are you getting on with Holmes?” asked Stamford. He was watching me carefully.
“I say... wait a moment!” I seized Holmes by the sleeve.
“Well...” I hesitated. But then I thought of Holmes. He would not begrudge the lad because he was not of his own class. No man looked at all his fellows, both high and low, as equals in quite the manner that Sherlock Holmes did. “Yes, Wiggins. I should be pleased to see your room.”
I knew the works. And I knew the painter, a short, stocky Florentine with a profuse beard. I remember vividly the days when he came to the villa in Capri with his paints and canvases. The sun was hot and I drank a lot of wine – I was always drinking wine then, the vintage they call the Tears of Christ. Wine is the water of forgetfulness, they say, but I have not forgotten. The Irishman sat in the shade and watched while the little man painted.
“This is a major muddle,” I muttered. “Did you clean the wound? Did you apply some salve? And what is this you have used for a bandage?”
“Come and have a drink with me, Doctor,” he said. And he was already pulling at my arm.
Holmes advanced on the bed and observed the marks on my young patient, a deep red wound ringing his neck.
“I appreciate your consideration, James.” I rose from the water and he immediately wrapped me in a large, soft towel. “I can dry myself, if you please.”
“If you will leave us alone, Mrs. Griffith,” I said, seeing her to the door. “I will examine your son.”
If I had been heart-sick before, now I was crushed by what I saw there.
“I thought if I wanted anything I was to use the bell-pull and ring for them?”
“You’d use up your entire wound pension before the summer was out,” said Holmes, reaching for his pipe.
That is when Mrs. Hudson knocked at the door and came in with the tea. “I see you are already familiar with your visitor, Doctor.” She set down the tray and arranged the cups on the table. I noticed that a new cup with a different pattern had replaced the one that had been broken accidently.
“Mycroft owns gobs of real estate,” Holmes said dismissively. “Inherited it. Nothing to do with him at all. He’s a shockingly bad businessman, but he has people who do all of that for him. So you’ll come and see the flat?”
“I know,” I acknowledged. “But this is a personal matter that I must attend to.”
“Good man,” said Holmes. “Let us advance.”
“I will have you, Johnny Lad,” he whispered. “You may count upon it. I will have you, body and soul. Because I know what you want and what you need: a man who is everything to you – friend, companion, comrade-in-arms, father, brother, and lover. Together we will defeat all our enemies and rule a dominion unseen by men without vision. Once I thought I had found my perfect soul-mate, but he proved false. One day he will pay for that rejection. But you will not reject me, John. I will have you. I will be the first to possess you. And then I will always own you.”
There was still one way.
“Yes,” I said nervously.
I narrowed my eyes at him. “You never take more than coffee and a crust of toast! You fed the dog all that food on purpose, just to plague me! You knew the effect it would have upon his digestive tract!”
Although I had been dreading it, all in all, it was a most pleasant dinner. The food, from the soup to the fish to the stewed beef to the dessert of cherry ice, was first-rate. Mrs. Hudson is a good, plain cook, but Stamford – with the help of his in-laws – had engaged a very fine cook indeed.
But a few days later I was sitting at a café near the Spanish Steps when a shadow fell across my English newspaper.
“No, wait,” he said, sitting up with some difficulty. “There is something I must say first.”
“Why, Watson, you sound like a Socialist,” Holmes laughed. “Or a lapsed Catholic rethinking his beliefs.”
“Ghastly,” I replied.
All was as it was. And yet nothing was as it was.
The Irishman deftly stripped off my clothes and pushed me back onto the curtained bed. I flailed at him, but he was like a phantom, everywhere and nowhere. And he had me in every way possible and then he had me again, and yet again, but he was a hazy presence, the pleasure and the pain muted.
“Yes, I remember you,” I said.
“Yes, yesterday. He seems a harmless duffer.”
How could this be happening now, of all moments? Tomorrow I would be leaving. But tonight...
“I understand, my dear boy,” he said. “I am not a beautiful young boy, like that fellow at Cleveland Street. Or even like the captivating Mick Wiggins. I’m older than you and my experience of... of love is limited and probably lacking. I realize that I am hardly the picture of a desired love object for a man like you – a man who can have anyone he desires, male or female.”
“No matter, James,” I sighed, observing the young man’s distress. “I won’t say a word. I can see that this visit is to be full of unsettling revelations.”
She looked at me as one looks at a silly, wayward child who is racing towards the edge of a cliff. “You left Rome last time without taking my husband’s stickpin. I promised it to you.” She opened her reticule and took out a small velvet box. “I was hoping to meet you today, so I carried it with me.”
“Oh, I will. I certainly will. I only thought you were different. Above the common crowd. That you had a little spirit. An ability to think for yourself.” He was babbling now, his mouth going at a manic rate. “But I was wrong. Totally, utterly wrong. A fool to think that you...”
And I hoped beyond hope that I would see Sherlock Holmes at least once more before that irrevocable moment came.
I watched the card players a while longer, then went in search of a plate of food. The champagne and wine had been flowing, so the company was now louder and more congenial. I went out on the terrace to eat. There I saw the tall man, surrounded by a knot of admirers, most of them women. I crept closer. He was regaling them with stories of the late war in America. From my eavesdropping I learned he was an American with a large estate in Virginia, and had been an officer on the Southern – the losing – side of the conflict.
“Never!”
And I got out of Campton Grange as fast as I was able.
“And I say you should go downstairs now!” Holmes flared.
“I was wondering when you’d arrive, my dear boy,” said Holmes. “Good Lord, you look like hell. Bad night?”
“Hardly,” I sniffed.
“An old soul,” I said. “Born time and again.” I didn’t actually believe in reincarnation, but it somehow fit Holmes. He was in his thirties, but his expression often seemed both ancient and ageless.
“I have not in many years,” I maintained, my nerves rattled. “And one that traffics in... in sodomy is beyond the pale!”
“This is not necessary, surely!” I protested. “I can undress myself!”
“John,” he said, reaching out his hand to touch my face.
And still others seemed to be in more dubious exile, gentlemen, mostly wealthy and often titled, who had eschewed their native land for reasons I found obscure. They gathered in the cafés of Rome and Florence, or in villas along the Grand Canal, or they loitered in Saint Mark’s Square, smoking and gossiping as they watched the passing parade. These men intrigued and puzzled me. They also took a keen interest in me and my welfare. They were constantly inviting me to visit them in their rooms, or to take in some interesting local taverns that were off the beaten path, or to travel with them to points south – Naples, Capri, Sicily, Greece, and even Morocco. I would not have to worry about money, they would be happy to pay my way. And they offered gifts, sometimes small tokens of wine or candy, but other times more expensive things, silver cigarette cases or even articles of jewelry. But I consistently declined such offerings.
“Soho?”
I smiled at the revelation of Holmes as Puck, orchestrating rehab, both the inane and the sublime, for his own amusement.
“I say, Watson,” I heard Holmes remark to my back. “Pray forgive me. It has been a long and tiring day.”
“Yes?” She paused in the midst of picking up Holmes’ cup.
“I am not too familiar with the Indian regiments or with the eastern regions,” I said. “After Maiwand I was invalided home from Peshawur by way of Bombay.”
“Thank you, James.”
“When I was a lad of about fourteen,” he began. “I was living at Sherringford, of course, and being schooled by tutors. My parents were on their travels and Mycroft was at Cambridge, at Trinity, where he proved himself a prodigy, which was no surprise to anyone who knew him. But I was not far behind as a child wonder. But my mind was of a different sort than Mycroft’s. My mind was active and questing, while his has always been passive. He let information come to him and then he dealt with it as an intellectual exercise, as he does now for Her Majesty’s government. But I was ever a seeker, wandering the downs of Sussex, exploring, asking questions, gathering data and specimens. The world seemed full of marvels and I wished to know everything! Science, Art, Music, Philosophy – I breathed in knowledge as if it were air.”
“You’re bleeding!” he cried. He began to handle me all over, as if searching for a wound.
We stood on the dock and waved the ship away, watching James and Mick on the deck until they were mere specks, and until the ship was lost in the mists of the Irish Sea.
“Yes. I was wounded at Maiwand.”
That teaching served me well in my medical studies. And it served me well in Her Majesty’s service. And it has served me in my excursions, my adventures if you will, with Mr. Sherlock Holmes.
Holmes stared at the fellow with an appraising eye. “I am Sherlock Holmes and this is my intimate friend, Dr. Watson. We are here to collect a few belongings of a friend of ours, Mr. Michael Wiggins, who is... um... going to be away for a short while.”
“I’m right flush,” Wiggins said. “I go to the music hall and have a pint any time I like. I even went down to Brighton the summer last with a bloke I know. I even bathed in the sea, I did! And I owe it all to the Guv’nor.”
I was not sure whether to proclaim my unease at being in the bed of such royal infamy, at being in that same bed with my intimate friend and compatriot, or at learning that he was the scion not just of a wealthy family, but of a titled one.
“We have nothing to tempt her out of hiding!” I said in exasperation. “This room is barely bigger than a closet. Where can a cat conceal itself in such a place?”
“Holmes!” I cried. “Come and look at this!”
“When we return to London we shall take the railway coach,” Holmes pronounced. “It is noisy and crowded, but I believe the smoother ride upon the rails will be better for you, my dear fellow.”
“Careful,” I cautioned. Too much movement was still very painful and I feared the wound would open, leading to another dangerous infection. But it was worth a chance to...
Unless, of course, Sherlock Holmes is present. Then the entire endeavour is reduced to farce. Excellent farce, but farce nonetheless.
“Of course you can, John,” said the Irishman in his softest voice. “You will begin tonight.”
“It’s only dinner,” I said in exasperation. “I’m not going to run off with the female to Gretna Green on the midnight train!”
“Some things are,” I replied. “Others... not so much. But I am out to learn. Which is why I’m here.”
“Bring the gentleman over to my table. I am always willing to make the acquaintance of like-minded fellows.”
