Sam just shook his head and continued eating.
Both out of breath, they laid there, their chests heaving, neither willing to be the first to move.
: I'm really sorry, but I can't go out tonight. Can we reschedule for tomorrow?
Worry flashes through Gabriel's eyes for a second before he covers it with obviously feigned ignorance. "Who's that?"
After only a minute, the other three wander up and inside to check it out, and Cas can't stop smiling. "They love it. I love it." He says, warmth and an unfamiliar feeling spreading through his body.
"Better?"
By Friday, Cas has filled out paperwork with Ellen and already started work for her, and Bobby had said he'll have things ready the next week. He's texted with Dean a few times, all work related, and Dean said his brother should have their paperwork ready the next week as well, but it'll be at least another week before he has any work for Cas.
"Nothing man. You're just... eating bacon. That's real bacon, you know." Dean said, grinning.
He heard Cas take a deep breath, then said "I would like to take you on a date." Cas looked down, seeming embarrassed.
Or, in reality, he's afraid to see him. After the last time, the hug Cas gave him that was so full of warmth and gratitude, Dean's afraid when he sees him again that he won't see any of that, and everything will just be back to the way it was before; when Cas was dating someone else and Dean was nothing more than his daughter's friend's dad, and his boss, essentially.
So many thoughts were flying through Dean's head. 'I'm kissing him. So amazing. Mmm so good. So hot. Cas' skin. I want. Need more.' Dean gipped Cas' hips and pulled him down closer to himself, causing Dean to make a pleased noise.
"Uh, yeah." Dean rubs the back of his neck with his hand, looking down. After a moment, he looks back up into Cas' too blue eyes, telling himself he can do this. "That guy was a jerk."
? Come on.
"Jack. Hello. What... Did you need something?" Cas asked, trying to catch his breath and act normal.
"I love you too" Cas said back, letting himself drift off to sleep in Dean's arms. Finally.
"So, what do you guys do?" She asked. Just then, the waitress returned with their food. As she set the plates in front of them, Dean and Cas looked at each other.
The girls are talking Charlie's ear off, and Dean is looking at him with something unreadable, and he just wants to go home.
"Just let me explain, please." Dean said, standing right behind Cas.
Cas sat there, on top of Dean, breathing heavily and staring into his face. "I could've lost you. Again." He whispered.
Cas sits at the kitchen table staring at the stack of papers in front of him. The words blurred, ink smudged from the tears dripping onto the pages.
Dean slings the bag over his shoulder, and walks to the door, unable to stop himself from taking one last look at Cas. The look on Cas' face is heartbreaking, but he doesn't get to do that. He's made his choice, and it's not Dean. Shaking his head again, Dean turns, grabs his keys back up, and walks out the door, not even noticing the tulip he steps on on his way.
By the time he's loaded up on his bus and is pulling out of the station, he can almost see the dark cloud following him around.
Naomi stares her blank stare at him again, then sighs. "You should have called an ambulance. You are not to go off route. If it is an emergency, you call it in and wait for an ambulance. Understand?"
Cas did the same, grazing his eyes over every inch of Dean. Nothing would ever come close in beauty to what he was looking at. He looked down at Dean's own hard cock. He was bigger than Cas imagined, having only felt it through his pants.
"Beer's fine for now, thank you." Cas replied, taking the seat.
"Dean?" Cas asked, looking at him.
"Where is it? Buses won't run much later, so let's get it before it gets too late."
Cas sighs, but Dean can tell he's trying not to smile when he dips his spoon in and takes a bite. He watches as Cas contemplates, then shrugs. "It's alright." He says after a minute.
"Damnit Cas, stop!" Dean said. He reached forward and grabbed Cas' arm, holding him in place. Dean moved forward until he was direct in front of Cas, then he leaned in. He wanted to show Cas, rather than tell him, all the things that had been running through his head for the last four miserable days.
He laid back on the couch, kicking his feet up and resting his head on the arm of the couch. In this position, last night, he had gotten the closest to Dean hed ever been. He wanted that again. Not just the sexual part of it, though that was amazing. No, he wanted to hold Dean, for Dean to finally let his guard down and accept how Cas felt about him.
, running wild around the bus, squawking and flapping around, feathers flying everywhere.
"Hello mister Winchester." Claire says.
The feeling of pure pleasure that traveled through Cas' body at Dean's touch was completely new to him. He unintentionally bucked his hips up, throwing his head back.
Dean smiles at the politeness. "Hey. Please, call me Dean. It's nice to meet you."
"Come with me?" Cas asks, a mix of confident and vulnerable that is so endearing Dean can't stand it. Dean nods and reaches for his wallet, but Cas stops him. He pulls out the money Dean gave him earlier, sets it on the bar, and once they throw their jackets on, he grabs Dean's hand, pulling him up and leading him to the door.
"What about you? You don't have to tell me, I understand if it's too personal." Dean says, and he's so sincere about it that Cas knows he really has to.
"Hey, I take offence to that. I'm not a random woman." Courtney stated, taking a sip from her liquor glass.
"How long was I out?" Dean asked.
Michael means nothing to him. Dean is everything, and Cas doesn't know if Dean will forgive him for this.
Speaking into his hands, Cas finishes. "I've never been with anybody. I've never dated or even tried to date." He drops his hands again but doesn't look up. "I never intended on being with anybody before I-" he cuts himself off, biting his lip. He knows that Dean knows he wanted to die, but saying it now, after everything, it just doesn't seem right.
Dean just stood there for a minute, digesting everything Cas had said. His heart was beating so hard he was sure Cas could hear it. He closed his eyes, and when he opened them he looked into the depths of Cas' blue eyes. "Did you mean what you said?"
Cas leaned forward and placed a kiss to Dean's forehead. "So that was okay?" He asked.
Cas squirted a bit of the liquid onto his fingers, rubbing it around with his thumb, and looked at Dean again, searching for confirmation that he was ready.
"Get out!" Dean drunkenly yelled, throwing the empty glass in his hand past Sam's head, shattering it against the wall.
Dean reached his right hand forward and placed it on the back of Cas' neck. Then he slowly leaned forward and pressed his lips to Cas'. Each time they'd done this, a shot of electricity had raced through Dean's entire body, and this time was no different. He snaked his left hand around Cas's waist and pulled him flush against himself. He felt Cas relax and lean into it. Dean gently pressed his tongue against Cas' lips, and Cas willingly opened his mouth to accept it.
Raising his head slowly, he looked up, straight into Cas' face.
Cas is still standing there just staring at him with a bemused expression. "You want to help me?"
"That's okay." Cas says as he stops at the end of the bed. "What happened? I got your voicemail, I'm so sorry it took me so long." It hurts to see his daughter in a hospital bed, and he's trying really hard to keep it together.
He wants to ask what happened, why he left, why he didn't say anything. He wants to know so badly, the words are on the tip of his tongue. But the moment passes, and Cas just doesn't have the nerve to ask. To know why the man he loved left him without even a note.
In response, Dean pressed his body down and forward, rubbing their hard lengths together through their pants, and causing Cas to let out the most wonderful sound Dean had ever heard. Dean muffled his moans with his mouth, loving the feel of Cas moaning into him as Dean continued to press and rub their bodies together.
"But-" Dean started.
Cas kisses down Dean's neck, nibbling as sucking as he goes. "Wanted you since that first day." Dean says, breath hitching as Cas leaves a mark on his neck. "Just don't want to mess this up."
Cas rolls his eyes at her almost slip of the tongue. "It doesn't matter, it was a long time ago." If he's being honest with himself, it does matter. But, since he has no idea why what happened did happen, it's pointless to get into that right now.
Cas stood up, nodding. The two walked out of the room, down the hall toward the dorms.
"I am."
"Yeah, baby. I did." He replies, because he never could deny anything relating to Cas. Emma snuggles into his side, and his puts his arm around her. "So, you wanna watch a movie?" He's sure she'll want to know more, but for now he just needs to sit with these feelings, with the knowledge that Cas is back, and that their kids are friends.
Finally it registered to Dean, and he pulled his mouth off of Cas. Breathing heavily, he looked into Cas's face. "What's wrong?"
"Yeah, thanks" Dean responded, grabbing a mug and filling it with the hot liquid.
"I see you're not denying it, Dean." Courtney stated, turning her gaze to him.
He lowers Dean gently onto the bed, then crawls up after him, kissing along his bare chest as he goes. "Tell me what you want, Dean." Cas says against him. He runs his lips over, gently lapping at one of his nipples. Dean groans, back arching off the bed as Cas sucks it into his mouth.
Dean rolled his eyes, turning back to Cas. Cas just shrugged. "Sure Sam, we'll help."
They hang out for over an hour, but when Gabriel shows up Dean insists they leave to give them some family time. Cas wants to tell him that they're family, because what is family but what Dean's been to them, but he doesn't and let's them go.
"So, Emma was telling me about this ice cream place downtown, not far from Uncle Gabe's place. She said they're the best and we have to try it. They even have black tea ice cream, which I know is your favorite."
Of course Dean's here for the chickens. It's the same reason he's been texting every day.
Dean slowly moved, getting himself off of Cas and standing up, as Cas sat up on the couch.
Dean smiled, leaned over and kissed him, then slid to the edge of the bed and stood up.
"You know damn well who it is. And by your reaction, you knew and you purposely didn't tell me. What the fuck, Gabriel?!"
"So, you stayed the night?" Claire asks her dad, while piling her plate full.
"Thank you Cas" he said, meeting Cas at the back of the car.
A spark of annoyance but also worry goes through him. Either Dean's calling because of what he said before he left, or something happened.
Cas pulled his head back, looking into Dean's lust blown eyes. He smiled a little, then roughly crashed his lips to Deans, rolling his hips so that his hard cock rubbed against Dean's. Dean moaned loudly, attempting to move to gain more friction. Cas stopped moving, holding Dean's body in place.
So basically, he's just gotten 2 jobs, thanks to Dean, while sitting in bed, when he'd been around town for over three hours the other day and got nothing.
Cas shook his head and back away from Dean. "Like I said. Do whatever you want."
"Would you like to talk about it?" Cas asks, pulling back to look at him. And, of course Dean tells him.
The next day, Fern Guy is back, but he's not carrying anything. He gets onto the bus, flashes his pass, and sits down in a regular seat.
Cas shrugged. "Research" he said.
Cas felt Dean's pants getting wet against his palm, and continued rubbing until he could feel Dean's body relax, signaling he was finished.
Cas makes his way into the room, and when Dean sees him, he tries to pull away to get up but Cas can see Claire's hand tighten where its gripped in his shirt.
Dean full out smiles now. "Little trouble maker with a red scrunchie? Sounds accurate."
Dean shook his head and smiled. "Nothing. You're just... really hot." Dean laughed.
Dean chuckled a little more "it's a figure of speech. The circulation is cut off some. You just need to put it in another position. Here" Dean said, taking Cas' right leg and stretching it behind his back along the couch. He felt Cas wiggle his toes.
Dean squeezed his hand a couple more times, in time with his mouth, and he felt Cas' hot liquid shoot down his throat. He tried to swallow it all, but it was a new sensation for him, and he ended up choking a bit, having to pull his mouth off and let some of it drip onto the bed.
"Its not about that, Dean" Cas responded, hurt leaking into his voice.
Dean begins to grind his hips, pulling back then thrusting back in, and Cas throws his head back, feels Dean's lips and teeth on his neck, hoping he leaves a mark. Holding the back of Dean's head, encouraging him to. He feels the sting of pain, the warmth of Dean's tongue over it, and it feels so fucking good.
Dean could feel a grin spreading across his face, and he looked back at Cas. "This is awesome." He said.
Cas looked at Dean, studying the way he was laying, then moved to copy his position. Once he was settled, he looked at Dean.
Cas holds the money out that Dean gave him. "I wouldn't feel right taking this."
"Dean, I didnt want to upset you. I'm sorry" he said, turning off the water.
"Look, he doesn't know that I'm your brother. We never met back then, and he doesn't even know my last name. He just comes in here for coffee. And pie. Always with the damn pie. I only know who he is because of the shop name. Oh, and I'm kind of friends with his brother."
"Trust me, sweetheart" Dean laughed. "I dont think that. I've met many, many women, and you're nothing like them."
Cas makes a quick sandwich, eating standing up at the kitchen island, before heading upstairs and jumping in the shower. Once he's clean and dressed, he plugs his phone in to charge and crawls into bed, worry still at the forefront of his mind.
"No," Cas says, and relief flows over Dean's face. "It's still there, in the back of my mind sometimes. But usually when it starts getting bad, I just" he bites his lip again, and feels himself blush. "I think of you and it makes it go away."
As he climbs into bed and turns the light off, no matter how hard he tries not to, his last thoughts before he drifts off are of green eyes with gold flecks surrounded by laugh lines and freckles.
"Yeah, he's great."
Dean moved his face down, pressing one more soft kiss to Cas' lips, before sitting back onto his knees.
Dean laughed "its asleep."
"That's not what happened." Cas says desperately. He needs to do something now, or Dean will be gone forever.
"Why are you watching me, Dean?" Cas asked, not taking his eyes off the road.
His hands are grabbing onto any part of Cas he can reach, as Cas kisses back up and seals their lips together again. When they part, they're both panting and Dean thinks he's never been so turned on in his life.
Cas looked up, realizing he was still holding Dean's wrists against the wall "oh, yeah sorry."
Cas looks perplexed for a minute before he turns around, and Dean's heart hurts just a little bit. Before he can sink totally into his self deprecating spiral, Cas takes a couple of steps away, sets his things down on the island, and turns back to Dean.
"I don't have to take this." Gordon says angrily, standing up.
Cas nodded. "I understand Dean. But this means we have a way to kill Chuck and, in the end, that means freedom."
Dean's brain stops, all his assumptions screeching to a halt in his mind.
Then it's all spilling out. "Just seen, one seen, the regular one. He came here to pick her up yesterday and I about got knocked on my ass with surprise when I opened the door. Then I invited them to stay for lunch. Then Claire, that's his kid, offered his help on the books for the shop cuz I mentioned having issues with them this month, and apparently he's a number genius or some shit. Then, he did the work last night and brought it back here today and we talked for a while about some deep shit. And
Dean sits on the edge of the couch, arms resting on his thighs, head bowed. "You're right." He makes a motion to the end of the couch and waits for Cas to sit down.
"Dean-" Sam started.
He wants to hug him, and kiss him, god does he want to kiss him, and he wants to make sure Dean knows that this
Dean wakes with a nervous giddy excitement roiling in his stomach that he hasn't felt in a long time.
It's only been a few weeks since their first date, and it's been amazing. They've gone out several times, stayed in and watched a few movies, Dean's even cooked him dinner. They've kissed, a lot, and it's always fantastic, but they've never gone past that. It's not that he doesn't want to. Hell, every time Dean's tongue is in his mouth, body under his hands, he's ready to push him down and have his way, but Dean seems to want to take it slow, and that's really okay with him.
It's perfect for them, close to Dean's work, and close to the school where Cas decided to pursue his masters degree. Three bedrooms and two bathrooms upstairs, a half bathroom and an office space on the first floor. Along with a spacious living room where a wall of windows looks out onto the backyard, and a modern kitchen where Dean, and Cas now, can cook, it's exactly what Cas wanted.
He makes the pizzas and fries and the girls converge on the kitchen and scarf them down with liters of soda like they've been in the desert for 40 years without food or drink.
It really is delicious, and Claire was not wrong, he definitely can't cook like this.
Cas took a few moments before he responded. "Your phone kept beeping. I didn't want it to wake you, so I tried to turn it off." Cas reached over and tossed Dean's cell to him. "Your girlfriend texted. I didnt intend to look, but then I saw my name." He finished angrily.
"You wanna see?" Dean asks, sounding a little nervous now. Cas wishes he didn't, wishes Dean knew there was nothing to be nervous about.
"Cas, wait!" Dean jumped up, moving around the table. Cas took a few more steps, now entering the war room. "Please Cas. Just stop for a minute" he begged.
"Yeah?" He heard from inside.
"Just please wait a second" Dean said, his mind racing.
Cas darted his tongue out, running it along Dean's bottom lip, before shoving it into his mouth. Dean opened his mouth willingly, letting Cas' tongue explore.
Cas knew Sam letting him in to see Dean was a long shot, but he had to try. He had to try something other than sitting around hoping Dean would answer his calls.
Cas shakes his head and rolls his eyes. "I-" he has no idea what to even say, so he huffs a humorless laugh. "Right. Okay, are you done?"
"No. No! I wont let it take you." Dean insisted, grabbing Cas' face and looking into his eyes. "I wont. I cant."
"Awesome. You're welcome back here anytime, Claire." Dean says, looking at her.
It's not long later that Dean's ears pick up what the men are saying, and it's not pleasant. The words are crude and sexual, directed at the woman they've surrounded, and Dean can feel himself start to shake in rage. They're taunting her, explicit scenarios spilling from their mouths.
Cas decides to go visit Gabriel, as he hasnt seen him since the first day they were in town. About five years ago, Gabriel opened a coffee shop slash bakery called Bean There Donut That (nicknamed The Bean by townies, according to Gabriel) downtown, and Cas has yet to see it.
Dean rolls his eyes and shakes his head, but can't help the little smile that graces his face.
After they'd circled the whole room twice, Cas looked at Dean. "Ready for the next part?" He asked.
He hasn't even worked. The beautiful bench is still sitting in his workshop, in the exact place he left it when he'd run out to save his chickens. He has no desire to work, to bring anything back to life when his own life is falling apart at his own hands.
"Okay Sammy. Its fine, I was just messing with you." Dean said seriously. "I'm actually kind of glad."
Dean nodded and took the seat previously occupied by Sam. He sat there watching Sam cook, wanting to asked him so badly if he'd gotten ahold of Cas.
"Cas, 's this okay?" Dean asks, and Cas can feel him holding back, hands tight on Cas' hips trying to control himself.
"We had sex, Cas. You don't have to pretend to still want to go out. I get it, I do."
"Dean" Cas said, trying to get Dean's attention. Dean was pressing kisses, licks, and small bites along Cas' jaw and neck.
The man grins even more, and continues his activity, letting out a groan that makes bile crawl up Dean's throat.
"That is because I am being truthful. You should know, being friends with Dean can be dangerous." Cas picked at the burger still sitting untouched on his plate.
Dean's heart dropped. Hed almost forgotten he'd said that. Almost. "Saying that was one if the stupidest things to ever come out of my mouth. I was hurt, and mad, and I blamed you for moms death. But I should have never said that. I'm sorry Cas."
"Well of course." Dean laughed. "You were worried I'd say no? Why?"
"Me too. Don't stop. Please don't stop." Dean begged.
"Hi!" She said, standing. She took Cas' hand, shaking it. "It is so nice to meet you! I'm Courtney."
"Shit" he whispered to himself, noticing Cas's clothes neatly folded on the end of his bed. He realized Cas was gonna need to change, but had nothing to wear.
"Alright, another round?" Dean asked, standing up.
Once Dean has left, Cas let's himself sink back into his despondency. Why couldn't he have tried
"Damnit Cas, come on!" Dean said, dropping his burger to his plate.
"No!" Cas says vehemently. "No, that's not it, I promise. I had a great time and I'd really like to do it again."
"I'm sure." Dean says, grinning as he makes his way back to the front. "Thanks man." He says to Benny, clapping him on the shoulder, then he's out the door and on his way back to the car before the bus pulls away.
Before he knew what he was doing, he reached his left hand over, resting it on Cas' left leg, which was still tucked underneath him.
Cas nodded and slid off of Dean's lap into his seat.
Cas opens his eyes and sees Dean, Emma, and Claire by the front door. "Hey" he croaks, then clears his throat of sleep.
Cas rolled over so they were face to face, a sleepy smile on his lips. "You're amazing." He said quietly.
'Perfect' he thought, as his mind went black, and he fell into sleep once again.
His thrusts start slow, gentle, grinding into Dean, but he quickly picks up the pace, thrusting harder and faster. Sweat is dripping down his neck, Dean releasing small sounds of pleasure, incoherent words and Cas' name on his lips that send shocks of arousal to Cas' cock.
He's got music playing, bacon's cooked, fried potatoes done, and he's halfway through the pancake batter when the girls stumble into the kitchen laughing.
They talk about their families, both with one brother. Their work, Dean knows what Cas does but he explains it more, how he's actually a chef but backed off a bit when things at the restaurant started picking up and he was needed in the owner capacity more and more. Dean explains his car restoration business, and Cas listens intently even though he admits he doesn't know much about cars. It's nice, simple, and perfect, exactly the kind of evening Dean was hoping to have when he'd come out tonight.
After a minute, he can hear Dean's breathing even out so he let's himself fall into a light sleep.
"You. All of you. I want you in me. Please." Dean gasped out, as Cas bit down and sucked a mark into Dean's hip.
"Are you okay?" Cas asks from right behind him.
In that moment, Dean wanted nothing more than to leap over that table, and kiss Cas until neither of them could breath. Unfortunately, he heard a noise behind him, and turned around, releasing Cas' hand, to see Sam coming into the room.
"Hey, I didnt say anything." Dean responded, laughing into his cup.
"Yeah, I know, thanks." Dean takes a breath, runs a hand down his face, and talks. "Do you remember a while back, it's been a long time now, I told you about Cas? From highschool?"
Dean immediately picked up the shot and downed it, setting the glass back down. As soon as Scott poured the second, Dean swallowed it again. After a couple more of these, he let the half full glass sit in front of him and took a pull from his beer.
Forcing himself off the couch, Cas walks down the hall and stops at Dean's room. After a minute of staring into the darkness, he slowly shuffles in, curls up in Dean's bed, surrounded by Dean's scent, and cries until he finally falls asleep.
too soon, and Dean probably thinks it's too soon. Two, he's scared to know the answers to the questions he'd asked himself at the vet's office. Dean making a comment about children, their children, has stirred up some longing in Cas that he'd thought long buried.
Cas shrugs. "It's all part of the business. You'll always get people like that. This is not the first, and I'm sure it won't be the last time something like this has happened. I just haven't been on the floor for a while so it threw me." He can feel Cas studying him intently, eyes never leaving Dean's face. "It was very nice of you to come apologize, even though it wasn't your fault."
"Now, about that complaint." Naomi says, looking at her desk again, and Dean's confused because he thought that
Cas shifts on the couch and pulls Dean up until they're sitting next to each other, then looks into Dean's eyes. "Why don't you quit?" Cas asks, for probably the tenth time since they've lived together.
Cas knew Anna liked Dean, it was obvious. The way she was always seeking him out, finding a reason to touch him, laughing and flipping her hair whenever he said something funny. Cas' stomach clenched in jealousy, seeing Anna's hand on Dean's arm.
Dean shook his head. "Nothing all. Everything's great." He said.
Dean pulled into the parking lot of the diner, and eased Baby into a spot. He sat there for a moment, just staring at the building.
In that moment, Dean realized something. All Cas ever wanted was for Dean to feel good, for him to be happy, for him to approve of the things Cas did. He gave up everything for Dean, never thinking about the repercussions for himself. He gave up his family to be by Dean's side.
They're laying in Cas' bed, still naked and sated, facing each other. Their faces inches apart, staring into each other's eyes, breathing each other's breaths. Dean's right hand is tracing patterns on Cas' left shoulder, the side of his face, his neck. Cas' left fingers are leaving trails of goosebumps along Dean's hip and stomach, down to his thigh and up his back.
He could still feel Cas breathing underneath his head. 'He didnt leave' he thought.
"No, you don't-" Cas starts, but Dean cuts him off.
Dean nodded, and headed for the door. The two made their way to the kitchen, and, once there, Dean set to work making coffee. Cas sat down at the table, watching Dean with an intense stare.
The backyard is large, trees surrounding it on all sides, with the large building toward the back right that he'd seen the night before, as well as a small shed next to it. It's quiet, peaceful. Dean can see the other chickens running around, pecking at the ground, but Lunch (
The house is big and cozy, and when he'd bought it he'd always thought it was just perfect for him. But now that Dean's spent so much time there, when he's not around it just seems too big and empty. Too quiet, lacking the jovial spirit and laughter Dean brings.
"Then what is it?" Sam asked, concern coloring his face.
Cas is extremely annoyed at the amount of relief that flows through him at knowing she's gay. That this is not someone Dean's dating. Though he shouldn't feel relief, none at all, because it doesn't matter. At least that's what he tells himself.
Cas rolls his eyes, but stands up and stretches before walking over to the group at the door. "I'm sorry. You made dinner? You didn't have to do that."
"Be there in twenty. Hang in there." She hangs up the phone and Cas is left just sitting there staring at it.
"That, too, is a long story. But it seems as if my daughter is not coming back any time soon, so I guess we have time." Cas bites his lip and shifts around to get comfortable.
"Just stop, Dean. I dont want to hear excuses." Cas looked into Dean's face then, and Dean could see his resolve crumbling. "I kissed you, and you kissed someone else. Its clear how you feel. I am not a woman, and I should have known you would react that way. I shouldn't have kissed you. Its who you are, and its fine. I just cant be around you right now." Cas started to turn away.
Cas sinks back down into the couch. He's barely moved in a week. Really, the only times he does is to take care of the chickens, eat once a day, and possibly shower if he's feeling ambitious that day, which he was today so he managed a shower and to eat twice, which is an accomplishment.
Courtney nodded. "Wow. He must be really special."
He realizes that Dean's saying he hasn't been with a man since himself, and the possessiveness swells bigger in his chest knowing that he's the only man who's ever been inside him. "Jesus Dean" is all he can breathe out, before his lips are attached to Dean's again.
After Dean filled the machine up, he turned around and looked back at Cas. "You arent going to wear that while we watch the tube, are you? That's not very comfortable."
Grumbling under his breath about how Sam had already seen them all 20 times, Dean turned back to the TV to watch.
Dean is being distant, and Cas is worried. It's been a week since they've seen each other, and everything seemed fine at the time.
Cas shrugged. "Didnt really want to watch TV anymore, so I came in here. Thought I'd make something hot to drink. There's more if you want some." He said, as he waved towards the coffee maker.
After a while, Sam set a plate of pancakes and bacon in front of Dean, and Dean just stared at it. "Its real bacon Dean. Eat it. You havent eaten in days."
Dean started to move with Cas, pushing down on him, burying his cock deeper inside him.
Dean closed his eyes and focused on his breathing, trying to push the thoughts out of his head.
Dean reached his hand out and grabbed ahold of Cas' arm "please dont do that." He said.
Claire nods, and Dean stands up and scoops her into his arms. She groans again. But wraps one arm around his neck while the other is still clutching her side.
Dean stood there leaning back against the library table, his heart sank into his stomach. Cas was leaving. He'd finally had enough of Dean's bullshit and he was walking away. He could hear Cas' footsteps and knew he was at the bunker stairs.
Dean was halfway through washing the dishes when he felt a hand on his back, and jumped, turning around to Cas just inches from him. "Damnit Cas, wear a damn bell." He said.
Sam sighed. "Yeah. It's a family business."
Cas can't take it anymore. He drops the papers and stands up, quickly walking around the table and pulling Dean to his feet.
Dean snuggled down, burying his head in Cas' chest again.
Cas still doesn't say anything, so Dean reaches into the bag again and pulls out the second travel mug and hands that over to Cas too. "Coffee." Dean says, then stands there awkwardly as Cas continues to stare, just holding a thing in a each hand.
Cas cuts those thoughts off there. The last thing he needs right now is for those kinds of memories to flood his mind before bed. Or at any time at all, really. That's his past. Dean broke his heart, and he can't even think about approaching that again, no matter how long ago it was.
The entire drive to the hospital Cas is worried, distressed, and guilty. He was on a date and didn't even hear his phone and something happened to Claire. How selfish could he possibly be to not even think something could happen to her.
Cas started to move his hips in time with Dean's hand, moving his own hands down Dean's back onto his ass. Cas gripped him, and pulled him against himself, feeling Dean's own hard cock rub against his right leg.
Silence. Deafening silence between them. It's uncomfortable, and Dean wishes he didn't live here so he could run out the door.
Dean looked over to Sam's table, where he saw he was eating a salad. So hed actually made this specifically for him. That was nice. Weird, but nice.
"That seems to be the problem. In the future, you are to apologize for your thoughtlessness and inconveniencing them, and do what you need to do to make it right. That is all, you may go." Naomi says with a wave of her hand.
Dean hasn't seen Cas since they dropped dinner by on Sunday night, and he doesn't like it. He's dropped a few things by their house, just onto the porch, and had Emma let Claire know. He knows Cas has been busy, and just doesn't want to bother him.
Worried that it's too soon, he hasn't brought it up yet, but he wants to. Dean spends so much time at Cas' house as it is, and when he's not there, Cas wants him to be. He only worries he'll scare Dean away by rushing too fast.
After a few moments, Cas slowly turned around, but he refused to look in Dean's face.
Dean nods, but it's more of a placating gesture than anything else. "Sure, alright." Though he's positive that once he walks away, he'll never hear from Cas again. He's just a nice guy, doesn't want to hurt Dean's feelings or whatever. Fuck feelings, and fuck dating. This kind of shit is why he stopped. "Well, enjoy your bus ride." He says, and pushes past Cas to continue on to his car.
Blind dates are usually a disaster, but his dry spell is going on almost a year now and he's desperate enough to get back out there that he's decided to give it a shot.
"Cas please,
Cas nodded. "You're right." He looked at Sam. "Shes not a random woman. Shes the woman Dean made out with the other night at the bar."
Cas ended up back in the livingroom. He wandered in, and sat back on the couch. He figured he may as well turn the TV on until Dean got back. It's what he usually did when he was alone and had no heaven business. Usually when the guys were out on a hunt, or asleep.
Dean pulled out his phone and pulled up his messages again. Shed replied back already, of course.
He sits with the mirror facing him, and Dean can see his reflection in the bus mirror. Fern Guy looks up, straight into Dean's eyes, and Dean can't help but shoot him a charming smile. The man's lip quirks slightly, not quite a returning smile, but pretty close.
"Cas, stop!" Dean shouted, desperate.
Dean's pinky brushed against it first, and Cas, unable to control it, sucked in a quick breath, but gave no other reaction to the movement. He reached forward and turned another page.
He heard Cas take a deep breath. "No Dean, I'm not mad. I wish you would have told me you spoke to her in the first place, we could have avoided fighting about it."
"You're going to have to be more specific Dean" Cas responded.
Dean pulled back a bit, lifting his body off of Cas slightly. Looking straight into Cas' eyes, Dean moved his hand once again to the top of Cas' pants, but he didnt stop there this time. He slowly moved his hand under the elastic waist of his pants and boxers. He could feel Cas' rough hairs as his hand inched closer to its destination.
Once Cas was spent, Dean removed his mouth from around him, wiping his mouth off with the bottom of his own shirt.
"I got my shit together after that. She wanted to keep it, even knowing that I could never be with her that way, and I was on board."
Dean handed over the cash in his hand, and leaned in, loudly whispering "thank you sexy." Dean sat back down in his seat hard, and let off a chuckle.
"What?" Dean asks, because what the hell is happening right now?
"Yes. Is she ready to go?" Cas says, and he's doing a damn fine job of acting like he isn't nervous, but Dean knows better. Cas has the same tells he had way back when. Slight shifting on his feet, finger twitching by his side, eye contact avoidance.
The drive only took a few minutes, and before Cas could process what they were doing, they were in his apartment, and he had Dean pulled into his bedroom and pushed up against the closed door.
They both take a seat and Cas gives his daughter a look across the table, not saying anything.
"I just went to clean up our stuff from the showers. I thought you'd be asleep for a while." Cas replied, stepping fully into the room and closing the door behind him.
"Gabriel is the reason I moved back here, of all places." Cas supplies, and can almost see Dean mentally shake himself out of his scrutinization.
"Language, Claire, jesus. And swallow before you talk, I taught you better than that." Cas says. He hears Dean snicker, and shoots a glare his way, before turning back to Claire. "And I cook."
"Dean... so... good..." Cas got out between kisses.
So, he tells her. He tells her how bad he messed everything up, and that he didn't know how Dean felt, and he wants him back so badly but he doesn't know how to fix it.
Dean's opening his mouth to say something, anything to make this awkwardness pass, when the vet comes out and approaches them. Cas stands up, and Dean follows behind a second later.
Cas kissed around the lines of his boxers, his thighs, hipbones, then lower stomach. He moved down further, kissing Dean's hard length pressing against his boxers.
Dean moved his head to the other side of Cas' neck, giving some attention to that side with small licks and nibbles.
His eyes scan down Dean's body, stopping where he's straining against his jeans.
Cas slowly nodded "yeah, I figured that was why. It's okay Dean, I'm not going. We can just pretend it didnt happen."
Cas doesn't say anything, letting his lips and fingers do the talking. Dean's hard in his boxers, and when Cas' hand grazes him, he moans low in his throat.
a big deal and how much he appreciates it.
Dean straightened up. "I'm sorry Cas. I'm just so... I'm so damn happy." Dean reached out, resting his hand on Cas' waist.
"Fuck." Dean says, looking at his watch, realizing the search and rescue took way longer than he thought. "The bus was supposed to be back ten minutes ago. I'm so fucked." Dean mutters, stalking up to the front and picking up the radio. "413 on my way back to the station, be there in five."
Dean opens his mouth to say something and is interrupted by a very loud clucking by his feet. He looks down and rolls his eyes again. "What?" He snaps fondly at Lunch.
"No Dean. We made a commitment." Cas said, turning away from him and continuing down the hall with a smile on his face.
Dean looked at Sam. He looked happy, that was really good.
Finally, they passed through a doorway, and Cas stopped, turning to look at Dean.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Uh, whatcha doin' there?" Benny asks, eyeing the tv, and Cas.
"Your face changed. What happened?" Cas started to sit up.
Cas nods eagerly, and together they unload it and carry it around the side of the house. They get it set up in the corner of the yard, and, like usual, Lunch is the first one to come up. She's gotten very attached to Dean, and Cas finds it endearing the way she follows him around.
Cas nodded "of course." And he slid out from between Dean's legs.
Dean chuckles out loud this time, and Cas shoots him a grumpy morning glare which just makes him laugh harder.
He hadn't known. He knew John was a drunk, that he was hardly ever around, and that they barely got by, but he had no idea he'd been violent. Dean apparently hid that very well, because he really had no clue.
"Just, ugh, fuck" Dean rubs the bridge of his nose, headache forming at the strain of the day. "Tell me Gabe doesn't know why I left. I really, I just... just tell me that please."
That earned him a big smile, which he leaned down and kissed.
"Its alright Cas, hes just pissed because he doesn't like me to know certain things about his personal affairs. But let's face it Dean, I already knew. Ive known for years, I've just been waiting for you guys to pull your heads out of your asses and do something about it." Sam took a small bite of his pizza.
"Yes, Cas, yes. Baby, please, harder." Dean says, grabbing onto any part of Cas he can reach, so Cas thrusts in harder and faster and Dean's back arches, chest pressing against his.
"Come on man, just one more. I promise." Dean replied, wobbling a little.
"Yeah." Claire breathes out, before looking at her dad. "What're you doing?" She asks, as he reaches for the door handle.
A stab of unwanted jealousy spears through Cas' chest, and he reluctantly climbs out of the truck to follow the girls up the path.
"That doesn't make it okay. I don't want you lying to me." He says, really disappointed in her. He doesn't say no often, so when she feels the need to lie it really gets to him.
Just like last week, people stare at him and the guy just doesn't give a shit. He holds his door in front of him until his stop, gets off, and heads down the street.
"Come on, man. You've only been here an hour." Dean said. Then, quieter, he added "Please don't go yet."
There's banging for another minute, silence, then Dean sliding in through the door and looking around.
It's Friday, which means it's been a week since the fiasco with the chicken and the vet's office and putting his foot in his mouth. He's not seen Cas, and he's barely spoken to him. Dean did send him a few text those first couple of days, asking how Lunch is doing, and how Cas is doing, and he recieved one and two word replies in return. It was disheartening.
"Why?" She asks, and it's such a loaded question.
"I know" he replies.
Once they've caught their breath, Dean is gently kissing him all over his face, his cheeks, eyes, nose, forehead, lips, and Cas smiles contentedly. "God I missed you" Dean whispers, and Cas just snuggles in closer, happy.
Cas couldn't take anymore, so he stood up and quickly made his way to the bar. When the bartender approached him, he asked for four shots of tequila and another beer. He was already feeling pretty buzzed, but it seemed liquor was going to be his only saving grace. He could still hear Dean singing, and just wanted to drown it out.
Dean looks over at him, and he looks guilty. "I'm sorry. We just wanted to drop something off, but we're leaving now." He puts his hand on Emma's shoulder and is steering her around to the door.
Cas' heart is pounding hard against his ribs, and he can feel his hands shaking a little where they're clinging to Dean.
"Yes, exactly!" Charlie's says, punching him lightly in the arm. "Annnnyway, I'm Dean's bestie, but I always have room for more, and I think you and I are gonna be good friends."
"I knew you wouldn't try it if I told you what it was." Cas says, and he's absolutely right because why the hell would he try something that sounds gross. "You really should expand your tastes. Be adventurous. Live a little." Cas says, and now he's full out smiling his crinkly eyed toothy smile and Dean hasn't seen that smile in seventeen damn years and it melts his fucking heart.
They kiss, and when Cas pulls back, they're both smiling. He is content, so happy and in love. He has everything he ever wanted right here.
They're making small talk, looking through their menus, when they're interrupted by a deep voice next to the table.
"See. Dad can totally help you." Claire says. Cas stares at her, and she stares back. "Unless your errands worked out today." She says with a knowing look.
Putting it into park, he takes a look around. It's pretty secluded back here, big open field in the back with a large building, house surrounded by trees on either side. He really could get murdered out here and no one would know, but somehow he doesn't feel worried at all.
"Claire, I dont-" Cas starts, but she's already got the seat up and is climbing out.
Dean looks to Benny, and Benny quirks an eyebrow at him. "What? You never seen a man with a tv before?" Dean asks in a playful tone.
When Cas didn't answer, and just stared at the screen, Dean made his way toward him.
"Yes! Thank you." Claire says, and Cas can see a small bit of happiness in her eyes.
"Unfortunately. That asshole is my brother." Cas says, and watches as surprise covers Dean's face.
He let's go of Dean and wipes his face, because apparently he'd been crying, and turns to the doctor. She tells him that Claire should be ready for surgery, explains the procedure, and that she'll take them both upstairs and get her settled in a room, and he can wait in the waiting room up there when she goes into surgery. He signs some papers, and then a nurse and a tech come in and they get Claire set in a wheelchair, and as they're wheeling her out of the room he thanks Dean and follows them.
"Yes, well..." Cas isn't sure where he's going with that, so he changes the topic from this uncomfortable one to another uncomfortable one, because what other kind of conversation is there to have with Dean than that kind. "I went to Singer's and the Roadhouse today, and they both offered me work. Thank you for doing that."
He's speechless. Surprise and joy overwhelm him, and he's so fucking happy right now he doesn't ever think he'll feel this amazing again.
"Just let me finish. Please." Dean said. When Cas nodded, he continued. "I kissed her. I did it. I kept trying to push down the thoughts of what happened, and I figured if I could have the company of a woman, then it would help me."
"It was nothing." Cas replied.
"Goodnight" Cas replies, feeling sleep pulling him down, warm and comfortable in Dean's arms.
Chickens. The chickens are fine, Cas made sure of it. Yeah, he needs a fence, and had been contemplating calling to see how much it would be to have one installed, but he just hasn't had the energy to do anything about it yet.
Once everything was ready, Dean piled plates with eggs, bacon, and pancakes, and brought them to the table.
"Dean" Cas says, laying a hand on Dean's arm.
"We were just gonna drop it off, but Claire said to come in. She didn't say you were asleep." Dean says, shooting Claire a look.
"Really Cas, it's fine. Let's just eat." Dean responded.
Finally, they're both gloriously naked, and he has Dean's weight on top of him. He missed this so much, he missed Dean. How could he have ever let them get to the point where they almost weren't an 'us' anymore?
"Because I told him the truth. And showed him I was telling the truth." Dean answers, shifting again. Cas notices a small bag slung over Dean's shoulder, but doesn't ask about it.
"Hey, woah, wait. What just happened?" Dean asks, following behind him.
The only person who was a surprise here was Anna, everyone else hung out regularly. That realization made Cas feel even more sick. She was most likely here at Dean's invitation. Cas was stupid to believe Dean hadn't invited a girl, and was resigning himself to a night of heartache and jealous pining. At least there was liquor here.
"I'm sorry, I just have a lot of work to get done today." Cas says, and he does actually sound disappointed, which just confuses Dean more.
"Well, yeah. You want it, it's probably pretty heavy, I'm here, we both think this is going well, so let's get it. Where is it?"
They finished up, and Dean reached past Cas to shut the water off. As Dean leaned over him, Cas pressed a kiss to Dean's shoulder. Dean leaned back, smiled, and grabbed their towels from the hook outside the stall, handing one to Cas.
"Seriously?" Dean asks, then looks at the chicken again. She's slowly waddling closer then plants herself right on his foot again. "Damnit." He says, but he's really not all that upset. Stupid chicken is the reason he's here in the first place.
Dean shakes his head, giving a self deprecating laugh. "You know what? If you didn't want to see me anymore, you should've just said that instead of cutting me out." His voice sounds defeated.
Cas nodded, and they headed inside.
"Its really fine, man." Dean said, looking at him. Dean stared for a few moments, then said "you really like her."
He didnt realize how much time had passed in silence, when Cas suddenly stood up. "I'm going to wash my plate" he said, giving Sam a look that said 'talk to him please'. Then he grabbed his plate and left the room.
"Alright, so" Courtney set her bottle down, and turned more towards Dean. "What exactly are you forgetting tonight?"
Dean opened the container, looking down into a gorgeous double bacon cheeseburger and fries.
Emma turns her pleading eyes on Cas now, and he knows how hard it is to resist so it's no surprise when Cas agrees and the girls are gone in two seconds flat.
"What?" Cas asks, holding tighter.
"So, are you hungry?" Dean asks.
"We help people." Dean said, picking his burger up.
: I need you to come pick up Em and Claire for a "surprise girls day". Nails, hair, whatever the fuck you want, I'm paying.
"I wont let him go again" Dean shouted.
"Thanks" Dean took a sip of his coffee.
Pulling away, Cas turns around and heads further into the workshop with Dean following. He stops at a bench, pulls out a small box and turns back. "You can say no, okay? But, I've been thinking a lot about this. You are amazing with your hands. The work you do, the things you can make out of wood, I've never seen anything like it."
The space between them closed, and Cas felt Dean's lips on his for the first time. They were warm, and soft, and so perfect. Cas slid his hand behind Dean's neck, and gripped Dean's hip with the other, pulling him even closer. The hard stone behind him was pressing into his back, as Dean pushed against him.
Suddenly, Dean withdrew his hand and stood up. "I need a drink. Anybody else? Cas?"
"Thank you Cas" he whispered, then drifted off to sleep.
"I can get my half." Dean says, reaching for his wallet.
"I... That's not..." Cas sighs and lays his hands on the countertop. "I'm sorry." He settles on.
"I'm tired of listening to excuses Dean." Cas turned around, heading for the door.
"Language, dad." Claire smirks.
God he's beautiful, even angry, and Cas can't even blame him for being mad, he has every right to be. Cas fucked up, but Dean is here. He's right here.
With Cas asleep, leaning against him, head on his shoulder, Dean could almost pretend. He doesn't let himself though. It'll hurt even more if he does because as soon as Cas shifts awake, he'll go into his room, and Dean will head to the guest room, and he'll be just as alone as ever.
Dean stood up wordlessly and grabbed his plate. He turned and walked toward the hall.
As Dean shuddered at Cas' mouth exploring him, he could barely get a coherent thought in his head. 'Cas... more... fuck... good... more... ngh...' was all he could think.
Dean coughed a little, then adjusted himself in his seat so he was facing a little more towards Cas, but not a very noticable change.
"Yeah, he is." Dean leaned against the car. "I'm actually glad you're still here."
"Dean" Cas yelled, clinging to his hand. "Just let me go."
Cas shrugs. "You never texted me back today." He looks away. "It's alright, if you're too busy, or you're seeing someone else." He really didn't mean to say that, but his sleep muddled brain isn't working at full capacity yet, and he's tired of wondering. He just needs to know, and be done with it.
"Uh, thank you." He says, almost like a question.
"Look, dad. I've actually made a friend here. Please. I promise we'll be doing school work, and I'll unpack when I get home tomorrow."
"Oh Beloved, I'm so sorry." Cas says, cupping Dean's face in his hand. "You know you did the right thing, and that's what matters."
Cas' eyes snap open and he turns in Dean's arms. He can see the open vulnerability in Dean's face, the love shining in his eyes, and it is so magnificent, so heartwarming.
On Friday, Cas comes to the shop and Dean spends some time showing him his system and what work needs done. Cas sets it up so once hes input all the information, he can access it from his own computer at home so he doesn't need to be in the shop all the time occupying Dean's computer. Which, really Dean wouldn't mind if he did, because having Cas around is always pleasant, but he gets that the man wants to work from his own home.
"Yes" his voice comes out rough, even lower than normal.
Sighing, Cas pulls himself up and heads back out to his workshop, getting lost in his work until long after the sun has sunk beyond the horizon.
Pouring lube onto his fingers, he warms it before moving back down Dean's body. Cas looks up at him, and when Dean gives a small nod he circles his rim before adding pressure. He feels Dean tense, and Cas takes his leaking cock into his mouth, swirling his tongue around the head. Dean groans, hips twitching before he relaxes and Cas can dip his finger in.
They head out to the hospital, and by the time they get there it's 7:15, both their sandwiches are gone and Dean has finished his coffee and is starting to feel at least partially awake. He grabs the bag, and hopes that the hospital will even let them in, and that Cas won't mind the intrusion, because it's still early as fuck. There's no question whether Cas will be there this early or not, because Dean knows he'd never leave her here alone.
He contemplates this as he looks at the bench, picturing he and Dean sitting on it in the garden, watching their chickens frolic in the yard until dusk, then heading up to their bed to make love before falling asleep in each other's arms. He wants that so badly.
They make love, slow and lazy, neither rushing to climax, taking joy in each other. When they finally reach the end, Dean clings to Cas, and Cas clings back, silently letting the other know how much they're loved, needed, adored.
"What the hell?!" Dean says, still trying to figure out what's happening. He can see something floating in the corner of his eye, and glances over to see a feather drifting down, landing on his lap. "The fuck?"
Dean continued to explore Cas, his hips, thighs, legs, making sure not an inch was left untouched.
"He wanted you to go with him" Sam said.
"Courtney, do you think I could have a few moments of your time?" Cas asked, looking at her.
Cas is startled awake, falling off of the couch onto the floor, heart pounding wildly. There's a loud banging coming from the backyard. He looks at the clock, sees it's 6am and wonders what the fuck is happening.
They climbed out of the car and walked inside. Dean looked around, and saw her already sitting in a booth at the back of the diner. She waved, and they walked over to her.
"I know." He says.
Dean could feel Cas shaking. He held onto him and rolled them, so Cas was on his side next to Dean, his softening member pulling out.
When Cas finally pulls up outside the house, he is just very ready to get home and possibly take a nap.
Cas shook his head. "Nothing Dean. Thank you" he picked up the beer Dean set in front of him.
"Cas-"
Before he can respond, another message comes in.
Cas puts his hand over his face for a second, then drops it to his side. "Well, I guess it's oversharing hour, but I suppose you should know." He bites his lip again, and stares out at the chickens. "Stupid things mainly, like eating or sleeping. I just don't think about it. But, the biggest problem has been with past relationships. It's hard for someone else to understand. It's not that I don't care, or that other things aren't important, I just lose track of everything else when I'm 'in the zone' as my brother calls it."
"Yeah, can we dad? Emma says his burgers are the best." Claire says, as the girls come into the room. He hadn't even heard them come downstairs.
"It's really okay. I mean, it wasn't when I thought you were blowing me off, but we're all good." Cas just shifts around and leans on the railing, looking out at the yard and biting his lip like he wants to say something. "What?"
Dean turned and followed Courtney to his room. As soon as they walked in, she went right to his closet and started shuffling hangers around.
"I knew it. I'm so glad." Courtney said.
Cas nods in acquiescence.
"Wow, okay," Charlie says, sitting back as well. After a minute, she turns back to him. "Alright, first of all, you need a shower, cuz no offense but you're not gonna fix anything smelling like that."
It's too soon when Cas looks up, a wide smile spreading across his face. "Hello Dean. I didn't realize how late it was." Cas glances at the clock on the wall then back at Dean with a furrowed brow as he pulls himself up off the floor. "You're not supposed to be home yet. What happened?" He asks, stepping towards Dean. When he gets a good look at Dean in the light, his face scrunches with concern. "Oh my god, Dean what happened?"
Dean looked around. "Where are we going?"
"I honestly dont care, as long as theres some sort of grease." She said.
"Fuck" Cas said, closing his eyes and dropping his head back against the door behind him. He felt the wet warmth of Dean's mouth envelope his shaft.
Cas rutted against Dean over and over, listening to the wonderful noises he was making. He pressed his mouth back to Dean's, swallowing them.
The only thing he's gathered, from the information he was given to do the job, is that Dean's shop does very, very well. Impressively well. Cas didn't realize how much money auto restoration brought it, but it makes sense. The cars are old, irreplaceable, and people want them done right. Clearly, Dean's good with his hands, good at what he does. He always was.
Cas moved his hands around Dean's lower torso, holding onto him.
." Dean keeps saying, begging, and Cas can't take anymore. He's pretty sure Dean is ready, so he pulls his fingers out, eliciting a whine from Dean, slicks himself up with the lube, and shoves a pillow under Dean's hips. He lines himself up, and when Dean nods at him, he slowly, torturously slowly, slides into him until he's fully seated.
"Yeah," Dean says, a smirk pulling at his lips. "Did I interrupt something?" Because Cas really looks like he was in the middle of something good before Dean came in, maybe enjoying his alone time.
"Alright" Cas said, realizing that he wasnt getting anywhere in his own head and really could use some advice from the person who knew Dean the best. "Well, Dean and I fought. He doesn't listen to me, and he blames me for everything, so I decided it was time to leave. When I tried, Dean stopped me."
Cas can hear the conversation in the background, and with every second his heart sinks further.
Cas figured hed better shower before putting them on, so he took them down to the shower room.
"Dean," Charlie just says his name, and the tears keep flowing freely down his face, and Cas gives up on trying to dry them. When all he does is nod, Charlie scoots closer. "You're gonna have to give me a bit more to work with here."
Dean reached across the table and took ahold of Cas' hand. "You dont have to be sorry. None of this is your fault. It's my problem, my hang ups. It's something I'm gonna have to work through. But please, dont give up on me."
"You are absolutely not intruding on anything." Charlie says, linking their arms together and steering him to the swing where she lightly pushes him down onto it before sitting next to him.
Setting the laptop on the coffee table, Dean falls back to lay on the couch, rubbing his palms into his eyes. He has to decide.
Cas shook his head, and couldnt hide his smile, as he walked away.
Slowly, Cas nodded. "Okay." He said. After a moment, he smiled a little. "Thank you."
"Yes, Cas. Yes. So close. Feels so good baby. Fuck
Dean stopped stroking himself, focused on swallowing everything Cas gave him. He heard the most amazing sound hed ever heard come out of Cas' mouth, making his own dick even harder.
Dean's hand slides down Cas' stomach and into the waistband of his pants, and when Dean takes Cas' hard length into his hand, Cas can't hold back his own groan, moving back up to claim Dean's mouth again. Cas pops the button on Dean's jeans, slipping his hand in and taking Dean into his own hand. Dean's hips buck into him, and Cas swallows down more noises.
Cas bobbed his head up and down, swirling his tongue along as he went. Then he pulled almost all the way off, giving a small suck to just the head. Dean thrust his hips up unintentionally, shoving himself back into Cas' mouth fully. He could feel Cas chuckle a little around him, which just added more stimulus.
Cas shifted "maybe we should get you home." He said.
Around noon, Sam, Eileen, and the kids drop by for a couple hours for lunch and to give Emma her presents from them; a board game she wanted, a couple of books that she squeals over, and an entire makeup kit which makes Dean send his bother death glares and he responds with pointing to Eileen and mouthing 'blame her'.
Oh, Dean wants to. He wants to go inside and dry off and spend the rest of the evening with Cas in his arms. "I really shouldn't. As much as I want to, if I go inside, I'm not sure I'd be able to control myself." Dean says with a smirk.
Dean turned the rest of the way around. "I know. I know what it means. I just want to be happy for a few damn minutes Cas."
Cas' mind was spinning. This didn't add up. His thoughts flashed to Dean singing on the stage. "But, your song."
He wonders if this is some sort of guilt fueled need to make things right on Dean's part, but he won't look a gift job in the mouth when it means he can pay the bills and the rent and keep food on the table. His savings have been dwindling fast, and now he doesn't have to stress about it as much.
"I'm sorry, again. I'm not hitting on you, I swear." And that's a relief. "I just always figure we should compliment each other, you know? Make the others feel good. Dean doesn't understand, cuz he's not. Not exactly, anyway. Us gays gotta stick together, right?"
Sam laughed "No Dean, I'm not weirded out. I figured it would happen eventually."
Dean nodded, and they untangled themselves and got up, pulling their clothes on.
Cas feels anxiety filling him, can tell it's getting harder for him to breathe, but he can't calm himself down.
As he stood back up, Cas opened his eyes. Reaching out, Cas took the washcloth from Dean. Adding more soap, he followed Dean's lead and did exactly what he had done for him, pausing at Dean's stomach for a few moments, where, not even an hour earlier, there had been a gaping hole.
He could feel Dean's hands on him, gripping his sides, and he opened his mouth to allow Dean in. At the first touch of his tongue, Cas moaned, and Dean licked in further, their tongues dancing together, exploring, tasting, feeling.
Dean took his cup, and walked over to the table, sitting down across from Cas.
"Jesus, that's good." Dean says once he swallows. Cas looks proud of his success, and that makes Dean even happier. "What is it?"
Getting the clock back up the aisle isn't as hard as some other items he's had to do this with, but it's not that simple either. Luckily, the people on the bus today are nice and make sure their feet and items are out of the way, and he gets it off without any problems. Once he's on the ground he looks up at Dean.
Dean spends the next hour setting it up and then helping Emma rearrange her room, so when they're done the entire floor is basically one giant bed. They have a guest room, but he's sure once they get started no ones going to end up actually sleeping until they pass out from sugar overload.
different. It didn't start in some seedy bar with a shitty pickup line and a blood alcohol level high enough to barely remember the night. It didn't start with a blind date, or a friend of a friend of a friend. It didn't start with beautiful words that turned hateful as time went on.
"Yes, it is. It's amazing. You're amazing." Cas kisses him again, then pulls away to look at it. "Seriously, it's perfect."
"What?" Dean and Cas asked at the same time.
"Well it's probably been a couple hours since the movie ended. So maybe 4 or 5 hours?" Cas said.
It's been seventeen years since he's seen Cas, and barely a day goes by where he doesn't at least cross Dean's mind for a second. Guilt and sadness wash over him as he walks around the island, pulling the cutting board with the onions on it in front of him.
"I'm sorry man, I didn't mean to fall asleep on you. You didn't move that whole time? Dean asked, starting to pull himself up off of Cas.
--'So where is he now?'
Cas looked up at Sam again. "I love him Sam. I have for a long time. I will stay by his side as long as he'll let me. But, I will have this fear until Dean realizes what's happening and, figuratively speaking, all hell breaks loose."
Gordon sets his silverware down, and looks at the manager smiling. "My steak was overcooked twice, the service has been very slow, our waiter has an attitude that I don't appreciate, and he pretended to be the manager so he wouldn't have to go get you. Not to mention that the meat is tasteless, and my potato undercooked."
Cas wrapped his hand around his hard cock, sucking in a sharp breath, and gave himself a couple of test strokes. Hed never done this before, so he didnt know if he was doing it right. It felt good, though he wished it was Dean's hand and not his own.
"Are you sure?" She asked, taking a sip from her beer.
She stares at him for a moment before telling him to take a seat in front of her desk, and once she starts talking Dean can feel his stomach drop.
"But, that's not-" Cas starts, but Dean cuts him off because he just needs this to be over. It's too fucking early for this shit.
"Morning ladies, grab a seat, breakfast will be ready soon." Dean says, pointing at the table with his spatula. Emma gives him a 'why are you so happy' look before sitting at the table, and Dean just turns back to the stove and sings along with the music, unable to wipe the smile off his face.
Courtney slowly walked in, sitting at the table across from Cas.
"Morning Claire, Emma." Cas says all properly, even nodding toward them, before taking a drink of his coffee.
That threw Dean off guard. He didnt know why he was always surprised at Cas' strength.
Dean laid there, trying to watch the movie, but all he kept thinking about was how close Cas was. How warm the bed was, having someone in it. It had been a long time since he'd shared a bed.
Dean looks at Claire, and she's holding her right side, her face is pale and scrunched up in pain, and she has a flush high on her cheeks. Dean puts his hand on her head and she's burning up. "Oh, sweetheart." He says.
"Yeah, but people going on first dates dont usually live together." Dean laughed
"Are the fries okay?" Cas asks.
Slowly, Dean pulled his hand out of Cas' pants, as he looked down into Cas' face. Dean wiped his hand on the side of his pants, and pressed his forehead against Cas', staring into his eyes.
"I know, I just wish-"
. Cas fucked up even worse than he ever thought possible. He needs to fix this.
"Ah, actually I called an Uber" Cas says, holding up his phone.
Dean slid to the side, and Sam just stared at her. "What did you do, Dean?" Sam whispered.
Dean leaned his head back to give Cas more skin to suck, and Cas thrust down few more times, causing "fuck Cas" and other, nonsensical, words to spill out of Dean's mouth.
Instead, he continues to eat his breakfast, they both do, without saying a word. When Dean's is done, he takes his plate to the sink, rinses it, and sets it into the dishwasher. He says "thanks" without looking at Cas, then goes back outside.
Cas takes a minute, then looks at him. "It happens sometimes. I get caught up in my work and, well it's not like I forget exactly, I just don't notice how much time has passed." Cas shifts again nervously. "It's, uh, been a problem in the past."
Cas is looking at him with bewilderment again. "Dean, you don't have to do that. I'm sure I can get it."
"I know Dean. That's why I didnt say them to you. You werent supposed to hear them, I'm sorry." Cas lightly stroked Dean's back.
Not hesitating, Cas slid his hand down and gripped Dean's boxers, the only clothes he had left on after last night, and pulled them off, throwing them aside.
"Dont give me that crap Cas. I've know you a long time, you think I dont know when something's up with you? Spill it." Sam said. "If you're worried I'll run and tell Dean whatever it is, I wont. Whatever is said between us is between us."
After several minutes of the most intense kiss hed ever had, Dean pulled back just a little, resting his forehead on Cas'. He closed his eyes, and said "I need you Cas. Fuck me. Please."
Dean nodded, dropped his bag to the floor and kicked it under his bed. "Fine. But I swear Sammy, if either one of you gets hurt, I'm killing you.
"You and Dean" she starts.
Dean was left in just his boxers, and could feel a bit of nervousness creep in, the want coursing through him overpowering it as soon as he felt it.
"I love you too, Dean." Cas says, before their lips meet again.
"Oh, he's my-" Dean started, but was interrupted by the bunker door opening. "Well, speak of the devil" he finished.
"That song was for you." Dean replied. He raised his hand up, and tentatively laid it on Cas' chest. "I've been trying to find a way to tell you for years, but I was scared. And then you started avoiding me, and I thought I'd lost the chance. And then you agreed to come out tonight, and I knew I had to do something. Didn't you notice the words were different?"
. He grabs ahold of Dean's arm, trying to pull him up. "I'm ready."
"We could change that." Dean said.
"Yes," Cas says, rolling his hips down. He's so close, he wants this. Wants to feel how Dean falls apart beneath him. Dean pulls Cas down against him, over and over as he meets him, Cas' cock straining and pulsing with his impending orgasm. Cas' hands tangled in Dean's hair, gripping tight, holding on.
"Though, maybe this is your second chance and you should tell Cas yourself. He would understand, anybody would."
Cas pushes against him even harder, and Dean can feel Cas' excitement against his own, and he fucking
Dean is incoherent and shaking, nails digging into Cas' biceps, and Cas is so fucking close to losing it when Dean throws his head back in pleasure, come spurting out all over his stomach, yelling Cas' name, and Cas let's go, thrusts in a couple more times and he's coming inside Dean. It's the most intense orgasm of his life.
"Can I sit?" The woman asked.
"Get. The. Fuck. Out." Dean said slowly.
Hed promised Dean he wouldnt say the words until he was ready, so Cas put every ounce of love he felt into that kiss.
Dean is by his side in a second, resting a hand on his arm. "How bad is it?" Dean asks.
Cas kisses down his neck to his chest, sucking a pert nipple into his mouth and gently biting it. Dean's back arches below him, and he feels fingers in his hair, unintelligible words and noises spilling from Dean's lips. He slides across, giving the same treatment to the other nipple, before moving further down.
Dean dug through his drawers again, pulling out a pair of sweatpants, a grey t-shirt, and a pair of boxer briefs.
. Dean huffs, annoyed that the man thinks he can intimidate him like this.
Cas just shrugged.
After not nearly enough time, Dean pulled back and looked into Cas' eyes. "Dont leave." Dean sighed. "Just, don't leave." With that, Dean pulled his hand away and walked towards the hallway.
"Look, if you didn't feel it, that's fine." Dean says, angling his body away so Cas' hand drops. "But you could've at least let me give you a ride home. I mean, jesus, am I that bad that you feel like you have to take the bus to get away from me?"
With all the willpower he had, Cas managed to break the kiss and pull back enough to look into Dean's eyes. "Dean, you said-".
Cas stroked himself up and down several more times, his heart pounding in his ears. Thoughts of Dean's hands and mouth all over his body pushing him closer to the edge of where he wanted to be.
"Dean" he says, before kissing him again. "Come inside with me."
Dean pressed his mouth to Cas' again, interrupting him.
Cas blushed a bit, and looked down. "You're very attractive yourself, Dean." He responded, scanning his eyes back up, raking over Dean's body.
Dean felt himself shiver, but unable to move his body.
After making coffee, he spends the morning scouring websites and emailing people. He finally gets a message back about something he really wants, and tells the man he can be there shortly.
"It isn't what we did Cas. That... That was amazing. I enjoyed every second of it. Its just... Afterward, when you looked at me the way you did, and said the things you said. I just kind of freaked out a little. I promised you I would try not to, and I'm doing my best, but sometimes it creeps in and it scares me."
"Hey, you alright?" He asks her.
Dean moved his thumb around, slowly rubbing a circle into Cas' thigh. It was becoming harder and harder to focus on what he was supposed to be doing, and he could feel his member start to grow just a little hard.
Dean starts pushing down against him, so Cas slowly rolls his hips and Dean bucks up. His thrusts start slow, but build up quickly, punching breathy moans out of both of them.
They stood just staring at each other for a moment, before Sam said "we should get out of here, before the cops come. The cashier is dead behind the counter. You two head on back, I'm gonna erase the surveillance footage then I'll be right behind you." Sam leaned down and picked up the demon knife.
Cas takes a deep breath, then another. He presses his face harder against Dean's chest so his voice is muffled when he speaks. "Do you want any of that? Living together, marriage, kids?" His voice hitches as he says the words.
"Were you aware" Cas says in a quiet voice, leaning over the counter a bit. "That Dean Winchester lives here?"
As he kissed down, he could hear Cas draw in a shuddering breath. "Dean, wait."
Cas slowly moved forward, and took ahold of Dean's hand. Silently, he let him down the hall to his room.
He just wishes he knew why. Why Dean did what he did back then. If he just knew, maybe he could move forward and get past it.
Cas' brain to mouth filter must be broken, because he says "you're just gonna let the whole 'best thing I've put in my mouth' comment slide without a joke? Come on, that's not like you."
He makes breakfast in a daze, mechanically, while his mind whirls around everything. Maybe he can fix this? If only he could talk, say the things he wants to say, let Dean know how he feels.
"You need another one of those?" He heard from behind him.
"Dean" Cas whispered, lightly touching his shoulder.
Dean makes a surprised noise, but then his arms are wrapping around Cas and they're lost in each other for a couple of minutes. When they pull apart, they're both breathless.
Cas shrugged. "Seemed like a good idea."
Dean followed Cas out of the museum, back to the car.
By the time the girls come back over, their ice cream is long gone and they've been contentedly talking about anything they can think of, and Dean has forgotten to be mad at Emma for lying to him.
Dean leaned past Cas and set his mug down. As he pulled back, he looked deep into Cas' eyes.
Cas' breath catches in his throat. It's been three weeks since he's seen Dean, and even though he looks a mess, clothes rumpled, hair laying flat, bags under his eyes, he is still the most beautiful person Cas has ever seen.
Dean pulled back slowly. "As much as I'm enjoying this, I really need to get some sleep."
Dean gave her a look and nod. Most women ordered basically nothing, but he supposed she wasnt trying to impress anyone here.
"You should tell him."
Cas stood watching the coffee slowly stream down into the carafe, as Dean made his way up to him.
Everyone else on the bus is staring at the guy, but he's paying no attention, just going about his business like this is nothing unusual. It's really something.
"Yes, Cas Novak. How many Cas' you know? Jesus, Sammy, just answer the damn question."
Cas closed his eyes, then lightly, hesitantly, he pressed his lips to Dean's.
"So? I didn't ask for that. I didn't even want her here. She overheard me and Charlie talking about tonight at school, and invited herself. I don't even like her."
Cas' heart hurts for him. And for Emma. What kind of mother wouldn't want her own child? "I'm so sorry." It's the only thing he can think to say.
Cas sat there for a minute before standing up. "I need a break" he said to Sam, then turned and walked out of the room.
He feels guilt and sadness over what happened with Lunch, but the vet said she would be okay, and he never received a call so he assumes she's doing well.
Suddenly Courtney came sprinting into the war room from the library doorway. She stopped and looked at them both, then nodded. "Perfect." She said, before turning back around and walking out.
"Dean-" Cas managed to get out, trying to catch his breath. "You dont-"
Dean nodded. "Its jealousy, Cas. But theres nothing to be jealous of. No woman has anything on you."
"Yes. I was comfortable but realized I've been sitting like this for too long and my foot feels funny." Cas said, wiggling his foot.
"I'm not worried about him. I'm worried about you." Cas said, pulling Dean's shirt over his head.
Courtney stared for a moment before saying "well, it sounds like we're all fucked then."
Dean shook his head again. "I was stupid. So stupid. Cas, please believe me. I will never do anything like that again. I... I want..." It was hard for Dean to get the words out. 'Say it' he thought to himself. Letting out a hard breath, he said "I want to kiss you." 'Not what I was supposed to say' he thought in his head.
"Okay" Cas replies, reluctant to walk away yet despite the mess he's made.
It's far too soon, crazy, and terrifying, but it's true. Cas feels it down to his very soul.
After a bit, Cas walked the opposite way of Dean, to join Sam once again.
"Sammy, grab some beers from the kitchen, would ya?" Dean asked, walking over to the drink cart. Cas followed behind him, watching him pour amber liquid into 4 glasses.
Dean is standing at the counter waiting for his bourbon chocolate praline crunch icecream, while Emma gets her usual caramel popcorn, when he hears Emma's name behind them.
When Gabriel finally leaves, its wonderfully blessedly quiet for a little while and Cas dozes in the chair, while Claire nods off. He's just so tired, and can't wait to get Claire home and himself back in his own bed.
Fern Guy sighs. "I was going to see if my brother could come get me so I wouldn't put you out any more than I already have, but he's not answering. I'm sorry." He looks so damn concerned, the rest of Dean's annoyance melts away.
Dean wakes to warmth all along his back, a pleasant weight across his hip, and his phone shrilly ringing from his pants on the floor. He reaches down, extracting the phone, and presses it to his ear.
"Any time." He says, and finds he means that too.
Dean reaches out, grabs ahold of Cas, and pulls him until his entire body is on Dean, taking comfort in the solid weight on top of him. Dean tightens his grip, and buries his face in Cas' hair, breathing him in.
) stays by his side.
He was right, and it doesn't take him that long. Within an hour and a half, he's found two places where the numbers were transposed, he's fixed it, and everything matches.
"Hey, what's up?" Charlie answers.
Dean is grinning at him. "I'm glad you like it. Wanna help me get it to the back?"
Cas climbed back to his knees and lined himself up. Dean stared up into his blue eyes as he pushed forward, entering Dean with excruciating slowness.
Dean smirked around Cas, grabbed ahold of his ass, and plunged him into his mouth again, while stroking himself faster.
Conversation stops for a bit after that while they all eat. When he's almost finished, Claire perks up and looks at him. "Oh, dad. Dean said he's having trouble with some numbers stuff and I told him you're an accountant and you're good at that kind of stuff if he wants some help."
Later that night, as Cas is taking off his jeans to change into pajamas, two things fall out of his pocket. The first is the phone number of the guy from the diner, and Cas smiles to himself as he sets it on his dresser.
Dean looked at Cas, and Cas nodded. "Yes. It's a big place, itll be fine!" Dean said, laughing again. He didnt know why he kept laughing, but man it felt good.
Actually, he wasn't thinking. He was sad and hurt and drunk, and Michael was just there so Cas grasped onto him, onto meaningless sex. That's Cas' fault, but Michael didn't help things, asking Dean to leave.
"Oh yeah?" Courtney plucked a fry off her plate. "That's nice. How?"
"Mister Winchester, we had a complaint today." She says, staring at him with a cold look.
"I assure you, I'm not pulling any part of you" Cas said, looking down at his hands.
"I have a science project coming up and I really need to get together with Emma to plan what we're gonna do. I was hoping to go over tomorrow morning." She says.
Once they're dry and dressed, they head downstairs and decide to order food instead of going out. Cas just wants to curl up on the couch with Dean for the rest of the evening, soak up this new feeling of love that's running through him.
. Say it." Cas growls, tightening his grip on Dean's hips, sure that is has to be painful.
"Like seen, or
Cas' face is pink, from the beer or from the compliments, Dean doesn't know, but it's nice. Cas is staring into his eyes, and Dean is staring back, sucked into the pools of blue. It's entrancing, and the only thing that pulls his eyes away is when Cas' tongue peeks out, licking his lips. Dean's eyes flick down, watching the pink tip moisten Cas' chapped lips, and he wants to lean in and press his own against them. He doesn't, because they're in Cas' business and that would be inappropriate. Instead, he tears his eyes away and looks back into Cas', noting his pupils are slightly dilated.
God they were amazing. He hasn't felt this light since he was a child, and it's a really nice feeling, one he never wants to let go of.
Cas snapped his head up and looked at Dean. "What?"
Cas stopped, but didnt turn around.
This kiss is completely different than their first one. Where that one was slow and gentle and exploring, this one is hot, searing, full of want and need, and Cas loves it. He lets himself be taken, opening his mouth to Dean's tongue.
: And Ellen Harvelle, at the Roadhouse. I hear she just fired her guy for stealing, so stop in there too. I worked there as well, and Ellen's a hardass but she's really great.
"It's nice to officially meet you." Dean says, shaking his hand, and damn it's a nice hand. It's always looked nice, but it feels nice too, warm and big and soft with a few rough calluses.
The nurse leaves him at the door, and he peeks around the curtain. Claire is laying in the bed with Emma on one side and Dean on the other. Dean's arm is around her, and she's curled into his side with her eyes closed, and Emma and Dean are both looking at the tv.
"Fine, you're going to be late for work, and don't whine to me about it because I tried to get you up," Cas says, before turning and heading into the kitchen.
Its smooth, easy, and honestly quite amazing. Once the check comes, Dean pays and Cas insists he'll get it next time, which makes Dean extremely happy that he's talking about a next time, and Dean suggests going for a walk around town.
"Yeah, you've been saying that a lot today." Cas responded, lowering his hand.
"No Sammy. I just want a break." Dean said, swallowing the second glass and setting it down. He shook his head and walked out of the library.
"Heya, Cas."
"Yeah?" Dean looked at him. Cas was making that cute head tilt he always made. "Yeah, Cas. Let's go."
"Nah, not really. I could've opened it sooner, but, you know, single dad and all. Made it difficult."
At that point, Anna pulled Dean's attention away, so Cas went back to silently nursing his beer.
"Good." Cas says. He looks around for a second, then his eyes track back to Dean's. "Um, do you maybe want to grab a drink at the bar? I'm finished here, and I figure you could probably use one after all that. You didn't seem to care for the wine very much."
Cas took a deep breath, sighed, then nodded. "Okay."
He felt the woman's body brush up against him as she sat down.
He sees Cas' fingers, out of the corner of his eye, slide the card off the table. "No, I can text you." He says, as he pockets the card.
When he looks to Claire again, she says "yeah, thanks." And she and Emma take off down the hall and out the front door, leaving Dean to walk Cas out.
The rest of his shift is uneventful, and Dean makes it back to the station on time. The second he's off his bus though, a woman is standing there as if waiting for him. She looks at him a moment, then says shortly "Naomi would like to see you on her office." And she walks away. Okay then.
Cas reached for the door handle, and started to climb out of the car, nodding for Dean to follow him. Dean opened his door and stepped out onto the fresh air. "Howd you find this place?" He asked.
Dean took a deep breath. This was it. He was about to get his heart crushed. "I didnt want you to leave."
"You're fucking amazing" Dean says, and Cas can see the sincerity of his words in Dean's eyes. "You go shower first, then I will."
Dean cuddled down into the pillows, making himself comfortable. He looked over at Cas, who was sitting straight up in the bed with his legs straight out.
As an answer, Cas pressed his lips to Deans.
It's his fault. He should've anticipated something like this, gotten a fence installed or something. He thought he was far enough out from anybody that nothing like this would happen, but he should have. He should've known.
Charlie contemplates for a moment, then gets right to the root of it, in true Charlie fashion. "What did you talk about today?"
"Thanks" he smiled back at her, and walked out into the cool night air.
They heard a knock on the window and jumped apart. "Hey guys, if you wanna, you know, head back home, that's really cool" Courtney said, standing outside the window laughing.
Cas huffs out a laugh, then points to the other chair. "You can sit." So Dean does.
"Emma, we aren't staying. I told you we could bring it and you could see how she is, but they need to rest. No arguments."
"Please," Dean breathes out, hips bucking up as Cas sucks another mark into his skin. "Please Cas, I need you."
So far so good.
The waitress looked at Courtney. "Screw it, I'll have the same. Extra bacon."
The longer Cas sat there, the more uncomfortable he got, with the wetness in his pants. He knew he'd left his clothes in Dean's room, but he didnt want to go in there, especially while Dean was like this.
He waited until Cas said "okay" before turning back around. He took in the sight in front of him. Seeing Cas so casual was something new to him, and he liked it.
"He's your best friend," Sam says quietly, gently, like Dean's forgotten the last few years.
Cas palmed Dean's hard on, moving his lips to Dean's neck, allowing Dean a few desperate breaths.
Cas shakes his head of the thoughts, then kneels down to start work.
He's halfway through his food, doing his best to nod along with whatever Gordon is saying, because he's really not even paying attention at this point, when a new person shows up at their table.
"And" Dean says, turning his gaze to Cas "I think it sounds like a good idea."
Cas realized hed found that wonderful bundle of nerves, and angeled himself so each thrust hit it in just the right spot.
The jeans were a little bit of a struggle to get on, but once they were on he felt he could actually move fine in them. He pulled the sweater over his head, then slid the blazer over it.
"Cas, turn around and look at me" Dean said, pleading in his voice.
Dean put his glass to his lips and finished what was in his glass. "Well, I think we might-"
Dean suddenly felt wobbly on his feet, and started to sway a bit.
Dean turned the light off and climbed into bed. 'I'll talk to him tomorrow' he thought, closing his eyes. His last thought before he drifted off was of the look on Cas' face.
When Emma comes in, she rolls her eyes (thanks for that, Claire) but is smiling when she sits at the table with a stack of waffles in front of her, covered in homemade strawberry syrup and whipped cream.
"It'll be okay." Dean says. "I'll see you soon." He tries to sound truthful, but he has no idea how bad it is. He hangs up, getting into Baby, and driving as quickly as he can.
Finally home with the clock, Cas sets up in his workshop and starts in on it. It's a long process, bringing something back from the dead like this, but Cas loves every minute of it. It's amazing, to watch something transform from broken ruins into something working and beautiful, by his own hands.
"You had a bad dream" Cas said. It wasnt a question.
"Yeah, but theres like a million. And Sam is hell bent on making me watch them all" Dean stated.
Dean pulled himself up off the floor and looked at Cas, who was standing there, panting, and looking completely sexed out. It was probably the most beautiful thing hed ever seen.
Cas tilted his head to the side, looking at Dean. "I thought we were past the personal space issue." Dean could hear the airquotes.
"I'm sorry." Dean hears himself say. He says it again, and again with no idea what exactly he's apologizing for. For being a failure? For not sucking it up and signing the damn paper? For being such a fucking loser that he did nothing with his life? For crying on him? Who the fuck knows, he just knows he's sorry.
"So what happened?" Sam asked.
Dean gasped. "You're making it very hard for me to move before Sam comes back."
Cas doesn't answer, so Dean leaves a voicemail. "Hey Cas, I need you to call me back as soon as you can. I'm taking Claire to the hospital." Claire tries to move again and groans out in pain. "Hey hey, don't move sweetheart, I'll get you." He says to her, before finishing his message. "I think it's her appendix. Just call me back as soon as possible." He hangs up, shoves his phone in his pocket, then turns back to Claire.
Cas fell to his knees next to him "please dont let me be too late." Cas pressed his fingers to Dean's head. It took a few moments, an excruciating few moments, but Cas saw the hole in Dean's stomach start to heal, pushing the knife out and onto the floor.
--'cant sleep thinking about this. Text me asap, I'll probably be awake.'
"You're not going." Claire repeats, looking at him like he's grown a second head.
"No, thanks" Dean replied, starting to get worried. Maybe he'd crossed a line. Maybe Cas doesn't feel the same way he does. Maybe he'd just kissed him back to be nice.
But Dean was fine until the end. Cas couldnt understand what happened to make Dean freak out.
"Whys everybody up so early?" Sam asked.
An hour later he and Emma are sitting at the kitchen table, plates of chicken fettuccine in front of them.
Cas smiled around Dean's cock, pulling back and plunging down again. Dean's mind was reeling 'So fucking good... Cas... How does he... Cas... Fuck... Oh God... Please... Cas... Cas' mouth... Fuck'.
"And I'm sure he'll come around. Just give it time."
"What?" Trying for innocent, but missing by a long shot.
"Oh I more than like the books. I would marry the books if that was legal." She said, putting a book back and pulling out another.
"Who is that girl?" Cas asks after a moment.
"You dont eat? But, you had a burger last night" she said, looking confused.
"She wants to meet you." Dean said. He took a deep breath, holding it until Cas spoke again.
"I, uh-" Dean coughs. Cas looks up at him, and Dean's rubbing the back of his neck, his nervous habit. "I have them with me, if you want to compare them to the invoices." Dean says, motioning to the bag still on the table in front of him. He opens it up, and Cas sees a myriad of colorful cloth nestled in the bottom.
Dean reached down and slowly slid off Cas' boxers, leaving him completely exposed. Dean sat back, just staring down at him for a minute. He could see a blush creep onto Cas' cheeks.
Breaking away to breathe, Dean kisses down Cas' jaw to his neck. "Dean, please. Need you. Want you. Please. Please." Cas is begging, babbling, but he can't stop. Breath coming faster, heart racing, fingers tightening in Dean's shirt. "I love you. Love you so much. Please don't leave me. Please don't stop." His brain is fuzzy, his body on fire, and he wants
Dean reached out and grabbed Cas' arm. "But you havent been taken care of yet" he said.
Cas turned the car off, pulling the keys out and looked at Dean, trying to gauge his reaction.
In the next second, Cas is in his space, pressing their lips together, and it's everything Dean thought it would be, and more.
Dean nodded, and pulled back even more. "I know. Please let me explain myself."
Dean gestures at the two little co-conspirators. "The girls wanted to hang out tonight, and instead of just asking they tricked us into coming here." Dean says. "You can sit if you want." He adds.
Cas decided to just go to his room, and hopefully make it through the next few hours until Dean got up and he could get his clothes.
Dean smiled at him "best night of my life."
"We ended up back in my room." Cas puts his head down, and rubs his forehead with his hand, the beginnings of an emotional headache coming on.
"Don't say you're sorry, I'm the one who attacked you." Dean tries to pull away again but Cas doesn't let go.
After a minute of this, Dean pulled back, smiling at Cas. "Okay, I'll see you tonight then."
That gets Dean's attention, as he sits up quickly looking around for the time. He snatches his phone off the table and groans to himself as he bolts off the couch and into his room to get dressed.
Before Dean knows what's happened, the man straightens up, whips around, and punches him square in the face. Dean reels back, hand going to his cheek where the pain is flaring from, other hand clenched in a fist.
It takes him a few moments of confusion before it registers what he's looking at. They're invoices and delivery schedules... for women's underwear. Cas flips through the pages, noting seven or eight of them, all different, all delivered to their house through the last several years.
By now, Fern Guy is wiggling back out from under the seat, a triumphant look on his face and a chicken in his hands. Dean reaches down wordlessly and takes it, putting it into the cage too, before helping him off the floor.
Saturday morning dawns bright and sunny, and Dean's up with it, drinking coffee and making Emma's traditional birthday chocolate chip waffles and bacon for breakfast, while happily dancing around the kitchen to classic rock.
Unfortunately, the second half is not.
-'It seemed important at the time.'
Dean looked at Cas' face and saw actual worry there. "Hey, I'm good, really. Would I have liked for him not to walk in on us? Yes. But not because I'm ashamed of this. Not at all. It's just not how I really wanted to tell him."
It's maybe an hour and a half later when he hears Emma yelling from the top of the stairs.
, to the one person in the world that Dean hates with a passion, it's too much.
"Come on Dean, let's be adults here, jesus." Sam said.
"There's nothing to explain," Dean says, shaking his head and turning away again.
Dean looks around for a minute, then turns back to Cas. "So, you named the chicken lunch?" He asks, extremely curious.
Dean's arms wind around him pulling them flush together. His body tingles where Dean touches him, and all he wants is more. He licks into Dean's mouth, and he opens up to him, deepening the kiss. A whimper escapes Dean's throat, and Cas just grips him tighter, never wanting to let go.
Everyone behind him mumbles agreeable noises, except one person. He hears a man loudly exclaim the inconvenience and unprofessionalism of this. Dean takes a glance at him in the mirror when he stops at a red light. The guy is older, wearing a suit, balding, and has a disgusted scowl on his face. Dean rolls his eyes to himself, and continues on his way to the hospital. Fuck that guy. If somebody can't understand a woman in fucking labor, that's their problem, not his.
"Yes, please. Thank you." Dean replies, handing his menu over when Cas finishes writing.
They watched him go, and Cas turned around and sat back on the couch. "Well that was... something." He looked at Dean and saw concern on his face. "What? Dont worry about Jack, hes fine."
They've finished eating, and they're waiting on the check. Cas is digging into his jacket pocket on the bench seat next to him, for his wallet and Asa is saying something about not wanting the night to end yet when Cas feels his phone vibrate against his hand. He pulls it out of his jacket and checks it and there are five missed calls and several voicemails from Dean.
He heard Cas' sharp intake of breath. Dean moved his hand up and slipped it behind Cas' head.
Dean leaned in again, but this time Cas didnt pull back. Very slowly, Dean pressed his lips to Cas'. He slid the hand holding onto Cas arm up, and into his hair. Cas was tense, standing there not reacting. Dean pulled on his head, attempting to deepen the kiss. He could feel Cas' resolve failing, as he relaxed a tiny bit.
Dean tightened his grip around Cas' member, running his fist from base to tip and back again as Cas moaned his name.
Cas removed his lips from Dean's neck, panting. "Your brother will be back any minute" he breathed.
"Whatever" was Sam's response, before turning around and walking back into the library.
When he kisses back to Dean's neck again, Dean says "I think I might have a condom in my wallet, but it's been a really long time so I don't know if it's any good."
Dean reaches out and pulls Cas to him, burying his face in the crook of Cas' neck and inhaling, the scent of his boyfriend calming him a little. After a minute, when Dean's regained enough brainpower to function, he loosens his grip on Cas and tells him.
"Dad" she says, and looks at him so seriously. "You were kids."
"Research huh?" Dean asked.
Cas internally sighed again, resolved to just get this over with. "Fine, Dean."
They've got a movie on and Dean is dozing on the couch when Charlie shows up, but she immediately whisks Emma away for "birthday girl stuff" and Dean is totally fine with that and just keeps dozing until he has to get up to start prep on dinner stuff.
Courtney nodded "I'm glad you understand. Now. Who's hungry? Cuz I'm starving." She picked up her menu.
"Dont Cas" Dean said, backing away and shaking his head. "Dont." He turned around, quickly opening the door to his room, and shut it in Cas' face.
Dean looks down into Cas' face, eyes closed and slumped against his side, breathing evenly as the movie they've been watching plays on. Smiling to himself, Dean settles further down into the couch. He knows he should move away, should wake Cas up to go to bed, but he can't bring himself to do it yet.
There are tears on Dean's face, and he swipes at them. "I couldn't let him hurt you. And I couldn't leave Sam there on his own with him. I was the only thing stopping Dad from hurting him too." Tears are falling freely now, and Dean just let's them. "I'm so sorry, Cas. Giving you up, giving up the only person I've ever really loved, was the hardest thing I've ever done. But I had to."
"Fuck, I want you." Cas says, voice deep and growly, echoing Dean's exact thoughts. Dean kisses him again then pulls away and grabs his phone off the counter. "What're you doing? Cas asks, and he's flushed and breathing hard and Dean needs him so much.
"I want nothing more than I want for you to be happy" Cas whispered, then brought his face to Dean's once again, softly pressing their lips together.
"I'll talk to him" Cas said, and followed Dean out of the room.
The girls have spent the entire time, and he means the entire time from the second the truck started, talking. Apparently Emma's birthday is coming up and she's having a sleepover. That's about as much as he got out of it.
: Sounds good. Thanks!
Hope wells in his chest again, but this time he doesn't push it down. He let's it fill him, grasping onto it, relishing in the first thing he's felt in weeks that isn't pain or anger.
Once inside the offices, he's made to wait in the starch white waiting room for a solid fifteen minutes before he's called into Naomi's office.
"What did Claire lie about?" He hears behind him, and turns around to see Cas and Claire standing there.
What felt like hours later, Cas sat up and looked into Dean's eyes. Hed finally calmed himself down.
Dean let his eyes scan the room, taking it all in. It was an antique car exhibit.
"What?" Dean asked. Or tried to, as a bit of food sprayed out of his mouth.
Dean continued the kiss for a few more moments, before pulling away again. "Cas, calm down, its okay" Dean said, grabbing Cas' arms.
"Good?" Cas asks, lip ticking up in a slight smile.
A bright smile graces Cas' face, and Dean's pretty sure it's the most beautiful thing he's ever seen. Cas leans forward, into Dean's space and Dean's heart rate picks up, anticipation rippling through him.
"I repeat. Dean, what did you do?!" Sam asked, wiping the table up.
Dean feels embarrassed, barely remembering what he'd spewed out in his pleasured haze. "Sorry."
"Sorry" Cas says, voice low and rough with sleep. He rubs his eyes and sits up, looking at Dean.
"I need to tell you something." Cas just stared at him. "Okay. So, when I was collecting the bedding, I looked at my phone and read... her messages. She was just asking how things went between us. I texted her back." Dean finished in a rush. 'Please dont be mad' he thought.
Cas moaned, feeling Dean clench around him, and after a few more thrusts, Dean could feel Cas let go, filling him.
They laid there for a few, just staring at each other. Dean began to get uncomfortable from the wetness all over, and in, him. He started to wiggle around. "I need a shower." He said.
Cas deepend the kiss this time, unapologetically shoving his tongue into Dean's mouth. Dean groaned, and slid his hands up Cas' back, trying to get past all the layers. Realizing Cas was still wearing that damn trench coat, and getting any closer was a futile effort, he moved his hands up and slid it off his shoulders, taking the suit jacket with it, until Cas was in just his white button up shirt. Dean was finally able to push his hands up the back of Cas shirt, feeling his skin.
"I thought you'd want to get back to your party, I didn't mean to make it seem like you weren't welcome to stay." Cas says.
He knocks before he opens the door, and when they walk in Cas is staring at him with a confused head tilt, and he just smiles as Emma immediately heads over to Claire and climbs up next to her in the bed.
Cas suppresses the urge to roll his eyes for the hundredth time today, and digs into his own food.
Once again, after Cas leaves and for the rest of the day, Dean feels content, even happy. At dinner, when Emma looks at him strangely because he can't stop smiling, he just smiles bigger and hands her another piece of pie.
Once it was done, he poured 3 mugs, scooping sugar into one. "How do you like your coffee?" He asked Courtney, doing everything but looking at her. It was just too weird.
Cas makes his way back out to the waiting room, and Emma is now laid out where he'd been sitting, with her head in Dean's lap sleeping. Dean's head is bent forward, and he looks like he might be asleep too, so Cas touches him on the shoulder gently and says his name.
A couple of hours, and many many drinks later, Dean was pretty hammered. They'd discussed everything from where they'd travelled, to some of Courtney's most interesting patients. Dean was really enjoying himself, and it seemed like Cas was too.
"Nothing man, I'm good." Dean responded.
"I know I'm a failure. I didn't mean for it to happen, I just-" Cas cuts him off there.
The word 'Dean' sets off more tears, and they roll down Cas' cheeks as he wipes them away just as quickly as they appear.
"Cas, what are you doing over there?" He asked as he cleaned a table across the room.
Dean grunted and turned back to Cas, glass in hand.
"Ah, now that is the million dollar question." Dean says, and Cas just feels more confused. "It's kind of a long story, but I can give you the condensed version." Dean motions to the kitchen table, and they both take a seat before he starts.
"So, I assume from the blow up that you do, in fact, hunt monsters too." Courtney said to Sam.
"Sorry, daddy." Emma says, still looking down.
"How did your talk go?" He asked.
"I know that Dean. I'm trying not to push any feelings onto you, and I'm sorry if I did. Cas said.
Looking down into Cas' face and seeing the exhausted joy behind his eyes, Dean smiled. "You're amazing."
Dean reach over and pat Cas on the back, smiling. "Yes. Alright Sammy, go pick a movie, and I'll make some popcorn" Dean said jumping up out of his chair.
"Ahh, that's nice." She looked awkward, like she had something to say.
Taking solace in Cas' body, he gives himself over. Cas opens him up slowly and thoroughly before pushing in, filling Dean's body and soul. He needs this, needs Cas, and needs Cas to know that.
"Everything okay?" Dean asks, feeling a little off now.
Cas smiled, stilling Dean's hands with his own. "Are you still drunk?" He asked.
He can feel Dean's legs wrap around his waist, and a moment later they tighten and Cas is being flipped over, and Dean is on top of him, and fuck if that isn't the most beautiful sight he's ever seen.
He takes care of Claire, and wonders why. He works, and wonders why. He does household chores, and cooks, and showers, and dresses, and sleeps, and wonders
"Hey, you can have that. Well, not that, that's mine. I mean him. Hes mine. What I mean is..." Dean took a breath. "You can have love."
Realizing Dean isn't going to take the money back, Cas folds the envelope and sticks it in his pocket, and Dean drops his hands. "I have a masters in financial accounting. It's what I've done for a living since college. Trust me, it wasn't that easy for me at first."
He leaves the house and starts driving to work. The closer he gets, the more unhappy he becomes. This isn't an unusual feeling, but it's not really been this strong before.
Cas lowers his head and presses his face against the bulge, rubbing along it, stubble catching on the fabric. He turns his face and mouths at him, the bitter tang of precome bursting on his tongue, and Cas can't hold back his own moan. He licks and sucks along his hard length until the panties are soaked through in the front and his husband is trembling beneath him.
"Emma knows all of this, I've never hidden it from her. She knows I always wanted her, and that's what matters." Dean says, and Cas admires that greatly.
When he turns around, he sees Cas on the porch in paint splattered jeans and a tshirt, barefoot. Definitely not ready to go. Or, more likely, not wanting to go. Fuck, this feels really shitty.
: Sure. Is everything okay?
"If I had, you never would've moved here, or even come to visit. You would've avoided this town like it had the plague and I'd never see you or my niece." And, well, he's not entirely wrong. He's actually entirely right. If Cas had know, he wouldn't be here.
"Ahha! Got em" he said, finally finding them.
"You should sleep" Cas said, stroking Dean's hair.
With that thought, Cas closes his eyes and absolutely does not think about Dean anymore that night.
Cas lowered his head again, and noticed for the first time that the front of his shirt was completely ripped open. "Umm Dean, what happened here?" He asked, with a smile.
"It's not a big deal" Dean shrugs.
He's exhausted. After the emotionally trying lunch, the conversation with Claire, and attempting to get the house in some kind of order the rest of the day, all he wants is to go to bed. But, he said he'd get this done tonight, and it really shouldn't take too long. Claire's upstairs, hopefully unpacking, so he might as well take advantage of the quiet.
Cas gave a small nod, and Dean reached over Cas, grabbing the remote that was sitting next to his phone on the nightstand. He turned the TV on, then scrolled through netflix until he found something that might interest Cas.
Dean looks down at the floor and let's the whole story spill out, from the harassment to getting punched to the warning paper and his unplanned abandonment of his job. Cas listens silently, and when Dean's finished he doesn't say a word for a minute.
"I know Cas. I know. I want to. Please."
Dean just smiled and shook his head. 'I cant believe this is mine.' He thought to himself. 'I cant believe I ever denied myself this'.
As he walked in, he saw Cas pouring 2 cups of coffee into mugs. Quietly, Dean walked over to him and slid his arms around Cas' waist.
Cas discreetly moved his left hand off the table, and set it on his own left thigh. He saw out of the corner of his eye that Dean's interest was piqued.
Dean cut him off. "You better not be about to say you're leaving."
Cas is shaking with the effort to hold himself back, and Dean lifts his head and kisses him, pushing his hips down.
"Just tell me why, then. Why you're insistent on feeling this way every day." Cas asks from right behind him.
"Ah, yes." Cas says, clearing his throat. Dean looks at him from the corner of his eye and can see he's a little red. "Well, I'm an artist. I fix things up, make them better and sell them, and if I can't then I repurpose them into some form of art."
"Alright. Uh, you wanna head back toward the car?"
He somehow makes it to his car, but has to sit there for a while before he's calm enough to drive. The whole way home, his anger is abating, and by the time he gets home he's just filled with dread. What the fuck is he supposed to do now? What's he supposed to tell Cas?
Red flashes in Dean's vision, and before he knows what he's doing he has ahold of the man's arm, ripping him from his seat and shoving him toward the front. He flips the door open, and all but shoves the man down the stairs.
After a minute of adjustment, Cas sits back a little to look into Dean's eyes, and tears spring to his own as he sees so much love looking back at him. Dean nods, and Cas begins to move slowly at first, then faster as Dean clings to him, begging him for more.
Cas nodded. Closing the door, he moved to the other side of Dean's bed and climbed in.
Cas hands him the sander and points to some wood on the workbench, just like the other night, and Dean gets to work, losing himself in the vibration and humming of the machine.
Dean heads to work on the afternoon, dreading it more and more every mile he gets closer to the station. He hates this, hates feeling like everything is forced, like he's pushing himself just to go to work. It's miserable. He wants to be home with Cas, not dealing with asshole people and their asshole complaints.
"Its okay love." Cas whispers, before slowly pulling down the panties enough to expose Dean's hole. Cas takes ahold of both cheeks and parts them, lowering his mouth to lick around his rim. Dean twitches and moans, and Cas licks again, before pushing his tongue past the rim. He works Dean's hole until it's lose and giving, then coats his fingers in lube and presses one in easily.
Dean did this a few more times, until Cas grabbed firmly onto Dean's hair, stopping him.
"What you told Sammy. About how you feel about me. Was that true?" Dean asked.
Cas is still just staring at him puzzled. "Uh, it doesn't bother you?"
Dean takes a breath and let's it out slowly, shaking his head and looking off into the distance as he remembers. "He beat me until I could barely move. Then he made me pack our stuff, shoved us in the car, and we took off. He told me-" Dean's breath stutters at the memory. "He told me if I ever tried to contact you, he'd make sure I couldn't do it again. I didn't know if that was a threat against you or me, but either way it was effective."
Once everything is set up, and the chickens are safely in their new pen around their coop (which they are not happy about, since they're used to free run of the yard), he calls the vet's office to make sure he can come pick Lunch up now, then heads out again, in his car this time.
Cas stopped. He didn't want to come, not here. He unfisted himself, and pulled his hand out of his pants, resting it on the table.
Dean pulled Cas' body flush against his own, kissing him passionately. As he kissed along Cas' face, to his jawline, he whispered "its my turn to make you feel good." He reached down and slowly started to unbutton Cas' shirt.
"Okay. Well, then. Okay." Sam said, not knowing what to say.
: First time?
"I know you guys are" cleared throat "busy, but I really need to talk to you." Sam's voice.
"I can try." She replies, but as soon as she tries to sit up she doubles over in pain.
"Yes Cas. Look at me, you healed me, everything is good."
He misses Dean. Misses his laugh and his jokes and his warmth. Misses talking to him, and cuddling with him. He misses sex with him. This is the longest he's gone without it since they started, and he
Cas nodded, and walked out, unable to hide the smile that was consuming his face.
"That is how it usually works with first dates." Cas said.
"How are you?" Dean asks, and isn't that one of five million questions Dean wants to ask. How has he been all this time, why is he here back in Kansas, who is Claire's other parent, are they still together, does he hate Dean for what happened? 'How are you' seems the easiest.
Dean removed his lips from Cas', eliciting a slight whimper noise from Cas' throat at the loss of contact, before Dean moved along Cas' jawline to his neck. He began to kiss and nibble along Cas' neck, sucking small marks into the most sensitive areas.
He just shrugs. "Yeah yeah, whatever. Only if Cas says it's fine."
He was wiping down the tables in the library when he noticed Cas hadn't moved from one of the tables in the back in a long time. He'd just sat there, with Dean's laptop in front of him, for a good part of the day.
Dean's hand slides behind Cas' head, his fingers carding through his hair. "I love you so much."
Warning: talk of past physical abuse to a young Dean
Sam sprang out of his chair. "What? What happened?" He asked, rushing over to Cas.
As he did this, Dean moved his hands down to Cas waist, pushing his fingers under the elastic.
"Damnit Cas. Just come on" Dean said through the side of his mouth. He had to get out of there before he fell into another laughing fit.
Dean shrugs and finishes, tossing the rag into the corner and laying down next to Cas. "I don't mind." Cas looks completely blissed out, on the verge of sleep, and he is so damn adorable Dean can't stop smiling. He has no idea how he got so lucky to have this wonderful man in his bed, but he's determined not to fuck it up, because Cas is perfect. "You're staying, right?" Dean asks, and he can feel the vulnerability swirling through him.
As he did this, Dean took his right hand and slid it down into his own pants, wrapping it around his pulsing cock, moaning around Cas in his mouth.
"Dean I dont think body parts can slumber" Cas responded.
Cas had regretting answering the call the second he heard that beautiful voice, and he was regretting it more with every passing second.
The morning goes smoothly, and Dean is starting to cheer up a bit, thoughts of Cas bringing a smile to his face whenever he thinks of his amazing boyfriend.
"Oh, yes. I'm sorry, I just got distracted for a moment. Please, continue."
Back at the table, he set the beer in front of Dean. When Dean tried to turn toward him, Anna grabbed his arm, diverting Dean's attention back to her. This was going to be a long fucking night.
Once they're beside the car, Dean turns to Cas and takes his hand. "So, we'll do this again?" He asks, pretty sure of the answer but needing the confirmation.
Emma's at breakfast with them because Claire invited us, but you should've seen his panicked face when she did so I told them I had work to do and sent Emma along. And you should see him. God, he's like Doctor Sexy meets Indiana Jones meets Batman meets Chris Evans all rolled up into the one that got away. Jesus Charlie, what the fuck do I do?"
It's just too perfect. Well, almost. The only thing that would make it actually perfect is if Cas was aware that Dean's in love with him.
Cas points to some garbage stacked by the side of the road not far behind Dean, and Dean makes his way over to it, Cas following quietly behind.
Dean stops walking, heart falling into his stomach. "Where are you?"
"Nothing." Cas says, pushing the feelings down. "I just want to sleep." He continues on to his room, but Dean grabs his hand, turning him back around.
They're at a steakhouse, and Cas has a delicious strip steak and a glass of wine in front of him, the lights are low and romantic, though it's a little loud in there. Asa's talking about books, the conversation has never once been the normal level of awkward for a first date, and Cas can't stop thinking about the look on Dean's face when he'd told him he had a date. He keeps thinking about the words Dean said, how he wanted to start over, how he'd said that Cas had been different.
Cas just sat there, the hard on in his pants pulsing with need. He watched Dean take a sip out of his glass, then turn sideways to look at Cas. As Cas could see, Dean was sporting a pretty heavy bulge himself.
Cas ate them up, shoving his tongue back into Dean's mouth. Dean had both his hands on Cas' hips now, pulling him down against him over and over again.
Emma smiles then. "I figured you would. Anyway, what I was getting at was that we already have a group project coming up, and I was wondering if she can come over tomorrow to work on it?"
"And, where'd you sleep? Because we walked by the guest room on the way down here, and it was empty." Claire says, purposely avoiding looking at her dad.
"You're just focusing so hard. It's really cute." Dean replied.
He climbed out of bed, and started to make his way to the door, when he saw it quietly open. Dean stopped halfway there, and watched Cas sneak back in.
"uuuhhngggh" he heard Cas moan, and felt his hand grab the back of his head lightly. Dean pulled his head back, and sunk it all the way down again, causing Cas to thrust slightly into his mouth.
Dean laughed, and scooted closer, moving the bowl of popcorn to the other side of him.
"I'm glad you came back." Dean said.
"Yes Sam?" Cas asked. Dean glanced at Cas, who was looking at Sam innocently.
Well this is the end, and it's been a journey. I hope you all enjoyed it.
As soon as he opens the door, he hears "Cassie!" Hollered from behind the counter. There's no customers in line, so he stalks up there with a determined look on his face. "Hey, okay, what'd I do this time?" Gabriel asks jokingly.
: On my way
So, needless to say he's a nervous fucking wreck when he opens the door on Saturday to Claire and Cas standing there. He invites them in, and Emma pops up out of nowhere pulling Claire up to her room with Cas yelling after them to call him immediately if something's wrong.
He makes his way down the stairs and is halfway to his car, stupid chicken following, when he hears the door open. "Dean, wait!"
Once there, Dean went to his bed and climbed into it. Cas stood in the doorway watching him.
They rode in silence for a while, Dean watching Cas drive. He was concentrating hard, and the serious look on his face made Dean smile.
Dean climbed behind the wheel of his car, while Cas got into the passenger seat. He didnt say a word as he started the car and drove onto the road.
"I didn't know how you felt until I saw the flower, and I should have told you before, but I've been in love with you since the second I saw you. You were standing in the grass outside the science building and the sun was shining behind you, and you were glowing, and I tripped because I couldn't take my eyes off of you. My bag fell and my books were everywhere and you came over and picked them up and handed them to me, and then you smiled and I'd never seen anything so beautiful in my life and I knew. Dean, I'm so fucking in love with you."
Wait, those weren't the words. Cas knew the words, backwards and forwards.
Dean moves on to tell Sam about his job offer to Cas, and that he'll need a contract for it, and after Sam's surprise and his "are you sure that's a good idea"s, he agrees to do it.
It's just a date, not a big deal. He used to do this all the time, before life circumstances got in the way. Before he, himself, got in the way. Too many failed attempts, too many assholes, too many dates gone wrong and he became bitter and distant to the whole thing.
"I'm here to pick up my daughter." Cas says, and fuck if his voice didn't get deeper and sexier with age.
" and "
Panting, and trying again Cas said "Dean" and put a little pressure to his hands, which were now on Dean's chest.
They've stopped walking, and Cas is looking everywhere but at Dean. "I had a good time." Cas says, and he sounds sincere, but it doesn't make Dean feel any better.
"What's up?" Dean asked.
"No problem. I'm glad someone around here appreciates my cooking" Dean replied, looking pointedly at Sam.
"Hmmm" Dean said, scooting closer to Cas. "Well, I liked what we were doing, that was good."
Several hours later, Dean opened his eyes. It was fairly dark but he knew he wasnt in his room, and he could feel someone breathing beneath him.
Dean nods. "Sounds good." He snuggles back against Cas. "Love you, sweetheart."
Dean, in silence, ate the rest of his two pieces and grabbed two more. He was stuck in his head, the thoughts of what he and Cas had done swirling around.
Cas leaned his head down and placed another kiss on Dean's lips, then he looked down into his eyes. "Me being in a male vessel is a problem for you."
The girls are watching a show, and Cas doesn't realize how much time has passed when Dean's calling them back into the kitchen.
Once Dean steps through the door, Cas closes it and walks past him to the kitchen. He grabs two bottles of water from the fridge, and sets them on the kitchen table, taking his seat back. He slides a water across the table, and motions for Dean to sit.
Cas looked up at Dean, who was looking at him with a look of pure amusement on his face. "No, thank you" he said.
"I'm yours baby. All yours. Only yours. Fuck, Cas. Always." Dean's breathless, body so strong and solid on top of Cas. He's getting close.
Sitting down on the edge of his bed, he put his socks and boots on, lacing them up. He didnt really have 'nice' shoes, but these would be fine. They werent that dirty.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean turned on his side toward Cas, his eyelids growing heavier by the second. He reached out and laid his hand on Cas', before drifting off to sleep.
Dean sat up now, and looked at him. "You know, you dont have to stay here all night doing nothing. I'm sure it gets boring."
Cas forces a smile, forces himself not to pull away until he needs his hand to eat, forces himself to make conversation. Dates should not be forced, and he's feeling worse and worse about it as the night goes on.
Suddenly the bedroom door opened "Dean, foods he.... Oh, wow, sorry. Should've knocked" Sam said, as he looked at each of them in turn. Both on opposite sides of the room. Dean, with a shirt halfway onto his body, and Cas with a ripped shirt in his hands. Sam couldn't help but laugh at the sight.
"It's not a big deal." Dean replies.
"Loading this tv onto your bus, what's it look like?" Dean asks, but he's smiling so big it's pulling at his face in a way he hasn't felt in a while.
Dean moved his left hand up and around to grab ahold of Cas' firm ass, pulling him hard and causing his dick to plunge deep in his mouth once again.
Cas laughs, and it is a damn beautiful sound. "She likes you." He says, watching the chicken with a twinkle in his eye. "You know, she's the one who made you faceplant on the bus?" Cas says, smiling.
Dean pressed down with his hand, rubbing against Cas' hard member, which drew another moan from Cas' throat.
Dean took a drink, then looked at him. "I didn't think you'd come."
"Okay" Cas says, nodding, voice flat.
It doesn't change the fact that he is so fucking done with everything about this job that he could vomit.
It's been silent. Once Dean finished filling out the paperwork, they let the soft noises of the vet flow around them. Dean breaks it with a huff. "It's like we're sitting in the hospital waiting for news on our kid."
Burying himself back into his blankets, he gives himself twenty minutes to mope and feel bad about himself. Twenty minutes to think of all the reasons Dean cancelled on him, all the things he could've done better, all the reasons his past relationships have failed.
It was about an hour later when someone took the small stage in front of them announcing karaoke was about to begin. When Cas whipped his head over to look at Dean, Dean had a grin on his face.
Dean has no idea how he does it, but Fern Guy manages to maneuver it through the door and up the stairs. Dean's baffled, but nods as he flashes his bus pass and heads down the aisle with his door, parking himself in the same spot he did last week.
"Missed you" Dean says against Cas' chest, licking and sucking at Cas' skin. "God Cas, I missed you."
"Ah, well, you see... Dean and I have been best friends for about eleven years now, so I kind of know everything. But please don't get upset. For one, he didn't think he'd ever see you again. And two, it took a rare free night and lots and lots of alcohol for him to tell me anything. He doesn't like to talk about it."
It happens again less than a week later, this time on Monday. Different stop, same man, but this time he's carrying a door. Yes, a fucking door, a door to the front of a house. It's clearly old, the paint peeling, the knob a dull brass.
He gets out the door and into the garage okay, and settles Claire in the backseat but she can't sit up, so he lays her down and covers her with the blanket that Emma hands him. She also hands over one of his hoodies, and he's thankful because it's a chilly night, so he slips it on then slides in behind the wheel while Emma climbs in the passenger side.
"I-" how does he even begin to explain? The words are stuck in his throat, fear and distress gathered there, leaving him speechless.
"Jesus Cas" Dean stands up and pulls Cas up with him before crashing their mouths together. Cas feels so fucking good in his arms, and he pulls him tighter until there's no space left between any part of them.
With contentment coursing through him, Dean gets into the car and drives away, knowing he'll be seeing Cas again soon.
"I know." Cas sighs. "I know the odds are highly improbable that something would happen again. I'm being ridiculous and I know it, I just can't help it."
"Nothing. I just-" Cas started. He stopped talking, and turned to look at the doorway.

Cas crawled up Dean's body, his fingers still deep inside of him, and crushed their mouths back together. He knew Dean was tasting himself on his tongue, and Cas' neglected cock gave a twitch reminding him how unbearably hard he was.
Claire is laying on the bed, pushed against the far wall, and Charlie is sitting next to her.
"I know. Do you need anything?"
A tear slides down Dean's cheek as a blinding smile spreads across his face. "Yes" he says, pulling Cas even closer and pressing their lips together. "I love you too."
Ignoring him, Dean makes his way further into the apartment, intent on getting this over with and not saying a word.
"He's God" Cas answered, so assuredly.
As Cas' finger rubbed around Dean's entrance, he pressed his lips to Dean's.
"Alright, what'll it be?" Dean asked, standing up.
Charlie sits next to him, gives him a minute, then gets right to the point. "Alright, what happened and where's Emma?"
