Of course the only thing that made sense for that was Mycroft. Damn him and his meddling. It was probably the reason John had stayed in then too. And he was probably drinking to make up for Jeanette not being with him.
I tried not to sigh. I’d expect that of course. His answer had seemed unlikely even at the time. Still, hearing the truth made it a bit harder.
“Do you mind?” he called.
John searched his face for a moment, wondering if the man was lying for his sake.
“Wow, they’re really going to go for it then,” Kate commented with a giggle. “You were right.”
He turned to eye the other boy, noting the cockiness in his expression. Perhaps he hadn’t chosen the right methods for Watson after all. He’d though the sister might be a particular weak spot. However, perhaps another pressure point was in order.
He stood a pace back, wanting to open the door, but unsure how to do so when Watson was still leaning against it.
“Was,” she said with a shrug. “Until I realized what kind of idiots are in it. I might still go into something in the public sector. I’ve been thinking it could be interesting to be in the police force. Going to head to college next year and then try my luck applying to an academy.”
“So,” Cindi said, as she leaned back on the couch and batted her eyelashes at him. “We gonna shag or what?”
He hoped she might drop it at that, however, her gaze remained fixed on him.
“Yes mistress,” Kate said, beginning a process she’d grown used to over the last year she’d spent with Irene. She began working to gather the essentials, knowing full well what Irene would expect brought and what could be left.
“I have a healthy sexual appetite,” she said. “Not all of us can be asexual psychopaths, darling, it simply wouldn’t be practical.”
“Think,” Irene said, and then winked.
Sherlock frowned. “That word again. Love from the old English lufian meaning to cherish, to delight in, to approve of. Possibly from liubi meaning joy, or lof in old Friesian meaning praise, or perhaps even the Gothic liefs meaning dear or beloved.”
After a moment he began to realize it was pointless to keep pretending. With a sigh he pulled away from the desk, moving over to where Sherlock was standing. Sherlock’s eyes flickered to his tented pants, as did Irene’s. She smirked. Sherlock’s adam’s apple bobbed again.
Her eyes fluttered a bit, threatening to close without her permission. How long had she been awake now. Fifty hours? Seventy? Any more and she’d likely start hallucinating.
“So you…told her what she wanted to hear?” Sherlock said, eyes narrowing.
"Me neither," John said with a sheepish grin. "But Christ that felt good. I'm just…I'm so relieved."
“Hmm…perfect. Have a lovely evening Irene. I hope to be hearing from you
He did a move that pushed his butt back towards John, and suddenly his head was turned over his shoulder and he was smirking at John before giving one sly wink.
What? Hold on. John blinked a few times, confused. Where had she gotten that? He glanced towards Sherlock who wasn’t giving any indication the statement had bothered him.
Sherlock was looming over me, patting my face, eyes wide as he gazed at me. Though I’d never had his abilities to read people, looking at him I could see all he is feeling in the moment. Panic. Fear. Worry. Relief. Each emotion passed over him and all I could think was that this had to be yet another nightmare.
guidance. I’ll allow you to return back to your fictional cocks and moaning virgins.”
“Ooh, was that from last night?” Kate asked.
After John had touched him. Well, under the effects of a drug it wasn’t improbable that human contact had felt good.
He arrived upstairs to find Sherlock in the kitchen doing some sort of experiment. John sighed and hoped he wouldn’t have a messy cleanup the next morning. Most likely he would though, knowing the detective’s lack of concern for making the place clean.
"Because I know you never liked it," Irene said quietly.
Hand in the hair…nervousness. Unable to make eye contact. Rambling. Adding details. He knew that well enough.
Sherlock nodded and glanced at Watson once more before taking his seat.
Mind palace John smiled.
Unable to restrain a smile, she leaned a bit closer, admiring the lines of the detective’s body on the bed, his slim chest rising and falling with the deeper breaths of sleep.
She especially liked the little tart who acted all horrified that Sherlock had known the body by proportions rather than a facial recognition. She was a pretty thing, Irene thought, as her eyes traveled over the rather unrevealing lab coat. She’d have to do something about little miss Molly Hooper in good time—or rather she’d do Miss Molly Hooper in good time. Convince her Sherlock wasn’t worth pursuing…that he was already taken…or at least make the pretty pathologist question her sexuality a little.
“Oh well,” Lestrade ducked his head. “We could get together on Saturday.”
Mycroft’s lips pursed. “Why am I not surprised? I don’t care for any other explanations. Sit down on the couch.”
There was a sudden beep and John withdrew, pulling his phone out to glance at a text from Sherlock.
Sherlock shrugged and moved his hands up to push the shirt off his shoulders, sending the garment down to rest at his arms, before finally working it off. He did a slow circle over his head with the shirt before throwing it at a nearby girl.
Sherlock put a finger to his lips. "That's not necessary, John. For tonight…start on top. We can negotiate other possibilities in the future. But for now let's keep it simple. Would you do the honor of taking me, John Watson?"
Sherlock opened his mouth to protest.
“Erm, Sherlock,” John interrupted. “Can you please just do it?”
A hand slid up to the buttons of his purple dress shirt, sliding them out of the holes slowly one by one. There were a few whistles, and then Sherlock was sliding his hands over his bare chest. John felt heat flooding his cheeks as he watched.
It got to be New Year's, and John was growing steadily more fed up. As though the months of dealing with Sherlock being insufferable hadn't been enough, now he had to put up with the reality that the death of Irene Adler had devastated Sherlock. That no matter how much he wanted the detective, he'd never be enough. If only his dreams could be real…
Mycroft had been there for a solid twenty minutes already, trying to work details out of Sherlock, trying to understand why the photographs had not been recovered and all that. And while the two snipping at each other was irritating, the true discomforts of the situation were in another area altogether.
Molly just shook her head before making for the doorway. “You spoil everything!” she snapped over her shoulder before she disappeared.
"Is it always that good?" Sherlock managed to say, eyes still closed.
John felt his breath catch. "Then it's all right? We'll just…work through it? I'm sure I'll move on eventually you know. I'll find someone else and we'll get married and it will all be fine."
“You’re not my father,” Sherlock muttered.
What the…
“I’ve always assumed that love is a dangerous disadvantage ... thank you for the proof.”
Her phone rang. Irene paused and looked down at it. Moriarty. She didn’t dare pick up. All it would be was a threat. And at the moment she simply didn’t have time for those.
Mycroft stared at him, eyes boring into him. “In the end, are you really so obvious? Because this was textbook: the promise of love, the pain of loss, the joy of redemption; then give him a puzzle,” he sighed. “And watch him dance?”
“Yes, all right,” John said.
John’s jaw dropped. He sat there a moment, scrambling to try to put the pieces together. Sherlock? He’d called Sherlock? How had that hapepened?
John had been at a loss ever since he had arrived at the party. Greg had latched onto him almost immediately.
, she seemed to purr in his mind.
It shouldn't take much normally. But now was anything but normal. She didn't have her tools. No phone. No backup information. Nothing to bargain with beyond a little sex here and there. And of course, no Kate. How could she be expected to function?
John looked between the two of them, though Sherlock wasn’t looking at Irene.
“I don’t think that’s really your concern. You can go play nursemaid to him for a few hours. He’ll be fine by next morning.” She smiled and reached a hand to brush his cheek. John drew back, flinching away.
John tried to think of something to say to that but couldn't think of a single reply. Nothing was right. She'd only turn his words on their head. Besides, she was right.
and picked the daisies fine;
He felt boneless. His body had completely given up trying to move or making more of an effort to clean. Sherlock sighed and let his eyes flutter shut again. Hopefully in the morning this would all be over. John was right. All he needed was a little bit of sleep.
“I’ll see you again sometime then,” she said with a smile.
“And whose rule is that?” Lestrade asked, staring at a guy wearing a rugby shirt.
Lestrade just stared after her as she continued towards another doorway. He simply allowed Donovan’s words to fade into the back of his mind. Past history was of little consequence to him. He’d find a way to win her, no matter what it took.
“All right, John coming?”
There was a snap of bitterness in his voice as he addressed her. Tried to tell her not to cry. But he left any emotion out of it. Did his best to conceal the worry building beneath the surface. He couldn’t make it apparent to these men that he cared.
By the time he found him, it was clear that Sherlock was already quite tipsy. The boy grabbed for another shots glass, downing it in a swallow before looking back at John, cheeks flushed.
She pointed to another group. “Jocks,” she said before turning to circle the room. “People you can buy drugs off of. Nerds. Those not going anywhere with their lives. Chemistry buffs. Musicians. Honestly, that probably covers it…. Well other than that group. I don’t talk about them.”
What? How did? It was so odd, but I ignored it in favor of allowing him to continue. I vaguely remembered this part from my birthday, but it was hazy.
And you’d think after the actual death it would just gradually get easier. But no, the death is only the beginning of the pain. Then there’s the funeral. And crying all over again, seeing a coffin lowered into the ground and knowing that this really is the end. There’s being around the little reminders each and every day: his chair, his smiley face painted on the wall, his room, his comb in the bathroom, his random rubbish left lying about as though any moment he might just pop up to claim his rightful spot again.
The detective headed off towards the other side of the room, back to the door to examine it for clues. John was getting a sense that Sherlock might prefer some alone time. Lestrade was already following him over. So he decided to stick with Shannon.
"What?"
Sherlock just sighed. “Boring.”
But we’ve wandered many a weary foot,
Sherlock huffed. “I’m done with you and your nonsense. I’ll be back in a few minutes.”
She released him and he disappeared. Lestrade sighed and leveled his gaze back at the remaining contenders. They all looked a little unsettled, but hadn’t moved otherwise.
Jeanette offered Sherlock something to eat, and he lost his concentration when he heard Sherlock use the name Sarah. It set off memories of Cindi again…how he’d called out the wrong name. Blast, no. He wasn’t losing another girlfriend because of Sherlock bloody Holmes. He and Jeanette hadn’t even had sex yet. He wasn’t going to have things end so soon.
Hmm, same pattern of stimulation, same location, same…
“And he took it?” Irene said.
"No. You pretended for my sake. And you supported me…but you hated it," Irene said. "And I always knew, but I always…I ignored it. Because I was afraid."
He broke off. It was too late. Lestrade had looked up from his phone, and he’d apparently caught sight of it. In the light of the windows it was easy to see the dark bruise on Sherlock’s very pale skin. The otherwise unblemished column of neck marked with one solitary and obvious mark.
I was a wreck by the time I returned to Baker Street. Mrs. Hudson started crying the instant I walked through the door, and while I did my best to comfort her, it’s impossible to offer true human compassion in the midst of total grief. The heart is a very selfish little creature sometimes. And in that instant it had barricaded itself up away from the world. Only after I’d seen her back to her kitchen with a cup of tea did I have my moment to myself. I wandered back upstairs, through the living room, past bullet holes and body parts and books and that lonely violin perched on the table. Only when I was safely tucked in my own room, did I allow myself to truly break down.
"I'm sorry if things didn't go right," John finally managed. "Well, with you back I'm heading to bed. Have a good night."
She smiled. “John, you know I’d gladly marry you. I love you dearly…however, I don’t want to be…” she sighed. “I know things have changed now…and I don’t want you to feel…stuck with me…”
“I borrowed Mrs. Hudson’s Hoover.”
“Not at all,” he said, cutting her off before she could add she needed to go over notes before biology lab. She smiled and let him continue, noting that his hands were shaking a little.
“You may date,” Mycroft said before smiling, “when Sherlock does.”
Molly sat up. “Oh no, of course. Have a seat.”
It was his birthday. Sherlock’s I mean. While he was alive he’d never allowed me to make a fuss. In fact, I’d only weaseled out the actual day thanks to some solid manipulation. Otherwise known as bothering him a few times before giving up and asking Mycroft casually during one of our quick chats.
John stared at Sherlock for a moment, but he knew the longer he waited the worse he made this. No, better to get it over with. And with that last thought he slid forward to take to his task.
Maybe, “Skank shows up for second time, Sherlock falls all over himself to impress.” No perhaps, “The Slutty Fugitive”? No, even that didn’t do it justice. He almost growled as he thought again of the woman in the bathroom. He should have refused to allow her to stay. Why hadn’t he?
“Oh,” Sherlock said. He examined John and saw no signs of a supermarket trip. He hadn’t been to his room upstairs, nor had he made any movements in the kitchen. Odd. He was tempted to pry, but at the same time, if John was upset perhaps that was a poor idea.
“I’m going to use the loo before it starts. Save my seat?”
“It worked for a while,” Irene said.
I don’t tend to label POV changes, I feel like people can usually distinguish those themselves, but if that bothers you please let me know. Read and review please!
“I imagine he does,” Irene agreed. “But what’s that got to do with anything?”
“Oh yes, the one who wanted to be put in that atrocious outfit and hogtied and flogged?” Kate asked, smiling at the memory of Irene’s videos.
"Flirted at him," Irene Adler said. "He never replies. And as to you…thought he might open up about his favorite blogger. I was mistaken."
“Back to bed! You’ll be fine in the morning. Just sleep,” John said, sliding the covers over him.
Sherlock was thankfully distracted by Molly making a comment about how bad Mrs. Hudson’s hip was. John took it as an opportunity to go sit by Jeanette, eager to get away from the tension of having to explain exactly what people liked the hat.
“I still think that deduction is absurd,” Sherlock muttered. “He has this secretary or something. I smelled her perfume on him last week.”
"So sorry, Mrs. H," John managed to shout before making the rest of the dash back towards the bedroom.
“What…” Sherlock gasped, only to make out those familiar facial features in the low light of the hall. “John? What’s wrong?”
John looked across the room at Sherlock again, still playing carols. But he’d turned somewhat, not facing John anymore. Still, it gave a better view of those shoulders, arms working the bow gracefully across the strings. The whistle of the teakettle pulled him away from his thoughts.
Mycroft offered a half smile, though both of them were interrupted by a noise.
She had to admit this was going to be an adjustment. Going from her high risk lifestyle and regular kinky sex and running from the law to this…this would take time.
“Forget her,” Donovan said with a shake of her head. “Her family is incredibly uptight, and it’s a widely known fact that the Holmes siblings aren’t allowed to date.”
Sherlock sighed. Better to just leave it there. The longer they stayed together, the more likely it was that Mycroft might deduce what was bothering him.
“Oh. Mrs. Hudson mentioned you looked—upset when you left. Is everything fine?”
“Passcode,” he said firmly.
Sherlock didn’t reply. He was still trying to process. John was angry with him. Why was John angry with him? Other than the obvious of being sexually frustrated, he couldn’t really find a logical reason for John to be feeling such.
“Hello?”
“He’s a freak,” Sally muttered.
Lestrade turned to look just in time to see Molly pulling out a bright red… oh god was that a thong?
“I am sorry. Forgive me.”
. I found my gaze drawn to him, observing creamy skin beneath nearly translucent fabric. I became more aware for the first time of his angular body shape, the smooth sleek curve of muscle.
After a few more moments of gentle affections, Irene finally stopped him.
“Only because you like sex,” Sherlock said with a snort. “At heart you’re as gay as I am.”
He sighed and looked into the parking lot. His eyes strayed over the figure of a girl a year younger than him. Just a quick scan provided him with all the deductions he needed. From her clothing he could know that her parents were getting a divorce. From her hair he could see that she was currently seeing two boys. It wasn’t all that hard to parse out.
She shot him a fierce look. “I need it.”
But before he could become stuck on the semantics, he realized he had to do something about John.
It wasn't until she was off the tube and boarding her train that she finally had a response. Another beep as the sun's rays began to peek in through the windows.
“Of course I’m not,” Irene said with a smile. “So I’ll be expecting a repeat of Rome in the next few days.”
“He’ll never hurt you, my darling,” she whispered. “Never."
Sherlock remained silent. That was for her to guess, not for him to say. She’d seen enough of his private life for one day.
“Expressing my opinion,” Sherlock said, pursing his lips. “I hardly think that should amount to disciplinary action. Or has the school truly fallen into a totalitarian rule? Are we meant to be little mindless puppets repeating back the words of our teachers?”
Shannon came back a few minutes later with two cups of coffee in her hands. She smiled at John and started walking towards the sofa. At the exact same instant, Sherlock spun around, likely to go check on something else, and he collided into her head on. Shannon gave a startled cry, especially as most of the coffee managed to splash across her dressing gown, though some hit Sherlock in the chest too.
Sherlock set his chemistry book aside and stood. He grabbed for the envelope without even pausing, staring at the words at the top.
Her eyes scanned over him, and he smiled as he pulled the last few pieces together. His checkmate was ready.
Sherlock blinked a few times. “There’s nothing wrong with sexual desire, John. I understand some people have notions of homosexuality being morally wrong, but I don’t see a problem in you feeling interested in another man.”
Kate sighed and shrugged. “I suppose it won’t be all that hard. How did you change his phone anyhow?”
He knelt before her and ensured himself that she was relatively unharmed, mostly just shaken. Her sobs wracked him though. She could have been killed. His jaw clenched at the thought.
Also warnings for mentions of non-con....nothing graphic but definitely hints of that idea if that bothers you... might be other things too but I can't think of anything. Let me know if you spot something you think needs a warning!
Her gaze fixed on Kate. Her poor darling. Alone and mourning the death of her lover. If only Irene could have told her the truth. But that put both of them at risk. It was safer this way.
“You have me,” Sherlock whispered back, even as his eyes screwed shut from the pleasure of it all. John’s hand was moving faster even as his hips canted forward with more force. “I’m yours, John. Always…I…I think I might…love you.”
“What?” he demanded, as Sherlock closed the door. “What is it?”
She blinked a few times and then gave a long, quite sensual stretch.
“I won’t lie, I have no idea what I’m doing,” I muttered as he moved to kiss me again.
“You will thank me later,” Donovan said with a wave of her hand. “Trust me, Moriarty is the best person for it. He’s got personal interest and enough money and influence to get this done. And besides, while he’s making the setups with Watson…you’ll have more time to woo your woman.”
“You checked to see if we have any cases?” John asked.
“Oh that’s okay, everyone else was busy with…Christmas.”
He glanced around the flat. There was no sign of a dead body.
“I’ll call you,” John called after her.
He stepped closer, hand catching my face like it had always done in my dream. His fingers that looked so graceful holding a violin now cradled my cheek gently, brushing their calloused tips over my jawbone as he stared at me.
He trailed off as the phone sighed yet again, as if on cue. That was…strange. John shifted again.
“I don’t want to see you again,” Kate said. “Not after having you put in the grave. God how could you do that to me? How…” she broke off, and the choked sound of her voice became hard again. “I don’t care. No. I’m through. You go back to living our little risky game of a life. But you can count me out.”
Sherlock floundered for a moment, thinking of the phone still tucked in his coat pocket. He did indeed have a case. But tonight was special. This wasn’t just an average dinner with John. This was…a date? He wanted it to be a date. And when one was on a date they typically ate. He frowned and looked down at the table before coming up with a suitable answer.
“You’re wrong about her,” Lestrade insisted. “She’s more than a pretty face. There’s something undeniably…warm about her. Friendly. Open. Welcome.”
This was
“I was watching…and I told him all I’d wanted…well because it was a DVD for my birthday to apologize for not being there…and I told him I didn’t want him to be dead. And then suddenly he said he’d be with me again very soon.”
John just shrugged and went back to silently waiting for the cab. He wondered when, if ever, things would feel normal between the two of them again.
Sherlock remained silent.
“And probably brilliant too, I’m sure,” Donovan said with an eye roll. “All right, I’ll give her this…she’s top in the biology. Otherwise, I’m sure she’d rather spend her time buying pink blouses and playing with her cat and all that shit. Please don’t tell me
Of all the days for Irene Adler to invade their lives, why did today have to be the one?
? What was stolen? Or would you like me to guess that too?”
God he needed to stop thinking like that. But it was so hard. Imagining Sherlock naked…that pale sculpted chest and those gorgeous long legs and his—
He sauntered closer watching me with those calculating blue eyes, observing every detail. What comments would he have for me? I wasn’t sure if I should be angry if those did come or relieved. Had I truly missed those obnoxious remarks?
“I’ve known since the day we first talked about it,” Mary said, she gave me a look to indicate I shouldn’t interrupt. “I knew you loved him, John. And I didn’t care. But he’s back, and whether you’ll admit it or not, that does change things. And the last thing I’d ever want was to have you marry me with regrets.”
“Yeah, for the first time ever she’s cleaned up her act. She’s off the booze!” John said, raising his drink.
“Hmm? Fine,” John said, setting the kettle on the stove. “Can I offer you a drink or anything? Mrs. Hudson’s made all kinds of lovely things to eat.”
Sherlock muttered something that sounded disdainful before going over to open up John’s laptop. John did his best to ignore it as he hung up Molly’s coat.
“What?”
“Please tell me this is the last fall you’ll have for a bit.”
“You’re not a big talker, are you?” Watson asked, smirking slightly.
“Then why are you making my decisions for me?” Sherlock snapped. “Why can’t you trust me to figure out what I need for myself for once?”
Donovan raised a hand at him and quickly set back to work.
Kate's eyes lit with fire. "Yes, mistress." She came to sit in Irene's lap, arranging herself over Irene's knees.
John wondered for a moment if he was going to kiss him again. Maybe? Was it possible? But part of him knew Sherlock probably had been telling the truth when he’d said it was just for a case. Married to his work. Yes, that made sense. Kissing John for work. Not for pleasure. Not out of desire for him or anything else.
“Well, I did see to Sissy first. Took her out. Gave her a quick little walk, all that. But when I came back I did the locks, I went and took off my dress, but I left the necklace on. Cooked some food and had that. After I was done I took the necklace off, left the dishes in the sink, and went to bed.”
He had to resist the urge to roll his eyes. All day he’d been trying to stop Molly from chatting at him. He’d been brusque with her. Kept his replies clipped. And yet somehow she still continued to try to make conversation, even with all of the ways he’d attempted to get her to leave off.
“Do you ever reply?” John tried, desperate to get some kind of answer. Why had Sherlock stopped sharing things with him? Why had this started happening? When had Sherlock decided to start being so bloody secretive?
If Sherlock heard he didn't respond. Simply continued to play his music. John wondered for a moment what would happen if he walked over and smashed the bloody violin to pieces. He thought for a moment how wonderful it would be to feel the wood crack beneath his fingers. And then he'd turn to Sherlock and say "You don't need her, I'm all you need" and kiss him on the lips and have his bloody way with him…
“Moriarty can’t have her if the freak isn’t going on dates,” Sally pointed out. “You just have to be patient. Well…patient and…perhaps a little persistent. But your negativity isn’t going to get you anywhere.”
on John, it didn’t take too much extra effort for him to find the strength to give the man several well placed blows. Enough to incapacitate him. Enough for him to wind up in a hospital and
Sherlock, for once, decided to make up for John’s surly mood. He jumped in before John could do something he’d regret.
"I'd tell you myself, but I doubt you'd listen," Irene said with a smirk. "And I'll figure something out without your help. It's you who needs help if anyone."
“Where no-one will look,” he replied.
A/N: I decided to jump a bit because otherwise I feared it really would start dragging. Figured the past chapters gave some idea of what’s been happening between first meeting Irene and the Christmas Eve party.
Moriarty turned to look, half expecting Sherlock. After all, he’d spread the rumor himself of Sherlock’s famed virtue. Even if Moriarty already knew quite well how untrue it was.
“That might work better,” Molly said. “I’m sorry, I know this was last minute.”
“So,” Donovan repeated, “who’s interested in dating Sherlock Holmes?”
A low masculine moan had emanated from his robe. John had spun around in the kitchen to stare at him, eyes wide, mouth dropping.
“Hello John.”
They were still for a long moment, simply catching their breaths, enjoying the body heat associated with lying so close, feeling especially cozy with the snow falling outside the window. Sherlock pondered what it would be like to have this always…John at his side…John curled up with him in bed…John bringing him pleasure and him reciprocating…
He frowned.
“The face is a bit…sort of…bashed up…so it might be difficult.”
John's jaw clenched. "We're not a couple."
He pressed the button, readying himself for the triumph of being able to hand the phone over to Mycroft. The game was over then. No more of this. Irene Adler, finished.
He guessed it in three tries. Really John could be less obvious.
“Go ahead and kiss his neck a little, John,” Irene instructed. “Give him another of those gorgeous love bites.”
There was a brief pause before another moan filled the room. John sighed and threw his hands in the air.
“Oh alright. Well, give your love to Sherlock.”
“I don’t see why we have to read this drivel anyways,” Sherlock muttered. “This whole class is a waste of time. I should be studying for chemistry right now.”
John’s mouth dropped open. “You’re eating? Thought you were on a case.”
and never brought to mind?
“You didn’t need to come in, Molly,” Sherlock said.
“I’ve got it. Obvious really.”
“I’m really sorry,” he said.
He broke off and stared towards the figure that had suddenly appeared in the room. He was expecting Mycroft's tall well-dressed form. But instead it was Irene Adler, much better clothed than the last time he'd seen her but nonetheless still appearing quite sensual and deadly.
“So…you…” His voice cracked slightly. “You in fact…”
“You bitch,” Kate’s voice came through the other line. “You utter bitch.”
John’s shame was reasonable, and Sherlock was at least willing to comply in keeping all of this quiet. For the sake of his troubled heart still trying to determine what had happened just now, why he was walking away from the man he clearly cared for, both physically and emotionally. The man who had just been through girlfriends and would likely have another by the end of the week. He sighed, readied himself to wrap a scarf over the mark, only hoping later to examine it in the mirror, have a little reminder of the one instance he’d held John’s attention…probably the only one he’d ever have.
, he tried to tell himself. His eyes shut, and he tried to imagine it was his last girlfriend he was kissing instead of Sherlock. But even the fantasy was not enough to destroy the reality.
One more look into Sherlock’s eyes, waiting for consent. Then there was a nod, and John knew it was all right. They both needed this. Sherlock to obtain information on Moriarty. Him to finally have his chance with the man he loved. John shut his eyes at the thought before moving in to slot his mouth against Sherlock’s.
John gave something of a grin, even if his eyes appeared a bit glazed even in the moonlight. “My Sherlock.”
“I see you’ve got a new boyfriend Molly, and you’re serious about him.”
“You know that beauty is a social construct,” Sherlock huffed. “Honestly, Irene I thought I’d convinced you on that.”
“What’s your idea?” Moriarty said with a sigh, leaning back. “Come now, be quick about it.”
For some odd reason the thought of the doctor brought further interest to his arousal. He wasn’t quite sure why. Years ago he’d had a partner or two, only brief physical intimacies, but since that time he hadn’t considered anyone else. But John’s hands had been on him only a minute before. Perhaps that was it. Perhaps that was why he suddenly couldn’t stop thinking of John, John reaching down to tug the sheets aside. John touching him. John…kissing him?
Sherlock sighed. “No. I’m clean. For the moment.”
Comments are the best way to inspire me to keep going!
“And John’s moans? I know you didn’t sleep with him, even if Sherlock had a hissy fit in his jealousy.”
"I'd like to try to find some work," Irene said. "Nothing…indiscreet," she said, with a glance in Kate's direction.
“Yes,” Irene said, smirking. “But I don’t understand it.”
“He’s not good with names,” he said, trying his best to pull her away, but Sherlock had apparently decided that he didn’t want to drop the subject.
“If I give you money,” he said in a low voice. “I expect results. Standing there watching him ruin my car doesn’t count as a date.”
“I assumed. Show me,” Sherlock snapped.
“Well that’s a charming new development,” Irene Adler said, narrowing her eyes at the younger girls.
Thankfully, his thoughts were put to a stop as the door suddenly opened and men with guns barged in. Sherlock rose to his feet, but there was nothing they could do. The men demanded he open the safe for them since he knew the combination. John watched in astonishment as they threatened him. But he noticed Irene’s eyes glint as the gun was placed to his head.
He sighed and pulled an envelope from his pocket. “This came for you in the mail by the way.”
Taking a deep breath John ventured back out. None of them were paying attention to him though, as Sherlock appeared to be picking up something on the mantle piece. John caught sight of a red package sitting there. He hadn’t noticed it before, but Sherlock had scooped it up and was making a hasty retreat back to the bedroom.
“We set it up,” she said. “So that Lestrade could get the girl. We’re only using Moriarty for the money.”
…there was only one person I could keep thinking about. There was only one voice that kept taunting me while I worked. I kept thinking of the one person who truly makes me ever feel humbled…has made me feel human…”
Kate smirked and looked from the phone to the screen as the door closed. She began typing out a message, unable to contain a soft laugh at the thought of what was coming.
The answer had to be there. He kept searching for it. Wandering halls in his mind palace. Trying to find it. It had to be here somewhere.
“Yes,” Sherlock said. “John, if you please…your mouth?”
“Why does your phone make that noise?” John asked.
“Well, it would be sooooo unfortunate if something were to…happen to her,” Moriarty purred. “Get working on Sherlock. Wouldn’t want to have her simply disappear.”
“We’re fine,” Sherlock agreed.
“Whatever gives you that idea?” he muttered. “Watching too much trash telly, eh Molly?”
John had just begun to relax. He’d found his usual spot at the bar and was nursing a drink, watching various familiar faces filter into the place. After all the drama at home, he’d grown used to coming here.
The cab pulled up to a curb beside several police cars. John sighed, trying to clear his head as he stepped from the vehicle, grabbing for his wallet to pay the cabbie even as Sherlock immediately stalked off towards the crime scene.
He looked back up towards John, the man’s brow furrowed, eyes locked on Sherlock.
Mary took me home eventually. Sherlock still had a puzzled look on his face as she whispered something to him before we left.
“Aw thank you!” Molly said with a giggle. She turned to look at Mary who was smiling and nodding at her before catching Mycroft, arms folded, brow furrowed.
“Oh Sherlock.” I leaned in and let my lips find his. If he was in any way hesitant he didn’t show it. He allowed me to press a soft kiss there, wrap my arms around his back after a moment’s pause and simply pressed myself closer to him.
“God John!” Sherlock snapped. “You’re intoxicated. You’re not thinking clearly. You’re…”
She was silent for a moment before adding, “Perhaps you’re right. Leave me out on my own. I won’t last six months… but without her maybe there’s nothing to live for. But at least you…I hope you at least won’t make the same mistake. Don’t let him slip away, Sherlock Holmes. Not while you have the chance.”
Well that's a wrap folks! I hope you enjoyed it. I'm sad to see this done, but it's a relief to know I have one project finished. Now I'm off to finish my two WIP's plus work on a few other ideas I have brewing (plus some lovely requests to fill). Hope to see some of you again in the future! Feel free to drop me a line on Tumblr if you want to talk.
Sherlock frowned and tried to protest, only to have John lean down and kiss him again.
But in a moment, he knew the answer. This was Sherlock after all. Nothing would ever be simple or normal with him, and that was what John loved about him if he was honest. His eyes opened and he stepped forward to smile at Sherlock.
“All lives end…all hearts are broken,” Mycroft said calmly. “Caring is not an advantage…Sherlock.”
Kate laughed. “Oh, come, you loved every minute of that. Or are you really going to deny your exhibitionist kink?”
He pulled the trousers out of his way, revealing Sherlock for the first time, aroused and ready for him. His stomach jerked in anticipation as he leaned forward a bit.
“Er so… this…invitation… what did you want me to come here for?”
He glanced towards her, brow furrowing even as the countdown finished. John readied himself for pain…for the bullet to pierce his skull.
“I’ll be next door if you need me,” John said.
to truly be something different.
“He’s going to be at the ballet this weekend,” Lestrade added. “Romeo and Juliet.”
“Please,” he said after a moment.
I woke up in a cold sweat, jerking out of sleep the same way I usually did nightmares. What the—
“Hello, Sherlock,” Mycroft said as he appeared in the doorway.
“I’m not an idiot like the rest of the student population. I know you didn’t sneak off to fight a war. So I suppose it would be more accurate to ask where you were in the country. Because clearly you didn’t leave England.”
“Would you two like some coffee?” she asked.
There is no movement save for Sherlock's eyes. They flick back and forth, probably searching for the lie. John's entire body tenses as he awaits the response. Sherlock said he knew it was all right that night at Angelo's when they'd first met. But was it? It was one thing not to be straight, it was another entirely to be…in love with Sherlock.
And it did. That at least was not a lie. He tried his best to think more on what Molly had said. He hadn’t been given a chance to purchase any kind of gift. But he’d have to think on that some.
John sighed. Lestrade wasn’t going to leave off with the interrogation. It was quite obvious to him now that eventually the truth would have to come out. Perhaps Sherlock would merely lie and say someone else’s name. But would Lestrade believe it? Then again, would he even believe the truth? It was hard to say. Still, the anticipation of seeing if Sherlock would hide the truth or not was killing him.
"You do what you have to," he said with a sigh. "I won't fault you for helping her if it's because of me."
John frowned. “Shut up, Sherlock.” He raised his drink back to his lips for another swallow. Why did he need to be so insufferable? Especially during Christmas. Mrs. Hudson was busy saying it was the one time of year they had to be nice to her, but apparently that didn’t apply to everyone else. Sherlock just had to make Greg realize his wife was still cheating, and ruin John’s hopes that Harry was finally pulling herself together, and make Jeanette feel uncomfortable. And right on cue, Sherlock seemed to realize there was one member of the party who had been left out and his attention fixated on Molly.
She nodded, closing her eyes and pressing the end call button.
Sally had hoped for more from the party to be honest. Seeing the look on Anderson’s face certainly had been a selling point, but as soon as she had a drink and looked around she had to admit she wanted more than this. She’d spent so long now helping Greg try to get the girl that she’d almost given up on her own romantic pursuits. Not that she really had anything going.
Sherlock began to catch his breath. He heard footsteps outside his door. John! Blast. He reached for one of the already dirty sheets and began cleaning himself off before quickly buttoning up his trousers.
Again his fingers were shaking by the time they reached Sherlock’s fly. He was careful as he undid the button and then pulled down the zipper. He only paused when he realized Sherlock wasn’t wearing any underwear.
John smirked. "So what are you going to do about that then? Just going to let her die?"
“I’ll pick you up at 9:30 then?” John said with a smile.
“Come Mr. Holmes. It might even save your life,” Irene said before nodding to John. “Or his. Take your pick.”
“Er…yeah…maybe that’s a bit…difficult. But he’s…well not bad looking for a bloke. I can’t imagine there aren’t guys out there who’d be willing to do him?”
“People like the hat,” John said. He was sincerely glad he’d said the word people instead of the word I. Honestly, he could stare at that picture all day. The hat did look lovely on Sherlock somehow. It suited him. Made those cheekbones look sharper, those eyes look more intense, those lips—
He reached the sitting room in something of a daze. Sinking onto the sofa, he again let his eyes close, doing his best to block out the memory of what had happened. Perhaps he should delete it entirely. What a disaster. An utter disaster.
Again, I managed to wake myself before anything…could happen.
John had to admit, he was mesmerizing. He couldn’t tear his eyes off of Sherlock as the other boy began to move to the music, hips gyrating, body moving in perfect rhythm. He swayed, arms raising above his head before sliding back down over his chest and down to his waist. John swallowed as he followed Sherlock’s movements, admiring his slim lithe figure, suddenly turned so unexpectedly sexual.
“You all right, Sherlock?” John asked as they got into a cab.
I was working on my laptop, deeply involved in typing out my thoughts about the latest case. I hardly noticed as he sauntered in, glancing over my shoulder before going to sit in his own chair. He stared at me for a long moment, eyes fixed. Feeling his gaze, I looked up. Those eyes, riveted to me, taking in every detail. While normally I might have rolled my eyes and told him to stop trying to make deductions about me for the day, this time all that happened was a bit of heat rising to my cheeks. It was the excuse he needed.
There were too many inconsistencies.
Sherlock apologizing? John’s eyebrows furrowed as he concentrated on his friend, trying to determine exactly what Sherlock was up to.
“Very good, John,” he said. “Excellent plan, with intelligent precautious.”
Her fingers trailed down to push her dress hem up, moving to toy with herself effortlessly. If only Kate was with her. It would be even more pleasant. Attentions from her lover always seemed so much more satisfying than those from herself. It had been a while since she’d really had to rely on her own means to achieve release.
Irene smiled, eyes lighting at the thought. She knew how to get what she wanted. Sherlock Holmes would come when she called.
Irene closed her eyes in bliss as she allowed yet another wave of pleasure to sweep over her. There were reasons she’d kept Kate around. She tended to forget them sometimes.
“Ohhhh,” Kate said with a laugh. “Yes I had forgotten her. So you had her record him when he came for sex? Very clever, mistress. So, what’s next? Some pictures of love bites can’t be all you’re planning.”
“Hmm…oh just an accident. I wasn’t paying much attention to her. Too many more interesting clues.”
“It is your heart,” Sherlock said. “And you were a fool to expose it.”
Lestrade blinked a few times and then nodded. “Oh. Well even better. I mean guys are more willing to put up with fellow guys being dicks. And your brother’s attractive and…I mean there’s probably guys who’d find all that hostility really kinky.”
Irene let out a sigh of her own.
“Oh Irene, so glad I caught you. Thought you might be sleeping by now.” His voice came in a singsong.
Irene smirked again, but beneath her confidence he could catch something else. Sorrow perhaps. She was a tricky thing, Ms. Adler. He’d riddled her over a hundred times now, but that still hadn’t changed the fact that he still felt there was so much more of her behind all the boldness. He tried to picture her younger. A little girl perhaps. Wasn’t that the sort of thing John would do? What had made her the way she was?
“No.” Kate’s voice is a snarl. “I was right all those years ago. I knew… I knew someone like you could never truly love someone like me. And all my friends…they all said you were dangerous. They said to steer clear of you. God, they were right….”
“Whatever do you mean?” Sherlock said, setting his violin down in favor of listening to what John had to say.
Lestrade was forced to stop talking when he felt the point of the drill suddenly on his textbook. He watched in surprise as the other boy kept drilling, staring into his eyes the entire time.
“Do you ever wonder if there’s something wrong with us?” Sherlock asked. Anything to make his brother not suspect what he was thinking. He couldn’t let his brother know he’d actually come to care. No. Mycroft would berate him to no end. Sentiment was a defect. He knew that better than anyone.
John had to agree with that, but he decided it was better not to say anything. If Sherlock heard them after all he'd probably pitch a fit. Or just decide to ignore them even worse than he already was.
“I’ll do whatever it takes to keep Sherlock alive,” John said, looking up at his friend. Sherlock was staring at him, though his expression was indiscernible.
“Hmm, well a little tip on the Holmes boys, the Ice Man’s pressure point is his brother. His brother’s is—”
He’d asked a friend of his to set him up. Next thing he knew he had Cindi, some accountant who always wore polka dots. Sherlock had seen fit to comment on that right away. Or he’d mumbled some comment neither had caught, but nonetheless managed to seem like some kind of an insult…and probably was knowing Sherlock.
“Yes well, you barely knew her,” Mycroft said, confirming his suspicion it was about Irene Adler. Foolish Mycroft, always assuming he was the smart one.
"No," Irene said. "I…I know I could at least find the means of bringing sex clients back into my life. But I don't think I want that anymore. Or even if I do, I'd rather learn not to want it…learn to only want you."
“No,” John said. “No you didn’t. You’re Sherlock Holmes, you don’t make mistakes.”
. God, people just want to make it straight or gay always don't they?" He let out a humorless laugh. "I'm interested in both I guess. Have been for a while. Hate people assuming one way or the other. I'm interested in men and women and that's that. I always have been."
A/N: I just wanted to take this as a chance to tell people to embrace whatever sexual tendency you might have. I know I spent a lot of time in this chapter with Sherlock questioning what he is, wondering if he’s asexual or bisexual or gay or whatever, but I figured it was a good chance to give this message about loving yourself no matter what you are, not sitting around wishing you could be normal (because normal is so dreadfully boring sometimes ;) ) Anyhow, yes preaching segment done.
Finally, Lestrade had answered and Sherlock was unable to hold back a smile as he examined his prey.
“We’re here to give you that information you wanted,” Donovan said, taking a seat on the stool next to his. “So, here’s Sherlock’s schedule. Molly got a look at it while he was distracted. Reading list. Music he likes. He also enjoys Italian food when he eats. Otherwise his passions are anatomy, and chemistry… and dance as you probably already knew.”
John sighed. “Fine. Fine.”
“Perhaps,” Sherlock muttered, though he knew already that it was unlikely. After all, there would be more important things to do than find a romantic relationship.
“Yes.” There was a pause. “Is there anything else you’d like me to do? I really do want to help. Anything to make him happy.”
Watson raised a single brow. “Just washing my hands before I go to my seat. Not everything is about you Holmes.”
“When we first met, you told me that disguise is always a self-portrait. How true of you: the combination to your safe – your measurements; but this ...this is far more intimate.”
“You’re holding out on me,” Lestrade said. “That’s a love bite. Seriously, you’re seeing someone?”
I'm unfortunately going to be working like twelve hour shifts next week during our county fair, so I'm unlikely to be updating for a bit. I will do my best to get some good updates up as soon as all that nonsense is over.
“The Glee episodes?” Moriarty said, raising a brow. “Of course. Marvelous that. Very fun. Nice singing.”
“Other than all the cigarettes,” Molly said, wrinkling her nose. “I wish you wouldn’t.”
"Any plans for New Year tonight?" she asked, batting her eyelashes at him.
Watson smirked and nodded as Moriarty pulled out his wallet. Honestly, simple folk. So easy to work. A little money and they were butter in his hands. Moriarty sighed as he forked over the cash, watching as Watson strutted off. Well, perhaps this time it really would work. If not, it might be time for plan B.
at the moment, Sherlock. Go make someone else miserable tonight. I don’t have time for you.”
for auld lang syne.
Molly’s eyes had softened some. She reached out and put a hand on Sherlock’s. “She’s an idiot. An utter and complete fool if she thinks you’re somehow not good enough. You’re lovely, Sherlock. So smart. So talented. You can be a bit…silly sometimes. But we all are. Nobody’s perfect. I bet if you told her how you really felt she might come round.”
He nodded and pulled away without another word, still picturing Molly in Jim Moriarty’s car. His jaw clenched and he did his best to focus on the road instead of images of what the older boy would probably try to do to his sister given the chance.
"You do realize I maintain surveillance on both of you whenever I can? It's not always easy with how clever Sherlock is, but I have my ways. Now, why don't you go break the news to Sherlock gently and then make it up to him with whatever carnal pleasures he desires."
“I can admire a man’s strength in saying no to the system,” Sherlock muttered. “And… admittedly he might have a few nice qualities. However, that doesn’t mean I’m going to accept his ridiculous proposal. For the moment I need to focus on finishing school, working on my dancing.”
Kate snorted. "You're a dominatrix at heart, it's what you do. What else could there be?"
John felt his heart sinking. So it was too good to be true.
I sighed and slapped hand to my forehead. “Sherlock, would you shut up? It’s not about being gay or straight or this being right or wrong. This is about me realizing after that day you disappeared from my life that you were the only person I’d ever want. This is about me realizing I’m…I’m…” My voice choked with sudden emotion but I forced it out anyways. “Realizing I’m in love with you.”
"There's no usual in this case," John muttered.
“Oh of course, that’s a little too simple isn’t it? How about if you kiss I’ll give you a hint.”
John elbowed him before giving her his full attention.
“Some, yes,” she said. “Why I’m half inclined to take your brother, Mycroft. I think that might be a very fitting punishment for you with your carelessness.”
John tried to resist rolling his eyes. Wasn’t that obvious? She was a sex worker. A dominatrix. Honestly, he needed to make Sherlock watch more films. Maybe then the man would understand the whole role of femme fatale.
He was silent another long while. His eyes had wandered over to the windows and he was looking out, considering perhaps. I was only awaiting his polite decline. Or perhaps not so polite…there was no telling with him.
“Deny that you love him of course,” Adler rose to her feet and sashayed over to John, causing him to have to try desperately to maintain eye contact.
not know?" John muttered, glancing back towards Sherlock's lightly swaying form.
“No!” John protested. “Want yah…mmm…so sexy.”
“And trust me, I don’t say any of this lightly, because exploring the inner working of Sherlock’s mind… that’s… messy. But I’ll do anything to get the freedom to date.”
“Surely you can put up with it for one night,” Donovan said, raising a brow and folding her arms. “After all, won’t the pay out be worth it?”
John groaned and sank further back into the sofa. The golden retriever moved a bit closer, sniffing at him curiously. He patted its head to distract himself a bit, hoping it didn’t come down to Sherlock just blatantly telling the truth. The man sometimes didn’t think about those types of things.
I looked up at him, found him staring at me as I well remembered. But it felt like there was more heat in that gaze than I recalled before.
She looked up to see Kate in the doorway, arms crossed.
And also lay her last few plans for the brilliant Mr. Holmes.
“And you sat at the table and ate them. And you took the necklace off before taking your plate to the kitchen sink. That means you didn’t wash your hands in between the two acts, yes?”
I was originally going to have the phone passcode be Johnlocked but I figured that was too much. And no, I didn't add any attempts on the phone. He didn't try the one in Molly's lab that he does in the show.
Instead she sighed and shook her head.
And then he was hitting the final button. There it was. He turned to show her, watching her face as she saw the letters he’d chosen.
He entered the principal’s office with distaste. Vicky Perky, the vice principal, was sitting at her computer typing away. Sherlock had figured out from the moment he met her that she had a voracious sexual appetite, one she satisfied by writing erotic fiction (obvious enough from the romance books she kept in her desk drawers and the bruising on her wrists that was from her “extracurricular” activities).
Well, long story short, I ended up with her number, and soon we were seeing each other on a semi-regular basis. It was such a nice change of pace. Growing closer and closer to Mary. Moving in together. There was someone in my life to care for and love and talk to and be myself with. For once, I was beginning to feel better. In fact, I found Mary better to talk to about my Sherlock feelings more than the therapist—though I obviously left the more…embarrassing details out.
, John thought.
“Are you sure?” he asked. “You look quite flushed…and you’re breathing rather erratically as well.”
Kate tried to speak, but Irene interrupted before she could.
keep my secret,” Irene said, again looking at John, eyes glittering meaningfully.
This time he opened. Soft and easy, pulling Sherlock into the motions of a deeper and more intimate kiss. One of Sherlock’s hands reached out to caress his face. Their tongues touched, lingered, tasted. His heart was pounding, unable to settle even as he kept the kiss tender. John felt as if he was dreaming again. Like he had on Christmas Eve thinking of him, and Sherlock in bed…God why couldn’t this be real?
“I wrote an essay on hatred in close proximity based entirely on his friends,” Sherlock muttered. “Though…on reflection it probably wasn’t a very good choice of gift…” He sighed and turned to peer at the camera. “What was my excuse again?”
Once he was at the flat, he paid the cabbie. His strides were brisk as he went for the door, opening it up and heading in. His heart was still racing, but he was hanging on to his control by a thread.
But what he was truly unprepared for, was to return from grabbing something to clean Sherlock’s wounds, and find Irene Adler completely naked, waiting for them in her sitting room as though nudity was the new black.
They continued on into the cafeteria. Lestrade noted it was bigger than his last school and was only glad when Sally didn’t immediately abandon him but instead continued to point out the various social circles.
He couldn’t recall the exact exchange of words after that. It was a bit lost really, since he’d mostly been watching John’s mouth as it formed those delightful complimenting words.
Mycroft sighed. “Do you know anything about a party this weekend?”
“Nice and hot if you’d like,” Mrs. Hudson said, interrupting his thoughts.
“A fruitless search I assure you,” Sherlock muttered.
“Yeah, that’d be great,” John said with a smile. “Just black for me. Sherlock you want any?”
Molly frowned. “Oh. So…something else then?”
“So what, I’m supposed to buy him some noodles and classical music and sit around listening to him prattle about science?” John muttered.
After a few minutes he sat up and took the coat and scarf off, tossing them carelessly onto the floor. And then his shoes, kicking them off equally violently.
"You leave him alone," John snapped. "You're no good for him."
“I’m fine,” Sherlock said, trying to pull away.
“Molly Hooper? Molly-the-girl-who-knew-you-were-alive Molly?”
She stood and reached out a hand. For a moment Moriarty considered biting it. He pictured breaking that soft looking skin and watching blood run down. Tempting indeed.
“Er…sounds good.”
“Oh I like them a little more pliant when I do them,” the boy said eyes glittering. “Let’s me do exactly what I want.”
"Then how come
He was just about to turn and go find a cab when a woman spoke.
And then, someone was calling my name, and I heard movement not far off. I tried to cry out, but my air felt short, smoke already being pulled into my lungs. I felt my vision fading just as someone grabbed my arms and dragged me away from the fire, pulling me back out into the cool November air. I found myself on my back in the grass, staring up at the night sky. And then at him.
“Good girl,” Irene said, moving in to place a quick kiss to her lips. “As a reward I’ll leave you this so you don’t get too bored.”
“I’ll walk your dog for you. Hey, I’ve said it now. I’ll even walk your dog ...” John said desperately. He needed something. If he didn’t have Sherlock he wanted someone else in his life. Couldn’t Jeanette understand? Sure, he might not love her as much, but she was what he could have.
"I dare say Mrs. Hudson won't be forgetting that sight anytime soon," he said with a smirk.
“Then why do it at all?”
It didn’t take long to arrive at Mycroft’s residence. Sherlock sighed as he stepped out, though Irene soon was at his side again, practically clinging to his side. He wondered for a moment if she might be frightened of Mycroft. But of course, the idea was absurd. There was no possibility of that, especially as he watched her straighten when Mycroft glanced in their direction. She smirked, wrapping one arm around Sherlock’s and leaning closer.
Sherlock settled back in his seat as the swell of the orchestra grew and the lights dimmed, but he was not amused by the intent look that Watson was giving the stage. There was no way that boy was here for the ballet. This had to be about the silly attempts at courtship that Watson  had pulled off over the last few days.
do anything for you. Just tell me what it is I’m not doing.
"Still stuck at one-thousand eight hundred and ninety-five," Sherlock said.
“Hello,” she said with a small smile. “If you don’t mind making this quick…er some friends of mine—”
The detective tried to pull himself out of his fantasies, but it was difficult. He grabbed the phone John was offering, and quickly snapped a picture of the reddened mark. It hadn’t really bruised yet, but he suspected it would within an hour.
John was on the third girlfriend. Fifth partner if you wanted to count the dalliances he had with men. And Sherlock continued to pine and brood. In fact, many of his actions had only driven John further away if anything. They were working fewer cases together. Perhaps she’d been wrong in some of her methods, but really the two required a hands on method she simply didn’t have the time for.
Mary leaned in so her head was resting on my shoulder. I squeezed her tighter. I'd been so lucky in finding Mary. Part of me wanted to tell her this wasn’t necessary, that I loved her more than I did Sherlock Holmes. And yet another part of me was all too aware that wasn’t the case. I would spend the rest of my life wondering if there ever could have been more. And Mary didn’t deserve that. Maybe I didn’t love her as much as Sherlock, but I did care for her enough to not let her have an unhappy marriage with me pining for someone else.
“Oh, no, no worries,” John said. “You…forgot to do laundry didn’t you?”
“Having fun are we?” she asked, setting her things aside before coming to sit on the bed beside her lover. She reached for the handcuffs and undid them, taking the phone as well to scan the few texts.
Just as she was moving onto the tube her phone beeped. She frowned and pulled out the burner she still had. The message flashing on the screen was almost enough to make her drop the mobile.
“Well, John, why not see if Ms. Adler can read her clients right. Besides, I…trust you,” Sherlock said, standing up brushing his hands nervously over the top of the chair. His gaze went back to Irene. “Here fine or shall we go to the bedroom?”
“Doesn’t it? You’re frustrated. You’re annoyed Shannon isn’t behaving as you want in the bedroom. And therefore you’re taking it out on me. Why don’t you go let off some of that steam with a few of those lovely pornographic videos on your computer?” Sherlock said, looking up to stare at John pointedly.
“Some wine perhaps?” he suggested. “Something to share. What are you having?”
“How the bloody hell did she get ahold of that sound?” he asked.
“Right, Ms. Leach…So, what can we help you with?” he asked with a smile.
“No, I…I was…”
“No no, no, no good lies only have half detail,” Sherlock said.
“Sleep well, John. I’ll be here in case you need anything. I’ll stay with you until you wake.”
"Tell me and I'll text him. I'm sure you don't want to deal with the messiness of telling him yourself," Irene said.
Anderson spluttered a bit angrily and John walked past him with a cocky grin. He didn’t know much about the party, but he was pretty sure Anderson had no intention of making it open to the whole school. It wasn’t really his style. This was someone else’s handiwork.
The thought seemed to open a door in his memory palace, one he tried to normally keep firmly shut. Memories of his adolescence swarmed him. Thoughts of confusion when he had his first wet dream, many years later than most boys probably would. The elation of realizing he wasn’t a total freak, while at the same time wondering what this would mean for his future. Would he become a slave to his desires like so many men (and probably some women) were? Would he be able to find someone who would be interested in having sex with him? Would he find someone who
Molly stared at him for a second before letting out a squeal of delight and running to grab him up in a tight hug.
“Fuck off,” Sherlock muttered.
“A code, obviously. I had one of the best cryptographers in the country take a look at it – though he was mostly upside down, as I recall. Couldn’t figure it out.”
He stood at the counter, eyeing Sherlock in the mirror.
"Yes," John said. "I lied. I…I didn't want to ruin things. I've never wanted to ruin things."
Her eyes kept steady on his, even as her mask seemed to slip away.
“Hmm…I like it,” Kate said. She worked the comb deeper into Irene’s scalp, causing her to let out a soft moan. “I really never thought you’d go for me. What with all your brainy is the new sexy and all. I was so shocked the day you finally made a verbal proposition.”
He tilted his head, blonde hair catching the light in a way that had Sherlock swallowing. What was it about this boy that undid him so? Sherlock took another step forward, willing his heart to slow down.
“I don’t need a hint to know they are in this room,” Sherlock said.
“Aha.”
John grinned. He was always such a smart arse that Sherlock Holmes. Not that he minded, at least right now. It was somehow endearing in the moment.
However, just then Sherlock’s head shot up from where he’d been examining the table again.
“Mmm…oh the one with those delicious looking fishnets?” Kate asked.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Get ready for me, darling,” she whispered as she pulled back.
. Hmm. No. And Sherlock would probably see through a lie.
“Seriously, I sent him that video of you when you were all drugged up and thought he’d laugh his ass off, but he seemed to get really angry about it,” Lestrade said as he walked to the door.
“Um… you mind if I…?” he motioned to the blanket.
“You do realize I have no control of when she texts,” Sherlock said. “It could be in front of Mrs. Hudson. It could be in front of Lestrade on a case. It could be with a client.”
He’d spent as much time as he could away from the house. So that weekend he was making the rounds in his car. He and Irene had agreed to meet up later, but for now he’d start with the bookstore and then see what else there was to do.
Sherlock's eyes glittered. "No."
The boy had pulled something out of his pocket. “What’s his weight would you say? I’d hate to overdo it.”
“Want this video to go public, Watson?”
Adler’s eyes fixed on him. “Oh, no denials then? Well well, I knew I had it right. And why must I put something on. What’s the matter? Feeling exposed?”
“And you believe I will offer it to you?” Sherlock said, eyes narrowed.
Thank you to feisty_one for commenting!
"It's just…" Sherlock broke off.
Her brow was furrowed as she stared at him. He watched her swallow once. Signs of her coming fall. And she knew it. It was over now.
“Yes, thanks,” Molly said.
But seas between us broad have roared
It took him only a few seconds to locate the bottle of lube and condoms he kept on hand. With the items he needed safely in hand, he started back down the stairs, only to run into Mrs. Hudson on the landing.
“Oh never fear my pretty virgin,” Irene purred. “I’ll have this one take good care of you. Follow my instructions through for fifteen minutes, and I’ll give you your information.”
He swallowed. “But…I miscalculated. There was nothing right about saying it in the moment with a dead body sitting to the side. My timing was completely off. Besides, I’ve read that you’re not supposed to say that for at least six months.”
Veronica just smiled and led him deeper into the bowels of the building. John followed after her, trying not to stare at her arse. It had nothing on Sherlock's but still. The moment he arrived back home he was going to find one of his old favorite videos, wank, and then see if he couldn't set up another date on that dating website.
“I’m afraid there were…complications,” Sherlock said. “Don’t you have something in the oven?”
“You aren’t my heart, Mr. Holmes. Any more than I am yours. We’d be quite ill-suited for one another.”
“Er…well she seemed to be,” Greg said.
“Of course you don’t,” Irene said with a sigh. “He is adorable though, isn’t he Sherlock? You like that sweet cluelessness don’t you?”
When he returned to Baker street he could tell the moment he walked into the flat that something was wrong.
Lestrade frowned. “All right, but what about her and Holmes?”
Sherlock’s body rocked slightly, and his hands went down to pull at the hem of his shirt, sliding it out of his trousers. As he continued to dance, he moved to play with the buttons at his cuffs, sliding them slowly out, leaving them open.
very close, but no,” Sherlock said rising.
Donovan rolled her eyes. “Honestly, you’re wasting your time.”
“Oh you shut up you bloody wanker,” John said. “That has nothing to do with this.”
He dove back in for another kiss and then a few softer ones on Sherlock's neck, settling on an earlobe to give it a satisfying nip.
He could hear her smirk in her tone. “Haven’t I? As I said, the information on your little plot serves me little good though. It’s already out. Already destroyed. But I have other files you’d be interested in too…alongside those pictures of your client you’d rather not have exposed.”
“He’ll confront what’s there eventually. But this isn’t checkers, Kate. This is chess. This involves set up and planning and watching the other players’ moves very carefully. And after those are determined—we strike.”
Warning: lots of drinking in this chapter and mentions of drug use.
As he remembered from before, Sherlock's kisses were addicting. Soft at first and then more passionate. Starting with a little lip and some teeth, before throwing in the addition of his tongue. John pressed a bit closer as it deepened, enjoying the way his body moved to rest against Sherlock's.
“But you’ll need a hint to know any more than that,” Irene said with a smirk. “Come, just a little kiss.”
“No.” He shook his head. “I’m making a new rule. You may date, Molly.”
The swell of music began again. The same tune that seemed to speak of heartache and love lost. John tensed.
Sherlock didn’t respond.
John rubbed his face as he listened to the umpteenth piece in a minor key. How much longer could this go on? He still wasn't even sure
He couldn’t resist. Sherlock gave into the building pressure, allowed the desire within to build and at last crescendo. As the final moments came, he just barely dared to call out the name most on his mind.
Mrs. Hudson appeared in the doorway. Sherlock was at least grateful that she hadn’t walked in on him. Small mercies, he supposed.
“You know, my friends are so wrong about you,” Jeanette said. “You’re a great boyfriend.”
Regardless, even if he hadn’t wanted to celebrate, the actual day was still an awful reminder. Part of me was tempted to remain in the flat and wallow in my grief. But I decided drowning my sorrow in drink might be a slightly more effective option. So, heading down to a local pub, I set about trying to get pissed.
John Hamish Watson. Him she’d known very little about, other than the fact that his blog was part of what had inspired some of the mass following of Sherlock. She’d looked over the little website herself. Nothing spectacular. But nonetheless intriguing.
After Shannon John had actually gone on a few dates with Andrew, who he’d met through a dating site. He was a decent fellow, but he wasn’t what John was looking for. They’d mutually agreed to not see each other again after a third date.
“He supposedly faked paperwork and went to join the army,” Donovan hissed. “Even though he wasn’t eighteen. Was gone for a full year. Came back with a limp and a scar and everything.”
“I will see to it soon. The Americans really have upset some of my plans, but I’m working on it.”
Of course, thanks to her excellent camera planting, she did get to see every expression on Sherlock’s face as he saw her body for the first time. It was as she’d expected, clinical. Neutral. But what else would a gay man do when looking at a woman’s dead body? Any other reaction would have been problematic.
“D’you know what he calls you?” Irene asked, a sneer in her tone. “The ice man.” She paused and he could feel her eyes on his back. “And the virgin.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes and ignored her. She’d learn in time. She was young and untried. But given a few years she’d know as well as Sherlock did that love only destroyed.
Watson shrugged and went back to work. Lestrade just looked nervously between Donovan and him.
John sighed and grabbed his phone, walking out the door into the hallway to make the call. He caught sight of Kate stretched out to the side and paused to check. She was still alive, only unconscious. Satisfied with that he turned back to making the call.
Were it not for the distraction of Irene’s sudden appearance, Sherlock might have scoffed at the apology. But for once, he didn’t know what to say to his brother.
Irene just rolled her eyes. “Well, perhaps once you’re off at your dance academy you’ll finely find someone.”
He sighed and rolled over on the couch, wondering if he should attempt sleeping, or if work might prove a more substantial distraction.
“Shannon please, I insist,” she purred.
Greg was delighted when he got the message. He hadn’t been expecting it to be honest. Hoping maybe, but not expecting. Still, when Molly’s cute little text came through asking to meet up after school, he had to smile. Perhaps his luck really was changing.
Blog. Email. Porn. Searching a recipe for pasta. Porn. A map search of a restaurant address. Youtube. Porn. News. Some dreadful social site Sherlock was sure to avoid. A dating service. Porn—
“For now, watch and see where this development goes,” Sherlock said. “I’d hate to jump in too early. It’s likely just what Moriarty wants. Perhaps if I stay out of his way I’ll simply allow the relationship to fizzle out on its own.”
soon.”
John pondered that. Part of him wanted to take care of his…er…problem. But at the same time this was embarrassing enough with an audience. And besides, Sherlock might feel used. So instead he shook his head as he sank to his knees.
“Come on, I’ve got a plan,” Sally said with a sigh. “Wait a bit and we’ll put it to work. This needs time to fully come together.”
“This is your heart,” he said.
“Aren’t you punishing me because mother and father died?” Sherlock said in a flat voice.
To Sherlock’s surprise, his body responded. He was achieving an erection with this stimulus.
She pulled on her coat and turned to look at him. “Don’t make me
Irene felt her lower lip tremble, but again she couldn’t speak. She waited, feeling a few tears already leaking down her face and knowing full well she would not be able to contain them no matter what she did.
John watched as Sherlock turned and stalked away.
“Yes, love.”
It was true. It didn’t. Not anymore. As a boy, yes, he’d shoved his potential sexual partner away, favoring something less physical. But he’d soon learned most people expected sex where any sense of romance or partnership were found. And he’d abandoned the idea of such things long ago as a result.
Molly nodded. “Oh I just, I remember you saying that you wanted to help. So I have some insights on Sherlock for that boy…Watson or whatever his name is.”
“Take Sherlock Holmes on a date,” Moriarty said. “Should be simple enough. Get him to spread his legs if you’d like. I could care less. But the main thing is I need him out of the picture so I can have Molly Holmes.”
Sherlock shook his head. "I couldn't. Not after everything. No. I believe she deserves the same consideration she gave me."
“Dr. Watson’s back,” Irene murmured.
“A bit more, Dr. Watson,” Irene said. “Almost there. Do what you think would feel good. Make our dearest Mr. Holmes come for you.”
Sherlock raised a brow and didn't answer, simply tapping something onto his phone with a rapid pace before setting it to the side.
Sherlock hesitated, wondering if he could offer to pay for John’s meal without appearing too conspicuous. But Angelo’s was an easy way to do so, he supposed.
“Thank you,” Donovan said with an eye roll. She patted his shoulder. “So trust me next time. I’m smarter than that.”
“You do know how to do this, don’t you?” John asked.
had to punch that face, I’d avoid your nose and teeth too.”
But surely there had to be something more.
“Nobody,” Jeanette glowered.
“No, but then I never am. You have to stay with him, John.”
He had to consciously stop his mouth from falling open. Sherlock apologizing? Apparently he was actually dreaming. That had to be it. He was in some awful Christmas nightmare and would wake up any moment.
"Right, I'm going out for a bit," he muttered. God only knew how much he needed some air.
Sherlock on the edge of the roof, that dark silly coat of his flapping in the wind, his collar pulled up in that way he always did in attempts to look mysterious and brooding and…well… Sherlock. Sherlock telling me goodbye. Sherlock stepping closer and then falling, like something out of a nightmare flailing in the air while I stood at a distance hardly able to move, heart pounding, breath failing me as I watched my flatmate, my partner, my
“Sherlock!”
The boy frowned, needle glinting as he turned it in his hand. “I’m happy to be of service. Life’s short. Wouldn’t mind a little more action.”
“Hmm? Yeah, just needed a little air. Just felt a little overwhelmed with everything, your brother and the woman and all that rubbish. Figured I’d take a walk, pick up a few things at the store.”
I shook my head and closed my eyes. For the love of god. Even in a minute long video Sherlock still maintained every bit of his normal character. I opened my eyes again to stare at his face. My mouth twitched and I almost spoke. I wanted to say something witty. I wanted to tell him to stop being such an obnoxious arrogant—
