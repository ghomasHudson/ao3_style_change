Tony's smile widened like a sharks, making both men flinch back. "Not as much as you will Nicky. Not as much as you will."
Ronon pressed his lips to Mckay's shoulder, tasting the salt of the sea and the faint tang of sun screen. "I hang with marine's all day. I pick up stuff."
The Iron King would fight back the darkness as all the previous Iron Kings had done for generations long past. With his holy armour, with his Iron Legions, with the blessing of the great Sol himself, God of the sky and giver of light; he would face it.
"Dunno why…" Tony confessed breathlessly, squirming as he clenched around the hot cock buried deep in his ass. "Jus' happens."
He cut the call with a snarl, his make up half done and looking almost alien as all half-done drag make up did. His head was covered in a flesh covered wig cap and the waist cincher was cutting into his flesh as he tried to breath deep enough to calm down.
With a nod and a tip of his empty cup, he wandered back toward the kitchen and rinsed his cup, turning over to dry on the rack. Before stepping unto the elevator, he gave one last long glance towards the lonely figure, framed by the tall windows, silent and still against the querulous clouds.
"Thank you Rodney" Teyla smiled and got to work. Ronon copied, feeling a bit stupid but was willing to humour his teammates if they thought it was a legitimate concern. He'd never heard of someone getting 'skin cancer' but there was a lot about the universe he still didn't know.
"You heard me. No." his fingers flew across the laser keyboard beneath the dark, smoked glass of his executive desk. "And don't try threaten to sic Agent Agent with his handy taser on me. It's not going to change my mind."
Whenever he slowed too much. Got too curious at the strange and quirky machinery, the shorter rebel behind him would nudges him forward and send him stumbling.
He'd been among the last to leave, making sure that his people were safely out of danger and that no one had been left behind in their haste. He could do nothing else. He was his mother's son. And with her death, he was the leader of his people. He felt a sharp pang of anguish slice his heart. He was too young for this. He wasn't ready.
At least the enemy had all been dealt with and Stile allowed Derek to take him back to the loft to get him cleaned up, bandaged and tucked into bed.
The blond shrugged, still working on whatever he had before him. Anthony curiosity soon got the better of him and he eased off the bed carefully and wandered over to the other man. He was soldering some delicate circuitry that looked like nothing else the brunet had ever seen before. Anthony stepped closer, almost touching the larger man’s arm as he tried to get a better look. The captain froze, glancing over from the corner of his eyes before starting once again.
Before anyone else could speak, the man whipped the thin cloth away to reveal the dismembered body of his last legionnaire. Anthony staggered forward a half step at the sight before stilling and forcing all emotion from his face.
One by one he'd seen his friends at the Hogwarts earn their rank as rider and submit themselves for choosing. He'd seen Theodore with his Leaopard Moth with its pure white wings with black ring spots. Pansy with her gorgeous red black and white Cecropia, Blaise with his pure black and daunting Peppered Moth which made him a shoe in for the Silent Scouts.
Spencer did not allow his eyes to linger more than a second on the Sub. He didn't want to know what happened to people who angered a Dom like Hotchner by looking at his collared submissive. Instead, he concentrated on the carved front of the man's desk and waited for him to speak.
"Does this mean we're space married now? I've been in an entirely different galaxy to too long and I would really like to get space married."
He especially loved it when guided Erik's calloused and capable hands guided his slim hips up and down on his lap, working that thick cock further and further up Tony's perfect ass.
As he ran his fingers over the soft and silky garments, savouring the smooth glide against his skin. He missed soft things. The last few weeks had been rough durable clothes and sleeping on various uncomfortable surfaces, strapped with various weapons and accoutrement that were too important not to have on his person. This was the first time in a while that they’d spent the day in a place safe enough to let their guards down a bit.
His mind raced even as the Advisor returned to their previous droning, his armored fingers tapping softly against the heavy armrest. Finally, the war council dispersed and he was left alone with his general.
Derek hummed and let his leg slip between Stiles', his hand resting on his lover's bare stomach and draining some of the lingering pain away.
He'd thought about trying to make a life on earth, as the others had. He'd even tried to settle down on L2 with Hilde and the dream that was a junkyard. But he hadn't been able to stick it through, the siren song of space calling to him before too long. Howard had called it the Fever and  told of men who lived their whole lives without ever touching down on a planetary body.
The 'Doc' was a short, broad man with salt and pepper curls and a rumpled grey coat. He greeted them all with a sheepish nod, taking a moment to stare at Anthony in ill-disguised curiosity before shuffling over to a covered table.
The road was clear that morning, all the mist cleared away and the forest was damp and darkly beautiful. The cruiser soon pulled to a stop, the officer having glimpsed a spot of cream and a reflection of red glass.
He gave one last look at the blazing shoreline behind him and closed his eyes at the deep sorrow that burrowed into his heart. He swallowed it down, there would be time for wailing and weeping later.
He’d already resigned himself to never being able to meet or have a life with the one who made his soul mark tingle. Even if the person had been some random citizen of the sunlight kingdom, even if they’d been a nobleman of even a Counselor. Even if his soul mate had been Rhodes himself, he would not have been able to give himself wholly unto them as the soul bond ordained.
The beautiful stranger kept silent and Steve couldn’t help but give a deep sigh. “Maybe you’re right. Maybe there’s still a chance I can come back from this. I could still win a date with Justin Hammer at the auction tonight. I have to stick it out to the end. i owe Bucky that much at least.”
Tucking the bucket to one side and hanging the wash cloth, towel and sliver of soap nearby, he grabbed the tray and brought it over to his cot. The broth was still warm and delicious despite being barely more that flavoured water. The bread was tough and his jaw hurt from chewing after a while but he finished every last crumb. He needed his strength and for that he needed sustenance. The weak tea warmed his chest and limbs and he drained it with a sigh before shrugging back into the coat and buttoning up the crude hand carved buttons.
There was a loud thump as the Mabille landed nearby, making both riders and moths alike scamper out of the way. Draco felt a sense of smug satisfaction coming from the steed and sent back a warm push of amazement and awe.
He was made to stop before a small work area, one of the vehicles was up on blocks for repair. Several parts had been set aside for what looked like cleaning and tables full of some strange and some familiar tools were lying about.
Thankfully Steve didn't address the tears again,  letting Tony work his way through his feelings with a tender kiss to his forehead. Tony's body shook with sobs, feeling as if something had been released inside him.
They all went into her tote bag, along with a bottle of water, a granola bar and her overdue library books. She stomped down the stairs, stopping at a closed door.
Aaron Hotchner had a reputation that proceeded him far and wide. His unsmiling visage was more often the last thing traitors and other trouble makers saw before being granted the relief that death finally brought.
Her face took on a thunderous expression as she scowled at him.  "So how about you shut up, man up and let's get this fucking over with, Ewan."
He rolled them over, laying his mate gently unto the piled furs as he continued to rock into him, swallowing the soft sighs and whimpers that fell from his lover's lips. Maybe one day Rodney would allow Ronon to pup him. They were sure to make beautiful, smart and strong babies.
There was also the slight concern that if they didn't have enough proper drainage, the city could become waterlogged and sink under the ocean. And with the shield only having enough power to stay up for a little more than 37 hours continuously , they would all drown before they could solve the problem efficiently.
the other chapters were inspired by this next picture inspiration and by now i've blown all the word count requirements of the challenge but i'm just enjoying this too damn much to care.
Spencer's eyes flickered to the robust young man keeling in attendance at the side of the desk, his eyes averted demurely. He was dressed in soft white pants, his chocolate skin glistening along his bare shoulders and chest. His head was shorn close to his skull and he wore a diamond studded sub collar around his neck. it was a gorgeous piece of art, with a small platinum lock hanging from it, nestled in the dip of his collar bone.
Steve was so exhausted, he almost got written up for falling asleep in class again. He walked slowly home, thinking of the one-month old screaming tyrant and exhausted brother waiting for him. He took the long way home for that reason, wondering if he should just take a nap before facing the screaming baby again. When he finally made it home, he walked in slowly to prepare himself.
“Right now? I think I need some hydration before we go again,” Tony teased, yelping when the Alpha pinched his bottom in retaliation. “I...I don’t know Steve. Honestly we should probably keep quiet...about the pregnancy, not the bond. At least until after the first trimester. Soulmates or not, a lot can happen in the first trimester and I don’t want to get anyone’s hopes up. Other than that...I mean...we should probably meet each other’s parents? Maybe...move in together?”
"I'm not saying your fears aren't justified, especially with the current political climate. But if you think you won't love that boy and protect him just as much as your other two because of the fact that he's black? Well..." he trailed off with a smile.
“So you really weren’t mad at me?” the brunette asked. Steve laughed at that, motioning him to join him at the dining room table as the genius sat across from him.
“They have their moments,” Cheryl agreed. “I wouldn’t have all of this though...if...I had dealt with it when I wasn’t ready.” Bucky stared back at her for a long moment.
She had finished her bachelors in business at one of Wakanda's universities and was about to walk across the stage. She had seen her family fairly frequently over the last four years, though mostly through video chat. They had visited twice and paid for her to come home once, but this'll be the first time they'd seen in each other in person in...almost a year and a half.
? Jo, I’ve never tried to give you away. Ever,” he said, sitting closer to her to address her more seriously. He felt fury grow in his gut – yet again – because of this woman. “Jesus Christ that
“Okay guys, I should probably get back to my kids. And yes I’m including my husband,” Peter said with a smile as he turned back to his dads. The two stopped arguing in favor of pulling the grown man into a group hug.
She sat on a chair near the pool, waiting for everyone to come when she was joined by the kid she’d just been thinking about.
She had questions – lots and lots of questions especially about her idiotic brother…but she knew Happy probably knew the bare minimum enough and couldn’t answer her questions right now anyway. When he pulled up to the emergency room entrance she jumped out of the car, not even grabbing her backpack.
“Steve isn’t stupid you guys, it probably felt really right to him,” Sam, ever the mediator, spoke up on the other Alpha’s behalf.
“Tony, wait,” the blonde said as he pulled back, arms still snuggly holding the brunette in place. “Are you...do you want to keep it? Are we...are we having a baby? You sure you want to do this all over again?”
“Oh wait,” Rhodey said going to the bag and grabbing some stuff before heading back to Steve. He handed him a pair of sweats to change into. Steve smiled at the man before moving to get some sleep.
"Emerson, you know I was joking right? I am not actually upset, I am beyond excited to see you again." Emerson felt her heart burst in her chest, pleasantly surprised to find all her hypotheticals were wrong. However, she still hadn't said anything and felt her face burn red when her Dad continued snickering behind her. She saw Peter out of the corner of her eye join their Dad behind her - bastard joining in to laugh at her expense.
"What haircut?" Tony called after her as he turned to look at his husband in betrayal. Steve simply laughed at the man as he helped Miles take his plate back to the sink.
“I told him to come over whenever, so I guess whenever he decides to get here,” he finished freezing in the entranceway to the kitchen. Cause he was here.
The older woman took a few breaths before moving to Emerson, pulling a knife from her shoe and cutting her hands and feet free.
of my anger is correctly directed, Pop," she said with the spot on Stark snark. Tony couldn't help laughing again, shrugging at his glaring husband.
Guilt crept in the back of her mind with that thought. Then that guilt immediately dissipated when Cara grabbed her hand briefly amongst the crowd.
“Alright, okay, yes. It happened. Let’s move on,” Sam said with a small smile, moving to collect the cards and grab another game.
“Alright baby, be good for your Uncle Steve,” Buck said as he kissed her loudly on the cheek. She giggled adorably as Steve suddenly struggled to keep her upright, as she had practically bent over backwards to hug her dad.
“Don’t you ‘doll’ me James Buchanan Barnes! You really think Tony is hot, don’t you?” Bucky looked at his brother for help, but Steve only offered him a smug smile as he took a sip of his beer.
“…I can’t sleep thinking about seeing him again. Last time I saw him…” he trailed off thinking about watching police arrest a drunk Ty that had broken into Tony’s mansion.
“Yeah, just…text me when and where and I’ll be there,” Tony said with a small smile as he stared at Steve a moment longer.
It was him, probably writing some equations based on the concentration on his face. His brows were furrowed and his tongue was sticking out, drawn in pencil with astounding attention to detail. Tony stared at if for a few more seconds before flipping to the next page.
“You don’t? Am I...am I too late?” he asked, looking up at the blonde from where his head was resting on the bed. He hadn’t even considered that Clint’s feelings had changed.
“Hey, I didn’t say this was okay!” Steve called fondly after the two, who were now out of the ring and walking away.
“No, of course not. But you’re going to MIT in the fall…” Steve trailed off, as if that explained everything.
Case in point - when he picked his son back up from Ty’s later, Harley was somehow both hyper and cranky after only being with the Alpha for a few hours.
” The man’s tone and use of the word ‘love’ calmed Steve’s nerves, going so far as to fill the blonde with a sense of warmth. Especially at hearing the ‘L’ word in regards to Tony.
“That’s my girl!” he cheered as he brought her onto his lap and covered the giggly baby in kisses. He even clapped his hands together as Steve rolled his eyes fondly at him.
“Thanks, Stevie,” Bucky whispered quietly as they listened to Joey start singing again. He looked over his brother, frowning at seeing just how tired he was.
He decided to wait until he had put Peter to bed to discuss anything with Joey. His little man had asked the blonde to put him to bed with his best puppy eyes over dinner, which of course had the man immediately conceding. Tony offered to do the dishes while Joey went to finish an essay she was working on.
“Is this a medical emergency?” he asked her as he kept half his body inside the building. She rolled her eyes at him and stood up straighter to respond.
“Honey, you’re past the point of exhaustion. Your parents are here so we can catch up on sleep, spend some alone time with Harley, maybe have a date night where you and I go out and enjoy ourselves.” Steve’s inner Alpha perked up at that, his body making an involuntary grunt at that prospect before his mate quickly shut that down. “Oh no, my body is nowhere near ready for that, I mean just us, no kids, enjoying each other’s company.”
. Cause I just crumbled to the ground in pain. But apparently they’ve never been kicked in the crotch! I think she bruised my…” she did a weird hand-wave over the injured area, “pelvis? Crotchal region? Pop help me out here what’s the medical term for my broken vaginal area?”
He had a few weeks left to have the place to himself and debated back and forth whether he should throw the note out or not. For all he knew, it was just a nice gesture from an incredibly handsome billionaire. Nothing to read into or make any assumptions from.
“Good morning, my love,” Steve said with a smile before leaning up to kiss Tony again. The genius easily complied, laughing a little in the kiss. They were quickly interrupted when their kids loudly made their way in.
“Tony?” she waited for his full attention again. “Right now. In this moment. Do you have any urge to hit me?”
“What about her mom? What happened to her?” Tony asked as Steve cast his eyes downward at the question.
“Remember when I was so sick I was firing from both ends?” He immediately grimaced, hands going up to his face as he groaned at the memory. She didn’t stop the laughter this time, enjoying the way he pouted at her for it.
“Why don’t you take a nap?” he suggested, knowing she had already started to nod off. “I’ll come get you for dinner, and then we can do your homework instead of watching TV tonight.”
"Well well well how long was I at that convention?" Tony asked with a smile on his face as he inspected Miles' cut with a huge grin. Emerson stepped up and moved to sit on the other side of her Dad, shooting a smile at Steve when Tony's jaw dropped.
“As entertaining as that would be, I’m not sure that’s necessary. Rumlow here is too much of a chicken shit to start anything,” Clint said with confidence as his old flame shot daggers with his eyes.
“This is your Daddy, the one I’ve been telling you about,” Steve whispered with a smile. “Tony, this is our son.”
“Guys, really, I appreciate it. But I would really rather work,” Steve said after giving the three some pointed eye contact. His friends collectively groaned but didn’t press the matter any further, especially when they were no longer the only ones in the station.
Joey was fuming. She failed her English test even though she actually studied for it. She glared at the paper in her hand as she stood near her locker, hearing familiar giggles behind her.
As she was walking, she followed the sounds of singing, recognizing Italian as the language as she made her way to the bathroom.
“Early detection is key, you’ll be just fine Josephine,” Carolyn said before taking a bite of her summer salad.
, he thought fondly as he leaned down to kiss her cheek one more time before obliging her request, Tony finding comfort in the dark room as he walked towards the open door.
“We all heard from Dr. Chase, Stark. Don’t think you or your mini me over there can get away with milking this. We’re actually all just here for Peter’s birthday,” the smartass assassin teased with a small smile.
But then said husband reached his hands around to grab the shorter man’s ass and Tony found himself moaning louder, pulling back to glare a little at the smirking beautiful bastard.
They played games until dinner time, where there were plenty of pizza boxes waiting for the return of the Avengers. Which luckily was just after they finished dessert - where her Daddy made them all ice cream sundaes. Daci was ready to grab her spelling test to show her Tati when JARVIS suddenly spoke up.
“I can think of a better way for the two of us to...sober up…” Tony purred as Steve felt his pants tighten. He froze for a moment when the Omega leaned up to kiss him, but quickly snapped out of it and brought the brunette up into his arms. Steve carried the two to his bedroom and preened at the feeling of Tony laughing at his antics.
Tony suggested to look at places she and Bucky would have gone to together, which was two other places Steve hadn’t thought of. Afterward, with no sign of her, Steve finally realized he knew where she’d be.
“You forget I befriended your teacher, Miss Bishop. She told me what happened but left out the juicy details. Spill, peanut,” he said before running a hand through her hair, instantly making her feel better.
“Wade did you pick her so you could wear a seashell bikini?” Steve asked, laughing along with his husband.
"Just one Peter, we'll be having dinner soon!" Joey shouted and frowned when she simply heard the pair laugh at her.
“How are they rude?” Harley asked, getting defensive instead of apologetic. Tony knew his son would be an Alpha when he eventually presented by how controversial the pup has always been. But Tony wasn’t offering any change in his smell to give the pup any wiggle room, letting disappointment seep through his scent.
The blonde smiled at the thought of his family, especially at the wiggle worm on his lap who was purposefully making it more difficult to dress him in pajamas – typically to make his time with his Papa last longer. Which Steve didn’t necessarily mind.
He laughed a little as his own joke like the dork he was, glad to see Dr. Chase had already moved to exit and didn’t see him.
“If you’re finished,” she said pointedly while sitting up in defiance. He could see the pain behind her eyes, but was impressed with her initiative enough to raise his hands in surrender.
hear her right? She drove drunk?” he asked. The teen groaned in his embrace before burying her face back into his neck, shoulders hunched in shame.
“Babe? You dressed?” he heard his husband ask, surprised he hadn’t just burst in like he normally does. He finished getting dressed before opening the door into their bedroom.
"You should've seen us thirty minutes ago," his husband teased back as Steve playfully flicked his love's ear.
“Nope! This is my Petey!” Clint said as he blew a raspberry on the baby’s neck, making him shriek with laughter. Tony sat down on the side and let his feet dangle in, watching the other Omega fondly play with his baby. Steve settled against his legs as Harley swam over to Bucky, latching onto his uncle and watching his little brother closely.
“Seriously Tony? You make sure you’re on time for Pepper but can’t do the same for me?” Steve asked when he stepped onto their floor, holding a sleepy Morgan in his arms and looking thoroughly pissed. Tony opened his mouth to answer but was confused when Daci rounded the corner. Steve followed his line of sight before rolling his eyes heavily. “Buck’s out with his new girlfriend, kids already ate lunch and we’ll be back in an hour or so,” the blonde said without looking at his husband, taking Morgan with him to the elevator in a bit of a huff.
Tony's heart sunk at the realization, not that he'd outlive all of them. But that he was this upset about it.
He stood a few feet away, hands grabbing his hair as he looked back at Steve in disbelief. Concern washed over the blonde, immediately squashing his anger as he frowned at how scared his husband was at the simple mention of that man.
“I will buy them an entire goddamn restaurant, just don’t stop,” he pleaded as he tried to undue his love’s belt clasps; his arms too short to reach at the position Steve had them in.
“Can someone please tell me what the actual fuck is happening?” Tony asked before being reprimanded by his youngest/oldest.
“And you? How are you doing Joey?” her Pop asked as he reached over to tussle her hair in playful greeting.
“What inspection?” she asked, shifting a little on the bed in pain. Which Steve did everything in his power not to laugh at. He quickly brought his hands up to his own chest to demonstrate, nodding at her to copy him.
“My heart’s been hurting lately. I thought it was anxiety for having…‘he who shall not be named’ back. But I had Dr. Banner look at it today, or rather Rhodey dragged my ass down to have him look at it today, and…he said I’d need surgery. Something about replacing a heart valve and I honestly didn’t hear the rest after surgery…” he looked down then, wondering why his family was having such bad luck lately.
“I’m sorry! Please…ah Daddy…I’m sorry!” she cried. He continued for another moment before pausing to ask her the question again.
“Daddy!” the toddler cried as he ran towards the genius, who gladly picked the boy up into his arms before planting several kisses on his face.
“I’ll get it, just stay here…before your disease spreads to my kids,” she muttered as she walked away from them, Trevor looking like he wanted to punch the blonde.
"Um...wow," the man said as he genuinely looked amazed at the family. "She really doesn't tell anyone anything, does she?" All - minus Miles - quickly realized who he meant as Emerson and Peter shouted the answer.
The birth itself was as gross and painful as everyone made it out to be. Rhodey and Jarvis held his hands as Anna - a certified midwife - helped deliver the baby. And when Tony held that little boy for the first time in his arms - he knew he’d love and protect this kid with every ounce of his being.
“Jesus Coulson, warn a guy,” Clint muttered as he extinguished the flame before slipping the rest back in his pocket.
"Check Miles' bedroom, that's where they went a while ago," their daughter said as she continued flexing her hands. The fathers shared a look before walking with each other in the direction of their youngest's bedroom.
Emerson suddenly reached behind her to grab Steve’s left wrist. “It’s after midnight! Happy birthday Peter!” she said with a smile after giving her Pop his arm back.
“Fine, no more laughing at Ruth’s creative punishment…” the genius agreed. “What do you think Steve?” he asked his husband, making good on his promise to step back on this one.
The group of boys were speechless; obviously homophobic but unsure how to respond to a man much bigger than them. And protecting his child.
," Steve commanded, satisfaction on his face when the confused Alpha dropped automatically. Clenching and unclenching his fists, Steve took a breath before further addressing the pathetic man in front of him. “I have been patient, Stone. Even when you let my son down with empty promises, even when you trash talked me to his face. I've even let it slide when you've pathetically flirted with my Omega. But now? Now everyone knows your true colors. They see what I see, a useless, pathetic excuse for an Alpha.
“He’s right,” Steve’s voice startled the both of them, turning to the blonde who had a sleeping husband fully on his lap. He didn’t realize the others had been listening in to their conversation. “Daci, we’re all just happy you’re back.” Thor and Bruce also offered them a smile.
When she rounded the corner, she saw her Pop sitting by himself, head resting in his hands as his elbows rested on his knees. She slowly walked over to him before she stopped in front of him. He still hadn’t noticed her until she quietly whispered, “
“Baby boy is that what this is about? You had a bad dream about your Daddy?” Tony cooed to the toddler who nodded his head yes while rubbing his face in Tony’s chest. Peter reappeared and joined the others on the couch, sitting on Tony’s other side and cuddling close to his brother.
“Well,” his husband said before huffing out a laugh, “this can only end terribly.” Peter couldn’t help smiling back at him, accepting the hug the taller man was trying to pull him in to. The arachnid tightened his arms, relishing the moment until he felt a certain pair of hands roam down his back and cup his ass.
But she could clearly hear the cheers from everyone else, reaching the other side and turning around to face the Hulk while bouncing back and forth on her feet. She could only smile at the shocked far away look on his face. He shook his big head before taking off after her, roaring loudly in excitement.
Out of the corner of his eye, he saw a few run away…in the direction that his sister had gone. He moves to follow them, unaware that a large man had joined the opposing side. The giant man quickly grabs Peter’s leg as he began to swing up high. He brings him down hard, slamming his body down on the pavement.
Grief engulfed his very existence as he screamed his soul out. Nurses rushed in, no doubt from the noises from both Tony and the machines he was hooked up to. But they were pushed aside as he heard his mate join them.
Nat had walked around to grab Morgan, taking her a few feet away and teaching her niece to tumble. Wiggly legs made Steve bring his attention back to his mini me before gently laying him on the padded ground. He suddenly noticed that Daci was quiet, just watching the group before Steve decided to make her an offer.
” He could hear her hold her breath after that confession. He didn’t stop rubbing circles, but did bring his other hand to card through her hair as he kissed her forehead.
Two weeks after Kimberly reappeared he was growing more impatient. After repeatedly assuring Steve he would handle it, the genius made his way to their daughter’s room as his husband opted to go for a run. Her attitude ever since her mother’s reappearance had gotten worse and tonight had been a breaking point. Steve had pried a little more about her mother over dinner and she retaliated with spiteful words. You could see it on her face she had immediately regretted it, but quickly left for her room before apologizing. Peter shared a look with his Dad before they both looked at Steve, whose face looked so hurt Tony felt his own heart ache.
“Please….let me explain,” Tony got out past the burning in his throat, “I…we had no other choice! You wouldn’t listen!” Tony leaned dizzily against the wall, a migraine creeping over his head as well as the lack of eating properly catching up with him.
Captain America’s snarling face stared down at him, “TONY!”, his face turned to disbelief, “What have you done?!” The disbelief gave way to the rage he had been holding back and he marched forward, revealing to Tony that the worst had happened. He had remembered the mindwipe.
Tony hears the swishing of his workshop’s door sliding with a violent thud, the automatic lights switching on to reveal three silhouettes. He removes the half-finished technology by sliding it into the drawer, after a second thought, moving all the papers in there too. Tony inhales sharply with blind panic and squares his shoulders ready to face the music.
Steve at this point sufficiently worried, placed his hand on Tony’s burning sweaty forehead, cluing him onto how sick this workaholic man was. He had worked himself into a sick state from all of the worrying and not asking for help. “Friday call Dr Banner down here, we need some fever medicine,” Steve sighed as they waited for the doctor.
Tony’s heart gave a throb, knowing that he’d done this. It was his fault after all, the final call to Dr Strange had been him. Tony slowly approached the  bulky figure cautiously, “Steve…”, he hoarsely whispered, wishing with all his heart there had been another way.
Tony’s voice choked, no replies on his tongue, the irritating burn from his throat spread to his eyes. He looked at Steve through watery blue eyes stricken form the truth, unable to escape it. Leaning on the wall like a lifeline, Tony slid down it, until he sat on the floor knees bent, head on his hands. He managed to choke out a, “I know…”
Tony came to, to the sound of Dummy’s whirring and clacking in the background. He was lying on the table the hardness of it punishing his back. The lights had been dimmed, “Frrigh…” Tony croaked out, his voice breaking. “Friday…” he tried again after clearing his breath but there was no response. He slowly gets up from the table and Captain America’s massive figure hunched over the seating area came into view. He looked defeated his head in his hands, which were clenched in angry helplessness.
He turned wide eyes to the startled looking bartender. The young woman got an uncertain look in her eye but nodded. “Yes sir. You said you wanted to the ‘good stuff’.”
He finally answered the other man’s question, his voice thready and wet. “Maybe there are some battles you just don’t walk away from. Lord knows I’ve walked away from many that I shouldn’t have.”
He blinked, grunting as his eyes watered against the harshly light of the infirmary and let out a breath when they dimmed immediately. He looked up to Teyla's smiling and serene face.
Those thoughts are interrupted when she heard a small knock at her door. She closed her eyes and took a big gulp, before welcoming him in.
Nat had left a message at their villa, assuring them she was handling it. That didn’t necessarily put his mind at ease, steeling himself as Steve joined him a moment later. He was dressed in a tank top and shorts, reminding the genius he’d suggested walking along the sand together.
The actions got the two things he wanted, a giggle out of his pup and a way for the pup to not see what scared him. Facing forward, the two blondes went further into the museum until they settled on the dinosaur Steve was looking for.
“That’s the idea,” Tony said with glee, “when I take over the company after college. My father made his money developing weapons for the government. I want to use the money and resources to make clean sustainable energy for the planet.”
He never wanted to be one of those people that ignored their friends in favor of hanging with their significant other.
“Seriously?” the pup asked in more exaggerated offense. “Well...what’s your favorite movie? Is it something old and boring?” Steve chuckled as he turned to face the boy before answering.
“Yup, you are definitely a scary monster, Joey,” he agreed easily, getting a chuckle from the blonde when he threw a wink at his little brother. “Where’s your fin?” he asked as he walked over to help, sitting on the side of the tub while he helped morph the bubbles into a fin on her back.
“I’m also Tony’s ex,” the needy bitch added, trying to sit up and somehow look smug even as Tony and Steve held hands. The waiter saved her from Tony blurting something inappropriate in response, taking their orders as an uncomfortable silence fell over the table.
"Alright, well, what do you suggest then, smarty pants?" Wade just smiled at him before rolling his eyes.
She wasn’t sure how long she slept, but she woke to the sounds of people arguing. Keeping Wolf in her arms, she carefully made her way to the sounds. It only took a moment to recognize the voices, her face frowning when she could hear her father and Steve arguing.
She couldn’t hide the smile as she saw three gaped mouths looking back at her, though Peter’s was the only one who didn’t look offended.
There were numerous case files, police records, hospital exams, psychological evaluations dating as far back as her birth. She was taken from her father when she was eleven, mother died of an overdose at seven. Put into foster care where she was passed around like an unwanted burden. History of physical abuse, sexual abuse, psychological abuse…for fuck’s sake she was FIFTEEN. There were one or two arrest records for being a runaway and prostitution when she was thirteen, but both were reduced or redacted. He had gotten to the physical evidence portion of the report, pictures of her throughout the years bearing different scars and bruises. He couldn’t look away at the horror in front of him, didn’t notice someone had woken up and was watching him. Hadn’t noticed until he mumbled something along of the lines of “rip that fuckers balls off” and was interrupted by a sleepy voice beside him.
“Steve isn’t it a little soon to be bonding with that pretty Omega? It's only been what, two months?” Nat asked as she brushed past him to grab her own beer.
Anthony ached, his heart twisting at this weakness. Here he was, letting down his defenses before the enemy. Soul mate or not, The Captain was dangerous. He was the leader of the rebel scum, the one who’d united the rabble and had led them against the sunlight kingdom. He was a clever and ruthless scoundrel who the Iron King had sworn to destroy.
He grunted and they met in the middle with a kiss that began as a fight for dominance but slowly turned softer, sweeter; with a hunger that surged up his throat and came out as a deep moan. He bucked his hips as Reaper’s hand worked him through his thick leather pants, the man’s thighs flexing as his hips bucked.
"You looking for trouble Talia?" he taunted her. "You ready to take on a child of the Nogitsune once more? How long did it take for your wounds to heal the last time, huh? Two whole months, right? Maybe this time I can make them permanent. How does that sound? I certainly look forward to the challenge of carving my initials into your forehead."
The little Vauxhall Viva was wrapped around a massive tree, having slammed head first into the thing.  Poor Eugené had been thrown clear, her lithe dancer's body crumpled on the peat moss covered ground. Jake had suffered an awful fate, his lanky frame crushed by the dashboard as it had been pushed back by the heavy engine block.
He was just contemplating putting on the floor length red stain night gown when a low voice came from beyond the change room door.
Dwayne's shoulder was warm against his and he watched the man's fingers as he started to play. His voice was warm and smooth as well aged scotch.
"I like it. You'll stay here while you craft them. We will send someone to get the things you need from your studio. You will cancel all other clients."
"You got a problem with nudity, Mckay?" John paused from where he had been unzipping his fly, his dog tags bright against his hairy chest. "Cuz I know we've all seen each other naked a bunch of times on missions."
Noises attracted zombies and other walking horrors that now felt brave enough to walk openly; snacking on whatever they could get their hands, tentacles or ravenous glow clouds around.
Rodney sank to his knees and extended his hand towards his mate and lover. When Ronon was kneeling before him, he pressed a series of buttons on his tablet and the ship around them flickered and disappeared. Rodney's calming hand stopped Ronon from flinching too hard.
After listening to his woes, she hummed softly before curtly reminding him of  his culture and hung up. He gaped at the phone, affronted by her unspoken slight at his intelligence, before flopping back unto the bed with a sigh.
“I’d never seen a Legionnaire up close before” a voice came from behind him and Anthony froze. The voice was deep, reverberating through the air and sending a shiver down his spine. “I’m torn between being terrified and intrigued. They’d always been like the boogie man to us. Spectres of heat and light ready to snatch naughty children out of their beds.”
Ewan pursed his lips at the sight, peering through the half frosted glass of Candy's 1970s porridge coloured, two door Vauxhall Viva. He was squished in the backseat with Candy's roommate Eugené while his roommate and Candy's on again off again lover, Jake, lounged in the front seat.
The shadow user balanced them out, bringing a sense of calm and peace to the savage brashness both Naru and Kiba had way too much of. Their love making changed, losing that sense of urgency and taking on a deeper, more emotional meaning. Shika had worshipped them, kept them on the edge of ecstasy and taught them a few tricks that completely blew their minds; among other things.
Stiles' skin was luminous in the moonlight. The moles that dotted his face and neck continued down his shoulders and back like stars. Derek liked to gently trace patterns between them with his fingertips, like the constellations. He would follow along with his tongue afterwards, making his lover squirm and writhe on the bed.
His chest ached, his breaths burning as his vision swayed. He leaned his head against the wheel and tried to do one of the exercises that Jarvis tried to teach him but it didn't seem to be working.
He started getting really worried by the time dinner had rolled around and there were no signs of his friends. He tried ringing their phones but reception near the house was shitty at best. Finally he asked the B&B owners to call the police. Two officers came around, asking him questions and getting as much information as he could.
He felt really good to be working alongside with the police, ever since he had been inducted as a Junior Avenger. He'd been a bit put out at first, not been seen as an adult, but after a few close calls with sticking his nose into Avenger business and a few 'Come to Jesus' talks with Tony and Steve, he been happy with the restricted duties. Besides, the heroes had made him feel included and welcome in so many other ways.
Looked like Scotty boy was just as big of a coward as ever. Stiles had long ago stopped feeling the betrayal of having his best friend turn away from him. The deep cut of Scott rejecting him as a monster then skipping joyfully to the very wolves who'd been responsible for it all for the bite.  Now all Stiles felt was a numbing indifference where the crooked jawed boy was concerned. That turned out to be a good thing because people whom Stiles felt negatively toward usually ended up suffering… a lot.
Kiba chuckled and let his head fall against the soft grass, looking up at the cloudless blue sky through the treetops. He felt trouble free and more content than a runt in a puppy pile.
It was able to scavenge and extra battery pack and weapons from the mangled legionnaires while Anthony equipped everything thing he could from his armor. He felt a pang at leaving it behind. The crimson and red suit had been a part of his life for so long and he felt naked and vulnerable without it.
He gaped open mouthed as Derek climbed in, dressed in head to toe tight black leather, looking like a scowling sex on legs.
They finally arrived as a larger doorway, this one had an actual door that opened on rumbling tracks. The room beyond was fitted with the same white lights as the large room from before. It seemed to be some kind of tech kept for the more important areas.
He awoke in an all new room, this one larger than the others and looked lived in, comfortable. His head ached like nothing lese and he swallowed a groan wondering absently why he wasn’t yet dead.
Ewan inhaled sharply, the brisk chill of the encroaching mist hurting his nose. "I have a really bad feeling about this. About this house. About this whole place. You didn't say anything about this when you asked us to come along and keep you company. Let's visit a quaint old house you said, Enjoy the beautiful fall colours you said. You didn't say anything about driving through the Forest of Death and Blood to get to Purgatory itself."
No. that sounded just a flaky as Scott and his last minute ditching of Stiles' well made plans. He had to go ahead with it. He owed it to himself.
Kiba kicked at the dirt road as he walked, hands in his pockets as he slouched within his jounin jacket.  Akamaru was just a bit ahead, sniffing at bushes and generally being a dog. It wasn't often that his nin companion got to just fuck around so Kiba liked to cut him some slack every so often.
All because Penelope Garcia liked his work. He cleared his throat, interrupting the blonde's cherry babbling.
Rodney led the team to open and flush all the water collections and treatment facilities, dedicating one of the ZPMs to the effort. When asked for his reasoning, he explained how not only would concentrating on that area help them with their potable water problems but it would help flush the miles and miles of old systems under the city.
"We go north. To Durmstrag. Dumbledore dare not go against the ice fortresses of the north with their wild winter magic. He's already stretched himself thin with fighting the Summer Kingdoms. We can find shelter there for now."
Stiles had hit speed dial in a flash, growling as he got sent to voicemail. When Scott did pick up, the noise in the background was too loud too appreciate Stiles' acerbic tongue lashing.
The next thing he knew he was sobbing, heaving breaths felt like lead as he broke down completely. It was all just too fucking much all at once. He couldn't handle it.
The frail treaty between the  Vulpēs Vulpini and the Canis Lycaon of Beacon Hills had held for the last two years, balanced delicately on the reputation and respect of Sheriff Janek Stillinski. The Reynard of the Vulpini was his own son and the sheriff stood as the only authority Stiles showed any kind of deference too. On the other hand, Talia Hale, the Alpha of the Lycaon and Deputy Mayor of Beacon Hills, was someone who Stiles didn't respect in the slightest.
He could shoulder it though. It was what he'd always done. He'd step away from SI for a while, letting Pepper and Happy circle the wagons and protect the company.
"Yeah. That mission was fucked." Kiba bared his teeth in a parody of a grin. "But we came home and I have two days down time to my name so I'd call it a win. Besides, Hinata's got Neji to mother hen over her and the medic-nins have Matamoro on the really good drugs so he's better than fine."
Shika had just muttered. "Troublesome." and had let Naruto lead him back to that shitty apartment; Kiba following along having sent Akamaru on his own way.
Happy Halloween Everybody! it's done. i can't believe it. so proud of myself. I hope you had as much fun as i did. i may end up putting the Rodney/Ronon stuff in a separate story, maybe. if i'm feeling inspiration. i have so many other WIPs to concentrate on. and Rough Trade November starts tomorrow. whew. no rest for the wicked.
They both had learned their lesson about being barefoot in the garage space and the fluffy panther slippers Tony had bought as a gag gift had turned into an ideal compromise.
Shepard had the goons running around the city, battening down the hatches as all the ATA positive pilots shuttled the Athosians and most of their possessions off the main land and though the gate to the alpha site.
He had to crush that part of him. He had to kill that dangerous hope. He could not show weakness nor doubt. This man was his enemy and would kill him in an instant the moment he found out who he really was.
"I do know." he murmured against that wonderful crooked mouth. "I love you too. You are Di Na Nwunye."
When Erik met Tony he was walking back from getting an early breakfast from a nearby food truck. He'd been working earlier hours at his shop to cover a big job he'd gotten from Klue. Five vehicles that needed outfitting in a way that normal auto shops couldn't handle.
Naru looked completely blissed out, smiling lazily as covered with come as he looked at them both. His eyes were warm with such love and affection that Kiba couldn't help but lean down and kiss him hard, his hips stuttering as he too fell into ecstasy. Naru tasted like Shika and smelled like them both, switching some trigger deep inside Kiba's chest and releasing the last of the cold stone-like tension that had been tucked there for the past year.
Teyla and a few of her people stayed, mostly to stand witness of the storm and tell the tale of its passing to the rest of their people. The Meteorological team, or the Weathermen as they were called amongst the city dwellers, had predicted that the Athosian village would be all but washed off the mainland, the water table expected to rise way above the ground level. The Athosians had been both alarmed and sad at the news but they were Pegasus born so they rolled with it.
Spike barked a laugh and gave Xander’s spent cock a teasing squeeze before snagging Xander’s gun holster and tugging the brunet towards the small office where their camp beds had been set up.
This was gooey, messy, emotional people stuff that he didn’t know what to do about. Couldn’t throw money at and hope it went away or got better.
They secured the doors from the inside and Spike disappeared through the roof access to go scrimmage for supplies before the sun rose, leaving Xander to set up their sleeping arrangements for the day. The metal rolling doors allowed him the use of a small lamp and he made quick work of setting up a small camp site in the small manager’s office.
His dad had nodded and gone on with his day, no longer that surprised with the things his son came up with.
"Eh. I figured that since I might get shot by dragon lance tomorrow or get cooked by Dragon breath and summarily eaten, I figured my five year plan wasn't worth the effort anymore."
Thankfully, Tony didn’t wake up and after a few seconds of deliberation, Steve made a decision. Carefully, he threaded his arms under the sleeping man and lifted him gently, freezing as the smaller man snuffled into his neck and gave a soft contented sigh.
The blond looked amused, which irritated Anthony to no end. He was not a joke. His rage must have shown in his eyes because the blond's smile widened. "Oh you are going to be a feisty one aren't you? I've heard that you Lightsiders run hot from being in the sun all the time… I guess that means hot in temper as well as blood."
The command team had been working almost non-stop, making sure that this storm didn't turn out like the last one. Zelenka had been in charge of making sure all the grounding stations were up and running, installing at least half as much more so that the expected lightning wouldn't harm the city. Rodney had already had plans from to harvest some of the energy and disperse the excess harmlessly out to sea. The approaching storm just brought the timeline up on them that's all.
He'd been so stupid, turning his back on his family and following a man across the country. God, he'd been such a lovesick idiot. Not that living with Howard had been a bunch of roses. Steve had promised love and family and for a short time, the little circle of friends had been like a family. Tony had truly believed that he'd found his people.
That cooled her anger well enough and she carefully backed down. Mores the pity. He was looking forward to cutting into her beautiful face. She glared back at him, trying to save face among her pack because she'd lost any influence on his long ago.
Anthony could barely suppress his flinch of shock. They thought that he was one of the generals. Thank Sol. They had not yet found out. The blond continued, turning the head in his hands around and around.
It was a jewel blue 100% wool Chunky knit cardigan that pepper had bought him for his birthday that he didn’t want to google the price of because there was pricey and then there was Pepper and Tony’s version of pricey.
Stiles stared down at his hands, flexing his palm and wincing as the thick scar tissue pulled. He absently massaged his palm with his other hand, biting back the million questions he wanted to ask.
He went to the Ikea store and came back with several free standing shelves, some cleaning supplies, bed sheets and a couple of pots and pans for the kitchen. Anything else he would either pick up another time or live without.
When it came down to it. I was a king’s duty to stand between his kingdom and any threat brought against it. He, and no one else, would be the one to finish the fight that the shadow horde started.
He'd stopped hearing John's and Teyla's voices a while ago and was fearing the worst.  They hadn't been trapped in the cave in so there was a chance that they could still make it back to the gate to dial Atlantis for help. That is if the steady rain and flash flooding the villagers had predicted as being weeks away, hadn't swept his team mates away in the sudden deluge.
Candy turned quickly in her seat, her limp pony tail flipping across her thin shoulders in her thick, vomit green sweater.  "Well, premise or not, I need to go in there and takes some pictures for my research on the blending of Jacobean, Elizabethan and Baroque influences in turn of the century Architecture and it took me a long fucking time to track down the owner and get permission to come and take photos."
Talia Hale curled her lip, her polite façade falling away as she bared her teeth at him, her fangs dropping as she growled. Stiles took his hands out of his pockets, letting them hang relaxed at his side as his nails thickened and grew black. She wanted to things up a notch? She wanna be starting something? Well, he was ready for her. He wouldn't start a fight with the wolves but he sure as fuck would put an end to it.
Ronon had been smug for months after, every time Rodney brought up the list in meetings; advocating reasons to visit one planet over the other. It made him feel that visceral sort of pride to know that he'd provided something for his mate that he took great pleasure and pride in.
On the third day, just when all seemed truly lost, there came a cry of hope. The comet wasn’t going to slam right into the planet, as previously determined, to send the human kind the same way as the dinosaur. No, the fucker was going to skip across the atmosphere like a stone across a pond and get flung away into space to continue along its merry way.
It took a few moments for the light bulb to go off over Stiles’ head and he blinked in surprise. “Really? Huh. Wow.”
By the time he'd stumbled over to her position, she'd already recovered expertly and was unto the next part of the plan; leaving him out of place and open to attack.
He was too strung out to be embarrassed and to scattered to pull on his famous Stark charm. He was just grateful that someone had been there for him when he needed. He gave the man a weak but genuine smile.
These days, Gibbs seemed more interesting in tearing him down, making him feel low. The head slaps had been sharper, more like reprimanding a naughty pet. These days Tony felt bruised, beaten down. Worn down. But, despite his personal problems, there was still a killer on the loose that they needed to track down. He  take a deep, calming breath and forged on.
He plucked out a book of suit material and opened it to a certain page before standing. At Hotchner's nod to approach, Spencer presented the chosen swatch, his hand running over the ebony material.
Some soldier called out "Attention on Deck" and the other squaddies scrambled to attention. She turned her head, taking in the man striding toward her. Johnny looked older somehow, more stern and hardened. She'd read up on all the reports from Planet P and about his rescue mission to save Carmen from the Brain bug.
The blond nodded at one of the rebels and soon enough there was a thick, dark coat being offered to Anthony. He stared at the garment for a few second before looking up at the other man in confusion.
She ducked passed him into the living room, checking for others and thankfully finding none. This was the part of her plan that had been the most wobbly. There was a packed brick of weed on the coffee table and she grabbed it, making her way out through the backdoor and over the rickety fence.
A clink of armor at his side told him that Blaise was near, his mother's unique armor hanging large on his lithe frame. the dark haired boy would have to fix it in time, using the tools she'd taught him to forge and use. But he would have to do it alone, without her sharp abrupt guidance and infinite patience. Blaise was now the only one left of his line. Just like Draco, just like most of the others now wandering the ship, sharing water and blankets and seeing to the frightened and sick.
He was put in a room this time. Sol’s blessings. It is small a cramped but there is a small cot with rough woven bedding, a small potbellied heater in the corner and a spiral woven rug made from fibres keeping his booted feet from the cold stone floor. The dim light emanating from the small heater tinged the rest of the rest of the room, packed with shelves of broken parts and storage units, a beautiful blue; catching on the edges of all the bits and bobs scattered amongst the shelves.
"Hey, are you doing the glowing red alpha glare behind me?" a boney elbow in his gut brought him back to the moment.
"Come on… You're overdue for your downtime. Zelenka and Biro will cover for you for the next 24 hours straight. I have something for you that will make you forget all of those assholes."
The man grinned in return, leaning in close but not close enough for Riddick to lunge forward and rip out the man’s neck with his teeth. This one was smart.
“I usually spring for dinner first, gorgeous” Tony’s cheeks went pink as he curled him lips into a soft smile, shrugging his shoulders. “… but hey, I’m not stopping you.”
Ronon chuckled and placed a hand on Rodney's shoulder, pushing him along gently to where John and Teyla were already taking off their shoes and hanging their weapons on a nearby fallen tree trunk.
Steve blinked at the sight, oddly charmed at the sight. The genius looked vulnerable and adorable and it sent a pang of longing deep in Steve’s chest.
Spike chuckled, plucking the unlit cigarette out of his mouth and tucked it back into the pocket of his leather duster. He carefully stepped up behind the brunette and pressed up against his back, pale hands caressing up his bare hips to rest at his waist.
Hands secured his trembling back and pulled him up, settling him on Steve's lap and settling him even deeper on the hot cock fucking him. He groaned, shuddering as he hugged Steve around the shoulders and buried his face in that warm neck.
Most of all his missed his people and despaired at leaving them without a protector. He missed Rhodes and his fond growl. He missed Virginia with her hair of flame and quiet wit. He missed the sunlight reflected in glass and on water. He missed feeling warm through and through.
Ronon didn't even look back, just shrugging his large shoulders, his hand on his sweet pulse gun. Rodney grumbled some more and John was glad that he was bringing up the rear so that Rodney wouldn't see him grinning.
“The Iron King has no heart. The Iron King has not soul.” He needed the blond to understand. “The Iron King has no soul mate.”
“You didn’t fail us, you know.” Virginia’s voice was soft in the vast chamber. “No one expected the Penumbra dogs to actually take down a Solar Forge. They are nigh fortresses.”
He'd been back in the Village Hidden in the Leaves for two days already, and had slept for a full twenty hours before feeling human enough again to face other humans. The last mission had been rough. He'd been partnered with Hinata from his old team and an older special Jounin, sent on a special mission to track and kill a missing nin with a high rank in the latest Bingo Book.
“Ah. Finally a reaction.” He smirked. “Seems like I’ve hit a nerve. Such faith in your holy protector. Let’s see if the faith is returned or if you will die here, cold and alone in the dark.”
Shikamaru smelt like ink, grass and sweat, no doubt having just gotten off his shift at Hokage Tower and spent some time training. He smelt like barbeque where he'd likely had lunch with Choji. He smelt like Ino's flowers and kunai polish. He smelled like the warmth of the sun and the cold of his famous shadows.
The rain looked pretty against the city's shield, even though they only had it up for a few hours a day. Even with the ZPMs they did have, they couldn't afford to run them down over a bit of rain. Well, not a bit of rain per say but a solid two weeks of steady downpour.
Ronon blinked, looking up at what appeared to be hard vacuum, the nebula cresting above, around and below them. He reached out his arm and felt along the sides of the ship, the image flickering where his fingers trailed.
"Oh, you know me do you Nicky?" Tony's fingers paused in his typing as he looked up at them through his fringe of hair, before he started typing once more. "You know me so well that you come in to my building, my office and try to blackmail me into doing what you want?"
The table shook, the holographic map floating above it flickering briefly before steadying. Nobody even blinked, accustomed to the General taking his ire out on the furniture. Tony nodded for the advisor to continue, listening closely to the detailed report of the indecent.
"I really think that we should at least check this out, Boss." Tony reasoned as he followed his boss off the elevator, "There's something weird about it. Familiar."
Stiles owed it to his father to have the man's heart stone join his wife in song for eternity within the vast dragon caves. The great, wise beasts kept the glowing heart stones as treasures, keeping them warm and singing with their dragon flame.
There was a spiral notebook rolled up and tucked into the frame of her bed. It had been one of the millions her brother always bought, used a few pages of then tossed aside. She'd had to rip two pages of his weird sketches and poetry out of this one but it was still serviceable. It seemed fitting to use it, with its Lisa Frankeque riot of colours and glitter on the cover. It served its purpose well under the circumstances.
He felt cold all over, even with the thick coat and he was certain that his face had blanched white.
She shrugged, not denying it, and he gave a weak chuckle which quickly turned into a cough. She retreated to the corner of the room as nurses rushed in, hugging her arms around herself and feeling cold as she watched him cough spots of blood.
He gingerly made his was over to the kitchen to collect the broom and scoop when a squeaking noise drew his eye to the fridge. He froze. The cartoon letters were moving. Of their own accord. He watched in complete silence and stillness as the letters slowly formed a simple message.
One day, Rodney stalked into the room where Ronon was doing in morning katas and, after stopping and staring at Ronon's naked and sweaty body, had told him to prepare for a trip though the gate in an hour.
The smile was back but it was brighter this time. “Let me introduce myself then, Anthony Stark. CEO and Head of R&D at Stark industries and soon to be Stark Prosthetics. You can call me Tony.”
The soldier stood abruptly, turned on his heel and strode away, leaving Anthony to redress with trembling hands. His face flamed as he clenched his fists on his thighs, his body shaking with boiling rage and icy shame. How dare they? How dare they demand that of him? He bitterly regretted not fighting against it but knew that having his body forcefully stripped would have been worse than death. Damn his logical and rational mind. He wanted to scream and break something. He wanted to find that metal handed soldier and break his jaw with his fists. He wanted to find that blond captain and….
Talia slaps a hand down on her red faced daughter's shoulder and slowly yanked her back to stand among the other wolves. Laura gave her mother and alpha a betrayed look but stayed silent and glowering, Peter's clawed hand taking the place of the alpha's and keeping the woman in place. The rest of the wolves tittered in the back but Stiles paid them no mind. Heather would be keeping a sharp eye on them.
He bounced on the balls of his feet, smiling under his mask as his seconds, growled and braced for battle. He flashed his red eyes at hers, running his tongue over his fangs in anticipation for the feel of flesh tearing , the taste of hot and sticky blood across his tongue and down his throat.
He coughed as he huddled against the metal chest plate, taking comfort in the hum of the arc reactor. They thudded down unto a nearby roof and his mask was peeled off, the night air cool against his hot and sweaty skin. Tony's voice was calm and comforting as a snick and click sounded from his suit. a molded cup placed over his nose and mouth.
“When could you have done that? When you were in the ICU fighting for your life? When you were trying to organize your dad’s funeral from your hospital bed? When you were in physiotherapy trying to get back movement in half your body? When you were in and out of the hospital for skin graft surgery?”
The rebellion would be shattered and he would have achieved his mission. Even in death. The Iron King's life was to serve the Citadel and he would gladly give it in the name of duty.
Tony dressed in his best tux and felt a deep satisfaction when the scientist flushed and gaped at the sight of his in his suit. With a chaste kiss to the other man's knuckles, he escorted him into the gala space, staying at his side as they navigated the room. Tony had never been to one before and was surprised at the number of Washington movers and shakers who were in attendance.
When he came to live on Atlantis and had come to learn of Rodney's voracious lust for knowledge, Ronon had decided to compile a list of address with little notes and annotations on what he knew of the planets that lay beyond.
Stiles made a 'meh' sound. "Kinda why I went for instant gratification with Hale. And sucking his brains out through his cock allowed me enough access to the guard house to sneak into the records room and find out where my dad was buried."
“So, I was told there would be fucking my sweet ass so deep that I screamed your name? I’d like to get to that very much soon please and thank you.”
He hung his weapons just out of reach, his guns and a few knives joining them. He was by no means unarmed but there was nothing on him that Riddick could reach easily without dislocating something. Riddick stilled as the man slowly straddled his lap, shifting his weight as he ran his hands over Riddick’s shoulder and chest.
On his other side, his delta fox and left hand, Danny Mehealani huffed a laugh as he kept pace along the wooded path. "Or the time you spread the rumor that the Hale kids were infected with lice and they all had to stay home from school for the two weeks needed to apply the treatment. I swear Cora Hale was going to wear your guts for garters because she had to miss out on the soccer final against Beacon Falls. I thought she was going to wolf out right there in the hallway."
The Captain and his guard were waiting near the same place they’d first met and Anthony’s mark tingled at the sight of the man. His heart did a funny blip in his chest and he ruthlessly squashed it. He had no use for hope. No use for the squishy emotions Virginia described on days when he felt stretched thin.
i love me some Erik Killmonger/Tony Stark though mostly AU because it's tricky in canon. they make such a cute couple though.
He so fucking tired and didn't want to do this anymore. Any of it. He was stepping back and letting the chips fall where they may.
“Well don’t you look like a real LumberJack Timberwolf.” He curled his lip, hooking the helmet unto the bike. He slung his saddle bags over his shoulder and unzipped his leather riding jacket.
Candy got out of the car and politely introduced herself. The man was the caretaker, Mr. Dudley. His wife the housekeeper was waiting up at the house for them. He was going into town for some supplies and would be back shortly. Ewan almost asked if they were any relations to the Dusrleys from Hill House but a scorching glare from Candy shut him up.
To hear him brag in that halls about Peter's injuries, about how he'd cried out for help and how they'd taken turns in kicking him had made her blood boil. The attackers had been arrested but the DA hadn't been able to make the case against Flash stick, especially with his father's bevy of lawyers. There'd been no solid proof of his involvement, just the testimony of dubious characters paid to stay silent.
Weir had ordered  a portion of their supplies to the alpha site as well as some non-essential personnel. They had also sent a message back to earth informing them of the upcoming storm.
He would give it to Wufei when he went back to earth again, the Chinese man had almost nothing from his home and he knew that L5 mementos were usually only found on the black market, sold by fortune hunters and thieves. The Preventers had been able to shut down most of the rings, by Wufei's determination alone some days, and most of the items recovered were in a memorial museum in the capital of the New L5 settlement on earth. He'd kept nothing for himself and Duo knew that he would appreciate the gesture.
Gasps sounded from the hopefuls as they entered the main stable, a massive copse of trees whose canopy had grown together thick and impenetrable. Moths of varying sizes and colours milled along the forest floor and up the trees.
Stiles chuckled, sitting on the bed and watching as the normally broody, angry man adjusted fake wolf ears on his head. There was something meta about it.
James Potter and Sirius Black were sons of Lords and spoiled rotten, glutted on the fruits of other's labour and Lily was utterly distraught at the prospect of being his wife and the mother of his children.
Draco felt his eyes burn as he leaned heavily on the thick wooden railing of the ship. Partly to steady himself as it swayed on the rough waters, partly to keep his knees from buckling.
He started seeing a therapist, reluctantly at first, but after meeting with the woman recommended but both Seeley and Brenan, he'd made real progress. It was difficult, learning to trust someone with his truths and not trying to cover them with fake smiles and denial, but he pushed through the pain. He wanted, no, he needed to be a better man than he was. For both himself and his partner. He needed to discover who Anthony DiNozzo truly was.
Ronon had stayed on the city because Rodney had stayed. The rest of his team had stayed as well, though others came and went. He loved the rain personally. He loved the sound of it on the windows and along the piers. He loved how it looked on the slick grey metal of the city as well as how it blossomed into little yellow florets when it hit the activated shield.
Tony clenched his jaw and bit back on an acid retort. It wasn't worth it to argue. Not now. He'd been planning on doing that anyway. Turning back to his computer, he mentally set aside the small sealed evidence bag in his pocket.
He didn't mind, the sweet tech of his suit wasn't enough to deal with the blazing heat of the flames and he'd already sustained a couple of burns before the local fire chief had ordered him away from ground zero. The friendly neighbourhood hero had saluted the brave fire fighters in their heavy gear and had high tailed it out of there, almost falling off a building when his webbing got too close to the heat.
Ronon had been a bit confused but John had been patient in his explanations of the sexual spectrum. That kind of made all of Rondey's 'Kirk' complaints baseless but john said it gave him a chuckle to hear Rodney bitch about it.
He forced himself back to the situation at hand, taking a quick glance around the room. Despite it being so large, there were few people actually present. And all of them were wearing full body armor and face masks.
Teyla gave a small chuckle. "You actually have Rodney to thank for both of your survival. He not only found the secret ancient base that we had been looking for in the first place, but managed to manipulate the shielding into keeping the water out but expanded it upwards so that it breached the surface and allowed us to fly a jumper down the shaft and extract you."
“Please tell me that the ‘Dawn of the Wolf Trilogy’ is your brain child and that the three main protagonists are inspired by you me and Lydia. I fucking love that shit, dude!”
The tech was odd and faintly bio-luminescent and he delved head first into a study of it. His fingers worked nimbly, his sharp mind devouring the new and interesting hungrily. He feasted on learning, investigating, discovering. Glutted himself on satisfaction as he put the strange little thing back together. When it finally clicked its little legs together and blinked its little blue glow lights at him, he gave a soft, joyful laugh.
Anthony found himself huffing without even thinking about it, his lips twitching slightly before he could rule his face back to impassivity. Unfortunately, the blond had been looking at him intently and had caught the slip. Those stunning blue eyes brightened and that full mouth hitched smugly at the corners.
Fury sat forward. "You of all people know how important it is to swallow your pride and do what's right. Especially in times like these. We need you on this."
"I propose a co-ordinating concept instead. You in a black suit, expertly tailored. Black silk shirt with embroidered tie. Patent leather shoes. Platinum accessories. Do you have a set of tools in black and silver? Brushed velvet and leather."
They didn't get to spend much time together during that month, Rodney usually passing out whenever his head hit the pillow. Ronon didn't mind though, his lover and mate was protecting their home. He was working hard to protect their tribe.
He swallowed heavily against his nerves and turned around to lean against the tempered glass. There, that was a bit better. The common room looked bleached grey but there were little pops of colour, little signs of life that made the bands around his chest loosen. He took a sip of coffee and let his eyes drift over to the slumped figure in the chair, cup of coffee still untouched and steaming.
It had been a time of blood and ash. A time of countless bodies scorched and burning in the fields along the penumbra border. When the shadowed armies had finally been driven back into the dark, their strength and will all but broken, the Citadel had decreed it as a blessing from the Sun God himself. They were his chosen peoples and were entitled to all upon which his endless gaze fell.
He'd just taken up his cup to enjoy the rest of his tea when his father burst into the room, still in his dressing gown, long blond hair wild and uncombed. The man was livid, ranting about favouritism and how Sirius Black should be removed as Steed Master for letting a potential rider in with the steeds before the official Choosing Ceremony and that how he would have the man's job for this.
They manage to make small talk as they finished their coffees, catching up on years gone by. It’s only when they are settled down on the comfortable couch, the fireplace crackling happily; that Derek broached the subject they’d both been dancing around.
Rossi hummed with appreciation. "Black and white. Dark and light. Good and evil. Dom and sub. Poetic. I like it."
He purchased the waist trainer online and practiced wearing it a week before Halloween. It was tight and a bit uncomfortable but he got used to it. It also cinched his waist awesomely so it was worth it.
The man winked and leaned back as his partner made her way into the room beyond the small cell’s door, setting a crate down in the corner and coming up to stand next to her brother. She looked at Riddick with a frown.
“All of that will be dealt with accordingly Phoebus.” Soleil District’s Governor sat forward, her grey hair pinned in ringlets that fell around her shoulders. “What must be addressed now is the Penumbra threat. We have all underestimated the shadow lands and dismissed them as scattered bands of scavengers, lurking in the darkness beyond Sol’s blessed gaze. Now we now that they are more organized and much more of a threat to our way of life and the safety of our people.”
He visited his parents' graves the next day, laying a bundle of dried wild roses and sprigs of dried myrrh and meadowsweet. He would not visit them again. The boy who was their son was gone, leaving only the Witch.
"You rude little shit…."  Laura Hale stepped forward with a snarl, hey eyes glowing gold with a tint of red. The rest of the little groups seemed satisfied with keeping back. he counted a frowning Talia, her conniving shit of a brother Peter, the broodmiester that was her son Derek, the surly Cora and a couple other rando wolves. Then, his eye caught on a tall lanky form trying to hide behind the others and his lip curled derisively.
“You would welcome death if it meant killing us too?” The blond stumbled back, aghast. “You’ve signed your death warrant along with ours.”
None of the warriors would get the farewell they deserved, to be washed and rubbed with fragrant oil by their mourning loved ones and sent off to the hall of glory with their armor and shields, polished and gleaming.
The nucleus of ice and rock was dark amidst the devastatingly beautiful deadly cloud of gas that surrounded it. The Coma, as it was called, flashed and flared as it brushed against the upper atmosphere, sending terrifyingly heart stopping reactions skittering across the sky. The tail was a thing in itself, slithering behind like a living thing, colours twisting and merging continuously.
Spencer looked up from where he'd been studying the polished brass studs of his carrying case. The old man's cane tapped against the dark wood floor as he strolled towards the sitting area, the metal cap on the heavy carved wood walking stick, echoing sharply at every step.
He frowned as he checked around his quarters. Frowned as he checked the common room, the kitchen and the Gym. Frowned as he failed to see hide nor hair of the wonderfully soft and comfortable jacket.
He rolled his cotton stuffed head to look at where his mate slept, sprawled over the empty medical cot like a man exhausted. He was dressed in a set of scrubs, a laptop abandoned near his hand.
Kiba nosed his way down the blond's body, sucking and licking at the points that make his lover gasp and cry out. Naru's scent had changed from his time on the road. That milky sweet of youth had sharpened into a spicy richness that made the back of his mouth water. The kyuubi was closer to the surface, a smokey heat that mixed with the blond's sunlight and citrus.
'Well, listen to your so called gut on your own time, you hear me." Gibbs scoffed. "When you are on work you do as I say."
They stopped off at the uninhabited planet with a natural  hot springs, another of Ronon's addresses; and they bathed and made love in the healing waters.
Teyla was doing graceful strokes, the clear waters sluicing off her firm, naked body as she cut through the water. Ronon could see the holster of his knife, dark against his thigh and he ducked under the water a few times to get his locks wet through.
He felt a deep keening sort of disappointment. He’d let everybody down. He’d let Bucky down. He’d failed the mission they’d all worked so hard for. Sacrificed so much for.
“Not just yet I reckon. As I said, it’s not every day that a fella gets to meet THE Riddick… in the flesh.”
It started with an office fire in the warehouse district and way too soon had turned into several blocks of hell on earth. The FDNY were out in droves, trying to keep the blaze contained. The police were quickly evacuating the area and with the Avengers on their way with state of the art Stark Fire Suppression tech, Spiderman had been tasked with helping with the evacuation.
“I don’t think you have.” Derek flushed pink and sunk deeper into the cushions. “It’s more geared towards a younger target audience.”
Stiles quirked an eyebrow. "Are you kidding? Don't you know that power games are the best games? Just ask your precious Alpha. She'll tell you. She and Deaton are like two peas in a fucking pod when it comes to laying out some spectacular mind fucks. Don't bring your pity to this party, bitch. No one here gives a flying fuck."
The man in question was writing something into a large ledger, his stern mouth and stern jaw carved of stone. Spencer stood at the centre of the antique Prussian rug where Rossi directed him and waited patiently to be acknowledged. This was no place to demand attention.
There was an Athosian blanket laid out on the floor, a hand woven basket of food and a few bottles of the sweet juice made from some weird earth fruit called pineapple. It was one of Ronon's favorites and he always tried to keep a few bottles in the chiller in his room.
