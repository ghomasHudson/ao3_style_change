“This is the picture of you in my room after you got set on fire. I’m sorry about that by the way. I guess some natural force really didn’t want us to kiss that night. Little did they know, we’d be kissing plenty later on. Speaking of which, I don’t think I’ve ever told you that I have that picture you sent to me that night saved to my phone. I was crushing on you so bad, that I almost had a heart attack when I opened it.”
Cas nodded.
He had a feeling Sammy had picked up on things over the years. He’d joke with Dean about overcompensating, or about the idea of him having a relationship with Cas. Sam had never said anything negative toward him though, so maybe he would be okay with it.
“Ooo, he used my full name, this must be serious,” Cas joked.
Dean raises his eyebrows as Cas shows him how it works.
They sat down at a little booth and caught each other up on their lives. Dean ordered his typical burger with everything on it and a side of fries. He was hungry, and attacked the plate, barely stopping between bites.
That was until Cas grabbed a piece of licorice. The red twisted candy was one of Dean’s favorites. He supposed that’s why Cas picked it, but right now, he wanted nothing to do with it. Cas took a bite, before reaching over and holding it in front of Dean’s mouth. Cas wasn’t even looking at him, eyes focused on the film, he just assumed Dean would take a bite.
“Alright, let’s get you inside.”
Cas should’ve seen it coming, but he was naive and was surprised to find himself suddenly wrapped in Garth’s arms.
“Knowledge is knowing there is just as much to learn from your failures as there is from your successes.”
Charlie looked at Dean, a glimmer of mischief in her eyes. “What if there was a way where you could explore that side of yourself without it being a big deal?”
He saw what the world would look like without two crazy brothers who thought they could save it. A world without him. Overrun by monsters, filled with war of biblical proportions, yes, but he couldn’t help but think about who was still alive. The people he loved. The people his very existence put a death sentence on.
This time the butterflies flew in Cas’s stomach as Dean leaned in, the warmth of his breath and the smoke- a gentle caress as he inhaled. He closed his eyes again, thoughts racing with ideas he wished could be tangible.
Instead of dwelling on that, Cas chose to focus on the positive. The upside to, and also the best part of, being home was getting to see Dean. They had become best friends their senior year of high school, both finding comfort and support in each other. Cas even opted to go to a state school just so he could still see Dean on the weekends. He had researched the programs, and it was equally as good of a school as the one hundreds of miles away that he wanted to go to, and it was a fraction of the price. It was a win/win.
He could leave it there, but Cas has questions.
“Okay fine. I’ve been… questioning things a lot lately. I’ve realized that there are things in this life that I feel I’ve missed out on. There’s still so much out there that I want to experience, for the first time maybe, and it scares the shit out of me man.”
The three of them sat around the little wooden table and they gave Dean his presents. Considering he barely remembered it was his birthday himself, this was more than he could've asked for. Bobby got him a pack of baseball cards, and Sam got him a beat up baseball that he most likely found at a goodwill or in a park nearby.
Cas didn’t hear back, and his break was over, so he headed back to finish his shift. It was a blur of creamed corn and mashed potatoes until 3pm. He stayed an extra half hour to help clean up, then headed back home.
“Look…” Dean slid his hands into the pockets of his pants, keeping his eyes fixed on the floor. “Can we please pretend that this morning never happened?”
“Coke.”
“Thank you,” Cas said, placing his hand on Dean’s knee, gently running his thumb back and forth over the worn denim.
Dean sunk to the ground, sitting cross-legged in front of the graffiti-covered wall. “Come sit next to me, I have an idea.”
Dean shrugged his shoulders, “I don’t know. Your guess is as good as mine. I know that if I move more than a foot to either side, my stomach is ready to leave my body.”
“There,” Cas said, taking a step back. “Our summer is officially planned.”
“There may or may not be a meteor shower tonight,” Cas says, pulling the curtains back to reveal two huge windows.
Dean looked at him with a confused expression on his face. “Are you saying that you like me?”
“You know, Cas … I’m happy I’m here too.”
John found it and was furious. He stormed into the living room where Dean was watching TV. Sam had fallen asleep a few hours before.
He checked his phone, still no reply from Dean. He didn’t consider himself to be one of those people that expects instant replies, but he was kind of agitated that Dean couldn’t have given him a quick answer in the now 4 hours that had passed. On top of that, the message said it was read.
He wonders if whatever happens when you leave this life would be as warm and welcoming as his mother’s smile. But knowing his luck, he’d probably be met with endless dark. That’s what he deserves. He doesn’t matter on Earth, so why would he matter anywhere else? He could disappear right now, and it wouldn’t make a difference. What’s the point of trying to stay? Trying to hang on? At least if he’s in the ground, his body will nourish the earth. He’d be good for something.
“Dean, it’s fine. It happens. That’s just what the human body does.”
Before Dean can ponder the question further, Cas grabs a blanket off the back of the couch and drapes it over both of their laps. It’s soft and cozy.
He tried to get a summer job, but that didn’t happen because the two places that called him back didn’t want to hire a new person for only a couple of months. He figured he could find something else to occupy his time. After all, almost anything would be better than his father yelling at him and his mother passive aggressively praying for him at the dinner table every night.
“What do you mean?”
Cas: “
“That ok?” Dean asked, dabbing as gently as he could over the inflamed skin.
“What’s wrong?”
And that’s when Dean jumps, breaking himself out of his indulgent reverie, startling Cas and himself with the motion.
Sam shook his head. It had been a bust. Cas tried to pretend his heart didn’t sink, but it was no use.
“Shut your mouth and eat your leaves, salad boy.” Dean shot back, mouth full of ground beef. He knew Sam was joking, but some part of him took it at face value.
“Honey, what’s going on with you?”
“Guess I just wanted to get my hands dirty. Make something out of nothing. Can’t say I’ve done too much of that these days though.”
“It’s the biggest dinner of my life.”
“Dean? Is everything okay?”
“No, but they just bloomed the other day. Beautiful, aren’t they? They’re my favorite.”
“Okay.” Cas was still nervous, but with Dean’s hands on his, he felt safe. He could do this.
Dean hummed to himself, trying to remain patient. He didn’t think he could handle more than another week of this. Every morning the same sleepy smile greeting him, every morning the same honest surprise, every morning his heart swelling with hope only to be rung dry before the coffee was done.
“What are you doing, Cas?” Dean said dryly.
Mrs. Novak was in his corner, turning a blind eye to logic, and embracing the idea that a miracle would happen and Cas would be ok. They had about 12 hours to wait it out, and they all waited. Dean and Mrs. Novak stayed in the room the entire time. Mr. Novak and the rest of his children chose to sit in the waiting room. Cas’s room was small, and it got uncomfortable with all of them in there. Besides, it was difficult enough to get a bunch of young kids to sit still, never mind keeping them busy in a boring hospital. At least in the waiting room, they could walk around, and they could get snacks from the vending machines.
“Okay. Take your time.”
“Do you think it was something you ate?”
Cas types up a short text, explaining that it was him and that he got Dean’s number from his work computer, and that he just wanted to make sure he was okay. He was hoping Dean would be willing to overlook the creepy implications of Cas getting his phone number like that and instead see that he’s just worried about him.
Dean opened the door, wiping his mouth on the back of his sleeve.
“What? It seemed like the kind of project for large paper. You have to be able to visualize your goals if you want to achieve them, Dean.”
Thinking maybe he was in the bathroom or went to get a glass of water, Cas searches his entire apartment, only to find it empty.
Dean was possessed by an archangel, an archangel who wanted to destroy the world, no less, you’d think there’d be a trail of destruction to follow. But here they were, searching for clues in the calm before the storm, and coming up empty handed.
It was Cas. Of course it was Cas, because Dean could never be self destructive in secret. Someone had to find out. He could maybe play it off. It wasn’t too late.
Cas put little captions under each picture, featuring the date and a blurb about what was happening that day. It was like having a physical Instagram, but so much better. This one he got to create with Dean.
Dean was right. Nothing about the past hour had been subtle. Cas paid for their food and won him a jumbo stuffed animal, it may as well have been a date. Cas contemplated his next move, wondering how he was going to deal with the romantic implications of the day.
“What did I do to deserve all this?”
Cas was rubbing Dean’s stomach, and stroking his hair, getting lost in the moment.
Dean poured the liquid in the grass then went back to the picnic table to get Cas a new drink. Charlie ran up to him, excited for an update.
Dean turns slowly to see Cas walking over to him. “I’ve already made a fool of myself, I should go home.”
But he knew that wouldn’t happen.
A soft voice called from the other side of the room. Dean lifted his head, to see Cas, messy haired and sleepy, checking in on him.
That was a good suggestion. Cas opened the camera app and scanned the room for something he could set his phone on. All the surfaces were too short, he wouldn’t be able to get everything in the shot. Then Cas remembered his brother got a selfie stick for Christmas.
Cas rubbed his hand in small circles, slow and easy, whispering “I got you” in Dean’s ear. Cas’s hand was glowing lightly beneath the covers as he began to heal Dean.
Dean believed him. He knew Cas loved him, and he knew he had to try. He was scared though that instead of getting better, he would only get better at hiding his behavior.
“This was a one time thing,” Dean thought to himself. He didn’t know how wrong he was.
Dean turned his head, drawing Cas’s focus back to those beautiful green eyes. Those eyes, that were usually so tired, now aglow with joy. To Cas, that was magic. At that moment, it didn’t matter what anyone else in the room thought because he was able to make Dean smile.
To stay. It sounds so simple, but everyone knows, life is never that simple. What earth would need to be moved to make space for him? What soil would he poison by sinking his roots down deep? Would the world not benefit from him being far from its tortured atmosphere?
“So, you scrape out some weird goop from the vines?”
Dean raised an eyebrow, not even answering before grabbing Cas’s hand and heading over to the table. That was one of the things Cas loved about Dean, he was super competitive.
worthy of love.”
Dean sat down at the table, his back to Cas.
|~~~*****~~~|
Cas joined him on the ground, too drunk to care that the ground was sticky and covered in spilled alcohol.
“I don’t deserve you.”
A soft crescendo of strings came through the speaker as Cas walked down the aisle. This was the happiest day of Dean’s entire life, and he remembered it well enough for the both of them.
It goes against every code of ethics, but Cas doesn’t have any other option. He pulls up Dean’s information in their system of visitors and gets both a phone number and an address. He knows he shouldn’t violate someone’s privacy like this, but what if Dean is hurt? He just wants to make sure he’s okay.
Luckily, they can still purify the water so it’s safe to drink, but the air is an entirely different beast. The gas masks help to reduce exposure, but there are so many people who don’t believe they work. They think whatever this gas is, they’ll build up immunity to it. It’s stupid.
“Now be a good boy, and stay.”
“I want to show you something.” Cas grabs Dean’s hand and leads him to a room down the hall. He opens the door, and turns on the lights.
“No, Dean.” Cas took a couple steps forward so he was standing face to face with the other man. “I
Fucking Castiel. Angel of the Lord who gripped him tight, pulled him from the depths of Hell. And for what? This? To watch Dean destroy the world? To be killed.
“And what about you?”
Even though he thought it was stupid, Dean linked his pinky finger with Cas’s. If it meant something to Cas, then it meant something to him.
Dean walked to the other side of the table, taking Cas’s hands into his own, asking him to stand. Cas’s eyes went wide, like he realized what was about to happen. Dean’s hands were shaking, and his knees were ready to give out. He took a deep breath, trying to steady himself for what he was about to do.
“Is it off me? Is it gone?”
He locked the door and turned on the shower. He just needed a moment to clear his head and calm his body down.
Charlie let out a disappointed sigh, “You were supposed to say ‘I’m going to Disney World!’”
“Yes, sir.” Dean nodded, wiping the blood from the corner of his lip before running off to the bathroom. He lifted his shirt, seeing the raw skin and blood reflected in the mirror. In that moment, he swore that he would never let this part of himself surface again. He made a vow to keep it buried alongside everything else he had repressed over the years.
“Alright, I’ll be back soon.”
“I don’t. I was hoping to take over my Uncle Bobby’s auto shop. He always said I had a gift when it came to cars.”
“It’s not your fault. I’ve been living these same couple of days with you for weeks. Every morning you wake up, and you’re surprised that I made you pancakes. Every morning you sit across the table from me, as if it were the first time. And every morning my heart sinks.”
“No,” he lies again.
As the end credits rolled, Cas gently put the blanket over Dean and cleaned up. He seemed so peaceful, which he seldom was. The nightmares often disrupted his sleep, but in that moment, he was at ease. Comfortable. Unguarded.
Dean clicks on another, and it plays a series of almost hypnotic looping graphics, all of which have the worst quality. It looks like it may have been added by mistake.
Dean placed a kiss to Cas’s forehead. “I can’t wait until you come back to me.”
He could feel his body twitch. Fighting for him to live. Lungs gasping in his chest, face flushed and eyes bulging.
“Hey, Charlie.” Dean reached up, pulling her hands down.
“Well, I’m 18, and in his eyes, and in the eyes of the law, that’s an adult, so I don’t have much of a choice here.”
Dean set the phone down, and held Cas’s hands. Even now, they were shaking. Dean had spent his life looking for the better half of his soul, and here he was, oblivious to all of it.
“Why didn’t you just go in the store and buy something then?”
Cas’s stomach turned at the smirk that spread across Michael’s face. While it wasn’t truly Dean, those hateful words were coming from his body, with his voice. It was torture.
Dean placed a kiss on Cas's forehead and pulled him in close. “Awesome.”
Dean eyes were filled with terror, and shock, and hope. He could feel the warmth of Cas’s breathe against his chin.
“Where would you like to be? Anywhere in the world, just name it,” Cas said taking back the phone and opening up the search tab.
“Oh, we’re not...” The sentiment had taken Cas by surprise. “This is only our first date.”
Nothing was right. The world felt empty and Dean felt depleted. Sam did everything he could to try to get through to his brother. Dean only left the room at odd hours of the morning to use the bathroom and that was it. Sam would leave trays of food and water outside the door, which would be missing on every third trip or so to check on Dean.
“So what? I’m doing what I have to do.”
This was nothing like any other kiss Dean had ever experienced. This was so soft, and light. A gentle caress. There was no pain, no hatred, no rage behind it. This was pure love. This was more than a quick hook up or something to numb his past. This was different, and so, so, good.
For a moment Dean hoped Cas would laugh, but he was met with nothing but the familiar silence.
Dean almost forgot about the next photos.
“Okay, so I’m gonna take a hit, then when I exhale, you inhale the smoke.”
Dean noticed that Cas didn’t seem okay, so he reached over, and grabbed Cas’s hand. “I’m not gonna let you go, okay? I got you.”
“Here.” Cas grabs the remote and hits the home button, thankfully silencing the recommendation.
Cas was instantly filled with disappointment. He wasn’t sure what he expected to happen, but he hoped it would be different than this.
But Dean didn’t live in a perfect world. And Cas still didn’t wake up.
was this happy.
Dean nodded, “Yeah, I do.”
Cas’s first thought is to text him, but they never exchanged phone numbers. He doesn’t use any social media, so that wouldn’t be of much help. It’s like a modern-dystopian Cinderella. Except Dean didn’t leave a shoe behind, and Cas doesn’t fancy himself much of a prince charming.
“It’s okay. I accounted for that. Plus, I would've just listened to music in my car until you got here.” She flashed an exaggerated smile at Dean. “Do I have lipstick on my teeth?”
“I am.”
“Only that one sip of what you poured me, but that’s not the point. It’s just…” Cas placed his hand on Dean’s cheek. Turns out he was shaking too. “Maybe I’m a little disappointed that we…”
“I guess it is getting pretty late,” Cas said.
When Dean told him to leave the door open, Sam insisted that they were just friends, and that they were going to watch YouTube videos together. Dean left it at that. If young love happened to bloom between them, then so be it, but he didn’t want to push the subject.
“That we didn’t get to kiss.” Cas’s eyes shifted down, staring at Dean’s lips.
“I got something!” Sam shouted from down the hall. His voice sounded like an answer to a prayer.
“Then I’d let you.” Cas winks at Dean before turning his attention back to the movie.
“Well thank you. That’s very thoughtful. Come in.” Cas places the flowers in a vase as Dean gets comfortable on the couch. He gets both of them a glass of water before joining Dean in the living room. “So, what did you want to talk about?”
Cas discovered the flowers last year, and he considers it a great accomplishment. When dried up and brewed into tea, the drink has been shown to counteract stomach singe. While rare, people were dying from holes being burned through their stomach, and thanks to Cas, doctors were able to lower the death rate.
After work, Dean makes a quick call to Sam, just to check in. Now that Sam has finally forgiven him for not telling him about the Moon Colony thing, they’re back on speaking terms. Dean wasn’t really worried though. Sam was never good at holding a grudge.
“We may have to do that again,” Cas said, referring to both the ride and the hug, but Dean didn’t have to know that.
“That couldn’t be? Could it?” Cas thought to himself. He carefully slid his arm from underneath Dean’s and reached back. He paused, his hand hovering in the air, reconsidering if he actually wanted the answer to his questions. He did.
Cas smiles and shows Dean how to change the channels and adjust the volume. How to get the TV to switch to hologram mode and virtual reality mode. It’s super advanced technology.
Despite Dean’s objections, Cas made sure he was taken care of. Cas just wanted to help, but Dean didn’t like being coddled. Still, Cas meant well, so Dean sucked it up and let Cas baby him.
Dean’s body was on auto-pilot the whole drive home. The constant feeling of shame and nausea kept his mind occupied. He almost drove past the house, turning into the driveway at the last second.
“See. You’re not the only one who can pull off some serious rom-com bullshit.” He said, setting the phone on the table in the corner and returning his attention to the scrapbook.
If you listened closely, you could hear Dean’s heart strings snap. Those were the words he dreaded the most. He didn’t know what else to do, so he just let it pour out of him.
“No, don’t make everyone go home because of me.”
The room felt too hot and his face was flushed. He swallowed the lump in his throat, thinking about any way he could distract himself from his very attractive and very naked friend standing in his doorway.
Over the past year, Dean and Cas had their fair share of arguments and misunderstandings, and Dean was sure that this was the result of the latter.
It would’ve seemed weird, but Dean had lots of little sticky notes around the house. Ones on the light switches that read: “Light: On/Off,” ones on the sink that read: “Water: Left- Hot, Right- Cold.” He just assumed Dean had a very particular way of keeping things organized.
Cas stopped moving his hand, shocked by what he let slip out of his mouth. He wasn’t supposed to say that. This was Dean. Dean who wanted boundaries. Dean who wanted personal space. Dean who Cas had to try so hard to hide his very obvious feelings from.
“Great, so can I get you a refill or some pizza?”
Cas sat up and turned off the television. “Why does he always have to sacrifice himself like this? Does he not see how important he is to us? I love him. You and Mary, even Jack loves him! Yet he’s so quick to leave us all behind.”
Dean stuck his tongue out as he stood up, dusting off his pants. He lined his golf club up next to the neon green ball and gave a couple practice strokes. He took a deep breath, steadying his grip. He lifted the club, ready to swing, when a scream cut through his focus.
Dean was getting desperate. His college move in date was in three days, and he wasn’t able to devote any of his attention to packing or getting school supplies. He considered calling the school and asking if he could start in the Spring instead, but after a conversation with Anael, he decided against it. She said that Cas would want him to go. He wouldn’t want Dean to put his life on hold for him.
“Oh, just kiss already!” Charlie shouted.
~~~~~*****~~~~~
Well, Dean actually did draw the line at being a stripper. He couldn’t dance, and if John found out, he’d be dead. Sure the money would probably be good, but he wasn’t ready to commit to a life of sex work.
“Is it ok if I borrow the outfit?”
In that moment, all the negative thoughts that had been haunting Dean were silenced. He felt a sense of peace wash over him. This felt right. It felt like home.
“I don’t know, Dean. Maybe it’s the fact that this is a swinging death machine. What if the safety belts come loose? What if the hinge breaks and it sends all of us crashing down to our deaths?”
Dean let out a defeated sigh. He was so close.
Cas considered the point. It would be something he’d never done before, and if all the people before him could ride the ride and be okay, then maybe he would be too.
Cas could hear the heaving and flushing through the door. He knew Dean was not going to be okay, and that it was going to be a long night.
It’s nothing like the outside world. Out there, the sky is rusted, the air is smog, and the trees have been reduced to rotting bones. There hasn’t been a patch of grass on a front lawn in a decade. It almost feels like none of that was real. Never could have been real. Like when you look at pictures of dinosaurs, and you know that they existed, but you just can’t imagine them being real. Tangible.
“This is the last one. Cashier at the Gas N’ Sip.”
About 30 minutes in, Dean pulled into a gas station to fill up the tank and grab a drink.
As he scrolled through Instagram, he saw a picture Cas took of some fancy breakfast from the bistro downtown. The caption read “Quality time with me, myself and I. #ICanDoBadAllByMyself”
“I’m really missing you today. It’s the anniversary of my mom’s death. I wish more than anything that you were here.” Dean tried his best not to cry. “She loved this song, or at least that’s what Dad says. And I’ve told you before, but I want to tell you every day, that I love you. You make my life brighter. You’re the sunlight.”
After rinsing the dishes, Cas makes a big bowl of popcorn and suggests they watch a movie. Dean is game, as long as there’s extra butter on the popcorn.
“What are you doing up, Cas?” Dean asked.
All of a sudden it felt like his insides were on fire. He was afraid that one of his organs had ruptured and that he was bleeding internally. Everything felt bad.
Dean looked at her with wide eyes. Spin the bottle? Really? Out of all the dumb ideas Charlie could’ve come up with, she picked the option where his mouth could potentially be on the mouth of his best friend? Even more awkward, he could end up kissing one of his coworkers, and that could lead to some uncomfortable shifts in the future.
“Could you stop?”
It was about three films and two bags of popcorn later when Sam came back. He was happy to see Cas had left Dean’s room.
“I think I’m in love with you?” Cas whispered. It came out as more of a question than a statement. As if he was slowly coming to a realization.
Dean’s hand found it’s way into Cas’s hair, pulling lightly. Dean wanted so much more. He wanted to live the rest of his life in this moment.
“It was your idea, so have at it.” Dean slouched in his chair, overly defensive considering the situation, but in all fairness, he was terrified. He didn’t want to admit that he had a crush on Cas. He preferred to think of what they had as a strong connection. A more profound bond, if you will, than he had with his other friends. They were close. And maybe, somewhere deep down, he’d like to be closer, but that was unexplored terrain. Cas was one of the best things that ever happened to him, and what if all of that got ruined? Hell, he didn’t even know what Cas’s sexual orientation was. They never had the discussion. This was a bad idea.
“I’d have more fun eating my own fingers.”
He bit into his lip so hard it bled. The copper taste of blood stained his taste buds. Pain was the only thing Dean felt worthy of. He knew he was worthless. Knew he would never accomplish any good in this world.
“Heya, Cas! What are you up to today?”
Dean could see and hear everything that was happening, but there was nothing he could do about it. Michael was too strong. He couldn’t cast him out. He just had to sit there, staring at his friend whose face was beaming with hurt and betrayal. He wanted to tell Cas it wasn’t true. Wanted to tell him how much he cared for him, how much he needed him. But he couldn’t.
“This moment would make an excellent closing photo for our scrapbook,” Cas said, pulling Dean close to him.
“Hey, listen,” Dean said, taking hold of Cas’s hands. “There was never any girl.”
He rolled over on his side, pulling the covers over his head, and tried to fall asleep. He hoped the night would be dreamless, because either way, he didn’t want to deal with this.
doing up?”
Cas loosened Dean’s tie, his fingers brushing against Dean’s skin. His touch was hot, but feather light.
“That we what?” Dean was searching his eyes for some kind of sign that he was reading this correctly. He felt like he had a pretty good idea about where Cas was heading with this, but he wouldn’t know until Cas said something. His heart was ready to burst as he waited for an answer.
He locked the door and dropped to his knees, confused as to how he could be feeling nauseated if he hadn’t eaten anything since he puked earlier. Then he remembered: the laxatives.
After that, he was an entirely different person. He was finally the kind of dad that Dean could be proud of.
“Babe, I hope you’re hungry. I’m making chicken parm.” Cas scoops up a spoon full of tomato sauce and runs over to Dean. “You have to taste this. It’s amazing.”
“We’re married.”
Dean pulled out his phone and checked the time. It was already 10pm.
That familiar feeling of guilt began to settle in Dean’s stomach. He couldn’t believe how much he had eaten. He was beginning to panic, he couldn’t let it stay in his body. He made a mistake and he had to make it right.
“I just miss you so much,” he said, defeated.
Oh no.
He slammed the door shut, huffing and shaking his head.
“What are we going to tell him?” Cas asked.
Cas pulled the chair in the corner up next to the bed and sat down. There was a moment of silence as Dean looked over the card. The room was still, except for the background murmur of the TV and the chatter down the hall.
As a guest of honor, they had John carve the turkey. Dean almost couldn’t believe it, it felt like a scene from a movie. John finally had some light back in his eyes, Cas was sitting across the table from him, Sam was getting along with Cas’s brothers, Charlie was there to share in the merriment. It was almost too good to be true.
“I know you may not think it,” Cas said, kissing the tips of Dean’s fingers, “but you
“After today, I need it.” He tossed it back, and could feel the liquor burn his throat.
He tried to come to terms with this. Tried to accept it. But the more it raced around his head, the more he realized that everything he touched got ruined. Sam would be better off without him. He always has been. He took down the British Men Of Letters without his help, just imagine the good he could do without his worthless brother holding him back.
He swiped through the pictures, asking Cas if any of it was coming back to him. He shook his head, no.
“You bet. Then again, maybe we should wait to start a new scrapbook until after we have kids.”
Dean and Garth were laughing, and for a second Cas thought they were making fun of him, but after a quick pat on the back, and some encouragement that “that’ll happen if you’re not used to it,” he realized everyone was just having a good time and making light of the situation.
“Luckily the doctors said you’re just dehydrated. Couple rounds of IVs and you should be alright.”
Their lips were impossibly close when Dean let the gentle stream of smoke flow from his mouth to Cas’s. It was a lot easier than smoking it straight. It didn’t burn as much. Cas closed his eyes and let the high wash over him as he held his breath. He felt calm, a moment of peace away from the chaos of the outside world. He exhaled and opened his eyes, finding Dean’s a few inches from his face.
So Dean chugged the rest of his drink, hoping a little liquid courage would pull him through. He wiped his mouth on the back of his sleeve and walked over to where Cas was sitting.
“Listen. This is a lot. So, give me a little time to consider everything. Okay?”
He was still in a bad mood when he got home.
When they pulled apart, Cas kept his eyes closed, lingering in the moment. As he opened his eyes, he saw Dean biting his lip with a smirk. It was all so perfect.
~     ~     ~
“No.” Cas was sure his eyes were ridiculously wide. On what planet would he assume that? Dean didn’t talk much about his sexuality, but Cas never would’ve figured he’d be his type. Not that he was complaining.
“I’ll be right back,” Dean said, untangling himself from Castiel’s arms.
Charlie was right. Cas was a very understanding person, and it wasn’t like this was their first fight. They always found a way to kiss and make up, so to speak.
He notices the framed photo on Cas’s bedside table. It’s a woman looking down at a new born baby who has their hand wrapped around her finger. That must be Cas’s mom. She’s beautiful. He can tell where Cas gets his smile from.
Dean rolled his eyes. “Really?”
“It’s climbing up your back!”
“What?” Dean asked, waiting for some kind of follow up explanation. He looked down, and noticed the crumpled up, and also empty, potato chip bag in Cas’s lap. “Did you eat my chips?”
“Yeah? I figured that would take some convincing seeing as you are not a party hosting type of guy.”
“Nothing, just tired.”
Dean’s little heart melted at the gesture. He went with a rom-com that he knew was also one of Cas’s favorites. They cuddled under the blankets, side by side, Dean with his arm around Cas’s shoulder.
“You don’t have to if you don’t want to,” Dean said, making sure Cas didn’t feel pressured.
“It’s a gift, for you. Just a little something that I thought would boost your spirits.” Cas brought his hand forward, revealing a bouquet of flowers and a construction paper card. “My students asked why I looked so sad today, and I told them that you were sick and that I was worried about you, so they insisted that we all make you a “Get Well Soon” card.”
“And what about your happiness? What about your future? What about the people who care about you and want you to have a good life?”
Kevin was up next. He spun, and as the bottle came to a halt, he was filled with disappointment.
Sam fills Dean in on what’s been going on in his life. He’s doing well. Turns out, there’s this cute girl who works with him and he finally got the courage to ask her out. Her name is Eileen, and Sam has said himself that she’s intimidating because she’s smarter than him. Dean thinks that’s a good thing, because he could use someone to keep him in check. Most importantly though, Sam is happy, and living his best life.
Dean was quick to point out that they still had a chance at rebuttal, but unfortunately, they missed those shots too, so Charlie and Dorothy won.
And here he is, sitting at his dining room table, eating this makeshift meal Cas threw together, and he’s not complaining. He’s just slurping up the noodles, and smiling between bites as the corners of his lips lift his freckled cheeks, and he’s looking back at him with those beautiful, indescribable eyes and…
He looked in the kitchen and the bathroom before checking Cas’s room. All Empty.
Dean went back to the bathroom and changed. When he came back, he could barely look at Cas. He felt terrible about the situation, even though he didn’t have much control over it. Cas had made it clear that he didn’t feel that way about him, so he could only imagine what he must be thinking. He already fucked up so much in the past couple days, this was truly the icing on the cake. He hoped they could at least still be friends.
For Dean, this was a chance to make decisions for himself, and for Cas, this was an opportunity to make lasting memories with his best friend. They were both ready for the chaos to begin.
Yawning, Dean rubbed the sleep from his eyes, stretching his arms over his head. He brushed his teeth and took a quick shower, before throwing on some jeans and a button down shirt. He wanted to look nice, but casual. He knew most places that would consider hiring him probably wouldn’t care much about his appearance, but first impressions are important.
Cas puts on his gasmask and walks to the lobby to greet his arrivals. The glass doors slide open, and in comes an eclectic crew. It’s a mix of humans, here to tour the garden, Intergalactic Mail drones, here to pick up orders being shipped to foreign planets, and Space Marshals, here to pick up orders for the moon colony.
“I don’t think your father has ever been qualified to speak on what is acceptable.”
“You um… my shirt fits you well.”
“Do you want to talk about it?” Cas asked, pulling a seat up next to Dean at the table.
“You’re kidding me, right?” Cas looked up as the ride swung into motion, the people screaming as they were sent into the air and were hanging upside down.
“Because you blinked.” He showed the photo to Dean and sure enough, there he was, mid-blink. He looked stoned.
“Did you find anything? Any word from him?”
They opened the door and were greeted by a cloud of smoke. It seemed fitting. There were some old speakers set up in the corner that were no doubt playing someone’s Spotify playlist. That was confirmed when a 30 second ad played at full volume.
“I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have… I have to go.” Dean stands up and makes a b-line towards the door. His feet moving with a vengeance to get himself out of that apartment and away from the unfamiliar feeling of sympathy. Away from the man whose life he feels he’s intruding upon. Bringing his problems to a near-stranger’s doorstep and expecting him to care. Who is he to think he can do that? Who is he to think he’s worthy of that?
“I don’t actually know how to say this, so I’m just going to be honest.” Cas kept his eyes fixed on the space between them, as he bounced his leg out of nervousness. “You make me feel things that I can’t even begin to describe. And when I’m around you, my heart races, and I can’t stop smiling, and my knees get weak, and all that other mushy stuff that I know you hate. I didn’t want to say anything because I was too afraid of losing you, but if I didn’t tell you the truth, I was going to explode.”
“I’m so sorry, Dean.”
Dean hadn’t seen the picture before. He didn’t even know Cas had took the picture. It was a little dark, but it was during the finale of the fireworks, Sam was looking over his shoulder at Dean, pointing as his favorite firework went off.
“Well, we have plenty of time.”
“I know that I love women, there’s no doubt in my mind about that... but hell, if I don’t love you too.”
Cas had kissed a handful of people before this, but they had nothing on Dean. Dean kissed him like he was something precious, something valuable, something to be loved, and he had never felt like that before.
“No. You’ve been through enough today as it is, and I don’t want you here if John’s in one of his moods. It’d probably be best for you to go home.” Dean would be lying if he said it didn’t punch him in the gut to see the look of hurt that washed over Cas’s face.
“No,” Cas laughs, “I did always have a fascination with nature though. When I was maybe seven or eight, I wanted to be a beekeeper.”
Saturday rolled around and as dusk cast it’s foggy shadow over the town, Dean was out back, scouring the edge of his backyard for firewood. He bribed Sam to leave him alone for the evening by saying he could also have a friend over.
Cas looked like the sun personified, radiating joy, with a smile wide as an ocean’s horizon. Dean was never more prepared to spend eternity amongst waves. When they said “I do,” Dean’s pulse was racing. You could see his hands shaking in the video, but Cas was there with him, equally as excited and terrified as he was.
“Do I have something on my face?” Dean asks, eyebrow raised, as he reaches for his napkin.
There were what felt like a thousand feelings bombarding him in that moment. He was trying to remember words. Nothing was coming out of his mouth, and Cas was looking at him expectantly.
“What?”
“Yeah, maybe for you.” Dean rolled down his window. “I have the pleasure of air drying like a dog, and I’m gonna have to put my phone in a bowl of rice when I get home.”
Dean was looking at Cas like he rose the mountains from the earth, his whole face lit up and enchanted. Cas couldn’t quite figure out why he was being treated so well by someone he barely knew.
Cas grabbed the supplies, and they worked together to get the scrapbook started. Dean ended up enjoying it more than he initially thought he would. Cas gave him free range with the stickers, and let’s just say, nearly all the pages featured pizza and alien heads.
“Don’t you fucking lie to me, boy. It ain’t Sam’s and it sure as hell ain’t mine.” John cracked the belt in his hand, causing Dean to flinch.
“This is great. Thank you.”
“What did you do now?”
“Alright. You hop in the shower, get cleaned up, and I’ll find you some clothes you can wear.” They were similar in size, though Dean was a bit taller. They tended not to share clothes because they had very different styles, but given the circumstances, style probably wouldn’t be  Cas’s biggest concern.
He and Sam finish up at the graveyard and get back in the Impala. “I hate to say it, Dean,” Sam starts.
Dean sobers at that, trying very hard not to look over at Sam who’s no doubt watching his reaction. “What did you just say?”
“Hmm…” Sam comments when no ghosts appear. “Maybe they still need to be summoned by music to manifest.”
“Do you think it was just that first time, or do you think if we play it they’ll zoom over here?”
Dean smiles sadly at Sam. He wishes desperately that he could share the burden of his knowledge with him. Instead, he wills himself to be content with the time he has left with his brother and the knowledge that Cas is patiently awaiting him on the other side. It’s more than he thought he’d ever get. “With any luck.”
“Yeah yeah,” Dean responds. “Fuck off if you don’t wanna be scarred for life.”
“This isn’t funny,” Cas forces through his teeth, looking like he can’t decide whether to yell or cry.
to Dean, because you get so unbearably defensive about it, and someone had to explain to C—” Throughout this entire rant, Sam has been getting steadily less teasing and more chastising, and it seems to surprise him just how heated he’s been getting about it because he quickly cuts himself off before he can say something he’ll really regret. But he didn’t stop himself fast enough, because Dean can finish that sentence in his sleep. ‘Someone had to explain to Cas why the man he loved couldn’t get over himself long enough to treat him right.’ “Wow, uhhh, sorry, I think I got a little carried away.”
“FINALLY!” the Shadow bellows. “Can we please go the fuck to sleep now?”
Now this Dean knew how to do. “Well, I could start by getting in your space a bit.”
“It’s work I enjoy, or rather it’s important to me. I would prefer a longer timescale on which to complete it, but we’ve sworn not to interfere.”
“She kept that?” Trevor seems pleasantly surprised by this development. “Reggie gave that to her.”
At some point, Dean says to him, “I've had more fun with you in the last 24 hours than I've had with Sam the past few years.” While Castiel can’t say he’s ever had ‘fun’ with Lucifer’s destined vessel, he can certainly agree with the sentiment that the past 24 hours have been considerably better than most of the other days the angel has experienced on Earth since resurrecting the man beside him. It occurs to him that since he will surely not survive whatever comes next, there’s really no harm in imagining that perhaps Dean’s affections towards him aren’t strictly utilitarian. He would never presume to assert that Dean in any way felt towards him the same immeasurable love that Castiel harbors, but he wonders at how much more amicable their relationship is now than it was when Dean’s first instinct was to shoot him, then stab him. And in the astronomically unlikely event that Castiel does get more days with Dean, he would love the chance to continue fostering this… perhaps friendship is the appropriate term. If he is to be a fallen angel, then he shall make it his goal that Dean, the man he fell for, will keep that smile on his face for the rest of his Earthly life.
Sam looks at him with an unimpressed eyebrow. “Okay…” Sam seems to expect him to continue. “Was that in question?”
to reject him. Knew there was virtually no coming back from the Empty and he’d never have to face the aftermath of what he said. That sneaky son of a bitch.
“Fine, old-fashioned way it is.” Thankfully he’s rescued from having to page too far through the lore by a text notification on Sam’s phone.
Cas furrows his eyebrows a moment then laughs when the implication becomes clear. “If you say so.”
“Hmm… do we know if Violet or Jessica are still around?”
Julie stands. “Guys, I don’t think your unfinished business was getting back at him. I think it might actually be moving forward. I mean, we know forming the band was part of it, so maybe we need the full band together.”
“Okay.” He hears a poof through the phone and then the line goes dead, which tells him Alex is no longer next to him. He’s really getting tired of people ending conversations like that.
“Sammy if you even think about saying I should give up, I swear to God—”
“What the hell were you thinking,” he whispers into his shoulder.
“You too Dean. Take care of yourself.”
“Yeah well Cas is a self-deprecating asshole and I’ll be damned if he spends eternity thinking I…” Dean trails off, unsure exactly how to say what he needs to say, which he should probably figure out before he tries saying it to Cas himself. But he deserves to hear it first. “He has to know.”
Dean stopped in his tracks. “Seriously? You had me drive an hour to an amusement park so you can ride the Ferris wheel? I don’t think so.”
“I’m not…Dad...I’m sorry. I am so sorry. I’ll stop. I promise. I’ll be a good son. Nothing like this will ever happen again. P-please, just stop.” Dean was trying to hold back his tears, not wanting his father to see him as being any more weak than he already had.
“Oh no.” Cas sets his water on the table. “Are you about to break up with me before we’re even a couple?”
“I’m so sorry.”
“Dean, you’re in pain, let me help.” Cas leaned over so that he was cradling Dean in his arms.
“He told me I was supposed to be the man of the house. I had to be a father figure to Sammy. I couldn’t…” Dean took another sip of his drink. “I’m not supposed to feel this way, okay? I thought, as I got older, it would go away. It was just some phase or whatever they tell you when you’re a teenager. But it never went away. And now that times have changed and people are more accepting, I thought maybe I could convince myself to be honest about everything, but I can’t. John’s voice is still in the back of my head. The fear he put in my heart is still there.”
“Maybe it’s the sunset, or the lack of oxygen up here, but I’m gonna go out on a limb and say what I feel, too.” Dean fiddled with the loose string on his shirt. “You like me, and I like you, so what do you say we make this thing official?”
So he took a breath, and suddenly he was telling Dean all of his secrets. He told him about the deal, about how he knew the one thing he wanted was something he couldn't have, how Dean wasn’t an angry shell of a man, but a loving one.
“So, what did you wish for?” Dean asks.
“What were you talking about?” Cas had a slew of emotions coursing through his body. Fear and confusion being the main ones.
When they finally arrived, the place was packed. They had to park way in the back and hike to the actual park, but it was worth it when they got there. There were food vendors everywhere, music blasting, kids screaming as rides swung them through the air. It was wonderful.
They paid for the full 18 holes. Cas was excited, as this was one of the few sports that he excelled at. Dean liked to tease him about it, but he wouldn’t be laughing after Cas whooped his ass up and down the course.
About 10 minutes in, Cas realized he was the only one enjoying the snacks.
Sam invited over a sweet girl named Eileen. They met in sign language club, because that is the most Sam place to meet a girl. Dean didn’t even know that club was offered at the school, if he didn’t know any better, he’d guess that Sam was the one who founded it. Either way, Dean liked Eileen, she was smart and seemed nice, and wasn’t afraid to crack a couple jokes. Exactly the kind of person he’d want his brother to end up with.
“I like you a lot.”
As they eat, they go back and forth sharing interests and telling stories. Cas has plenty about his failed plant experiments, but Dean wants to hear the one about the time he almost blew up the Biodome.
The room was quiet. Cas’s family had visited earlier that day, Mr. Novak finally getting through to them that they couldn’t spend every waking moment in the hospital, they had to continue living their lives. It was just Dean and Cas.
The evening was going well, they got past the round where you have to hit the ball into a windmill, and the one where you have to get it into the clown’s mouth. Dean did the worst on the trick whole shot where you had to get the ball to go through a pipe system. Cas got a hole in one.
Dean chuckled and nodded, “Hell yeah.”
“Okay, so first up,” Dean turned the page, “we have the mini golf moat fiasco. I was so mad at you when you took that picture, but honestly, it’s pretty funny now. We didn’t even get to finish the game, and since they banned us from the property, there’s a good chance that we never will. Guess we’ll have to find a new course.”
Dean was beyond scared. But then he looked into those beautiful blue eyes, and he knew he couldn’t fight this any longer.
The list was 15 items, narrowed down from about 30 ideas, all of which held some promise of making memories.
“Yes, Sam. One second.” He begrudgingly grabbed a blanket from the basket he brought in earlier and opened the door. He shoved the blanket into Sam’s arms, “Here you go. Goodnight.”
Dean went over to the picnic table and poured Cas a cup of soda. He grabbed the bottle of whiskey and took a seat next to his friend. Cas eyed him as he poured the alcohol into his own cup.
As Dean went to sit up, he could feel the sickness creep back into his stomach. He hopped out of bed and bolted to the bathroom.
“Oh, we’re not missing that. But the Rock Monument might be something we’d have to sacrifice.”
If he didn’t eat anything else all day, he could justify it. This was just one large meal. If nothing else went in, then he wouldn’t have to force anything out. Balance.
It had been years, but Dean still couldn’t erase the memory. His dad wasn’t the poster child for A+ parenting, but Dean had come to terms with that. For the most part anyway.
Dean walked Cas to the front door, promising to have his clothes washed and folded before he went into work the next day. Not that it did the jacket much good. Cas would probably have to buy a new one.
They washed and dried the dishes in a comfortable silence. Basking in the subtle bliss and domestic calm of the moment. It was like their pasts never happened. Like the world was a blank slate and they were writing their future.
“Relax, babe. Get on the bed.”
“No, I’m just tying my shoe.” He quickly knotted the laces and returned to his seat.
“Personally, I’m a fan of the Ferris wheel,” Cas said, looking up at the giant revolving circle of spokes and rainbow topped cabins.
“I’m not mad.”
“I feel like crap. Probably look like crap. The world is ending, so you know, the usual.”
“I’m putting away some clothes, why?” Cas responded.
Then he met another woman, one who was more conservative. She rarely drank, liked to go to sleep at a reasonable hour, and reserved her partying for dinners with friends. She and Chuck hit it off, and nine months later, along came little Castiel.
“You want anything while I’m in there?” He asked.
“We get it Dean, you want your boyfriend’s parents to like us, but do I really have to wear this? This isn’t me.” John held up a freshly ironed button up shirt.
“I’ve been working as a stock boy at the market downtown.”
Cas’s voice was quick and urgent. He didn’t really stop to think about what he was saying, it just flew from his mouth.
His Monday started off poor. He checked his weight in the morning and he had gained two pounds. Two. He knew he shouldn’t have eaten all that damn food, let alone keep it down. He decided to skip breakfast, figuring the best move would be to cut out the high calorie peanut butter.
Dean could feel his heart racing, his fist clenched at his side. There was something about seeing Meg kiss Cas that infuriated him. He didn’t know why. Maybe he was being over protective. Maybe he didn’t like the idea of his best friend and a co-worker making out in front of him. Maybe there was only one person in the circle he wanted Cas to kiss.
Dean bites his lip, trying to figure out where to start. Trying to figure out how to tell Cas what’s been going on without seeming like the biggest asshole on Earth and without completely breaking his heart.
Cas puts on his gas mask and grabs one for Dean. He only lives across the street, so they’ll make it there before the lockdown hits. It’s a particularly smoggy night. It looks like a dense fog set in over the town. That’s the downside to whatever the hell this stuff is, it’s in the oceans and rivers and lakes, and all day, it absorbs heat from the sun, then at night, it releases toxins as it cools down.
Dean situated himself in the small space next to Cas on the hospital bed, his arm gently draped across Cas’s chest.
Dean took a couple more sips, feeling the warmth slide down through him. Cas kissed him gently before leaving him to rest.
John lowered his arm, a look of pure repulsion settled into his face. Dean had never seen him this angry.
Cas queued up a bunch of movies he knew Dean loved, and set out two big bowls of chips and popcorn for them to share. He also picked up some non-diet soda, chocolate, and licorice. This was supposed to be a fun night, and from what Cas had seen of events like this, it’s an excuse to eat a bunch of junk food. He topped it off with super comfy blankets, pillows, and matching pajamas. He couldn't wait!
Dean: “
The laxatives must’ve kicked in, because next thing he knew, excrement was shooting out of his body. His intestines burned, and everything hurt. He thought he was going to die.
He looked at himself in the mirror. He could see the disappointment, the disgust. The monster he had turned into. He didn’t want that. He had to fix it.
“Okay.”
The party was being held in an abandoned housing complex on the outskirts of the city. Locals referred to it as Ghost Town. Most of the houses had been gutted of anything valuable, so they really didn’t serve much purpose other than being glorified club houses for wayward youth and shelter for the homeless. The cops had all but given up on patrolling it. During the town’s heyday the houses were given to military families, but once the jobs were shipped elsewhere, they were forgotten.
As the meal drew to a close, and everyone was starting to get drowsy from the turkey, Dean decided it would be a good time to put his plan into motion. He cleared his throat, clinking his fork against his glass of cider.
Cas went out to the front of the bunker where Sam was looking up recent Obits in the area. He asked him if he would make a run to the store to get some things to help Dean’s stomach. Sam agreed and headed out
Cas scoffs, “That weird “goop” happens to work as a sunblock for the inhabitants of the Whirlpool Galaxy. Their sun is much more harmful than ours, but the vines only grow on Earth.”
But that’s just how he was.
The laughing continued.
Cas’s father, Chuck, was a rolling stone kind of man. Didn’t like to stay in one place too long, got bored easily, and always was on the hunt for something more exciting than what he currently had. That’s how he met Michael and Luce’s mother.
It was a Tuesday, which meant Cas and Sam were both working. He knew they couldn’t call him. He shot them both a text on the off chance that one of them would answer. After 20 minutes, Dean caved.
“That’s very generous of you, but I don’t think I’m qualified for anything there. Besides, the government is willing to pay everything off, and that’s not something I can just turn down to help weed some plants.”
He was maybe thirteen years old, right in the awkward thralls of puberty, and discovering new feelings. He was popping boners left and right for the girls on the cheerleading squad, the substitute English teacher… Nathan from the baseball team.
They escorted Cas and Dean back to their car, and kindly informed them that they were no longer allowed on the property.
“Dean! Get up!”
“That’s not...” Cas closes his eyes, and lets out a defeated sigh. “Just sit on the bed.”
“Cas, I can’t even begin to describe how much you mean to me, but I’m going to try. I have never known a love like I have with you. When I’m sad, you make me smile. When I have good news, you’re always excited to hear it. When times are tough, I know I can depend on you. With you, it’s easy. It’s as if we’ve known each other, in another universe, at another time, and that’s probably true, because as I’m standing here, looking in your eyes, I can’t imagine a universe where you don’t love me, and I don’t love you.”
Cas could barely breathe, hands clawing to loosen Michael’s grip. It was no use. His angel blade was on the other side of the room, there was no back up coming. He was running out of options, so he resorted to the only thing he thought might work.
Cas knows how much Dean loves to look around the experimental greenhouse, and when he asks if Dean would like to go back there, his invitation is quickly accepted.
The three made casual talk about the werewolf situation, and what their game plan would be when they got into town.
“Not true!” Dean said, pointing his finger at the night stand. “We had a year old bottle of ginger ale and stale crackers, and if that ain’t a Winchester remedy, I don’t know what is.”
He tried not to cry as he set the song on repeat. The lyrics hit too close to home.
“Same to you, my little lumberjack.” Cas took his pointer finger and booped Dean on the nose. Dean wanted to be disgusted, but honestly, it was cute.
Cas collapsed to the ground, rolling around in the dirt, as Dean forcefully beat his arm in an attempt to extinguish and remaining flames.
Cas puts on some music and fixes their plates. Dean takes his with extra meat, because honestly, it smells delicious, and it probably tastes just as good.
Sam was beyond worried. The nephilim was still out on the loose, as was Lucifer. This job was going to be difficult enough as it was for one Winchester, he didn’t want his partner in crime to sit out on this one.
“Perhaps you should go a little easier next time,” Cas said with a smile, placing his hand on Dean’s shoulder.
Cas sat down with a huff, slamming the door shut. “Sorry, your highness. There is going to be next to no cloud coverage today and I had to apply my sunblock. Unless, of course, you want me to get skin cancer and die?”
He found a soda way in the back of the fridge and drank that as he ate the super sweet oatmeal.
Dean spent most of his life feeling like an empty pit of nothingness, and he wanted his body to be in perfect alignment with his soul. It was hard, at first, but eventually it became easier. He found a balance, or at least he thought he did.
A huge smile spread over Dean’s face as he realized maybe he wouldn’t get that wish, but what he had in front of him was pretty damn good. He had his little brother, who was happy and healthy, and he had Bobby, who was like a dad to him. For all of the shit he had to put up with, it was moments like this that made him feel lucky. Even if the cake tasted like baking powder.
Then Cas sets the popcorn bowl directly between them, and he’s back to thinking it’s a bromance.
“I’d love to.”
“Not my body!”
“You were throwing up your food, Dean. While I’m no expert, I think that might be something you should see a professional about.”
Dean didn’t mind the taste of alcohol, but then again he’d probably drank a lot more of it than Cas had in his lifetime.
“How are you Dean?” Cas asked, a little skittish.
Even though Dean had to switch schools, they went with each other to their respective middle school dances. They even wore matching converse. Then for Halloween, they coordinated their costumes.
Dean knew he’d have the house to himself for most of the day, which usually was a good thing. However, this time around, it proved to be a catalyst for bad things. It didn’t take long for Dean to fuck up all the hard work he had put in.
At dinner, Cas was almost too embarrassed to order anything. Dean insisted on paying, and this was the kind of place that didn’t put dollar signs on the menu. They sipped their drinks and picked at their appetizers under the warm glow of candle light.
“Dean?” Cas’s voice snaps Dean out of his trance.
But as it turned out, there wouldn’t be much talking at all.
“Thank you.” Cas smiles as Dean shovels the pasta into his mouth. To some it would be seen as rude, but Cas finds it endearing. And also quite the compliment.
He had a solid job, a nice house, and a wonderful husband, all the things that should make a person happy, but for some reason he couldn’t keep his doubts at bay. Those pesky little thoughts kept telling him he wasn’t good enough, that Cas deserved someone better, that he was unlovable.
