“You are my sweet repressed Sherlock, are you not?”
Sherlock faced him and John could feel his hard stare, but couldn’t meet it head-on.
~~~~~~~~~~~~
John smirked; he liked the liveliness in Sherlock… Where had this alpha been hiding?
“Say hello dear.” Mrs. Holmes nudged Sherlock’s arm with her elbow, smile faltering with embarrassment when Sherlock refused to greet John.
When Mrs. Holmes stood in front of him, she hurriedly yanked him against her and gave him a warm welcoming hug. John let out a noise of surprise and awkwardly patted the woman’s back, though never fully hugging her in return. It was so foreign, having someone touch him like this, and yet… it was nice. It reminded him of the hugs he’d shared with his mother. Glancing up the steps to the open door, John was met by the sight of an elderly man, smiling kindly at him and beside him was a smirking Mycroft.
Sherlock Holmes…his intended’s name was Sherlock Holmes. In all his years of knowing he was promised to an alpha, he’d never once acknowledged his name. Sure he’d heard his name mentioned several
John daringly raised his eyes to take in Sherlock's features and found the omega was trembling, unsure as to why, his deep sea green eyes stared at him with such fear and John froze where he knelt. Even now, even when the omega was commanding him like an alpha he still feared him, fearing that John would retaliate for the omega's challenge. John decided then that he would not hesitate again.
“Now this might feel a little uncomfortable, but I’ll go slowly.” Dr. Levy then began to insert the wand and John hitched a breath.
Sherlock simmered in his seat, body trembling from the want of getting his hands on Mycroft.
” Sherlock whined when John broke into a brisk walk and Sherlock chased after him.
“I… because I’m… I was bought to bring the Holmeses kin, and now that I’m unable to… I tried. I really did try to convince Sherlock to have a second, but he doesn’t want one. I… I… don’t think I can ask him again, but… but if you’ve chosen someone already… I will let him know.” John tried to remain strong, tried not to let the pain of his circumstances destroy him, but then he thought about the very strong possibility Mrs. Holmes might have already found someone for Sherlock and that… It hurt to consider. Sherlock might refuse, but if his parents pressured him, would he give?
Sherlock nosed his way along John’s cheek, moving closer to John’s nose and nuzzled him, before salty lips brushed against salty lips.
The alpha…looked sad. John recalled that faint smile the alpha flashed him, only now understanding the pain bleeding out of those stunning eyes. Why? Disappointment, John wasn’t what the alpha expected. Shutting his eyes, he released a shuddering breath and forced out a weak laugh. What did his alpha expect? Just because he was an omega, it didn’t mean he was as beautiful as the alpha. John was short, average looking, and now after the war, broken. Of course his alpha was disappointed. Still, John was fertile and an omega. Omegas were the only ones capable of producing a full litter. Betas could only birth one or two pups at a time, whereas omegas could birth as many as ten pups. This still made John highly valued and this was the sole reason he’d been bought.
A replacement omega was given to a alpha that had lost their original omega through death. Alphas requested a new omega from a match making agency. When the agency found an omega that had an alpha who had died before a claim could be made, they were given to a new alpha. Usually, given to the highest bidder, or one with a lot of connections.
” Sherlock exclaimed at the idea.
Sherlock didn’t care about the minor aching pain of being cruelly shoved, because the scent of his alpha’s arousal overwhelmed him. So potent, strong, the lemony bitter fragrance and musk burning his nostrils and he knew John was dripping with pre-cum. He whimpered softly, remorsefully, wanting that pre-cum, needing it, not wanting to waste a single drop of his alpha’s seed, all of it was
Sherlock shook his head, unable to bear John’s words, and defiantly took both of John’s hands in his own.
“No.”
Sherlock caught up to John’s hurried pace and took hold of his arm, pulling him around to face him.
"Oh, were we?" Mrs. Holmes asked surprised.
“What are you doing?” Sherlock asked, resonance lower than natural.
"Stop what, Sherlock?" John asked as if he hadn't just been committing adultery when he was, because it was
John finished chewing his ham before answering, “Not sure, maybe later on tonight.”
"You bloody well should be. I felt it. You died."
When several more moment's passed in silence, Gregory raised his head and looked up in annoyance. That annoyance was quickly wiped away with shock.
With these thoughts in mind, John hailed a taxi and called Sarah. He informed her that he would be unable to come to work for the next three days, due to an emergency. John felt horrible after the call, hating to lie, and this was a lie. Because, although his personal life felt like it was crumbling to pieces, this wasn't a emergency that would hinder his working ability. But right now, John didn't want to be around people.
John knew… He understood after he had time to gather his thoughts, to talk it over with his doctor, there had been no way to save their children. It was either he died with his pups or his pregnancy was terminated and they saved his life. It was a heartbreaking thought, that for him to live, it meant he’d lose his children. John felt guilt. He knew there was nothing that could be done, but still, it was so very painful.
Sherlock’s laughter dissipated and he flicked his hand dismissively.
“I love you.” John would growl possessively when forcefully slamming himself down on Sherlock’s cock.
John couldn’t stop the laughter from breaking forth at Sherlock’s words. Sherlock had said something similar soon after they’d married.
Sherlock huffed with annoyance, but nodded his head in acceptance.
John might have paid more attention to the glass walls, but the small table in the center of the room covered with a white table cloth, holding upon it a small bouquet of red roses, two long white lit candles, and two culinary prepared meals, stole his attention.
Mycroft had been pleasantly amused when an agent sent him a file that detailed how Gigi stopped her car in the middle of traffic to help a hurt dog laying in the road who’d been hit by another car. She’d immediately taken the dog to a local animal hospital. Though the dog wasn’t hers, she’d taken responsibility for it, paying for its surgery and adopting it.
“Mm.” John leaned forward and Sherlock bent low to meet him in an innocent kiss.
“Why are you avoiding me?” Lestrade rushed, breathless. Apparently the D.I. wasn’t going to warm his way up to this topic.
“I want to provide the best for our pups, John. Let me.” Sherlock requested and John couldn’t refuse Sherlock, not when he flashed him those needing pale gray eyes.
Sherlock gazed up at John with brows raised, hidden under his fringe, cheeks flaming with embarrassment; a pleading whine erupted out of Sherlock.
John looked just short of being unhinged and gave a hurried nod. "I need you too. You can take it, yes?"
"I..." Sherlock tried shaking his head to get the alpha's hand off his face.
” Sherlock nearly squawked.
“Morning.” John greeted kindly, making his way to where Sherlock seated himself and placed a warm cup of tea for him.
John eyes clearly threatened an overconfident Irene.
“Goodnight, John.” Sherlock mumbled against the skin of the omega’s bond bite, now warm hands splaying out over his stomach and rubbing against the cloth of his shirt, seeming to want to calm his nerves.
John watched mutedly as Sherlock squirted a generous amount of lubricant into his palm. His mouth parted on a voiceless gasp when Sherlock fisted himself and stroked his half erect cock. John’s hand shot down to grip himself, moaning longingly, feeling so very ready and watching Sherlock stroking himself to full hardness was just too much.
Sherlock’s words fell away because in the very instant he turned his head to look out at the swarm of onlookers, he found John standing outside of the police tape and...
Gregory's wolf was baying with delight, drinking up his trembling, nervous mate, when all at once he found himself forced back and away from the alpha he desired. Staring up in a daze, Gregory found Mycroft standing before him.
“Well, of course it’s for men,
John was preparing to leave.
After another few minutes of painful silence, Sherlock finally spoke.
“I’m sorry, John. I just…”
“You must stay next to me the whole time!”
Sherlock spun again and this time, thankfully, walked. John caught up and they strolled quietly side by side. The alpha wasn’t all that bad. He wasn’t dominating or overbearing in the least. He was calm, thoughtful and… What was John thinking? Surely he knew this behavior would not last. Sherlock was possessive. Still… Even when the alpha showed signs of possessiveness, he’d never tried to dominate him, never tried to make him do something he didn’t want to.
“Mm.”
"Nungh!" John grunted, gritting his teeth together, his briefs feeling too tight, and suddenly they were dampening, cotton soaking up the copious amount of pre-come the head of his cock spouted. Later, when John could think clearly he'd be mortified that his body had responded so readily, but the scent was the cause. It was driving him wild.
“Are you… flirting with me?” Mycroft inquired confounded.
“My thoughts exactly.”
“You do.”
Mary's anger vanished as John's voice wavered, her eyes softened with care, and John stubbornly wiped that wetness that dampened his lashes.
John warily stared up at the door and exhaled a trembling breath. Palming his face, feeling absolutely powerless, John focused on listening on the alpha. He could hear the alpha shuffling, changing back into his clothes, and then the harsh panting breaths as the alpha paced the hall outside of the restroom.
"Fuck." John cursed, his body shaking, unsure how to calm the pain of his pulsing heart and the guilt weighing down his stomach.
“Really?”
“…alpha, scent me.” John completed slowly, endeavoring to calm his breathing enough to say so little.
if not for his exasperating mother. He hated her for her meddling, but she was his mother. The last time he stabbed Mycroft and almost killed him, he'd sent his mother in a rather drear state. Sherlock hated how he couldn’t stomach the idea of her dying of a heart attack from the shock of it. So no, although Sherlock was fully capable of killing Mycroft, he would not for his mother’s sake.
"He will hate you for it," Mycroft warned.
“I…” Sherlock couldn’t say it, but John knew.
"Mind palace?"
John didn’t dither in taking his place beside Sherlock, nor did he second guess himself when wrapping his arms around Sherlock’s waist and pressing his chest to Sherlock’s back, spooning him snugly.
Sherlock blinked blankly, mind turning, attempting to make sense of this seemingly senseless response. Apparently, Sherlock thought he’d refuse and John might have if his sister’s life didn’t hang in the balance.
“Sherlock!” Mrs. Hudson called out with alarm when Sherlock swayed. Losing his balance, Sherlock shot a hand out and gripped to the frame of the door and steadied himself.
“Ignore all of that. It’s just the, uh, the shock talking.” Sherlock detoured and ignoring Lestrade’s need for understanding he hurriedly made his way over to John.
." John choked out in amazement, smile never wavering.
“I shouldn’t have acted like some scorned omega. I had no right. This is an arrangement after all.”
John paused for a moment, and then stepped aside to allow the man in. What he had not expected was for another gentleman to enter, carrying a small leather bag in hand. John watched surprised when the second man popped out from the side of the hall and entered. He made his way over to John’s small table, set his bag down, opened it and retrieved sterilized medical equipment containing what John knew to be an alpha submissive kit.
"But you love him."
Mycroft hummed with agreement and met Gregory's gaze once more.
"God, do you know how much I love you?" Gregory breathed contentedly.
Sherlock set his violin and bow down on his chair and moved quickly to join John on the floor. Worry clearly evident in his eyes. John loved Sherlock, but Sherlock thought of John as a friend—Sherlock hadn’t said such in so many words, but John felt it in the kindness and care his omega expressed sparingly.
The agent nodded his head in confirmation and left. Soon after his departure there was a knock on his door and Mycroft called them in.
Sherlock's fist jerked frenziedly, stinging slightly with no lubricant, but a quick swipe of his hand to his lower thighs slicked them up just enough and he set back at it. Thrusting into John's mouth, while John's hand loved on his bollocks, fondling them, rolling them in his hand. His tongue rubbed against the sensitive underside and Sherlock arched up, breathing intensifying, cut off little gasps and groans breaking free. Sherlock was close.
John didn't lie. He wasn't with his beta wife, or some sexual miscreant in a seedy motel. He was in a Mexican restaurant with festive cultural decorations. Loud, upbeat music filled the room along with joyous chatter.
Sherlock then rushed for the nearest door, checked the exit for anything suspicious and found nothing, then rushed back in and began pacing the floor, struggling to make sense of everything that had happened.
“What does it need a title for?” Sherlock sniped before pulling away and John couldn’t suppress the amused smile upon his lips as he continued typing.
Sherlock moved around to his side of the bed and to his nightstand, opening the first drawer, John could make out that faded red towel laying in it beside a large, unused bottle of lubricant.
John bit his bottom lip, holding back a relieved sigh, not wanting to test his luck.
~~~~~~~~~~~~
“Mm.” John moaned feebly, burying his face into the alpha’s chest, and shoved his nose harshly there. He fought to keep the cries within and his shoulders shook with his effort.
“Our pups. Seven, John,
“Get on with it.” Sherlock growled.
"Will you hold me close and tell me how beautiful I am while your round head loves my hole? Will you fuck me gently, but firmly? Will you come inside me? Make me drip with slick and spunk. I won't be able to hold your seed, because I'm already full of it John. Do you realize that? We're going to soil your sheets with slick and come because you've already seeded me."
“I didn’t get married. I was never going to marry the omega my parents introduced me to. I’d chosen her out of the many candidates, because she was the youngest and wanted to finish her schooling before we would bond. It gave me time.” Sherlock started and John felt the sudden need to sit himself down, and quickly stumbled to a nearby chair where he watched Sherlock pace the floor of his living room.
Sherlock stared blankly at John. Blinking within the silence and trying to understand this new information.
“Really.”
"Keep pushing." the doctor ordered and Sherlock did.
John lowered himself, pressing his chest against Sherlock's, one hand gripping Sherlock's hair, the other cupping his face, and he stared. Stared at Sherlock with all the love he possessed for it was a surprising amount of love, more so than Sherlock had seen in any couple he'd ever met. It was reassuring and inspiring.
“I told you.” Sherlock leaned close, pressing his nose against John’s temple and scenting him amorously. “I told you so clearly how I’ve loved you.”
"Rise up and straddle my lap, soldier."
John still couldn’t speak—something was choked up in his throat, words like,
"Don't you dare! What you did was unforgivable."
“Get OR 4 ready now.” The doctor called, doors opening in front of John as he was ushered deeper into the medical building.
Rising from his chair, John left the living area and went to his old room upstairs. They now used it for storage. Sherlock never went up there, but John did. It was the perfect place to keep things he wanted hidden from his husband. Only one thing he hid here and now he was to reveal it.
John couldn’t give in. Not now. Not until he was sure Sherlock loved him.
“Hmm?” Sherlock nosed John’s brow, scenting him further, though there was no need for it. John already smelled of Sherlock, and now their combined scents were strengthening with the progression of the sexual relations with one another.
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Glancing over to his side and to the somber omega, John found Sherlock equally discontented with his mother’s choice of cake designs. The crowd cheered for them, and wanting this wedding to be over and done with, John acted first and took the knife placed on the table and waited for Sherlock to take hold of his hand.
"Stop... Please, stop." It was noticeably causing John a lot of grief to hear these words from Sherlock.
John rubbed at the back of his neck, ducking his head shyly. “Maybe.”
.” Sherlock spoke the last of his words full of suggestion, that ‘rest’ would be the last thing they’d be doing and John froze.
is at the flat? He… came to Baker Street?” Sherlock deduced the clarity in Mrs. Hudson’s words, but still… Sherlock found it hard to register the truth of them. John seeking him out just seemed so… beyond belief. Why John would…
“It’s for men.”
“Get off my sheet!” Sherlock demanded.
"You won't say it back?" Gregory whined playfully.
Shutting off the shower, Sherlock exited the bathroom and quickly dressed himself in a pair of comfortable gray pyjama slacks and a white t-shirt. He hardly had the energy to tend to his wounds, but he knew he should do that now.
“It’s Mrs. Hudson. I asked her to go shopping and buy some clothes for you as we aren’t the same size and you won’t be able to wear my robe forever.” Sherlock explained, rising to his feet and hesitantly moved around John, taking great efforts not to touch him, and headed for the door.
Sherlock shifted, knees pulling up until he was kneeling low, sucking fervently, head bobbing slow and powerfully as one hand lowered to shove his sleeping slacks down enough and allowing his heavy cock to spring out. Sherlock took himself in hand and began stroking delicately at himself groaning happily, mouth full of John’s cock as he did so.
“I… am tired of jumping through hoops for you. I… I’ve tried my hardest, but even then it’s not enough. Take your suppressants. Ignore me. Hate me for the rest of our lives, John. It won’t matter to me for much longer. I’ll just erase it all.”
Sherlock's eyes narrowed with distrust.
“Suck me off, touch yourself, but don’t come.” John ordered.
“I researched you, before we met. I discovered everything that I could to impress you. It’s a trick. It’s just a magic trick.”
"I can't trust him."
.” John said, full of commitment, pushing his mouth against the alpha’s cheek in a zealous sloppy kiss, and rolled onto his back. Without warning, John hauled Sherlock’s upper body on top of his, awkwardly.
Sherlock swallowed thickly and John watched as the lean man’s Adam’s apple bobbed, breaking John of any more patience. He’d waited long enough. A day spent alone through his heat was far longer than sanely possible for an omega to endure. He knew he’d lost his mind five jacking offs, eight fingerings, and thirteen unsatisfying orgasms ago.
This was enough... Well, it wasn't, but it would have to be. Sherlock bowed his head in a moment of silence and utter loss. Missing the hurt that flashed upon John's face.
Sherlock scented the arousal kindled and smiled brightly when John became more reserved and unsure of himself, the persistence of this act John had been playing faltered in the presence of Sherlock’s unexpected nakedness.
Now all that there was left to do was wait for Sherlock’s return. Return he did, later, but not overly so, the pasta was temperate, but still well made and John really didn’t think food was the objective for tonight. Sherlock stepped foot into the home at 10:34PM with a look of surprise written clearly upon his face. John being dressed in his finest suit might have been equally surprising.
“No. Are you interested in me?”
…” John rasped deeply, leaning in closer than before all so he could inhale the scent of his husband; Sherlock smelled so bitterly sweet, so nice, overwhelming and heartening at the same time.
Pride. It was a thing Sherlock had plenty of and at first it was ever present when they'd met. His pride had made him act out and be cruel. But now, Sherlock simply wanted to be filled and taken care of. His mind was tired and now his body was following in kind. He was too tired to remain angry and fighting what was meant to be. John said he loved him and wanted to care for him. He said it would just be him and he wouldn't abandon him for that beta. Maybe it was time for Sherlock to be the omega he always wanted to be. Let John be the alpha for his omega.
. The home was situated in the middle of nowhere and the lush green land surrounding the home most probably was a part of the estate, it spanned what must be hundreds of acres.
John leaned against the door frame of the kitchen and swallowed audibly, scanning over Sherlock’s form.
“Why?”
.” Sherlock sounded so frail, broken; John’s insides twisted excruciatingly. He wanted to help, he wanted to somehow gain the ability in which would allow him to remove the cause of such turmoil within his husband.
They’d promised to try and live as a true married couple and everything they’d done so far had been going well and felt so right. This…this too felt right. Still, was John ready to take their bonding to this level? A kiss? It was just a kiss, right?
John’s fangs extended at the sight of Irene wearing one of Sherlock’s dress shirts and nothing else. The nerve of this woman, to sleep in their marriage bed, then to wear his husband’s shirt, John wanted nothing more than to throw her out of their home, but no—Sherlock wouldn’t be pleased with John when he slipped out of his mind palace and learned of what he’d done.
“John…” Sherlock was still unable to meet his gaze.
Mrs. Hudson’s eyes were wild, shined in the light, and her features were set in with worry as she wavered out, “Sherlock, what have you done?”
“John, I'm—
“Agreeable? You must certainly feel more than that?”
“What did I say?” John demanded of Sherlock. “I said,
They’d tried to watch a movie, once, and John was in tears by the end, Sherlock complained about every little thing to the point where John enjoyed Sherlock’s cynical commentary more than the film. The patrons did not appreciate it as much. That was the first and last movie they ever watched in the theaters together.
“No.”
“So? What are you waiting for?”
“Okay. I’ll just clean this up before heading to bed.” John mumbled, seeming put off, but nevertheless rose to his feet and began cleaning up after himself.
Breeding.
"Good." Sherlock confirmed their agreement. "Now carry me to my room and remain in bed with me as I sleep. After which, you may stop touching me, but stay and sleep on my bed." Sherlock ordered of the alpha.
John didn’t see the bicyclist as he zipped by and clipped him, causing him to slam hard into the ground—though not as hard as… “Sherlock… Sherlock…”
"I love you, Sherlock." John whispered sadly.
"John... I need your love, more than I need life."
The shock and then misery that filled Gregory's warm eyes did not give Mycroft the vindication he thought his statement would. Mycroft couldn't stare into those eyes longer than a few seconds, and instead focused on staring at his folded hands resting on the desk.
Sherlock remained hidden, watching as John rose from the table, smiled at those seated, and said his goodbyes to the group. On his way out, John made his way to the birthday woman who danced with several other female co-workers and said something that made her smile brightly. The woman gave him a friendly side hug and then she danced off with the other women.
"Give it all to me." Sherlock's breath ghosted over John's lips, his eyes soft, open, and something twisted within John, and suddenly Sherlock's muscles clamped around John's cock, holding tight, seeming to want to milk him.
Sherlock tossed his head to the side and buried his face in the pillow. The genius’ dark damp curls shielded his eyes and revealed rosy cheeks. Panting breathlessly, Sherlock gripped to John’s back, and clenched his shut eyes with force when John rutted against him in firm, measured thrusts.
“I… I didn’t mind the bonding before… I really didn’t, but… I just…”
John watched as Mycroft rounded the desk, seating himself in his chair and motioned that John sit in one of the two chairs facing him from across the desk. Releasing a heavy breath, John ambled sluggishly towards the awaiting mediator and collapsed down in his seat, weighed down by the stress of everything.
John came to a sudden halt and snapped his harsh gaze to the open eyes before him.
“I wish I’d never met you.”
~~~~~~~~~~~~
“Upstairs.”
"I smell like slick and you. Does that excite you?" Sherlock teased.
“Me? Yeah. Fine. Fine.” Sherlock breathlessly answered.
The genuine happiness and trust that John projected in the utterance of his name made him recall his actions and just how little he trusted the alpha in return. It wasn't guilt, not really, but Sherlock didn't feel good about his actions. He'd essentially stalked his mate.
John's eyes shone with unshed tears at whatever he found in Sherlock's gaze. Maybe it was the inability to forgive.
John gripped to Sherlock’s shoulders as a full body convulsion rocked through him. He was going to come if he thrust hard like that again and then he’d be painfully embarrassed he couldn’t even last a full minute.
Sherlock glared murderously at the alpha for his accusations. As if Sherlock would be so superficial. None of that mattered. Sherlock simply didn't find he had the desire for expressions of affection. Or rather, he didn't allow himself, because sentiment was a weakness that would destroy him.
“Can you unlock the door?” John asked of Sherlock the moment they stopped at their front door.
Luckily Harry expected this, wrapped her arm around his waist and wound one of John’s arms around the back neck. The two hobbled around the car and to a building, civilians passing by stared on with curiosity, but none seemed to scent his heat.
Mycroft pinched the bridge of his nose and shut his eyes, trying to gather his thoughts.
“Just thought I should warn you before you got lost.” Sherlock raised his eyes once more, flashed a weak smile that appeared...painful, and then turned to leave the outer perimeter of the maze.
The movie. Sherlock wasn't even sure of what it was they'd watched. He'd spent the time contemplating the strangeness that was himself and staring at John. The alpha was so focused on the movie that he hadn't even realized Sherlock was staring at him repeatedly.
"Oh."
Someone moved to kneel at his side and worriedly asked him questions, but he paid them no mind. Instead Sherlock smiled up at the blue of the sky. His body ached so much. The pain brought him near tears, but the longer he immersed himself in his pain the more numb he felt. His head buzzed dizzily, throbbing and glaring, making it almost impossible to think, but that was better.
Regardless of these thoughts, John still couldn’t refrain from smiling with amusement by how energized Sherlock became. John knew how much Sherlock had been waiting for another case and after all they were married, they had all the time in the world to talk. This was okay, Sherlock needed to stimulate his mind and this case would most certainly do it.
Victor shook his head and gave him the cutest of bitch faces John had ever seen.
John tasted of tears, smelled of him, and kissed with keenness. Sherlock opened his mouth slowly, eyes open staring at John’s closed eyes, brows knitting together as he kissed John back. Analyzing the way John kissed him with less hesitancy, less of hunger, more of despairing need. Sherlock eyes lowered to John’s red nose as he inhaled, tongue grooving along his own, scenting him, almost revering.
“I have been reliably informed that I don't have one.” Sherlock spoke devoid of any emotion, making it a point to avert his gaze from John. Not wanting Moriarty to see—for all Moriarty knew, John was just an arranged omega to him that held now place in his heart—but Moriarty could see what Sherlock tried to hide. Of course someone as insanely intelligent as Moriarty could see through Sherlock’s façade.
John's features turned sour at the realization that Sherlock would feel the pain of first penetration.
Then the memories of Irene Adler flashed in his mind and John hated how even by just a memory of The Woman he noticeably flinched. Sherlock chose Irene and John wasn’t so sure Irene was dead, not with how Sherlock had responded to his news when he’d said she’d gone into witness protection.
They hardly ever touched in the day time, but for the exception when needing to help one another during a case, but those were few and rare. The only time they touched was at night when they slept in the same bed, and that was because of John. If Sherlock had it his way they wouldn’t touch in bed either. John was always the one who moved close to Sherlock, pressed his body against Sherlock’s and spooned him. Sherlock never leaned into his touch, nor did he willingly touch John back, but it was enough. It had to be enough. Sooner or later, Sherlock would fall for him again.
"Enough." Sherlock bade with far more roughness than he would have liked to show on camera and jerked his hand out of the alpha's grasp to instead wrap it around the alpha's neck. At the sudden action, his inner omega cried out in protest at the threatening demonstration, but Sherlock cared not. An alpha's neck was never to be touched in such a way. Applying pressure to the jugular was not to be done. Kin could touch an alpha's neck, but only the most trusted and closest to the alpha. This was not a touch of affection and they were not close- damn what their inner wolves believed.
"Don't... Please. I..." John was going to be sick.
Raising his head up, Sherlock watched John's tendons strain, veins popping and strumming along his neck as he gave a heavy grunt followed by a long, deep groan, his cock spasming within. Sherlock shut his eyes then and enjoyed the moment as his insides filled, dampening in the wetness of his alpha's heat.
“You total idiot. Now what do I do?” Sherlock amusedly asked of the softly snoring omega.
"Well then. I have other things I need to take care of, so I am hoping I can trust you not to do something like this again," Mycroft had said as he'd neared the car and a waiting agent opened the door for him.
"I know. I'm a horrible omega. I know, okay. Please go." Sherlock shifted uncomfortably under the gaze of the alpha. John wasn't looking away from the omega now.
“Oh, back to Victor are we?”
“If not Moriarty, then who?”
The walls of the room were lined up with bookshelves that were full to the brink; books were even stacked up on the top of the shelf. A large leather couch was placed on the far end of the room, near an enormous window that overlooked the magnificent gardens, and what appeared to be an extensive and intricate maze.
“Or I’ll just walk away.” Sherlock’s voice was even, taunting.
John stared at Sherlock completely lost. His mouth parted slightly, words attempting to work their way to the surface, but struggling to get there.
John and Sherlock lay on their backs. Sherlock’s hands were folded over the comforter across his abdomen whereas John laid his hands over his chest. Both stared up at the cream colored ceiling for a long while, not the least bit tired.
"I'm sorry. I should have told you, but don't question my feelings Sherlock. You have never been a contract to me. I always wanted you. I've loved you from the beginning. Victor-"
"I will. Jesus. Just shut up." John raised out a hand to cup Sherlock's face, his other gripping to silky curls and holding fast as he rutted into him with far less care.
"It's alright, Sherlock. It will only last for a little while longer."
John had an idea what this lesson would entail and with a moment’s pause, uncertain he was ready to learn if his suspicions were correct, he pressed the play button. Immediately, John knew this video was different. There were no interviewed experts, no commentary, just a video capturing an alpha prowling near his omega counterpart.
Oh, that was good. More than good. Wonderful. Blessedly wonderful, because Sherlock seriously needed John to fuck him. Now.
“Mm?” John hummed, retrieving the cooled pasta in its bowl and began mixing it with the sauce.
John let out a throaty laugh and rubbed his eyes.
“John?” Sherlock took a step towards him.
.” Sherlock wetly murmured, diving in to suck harshly on the bond mark.
Sherlock was eight and a half months pregnant and looking more and more like a whale. To be specific a blue whale. They were the largest of whales and right now Sherlock felt like he had those whales beat.
John wondered why he should even try living this kind of sad life. He didn’t want to live a lonely life such as this. Then John stumbled upon an article. It was about the most recent alpha submissive to have publicly registered themselves. The submissive alpha and his lovely omega were interviewed about their marriage and how they felt now that they were expecting their first litter of pups. John looked at the photos of the couple, so happy, so in love.
“Your soul?”
During the hours between lunch and dinner, John spent his time in the Holmes’ library downstairs reading books, but never truly contemplating their subject matter as Sherlock’s words kept ringing in his mind, effectively drowning out all the other voices of his past. It contradicted every one of them. This was what unsettled John the most.
John’s eyes trailed down Sherlock’s face to his lips, parted, pale and inviting, breathing erratically and needing. Not thinking of the consequences, John raised himself onto the tips of his toes, hands resting on Sherlock’s shoulders for support before his lips were a hairsbreadth away from Sherlock’s.
"I... I love you." John hissed past a soft whimper and palmed his damp lashes.
~~~~~~~~~~~~
A warm hand palmed his shoulder blade and John buried his face deeper into his pillow stifling the strangled sob that broke free. Wordlessly, Sherlock moved closer, pressing his body up against John’s back, strong arms wrapped around his upper chest and held him close.
After John finished wrapping Sherlock’s leg, the alpha shifted to seat himself near Sherlock’s waist.
. Mycroft angrily thought as he canceled out of the video feed, no longer able to bear witness to the painful sight.
"Where are you going?" The desperation in John's voice had Sherlock snapping his head up and meeting the omega's stare, though he knew nothing good could come of it.
Going to impale your little womb with my seed.”
"Don't do it." Mycroft demanded of the consultant.
When Sherlock was positive the alpha was too far gone in his sleep to notice his return, he left his mind palace and slowly turned his head to stare at the slumbering man. The alpha looked peaceful in his sleep and that pissed Sherlock off.
Then they’d been called to assist their new client Henry Knight. John thought the man was a complete nutter, but surprisingly Sherlock wanted to take the case. John was worried Sherlock might believe their client’s story, but Sherlock reassured John he wanted to disprove the notion of a Great Hound’s existence.
"I said, shut up!"
“No… You’re joking.”
John sat listlessly in his red chair, within 221B, staring out the window vacantly. Sherlock remained unmoving, seated across from him in his leather chair, hands folded, the tips of his fingers pressed at the edge of his chin in his famed thinking pose, analyzing John.
, nnn—how are you this submissive?” John wondered in disbelief and awe, breathing laborious, torn between watching Sherlock sucking him off, lips bruising red, saliva dribbling from the sides of his mouth and to Sherlock’s hand quickly and fervently jacking himself off.
“John.”
John rose from his chair, Mycroft wasn’t leaving, and the more he said the more devastated John became. He couldn’t do this. He needed to leave and so he did. He stepped outside of the room, walked down the hall of the clinic, out of the building and kept on walking, nowhere in particular, but needing distance. Distance from Mycroft, distance from his workplace, his life, and the paining realization that he was about to lose everything that mattered to him. The one person he’d loved for so long, who he’d wanted to remain with till the very end, the man he’d opened himself up to and loved with all his heart, Sherlock.
That wiped the act of perplexity away. Sherlock's heart stuttered, before there came a vice-like grip, seemingly meant to crush it.
Mr. Holmes ate his breakfast more than he stared at John, but Mrs. Holmes grinned happily at him, obviously pleased he had a healthy appetite. John scowled, something about the way she looked at him made him feel ill at ease, and it seemed that she was always appraising his value. His healthy appetite seeming to be another sign that he would take good care of his litter once impregnated.
When their doctor had asked if they'd wanted to know how many pups they'd be having, John had answered, no. They'd talked about it before their appointment and John wanted it to be a surprise. All they wanted to know was if they'd be having both genders or one specific gender, and they explained that to their doctor, who reassured them that she'd let them know when it became clear enough to identify.
“I’m a doctor. Let me come through. Let me come through, please. No, he’s my husband. He’s my husband. Please.”
“Oh, um, that’s nice, I suppose…” John stuttered unnervingly, knowing he wouldn’t.
“What does he think he’s doing?” Sherlock asked himself aloud, a grating growl rumbling from out of his chest, the alpha within itching to come to the surface.
“I’m sorry, but I will not agree to marry someone I haven’t even spoken to.”
“You smell strange, like acidic medicine. Suppressants I assume.” Sherlock concluded and John winced at the confirmation that Sherlock had truly erased their love from his memory.
“Hi.” the young woman said; her voice was soft, gentle as she stared shyly up at him.
Mycroft, who'd been silently watching the events from the corner of the room, quietly moved to join John at the bar. The smile that remained upon his face since this whole hideous party started widened when he spoke to John. His alpha didn't seem all that pleased to talk to Mycroft.
John stirred the bubbling sauce. Sherlock was seated at the kitchen table, sipping his cup of tea, watching him. John was bustling about the kitchen, completely focused on his work and unaware of Sherlock’s intense stare. Rising to his feet, Sherlock walked over to him. Standing at John’s side, John looked up at Sherlock curiously, yet smiled and spooned a small amount of sauce. Blowing at the wooden spoon and cooling the sauce enough to place some on the palm of one hand, John licked it up and smiled with approval.
“John?”
Taking a deep breath, Mycroft opened the door and walked in, finding one Gregory Lestrade seated at his desk, overlooking a file. His eyes didn't move up from the papers, obviously expecting whoever it was to speak, but Mycroft did not.
"You're a Neanderthal." Sherlock meant for it to be an insult, but John could make out the hint of amusement, faint as it was.
“Still, it’s too cruel. You’re an omega; so many alphas would willingly stay faithful if they were bound to an omega. What can a beta give that an omega can’t give more of? You’re better than any beta. You’re an omega for Christ’s sake!”
Love was one thing… but alphas needed kin. They valued packs and would want their own. Would instinct or love win out in the end? John wasn’t sure. He’d like to think Sherlock’s alpha was faithful, but…he had so many doubts.
Sooner than Sherlock expected searing heat spread through him. His body was suddenly too hot. Slick pooled underneath him, his cum soaked cock swelled with newfound life. Gasping sharply, overcome with the need for his alpha. He was relieved when John groaned in response to his noticeable shift. Sherlock knew his alpha would take care of his need. John’s solid cock rocked teasingly over his own, cooling cum coating their lengths and they slid easily together.
“Sherlock.” John exhaled erratically.
John stilled, trying to follow Sherlock’s words and their meaning, but he was at a loss. Sherlock seemed to find amusement with John being unable to understand his meaning. Raising their clasped hands up, Sherlock pressed his lips to John’s inner wrist in a tender kiss.
“No what if’s Sherlock. I’m healthy. You’re healthy. You’ve been taking such good care of me and I’ve been careful.”
“I… I don’t know how I can fix what can never be repaired.”
John’s nose scrunched up, his cock already having taken attention mid-tasting of Sherlock had hardened completely when Sherlock said—
Sherlock's silver eyes spoke of a complete debilitating desire.
Silence filled John's ear again and he knew he had to try and make a hard situation for both of them better.
“Cheers… What?”
Minutes passed and the alpha remained at a distance. The omega began to perspire, feeling the heat was too much to bear; the omega began to remove articles of clothing. First he removed his button up white shirt, followed closely after by dark denim jeans, socks, and hesitantly his blue boxers.
"All of it?" Sherlock didn't have to see John's face to know that he was smiling.
Sherlock had never so much as hinted to wanting John to leave. Because that wasn't what he wanted. Sherlock felt his heart clench as if held in a vice-like grip. The very idea of not having John by his side had him gasping for air among the hiccuping sobs.
John watched understanding flicker in sea green depths and Sherlock’s tense form relax before he gifted John with a soft smile.
"Before I say anything, understand that it doesn't change anything between us. I still feel as I have always felt for you."
John frowned, but nodded with acceptance.
Weight: 158
"No... No it's not." Mary acknowledged, never one to sugar-coat things. "I... We... knew that this marriage wouldn't last forever. We agreed to divorce after... I... I promise as soon as I give birth we can divorce like you said- I don't wish for your omega to think... I could reassure your omega if-"
"No. She's just your wife, first, and the one having your child. A child I can never give you." Sherlock vehemently spat. The soreness claiming his heart being the root cause of his words.
“John?” Sherlock asked, unsettled by John’s incongruity.
"I also want almonds."
“No. You will be the bond mate to an already chosen omega.”
Sherlock closed his eyes and smiled to himself, a frail, hardly visible one that lasted no more than three seconds before the alpha lowered his head once more.
“John…
“I’m an alpha. I
he came.
“What, An—”
Sherlock wanted John. There was no denying this truth. His heat was only maximizing the need, but it was always there. At least now, in heat, he could acknowledged this freely. Sherlock wasn't trying to stop the progression of what he knew would come. He
"You're not fat Sherlock. You're pregnant. There's a difference. Even if you were, you'd still be the most beautiful in my eyes."
.” Sherlock said his name in
John Watson knew he was an omega since the age of three. Many found him fascinating, being that omegas were rare. The population of omegas in the UK alone was 8%. John didn’t care too much about it, he was young, innocent, and his parents never brought up his status in front of him. The only thing his mother ever said about his status was that he was special and that one day he would understand just how special he was. This made him proud to be an omega.
He kneeled at the foot of the bed and set Sherlock gently onto the comforter. Sherlock shuffled away from John the moment he had the chance and scooted towards the center of the bed.
Sherlock did, finally give in; he’d moved closer to John, observing him from the concern of his eye.
Later in the day, John would give Sherlock his space so he could focus on his work and read a book himself, or relax on the sofa and watch movies. Sherlock would eventually join him, seating himself across from him as he read, staring warmly in his direction until John would set his book down and they’d talk about everything and anything, and the conversations never seemed to falter. There was always something one of them wanted to say to the other and they’d spend long hours just talking and laughing, enjoying each other’s company.
"I'm leaving London. Just... just for a while. I'll come back when... when I'm sure I can love you in the way you deserve."
Clients kept coming and Sherlock kept declining and John was losing his patience with Sherlock’s inability to help, just because they weren’t fascinating.
Sherlock laughed bitterly, recollecting that particular line in William Shakespeare's most beloved play, Romeo and Juliet. When first reading the play, he never could quite understand the pain Romeo experienced, though now, it was all too clear. Only where Romeo’s Juliet loved him, his John would never love him. Sherlock was the thing John despised most, an alpha.
"I hate you,
“You forget, Sherlock. I’m a fan of yours. I read the papers. John can’t give you what I can.”
"You're a right horror." John snickered against the shell of Sherlock's ear and nipped at it, feeling flirtatious.
Sherlock drew John back into his arms, pressing adamant kisses to his forehead, but John went limp in his arms.
“We met at a bar, had a few drinks, played trivia, went back to my flat to have coffee, talked a bit, watched a movie, and then slept on that sofa. It was all innocent, mind you. I slept on the left side and John on the right. We never even touched in our sleep.”
Sherlock slipped deeper within his mind palace. It might be a mess of thoughts, but it was safer than out there in the real world. Less painful than being near that alpha.
John wanted to give Sherlock his space, allow him to grow accustomed to the idea of them being more than what they had been for the last several months. He wanted to give Sherlock the chance to accept him as his mate in every sense, but he also didn’t want to hide from himself anymore. John didn’t want to give to his fears and let that determine everything. John wanted to show Sherlock he trusted him and he trusted himself. He didn’t want to live in fear of Moriarty or anything else.
~~~~~~~~~~~
John paused, staring dumbly at the omega.
"And I you." John smiled softly back.
John morbidly reminded himself, and shut his eyes to hinder the dam of tears threatening to be released.
"Then you and your beta can live happily in that home, which has
“Get out of your place now. I’ll text you a location where a jet will be awaiting your arrival. Don’t waste time, go now John.”
“This isn’t about the case is it?” Lestrade came to infer.
“He’s with me.” Sherlock answered simply, removing his leather gloves in place for latex ones.
Sherlock’s breath caught in his chest, never having expected John to respond so eagerly to his touches. As John shifted his hand in Sherlock's grip so that their fingers folded, interlaced, Sherlock whined.
Sherlock left soon after bearing witness to John's betrayal, because this most certainly was a betrayal. This was a betrayal most foul, because John was telling lies all so he could bond with that... Victor, knowing how Sherlock detested the omega.
Mycroft cared… And he was suddenly reminded of something Sherlock once said to Irene Adler in relation to her love for him.
"I'll think it over. Now, John, may we please..." Sherlock held John's gaze all while he led the alpha's hand low, down the underside of his belly and to the wet crotch of his panties.
Sighing heavily, Mary raised a hand to rake through her hair.
Again silence fell. The two stared at each other; John felt that Mycroft’s gaze was far more piercing, as if he could read every thought running through his mind.
The compliment didn't soothe Sherlock's hurts, because it was all hogwash. Pity was not what he needed right now. "That fault then lies with you. I never promised anything regarding love, because I do not... and will never love you." Sherlock stood from his chair and walked away from the alpha and turned to face the window, looking out at the bustling city, and yet comprehending none of it.
John’s lips twitched once more and he bowed his head to hide the faint smile. Standing to his feet, John tossed the book back onto his seat, shoved his hands in his jean pockets and met Sherlock’s hopeful stare with a glare.
Mycroft's amusement gave way to a sudden and surprising seriousness, "Listen to me, Sherlock. You are an intelligent, reserved man, who lacks the will to openly express feelings. I know... John Watson is not. You torture him daily with your inability to give an inch where sentimentality is concerned and, frankly, John deserves better than you. I feel almost guilty that he won't have an affair."
"I know." John acknowledged sorrowfully.
“Harry!” John whined impatiently.
Sherlock counted with the anesthesiologist, but each number became more difficult to utter as the drugs took effect and as he felt himself slip deep within his mind. The last thing to flash before his shut lids was an image of John. Sherlock relaxed and followed John into the darkness.
"Shhh." John hushed, pressing his nose against Sherlock's scent gland, inhaling him, all while letting his alpha pheromones fill the room.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"I like that you can cook, because we both know I can't."
Sherlock's lip curled up in a vicious snarl, baring the sharpness of his fangs. He detested the name of his husband being spoken so easily by Mycroft.
“Now look. Whatever you’re trying to imply…”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Sherlock didn't fight his alpha when John pulled him in close, allowing him to bury his head against his hard stomach. Winding his arms in a sheltering, consuming embrace around Sherlock's head. A hand moved to rake a calming path through dark curls, while his other curved around Sherlock's shoulders and pressed him tightly against him.
, but Sherlock wasn’t absolutely sure that was it.
.” Mr. Holmes whispered softly.
"You are strong. I like... I like when you carry me. I like feeling your muscles flex against me."
“What is it?”
John choked on spit, realizing what the alpha was actually doing. He’d never seen this, actual mounting of an omega. The alpha’s large pulsing cock ground over the omega’s ass, a muscular arm wrapped around the omega’s lower clavicle and upper chest, holding him close, back hard-pressed to chest, and shoved them deeper against the bed. The alpha’s other hand moved low and guided his cock to the omega’s entrance. With one hard thrust the alpha was inside and the omega went wild, yowling pleadingly.
John suddenly felt sick to his stomach and like retching. John was going to kill her. How could she flirt so shamelessly with his husband when she knew Sherlock was his? Mycroft said she’d broken up a marriage just this year and he had to wonder how many other broken marriages was she responsible for? Would they be added to her list? No. Sherlock wouldn’t… He couldn’t…
want to, but not now. I’ll… I’ll do everything else, but we shouldn’t—” Sherlock struggled to voice, lacing his fingers through John’s own and leaning in close to nuzzle his cheek with fondness.
“John.” Sherlock breathed, grasping a hold of the ties of John’s robe and John followed his guide and shrugged off the robe to be discarded to the floor.
John needed to do something to defuse the situation and now, finding his opportunity with Moriarty momentarily distracted, John moved swiftly, took hold of Moriarty and shouted, “Sherlock run!”
"Mm." Sherlock stared in a daze at the ceiling, suffering from thoroughly-fucked-itis.
That was when he noticed the flashing of light on the hillside once more.
“Always to the point, very Mycroft of you.” John palmed his tired eyes.
John brought Sherlock against his chest, held him close, and nuzzled Sherlock’s cheek.
“Mm.” John hummed again. Sherlock remained deathly still as he’d done when first penetrating the omega, allowing John to make the next move.
How could he accept Sherlock now, knowing what he knew? John had proved himself an unworthy mate. Sherlock deserved better than him. He’d just end up hurting Sherlock again. John was too damaged to openly love Sherlock. John didn’t have the confidence to love Sherlock now, knowing what he knew.
The soreness that struck his heart wasn’t what he’d expected, but at its sudden occurrence also came a paining realization.
“Yes. Later,” Sherlock grumbled.
John’s features hardened and he nodded grateful and without another word he fled from the wordlessly deducing alpha. John’s walk was brisk and full of purpose, purpose of creating distance.
“Wait.” John called.
“John.” Harry admonished.
“About?”
It didn’t mean anything. It was in the past. Bad memories of hateful words followed closely by agonizing violent fists.
Good, Lord what was John thinking?
John knew he had no right to ask, but that didn't change the fact he wanted to.
John shut his eyes and swallowed thickly, accepting Sherlock's words as law, and curled Sherlock's form into his chest, carrying him bridal style to the bedroom where he did as Sherlock bid him to do. When Sherlock fell into a deep sleep, John pulled away from him and curled in on himself, facing Sherlock's slumbering form and staring at his relaxed features. The omega slept peacefully now, but he had been anything but earlier that night.
Sherlock inquisitively retrieved the letter and read it.
The moment John exited the restaurant, he couldn’t seem to calm his breathing, nor stop the tears from escaping then as he stared up at the sky.
John thought Victor was looking for a ring maybe to consider if his friend Sherlock was married now, not because the omega was genuinely interested in him.
"I know that."
"Please." John was desperate to know what the omega was thinking.
John began to wonder…
mate.”
“His fever is rising. I’m afraid he might be going into shock!” Mrs. Hudson blubbered.
“Mrs. Holmes?” John greeted, ill at ease with her unexpected presence, understanding completely why she had come. John wordlessly stepped aside allowing Mrs. Holmes in and she immediately seated herself on the sofa.
“These two have come before you all to affirm their love and commitment for one another…” The priest continued his speech.
“For you to admit that a little knowledge of the solar system and you'd have cleared up the fake painting a lot quicker.”
"Sex is wonderful. John. So very wonderful."
"Yes. Honestly. I really have dreams about you. A lot of them are rather... sordid."
“Sherlock.” John pleaded for Sherlock to answer him.
John didn’t think he’d be visited by a government official so quickly, he’d heard that it took two weeks to have a representative come to meet an alpha submissive.
"Please, Sherlock. Punish me." John spoke, voice rough with emotion.
"It’s just to make you look good even though you behaved like..." It took all of John's strength not to cry, because he refused to show Sherlock he cared more than he let on.
“I admonished you because you are an alpha. I called you an animal. I was so malicious. You showed me kindness and love and I rejected you so many times. I was hateful. I was vindictive. I was inhuman.”
giggled another voice.
"John." Mycroft greeted.
“Why not?”
"Yes, well... My darling John knew I was the omega for him, and we didn't want to wait. I'm sorry it has come as a shock, but love waits for no one."
“I can do that.” Sherlock reassured adamantly.
“Not like you’re around for me to say anything to.”
John bared his teeth and turned away, shaking his head.
“Mine.” John sighed an exceedingly long breath, and nuzzled the bond bite once there was no trace of blood left.
Sherlock... John had pushed away the very man he loved out of anger. His anger was just, but so too should have been his forgiveness in the shape of his love. The love for his mate should have overpowered the anger of Sherlock's lie built out of the will to protect him. Through understanding of their love, forgiveness should have followed. Mary had been right. He did hold Sherlock to high standards, and when Sherlock failed to meet them, John was cruel.
“You’ve been rather vocal today, haven’t you?” Sherlock supposed good-naturedly.
“No.”
“Do you miss me?” John asked what might seem like an illogical question for most, but not to him and hopefully not to Sherlock, because there was a separation between them. Though they lived together, though they were married, though there was no surmountable or physical distance, there was a distance of emotion, of a mental capacity.
“You said I have a therapist.”
“Heather.” she smiled kindly and offered her hand for Gregory to take.
After lunch, John and Mary sat within the living room side by side. Although a part of him felt guilty for his actions, he knew Mary and his pup needed his presence, so he embraced Mary's side and allowed the beta to rest her head against his shoulder while she inhaled his scent.
"Sherlock?" John called again, this time reaching to run his fingers in dark curls.
John immediately noticed the crisp looking pink uniformed button up shirt the woman wore and the nametag that read, ‘Mindy’.
“Liar.” John chuckled.
“Oh dear god, look at the poor man. You don't actually think I was interested in you? Why? Because you're the great Sherlock Holmes? The clever detective in the funny hat?”
“What point?” John was curious.
John must have scented the sourness of his anxiety because he shifted, pressing solidly against Sherlock's chest and ran his hands over the pale arms still wrapped around his waist before the alpha's eyes opened and he rolled in Sherlock's arms to face him.
"About you looking at me when I'm not looking at you?"
Silence followed, it was a lengthy tense silence that seemed never ending. The gentleman seated comfortably in his chair staring perceptively at him, while John stared back uncertainly.
Sherlock was filled with an infinite amount of satisfaction. John knew. Knowing what Sherlock intended to do and watching as Sherlock took steps to enforce it must be intensifying the dread that was building in the alpha.
“I have you now. That’s all that I want.”
“Come here. Sit on my lap and jerk off till you cum on me.”
“I’ll teach you!” Sherlock offered not detoured in the least.
, Viagra couldn’t make him
“I don’t know how to ride.” John frowned, loving the idea, but seeing the impossibility of it.
The dampness of John’s eyes disappeared the harder he clenched his eyes shut, and soon relaxed as sleep overtook him.
When Sherlock was discharged from the hospital, he continued to ignore John and Mycroft. Even when Mycroft arranged a sleek black van to take his whole family home.
His eyes stung, and the racing of his mind couldn't determine the cause, or what it meant until liquid slid past the rims of his eyes and down his flushed cheeks. Tears? Sherlock had no reason to will the tears now. He wasn't working a case in which he needed to manipulate someone into getting what he wanted, and yet the tears came and would not stop, no matter how he struggled to stop them.
Standing within their flat—yes,
“That’s it?” John asked.
John said nothing, clamping his eyes shut tightly.
"I can't! I can't! I can't!" Sherlock wasn't sure what he was saying.
"I am!" Sherlock cried out with annoyance, because no matter how John liked to sugarcoat it, he was in fact an
Sherlock didn’t need to be told twice and swiftly made his way towards John. Removing the blanket from around his shoulders, Sherlock bundled it up messily and discreetly tossed it into the open window of a police car before he ducked under the dividing tape and stood before John.
John stepped towards Sherlock until he stood a mere foot away, and stared up at him intensely as Sherlock assisted in removing his jumper and unbuttoning his shirt. While Sherlock unbuttoned his shirt, John unclasped his belt and undid his trousers. Spanning his arms out, Sherlock tugged John's shirt completely off before he toed his shoes off and stepped out of his jeans.
“Sherlock, what did you do?” John barked out an order and Sherlock flinched before murmuring his answer.
"My John." Sherlock whimpered, squirming with the aftershocks, feeling completely used and unbelievably good.
"You do this for me, or I leave this house again. This time, I might not come back. This time, I might die."
"I can’t... I can’t do it, John. I don’t know how." Sherlock straightened up onto his knees then. "Forgive me?"
John turned away from the mirror and exited his bathroom and made his way to the kitchen.
"Sir, I think you'll find this vintage exceptionally to your liking."
"Oh, yes, John. I will break you." Sherlock moved quickly to stand before the alpha and lowered himself to kneel in front of John. Raising out his hands, Sherlock cupped John's face with both hands and leaned forward until their faces were inches from one another.
John laughed, smiling brightly.
Sherlock was not in shock like this alpha feared. No. Mycroft knew him better than that. Yes, he might be in shock, but it was his disposition and frustrations that caused him to sit in silence and stare blankly at the foreign room's wall.
I just…”
, are you beautiful." John whined, needing to prove it, and palmed the bulge in his pants, unabashedly stroking himself as he watched Sherlock unbutton his pants.
“The kitchen bin.” John answered slowly and not a second later was Sherlock storming pass him and rushing for the kitchen.
"What is it?" John wondered when Sherlock's hands shakily moved to the collar of his shirt.
“Coming?” John asked tenderly when Sherlock had yet to move.
"John." Sherlock whispered shyly, wanting John to look at him again.
"Stop seeing him." Sherlock growled, his head raising up to meet John's stare. Cold blue willing the alpha give to his demands.
"Sherlock?" John's tone was full of care, worried the omega might be in pain and his own hand joined Sherlock's and felt for any sign he'd hurt his mate.
"His wife isn't there. She's gone to her family's to visit them for a while."
-ed’ with a new message from The Women. Endeavoring to convince himself it was only case related, that The Woman wasn’t trying to seduce his husband.
.” Sherlock chuckled roundly, voice trembling on sentiment.
“Tell me you don’t believe this twaddle?” Sherlock incredulously asked.
. I shouldn’t have kept the truth from you, but I was terrified you’d…
“You jealous?”
” Sherlock sobbed in surprise, visualizing the scene John painted.
"I..." Sherlock honestly didn't know what to say and instead looked around at the mess he'd made.
What was it John wanted of him?
John twisted his hand in Sherlock’s loose hold to take possession of it and raise it to his mouth and planted a kind kiss to his knuckles.
Sherlock could continue down the path he’d taken for over a year now, but it was all futile. Mycroft’s intervening and John’s refusal to speak to him by phone, meant there was virtually no way of Sherlock getting in contact with the beta.
"Have you spoken to Victor since that day?"
~~~~~~~~~~~
John sighed and shrugged his shoulders. Any pet name Sherlock wished to call him was more than welcome, because it was proof of his endearment.
“Hamish!” John snarled loudly, causing the two to stare back at him startled into awareness that he was there. “John Hamish Watson, just if you're looking for baby names.” John grumbled, his heart hurt because even as he lay out his joke, he knew it was a possibility. Not that they would name a child after him, but that Sherlock could very well take Irene as his second and Irene would be able to offer Sherlock many children. John’s knuckles crackled as he clenched his fists and glared at the floor.
John flinched when lips pressed against the fresh bond bite, soft lips grazed the tender flesh, but never did anything more than that. John couldn’t seem to relax in the alpha’s hold, even if he wanted to fight his way out of it, it would be useless, alphas were stronger than omegas. This was better than bonding, better than being bred. He just needed to stay still, allow his alpha to scent him, reassure his alpha instincts that John was his. If he did this, it bought him two more months to prepare himself for the dreaded day his heat cycle would begin.
"This was a joke, right?" Victor asked of Sherlock.
"I'm sorry." John murmured, all too easily seeing the connection he had with Victor. He kindly raised a hand to palm the omega's shoulder. John wanted, longed for a mate who would have loved him and yet he'd never have that. Instead he was bound to a omega that rejected him. Victor much like himself had secretly wanted a perfect match and had even sought out submissive alphas in pursuit of happiness, failing as John had.
“Thought it might break the ice a bit.”
It was a quarter after 10:00PM, when John made it back to the flat. He didn't want to come home later, as he knew Sherlock would be waiting up for him. The omega would make excuses for being there when John came back, but John knew it was all because Sherlock didn't want to admit to the real reason. The realness of how Sherlock cared for John could not be doubted now. Not after Sherlock had confessed so much that night in relation for his ability to carry sentiment for another person.
“I want a divorce, but because I’m an omega, I must stay married to you.”
These were his final moments and John couldn't help but think about life, how everything had brought him to this point. Brought him to Sherlock and made him feel some of the worst pain in his life. Had made him learn what love was. And learn how deeply the loss of one you love could cut.
Sherlock scoffed at the notion.
"He's your husband and mate."
"You're beautiful too, John." Sherlock murmured shyly. How someone who'd just been talking dirty could blush like a virgin was a delightful surprise.
“I… What’s the percentage for people like me getting pregnant again?”
“Get out.” John jerked his hand out of Sherlock’s hold.
Sherlock told himself it was just plain curiosity that drove him to want to know more about this omega. As he sat in his bed later that night shifting through the many papers placed before him, he began storing away the information within his mind palace.
“Breed me."
Only his smile quickly faded when he realized Sherlock had deserted him. Left him alone at the crime scene to figure out his own way back to the flat. Bloody git.
Mycroft quickly opened the folder, reading rapidly, he flipped through it until his face was nearly as white as the pages.
"Sherlock?"
“It’s fine.” John found himself consoling despite trying not to. Sherlock should feel hurt. Why did he feel the urge to soothe the jerk?
"I needed you and you just..." Sherlock's body trembled with his words, breaking their gaze at this sudden admission.
. Right there, John!" Sherlock choked out, hands snapping out and gripping insistently to the wrist of the very hand stroking that hard knob within.
"Really?"
“It’s lovely.” Sherlock mused, his smile softening, eyes seeming all the more open.
Heated breath tickled the fine hairs at the nape of John’s neck and though he hated to admit it, it felt nice; the brushing of soft lips that glided over the tender skin there caused a full body shiver.
“To your family you’re the stoic strong alpha. To the NSY you’re detached, snide, and cynical. With me… you’re open, vulnerable, passive, generous—confusing. With everyone your brilliance is always present and there is an innocence to it that makes me wonder if you’ve always been so… so uniquely fascinating…and what the hell am I even saying?” John laughed at his own idiocy.
“Um. Hm.” John swallowed back the tears, the whimper that wanted to be released, and the pain of knowing he’d failed.
“It’s just a migraine.” John voiced unsteadily, his hand vacillating when he palmed his forehead and tried to calm the raging thoughts.
"I'm sorry, but why do you care? I'd think you'd want me to stay away from him."
“He’s an alpha.”
Sherlock continued to evaluate John’s shift, and John noticed the very moment something seemed to click. John’s brows furrowed with confusion when the alpha’s shoulders slumped and his head lowered guiltily.
. . .
“John?”
"Sherlock... Don't make me do this." John was desperate. Sherlock couldn't be this callous. He couldn't possibly have John...
"I certainly have not. You are my omega, and I... You know how I feel, but I know you don't wish to hear those words. Because I feel this way about you, I kindly keep those feelings to myself, but it doesn't change what exists in my heart."
John amended his resolution then. He’d be Sherlock’s omega, birth him kin, and raise their family. Have a purpose with his job and the freedom most omegas didn’t and he would show Sherlock his appreciation for this through companionship—friendship. John could make their arrangement work. Friendship was something he could handle and it was apparently all Sherlock wanted of him. He most certainly had his fill of betas out there.
"I'm sorry. You... I.... never meant... I will make things right. I will heal your mind and maybe... maybe you will forgive me once I tell you--"
“Hmm?”
"I'm so sorry--"
"Who says I can't let someone in? I'll have you know that the only thing that this experience helped me realize, was that I can never trust an alpha. I actually called you in today to tell you to move on, because I have."
Mycroft didn't buy it and sent him a warning glare.
Moriarty grimaced at the show of emotion from the alpha.
"You're unusually silent." John observed aloud.
"I... I'm sorry." John met wet silver eyes.
change that… no matter how much I wish I could.”
“I…” Sherlock still tried to voice his thoughts, but wasn’t able to project them.
"We've been trying for so long, I just thought... Oh, but that doesn't matter now. I will need to get a science kit for the little lad." Sherlock thought aloud, pure excitement.
“Sherlock.” Mycroft groused from beside him, a deep frown across his face, noticing the change.
Sherlock arched forward, seating himself up fully then, bowing low over John, panting hotly over him. John released Sherlock and raised his head up, facing Sherlock’s chest and staring up at Sherlock’s closed eyes. Sherlock was so close to him, bending himself into a tight ball, all Sherlock needed to do was lower his head just slightly and he could kiss John.
“Sure?”
“Sher! Oh! Oh, Sherlock!” John whined, biting savagely against his bottom lip.
"Tell me." Sherlock's voice was tight, wound up by the many thoughts that ran through his chaotic mind.
"In my mind palace he reigns supreme. I can't enter a room without him there. I see him when I sleep. I see him when I wake. I see him when I work. I can't. Mycroft... I can't do it anymore."
The worst thing a couple could do after such a loss was to draw away from one another; it was the first step to separation. Right now, John had to be open with his alpha in order to save their marriage. An omega separated from their alpha… it worried Ella. John was so stubborn and closed off normally, that if he were to push his alpha away right now, she suspected it wouldn’t be long before the omega within John lost itself to grief. Omegas never lived long after separating from their alphas. Some might think it poetic that an omega was so connected with their alpha that if they separated or the alpha died first, the omega would soon follow, but to Ella it was a travesty. Omegas were so rare and sensitive beings. They were better than any alpha or beta, because when they bonded they bonded with all their heart and soul. John and Sherlock needed to work beyond this and Ella would strive to help them.
"I just wanted things to be like they were before. Not the... Not that part of our marriage, I understand I'm not what you want, but still... We were really good friends. Friends since childhood."
"Easy. You." Victor flirted, unashamed.
Moriarty found great pleasure in Sherlock's turmoils, because though his facade of unflinching composure remained, Moriarty was a genius much like himself and he
“Maybe.” Sherlock huskily admitted.
"I... was... trying to be... with him and he's made a fool out of me."
As he moved through his home, Mycroft was reminded of one particular conversation he’d had with Sherlock not so long ago, before he’d been blindsided with the hope that was Gregory.
John nodded with acceptance and held so strongly to Sherlock, he never wanted to let him go.
John shook his head and guiltily stared up at Sherlock, seeking acceptance and understanding.
“For a case?” John asked, needing to be sure.
“Like?”
John stared blankly at the alpha. He'd felt it, but he had thought... He wasn't sure what he'd thought, but it hadn't been that Sherlock was trying to comfort him.
John's mouth was suddenly gone and in its place came the harsh blowing of air.
"Now this is how it's going to work. When I call you over you are going to listen to every request I make. You are not to mention anything about our personal lives, because when I call you over that is when we will play our roles. I will be the master and you will be my slave. To the viewers we will seem like a BDSM couple. You, my slave, will be obedient and not contradict anything I do or say. You will degrade yourself in the eyes of this camera and you will play your role well. You will love it. You will accept all my cruelty with need and the viewers will remain none the wiser. Am I understood?"
was. It was just something he didn’t think about doing… not anymore—certainly not after he’d been shot by the sniper… The idea of bonding… mating… It would be a painful reminder of his inadequacy as an omega now.
Sherlock’s hand lowered from his eyes, but the alpha’s gaze was fixed on the wall at his side. As he neared the bathtub, John noticed Sherlock breathing heavily from his mouth as if not willing to scent the omega. John shook off the thought and leaned over to retrieve the outstretched tea cup.
John laughed at his folly before retrieving his own room key and opened the door across from Sherlock’s room. A nice warm bath sounded just about right to John, it was the perfect way to soak away his aches from their rather exerting trip.
“Thank you. Sherlock’s been trying too. They haven’t come near the flat since I was first discharged from the hospital.” John tried to remain optimistic, but it was difficult when he knew why Mrs. Holmes truly came.
, but he chose not to speak, because he knew if he even attempted to, he'd give way to sentiment. He was just a fraction away from bursting and he didn't want to give John the satisfaction of seeing just how emotional he could make him.
“Can you see them?” Sherlock asked.
Sherlock dipped his head, resting it against John’s inner thigh and surprised himself when a snort of hilarity dispelled from out of him. Hissing his soft laughter at John’s complete idiocy, Sherlock raised himself back up to lay beside his omega and smiled over at the naked fool.
Sherlock pulled away enough to press John by the shoulders until he lay on his back. John opened his eyes and stared up in the darkness of the room. The city lights from outside their window providing enough illumination to make out the faint traces of Sherlock’s fond smile.
“Well now, the tour, yes?” Mycroft suggested, infuriating smirk still ever present as he rose from his chair.
John wanted to be filled over and over again, until he was stuffed full, and then he wanted
“I don’t count. What I’m trying to say is… if there’s anything I can do—anything you need, anything at all—you can have me. No, I just mean. I mean, if there’s anything you need, it’s fine.”
Mycroft knew that if he truly wished to accept Gregory’s affections there was nothing truly stopping him from doing so. Only, Mycroft couldn’t. Gigi was too important and he knew he couldn’t replace the place in his heart where Gigi resided with someone else.
"I flirted with her to obtain valuable information."
Sherlock whimpered, pressing his head harshly against the pillow under him as his cock pulsed within snug lace, dampening him further in his seed and slick.
for his suppressants, because otherwise, Sherlock didn’t think he’d have the ability to refuse.
." John cursed.
“What?”
Sherlock tried to get into it, but John’s emotional overload was sending him in so many different directions and he was truly stumped.
John knew it didn't necessarily amend his faults and wrongs of doing this one thing, but this one thing he needed, and Sherlock was allowing it, though it didn't make it easy on his husband.
Other times, John would enter the bathroom as Sherlock showered, readying himself for the day. John would enter the shower and spoil Sherlock’s efforts of cleaning himself, and then they’d wash each other, hands fondly stroking at flesh, Sherlock nuzzling John’s neck and kissing him, pleasantly surprised by his gift.
John lowered his hands and found Sherlock staring at him from across the room, body trembling erratically, breathing unsteady, eyes shimmering pools of need.
“You're not so bad.” Irene teased fondly.
"Yes. I went to the gynecologist to confirm it. I'm seven weeks."
John stared at the man before him completely stunned; he could hardly believe Mycroft had done so much for him. Mycroft and John didn't get along all that much, but the man was trying to help him and though he was cold and ordered him around in a way that John didn't like, this... John hadn't thought this was possible.
“What?”
“How did you get here before us?” John questioned, taken aback.
“I don’t think you’ve ever dated. You don’t seem like you even know how to flirt.”
John scanned the room, gaining his bearings. The room was spacious, larger than his living room and dining room combined. This was now his room, his home, and John loathed it. Hated the elegant oriental carpets, the fine wooden furniture, the luxurious bed covered in silk-like pricy dark blue comforter and sheets, it was all detestable.
“Just get it over with.” Sherlock sniped.
“I hate you. I could never love an alpha.” John shoved Sherlock away and finally walked passed the trembling, sickly pale man.
John stared down to the floor, the silence grew too long and John felt a great need to leave, save what was left of his pride.
Gregory Lestrade lived a sad, lonely life. Even after he got married, he still felt alone. Jean was a wonderful woman, but not without her faults. If he was being truly honest with himself, Gregory had proposed to Jean out of a sense of obligation.
Sherlock smiled genuinely and nodded in concord.
"Don't call me anymore."
“Sherlock! What a surprise, I haven’t spoken to you in a while now. How are things?” Mike asked kindly.
“And you can’t withhold evidence. And I didn’t
“Please John, let go. Let it all go.” Sherlock spoke at last, his words startling John.
John stared at the ground and exhaled weakly.
Sherlock spurted another load within, keening and filling John up. Jolting pulses of come filled him up to the brink, and fertilizing more of his eggs.
“I’ll try…”
John met Sherlock's eyes and knew he couldn't listen to his omega's demands this time. He'd be unable to enter Sherlock without at least
“Do you…” John abruptly started speaking, Sherlock’s fixed stare out the window broken then, and pale blue eyes scanned his features, attempting to read his unvoiced thoughts.
Slamming the metal kettle onto the stove, Sherlock turned on John with a hard glare upon his face.
Ducking his head shyly, John slung a small suitcase onto the foot of the bed, opened it and retrieved a stack of undershirts before heading to the drawer. John placed all his undershirts in the third drawer and beside Sherlock’s pajamas. His briefs were then positioned to one side of the second drawer, next to Sherlock’s boxer-briefs. The first drawer was stuffed with Sherlock’s pristine, superior socks. John frowned when placing his generic store-bought cotton white ones.
“John!” Sherlock rushed for him.
Sherlock smiled weakly and John knew it then. This was far more than Sherlock was comfortable with, too much would overwhelm him. John shut his eyes and nodded in conformance. Sherlock wasn’t ready for what all of this would mean, but from what Sherlock had already confessed to, he’d come far. John could wait. He could be patient for Sherlock and when he was ready, Sherlock would make it known.
"I..." Sherlock was unsure what to say. John always surprised him. His eyes fluttered closed the moment John's hand wrapped around his cock, squeezing it on an upward stroke, sending his body vibrating with the pulsing pleasurable trills that overtook him.
"I need you to care for me, because I don't, and I love you for that."
Sherlock flushed a warm pink and looked away, staring out the restaurant’s window.
"Don't leave." Sherlock whispered, head bowing low, clasped hands rising up to press against his forehead as he leaned forward and dipped low in his seat.
John inhaled sharply and turned his head to face Sherlock, palming Sherlock’s face with his hand, his bloodied hand staining flawless pale skin, John pleaded, “Sherlock… Our pups, you promised, save our pups.”
John's smile widened and he shook his head, 'no.'
"Wrong?
Possessiveness, Sherlock never appreciated the idea of a possessive alpha and yet, now being at his most vulnerable, his omega side ebbing its way out, it felt... reassuring. Hearing that he belonged to someone, and that someone being John, Sherlock couldn't deny the warmth that spread. The vibrating pulsing of need that consumed as he realized he
“Let's go inside. It’s turned rather cold.”
"I do like you!"
“Could you put something on please? Ah, anything at all. Napkin?” John forced out through a scowl, hating that Sherlock kept scanning The Woman, trying to read her.
"We'll see. Now answer my question, because I need to know. Was it just betas? Or did you have them all, alphas, betas, and omegas? Are you that much of a whore that you have no preference?"
Gregory took a calming breath and raised out his hand, staring hopefully up at the alpha, worried he might have pushed too much. Mycroft stared at his hand warily, before he hesitantly took hold of it, and gradually allowed Gregory to pull him back and seated himself on the couch.
It was the only thing he could think to say.
Mycroft wasn't rash and Sherlock knew before that happened, the older Holmes would be certain of John's character. Whatever files Mycroft recieved on the alpha wouldn't be enough proof of character. John would have to earn Mycroft's trust if he were to give the alpha full access to Sherlock's money.
“John! John! Save him, please,
"So you're going to go yell at him?"
Lowering his pelvis, John's engorged cock weighed itself heavily against Sherlock's, small in contrast, cock. Sherlock's eyes shut, lips parting in a voiceless cry as John ground down, the hard rigidness of his girth compressed around the length of his own.
John closed his eyes, inhaled a shaky breath and stepped into view, staring at Sherlock helplessly, jaw tensing with the severity of their situation.
Sherlock didn't have to explain himself, John could scent the strength of that yeasty sweetness. Sherlock's pants were most certainly soaked, and, placing a hand between Sherlock's legs, at his rear, eliciting a pitiful whimper, John felt the dampness of cloth. His point was proved when he removed his hand and rubbed his fingers together.
"Then I can play you some music and maybe you could read to me from one of your horrid romance novels."
Sherlock awkwardly cleared his throat.
"No. I was going to say, 'Don't be snide,' as we both know you can be," John frowned.
John wasn’t sure when he’d fallen asleep, but he’d been aware that the alpha remained awake as his eyes became heavy towards the early hours of morning. When he woke later that morning, he was alone in bed, and he frowned with annoyance as he could still scent the alpha on him. Rising from the bed, John headed straight for the bathroom, needing to shower and wash off as much of the alpha’s scent as was physically possible.
“You’re doing wonderfully. Soon you’ll be able to ride with me.”
Mycroft pursed his lips and sent Sherlock a look that clearly said the answer was not needed as it was obvious
"Sorry." Mycroft spoke. "I'm sorry, I just... That.... I..."
John." Sherlock hissed with narrowed eyes and John barked with laughter.
Mycroft had taken Sherlock’s John, and his alpha could not bear the idea of never seeing John again. He knew he could never find John now, not with Mycroft still alive and able to counter every pursuit he would make in search for the one person that meant everything to him.
“Beautiful Sherlock, look so young, want to breed you, fill you with my pups. Be so beautiful pregnant,
Later... Later when his wit returned, that was when he'd fully comprehend all and what it meant. Not now. All he could think of now was John.
"From what the file says, it would seem that you suffered a panic attack... I think we know better. Though, I do believe you are still in denial."
John raised a hand out and palmed Sherlock’s cheek, thumb gliding over Sherlock’s lips. John was taken aback when a tongue darted out and swiped the pad of his thumb, before nipping at the tip, light and playful.
John didn’t change within the privacy of the closet or bathroom as he normally did. He changed in clear view of Sherlock, strange. John discarded the towel in the hamper in the closet then slipped into the bed.
“Why don’t you practice aloud when you’re alone? Say all you want to tell him and keep doing so until you feel sure of yourself and when the moment presents itself, tell him. Remind yourself that you deserve this happiness, that Sherlock deserves the reassurance of your feelings, and tell him all you wish to say. I am confident you will be able to do this.” Ella encouraged.
John shut his eyes, because Sherlock didn't have to tell him he missed him or wanted him back, he could hear the longing in his voice. Ten months without seeing each other was destroying them.
"Fuck, I can't! I can't." Sherlock berated himself, but then ignored the logical sense that warned him he was going too far, and removed the pillow partially suffocating him and hurriedly set about removing his slacks, followed shortly after by the rest of his clothes.
“Cleared off before we got here, but a guy like that would have had enemies, I suppose. One of them could have been following him but…got nothing to go on.”
"He entrusted me to keep him safe as well as you. I read his letter, John. He told you to not look for him."
"No."
ways of getting Sherlock to cry out a mantra of his own,
The alpha looked at Sherlock with grim determination and took a step forward, breaking their distance. His mouth parted and his fangs slowly descended from his mouth and Sherlock roared with protest. Thrashing in the agents hold, but it was useless. They were all alphas, and he was only an omega. How could he fight off four alphas? It simply could not be done.
John’s eyes were just shutting; hope of another dream in his heart, when there came three sharp insistent knocks on his door. Tired dark blue eyes opened and stared over his folded arm to the door ten or so feet away and he quietly contemplated ignoring it, hope that the person beyond it would leave him to his wallowing in peace, but then another three knocks followed, louder now and all the more insistent.
John sometimes worried if maybe all of this was too much for Sherlock to handle, that a small part of him might resent the fact he was pregnant, but that fear had been disproven just the night before.
“Oh let me guess, I get killed.” Sherlock drawled unimpressed; it would not be the first, nor the last death threat he received.
Irene pulled away at John’s presence, clearly scenting his irritation and sat herself in a chair across from Sherlock. She eyed him as if he were a piece of candy. John wanted to grab Sherlock and drag him out of the home and force Sherlock to drop the case. John’s omega growled within, territorial and protective of what was his, and Sherlock was his damn it.
"I won't." John cut in with firmness, smiling wildly against the skin of Sherlock's scent gland.
Sherlock tensed, unsure what to do or say. Staring wide-eyed at the alpha breaking down with joy, he could only imagine how much worse it would have been if he'd chosen to abort his pregnancy. He knew, watching the alpha nuzzle his legs and keen happily, he'd made the right decision. John would be a wonderful father. He'd offer their children what Sherlock lacked. Who knew, maybe overtime he would amend his faults and become a sufficient enough mother for their children.
"I'm sorry I hurt you. I was in the army for so long and I was lonely. I just wanted to fill that loneliness until I found you."
"I... Please, understand, don't call me again."
“Mycroft wait, please, you missed an important part.”
"I... didn't realize. Sherlock didn't realize it either. He... was desperate to move on and he couldn't do that thinking of you." Mycroft began and John felt dread take root, understanding beginning to flare.
"I love you, Sherlock." John rasped, his tears falling freely, unchecked and dampening Sherlock's expensive slacks.
“Please… Return them. Give me back my pups. Return our pups!”
“H— H— Heat.”
"John. John. John. John. John. John," was all John could hear, from a voice that left him feeling as if he were still in the pit of fire. That voice haunted him in his dreams and here it was again, and there was no running away from it.
John opened his eyes and turned around, collecting his food and placing it on the kitchen table, ignoring the bloodied human fingers in a plastic bag set out near him, John focused on eating his food.
Alpha.
John smiled, tilting his head in voiceless question and Harry elaborated with a twinkle in her eyes.
“I thought you’d never ask.” John wrapped his arms around Sherlock, closing his eyes and enjoyed the way Sherlock accepted and held him back with equal need.
“Stop it, John. Trust me. Please.”
The coarseness of John's pubic hair brushing and tickling his sensitive skin at every downward motion of his hip. His fingers smoothed over the alpha's chest hair, fondly petting it, never breaking eye contact with a flushed faced John. It felt good. Really good.
Sherlock frowned and deliberated how best to go about dirty talking with his husband.
Sherlock felt his eyes flash with anger at the alpha's words. He wasn't playing his role appropriately. Releasing his hold on the alpha's cock, Sherlock shoved the man harshly off of him. Gripping to the alpha's shoulders, Sherlock shoved him down lower.
John broke their kiss with several short wet pecks, the last a suckle of Sherlock's bruised bottom lip.
“Where do you think our clients come from?” John countered Sherlock’s question with his own, feeling victorious by the look Sherlock sent his way.
John wasn’t all that dominating a person. He was an alpha submissive; domination was not inheritably in him. Deciding to give just a bit more, John tipped his head, lowered his eyes to Sherlock’s feet and slackened his shoulders, submitting to his omega.
“I do.” John chastely kissed Sherlock’s smooth lips, exhaustion taking hold of him.
“We’re married…mated. I don’t want to live my whole life carrying this anger.” John admitted truthfully and stared back up into those intense eyes. “You said you would try, so I’m saying the same.”
Sherlock merely stared, taking in the slight rising and falling of the alpha's chest. Watched as his breaths grew quicker and less measured. Pleased at the sight of John eyeing him with trepidation. Every so often his gaze would lower to the omega's lap and the bag that rested there. Full of things John was unsure of, but rightly fearful of.
No words left John’s lips as he stared at his alpha, his husband, who’d loved him for fourteen years. Who’d protected him and watched over him in secret for so long. Sherlock had always been there and John never knew. He never realized the deepness of Sherlock’s feelings, but now that he did, he knew he couldn’t lose him.
Sherlock said nothing, staring with fascination and with intrigue at the omega; he couldn’t muster up the words filling his mind.
"It could take a while." John warned with a kind smile that Mary raised her head to return.
. John had long ago labeled Sherlock's omega sweetness, but this... This was entirely different. That soft, light sweetness had turned strong, almost musky. Sweat, salty and pungent layered over it. The wave of omega sweetness sent John stumbling back and into the door, effectively shutting it behind him as his senses clouded.
“The same old…”
“No, John.
"Sherlock, please, don't. This won't help you. My past sexual experiences hold no grounds in our relationship. I will never be with anyone else. I swear, I won't betray you."
“What about when you get older? You’re so young, Sherlock. You don’t feel the importance yet, but you will. You will want children.”
“Jesus, I’m a fool.” John chuckled bitterly, rearing back and away from Sherlock’s caress to angrily wipe away the hot tears himself.
"Get out! OUT JOHN!" Sherlock's voice broke on the strangulated octave it reached, and more crashing of kitchen appliances followed.
Pale fingers dug into the sheets, gripping tightly. Trembling legs parted further, strained at their limit. Heels dug into the bed all while a chest fluctuated with erratic breathing. Moaning deep from within his chest, Sherlock pressed his head further against the pillow, his belly blocking his view of John. But he could still feel him.
John forced himself to eat the rest of his meal, unable to speak anymore, and still felt Sherlock’s eyes on him, staring suspiciously. John felt momentary reprieve when Sherlock’s attention refocused back out the window.
“I was so close this time.
"I love you." John wailed and then there were strong arms around him, wrapping around his own and holding tightly to him.
wearing it!”
“I must be mad, because I think you’re absolutely stunning in whatever you do. I think I like watching you drive more than I like staring out at the scenery.”
"You really are a fool."
“Nervous.” Sherlock smiled kindly, his other hand moving to join his left in threading in John’s hair.
" Sherlock wailed, his scream a horrific cry of desperation.
“Kill you? Eh, no. Don't be obvious. I mean I'm going to kill you anyway, someday. I don't want to rush it though. I'm saving it up for something special. No, no, no, no. If you don't stop prying, I will burn you. I will burn the
” Sherlock growled, rage building and before he knew what he was doing, he’d knocked away all his hard work splayed out on the study table and upturned the desk.
Sherlock didn't have the right to look at him like that. He didn't have the right to stare at him with tearful eyes and make John desire nothing more than to hold him and give and receive comfort.
John chuckled heartily and Sherlock’s smile was endearing.
“Why are you so quiet? Don’t you want to make up more excuses?”
"My mother was on her death bed, you see, when she asked me to marry Mary. I couldn't refuse her when she was like that. It was her dying wish. I married Mary and my mother didn't die. She got better - I think it was seeing us wed that gave her the will to live a bit longer. I couldn't register for you then. My mother would have died from the shock of it."
“Sorry, mum.” Sherlock snarled; breaking eye contact with Mycroft and only after did his sights land on John, who stood hesitantly at the entry.
There came a clearing of a throat and muffled laughter, and John finally remembered where he was and that Harry and Clare were watching them. John's face felt hot as Sherlock gently pushed him away, far enough for modesty, yet still close enough that his arm hung loosely around John's middle.
.” Sherlock’s eyes filled with anxiety.
I look at you." Sherlock snipped.
“Is he…Your husband, is he a nice man?”
“Sherlock!”
Without warning, John shoved Sherlock onto his back and straddled his waist. Sitting there, he felt the solidness of Sherlock’s cock nudging the cleft of his ass.
“Sorry.”
Sherlock felt the press at his womb. Not hard, a soft nudge at it and fuck. Sherlock's belly gave a roll and the omega whimpered, the babies were moving and John kept coming. Lighting fire between his legs. His cock was fluttering, straddling the line of full on bliss. His entrance quivered around the girth of John's cock laying waste to his sensitized hole.
“Is your husband… seeing someone else?”
Pacing the floor of the living room, Sherlock carded his fingers through his hair and strived to find another solution.
John's wet eyes looked up to find a softness in silver that had not been there before. Sherlock appeared tired, his shoulders awkwardly slouched, eyes as soft as before, and carried a hint of affection.
John followed the silent alpha out of the large living area full of guests, to a long hall and up three cases of stairs, all the while John struggled against his alpha’s hold, yanking at his hand and attempting to free himself, but his alpha did not release him. For a man who was lean, the alpha was extraordinarily strong and no matter how much of a fight John put the alpha’s hold never faltered.
John glared at his phone, realizing Mycroft was always watching.
money was money he'd received with his lies, and if he wasn't using it for the home or for Sherlock, John wouldn't touch it.
“You.” Sherlock hoarsely sighed and John pulled away with astonishment.
Throwing off the sheets with a heavy grunt, using much of his strength to move the heavily thick duvet, John panted with exertion and reached for his mobile resting on the bedside counter. Hurriedly dialing a number, John waited for an answer.
What in the bloody hell was Sherlock even doing right now? He didn't do things like this. Watching movies and going out with others. It was foreign. Something not like himself. Neither the him of before, nor the him of now. This was out of his comfort zone.
Sherlock removed his shirt from under the comforter and slipped it on and smiled back at John. This was surprisingly less awkward than he thought it would be. John was an understanding man and Sherlock wasn't much one for being in touch with his sexuality, but this, for the time being, this could work.
"Have any preference?"
“We were never more than… than…
“When I was ten,” Sherlock continued, “I asked my brother to bring me a file containing this person’s private information, things about what they were like, what they did, what kind of person they were.” Sherlock paused, never breaking their gaze as he outstretched his hand and laid his large one over John’s.
A deep, sardonic laugh dispelled as he slowly made his way to his room and he thought further of how thoughtless he’d been.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Mycroft for that matter looked hardly concerned, though John couldn’t understand why. Sherlock must have been home when the explosion took place, was it just him? How was everyone fine with this?
John’s mouth slackened as the petal drew circles along the crown, over and over, delicately, again and again, one, two, three, four, five…
John couldn't see Sherlock's face, but he heard the soft whine in his words. "What are you saying?"
~~~~~~~~~~~~
“Do it.” John baited angrily. “I know you want to!”
Mycroft leaned back to open a drawer in his desk and retrieved a laptop and set it on the desk. The older man once again shifted through the drawer and retrieved four DVD’s in plastic cases and placed them on top of the laptop.
say we were never
How could a bound omega do this themself? It was wrong. Sherlock bit him, the scar on his neck evidence he was mated, yet he’d been rejected. Was this how Sherlock felt every time he’d rejected him?
“Oh, honey, are you alright? You look rather flushed?” Mrs. Hudson worriedly noted of Harry.
Some days off, Lestrade would call Sherlock in on a case, or he would come personally to retrieve him when the situation was dire. Sherlock would always ask John if he’d like to join him, and John usually went along with Sherlock. They’d go all around town, the cases taking them in every which direction, but through it all, John felt the strength of their bond growing.
Sherlock pressed his lips to John’s lips and spoke, tickling him as he did, “Okay. I’m sure I can surmise what it is.”
Sherlock’s swelled pulsing cock resting heavily against his own belly, and John’s thickly engorged alpha cock hard-pressed itself along his, overwhelming Sherlock. He could feel each pulse strum through and against his own. The heat, the slickness of the alpha’s pre-cum, the feel of every grooved vein along John’s length strumming and his mind was suddenly spinning, on the edge of losing complete coherency. Each beat another vibrating zing down to his balls, and —
John's body trembled, unable to control itself, unable to understand what it was he'd realized moments after entering, because that scent was driving him to madness. He felt hot. The humidity of the flat was unusual. Not as it was when he left. It had grown hot. His skin was warm, flushing with the heat. Perspiration took him and then, then he felt wet in a completely different way. He was excited. An erection.
“I’ve had a vasectomy and nodumectomy.”
Pregnancy was making him into a simpleton, because his wit was diminishing, he found himself not caring and wrapped his own arms around John. Tightening his hold, Sherlock yanked John closer to himself and buried his face into the crook of the alpha's neck and inhaled an audible breath.
“Harry needs me. I need to leave you.” John’s voice was husky, sentiment filling his vocals with the despairing pain of truly meaning his last of statements.
Sherlock closed his eyes, and focused on calming his erratic breathing, ignoring the pain in his chest, and the way his eyes stung. Though he wished to think about anything else, images of Lestrade touching John kept making their way into his mind.
“Shut up.” John ordered. Screw the fact he was an omega and should be listening to his alpha. He didn’t want to talk about it, and the alpha wouldn’t make him.
"Sherlock!" John shouted after the omega as Sherlock exited the automobile.
“Come… to Sherrinford. Need… Need to… find Sherlock.” John wiped the sweat running down his face away, he’d never sweat this much and his skin never felt this warm, God, the suppressants had screwed him up bad.
"I was wrong. Maybe... Maybe this marriage could be a real marriage."
“He doesn’t love me.” John sobbed. “My love will remain unfulfilled. Harry my love will forever be unsaid and unwanted! My first and only love…will never be.”
The omega moaned deliriously, a soft smile spread across his flushed sweaty face and the alpha answered him with tender kisses across the expanse of his neck and back. The video ended soon after the alpha’s knot receded and he embraced his omega, scenting him further.
"I'm sorry."
“Sherlock?” John’s voice filled with concern.
“Is it because of the scenting phase? I don’t see why it’s needed. I married him and let him place the bond bite, no matter how many showers I take, his scent will never leave me.” John snarled the last part, realizing this shortly after showering that morning.
“It was a mess.” John teased.
John cupped Sherlock's face with both of his hands and loved the tension of his alpha's brow. Sherlock was the love of his life and they were starting their family. Everything was perfect.
"I won't answer your calls after today." John answered.
When Sherlock played the violin John would watch him from afar. His eyes burning with lust, for the need to be that violin and have Sherlock’s delicately slender fingers twiddle with his body, making him strum out noises of pure enjoyment. John would wander closer to the alpha, until he stood mere inches from him and Sherlock would meet his gaze, still playing, but he’d smile contentedly, as if this was all he needed. As if 221B was their home, the violin their music, and John was his forever. John’s heart would throb and he’d feel great woe, knowing this would not last, that Sherlock had chosen an omega and that soon, this home would be his home no longer. Sherlock’s music would be for another’s ears... Sherlock’s attentions would be for the omega...
Sherlock broke in that moment, hesitation forgotten in the sight of John breaking apart and he was suddenly standing beside the bed near John's head. Falling to his knees, Sherlock bowed lower, pressing his nose against the exposed ear before him, nuzzling against it. A hand reached out and clasped a hold of John’s. Sherlock carded the fingers of his free hand through damp blond hair and cradled the back of his head.
Sherlock Holmes stood at the doorway. A Mexican take-out bag lay on the ground. John's heart constricted painfully as he met tear-stained silver eyes and felt as if his world were crumbling.
John was horny and drunk.
“My parents bought you for me, John. It was wrong. The laws are set up against omegas and I’m sorry for it, but at the same time I was pleased it led me to you and I wanted to ignore the injustice of it, because it gave me you and…
“You don’t have a girlfriend then?” John timidly asked.
"Oh, how you must have laughed. Poor pathetic,
.” John pled, drawing Sherlock up and into his chest where he embraced him caringly, legs parting and welcoming Sherlock to lay against him, heated cock pressed alongside heated cock.
"Good?" John's voice had gone low and rough, and God help him, Sherlock's cock twitched at that sound alone.
John gave a rigid nod and watched as Sherlock spun on his heel and left Angelo’s first. John stood mutely, staring out of the restaurant window as the consulting detective flagged a cab, before entering it and it drove out of sight.
“I want to breed you. Fill you with my pups.” John growled, thrusting his hips against Sherlock’s ass where he sat and Sherlock felt the hardness there.
“You’re  chipper today, aren’t you?”
~~~~~~~~~~~~
John sucked in a hissing breath, biting his full bottom lip and jerked his hips up, cock sliding in Sherlock’s loose hold. Swooping down, John claimed Sherlock’s lips in a hard kiss, full of wet noisy slurps and harsh pants. As soon as the kiss began it broke and John reared back tapping Sherlock’s leg caught between his own and raised his own to give Sherlock enough room to move it from under him. John settled himself between the taller man’s legs and took hold of the back of his knees and shoved them up until Sherlock bent his long lean legs. Sherlock grabbed the pillow as his side and placed it under his lower back for further support and waited for John’s lead.
"Are you... wearing anything under...?"
“Wonderful.” Sherlock grumbled, closing his eyes and thumped his head against the glass window. “Just what I needed.”
Now, however, Mycroft had been proven wrong. This was a lesson he needed to learn. Mycroft grabbed his glass and drank its contents. Exhaling a hiss of breath, the sting of hard liquor working down his throat, Mycroft retrieved his phone and dialed a number. They answered on the second ring.
“What?” Sherlock snapped, seeming unable to say anything else, not pleased with John’s reaction.
"Excuse me, can I help you sir?" one of the female workers asked as she approached him with a smile.
“Why are you saying this?”
“Hmm, pop into Baker Street, who knows, jump out of a cake.”
"I don't wish to possess you, Sherlock, I've only ever wanted to love you! I married you because I fell in love with you. Just one look was all it took. Don't you ever doubt that you are gorgeous."
“Lestrade? He’s our friend Sherlock, of course I do.”
. The omega within purring wantonly with the saturated scent of the alpha’s sex and Sherlock was amazed and terrified when his body trembled in want of it.
John tensed immediately, unable to raise his head, unable to meet the eyes of the possessor of that voice, even when he felt a hand land on his back and begin to massage the tension out of his muscles.
Even if John wanted to cancel the arrangement, he couldn’t. It would mean legal battles, his parents becoming destitute and even more unsettling thoughts. John was trapped and there was nothing he could do to get out of it. Still, John would not conform. He refused to be a sex toy to some rich dolt, who had to pay for breeding him.
"Sorry." Sherlock apologized and that caused his mind to come to a sudden halt. He never apologized for anything he did to the alpha, and he'd done a great many cruel things to him.
John snorted irately and glared up at Sherlock.
“Why?” The woman sighed with annoyance.
Opening his eyes when he felt the weight of the alpha above him lift up, Sherlock stared up at two unknown alphas who were currently struggling to hold back the rabid alpha Sherlock had enraged.
. This was my decision.”
Possessiveness. John pinpointed it in a second, but where he once felt annoyance, he now felt comfort and wasn’t that just the sickest of thoughts.
him to save his sister's life - from what, he wasn't sure. Mycroft had deceived Sherlock into believing John found him through the matchmaking service. John had deceived him with his false love. Mycroft's lie was to save Sherlock's life. John's lie was to save his sister's life.
"It's monstrous."  Sherlock bit his bottom lip, eyes squeezing tight, knowing he was trapped, yet unable to stand the idea of... "I can't."
Sherlock didn’t want to think anymore. He thought more than enough as it was. Now he just wanted to let go of all that was inhibiting him from living in the moment. When they’d finally united, when Sherlock was finally within John, he felt a burst of relief and pleasure. The scent of blood stung his nostrils, and Sherlock’s stomach flopped with the very notion he’d hurt John. Yet Sherlock’s alpha rejoiced, because John
John’s nose felt on fire, the scent of walnuts and coffee filled his overwrought senses and his body lurched, convulsing with the alpha’s scent: Lestrade.
“Talk about something else.” John demanded.
“Somewhat.”
John had tried. He had every intention of confessing to Sherlock, but life had other plans. Soon after his talk with Mary, Mycroft came to visit him. He'd then been told that Sherlock had gone missing several days ago. He'd last been spotted near one of his known danger zones. John hadn't known what to think, but thank God Mary was still there. She'd talked him through all the overwhelming thoughts and feelings that were laying waste to his mind and heart.
John was amused by Sherlock’s reaction. One thing he’d started to notice was that Sherlock didn’t quite know what to do with himself when John became friendly towards him. Sherlock’s voice fluctuated, either too deep or high, his eyes averted directly meeting his and he became withdrawn. Sherlock would pull back to further analyze John’s sudden change in behavior.
"No John. No, no, no! Have you heard his voice?"
Since the morning sickness had begun, the craving for food proved to push back his fast paced life, and everything else that was pregnancy related made life harder - there was not much that could appease Sherlock.
John stared in awe. His cane…
John nodded, jaw clenching at the idea of consummation. That wasn't even an option in his mind. He'd sooner kill himself than preform that heinous act.
Even now it hurt to hear that voice. It made him want to curl up in a ball and scent the alpha, reaffirming that Sherlock was alive and well. But he'd never let his omega out to do such, not with Sherlock, and certainly not after all the lies.
The bacon strip in Sherlock’s hand fell with a clatter against his plate and Sherlock’s features became all the more alert.
“Okay.” Sherlock shakily replied, lowering his head to nuzzle John’s neck and pressed an experimental, open-mouthed kiss to the bond bite.
John rushed home to find Sherlock was already in his room and frowned. A part of him, knowing how terrible it was to want it, but a part of him had hoped Sherlock had stayed up waiting for him. So many nights John had waited up for Sherlock, but his husband didn’t care about him.
John's eyes widened with horror. Sherlock couldn't mean... This wasn't right. Sherlock's mind... This was dangerous. Sherlock needed more help than what he could provide. Something needed to be done or Sherlock's health would further deteriorate. This jealousy stemmed from feeling inadequate, John could see that now. For a time, things were looking up, Sherlock faltered some, but nothing like this. If not for... If not for John's mistakes. If not for the fact Mary was pregnant and they could divorce immediately, Sherlock wouldn't be like this.
, you didn’t deserve any of what I said that night.”
Sherlock's mind spun dizzyingly as new thoughts took hold with the realization that he was irrevocably John's everything. He was fertile. He was in heat. John would knot him and in so doing... impregnate him. John would breed him.
“Mm.” John hummed faintly. He nodded his head, features tensed, knowing it would be okay soon and focused on breathing in slow measured breaths.
“You’re… I never thought confessing would mean you’d treat me like the plague.”
John flushed hotly and looked everywhere but at Sherlock as he spoke.
"The son. You think it's the son. It's not." Sherlock kneeled on the ground and began taking notice of the discoloration of the victim's neck - strangulation it would appear.
Of course he's not the boy's father! Look at the turn-ups on his jeans.”
Mycroft chuckled at the threat. "You sure you want to say that to a man who can break your marriage?"
"I'm so sorry. Sherlock." John's voice trembled, fearfully watching the omega change his clothes, worried he'd fucked everything up for them. That because of him he'd lose the man he loved.
“Go then. I’ll see you back at the flat later tonight… and then we are going to
John had watched porn as a teenager, he’d seen how porn stars had sex—this wasn’t the same as that. This couple kissed, really kissed, their hands roamed over the other’s body with familiarity. When one arched, the other bent close, they were so in-sync.
“Our pups.” John garbled against Sherlock’s chest.
“I’m tired of suffering from a broken heart. Unrequited love is a cruel punishment. I can’t stand it anymore. Time and time again you’ve hurt me, John. I’m tired of being the strong alpha. I can’t do it anymore. I’m so very tired.”
“John.” Sherlock’s voice was overwrought with sentiment, eyes seeming to ask for something, but for one reason or another, he was unable to express what it was he needed.
“I come because I love you.”
Sherlock was ripe in smell. The scent was intoxicating, yes. Beyond that, it was... pure. The scent of an untouched omega was driving his inner wolf mad. All he wanted to do was stain Sherlock with the scent of his essence... embed his seed within.
John bit his tongue as Mrs. Holmes stared at his stomach appreciatively. He knew there was nothing he could do to stop the inevitable, his in-laws wanted pups and in two months time he’d be pregnant with his first litter.
“That has nothing to do with this.” Mycroft edged away, rising to his feet. “Thank you for your time. I must leave.”
"I'm sorry. I just... You were gone for so long and I... I thought you would, and it..." John's words became rounder, more choked, and rough with each word, until he couldn't speak and he shook his head; a tear managed to sneak past his hands and fell down his flushed cheek. Sherlock followed it, saw it glide further, under his chin and drop to John's lap, to be absorbed in the cloth of his slacks.
John hesitated at this request.
“Where is he, Mycroft?” Sherlock asked of the gentleman. He’d done all of this for John, and if he never saw him again… His weakened, broken hearted alpha would surely wither away to nothing.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"Don't stop. Please. Please? I'm so close." Sherlock began begging because that was his purpose. He was to beg, because John had fucked him into submission. He was a pile of begging flesh. "Fuck me. Use me. I need it. I want it."
"So help me Gregory-" Mycroft began threatening, refusing to open his eyes still, because he might be just a fraction too shy to see Gregory after what they'd done.
“Thank you.”
“Sher… Sherlock, what have you done?” John shakily asked, his trembling having started once more with the sudden way Sherlock was behaving. He was… Sherlock was fearful of John’s reaction for something he’d done and John, for the life of him, could not understand what it was. But he was assuredly terrified.
John began counting down from ten, but when he got to four and his rage only seemed to be intensifying, he started counting down from twenty. When he reached six, he felt he could speak somewhat calmly.
"No. I want to see your belly." John answered, catching onto Sherlock's hesitancy.
“Take care of me, do you? You still consider me your husband?” Sherlock sneered.
“Transfer John to my school.” Sherlock demanded petulantly.
The heat of his face spread to his ears at Sherlock answering grin.
John loved Sherlock. He knew that now. This feeling… it could be nothing else. John couldn’t imagine a world without Sherlock and as frightening as it might be, John knew he’d die without Sherlock. Life wasn’t worth living when the one person who made it bearable didn’t exist. So if Sherlock lost his patience with him… If Sherlock finally wised up and realized John was an emotional mess and refused to be strung along anymore… If Sherlock left him, John didn’t think he could handle it.
“Oh god.”
“Shut up. Stop flirting with me and go to your
"It was lust. A new toy for him to play with."
“My parents would like it if we would attend their New Years Eve celebration.”
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Sherlock stood in front of the window overlooking the city, staring out at the stillness. The streets were empty of cars. Most buildings’ lights were shut off as the civilians slept.
When John at last entered Sherlock’s room, it was to Sherlock sitting at the foot of the bed, the rose petals remained, and one lay in his husband’s hand. The consultant fondly stroking at the soft petal in fascination of it and John smiled.
John pulled Sherlock back enough to swiftly grab one of Sherlock’s hands in his own and slid it under his button up shirt and jumper to plant it flat on his belly. Sherlock said nothing, but John noticed the moment comprehension dawned, his mouth went agape and a strangled noise dispelled from his mouth.
John squirmed in the alpha’s hold and grasped a firm hold of Sherlock’s arms, tugging at them.
. I... I don't have any feelings for Victor in that way, but..." John halted in his words, finding it difficult to voice his thoughts in this particular subject.
“You were going to take that damned pill, weren’t you?”
"Leave us alone." Sherlock gave as his farewell and strode out of the room, no care to wait for his discharge papers. Mycroft would handle it. Instead, Sherlock tried not to contemplate what Mycroft had said.
Several moments later the door leading to Moriarty opened and Mycroft entered. For long moments in time the two spoke, words dulled by the separating one way mirror. When they only sat staring at one another, having said all they needed, Mycroft stood and exited the room.
“You’re taking all of me so well. Will you obey every request I make?” John asked voice thickly laced with lust, eyes smoldering with want at the sight of Sherlock staring up at him with such adoration and need.
John laid himself entirely naked on the bed and focused on his other senses. He scented when Sherlock pulled away and heard his soft feet pad along the floor. He heard the opening of a drawer, and noticed the strengthening of Sherlock’s scent as he neared the bed. He felt the dip of the bed as Sherlock sat himself on it once more. Sherlock moved slowly to lay himself beside John on the bed and John nervously awaited what was to follow.
John visibly flinched when he threw his fork to the plate, but the look of apprehension that filled those dark eyes after his command brought with it sense of caution he had never felt in regards to the alpha.
In front of him, John took in the sight that befell him. His father and Harry stood waiting, beyond them across the lush green grass were placed several hundred white wooden chairs. The center dividing the two sections of chairs was an aisle of white and pale blue rose petals. So many, so beautiful, and John could scent their subtle sweetness.
"Hey, don't be like that." John cooed kindly, raising up partly, until he raised up high enough to be on eye level with Sherlock, their faces mere inches from one another that, Sherlock
John stared at it momentarily. Sherlock’s hand was large, his fingers slender, pale and inviting. Staring up into the alpha’s vulnerable eyes, John inhaled deeply. Hesitating no longer, he took hold of Sherlock’s hand, rose to his feet, and offered the alpha back his coat.
. John noticed the bits of release that he managed to cough up mid suck and scooped it all up in his hand and licked at it. Sherlock tasted salty, but yet there was sweetness to it, and John found he rather liked the taste of Sherlock. He most certainly would be doing that again.
“Don’t make fun of me when I get fat.” Sherlock sniped light-heartedly, surprising John into uproarious laughter.
Though John hadn’t cared for the money Mycroft had offered him and thought that discussion was at an end, it would seem not. The amount in his account was jaw-droopingly too bloody much! It was enough money that John could go the rest of his life never working and live in luxury. Hell, it was enough to buy an island… dozens of islands.
Sherlock didn’t say please, not easily, John knew this. ‘Please’ and ‘Sorry’ were words Sherlock said little and only when in relation to John. The ‘please’ of Sherlock’s request made John want to look up even when he was so terribly humiliated.
Even now as a soft rumble of laughter escaped him, it wasn't of pure joy, but it was closer to warmth than he'd felt it a long while. Sherlock liked dark humor, he'd always had a sense for it and John's words brought a lightness to his chest and a tickle to his stomach and it was futile to stifle it back once it was released.
“I don’t.”
Sherlock raised a brow, waiting for John to explain himself.
As Sherlock and Jeff raised their respected pills closer to their mouths, John focused on his breathing, calming himself. Slow measured breaths filling and exiting as he raised his gun, aimed, and fired.
Sherlock sat in his gray leather chair within the living room of their flat, hands pressed together and steepled under his chin, lost in his contemplations.  He’d been aroused? Sherlock masturbated because of John? He’d debased himself with that vulgar act of flesh for John. The last time he’d masturbated — excluding his heat, and from the footage — was…
John left. John left and Sherlock couldn't breathe because he didn't know if the alpha was going to come back.
Sherlock bit his tongue, unsure how to respond. Since their heat everything about their relationship had changed. John wasn't holding back his affections and Sherlock wasn't fighting them off, though he knew he could. A part of him didn't want to. If he did, they'd revert back to the way things had been before, and then... John might go out to spend his time with Victor Trevor. As it was now, John had only visited Victor twice in the last six weeks, which was infinitely better than the three times in a week that had been a normal routine of his mate.
" John closed his eyes for a brief moment, he bit into his bottom lip and before Sherlock could understand, John shoved inside him one last time, pushing himself deep, the swelling of his knot popping past the strained rim, and John stilled his hips, coming undone. The powerful rush of emission coating his most private of areas. Rushing still, powerful in its gushing, Sherlock could feel each pulse, each slide of come pack him. Filling him until he was compact with it, and then
“Please!” John whimpered, squirming, rocking up into his clenching fist, come pouring from the spout of his extensive length and whitening his hand, lubricating his strokes.
This was too much of a cruelty to bear.
.” Sherlock huffed and when the omega tipped his head back and at an angle, nudging Sherlock’s nose against his scent gland, the alpha gave in with a broken howl.
Sherlock’s scowl hardened, eyes narrowed once more, murderous, and John couldn’t restrain the amused laughter that bubbled out of him.
"How bout we make ourselves a plate and watch crap telly for the night?"
“I’m not going to be some
Sherlock didn't know what to say, so he remained silent.
“He said you do that.”
Lying down in bed, John raised the sheets and buried himself under them. Pressing his face into the pillow to silence the hiccupping cries that dispelled as he wept in the darkness of the room he’d resigned himself to sleeping in once more.
“You’ve done so much for me. Please don’t do anymore; I will never be able to pay you back in all my life. Please,” John sobbed softly, pressing his forehead against Sherlock’s lips as the alpha kissed him again.
“Where is he?”
The thunderous growl that protruded from the alpha made the omega in him cower, but Sherlock had learned long ago how to silence the omega within and growled right back.
!” Sherlock screamed, spinning away to prowl the room, glaring murderously in John’s direction.
“I don’t have friends.”
Harry got a job and went to school much like John and the two lived contentedly together for several years. Harry graduated college first, as John decided he wanted to become a doctor and it would take him far longer to finish his education. Harry majored in social science and philosophy and soon got a job at a local college. John was happy for her, but he’d still felt a pang of sadness when she’d decided it was time that she move out of their flat and get a place of her own. Even after Harry moved out the two kept in touch, but it wasn’t the same. They hardly ever saw each other, but they did call and text every few days.
"Well... Just this once." Sherlock agreed.
“Oh sod off. You hardly like eating anyways and I’m too tired to care.”
John truly didn't know what to do... He remained standing near the door and staring at the omega who was still shaking. He didn't want to assume anything, but... It appeared to him at least... Sherlock might be upset by his absence... Scared that he might not have come back and John felt guilt weigh heavily on him, because he'd intended to leave, for a few days, but leave regardless.
John spoke on. Going off on tangents that Sherlock worked hard to follow.
“Good, not many can mount a horse their first try.” Sherlock admired, but John felt as if it were a condescending observation. Sherlock had assisted him the whole way and he wasn’t sure he’d have been able to do so without his help.
Sherlock couldn't do that to John. He couldn't just leave without... without telling his omega how... He just couldn't. This was his last chance. He wasn't going to be coming back. John Watson deserved to know at least this much. He'd destroyed his omega enough as it was and giving him two years of life was a horrendous act against the man he loved, but he was powerless against the governments will.
“What… What about you?” John knew it was a stupid question, but John didn’t have the confidence to return the favor and…and… God, this was all so very strange. They were married—married people had sex. It was a normal occurrence, but their union was everything but normal.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
had, John could say, “Yes, I want all of those things. I want it very much.”
Sherlock raised his hands out, a silent gesture that spoke of needing space all as he took two steps back.
“Sherlock!”
“Uh, who is this?”
“Say it now.”
"Nothing wrong in that dear."
Lestrade paused. Mycroft sounded so formal and he hated it. Regardless of this, Lestrade seated himself and stared across from the voiceless gentleman, waiting for him to speak.
John didn’t want to talk anymore. He wanted to hold Sherlock and kiss him. He wanted to run his hands all over the pale flesh, worship Sherlock’s body, and love him up until Sherlock was drowning in it all. He wanted to bond with his mate.
Sherlock knew that those last few months after his return from the dead had been the hardest on John and he couldn't blame him. Sherlock kept messing up. Even when all he'd ever wanted to do was keep John happy, he couldn't. Sometimes Sherlock wondered if placing John's happiness first had ruined him. In a way it had, but not in the way it mattered.
" Mrs. Holmes hissed, insistently.
"No!" Victor cried, horrified, raising up his hands, as if he were throwing this catastrophe into God's hands.
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Sherlock didn't want to hear them. He needed to get up and out of there. The Work was his only salvation. Rising to his feet, Sherlock took a moment to right himself. Retracting his claws and staring at his hands, revealed light blood smearing his fingers. Staring further down to the ground, Sherlock caught sight of his feet. He wasn't wearing his shoes. Suddenly recalling that the alpha had removed them, Sherlock hadn't remembered to put them on when he'd escaped the alpha's home. His socks were tattered, covered in dirt and drying blood.
Sherlock lifted the chair momentarily, all so he could slam the legs of the chair on the cold wooden floor, and spun to regard John with a challenging glare.
Then the fall happened, and after, Mary Morstan.
It was painful to hear Sherlock talk about someone else with such fondness. John wanted to yank his hand from Sherlock’s, but it felt so nice and warm, John couldn’t muster up the will to do so.
Sherlock smiled, positively delighted with himself. Harshly running his hand over his pants to remove the splatter of release that had dribbled its way on him as he had taken care to give John completion. He rose from his chair. Quickly retrieving the camera from where it rested. Sherlock spared a glance in John's general direction, not meeting his eyes, but seeing enough of him to take notice of his trembling shoulders as the alpha curled inwards on himself. The scent of the man was so bitter. It neared unbearable.
Moving to stand further in front of John and to the side of the horse’s head, Sherlock took hold of the front rein, controlling Axel’s minor head bobbing and stilled his anxious movements.
John could hardly resist Sherlock as it was, but he couldn’t give in. Not yet. He had to play his role. Keep being the good little omega for his alpha, make Sherlock want him, love him, then he would give in fully. Hold Sherlock close, feel the strength of his alpha, the fullness of him as he claimed him.
~~~~~~~~~~~~
“Oh! Apparently, yes.” Sherlock teased.
Closing his eyes and inhaling a deep breath, willing himself to remain calm, John seated himself in his red chair and waited for the omega to explain himself.
John smiled. Victor and his games. Though this one was rather fun. John was glad Victor talked him into playing it.
, I promise that I will cherish you.”
“Boring! I could have got them anywhere.” Moriarty answered dully and tossed it into the pool.
“Um, I don’t know. Always have.” John felt embarrassed by the sweetness of his scent. Omegas were to smell sweet, alphas were to have strong musky scents, and betas were a mixture of the two.
“Er… Right.” John mumbled, moving to the other side of the bed and placing his room key on the bedside table that was near before slipping under the covers to join Sherlock.
