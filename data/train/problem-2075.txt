"I'll read it for myself, but I do appreciate your summarizing it for me. So. You leave me in suspense. What's in store for me? Please don't tell me I'm going to grow fur all over."
His inner voice taunts him. And its true. To fall back on his tired space metaphors, they're a binary system, locked in each other's vast orbits until the day they fade.
John squirms beneath him and the fungus reluctantly let's him go. Sherlock feels a brief moment of hope that John has realized he needs to escape and is running, but instead watches in horror, trapped in his body, as John strips himself beneath Sherlock.
"Everyone has to go back at some point and there's no guarantee the next time I come back I'll remember you. That we'll find each other. And I don't want that. I want you. Always you."
John shakes his head and leans towards Sherlock. "Sherlock. Me wanting to have sex with you isn't entirely dependent on what your wearing or what body parts you have. I
An answer to a prayer he hadn't known he'd made. John's lips meet Sherlock's and he's shocked at how soft they are, cool and dry beneath his.
He feels his stomach flip and watches as his belly drops. There's a sudden insistent pressure inside him pushing at his insides, almost like he has to pee. Then his belly tightens and the pain is shocking but it passes, for the moment.
The flat is warm and cozy and all decked out in fairy lights from the Christmas Tree to the mantle and windows. The tree has been decorated, though it's lacking a star.
His body is loose and he feels Sherlock lay him down and finally slip out of his body. They lie together, John panting and Sherlock pressing gentle kisses to the back of John's neck.
"Alright then. After dinner we'll go. I'll bring a pack snack too, since I'm sure all that activity will make you hungry." John smiles back at Sherlock and Sherlock starts purring again. He's really got to figure out what's triggering it, but he'll do it later. Right now, it's soothing and it makes John's smile wider.
John jumps up and follows him. Bybthe time he gets out of the room Sherlock is down the hall and waiting for the elevator.
John is keening. The feeling of Sherlock's soft breasts and the delicate fringe of his bra against his back while the man's cock breaches him, stretches him over and over again, is so contradictory and,
He wishes he could stop breathing right then and there. In the back booth of Speedy's. Just drop dead. But that would just restart the loop, so what would be the point?
"My nightmare was about my time away. And then it was about you. You...dying." Sherlock gives a ragged sigh, the fear and panic from the dream threatening to consume him again.
"No, it's not. I'm also here and sometimes I would like it if you respected the fact that I'm another human being living in the same flat as you."
Sherlock draws his head back and scrunches up his face, affronted, but most surprisingly- and this stops John's laughter at once- he lets out what can be best termed a growl. From somewhere deep in his chest, a short warning noise. His tail also perks up slightly and puffs in warning.
Calmly, he sets the kettle down, places both of his hands on the counter and takes a deep breath which he lets out shakily.
Sherlock has just had a terrifying nightmare where they had not only done what they did to him, but they had gone and taken John and they did awful things to him while Sherlock watched and there was nothing Sherlock could do.
John focuses on Sherlock's face and feels a familiar swoop of affection at Sherlock's currently perplexed look.
"How do you know that?" Sherlock starts tucking into his meal but regards John with an inquisitive gaze.
John checks the fireplace for any hidden 'experiments' and then builds a fire that's quickly crackling away. He pokes at the fire and takes a seat as Sherlock comes back into the room with their tea. He's shut the room divider and the result is the living room quickly warms and becomes cozy. With the curtains drawn and mostly hiding the midday light and the thick snow falling silencing the sounds of the city, John could believe that it was only he and Sherlock left in the world.
Sherlock appears in a few minutes, looking as proper as ever despite the hour. "There's supposed to be an excellent café a few minutes away. If we're very convincing, they may let us in." �John smiles. Hesitates. "C'mere."
“Let me,” he says, and Sherlock still doesn’t know what he means. It must be fairly obvious on his face, because John thinks for a moment, clearly reformatting his words.
Sherlock smiles that tiny, secret one he makes when he thinks nobody's looking. "Yes. I think so." He takes John's hand and the two of them walk out of the hotel and straight to the street, where a light mist is hanging in the air. Sherlock glances at him.
It seems that John has exhausted his Important message, and so he once again averts his eyes. Sherlock stares at him, processing. He blinks a few times. Opens his mouth, then closes it.
But, he'd made her a promise. One night, John, she had said, just try it for one night and see if it helps.
"Yeah, well. Also there was a field, and you and Mary and other people were wearing these red flowers that Rosie picked out for you."
John turns, and Sherlock is right there, looking him up and down and analysing. John refuses to meet his eyes.
John's voice has adopted a scolding schoolteacher quality that makes Sherlock feel like a child once again, being sniffed at by Mycroft. He didn't know that the wound from the Baskerville was still open, but apparently it is.
And suddenly there's a big building in front of him, and a long stretch of pavement, and a crowd of people. He's running in slow motion while everything else moves in real time. Sherlock is carried away on a bright yellow stretcher, and John can't get to him.
John feels tension settle between his shoulder blades. "Well, for starters, other people don't shoot the wall or stab our mantel when they're bored. Other people don't wake me up in the middle of the night with a question about my childhood."
"Alright. It was about the morgue. And you were there. With Culverton. He was…um." John blinks and swallows. "Dissecting you, a bit."
John’s face becomes so incredulous, so openly full of disbelief, that Sherlock can almost see Donovan or Anderson written in the widening of his eyes and the slight turn of his mouth.
It's cold. Freezing, actually. The room he's standing in is lit up with electric blue, and there are strange shelves in the walls. He takes a step forward. It resonates with a metallic clang. Inhale. Exhale. His breath climbs up through the vents. He's curious. Those shelves. It creaks as he slides it open. There's a blonde woman lying inside, wearing a big plastic towel over her body. She's sleeping. He touches two fingers to her neck. She doesn't have a pulse.
Sure enough, Sherlock clicks on one of the guided meditations. London Fog. John could almost laugh at that, if he wasn't currently heating up with embarrassment. Sherlock presses play. There are sounds of buses and gentle chatter, and then the voice starts up.
Sherlock jumped up from his chair and took three quick, long strides over to John. “It is never nothing.”
Sherlock isn't listening. He's experimenting. He runs his fingers through the short hairs at the back of John's scalp. Without thinking, John leans into the touch, his eyelids fluttering. Inside, his brain is screaming at him to stop. This is a bad idea. He shouldn't be letting Sherlock do this.
"It's really not." John feels tension spike through him and straighten his spine. Sherlock's going to figure it out.
He woke up that morning to Sherlock, downstairs in the kitchen, rocking Rosie side-to-side while blowtorching an ear. John almost smiled, but he caught himself. It was too early for smiling. Neither of them could do that yet.
John looked at him incredulously. “Jesus Christ! Of course I’m alright, Sherlock, what dangers do you think were awaiting me in the shower?”
"Ah." Sherlock looks at the phone, and then, suddenly, he's laughing. That giggle that John first heard the night they chased that cab. Before he knows it, he's laughing too.
So he did it. When he went to bed that night, he turned on the app and selected a guided meditation called "London Fog" (which he admittedly snorted at). He didn't want to fall asleep. In fact, he was working very hard not to.
"Oh, am I being ridiculous?" John waves the phone in the air, feeling heat rush to his face with contempt. "She's texted you once every three months for the past year. She likes you. And you're letting her!"
"You're lying. Your breathing has been erratic for the past ten minutes, and you keep squeezing your eyes shut."
He didn't want to, at first. It was something his therapist recommended for him. This app called SleepSpace, which supposedly had meditations, songs, and guided exercises to get to bed.
Sherlock doesn't move. Then, he claps his hands and jumps back to his feet. He turns and points at John triumphantly, looking as though he's solved the world's most difficult murder.
"Because you're a great git with a big coat who woke me up when I was screaming. Because you hold my daughter in your arms while you blow things up in the kitchen." John leans in and kisses him again, and this time Sherlock reciprocates. John pulls away and hums a little. "Because I think that this is how it's supposed to be."
John picks up Sherlock’s left hand and gives it a quick kiss. Sherlock feels warmth run through his body. John tucks Sherlock’s hand under his chin and looks at him with such pure adoration that Sherlock’s brain, for a blissful moment, stops working.
It was an early November in London, just around that time when more misty rain starts to fall than usual; when the light from the streetlamps are big, swirling clouds of orange and yellow. It's his favourite time of year. He and Rosie were taking a walk through Kensington Gardens when Sherlock texted him.
John tries to get up. Struggles, screams out. He can't. He's frozen in his hiding place, watching as Culverton picks the detective apart.
“Why. Am I. Of great consequence to you?” John did his best to contain his emotions, speaking between harsh breaks, like he was building a barrier. Sherlock stared at him.
John can't make words come out of his mouth. He gasps again, trying to get air. Sherlock's eyes widen.
John grabbed his arm faster than he had expected of himself. Sherlock looked back at him. That all too familiar tension rose between them, shimmering like heat waves in cold air.
The smug one returned, probably flipping off his less eloquent thoughts and crossing his legs like Mycroft. Everything. Try everything. John realised that he had been scrubbing his hair with the shampoo for at least ten minutes now and took to rinsing it out, slightly embarrassed. His logic desperately tried to make another argument. Well of course I feel differently about Sherlock! He’s a bloody sociopath and the smartest, most amazing man I’ve ever met! It makes sense!
John Hamish Watson, Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers, Veteran of Bart's (bloody) Hospital, the supposed "strong one"-because let's be honest, Sherlock is much more emotional than he is-uses a meditation app to get to sleep at night.
John’s head whips back up, eyes wide. “No. No, Sherlock, I want to help you cope. Instead of the drugs.”
"No, you didn't." John smiles again-he can't seem to stop doing that-and reaches up, gently pulling Sherlock down to him and giving him a quick kiss. They've never done anything like that before, not even close, but it feels natural somehow. Like he's been doing that his whole life. Sherlock blinks. He looks as though he's trying to re-program his brain.
John released his arm. His smug side came bubbling to the surface, asking the question and going in for the kill.
Despite popular belief, John isn't gay. And even if he was, Sherlock is his best friend. He would never, ever-even if he wanted to-
John turns to face him, trying to avoid looking at places other than Sherlock's face. He's wearing that damn purple shirt today. "Because I don't want to, Sherlock."
"Why not tonight?" Sherlock is deducing now, looking John up and down. John makes the mistake of glancing at his phone. Sherlock, as always, notices. He picks it up, because he never asks, and unlocks it immediately. John really should change his password.
Shit. (Again). John gets out of his chair and walks quickly to the kitchen, hoping Sherlock won't notice how he's walking.
“What if I was being bothered by the weather? Would it still not be nothing then?” One sugar went into his tea. John felt himself tensing as Sherlock pressed on.
It was embarrassing. Humiliating. But he didn't really care. That had been the best sleep he'd had since…well. Since the morgue.
Five hours later, at his desk and typing up another case, he can't forget about it. The implication in Lestrade's tone. The brief image conjured up in John's head.
"Wrong." John places his mug on the coffee table and goes to check the fridge. "Did you really not do the shopping while I was out?"
He couldn’t like Sherlock. He couldn’t love Sherlock. Sherlock was the only friend he had ever had, and that was far too precious to ruin with a stupid crush. He sat there warring with himself for another ten seconds before the devil himself kicked open the door, armed with a crowbar and his eyes wild. John jumped back in fright and Sherlock ran over to him.
"Yes." Sherlock picks up his camera phone from the nightstand and checks the time. It's three in the morning. Great. "Are you planning on sleeping again?"
“Because, John, you are the only person in my life that I have managed to care about. Completely, that is. Mycroft I may care about, but that is truly only halfway. You are the only person-the only one who I-” Sherlock paused. He was struggling to speak too, John realised. Sherlock took a deep breath and straightened his shoulders, looking John straight in the eye.
"Because you're obviously not interested, otherwise you would text her back!" John feels a bit of air leave his body. His eyebrows are narrowed, his shoulders are tense, and his hands are curled into fists. Sherlock steps straight into John's personal space-despite the lectures-and takes the phone out of his hand. Then, his entire face widens-his eyes, his mouth, his jaw. John knows that face. It's his realisation face.
The smug one returned (he was starting to get annoyed with it now): Mycroft is just as smart and cold, if not more, than Sherlock, and you don’t consider him amazing or, dare I say, “fantastic!” John internally glared at himself.
John determinedly kept his straight face. People who showed emotions in the shower were stars of dramas. He was not the star of a drama. Another thought ran wildly past, probably wearing a smug expression. Is Sherlock the only person you’ve ever admired in your life?
John lets out a huff. "Because, believe it or not, Sherlock, I do sometimes want to hang out with people that aren't you."
“You don’t mean to? You don’t mean to yell at everyone who’s too slow for you, or isn’t interesting enough for you? You just do that by accident?”
Sherlock shrinks a little at that, but John's frustrations are already coming out to quickly for him to register that.
Sherlock can feel John smile where his face is pressed against his shoulder. "Good. I'm glad. I slept good as well, to be honest."
John loves Sherlock's eyes. They're never one color; he's almost positive they change colour with Sherlock's moods. He's never had the opportunity to look this closely or for this long. They seem almost lit from behind. It's a fanciful thought, but he's almost positive he can see Sherlock's soul. He smiles at Sherlock.
It's cold. It's January 6th and the cottage is cold. The bees are boxed for the winter. The leaves are brown on the ground and there's a grey look to the world.
John can't begin to fathom the depth of courage that took. Lord knows he would have kept tumbling along, pining, never saying a word for fear of losing what little they had.
"Oh my God, Sherlock." John is groaning and apparently John is reaching his climax just as quickly as Sherlock. John shudders beneath them and Sherlock feels a warmth between them, but he cannot look down to see.
He wanted to touch him with his hands, with his lips. Bring him to the peaks of pleasure over and over again. He wanted to show him for the rest of their days on this earth how much he loved him.
And now here he is, in bed, body wrapped and shielded from all the horrible shadows of his fears by the only person in the world who matters to Sherlock.
He's going to be sleeping in the same room, hell, the same bed as Sherlock. The man he has secretly loved from afar, the bravest man he's ever known especially after the leap of faith he took only just a few hours ago.
"Hmm. As a hallucination you would say that. Besides there's a glaringly obvious reason for why this isn't real."
He looks out the window. A storm is coming in. Sleet, if not snow, by the looks of it. He gets up and walks to his front door. He grabs his coat, but not
Lestrade visibly loses his train of thought and stares a moment at Sherlock's chest before shaking his head and pointedly looking at Sherlock's face. "Look I don't care what kinky stuff you and John get up to at home, but, yes, you probably should have taken those off before you showed up. They're distracting my team."
John stiffens his spine, puts his book down, and resigns himself to Sherlock explaining how he's realised John's affections and he needs John to tone it down. That it's impeding his ability to think or whatever.
John looks at Sherlock in disbelief. When he came home this evening this absolutely not what he expected, but it's wonderful.
Both Sherlock and John turn beet red. Sherlock because that's the first time Rosie has ever referred to him as Papa and John because that's how he's been secretly referring to Sherlock for ages.
He starts to reach for his baby when he gives a small cry as he feels a second birth begin to unfold. He's stunned as he realizes as he's giving birth to twins. He's having a second baby right here, right now. He feels it move down and through him, the sensation no less odd then it was with the first one.
Sometimes his mind forces him through more than just his memories. Some nights they force him through the what-ifs.
He takes a deep breath over the pot, inhaling its sweet cherry scent and exhales fully into the murky pot. Immediately, it changes to a dark black colour and stops boiling.
They begin to dance a slow waltz together in the tall flowers. Sherlock leans forward and whispers into John's ear, "We won't remember our lives, but we might remember this. So hold onto this memory John. Remember me as I hold you in a quiet meadow on a sunny day and I whisper 'I love you' in your ear. We'll have this, this time, John. Remember."
The flat is dim with late afternoon light muted by the gentle rain that's been the norm for the last couple of weeks. John sits at the desk before his laptop, blog open to a new post and utterly blank.
John can only gape at the way the black satin clothes contrast with Sherlock's pale skin creating the ultimate tease.
Sherlock gives a nod and John leans down to nibble at Sherlock's left nipple through the fabric while his right hand pinches the other. The fabric must feel so rough over them.
Sherlock feels his stomach drop, "Permanent? You mean I'll be like this? This? For forever? No, no, nooooo." He drops his face into his hands and just lets out a despairing groan.
Then he tries to rehydrate the second sample with blood given that it had been in a human body. It's
"John. I said I'm sorry for being rude yesterday and saying the things I said." Sherlock cocked his head before giving a dramatic sigh and throwing himself forward and into a kiss with John.
Sherlock relaxes and leans into John's hand slightly while John speaks, and when John finishes what he has to say looks into John's face, into his eyes, "You will?"
They break apart from the kiss. Sherlock gives a small smile, which John responds to with a grin, making Sherlock's smile even bigger.
However, he was the first he ever got to live in any proximity to and quite frankly he was grateful otherwise he might never have accepted Sherlock's offer to room together and split the rent.
He thinks back to yesterday evening and how John had been so understanding, despite this being an absolute shock.
Waking up after that wild night was a bit surreal as well. Sherlock's breasts had stopped leaking milk, but they were still there.
"Wha- Sherlock?" John looks a bit like cornered prey. It's as if instinctively he understands that Sherlock is not himself. "Are you okay?"
John gives Sherlock's body a good look starting at his toes all the way to his...his..., "Oh God. You have the cat ears too."
Sherlock unbuttons his shirt a couple more buttons and unclasps the front of his bra, letting his breasts fall free. "Please tell me how exactly I should have left these at home."
His hair is run through with silver and he wears practical clothes these days. All jumpers and long underwear under heavy wool pants.
John is dumbstruck and stares at Lestrade; which is precisely when Sherlock makes his reentrance holding another folder.
The fungus ruts them together faster. Sherlock can feel a pleasure coiling low in his belly and a tightening in his groin. The fungus simply seems intent to reach orgasm as quickly as possible.
And he realizes it's because the cold is in him. It's in the hole in his chest left by one army doctor decades ago.
Sherlock gives a dismissive wave. "Once I've had some practice and experience with my new… me," he gestures vaguely to his whole self, "I should be able to return to more or less how I normally was."
Their legs are tangled together and John shifts his own legs slightly to feel the leg hair where their pajama trousers have ridden up. Sherlock is human and real and here wrapped around John. John can't begin to describe the feeling in his heart. It's the purest feeling of joy he's ever felt. He always imagined perfect happiness as a screaming, ecstatic thing, but this is it.
"I love you." John's eyes go wide. He hadn't quite meant to say it so simply, but he did and he does love Sherlock. "I didn't mean to say that so bluntly."
He gives a sigh. He's exhausted, but feels his body give a final few pushes to expel the afterbirth. He needs to cut their umbilical cords, but he can do that in a moment.
He's still in too much shock to realize he needs to undo his trousers and instead he just stares dumbstruck as his gently swelling abdomen stretches and then bursts the buttons on his trousers and then his shirt. His shirt gently flutters to his side after the buttons pop off and his legs are forced apart to accommodate his growing belly.
"Sorry doesn't fix anything now John. You're dead and I'm dying." Sherlock let's out a sigh and visibly deflates, the anger leaving him as suddenly as it came. "We're a mess aren't we?"
No one else got to make him a Stargazy Pie for his birthday and watch with utter delight the gusto with which Sherlock tucked into it.
He crawls over to the sink and pulls himself to standing. His mouth gapes open as he stares at his reflection in the mirror. Cat ears, covered in the same fur as his tail, protrude from his head, and when he concentrates he can swivel them and flatten them like a housecat.
"That was the most shameless ask I've ever heard." John started gently stroking Sherlock's tail again.
They lie together in the quiet stillness in the morning. Sherlock wishes this could last forever, this moment, but he's burning with questions. His best asset and greatest flaw: his insatiable curiosity.
But Sherlock is a genius, completely brilliant of course. He can taste a million different nuances (well maybe not a
"Ok. So first things first, a small caveat. Almost all the information available is either anecdotal from actual cat people or their spouses or from extremely niche scientific papers. So. We should be prepared for anything, but here's the gist of what is known.
Sherlock quickly removes his coat and gives a full body shiver, his tail puffing up. He turns to face John and in the dim multicolored glow from the fairy lights on the Christmas Tree, Sherlock looks beautiful and magical.
Sherlock raises both of his hands placatingly, "I didn't just decide to. I've loved you a long time. From the beginning even maybe, though it's...more. Difficult. To parse those emotions. But I have loved you and do love you." Sherlock frowns at the lack of anything John is showing on his face. He continues in a small voice, "And I just thought you should know."
He pants on the floor for a moment and then struggles up onto his elbows to look past his still considerably rounded belly, to the baby on the floor. It's moving gently, its body covered in blood and birth detritus. Sherlock angles himself for a better view and realizes it's a boy. He's just given birth to a baby boy.
Thick black twisted stalks, roots, have burst from his chest and body into John's beneath him. Have consumed John, pressing him into a final death embrace with Sherlock.
John let's go of one of Sherlock's hands and reaches up to caress Sherlock's face. "Let me try to say that again. Sherlock, if you're okay with it, I would very much like to sleep in the same room as you tonight. I don't think I could bear to be separated from you."
"Daddy pay attention. I'm not done. We also watched a movie. It has-it has pretty music and there were butterflies and the daddy butterfly protected the baby butterfly and there was also Mickey Mouse and he couldnt stop the brooms. He was a-uh-um..."
John feels a need to hold Sherlock and so he gives in. He slides from his chair to his knees, slides his hands up Sherlock's arms and around Sherlock. He tucks his face into Sherlock's neck and breathes in the smell of him. The odor of slightly sweaty skin and home.
In a matter of moments he can feel it begin to spread him open. This baby must be larger than his first was because despite his already stretched body, he can feel his body struggling to stretch around it. He bears down hard but it feels like the baby is barely moving out of him. The baby is digging into what feels like every sensitive spot inside of him to the point where he can't resolve the pleasurable sparks through his body and it feels almost like pain.
Sherlock holds him just a little tighter and presses his cheek to John's hair, "You looked sad staring at me."
"It was in our historical health class. You know, where you learn about ancient surgeries or whatever? Well, apparently this," John gives a wave of his hand to the whole of Sherlock's person, "is something that used to happen. It was still rare back then, but because of the closer living between animals and humans it did happen on occasion."
Sherlock closes his magnifying glass sharply, stands and folds his arms under his breasts. "Are they a problem, inspector?"
John can feel his pulse pick up. He's been studiously avoiding this conversation ever since they moved back in together. He suspected that there was something building between them, something reminiscent of those final months before Sherlock 'killed' himself and left John for three years.
"I'm sorry, John." Sherlock keeps his face impassive, blank, as he says this to John. He is sorry. For everything.
"No. I didn't think you'd want that. I figure you'll decide when and how you want to share with others."
Which leads him to today. He has nothing on and had assumed he and Sherlock might go out for a nice brunch, but his plans are dashed as Sherlock comes swanning out of his room an absolutely dark look on his face.
Sherlock observes John quietly while John continues to peck at his food. John jumps when Sherlock covers John's socked foot with his own under the table. They don't pull apart though.
Sherlock looks over his shoulder and down his back where his tail responds by perking up off his bum slightly. A shiver runs down his frame. He can feel where the bed brushes against his tail, a foreign sensation, but not entirely unpleasant.
Sherlock licks his lips as John reveals his skin, until he is finally down to just his pants. John stops just a moment to appreciate the comparison between them.
He snuggles into John, because John is right, he does want someone to hold him and tell him everything is going to be okay, but rather than just anyone, he has the one person he wants to hold him already wrapped around himself.
He treks for the better part of an hour. The woods are deathly silent. He feels it's almost a travesty to disturb the stillness. How horrible that man wasn't designed to be stealthy and unobtrusive? Instead he's crashing through the underbrush.
John opens his eyes, not realizing he had shut them and looks down at Sherlock. Sherlock is wet with sweat from the exertion of controlling himself, his eyes half lidded and his lips pinked and swollen. John lets his gaze drift lower to the straining black bra Sherlock is still wearing. It barely covers Sherlock's peaked nipples, the fabric soaked with the milk he's been producing nonstop.
And did John really want to change how things were anyway? His stomach churned at the idea of pushing away his best friend—more than that, someone who had become his platonic life-partner, really. Not to mention he would no longer be able to work the cases he had begun to so enjoy. The thrill of hunting down the solution to the mysteries, with Sherlock beside him, was not something he was ready to live without. What would he be then? He would live an ordinary life with ordinary people to talk to. Hell, he might even end up married to an ordinary woman with whom he would watch ordinary television and raise a brood of equally ordinary children— He shuddered slightly. He had no desire to cut out his source of all interest and excitement for life.
John won't answer. Can't. He stares at a tiny spot to the right of Sherlock's head. Sherlock is still evaluating. He puts a hand on John's shoulder, and John inhales sharply. Sherlock places his hand against John's cheek and, experimentally, draws his thumb against his jaw. John's shoulders tense. His lips close as tight as he can force them to. Sherlock smirks, barely.
“SHUT UP!” John shouted. He angrily turned off the water and went into his room, quickly changing into a jumper and trousers. He pinched the bridge of his nose, frustrated, and sank onto his bed.
"You prick." John pushes Sherlock off of him (not enough to hurt him, but enough to let him know that he's not happy). "You really did all that just to solve a case?"
Greg nods, though there's still suspicion in his face, and continues on the conversation. The thing is, though, John can't forget it.
Sherlock’s stare became stronger. “The only person I believe I have ever completely cared about, and the only person I believe I have ever...well. Loved, I think is the word.”
That is how, hours later, he ends up at a little Bed and Breakfast with Sherlock, wishing desperately that they had more rooms.
Sherlock stands and walks closer to John. John tries not to panic. He's done this a million times, stood next to Sherlock. They're friends. It's not a big deal.
"Oh." Sherlock stops analysing and adds a bit of honey to his tea, then snaps back to John. "Like what?"
John looks back up at him, and Sherlock knows that the only reason he’s done so is because whatever he has to say is Important. (John feels the need to make eye contact when he is saying Important things, though Sherlock doesn’t quite understand why).
"Look, I'm fine. Sherlock. Okay?" He can't meet his eyes. If he does, everything might spill out. Sherlock stands. "You're not."
John clears his throat. “Look, I can’t imagine what it’s like living with your mind. It must be exhausting. But-“
"Absolutely. After all, Rosie will be needing her afternoon biscuits and honey. We couldn't possibly deprive her of them." Sherlock grins and sweeps into the bathroom.
Sherlock lets out a scoff. “Well, you did just rant about all of the negative aspects of my personality that you hate.”
The kiss is another experiment. John knows that. Sherlock is trying everything, seeing how things affect John differently. He pulls and bites and makes little noises, all to see what happens. John knows this. He doesn't care. After a few minutes of breathing and sighing, Sherlock pulls away. John feels like he could shatter completely if someone so much as poked him.
"Good." John smirks a little and walks up to Sherlock, grazing his hand ever so slightly against his ridiculous purple shirt. "Congratulations, Sherlock Holmes, you've officially drawn me out of the closet. Now, come on."
"Well then." Sherlock turns and claps his hands, which would be very businesslike if not for the striped pyjamas he's wearing. "Breakfast?"
His logic was still waging a war, recalling scenes from his life in which people assumed he and Sherlock were dating. There were a lot. Damn right, the smug one answered. Wanna know why, dumbass? Because you two are so fucking gay, that everyone can see it but you. Even Sherlock thought you were asking him out when you first met him. His logic didn’t have a good comeback for that one. John angrily stomped his foot on the shower floor and almost slipped. He sighed.
It's not like he and Sherlock haven't shared a room before, or hell, even a bed. That doesn't bother him like it used to. No, it's that he won't be able to sleep, because he would rather visit Eurus than let Sherlock hear his app. But despite his pleading, they can't open a spare room for John. Apparently there's a wedding. So he sets down his overnight bag, puts on his coat, and does his best not to think about the fact that he is going to be seeing Culverton Smith tonight.
"Then why is she still texting you? Most people would give up, wouldn't they?" John stomps over to Sherlock's phone and picks it up. Reads it.
Sherlock is still scanning, processing for information. "What did you talk about?" He says it more to himself than to John, but he still answers.
Alright, that's not the actual secret. Anyone who's met him would know that. That's only half of the secret. The second half is much more embarrassing.
John hated it, that cold, deadpan way he spoke, like whatever he said was a fact that everyone else had to deal with. John was sick of dealing with the facts. It was all he ever did. He’d grown so used to the facts that the actual emotions themselves were a mystery.
John’s jaw clenched and he rounded on him, angry and frustrated. “Why do you say that? Why are my problems so important to you? It makes no sense. Most people just ask if i want a cuppa or if they can do anything about it, and if they can’t, they move on, but not you, Sherlock. You ask and you ask and you act like I am the most important person in the world when I’m not. All I am is a doctor with an important friend.” He stopped and stared at the counter, his breathing coming out a bit strained. There was silence for a few moments. Sherlock took his tea and added four more sugars.
“John,” Sherlock called from the next room. Lestrade ambled away to take a phone call, and John stuck his head out of the bathroom.
“Let it be a lesson to you not to piss off any Russian mobsters,” Lestrade commented from the threshold. “Any ideas on TOD?”
But no matter. Sherlock was settled into his usual chair in the living room, perfectly, utterly still. From his posture—his fingers steepled and pressed against his lips, his pupils blown wide, his gaze fixed on the middle distance—John knew that he could do a naked tap-dance on the threadbare carpet without drawing his attention. With his bedding stuffed into a tote bag, he swung out the door and headed for the laundromat.
Gaze fixed on the spinning laundry, tongue coated in the bitter flavor of cheap coffee, John let his mind run itself in circles. How long could he keep up this mad charade? It was torture, tiptoeing the line with Sherlock. Perhaps he was imagining things, his lust-addled mind playing tricks on him, but it seemed to John that the sexual tension had been building in 221B. Just yesterday, he had been cleaning up after breakfast, head bent toward the frying pan he was scrubbing, when Sherlock came half-stumbling into the kitchen, racing for the sink. He lurched forward, the overflowing beaker of mystery liquid bubbling down the drain (and over the surface of the nearly-clean pan), but the length of his body fell against John’s, his solidness against him sending a sudden shockwave of warmth and comfort and spine-tingling
Sherlock’s body slipped out from under the ice. Numb hands fisted at Sherlock’s shoulders, John hauled him up the bank, frozen mud crumbling as he struggled to find purchase. Soaking wet, Sherlock was a heavy burden as John squatted down and tried to pull him over a shoulder. Adrenaline surging through him, he grunted loudly as he rose with Sherlock in a haphazard fireman’s carry and began stumbling toward the warehouse.
“Honestly. Sometimes you are mind-numbingly thick,” Sherlock mumbled. His hand slid beneath John to grip the back of his neck securely. “Despite your conflicted feelings on the matter, this is not passing for me. This is not some silly experiment for a case or a fanciful lark at your expense. I am done waiting, John. Patience is not my strong suit. If you find you are no longer as interested in this as you might have once thought, arrangements can be made. But do not lie to me. I
It was dark inside, thin, wintry light struggling inside though the open fire door. John’s gaze darted about, looking for something, anything that he could use. In the gloom, he made out a pile of discarded packing foam, a heap of musty yellow thrust between two stacks of crates. John collapsed with his knees in the fluff, and rolled Sherlock off his shoulders.
Sherlock gathered John’s wrists into one grip, the fingers of his other hand brushing against John’s lips.
John sunk down instantly, resting on his heels. He watched as Sherlock’s deft fingers worked open his button and zip, pulling out his already rigid cock. With one hand gripping himself by the base, Sherlock carded his fingers through John’s hair. Suddenly needy, John tilted his head back, opening his mouth. With a subtle smirk, Sherlock guided himself between John’s lips.
He knew Sherlock noticed. He could see him zeroing in on the flush of his cheeks, his rising heart rate, the way his lips stretched thin and tight.
Sherlock pulled himself upright, making quick work of the knot around his waist. He flung away the robe, and John had just a short glimpse of him—his lean, taut body in the stripe of streetlamp light, his hard cock against the panes of his stomach—before he pressed himself back against John, their skin finally meeting. He was cool to the touch, a welcome relief against John’s fevered skin. John could feel it now, the insistent pulse of Sherlock against his hip, the slight dampness of his arousal.
John blinked. The thought that Sherlock wanted a fraction of what he did was something that had yet to really occur to John. None of his imaginings had accounted for this. He suddenly felt very vulnerable, trapped beneath Sherlock’s penetrating gaze.
Wide eyed, staring into the darkness at the wall above him, John made a decision. If this was Sherlock’s idea of a practical joke, or a way to kill boredom, fine. He would take it. He would selfishly indulge in what he had so desperately, pathetically been craving, and when Sherlock grew bored, perhaps he would have gotten this out of his system.
Sherlock’s pupils dilated, his stare growing razor-sharp. Something in them glinted with an intense light, holding John captivated. He looked almost predatorily hungry, and John swallowed thickly around the sudden lump in his throat.
. The echo of it reverberated through John’s chest, sending the blood rushing from his fingertips. Breathing was something he suddenly had to focus on. Heat went roiling through his stomach, every shred of him straining toward the sound.
The sprint from the dilapidated silo to the warehouse was over a stretch of rocky ground, crusted with old snow and the brittle fibers of summer’s attempts at grass. John’s legs burned as he hurtled toward the hulking building, his eyes scanning desperately for an entrance.
He knew now that it said enough that he was still fixated on the incident. And with Sherlock on the trail of a hot new case, at least he was distracted enough to not fixate on John himself. That was when he had to be the most careful. With his mind ready to latch onto any oddity, Sherlock would suddenly remark on John’s slightest tics and mannerisms. That piercing gaze would follow him across the room.
“Why don’t we discuss it tomorrow?” Sherlock released his grip on John’s neck, reaching down to retrieve his bathrobe. With it, he wiped them both clean before tossing it over the edge of the bed. “I’ll see you in the morning—” he said as he began to rise.
through John. His breath hitched, and he could have sworn that just for an instant, Sherlock lingered. He knew the man’s balance was better than that. Right? He could have pulled away as soon as the slightest contact was made. Of course, a heartbeat later Sherlock was rigidly upright and mumbling an apology for his clumsiness, but the flush was still hot on John’s neck.
John was floating at the edge of wakefulness, a warmth seemingly wrapped around his body, molded to his contours. He inhaled, long and slow, savoring the flavor permeating the air, spiced with comfort and assurance. He came to gradually, taking stock of himself, his mind mapping out his bed, his room, Sherlock curled around him—
“Losing you.” Sherlock’s voice was low. He slipped out of the room before John could gather a response.
He snapped into full wakefulness at the expression there. Filled with the same predatory hunger as the day before, they glittered icily in the dim light, calculating, assessing. Sherlock seemed to be trying to peer between the cracks of him, to hone in on something he couldn’t quite get to. John wanted to protest, wanted to shove Sherlock away, to maintain the oh-so-precarious self-control he had managed up to this point, the protective armor he had worked so hard to construct.
Sherlock’s chest heaved as he coughed, spraying water. He dragged in a ragged breath, his body shaking. One of his hands flew to John’s waist, freezing cold fingers pressing into him tightly.
Long, thin fingers were gripping his hips, lips were at his neck, sucking, biting, leaving marks he so desperately wanted to earn. John’s back was arched, pressing his body forward, an aching heaviness in his groin. The rich familiarity of a scent surrounded him, the smell of a winter morning—cold wool and sunlight and clean air. He gasped in a breath as the fingers traced over his throat, drifting downward—
It wasn’t much longer before Sherlock was breathing heavily, his gaze locked fully on John. Sherlock held him close as his release found him, filling the back of John’s throat. He swallowed it down without a second thought. He looked up to find Sherlock staring down at him, something like tenderness in his eyes. His fingers stroked through John’s hair, once, twice. John stared back, eyes wide, the blood pounding in his ears.
“In a terrible stroke of luck, our bit of fraternization last night seems to have awakened a need I can no longer ignore.”
“Hard to say with the water still in there,” John replied, sinking down onto his heels. He peered through the bloody murk. “I’d say sometime late yesterday. Maybe very early this morning on the outside.” He swiveled, resting the gloved fingertips of his free hand against the mini fridge lying on its side on the bathroom tile. “Where in the bloody hell do you get enough lead shot to fill a mini fridge?”
Sherlock closed his eyes for fraction of a second, his head shifting to the side in that way he had when he was recalibrating something. When they snapped open, his pupils had shrunk, the hardness against John’s leg receding. He cleared his throat.
His lips were a faint blue, the mask of calm his features had settled into only serving to make John’s heartbeat more painfully thunderous. Clinging notions of lust long forgotten, John ripped off his layers of clothing, shedding the damp fabric. Clad in only his boxer-briefs and shivering in the brittle air, his fingers began to work at the buttons of Sherlock’s coat. There was always time for apologies and awkwardness later. John let himself run on autopilot, his hands working via muscle-memory through his army field training. He stripped Sherlock, throwing the sodden layers onto the concrete floor. With Sherlock slightly lighter, John had less trouble forcing himself into the pile of foam and pulling Sherlock after him. Completely buried, he pressed the length of his body against Sherlock’s worryingly cold skin.
John realized his body had already betrayed him. Aroused by his subconscious, John felt the weight of Sherlock’s hips pressing down against his cock. Far beyond his control, the muscles beneath his groin tensed suddenly, his pulsing length pressing against the silk of Sherlock’s nightgown.
“Please, let’s just skip over all of the next bit, if you don’t mind. If I must inform you, you spent the night mumbling my name and pulling me closer. I know it’s going to take some emotional readjusting for you. But do try to gloss over the unimportant and annoying aspects—the guilt, the shame, slowly coming around to accept what you already know to be factually true—unnecessary, all of it. I have work to do today.”
“Alright.” He followed as Sherlock turned and left the apartment without a word. They wound down the four flights of stairs, John struggling to keep up. They emerged blinking into the bright light of midday, Sherlock pausing at the street level door to wait for John. With John once more behind him, he walked briskly down the sidewalk and made a sharp right at the corner of the building, heading down a narrow alley.
“From the very beginning I was interested in ‘all this’ as you so eloquently put it. Things have just been so busy. And I wanted to be sure you wouldn’t take it badly. I was uninterested in—” Sherlock choked off suddenly. John turned to look at him where he was standing naked in the muted morning light, one hand on the doorknob, facing away.
John’s breath billowed in front of him in the icy air. He was glad to be running, just to feel fractionally warmer. The medically-inclined part of his brain chastised him for the beads of sweat beginning to roll down his back under the thick layers of clothing, worries of hypothermia vying for his attention. But his focus was elsewhere.
hover at the edge of his perception every waking moment. He couldn’t help but notice Sherlock in a way that made his body ache. He did a decent job of suppressing his thoughts on a daily basis, but it all broke loose in his dreams. Every night it seemed, John found Sherlock stretched over him, his lips a hair's-breadth away, his hands roving across John’s skin.
With one hand steady on the back of John’s head and the other braced against the bricks, Sherlock began to zone out, undoubtedly fixated on the details of the case. John didn’t mind. As his head bobbed up and down, he wondered at his own feelings. He had always been something of a sub in the bedroom, but it had been different with women. He craved Sherlock in a way that was foreign to him. Here he was, out in broad daylight in an alleyway, desperately sucking him off. He found he relished the way it felt to be so casually used. He loved the weight of Sherlock on his tongue, the fullness of his mouth as he took him in. He suddenly wondered at something he had heard in university once, and heaving in a breath, he pushed forward fully and swallowed, the head of Sherlock’s cock sinking smoothly to the back of his throat. To his delight, Sherlock breathed a sharp “Fuck,” his hand fisting in John’s hair.
Sherlock’s lips came down on his own, demanding and hungry. John’s mouth opened, Sherlock’s tongue flicking forward to taste, to explore. He felt himself being catalogued, his every physical aspect being stored away somewhere in Sherlock’s bank of information. Sherlock rutted forward again and John let out a breathy whimpering sound, his head falling back again.
Sherlock glanced down at their chests, pressed tightly together in the near-blackness. The fingers gripped tightly to John’s hip sprung open. John opened his mouth to launch his defense, gathering himself to insist that he had done what he thought best as a medical professional—
John sprang awoke to the sound of his own arousal. “Shit...” he mumbled, his bed sheets clinging to him stickily. Sherlock had undoubtedly heard him, and… Oh. Sherlock. He wondered briefly if he could keep a straight face long enough to duck out to the cleaners.
And then he was there, his body seizing and then tensing, his eyes squeezing shut, crying out as a wave of release crashed through him. Above him, he felt Sherlock’s sharp intake of breath, felt his hips snap forward and a warm wetness paint itself across John’s stomach.
Just for tonight, he decided he could pretend. He forced the tension to drain from his muscles as Sherlock curled around him, tucking him protectively against his chest. With Sherlock’s arms wrapped around him, John could imagine that this was his life now, that having Sherlock pressed against him was how he fell asleep every night, that he had a lifetime of nights like these ahead of him. As his eyes slid shut, he relished the steadiness of Sherlock’s heartbeat, the rhythm of his breathing. Unlike many nights, sleep found him easily.
“You are not dying of hypothermia, Sherlock Holmes. Not on my watch, no,” John scolded, working his hands in friction-inducing circles over Sherlock’s back. “I swear to god, if you die on me I
Suddenly the man’s head snapped up, his gaze locked on John. He turned on his heel and booked it back the short distance to the warehouse. By the time John had reached the steep bank of the lake, he could hear a car peeling out. But he no longer gave a single shit.
“I’ll need you to accompany me on an errand for a moment,” Sherlock said distractedly, his eyes unfocused as he paced back and forth between upturned items of furniture.
“Well,” Sherlock rumbled, his gaze leaving John’s as he brushed his lips against the shell of John’s ear. “I found that quite enlightening. I wonder, is this a passing fascination for you? Or have I been correct in my assessment of your behavior the last few months?”
“No,” John blurted out. He hadn’t meant to, but now his hand caught Sherlock’s arm. His voice was rough as he whispered, “Stay. Just—just for tonight. We can figure out the rest tomorrow.”
John pressed his lips together, dipping his head in a half-nod. “Alright then, we’ll skip it,” he said. “If I may ask,” John added as Sherlock rolled from the bed to the floor, stretching his arms above his head, “when exactly did you decide you wanted— I mean, with me— all this—”
"You didn't know that until today. You talked about that with him. Not the dating part, though, no. Gavin's not a sentimental man."
John feels Sherlock's hand pull him closer. Watches Sherlock lean in, lips parting slightly. And John, regretfully and stupidly, closes his eyes.
"Wait." Sherlock is making his 'mind palace' face, eyes flitting quickly over information that John can't see. "Lestrade and Molly are dating now."
"Other people don't use me as a human experiment and set me loose into a lab knowing very well that I am drugged and terrified! Actually, most people would consider that bad manners."
“Well then. If you’d rather go find someone who is more like other people, as you say, then you may feel free to pack your things. I understand.”
"Other people don't carelessly chuck aside my friends and girlfriends because they can't stand not to be the center of attention." John hisses, and Sherlock flinches a little at the sting of those words.
Today he turned on the hot water, took out the hidden bottle of shampoo gifted to him by Mike Stamford (“it smells like apples and pine, John, I think someone will like it”), and stepped in. He had been steadfastly avoiding the reason for this scheduled shower all day, determined to keep any thought of it from his mind until now, hoping and praying that his thoughts would be allowed to flow like the water running through his hair. Unfortunately for him, his mind had other plans.
Sherlock is my best friend-yes, he knew that-but how do I tell the difference between what is platonic and what is romantic? It’s not like I’ve had that much experience. Another thought blew up like a grenade before John could respond to the first.What about the difference between admiration and desire?
hey didn’t make sense to him. He was a doctor; he understood it was as simple as getting in, getting clean, and getting out. That was a shower’s purpose.
"Why did you do that?" He speaks slowly, quizzically. Like the day John told him that he would be his best man.
"Thanks for that, Sherlock. Great to know you're gay." He says sarcastically, an ice-cold bite in his tone. Sherlock pulls himself off of the wall and straightens his shirt.
John’s mouth goes into a firm line, and Sherlock knows, even if he can’t see it, that his left hand is squeezed into a fist. This is the face that John makes when he doesn’t like the emotions he’s feeling, Sherlock thinks. John exhales and averts his eyes to the carpet. Sherlock lets him.
John's about to leave for his date with another girl-this time named Susan-and Sherlock is, predictably, confused.
The next night, he fell asleep again. And again. And again. And again. Soon enough, the mere sound of the meditations starting made his eyes flutter shut. And every morning, he woke up to Sherlock and Rosie in the kitchen.
John groaned and tried to focus on one. There it was; shooting off in the back of his head in a much more contained, dark area of his brain that resembled a conspiracy theorist’s house. (His head was by far no “mind palace”, he wasn’t that pompous, but it had different sections, like a hospital.) He centred his mind on that thought and there it was, brought to the very front of his brain. He inhaled. This could be bad.
He walks into the kitchen and John looks at him before focusing back on the eggs in the pan. "Still feeling hot?"
John had clearly made a mistake but his embarrassment had him doubling down. "Well! If you weren't always mooning at him and. And. It's not like you ever told me who he was! How should I've known? It's not like you have that much family resemblance."
The only lights in the flat are the kitchen overhead and Sherlock's bedroom. John heads down the hall and into Sherlock's room.
Sherlock tries to push himself up into John but they can't quite get the angle right and so, with a strength John always forgets Sherlock has, he lifts John up and lays them both down on the floor. Now John is beneath Sherlock and being straddled by his strong thighs.
John jumps and turns to look at Sherlock who's come up behind him. He can't help the irritation in voice. "Yes. I'm sure."
you can stay for dinner and the night if you need too." She ends with a smile and takes a sip from her wine glass to try and hide it.
The one thing he couldn't do is burden John with his pathetic weaknesses. John has his own worries, he doesn't need Sherlock's.
Mycroft cuts in, "John. What my brother means to say is that we both already know how the other will respond and so we can each carry out the whole conversation within out minds without uttering a single word."
The next morning John wakes to an empty bed and the smell of coffee. He gets up, slightly achy from their vigorous activities from the day before. It makes him flush and grin with pride.
"Look. His nibs is being a prat and clearly doesn't want me around the flat and it's bloody cold outside, so yes, I thought my sister might welcome me in with loving arms."
Together they reach up to place the star and gently it's passed from Rosie's small hands to John's to Sherlock's to the tip of the tree where it rests crookedly.
"I have everything I want with you. My daughter has two fathers as far as I'm concerned. I don't want to change our life for anything. I'm happy."
He steps forward until he's right in front of Sherlock. He looks up into Sherlock's every color eyes, "Ok. Let's try."
"I truly never thought I could be this happy John. When I brought all this up earlier, I was prepared for you to walk out. To run away. To leave. I told myself that the best outcome I could hope for was you just saying it was 'all fine' again and dismissing the subject. I didn't want to hope for more. I couldn't." Sherlock looks up at John, his eyes piercing in that way of his and yet softened by the glassiness of unshed tears, "But as always, you surprise me John Watson. In the best of ways."
John's gaze softens and he gives Sherlock a small smile before looking out at the pond, "Yeah. I am." His voice is quiet, pained.
Harry and Bethany give a laugh and help John pick up the living room while Sherlock puts his coat on and takes a seat to wait for John. They're quick and soon they're on their way out the door. They say their goodbyes and just before they get in the cab they called, Harry calls out from the front door, "Go get'em tiger!"
Having John back is a problem with the nightmares. Sherlock is afraid to go to sleep, but, more so, he is afraid of John witnessing his weakness. He doesn't want John to see that. He should be stronger than a few night terrors.
Rosie finishes her bit of food and asks to be excused from the table. John grants permission, but she has the stay in the living room until he and Sherlock are done eating.
"Because you're not gay and, while you won't be outright homophobic, the awkwardness will eventually kill any possibility of salvaging our friendship."
He watches as thin, flat red stalks come from his back and twist together into a blood red fungal flower. They seem to pulse, erupting with a fine red powder which coats his room. He takes in the falling dust and focuses back on John beneath.
John looks up at Sherlock with half lidded eyes. "Ok, wow. I'm down for this, but, uh, maybe we should talk about this first?" John continues to look up at Sherlock while Sherlock's body continues to press into John's.
His hand drops his pencil. Sherlock thinks to pick it up, but his body ignores him. With a gripping panic he tries to will himself to do anything, but he's paralyzed, no longer in control.
Rosie shrieks with laughter, "No, daddy, stop! You have to put me down! I have to get Elsa ready for dinner!"
, but certainly significantly more then the average citizen) and combined with his deductive techniques parse out the liars and murderers.
The ride home simultaneously takes no time at all and feels like forever, but in the end they get there and it's just as well they decided to leave when they did. A heavy snow has begun to fall and the streets are already filling with it.
He climbs into the bed and lies ramrod straight unsure of how much contact is allows in this new intimate setting.
Sherlock gives him a smirk and leans forward towards John squeezing his breasts together causing the fabric to soak.
"Yes. You did hurt me, but I hurt you as well. Neither of us are free of culpability. But, I swear, even if it takes me the rest of my life, I will show you that I can love you and that I do. You never meant for the awful things we've experienced to happen and intent is everything, Sherlock. You are the best man I've ever known and, I know you don't think this, but you are also one of the kindest."
John smiles sadly. "There is. We won't remember any of the life we already lived. And if we can't love each other by the time you're 38, then we never meet again."
John lets out a short, quiet laugh. "Of course you do." He turns and faces Sherlock. He's mad at the man before him, though he can't quite tell for what in the chaos of emotions running through him. He can feel his adrenaline spiking. "Why?"
His whole career depends on his ability to convince others of what he sees. To lie to suspects and victims alike to find the solution to the mystery du jour; his
John narrows his eyes, clenches and unclenches his jaw and then lets out a sigh, "I meant why now, Sherlock. Why after all these years would you suddenly decide to. To."
He feels a tight stretching sensation and sticks his hand down between his legs to his new opening and can feel himself stretching wide over what can only be the baby's head, hot and wet. He feels it's sparse hairs as his body works to expel the life inside of him. He bears down in time with the contractions, his body working almost on autopilot; his control of himself surprisingly thin. He feels as the head bursts out of him with a small gush of fluid and then cries out as the baby's shoulders bully their way out next. They stretch him impossibly wide, one caught just inside of him digging into his sweet spot. He howls as he orgasms and the force of his pleasure squeezes the child's shoulders out of him and the rest of it slides gracefully from his body.
John closes his eyes and presses his hands to the closed lids, seeing flashes of color that linger in his eyesight as he opens them again. He looks down at the blog.
"Soulmates aren't a thing, exactly. But that's what the others started calling us, the other people in the afterlife who stumbled across me following you around. Haunting you, really. Well, eventually word got around to this person who's like the mouthpiece for the higher ups. Abrasive, heavy smoker, and prone to cussing, but he thought there was something romantic and tragic about our situation. So he made me an offer. We can go back. We can try again."
To John's surprise Sherlock looks away and covers his face with his hand, "...and to have my skin stroked."
Distantly, he realizes he's panting again, both in arousal and from the physical exertion of the changes he's going through. He rests a hand on the outermost portion of his belly and takes a quick breath at the shock of pleasure. The skin is hypersensitive. He can feel it still gently stretching slowly. He feels an odd pickling sensation in his nipples and swipes his hands up his belly and to his chest. He moans and stares in fascination as he feels a rush and then his chest is swelling into his hands until he's holding palmfuls of tender flesh which he can't help squeezing and which begin leaking thick milk as he does.
It presses into John's groin and Sherlock can feel John straining even through the stiff fabric of his jeans.
Sherlock shivers and stares at the dark fireplace. He's old and tired and suddenly it doesn't seem worth it anymore.
John pushes forward into the kiss and pours every emotion he's had for his best friend since he's known him into it. John's chest aches and aches with love allowed to flourish.
John lies still as Sherlock's piercing gaze gives a slow once over and his hands trail up John's chest, pausing only to gently brush against a nipple. "God, John you're perfect. I've always wanted to see what you looked like under your clothes, but I never expected it to be so arousing. God, the things you do to me."
John expects Sherlock to pull out of him, but he doesn't. He leans back and pulls John with him, his cock still inside John, softening.
"That's good." John finishes the eggs and puts them on two already fully loaded plates, sets the plates in front of each of them, and takes a seat. "I know you ate a lot at dinner last night, but you're probably still hungry from yesterday and your metabolism has increased in general."
Four pod like things with splits down their middles and cracked open like ripe melons are sitting on the end of twisted black stalks, thick like branches. Each is sticking straight out of the man's back from different areas in various heights. To Sherlock's eye there appears to be no pattern to where they've erupted from the pale flesh.
John comes to Sherlock's side of the booth and sits down right next to him. He slips his arm around Sherlock and pulls him close. They are pressed together from knee to hip and hip to shoulder.
Sherlock purses his lips in disappointment, but on reflection he knows that John is right. He doubles down and shoves the food into his mouth, chewing and swallowing as quickly as he can, pointedly ignoring John's amused smile.
Found in his bed by his wife after she came home from a weeklong business trip. He had stopped answering her calls two days prior.
John slowly raises his arms and hugs Sherlock back. It's comforting to feel the subject of his affection (God,
Between gravity and his contractions the shoulders pose no issue and quickly follow the baby's head out of him and he places his hands beneath himself to catch his second child.
How can John keep putting up with him if he can no longer do the work? That's the trade off after all: he provides excitement and John puts up with his moods. John will try to fix him, but when he can't help he'll become frustrated and leave. Sherlock suddenly realizes that his tail has puffed up and  he's snarling at the thought. He rolls to his front again and sighs.
"Yes, Sherlock, they are." John finishes with his tea and goes to sit on the couch. Sherlock is getting far too close to the truth. But there hasn't been a case in weeks, and Sherlock is bored, so he's making deductions and following John around the living room like he's a serial killer he's trying to figure out.
Sherlock allows himself to process some more, and finally understands what John is really saying. He feels his heart (foolish) spark with a tiny bit of hope.
“Yep.” John smiles at him briefly, lips still closed. That’s when Sherlock remembers how they got into this situation in the first place.
“I refuse to have a crush on Sherlock bloody Holmes. We are friends, and we will stay friends, because he does not feel that way about me. I’m not even sure I feel that way about him.”
"Yes, that's it. What about sex has got you all worked up?" Now Sherlock has his hands on the coffee table, leaning in to John's face as though he's trying to dig up his memories and transfer them to his own head.
"Oh yeah? Well I shall after dinner then. Thank you." John smiles at Rosie and then looks over to Sherlock who's still under the blanket on the couch. Sherlock gives John a small smile. John goes to return the smile, but is suddenly caught off guard by a small hand pushing his face back towards Rosie.
He's wants the baby out of him, so he rolls onto his front onto his hands and knees. His legs are spread and he pushes himself into squatting position. The change is nearly immediate as gravity begins to help. The baby presses hard against his opening and begins to finally slip out. Sherlock bears down as hard as he can and begins to stroke his renewed erection, hoping an orgasm will help as it did with the first one.
And with that Sherlock flips John over and as promised begins to thrust in and out of John quickly and roughly. His rythym is erratic but his pace is constant.
John feels Sherlock shift and then the tentative touch of his hand on his waist. He can feel the heat of Sherlock's hand through his sleeping shirt. It's a warm comforting feeling.
He rolls onto his back, brings his hands down, and steeples them under his chin. His tail curls up between his legs and wraps around him once more.
He's all but ceases breathing as John coaxes him to turn over facing away and then proceeds to wrap his arms around him.
When John asked who he was, Sherlock didn't even glance at him as he said, "Mycroft." And nothing else.
The world is breaking up, the meadow fading and the sun shining brighter and brighter. Sherlock can't feel John anymore. Can't feel anything.
John leaned in towards Sherlock and Sherlock leaned towards him and they gave each other a solid kiss on the lips.
John shakes his head, "Yeah, I'm fine. Just suddenly realized how warm it is in here." He walks around the table and opens the kitchen window a crack. An ice cold breeze drifts in.
Lastly, he had no sense of personal boundaries and that's the part that was really driving John mad. Cold and aloof, the detective would come and plop his head down in John's lap while he was on the couch and expect John to stroke his hair and give him scratches behind his cat ears. (Which John always did, but it was the principle of the matter.)
John is glad that Sherlock was so forthcoming about his incredible Foodsense that first night they ate out together, explaining how he was very particular what he ate and where because nothing ruined a good meal like a chef's particular inability to keep their mood in check while the cooked.
He opens his eyes as he hears Sherlock's chair scrape back on the floor, Sherlock is now standing opposite of him beyond the table. He starts to step towards John, but John can't have him near him right now. He raises a hand, "Don't."
Sherlock continues to put away the groceries. "Yes. We were in the middle of our second watch as a matter of fact. She liked the Mickey one a lot as well as the whales. The butterfly one and the forest nymph one scared her a bit I think, but she didn't complain."
His eyes drift to the faded cat scratch on his arm. He must have been infected with...with something. This is too bizarre and he's too exhausted to consider what's happened to him further. He manages to stumble back into his room and into his bed. He doesn't want to lie on his back because it forces him to acknowledge his tail, so he lies spread-eagled across his sheets on his front. His tail lies quiescent, a black line rising from above his pert bum, down the line of his crack and straight down the sheets to his ankles.
John is caught off guard. He wasn't expecting Sherlock to actually elaborate on his thoughts of John and certainly he had never expected Sherlock to admit to thinking about him
After breakfast they move to the living room, take their respective seats, and John takes a deep breath before beginning.
He watches as John quietly steps into his room. He's wearing pajama trousers and an old threadbare shirt. His hair is rumpled. Belatedly Sherlock realises that he's also holding a glass of water.
"When I first died I wasn't entirely sure what was going on. I met others and they explained that the afterlife is what we make of it for ourselves. I truly wanted nothing more then to be with you. And so that's what I got. I have been with you since the day I died. And it's given me a lot of time to think and I would do anything to do it all over again; to have a second chance.
John slips the little patch of fabric to the side and starts to lick and suckle as Sherlock starts to slide back up into him.
"Fascinating." Sherlock sits up in his chair and leans towards where John is leaning towards him. "Then in that case, will you take me to the bedroom John and please fuck me?"
"Well I'm finding it's quite true that there's nothing quite like waking up to a soldier in my bed."
"Ah ok. Well sweetheart Mrs. Hudson is old and only old people are allowed to say that when Sherlock and I kiss. Little girls shouldn't say it."
John can't help but smile at the audible confirmation that his words have affected Sherlock in some way. He slowly starts stroking his hand across Sherlock's back, fingers occasionally grazing the curls at his nape. Sherlock's blush recedes, but his purr remains constant.
Sherlock knows with a startling clarity as John comes up the steps that he will be the end of John Watson.
) warm, alive, and encircled in his arms. He feels the warmth of Sherlock seeping into him, chasing away his thoughts from earlier.
John is hesitant, but pushes his cup over. Lestrade takes a small sip and promptly starts tearing up.
John gives a sigh, "Sherlock. Don't bother lying about it. You clearly know what possibly caused this."
And John thinks, almost hysterically, that they are now the big bang, the creators of a whole new universe because now everything,
"Uh. Sorry. It's just, uh, you. You look. Wow." John manages to choke out. All of the blood he'd usually have used to think having rushed down south. "Are your breasts bigger?"
"I didn't expect to gain anything from telling you John. Though, I did hope, fervently, that you might feel the same."
John snaps out of his lustful haze for a moment. "You had more of vial 35 without me here? What would have happened if you'd had an adverse reaction? Jesus, Sherlock. You can't just take weird liquids and down them without someone watching you."
"John. Is there a reason you keep staring over at me? You've been doing it the better part of the afternoon."
He was just about to pour the hot water into their teacups and now his arm hovers in the air,  poised to pour.
"And I don't think we've wasted all of our young years. I think they were spent exactly the way they needed to be to bring us here."
He can stay awake for days on end, but eventually they catch up with him. Eventually his body betrays him and locks him away for hours inside his mind. He passes out and is forced to relive those months at the hands of others.
Sherlock gives a weak smile, "I'm sorry John. I would never encourage Rosie to refer to me as Papa and please be assured I will discourage it from here on out."
The thought makes him whimper and John is shocked and pleased to see Sherlock visibly turned on by his desperation.
"Hey there love bug," John says as he leans down to pick up his little girl. She's four going on five and starting to get a bit big for him to pick up. "You have a good day with Sherlock?"
A shiver runs down his spine and a heady heat centres in his abdomen as a spark of arousal goes through his groin. He has an intense urge to rub himself and the tightness of his abdomen turns into a soft fluttering squirming feeling again. He looks down his body and sees his cock thicken in his trousers. He's so unbelievably horny. He starts to stroke himself through his trousers when he feels another weird sensation and stares down at himself as he feels his abdomen begin to slowly swell.
He's apparently not alone in anticipation for the current days plans; Sherlock is pouring two cups of coffee while only wearing his burgundy dressing gown.
"Hey, no. You have nothing to be sorry for. Nothing at all." John's voice is soft and reassuring, but it makes Sherlock want to cry all that much more. It's not right that John should be so gentle with him.
John gives a short back of laughter. "No, thank God. Could you imagine the shedding?" He gives another low chuckle before getting serious again, "No, no fur, but there are some behavioural things. Some of which I think you're already experiencing."
He gets up, rounds the table, and places a hand on Sherlock's shoulder. He notes how warm Sherlock's pale skin feels. He knows Sherlock is a man, the same as he is, but he sometimes forgets that Sherlock isn't as cold as the attitude he puts forth. Sometimes he forgets that Sherlock, in so many ways, is more feeling than anyone he's ever met.
John gives a short laugh of his own, licks his lips, and bites his lower one slowly, "Only a few thousand times. Give or take."
The sensation is immediate and electric and Sherlock twitches his ear away from John's touch and jerks his head back slightly.
And with that Sherlock took three more bites and abruptly declared himself done. Then he twirled on his coat and rushed out of the flat.
He never ate on a regular schedule and his love of stinky food was incomparable. (Sometimes John thought he did it on purpose.) He was also prone to hiding dead things around the flat. He always claimed it was for some such experiment or other, but John was pretty sure it was just an instinct.
John leans over the back of Sherlock's chair to look down at the detective on the floor. Sherlock has his arms crossed and is scowling up at John, face pink with embarrassment at his overreaction.
John makes an involuntary gasp. He just isn't used to compliments like that. There was a time when he was younger that he may have received a 'handsome', but that was a long time ago and certainly no one ever told him he was beautiful.
Rosie trots off to the restroom while John and Sherlock stand up and both begin to speak at the same time.
John knows Sherlock meant to say the last bit decisively, but has betrayed himself by trailing at the end like a question. John's heart aches to have Sherlock still so convinced that John will revoke this at any moment, as if John had the power to stop himself from loving Sherlock.
Sherlock let's out a huff of laughter clearly expecting a different statement or question and John can see him relaxing into the mattress.
Sherlock looked over his shoulder from where he was curled on the couch, "Why would I do that when everything clearly is?"
He knows John has his heart and, true, John has said he doesn't need kids to be happy with him; that he loves Sherlock. But the thought eats away at him nonetheless because before they became a couple, kids were definitely part of John's ideal future.
John takes a sip and tastes the familiar warmth, but no sadness or whatever caused Lestrade to cry. "I don't taste anything sad?"
Sherlock keeps his face turned from John, but his ears and tail betray him. His ears twitch down, flattening slightly, and his tail begins lashing anxiously.
Sherlock gives a sly smile, looks back to the body, and says lightly, "Besides, you're adorable when you're distracted by me."
Short but important chapter. Prompts some chit chat in the following chapter which finally leads to the physical consummation of their love.
The fungus moves his body and stands them up. It divests them of the clothes they're wearing and struts out of Sherlock's bedroom naked.
He looks wrecked already, his body flush and his tumescent penis incessantly grinding into John's body beneath them.
Sherlock's eyes go wide and he stops breathing. His body is unnaturally still as the words hit him and wind through him into his heart.
"God. I love you. I will never tire of saying it now that I can. I love you Sherlock Holmes. Have done forever now and likely will forever."
"I wanted to hold your hand. I know it sounds so simple, but. I." Sherlock swallows tightly. "When I...died. The last thing I did was hold your hand before they took me away and I just wanted to feel your hand again, warm and in mine."
John swears he can feel the temperature in the air drop a few degrees and a lifetime of dealing with other people's tensions has him up and off in the kitchen in a flash.
Sherlock turns the darkest shade of red John's seen yet and starts blinking rapidly, his mouth falling open, clearly speechless.
They're must have been something in Sherlock's breast milk, because they had sex four more times after John's stomach settled, before they were finally spent in every sense of the word.
"Oh." Really, it's the only response John can manage. This is unchartered territory, outside the normal bounds of their conversations.
Rosie puts on what John has begun determining her 'deductive face' because it looks so similar to the level of concentration Sherlock has on his when deducing.
Lestrade puts up a placating hand, "What I mean to say is that anything he's ever made for me has either been blander than sand or absolutely bitter."
John snaps his focus back to Sherlock. "Yes, of course." He avoids eye contact with Sherlock and turns back towards his blog.
He can't even say the words. He feels like his heart is falling and by the end of this conversation it will hit the ground and shatter.
"A new wife? Sherlock, I- Sit down." John takes a seat in his chair and Sherlock takes a seat in his. They've been pushed much closer together to make room for the Christmas Tree.
He doesn't realise immediately that John is at the door, in fact he doesn't realise at all until John gently calls his name.
He looks into the sweet-smelling murky soup and grimaces at the idea of drinking it. While it smells nice, it does consist of other
They are filled with soft fur but most definitely a second set of hearing organs. They lead into his head the same as his regular human ears do.
John felt it as Sherlock's blunt head pressed against his hole. Slowly he pressed down as Sherlock pressed up. So slowly it was agonizing. John wanted to press down quick and hard, but Sherlock had his hands on his hips preventing him from doing just that.
"Because I thought you knew I loved you and didn't want me to. I thought you knew and now I know that you don't. Didn't. And that's my fault. I should have. I should have just said. I love you. Always have."
"You can't." His voice is deep and quiet, but he knows John heard him because he tenses up next to him.
It suddenly occurs to him that he had been screaming. He's glad Mrs Hudson is away, for he surely would have given her a heart attack with the noise. He's not so glad John isn't there because he needs a doctor.
"Sherlock." John says softly. Sherlock watches him silently waiting for him to continue, but John just smiles at him, his eyes searching Sherlock's face. Sherlock can feel John's fingers rub his skin where they're positioned against his wrist. He wants to sigh and slump into his seat, the affection in this simple touch threatening to undo him.
John looks over at Sherlock's feet, but doesn't let his gaze travel any higher. "No. Not yet at any rate."
John must sense his wakefulness because he stirs and pulls Sherlock closer to him. "Mmm. 'Morning Sherlock. You okay? Did you sleep?"
John finished cooking breakfast and sat down with Sherlock. They ate in silence for a few moments until Sherlock suddenly announced that he had some errands to run.
He sits down on the floor, which is covered in a bloody wash. He grabs his son too and leans back against the cabinets cradling them both. They're quiet and soft, wrinkly and ugly, but in a way that's beautiful to him. They begin to mouth at his skin and he gently guides a nipple into each one's mouth.
Sherlock feels John pull back from him so he takes the opportunity to roll over and face him. Sherlock notes that John doesn't remove his hand from his waist. Sherlock searches John's face, who is currently looking at him with equal parts bafflement and concern. Sherlock just shrugs.
John began laughing and Sherlock glared at him before demanding John get one of his older outsized vests.
John puts Rosie down, but instead of running off she tugs on Sherlock's pant leg. "What did you wish for?"
Sherlock looks at John's face and from eye to eye. He whispers in awe, "You do." Then he leans his head forward onto John's shoulder.
And still he's cold all the time. Cold with or without a fire in the hearth. Cold in the sunlight. Cold in the summer.
John strokes the base of Sherlock's tail and Sherlock begins thrusting harder and more erratically, sliding slickly with precum and sweat.
Is John that calm because he has an ulterior motive? He's a doctor and Sherlock has just become a medical mystery. Is that where his concern comes from, or was he being sincere when he said he was Sherlock's best friend?
A knock on the door and Mycroft enters before either can invite him in. John instinctively doesn't like the smarmy way Mycroft enters and sits in
He won't get lost, but that's what they'll think when they eventually find him. He wonders if they'll find him frozen in the depth of winter or partially rotted and torn by local animals as spring blooms.
