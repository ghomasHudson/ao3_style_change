Cas shook his head and pushed against him, using his angel strength just a little. He needed his space, needed to gather his thoughts. He watched as, for the first time, Dean's anger vanished and looked truly shocked. “Yes I need to. But I need you more!” His voice had risen and he was practically shaking with his anger. “Why don't you understand yet? I need you so much that this is killing me, slowly. Its killing me that your pushing me away again. I can't… I can't walk out that door. Not without you. We'll find him together. Because I need you. Because I fucking love you!”
It had felt like forever since he'd first touched the break, but finally the car came to a stop. He could feel the tension in the car and he quickly remembered Cas. He looked over his shoulder and instantly calmed to see he was okay, confused, but okay. It was stupid really. Cas was an angel and a simple car crash wasn't going to hurt him, but he had to be sure. Then he glanced at his brother, to see an equally confused look on his face.
He did just that. When he returned to the main room, Sam was on the phone. He waited, listening, back turned to him. Didn't see Dean.
“What do you want, Dean?” Dean frowned in confusion. “What do you want with me?”
This felt so perfect, so right and he forgot, just for a moment, why he would have thought to deny either of them this. It was everything that he needed, it was everything he would ever want and this settled something inside of him, making him sigh with relief at finally having this.
Then the image pushed forward. Cas. His blue eyes full of love and understanding and trust. The image of him pushing into Cas, hearing him moan in pleasure. He sped up his movements, unable to stop as the thoughts of him sliding in and out Cas took hold. He felt the girl tighten around him, her mouth wide open in a silent scream. He pushed faster as the image in his head became more vivid. The feeling of being inside Cas, the pleasure that would take hold.
Then Cas felt his own cock twitch, felt the pleasure deep in his own stomach, felt himself filling the hole that surrounded him so completely. He shook violently as the pleasure consumed him, screaming Dean's name.
“Dean?” That gruff voice sent a very awakening shock through his lower abdomen. His eyes sprang open and they caught Cas's again. He was looking concerned and panicked. The sight of it sent Dean spiralling into self-hatred. This is what he'd done to him. He'd made him fearful that at any given moment he was going to run… again.
Please enjoy...
She threw him again. Looking up. Dean stabbed, through the chest, too close to the heart. Rage filled him. Stabbing the angel. She dropped. And so did Dean.
The voice on the other end of the phone is an old buddy of his dad's. “Heya, Dean. I got your message, sorry couldn't answer any sooner, was up to my elbows in vampire blood.” He lets out a small laugh at that. Dean would have laughed if he hadn't been so desperate for news, any kind of news. “Anyway, uh. I have heard something of the sorts.” Dean feels the pounding of his heart at those words. Finally they are getting somewhere. “Two towns over from where you're at now, a warehouse full of dead bodies was discovered about two hours ago.”
“So, you want it to end?” Cas's voice was laced with pain and sorrow and understanding, it broke Dean's heart. He could have sworn he heard a hint of hope as well, surely he'd imagined that. He considered the question. Did he want it to end? He thought back to the last time they saw each other, the way he had pushed him away at the first sign of trouble.
He screamed for him. His voice begging him not to do this. He tried to run to him, to pull him back.    But his brother pulled at him, telling him to hurry. Dean tried to release his grip on him, tried to go after the angel. He couldn't lose him. Not now, not ever. It didn't matter that they weren't in a good place. It didn't matter that they were no longer involved with each other. None of that mattered. The only thing that did was Cas. He was walking into a slaughter.
With too much force, he pushes the chair backwards, the sound of scraping wood on tile screeches through the room. Cas snaps his head up, a question in his eyes. Dean takes no notice of it as he closes the distance between them. With trembling hands, he grips tightly to the angel's shoulder's. He doesn't know the reason for the shakiness. It could be nerves, it could be frustration. Either way, he ignores it.
Dean let out a small chuckle, his eyes growing dark and dangerous. “You think I have feelings for you? That's not what this is.”
A huge part of him didn't want to leave, didn't want to loose this, but another part needed to go, needed to make sure the angels were okay. Why didn't Dean understand his urgency on the matter? Anger started to replace the hurt and sadness. He was always bending over backwards to accommodate Dean's needs. Why couldn't Dean offer him the same curtsey? He voluntarily hardened his own eyes, allowing Dean to know he wasn't okay with this. Dean's own eyes widened slightly at the change, but quickly went back to glaring.
Dean nodded his understanding. Cas didn't know how long, but he promised he would return, that was enough for Dean. “Okay. Just… be careful.”
The deep throated scream startled Naomi. She hesitated, tearing her eyes away from Cas, darting them towards him, her eyes glinting mischievously. His feet were glued to the concrete floor. He knew he should move, to try and stop her. But he couldn't. Frozen in fear. This is what this feeling was. Fear. He'd felt fear before, of course he has. The many times he'd lost Sam, or about to lose him. The many times he'd almost died himself. The many times he'd witnessed his nightmares. The many times he'd lost Cas, or almost lost him. But this time was different. He was in love with him. If he lost Cas now, he would lose himself too.
“I… I thought you had come to your senses and...”
Every time he looked at him, all he could see was Cas, dead and gone forever. He couldn't help it and deep down he knew that the kid meant well. He also knew that Sam was kind of right as well. But he couldn't help it. He hated him, he loathed him, he wanted to punch him. Perhaps demand that he die instead of Cas. Of course that wasn't going to happen.
Before his brain could catch up, he lurched forward, grabbing the angels trench coat and pressed his lips to Cas's. He had no idea why this time was different, maybe it was because of the way Cas looked at him earlier, or maybe it was just the pressure of trying to hide his attraction. He didn't know. All he knew was that he wanted this so badly, to feel those amazing lips against his. Cas's lips were soft and Dean moaned when Cas gasped in surprise. He darted his tongue inside his mouth, tasting him. God, he tasted euphoric. His cock twitched at the anticipation of what this could mean. His heart was threatening to beat its way out of his chest as he slid his mouth across Cas's, but… but Cas wasn't responding.
But the reality of his words hit home. He frowned as Cas started stalking towards him, intentions clear. He was going to kiss him again, and more. Dean held up a hand. “Stop.” Cas did, freezing mid-step. His eyes were wide, terrified. “We...” He licked his lower lip, still tasting the angel on him. God, he wanted more, so much more. “We can't.”
Cas stood, his trench coat slightly flapping with the movement. Dean gulped and licked his lips. He needed to ask, needed to find out what had happened. None of what was happening outside the bunker, to the bunker, mattered, not yet. “W-what happened to you?”
Castiel opened his eyes, darting them around the room. He needed to leave. He didn't want to hear any more. Dean had practically told him it was impossible for him to love him, to feel anything other than friendship for him. This hurt so much, no matter how much he'd already known it, it still cut him deep. He glanced at the only exit, and for the first time he cursed the warding that surrounded the bunker. Dean was blocking the door and Castiel couldn't just fly away.
Those few little words sent a shiver through Dean. He was bringing his angel to the end, he was doing this to him, making him fall apart. “Come for me, Cas.”
He caught sight of movement and he snapped his eyes to those amazingly bright blue eyes. Cas was terrified. He was slowly moving towards him on his hands and knees, his arm stretched out. “Dean?”
His eyes were still closed as a lone tear escaped. Castiel reached out with one hand and gently wiped it away. “Look at me, Dean.” It took Dean a few more moments and a couple of shallow breaths later, he finally opened his eyes. Castiel forced himself to remain calm as he looked at the concern written in those watery, green eyes. “I know you're worried. I am too. But this is something I have to do. Please. I need to know your okay with this.”
He watched as Cas looked away and settled those amazing blue eyes on Sam. Instantly Dean felt himself returning back to some semblance of normality. He was no longer feeling like his heart was about to break free. He could finally breath, could finally suck in a deep, steadying breath.
“I- I can't do this any more, Dean. You either want me or you don't.”
“I get it, Cas. He'll come back.”
Dean offered a sad smile and waited patiently for him to leave. He could sense the hesitancy. He really didn't want to leave. Cas roamed his eyes across Dean, making him feel slightly self-conscious, but he knew what he was doing, so he stayed quiet. This was Cas saving him to his memory because he really didn't know when he'd return.
Cas snaps his head back up. “You know why.”
But Dean did what Dean always does. He pushes people away out of fear. Fear. Of course he was fucking terrified, he was terrified that Cas didn't love him any more, that he didn't really miss him. He was terrified that Cas would leave again. He was so fucking scared of getting his heart broken again. The walls he'd spent years building had crumbled, and it had only taken a few minuets. Now he could feel them slowly rising again.
Dean sighed. “Not that. You think I don't have feelings for you?”
However… However, he could feel that pull, the pull that always took him to Dean. He glanced awkwardly towards the bunker exit, where Sam had left only ten minutes ago. He shouldn't do that, he shouldn't go to him. Before he could even protest against it, he was making his way down the corridor and stopping outside of Dean's bedroom. Hesitating, he took in a deep breath. He should leave, he should go back to the library and wait for Sam to return. He tried to weigh up the two options in his mind. If he went back to the library, Dean would stay stress free and Sam wouldn't get angry with him for making him stressed. But if he entered… What would he even say? Goodbye? No, he couldn't, even if he wanted to, that was no longer an option. He wanted to stay, he wanted to be with the man he was deeply in love with. What if Dean doesn't want to? What if, over the past two days, he's come to a decision that this is too much trouble, that he's better off without Castiel? The pain shot through him at that thought. Decision made. It was the cowards way out, he knew that, but still, it was for the best.
For the past two weeks he'd been trying to figure out what this meant, what it all meant. Dean was the only person in the entire universe who could destroy him. Angels, demons and monsters could do that too, but it would be a different kind of destroy, the worst they could do would be kill him. The way he'd been feeling after Dean pushed him away, to be killed would be nothing compared to that pain. In a way he kind of wished something would kill him, just so he could get a relief.
Dean reached up and stroked his cheek with the back of his hand. Castiel felt content by the small touch as he felt the warmth spread through him. His eyes fluttered shut with pleasure. He opened his eyes again when Dean's hand held his chin between his fingers. “I don't understand, Dean,” he whispered. So he does feel something… but why all of this?
Something happened. Cas was stood there. Dean froze, heart stilling at the sight of his angel standing before him, angel blade in hand and a small smirk playing across his lips. Dean wanted to run to him, to hold him and yell at him and punch him and so many other things.
Cas dropped his eyes to the floor and Dean watched the shame fill him. Good, he should be ashamed. He left, he betrayed him and then he died, he should be regretful. “Everything.”
He slammed the bunker's door behind him. The tears finally came, his heart crushing him. Dean needed sex. Needed it like he needed to breath. If he couldn't get past his fear of having sex with him, he would most definitely go and find it somewhere else.
“Let me heal you?” He was asking for permission and Dean felt his heart melt. This was causing him pain. The realisation came slow, but when it reached the surface, he knew what he had to do. He needed to make Cas believe he was okay. Cas needed him to be okay. Because what had just happened, that hurt him and Cas doesn't need any more pain. Dean might not be able to give him what he really needed, but he could give him this. Slowly he nodded his head. Cas's eyes lit up with relief, a small smile tugging at the corners of his mouth as he reached out to start the healing process.
Cas moved so suddenly, sending Dean to his ass on the bed. He watched with shock as Cas started to move towards the door. Panic pushed all reason out of the window, if there had been a window. He was going to leave again, he was going to leave Dean all alone, feeling the agony of loss. “Wait, Cas!” Cas froze, but didn't turn, he saw that as a good sign.
The entire time he does, Cas is by his side, silently watching as Dean tries and fails to forget.
“No, you can't leave.” He could feel the panic swelling up again as he watched Cas become guarded, and sorrowful, even guilty. He was going to leave, no matter what Dean said. “You can't leave. I didn't even get to answer your question. I'm sorry it took me so long, I was just shocked. I thought you'd left and even if I had come up with a scenario where you came back, that would have been the last thing I thought you would have said.” He was rambling, he knew it and he really didn't care. He could feel the pounding in his head return, he could feel it spinning out of control. His vision was starting to get dark, Cas and Sam was going in and out of focus. He chose to ignore it, needing to get this out. “Please, Cas. I really did mean it. I promise, no more running.”
He dropped his eyes as Dean narrowed his. Would he want to listen? Would he be willing to hear him out again? He tried to push the doubts away and glanced back up to the hunter, praying for the strength he needed to get through this. He knew God wouldn't listen, wouldn't give him what he needed, but he had to try. Somehow it did make him feel stronger, maybe it was just the act itself, but it worked.
After Dean followed, Sam started to explain what Castiel had told him. Dean's eyes widened slightly, darting from one person to the next. “Well, that's a load of crap. You can't seriously believe the bitch, Cas.”
Dean had to step away then. A fist had suckered punched him straight in the gut and suddenly he couldn't breath. Three weeks its been, and Cas has spent it trying to get over him. That thought scared him and he couldn't fathom why. Why did that bother him so much? He knew this was what Cas was doing, he'd said so in the motel car park. But there was something different about the way he had said it and it hurt Dean and he really couldn't wrap his head around why. When they were in the parking lot, it had hurt him then as well. But why? “Dean?” Cas's sorrowed filled voice drifted through to his ears knocking him out of his own thoughts.
Dean gets to packing as quickly as he can, his and Sammy's things, and loads the car up. Cas returns not long after, pulling in next to the space beside the Impala. It looks really strange, seeing Cas drive and he has to stop himself from smirking at the image presented before him.
His nerves were set on fire as he stared at the trench coat clad back. He was really there. He was really alive. Dean was acutely aware of his brother standing behind him, but he couldn't think about him. No, all he could think about was the angel stood in front of him, alive and well. A part of him thought that this was a trick, nothing but a cruel joke. A bigger part of him hoped that this was his angel.
The confusion was still there. What was his brother on about? What was wrong with Cas sleeping? It was kind of nice to see him sleep for once, he never saw that. He searched his brother's face for answers and then it clicked. It all clicked. He raised his eyebrows as the cloud over his mind cleared. He had been completely stupid. Here he was, seething with his own guilt about what had been said and Cas was fucking
Thank you to everyone who has supported this story. Your comments mean the world to me.
Stopping inside a small town, it once again reached out its powers. And nothing. It wants to scream, wants to scream until its voice disintegrates. That, in itself, is strange, because it has never wanted or needed anything, anything except to sleep that is. So this urge is strange.
“We're not sure. We need to figure it out, somehow,” Sam replied, crossing his arms. Castiel knew it was a defensive posture. He didn't like Dean questioning him.
Dean had no idea what had just happened. One minute they were discussing him leaving and the next they were debating over whether Dean wanted to be with Cas. He was honest, as honest as he'd ever been with anyone, including Sam. Yet, Cas still left.
Panic flares up and he snaps his eyes open to stare at his brother, begging him without words. He doesn't want to be left alone with Cas. Not now, maybe not ever. He didn't trust himself. Didn't trust himself to not act on his urges. Didn't trust himself to bring up what he remembered, what he felt. Didn't trust himself to not ruin their friendship.
“What?” he squeaked through his harsh pants of air. He avoided looking the angel in the eyes, hating himself for putting himself out there like that.
Without thinking it through, without thinking how stupid he was being, he surged forwards, towards the building. Only one thought echoing in his mind. Save Cas. Save Cas. Save Cas. He heard his brother whisper his name, scared, worried. But he ignored it. He had to make that sound stop.
Cas pulled his finger out again, then pushed it back in, his pace picking up. Dean moaned, rolling his head. This wasn't that bad. It actually felt kind of nice. But he knew it was only going to get worse or better from here. “Ready for another one?” Dean nodded. He felt another finger prod at his hole. When it pushed past the tight ring of muscles, Dean gasped with pleasure. There was no burning this time, just pure pleasure. His eyes locked with Cas's. Cas was looking at him with awe. It was so intense that Dean couldn't look away. He felt the fingers pumping him, the speed quickening, hitting something delicious inside him.
He didn't have time to respond before Dean was licking and tasting him. Cas grabbed the back of his head, pushing them closer. The kiss was heated, their hands groping each other, as though the other couldn't get enough. Dean moaned and pressed his body closer, trapping him. He didn't care though, he loved the feeling of this. He just hated how he wouldn't get to do this for a few days, at least.
No, he couldn't touch him. If he touched him he would be lost. Dean would lose himself in the other man and he couldn't do that. He couldn't allow himself that. He needed to protect Cas. Needed to make sure he was safe. For Cas, the safest place for him was as far away as he could get from him. Dean jumped to his feet, shaking his head violently. The tears came fast, burning his cheeks. A sob threatened to escape. It was clawing at his inside, begging to be let free.
Fidgeting slightly in his seat, he gripped the steering wheel tighter and felt the urge to break the tension between them. “How are you doing, Cas?”
As he reached the kitchen, the voices grew louder and he stopped just outside, staying outside as he listened. “How are you feeling, Cas?” his brother asked the angel. Dean's heart twisted painfully in his chest. While Dean was having his dramatic meltdown, he'd forgotten Cas was injured.
Cas moved his lips closer, his breath ghosting across Dean, their eyes still trained on one another. The angel didn't stop his movements, instead he sped up. “What do you want, Dean?” he whispered and Dean released a lungful of air.
A few more rocks and he felt the explosion deep within him as Cas screamed his name in ecstasy. A few more rolls of his hips and he was squirting his own come between them, it hitting both their chests. “Fuck, Cas,” he screamed, his eyes never leaving the angels. He slowed his movements as his body shook from the aftershocks. He closed his eyes and kissed Cas again.
Dean turned to leave, unsure of how Cas would interpret what he'd just said. Tiredness was finally taking over his body, making his muscles feel like they were full of lead, making his eyes itchy and heavy. All he needed right now was his bed and his soft pillow. All he needed was to slip into a dreamless slumber and forget about all of this emotional crap. Of course, that was always too much to ask. Dean never had dreamless sleeps, not any more. They were always full of something terrifying and horrendous, usually they consisted of the many horrific things they'd all been through in the past decade. But tonight, tonight he knew that wouldn't be the case, instead he knew he would dream of the angel he would never get to have, he knew he would dream of the rejection and the pain. There was a small sliver of hope, though, and he clung to it with everything he got, needing to have a peaceful night sleep.
Sam has gone. He's no where. Dean has looked.
Dean mumbled about needing some air and stepped out of the car. They had barely been in the car ten minutes, Dean couldn't really need air so soon. Unless it was an excuse to get away from him. Pain pierced through him again, small pin pricks this time instead of the heavy assaulting punch he'd felt before.
He heard Sam heave a sigh. “I'll speak with him. Convince him you need to see Jack.”
It needs to find a way to destroy Castiel the angel.
Dean swerved to the side of the road. Sam shouted 'Dude', and Cas looked questioningly at Dean. Dean's eyes were trained on him in his rear-view mirror. Cas's eyes locked with his and as much as he hated himself for it, he couldn't look away.
Of course. This didn't mean anything. They still had their own responsibilities. So of course Cas had to leave. Cas was leaving. For how long? Would it be days or weeks before he saw him again? He felt the pain reach inside him and twist painfully.
“Sam wanted to know if you wanted something to eat?” Cas's voice was low and gravelly, it went straight to his cock.
Just before the darkness engulfed him, he saw his brother's eyes widen. He knew what was happening. Years of practice had alerted him to the signs. He watched with slight horror as Sam shoved his way past Cas, knocking him sideways, darting towards him, yelling his name.
He closed his eyes as the uncertainty washed through him, gulping hard. The image of Dean with that woman slid through to his closed lids. He had looked so happy, so him.  Castiel knew he had messed with Dean, knew he had probably tilted his grounded life onto its axis and Castiel hated himself for it. He knew Dean saw how his rejection had hurt him, and in turn it had hurt Dean as well.
“What?” Sam's face paled and all the fight left him. It didn't make Cas's anger fade, not even a little. He hated how he was feeling, hated how he was always the first person to be perceived as the enemy, he hated these up and down emotions.
Cas looked at him again, the sorrow back in an instant. “For...”
He jumped up, ignoring how much his body hurt. He made a beeline for the large room and came to a halt at the sight before him. Sam was breathing heavily, hatred curling and twisting around him as he stared at… Naomi's body. Not Cas. It hadn't been Cas. His eyes caught sight of Cas's surprised eyes. He was alive. Relief and happiness filled him to the brim, pushing all thoughts and doubts and fears far from his mind.
He jumped from his bed and started pacing. God, he hoped he was wrong. He hoped that Cas would come back, still be as warm and as inviting as the day he left, still will be his best friend, his family.
The fresh air of the night kisses his skin, she allows him to feel this. A small reprieve to what else he has been feeling. New promises are made, promises of what's going to happen when they reach his brother, what she would love to do to him. He wants to fight, wants to scream. Of course, she hasn't forgotten, this is just a warm up. Everything between here and there is pure lust. When they reach Dean, the real work will begin. She describes it as love.
Of course, he would do everything in his power not to die. It was a hard decision really. Either he dies trying to save the angel, or he dies standing there, doing nothing. Either way, Cas would blame himself. However, he would blame himself less if Dean had made the fatal decision. A phrase he hated more than anything came to mind, but it was utterly fitting for this moment, this decision –
“What?” he snapped, sitting clumsily down on the bed.
Castiel felt his face flush with anger. Why was he talking like he wasn't here? “You think I want to?” he bellowed, his voice rumbling through his chest as his pushed past Dean. “You have no idea what you're talking about, so why don't you mind your own business.”
This was never going to work.
Sam didn't say anything, waiting patiently for Cas to speak and Cas was grateful for that. “Dean wants me to leave.” It was all he could manage to say about it at the moment. Maybe Sam could help the situation, just a little. After all, they had Jack to think about now.
It stood and watched as the last of the light went out from the symbol. Breathing a sigh of relief, it moved onto the next one. There weren't many left now. Just a few more. But the most powerful one of the lot is yet to come. It knows it has the power to destroy it, but that was before it used so much power on the others. Regret fills it to the brim. It should have done that one first. A silly mistake, a human mistake.
He closed his eyes as the memories bombarded his mind. The memory of how he felt being surrounded by all that was Cas, how tight he was. As much as he tried to tell himself that it was just sex, he couldn't help but feel the emotions push forward, couldn't help how he felt. But Cas stopped it. Cas didn't want it. But listening to him pour his heart out, Dean knew he should have just told him. Should have laid everything out. Should have made him understand why it had to be that way. But he couldn't bring himself to. Then Cas had said those dreaded words. But that wasn't what had shocked Dean so much. No, its what he'd said after. He would still be there for him, would still be his friend, would do anything for him, even after his heart had gotten ripped to shreds.
Without thinking, he left his empty glass on the bar and sauntered over to her. He leaned one elbow onto the small round high table and smiled down at her, his intentions clear. She looked up at him through her long, black eyelashes and smiled back, her intentions were also clear.
He once again thought about the many mistakes he'd made since his fall from heaven, since he'd sided with the Winchesters. They had always been wrong when he went off on his own. Then he thought about his time with them, with Dean, and he knew they were stronger together. He knew then that yes, he could promise this, because he needed Dean and Dean needed him. He could do this because they could protect each other, he would have a family, he would be happy. He would be able to stay with Jack. He would be able to hunt with them. He would be able to kiss Dean, to touch him, to have him. And when the time came for them to face the Empty, he would be okay because they would deal with it together. And if they died… if they died doing it, then so be it, at least they would be doing it together.
Cas smiled then, a bright, break your heart smile and Dean couldn't help smiling back. Just feeling the angel's joy was enough to make his own heart soar to the clouds. “And I love you.”
She smiled warmly at him, her head tilting slightly. This made him want to punch her all the more. He had no idea how he was keeping himself under control. “We need to talk.”
The creature let out another deep laugh, full of humour at these words. Terror flooded Dean at the sound. Cas was trying to give himself over and that in itself was enough to send him into a panic. But there was something else, something that didn't feel quite right. He worked his brain again as he listened to the laugh close to his ear, feeling the cold breath tickle the lobe, the rankness of it almost making him gag again. The creature, the shadow or whatever it was, stopped abruptly, leaning in close to Dean's neck. His heart froze in his chest as he waited to see what his next move would be, what answer he would have for the angel across the room.
He'd dealt with all kinds of pain over the years, torture being at the top of the list. But the pain he'd felt at the rejection from Dean was something he just couldn't comprehend. He knew he loved Dean, that wasn't what was in question. Why did it hurt so much? He tried to imagine what Dean would say if he'd asked him and he knew exactly why it hurt. Love and pain bore a very thin line. They kind of go hand in hand.
Suddenly he didn't care that he was Dean Winchester. He didn't care that this wasn't something he didn't do, but everything be damned, he needed to try. Cas was the best thing that had ever happened to him, he was not going to let that go so easily. “Please, don't go. I'm done running. I won't run no more, I promise. Just don't leave me again.”
Casitel smiled and slowly led Dean to the bed. Yes, the time for talking was surely over.
Dean's face lit up with a startling bright smile and Castiel felt himself smile, too. He could do this. As long as Dean kept smiling like that, he could do this.
Their mouths still worked together, but then he felt Dean's cock twitch, felt the warm substance leak from the tip of his cock. Their hips still moved together, but they were no longer kissing, instead Dean was screaming, his lips inches from his. Cas felt his own release coming on, watching Dean loose his control like that made it so much better. He could feel Dean shake above him, could feel him vibrate as he let out stream after stream.
Dean felt his heart pounding in his chest as his breaths started to come faster and faster. Cas was moving his hips, rubbing the two cocks together, slowly and experimentally. “Cas...” he groaned with pleasure, it came out almost as a beg because he wanted, needed, so much more than this small friction.
He needed Cas.
Cas's head snapped up and his eyes narrowed with… anger? Frustration? Dean took an involuntary step backwards at the power of them. Cas pushed away from the car, dropping his hands. He closed the distance between them, his eyes never leaving Dean's. Dean couldn't breath, couldn't think. His palms grew sweaty and he had to hold back from wiping them on his pants. Cas tilted his head to the side.
He tore his way through the bunker, hoping he wasn't too late. The need to be close to Cas was strong. The need to hold him was stronger. His heart was beating erratically.
Dean gulped past the lump in his throat, it hurt like hell, but that was the least of his worries. He should be really pissed, he should make him suffer a little for everything that he did. To be honest, he was very angry, but his relief at seeing him alive and stood there right in front of him outweighed the anger. Dean found himself nodding, and he watched as the joy appeared across the angels features, making Dean's own soar. All he ever wanted was to fight by Dean's side and knowing that Dean wasn't going to make him leave seemed to be enough for him.
As soon as his back hit the door, he choked on a sob, stifling it with his hand as the tears poured down his face. He could feel his knees buckling beneath him and he could no longer find the strength to stay standing.
Warning: Contains descriptions of torture but nothing too descriptive.
Unable to hold his rage back, he punched the tiled wall. Pain shot up his arm and the sound of bones cracking echoed through the bathroom. He bit his bottom lip as tears sprung to his eyes. Shit. He should not have done that. He most certainly had broken it. Another thought pressed forward. If Cas sees this, he's going to want to heal him. That means touching, that means closeness. Dean didn't know if he could handle that right now. At the moment he needed to be as far away as possible from him. But on the other hand, he couldn't not have Cas heal him. First it would raise suspicion in his brother which would ultimately lead to a chick flick moment. Secondly he kind of needed his hand if they were to go up against another angel.
Dean nodded. “Come on, let's go back inside. We still need to figure out what Naomi's doing.”
Dean sighed. “I can't let myself feel that for you.”
A pounding on the door made Dean jump slightly. “Everything okay, Dean?” his brother's voice sounded muffled and concerned.
He watched as Cas took a step back, his mouth hanging open. Dean watched as Cas rubbed at his chest. His heart was falling apart, again, and Dean was witnessing it turn to ashes. Cas nodded once and walked out of the bunker. Dean didn't know what to do? Should he go after him? Try to make him understand? Or should he find some good whisky and just get pissed as fuck?
Anger surged forwards again. Sam didn't even know what was going on. What did he have to disapprove of? Dean caught Cas's eyes again. “Fine. Have your say. Then I'm outta here.” Cas looked at Sam again. Sam nodded and went to leave. “No. Stay.” Sam stopped, glancing at his brother in confusion. Cas looked at him the same way. This was probably the most stupidest thing he'd ever done. But he didn't care. He was sick of it all. Sick of feeling this way. Sick of his brother judging him too harshly. Sick of Cas prodding and poking till there was almost nothing left. Cas wouldn't continue their conversation in front of Sam. “You carried on, in front of him. He stays. So go on then.”
Dean took in a deep, heavy breath, trying to keep himself calm, trying to ease the pain that echoed in his chest. “That's bullshit and you know it.” Cas's eyes widened with surprise and Dean took a step forward. “The empty might not come for you. The empty might not know how to get to this world. And you're just going to jeopardize everything we had for a maybe?”
“Yeah?” His voice cracked and he rolled his eyes at himself. Could he be any more obvious.
Dean shakes his head. The demons probably knew that he'd call Cas, probably prepared for the eventuality, probably warded themselves against him. It was too much to ask. He sits heavily on the motel bed and sighs with tiredness. He's exhausted everything he knows and he's now feeling lost. Cas kneels before him and places his hand on Dean's knee.
He glanced at the bedroom door, knowing that any moment now Sammy would enter, trying to coax him to eat something, to shower, to do anything but lie in this god damn bed. He didn't want to do any of those things, he didn't want to do anything but lie here and allow his mind to numb itself from all thoughts. He'd lost all concept of time. It could have been days, it could have been weeks, or even years, since Cas had walked away. Dean hadn't tried to call for him, he didn't feel like he deserved the forgiveness, not that he'd be willing to give it to him. There was no way he was going to try and earn it back. There was no point. Even if Cas did, miraculously, forgive him, Dean would fuck it all up again anyway. So what was the point?
He placed a gentle kiss upon Cas's lips and then he pulled back and he smiled again. “That could only mean one thing.”
Cas looked shocked for a moment, then confusion filled those pretty blue eyes of his. “Why? I thought you wanted to forget.”
As much as he wanted to, as much as he tried, he just couldn't do it. He'd gone to a bar, tried to pick up a very beautiful woman, with long legs, blonde hair and very seductive eyes. God, he could have done it, before all of this, before he'd bared his soul, this would have been what he'd done. He wouldn't have thought twice about it. But as he gazed down at the girl in arms, all he could think about was the pain and the sorrow and those damn sexy blue eyes. He'd apologised to her, leaving her confused and alone, leaning against the side of the building. He didn't look back, didn't feel even remotely guilty. He knew he'd done the right thing in the end. Walking away was probably the best decision he'd made.
The guilt knotted in his stomach as he held Cas to his chest, as he felt him breath in and out. He hadn't meant to hurt him like that, didn't even realise that was possible. It had been such a human thing to do, to loose control. He'd seen Cas angry, he'd seen him depressed, he'd seen him happy and sad, but this had been none of those thing, this had been Cas loosing control of everything. All the emotions he'd been feeling was out of control and Cas had no clue how to handle any of it.
Everything went dark.
The love that was pouring of the angel became overwhelming and suddenly Dean felt exhausted, mentally. He pushed forward and placed a small, gentle kiss to Cas's lips. He pushed his tongue into the depths of the other mouth, his tongue gently caressing Cas's and he moaned into it. Cas pulled away, all too soon for Dean's liking.
“Sorry.” Dean avoided his brother's eyes. He hated any touchy-feely conversations, but he needed to do this, for Sam. “Sorry for busting your lip.”
The door swung open, banging against the wall. With his head feeling heavy, he lifted it and through blurry eyes, saw Sam standing there, shrouded by the light from the corridor. His chest was heaving, up and down; up and down, his nostrils flared and his eyes zeroed in on Dean.
“I thought it was because you were a guy and I'd never really done it with a man before. I thought that's why I panicked last night. It's not the reason. Yes, I was scared of it but not enough to full on panic.” Castiel shook his head. He wasn't sure he wanted to hear what else he had to say. But he stayed silent anyway. “It was the look in your eyes.”
Dean pulled away, panting. They couldn't do this here. They were in the middle of a parking lot, outside a seedy motel, with Sam mere metres away. There was no way they could. But, God, he wanted to. Their first proper time should be in his bed back at the bunker, where they could take their time, enjoy each other, love each other properly. But he knew as soon as he thought it Cas wouldn't care where they were, he would still love him, would still show him, would still make it amazing.
Cas stood abruptly, backing away, his eyes growing hard and Dean knew what he was doing. He was putting a wall around himself because he could sense what he was going to say. The sight of it broke his heart. He hated himself more than anything, right there and then.
Cas stayed silent for a moment. Dean guessed he was trying to figure out how to say what he was thinking, either that or he was thinking of a convincing lie. Dean suspected it wasn't the latter. Cas wasn't capable of lying, not to Dean anyway, and not about this. Sure he's lied in the past, but that was about the world-ending crisis that had been going on in the moment, something Cas was very familiar with. Emotions, feelings, being in love, all of that, Cas didn't have a first clue about. That wasn't something he could lie about, not really.
He can't finish that thought. Won't allow it. He will not lose his brother, not ever again. It won't happen. He forces the car to go faster, his head swinging from left to right, his eyes darting from person to person, from car to car, from object to object.
If it was, if this was really Cas back from the dead, what would happen now? Could he just forgive him for the betrayal, for him leaving again? He had to believe the answer was yes. Cas had died so many times in the short years that they'd known each other, but this time was by far the worse.
“Yeah. Cas and me had a chat. All's good now, Sammy.”
Dean was selfish. He already knew that, that's why he wanted to protest against it. He wanted to keep him close, keep him safe, indulge in the sexual tension between them, silently, of course. It wasn't a good idea and he understood why Cas needed space. “For how long?” He couldn't keep the longing out of his voice, couldn't keep the hope out. Yes, he hoped. He hoped for Cas to eventually return, hoped they would still be friends. This hasn't destroyed them, it can't have. This can't be what breaks them, not after everything they'd been through.
“Dean, it's okay.” No its not. Its not okay, because he'd almost lost him. This was why he didn't let himself love. This is why he didn't let himself have what he wanted. They always end up dead. Every single time. Leaving him alone, to nurse the hole they would always leave behind, the hole that was punched straight through his chest. Abruptly, he pulled away, dropping Cas. He crawled backwards, his eyes wide and fearful. Cas looked at him, his own eyes wide and shocked at the sudden change. Then his eyes narrowed. Dean just shook his head. No, he couldn't do this. He couldn't have this. He will die. He will die and it will be all his fault. He needed to protect him. Protect him form the dangers that followed Dean around like the plague.
Of course he did. This was typical Dean behaviour, anything uncomfortable or involving anything remotely in the direction of emotions he would drown himself in alcohol. “I will go and find him.” Before Sam could argue, Castiel was gone.
“Please, don't go.” He was back to begging again and he was more than okay with that, even if his brother was watching with a shocked expression. Dean Winchester never begged, pleaded or showed any kind of emotion except rage, everyone knew that.
Cas turned to leave but Dean reached out and gripped his trench coat sleeve in his fist with a blind panic. Cas froze but didn't turn. “Don't leave, please.”
Now he had time to process his thoughts, he wondered what would have happened if he'd jumped the counter and placed a bruised kiss on Cas's lips. Arousal swam through him at that thought and he shifted uncomfortably. He shouldn't be thinking like this. He shouldn't be having sexual images of his very male best friend.
This can't be happening. He can't lose his brother.
Anyway, I think you've waited long enough, so here it is... finally!
“What the hell is wrong with him?” Sam asked looking away from his brother to look at Cas.
“Okay, well I think I found where the demon might be hiding. We should check it out.” What? How long had he been sitting there for?
“Are you sure, Dean?” Was he? Was he sure? Before he could comprehend what he was doing, he was nodding. That same finger breached his hole, entering him ever so slowly. Dean couldn't breath as he felt a slight sting. Once Cas's finger was completely in him, he held still. “Breath, Dean.”
Crimson, metallic, thick.
The angel reached out and grasped his hand, his eyes instantly softening. But there was something else there, something Dean couldn't describe. He stopped his movements as he felt the firm grip. Once more he was starting to feel grounded again, he could feel his flee instinct subsiding, if only a little. The urge was still there.
Cas couldn't stomach this any more. He couldn't hold his tongue. He knew this was a bad idea, knew he should leave it alone but he couldn't. Something in him just snapped. “What makes you so sure she was lying?”
Dean fakes a hurt look. Although he's not altogether sure it is fake. “Why do assume I've done something?”
This was going to be one long hunt. That he was sure of.
Dean cursed under his breath. What was it with Sam and his timing? Seriously? He glared at him, hoping he would get the message that he was interrupting something, again. But his brother didn't even take any notice, instead he bounded down the few steps that led from the library, waving a newspaper in his hand.
“B-But?” He hated how his voice shook, how it showed just how vulnerable and exposed he was at that moment. Ignoring it, he took a step back, needing the distance to think, to try and figure out what this meant. His mind went over the conversation. Cas had said he wanted to stay by his side. But what did that mean? Cas looked down, shame clouding over his features as he opened his mouth. “No,” Dean felt anger pulse through him. “Don't be a coward. Look me in the eye and say it.”
“We should talk.”
“But in what state of mind? He ran. I think… I think Dean will keep running now. I think he won't stop. It's something… I will have to… live with.”
Strong hands pulling him back. Lips moving. Saying something. Those same hands picked up the wounded man. Castiel thought about stopping him, but something was telling him to let Sam do this. To let him take his brother somewhere safe. He needed to follow. Needed stay by Dean's side. Needed to beg him not leave him. Not like this.
A pull on his shoulder alerted him to his brother, shouting at him. He couldn't hear anything beyond the grunts and heavy breathing that now lay behind him. Cas was stuck in a battle with a being more powerful than him. He needed to help, needed to save him, to kill this thing.
He felt Dean press the tip against his hole, pushing slightly. Pain sprouted but Castiel instantly urged his grace to force it away. He heard Dean hum in appreciation and it just made Castiel feel even more sick. This wasn't love.
His body itched to run to him. It twitched with pent up adrenaline. Something has happened. He knew it had. He can feel it in the pit of his stomach. He can feel the emptiness clawing at his insides. He jumped from his seat and stared down at his brother who was typing away at his laptop. Sam stopped, his fingers hovering over the keys, his eyes searching Dean's face.
“I missed you, too, Dean.” Cas's voice stayed gruff even as a whisper and the sound of it sent jolts of excitement through his body.
After what felt like an eternity, his knees finally hit the hard, tiled floor. His chest grew tight as he struggled to breath. He leant back against the door, his head hitting the wood hard, but he barely registered the pain as he thought about how he would never be the same again. Cas was everything he'd ever wanted and now… now his heart was broken in two and there would be no putting it back together.
Castiel sprang his eyes open as the thought forced its way through. He couldn't keep hurting Dean like this. The only way for Dean to push past these unsettling emotions was for Dean to know that this wasn't affecting Castiel. It was the only way.
Startling him, a hand reached out and gripped his hand. Castiel froze, not looking over his shoulder. “I do want this, Cas. I'm just scared of losing you. If this is something you have to do, then okay, I support you and I will wait for you. I will be here when you get back.”
“You can tell me anything, Cas, you know that.” He manages to keep his voice soft, not wanting to scare the other man away, not wanting him to shut himself off, like he's done so many times before. Those times, when Dean has pushed too hard, bad things had come from it. Not this time. He won't allow it.
He moved to the edge of the bed, waiting to see if Cas was going to say something. When it became obvious he wasn't, Dean carried on. “But, this isn't going to work.”
“Dean, please? You have to eat something. You can't stay here forever.”
He sucked in a sharp breath, building the courage to say what needed to be said, what he was so very afraid of saying. But Cas needed to hear it, needed to know the truth. “Cas,” his voice was barely a whisper and Dean hated how defeated he sounded. But it was the truth. He was defeated. He was so sick of fighting this, fighting what he so desperately wanted. He was sick of hurting Cas, so sick of hurting himself. He was just sick of it all. If this didn't work, if Cas didn't come then he didn't know if he'd ever get over it, didn't know if he'd be able to mend his broken heart and that thought terrified him.
“I haven't known for long. But it's always been there. In every memory of you, of us. It's there. Faint. But...” He shrugged, unsure as to how he should end that sentence. He was nervous now. Cas still didn't want this, did he? Course he wouldn't. Him loving him wouldn't change anything.
“I'm going out for food,” Sam announced and Castiel tore his eyes away from Dean to look back at him. There was silence as Sam made his way out of the bunker, Impala keys in hand, the only sound were his footsteps against metal, then the slam of the heavy door.
In the morning, he would act as though everything was fine. He didn't want Sam to grasp onto something being wrong, he would never hear the end of it. He didn't want Cas to know this bothered him either. Everything needed to appear normal and fine.
He didn't think he could.
He hoped neither would happen. He hoped when Cas returned, they would be back to normal. Friends and none of this awkwardness. It was too much to hope for. Things would always be different, that much obvious.
Agitation hummed through its vessel. This isn't going how he had hoped. Too slow.
“I'm sorry. I wasn't working on finding Sam.”
He sighed heavily, closing his eyes. This wasn't how it should be. This wasn't how their relationship should be. They should be able to kiss each, touch either other, smile at each other without worrying about the other ones response. He knew he had no one to blame but himself, didn't make the situation any easier though.
Castiel nodded. “Yes. I think Dean wouldn't approve, though.”
A sharp intake of breath from behind. Dean turned slowly. Cas's eyes were wide with shock, burning right through him. Dean pressed himself back into his bedroom door. “What?” Cas asked, barely daring to hope. Not wanting to put himself out there, not like he has before.
Cas took another step towards him and Dean fought the urge to run to him again. He can't use physical affection to show him what he feels. No, Cas needed more. He needed this conversation and as much as Dean hated the idea of laying it all out there, he would do anything for Cas, anything. “You. I want you, Cas. I want...” Cas stopped walking closer, eyes wide, his hands trembling, the emotion back. No longer Castiel, but Cas. Dean tried not show he'd noticed and continued, “I want all of you. I want...” He closed his eyes and pictured what he wanted. When he opened them again, he was full of determination, determination to get this out, to get it all out. “I want to be able to kiss you whenever I want, hold you whenever I want. I want to go to sleep with you, I know you don't sleep, but I want to fall asleep with you there, right next to me. I want to wake up next to you. I want to talk to you, laugh with you. All of it. I want….”
Before he could formulate what he wanted to do in his mind, he allowed a yelp of surprise to escape  his lips at a sudden movement. He was now on his back and hovering above him was Cas, looking at him darkly. Dean was about to ask what he thought he was doing, after all this was suppose to be Dean showing Cas just how much he wanted him, needed him. He didn't get a chance to say anything because a sudden rush of cold air hit his now free cock. He looked down and low and behold, he was completely naked from the waist down.
Panic flared itself within Dean. Was he about to close himself off from all emotions? “I… I don't understand.” He thought he understood, he needed Cas to confirm it for him. He needed Cas to say it.
“If you're not here to kill me, what are you here for?” Cas asked, his voice full of curiosity and confusion as he cocked his head and frowned. Dean almost burst out laughing at the sight, it was so familiar, so Cas, it didn't seem to belong there in that moment.
He continued to move slowly, too slow, holding back his urge to just ram home. But eventually he reached the end. His balls now hitting Dean's ass. They both moaned at the contact, both breathed heavily. Cas could feel his heart beating erratically, needing to be released. It was all so overwhelming, so many sensations that he didn't know which one he should concentrate on. He knew he was gripping Dean a little too tight, digging his nails in to his soft skin, but he couldn't bring himself to stop. He felt Dean shift, testing the feel of him inside and when he moaned lowly, Cas knew he could move. And he did, deliciously slow, pulling almost all the way out and then pushing back hard, sending Dean shifting forward. He groaned again and so did Dean, although his was muffled by the pillow. He moved again, mimicking his last move and they both groaned again. It was so amazing, so perfect. But he wanted to hear Dean, wanted to hear the way he could scream for him.
Cas looked at him with so much love and understanding it hurt. “It's okay, Dean. Go. We'll just have to resume this when you get back.”
Sam's eyes filled with excitement. Perhaps he needed to get away for a few days, which was the same need he'd had a couple of days ago. Now, though, he was quit content to sit there in the calming silence with Cas by his side, smiling and kissing and talking.
That's exactly what he did before he could talk himself out of it. He landed in the same room Dean had kissed him, his eyes instantly fixated on the wall where he'd been pinned against. The room was eerily quiet and it sent a shiver down his spine. He gazed around the room with his blue eyes and they caught sight of Dean. Still on the floor where he'd been thrown to moments ago. Breathing hard. Tears rolling past his closed lids and down his flushed cheeks.
Dean offered him a small, shy smile, feeling the warm bubble grow. “I'm going to kiss you again.” And he did. It was just a quick, reassuring one that had left them both wanting more, but it didn't stop the smiles from growing, and it didn't stop them showing their love for one another.
“What's me?”
Too much prodding. Too much time to think.
Cas sighed and dropped his gaze to the floor. “Stay,” he whispered.
Dean shook his head. The sound of his gruff voice sent thrills through his system, making him want to lunge for the angel and press his lips to his. A new wave of self-loathing shot through him again. How could he think of doing such a thing after what he'd done to him already?
Supernatural – Supernatural – Supernatural – Supernatural
“I'm sorry, Dean.” Oh, so it was Cas who had decided to speak first. He should have expected an apology, all the guy does is apologise for something.
Dean looks over at him and their eyes lock. For a small breath nothing else matters. They are so close and all Dean has to do is lean over an inch and they would be bound at the lips. He gulps past the lump forming in his throat. On some level, he knows he needs to move, knows this isn't a good idea, especially with his brother to worry about. He just can't seem to put that thought into movement.
Sam took a step closer, his eyes softening with compassion. “Yeah, he did. Thing about Dean is when it comes to any kind of emotions, he needs a massive push. If you just give up on him at the first hurdle, he will believe that he deserves it, that he wasn't meant for anything like that. He will resist, maybe for a long time. But… I think he will eventually cave.”
He released his hand, his eyes not wavering. He wanted nothing more than to engulf him in a hug, to tell him it was all going to be okay. But he couldn't. Dean didn't want him, he didn't want that comfort from him. Plus it would be a lie anyway. It wasn't going to be okay, it may never be okay again.
He watched as Cas took a step forwards. The darkness was starting to close in and he could feel himself swaying on the spot. His body ached from being so weak, his stomach felt empty and he could feel the bile rise up. His breaths started to come fast and short, trying to take back the control he seemed to have lost over his body. He shook his head, needing his vision to return to normal.
Sorry there is a lot of angst in this one.
A light tap sounded on the door, startling him. Slowly, and carefully, he extracted himself from Cas, trying desperately not to wake him and moved around the bed to answer the door. When he swung the door open, he saw Sam's grim face. He didn't look very happy, in fact, he was using his 'I'm happy for you and everything, but we have a major situation here' face. Dean sighed, and placed a finger against his lips. Sam nodded his understanding and stepped back, Dean followed, closing the door softly behind him.
His heart ripped through his chest, sending jolts of pain shooting throughout his body. Collapsing on the floor, he barely registered the pain in his knees as they hit the concrete. Tears fell, silent and commanding. He was too late. He'd missed him. He'd prayed and yelled for close to an hour, begging for him to come back, pleading with him to believe he was sorry. But the he didn't come. Silence rang through his ears, deafening him. Longing cascaded through him, longing to hear the flutter of his wings, to hear his gruff voice bellowing his name, longing to see his piercing blue eyes; even if they were going to hold contempt and hatred. Dean didn't care. He just wanted, needed him here.
“But you should.”
He turned from him then, regret filling him. He shouldn't have said that, he knew that, but there was no going back. He was too busy wallowing in his own self pity that he missed the whispered reply. He turned sharply, eyes narrowing. “What?”
“Dean?” His voice again. Scared. No, he didn't want to hurt him. Didn't want to cause him any more pain. He should go to him, comfort him. He itched for it. But he couldn't. Which was the worse case? He needed to protect his life not his feelings.
“Why? Why shouldn't I Dean? Give me one good reason.” His voice turned to begging, to pleading. The anger was disintegrating, petering out. He needed to know why they couldn't do this. He needed this.
“Dean?”
Abruptly he pulled away, released his ass and smiled at Dean's raised eyebrows. “I love you, too.” And without waiting for a reply, he turned and walked back to the Impala, slid in and slammed the door shut. He looked out at Dean and felt his heart sink as they left him behind.
He brought her a couple of drinks, they laughed, they flirted and then finally she asked if they wanted to get out of there and go some place more private. He agreed without a second thought. As he followed her through the crowded room, his thoughts automatically went back to the angel and his gut twisted uncomfortably. He watched the woman's ass sway from side to side and pushed those traitorous thoughts to the back of his mind.
“Dean!” His brother's voice was a warning. The look in his eyes said, 'stop sacrificing everything for everyone else'. Sam was right. He wasn't just sacrificing his own happiness, he was sacrificing Cas's. He couldn't do that.
He stepped into the darkened room, only a soft glow of a lamp was the only light but he could see Dean clearly, lying on his back on the bed, one arm under his head and eyes closed. He closed the door softly, suddenly unsure of himself now. Would Dean beg him to leave? Could he do it? He didn't know if had the strength do it again.
Dean's eyes roamed to the motel bathroom, where his brother was currently having a shower. He knew Sam had sensed something going on, and Dean didn't have the energy to try and hide it. He looked back at Cas and wondered if he should make conversation. There was nothing worse than small talk but Dean was desperate to break the uncomfortable silence. Cas hadn't looked at Dean since the car park, hadn't said a word and it left Dean feeling the loss of the easiness that was their friendship.
“No, Dean. He cried non-stop for six days. After that he wouldn't talk to anyone, wouldn't acknowledge anyone. Begged for you to just open your eyes. He was drowning in grief.” Pain pulled at his heart. Shit. Had he really been broken up about his impending death? Sam wasn't finished. “The doctors wanted to turn of you monitors days ago. I agreed. There was no way you were going to make it. I'd come to accept it. Cas couldn't, wouldn't. He argued with me. I finally allowed it. Cas needed to wrap his head around it first. Today he finally agreed.”
Sorry for such a long wait. I'm an awful person. I had a huge problem with the chapter, I was unsure where I wanted it go. But I got there in the end.
Dean bulked back with surprise, his eyes widening again. Whatever Cas had come to say, he clearly hadn't expected those words and Castiel prided himself on it, just for a moment. “About what?” Dean's voice broke with nervousness, unsure of where this was going.
Castiel felt that small slither of hope again and he desperately started to push it down. “Why? He's the one that made it very clear to me that he can't allow himself to return those feelings. Why would he care if I stop or not?”
“Hello, Castiel.”
A huge part of him wanted to uncurl himself from the man lying next to him, he wanted to exit the bunker and just breath in fresh air, wanting the distance to allow himself time to think. A smaller, more insistent part of him told him that it was a bad idea, that Dean would panic when he awoke, would fear the worst, his heart breaking. He couldn't do that to him, he couldn't allow him to feel the same pain he'd been feeling over and over again.
Dean yelped as he was thrown against the warehouse wall. His back colliding with the concrete. After he dropped to the floor, he allowed a groan to escape. Looking up, he caught sight of his brother, knocked out. There was only one demon left. The other two lay motionless mere feet away. The last demon rushed towards him, his black eyes gleaming at him, excitement evident in them. He tried to move. But his whole body hurt. The demon grabbed his jacket, twisted him around, about to punch him. This was it. This was the end. Where the hell was Cas?
“Leave Sam to me. You're coming and that's final.”
“Terrified. You've almost done it. You've almost destroyed me, Dean. If I stick around and then you run again… I don't think… I don't know if...”
He opened his mouth, not sure what he was going to say. His brother beat him to it. “Cas is your best friend. He's family. And you just kissed his face off. What the hell, man? I don't know what's going through your head, but you can't do that. Not with him. Not ever.”
Dean froze. He turned angry eyes on him. His chest was rising and falling fast. Castiel's shattered heart was breaking into even more pieces if that was even possible. Tears were streaming down Dean's face.
. He knows Cas is probably worried about him. Shame floods through him. Cas wouldn't judge him for getting blind drunk, not like his brother would have. Sam would have already tried to have a
Cas sighed and pulled him back towards him, making their bodies flush once more. Dean's heart picked up speed and he couldn't help the crooked smile grace his lips. “Promise me something.”
Dean snaps his head up, eyes round, mouth open slightly. This isn't Cas, he wouldn't just not work on it. Something else is happening and it leaves him feeling irked because he doesn't know what's going on with his friend. “What?” he manages to squeak out, standing up and closing the distance between them.
Dean closed the gap between them, until he'd felt the ghost of Cas's breath against his lips. Not taking his eyes off the angel he spoke, keeping his voice a whisper, wanting Cas to understand he was anything but angry. “I love you, Cas.”
“I – I don't care what your called.” His voice sounds funny, scratchy, but he doesn't break the fierceness that's in his eyes. He doesn't allow his weakness to show. He remembers the knife that's in his sock and decides to wait, wait for the opportune moment.
“Dean-”
He listened to Cas inhale a shaky breath, his eyes slowly latched onto his. Dean wanted to scream at the look in his eyes, the sadness and the pain was so clear, it had no place being there, not when Dean was offering to be in this with him, not when he was putting himself out there for all to see. Doubt clawed its way forward. Had he finally done irreversible damage? Is this finally the moment that he would tell him to stick it, that he's had enough? Dean gulped past the lump in his throat, praying silently that this was not going to be the end, that he could actually fix this.
“You heard me. You're just finding reason after reason to end this. If you don't want this, at least tell me straight instead of using excuses.” Those words hurt, but there was no way he was going to show Dean that.

Driving back to the bunker in the early morning light wasn't easy, for both Dean and Cas, even Sam could feel the tension between them. Nobody said anything, nobody needed to. It was clear to everyone how this next part was going to go.
He cleared his throat, alerting the hunter to his presence. He quickly averted his eyes, knowing Dean wouldn't appreciate being ogled in this current situation. “I've brought you some coffee.” His voice was low and barely audible but he knew Dean had heard him.
Dean finally released his brother and signalled for his brother to go check out the rest of the bunker. He couldn't leave Cas yet, he wasn't ready. The grief was slowly starting to seep back in. But when he looked at his brother, who hadn't moved yet, he noticed that Sam wasn't even looking at him. Instead, his gaze was focused inside Dean's room. His eyes were wide and his mouth hanging open.
He licked his lips and watched with amazement as Cas followed the movement with his eyes. They darkened even more, something Dean didn't know would be possible if it didn't just happen. “You, inside me, now.”
He took a couple of steps backwards, his back hitting his Impala, and he leant casually against it, his arms across his body as he took in the sight of the angel. God, he looked amazing, really amazing. He latched his eyes onto Cas's, who was looking at him with patience and caution. He was unsure of what was going through his mind. “I want to be.” He kept his voice soft, laced with care and love.
Dean was willing to try again, was willing to give him another chance. That should have made him happy, should have made him soar with joy. Could he promise this? He really thought about it, really and truly thought long and hard. The silence stretched between them and Dean waited patiently, knowing that Cas really needed to think about this because neither of them took promises lightly. He really needed to mean it if he was going to promise.
Yes! He wanted to scream it, wanted to show him just how much he really did want to. But something was holding him back. Dean let his hands drop as disappointment swept across his features, but he didn't take a step back and Cas was grateful for that. He thought about what Dean had said, thought about how he'd felt over the past couple of weeks, or even months. He'd been hurt so many times. Could he really risk it happening again?
“You just kissed him, Dean,” Sam spat, taking a step towards him.
He was broken and nothing was going to fix him. Nothing except Cas.
He pulled open the door of the Impala and climbed in. He smashed his hands onto the steering wheel and screamed in a furious outburst. He wasn't going to let Cas get away with this. He was going to show him that no matter what he shouldn't have said what he said.
Castiel was taken aback by Sam's little speech. What would Dean have to feel upset about? This is what he wanted, wasn't it? He wanted to do what Sam said, he wanted to charge towards Dean, reassure him that everything will be okay, but he couldn't. He needed distance, and he meant it. Going to him wasn't the best idea. “I can't go and talk to him. But perhaps if I told you what is going on maybe you can talk to him.”
- SUPERNATURAL -
Yeah, he wasn't going to run. Not any more. So what if he made out with Cas in front of his brother. He was happy and if his brother couldn't get on board with it then he can go fuck himself. He was happy and he was planning to stay that way for a very long time.
Dean nodded. He could see where Sammy was coming from. Cas just might not be able to call, he might be afraid to be heard. It was the logical explanation. And yet… And yet he couldn't get rid of that feeling in his stomach. It was still gnawing away at it. He sat back in his seat and buried his face in the palms of his hands, letting out a low groan.
Dean didn't say anything as he kept is eyes averted. The pain in his chest was now hollowing out, numbing. He didn't answer his brother, couldn't bring himself to. He knew that if he did, Sam would see it as an opening and he really didn't want to talk. Sam sighed, moving to the side. Dean carried on walking, feeling Sam's eyes burning through his back.
Castiel ignored him and poured the beer down the sink. When he landed his eyes on Dean he watched as Dean went from angry to confused. He couldn't see what keeping this mask up meant for Castiel and he really did try to keep the annoyance in his eyes. “We have a serious situation here and all you can do is drink yourself into oblivion.” He watched Dean's eyes narrow in on him but before he could say anything Castiel was already striding towards Sam.
He watched Cas with wariness. Cas's eyes grew wide and his mouth hung slack. If it had been any other situation, Dean would have laughed at the look. But as it was, this was serious and he'd just bared his deepest, darkest fear. He'd never put himself out there like that before and he was so unsure of how Cas would respond. He shuffled nervously from foot to foot, darting his eyes down to the floor, panic slowly made its way through his system. Had he just made the biggest mistake of his life? Should he have kept his mouth shut?
The doctor moved quickly. Tending to his patient. Calling his name.
Please tell me what you thought. I would love to know. Plus I want to know what you think will happen next. I know its kind of a given. But do you think Dean will go through with it? If he does, who do you think will top and who will bottom? Will there be foreplay? If they do go through with it how do you think they will both react to it? Will there be awkwardness? Or will they just finally be happy?
Then he was striding across the library, up the steps and the sound of the bunker door slamming shut echoed throughout, leaving Dean to feel hollow and alone. He was really gone. Doubt wormed its way in. Maybe he should have fought to make him stay. Even as he thought it, he rejected that thought because seriously, what did Cas have to stay for? Dean couldn't offer him what he wanted, what he needed.
Cas squeezed his hand back, a reassuring gesture that instantly calmed Dean. He was here and alive, whatever came next, they could deal with together.
Cas's eyes widened and then softened. “Of course not.” He tugged Dean gently towards him, pulling him close, pushing his face into his neck. “I don't want to leave. I just want things to change. I want to be comfortable with you. I want to touch you when I want, kiss you when I want, hold you when I want. I want to be able to laugh with you, talk to you, and even argue with you. What we have going on at the moment isn't making either one of us happy.”
It shocks him to find that she isn't just happy, she is practically jumping with joy. Something they have told her, their report, has made her practically joyful and he can't understand why. What is it they told her? If she is allowing him to be awake for this, its because whatever these low-level demons have told her is going to affect him immensely. Is it to do with his brother? God, he really, really hopes not. He feels sick just thinking it, but he knows that this is probably what it is.
He clears his throat awkwardly and turns his own eyes to the motel. It isn't anything different to what his brother and him stay at during a hunt. Just as shabby, just as disgusting and bottom of the food chain. Heaving a sigh, he takes the lead, Cas following closely behind. He knows that the angel is probably glancing around the parking lot, eyes alert for any signs of anything out of place. Dean feels grateful for his presence. If anyone or anything jumps out at them at least Cas will have his back.
talk to Cas. He can't let him do it, though, even if it is for Sammy. He hasn't voiced this yet, no point shooting something down if it doesn't need to be shot down. The longer this goes on though, the closer the argument gets.
“You leaving is for the best. For you. Its for the best. But… you made me promise not to push you away to protect you and… fuck! I can't let you walk out that door without knowing that its been the happiest time of my life too.”
Thank you to everyone who have commented, sent Kudos and bookmarks. Please keep them coming.
Stopping, he turned to face the angel. Cas was worried, fearful. He smiled at him. “Not running.” That was all he needed to say to see the fear vanish from Cas's eyes before he pushed the door open and entered his room.
Knowing that the hug has gone on for too long, he pulls away and avoids eye contact at all cost, waving the angel into the room. He hears the soft shutting of the door and finally turns to face him. Dean keeps his eyes firmly on Cas's chest, still unable to look him the eye. It was awkward, clinging to Cas like that, but it had also felt right and safe and perfect.
He turned back to face Cas, gripping the angels fingers in the palm of his hand. He should have distanced himself from the situation, he shouldn't have clung to him like he did, but hell, Cas was hurting and scared and he had to do everything he could to reassure him that he wasn't going anywhere, not for good anyway. He would hate himself later, for being weak and vulnerable, he would regret this decision, but for now, it just felt right to offer him this comfort.
What the fuck? He thought Cas wanted this. Thought he wanted him. Shit. Now he'd really fucked up. He thought back through all their conversations. Not once had he said he wanted this. Not once had he said he wanted Dean. Yes he loved him, but that doesn't mean he wanted this. Now he felt like a fool. A fool for believing he could actually be happy, even if it was for a second.
The explosion seemed to last for far too long, but in reality it only lasted a few minutes. The smell of burning metal reached Dean's nostrils as he dived for the gun under the table. Logic told him that this gun would be no good against what was coming, but it felt right and safe to be holding a weapon in his sweaty hands. When he looked back up, clocking the trigger, he noticed Sam was also holding a weapon at arms reach, and Cas held his angel blade. All three of them were ready for a fight.
Cas's voice broke through his thoughts and he snapped his green eyes to the blue. He sucked in a sharp breath when the realisation came to him. Cas was really scared. He didn't know why he hadn't seen it before. He guessed it had something to do with feeling his own pain and his own grief, but that wasn't a good enough reason, not in his eyes anyway. He should have seen it. If he hadn't been too proud about breaking down, about avoiding his feelings, he would have seen it sooner. Guilt clawed at his insides as the reality came crashing down around him.
He closed his eyes against the pain of his next words, hating himself for having to say them, but he had to, he had to put them out there. He dropped his hand and opened his eyes. “But you're planning on leaving again, aren't you? That's what you always do.”
The scream tore up from the darkest depths of his stomach, up through his chest, past his frantically beating heart, up through his throat and out his mouth, into the warehouse as the angel blade came down in a swiping motion.
Cas's eyes softened at that statement. “Why?” His voice was just as soft and Dean watched his pain turn to uncertainty, unsure still of where Dean was going with this.
Dean noted down the address of the motel, thanked him and hung up. This news wasn't exactly good news. In fact it just increased his worry. What was Sam doing in a warehouse full of dead people? He put the phone back to his ear. Cas answers in his usual greeting, sending an array of butterflies floating through his stomach. He pushes the feeling away and focuses on telling Cas about the phone call.
As much as Dean wanted to say something, he also figured that Cas might just need space. After all he was new to the whole emotion thing. That put another thought in his head. What if Dean had it all wrong? What if Cas wasn't… didn't have these feelings for him? Not in the way he thought anyway. Or what if Cas wasn't entirely sure what he was feeling? Maybe he should suck it up and be a supportive friend without the panicking from his part. Maybe Cas just needs him to be a friend.
Cas took a step towards them, eyes flaring dangerously as the grip around Dean's neck tightened. He tried to gasp, tried to wiggle away, but the hold on him was unyielding. He tried to imagine what this creature's next move would be, tried to picture it. This thing had one goal and that was to kill Cas. How could he prevent this from happening? How was it going to move forward with its plans while holding Dean hostage? His brain worked furiously, trying to figure out a way out of this, but it came up blank. The pressure increased, forming bruises across his neck, across his ribs. If the hold around his middle got any tighter, he was sure a couple of ribs might snap.
“Are you sure this okay? If you don't want to do this, just say.” He needed to make sure Dean was totally okay with this. If there was even a sliver of doubt he needed to know. This was a big deal for Dean. It was a big deal to Castiel as well, but it was more so for Dean. It all came down to this, the reason Dean kept fighting it, the panic that he had felt.
“I know, Dean,” he finally says, still refusing to look at him. “If I thought you could help, I would tell you. But you can't.” Cas flashes his eyes back to Dean. “Let's concentrate on finding Sam.”
Cas smiled, knowing where that fear came from and willing to reassure him. “Of course.” He kissed him briefly. “I plan on dealing with this case and then coming back to this bed and pleasuring you some more.”
Cas sighed. “No, not if we do it properly. There is a sigil that will not only send it back, but when activated, will keep it there permanently.”
“Have you told him?” he asked Sam. Sam looked up at him, annoyance clear on his face.
He nodded as if expecting that answer. “But why did you want to, Dean?” Dean opened his mouth to say something, but clamped it shut when Cas held up his hand. “Don't be vague.” Another deep breath from him. “What possessed you to do it? What pushed you to decide that it was a good idea?”
Anyway, i think you've all waited long enough. So here it is... finally!!
Dean shook his head. “You can tell me when we're on the road. For now, let's get the hell outta here. I'm dying to kill something.”
Cas let out a sharp gasp as he was swung around and pushed hard against the door. Dean pressed his body close, pinning him to the wood and a hand cupped his cheek. Those eyes didn't soften though, not for an instant. “Why did you have to make me promise, too?”
Slim fingers slid through his short hair, tugging gently and Dean couldn't help the moan that escaped his lips. He needed Cas like he needed air, that much was obvious. Unfortunately the need to breath became too much and reluctantly he pulled away. His breaths came in short as his heart threatened to escape its bone jail. He leant his forehead against Cas's, closing his eyes, trying to concentrate on the uneven breaths of his angel. It soothed him to know that Cas was just as effected by the kiss as he was.
He waited a small heartbeat, hoping beyond hope that Chuck had heard him and would send Cas to him right away. But nothing happened and disappointment slithered its way through his stomach, twisting into tight knots. Of course he wouldn't be given this one thing. Of course he would be ignored. Did he expect anything less? The pain of the reality came crashing through him, making him want to vomit, not that he had anything to vomit up. Cas was gone. He was gone and he was never going to come back. That was the reality.
Cas cleared his throat but kept his mouth shut, keeping his eyes on the man outside. When Cas didn't say anything, Sam looked at his brother again. Dean stood, letting his hair go. Cas watched as his shoulders heaved up and down, slowly and then with a new sense of purpose, Dean strode back to the car and slid back into his seat. Sam looked at his brother with concern and Dean ignored it. Cas was worried. What had that been about? He caught Dean's eyes in the mirror again. Dean looked away quickly.
The tears now spilled past Dean's eyelashes, his eyes pleading with him. “Don't, please.”
He felt a small breeze and suddenly he was inches apart from Cas. He sucked in his third shuddering breath as the heated anger poured off of Cas. Shit. He'd made him angry. Of course he'd made him angry. He had just basically told him that Cas didn't know how to love, not romantically any way.
Once more, he closed his eyes, willing the strength to come forward. He could do this, he thought to himself. Opening them again, he noticed Cas had sneakily gotten hold of his angel blade, ready for the inevitable attack.
He caught Cas's eyes. This was it. He would either survive or die by doing this. But it was the only way. This creature wasn't concentrating on its hostage, it had only eyes for Cas. Both the angel and his brother were being watched too closely, which made this Dean's problem. The only way to get an upper hand was for a surprise attack. Dean had no idea what attack he would go with, he couldn't really think of anything that would ensure he would live, something had to be done, though. And soon. His chances of dying was far too much, but he made peace with it fairly quickly. If there was something worth dying for, it was to save Cas's life.
The scorching water mixed with the salty tears, cascading down his skin. He'd fucked it all up. Fucked everything up. He thought he could get away with it. Get away with having him and not feel anything. He had been so wrong.
“For what?” He tried to keep the shake out of his voice, but was unsuccessful. He could feel the rage building inside him, could feel that at any given moment he could lose control.
His cell rang through the quiet, darkened car, making both brothers jump a little. Sam whirled his head around to face Dean, his eyes wide and surprised. Dean sighed, picking up his cell, facing back towards the road. He willed his heart to slow down before answering. Glancing down at the phone, he frowned with confusion, not recognising the number. He pressed the answer button and put it to his ear. “Yeah?” he grounded out through gritted teeth, unable to hide his bad mood.
He watched as a stray tear fell down Cas's cheek. Dean could see the struggle, could sense it, Cas was trying hard to hold back his own tears, but he was losing the battle. “Because I can't.”
“Be out in a minute.” Dean shouted back. He pulled Castiel back, an apologetic look in his eyes. But he was also scared, fear guiding his next words. “This isn't the end, right? When we leave this room, we'll come right back?”
He drank more. It was like when he was back from hell. Trying to keep the pain and the memories at bay with that burning liquid he loved so much. He tried to forget. But this wasn't like hell. Hell he could forget, even for a few moments. These were emotions he was dealing with, something entirely different. There was no forgetting and there was no getting over it.
Sucking in a shaky breath, he pushed forward. They needed to have this conversation. Perhaps it wasn't the best idea while his brother was in the next room, but he didn't care. If he let this moment pass he feared that he would never have the opportunity again.
Dean pulled away first and it took him a moment to realise what was happening. With his heart in his throat, he was suddenly thrown onto the bed. He opened his eyes to see the devil look in Dean, making his cock twitch with anticipation. They both needed this, the both needed the reassurance that the other was here. Cas licked his lower lip, tasting Dean, feeling the tingle as though his lips were still there.
The feel of those bright blue eyes, raking up and down his face, sent a small thrill down his spine. Disbelief clouded over his features, and for a moment neither one of them said anything. Dean couldn't quite believe he'd said it himself. Of course he wanted him to stay, of course he couldn't just watch him leave, watch him get over him. But could he really do this? Could he finally allow himself to feel this love? Could he really be this selfish? God, he wanted to, so badly that it hurt. It wasn't about what he wanted, though, it was about whether he should.
With nothing more to be said, Castiel exited the room, leaving a very hurt Dean. Castiel didn't care. He didn't care if this hurt them both. Not any more. He walked down the corridor, into the map room where Sam was sitting. He could hear Dean's cries, calling for him, pleading with him to wait. But Castiel didn't, couldn't. He wasn't going to let Dean get away with hurting him any more. Sam's eyes widened as a panicked Dean rushed into the room.
“Cas-”
He tried to get his feet to move, tried to save the man he loved. Thoughts of regret swirled through his mind. He should have told him sooner. He shouldn't have tried to fight this feeling of pure love so much. He shouldn't have hurt him. Shouldn't have caused him pain. He should have shown him just how much he really and truly loved him. Is Cas about to die without truly believing it? No, he can't. He can't die thinking that.
Cas smiled sadly at him and Dean knew. Cas would always remember, nothing would change that. He would always feel that pain. He would always feel that love. It would always be with him every time he looked at Dean, it would always be with him every time they talked. But Dean wouldn't share that pain, wouldn't feel it, wouldn't understand why Cas was hurting all the time. He couldn't do that to him. As much as he did want to forget, as much as he did want to be rid of this hurt, he couldn't let Cas be alone in this.
Needing a distraction, he moves across the room to where the beers are. The desperation to forget everything is forceful, so much so that he doesn't think he can hold back being sober. After staring at the bottle in his hand for a good minute, he lets out defeated sigh. He can't drink himself into oblivion, not yet. Sammy needs him sober at the moment and sober he will stay. He places the bottle back where he got it from.
“I won't get captured, Dean. I promise I will keep my distance. We just need to know about their numbers, a rough estimate.”
The phone hung up and Dean stared at it blankly. Was that a yes or no? Then he heard the tell-tale sign of wings and turned to face Cas. The angel's features were concerned, his gaze drifted up and down Dean's body as though searching for something. Dean's heart warmed to see that he still cared, but punched it down.
This why he'd always told himself that this can't be love.
Please comment!!!!
“Don't run. Please, Dean. Don't run.”
“Dean?”
The thought of grabbing his bottle of whisky from his bedroom filled his mind. He couldn't go there. He couldn't drown his sorrows with booze, not this time. He had to show Cas he was serious, he had to show that he really wanted this, really wanted him, had to show him that he was really going to try.
Nodding, he moves back to the laptop. His worry for the angel is still there, gnawing away at his insides, but pushing it to the back of his mind, he allows his other concern to take front and centre. Finding Sammy.
“This… what I'm feeling, Cas. This can't be love.” And there it was. Dean didn't feel anything for him. Nothing. He knew this, of course. But hearing and knowing it was two very different things. The tears leaked from his eyes as he closed them against the pain in his chest. It felt like someone had reached down his throat and tore his heart out. Dean didn't stop talking and Castiel could hear the pain in his voice. “I can't love you.”
In the distant, beyond his pain, he heard footsteps echo outside his door, growing louder and louder as they came closer. He knew it was his brother, knew he'd heard him. Dean clutched at his stomach, trying to get a grip on himself as the sobs wrecked his body. The silence of the room was deafening and all he wanted, all he needed, was to hear Cas's usual greeting, in his usual gravelly voice, pulling him from this nightmare.
It was Cas's turn to reach up and touch his face, cupping his chin, keeping their eyes locked. “I'm sorry, Dean.” Dean could feel his heart break at those words. He wasn't denying it. Of course he was going to leave. Had he really expected anything else, really? “I'm sorry for everything.”
Dean furrowed his brows in confusion. “What promise?” he spoke in a whisper, again unsure of himself for asking. Castiel hated that. Dean had never been unsure with anything before, never. He was always so focused on what he wanted and needed. But right now, Castiel could tell this was the most unsure he'd ever been.
Not once in his entire existence had he ever felt like this. This was a completely new feeling to him, one he was very easy to label with a majority of different names.
He felt Cas's body over his again and Dean sucked in a sharp breath, awaiting for the pressure down below. All he could hear was Cas's heavy breathing, all he could feel was the gentle caress of his cheek. He wanted to open his eyes, wanted to look deep within Cas and see the love for him, but he couldn't, all he could concentrate on was the prodding of the erection between his ass cheeks.
“Cas, wait!” He saw the billowing trench coat disappear as it rounded the corner, and for a moment Dean hoped that he will see that messy black hair appear, but it didn't. “Cas!”
“Yes. Yes I'm here. I just didn't expect...”
When they reached Dean's room, he practically threw the man inside, slamming the door shut. Dean didn't have time to react. Castiel pushed him hard against the wall, his hands pinning Dean wrist above his head. Dean let out small grunt at the contact, his eyes growing wide. He practically could hear the questions pouring out of him. Castiel could feel his heart pick up speed, could feel his cock twitch with anticipation. He pressed his body closer to Dean's, bending his head to Dean's ear.
(See the end of the chapter for
The bunker shook, like it was an earthquake. Dean landed on his ass, painfully, as did Sam. Objects clattered to the floor, furniture shook and collapsed. Both brothers looked at each other with raised eyebrows. For a single moment, Dean's grief was replaced by shock and curiosity. What was
Dean couldn't hold back the tears from tumbling now. Cas was wrong. So very wrong, in so many ways. He didn't deserve any of that. “It's not about deserving. I'm trying to protect you. This is for the best. Every bad, evil thing we come across… they will use this against us. I'm not just trying to save your life. I'm not just doing it for you. I'm...” Did he dare say it? Yes, he needed to be honest, with himself as much as with Cas. “I'm doing this for me.”
After experiencing this cold indifference he wanted nothing more to see the warm look in his eyes again, to see the love and comfort they could hold. He couldn't help it, the desire to know was too strong. “Everything okay?” His voice sounded weak and broken and he hated himself for it.
Cas frowned with confusion and Dean felt the urge to surge forwards, the urge to kiss him right at that crease. He held back though, knowing how this wasn't the time for such sentimental crap. “I-”
Yeah, this must be a shock for him. “Yeah. Um… could you come back here, please?”
Thank you to everyone who has commented, left Kudos and bookmarks. They do mean a lot to me.
-SUPERNATURAL-
Cas felt his heart droop again and felt the tears sting as they made their way down his face. Why wouldn't they stop? “You… you still want me to go, don't you?”
He fell to his knees as he took in the sight of Cas's dead body on the floor. Never again would he hear that gruff voice that made his stomach twist in delicious ways. Never again would he see that playful smirk that made Dean offer a smile of his own. Never again. Regret started to fill him. He'd wanted to tell him one more time that he loved him, wanted to kiss him one more time. Why didn't he? He will never get that chance again. Never.
Castiel rolled his eyes in annoyance. Sam had cornered him. This was his way of getting the truth out of him. “So what's wrong with him?”
“I'm not here to simply kill you, Castiel, angel of the Lord.” The voice was now mocking, as though he knew a great secret that the angel didn't know.
There was hope in his voice and Dean couldn't help but look him in the eye. Cas looked just as vulnerable and exposed as he did and he knew that he had to do this, for them both. “Yes.”
Before he could stop himself, before he could even question it, his eyes slipped shut and the darkness consumed him.
An hour later, Dean pulled into a motel car park and parked the car up. The rest of car ride had been Sam explaining what he knew about this new angel attack which turned out not to be much. Cas and Dean had stayed silent the entire trip and in the end Sam had given up trying to coax either one of them into a conversation. Dean was secretly glad. His head wasn't into the case and he needed it to be, desperately, he needed this hour to gather his control back. Sam jumped out the car muttering about getting them a room. Cas climbed out after and Dean followed.
Sam faced Castiel again with wide eyes. “What the hell is wrong with him?” Castiel ignored him as he took long strides across the room, feeling the pull of Dean. He would never be able to get away from it. He will never be able to be rid of this feeling, no matter what happens now, this will never disappear. He shoved past Sam and made his way towards Dean's room.
- SUPERNATURAL -
Dean felt a stab at his chest. A thought pushed forward, a thought that made him uncomfortable. He didn't want Cas to get past it. He wanted to take the sadness from his eyes by pushing him up against the Impala and kissing all their worries away. But like the chicken he is, he pushes the urge deep down, ignoring it as best he could.
“Before?” Dean pressed softly, his eyes wide and his breathing shallow. If Castiel was really tuned in, he'd probably hear the wild beat of Dean's heart.
Anger started to swim through his body as he narrowed his eyes. What the did he think this was? What the hell did he think he couldn't do? He placed his hands on the man's chest and for a brief moment, he felt calmed by the feel of the hunters heart beat against his hand. Then he shoved. He didn't use his angelic strength, the purpose wasn't to hurt the man, just to shock him. Dean's eyes widened as he stumbled back. Castiel didn't want him anywhere near him. He knew that as soon as he allowed any kind of contact, he would succumb to this need inside him and he couldn't do it.
Dean let out a chuckle. “I lied. We already had some. I just needed to get away from Sam and his judgement.”
Dean smiled shyly. “I know, Cas.”
“Stay.”
It looks from side to side, behind, trying to see if it is being watched. A few people pass the entrance to the alley, seeing a homeless man, but not seeing anything else and its glad. Nothing will be spotted. Nothing out of the ordinary.
Dean bulked back in shock. Had he really been that obvious? He was only trying to show Cas that he needed him, that he was worried for him. Dean didn't know what to say. Should he be honest with his brother? Then his thoughts drifted to the way Sam had treated him. Even if Dean was ready to be honest to the outside world about this, which he most certainly wasn't, Sam didn't deserve for him to be honest with him. Not yet anyway.
The girl moaned beneath him as he deepened the kiss. She was yet again pinned to the wall, her jeans around her thighs, legs wrapped around his waist. He watched her eyes close shut as he shoved his dripping cock into her wet slit. They both groaned from the pleasure.. He held their position for a moment, he nipped at her neck as she moaned again. Then he started to move. The feeling of her tight hole gripping his cock sent waves of pleasure through him. He nestled his forehead into the crook of her neck, his breaths coming fast and hard as he hit her sweet spot. He closed his eyes as the pleasure took hold of him, he started to move faster, unable to control his movements, needing his release.
“Really? Aren't you, like, scared of it?” He kept his voice soft and wary, unsure if he actually wanted the answer.
(See the end of the chapter for
But Sam gripped his arm, stopping him, panicking him. He glanced at his brothers worried eyes. Trying to plead with him to let this go, just this once. But his brother wasn't going to. He needed to know what was going on. Dean could see that as the anger surged forwards. His fist clenched. He needed to get him off him, needed to be anywhere but there. He pulled his arm back to swing, watching his brother's eyes widen with surprise.
He couldn't. He couldn't leave. He didn't want to. He took in a lungful of air and wiped his tears away. “You're right.” He watched as Dean's face fell slightly, but then he recovered quickly. It was just a flash, but he saw it and he knew Dean didn't really want him to leave. “I'm not happy just sitting here. It hurts to know that this is my fault and… I should have been able to stop him. I have this itch inside of me and it won't settle until I scratch it. I need to go after him and it hurts that I can't do that.”
“Why?” His voice is full of venom. If he didn't keep this anger alive he knew he would collapse in a heap on the floor, dying inside. He would never let that happen.
The pain on Cas's face immediately vanishes, replaced by understanding. Good. Dean really doesn't want to go into detail as to why it would hurt so much to lose him. He can't go there… ever. “Okay. We'll figure something else out, then.”
He opens his eyes to find Cas staring at him again, a worried frown on his face. Dean lets out a sigh, trying to push all his rolling emotions away, far enough away to allow him space to concentrate on Sammy. With a new determination, he stands, his knees almost buckle, but he manages to stay upright. Cas glances down at his legs, then back up to his face, his frown deepening.
There was no strength to give and it made the tears drip from his lashes. He couldn't offer the comfort Sam needed and he couldn't protect Cas when he was led
Slowly, he pulled himself to a sitting position, feeling his bones creak from the lack of movement. He rubbed a hand down his face and glanced at the angel again. He felt the grief consuming him, taking his breath away. How was he suppose to go on without him? He'd already done this once, already grieved for him, but this time was worse, this time he had him to lose.
This was what he needed to forget.
His voice broke again, and he hated himself for it. He backed away, slowly, the need to run pulsing through his legs, but somehow he managed to keep his pace slow and steady. Dean watched as a lone tear slid down Cas's cheek. He wanted nothing more than to go towards him, hold him and tell him everything was going to be okay. But nothing was going to be okay again. Plus, he didn't have that right any more. He didn't have that right to comfort him, to hold him.
This particular pattern is harder than the others, taking more energy than its suppose to take. It doesn't make it waver, or flinch. It continues to push at it, attacking it with an invisible force. It takes too long, longer than it would like. Castiel, the angel, will surely be figuring out a plan of attack. That wouldn't do. If it ever has a chance of destroying the angel and his friends, then now would be the time to enter this strange place.
Dean shook his head in protest, he didn't want his bed, he wanted Cas. But Cas heaved him off the floor, dragged him across the room and placed him gently under the covers. He turned to leave and Dean reached out to grip his wrist again, panic overpowering him.
He manages to concentrate better now, but Cas's words still manage to echo round his brain as the worry continues to eat away at him.
He liked women. Not men. He liked women, not his very male best friend.
He rolled Cas over onto his back to get a better look at his face. He looked so peaceful, so content… he looked asleep. It was very cliché of him to think that, but that's exactly what he looked like. He wasn't asleep, though. He was dead. Dead and gone. He didn't know how it happened, there wasn't a single mark on him. The thought had entered his mind, of course it had. What if it had been the emotions? What if he wasn't suppose to feel all this and it somehow killed him? He didn't think that was even possible, especially if Cas had loved him for as long Dean had loved him for. But the thought was still there, still at the back of his mind.
Cas felt his heart stop altogether. It's not like Dean hadn't said it before because he had. It was the fact that Dean was making sure he knew, that he understood just how much damage he'd done. It was enough to have Cas doubting his feelings, or that's what Dean thought. “I've never doubted that. Not once. I know you love me. That's never been in question.” Dean let out breath of relief and smiled, a very elated smile. “I love you, as well.”
This wasn't the first time he'd felt like this. It had been years. Every time he caught sight of those eyes, every time he saw that small, crooked smile, every time he felt that warm enticing touch. This wasn't a foreign feeling to Dean Winchester. Not where Castiel, angel of the lord, was concerned. But all be damned, he wasn't going to indulge in these feelings. Just like all those other times, he pushed the feeling down, somewhere deep. He couldn't feel this arousal, not towards him. Never towards him. This wasn't something he could act on. It wasn't that he was a man. It would never be because of that. This was his best friend. The only best friend he's ever had and he couldn't ruin that.
He knew it was impossible. A part of his brain tried yelling at him to stop, but all his hunters instincts kicked in. Anger surged forwards at the thought of Cas lying downstairs alone and dead. It was all this creatures fault. He manipulated Cas, told him of promises of paradise. He was what brought Cas to his death.
“Do you honestly think we can just go back to normal after this?” He was no longer trying to hold back his tears. He allowed all of his emotions to come to the surface, to be laid bare for the other man to see. Dean's mouth opened and closed, unsure of what to say, his own tears springing to his eyes but not falling. “I have given up everything for you, Dean. I have held back everything for you. This...” He waved vaguely at the table behind him. “This, I have been dreaming about for years. Only its not. Because in my dreams, Dean, you have loved me back.”
Dean shook himself back to the reality. Now was not the time to dwell on this. Cas needed him, needed his help. He shook his head and with both hands he unshackled Cas's wrists with the key Sam had thrown his way. Cas instantly dropped and Dean caught him, both of them falling to the floor. He heard Cas groan in pain, but Dean held him tighter. It was all going to be okay. Cas was alive, that's all that mattered. He was alive. He was here.
Life isn't a movie though. Things don't happen like that. But, God, he wanted to be selfish, just once he wanted to think of himself and have the one person he'd fallen in love with. He drank from the bottle again. The tears still coming. The pain still there. Yeah, he was a fuck up. No two ways about it.
Not breaking the eye contact, he gently pushed his fingers past the waistband of Cas's boxers that was now visible. He felt the curls of the man's pubes and froze. He closed his eyes, took in the feel of the hair beneath his finger tips, took in the feel of Cas's breath across his heated cheeks, took in the pounding of his heart and the feel of his own cock pressing firmly into his own jeans.
WARNING!!! Temporary Character Death!
Closing his eyes, he took in a deep breath, trying to will himself into calmness. He needed to be calm, needed to free his mind of all thoughts and fears, in order to break free of the creatures clutches. There was no way he was going to allow Cas, the love of his life, to feel anything close to what he had felt when he had thought the angel had died, barely an hour ago.
“I'm going to kiss you now,” Cas breathed. Dean only had time to nod once before he wrapped his lips over the other man's, his tongue darting instantly inside, tasting, swirling. Dean's mouth moved with his and they both groaned with the pleasure of it. There was no urgency, no hunger. It was just them, able to do this without worries, without the need to rush it. They could finally love each other, openly and honestly. This type of love, this type of kiss, didn't need to be rushed. It was slow. It was gentle. It made Castiel dizzy with need. It made him want more.
He searched three bars and no sign of Dean. On the fourth bar all urgency and concern had left him as his eyes caught sight of Dean. He had a girl pinned against the wall, kissing her deeply and hungrily. The pain shot through Castiel like an iron fist. He could feel his heart shattering into a million pieces. He knew Dean would never want him. He knew that even with Dean knowing about his feelings that this didn't change anything. But knowing it and seeing it were two very different things. This pain was different to all the others he'd felt since his revelation, this was a type of heart break that had him rooted to the spot, that had him want to scream and run and hide all at the same time. This was the type of heart break that made him want to punch something just to get that relief from the torture. This was the kind of heart break that he didn't know he could come back from.
Castiel looked from Sam to Dean. The ache that hadn't quite left his chest yet, flared up again when he saw the pleading look in Dean's eyes. He wanted him to go. Wanted him to stay as far away from him as possible. The agonising pain gripped his heart in a tight fist and he instantly forgot to breath. Dean hated him. Dean didn't want him here. He looked away from Dean, unable to keep the eye contact. Sam was still looking at him, waiting for an answer.
When he opened them again, Cas was focusing his blue eyes on him. Concern pouring out of him. Slowly Dean removed himself from the angel and took a step back. He couldn't look Cas in the eye as the embarrassment filled him. “I'm going for a shower,” he muttered and started walking away. He heard Cas calling him, but he ignored it, needing the space to gather his thoughts and trying get away from the humiliation he was feeling.
Cas released his grip and took a step back.  For a moment, Dean felt the loss of the contact, but when his eyes latched onto the smooth indifference on the angels face, that loss was all but forgotten as pure panic punched through his gut. “Cas?”
Then Cas was there, holding the broken hand. His own hand started to glow. Panic surged through Dean's system. No, he didn't want to be healed. He needed this pain. This was a reminder of just what he was. Of how pathetic he was, how much of a coward he was, of how hideous he was as a person, of how disgusting he was.
It searches. Always searching. It continues the motion of moving. But then it spots something. Someone. The man is sitting in some cardboard boxes, dirty clothes, dirty skin, dirty hair. This man looks sad. It doesn't understand that emotion properly, it knows about it, has heard about it, but has never seen or experienced it. It doesn't feel emotions like humans do. Its different somehow.
“I have things to attend to anyway.”
“Because of Jack. He knows you're alive and he's waiting for you. It's not fair for him to have to wait.”
“For what, Dean?” His gruff voice sent shivers down Dean's spine.
I'm not going into too much detail with following this story line, I'm also not going to dive into all the dialogue from the episodes. As I got further into writing it, probably halfway, it would be good to see what Dean's POV would be in these certain scenes. What was going through his head?
Dean chuckled quietly. “Okay. Before you take my dirty clothes out of here, let me finish what I was saying.”
Dean's eyes widened in surprise. Castiel was surprised as well. Not by the words, but by the venom that came with them. “What?”
The room is shrouded in darkness and Dean reaches for the light switch, hesitating for only second. Does he really want to see what's in here? He pushes that fear way down deep and flicks the switch. He has to blink against the sudden brightness a couple of times. When he is able to see properly, his blood runs cold and he drops his arm, forgetting about the smell.
Dean felt his heart pick up speed, felt the slickness of his sweaty palms. What understanding could Cas suddenly have come to? Would Dean actually agree to it? Cas obviously thought so if he's calling it an understanding. He watched cautiously as Cas turned to face him. Dean sucked in a sharp breath as the weight he was carrying was obvious in his blue eyes. Dean waited patiently for him to start talking. This was his show now.
He had expected Dean to push away, to look sad and wistful at the same time but he didn't. He smiled happily at him, pushing his fingers through Cas's dark hair still. “I know,” was all he said and Castiel allowed himself to indulge in the moment.
He needed Dean like he needed to breath. He needed to be close to him, needed to have him, hold him, kiss him, soothe him. That was the truth of it all. So what was he doing here? Why was he putting them both through this pain? It seemed suddenly unnecessary. He cursed himself for doing this. He knew, at the time, that his reasoning had seemed justifiable. But now…?
Disappointment ran through him. He didn't want that, he needed to know now. The grief was still too raw, too real. Before Dean could even blink, Cas was pushing past him. Panic replaced the disappointment. He couldn't let him go yet, he couldn't go back to the real world, not without knowing.
But that look. It had brought Dean to a heightened arousal, more so than anything he'd ever felt before, including with those filthy thoughts of his. He groaned to the silence of the bathroom. What the fuck is going on? This wasn't normal, nothing about this was normal.
He showered slowly, not wanting to return to that room, fearing that he'd still be there. But when he entered his room, towel slung around his hip, and he found the room empty, he found his heart droop with the amount of pain it now held. He hadn't feared that he'd still be there, he'd feared that he'd leave.
Cas let out a low scream as an angel blade scraped across his throat. It wasn't deep, just enough to shock him into submission. The demon above Dean let out a little chuckle at it, allowing the knife in her hand to drop a bit. Dean looked at his brother. A simple look passed between them, an understanding.
“Dean, its okay. I need to hear this. Tell me.” He tried to reassure him. He did need to hear this, but at the same time he was dreading what he would hear. Dreaded the pain that was sure to follow.
“Yes, but… its more than that. I don't think… I don't think I can survive without you. I think… I think if you kick me out now… I think I will really die.”
He widened his eyes in surprise. Reality came crashing around him. What the hell did he want? Could they really do this? Could they really be happy? Could he really be that selfish and bring Cas into his fucked up life?
Then he was gone, leaving Cas standing alone. Leaving him to feel this immense pain. He wanted to howl into the silence, wanted to rip his own heart out just to get a relief from what he was feeling. He wanted to be angry with Dean. He wanted to hate him for dismissing him like that. But he understood. Dean was terrified, terrified that Castiel would convince him other wise.
Dean had reached out and grabbed his hand, sending a shock of electricity shooting up his arm. He paused, glancing at their joined hands, wondering what this small gesture meant. Why was Dean stopping him from leaving? When his eyes gradually met those amazing green ones, he almost pulled back with wonder. They were filled with hope and confusion. “Stay.”
Castiel knew someone should break the silence and he desperately tried to think of something to say. “You should be resting.” He was quite pleased with himself at that statement. It stayed in the safe zone and it was the truth, he should be back in bed, sleeping if that was possible.
Dean wanted to punch things, break things, kill things. He couldn't, not yet, needing to keep his head straight. They had to find him and fast. Cas didn't know. He didn't know they had found another way.
Dean felt the sudden jolt of pain in his chest. Was Cas finishing this for good? Had he finally had enough of his drama? He felt Cas move in his arms, and he tried to hold on tighter, not ready for this to end yet, not ready to say goodbye. He didn't know how to, didn't know if he'd survive it. Of course, his efforts meant nothing to Cas, but to his relief he didn't step away, he just turned to face him. Slowly, and cautiously, he bent his head and caught Dean's lips. Instantly Dean melted at the feel of it, at the taste and he needed so much more. He opened his mouth to allow Cas's tongue access, but instead Cas pulled away. When Dean looked at him, his heart started to wilt at the sight. Cas had tears streaming down his face and Dean knew. He knew this was goodbye.
- SUPERNATURAL -
As the silence dragged on, he watched with painful wonder as Castiel's blue eyes met his green ones, holding nothing but sadness and disappointment. He desperately wanted to take that look away, wanted to reassure him that he would hold his promise, no matter what.
