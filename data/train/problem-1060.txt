Sherlock slid his arms back and around to grip John's wrists, fingers pressed delicately to his thrumming pulse point. "John..." he said softly, lingering panic streaking through his words, his eyes. "Are you alright?"
And John is struck by the dopey look on the other man’s face. Now’s the time, he thinks. There are a few more presents to go, but there’s never been a better time for his gift.
“I love you, Sherlock.”
The puppy has dark brown and curly fur with crystal blue eyes -- rather reminiscent of her new owner. She’s absolutely as sweet as can be, and John is already smitten. He can tell that Sherlock is, too.
Sarah notices.
“Because what? Because you got scared? That’s the point of being vulnerable, Sherlock. The brave part comes when you let me stay and you talk to me.”
“Yes.” Sherlock agreed. He’d already showered and gotten the lingering smell of seventy-two hour old corpse out of his skin. “Now please hurry up. I need to stop somewhere before we get Willa.”
The stairwell down to the flat looked almost the same as it had, except with a fresh coat of paint.
Gregory was on the sofa with his head tipped back to rest against the wall, looking utterly exhausted and seriously troubled. Despite his eyes being closed Mycroft could tell he was awake, monitoring both John and Sherlock by the noises they were or weren’t making. Mycroft’s long-rumored dead heart squeezed at this because long ago he’d vowed he would do everything within his considerable power to keep this man as happy as he could.
He pulled away after a moment and then came back with a warm wet flannel to clean them up with. John cleaned himself and then pushed Sherlock back over to his back. He was so gentle and tender as he cleaned Sherlock. It was a whole other level of intimate and Sherlock had to squeeze his eyes shut against the onslaught emotions.
This entire thing was very wrong.
Sherlock was about to say something when John crooked his finger and expertly found his prostate. Sherlock moaned, hips arching off the mattress. “That is, fuck, cheating.” He managed between gasps.
Jessica took the paper and seemed to ignore his irritable tone with her. “For how long, sir?” She asked.
Mycroft rolled his eyes towards the roof of the car. “Of course she has, she relies on that money.”
Once again I'm here to remind you that, more or less the previous story was a set up in order to get to this one. Did it leave you feeling all warm and fuzzy? Good but this isn't that.
. “Sherlock I’m paranoid, alright? You know I’m a worrier, this is me worrying. Let it go.”
Thursday Sherlock dragged John with him to as many of the houses as possible. There were a few items in common among each of them but the problem came when they tried to investigate Ernie Tash and June Olsen’s cupboards.
John didn’t text for the rest of the evening.
Once Janine had finished with the dye she and Cole had gone to the other room, Willa caught a glimpse of the gun Cole carried tucked into the back of his trousers. She sat by herself for forever, still perched on top of the toilet lid. When they began talking again, she cautiously got up, seemingly forgotten for the moment. She took her chance to inspect the room she’d been left in.
Mycroft’s face turned sour. “Brother dear, how is planning that weekend coming along?”
Sherlock’s eyebrows could not possibly raise any further without joining his hairline. “My brother, why?”
Molly tamped down on the urge to yell back, “so instead you’d rather them find out that you knew and allowed them to walk around with false hope for how long?”
“Molly, you’re not supposed to be in here,” he said as he zipped the bag shut again, obviously having figured out why she’d been taken off.
Slowly John nodded.
Sherlock and Willa had just finished arguing over whether broccoli was better or worse than brussels sprouts.
“Who exactly, Mycroft.” Sherlock said already irritated because his brother still wouldn’t just text like a normal person.
Shhh, in my head the tucking in of Willa scene was reminiscent of the scene from the 1982 Annie. Sue me I can't help the fluff sometimes.
gunshot wound with his lips next and covered it with kisses, like he could heal a six year-old wound.
Some nights, even long after all the other nightmares of war had faded, he was still able to hear her screams when he finally pulled the boy from her.
She stewed in her office a while after Dr. Golden appeared, profusely sorry and obviously as out of the loop as she was, right up until she heard someone mention that Lestrade was in the building. She set off to find him and tell him exactly what she thought about him issuing orders outside his purview.
to know. You were getting texts, obviously from a female, at all hours of the day and night that you were deleting.” Sherlock shouted at him. It was only after he’d said it that he realized that was the true reason he hadn’t confronted John. He’d never really been able to convince himself John wasn’t being unfaithful.
“Aunt Molly’s found out the baby is going to be a boy.” Willa explained absently.
“But you’re offering to take our child so we can have a romantic weekend.” Sherlock reiterated.
Willa put the brush back into the bottle as she finished Molly’s nails. “I’m going to have a baby cousin soon.”
Sherlock tilted his head, considering it for a moment. “She’s extremely intelligent.”
“Thank you. Goodnight, Sherlock.” John said.
“Oh… uh yes,” John said realizing Sherlock was behind him. “This is Sherlock Holmes. Sherlock this is Mr. West, Willa’s teacher.”
Sherlock did not disappoint. He ran his tongue precisely from the top to the bottom, stopping just short of John’s perineum. His tongue teasing passed over the ring of muscles and John’s hand twitched around the sheets in an effort not to shiver. Sherlock worked his tongue back to the muscle and gently circled it.
“He looks… healthy.” Sherlock said in an attempt to complement Molly on her new baby. John wondered if Sherlock had ever interacted with an infant so young before.
“Alright fine,” Greg sighed, realizing when he was trying to fight a losing battle. He instead handed the evidence bag to Sherlock who took it and after having put the hair into it, rolled it up and placed it in his pocket.
“Hmm?” John hummed into Sherlock’s collarbone, this earned him another hip roll.
John let out an exasperated sigh and to her left a tea cup slid out of Sherlock’s hands. He fumbled with it, spilling tea all over the rug, but he managed to keep the cup from shattering on the floor.
“Holy fuck.” John panted after a moment.
John understood and found he couldn’t judge too harshly.
Walking into the living room he spotted his phone on the desk. Willa was curled up in his chair watching some nature documentary on the telly.
Sherlock hated the feeling of not knowing, of not being able to tell John definitively that yes, this was to do with Willa.
Sherlock hadn’t admitted it to John, though he suspected he knew, but he enjoyed fixing Willa’s hair. There was something therapeutic about doing her hair for him and she enjoyed it too, nearly purring when he brushed it. Both she and John could brush it and make passable pony tails but it was only Sherlock and Mrs. Hudson who could tame it into anything resembling order.
There was nothing more he could do while at home so he shut the file and laid down with Willa.
As the holidays approached John felt the familiar itching return to his veins. If it wasn’t for Willa’s absolute joy over the season he wouldn’t have celebrated them at all. Too many things had happened during this season for him to enjoy them much.
John didn’t bother moving from his seat because Sherlock was already halfway up the stairs when he thought of it. He listened as two sets of feet traveled back down again. Looking up John smiled to see Greg following Sherlock into the room.
Stalk me:
Willa was next. Upon hearing Mycroft’s voice she jumped up from where she was playing and dove for him, wrapping her arms around his legs. “Uncle Mycroft!” She squealed. “Have you brought me a present?”
Sherlock growled, thumb beginning to travel along John’s rapidly hardening length. “Again.” He demanded.
Greg reached for it and raised his eyebrows at her.
Greg sat back down next to Mycroft and looked sheepish. “Deb’s new job means she can’t pick them up after school and David’s got practice so apparently some days Addy’s been going home on her own.”
So yes, John was most certainly keeping something from Sherlock.
He’d gotten a great deal of joy out of forcing Mycroft to do the legwork in bringing Baron to the flat.
“I’ll go there and call the station on the way and you…” Gregory paused, he was worried and throwing orders out like the Detective Chief Inspector he was. “You find her.” He finished before decisively crossing back over toward Mycroft.
Sherlock looked at the mess on the floor properly and realized it was the remains of a tea cup. Sherlock was about to reassure her when he noticed she still hadn’t brought her hands out from behind her back.
Sherlock shook his head again. “It’s contaminated now,” he reasoned, “there’s more in the sweater that’ll be of more use for forensics.”
Sherlock was a bit away speaking to an older man with a rather obvious case of scabies. John was all too happy to lurk in the background sipping as his coffee and observing. He made a mental note to send Sherlock’s coat off for fumigation as soon as they had the time. Meaning just as soon as they’d found their daughter.
By dessert Sherlock realized they were certainly on a date. He’d seen John Watson the lover in action years ago and recognized the treatment. It thrilled him immensely.
He didn’t really have anywhere to go but he later found himself outside of the New Scotland Yard building. Lestrade’s office was in the same place though he didn’t recognize many of the faces as he walked through the building, what’s more no one seemed to recognize him.
He gave up on the pretenses of working and climbed the stairs to see them. Willa’s arm was now covered in a baby blue cast.
Sherlock keened softly at the loss until John replaced his mouth with his hand.
“Aaron how much did he eat?” Molly asked, pulling out her phone no doubt to log the amount.
Sherlock’s back tensed in surprise for just a moment beneath John’s hands before he melted into the embrace. His own arms came up to wrap around John and he rested his forehead against his shoulder.
“Maybe if you went to bed every night like a normal person.” John teased and he couldn’t resist kissing him again.
“I was thinking we could go for a walk.” John said as Sherlock opened the refrigerator looking for something to eat.
The air during the assembly was oppressive even before Doctor Drescher had said a word. The teachers did their best to keep themselves composed but even Doctor Drescher’s eyes were rimmed red, obviously having cried over the news. Willa sat in John’s lap and held Sherlock’s hand in hers, she could read the tension in all of the adults.
Sherlock came with them despite being ostensibly apathetic about the baby.
sent us.”
“I’ve got work and Willa has school.” John rolled over to look at him.
The first search immediately yielded the leaked nude photographs. Sherlock scrolled by them, uninterested. It was unlikely she’d disappear out of shame after spending weeks enjoying the fame her scandal had leant her.
He wasn’t even sure what had made him turn and look at the building, after all they’d just spent nearly an hour inside and Sherlock hadn’t come up with much. Maybe that was what made him look back, he couldn’t stand watching Sherlock both literally and figuratively spinning in circles in some alley.
“John’s in a conference we can’t get him.” Sherlock explained. He was sure Mycroft knew that already too, but he was explaining mostly so he wouldn’t kick the back of the cabbie’s seat.
They eventually made it into the bathtub that night, together. It was a treat for both of them fit at the same time. They didn’t have sex but John pulled Sherlock back against him and they laid there talking until John began nodding off and the water cooled after the third warm up.
John clenched his fist several times, knowing full well Sherlock could see him. “Yes, I did.” He answered finally.
John cursed at the dead air for a moment then he ran for the stairs and up to Willa’s room. He found Greg’s number first. It rang three times.
“No,” John said and suddenly grabbed Sherlock’s arm and pulled him back a little. He wasn’t looking at Sherlock though; instead, he was facing the other direction looking back towards the building. “What is that?” He said before letting go of Sherlock’s arm and pointing up.
“Yes.” Mycroft agreed. He looked ready to dismiss Sherlock but then hesitated. “Might I make a suggestion?”
“Fine.” Sherlock interrupted with a grin. “Have whatever you like.” He looked meaningfully at both John and Harry, as if to say that directive was meant for them as well. Sherlock had clearly not been raised to understand the value of money.
When they got back home Willa marched up the stairs with the same glassy eyed look she’d worn the whole day. John watched her retreating figure disappear up the stairs and worried.
John nodded and leaned over to wipe the chocolate ice cream off her chin. “Yes. But would you like to really surprise him?”
As they disappeared a car came to idle beside him. Sherlock rolled his eyes though he doubted even his brother would see it and climbed in.
He looked tired, or rather downright exhausted as if he hadn’t slept properly in months (or years). His black hair was longer than John had ever seen it and the curls were squashed on one side and unruly on the other. The lack of product or styling was alarming but John realized Sherlock probably hadn’t had time for his grooming routine wherever he’d been. There wasn’t a lick of grey embedded in the ebony locks and John subconsciously ran a hand through his own hair, not missing how Sherlock’s eyes flickered up to it.
Sherlock shrugged, he’d already thought of that. “I am capable of meeting with people on my own.”
“Nothing else to do.”
Sherlock just felt insulted. “Oh do give me credit John, I am the world’s only consulting detective after all.”
“Alas the ruiner of all my fun.” John told him. “I know but it doesn’t mean I’m not going to look.”
Originally it had been vandalism and minor shoplifting but as she’d gotten older and found herself in the world of alcohol she’d found herself arrested for more and more things. But still, the most serious offense had been assaulting a police officer as he attempted to secure her a ride home one night after she’d gotten excessively drunk.
“Her.”
Though now that there was something that might have been news Mycroft found himself loath to wake his husband. He wasn’t honestly sure if the phone call was actually news, perhaps it had just been an empty update paired with a concussion that had set Harriet Watson off.
She’d been standing on the sidelines watching John and Sherlock’s relationship since the beginning of it. She’d always known Sherlock Holmes was dangerous but her little brother, who seemed to be able to overlook everyone’s faults but hers if course, was blind to it. He’d allowed Sherlock to take up his whole life over a decade ago and she’d known it wasn’t good then.
Both men blinked at her, Greg’s thumb hovering over the screen of his phone obviously not having expected that she would make that offer. Honestly, Molly hadn’t expected herself to say that either. But she realized she meant it.
There was a pub not far from the hotel and John figured it wouldn’t be so bad. A pint and a burger, hopefully some sort of game was on even if it was a replay. It would be nice to be around people since he hadn’t spoken to anyone really during the conference. All he could think of when he had down time was texting Sherlock or how long it was until he could go home.
At the doorway Mycroft paused, “I am doing my best, John.” His voice was uncharacteristically soft before disappearing down the stairs with his husband.
Now he was pouring Coco Pops into the bowl second because he knew Willa hated when her cereal got too soggy before she could eat it all.
Sherlock looked startled at that but then whatever was going on inside that brilliant brain of his caused the look to soften. “I love her too.”
“Really Sherlock.” John chided. “It’s just lunch.”
At five, after checking on Sherlock who was still sound asleep not even flinching when John brushed his fingers over his pulse in a peek of irrationality, John went back down and interrupted the baking party that was underway. Willa only complained a little but was easily mollified by the promise of helping with dinner.
“John, tread lightly you’ll contaminate the evidence.” Sherlock’s voice warned just as John stepped into the woman’s restroom.
Lestrade shrugged. “Do you think if I asked him he’d give me a straight answer?”
Sherlock brushed against him as he came into the room and went around John so he could sit at the foot of the bed. Harry suddenly couldn’t decide which one of them to watch so her eyes began flickering back and forth between them rapidly.
“Er, right I’ll just go into the bathroom then.” John agreed gathering up his clothing.
Thursday was the night Sherlock decided to start opening up about where he’d been for the last six years. John found he needed considerably more to drink after this night.
John shrugged. “I’ve got the day off and Willa’s at school. I thought I would do some Christmas shopping.”
John sighed. She had a point, when laid out like that it did all sound suggestive.
Stalk me:
“Don’t worry, I’m sure she’s just interrogating Willa about the adoption.” Sherlock said with a small smirk.
John rolled his eyes. “That’s what I mean. I didn’t know that. Every person who I’ve ever asked to watch her has said ‘oh I’d love to babysit’ or ‘call me if you need any help’ before I asked. You haven’t. In fact I don’t even know if you just tolerate her because of me.”
“You won’t be driving that until you’ve had lessons.” Greg warned him but David wasn’t listening.
“I’m going to undo your trousers now.” John warned.
“I want to hear you.” Sherlock answered softly, the breath from his words brushing against John’s arse.
Not that a sex weekend with John hadn’t been splendid but there was a sense of calm he felt with Willa in his arms and John standing next to him. It was something he hadn’t noticed before now.
"I already have," he said.
Someone was at the mic talking. Sherlock glanced at John and nodded his head toward the bar. “Just some water,” he said and then turned to John. “Let’s get drinks before we head back to the table.”
"She really did quit," Sherlock said.
Sherlock took a long drink of tea and then closed his eyes. He was remembering and praying that one day John would forgive him and things would feel good again.
Sherlock kept staring. “Look at me,” he said.
"I won't," John said. "Change my mind, I mean. See you tomorrow," he added.
“I loved you too,’ Sherlock said. He moved over toward the sofa and paused before he sat down. “I didn’t know it . . . I wasn’t expecting it. . . but being away from you made me understand.” He looked over but couldn’t quite meet John’s eyes. “Like I said in the messages . . . you made me happier than I’ve ever been."
He just liked having John around. That was unusual, yes, but it was painfully true. In truth, when John would talk getting a job, Sherlock had deliberately thrown out distractions to keep him from any attempts. But now it seemed that John had still been applying and now he’d probably get a job and would lose interest in working on cases. Worse yet, he was out on a date which meant he was losing interest in being at home with Sherlock as well. Sherlock no longer felt agitated or angry or even calm. He felt sad.
Looking around John decided to leave everything in his bag. "I'll get it as I need it, I think."
Sherlock got up and moved to his desk, checking his email. “Nothing,” he said aloud for no reason. He got up and grabbed a book from his shelf before moving to the sofa.
"Good night," he said. For one second he took a step towards Sherlock's room before remembering he couldn't sleep there anymore. He turned for the stairs and hurried up to his own room.
"Check the blog, maybe I can be your Watson today," she grinned.
John shrugged. He looked at her surprised face when she saw she could actually put the food on the table now. Then she sat down with him and waited. John sat down and pulled the food closer.
Sherlock watched John, focused on the laptop. Then he stood up and poured himself a cup of tea. “Thanks for dinner. I’m going into my room now,” he said before disappearing.
"If you insist," John smiled.
Sherlock came out of the bathroom drying his face. John went in, so Sherlock changed into his pajamas and sat down on the sofa and took out a book from his bag.
John blinked at him. "I don't -- I mean, not all the time," he said.
“Now, maybe, but I tried to say it last night, and you seem not to have completely grasped my point.”
"Let me know if you find anything," John said. "Or need anything. See you!" He moved around him.
“My grandmother died,” Sherlock said. He didn’t know why he hadn’t just walked away.
"Okay," John nodded.
John jumped when the phone buzzed in his hand. He didn't answer, just staring down at the phone. He'd messed up. He shouldn't have said anything.
“Are there cars in this story? I mean, is this in olden times or today?”
“He won’t,” Sherlock said. He opened his text messages and turned his phone to show John.
Suddenly the deer darted off. “That was cool,” Sherlock said, finishing his cigarette and then stubbing it out on a brick  in the path. “Here, sit down,” he said, getting up and grabbing the other chair.
John smiled. He checked himself in the mirror and then followed Sherlock out of his room.
Sherlock didn't fall asleep immediately, which was fine -- he quite liked listening to John's breathing, feeling his body inhale and exhale. But when John's alarm rang, Sherlock jolted open his eyes. He'd moved away from John slightly in the bed. He leaned over and squeezed John's arm. "John," he said. "It's time to get up."
“Sherlock....” John wants to offer him a sandwich, an apology, tea. Something to relieve the pressure inside his chest, something to make that sad little ghost on Sherlock’s face go away.
Sherlock puts away the pickle jar and looks back with another pensive face. “Yes.”
“Says Mr. Sherlock Holmes, the man who can tell everything about a person from a single glance, the man who makes the thought of privacy a thing of the past.”
“Sherlock, it’s not a kindness hiding your hurt from me!” John shouts, and it feels like he’s made some sort of admission, a pivotal confession though he’s not sure why he would ever want to hide these feelings. “I...I worry about you.”
“Because-- because--”
Suddenly all the tension drains out of his shoulders like an unspooling ball of thread. Sherlock drops back into his chair with trademark drama flaring up his curls and buries his face in his hands. They scrub across his cheeks and pull at his eyes, tangle the hairs of his eyebrows. “You’re exhausting.”
He’d gone over to check on him, to see that he was still breathing and whole and then continue on with this nonsense of a day. This was perhaps the, what? Second time he’d been at 221B without physical obligation since Mary died? And already he was slipping back into these routines, taking care of Sherlock without a question asked. Not like Sherlock would ever ask, anyway.
“I have scars.”
“That’s all I can give you, Sherlock!”
“Wait, Mycroft knows something about you before I do?” It was said half in jest, but only half.
"No, no, I left... I died, I know I did..."
John. There was the distinct smell of his companion in the room, a hospital room by his estimation, as well as Mary's perfume. Mary was here; John, too. Why was Mary here too? Visiting her husband? Was John here being treated? He'd been safe... When he'd died, John had no wounds. He was fine. ...Was he no longer? Had something happened?
“It sounds to me like you’re thinking too hard.”
He was cut off by the staticky voice of the man beside him. Several breaths were shoved between his words, like he just couldn't get enough air to make this all go away.
He carefully extracts himself from Sherlock’s lap and leaves Rosie in the capable hands of his best friend. The stairs pass under his feet two at a time as he flies toward the future.
Just then, John hears something moving around on the street outside. It sounds like jingle bells, but no one on this block was so cliche as to be playing Santa, and Sherlock had scared away carolers and the Salvation Army years ago. Who would be out so early on Christmas?
He sighs and leans back in his chair. “In a way, I am.”
"Yes, I'm fine; you'r--"
“Yeah, me either.”
But out of all the gifts he’s collected over the months, he forgot about the most important person: Sherlock.
He made another face, one that was more from annoyance than embarrassment or pain. “Mycroft said I’d stopped doing that.”
“Get married? Kiss? Declare your undying love? Have sex in an alley? Anything really. Just as long as you two finally removed your heads from your arses and got together, really. Which you still haven’t done, by the way! The pool’s ginormous now; you’ve no idea how much money some people are set to win by this. Ridiculous really.”
"I don't think not sharing sounds like something John would do," he said. "And why does a tiger give them meat? Wouldn’t the tiger have just eaten them?"
Sherlock knew they'd be gone for a few hours so although he had promised to tidy up, he first made himself another cup of tea and sat down on the sofa. It felt good for the flat to be so quiet. Harry's presence had not been good at all -- it had really thrown him off. At the moment, he just wanted to appreciate the silence and relief that now things would go back to normal.
“What have you done?” she asked. “You know you can be horrible -- have you been being horrible?”
She laughed as well. “Ah, there’s the old horrible Sherlock! I’ve not missed him. Get John back here so the nicer one returns.”
John nodded as he caught his breath. He pulled out and tossed the condom, lying next to Sherlock. "Fantastic."
John nodded.
"Okay. I just wanted to make sure," John said.
"Unless you're going to stand out in the hallway I don't know where you think you're going," he said. He stacked the papers and moved on to the scattered pens and pencils all over the desk. "All I am doing is tidying up the place because I am bored out of my mind. There is no need to shout at me."
"I don't want you to keep them to yourself," John said. "My reactions when others said it . . . I don't know. I think it was a knee jerk reaction, a worry that they were right and I would be embarrassed because you didn't feel the same." He stopped to slow himself down. "I'm sorry -- I know that's a stupid reason, but I didn't know and I didn't want to get hurt."
“But mostly true, though, I guess I got the future wrong.”
Sherlock thought again for a moment.
They moved the chopped wood into the shed. His father said, “Let’s take a walk.”
“We do run a consulting detective business,” Sherlock said, snuggling in. “And we figured it out eventually, so that’s another case solved, I suppose.”
“I don’t know,” Sherlock said because at the moment he couldn’t really remember. “I guess work, but we’ve just finished a case and have nothing new.”  He looked over at John. “How are we going to work on cases if we can’t leave the flat?”
Sherlock looked over at John and said, “Get us access. We’ll do it.”
Sherlock wondered if that was really true. He tried to imagine John in the flat. Was he in bed or in his chair? Suddenly, it seemed strange not to know precisely where John was.
"Oh. I was thinking of having an early night, actually. I have to go to the surgery tomorrow."
John laughed. "No, certainly not," he said.
“I don’t know,” Sherlock said. Because he really didn’t. He looked up. “It doesn’t matter,” he said. “I was just checking my email -- I’m sure I’ll have a client to keep me busy while John’s off doing what he’s doing. I’m sure everything will return to normal soon.”
John looked around and then looked at the grave. "What happened to him?"
"Good," Sherlock said. "Right . . . and how's your day going? Are you doing something with Mrs Hudson?"
Sherlock smiled when it changed colour and bubbled up to the top. “Excellent,” he said, grabbing some kitchen roll and cleaning up the spill. Then he jotted down a few notes, writing in John’s name as part of the result. “Thanks for your help,” he said.
“All right then,” Sherlock said. He shifted and lay back on the bed next to John. “My turn,” he said cheekily.
Work was busier than John expected it to be. The surgery was small but every day he came in it was packed. By the end of the week he was mentally exhausted -- he'd forgotten what it was like seeing patients like this. Molly had called and they met up for lunch on Saturday.
John moved and took Sherlock's pajamas off completely, licking his lips. He started stroking Sherlock slowly. "My mouth,” he murmured, close enough for just his warm breath to hit Sherlock’s cock.
Suddenly he heard another noise from the other side of the door. This time he recognised it. It was Mrs Hudson calling his name. He moved over and opened the door.
Sherlock sat quietly for a moment. "Do you think you should check on her?" he asked.
She smiled at them both.
Sherlock smiled back. He didn’t feel like that was possible, but he did trust John. “I’ll try.” He pulled his legs up onto the sofa, grabbing the blanket and covering his legs and turned his attention back to the documentary. When it finished, he asked, “Did you enjoy that?”
“It is nice here,” Sherlock agreed. He glanced over. “I’m glad we came. It feels . . . the same.”
Sherlock shook his head. “Just trying to figure out how much I’d need to use if I wanted to poison a flatmate who came home in a sour mood,” he said with a smile, handing John a cup. “What’s up?”
Ignoring all the warning signs that said 'go away,' Greg stepped behind Mycroft's chair. The back was low enough he was able to put his hands on his husband's shoulders and begin rubbing them in a futile effort to relieve him of some of the tension.
Harry had been filling someone in about Willa’s life since the very first time John had allowed her to come visit them. There was suddenly no more room for doubt in Mycroft’s mind as to Harriet Watson’s involvement. He was also very sure who the person she’d been texting was.
“Greg is letting everyone know about Janine and they’re sending someone over now to speak to Harry.” John said after regaining his composure.
John did a double take and stopped on the steps. “I’m sorry did you just suggest a telescope?”
“Give me the clip.” John repeated in the same low voice, turning his head to look at Sherlock. “I won’t have you running off to shoot someone without my permission.
He sat at her table and accepted the tea, and biscuits she insisted went with everything.
“Stop asking questions.” Janine snapped, her voice suddenly sharp.
“I don’t really like Christmas.” Sherlock felt that was a fair enough statement, Willa was old enough to know not everyone found the holidays as appealing as she did.
“You want to go out On New Year’s Eve,” Sherlock said slowly as he slid the game towards himself. “With me?”
Despite what Mycroft and Irene had thought, Sherlock was no virgin. Yes, he was inexperience and unsure when it came to actual proper relationships and how to navigate them but physically he wasn’t. He’d given in and had to test out all the hype in university and of course there were more than a few nights where he made questionable choices while high. Mostly he learned that if a person did not stimulate him mentally they had a much more difficult time doing so sexually.
When Sherlock saw him looking at it he grinned and pronounced. “Client’s chair.”
“Jesus we’re idiots.” John muttered. “Alright. Last three things. One: I will not magically become a doormat because we’re dating. I will still get pissed at you when you run off with my gun or when you buy Willa a kitten without asking me first.”
John hadn’t the foggiest idea of what Willa was up to but he watched her anyway. An hour later her gloves and hat were lying by his feet and she kneeled on the pavement in front of the steps. Her tongue was poking out of the corner of her mouth in concentration while she went about whatever it was she was doing. There was yellow stain on her cheek and a streak of green dye in her strawberry blond hair but John couldn’t bring himself to care about the mess.
Janine gave a half shrug before nodding toward the bathtub, “put them in there and then come out. I have water for you.”
She liked Aunt Harry.
I've been updating very frequently. I just wanted to let you all know this isn't normal for me but as long as the story is flowing I will do my best to get it out.
He’d manipulated Lestrade literally hundreds of times and never felt any guilt over it before. So it definitely wasn’t that. The only other option was the fact that he’d used Willa to do it. He hadn’t lied to Lestrade about Willa, Noah really was her classmate. While she didn’t actually know he’d been murdered yet, this would still affect her whenever she found out.
“Mmm, Sherlock what is it?” John asked groggily.
John just looked out at the cost of his daughter’s admission and didn’t say a word.
John’s reaction, the widening of his already blown pupils and the quickening of his pulse, was enough to make Sherlock shudder with anticipation.
As he hailed a cab John stuffed his hands in his pockets and rocked back on his heels. “So any ideas of what to do tonight?”
They stayed still, both of them panting from the effort of remaining motionless, until Sherlock leaned forward just slightly and planted his hands on John’s chest.
Sherlock opened the door. “You staying the night?” he asked.
"I don't think he tolerates you," she said, turning to the front again. "I mean, I think he does more than tolerate you."
John looked at the message and bit his lip. He looked around the flat, at Sherlock's empty chair.
Sherlock humphed but then looked over and, in a softer tone, asked, “If I hate it, will you talk to him? Use your doctor language to tell him I can come home?”
“Right,” Lestrade said. “He said you were a medical doctor -- mind if I ask you a couple questions about her?” he asked, nodding toward the body.
"So what do you want to try?" John asked, wondering for the first time if Sherlock had tried anything before.
“John –- that’s too much,” Sherlock said, squeezing his eyes shut. “I can’t look at you or it’ll be over.”
John yawned and stretched. "M'not making tea," he smiled. "I have to get ready."
“Oh no, I don’t think he’s leaving for a while,” she said.
“I’m teasing you,” she said. “John is always welcome here as long as his mother approves.”
He lay there for a few moments. Eventually, he did get up, but only to go to the bathroom, wash his face, put on his pajamas and then come back to bed. He knew he’d just be staring up at the ceiling in the silence all night.
“I’m just tired,” Sherlock said. Then he confessed, “It’s my back -- I got hurt.” He was glad the lights were off.
"Neither will I, John," Sherlock said. He curled close. "I'm sleepy - will you stay in here?"
"Do you have a job?" Sherlock asked. He glanced at John. "She said she wanted to talk about something else," he said as an explanation.
John looked up at the woman. "I suppose so," he said.
"You hardly know him. Not like I do. He might have been hurt before, but he's not now."
“I didn’t know if I should wake you,” Sherlock said, getting up from his desk. “That said, I’m ready to leave now.”
“No, Mycroft -- what if I need to call someone? What if it’s an emergency or what if I want to call you? If you take this phone, I will go out and buy another one. If I’m not a prisoner, stop treating me like one.”
Sherlock's phone vibrated, and he glanced down.
"I love Christmas," John said. "When I was five, Harry and I had been begging for a dog. On Christmas morning, there was a box with holes in it, like air holes. We were so excited we ignored every other gift for that box, but inside there were two stuffed animals. My dad was filming it all. Harry threw hers across the room and I cried." John smiled at the memory.
“We both did. Your stories put us both to sleep.”
"How nice of you," John said, going into the kitchen to make some tea.
“So you say,” Sherlock said. “But I know you like other things and now you’ll be able to do them.”
The young man looked up from his phone and said, “Sure.” He typed a few things and a printer began making noise. “Footage as well?” he asked.
"On the bed?" John asked.
“Sit down,” she said and Sherlock did. “I know being away from home is hard. Have you made any friends in the last year?”
Sherlock was surprised to see that John hadn’t been lying. He picked up a few boxes and walked to the door, holding it open for John. “Is this all of it?” he asked.
"Everything what?" John asked.
"Is it a cold case you're working on?"
"I mean are you sure we don't look like we just had sex," John explained.
He turned on the television and flipped through the channels. On one, a band was playing and he stopped, wondering if it had been the band tonight. Doubtful really, plus he didn’t really remember a single thing about the band -- what they looked or sounded like. He was too focused on watching for the woman’s boyfriend.
“I said I wanted to be around you all the time,” Sherlock said. “Or perhaps that’s something you hear from everyone, so you did not appreciate what it meant.”
Sherlock hit pause and then went back, waiting for John to point him out. “I think you’re right,” Sherlock said. “I wish we could zoom in more,” he said, fiddling with a few keys until giving up. “You’re definitely right, I’m sure you are,” he said confidently. “Excellent work.”
John took a sip of his drink. "Its funny we've ended up at the same table," he said.
He reached over and took the sandwich from John’s plate and threw it on the floor.
“Right, of course,” Sherlock said. “I’ll get to that. But it’s your lunch time -- surely you have earned a nice cup of tea with your work this morning?” He handed a mug to John.
Sherlock smiled. “I knew you were good for something,” he said. He ate another bite and then said, “Save room for ice cream.”
John settled again, his smile fading a bit but not disappearing. "Does my head hurt your bruising?"
Sherlock wasn’t sure if he should be worried about this or not. His first instinct was that he should be, but in truth, he wasn’t. Obviously he trusted John. Unusual, but certainly not the first unusual thought he’d had since he first met John.
"I know that. But John writes stories," she said.
“Where’s John?” Sherlock suddenly asked.
"You never stop surprising me, John Watson."
"I'm not going out again," John said. Then he glanced at Sherlock, slightly amused by how annoyed he was. "And it's actually quite comfortable, so I think I'll leave the coat on for a bit."
John reached over and grabbed his hand. "And she thinks we look happy," he said.
John grabbed the paper and came back up to the flat. The front page was the arrest of the drug dealer, so John sank into his chair to read it.
John smiled softly and sipped his tea as she did the dishes. He hadn't expected any kind of gift -- Sherlock barely remembered to eat half the time, he doubted Sherlock would have taken time to get a present for him. But that didn’t matter. Sherlock would be back soon enough and they would be back on their cases -- that's what John really wanted.
John tested the bath. After a moment, he flicked on the shower and watched it spray out of the head. "It all looks good."
“You’re not supposed to be having guests, Sherlock Holmes!” she shouted up at him. “Where’s John?”
“Oh, I don’t know -- I hardly ever play,” she lied. “You pick for me.”
Sherlock’s mouth moved all over John as he started to pump his finger. He liked John’s reactions -- his own cock ached for release. He slipped in another finger to open John up.
"I love this idea," he whispered. "Really."
“Your phone made a noise while you were outside,” his mother said.
“Did they still like you even when you were the captain?” Sherlock asked.
"I'm sorry. I’m just chatting with Sherlock," he said. He looked back down at his phone, still smiling.
After dinner, she asked them to do the washing up and for some reason Sherlock agreed. “I wash, you dry,” he said to John, throwing him a tea towel.
He thought about the wedding. He’d enjoyed talking to John, he’d made the whole night so much more enjoyable. He’d enjoyed dancing with him. And the rest of it as well. He probably shouldn’t be thinking about that now. He tried to concentrate on the talking part. He’d assumed that maybe there would be talking if John moved in. In fact, he was surprised to realise he’d actually been looking forward to that. He got up again and made some tea. He glanced up to John’s room. The door was still shut but he could hear him moving around. He poured two mugs and carried them upstairs, using his knee to knock on the door.
“Good morning,” Sherlock said, as John emerged from his bedroom. “You’ve got five hours.”
John relaxed when he saw Sherlock. "It’s nice," he said as he came inside.
"What?" he asked.
Sherlock shook his head. “Our school had a science team, and I participated in that.”
“You know, we’re different but . . . I don’t like a lot of people, but I like you.”
“All right, all right,” Sherlock said. “We don’t need to go into all that. I’m going, aren’t I?”
Sherlock didn’t say anything to either of them.
"I am," Sherlock said, moving a little closer. "I suppose I always knew the potential was there, but now . . . was this your ultimate goal?"
Sherlock pushed his leg back and kicked John’s arm. “Quit talking about it,” he said. He shifted in the bed to get more comfortable. After a few minutes, he said, “The school doesn’t have the same half terms. If I stay, I won’t be back until December.”
“I’m well aware of that, Sherlock. It’s a missing persons case – from before. We’ve finally narrowed down where we think he last was and got a hold of the footage. It might take a while, but you two could look over it.”
“I think it’s really good as well,” Sherlock said, taking a sip of his drink. “I mean, it’s not perfect . . . but overall, it’s really good.”
"God, your mouth is sinful," he moaned.
“What do you mean?” Sherlock asked and suddenly the penny dropped. “Oh, I see, very clever. But who’s the wizard?”
"I'm sorry, sir, but we can only share that information with family."
He grabbed his phone. It was Friday, which meant John had gone back to work this morning, and there was a good chance he wasn’t home right now. He’d probably gone out for a pint with Sarah and the other doctors or maybe he was out on a date – Sherlock had a vague memory of John complaining about having to cancel one the day Mycroft’s request had come through. Sherlock actually hoped John was out, so he’d be able to get up and drag himself back into the real world on his own schedule. He stretched and sat up. Then a crash came from the kitchen. His body tensed instinctively, but then he heard John curse. He was momentarily relieved it wasn’t an intruder before getting annoyed that he’d have company first thing after waking up.
"Friends, family, presents," John smiled. "There's a lot to celebrate."
Sherlock scooped the cigarette butts into his hand and took them into the bin. He carried his bag into the bedroom and then went into the bathroom to wash his face. In truth, he wasn’t even sure what book John was bringing, but he’d be glad to see him. Hopefully, it would feel a little more normal.
John wrinkled his nose and nodded. "Cheater," he teased.
“I came here to watch the band,” Sherlock lied.
"Are you?" Sherlock asked, looking over at her.
"No. They just fight together. Friends, probably."
"What?" John asked, looking over at him. "I don't want to find someone else to spend time with. I'm not trying to replace you." He stood up and paced a bit. "What do I need to listen to, Sherlock? I don't understand."
"I don’t know," John said. John thought about what his mother had once said about them but pushed it away quickly.
John nodded. "Yeah."
"I didn't say that. It's just . . . the blogger can't wear the Sherlock Holmes hat," John said.
"I think we'll be okay. They make those by guest numbers," he said.
"Well, I guess that doesn't surprise me," John said. He started browsing the refrigerator for something to eat.
"Umm, let me check the water first," John said, going into the kitchen with him.
"Why do you ask -- you want to quit while you're ahead?"
"Did you shoot the wall, then?" Harry asked.
“No, I’m not,” Sherlock said. “Why are you here?”
Sherlock got up and looked into the oven. The timer was nearly down to zero, so he looked in the oven and saw that the cheese was melted. "I think it's done early. Are you ready to eat?" he asked as he lifted the dish and set it on the table.
"I meant the mess of my day," Sherlock said, getting up. "Forget it -- I'll figure out something to do."
“I can’t remember . . . I remember the fall, but I know that right before I fell, I’d found something . . . but I can’t remember what.”
Sherlock took deep breaths as they walked upstairs. All of this seemed quite fast. He knew he’d been the one who’d started it and obviously it was all real and true -- none of this would have happened if it weren’t. But should John be going along with it? Everyone knew how backward Sherlock was with these things. Why was John going along with it?
John paused and turned back to Sherlock. He watched Sherlock shifting on the sofa and felt a pang of . . . something. Sherlock had been acting odd lately, and his outburst before was still nagging at John. He moved back to the sofa and sat with him. "Let's see what's on," he said, flipping through the channels.
"Yes," he said. "I'll make it." John took a sip of tea and got up, stretching again before going into the kitchen. "You like eggs and stuff, right?" he asked.
“Do it now,” Sherlock said. “So we know.”
Sherlock glanced over at his bookshelves. “My books don’t make very good stories,” he said. “Can you make one up?”
Sherlock walked over and sat down next to him. He ordered a whiskey and then sat, staring ahead at all the bottles. “Working tonight?” he asked with turning his head.
“It is not,” his mother said. “It’s too long -- you’re not in London now. We don’t take stupid chances here.” She handed him the coat and watched him put it on. “Very handsome.”
John hailed a cab and they headed home. He saw the lights on upstairs and, after leaving Mrs. Hudson and thanking her for sharing her winnings, he headed up quietly in case Sherlock was working.
“Don’t leave me again,” Sherlock said, his voice barely a whisper.
“It’s nice,” Sherlock said quietly. He looked over at the television as his hand continued to move. He let his fingers drift down the side of John’s neck, tickling the skin there.
“To be fucked,” Sherlock said.
“I’m afraid not,” Mycroft said. “Perhaps you lost it while you were out making foolish decisions.”
“Molly’s married now, Mrs Hudson,” he said. “That would be inappropriate.”
"I don't snap at you," John said. "And if I did, well, now's not really the time."
“About how clever I am.”
“Well . . . you didn’t make that clear,” Sherlock said. “Thus far that night, I’d thought, we’d each made very clear what we wanted.”
"So who’s behind it all?"
“Right,” she said. “And what trouble do you plan to get into in between those two things?”
"We could. But then we'll have to deal with him," he said.
Sherlock spent the next hour skimming through the video they’d gotten from the security firm before noticing that a segment was missing -- whether that was an error on young Lawrence’s part or a clue, he wasn’t sure. However, Sherlock was certain that the answer wasn’t going to appear on film. Whoever did this was more clever than that. It had to be an inside job, so he tried to find information on Charles Altamont, the owner, but he wasn’t coming up with anything. That didn’t seem right. He got up and dressed himself for an afternoon of investigation. He didn’t like not knowing, of course, and he still wasn’t quite sure who or what he was looking for, but he found himself heading down to the street with a smile on his face. He loved the process and had no doubt he’d find the solution soon.
Sherlock glanced over at his father whose look told him Sherlock’s answer had been the wrong one. “On second thought,” Sherlock said. “Maybe something small might be nice.”
Sherlock’s phone shook in his hand. Finally, he thought.
"Why have you hidden it so well?"
“Obviously,” Sherlock said. “The nurse did it.”
Sherlock smiled to himself. John always was kind. At first Sherlock had found it annoying, but it had grown on him a little.
“I do,” Sherlock said. “I missed being away from you . . . I hadn’t expected to.”
Sherlock watched as John let out a sigh that seemed to cause him to deflate. He turned back towards Sherlock. “What are you going to do now?”
It took significantly more coaxing than usual but John managed to convince Willa into staying with Mrs. Hudson so he could accompany Sherlock.
John considered the plan quietly for a moment, he still desperately wanted to rage against the idea of leaving Willa with Mary but there was no better way. “You will watch very closely tomorrow and if she does anything and I mean
Despite the fact that Doctor Trayford had at least fifteen centimeters on John he took a step back, perhaps now realizing he’d made a mistake. “I apologize Doctor Watson I was unaware.”
“Baron.” Willa announced.
He nodded and promised he would find her immediately.
John sensed him and began rubbing his finger tip in soft circles against the muscle. “Relax, Sherlock it’s just me.”
(See the end of the chapter for
He was getting better at ignoring it though which was why it didn’t work this time. “That’s not the point John.”
Sherlock went forward and very carefully hugged her. She buried her face in his jacket, still crying. He wasn’t as bothered by the thought of mucous on his Belstaff as he had once been, at least not from Willa. He stroked her head and pressed a kiss into it, mindful of the injuries.
Then there were the texts.
“Keep looking.” Was all Mycroft said.
Continuing what? Oh right, he was hyperventilating again.
“I promised him I would continue to look out for you and your family, that was his only request.” Mycroft explained, his tone almost soft.
They agreed to the idea after a bit more coaxing. John had reassured Molly that after a decent nap they would be able to tag team the whole sleep schedule.
“Fair point.” John agreed. “But you also have to tell me if you want to do something. Even if it’s not about Willa. I’m trying not to ask too much of you but I’m just guessing at what you’re ready for. So if you want something tell me.”
He went back to work three weeks after Willa was born, simply because he needed to get out of that house. There were moments, days even, when everything was nearly perfect. John could look at Mary and remember who he fell in love with. Most of the time though Mary would speak and it took every ounce of John’s willpower not to scream at her to shut up. There were evenings when he couldn’t take it any longer and he would bundle up Willa, wrestle her into that damn pram and then leave on a walk.
She looked up at John with a curious gaze, fork still trying to twirl up as much fettucine as possible.
Sherlock nodded. “You’ve got a headache.”
Sherlock climbed to his feet in a second, a manic grin plastered to his face. There was only one reason someone would be at their house at half past ten. A client.
“Why?” Sherlock asked, still confused. There was very little of note in Brixton, unless of course one was looking to buy marijuana.
As if on cue Sherlock called out to him and when John stuck his head in the living room to answer he could see Teddy squirming on Sherlock’s chest.
Suddenly there were a pair of hands pulling him around and he found himself with his face buried in Sherlock’s shirt. “I’m sorry. I’m sure you think I’m being stupid.” He apologized
He then turned and pointed at Sherlock accusingly. “You are the reason I have a hangover.”
“She’s alone, John. She wakes up
“After her birthday.” John promised.
“Willa there’s someone I would like you to meet.” John said decidedly.
There wasn’t enough room at the table, or even in the kitchen, for the nine of them so Sherlock stood in the living room eating. Molly joined him.
It had been over a year since someone else had touched him.
John heard Greg walk out of the room, but he didn’t care to find out where he was going.
“Releases heat.”
Mostly smut with a teeeeeny-tiny amount of plot.
As she was finishing up she heard Aunt Harry’s voice. “Sorry mate, you’ve got the wrong room. Bit too much to drink, eh?”
“I tried to warn you.” John chuckled and rolled off of Sherlock, making the whole thing infinitely easier.
“Yes. She’s doing well.” The head teacher told him but her voice was just off enough that he wasn’t put at ease.
They’d known she wasn’t coping with her classmate’s death well, she was too ‘alright’ for a child who had lost a friend. He should have seen it coming when her eyes glazed over and she was nearly mute during the funeral. Willa was a great many things but mute was not one of them.
Sure enough it was the layout of a blog with no posts made yet. Sherlock must have been working on the formatting all evening. It was a strangely tasteful mix of the color schemes from both of their blogs, the background is black with soft grey and green boxes. John noticed in the ‘about the author’ section Sherlock had put up separate pictures of them (John’s was his ID photo from work) and then simply put their names and links to their previous blogs.
He spent most of the day working through his stress by looking at different cat breeds online.
John turned in his seat to look at Willa in the back. She was still dressed in her school clothes and her backpack was resting on the seat next to her, they’d left straight after picking her up from school.
John had assumed that because everyone seemed to have purchased every toy under the sun for Christmas that Willa’s birthday would be a more sedate affair.
This got her to turn around in shock. “Why not?”
Willa nodded, eyes already heavy. “Good, he looked sad tonight.”
John instinctively followed as Sherlock pounded down the stairs. “What do you mean?” He called.
“Alright.” Greg said and held out a hand for whatever evidence Mycroft had.
John dropped his head into his hands. “Irene, just sit down and shut up.” He ordered and rose from his chair.
Sherlock’s heart clenched when he looked at the black screen, he knew what picture was just one button away from lighting up. Willa and Mrs. Hudson had recently emptied her camera’s memory card onto the computer and then proceeded to email John over two hundred photos. John had instantly set one of the three of them from Willa’s birthday as the background of his lock screen. He’d recently started saying that he needed a new picture of the three of them because that one was nearly six months old.
John hit the reply button.
John was surprisingly easy to spot, standing at military attention just outside the restaurant door. His face looked like it had been set in stone, jaw closed so tight Greg thought he could hear the bones crunching under the force.
Mycroft and Greg moved at the same time, reaching out to take the present from Mrs. Hudson. John would wonder later that night how much Greg knew about the situation. John had never really told him much but still he seemed to have most of the story.
“Endothermic?”
Once he saw Willa standing in front of the tree looking absolutely mesmerized by the supposed magic of it he understood John had been serious.
A tall, thin man unfolded himself behind Mycroft and John’s breath caught in his throat.
Ernie was the old man from the assisted living facility. Everything he had eaten in the week leading up to his death had been served to over forty other people as well. None of them had died, well of Thallium poisoning anyway.
Irene had always known, from the moment she met Sherlock Holmes and John Watson that they would come to this. Unfortunately for them it had taken them a decade to get that simple fact through their thick skulls.
“What?” John asked.
John didn’t have a good reason for that. After Willa’s first Christmas it had become a tradition. “I think even if I didn’t let him play Father Christmas he’d buy her just as many gifts. Better she not realize Uncle Mycroft would buy her a small country if she asked.”
Lestrade made another face. “Listen. I want you to as well but there’ll be some issues.”
Sherlock flashed him a wicked smirk. “I know I will.”
Now eight months later and he was finally free.
“Are you kicking us off this case?” Sherlock asked incredulously.
After a few moments both Molly and John relaxed enough to move away from the chair. Molly sat on the floor by Willa and John went over towards the loveseat.
Sherlock’s eyes snapped open. “Of course. I’m fine.”
~~~~~~
It took Willa a few tries to stand, her legs felt rubbery and every time she stood the room spun just a little. Once she could stand Janine led her across the room into a bathroom.
“Get the lube you bastard.” John told him, his fingertips twitching against Sherlock’s scalp. “I want to watch you prep yourself.”
She nodded. “What do you like on your birthday then?”
Lestrade was of course, still there, toiling away late into the night over the eight murders. “Alright and I care why?”
“Willa did you move my phone?” He asked striding across the room to retrieve it. Sure enough when he lifted it he could make out a series of small finger prints on the screen.
“There you are love.” The woman said and then she slid her hand away. “That wasn’t too much was it? Angie’ll kill us if we hurt her.”
“Hadeon Wolanski is dead.” Mycroft told him and handed over a photo of the man slumped on the floor in a cell somewhere. There was a blue cloth tied around his neck and to one of the bars overhead.
“This is the second time this week you’ve gone out after Willa’s gone to bed.” Sherlock informed him.
wrong.” John amended.
“You always were.” Sherlock teased his voice regaining composure. He stuffed his hands in his coat and looked up at the building for a second. “So you’re back on Baker Street?”
He stood rubbing John’s back for minutes until the door to the restaurant squeaked open. Lestrade pushed his way out of the door and he stopped short at the scene before him. Sherlock watched him over the top of John’s head, he was holding John’s mobile in his hand.
“What happened?” He asked and immediately she began crying, tears flowing freely down her cheeks.
“I get an email whenever a news site mentions you.” John said.
Sherlock was practically a live wire by the time they left for dinner Saturday night. Despite having walked in on John and Willa clearly discussing whatever it was he hadn’t been able to hear much. What he had heard only confirmed his suspicions that this secret was the real reason behind why they were going out to dinner tonight.
Willa didn’t move.
Mycroft spoke first once it was clear John was too uncomfortable to start the conversation. Finances then. John had always been uncomfortable talking about money to others.
Harry, unlike John, had never been able to fall asleep just anywhere. At least sober. Drunk she could, and often did, pass out where she stood waking up several hours later where she'd fallen. Sober, she was relegated to lying on her side looking out as the night passed by her window. The nurses and doctors didn't help either.
“But you opted to take a nap with Willa instead of solving it?” John asked surprised.
Most everything was too dull to even consider. Cheating spouses, thieving flatmates, and several missing pets. There had been a suspected murder for inheritance that had caught his attention for two days. It turned out that the middle aged son had become a terrible gambler and lost most of his money, in an effort to continue his habits he decided murdering his ailing mother was the best solution. His sister was rightfully suspicious of the whole thing and emailed Sherlock.
Sherlock decided to join them because it seemed infinitely more interesting than his cold cases.
“I know but I never know when it’s going to become urgent. Some of the most boring cases have turned spectacularly interesting.” Sherlock explained as he stripped down for bed.
Irene let out a laugh, it was fake and overly dramatic. “Oh Sherlock you misunderstand me, it isn’t Mummy Mary I’m interested in. The woman with the most power, right now? It isn’t her and it isn’t me.”
“She wanted you.” Sherlock explained with a shrug.
“Exactly, so are we going to bake your cupcakes to find out how that happens or do you want boring store bought cupcakes?” He asked her finally.
He found Sherlock on the sidewalk spinning in circles looking on the edge of a panic attack, just like the one John could feel building in his own chest. Every heart beat was painful and he wasn’t allowing himself to listen to the part of his brain that kept screaming out for his daughter. If he did, if he succumbed to that blind panic, he wouldn’t be useful anymore. They’d no doubt have to sedate him and he’d end up in an ambulance.
Sherlock was about to settle back down to sleep when a finger firmly poked his arm. He opened his eyes to find John looking at him.
But he kept his mouth shut all the way to St. Bart’s.
“And Mr. Durant happy meant Isabelle kept getting her father’s money.” John finished for him.
John smiled weakly at him. “I know you will. So go, go talk to your people. When you’re done come find me at home, alright?”
“Why don’t you go shower.” John suggested gently pushing at his legs again.
Sherlock heaved a loud sigh. “Then point me in the direction of who’s case it
Unacceptable.
“Why is daddy mad at me?” Willa asked over the breakfast she had ordered but hadn’t eaten.
“I’ll call you when I know something.” Mycroft said in a clipped tone before hanging up.
Mycroft nodded and quickly sent off a series of emails updating everyone who needed it that Willa’s hair would be much shorter than previously described. Only then did he sit down and finally begin eating.
Predictably the other three followed after him quickly.
She went to work with John the next morning. He and a nurse x-rayed her arm, he heaved out a sigh of relief when he saw there was no further damage done. She picked blue this time.
Then one Saturday morning John and Rosie were up and dressed unreasonably early. Sherlock hadn’t slept that night so he’d watched the proceedings with only partial interest from his spot curled up on the sofa until John tuned to him, hands on his hips, and raised an eyebrow.
They stood behind the chair and allowed everyone to take their pictures.
“Call Mycroft.” Sherlock instructed as soon as he answered, it was obvious he was running.
When he sensed John looking he smirked and reached up to push his head back down towards the mattress.
They spoke about their old cases alternating between the absurd and difficult things they’d done.
“Anything else?” Sherlock knew there was more.
John held up a book. “I found this for you at the shop earlier.” He told Willa, ignoring Sherlock’s glares.
She frowned as she climbed the steps, there were three voices coming from above. One John, one Sherlock and the other she didn’t recognize but it was another man. It was far too late for 221B to be entertaining visitors, even those of the client variety. She’d heard that since the introduction of the little princess into their detective agency that they were entertaining those guests down stairs. She wondered what John was possibly up to.
“Fire took out just the top floor of an abandoned building, said it was intentionally set with an accelerant. Did some questioning and some of the neighbors reported seeing lights up there the past few nights, except there’s no power running to the building and there was nothing up there.”
He could tell John was uncomfortable at the beginning. Any familiarity with high end dining he’d once trained into John had disappeared in the last six years. He managed to keep John’s attention with conversation and soon the other man relaxed, Sherlock assumed the wine played a big part as well.
He took his time, watching as everyone began to fall in place and get back to their jobs. To most of these people Sherlock Holmes and John Watson were legends they’d heard about since they were too young to even be on the force. Everyone was having difficulty knowing exactly how to handle a situation in which these men weren’t legends but instead distraught parents who’s coping mechanisms were always shit.
“Well then John. I only spent a hundred and twenty-five pounds on half a telescope for Willa.” Sherlock smirked and slid into the car.
John shook his head. “Nothing, just happy she’s got her cast off.”
John wasn’t the only parent who made the decision to take their child home straight from the assembly even though there was two school hours left.
to know how you taste.” Sherlock told him his voice deep and John shivered again.
~~~~~~
Sherlock hadn’t really known if John would allow the kitten to stay but he worked under the knowledge that John would do anything to keep his daughter happy.
“Better?” He asked and she nodded wrapping herself around him.
Sherlock made a noise. “You’re terrible at lying John.”
“This is Lestrade, who’s on right now?” He yelled as he reached the car.
“Really?” Mycroft wasn’t really as surprised as he sounded. He knew Reinette was a terribly clever girl and would no doubt try and leave as many clues behind as she could, it was the fact that the fire had truly been connected to her that had surprised him.
“Sherlock and I have talks, we’ve decided to be a bit more than friends.” John said after a moment, the explanation sounded weak even to himself.
Sherlock hugged tighter. “I’m so sorry.”
On Tuesday they’d moved to another room. This one had reception. He managed an entire hour before texting Sherlock. Sherlock didn’t seem to mind though and kept the conversation going, the only major gap between texts was when he went to pick Willa up. Willa then somehow ended up with the phone and spent an hour texting John, refusing to answer when he called.
Sherlock rolled his eyes but quickly slid the clip into John’s pocket from his own.
“Certainly not.”
Sherlock was once again surprised at John’s ability to predict him.
Sherlock stopped instantly, even with his own mind in raging turmoil he knew better than to push a distraught John Watson. That could very seriously end with himself in the hospital and that would only be if John was practicing self-control.
“Thank you.” He said and then disappeared leaving John to shake his head while chuckling to himself.
Three days later Mycroft appeared. One look at his face told John something had gone wrong.
Sherlock nodded. “Scotland Yard believes there’s foul play involved and it’s apparently interesting to my brother because he asked Lestrade to look into it.”
Janine, who’d been saying something to him, turned midsentence, “fine, go on. Just pour water in when you’re done, won’t flush otherwise.”
Willa set down her cup and eyed him cautiously. Homework always came right after snack and helping with dinner was a rare occurrence since she insisted she was able to do all the work herself. So naturally she was less than trusting of his motives.
John watched as Sherlock slowly turned from where he was inspecting Greer’s bookshelves. “You’ve only just returned.”
John opened his mouth to protest but Sherlock cut him off with a raised hand. “Have you thought to ask me what I feel should happen with
“And what have we chosen?” John asked. He was expecting Romeo and Juliet or even Hamlet, as Sherlock had that on the shelves (he suspected it was the Yorick bit) but he was not expecting what Sherlock held up in front of the laptop.
After a while of assuring herself they’d find her soon Janine came back in. “Let’s see your hair,” she said cheerfully.
Once he’d finished he couldn’t resist scooping her up into his arms and burying his face in her hair. He opened his eyes when he felt the bed shift, Sherlock was planning on leaving them to have their moment. John stopped him by reaching out and resting a hand on his knee. Sherlock froze.
She crawled into the space he had just vacated. “Good King Wenceslas.” She told him her tongue tripping over a few of the syllables.
“Are you her only teacher?” Sherlock pulled his head back to stare at him.
“Me? That’s your problem with this? You let me believe she was dead for a decade!” John shouted clenching his fists, Lestrade took one step towards them.
John watched him for a moment before nodding. “Yes. I once had dreams of four kids, a dog and a farm.”
They spent a majority of Saturday in the room, leaving for only a few hours to explore the grounds on John’s suggestion. A great deal of the time was spent in the suite, in bed, not just for sex, but also for lazing around and kissing each other languidly. A luxery they normally did not have between their jobs and the active six-year-old.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “I’m glad he did it.”
Irene smirked. “I’d heard someone managed to melt your brother down, I can now see why.” She winked at Gregory Lestrade and he colored but took a step back.
“Good. Now you should go home and rest since you’ve apparently been spending your nights haunting the streets.” John’s tone was playful, he really didn’t mind that Sherlock was spending his nights that way.
“Oh John, hello.” She said when she realized he was in the doorway.
“Preparations -- I don’t know . . . gift wrapping, peeling potatoes, doing something pleasant for once since it’s Christmas, please,” she said. She sat down on his bed. “Sure you don’t want to invite John?”
"Don't bother," Sherlock said. "You can see it whenever you'd like now." He got up and went to the kitchen, grabbing two glasses of water before returning. "Here," he said, crawling back into the bed before taking a long drink of water. It felt good going down his throat -- his body suddenly felt tired but so relaxed.
"What did you take? Were you doing one of your experiments?"
John tilted his head a bit, moaning softly. "Lucky me..." he said.
“Does it say something horrible about me?”
“Right,” Sherlock said. He brought the tea over and sat down. “So you going out tonight?”
Sherlock noticed the yawn and said, “Does that mean it’s story time?”
"I hope so," Sherlock said. "Here, pour this while I get the salad." He handed John the bottle and then brought the salad out. He sat down and then stood back up, lighting the candles. He passed John the salad bowl.
“Don’t worry -- I’ve already sorted all that for you,” Sherlock said. “Your jumpers will donated for medical research.” He laughed at himself a little.
“He’s not coming,” she said. “Please don’t smile or complain. I don’t precisely know why he’s not coming -- you know how he talks in circles, and I wasn’t in the mood to fight him. It’s all right.”
Sherlock made a little growl in his throat, moving from between John’s legs and dropping down on the bed beside him. He started to take off his trousers. “Can I take all of it off?” he asked. “Please . . . hurry.”
Sherlock set his mug down. His brain suddenly felt very awake. “You mean -- he never existed? A name not a man?” he asked.
“It’s probably wise,” Sherlock said, shifting John off him. He took another sip of whiskey then picked up his phone. “John, it’s just gone seven,” he looked over at John. “It’s only seven o’clock.”
"Nor did I," Sherlock said. "I suppose it's happened as it should." He snuggled down a little, starting to feel the cold. "But it's not a game to me -- I meant what I said."
"Even if I get it I won't be incapacitated," John said, hoping it wasn’t a lie. "But yes, you can always call Sarah if you need anything."
John shook his head. “A detective? That sounds interesting."
John turned with the heated food and sat at the table with Sherlock. "Thanks."
“Your best friend?”
"Well, get your shovel then," he said.
John glanced over and blinked. "You," he said, only looking away when the bartender brought his drink. "I'm not, no. Are you?”
“Right,” Sherlock said, pretending he was making a list in the air. “Hair colour, eye colour . . . or are you going to claim those don’t matter?”
"Let's go out," John said.
"Oh. You never texted for a case," John teased.
“Alright, love. I-- I won’t put you in a position like that. I-- I honestly can’t even imagine doing anything like that again; I can’t imagine having done it in the first place… God, I’m such a fucking monster…” John drops the tube of ointment he’d been about to rub on Sherlock’s shoulders and weakly hides his face in his hands. He has to stop running, needs to, but the pain is overwhelming.
As always, without fail, John had come to him.
After every piece of absolute shit they’d been through, after all John had put him through, he had to give him something wonderful, something that would express just how much John valued him, respected him, was irreversibly smitten with him.
“That’s-- not what I expected, but...I’m glad you like it.”
“Please,” they say at the same time. Sherlock continues, barely even acknowledging they had spoken together. “We’ll still be friends, if that’s what you’re worried about. I find it very hard to let you go, even for a few hours.”
The detective gets upset then, his face clouding over with thunderstorms. “That is exactly why I have not told you. I can’t live in this place having you blame yourself for things you had no control over, things you didn’t even know were happening! I cannot allow your guilt and especially not your pity! They are incredibly useless to me and I have put you through enough to allow you this kindness.”
“...Good morning, Sherlock.”
John splutters and makes to deny it, but Sarah just laughs at his flabbergasted face.
“Can I...Can I kiss you?” He doesn’t lean towards his lips, carefully leaning back from his skin but still letting his fingers ghost soothingly over Sherlock’s hips.
Part of Sherlock was touched that John (a living, breathing John at that, a real one) was so affected by his death, but a larger part only felt concern. Feeling grief so intensely surely was no good for his health...
Morosely and hesitant, Sherlock nodded his head. Forgive his lies.
"And you're kinda right, you infuriating twat," John said with a grim, almost angered melancholy.
“Mostly at Molly’s flat.”
“I’m sorry, John, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to upset you! I can-- I can put this stuff back where I found it! I can even sew the lace back onto the wedding dress if you’d like--”
“I could say the same about someone else in this room.”
He shifts uncomfortably and tries again to tug open the pickle jar. John holds out his arm, palm up, in an soft offer of help. Sherlock acquiesces with a silent shrug and crosses his arms.
Tears soften John’s focus on the gift in front of him and the box in his lap. Sherlock really has outdone himself. It’s a shadowbox, one crafted out of thick cherry wood and polished glass. Inside is a picture of Mary and him (and Sherlock) on their wedding day, smiling widely at one another. There are pressed flowers from her bouquet, a strip of lace from her wedding gown, a necklace she wore. These are the pieces of their life together, the happy, bright cameos that only ache with remembrance and not with betrayal.
Finally all that’s left are the gifts for Sherlock and John, from each other. Sherlock looks a little surprised that there’s anything for him under the tree, let alone that it’s from John. The blonde man feels a twinge in his chest at the thought that Sherlock feels so unloved as to not even expect a gift on Christmas Day from his best friend of seven years.
“It’s still going on?! For how long? Who’s part of it?!”
“Do they still…”
"They brought you back here, and I texted Mary that I wouldn't be coming home. You haven't woken up since that awful woman's flat."
John starts slowly making the sandwiches, careful to layer Sherlock’s in the precise strata that always pleased him. Bread, five slices of lunch meat ham, three pickles, two more slices of ham, spurt of mustard, bread. He puts it on one of their less-than-nice plates, adds a full pickle and some crisps, and goes over to the table where he is now sat, reading an online article about the effect of gallium dust on gold necklaces. The detective is wearing glasses on the very edge of his nose and a tiny bit of gray shines on the sides of his ears, only visible in this direct light under the lamp.
“I can’t...I can’t trust that, Sarah, as much as I want to. And even if that is true, I’ve hurt him so many times, who’s to say I won’t hurt him again? Won’t accidentally leave him behind and lose him forever? I don’t want to be responsible for ruining him.”
What kind of gift can do that?
The words had a strange effect one John. Rather than wither into himself like some would, John did the opposite. The cerise-painted man saw John's face turn stoic and unwaveringly determined. He pushed his shoulders back, sat straight, and cleared his face of distress and replaced it with a rough blankness.
“Why have I been making those noises?” And here is where Sherlock swallows and his eyes burn with something fiercer and angrier than his previous painful kindness. “Take a guess,” he says. “You’re smart enough to be able to figure it out. It’s not from my torture scars, which are long-since healed, if a bit agitated and poorly formed. I’ve done little in the way of physical activity in these recent weeks -- I’ve been too busy getting high and wallowing in nightmares to do anything so strenuous as that. Tell me, John, what hurt me?”
The mention of Mary brings Sherlock back to himself, and he pushes himself away from John with as much force as his addled body can muster. Oh, he's really done it this time. Now that John can see he's alright and will eventually recover, he'll go home to his doting, pregnant wife and never speak to him again.
“Do you know what you’ll get him?”
"Shh," he cooed, desperate fright and pain still marring his speech. "I'm sorry for yelling. You just need to calm down, Sherlock. You just need to survive for me."
"Sherlock- chimm." John's voice, interestingly, had choked and stopped.
“Psshh. That’s easy. You’ve got something right here.” She looks pointedly at John’s body.
“It’s okay, you know,” John says as he kneels to look in the sink cabinets. Sherlock looks up at him, cradling his ribs openly, and can’t understand what John meant. “To blame me,” explains John. He stands up and brushes off the knees of his trousers before bending back down at the waist and pulling out a dusty old First Aid kit that apparently hasn’t been used since John was living at 221B. John gives Sherlock a glaring, scolding look and the other man looks appropriately sheepish under his doctor’s gaze.
“Another time,” John murmurs softly, dazedly, like his mind isn’t anywhere close to his body.
This distraughtedness was all because John cared for Sherlock, he realized.
“You and me both,” Sherlock scoffs, then sighs. “If you really want I can...help level the playing field. Tell you some things.”
John stands, his shoulders lighter than they have been in months. “Thank you, Sarah.”
Something about Sherlock’s politeness throws John off even further -- he’s glad that the other man’s being so pleasant, but.... It makes him yearn for past times, when his friend was utterly unapologetic towards him. With all that was in between them, could Sherlock ever forgive himself? Or even just...allow himself to be as open with John as he was before?
A bouquet of yellow roses on Mary’s grave.
"I don't love her, you twat! I love our adventures, our fights, our quiet moments. I love getting takeout with you, sitting at home, staying up till the wee hours to stop a murderer from massacring a Tesco's , watching you whiz your way through crime scenes. Your beautiful black curls, the way your shirts pull so tightly over your chest, your amazing eyes and cheekbones, and, God, more than anything I love your brain and your heart and your insane capacity to love.
John shook his head a little, the fog of past traumas clearing from his eyes. "Right, your heart was stopped, but the medics kept on working. They wouldn't let me near their instruments or AED or anything, wouldn't let me try to save you. Sherlock, you were dead for about a minute and a half. Before they brought you back."
"Please, Sherlock, don't -- speak. You have to keep the energy inside you."
"I didn't have a pulse," Sherlock murmured into John's belly.
John bends down and picks up the squiggling gift.
John picks up Rosie and places her on the ground beside their Christmas tree. Sherlock peddles by the door and bounces from foot to foot. His discomfort is momentary, as John comes over and takes the gifts from his arms with an enchanted smile, dusting the snow from his flatmate’s curls and pressing his hand to the genius’s cool cheek.
He can only behold it with awe. “Sherlock…” he murmurs.
The other man closes his mouth in that way he does when someone has pointed out something he doesn’t like, like he’s trying to swallow away his lips in the most rectangular way possible. He glances at John furtively, and John meets his gaze head on, though it frightens him to do so.
John stirred from his flurry around the flat and glared, "Of course it has, you twat!"
"Her or her breed?"
“I can’t believe you’re so thoughtful, you daft man!”
He’s grateful to be back in 221B. The flat he shared with Mary is haunted with hollow silence and bittersweet memories. Any time he spends there is too melancholic to truly be healthy, yet coming back to 221B has been more of a challenge than he ever thought it could be. He doesn’t want to forget Mary and act like she was never there or changed things or lived, and returning to his old flat with his old friend and essentially to his life before Mary -- with the welcome addition of Rosie -- feels like he’s betraying her in some way, even if she likely would have encouraged it. Not to mention, whatever he’s been feeling around Sherlock -- this weird, unfailing pitted sensation that flusters him everytime he sees the detective -- can’t be in any way appropriate of a man in mourning.
“I’m glad.”
And here he was, with a bullet snug in his gut and the (--married, actually...well, he was going to die anyways, so at least it wouldn't be a long affair.) man he loved on the verge of self-destruction. A question wafted through the air, and it was one he was afraid to answer. But he could never deny his blogger. Except when it came to little things like getting milk. (Obviously.)
"Why, Sherlock?" he ground out, fists clenching. "Will it help save you?"
“Us finally pulling our heads from arses and getting together.”
"I'm confused, I- I don't understand, I..."
He already has presents for almost everyone: a delightful china teapot with rose etchings and a set of “subtle” cannabis-shaped earrings for Mrs Hudson, a football biography for Greg, a gag bow and arrow for Mike (strange request, but John has noticed a distinct increase of red hearts in the man’s home…), wayy too many toys for Rosie.
“You don’t need to thank me for my saying that you’re my best friend. You’ve earned that honesty and far more than that.”
“You sound like you’re quoting someone.”
“Christ, Sherlock, what I did to you was inexcusable!” he shouts and stands from his seat with an explosive scrape of his chair. He starts pacing, wanting to tear out large chunks from his hair and set them on fire in his stomach, choking to death on his own burning body. “I could have-- should have-- stopped after that first punch. You were down and you weren’t going to hurt anyone, but I kept going. I didn’t want to stop. A bloody serial killer thought I’d done enough to you before I did, and I’m your best friend.”
Sherlock stops here to look at John over the rim of his teacup, and John can only blink. “You mean…?”
And now here he was, on Christmas Eve with no gift for the second most important person in his life!
Sherlock looks at him calculatingly, obviously trying to decide just how honest and revealing to be. He takes a shallow sip of his cooled tea and purses his lips before responding, “It was during my two years away. The scene at St. Bart’s had to be carefully orchestrated, if I were to emerge alive. The enacted plan was the same as the original, in most parts. You and the others were to think I had died so that I could go about my business without interruption. Again, I had no idea it would affect you so, my absence. But Moriarty threw in something at the last minute, something I had not anticipated.
Hideous tears ached onto his face. Still swept up with his agony, Sherlock rocked a little to himself and pressed the heels of his hands to his temples, whimpering and shaking with quiet sobs. "John, John, oohhh, ohohohohh, I' so sorry, so sorry. John. John...Please forgive me..."
“It is almost negative seven degrees outside.”
“Quite possibly forever. We’ll have to see.”
He smiles, a small thing, and tosses his hair away from the corners of his glasses. “Of course I do.”
“Love, you have to. If it comes to that, you have to.”
Sherlock rolls his eyes in return but, remarkably, makes no protest. He rises from his seat with another little grunt, one that’s just too forceful to be only from heaving himself from the chair, but John doesn’t say anything about it and neither does Sherlock.
“That is a gross over-exaggeration of my skills and you know it.”
”I’d do anything for you.”
And John tries to hold it back, but after this incredibly torrential night he can’t stop the blindingly bright way his face smiles. He’s fucking beaming, so glad that Sherlock has finally, finally let him in, to stay. Maybe John had already been in Sherlock’s heart in some capacity, but whatever position he’d been in had caused the other man so much pain -- and now, John could rest comfortably, knowing that Sherlock knew he would never again do anything to hurt him. Not even if it meant losing his life. Sherlock had done everything humanly possible to protect Sherlock, and now it was John’s turn.
Within the recesses of his mind, he knew that John wasn't dead. But the sheer possibility of it was apparently enough here, in the afterlife (or on drugs -- perhaps he really was having an overdose and was having oversensitive reactions to his surroundings and emotions?).
And he’s nervous for about a second before he replies, “I love you, too, John.”
“Had to make sure it hadn’t changed.”
Despite it all, she looks happy.
But you do. I would do anything for you if you just said the word, John realizes, and the realization knocks the wind out of him.
He bends down and kisses her cheek, and then begins collecting his coat. His races to the doorway, and just as he leans out into the bright hallway, one step in the future, Sarah asks, “Oh, and John?”
The detective looks up from the laptop to see John’s intrigued little smirk. Sherlock squirms a little, obviously a little embarrassed by the glasses but he’s not so proud or vain to try to hide them now that John has seen them. He pushes them farther up his nose and clears his throat lightly. “Thank you, John.”
The pain was digging its nails into every centimeter of his transport, so tolling that emotions were flooding his thoughts and shutting him down. Now he would speak. Now he would leave his love with John and die.
“John? Are you alright?”
John grins -- he can taste the smile on Sherlock’s lips. He’s never had anything more delicious.
John is taken back to Buckingham Palace and a beautiful marble man wearing a white sheet, the fabric slipping down his sculpted shoulder blades and stopping just short of what was sure to be a rounded bottom… The skin had been smooth then, smooth and unblemished except for a delightful smattering of pale freckles and stretch marks and a mole or two.
"But you've got...You've a normal life with her... Or, well, I suppose, a more normal life than the one you could have with me..."
"I was thirsty," Sherlock said. "I'm not a cheater." He kicked off his shoes. "There." He scooped up the cards. "I'll deal," he said, shuffling the cards a few times and then dealt out the cards. He looked at his. All hearts. He kept his face straight.
“All right,” Sherlock said. He flipped to a cartoon network. “How about this?”
Monday morning John went over his schedule again and penciled in a quick note about stopping at Baker Street, making sure he had the invoice. He gathered up his things and headed out to start the day, his most complicated job at the beginning.
Sherlock handed John the photos. “Those were good days,” he mumbled.
“Yes, it is,” Greg said.  “It’s quite a big drugs case.”
John squeezed Sherlock's hand lightly. "Good night, Sherlock."
"She says she's out, she wants to come by tonight," he said. "She didn't mention that when I last visited."
"Perhaps I can get your next drink and you can show me a thing or two," John offered.
John blinked at him and then looked away. "Uh, right," he said. "That's a bit blunt. But yeah, I'll sort it."
"Don't be stupid," John said, his voice quiet and, to his surprise, a bit shy for real. He put the cigarette away and stood up to take the coat off now.
John tapped his fingers against his thigh as they made their way home. He didn't know what to expect. He was nervous for the first time in a long time, but in a good, excited way.
"They round in the morning, Sherlock. You'll have to wait until then."
“All right, be quiet, I need to pay attention to critique,” Sherlock said as he settled in. He wasn’t sure whether or not John was just saying that, but he was pretty sure any science in a film like this was bound to be wrong.
“It’s a case, John -- we need to go now,” Sherlock said as if it were the most obvious thought in the world.
“Probably . . . touching,” Sherlock said, letting his hand rest on John’s thigh.
“Coronavirus? Like SARS?” Sherlock asked. “Covid-19? It’s new? Why didn’t you mention this?”
John knelt down and put the box in the ground carefully. "Does that look good?"
“What?” Sherlock said, instinctively reaching for his pocket. He was surprised to find he’d left it upstairs. “It could be a client,” he muttered as he went up to get it.
"What? You think about playing games when you masturbate?" Sherlock asked. "I don't believe you."
John looked at his hand and then his face again. "Sorry, I'm still working," he said.
John blinked and took the bag from him. He smiled slowly and looked up at him. "Thanks," he said. “This’ll be enough.”
"Because they never go anywhere!" John sighed.
"You can go back to work."
“You should go to bed -- you worked two jobs today, right?” Sherlock asked. He turned off the television. “You’re obviously tired.”
“Maybe you should reconsider,” he mumbled and then grabbed the bag of popcorn and turned to focus on the film.
“No,” Sherlock said. “But answer the question. I presume all of this was a wild goose chase, but I have no idea for what purpose.”
“Are you ready to go to sleep?” Sherlock asked.
Sherlock typed the words and then stared at them. In a way, it was a lie -- he knew he had changed. Some changes were due to John obviously; living with someone changes the way one lives their life. It was practical. However, there were other changes as well. He hit delete and instead wrote:
“You had an accident,” Mycroft said. “Your fault, obviously, but quite serious. You fell -- through a floor. Very careless.”
"Good," Sherlock said. He curled into a ball. "It's much warmer in here, you have to admit that."
"Tea," Sherlock said, handing him a cup. "Don't get too accustomed to me serving you in the morning, by the way."
Sherlock realised what John was doing. He took a deep breath and tried to go into his mind. Suddenly, he could see something. “The place was empty -- no one was there,” Sherlock said. “You were right, the business was a front. I wandered around, just in case they’d left something behind.”
“Good,” Sherlock said with a laugh. “Though it wouldn’t have surprised me if she had.”
In the morning, Mrs Holmes knocked at Sherlock’s bedroom door.
“No specific plans,” Sherlock said, equally casually. “I just wanted to be sure.” He quickly opened a message and typed,
"I don't mind," John said, flipping through the channels.
John nodded, biting at his skin. He started stroking himself between them.
"You say something you've never done and if I have, I drink. Then we take turns."
"I'm not going to forget this," John smiled. "Ever."
“I think your ride’s here,” the man said. “The black cab out front.”
"We are. I think we'll have our usual," Sherlock said as he glanced at John who nodded. "And can we get a candle for the table?" he added.
“Yes, well, I’m glad we’re clear on the goal here,” Mycroft said. “I suggest you get some sleep and avoid stress until your head is clearer.”
"That sounds complicated," he smiled. "You must be very clever."
“They’re not suicides,” Sherlock said. “They’re being poisoned.”
“There’s a reception line,” she said. “To congratulate the couple.”
“They wouldn’t be adventures without you,” Sherlock said. He laced their fingers together and squeezed John’s hand.
“I will like everything with you,” Sherlock said.
He gave her a look. “I am a human, you know?” he said. “I just had your friend over for a visit. What’s not fun about that?”
“Oh, right,” Sherlock said. He rolled over to face the wall. “I’m not saying you have to get another one. I’m just saying it’s okay if you do.”
Sherlock smiled. “No, we’re not fighting.” He turned to John and held the phone in the air. “Can you assure him we’re not fighting?”
Sherlock disappeared into his room. He stripped himself of his clothes and lay down on the bed, but didn’t get out a book. He closed his eyes and tried not to think about the case or about drugs or about John’s special assignment.
“Listen,” Sherlock said to Lestrade. “We are interested in the case -- can we come in tomorrow for the details? We’re . . . busy right now.”
“I have some news about John,” Sherlock said. “Did you know he’s got some kind of date with this woman tonight?”
“That’s all I ask, John,” Sherlock said, giving him a smile. He took his plate into the sitting room and turned on the television, flipping through the channels. Every channel seemed to be talking about the virus. He turned it off. “Has everything stopped being normal?” he asked.
"Well, I played a lot of rugby. It was my main extra curricular," he said. "I didn't like much else. I didn't make many friends who weren't on the team," he admitted.
She took a sip of tea and let him sit with that for a moment. Finally, she said, "Perhaps he just misses you -- sometimes people get confused about their feelings."
“Four hundred pounds can buy us a lot of fun,” Mrs Hudson said.
John turned his head slightly. "Did you take it to the police? It’s evidence."
“Yes,” she said. “What do you think of this piece?” she added, turning to the painting.
John shrugged and hid his smile in a big bite of food.
"Well, yeah, but it's . . ." she said. "Whatever. Just let me say my piece."
“I’ve not seen Greg here at all,” she said.
"I'm back," John repeated.
"That's fine. I'll see you tomorrow," John said.
"Is it Mycroft?" John asked.
Sherlock thought for a moment. “I wanted to ask you about the interview,” he said.
“Well, I haven’t finalized everything. I’ve just decided since all societal expectations have been disrupted due to the virus, I might as well as make up my own guidelines as we move forward,  ” Sherlock said. “For example, bathing . . . is it really necessary every single day?”
“Let’s make it worth your while then,” Mycroft said. “I’ll have Mr Altamont contact the police to clarify that Sherlock Holmes efficiently found and returned the painting. As it was his drunken uncle who took the painting, though, does not want to press charges. However, he thoroughly recommends the police consult Sherlock Holmes for future work.”
“Why?” she asked. “I can’t see John Watson being horrible -- what has he done?”
John stood up and paced near the window. "They don't need me right now," he said.
“Fuck,” Sherlock mumbled. He pressed his lips to John’s neck in a soft kiss. “That was good. And not was I was expecting to do tonight.”
"You seem confident, that's a good quality," she said. "How about whoever gets the job buys dinner?"
"I -- no, Sherlock, I'm taking a shower," he said.
"It was. I'm afraid of cemeteries," John teased.
"We ran into each other yesterday. We're going to go on a little trip once we sort the details.”  She seemed to want to ask a hundred more questions, but he hurried out of the kitchen and headed to Sherlock’s.
John turned as well. She was very pretty and had a warm smile. "I'll take my chances," he said.
"We're not going out to a fashion show, John," Sherlock said. Then he unbuttoned his shirt and set it next to him on the chair. He pulled off his socks before standing up, turning around and taking off his trousers. He quickly sat down and then threw his clothes over to John. "Hurry," he said. "I'm really freezing now."
"I just want to start by apologising for the things I've said and done to you while I was drinking. I'm sorry I dragged you into my divorce and I'm sorry about the things I called you and I just want you to know that I'm really trying to change and not be that person anymore."
Sherlock returned with two glasses and handed one to John. He sat back down in his chair. “I appear to have feelings for you, John Watson,” he said. “That’s most unexpected, don’t you think?”
"I don't know. I just didn't like that you were gone and I missed you so much," John said.
Sherlock slowly pushed a finger inside John. It was so intimate, being inside him like this. Since John had moved in, they’d shared so much, but this -- and what was going to happen -- was the most intimate thing they could share and the thought was almost too much.
"I'm just joking because I assumed you were joking," John said. He turned on his side. "I'm not getting another best friend."
"Not all of them.”
"What's the point of celebrating?" Sherlock said. "I have never understood that."
"Good night, John," Sherlock said, smiling as they drifted like snow into sleep.
“Fair enough,” Sherlock said. “Quick question just for clarity -- you’re saying you won’t be going on stupid dates anymore with boring strangers? You’re sure about that?”
He sat back down on the bench, and suddenly realised his whole body was in pain. Something had happened to him -- this was not the pain of sleeping on a bench. He closed his eyes, but all he could remember was his brother and the word danger. Had there been danger or had Mycroft got him out in time?
“I appreciate your coming to the wedding,” she said softly. “I hope it wasn’t too horrible for you -- I know you don’t like that kind of thing.”
Sherlock pulled his head back in surprise. He sat down and put his head in his hands. “I hated your not being here,” he said quietly. “I need you to be here.” He looked over. “Why did you kiss me?”
Even though they'd never been camping together before, there was something about the scene that seemed familiar to Sherlock. He mentioned a memory to John and then they spent the rest of dinner talking about old times. It was nice for Sherlock now, to be able to talk about the past without feeling so much sadness. After they'd finished, he went in to get the marshmallows. They found a few sticks and toasted a few.
Sherlock looked skeptical. "I was hoping for something more exciting," he mumbled. "Your turn. I'll take truth."
“You mean, yes, don’t you?”
“Nothing,” John said. “She knows nothing about me. She has a boyfriend . . . if she’s interested, it’s not going to be for my interesting backstory.”
"Twelve, actually," he said. "Then a lot of check ups and other stuff."
John ignored him. "Our hero went all over the city to find the killer. He went to a museum, he went to a dark alley, and he even went into a broken down warehouse with the help of the knight. But there were no more clues, and our hero was getting desperate. Someone else would die if he didn't hurry."
