I realised that he was very fragile today after letting out the feelings and experiences he had bottled up for so long and had misunderstood my meaning.
I could hear crying. Sherlock Holmes was crying. I could hear him sobbing over the noise of the shower and that was when I knew something was very, very wrong. I knocked on the door and asked, “Sherlock? Are you okay in there?”
The fact that Sherlock had to ask at all was an indication that he was not at the top of his game.
Sherlock’s voice broke slightly and he cleared his throat. I could see his hands shaking so I covered one of his with my own, giving him my best warm and compassionate smile. I knew this had to be hard on him, but I also knew that he had to talk about it if he was going to get any better.
I reached over the table and grasped her hand, "I'm glad too."
A strangled whisper escaped my throat at the sight, “Oh my god…”
Sherlock shook his head gently, "I understand... why you told her... she deserves to know. Just, don't tell her what happened... because, then... she’ll think… think I’m…” Sherlock let his forehead drop forwards onto his arms with a strangled sob.
We both slumped, completely spent and panting. Sherlock placed a delicate kiss to my lips before wrapping us up in the sheets that were tangled around my ankles. I think both of us felt the most rested we have ever felt in a while as sleep claimed me the instant Sherlock’s warm arms were around me, sticky stomach be damned.
“Odd certainly, though I expect I will have the answers Mr Wilson is looking for by this time tomorrow.”
I chuckled, “Yeah, so am I!”
He smiled and a huff of laughter rumbled through his chest, “I suppose you want to talk about last night?”
He trailed off again but this time he seemed less like he was reliving the memory, and more because he was so focused on me that he seemed to not even realise what he was saying. I decided to move on.
“So that was, um, that was good, right?” Sherlock asked hesitantly, moving back slightly.
We waited for what felt like hours, everyone listening for the alert notification from Sherlock’s laptop. I started checking my watch every few minutes, wondering what was taking so long…
“And now we wait,” said Mycroft, as a tense hush descended over the room.
Mrs Hudson smiled and covered my hands with hers, “Since he came back. When he died you grieved far more intensely than someone normally would for a close friend. I know you tried to date that Mary woman, but I could tell that you weren't happy with her. Not like you used to be with Sherlock. But when he came back… Well, dear, let’s just say that you’ve treated him differently ever since then!”
We have a flashback here so be warned
So I scooted closer to Sherlock to take a better look at the marks on his skin. I reached out and gently took his wrists in my hands. His skin was cool and slightly clammy as I ran my fingers deftly over his wrists.
“What’s wrong Sherlock?” I asked moving closer to him and bending over to look at him.
I put an arm over Sherlock’s shoulders and pulled him tight to my side, “As long as you’re sure…”
I nod. A situation that is out of his control is hard for Sherlock at the best of times but everything was just more difficult where Moran was involved. But I was still confused about one thing, “Okay, but what made you think that sex would help?”
Sherlock nodded as I helped him get to his feet. He draped his arm across my shoulders and I wrapped my own arm around his waist as I led him to his bedroom to find him some clothes. I tried to conceal how amazing the feel of Sherlock’s flesh against me felt. I could feel the slight tremble of his muscles beneath my fingers, the warmth of his skin, and the sound of his slightly rapid breath. Thankfully, it seemed Sherlock was far too concerned with not being sick and losing his balance to notice my own elevated breathing somewhat shaking hands.
Sherlock took the address and typed it in without taking his eyes from the screen, telling Moran to meet him there in one hour. He tapped send and again we waited with bated breath. This time, the reply only took a few minutes:
I waited all day and pretty soon it was getting dark. Still I waited, I don’t know for how long, and still he did not return. I was extremely sore from sitting in my chair for so long, so for about the hundredth time that day, I got up and paced around the living room.
Harry smiled and nodded, “I would like that.”
Sherlock sat down on the bed carefully, dilated eyes never wavering from mine. He grabbed one of my hands and placed in forcefully on his chest, splaying out my fingers. Then he said in a small, wavering voice, “Touch me John. I need you to touch me. I feel so numb inside, I have for the last few days and it’s horrible.”
The weeks that followed unfolded much in the same fashion as this first day did. I would phone Harry every so often for her advice regarding the detective but mostly Sherlock would play his violin, do experiments, watch TV idly and have flashbacks.
I took a shaky breath and nodded at him absently, taken aback at the fierceness in his manner. I was surprised to see so much of his old self in his behaviour when, honestly, I had expected him to be much more fragile in response to Moran’s sick messages.
Sherlock looked almost as dazed and shocked as I felt, but apart from a few scrapes he seemed physically fine.
I nodded and led him to the kitchen where I pulled out a chair and sat him down in it, “I’m going to get you some food. We need to get some energy into you.”
That was putting it mildly. At that moment I felt so lost. Everything I thought I knew was wrong. I wasn’t the man I thought I had been for almost forty years.
Sherlock whimpered and thrust against his open palm, making him groan in pleasure which made me even harder. I increased the pace again as he rocked against his palm, both of us watching the other through hooded lids. I felt my balls contract, heat gathering in my abdomen and I shouted Sherlock’s name as a came hard into my hand.
I heard a sniffle from the doorway of the kitchen and I looked over to see Harry standing with a glass of water and tablets, tears running over her cheeks, “That was the saddest piece of music I’ve ever heard.”
I smiled and nodded, “You’re not going to find the answers to your condition on the internet!”
Mycroft pursed his lips in displeasure, but he dialled a number on his phone and pressed the device to his ear, moving out onto the stairs briskly, “Hold fire. Establish a perimeter and asses the structure…”
He staggered out of the flat, pushing past Anderson and Sally as he went. I looked after him as he went, and I dimly recall Greg telling Sally and Anderson off after they had made some snide comments about the consulting detective, telling them to leave him alone.
His forehead was slightly hot against my hand, “Perhaps you should get some rest?”
“Sit with me?” Sherlock asked quietly without even looking up from his laptop. I raised my eyebrows, looked down at his hand on my arm and cleared my throat.
The next few days passed with some awkwardness on occasion as we tested the boundaries that we were comfortable with. Now that our relationship had swung towards a romantic nature, Sherlock had become more cautious when we touched. Whereas before he would often go to bed in nothing but his boxers and I would comfort him by holding him, now he would now wear a t-shirt (often one of mine) and sometimes even slacks before letting me touch him in bed.
Another summer, another cruise this time for four days. The people are starting to board now, it’s the same old kind of people. There’s the kid who pulls their Mothers up the ramp, eager to get on board their first ship. Their father is far behind them struggling to pull the unreasonable amount of luggage that his wife mostly likely “would die without”. He’s fed up with her but wouldn’t divorce her because he’s too much of a pushover.
Sherlock wondered what to do as John’s whole body started to look too much like a corps. Then he remembered, John’s voice rang through his head.
John looked up on top of the buildings in time to see Sherlock fall off of it John screamed bloody murder and broke free.
Sherlock hadn’t noticed that the man had walked behind him with the syringe in hand.
Ah, how do you sleep
Sherlock’s eyes shot open as he violently flew forward crumbling to his hands and knees and began to throw up.
When I hold you in my arms
There's so many there to meet’
Because, is a warm gun, mama
Or I may be asleep’
But he had stumbled into the flat, he remembered.
“Yes mum I’m on it!” Sherlock shut his journal and sighed, “Another summer, another cruise.”
“They wouldn’t like any of mine then.” John chuckled and put the needle onto the record.
Sherlock woke to the whole floor rumbling from the base of the song had put on the record player. Sherlock walk to the living area and saw John standing there.
She told him that regardless of how hard he tries to fight it, the memories and trauma will constantly be present. She told him that no matter what he does he couldn’t run away from the trauma that has been inflicted upon him. But he was Sherlock Holmes, so watch him bloody well try.
‘You live with straights who tell you, you was king
“I’m so sorry Sherlock I promise I will never leave you again, please just listen to me and wake up.”
“Male judging from that piece ace and that piece.”
Sherlock went into his bathroom and cleaned himself up he took a shower and shaved his beard then went to bed.
“BANG BANG MAXWELL’S SILVER HAMMER CAME DOWN UPON HIS HEAD!” The both sang at the top of their lungs holding their glasses of wine in the air and swishing them around to the music like a cupple of Pirates.
But he had been saved, he forgot.
Sherlock couldn’t help but marvel at his beauty.
“Sherlock? Are you- oh”
“It’s hard to tell.”
I know nobody can do me no harm
John was so absorbed in Sherlock’s closeness that he didn’t register the pain that came when Sherlock was stitching up his eyebrow.
You better see right through that mother's eyes’
“Umm… well, never mind, what are you doing?”
Sherlock shot up out of his sleep in a cold sweat he tried  to get his breath back as he noticed he was back in the deteriorating room with a needle in his arm. Sherlock pulled the syringe out of his arm. He stumbled whilst launching himself up and out of the building. With a hand over his forearm he started to run back to Baker Street.
“Well you don’t need much of an imagination to figure it out, we would get high to this song, one time,” John laid his hand on Sherlock’s head and began fiddling with his curls. “We got caught by one of the headmasters, he asked us why we thought that getting high was a smart thing to do and we all answered simultaneously with ‘because’.”
“How! How do I help you?! You’re too far way John!” Sherlock’s booming voice echoed all around them, he sounded so desperate.
Sherlock chuckled, jumped up and flipped on his coat running out the door. “The game is on Watson.”
“Look your friend is on the telly!”
“No reason.” John said as he slightly bounced to the beat of the song playing.
Ah, how do you sleep at night’
Sherlock got up took the bottle from John and stumbled to the kitchen table and placed the bottle on it. He then stumbled into his room and flopped down onto his bed with his face buried in his pillow. An hour later John woke up and decided that there was no way he could walk up the stairs in the condition he was in so he stumbled into Sherlock’s bed and crawled underneath the covers. Sherlock was so out cold that he hadn’t even noticed John pick his own legs up and slid his underneath his.
“It’s all right.” John said as he shuffled to sit himself up. John let out a grown as he pushed himself upward, he was still sore from the incident last night.
‘Please don't be long
‘I'd like to be under the sea
John's mind quickly twisted as his surroundings started to change. The London builds that lined the streets turned into nothing but shells of concrete buildings. The streets and sidewalks disintegrated into dusty roads filled with puddles of blood as bodies of soldiers occupied them.It was like one of many destroyed cities he had visited in Afghanistan.
Sherlock found himself in a dimly lit room old soiled mattresses laid in a line along  all three and a half walls. The state of everything in the room was deteriorating, the walls were rotten, the floorboards were rarely whole and the windows where shards littered on the floor.
“Hum.. ya Hello!” Sherlock stuttered as he got up and made his way to the door.
Pretty soon Sherlock saw a metal table with all to familiar torture devices laying upon it, the walls of a boggy cell also became noticed along with a blood stained floor in which his feet barely touched. He was dangling for the ceiling bound by rusty chains wrapped around his wrist a single beam of light shown over his shoulder from a hole in the cell wall.
John looked at him trying to figure out how to respond he shuffled “Oh, right yeah well.” He moved to leave a path to the door for Sherlock.
Sherlock gathered himself and went into his flat and to his room, there was clear evidence that John had been sleeping in his bed. Sherlock didn’t was to think about John sleeping in his bed on cold nights with the hope that Sherlock would be there when he woke up.
Sherlock’s mums face dropped into embarrassment, she stood up straightened out her khaki shorts and headed for the door. “Your going to be a waiter tonight at the deck social don’t be late.” And with that she left Sherlock alone.
Sherlock got closer to John placed a hand on the back of John’s neck and brought their lips as close as possible. When Sherlock mouthed the words their lips would brush over one another.
As Sherlock reached the end of his deduction Lestrade could see the the young officers face turnbright red with anger. John could also see that the younger officer was a potential threat so he  subtly moved so that his body was between Sherlock and the officer.
“I’m fine.” Sherlock rolled his eyes and left the flat.
In his octopus' garden in the shade’.
When Sherlock returned he came through the door with a bundle of flowers in one hand and the shopping in the other. He set the shopping down and went to John to give him the flowers.
Mother Superior jump the gun
Happiness is a warm gun, mama
“Sherlock! get down there and check if everyone is ready on deck 6! Those Americans are going to want to get pissheaded as soon as they get on.”
“They found the murder, and they gave the cop that fought you community service.”
When Sherlock had felt that he was able to support John he hooked his arms under John’s armpits and helped him up. A bloody bruised and exhausted John limped out of the crime scene leaning all his weight onto Sherlock the two got into a cab that Lestrade had flagged down for them and the cab drove to Baker Street.
“Sherly you left him and now look.”
John looked up at Sherlock through his one good eye and pouted, “Aww my jeans, I loved these jeans. Sherlock Holmes the shit I do for you.”
Happiness is a warm gun
The only thing you done was yesterday
He always loved the sight of it, completely and utterly empty. The whole 6th floor was divided into 5 different sections, the main deck was second to the front, it was the first deck you would walk onto as you reach the 6th floor doors. The main pool was right in the middle of the deck it was overlooked by the megatron. The pool was lined with chairs and had pubs on two sides of it. Sherlock is very keen on the design of the main seating area which was on the other side of the pool from the megatron, it was set up to look like terrace farming, each “terrace” had two small swimming pools on both ends with beach chairs pushed up against the back walls, there were about 5 “terraces”. The end of the seating area led up to the first division of the deck (the one right before the front of the boat) it was on the 8th floor. On one side it was the adult area, the adult area for sensible adults that aren’t always drunk, and the other side was a sitting area with ping pong and a big chess board, they were divided by the doors to get inside and to the stairs. The 3rd section from the front was the two floor diner. After you pass the diner you get to the 4th division of the deck which is Sherlock’s least favorite part of the deck it’s basically were all the druk adults go, the adults that should be closed off from everyone, it’s a big swimming pool surrounded by pubs. Then there’s the back of the boat which is on the 7th floor deck, the 7th floor deck stretches around 3 sections of the 6th floor deck it starts under the megatron, where Sherlock is sitting, and goes around the diner, over looks the drunk adult section and leads straight to the back of the boat, which looks like the front of the boat but because you can’t get to the front of the boat people always take pictures there acting as if It’s the front. The boat has two extra decks that are above the megatron one of them, which is the 8th floor, has two basketball courts with a volleyball court right next to it that only took up half the deck because the other half of the deck was the top floor, the 9th floor, which was where mini golf was.
John felt for Sherlock’s pulse one last time before he confirmed his only friend as deceased. When there wasn’t any movement under his White, turning blue, skin John pulled him into his lap and held Sherlock’s head as if trying to comfort him from beyond the grave.
The one mistake you made was in your head’
The two somehow ended up dancing around the living room with their eyes closed and the record playing Octopus’s garden.
Once John stopped crying Mis. Hudson stepped out of the room and onto the stairs where she sat next to Sherlock. Sherlock had begun to shake violently “I’m so sorry.” He let out a wimpier.
“Well then,” John said closing his laptop and shuffling to go to the door “shall we Mr. Holmes?” John said with a smirk.
John awoke when his hand brushed past the photo’s glass frame, jolting awake from the feeling of slightly cool glass. He frowned for a second, wondering why the picture was underneath his pillow until he remembered his roommate, whose name he still didn’t know. Deciding to ask him when they were both awake, John fumbled into his jeans from yesterday, his phone still in the pocket. Glad it wasn’t dead, he blinked to clear the last of the sleep from his eyes, focusing on the screen. 6:14. With a sigh, John propped himself up on his forearms, and gasped loudly to see his roommate already awake and at the windowsill, holding a violin, perhaps just finished tuning it as his fingers were still on the peg. Though now that he was certainly aware that John was awake, the tall teen didn’t turn, and instead lifted up the violin, brought up the bow with his other hand, and began to play. Being juniors, both of them were 15, and because of so, John thought that the music would be awful, and was prepared to clap his hands over his ears when a harmonic, flowing melody was produced. Slightly mesmerized, John simply lay there for several minutes, watching him play.
Changing the subject now, are we? -Mycroft
“I know your name because it’s written on your suitcase. I also know that you enjoy (American) football, want to become a doctor, are considering army doctor, and that you barely had enough money to come here. Why did you come here then?” Walking over, Sherlock picked up the phone on John’s nightstand and took a deep breath before rattling off a long string of deductions, barely pausing for breath in between his sentences.
When John became fully aware of what was happening he was greeted back by a terrible sight. Sherlock’s face was covered in blood with deep scratches all over it, Sherlock’s eyes were threatening tears.
“Hum? Oh yes but I have to warn you it’s pretty disturb-“
Sherlock calmly walked to the bathroom. He felt as if he was floating, an empty feeling began to bloom in his stomach. Sherlock laid John oh his bed and walked into his pitch black bathroom to get a med kit. He put his finger on the light switch, he didn’t want to turn it on, he didn’t want to see his friends blood on his face he didn’t want to know that it was his fault. He pressed the switch and immediately shut his eyes tight, he couldn’t look, the internal war that went on inside of him had been tarring himself to pieces he wasn’t sure that he could handle it. He quickly opened his eyes and looked.
Sherlock got up from the bed and quickly moved towards the front room. Sherlock reached under the couch and pulled out a wooden box, what he was about to do he had to do quickly because John would be out of the bathroom soon. Sherlock opened the box gazing at the small bag of powder and a syringe which lay neatly on a piece of velvet cloth.
“Oh, dear!”
“John, John I’m here Please wake up.”she pleaded.
Sherlock didn’t expect John to react at all, if anything he expected him to push him away but John’s arm wrapped around Sherlock and squeezed him. Sherlock panicked, does he know who I am? does he think I’m some girl? Sherlock’s questions were answered by a simple mumble from John.
“John! John! Look at me!” Sherlock shouted over John’s threats, he grabbed John’s bloody face and turned him so that they were looking into eachothers eyes. Sherlock was truly frightening by what he saw, when he looked into John’s eyes he could see that they had glossed over with anger and fright. Sherlock realize what had just happened, John had a flashback it wasn’t caused by the fight but caused buy Lestrade and Sherlock holding him back, just like how the people held John back from Sherlock’s body.
“Afternoon sleeping beauty,” he said with a hint of sarcasm and affection, a tiny smirk on his perfect lips.
I gasped, threading my fingers through his hair, “Oh, yes.”
As I wrapped my free hand around the back of his head, he looked at me like a deer in the headlights of a car. I smiled and tried to reassure him with a nod. I realised this was not what Sherlock Holmes did, open himself up to feelings and attachment, so I knew how scary this must be for the self-proclaimed sociopath. He smiled back and nodded, so I leant in closer, all my senses on overdrive in an attempt to capture this moment in my memory forever. Our noses were barely touching and I could feel Sherlock’s hot breath against my lips.
Seeing Sherlock still comfortably sleeping (and resisting the sudden unexpected urge to brush the curls that had fallen over his face away from his eyes) I stood and padded to the kitchen.
“Thank you, John,” Sherlock said loudly, covering up the rest of my sentence.
“Uh, Greg? I think he’s going to be sick, can you help me get him outside so he doesn’t contaminate the crime scene?” Before I had even finished the sentence, Greg was at Sherlock’s side and we hauled him out of the apartment and into a neighboring alleyway where Sherlock threw up what little he had in his stomach.
It was after this incident that I knew there was something seriously wrong, but when this post-traumatic stress got so serious that it started affecting Sherlock’s work, that’s when I got really worried (not that I wasn't already before but…). I got so desperate that I even considered calling Mycroft but I quickly dismissed that idea and although I desperately wished for a solution to help him get better, I never expected the solution to turn out quite like it did…
“Are you sure you don’t need help?” Sherlock asked. His eyes were filled with worry, he clearly wanted to help but I could tell that he was itching to go and scrub himself down. I was surprised that he had waited long enough to make me breakfast, but I understood his need to make sure I was okay.
“Sherlock,” I began.
“What was that about?” I murmured into his midnight hair.
As she entered, I put my finger to my lips and nodded to Sherlock’s sleeping form in my arms. She smiled gleefully and pointed excitedly at the lanky body curled up next to me. I nodded with an enduring smile and was about to speak up when Sherlock spoke.
“He’s detained. Lestrade has him in custody,” Mycroft said, gesturing to where Moran was glaring daggers at the officers surrounding him beside a police car.
Harry squeezed my hands like I had done to Sherlock so many times over the last twenty-four hours, “It’s not about orientation John! You’re in love with the person, his personality, not the body parts. Although, I’m not an expert but, I’m sure Sherlock’s parts aren’t bad at all!”
“Hey, it’s okay Sherlock. You’re okay, I’m here, you’re safe,” I said, slowly edging towards him. As I approached, I saw him trembling and looking even paler than normal. I was only a foot or so away from him, still murmuring comforting words to him when I saw it.
He was clumsy and unsure at first, but I kept moving my lips slowly over his until he caught up and realised what to do. As he relaxed into these chaste kisses, I decided to go further, daring to flick my tongue across his bottom lip. Sherlock pulled back slightly in shock, running his own tongue over where mine had been moments before. I chuckled through my nose, as he tried to figure out what was happening. I moved in again, tongue darting out to taste him once more.
I placed a hand on his shoulder and squeezed gently, before getting to my feet going back to Sherlock’s meal. I continued to make his food in contemplative silence until he spoke quietly, timidly.
I approached him and took hold of the silky blue material. Sherlock sighed dejectedly as I helped him out of the garment, my fingertips brushing my flat mate’s flesh with what seemed to me like a jolt of electricity. Then my stomach dropped as I realised something.
Mycroft approached us then, too, “There is a car waiting to take you both home.”
“You know, I suspected that something was up when I saw you two last night,” Greg said, moving to lean against the back of my armchair as he took in our appearance. He chuckled at Sherlock’s purpling bite marks, “Looks like you’re a very possessive lover John!”
I sat up incredulously, “You mean you’ve never… touched yourself before?”
He grunted his permission for me to enter and I pushed the door open to see Sherlock perched upon the edge of the bath tub with a towel wrapped around his waist, hair still damp and dripping. I let out a shaky breath, trying to keep myself objective.
“Whereas you on the other hand are equipped to cope with such an eventuality,” Sherlock grumbled, rolling onto his back and exposing the fine hair under his armpit as he threw his arm over his eyes dramatically.
He took another breath and began again, “He drugged me with a tranquiliser gun and took me somewhere. I eventually found out that it was a basement of an abandoned house in the country. It wasn’t very stylish believe me…”
Harry gave me a look which made me roll my eyes, “Thanks, I’ll be up in a second.”
U wanna meet at noon?'
“It’s aright dear,” Mrs Hudson said quietly, “I’m sure this is all a bit of a shock for you.”
“But there may be a way we can draw him out,” Mycroft continued, eyes darting towards Sherlock.
He looked uncomfortable so I said, “It’s okay. It won’t be awkward, I promise.”
“Hmm, you’re right, I don’t wanna know,” I agreed, turning back to the boiling kettle.
I raised an eyebrow at him as if to ask him whether I was classified under ‘normal people’ to which Sherlock gave me the tiniest wink, as if to say I was the exception to that rule. I smiled and turned back to Wilson, “Sorry about Sherlock, he’s never been one for tact.”
Moran got to the bottom of the stairs and stalked over to us. His eyes narrowed at me as he approached, “I’m not sure I understand what you see in this one, darling. He’s so disgustingly vanilla.”
Harry smiled, "Yeah. I felt like she was it, you know? I couldn't imagine being without her... I'm just so glad that she forgave me when I got clean."
As he said this, he dropped his head in his hands with a groan. I looked over to Harry who was watching worriedly, “Can you get some water and painkillers? There should be some in the top cupboard.”
As I stepped out of the shower and got back into my pyjamas, I vowed that I would always treasure Sherlock in those moments of ecstasy, and the moments of lazy contentment that followed, and every single moment I spent with him after that. I would make sure that he felt safe and secure, and above all to ensure that he knew he was cherished and loved. These thoughts brought a smile back to my face as I left the bathroom, planning to curl up next to Sherlock once more.
“Well, thanks again Sherlock, I owe you,” Greg said with a shake of his head, following the officers out of the bank.
So sorry for the wait guys!! I've been really busy at school and then my internet wasn't working for about a week so it's been kinda hectic lately!!
I chuckled; it was so endearing watching him trying to figure out the main function of kissing someone. I decided to attempt to clarify things for him, “Well, it’s not about achieving something in particular; it’s more about letting the other person know that you care for them.”
Sherlock opened his eyes questioningly, “Like what?”
But wait a minute, I had been treating him differently. I had hardly let him out of sight for almost the whole time Sherlock had been back. I didn’t want him running off again, or so I had told myself. Maybe there really was something in this, not just some weird delusion or something.
“Shit,” he said. “What do you think set him off this time?”
“Relax,” I whispered against his perfect Cupid’s bow lips, before closing the gap. I brushed my lips against his briefly, to get him used to me, before repeating this motion to taste Sherlock a second time. Then, I stayed longer against his lips, applying more pressure with my own, moving my mouth against him.
I looked desperately at Mycroft and Lestrade, who were watching us with sad eyes at Sherlock's distress, "What do we do Mycroft. Tell me, what the fuck can we do?"
Sherlock nodded and licked his lips again as I moved my hands back to my trouser fly. I undid the zip and pushed the band over my hips to rest around my thighs, my eyes never leaving Sherlock’s. My cock stood erect, tenting my boxers and I began by palming myself through the thin material.
I nodded, swallowing the lump in my throat and adjusting my position so that I was leaning over Sherlock. I decided to start slow for both our sakes, pressing a chaste kiss to his lips while trailing my fingers down over his chest. He shivered beneath my touch, making he hesitate and stopping me from exploring down any further.
Sherlock hummed in response and brought is fingers to my chin to tilt my face back towards him. He leaned in for another slow kiss, flicking his tongue into my mouth. He pulled back and smiled at the contented expression on my face.
“Mr Wilson, I have been informed that you have an unusual problem to which I think I may be able to provide an answer, providing it is not utterly dull. I’m assuming it has something to do with the frankly alarming amount of typing you have been doing lately.”
So I said nothing, but gave him an icy cold look, folded my arms over my chest and a shrugged my shoulders, indicating for him to go on. He did.
I attempted to push my anger away and focus on helping Sherlock. Mycroft was clearly concerned for his little brother, although he would never show it; he was distressed at Sherlock’s condition.
“So, uh, Sherlock? Do you wanna tell me what happened out there?” I asked quietly.
Harry laughed, “What? In my objective lesbian opinion, Sherlock is a very attractive person.”
“They have news,” he said in a small, breathless voice.
We lay in each other’s embrace for a little longer until my uncomfortable fidgeting due to the mess on my front caused Sherlock to order me into the shower. I got up off the bed and casually walked to the door, not stopping for any clothes on the way. If I was allowed to walk naked around Sherlock’s bedroom now, why not enjoy it?
"So, I know that Greg has noticed something is wrong and that he was really worried about you. Should he know what's going on?"
Sherlock pulled away and hummed slightly, scratching the back of his head as he thought things over. I stepped away and turned back to his soup in a desperate attempt to hide the extreme blush colouring my neck and face. How could I say that out loud? To Sherlock of all people! He probably thought I was being disgustingly soppy... I had told myself that I wasn't going to drop any of this on him until he was better! Why did this have to be so confusing?
He jerked his head to the side, indicating a thick stack of papers next to him with scribbled notes written all over the music staves, “You’ve been composing?”
The young man smiled tightly and led the way back to the door. Sherlock looked speedily around behind the counter before following Vincent Spaulding. He gave directions, gazing out into the street, allowing Sherlock to observe him without being spotted.
He still seemed entranced by my careful petting of his wrists and answered without looking up at me, “He chained me to a wall and put a shock collar on me. If I ‘misbehaved’, then he would… punish me…”
Sherlock’s hands were shaking. Badly.
“Well, I’m an old broken soldier with an occasional psychosomatic limp! And you, you’re beautiful, clever, generous and, well, you’re Sherlock Holmes! I’m so lucky.”
“Jesus Christ!” Greg exclaimed; he had moved closer to Sherlock when I had taken off his scarf.
“Hi Greg, do you need something?”
We kept an eye on him for the next day and a half until another body was found, almost identical to the last. I had thought about trying to convince him to leave this one alone, but I knew even before I said anything that such an attempt would be futile.
He was still shaking his head so I grasped the back of his neck and shook him gently again, “Okay, okay, you want to know what to do? You need to calm down first. Just take some deep breaths…”
“Well, you’re lucky that I’m very bored at the moment so I will take your case,” Sherlock said with a sigh as though it caused him physical pain. He got to his feet and left the interrogation room to find Lestrade standing outside.
I found Sherlock rinsing his mouth in the bathroom. He looked pale and his hands were trembling slightly, but when our eyes met in the mirror, his expression was clear and fierce. Abruptly, he bent down and scrubbed water over his face with such force I though he was trying to rub his skin off.
I turned to Sherlock, who was looking warily at Lestrade, and placed a gentle hand on his arm, “Why don’t you go play something for me, yeah? That always makes you feel better.”
There was silence for a moment after Sherlock’s words faded from the air. I was listening intently for any sound of movement but all I could hear was the pounding of my own heart in my ears and the rattling of my nervous breath in my throat.
All of a sudden, Sherlock looked around dazedly and I could tell by his glazed eyes that he was not fully with us yet. So I took this opportunity to ask him what he was seeing.
She nodded and hurried off. I turned back to Sherlock, “What were you reading?”
“As always,” Sherlock whispered with a sly smirk.
So so so sorry for the lateness of this update! Senior year is a bitch!
‘Wow! Congratz! I told u he liked u back! Was it good? :P’
Sorry for the shortness and lateness again but hopefully there will be more soon!
Usually, Sherlock is not phased by gruesome sights but as soon as he laid eyes on the woman, I knew there was something terribly wrong.
I slouched to the side so that I was no longer kneeling over Sherlock and looked him over quickly, “Sherlock? Are you alright? Are you hurt?”
Then I would shake myself and just be thankful that there was a ‘we’ at all. Sherlock Holmes was mine and I held a piece of him that no one else has ever possessed, making me feel as though my heart would burst with joy.
“The only thing I could think of was to shoot it off by taking one of the guns off the guards but I knew Moran would hear me but I had no choice. I shot the chain off where it was connected to the floor, opened the back doors of the van and jumped out.”
It took me a while to calm Sherlock, eventually the tears stopped and his breathing returned to normal but he looked exhausted. I coaxed him into his armchair, before perching myself on the armrest. I pushed the curls that had stuck to his forehead away, feeling the clammy moisture on his skin. I took his pulse at his wrist and surveyed Sherlock’s face; his eyes were dull and unseeing, a horrible homage to when he first came back to me. His face was ashen but his pulse, although still slightly elevated, was returning to normal.
I shook my head again in exasperation, “Okay, fine. Whatever you say! Just give me some toast, I’m starving.”
“Oh… Oh no… tell me he didn’t…”
“Tell him you’ll be there, Sherlock,” Mycroft said tightly from the dining table. “There was a good chance this could happen, but we have to act.”
I opened the door quietly to see him tangled in his sheets, tossing and turning with the light from his bedside lamp shining off the cold sweat on his half naked body. I was unsure of what to do; if I woke him he would probably yell at me and shut me out, but at the same time I couldn’t leave him in this state.
Just as I finished saying this, he had another dizzy spell and clung to the doorframe of the bathroom, “Ugh, maybe not…” Sherlock said quietly.
I let him cry silently into my chest as I held him and stroked his hair, kissing him every so often and reassuring him until his breathing evened out and he slept soundly against me, our bodies intertwined.
I’m not sure how much time passed while I dressed and collected my thoughts, but as I was tying my shoes, Mrs. Hudson knocked on the open bedroom door and came in with a steaming mug of tea.
Mycroft held up a hand to halt his brother, “Stay where you are, Sherlock. You don’t need to see this again.”
“Alright,” Sherlock said, wrapping his arms tighter around me, “So, do you want to keep our, um, relationship, a secret for now? Considering you’re feelings about our situation being of a homosexual nature?”
My heart broke as Sherlock’s breathing faltered when Moran found his trigger spots. I shifted my weight helplessly. It was agony watching Sherlock be subjected to this and being unable to stop it. Finally, Moran straightened and gazed at Sherlock with disturbingly dilated eyes.
Sherlock groaned, “I’m not hungry! I don’t want to eat.”
I nodded, “Yes, that’s exactly it.”
‘I can hardly contain myself, see you soon pet.’
We burst into almost hysterical laughter, clutching each other as we tried to breath through our giggle fit.
Sherlock sighed, lowering his feet to the floor and running his hands through his curls, making my stomach flip. I had seen him do that many times before but only now had I realised how beautiful he was.
Sherlock was overwhelmed with the flashbacks he used to be a machine, he was the impossible man and now he’s a broken shell of a man. He was done he injected his arm with a syringe filled to the brim with heroin as the drugs coursed through his veins he let out a moan, threw his head back and let the drug take his mind.
‘Ah, how do you sleep
She's well acquainted with the touch of the velvet hand like a lizard on a window pane.
“If you say so, you old cock.”
Sherlock knew exactly what John had meant so he laughed along.
The flat was completely quiet, completely and utterly quiet and Sherlock couldn’t take it, so as he was marking down the flexibility of a toe he started to Hum ‘here comes the sun’ John immediately recognized the song and started singing along.
How do you sleep? By John Lennon
Well don't you know that happiness is a warm gun.’
That night Sherlock passed out in his arm chair, his lack of sleep had cought up to him, and John had gone to bed in his own room.
“-And that’s why you left them.”
Sherlock’s head flew back causing him to wake up. John had moved his leg out from underneath Sherlock’s head eliminating Sherlock’s only support. Sherlock sat up and took a minute to figure out what had and hadn’t happened the time was three in the morning Sherlock stood up still half asleep and rubbed his eyes. He looked at John curled up on the couch and felt a pit open in his stomach. Sherlock wanted his dream to be real he’d wanted so much for it to be true that he would give anything. But, it wasn’t true it would never be so, as if a man like John could ever love a man like him.
When Sherlock returned to the kitchen he was surprised to see that John had cleaned off the table, placed the food out and poured some cheap wine that he pulled out of the cabinets.
Sherlock jumped as the screaming began, he curled up into a ball and squeezed his eyes shut.
Nevertheless, John allowed his mind to wonder, to fantasize.
Then it all disappeared.
John grabbed the half filled bottle and brought it up to his lips and took a mouthful of it. Sherlock followed in pursuit they cleared their throat at the same time.
John’s eyes flashed open as Mrs. Hudson shook him awake. “He’s back” she said and then walked away. The images of Sherlock smashing his face into the ground and falling off the building still swam John’s mind. John’s emotions ran of the chain, he was mad happy but all of his emotions were drowned out by his feeling of being betrayed.
John’s screams gradual decreased over the course of thirty minutes. Usually John would have calmed Down by now and Sherlock would be back in his bed but as soon and John’s screams fell silent his body started to violently shake. Sherlock worried that if he just put John back in his bed and left him there John would have a panic attack and end up hyperventilating. So Sherlock unwrapped John’s shaking body from the white sheets and threw them onto the bed. He then slid his long arms underneath John’s body and cradled him. John turned in Sherlock’s arms so that his face was buried in Sherlock’s chest and smiled. Sherlock shuffled onto his knees and pushed himself up struggling a little to get his legs to steady themselves.
Then the man laughed and pulled out a rusty syringe with a bag of white powdered and a spoon. Sherlock watched in a cold sweat as the man slowly poured the powder onto the spoon and lit a match underneath it. The man got up halfway through the process and threw the lit match at Sherlock’s feet. He walked over to the metal table and grabbed a belt, and wrapped it tightly around Sherlock’s arm cutting off the circulation. The man the went back to his metal chair changed the channel and started the process back up.
Before Lestrade could finish his sentence Sherlock had rolled his eyes and push the door open.
A wave of relief washed over Sherlock as his name passed through John’s lips with a whisper. John raised his hand to Sherlock’s cheek, as if he wasn’t completely sure Sherlock was real, he smiled.
“You fucking prick!” The officer erupted into a yelling-fit.
“Sherlock, it’s me, Please. Sherlock answer me!” John began to cry, Sherlock’s blank stare brought back a bloody memory which made John feel alone it caused his heart to ache and his body to shiver.
“Yes.” Sherlock answered wide awake.
This was the damage of Sherlock Holmes.
“John, what’s the matter?” Sherlock’s mind then clicked, he’s going into a panic attack.
Sherlock had been there for a week, he was an addict, he was alone in the world even Bill Wiggins had moved on. Sherlock turned up at Mycroft’s door step one night asking for money Mycroft, instead, offered him food which ended in an argument between the two. Sherlock never returned.
Jump when your momma tell you anything
Nothing.
Please don’t you be very long’
Sherlock looked down at the bright blue swimsuit that hugged his thighs. “What too colorful?” Sherlock teased as he shifted his legs on the table, leaning from one hip and then to the other. “Does it not go with the white shirt?”
Sherlock looked at John with a child like excitement and raised his eyebrows and quickly nodded his head.
‘He say one and one and one is three Got to be good looking 'Cause he's so hard to see Come together right now Over me’
And since you're gone you're just another day
He said “I adore you Mr. Holmes.” In a low growl that Sherlock had never heard before.
Sherlock coughed loudly gaining Lestrade’s attention “Is it through here?”
Lestrade chuckled, “He really said that? Christ.”
Sherlock returned to his small cabin and settled on the balcony to read his book. The cabin was incredibly small for Sherlock’s standards, it’s small for anyone’s standards. The room was a sort of pledge to the world of minimalist. When you walk in the  lavatory is to your right, includes a loo a sink and a shower, the wardrobe is to your left. The cabin opens up about two feet into the… everything room. There’s a small table with a couch on the right, a sort of makeup place to your left with a mirror, the bed is right next to the couch and the balcony is one step away form the bed. Sherlock despises the smallness of the room but his mom says that it’s meant to be cosy and homely, whatever it was Sherlock thought it was appalling.
John frantically grabbed Sherlock’s shoulders to let him know he was there. Sherlock began to rip off his own jacket he frantically searched for the opening John pulled the jacket off and threw it aside. When he looked back he saw Sherlock violently smash his face on the concrete.
“That’s the plain.” Sherlock remarked, he shut the door and went to the balcony to retrieve his book.
Sherlock’s eyes shot open and realized it was blood, he hesitated, as if he thought the problem was in his head and it would go away. Then the blood began to roll down his face, he picked John up slowly and calmly walked down the stairs to his bedroom.
When Sherlock came back he kneeled down next to John and unpacked the kit.
He swung open the bedroom door and began to assess the situation. John was in his bed with the covers thrown over his head he was tossing around screaming Sherlock’s name.
Then everything stopped, the spots in his eyes disappeared, his hands weren’t hurting from gripping cloth and his body wasn’t laying on anything. The feeling  of John left Sherlock.
It was 1 O’clock by the time Sherlock had finally reached the steps of 221B the felt faint and light. His hands stumbled around in his pockets looking for the keys no matter how hard he tried he couldn’t find them. Sherlock started to panic, he didn’t know why all he had to do was knock on the door, but he didn’t want anyone to see him like this.
‘Ah, how do you sleep
John began to shift through his albums found John Lennon’s imagine and began to play track 8.
“Welp, Mr. Watson,” Sherlock said as he steadyed himself to treat John’s split eyebrow. “You’ve got a cupple of bruises, a scrape that ripped open the knee of your jeans, your right eye is closed up and you have a split in your eyebrow.”
‘Well, it only goes to show
“Ваш брат би био веома разочаран што сте га покупили, зар не?”
There’s the Uni kid who has ran away from his family for the summer and has decided that all his mates, with the same intentions as him, should come with him. He’s just turned the legal age for Americans to drink so he has bottles and bottles stashed away in his bag.
‘Those freaks was right when they said you was dead
Sherlock didn’t notice when John had stopped dancing. just to look at Sherlock, he watched as Sherlock’s body jumped to the beat, his curls hung and bounced with his body. He watched him and thought he was the most beautiful thing on god's green earth. John had done a lot of thinking when Sherlock “died” he thought about Sherlock, he thought about his relationship and how it should have been different.
John said nothing to Sherlock and he turned and left without warning leaving Sherlock to listen to the rest of the song alone. Sherlock could have gone after him he could have turned off the song but he didn't, he felt like he deserved this he did deserve this.
It's driving me mad
Sherlock shook as he brought his head up to look at the small television in the corner of the room. It was a security tape of the flat Sherlock’s flat back in London his eyes focused in a lump curled up on his chair clutching a pillow. It was John and he was crying it started as a wimpier and grew into a yell a loud and furious yell crying out to Sherlock.
“Sherlock.” A voice came for the other side of the door snapping him out of his fantasy.
‘We'll be over soon they said’
“Is it really that bad?” John said in a growl of a morning voice.
“How could you do this to me?! How could you leave me?! Sherlock!?”
Sherlock had done everything he could to stop John from screaming, but he wouldn’t budge. John was screaming and yelling for Sherlock to help him Sherlock’s heart rate picked up the more John pleaded and then finally Sherlock yelled back.
“Are you going to lock yourself in here the whole time?” Sherlock’s mum asked as she pushed her way into the room.
"Get out of my way!" John yelled pushing through the crowd, all of them on their cellphones, calling for an ambulance.
Sherlock leaned into the touch, John’s hands were wet and sticky he thought that John was just sweaty from panicking but it was too much ‘sweat’ to be sweat.
Sherlock’s view was disturbed when he noticed one of the staff members, Anderson, staring daggers at him.
John was running, like his life depended on it though he couldn’t remember why he was running. The brick walls of a dark alleyway stretch high above his head and into the starry night sky. The alley was pitch black other than the small amount of light that illuminated from the sky.
I need a fix 'cause I'm going down
‘Because the wind is high it blows my mind
As he watched, John was struck by something. “You’ve been here for a few years already, haven’t you?” No response.
“Nothing extreme, just a couple shots.” John waited for his sister to go into more detail, and after a moment, she did, but with a sigh.
And finally, a girl who looked like the female version of Sherlock. Her hair was dark and cut short, styled in the same way a boy’s might be. It had a bit of a curl at the end, and her eyes were sharp and intelligent. She wore makeup, jewlery and fake nails, but not the school uniform, yet no one seemed to be scolding her. He didn’t question it, and he was sure that even under the makeup, she was pretty. Very pretty.
Happy Spring Break to all you fellow students!
“It would appear so, yes.” Finishing off his cigarette, Sherlock threw it into the pond and strolled away, leaving John to scramble after him.
“Does it have to be one?” Walking away, Sherlock left behind a John Watson who was even more confused than in the morning.
Several minutes and hasty scrambling later, everything was back in the suitcase, though some were hanging out a bit. Everyone had gone back inside but were definitely still awake, and as John couldn’t find that stupid key, he figured there was no harm in pounding on the door to get his roommate to let him in.
“We don’t all hate him, just you and Philip.” Anderson raised an eyebrow, and reluctantly, Mike added, “And the maybe rest of the school. Except Irene, Molly, and I.”
“You used up all of it?” There was a quiet chuckle and the sound of someone moving. “What’s so funny?” He asked.
It is my concern when Mummy phones me to say that you’re causing trouble again and wants me to talk to you. Again. -Mycroft
Either Sherlock really didn’t have any classes with him, or he just skipped class, which wouldn’t be that surprising to John after learning that he fucking smoked.
“Sherlock, you just littered. Oh my fucking god I’m rooming with a criminal, one who smokes and litters. You’re like someone a school would bring in and they would say don’t be like you.” Sherlock snorted and brought out his phone, checking the time. 8:04.
“Room 22, Building 1B.” Now wanting to be bothered, Sherlock scrawled down a note on a piece of paper and stuck it outside the room door before locking it. The paper read “Piss off, this is the sociopath’s home.” That would discourage any lost freshmen or any staff that wanted to check up on the students, as it would either scare them away or have them assume he was simply homesick. That left only his roommate to take care of, and annoyingly, it was inevitable, getting one. Of course, sooner or later he usually had the room to himself because no one wanted to live with him, but he always got a roommate at the beginning of the year.
Also, I hope I didn't offend anyone with the sentence about the Bible? It was honestly the best analogy my brain-dead mind could think of.
(See the end of the chapter for
Some things might be wrong here, as I don't do much research for my stories
“What d’you think of Sherlock? Tall guy, curly hair?” He asked, digging into his lunch. Molly blushed, Philip and Sally snorted, while Irene and Mike just grinned.
Not only could he play the violin, but he could apparently also read your life story off of you like you were a book.
“Are you just going to watch me, or are you going to say something, because it’s rather difficult to play when someone is staring at you.” Carefully placing his instrument back into its case, Sherlock turned to his roommate, taking in the messy hair and oddly bright eyes for someone up so early. Used to staying up late and not getting much sleep then, another slightly annoying aspect of his new roommate which would make him more difficult to aggravate.
“Yeah, yeah, I’m fine.” Quickly changint the topic, he asked, “Harry, how much’ve you had to drink?” There was a pause, and John sighed, prompting his sister. “Harry, come on. We both know it’s a problem, that’s why I’m here at Baskerville. No need to hide it. How much?”
“You’re fifteen! You can’t smoke! You’re breaking the bloody law!” Smirking, Sherlock repeated the exact sentence as before.
“Well….yes.” There was a silence that was only broken by a soft rustling as Sherlock searched through his pockets for something.
This is just going right into "Blind Baker" but obviously won't be the exact same, our favourite duo being teenagers.
It took several minutes of knocking, and at that point, John was wondering if his roommate was even in there. He was on the verge of giving up and going back down to ask for another key when the door swung open, revealing a pale, lanky teen, who looked very annoyed. The tall boy looked him over for a few seconds, not saying a word. Shifting uneasily, John cleared his throat, wondering what was going on. “You’re my roommate then?” The teen sounded disappointed, and John hesitantly nodded.
“You’re being rather polite to me, did you not see the note on the door?” Glancing back at John, who was still standing in the doorway, pale grey eyes caught sight of John’s confused expression, and the boy let out a sigh. “Of course not, someone removed it then. Quite annoying. Either way though, you’re terribly late, I was beginning to think I got lucky and didn’t get a roommate this year.” Before John could even get a word in, the boy flopped down onto his bed, slid under the covers, and continued talking. “I’ll have you know that you should not touch anything on the desk if you value your life, and that I’m a sociopath, not a psychopath, there’s a difference. Now, I’ll be going to sleep, and if you would like to keep that photograph in your suitcase safe, do not wake me, turn the light on, or touch anything that is mine. The key is on the floor in front of you, it was kicked under the door, I assume accidentally, but someone could’ve been pranking you, that happens quite often here. Either way, I believe that’s all for tonight. Goodnight John Watson.”
“We’ve heard of him all right. He’s a psychopath, don’t get near him. He’s a freak, he can tell your life story just by looking at your shoes or something. We all hate him, except Molly, she has a crush on the weirdo.” Donovon said, causing Molly blushed even harder while Mike frowned.
It wasn’t mandatory for today, but Sherlock was dressed in his school uniform anyway, though it was only the dress pants and school shirt, as he considered the sweater “annoying and unimportant, like people.” He was, however, wearing school shoes that clicked loudly as he walked, letting everyone know that the ‘psychopath’ (It's sociopath! Get your facts right.” He would often correct whenever called this.) had arrived. Unwilling to talk to anyone, he snatched up the keys and his schedule, planning on locking himself in his room for the rest of the day, at least until his roommate arrived.
It's the first day of school
Sherlock paused for a few moments to draw in breath, and John was blushing slightly, shocked, embarrassed, and angry. Perfect.
Sharp cheekbones, curly hair, smartly dressed, ignoring school rules, she seemed exactly like John’s new roommate.
Fortunately, in homeroom, he met a student who was willing to show him around, and even be his friend. His name was Mike Stamford, and he’d been at Baskerville High since becoming a freshman.
“Er, hey, so, I didn’t catch your name. How’d you figure out mine though, yesterday?” Sherlock turned to find John fully sitting up now, legs crossed underneath the blanket like he was in first grade. Ignoring the implication that he should introduce himself, Sherlock went straight into his deductions.
What I do and how my roommate is affected is not your concern. -SH
John liked that about him, and agreed to meet him, ironically, next to the pond to have a tour after classes.
Tell me if you see something blatantly wrong!
He also threw out threats, was rude, and did crazy experiments from the look of it. John had himself a very interesting roommate. Picking up his phone from where Sherlock had left it, (at the foot of John’s bed, dropped after Sherlock examined the charging port,) John called his sister, knowing she was either still awake or woken up already.
“My hair is naturally curly, you idiot!” Sally snarled, blushing hard at being caught. Sherlock hardly showed any reaction at the shout, instead idly taking one of Irene’s apple slices. He took his time eating it, ignoring Sally’s reddening face.
“You just- I-.....” John was speechless. “I- yeah. That- that’s right.” Sherlock frowned. Where were the insults, the looks of terror, he wasn’t supposed to be amazed, he was supposed to think Sherlock was weird, a stalker, a freak. “That was…..brilliant.” At this point, Sherlock just about gaped at the boy across from him. Brilliant. Brilliant? He’d just been called brilliant. By someone he had just deduced. That was…..unnatural. Complimented. He’d just been complimented. No idea how to respond to this, Sherlock simply picked up his phone and headed out the door. He paused for a second before walking through and turned back.
Stop playing violin and annoying your new roommate. -Mycroft
(See the end of the chapter for
“Drunk? Yes, no other reason for him to become frightening or violent. If it was drugs, you and your sibling would’ve turned him in in a heartbeat. You left your sister at home with a grieving mother. It had to be your father who died, or else you wouldn’t feel safe leaving your sibling alone with an alcoholic man. Sexist? Every so slightly, but balance of probability. Now, gender regardless, your mother also turned to the bottle when your father died, and you wouldn’t want to leave your sister alone and have her relive that. Earlier on, I said that the phone was taken care of well. True, it’s spotless, except for the charging port. It has scratches everywhere, so your sibling’s hands are shaky when trying to plug it in. Conclusion, both your sibling and mother have fallen victim to the bottle, but your sibling isn’t all the way in yet and insisted you go here before you got drawn in as well or got hurt.”
“Hey, Harry! I’m…..” John debated whether or not he should tell her about Sherlock, and decided not to, yet. She might be offended that he’d figured everything out about their disfuctinal family, or think he was living with some sort of psychopath, which reminded John; Sherlock had called himself a sociopath, hadn’t he? Said he was a sociopath, not a psychopath, that there was a difference.
As it was the first day of school, that meant not much work, so it gave him plenty of time to think about his interesting roommate.
“Yes yes yes, I know mothe-” Now he was the one getting cut off by a harsh glare, and with a sigh, Sherlock corrected himself. “Fine, Mummy, I know what to do, I’ve been here two years already. I’ll see you at Christmas.” Reaching in to get his violin case and compacted music stand, Sherlock flashed what he hoped was a reassuring smile at his mother before grabbing his things and closing the door, setting off for the front doors at a brisk walk.
A confused John Watson sat on his bed, wondering what had happened. He’d only been awake for 20 minutes, hadn’t even left his bed, and he was more lost than he’d ever been.
Each chapter title is going to be a Sherlock quote, so if you have any favourite quotes, tell me!
Frustrated, John walked out of what felt like the hundredth building and wandered the school grounds, deciding to just skip breakfast, and as homeroom was at 8:20, he had plenty of time to leisurely wander. Breakfast ended at 8, meaning he would have plenty of time trying to find someone to help him navigate the school once breakfast did end.
The room, which had only been illuminated with the glow of the apparent sociopath’s lamp, was turned off, plunging the room into darkness save for the light coming in from the corridor.
“The name’s Sherlock Holmes, and the map of the school is on the back of your schedule.” For one of the first times in his life, Sherlock was unsure of what to do next, so he did his signature click-wink that he used to charm girls, (he charmed girls so he could butter them up and get information, that’s all he was doing, buttering up John so it would be more fun to pick him apart later. That’s all, he wasn’t at all flustered, he knew exactly what he was doing.) and left, closing the door behind him.
So he was used to not getting much sleep and had no problem with the school’s uniform, enjoyed it even. Considering he had the most ridiculous and poshest sounding name possible, the fact that he wasn’t bothered with a fancy uniform shouldn’t be much of a surprise. Sherlock Holmes. (Of course, it had crossed John’s mind that he’d slept in the same room as a complete stranger, not even knowing his name and that with the threats he’d thrown out along with the experiments on the table, he could’ve been a murderer for all John knew, yet he’d trusted a random teenager to not pull a prank on him or steal his things. He wasn’t going to think about how he quickly trusted a complete stranger, he was just tired that night is all.)
Not edited (at least by someone else that's not me) and I know nothing of the British or boarding schools, so I apologize for any mistakes.
“John? You alright?” Realizing that he’d been silent for too long, John quickly gave his reply in what he hoped was a reassuring voice.
A boy with snottish features, slightly curled hair and slightly pale, who was sitting close to another girl with puffed up, curly brown hair and a darker skin tone. Philip Anderson and Sally Donovan, both of whom wanted to be detectives, though Anderson wanted to be on the forensic team.
“You’re his roomie? Dang, goodluck mate.”
“Yeah, now, if you could let me in, that’d be wonderful.” Raising an eyebrow, the boy’s eyes flickered over to the suitcase on the ground and clicked his tongue, but stepped aside, talking as he went deeper into the room.
“You know where the cafeteria is, yet you skipped breakfast. Or did you just come out here because you knew I would get lost and come out?”
“Am I supposed to be offended by that?” He drawled, taking long, quick, strides so John had to slightly jog to keep up.
Lighting another cigarette, Sherlock took a long drag and blew out a billow of smoke before responding.
Raising an eyebrow at the three different reactions, he made a rolling motion with his hands to tell them to explain.
Ao3 also decided to be very annoying and not allow me to post this for several days, so sorry for the late update!
You just changed the subject as well. -SH
Kinda just a filler chapter, technically it's not strictly necessary to read
“Perhaps because my voice is naturally that way, and unlike you, I don’t use anything to improve myself. My curls are indeed natural, unlike yours Donovan.”
“Yeah, alright. Love you, Harry.”
Scowling again, Sherlock thought for a moment before typing.
You don’t need to sign your name, no one else could be that stalkerish or annoying. -SH
“Be good Sherlock! Remember, your-” Abruptly dropped his suitcase, Sherlock successfully cut off the rest of his mother’s sentence. He’d been here for two years already, and didn’t need the “Take care, be good!” speech again.
The owner of that smooth baritone voice slid down into a spot between Mike and Irene, the two tall teenagers looking odd next to the stouter Mike.
“You wouldn’t have wanted to go to yesterday’s tour anyway, it would be full of freshmen. Meet me next to the pond at 3:30 and I’ll give you a tour, yeah?” Then they’d parted, going off to their different classes.
“You. You’re still so oblivious as to how alcohol works. Mom got drunk, she most likely won’t remember how much she drank, so don’t worry, she won’t take it out on me. Whenever she gets drunk, all she does is drink even more until she passes out, I’ll be fine. You have classes to attend, and so do I. Call me back later, yeah?”
“Yes, it is curly by nature. However, you’ve been curling it more and more, since it’s been getting more straight than curly now, and your curls are apparently the reason that idiot Anderson fell in love with you, and you desperately want to keep him.” Sherlock brushed his hands together and stood, flashing a smile with his brilliantly white teeth. “See you in the dorm, John.” Then he was gone.
His plan set, he found himself walking to the pond, (what kind of bloody school has a pond?) where a lone figure sat on a rock, and as he got closer, John could see a crisp white shirt with wild, untamed curls. Sherlock.
Okay, how do I delete the notes below this-
The door was now closed, the key placed on John’s nightstand, and his photo safely tucked away under his pillow, the rest of his things still in the suitcase that was abandoned at the foot of his bed. The teenager himself was fast asleep, tired from the day’s activities. Sherlock, however, was nowhere close to sleep. Instead, he waited and deduced, finding out that John was a rather deep sleeper, which was useful information, though a little annoying. However, no matter how much he wanted to get rid of the boy, waking him up in the middle of the night did seem a little cruel. (Wait, since when did he care about other people’s feelings?) So, instead of getting up and doing something, he settled for running over the information he’d already gathered, working out the best ways to annoy the other boy. Sherlock spent a good amount of time doing this, thinking of the most complex plans, and by the time he had everything figured out, sunlight was trying to peek through the curtains. Deciding that sleep would probably do him some good, Sherlock laid back down, his mind slowing down enough for him to get a few moments of peace, enough for him to fall asleep.
No response. Sherlock smirked, taking this as his brother’s submission. “Idiot.” Placing the phone back down, Sherlock checked the time before turning it off. 6:28. Breakfast was at 7:30, so he had an hour to run his roommate out, shouldn’t be that hard. Simply expressing his interests should be enough to have him running. Or, perhaps he should deduce everything about him, that always seemed to scare them. Or both, that would work fine. A part of his plan had already been foiled, John having awoken before Sherlock started playing violin. Though annoying, there were still plenty of ways to annoy the other teen. Since John had arrived late yesterday, he’d missed the tour for new students, meaning he would have no idea where to go. Sherlock could tell him all the wrong directions, but that wasn’t really his style. He decided to go with his usual way, with insults and deductions. It happened naturally, so not much work was involved anyway.
John looked around at them, surprised, Swallowing the last of his food, he wondered if he should tell them or not.
After Sherlock left him standing next to the pond, looking after a disappearing trail of smoke, John had rushed to class, most of his time spent trying to find the right room.
“Love you.”
“Right. Sorry. That was, um, that was really good. You’re really good at violin.” Sighing, Sherlock walked over to his bed, reaching for his phone as it dinged, not even needing to think about his next words, the insult coming practically naturally.
“You didn’t ask.” Lestrade responded as he guided Sherlock to a room at the end of the corridor.
By the time Sherlock had finished all the evidence bags were filled and labeled, but Sherlock was on a roll so he started to deduce everyone in the room. Starting with Lestrade then moving to John and finally to the young man. The officer, who was already on edge about Sherlock, he was not going to let Sherlock deduct his whole life and get away with it.
Mother Superior jump the gun
Sherlock stated as his long bony finger directed John and Lestrade’s attention to two bits of human on two different sides of the room.
“What the hell, John what are you-.” Sherlocks rant was cut off by John’s screams. The detective jumped up and ran towards the lights flicking them on.
John managed to get up and steady himself he walked to the bathroom and shut the door.
The song wrapped a cold iron fist around Sherlock’s heart he didn’t know if he wanted to throw up form John’s stare or collapse to his knees and cry.
Then, a body smacked into the ground in front of the window. John felt like he had swallowed his heart as he watched a big black coat settle against the limp body on the pavement. All the blood rushed from John's face as he stumbled out of the coffee shop and towards the crowd of people, now spilling into the streets.
“SHERLOCK!” John called out but Sherlock could hear another voice with John’s, it was Mis. Hudson’s she sounded so scared so panicked.
Just as John promised Sherlock he wouldn’t leave, Sherlock's legs started to disintegrate into sand. John looked up to see half of his friend completely gone and replaced by sand. John started to scream in frustration as he clawed at his friend in a final effort to save Sherlock, then the detective was gone, nothing but dust.
Because the wind is high, ah’
When John left Mary he had finally excepted his sexuality, he had always known that he was bi,  but besides his male lovers no one knew the truth . When John left Mary he had finally admitted to him self that he loved Sherlock, but you wouldn’t catch him dead telling Sherlock.
I want you so bad
Sherlock’s vision began to form spots from how hard he was pushing into John’s chest, his hands hurt from the white knuckle grip he had on John’s shirt and his body shivered at the though of the lifeless body that lay beneath it.
The song changed, John snapped out of his trance and immediately fell into another as Sherlock changed the way his body moved to the song ‘I Want You’. Sherlock started dancing with his hips flowing from side to side, his arms raised in the air to John he was the most seductive man in the world. The song played:
John’s eyes flashed open, a panicked look staring back at Sherlock. Then the unthinkable happened, John’s chest started to burn as he breathed in more frantically.
As John sat at the window of his favorite coffee shop he noticed a crowd of people started to gather around the building, like moths to a flame. The sky went dark, the crowd of people started screaming which caused John's stomach to curl.
Tears started to fill John’s eyes as they returned back to normal. John brought his hands to Sherlock’s face and questioned, “Sherlock?”
Sherlock’s face was white with foam around his mouth, his eyes were glazed over and looking straight through John, to him John wasn’t there. John had pulled a bloody syringe out of Sherlock’s arm he could feel all the scars that had been made by previous uses.
“Чуо сам да сте некада давно били овисник”
Before Sherlock could even attempt to break free a blow was delivered to his ribs by the screaming man with a led pipe another hit was administered to the other side of his body without hesitation. Blood started to leak over Sherlock’s lips and onto the floor one after another the hits were delivered until he was on the edge of passing out from the pain.
Sherlock could hear the opening of Come Together by The Beatles fill the flat. Sherlock smiled, tucked away his Sinatra record back with his other 60’s style records and went to the living room .
“The cabbie recognized our famous detective friend and began asking him,” John stood up straight and did his best Sherlock impression “incredibly ignorant questions that makes the world even less bearable to live in just by the fact that those questions have been breathed into its atmosphere.”
“Have you got him dear?” She asked and was answered by another “yes” and the sounds of the creaking stairs whining as Sherlock made his way to John’s room.
Sherlock gazed in awe as he listened to the lyrics of the song John’s face seemed to change with the words a hard expression of “fuck you” slid on and off his face.
Ah, how do you sleep at night’
John looked up at him and kept laughing which caused Sherlock to start a low chuckle too. Sherlock spat into the sink and sank down onto the floor next to John still laughing.
‘So Sgt. Pepper took you by surprise
“Sherlock? Hey, Sherlock? Fucking answer me you bastard!” John slapped Sherlock’s face his only response was Sherlock’s head slightly moving back into position. John pulled out his phone and called Lestrade.
John couldn’t take Sherlock’s teas any longer so he grabbed Sherlock’s back and pulled him into a kiss John placed his hands on Sherlock’s face pushing their lips together. The urge to touch washed over the two.
John leaned back for the toilet and started to laugh.
Both of the men were hungover by morning, when John woke up he jumped out of the bed, ran to the bathroom and threw up in the toilet. When Sherlock woke he had the bitter taste of last night's whiskey clawing at his tongue sending Sherlock running to the bathroom as well.
"No no I'm a doctor let me check!" He argued with the people trying to tell him not to disturb the body. As he fell to his knees next to the man he still wasn't sure if it was Sherlock. John prayed as soon as he felt the man's non-existent pulse that it wasn't his friend. But John's prayers were cut silent as he flipped the body over to assess the damage.
Feel free to leave a comment about this story I wil actually try and finish this one
Sherlock walked to the coat rack and grabbed his jacket “I’m just going to go out,” Sherlock walked towards John whilst pushing his arms through the sleeves of his coat “I’m going to pick up some body parts at the morgue.” He stood right in front of John.
Or I may be asleep’
“Stop what?”
“Is he at it again?” Mrs. Hudson's voice came from the floor below.
‘Please don't be long
“Sherloooock!!”
When Sherlock woke he was greeted by John’s swollen face pressed on the pillow with drool streaming down his face, John had ended up tucking his arms underneath himself in his sleep and flipping half of his body over so that he was facing Sherlock but his legs where away from him. His usually neatly combed back hair had fallen into his face, the sun that peeked through the curtains caught John’s hair in just the right way that his gray locks looked as though they were glowing.
Do do do do do do, oh yeah
“Why the hell did I think that was going to end well?” Sherlock said as he frantically put toothpaste onto his toothbrush and shoved it into his mouth.
Happiness
“Told me what?” Sherlock replayed Slyly
Sherlock slid his hand under the couch and pulled out a cigarette and a matchbox, he dangled the cigarette between his lips and lit it. Taking a long drag of the cigarette he blew the smoke straight up. “Do you want a trip down memory lane? It’s not weed but ‘I’tll du, ey?’”
“I’m fine mother hen.” John said as he struggled to push himself off the bed.
Sherlock check his phone for the time, it was ten o’clock. Before he went undercover to destroy Moriarty’s web he hardly ever needed sleep, but when he was captured the only time he ever got to sleep was when he passed out from the pain. He has accepted that his body was trying to regain everything that it had lost over the two years of capture. He didn’t like thinking about the lonely years away from Baker Street, away from John. When Sherlock came home Mycroft forced him to be fully examined by every sort of doctor in London. Most of them told Sherlock that he needed to keep his body movement to a dormant state for at least a year, but the therapist is the person who he remembers and hates the most.
Once the song ‘Maxwell's Silver Hammer’ came on the two could do nothing but sing and bounce along in their seats.
“Well mummy would only allow us to buy ‘sensible’ records,” Sherlock walked into his bedroom and put the record back into its cover then carried on the conversation shouting out the door to John in the living room. “which unfortunately meant we could only buy music that they listened to.”
(Expect for editing bc it’s already done)
A bloody hand print stained the side of his ivory face, the blood flowed to his neck and underneath his shirt. His heart dropped as he began to panic he threw open the towel cabinet and grabbed as many flannels as possible. He ran back to John and began to frantically search for his injuries.
“What? No why would you think that?” Sherlock was quick to respond.
“Stop that.” Sherlock demand as he sat on his bed with his book.
“What did you see John? Was it me? John?”
“Thanks, oh I got you something too.” John went to the kitchen to fetch the book and handed it to Sherlock.
Please don't you be very long (don't be long)’
“John! John! Wake up you bastard! Don’t leave me! This can’t be real!” Sherlock violently shook John, John’s head rolled on his shoulders lacking any sign of life. Sherlock began to scream as tears rolled down his cheeks. Sherlock got into the bed and pressed his face to John’s chest grabbing a fistful of John’s shirt as he wept.
1993 summer vacation
Sherlock looked behind him in time to see the Serbians man reach up to his purple arm and inject him with heroin Sherlock’s legs went limp with pleasure and his eyes closed tightly and a moan escaped his mouth.
“Slow month actually, what’s his problem?”
Sherlock had tried his hardest to show as little concern as possible, he imagined that he managed it but he truly couldn’t tell.
Sherlock watched as John brought the object to his head it was then that Sherlock realized John had a gun. Sherlock’s eyes widened as he heard John mumble something and then the sound of a gun went off and the T.V. Went black. Sherlock started kicking and screaming bloody murder he couldn’t believe it he was going to throw up he didn’t care what had happened next he didn’t want to exist.
Before Sherlock could make his next deduction Lestrade pulled a officer from outside the door into the room. Lestrade handed him a glove and a  bunch of evidence bags then told the officer to collect all the peace’s that Sherlock points out and label them.
Lying with his eyes while his hands are busy working overtime.
Sherlock’s mind was drifting in and out of consciousness.
What happened that morning played over and over in John’s mind. He thought about what happened, he thought about what could have happened he couldn’t decide if it was the right thing to do.
This was sort of a routine for Sherlock and Mrs. Hudson by now. Every night John would wake the whole flat up with his screaming and every night one of them would go up there. Mrs. Hudson only takes over when Sherlock is in such a deep sleep that he never even hears his friends struggles. But this night for some reason  was worse than any other night.
Sherlock chuckled, a deep rich baritone rumble, “Quite. John, I don’t know what you expect from me. I know that you want sex but I don’t know, um, when I can give that to you… Because of, you know, what happened with Moran and all…”
Sherlock looks at me shyly now and shrugs, a gesture that makes him look far too young and innocent, “Well, last time it made me forget about everything, and the release made my mind go all foggy. It was calming. So maybe it might help get me back on track.”
I nodded, that’s what I had feared. Sherlock had tried to claw the scar off his flesh with his bare hands. I tried to keep the horror off my face trying to keep my mask of calm in place. I began gently rubbing the area of red flesh but Sherlock whimpered and cowered away from my touch.
“Is that why you were jumping up and down a lot when we went to see Spaulding?” I asked, getting Sherlock to relay as many facts as possible in order to put him more at ease.
Seeing my blank look, he lay back tiredly against the headboard of his bed and continued, “He’s one of Moriarty’s most loyal followers, his right hand man. When his master died, he decided to hunt me down and finish the job he started. Although, Moran had a very different method than Moriarty… as you can see.”
I decided not to worry about it and put the kettle on, pondering all that Sherlock had told me and wondering what I could do to help him recover.
Sherlock nodded and sent a message agreeing to the terms, releasing a shaky sigh as he pushed the laptop away. I squeezed his shoulder and we began to turn away from the screen. Suddenly, a new notification made us all turn back:
“Well, you’re right Mr Holmes, I have been typing and it is to some extent why I’m here. Last week, I received an e-mail inviting me to join something called The Red-Headed League. They offered six hundred and fifty pounds a week to do some ministerial work for a few hours every day.”
It just sat there, staring at me with a blank look. I then laughed to myself, “Look at me, I’m talking to a skull!”
I decided that I needed to intervene before he got any more upset so I hastily (albeit somewhat reluctantly) jumped from the bed and crept out into the living room. I peered around the corner and saw Sherlock standing in his blue dressing gown by the mantel piece with his back to me. His movements were sporadic, bordering on violent as his music became increasingly frantic and sinister.
You are all gods of kudos and comments :)
He looked at them and shook his head. Uh oh, this was going to be a problem, “Sherlock? You need to take them so your head won’t hurt anymore.”
Mrs Hudson nodded gravely, “He’s been very jumpy lately, more so than usual. I suppose we’ll just have to wait it out until he tells us what’s going on in that funny head of his.”
“Because it’s a lot to deal with after what happened. You haven’t let yourself go in a long time... maybe everything is catching up to you. But it’s okay to cry and it’s okay to be sad, or happy, or overwhelmed. Just let it out, let yourself feel it and it'll get better. And know that I’m here for you, always,” I pulled him to me and gently eased us back onto the bed, cradling him in my arms.
“Uh, Sherlock?” I began.
Sherlock sat back on the couch shoulder to shoulder with me, seeming even more confused, “But I know that you care for me, so why do I need you to show it?”
I grinned slowly as I realised that Sherlock was congratulating me for violently attacking Moran. Suddenly, the whole situation seemed completely ridiculous. Maybe it was the lingering high from the painkillers or the adrenaline from wailing on Moran, but I found myself clinging to Sherlock’s arm and giggling like a child.
“You okay?” I gasped, blowing air over the hot crown of his frankly gorgeous penis.
I leaned in with a roll of my eyes, “It’s a thing that couples do… play footsie under the table.”
“That photograph you sent got across rather a different message than the one you intended,” Sherlock said. “You really shouldn’t make rash decisions when you’re riding a high of endorphins. It makes you careless enough to send a photo from your personal phone, not your untraceable burner.”
“I will not let him do this to me anymore, John!” he exclaimed, gripping the sink with white knuckles. “I won’t allow it!” He pushed away from the basin and whirled around to face me, punctuating his next words with forceful hand gestures, “I won’t let him ruin what we have built here together!”
“Tender, slow, but slow in a good way, not like Him… this is, gentle, considerate… oh!”
I noticed a tiny smile come to his lips as he obviously found what he was looking for, before thanking Spaulding and crossing the road. I followed silently as Sherlock strode to the next block before standing on the corner and gazing around.
“You know full well what happened and I don’t want to discuss it further,” Sherlock grumbled over his shoulder as he stripped his jacket and shirt.
I rested my forehead against his and we sat together quietly until the hush was broken by the ping of a notification from the laptop. We pulled away and met each other’s eyes, tenderness being replaced by cool resolve. We got to out feet and donned our coats, Sherlock looking up the address on his phone. We exchanged a nod of determination before leaving the sanctuary of 221B.
“No, ‘m fine…” I protested weakly, “Where’s Sherlock?”
Just as I was about to drag myself out of bed, concerned that something had happened to Sherlock (even though the logical part of my brain said that was highly unlikely), the door of the bedroom creaked open and the man himself appeared. He was wearing a pair of sleep trousers and a dressing gown, with a slightly wild case of bed hair. He was also carrying a tray with a mug of tea, a plate of toast, and what looked to be an entire pharmacy’s worth of medication with an accompanying glass of water.
“Why were you being moved?” I asked in the same hushed tone.
As I leaned back, Sherlock tensed up and his face turned a deathly white. His eyes widened and his breathing came in short sharp gasps, “Sherlock? What is it? What’s wrong?”
“That may not be enough!” I cried. “I won’t let you put him in danger like that!”
A deep, manic giggle suddenly filled the air.
Alarm bells started going off now in my brain, not that they weren’t before but they were dampened by the fuzzy arousal and desire I was feeling for the man writhing on top of me. I moved a hand to still his hips and moved the other to his face, “Sherlock, stop. Tell me what’s wrong so that I can give you what you need.”
Sherlock strode forwards out of Scotland Yard to hail a cab. As we waited I asked him what he made of Wilson’s peculiar circumstances.
“Together,” I repeated, squeezing his hand.
“Why do you care about me?”
“Hey Harry,” I greeted as I squeezed her back. Harry held onto me for a long time, her golden brown curls tickling my nose. Eventually I said, “Okay, now it’s becoming hard to breathe…”
I chuckled, bringing the hand that stopped me to my lips and pressing a kiss to it, “Flatterer!”
