Dior bobs his head in understanding, a small frown occupying his face, “That must be very stressful.”
But Crowley isn’t here today. In his stead, Gérard reigns and he is one disgusting fucker.
Dr. Sunders talks him through it. Her voice a weird, lukewarm balm to the iciness he always feels creeping up during the internal checkups.
A feeling of warmth traveled up his spine, making him give a visible full-bodied shiver, all of his muscles suddenly relaxed. Jesus, that had felt amazing. He couldn’t remember the last time he’d felt so… cosy? Fuck, what the hell. Dior barely knew the meaning of the word, let alone how it

in slightly less than an hour.
at night.
“Dior, your turn,” she says and walks back inside, leaving the door open for him.
The world could go up in flames in that moment and the Prince would. Not. Care.
He rejected him and Dior was moronic enough to let his body trick itself into thinking that Cas was his- was his-
He gave the alpha a small bow in response and watched him disappear from his sight. The quiet that followed his departure didn’t last long before he heard Alastair’s abhorrent voice calling out for him to come over, like some sort of damn house dog. Alastair roughly grabbed his shoulder and led him down to the carriage, not wasting a single moment after the door closed and pounced on the omega.
He gulps. Maybe he’s developed some fucked-up sense of self-worth because he suddenly feels like all eyes are on him, stealing glances with the minutest of movement of eyeballs. The smells are muted here - nowhere near as encompassing as they were in the market square - but he’s pretty sure he can still distinguish at least a couple of alphas.
Relief washes through him when the crowd starts getting thicker, scents upon scents becoming indistinguishable between each other. The next corner he takes, the bustle seems to explode, people no longer walking in lines to get to a destination, but going around in circles, shoulder bumping into shoulder, voices raising on top of each other in order to be heard over the general frenzy.
He's early.
The only times he had been able to determine someone’s emotions through scent alone was whenever a family member was feeling something in a powerful way.
Maybe if he doesn’t move she’ll think him dead and leave and-
“All of them,” Caesar confirms.
They all turned their gaze to the side - except Dior, as the Princess still had him in a death hold - when someone cleared their throat loudly, obviously meant to attract their attention. He didn’t need to see who it was, for the scent was enough to make him want to whine out loud. His relief was tangible as the smell of honey washed over his whole being, coating his dread and smoothing it over in absolute sanctuary. There was a twang to the musky, old book smell now, a deep layer of mold entwining with it. It should’ve made Dior afraid since such a scent change meant the alpha was annoyed at best and angry at worst. Instead, he felt overjoyed that the alpha cared enough to exhibit this behaviour for his sake.

Cain sighed and rolled his wine inside his glass, looking very put off. “Yes, me. Unfortunately, it appears my fading from high society this past year has insinuated to some of my business competitors, and other noble families, that my influence has fallen. They have become quite bold in their actions, if not plain foolish.” He continued, “My associates have informed me that I must correct this and the simplest way would be to host an extravagant party of my own. Flaunt my wealth like some kind of peacock. Preparations have been going on for the better part of last month. Everything is ready except for one thing…”
. What he had thought was whiskey was actually pecan - how could he make such a mistake? This person was all warmth and comfort folded in layers of yearning.
“You do not smell like us, anymore,” Cas’ voice carries over to him, small and pained.
Cas surprises him by dropping to his knees and tangling his hand with his. Dior scoots closer to the edge without meaning to, as if the alpha’s body is a beacon to be answered. The small contact sends shivers down his spine and he can almost feel the surge of contentment building.
Dior starts to feel sick the moment his eyes deglaze enough to realise that Castiel looks
Castiel can feel himself getting agitated, souring honey reaching his own nose, but he cannot help it. Perhaps Dior’s physician has not been clear enough when diagnosing him- otherwise how could Dior be so nonchalant about them?
“How are the preparations for your departure to Paris going, Castiel? Is everything in place?” Michael asked him, cutting into a sausage but not looking at him.
“Did you mean it?” he asks.
“You’ll what,

He sniffs only to realise - to his horror - that there’s mucus dripping from his nose down his lips all the way to his chin. He catches a whiff of alpha musk and whips his head around to his other side, surprised to be met with the
Dior feels, rather than sees, her rolling her eyes. “Of course, Dior. You’re so selfish you don’t wake up an hour before everyone, prepare the bath, the food and make sure we’re up in time. How vile of you!”
“No - they’re just things that were put upon me. It’s different,” he replies, “And if selling them means I can help? I’ll be glad to be rid of them.”
“No, I don’t think so. I’d need to find a babysitter and I don’t feel comfortable doing that.” Castiel shook his head. They reached the elevator and he pushed the buttons for both of their floors. “Jack and I will stay home and watch cartoons.”.

Castiel almost sputtered. “I beg your pardon? You were worried about my

Even through his stupor, it’s impossible for him not to react and
“Headaches are not very serious, Dior. Migraines on the other hand - they can be dangerous,” the prince tells the omega. He thinks of Anna’s migraines and how she would be in constant agony for as long as weeks, about how they cause her to be bedridden a lot of time and render her powerless.
The last button pops free and suddenly, there’s long, athletic arms around his neck. For a deranged second, Castiel wants to close his eyes and lean in. He wants to bend his head and lay small attentions to the sharp jaw, wants to give and give
“I will tell you I did not realise such a shade of pale existed.”
Lisa closes her eyes and resumes her earlier position again, “Okay. I’m sorry, Dior.”
The prince starts to feel out of his depth - he had never flirted with anyone before. What is the proper step to take next? Does he flirt back?
The journey to The Arc is nothing short of peaceful. The carriage has a special set of wheels which diminishes the amount of movement they can feel from the inside, making it pleasant for conversation.
Caesar makes a considering noise at the back of his throat, “I’m sure. To be honest, it feels like for once, it’s the man making the cloth and not the other way around.”
Castiel can feel himself getting agitated at the words, his scent cloying into something musty. Balthazar and Princess Margot must have noticed this, since he is seated in-between the two. Balt discreetly touches his elbow and Meg shifts herself from facing them to facing the Russian alpha in a touching moment of solidarity. He inhales cherry wine and firewood, willing himself to relax.

“That sounds agreeable. Thank you, Alfie.” Castiel got out of the bath just as Alfie rounded around the corner. He dried himself with a towel, draped his dressing gown around him, and proceeded to the sink to brush his teeth. He was very fond of this new creation. A ‘toothbrush’ they called it. It was a welcome change to the twig they had to use up until a few years back. Finishing with his oral care, he headed to where Alfie was arranging his outfit neatly on the bed.
“I can see that. Your instructions were very clear and easy to understand.” The Prince smiled, a soft gesture, which forced a similar one from Dior himself. “I am afraid I do not attend enough social events back home to have needed this knowledge.”
“Yes?” Castiel says, more a question than fact, unsure of what is the right thing to say.

Dean was laughing as he recounted a tale from a few weeks ago to Eileen when he suddenly stopped dead in his story. He looked over to the bar, taking in the slowly dying crowd of drunks around them. Cas was nowhere to be seen, and that realization felt like a buckle of cold water over Dean's skin. They had split when coming back into the bar, Cas having needed a quick stop at the restroom. But that was a good fifteen minutes ago now, and Dean's stomach was beginning to twist. He flagged Nick over to them, ignoring the questioning stare Sam was sending his way. Adrenaline threatened to pump into his veins, but he tried to keep himself calm until he confirmed his fears.
Dean stepped aside then and let Gabriel pass, who strolled right up to the bed, no hesitation other than to tap his hand on Jack’s shoulder as he passed. Gabriel ran his hand above Cas’s body, a similar motion to what Dean had seen Cas do a hundred times with them. Dean held his breath until he saw Cas’s chest rise and fall once slowly, evenly.
Dean flipped his shocked look back to Chuck, who just shrugged and said, “I’m God, remember. Just think of it as a wedding gift. But like Cinderella, the party stops at midnight.” Dean nodded, feeling almost numb, completely dumbfounded by the turn of events. And there he’d been, thinking that getting married would be the wildest thing to happen to him today. What had he been thinking? His name was Dean Winchester, after all.
“Dean,” Cas started slowly, as if Dean was the one who’s mental facilities needed checking, “why are you green?”
But just a half step before the door, Jody held her hand out, signaling him to stop where he was, pulling her body back against the wall just outside Cas’s door. Years of hunting had trained him to copy her actions without question, but once they were pressed arm to arm against the wall he leaned his head down in a whisper, “What are we doing?” She instantly pressed a finger to her lips and signaled for him to take a quick look and listen to what was happening in the room. Sam felt a rush of hope, wondering if she had seen Cas awake or something had changed since he had left them alone. But that hope was quickly replaced with quickly growing familiar sensation of sorrow heavy in his chest as he craned his neck to sneak a look into the room.
Sam stood loudly, bringing attention to the fact that Dean was grinning like an idiot, the weight of their secret having been finally lifted. “I’m happy for you guys, really.” Sam grabbed his paper, heading back out of the kitchen to give them some privacy. “I swear though, soundproof your room. I have guns, I will use them.” Dean stood, his brother already forgotten, heading toward Cas to plant the deepest kiss he possibly could in his new freedom.
“Damn!” Dean exclaimed, bending down to grab something from the floor next to the bed. Cas saw a needle in his hand when his face came back level with his own. “That’s gonna need stitches. And it won’t be pleasant, Cas.” Dean set the needle down on top of the stack of clean towels before looking frustratedly toward Cas’s offending collarbone. Realizing the position they were both in didn’t leave much room for Dean to work, he quickly sat up further and turned toward Dean, swinging his feet over the edge of the bed, his knees knocking into Dean’s. The man looked as if he were about to stop him but Cas shot him a look that he hoped told him he could manage and not one that said he might just throw up from the pain of it.
Waiting for the moment that would never come.
Sam laughed out loud at the absurdity. “Dean! You’d think you’d at least know if he’s any good. You’re the one
“Dean. How did you..” Cas broke off as pain assaulted his features and he gripped his side.
“You know that you are able to manifest your wings corporeally, don’t you?” Cas actually looked shocked and Dean tried to not show his immediate embarrassment. He hadn’t known that, but then again, it had only been a few months since he had died. He couldn’t be too hard on himself. “At least I assume that you are able. Angels have the ability to do so when necessary, leaving me to assume you would have the same capability.”
Dean looked over to Sam, terrified of what he would see. He almost laughed at the comically shocked look that seemed to be stuck on Sam’s features. But the would have required Dean to find the situation amusing and not embarrassing. He went back to the table, keeping his hands wrapped around his mug to keep from hiding his face behind them.
“Three minutes.”
“It is not in the traditional human definition of the word, but my brother’s assertion is accurate. I can already feel my grace growing to create another angel.” There was a sort of peace that came over his features that Dean didn’t understand. Why would he feel peaceful when heaven was making him their bitch?
“Cas, you’re kinda killing the mood.” Dean tried to pull Cas back in, but the angel pulled away. “Really, Cas? Is now the time to talk about our feelings?”
Sam watched as Dean finally lost it altogether and laid his head against Cas’s chest. Sam watched as his brother’s shoulders shook, and he wanted nothing more than to find a way out of this. He wanted to save everyone from the inevitable. But he knew they were all lost, just waiting out the few minutes they had left.
Chuck seemed to wait for him to take it, and Dean even nudged him lightly, but he didn’t move. He just stared at what was being offered, his mind reeling at the possibilities. The safety and security that grace could offer them. Hell, even just a fully functioning leg would be nice. But suddenly, he knew his answer to the unspoken question. He didn’t even need to think twice.
, Sam felt himself tense up, preparing for the worst. The brothers waited, with Dean pacing again in the same way he had on the day they first found Cas collapsed. Sam had no idea what to do, though he took comfort in the odd feeling of familiarity he felt in being alone by his brother’s side.
“Need air. Can’t be here.” Dean felt his chest tighten again. His knees hurt too. Pain again. Why? They were on their knees, had they fallen? He realized he was still mumbling over and over again. He heard sobs and Cas’s name in his ears but somehow also far away. Was he suffocating? Was that why he couldn’t find the air? But words were gone again. Just like the air. Where was the air?
“I don’t think these things are fitting in the shower, Cas.” He thought about it for a moment. “You said ‘partner’? Will you help, Cas?”
He could hardly breathe as they paused, just for a beat of their hearts to survey one another. Dean looked unhinged before Cas, a wild and desperate look in his bright green eyes. His chest was damp from sweat, and his hair was the most out of place that Cas had ever seen it. Cas felt his cock twitch as he realized that Dean was just as affected by their actions as he was. He couldn’t process the sexiness of the hunter before him in the midst of it all, he could only feel how much he needed his hands back on Dean’s skin.
Eileen had already started following Sam when Dean turned to chase after them. Sam ran out to the backseat of Baby, his long legs making it hard for Dean to keep up. He would normally curse Sam’s speed, but Dean knew his brother was working it out. They all came to a hard stop as Sam pulled out some papers and spread them across the trunk. Nick was outside with them too, and they anxiously waited for Sam to explain what he was looking for.
Sam would sometimes give them privacy by sitting outside the room, knowing full well that he also needed the space. He was running low on hope and he just couldn’t keep living through Dean’s blind devotion. Sometimes he would read while he waited for the change that never came, sometimes he would video chat with Eileen. He wanted to keep her involved in the whole process, but it was hard enough not knowing where he fit into the puzzle.
Dean near constantly stood by his side (when he wasn't being manhandled) during the remainder of the party, reintroducing him to every person he could, a look a pride on his face that stole Cas’s breath when he looked at it for too long. He would never get tired of seeing Dean this happy. He hadn’t yet had a chance in all the crazy happiness around him to speak with his new in-laws, but Dean seemed eager to remedy that.
Dean felt his hunter training kick in, calming his nerves with the ability to shut off everything nonessential to the hunt. Emotions got people,
Gabriel nodded, a bit of humor in eyes, though his face was still dark. “In human terms, he’s pregnant.” Dean shook his head in response, staying quiet as he tried to process it all.
The reception was dying down now, everyone having been zapped back instantly into the bunker’s war room, which was now covered in beautiful decorations. Music still played loudly, Charlie and Sam were dancing in the middle of the room, just a tad over the line into drunk. Dean sat off to the side, chatting quietly with his mother and father. Cas smiled softly at the sight. They were the last two left around from Chuck’s gift, midnight having come just a little while ago.
Cas straightened back up just as Dean caught up with him. Confusion crinkled his face as he watched Cas close the door, bag in hand. Dean caught the bag when Cas threw it over his shoulder, heading toward the front of Baby. Dean was hit with a wave of lust as he watched Cas place his hands firmly on Baby’s hood, planting his feet shoulder-width apart. Dean instantly understood what Cas was offering, and while it made him hard and aching for Cas, Dean was struck by an opportunity he couldn’t pass up.
Cas still couldn’t wrap his head around it all. The last few hours were a blur, a happy but fast stream of pictures in his mind. They had spent a good thirty seconds lip-locked when Chuck had given the go-ahead, both breaking apart with laughter when Sam called out to tell them he’d need a dose of eye bleach if they kept going. Cas had again witnessed a blush creep across Dean’s cheeks when he had implied Sam would need to stay away from the bunker for a while if he knew what was good for him.
“Yeah, Cas?” Dean didn’t elaborate, knowing the angel would understand him. He always seemed to when even Dean didn’t understand himself.
Dean tried to rebut with, “Sammy, he’s human
Sam pulled himself back to the present, looking back to Dean’s face, noticing for the first time that night that the hours had not been easy on his brother. The stone was gone, replaced now by an unhinged wildness in Dean’s eyes. Sam knew that look, the one that Dean wore when he wanted to know where to point his gun and shoot. But they both knew there was no monster this time, just the cruelty of human life between Dean and his angel-turned-hunter.
Cas’s head swam from the new pain. “How do you do it, Dean?” He spat the words between his clenched teeth. A tear leaked past the corner of his eye and down his left cheek, stinging another cut on his jawbone.
Until his head slammed down into the pillow in response to Cas’s fingers grazing the base of his left wing, just above where it met his back. He tried to swallow the groan that threatened to force itself out of his throat, clenching his teeth. He felt Cas’s fingers hesitate before beginning to move slowly outwards, gentle as a whisper. This time he let the moan out, all pretense forgotten.
Zephaniel was born on a boring Tuesday morning. Dean had been a complete wreck the entire time, which hadn’t surprised Sam in the slightest. Throughout the entire four-month ‘pregnancy’, Dean had waited on Cas hand and foot, constantly checking on him and demanding that he let Dean do everything to keep him comfortable. Sam had thought Dean was going overboard a bit, but then again, how many of them had experience with Angel pregnancy? They had all been flying by the seat of their pants.
“Really, Dean?” Sam couldn’t have put more sarcasm into those two words if he had tried. “Don’t act like you don’t know. It’s one thing when we’re on the road and you bring a waitress, bartender, or whatever back to the hotel; we share a room and all, so I deal with it. But come on!” Sam rolled his eyes so hard Dean seriously wondered if they would pop right out of his skull. “We don’t even share a wall and I was stuck up all night listening to you moan. Dude, it’s not right.” Sam glared before looking back down at his paper, luckily giving Dean time to try to come up with some way to hide the blush that had spread so quickly that Dean swore his ears were on fire.
It may have been only a minute or two later when the doctor nodded gently before giving them the space they needed, but Sam really wasn’t sure of his time-keeping skills anymore. He watched as his brother went back to sit beside Cas, silent again after all the commotion. He watched as Dean took Cas’s hand in his, drawing small circles on the back of Cas’s hand with his thumb. Sam sat back down in his chair, waiting and watching.
Cas froze, towel over his eyes, as he felt Dean’s hand on his wrist. He lowered the towel enough to look into Dean’s eyes, a smile playing across the hunter’s features. In one hand he held another towel, unsoiled and left over from the night before; in the other hand, a mouthwatering burger. He held it out to Cas and whispered, “Eat. I’ll take care of your hair.” Cas took the burger, lowering the damp towel to sit wrapped around his waist, letting him feel the illusion of cover.  He attempted to eat slowly, though the aching in his stomach urged him to shove the entire burger in his mouth all at once.
"Family?" He gulps
"Yeah, you can go faster" he nods his head and starts to speed his thrust up. The pain fades and is replaced with pleasure. He thrust directly into my prostate and I instantly start to feel myself growing closer. Dean snakes his hand on to my cock and starts to jerk me off.
"Belphegor, you are crazy there is no way Prince dean is more attractive than Sam Winchester."
Deans POV
"I understand you want a promotion to sailsman but you have to earn it."
"Yeah. I-um I think I'm going to go lay down" I stand up and walk towards the door
"I got the book you asked for. You know you are a real chick" He takes the book and playfully swats my arm with it.
"Yeah coincidence. Maybe lucifer got into their heads and drove them a little coco" I look back down at the papers that I was reading before cas came in.
Cas POV
"I'm a adult dad. I don't have to go to your stupid lunch if I don't want too." He steps forward and looks me in the eye
"It's all good. I'm sorry for my behavior last night as well as also not saying some not so-nice things" He starts walking towards his side of the bed.
"Lord Winchester? It is time to wake up. May I come in?"she said in a soft tone. I rubbed my eyes and look at the clock on the wall. It reads 8:02. I don't know about you but that is pretty early.
"Whatever, you still have to meet him. I expect you at 7:00 pm we are having dinner with the Shurleys. You better behave" He says his peace and then leaves. I'm sitting on my bed debating if I want to go meet Castiel and his family. I decide not to because I will meet them tonight at dinner.
"he called me a man-whore" I muttered like  child
Deans POV
"Aww leaving so soon dean I was hoping to get to know you, I mean we are family now" I turn around and see lucifers red eyes train on me
"Lucifer. How are you here?"
Castiel walks up to me so we are completely face to face
"Can't a father ask his son to hang out and talk? he takes a sip of his drink
When I got to my room I looked At my wall clock and it read 9:30.It was only 9:30?! Oh my god that diner lasted only 2 and a half hours.It felt like 15 hours . I showered and changed and went to bed. Think about Castiel and how I was going to spend my life with him.
"Oh my god Cas are you alright?" I look at him and nod with tearful eyes.
I took him outside behind the castle, there I saw some servents hanging out there and staring at me and alistair. I walk past them into the forest behind the castle.
"I got it, Gabriel" Gabriel let's go of his hand and gives him the side eye.
Anyways I would like to schedule a meeting so we can discuss ways to make peace. If you would be so kind to at least consider meeting me.
Next day
"There ya go, you look nice" he says smiling
"I'm Castiel" I said as I shook his hand. When I told him my name I saw a hint of recognition in his eyes.
Dean surges up and starts to kiss my neck. At this point he is fully awake. I moan as I feel him stroke the tip of my cock.
"hannah"
"Uh, yeah" he turns off the light and climbs into the other side of the bed and faces away from me. I lay down and blow out the candle that is on my bed side table and I close my eyes  into a dreamless sleep.
I was in my study when there is a knock at the door.
"If you say I told you so I swear when I get out of here you will be the first I kill"  Mark held his hands in surrender
"About?" he looks at the cover
"Do I look like a meat suit to you?"
I opened the letter with my expectations low due to the hate mail that we have gotten from hell in the past,But I have never gotten any letters from John winchester except when he sent me a letter telling me that King Henry(johns father) saying that he was taking over hell and taking his place as king.
Cas POV
Once I get back to my room. I take off my shoes and lay down on the bed.
"I wanted to invite you two to have lunch with me and your brother in the dinning room"
"Okay. Tell him I'm coming. Just let me go bring this to cas" I point at the book in my hand. He bows  his head and walks out of the room. I get up and start walking to cas and I's bedroom. When I open the door to our room I'm greeted by the sight of Cas sitting next to the fireplace. At this angle his face has a healthy glow despite the fact that he is always in doors. He looks up at me with his vibrant blue eyes. still blue, still Castiel.
"Excuse me for a minute ,mon amour" he says before walking towards me
"I want you, do you want me" I whisper in his ear. He lets out a low moan as I keep grinding on him
"Do you want me to turn off the light?"
"hello dean." He walks over to me to give me a hug and a kiss on the cheek.
" Castiel? It's time to go get ready" A maid said
"Dad's right. It's getting late and Cas needs you right now."  Oh my god. Cas! I run out of the room as fast as I could before acknowledge Sam's statement. I run over to me and cas's side of the castle bumping into a few maids and butlers on the way. When I get to the door I hesitate before going in. I mentally prepare myself for what awaits behind the door.
"Hey, I don't mean no harm. I'm just saying from personal experience. Virgin angels are delicious and loud. I remember one time I-" I punch him in the face before he can say anything else. I may dislike angels but I would never stand for anyone who talked like this.
"I'm proud of you." He looks at me with pride and sadness and walks to his seat.
"Hello Castiel, How are you?" He says in a totally causal voice
I walk to the end of the hall. Once I'm there I feel around the wall until I find the brick that pushes in and opens up a secret door to a stairwell. I walk don the stair until I see a door that leads to the dungeon. I walk through the dungeon until I get to the end of the hall where there are 2 guards standing
I hear the door open behind me and I hear a voice.
"You are going to move into the Winchesters a week before the wedding. and we are leaving tomorrow morning so we can get settled in and then we will have dinner with the Winchesters."
"Hey , woah dad ,where are you going all dressed up?" Dean says
" I only have one brother"
I wince when I start to walk over to the bathroom. I started to blush a little at the memory of last night. I turn on the shower and wait for it to warm up.  I look over at my jewelry box. I know the morning after pills are in there waiting to be used. I'm silently debating with myself on whether to take them or not. I know John has been breathing down Dean's neck for an heir but on the other hand I'm just not ready for a child. I open the box and pull out a pill and grab a glass of water and swallow it.
"Get out and let me get ready in peace" I say.
"Why do you care? What do you want?" I say in a cold voice
"Hello. Can I help you?" I asked in a polite tone. He may just be lost and looking for directions
"SHIT!"  Alastair curses. I scream as loud as I can for help when he takes his hand away from my mouth. I feel a sharp pain to my jaw line and another to my lower abdomen.
I close my eyes and succumb into darkness
"Actually I have never heard of you. I try not to associate myself with lower rank guard demons"
It was actually pretty easy to avoid the them. I went out with my friends during the day and I partied at night. I had only seen Castiel once while I was moving some stuff into our new room. When he looked at me I put my head down and he just left the room.
There is smut in the chapter but if you don’t like that then you don’t have to read it. There are references to what they did but it isn’t crucial to the plot. I put * at the smut start and end points
"Oh really? I thought you married my brother so technically that makes us brothers in law"
I peek inside the room and I hear the shower turn off. I'll be in and out. He doesn't have to know I was here.
"Ok, let's go to sleep" I tighten my arms around him to try and protect him from whatever is going on in his mind right now.
Third POV
"I mean it, Winchester."
What do I think about dean? Well nothing really, probably because he DIDN'T TALK THE WHOLE ENTIRE TIME! Other than like 3 words, unless you count stuttering. I know I wasn't any better than him at the talking part, I have heard about the Demon Dean Winchester always speaks his mind and always flirts with everyone even if he gets turned down. Maybe he was drunk or high. Or maybe he was nervous as well. I mean I was so nervous the only thing keeping me from puking or passing out was the fact that would draw attention to me and right now I already have enough attention on me. One thing that really stood out to me were his eyes. I mean woah...those eyes were the most beautiful shade of green I have ever seen. It was like a mixture of forest green and granny smith green.
"Castiel. I need you to calm down , I told you that there is no other way"
"I would like to say goodbye to my father first, please"
"Oh god no, he goes way down into the pit. We just have him up here for maintenance. you know just to make sure everything is working correctly and to clean the cage"
"Well I live in hell and so do you so. Ta da" He motions around himself
"So...I heard you got married... to an angel. Angels are such pretty things. I bet he is a screamer just like the others I've tortured." He says with a stupid grin on his face. I clench my fists
"Nothing. You just seem happy" I look at him and look around
Deans POV
"I was just going to read and then go train"Cas says.
"Hey dean."
I look back at him and smirk "No, what?"
Deans POV
" You think this is bad. You should see the other guy. Dudes eyes will be swollen shut for at least a week" he looks at me with a ' are you joking right now' face " I'm fine. So My knuckles and face got bruised big deal."
When my father passed I got the kingdom ,of course. His dying wish was for me to win this war and make the angels our slaves and I've been trying to do that but it's harder than he made it look. Angels are stronger than demons ,but not as strategic ,demons have been topside more than angels have been so it was easier for the demons to ambush the angels ,but like I said those angels were strong as hell.
I don't know what to do. He barely leaves our room and when he does he gets so paranoid that alistair is gonna show up and hurt him again. He always looks around and gets scared when someone walks too close to him or looks at him weirdly. He won't let me cuddle him ever since he elbowed me in the ribs in his sleep. We were moving in the right direction before the incident now I feel we are just moving backwards at a fast pace.
"Well I'm gonna go change in the bathroom and you can change out here" I don't wait for him to respond and I grab my pjs and head to the bathroom.
Crowely bowed his head and left me and the angel alone. The angel had blonde hair and cloudy blue eyes and had little cuts on his face,but the rest of his body was fine aside from his dirty cloths.
Thorne room:
"there is nothing we can do" He smiles sadly at me. I sigh and put my head in my hand. I feel a hand on my back  I look up and over at dean. Put's his hand on my head and moves it so it lays on his shoulders
"So lets get to it then" he said
"What? I was just asking." he said putting his hands up defensively.
"Your punishment for stealing was guarding the cage. Yeah it sounds so bad"
"Y-Your highness" the one with light blonde hair bows down. He hits the other one on the arm to do the same.
"Enter!" I see Cas's head pop through the door and I immediately smile at him
"Do you need help?" He points towards the necklace in my hands
"Mr. Winchester with all due respect. Dean and I aren't ready for children. Don't you think it's a little early to start thinking about this?"
"Don't lie." he sighs and puts his glass down
"I need you to fly to hell and deliver this to John Winchester."I said
"No sir, he said the it was urgent"
"Good. Plus it'll be fun to spend time with your family." He turns around and leaves.
" I don't remember asking if you wanted to go or not"
I handed him a fresh pair of cloths and a first aid kit.
Now all I need to do is send it."Donna!"I yelled and around 5 minutes later a blonde women comes in"Yes my lord?" she says "I need you to send this letter to heaven ASAP."
"Dean, I'm not ready to talk about"
"I was looking for Cas so I could give him this book on gardening because he wanted to plant some flowers. I was walking to where he asked me to meet him and when I couldn't find him I called his name. About 10 seconds later I hear him call to me for help then a couple seconds later a pained yelp coming from the green house. I ran into the greenhouse and I saw alastair strandling cas from behind.I pulled him off of Cas and he stood up to face me. I told him to get out then he said 'or what you gonna fight me' I pulled out my gun and I told him to leave and he did then-"
And that just flat out sucks.
"His name is Castiel Shurley. He is 19."
"oh well your getting married and get this to an angel" sam said
"Oh..... Great.the angels are here. Yay"I say sarcastically.
"I'll go get Crowley"  Gerald ran away to go get him.
I laid down in my bed thinking about that awful dinner. I mean I have and my fair share of awkward and boring dinners, but this one takes the cake.
"Of course ,brotha" Benny says . We talk and order some food and drinks. Of course I don't order and alcohol because I have dinner with some important people.
"Let's just say that's not an option" he says in a low voice. Just as I am about to ask him what that means I hear the doors open.
I walk into Cas and I room at around 2:00 in the morning. I don't see Cas in the bed sleeping, Which is weird considering how when I usually come home around 12:00. He is usually knocked out with a book right next to him.
I woke up to light knocking on my door and a soft female voice
"What did he say?" he looks at me with a blank expression.
"For what?"
"NO! You said that I would never have to worry about that.You said that if I decided to get married that it would be my choice to whomever I marry!" I say starting to yell. He was about to talk, but I cut him off.
"Dumah!" I shouted
"Hey Cas" he said
" I said in law, not full brothers but its the thought that counts" He grins at me
"Can one of you go get me someone who does know about this cage."
"Sam, don't" dad said in a warning tone
"Yeah, we should" He says in a breathless voice.
" I wanted to talk to you about last night." he says still standing behind me. very closely I might add.
Third POV
"Hey I just want to bring you lunch. I assume you were hungry since you weren't at breakfast" I stand up to wrap my arms around his waist and I give him a kiss on the cheek
"Oh please dean I'm old but I'm not clueless, anyways you can't put if not getting to know him forever and sex is a way to move things along"
Cas POV
"Fine. I feel uncomfortable having sex with a child" I gaped at him
"C'mon cas I'm your brother, I'm-"
"Well ,Cassie the kids these days call it 'the morning after pill' it took me a second to understand what he was saying until I finally understood what he was talking about
"Dean. I would like you to meet the Shurleys. This is chuck" The other older man looked up from his plate and nodded his head " This is Gabriel" The golden haired boy grinned and waved." and this is Castiel" He pointed to the black haired boy. He looked up with piercing blue eyes. I mean I have seen my fair share of blue eyes, but his eyes were one of a kind. But I could see from the expression on his face that he was just as sad to be in this situation as I was. Maybe even more.
"Ok, well I'm gonna go. I'll uh see you later I guess." he is halfway to the door when I speak up
Damn, I wasn't even close. Ehhh its not like i was going to have a relationship with this chick. I mean there is no point in having a relationship and settling down. It's just not how I roll. I live the motto 'hit em and quit em' Love just leads to 3 things heartbreak, drama and stress. Like I said there is no point.
"hey! What makes you think that I did something?"
"You're right." he releases his arms and looks at me. I look into his beautiful baby blue eyes for a moment. While he stares back at me. Then he breaks eye contact with me
"Woah, how many of those have you had today?"
I was lacing my combat boats. I had an early morning of training troops and unfortunately my father would have my head if I was late. I am already on thin ice with him. Why? I don't even know. It seem nothing is good enough for him. But alas that's just John Winchester stubborn ,mean, judgmental and a bunch of other "wonderful" qualities.
" we have to go soon" I say when I finish putting on my shirt
"Dean, dean you know I hate angels, I didn't mean any real harm" I look down at him in his eyes and put my finger on the trigger.
"Thank you, Gabriel"
My thoughts are interrupted by the sound of my brother yelling at by the sound of his tone ,my dad.
I was woken up by my stupid brother yelling in my ear. Saying something about me getting hitched and all that. I got up and brushed my teeth and got in the shower. While I was in the shower, I started to think about my future and this marriage arrangement. Were me and dean going to see other people. Would we be a real couple. Do I have to sleep with him on our wedding night? Oh god I hope not. Ugggggghhhh this is so complicated. I stopped thinking before I started crying. Even though that's what I did  most of last night or at least until I fell asleep. I step out of the shower and put on my clothes . While I'm brushing my teeth I hear my chambers door open.
" A smart choice? I have heard of this Dean Winchester.All he does is eat, sleep and hook up with everyone. Cas, let's not forget the fact that he hates and I mean HATES angels.He won't treat you with any respect, he won't be faithful, hell he might even make you his slave or worse his fuck toy!"
"Let me get one thing straight her Winchester. You better listen because I will NOT say it again. You don't have to love me, hell you don't even have to like me" he points a finger at my chest and stands up on he tippy toes so he can look me in the eyes " but you will respect me. Because to me you are just a puny ass demon that I could wipe off this planet with the snap of my fingers. So don't aggravate me."
"great, I'm a full grown adult who still gets bossed around by his father." I mutter before making my way to the bathroom to get ready.
I was sitting in my throne room reading over the war stats when all of a sudden the doors flew open revealing a small blonde hair blues eyes angel .
Chucks POV
"Excuse me?" I say raising my eyebrows
"We should stop" I pant. But dean continues
"Don't you think-" I stand up and walk over to him
A couple minutes later I dose off to the rhythmic beating of his heart.
In demon law there is a rule "He who crosses must pay if chosen to" which basically mean if you try a hurt what's mine then I hurt you back harder. In this case Cas is my spouse in the eyes of the law he is mine and alistair tried to take him in the most violating way so I take what's his: his life. In hell people who are born demons mate for life. By mate I don't mean bite on the neck, I mean marriage and inside marking (sex without condoms). Now cas and I haven't done the sex part but we are still married.
"Hello Castiel"
" I don't understand " I said cocking my head to the side
I was at the cafe waiting for John I was early so I had time to order a coffee. Around ten minutes later I saw a demon dressed in a black expensive suit. He looked around and when he saw me he walked over and he held out his hand for me to shake, I shook it and told him to sit down.
I was so wrapped up in my thoughts, I didn't hear the bathroom door open.
"Dad your kind of scaring me. What's going on" I said in a nervous tone
"You mean like.. me being your vessel?"
"Cas, you feel so good" I hear him gasp into my neck. He thrust into me one more time. Which is enough I send me over the edge.
Gerald shook his head
Then I went to go find castiel.
"You ready?" He says with a sad look in his eyes
"But it's mine" I start walking towards the door. I feel my dads hand on my shoulder
It's been years going around in circles . Ambush after ambush.Not only was I tired of it but I just plain out bored .So I decided enough was enough. I was going to do something regardless of what my fathers wishes were. This wasn't his fight any more, it's mine so his dead ass can stick it where the sun don't shine.
"Just going to finish up some business before bed. Don't wait up."
"Thank you. Now Cassie doesn't have to live in fear of him anymore" He picks up alistair and slings him over his shoulder almost like he weighs nothing, sometimes even I forget he is an archangel
"No. No I can't. Do you know why? Because I'm getting married to an angel and not just any angel I guess. I assume that this angel is chuck's kid if he even has one."
Deans POV
"You are a criminal, a murderer. All those demons, angels, even human are dead because of you and your lack of self control. I had friends who died trying to take you down. Friends who you killed. You may be my brother but you are not my family!" for a split second there is a look on his face that I can't place. It's a look between regret and sadness. Then his eyes flash red and he looks at me with anger
"Castiel" I look around and I see nobody
"You smell like cheap perfume and sex." I turn around and I see Castiel leaning against the door way. He isn't wrong, I do reek of Lisa.
"Oh,thank-"she flew away from me before I could finish thanking her. Man,those friggin angels were all work and no play.
" I am 19 fucking years old dean. I am not a child."
"Take it or leave it, dean." John says in a stern voice
"Please,what?" He adds another finger and keeps brushing against my prostate.
"You can't kill me, it's against the law" His breathing starts to get heavier
"I-" Lucifer cuts him off
"No, You can't sleep in here, not after you just slept with someone else."
Deans POV
I grab a towel and venture my way into the shower.
Deans POV
"Why are you reading about the cage?"
"I don't need to. I shoot you with this, you're done for. Now for the last time. Get lost."  I see alastair leave the green house. After a couple seconds to make sure he is gone Sam lowers his gun and puts it back in his coat pocket and run to me
I woke up to and empty bed. I sat up and looked over to Dean's side to see that he was gone. I rolled over to his side to see a note on the night stand
I look in the mirror and tighten my tie .I hear the door open, I look to see who it is and it's my father
"-Marrying me off" I cut him and he nods" You didn't think that I deserved a say in this? I'm a big boy I should get a say in who the hell I get to marry!"
Around an hour later crowley entered the throne room with a small bloody angel.
After a couple minutes of making out I break the kiss to catch my breath. Dean starts sucking on my neck.
"Please, I don't want to talk about it."I say putting my head in my hands
"Why would people sell their souls, when they could have a amazing afterlife in heaven?"
"One sec sweetheart "I said to Cassie as I got up and  walked out of the room
"Hey, you ok?" I wipe the tear that slid down my cheek.
"Thanks. So what did you want to see me about" He chuckles and sits down on the throne
He gets up quick and punches me back. I recover quick and I grab his shoulders and keep them in place while I knee him in the stomach.  he holds his stomach as he drops to the ground. I grab him by the collar and look him in the eye.
"Dean murdering someone takes a toll on your mental health" I'm starting to lose my patience with him getting in my way. I have every right to do what I'm about to do to that sack of shit that hurt Cas.
"Hey, those are mine" I said pointing to the cookies.
"Fine." I said curtly, I wasn't in the mode for small talk I had a long day, it was late and I want to go to bed.
"the classic murderers, rapist, pedophiles, homophobes, racists, dirty politicians"
Later that night...
"I know that's his tenth time singing stairway to heaven in the last hour" Gerald responded.
"Continue"I said
"Welp,sir we got ourselves an angel.I think that his name is Samandrial."
"I-I don't understand, your selling me off?" I say on the verge of tears
" I'm not a guard demon. This is my punishment for stealing"
"Naomi she is black mailing me. She is saying that if I don't join her then she will kill me"
After Cas leaves I feel more at ease. Me and Cas have come to a understanding and I call that progress.
"Don't you have a meeting with you father?"
"I was just walking around I have some time off so I just decided to come down here."
" Castiel. What I meant was I don't want to sleep with you because you inexperienced in that field" I move to the foot of the bed to pick up my cloths.
"Hello, Mr. Winchester.You have a busy day today. You have to finish moving into the East wing.  You have to over look some preparations for the ceremony and you have to get ready for the wedding." I can't believe the wedding is  here already.  I'm not surprised that this week has gone by fast. Due to the fact that this week has been solely based on avoiding the Shurleys.
Things went back to normal. Well as normal as they can get. Me and castiel actually get along pretty well. We get up do our own thing and I stay out later partying. And doing what I always do. The only thing that is different is that I haven't gotten laid since Cas and I got married. It's not that I couldn't get anyone to sleep with me it's just that I thought that it would be disrespectful to Cas if I did. We may have gotten married against our will on short notice but I still have to respect the vow I took.
"This is your fault belphegor if you hadn't tried to steal from the kitchen then we wouldn't be on guard duty for this stupid cage." Gerald pointed at belphegor
" well dean you kinda are." I roll my eyes.
"No. He didn't do anything nor am I on anything. I'm just in a good mood. Is that so bad?" He start to study me. Which is odd because I feel like I'm under a microscope. He then gasps and points at me
Garth waved at me and ran over to me
"Yeah well, there were a lot of people at the party and may I say some people were getting down and dirty right there in the crowd so that's why." I can literally see his face change from neutral to angry.
"That would take to long,Cas. Heaven and Hell don't have that kind of time,I'm sorry but this is happening."
"Dean-"Charlie starts but I cut her off
"I came to tell you that it's time for the ceremony to start. Sam is waiting for you by the door so he can walk you down to the alter." I look at myself once more and I sigh. This is it. The rest of my life starts soon. I thought to myself. I walk out of the room and walk down the hall and I find Sammy playing with the cuff of his sleeve. When he looks up, he looks at me and smiles
"Castiel." He murmurs, I smile at the fear in his voice
"Dean, sit down next to Castiel." I nod and walk over to the sit next to Castiel. He hasn't looked at me ever since I walked in he is just staring at his plate. We sit in silence Until Gabriel breaks the silence.
"I bet I could turn this rough month into a good one" she grins at me I take my arm out of her grip and point to my wedding ring
"Bullshit! You slept with someone else. You know I'm fine with you partying, drinking even getting high. But I cross the line at cheating."
"Hey sorry I'm late just lost track of time." I see Sam burst through the door.
"Sure, that would be appreciated" I hand him the necklace and I turn around towards the mirror that is on the dresser. I see dean open the clasp of the necklace and put his arms over my head so he could put on the necklace. He closes the clasps and put his hands down.
"Mr. Winchester. Dean and I have been married for a month. We barely know each other. Just give us sometime to bond and get to know each other before we throw a child into this." I say in a very calm tone.
"Okay....Why" I say afraid of the answer
"Other than listening to your...interesting conversations. I wanted to inspect the cage. Which one of you knows the most about it?"   They both looked at eachother
"Please, I bet it will be at least 2 months. I mean one of them hates angel and is very stubborn the other hates demons and is a total stuck up prude. Id be surprised if they even start liking each other in 3 months let alone 2."
"You can't harm me it's against the law, it would make the whole marriage treaty void and restart the war" Gabriel leans down looking him in the eyes
From,King John Winchester of hell.
"Whatever" I said while going to the cabinet to get a glass
"Anyway you said that John Winchester sent me a letter?"
Dean waits about a minute or so before pulling out softly until just his tip remains. He slowly thrust back in. I'm sure he can tell by my face that I'm a little uncomfortable.
"I love you, Gabe" I say squeezing him tightly.
"I can't even with you right now." Then I stood up and walked out of the room. When I got out of the room. My face was frozen and everything was blurry. I felt like I was about to puke from the news I just got. How could he do this to me. I just basically saw my freedom disappear. First I was shackled to my family and now I will be shackled to some dude who I'm supposed to marry. This is crazy and I don't want to spend anymore time thinking about it.
About 10 minutes later dean comes back in.
"Yes sir" Donna said ,then she exited
"yes sir , here you go"Samandrial handed the letter to chuck.
Garth is a scrawny little dude and way too nice to be a demon if you ask me. The dude once started tearing up when he accidently stepped on a caterpillar.
"Oh your still awake I thought you'd be asleep by the time I got back" dean says while untying his boots
"We don't have to do anything tonight" I say breaking the silence
I spit out my tooth paste and turn towards in and say "Oh, Hello Dean" I say. We stand there awkwardly for a few seconds , then he decides to speak.
Deans POV
" Is it possible for him to talk to people-" Before I could finish, belphegor interrupts me
"I'm fine, I mean I guess this is for the best for the kingdom."I say lying through my teeth.
"Good foods here." I hear dean say. I smile at him and pick up my fork and start eating
I stood there frozen as I tried to process the information that I had just received. After a couple seconds I start to smile and laugh my ass off. After a couple minutes of uncontrolled laughter. I finally compose myself so I can say something.
"Ok. I want him back down asap. I don't him causing anymore trouble"
"From who?" I asked curiously I mean I don't want to send a letter to chuck ,when he doesnt even want peace.
"I know about you deano. You sleep with anything that breathes and then you leave and never call them. You get into a bunch of fights especially when you are drunk. Which I'm sure you are drunk like 70% of the time. I know that due to your mom passing you are afraid of commitment. But let me make myself clear. If you ever and I mean EVER cause my brother any pain or strife, I will smite you. That is not a threat, it is a promise." He says in a serious tone and judging by  his nick name" the trickster" I'm sure that this is one of the times that he is not joking. Before I can respond he leaves with my cookies and a glass of milk .
"I don't see your name on it. "He said sticking his tongue out at me
"I know Gabe" I say starting to tear up
"Thank you" It's like he new what I was talking about because I feel his arms tighten around me and whispers a soft "You're welcome" we stand like that for a few minutes until he pulls back and looks in my eyes
I fall asleep thinking about dean. I don't really know him and some part of me wants to get to know him, but there is also this part of me that doesn't, and that part of me keeps reminding me that I am being forced to be here. I am here as a band aid. I am merely a solution to the problem of the war.
"Anymore?" he looks at me with a curious look
"The cage is the highest piece of security ever. It hols lucifer in by all the warding and is coated with holy oil and much more"
"The cage." that's weird the cage is like the most boring thing ever
" By racist things you mean things against angels right?"
"There he is" Lucifer said to one of the guards, named Mark
"I think we need to talk about lunch" dean says in a serious tone
"Are you saying no?"  As soon as I said this the guard came over unlocked him from the wall but kept his chains on, he then gave me the keys and goes back to his post. I yank alistair out of the cell and down the hall.
"What about a peace treaty?" I say more calmly
Later that night....
"C'mon we are running out of time just let me in until I can get back to my old vessel"
"Ughhhhhhhh. What is it?" I say half asleep.
"Good, now i need you to clean yourself up with this."
I gasp when dean rolls us over so that he is on top. He tugs off my sleeping pants and reaches over to the nightstand drawer for the lube.
" You distracted me." I said pointing to him
Castiels POV
"How do you think I am, Sam, Huh? I'm getting married to a stuck up angel. Oh and not just any angel. a prince of heaven"
"It's possible, unless it's in its usual spot then he can't bother anyone"
"but one of our captives probably do"
"Get away from him"
Cas relaxed as he chewed and Dean massaged the towel through his hair. He lied and told himself that the silence was pleasant, that no unspoken words hung between them. But he knew the truth, and it hurt worse than the bruised rib in his side. So he stayed quiet, chewing his burger, telling himself over and over that their friendship would survive this.
Dean slid the ring onto Cas’s finger, not surprised that it fit like it was made to be there. Dean repeated the words as Chuck spoke the final promises they would share before everyone they loved. “Castiel, with this ring, I promise to stand beside you, your equal, your lover, and your friend, in everything that life has left to throw at us. I may not always say the right words, but when the sun goes down each night, know that you will never be alone. You are my reason for waking up in the morning, and I will strive every day to return to you the happiness you have given me.” The hunter tried to make a mental note to thank Chuck later, he couldn’t have said it any better.
Writing this story has been a whirlwind of crazy. This is my first finished fic, as well as my first Bang as an author. It all started when I first saw the piece and my brain wouldn't stop trying to write the story, no matter the fact that I hadn't even participated in claims yet! Good thing I got the piece I wanted, huh? It's a rush to have finally been able to finish something, but it also almost makes me sad to see it all go. I may have to write some scenes that I didn't choose to write for this, either due to time or because I thought the story arc didn't fit well with them. Maybe I will, who knows.
“His grace.” Jack seemed to be lost as he stared at his adopted father’s motionless form. Dean tried to keep quiet, but he was itching to snap at the boy. “It’s like his grace is too much for his vessel.” Jack looked stuck by the thought, a sadness Dean felt himself deep in his chest. “I don’t understand.”
Hands braced behind him, Cas’s jaw hung lax and his head tilted back as Dean pressed his palm over the bulge in Cas’s boxers. Dean only teased for a moment, just a tiny part of his mind staying aware of their position, a whisper in his brain reminding him that they could be discovered at any time. He snaked his fingers back under the fabric, pulling both layers down to Cas’s mid-thigh. A wicked grin spread across Dean’s lips as he released Cas’s cock from his underwear. There was no doubt in his mind that he would never tire of the man before him.
“So, get this.” Sam stood in Dean’s (and by extension for the last three and a half years, Cas’s) doorway, waiting for him to pause what they had playing on his tv. Dean hit a button on the remote, earning a glare from Cas, who had been completely enthralled in the screen. Sam smiled at the sight of them tangled in the bed, pizza box half empty, completely relaxed for once.
Dean folded into his brother’s chest, sobbing, gasping, aching and crying for it to stop. Feeling himself fall apart as his world was slowly unplugged, one tube at a time.
The doctor frowned, and Sam held his breath, waiting for what he had felt they would hear all along. “He isn’t out of the woods yet. We were able to successfully stop the bleeding, but another hemorrhage occurred. The trauma of both bleeds has placed your husband in a coma.” The doctor’s eyes were sad as he spoke, showing how much he must hate this part of his job.
“Of course, Dean.” Cas looked out the windshield, not able to look at Dean as his fears became reality. “It has been obvious to me since waking this morning. You were gone before I woke, and when you returned, you did not mention what happened. I-” Cas broke off as he heard Dean laugh from the driver’s seat. He dared to look, which gifted him with the sight of one of the most beautiful smiles he had ever seen on Dean’s face. He was just lost as to what had caused it. “Dean, why are you laughing?”
That was when Dean’s heart stopped for a full three seconds. He couldn’t think. He almost couldn’t breathe. Owed all to the fact that Cas was standing there on stage, not only singing Led
And that was when Sammy bust into the room.
Cas jogged enticingly away from him, throwing a lustful glance over his shoulder. Dean tried to steady himself by walking slower, but of course, that gave him a nice view of Cas’s ass, both a blessing and a curse. Especially given that Cas was now bent over in the backseat, searching for their special ‘go bag’ that they kept stowed under the seat for occasions when desperate need hit them while away from the bunker.
Sam spoke next, which reminded Dean that Sam and Jack were even in the room at all. “Wouldn’t that make another Nephilim, not an angel?” Dean nodded in agreement, but Gabriel shook his head as he wiggled his eyebrows in Dean’s direction.
“You got three minutes of chick flick before I call it quits. Go on.” Dean steadied himself, expecting the worst, realizing then just how terrified he was that Sam wouldn’t be supportive of their choices. But he knew somewhere in the back of his mind that it was just his lack of self-esteem talking, so he tried to brush it away.
Nick nodded and led them off to the side, away from nosy ears and eyes. “So, basically, the last three weeks, all the winners ended up dead. The police are stumped. Nothing else connects them. I figure it’s probably something here. Maybe it’s your type of thing.”
Cas titled his head, a slight frown on his lips. Dean flinched slightly as Cas rolled his shoulders back and large, dark emerald green wings materialized behind Cas. They shimmered in the soft lighting of his room, looking almost pearlescent when the light hit them just the right way. Dean stared, taking a step forward, feeling the urge to sink his fingers into Cas’s feathers.
Cas took a moment to breathe and to wallow in his self-pity. This life wasn’t one that he was cut out for. Being human had made him so weak; he would just be a burden to the brothers if he tried to stay around. He sighed, knowing that last night had been a mistake. He had enjoyed it, more than Dean would ever know, but therein was his problem. There was no doubt in his mind that Dean had woken with regret after their actions the night before; the fact that Dean had snuck out before he woke was proof enough on its own.
