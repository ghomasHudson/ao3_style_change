. And certainly something they needed to solve.
Overcome with a new wave of emotions, Dean had to look back down at the book so Cas’ gaze wouldn’t burn him. Wouldn’t lead him to do something tremendously stupid… like kiss the guy in front of his entire family.
It was Rebecca who opened the door for him this time, and once more he was sent to the back porch.
Despite the fact that Dean knew they tried to divert the attention, it was still nice to hear the sincerity in their voices. They really
He knew they had, he had seen some of them. Still, in fact, remembering his run-in with Krissy and Ava in particular. Had they been drinking after all?
It was around the time George Bailey rejected Potter’s offer of becoming his assistant that Dean’s thoughts were interrupted by Cas clearing his throat. He shifted, turning somewhat so he was looking toward Dean. Right away, Cas had his attention… his
Dean sighed and ran a frustrated hand through his hair as he crossed the road toward
some ways out of town, after all. Gracie even had her own room up here, in case Dean had to travel for a school camp or some related instance and Bobby would look after her for those few nights. Sam and Eileen had a room just for them as well and even kept a few of their things here.
There were so many questions rattling in his brain that Dean decided to finally, once and for all, get some clarity on the few he could do alone.
However, the cold seemed to take its toll on Cas, and Dean was thankful when they made it to the top. Soon enough, he would get Cas where it was warm and where he could get help.
“Alright, fine,” Dean gave in easily, closing his eyes as he enjoyed the feeling of Cas’ lips on his skin. He was definitely looking forward to feeling those lips all over him for the rest of his life. “We’ll order something then.”
Cas moved a bit, probably to get a better look at him and the confused frown on his face and this cute head tilt he always did, told Dean that he wasn’t quite following him. Huffing out a little laugh – because yeah, that explanation had been weird – Dean moved so he was able to sit down next to Cas. As he pulled him into his embrace he was mindful of the cast, which Cas rested gently on Dean’s chest, away from the water. Absentmindedly, he let his hand move up and down Cas’ back as he tried to sort his thoughts so he could explain this in a way that would make sense.
! Fucking fantastic!
Certainly not ...
A little red light bobbing up and down in the darkness, as if it was in motion, gave Dean plenty of warning that someone was coming his way. Knowing that they were close to the slope, he tamed Cherry’s gallop to a trot and then a walk.
My heartfelt Thank You goes out to all of you, my dear readers
Dean stopped his thoughts right then and there. He really shouldn’t think that way.
“So what if I did?” she finally asked back, thankfully keeping her voice low as well. “Why do you care so much for that man? You even let your daughter sit with him all day every day. Don’t you know what people are saying?”
“Shut up,” he ordered, his hands already roaming over Dean’s body. “Don’t you dare apologize. We have all the time in the world.” His lips were so close to Dean’s ear as he promised him this, the dark voice, the hot breath against his skin, the implication itself… the implication of ‘forever’... it all made Dean shiver. “And if you’ll never be comfortable with it, then that’s alright as well,” Cas still went on, this time even letting his tongue run over Dean’s earlobe. The shiver running through Dean’s body intensified and he had to wind his arms around Cas’ body to hold him tight.
Instead of replying, Dean let out a bark of laughter and made his way over to the chairs.
Cas shaking in his arms, spilling onto Dean’s stomach only seconds after him.
“Cas?” he asked into the room, lifting his head to check around. He even turned to the other side, his sleepy mind thinking that maybe they had switched sides somehow.
Scoffing at that thought, Dean shook his head. Since Fate was such a bitch lately, he most likely would. He would dream of Cas the night after he had lost him – most likely for forever.
Only when his daughter stopped was he finally able to rip his gaze from Cas, the sudden despair in his daughter’s voice alarming him. Wide-eyed, she looked at Cas, one of her hands clapped over her mouth – her typical tell when she’d said something she shouldn’t have. Before Dean could even ask what was wrong, she went on, speaking to Cas directly. “I’m so sorry. That was supposed to be a secret.” Her head snapped back up at him, her eyes pleading. “Dad, you can’t tell anyone, I promised Castiel.”
“Aww, don’t worry, Micky. I guess you’ll get the spot back when you buy her a car on her sixteenth birthday.”
“Yeah, but it’s pie with you guys.”
“But that’s not even all. I mean… the fact that we’re even allowed to still meet here?” He made a wide gesture around campus where Charlie and he currently occupied a table, far away from everyone else, sharing lunch while Dean studied for his classes and Charlie used the free wifi to work on her codes for one of her programming jobs. “It’s all so…”
Dean didn’t let it deter him, continuing instead as if Cas hadn’t spoken. “And secondly, if that’s true, why did Zar order it?”
“Dean, really! You can’t think like that. You did love Lisa, you still do-“
Right away Cas’ eyes went wide and Dean could see his ears grow red. He threw him a cheeky grin and knocked his knee into Cas’ leg. “Calm down,” he said, keeping his voice low. “I’m just ripping you. I really like how you care for her.”
Cas was silent for a brief while. Long enough for Dean to open his eyes again, noticing that Cas had his eyes closed as well.
“My parents used to call the movie
Gracie’s chatter stopped for just long enough to glance out the window, over to the spot where once the tree had been that had claimed her mother’s life, her hands instinctively moving to check her seatbelt. Alice’s grip tighten on her purse and in the rearview mirror, Dean saw Harry’s hand run through his graying hair. A gesture he knew to be a nervous tic of his.
She was so far from that it wasn’t even funny anymore.
“And you think he wouldn’t want to know how you feel?”
Finishing off a few more pancakes, Dean put the rest of the batter in the fridge and quickly hurried to take a shower. Once he was alone again, his smile fell away, all his thoughts back on Cas not showing up this morning. Which, of course, was completely stupid to even think about. It wasn’t as if they had agreed to meet or anything.
“Cas?”
“Yes, I’m sure,” he interrupted right away, slightly annoyed at whatever Sam had possibly told her. “Tell Uncle Sammy not to tell you stuff like that. You know you can always call me.” He would have to have
“You wouldn’t mind?” came Gracie’s small voice.
He was just taking out his flashlight, hoping it would be easier for Cas to mount Cherry with some light, when he heard Cas speak up.
“Ohh, I think I see him,” he heard Grace’s excited voice–
think I need this kind of spectacle after what I’ve
“Well, would you actually
But… there
. He could respect Cas’ wishes – but he would never let him risk his life.
The grin that spread all over Cas’ face was in equal parts bashful and so, so adorable and Dean could’ve spent hours upon hours just watching him. But when the man leaned against him, snuggling further into his warmth, Dean realized for the first time how inappropriately Cas was dressed for weather like this. The snow had picked up again and it looked like he was wearing nothing more than a thin shirt and some sweatpants underneath his coat.
And Cas would hate him more.
have that talk with Michael after all – it might give him a little bit of insight into his own feelings.
Soon after, Taylor paid them a visit, collecting a grateful thanks from Dean for letting them do this - not that Dean
It was tantalizing.
“Huh?”
All that mattered was that Cas never stopped kissing him, his arms snaking around Dean’s shoulders to draw them together even closer. It was indeed hot. Very hot.
“I get it, Dean. Really.”
Dean wasn’t stupid. He had known her for most of his life and he knew what Lydia wanted from him. A few months ago, he might have considered her as an option. But really, Lydia was not someone he could see a future with. Not that she wasn’t lovely and all, she was nice enough, but Dean knew she could not make him happy.
your old friendship?”
“You’ll have five more minutes to talk about this.”
“Okay. See you later …
Zar might look and sound like a douchebag – but the protectiveness oozed out of him. He genuinely cared for Cas and for his well-being and Dean had an inkling he was only being polite because… well, he actually had no idea why. Dean was pretty sure if the roles had been reversed, he would’ve punched his smug face.
Before he could change his mind or lose his nerves, he folded the letter of recommendation to the correct size and together with the card, put it into the envelope, sealing it shut and after adding Cas’ name, he set it aside. Picking up some of the Christmas wrapping paper, he also wrapped up the DVD, still adamant on handing it to Cas, even if it might just be to make him smile.
When his eyes landed on his friend, he was unable to hide the turmoil of his feelings from Gabe - who, for once, did not joke or even crack a grin. There was nothing but seriousness in his demeanor, for once showing that the guy was, in fact, an adult. And a responsible one at that.
But he also needed to figure out if all this even mattered. Because really, would it make sense to finally have it all sorted out when Cas was so obviously not comfortable in his presence anymore and had a very, very possible boyfriend back in New York?
And holy shit, alright. Dean had definitely found a new turn-on. He couldn’t wait to discover even more with this gorgeous man.
As it was, however, he kissed that smirk off of his boyfriend’s lips, settling for letting the kiss deepen for just a fraction of a minute. They stayed in each other’s embrace a few heartbeats longer, simply basking in the warmth and closeness and this wonderful moment.
The man looked up, right at him and within the next second, Dean could see his face contort into a mask of rage.
It made the ache and the guilt in his own chest all that much more prominent, keeping him from a peaceful sleep that night even though he finally knew that his soulmate wasn’t dead. It was the sensation of more writing on his arm immediately that pulled him from his slumber early in the morning.
“Ohhh, oh, oh, and yesterday,” Charlie babbled on while Dean tried to keep focused on her words, “we went to
“Sorry for this morning, Dad. I shouldn’t have been angry at you.”
“But it’s a book for teenagers and young adults?”
“Okay!” Dean quickly interrupted; because okay, maybe it was a
a crush! I don't have a crush on the guy – I have a
“Last night,” he whispered, “What was that for you?”
Dean wasn’t even done composing his message to Michael by the time his daughter had moved on to the next topic from her list of ‘things to tell her grandparents’ - Dean had seen her making notes in the car.
... why do you make it so hard on all of us???
“Yes, he’s home again. But he’s Castiel James now cause he took his aunt’s name and…”
it. He wanted
“Fiiiiine,” she replied, only a little bit pouty, not enough to make Dean believe she was really annoyed. After all, he did his best to raise her well and she knew this was not a time for reading but for family. Therefore, she put the pages and the card back into the box and then put the lid back on. A moment later, she was back in Cas’ arms, hugging him close as she thanked him over and over again. Making not only Cas smile, but also Dean.
All that kept visible of his name was the first letter and even though Dean had known this would happen, he was still a little disappointed by it.
“Hey, don’t sweat it,” Dean interrupted him. “It’s just five minutes. Give your boxes to Lily, she knows where to put them.”
“Well, it was nice as long as it lasted,” she mumbled, giving him a soft smile.
“Ehm…” he replied, clearing his throat. “I guess?”
Yes, his own feelings were hurt, and yes, maybe he was still mad at Cas in some ways – but it didn’t change the fact that after all this time, after all these years… Cas at least deserved to
“Ahh, ummm...” Cas replied, looking around for a moment as if searching before fixing his gaze on one of the pantries. “Yeah, sure. Probably in here, it’s where we keep stuff like that.”
Dean was too late.
It took a moment for them to get settled, thanks to Cas’ wrist still being in a cast. He could feel Cas’ reluctance as he moved away from where he had sat between Dean’s legs, trying to rest against his chest. Dean was just as reluctant to lose the contact, so he quickly followed and simply settled between Cas’ legs instead, leaning back against his chest and resting his head against Cas’ shoulder. With a content sigh, he let himself settle down, enjoying the feeling of being the little spoon for once in his life.
“We know, Taylor,” Dean could hear Luke yell from somewhere, directly followed by a more excited Babette calling, “Yeah, get on with the program.”
“Oh... well,” Cas replied, looking mildly uncomfortable. And it suddenly occurred to Dean that - since the man had crushed on him majorly once - this was probably not a nice question for him to ask. “Not that I can say, no,” Cas finally explained, making Dean’s heart skip a beat. Quickly though, Cas steered away from that particular topic. “But this movie is the reason for one of my nicknames.”
again-”
This time, Dean had to forcibly bite back any reaction at all. Did Grace… did she really just do what Dean thought she had done? Was she trying to sell Cas as something
“Well, you still have those feelings for him, so… yes,” Sam said bluntly.
The feeling was mutual, to be honest, and Dean simply shrugged his shoulders. “I don’t really care, as long as it isn’t just rabbit food. How about we just order another pizza from Papa John’s?”
“Don’t
He had to take a shaky breath through his mouth, his nose slowly clogging up – and still, he refused to acknowledge the tears in his eyes.
“Fuck,” he whispered at his own reflection. “Fuck, I’m so screwed.”
Some lines were scratched out, others rewritten a few times with different wording, some arrows showed where she wanted to rearrange sequences in the final version – all in order to send away one letter that held exactly what Gracie wanted to say, he was sure of it. But no matter in which way, no matter how rough these pages of a drafted letter were, they were all words written down by his daughter.
“But?” Cas asked, shock clear in his voice.
“Not really. I think we only dozed for a few hours or so.”
“Dean,” he heard Cas try to stop him once more but Dean was on a roll, something inside of him pushing him on, knowing this was his only chance.
Checking his phone again, he had to stop himself from smashing it against the wall when there was still nothing. He was so worried sick he didn’t even know what to do anymore.
didn’t run away…
As was to be expected, the morning went by in an easy-going manner. Maybe he was a bad teacher by openly admitting he had no desire to be doing anything productive either, regardless that their principal insisted they teach to the last minute. But the students in his classes were happy and that’s what was important, at least in his book. They played games and spoke about holiday plans, his senior class even using the time for last minute preparations for the cookie sale that would happen later today. But even with all this fun-time there was no denying everyone was glad to leave the building when the last bell of the day rang.
“I love you too, Sweetie,” he replied. “But I should probably make sure Uncle Sammy is handling the camera right –”
“I guess it’s better we talk about this before we jump into it, right?”
Cas brushed away his comment with a quick, “Of course, that’s not what I meant,” before tilting his head and scrutinizing Dean. “You said you’d only booked a one-way ticket.”
? As Dean
“Dean? What are you doing here?” Cas whispered back. “I thought Lisa’s parents –”
Most importantly, he needed to walk. He needed to get away.
“See you tomorrow, Cas,” he told the man as calmly as he could, forcing himself to follow his daughter once Cas replied with, “Bye, Mr. Winchester.”
had ended, the family came back together for
planned on looking it all up. Thought about it, yes, but more like a side note. Like a stray thought of ‘I could actually do that and maybe find them.’
Air. He needed air and it wasn’t until he was outside that he could feel it fill his lungs again. It was dirty and filled with smoke and exhaust fumes and someone was smoking somewhere nearby and the noises around him were all-consuming and he needed the fresh air from the ranch, he needed to be back in Stars Hollow, he needed the peace and the quiet.
Encouraged by this reaction, Dean decided that it was time for a bold move. Reaching the tip of Cas’ cock, he did not hesitate to take him in his mouth.
“As if you could ever,” one of the girls called and the rest agreed freely, making Dean’s heart warm.
“Just living a fantasy,” Cas replied, still lacking emotion, still quiet though he might as well be screaming for how the words slammed into Dean. “I’ve wanted you for so long, I just couldn’t say no.”
“Lulu just called. She’s sick with the flu, can’t even get out of bed, the poor girl.”
“I know that. But what does that have to do with Cas and you?”
addressing him. “I know you’ve paid for Grace the whole week. It’s my turn now.”
A torture he would willingly submit to if it meant being close to Cas.
Happy Christmas, Merry Christmas, Happy (belated) Hanukkah, Happy Yule, Happy Holidays to all of you, my faithful readers, the new ones and the old. I come bearing gifts 🎅🎁
As his eyes fell on the letter of recommendation, a sudden inspiration struck Dean.
God, everybody knew she was him in miniature, in almost every aspect. So if Dean - at almost forty years old - still mourned the loss of his mother, then so would Gracie with her own.
Simple, and yet, they did so much to Dean. He had just turned eighteen and knowing stories of people who had to wait some years before their counterpart would turn of age as well, he had never put much hope into getting in contact with his soulmate right this very day.
“And how real can that be when really… I loved Cas all along?”
“I’m not –” Dean started, only to realize that he would not be able to keep his voice down in this conversation. He finally gave in, unwound his arms, and started to sign.
“Oh, you did not just say that,” Dean replied, pretending to take offense. He knew, after all, that Cas was just teasing - but no one,
Instantly, relief washed over him. Before he could reply, however, he heard the crunching of snow under shoes, the shadowy figure quickly moving away from him.
“Ehm, care to enlighten us?”
“It hurts.”
And speaking of schoolboys… he wasn’t quick enough to steer clear of the group of students that seemed to materialize out of thin air – though, by the looks of it, they had occupied that space for quite a while, their table littered with sweets and soft drinks.
Krissy’s dramatic pause did not help that impression at all.
Really, how could he argue with her logic? He was still surprised though; why had she felt the need to write her favorite author in the first place? Finally, he began studying the papers again, reading the words his daughter had entrusted him with.
Ignoring Charlie, Dean spoke to Jo as if his crazy friend wasn’t even in the picture. “Yeah, she was awesome. I’m so proud of her.”
“God, I don’t know.”
Beaming up at him, Gracie finally untangled herself from him, focus shifting to the parcel in her own hand. Dragons safely resting in his lap, Dean watched as she began ripping away the wrapping paper. The moment the first part of the gift became visible, she gasped in excitement.
And still, the man wouldn’t even look at him and Dean couldn’t bear it anymore. Not knowing what possessed him, he reached for Cas’ chin, keeping his touch soft. He didn’t want to hurt Cas, but he needed answers. Carefully but with purpose, he turned Cas’ head, making sure he had no other choice but to look at him.
“I know that, Dad,” she told him, smiling at him. Right away though, she became serious again. “Okay, so it’s okay for me to keep a secret from you. But… what if you ask me directly? Like you just did? I told you no - which was obviously a lie. And… it’s a difference to keep a secret and to lie, right?”
He knew he was delirious but he didn’t care. He was so close from opening his mouth and just declaring Cas his undying love – when one particular stroke did him in.
“Alright, pumpkin. Time for bed for you.”
“Wait, the house is the other way.”
The image disappeared quickly enough, leaving him with mixed feelings. On the one hand, he felt content and happy. On the other, there was a sad feeling inside of him. He was longing for something that might not be within his reach anymore…
got his attention - because Alice hardly ever swore. Looking up at her, he could see a fire in her eyes. The same fire that used to be in Lisa’s when he was being a stubborn idiot.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yes, but why is the fact that it’s a YA book a negative criteria for you?”
But as he looked up at them, at his family, that voice was silenced before it could even set root. Because Dean knew, he knew without a shadow of a doubt that, for them, it didn’t matter how much he loved Cas - or how much he could come to love him.
When Cas stumbled again, Dean once more reached for him but the only good it did him was for Cas to once again try to increase the space between them. Fucking hell!
Yeah, certainly something he wouldn’t put past the man.
He also knew that Gracie hadn’t been able to throw out the old set of stationary and instead used it for short-term notes.
supposed to think, right? It was all a bit hazy between those noises Cas elicited from him and his hard cock being paid so much attention after so long, combined with all the new sensations.
He knew it would be hard – but he would survive one night without Cas in his arms.
Dean had done the most terrible thing he could have done.
Stopping Cherry’s movement fully, Dean turned around in the saddle, looking after the shadowy figure that was quickly swallowed by the darkness. He tried to ignore the sadness that was spreading within him, the way each
A tiny seed of hope festered inside his chest and he loosened his grip around Cas’ arm.
Until Dean had hung up and really let the information sink in.
“Alright, fine, fine. I’ll shut up. Should we go now?”
“Cas, hang on, I’m coming.”
“Meh,” Dean replied. “It wasn’t too bad. And I needed something to save the seats.” However, he had to admit he was quite glad to be back in his coat. Clapping Bobby on his shoulder in greeting, he sat down on Sam’s other side, settling in to wait for Taylor’s speech.
She was already at the door, Dean’s hand about to land on her shoulder to guide his daughter inside, when she twirled back around to Cas. “Ohhh, do you think …” She held up her book, something she usually did when trying really hard to keep herself from continuing.
“It will all be alright,” he had told him – like an all-knowing God who had already seen how this story would end. “You’ll see, Dean. Just have a little faith.”
“We were already wondering how you didn’t freeze up there,” his sister-in-law told him with a scolding tone, reaching out to correct his lapel and patting him on the chest when it was all set. “It’s not like you were working so hard that it was keeping you warm.”
“Dean, you’re staring again.”
Dean nodded. “Glowed like a shooting star.”
Cas didn’t reply, not right away. Instead, Dean watched as he looked at the letter again and Dean was sure that only now, he really focused on what he held in his hand. The movement of his eyes was slower, more focused on every single line, instead of flicking around to understand what Dean had gifted him. Watching him so closely, it was easy for Dean to see the moment Cas’ eyes began to well up, if only a little bit. Not enough to actually cry but enough to show Dean just how touched he was.
“Michael–”
“A pie,” Cas replied, grinning at him - a grin that warmed him and spurred those butterflies back into action. With his newfound revelations, Dean was ashamed to admit those butterflies had been there years ago as well, only he hadn’t acknowledged them back then. He was so thrown by that, it took him a moment to catch the rest of Cas’ words. “We thought it would be nice to share some of our winnings with you.”
Dean’s mind supplied an image of Cas’ handsome face, his smile, and all of a sudden, Dean was gasping, his orgasm hitting him without any warning.
3:45 am
Oh, the lies he had told himself in order to deflect and repress.
For now, though, he leaned in closer again, hesitantly, not wanting to push his luck, not quite catching Cas’ lips.
Trying to get them in a more comfortable position, Dean bent his knee. But it only resulted in jostling them and Dean was reminded of the mess between them. Before he could offer to get up and grab a towel, Cas was already leaning back, forcing Dean to drop his arms once more.
“Stop that, Lydia. Stop with your stupid games,” he hissed, still not wanting to draw all that much attention. “You know what I mean.” When all she did was to keep silent and press her lips together, he went on. “You saw that Cas saw us, didn’t you? So you just had to be all over me.”
It had probably been stupid that he’d let his friendship with Cas suffer because of this. Most of the town knew of their closeness anyway, and the rest of them at least knew that Dean and Michael were best friends. Still, when the time came, Dean had put away Cas’ nickname and called him by his full name for the first time in his life.
It was such a wonderful feeling.
Thankfully, Cas seemed in no rush to pull away from him, his hands buried in the lapel of Dean’s coat, holding Dean just as close.
It took a few seconds before Cas spoke once more, a simple “Thank you, Zar,” all he said.
Dean didn’t need to think about that before he nodded. “I’ve been falling for them for years now, yes.”
Cas shook his head, looking profoundly confused. “What?”
“Dad, do you think he’ll like the Angel Cookies we made?”
“Sam, what do you want me to say? That I feel guilty as hell for what happened to Cas? Because I feel like all this is my fault? That I’m hurt by how cold he is towards me but that I understand? That I hate myself for what I did all these years ago?”
“Here,” his daughter said, holding out another cookie for Cas, as if it was a peace-offering. “Please, you have to tell me if it tastes just as good as your family’s.”
It didn’t take much to stop and turn him around, which Dean made sure to do gently, not letting his anger get the better of him. Cas followed his lead like a rag doll, absolutely no power left in him it seemed.
“Shut up,” he mumbled, refusing to look up at his best friend.
“Because this is my
“He’s been successful then? Since he… left?” Alice asked delicately.
He should’ve kept moving the second Emma was gone, but he wasn’t quick enough. Obviously, he also wasn’t paying all that much attention right now or he would have realized
A wide smile formed on Gracie’s face and a dreamy sigh left her.
.” Cas’ voice rang through the clear morning air, even faintly echoing, his words rendering Dean speechless. “And I still am. Do you have any idea how painful it is to be back in this town? To
Dean was glad for the little talk they had had but he wasn’t naive enough to believe it had healed Gracie’s aching heart.
“You’re welcome,” Cas replied and Dean almost pinched himself so he wouldn’t stare too hard at the cute little smile the man was wearing.
Dean wanted to smile at them, wanted to tell them how grateful he was, but he wasn’t able to pull it off. So all he did was nod in agreement and then he was out the door and back on the road.
Seeing his best friend like that, Dean really wanted to tease – but Gabe’s comment brought him up short.
If he had thought it was a good idea to say that, Cas’ aunt showed him better. Amara turned around and pinned Dean with a stare that made him swallow. “So?”
Meanwhile, Dean was sitting on his couch, sipping his tea, and grinning about the antics of his friends.
Eileen sighed and shook her head, clearly already fed up with him.
The first thing he noticed when he opened his bedroom door was the darkness that met him, no lights shining into the space from any room. The second thing was the silence that lay over his house. This kind of silence that only an empty space could provide. There was no soft breathing from his daughter’s room, and there was definitely no noise coming from the kitchen or the living room.
it had been so long since Dean had been with another person. But right away, he was engulfed in all the feelings again. The giddiness, the anticipation, the tingle. The need and the want. The pure sensation of euphoria.
“What?!” both brothers exclaimed, very clearly in shock.
“Hold onto her mane,” he heard himself say, unconsciously leaning closer to Cas, his lips almost grazing the shell of his ear. This was bad - so, so bad. He tried to concentrate on his words instead. “This is going to be a bit rough.”
So yes, it hurt that D had had a short fling with someone else… but Cas really couldn’t complain about the result of it. Smiling to himself, he looked at his arm again, even though it was blank now. Remembering the words there that D had written.
“Oh no,” Charlie exclaimed right away. “But you and Gracie –”
to touch Cas in some way. Maybe to poke or tickle him.
But he couldn’t see himself in such a scenario.
... yeah, that happened 😏
“Maybe? Can you think of a way to reply to such an inquiry - coming from me or anyone else?”
His boxer shorts were pulled away and soon after, naked skin touched naked skin, making Dean almost choke on his moan. Dean felt a shiver run through Cas’ entire body but he was almost positive it wasn’t from the cold. Though he couldn’t quite be sure of anything right now. His mind was foggy and there were so many sensations all at once and then there was a hand on his cock. On both of theirs and
“Oh, come on, Mr. Winchester,” Andrew exclaimed, being the first to break this time. “The whole school’s talking about it.”
did something wrong to have Cas run away from her; and I cannot tell her that it is all on him because, despite everything, I don’t want her to think bad of him!”
Since it's Christmas Eve - the time we here in Germany exchange our gifts - I thought it fitting that I hand out a present to you as well 😍
He couldn’t help himself. Hope was rising inside of him, yes… but the argument about sexual orientations seemed like an invalid one in their case.
It was still dark when Dean drifted to reality, his senses slowly waking up. First, he could smell the wonderful fragrance he had come to associate with happiness and feeling warm and content. It wasn’t just the smell that gave him those feels now. As his mind woke up further, he sensed the body next to him and the warmth of a soft bed.
“Happy New Year, Lydia. And say hi to Emma for me.”
of that made sense. He thought everyone in the family loved these cookies?
- to bring a stop to this right away. Because his own feelings about the whole situation were still very much too raw and he feared that any conversation about the topic would bring them back up.
- boyfriend, Dean tried to ignore the conversation still going on. That was until Amara playfully slapped Gabriel’s shoulder.
“If only he would find a nice young man. It really doesn’t do him good to still be crushing on a man that is so unreachable for him.”
“And what would be wrong with that?” Cas asked right away, his tone of voice as well as the squinted eyes challenging Dean.
“You’re kidding?” he asked, continuing once Cas shrugged his shoulders. “Hey, nothing against Harry Potter, but it’s a kids’ book.”
Yet, all in all, Dean was glad when the door to his classroom finally closed for the last time that day and a deep sigh left him as the corridors emptied.
He needed time to internalize all these new revelations. Needed it to not all feel so
“Careful there, Cas,” Dean replied with mock threat in his voice, able to suppress his smile to not ruin the effect.
As Cas pulled him in for another kiss, Dean decided that any further discussion could wait until later.
these feelings, given that they had never met? Sure, they were soulmates, so falling for the other one was the ideal outcome. But Dean had never thought it could happen by simply exchanging words. He certainly had never fallen for one of his friends from just messaging back and forth.
“Exactly,” Dean said, ignoring Alice's obvious inflection, as he hurried across the street, careful not to slip on the ice still hidden by snow. “I’m almost there as well. You two have a lovely start and don’t forget to call us from time to time.”
“That I love you.”
“Right,” he said in her direction, before saluting his students. They seemed to have caught onto… well, whatever it was that was going on, and they gave him questioning looks. “You all have a great start to the New Year. See you in a few days.”
Schooling his features, he turned around and forced himself to smile.
“Wait,” he spoke up, trying to fully let this sink in. “You just gave my daughter your draft?”
“Just…” When his gaze met him again, Dean could detect an ounce of worry in those blue eyes. “
Deep in his head, it took him a moment to notice that Cas seemed just as thoughtful. There were fingers on Dean’s back, drawing lazy patterns, but every now and then, they would still and almost clutch at him. After the third time he caught this movement, Dean gently asked, “What else is on your mind?”
on a loop while he still couldn’t take his eyes away from Cas. When he looked back at him halfway down the stairs, even the confusion in his head calmed down, every fiber of his being just focused on this one man.
. But still. I could meet the cutest guy possible, I could go out with him or hang out – and we still wouldn’t realize it was the other one unless our skin touched at least once and we then messaged each other. Tell me how that’s possible with social distancing.”
“Are you alright, Mr. Winchester?”
Instead, they enjoyed two short, turbulent weeks; until one late evening, Dean couldn’t take it anymore. This nagging inside of him wouldn’t stop. The voice that told him that something was wrong. That while Cassie was amazing, really, she simply wasn’t the one for him.
“Sure.”
. He wanted all those questions and wishes and ideas and confusing feelings - he wanted all of that to just
would always be one of Dean’s favorite movies and he was not ashamed to admit that he was proud of himself for handing down this love for the classics to his daughter. The fact that it would be impossibly late and way after her bedtime by the time they got home was a small price to pay for raising an amazing kid he couldn’t be any prouder of.
Oh shit! He hadn’t meant to say this out loud. He

a geek and Dean simply thought it adorable.
“It will be alright,” she told him and pressed a kiss to his cheek before stepping back to the fence.
decided to ‘come out’. He could already hear the gossip all over town and all the ‘I always knew he was gay’-comments. But he found he didn’t care. Not right now, at least.
Had Cas really reacted to Lydia in such a way?
Surprisingly, it didn’t take much for Dean to get Gracie to bed that night and he had an inkling that his daughter simply wanted the day to be over. He knew the feeling all too well.
Damn Eileen for interrupting his little prepared speech.
He knew he would regret asking, but…
Jo gave him a hard glare. “You wanna play this game and tell us anyway in the end? Or do you want to skip the bullshit and come out right away.”
Cas was beautiful, there was no denying that. And it wasn’t even the first time Dean realized it. He’d known it all these years ago as well. Had always thought of Cas that way, even while still a pit pudgy, wearing nerdy sweaters.
Sweaty and sated, they sank back into each other’s arms, Cas only strong enough to pull the blanket over them before he stretched out his limbs and sprawled over his man, content and happy.
“I… uhm…”
“Na, she’s back at the ranch,” Dean replied, nodding at Lydia in greeting as she came closer. He vehemently kept his focus on Emma after that. “One of our horses got a foal last night and she’s not leaving its side.”
It was enough, however, as Eileen got up right away and moved over to him, pulling him into a hug.
” Charlie replied, grinning like a Cheshire cat. “That’s Portuguese and means thanks.”
Without any preamble, Gracie pulled Eileen to her room so they could get ready together. They wanted to show up at the Shurley’s around noon and apparently, that meant his daughter needed to start getting ready now, about one and a half hours before they needed to leave.
“Just wanted to say, Mr. Winchester… whatever’s going on right now, ehm… I’m glad you’re feeling better again.”
“You know what?” he therefore added before Claire could continue. “Don’t answer that. You told me what the latest gossip is and I think that is enough of that for today. There’s a really good lesson-plan waiting to be-”
“You sure about that?” he asked her with a knowing grin. “Cause I’m positive there are stories right there –” he lightly tapped her forehead, “– stories that want to be told. Be it now or in ten or twenty years. And if it’s only for your own entertainment, then that’s alright as well. But don’t think I don’t know you, my sweet pumpkin pie.”
“I guess she was a bit nervous?”
Gracie quickly rose the three mugs she was carrying. “Sorry,” she said, almost sounding like she actually regretted not having her hands free for a hug.
“Then why did you act like that?” Dean went on, not completely able to switch off his protective dad mode.
between you but just… I don’t know.
“... Uncle Michael told us - Dad, what is it he said?”
“Dad, are you coming?”
His warm release coating his stomach…  Cas’ hand still working, the near overstimulation of his spent cock…
“Night, little pumpkin. Sleep tight.”
After a while, he was finally ready to open his eyes, a dopey smile spreading over his lips as he blinked the sleep away and stretched in the luxurious linen. Cas’ bed was amazing.
While he enjoyed his warm drink and listened to his daughter babbling happily about their snowman, he let his eyes wander. Cas was in deep conversation with Eileen, the two seeming to have bonded. After Eileen’s earlier comment, Dean actually wondered what they were talking about now, yet the thought of Cas getting along with his family still made Dean happy. He couldn’t stop thinking how well he would probably get along with Charlie and Jo as well.
done something wrong. That he hadn’t realized their absence right away. But C had just woken from a coma, they certainly had other things to worry about now. So Dean shoved his guilt aside and instead replied with,
Maybe this was a huge leap.
By now, there was only one present left for Dean to hand out but every time he checked, Cas had been busy with someone else. Sure that now, right after Gracie had exchanged her gift with him, was the best time, Dean was surprised to see Cas get up and leave the room as if fleeing from him once more. But that couldn’t be it, right?
But if that weren’t true...
When he got back to the living room, Eileen was sitting on the couch. Alone.
“Okay? On three. One. Two. Three.”
This was a time to revel in sensation and wonder, and Dean wanted to feel so much more than he already did. Which was why he soon reached for Cas’ belt buckle.
“Of course he did,” Cas replied, chuckling as he handed Dean his pizza.
“So,” Dean spoke up later on when they were in the car, well on their way back to the ranch. “Heard you’ve been keeping secrets from me.”
7 (second half) + 8 + 9 (first half)
But Michael had never been able to say no to Gracie, just like Dean was unable to do so with Michael’s kids. That’s what uncles were for, right?
Dean chuckled but still did as Cas told him. He would always do what his man told him…
It fucking worried Dean even more.
After a few more seconds, Cas seemed to be ready. He hastily wiped his hand clean on the bedding and then reached for the lube again, coating Dean’s cock with it before Dean’s brain had even caught up with the movement. The cool liquid on his overheated flesh had him breathing heavily and he gripped Cas’ hips tight, seeking something to keep him from floating away with all these sensations.
With a wide grin, Cas rolled them back around and quickly took care of Dean’s jeans, pulling them off of him as fast as humanly possible. Crawling back up and over his body, Dean could see the glint in Cas’ eyes as he studied Dean’s face. For what, Dean didn’t know – and in the next second, he also didn’t care anymore because
That Cas might be the
“Stay calm. Good girl.”
Dean had already known he had lost the few extra pounds that had made him look pudgy as a teenager. But seeing him without his thick coat now was different, and the formal dress up certainly became him. He had grown up to be an impressive man and the thought made Dean smile a little. Suddenly, the prospect of an evening in Cas’ close proximity didn’t seem too bad at all anymore. Certainly, they would find some time to finally talk for real, with Dean maybe even being able to apologize.
He was finally filled with bliss again, surrounded by happiness and love that he would never let go of. As their eyes met, Dean knew that Cas not only felt the same but was fully on board with those plans. Their hands met on top of the table, fingers intertwining as if they had done this a thousand times before. And maybe that wasn’t the case yet but Dean would make damn sure that soon it would be.
Smiling at his brother’s comment, Dean stopped the teasing. “I know. But it’s actually not necessary. She … uh … she already found someone.”
He had to close his eyes for a moment, so damn conflicted between his need to be by his family and his very strong wish to never let go of Cas again.
Swallowing hard, Dean sat up. He had a feeling that yesterday’s peace was over. Grace might have been mopey all day and thus hadn’t brought up the topic – but her tone of voice just now told him today would be different.
“God, we always have such shitty timing, I’m telling you.”
Then it finally was time for the winners to be announced. “This year’s first place won with a huge advance over the second place.” Dean suppressed the eye roll. Yeah, so they had a little bit more points than the second place, but did Taylor really have to overdo it that much? “The prize is a $100 gift certificate for
the best of kids and Dean knew he had nothing to worry about. “I’ll call you tomorrow, okay?”
imagine Cas’ face falling. Even more color drained from his cheeks and he looked completely ashen. Something was seriously wrong and his suspicion was only confirmed when Cas put the half-eaten cookie down on the table and pressed out some hasty, mumbled words between clenched teeth.
Ran away from him, just like thirteen years ago.
. When Cas spread his legs even further to give Dean more room between them, Dean had to tame himself to not just rut against him like a horny teenager. Instead, he kept the movement slow, almost lazily, as he let himself all too happily be pulled into another deep kiss. The sweet taste was almost enough to distract him from Cas’ next words.
“Ehhhm, could you be a tad more specific?”
“What?”
, when it should have been
thought that had been a good idea. How he had thought silencing the last shred of reason screaming inside of him would be a

“It’s been a while.”
and the fact that they had been there for a long time…
The picture of her hugging Chuck and their little talk about Gracie’s performance distracted Dean long enough to only realize the magnitude of this moment when he saw Michael and the other Shurley siblings. They waved in hello, but hardly took their eyes off a man that stood right in front of Dean, his back turned towards him. Dean knew who it was without asking, without even having to see his face, and right away, the deafening silence around them registered with Dean, making him stop in his tracks. His heart was speeding up again, without him fully understanding why.
And yet, Dean was to believe Cas didn’t resent him for all this, at least a little bit?
Since he didn’t have a salvage yard around here, he decided on the second best thing and he drove until he found himself at the school’s parking lot, quickly leaving the car and marching over to his classroom. Inside, it was eerily silent. It was late morning by now, and outside he could hear the people already mingling around the streets of Stars Hollow again. But inside the school’s building, he was a lone soul, of course, given the damn fact that it was
“Yes, there certainly are. They are in the kitchen. Let me get them for you.”
Dean gulped, unable to form words. Even if he knew what to say.
His warm shower didn’t really help to get rid of the sour mood and when he accidentally ripped one of his favorite shirts on a nail that was minutely sticking out of the wooden closet, Dean knew it was totally going to be a bad day.
Honestly, Dean dreaded walking over to
Gracie deserved more than that and Cas
Dean must have spoken louder than he thought, for there was a telltale shushing-noise from somewhere behind them. Ducking their heads, Dean was glad to find that Cas was grinning at him, just as he was grinning at Cas. Still, they both sank further into the chairs, keeping quiet for a while.
And then Cas was standing right in front of him. Instantly, the mock seriousness was gone, Dean’s smile back in full force. Cas’ face was red from the cold, his striking blue eyes all the more intense because of it.
“Whoa, girl, whoa,” Dean whispered, urging her to calm down.
Dean tried to swallow but his mouth was too dry. He knew all this, of course. Knew the stories, knew the legends. He had just never thought… had never even considered…
“How is Portugal?”
Slowly, Cas let go of his left hand and held it so Dean could see. He tried to be as gentle as possible but Cas’ wince told him that he wasn’t doing so good. At least Cas kept his hand in place.
Thankfully, Charlie soon had to get back to her apartment to have a quiet environment for a Zoom meeting. It meant she wouldn’t bother him with more questions Dean didn’t have any answers to. With no interest in sitting alone, Dean soon packed up his stuff and followed suit to his own car. Stealing one last glance at Mr. Novak.
“Thanks, ladies. I appreciate it.”
“Ha! Good taste on his part.”
“What do you mean?” Dean asked, momentarily more focused on Cas’ movement and thus not fully able to pick out all that Cas was probably expecting him to see behind that reproach. Damn, if only the guy would finally
Dean saw red. He saw red and… and flashes of a fucking car wreck and a body and… and...
“Good girl,” he whispered as he took the harness, caressing her neck. “Good girl, waiting here for me. You’re getting some extra treats for breakfast, promise.”
“Besides: why would I choose a British snob when my high school teacher that I’ve been crushing on my whole life just confessed his love for me?”
He did register when the talk going on turned towards the snowman contest, but he still didn’t jump in, letting his daughter enjoy the call with her aunts until she had to leave to get ready. After all, she wanted to be at the square in about an hour.
But even with all this, Dean had still somehow hoped Gracie would never find out. Especially since she’d become friends with Cas. Because this was certainly the one question he’d never wanted to hear her ask: “So … is it true? I almost wouldn’t be here? Cas almost prevented me being born?”
“Hello, Dean. I hear Gracie was successful?” she said with a gentle smile, rising up from the couch.
It felt right and amazing and so damn satisfying – emotionally as well as physically – that Dean couldn’t imagine ever wanting anything else. Or anyone else.
Closing his eyes, Dean slowly nodded.
Looking up, Dean was glad to see a badly concealed grin on her lips. At that very moment, it was as if Lisa was sitting right there, teasing him about something he was passionate about - a teasing that was always so full of love, Dean stood no chance at being mad at her. The same spark was in Alice’s eyes now, instantly telling Dean that she was not mad at him - just curious about the situation, and absolutely amused.
“Hhhmm,” Dean replied as if he was really contemplating this. He pulled Cas that little bit closer and rested his chin on his shoulder. “It’s certainly awesome and it inspired probably the greatest movie of all time. But if we stay fair: it
“I think I’m hilarious.”
It was after one-thirty in the morning and still, no news on Cas.
“If that were true… what kind of person would that make me?” he finally murmured, admitting to his brother and sister-in-law what he could hardly admit to himself.
Their gazes locked and they both seemed to search for something – or were simply taking in the other. It was Dean who spoke again first. “I can’t believe it’s you.”
10 (middle part)
Without any fuss, he sat down and took a bite from his pie.
A sling!
. However, he really had no desire to think of his best friend while in bed with said best friend’s little brother. He’d much rather kiss Cas again so he did just that and when Cas opened up to him, he took the invitation and deepened their kiss.
As if he had the time for that, seeing how he had used up every last minute to spend it with Cas. But if Gracie really,
That worry taken care of, it was time to ease the most pressing one.
“Of course, but still. Jane Austen?”
“Alright, young lady,” Dean replied. He always hated having to pretend to reprimand her when she spoke to him like that. In reality, he loved that his daughter had inherited her old man’s snark. “I think it’s bedtime for you soon.” Besides, he was pretty sure Gracie knew how much he was
Dean huffed to himself in disbelief. The fact that he hadn’t even considered the ‘consequences’... He let his easy smile take over again as the implication hit him all at once; still baffled sometimes at realizing again and again how he absolutely didn’t care about what people thought about him and his love life. Or his sexuality, for that matter.
Dean nodded, unable to fathom what all he had just told them. It was all true, of course. But it had also been buried so deep inside of him, he felt left open and raw now that he had laid it all out.
He didn’t need him to elaborate and not wanting to have the mood drop by remembering those few days they both had thought it had been all over, Dean quickly went on. “And thirdly, if you hate Papa John’s so much, why aren’t we ordering from your favorite place?”
By her surprised expression, he could tell this had certainly not been the answer she had expected. Which was probably partly his fault. Not that he had ever encouraged her - but he had also never told her ‘No’ in an outright and straightforward manner.
“Same,” he replied, bringing their conversation to an end.
“I sure think I did,” Alice replied in a chipper voice. “Though we did stray from the topic somewhat.”
“Agreed.”
certainly do,” Gracie spoke up for the first time, sarcasm heavy in her voice. “I fell asleep when I tried to read
“Wait, is that makeup?”
” she greeted them, before giving her dad a kiss on his cheek and then snuggling up on the couch. “How is Spain?”
So yes, it made him sad to know he would soon lose him. Just like Dean could see the underlying sadness in each of the Shurleys.
“Okay, first, while I think your agreement with C is kinda cute and romantic… have you ever thought about these details? Like, at all? How are you supposed to find each other when you don’t ever give someone a chance?” Dean didn’t reply to that, so Charlie went on. “And second, did you realize you just solely talked about meeting a guy? What gives?”
“How about you go for a ride, then? Clear your head. And if Cherry leads you on the path to the Shurley mansion, then maybe it’s decided for you.”
He had no idea how long he was standing in the middle of the road, staring at the spot where Cas had stood, mind racing and completely silent all at once. Bare of any coherent thought.
After a few moments of silence, Dean leaned forward and reached for the remote, unmuting the TV. The movie had ended somewhere in the middle of their talk, a new one already playing. Since it was another well-known classic it didn’t take them long to immerse themselves back into the wonderful world that was old Christmas movies.
“You think I don’t see how you look at him? Or realize how you’re growing closer again?”
The couple looked at each other for two, maybe three seconds – and then started their squealing back up and this time, Dean really did duck his face and cover his ears… along with the deep, deep blush he was sure was spreading across his cheeks as he finally realized what they were hollering about. Sonofabitch, there was no chance for him and Gracie to hear anything about Dublin today. None at all.
“No, of course not. You know you never bother me.”
On the other hand, maybe Dean was just reading too much into this. Which was probably stupid. He blamed Gracie for his paranoia.
Now with Cas in the picture… yeah, Lydia didn’t stand a snowball’s chance in hell. Even if nothing ever happened between them.
“So you’ll take a gift from me?”
It was soft, almost no distraction at all - if it hadn’t been for Cas’ eyes moving to the object, the corner of his mouth twitching up.
It was no secret that the two families were close and that the Winchesters spent their Sundays over at the mansion. So that covered that topic. On to the next one.
He had an inkling by now where this was going. More like, he had known the moment he had seen Michael, he just hadn’t been sure which approach his friend would take.
“That wasn’t the question,” he scolded, only pecking Cas’ mouth once more before moving his lips to Cas’ ear. “I asked what you
Dean waited with bated breath, his head spinning as his world seemed to zero in on his arm and the words appearing there.
That he wanted Cas.
“I mean… yeah? I guess?” Cas replied carefully, letting his fingers wander over the naked skin of Dean’s chest. He wouldn’t quite look Dean in the eye, so Dean put a finger under Cas’ chin, carefully lifting until their gazes met. Not wanting to push, Dean waited for Cas to find his words. “I mean… now that we’re official I really don’t want this to be a long-distance thing. I– I want to be with you.”
“Uhm, they met during Sunday dinner over at the Shurley’s. Well, they had met before but I think that was the first time they got to talking. And, uhm…” Dean needed to really concentrate on what he was saying or else he would just ramble on and on about the man. “I guess, their friendship really became solid when they, uh, when they entered the annual snowman competition together.”
“And my name is Castiel James now.”
to say something. Putting the boxes on the counter, not letting go of them completely, Dean made a decision.
Dean still kept a tight grip on Cas’ hand, pulling him along until they stepped through the front door at last, letting warmth engulf them. Quickly closing the door, Dean shook himself to get rid of the clinging cold, then moved to switch on the light.
“Dean–”
Holding the injured hand in one of his, Dean carefully pulled on the sleeve. The tight winter clothing hardly moved but it was enough for him to be able to see the wrist. Turning it just so, Dean could see the coloring that already spread. The wrist was obviously injured and for Cas’ sake he really hoped it was just a bruise - yet he feared that wasn’t the case.
As Gracie stepped forward, he let go of her shoulder and stayed back, watching in silence as she knelt down on the stone border of the grave. Given the icy ground, there was no way she would be able to dig a little hole for her latest letter – but Dean knew that’s what she wanted. The envelope was thicker than her usual letters; thicker than what she usually put directly in the grave instead of the box under her bed. And he pretended like he didn’t know why that was.
For a second, he had even thought about staying himself, taking one of the guest beds. In the end though, he had rolled his eyes at himself. It was just about a hundred yards – he would live!
= good morning
“Dean,” Cas interrupted, even raising his voice. “I have no idea what you’re talking about. Why would I be mad at you?”
The truck was rumbling along the road. It had felt safer to take this vehicle rather than his Impala and Dean was rather impressed that he had the presence of mind to think this far. If it hadn’t been for his crying daughter in his arms, Dean was sure he would’ve bolted for the door, jumped into the first car available, and rushed after Cas.
“Of course he does,” Meg called out as she searched for three matching white masks in the sea of… well, masks. Seriously, why were there so many to choose from?
Usually, Dean would listen in when the conversation turned to something Gabe had promised his daughter, but right now, Jo’s look distracted him. She was squinting her eyes slightly after hearing Cas’ name. Without meaning to, Dean counted the seconds in his head until –
Dean hadn’t even fully kicked his shoes aside by the time he was already scribbling on his arm, ignoring his mother’s call to not leave a mess in the hallway again as he beelined for his room.
“And I
carry both of us.”
“Yes and, uh…” Dean swallowed for a second, feeling the heat creep up his neck at that question. Jesus, it had been too long since a reply to his daughter’s innocent question would be anything
Excusing himself, Dean left the living room. Maybe meeting Cas alone would finally help Dean to find the right words to mend this.
[Sam 9.07am] Starting to get worried over here. Should we be worried?
In the best way possible.
He had wanted for Dean to move, to step away, to set him free, and Dean…
It was created by the lovely
Chuckling, Dean checked the clock once more and then grabbed his backpack and hastened to the door as he kept scribbling on his arm.
Nodding, he took the few steps to their table. “Yeah, well. It’s the weekend, I just wanted to get out of school. Paperwork will still be there on Monday.”
Kissing her head, Dean pulled her a tad closer. “Apology accepted, then. And it looks like you found a good replacement.”
How long they stood like this, he didn’t even care to tell. It didn’t matter – time and place held no weight as long as he was with Cas. As long as he was in his soulmate’s embrace.
“Pancakes as a peace offering?”
Being kissed awake was a sensation Dean could certainly get used to.
He hadn’t fully processed any of that by the time Cas began to pull his hand away, trying to free it from Dean’s death grip. But that was never gonna happen.
and he knows
Dean knew it was all there - his attraction, his feelings, and all they entailed.
. Dean skipped his morning ride, having absolutely no desire to be reminded of yesterday’s events - but forgoing the routine that usually cleared his mind, the swirl of emotions inside of him was difficult to ignore and he found it hard to focus. At least it was close enough to the end of the year now that he could get away with letting his students write Christmas poems or interpret Christmas carols instead of going over the actual material. More than likely, it even gave him a few cool-points with his students - who certainly voiced no complaints.
“Okay, Cas,” Dean spoke up, mostly to reassure Cas but it also had the advantage of getting his head back in the game. “One step at a time. Don’t rush it.”
With that in mind, he finally decided to man up once it was time for dinner. With his quick maneuvering, he secured the seat right next Cas, ignoring the cold shoulder he kept giving him.
“Be right back,” he assured Gabe, who was already moving around the table to take his place, before bolting for the street.
“Is Mr. James expecting you?” the man asked, thankfully not sounding suspicious, merely as if this was information he needed to know to proceed.
had certainly been an understatement. His foul mood had quickly led to a headache, the constant noise of those pubescent maniacs he had to call his students not making it any better. Neither did their behavior that day. When Andrew didn’t pay attention and doodled in his book rather than answer the question, Dean asked him if he’d prefer answering that question and twenty more at home. When Max played with his phone, Dean simply took it away from him and put it on his own desk – they all knew the rules so when Max complained, Dean sent him a sharp glare. When Scott gave a stupid answer just to be funny, Dean told him that he wasn’t funny at all, nipping the jokes and laughter right in the butt.
He could tell she didn’t buy his bullshit but mercifully, she did not say anything, but simply helped his students with the cookies. Handing bags out to waiting customers.
No matter how sure his soulmate was that Dean couldn’t disappoint, he was still nervous.
“No!” he yelled into the dark morning, spurring Cherry to a faster gait.
Or could it?
“Seriously, Castiel?” Inias spoke up. “During family dinner?”
“Alright.”
Sure that the call would end any moment now, Dean tried to pull himself together. To breathe evenly.
The next punch was the strongest yet and after that, Dean stopped thinking and ran on autopilot as he took his churning emotions out on the bag.
- followed by the main event at ten.
Dean was at a complete loss for words. He hadn’t planned on acting on his feelings but telling his friend that felt just as weird as agreeing with him. So Dean opted out of either option and took another sip of his drink.
Not thinking about any of that, Dean finally let his eyes wander away from Cas’ lips, really looking at the men all around their table. Of course there was Chuck, which – yeah no, he certainly didn’t have a daddy kink, thank you very much. Anna’s husband Crowley was just a few short years older than Dean, but imagining anything with him … Dean quickly took a sip of his eggnog, moving on before he would throw up. Rebecca’s husband Bart had joined the family this weekend, just like Inias’ fiancé Gadreel. They both certainly were handsome guys – in a completely platonic, matter-of-fact kind of way. Meaning Dean could see why Cas’ siblings were drawn to their significant others, but he certainly didn’t feel anything while looking at them.
“But isn’t it tradition for the two of you to enter together?” Alice asked, surprise in her voice.
“And that’s true,” Dean admitted, feeling a bit of embarrassment bubble up inside of him. He pushed it down though. This was Cas, after all. He wouldn’t laugh. “All I know is that I want to be with you and that I’m open to... I don’t know, experimenting in bed, I guess?”
“And official?”
“Yes,” Gracie replied with a huge grin, winding her arms around his torso and burying her nose in his thick pullover. “But it’s still so long.”
However, that didn't change the fact that Dean had absolutely no desire to talk to her now. Especially if it meant leaving Cas and Gracie, even if it was only for a few minutes.
Dean had browsed the Christmas shelves to distract himself while waiting for his daughter to decide between the two objects she held in her hands and when his eyes had landed on a certain DVD, he had huffed a laugh and looked heavenwards.
“Yeah?”
Laughing with him.
Which was one of the reasons he was able to keep himself from asking for Cas’ number. It would only stir up questions he was not willing to answer tonight.
“Yes,” Dean replied, only to backtrack right away. “I mean no. Not for marrying Lisa. But … for … for … damn, I don’t know, okay? For him having to suffer, or whatever.”
Deciding to let the topic of their complicated relationship drop for now, he turned around and leaned back against the railing.
“We’re always talking about what I want,” Dean found himself murmuring as his desire grew tenfold. His desire to give this man in his arms everything he had ever dreamed of, everything he deserved, everything he could ever want. He let his gaze follow his own fingers as they traced Cas’ kiss-swollen lips before he looked back up into Cas’ eyes. “But what is it
“I guess… if the situation arises? I promise I’ll try – but I won’t go through with it if I notice he’s feeling uncomfortable about it, alright?”
It was all that, yes, but it was also so, so much more. It was the fact that Dean could see them interact like this every day. It was the fact that Dean knew, without a doubt, that given the chance, Cas could be a good parent to Gracie. A great one, even. It might take some time getting used to it, but the foundation was already there. Cas loved Gracie and that was the most important thing. And in return, Gracie loved Cas. Unconditionally.
Who's ready for a good dose of Healthy Communication? 😏
. Skirting the line of pretending they weren’t both still thinking about the past. Weren’t both still remembering how much Dean had hurt him? How would they ever move past it if they never spoke of or resolved it? “I am so sorry I just let you run away that day. You have no idea –”
She stopped working on his coat and instead used his lapels to hold him close for a moment. Her eyes found his and if he thought he would find even an ounce of regret or disappointment or pain or any of these emotions there, he was severely mistaken. Which probably should not surprise him anymore after last night. But
A peal of laughter rang out on the other side and Dean could hear Alice call out to her husband, repeating his words.
“No, Mr. Winchester - we all know your taste in movies is amazing.”
The knock on his door was insistent, telling Dean that there was no way for him to evade whoever was behind it. His money was on Eileen but before he could even get up to open the door and politely tell her to please leave him alone, his daughter’s voice spoke up.
The thought blindsided him, but Gracie’s happy voice was enough to keep him focused this time.
Looking down at his desk, Dean was happy to find it cleared of any immediate papers. Obviously, anything important towards the reports had long been handed in, as the students had all gotten their cards today. So all that could have been left were minor stuff, long-term projects that would count towards the final grade. But even that was all mostly gone. There was only one stack he had gotten out in the hopes of
? Not you?”
“Eileen, it’s been thirteen years. Do you really think after all this time, he would still harbor those feelings for me?”
“Gracie–”
“Why not?” Charlie answered, looking affronted. “Maybe my theory is true and they can’t survive without us.”
He hadn’t even had time to think about their almost kiss two days ago – because, yes, he was pretty sure they would have kissed if it hadn’t been for Brady interrupting them – and now he already needed to think about Cas essentially telling him that he used to love him.
Quickly, he booted up his laptop, trying not to lose the fickle thought of a quote whispering around his mind. He was sure he was remembering correctly. Sure that there was a saying similar to what he was thinking of. Pulling up Google, he quickly typed in some keywords and not even a minute later, he was whooping in triumph.
His shout went unanswered, it only echoed around him.
His lips and his hand and his skin.
“Just one more thing,” Dean interrupted again and even held up one finger. The whole time, he had wondered what to say, how to get all the thoughts inside his head across in an understandable way. But now that the moment was here, now that he was looking into Cas’ eyes, so wide in wonder, it was as if a dam had broken and all that he needed him to know simply spilled out. “I’m sorry it took me so long. I loved Lisa, honestly. But meeting you again, this grown-up version of you... I didn’t know love could be like that.”
Scary as it was, but the second option certainly made more sense. Most likely, his feelings for Cas made him hallucinate.
The biggest thanks to
my brother. I’m not gonna let him get hurt again.”
“Charlie, will you just
In the background, Dean saw his daughter finally move towards Michael, the last of the Shurleys. Eileen must have seen it as well, knowing that this meant Gracie would be done soon. “I’m looking forward to talking some more with you while you’re here,” she told Cas and Dean was pleased to see that Cas seemed honestly thrilled at the prospect.
“It doesn’t matter anymore, Dean.”
The last thing he wanted was for his daughter to wake up from a nightmare or a scary noise and then run out into the storm alone to get back to the house. Sure, it was only a few yards – but the storm was still raging outside.
how he had planned for this conversation to go. He had meant to prevent
Could there have been a more terrible line? After all, Cas hadn’t been running away from him. Not outright, at least. And after Friday…
“Whoops, sorry, Mr. Winchester.”
was the reason for him to be there? Can't wait to hear from you 💙💚 let me know if you liked to see this scene from Dean's POV - because I certainly enjoyed writing it!
Deflecting.
Like with the question if he should really gift Ruby's foal to Gracie. The horse would give birth around Christmas and Grace had begged to have it be hers ever since they’d found out Ruby was pregnant. Sure, it was a lovely thought, but it also meant a lot of responsibilities. Then again, maybe it would help Gracie get rid of the underlying fear Dean knew she still had. Not that it was keeping her away from the horses in general but the fact that, so far, she hadn't asked him to be allowed back in a saddle told him everything. Gracie had grown up on the back of a horse. After Lisa's death, they had moved to Bobby's ranch, and Gracie had spent as much time as possible riding, or hanging out in the stables or outside at the paddock.
Dean was not really doing anything. Some student papers lay in front of him and theoretically, he was grading them - but tomorrow was the last day of school and no student wanted their papers back before the holidays anyway. So really, Dean was much more occupied watching the scene in front of him.
Monday morning started with a double session literature with his own class. After what had happened last week, Dean had promised himself to take extra effort not to let his personal feelings and problems seep into his work life.
Under such close scrutiny, Dean had to look away, unable to hold Michael’s inquiring gaze for much longer. Still, he replied in a soft murmur. “Did you really think I slept with your brother because ‘I felt like it’ that night?”
“Sure. Was just waiting for you to get ready.”
Cas was leaving.
He took his time instead of rushing through his nightly routine as he usually did if only to give Grace some more minutes to read. Washing his face with cold water, Dean finally looked at himself in the mirror, tracing the droplets with his gaze before staring into his own eyes.
Getting rid of anything and everything that was in the way of feeling Cas again, fully, completely.
Careful not to jostle the two figurines, Dean pulled his daughter to his side with one arm, pressing a kiss to her head.
Dean waited for Gracie to be occupied with her dessert before he pulled Cas a bit closer, bringing his lips close to his ear so he could whisper, “You told Meg, didn’t you?”
dumb.” His glare did little to stop Jo’s rant. “Have you ever considered he might be embarrassed, or even still harboring feelings for you?”
Okay then. Dean had known he made a fucking huge mistake – but Cas was still a damn adult! And adults should know better than to
Because
Which, by the way, was exactly what made this experience so amazing, what had Dean even more enthusiastic, and what turned him on more than he would’ve thought.
Smiling at him.
“Nice to meet you too,” Cas replied while taking her hand.
“That the feelings you had for Lisa were different from the ones you have – and always had – for Cas.”
There was still a slight possibility that Cas’ aunt didn’t know everything about his life - but she looked like she knew what she was talking about, so Dean wouldn’t question it. For now.
that, okay? For you. I
,” Gracie replied with a grin, but nevertheless she listened and put the sugar down.
The color visibly drained from Cas’ cheeks as his face fell. “What?”
And when Cas replied with a heartfelt, “Absolutely,” and took his hand to pull him along, Dean knew it would all be alright. There were still so many things to discuss, so many things to clear up between them; he still didn’t know why Cas had run away, still didn’t know if Cas wanted a future with him or what any of this would ultimately lead to.
“Deal,” Cas replied right away, even sticking out his hand for Dean to shake. “We’ll talk about the stakes tomorrow.”
Hell, if it hadn’t been for the latter, he might’ve even asked Novak out after all, if only to see if he was his C.
, all his dark thoughts had been fully erased and all that was left was the memory of the first real smile Dean had seen since Cas’ return.
He needed him to shut up. He needed him to stop these accusations and wrong interpretations. He needed him to listen to him but Cas was on a roll and all that kept repeating in Dean’s head was that Cas’ crush on him, his feelings for Dean, had never gone away and
God, Dean hated himself at this very moment.
Merry Christmas my dear readers - check out the end note because there is a gift waiting for you 🎁
. They should not be burdened with any problems aside from homework and who to ask to the next prom. Dean knew that that was an utopian wish. Had learned it first hand in his own youth.
a damn reason!
Oh, this was too good to be true. Squeezing Gracie’s hand to keep her from giggling, he himself had to hold back his laugh. It took all his self-control to not break as he spoke the next words. “What, you haven’t heard yet? And here I was, thinking
like him! And I think you two would be so good together-”
They were silent again as their gazes wandered over the ranch, up to the horizon. Somewhere in that direction lay New York. Somewhere over the horizon, Cas was back home, probably settling back into his normal life.
“You. Just you.”
Dean followed her hand to see Cas already packing his own baggie, a serene smile on his lips. God, it was so nice seeing the man like this. Peaceful and happy. Without a dark thought to mar his beautiful face.
“Yeah,” Cas agreed, a grin flicking over his face. “I guess Michael would have killed you had you made a move while I was fourteen and you were twenty-three.”
It was his rational side that won for now, even though his emotional side was still loud.
Especially when it would make him more comfortable.
Just like that, the conversation turned into a big one with everybody at the table involved and Dean thanked the Gods for Eileen’s quick thinking.
Time to also chase away that sadness, to start making amends.
“How is it going for us?” Charlie asked back, grinning wildly. “The question should be, how is it going for
Shaking his head, Dean dropped the book on his nightstand before finally getting ready for bed himself.
They sat like that for a small eternity but Dean had no idea how to let go of her. Not now. Not with all her written words still burning into his mind. Into his soul.
“Awesome,” Gracie replied with a wide grin. “I got your postcard from Lisbon. Really looks amazing there. Where do you like it more?”
“Yes! You’re
of me?”
“Shhh, shhh, pumpkin, calm down. What are you talking about? Who’s leaving?”
Dean nodded, remembering that time. Right now, he couldn’t even put into words how grateful he was for his friend not asking why he wanted to know.
The broken question of his daughter almost made him lose it. But in the end, it was the deep, deep hurt in Cas’ eyes that broke him. When their gazes locked, he was immediately thrown back thirteen years.
“Shut up, Sammy,” Dean threw in quietly before turning back to Cas’ aunt. “Amara, listen, I am really sor–”
“Of course not, Pumpkin,” he promised, before switching back to Dad-mode. “But if you make a promise, you need to keep it, Gracie.”
“Uhh, yeah. Sure … well, anyway, would you help with the soda machine? It appears to be broken.”
Huffing a little laugh and pressing one last chaste kiss to the side of Cas’ mouth, Dean stepped back. Cas quickly filled the waiting plate with bacon while Dean prepared them both two mugs of coffee.
There were some more shushing noises from different directions and Dean was fucking beaming when that didn’t dampen Cas’ little snicker. Nor did it keep him from continuing.
Dean swallowed again, harder this time. He tried to find words. Tried to say something -
. The other guy I was talking about. The one that I’ve admired from afar. That I’ve been crushing over for the past few months. That’s
“No, Michael,” Dean called back, holding his gaze to make sure his friend knew he was dead serious. “The mistake was made the night before last. Right now, I’m just picking up the pieces.”
Dean closed the passenger door and moved to the back to throw Gracie’s bag in the trunk. Walking around to the driver’s side, Dean swore the moment he saw how close the car next to his side had parked.
Chuck Shurley surely was the grandfather Gracie would have never had in John Winchester, which was why Dean was even more grateful for Michael’s father basically adopting them after Gracie had lost her mom. It stood to reason that he’d mostly adopted Dean to help him get over the loss of his wife four years ago, but either way, Gracie was now part of the Shurley clan in almost every way imaginable.
Only to find the alley empty.
Is a Dream
On the other side, it held Gracie’s name.
Chuckling darkly, Dean flushed just in case Michael was listening, then turned on the tab. He held his wrists under the water, letting the cold over his pulse slowly calm him and clear his head from all the fuzziness. For good measure, he also washed his face.
They could’ve probably drawn it out far longer and someday soon, they would. Someday soon, they would spend a whole day in bed exploring each other, and just stay intertwined and connected in every way possible. Right now though, Cas was too overwhelmed by all the sensations to slow down; especially when Dean bent his legs, giving himself leverage to meet Cas’ thrusts. It didn’t take long after that before Cas was seeing stars. And given Dean’s deep groan and the shiver running through his body, he was right behind him.
“What is it?” Cas asked, although he had a little inkling.
Catching Cas’ gaze when Cas glanced at him briefly, they exchanged some tight smiles but soon enough, Cas’ left hand covered Dean’s again, holding as tight as the cast allowed; reassuring each other that that time was way past them.
And as so often before, he
A faith that was so rudely ruptured when he saw a little light ahead of him churning wildly and begin to tumble dangerously towards the slope Dean knew started just there. The scream that followed just seconds later and the red light suddenly disappearing made his heart freeze, as if ice pierced it.
“Nope,” Dean confirmed… but then couldn’t help himself to add with a tiny smirk, “Even though I would have had a few options, let me tell you.”
For now, though, he concentrated on Cas’ next argument.
“Good,” he replied, thankful that he sounded normal.
telling Taylor how nice this was of him, but, well, he
“Yes, he is,” Grace piped up, turning towards him with a wide beam herself. “Cas and dad made up and now they’re happy and in love.”
he followed Jo’s other advice.
“Yeah, kinda. Just another fight with our mom. Sorry, I really didn’t-”
“Oh?” Jo replied, her voice and gaze turning way too sweet to be sincere. “So everything was alright when you met again? You talked and laughed and were friends again just like in the old days?”
His friends could be a pain in the ass sometimes – but they also had big hearts and they knew when better not to push him too far. They didn’t mention Cas or Lisa or Dean’s feelings for the rest of their call, rather, they told Dean about how surprisingly friendly people in Germany were.
Looking up, he looked at Andrew and Krissy, the only two of the group currently not busy with collecting money or tending otherwise to customers.
“I’ll make it,” he said as he stood. “I want to see what Bobby has in stock before I settle on a brand. And you,” he added, pressing a kiss to Alice’s hair. “You talk to our boy.”
It didn’t matter that he loved him back.
Lydia, however, seemed not to notice.
“You two seriously have nothing better to do but to gossip about my life?”
God, he was such a sap.
Dean tried for a tight smile and held up the bags of roasted almonds.
Dean didn’t even know if he replied anything to that, too far in his head as this strange combination of worry and relief washed over him in waves, again and again. He had to get up and walk around his apartment, just to ease some of the nervous energy coursing through him.
He had a flock of kids to look after, not to mention his own daughter. He had responsibilities, he-
Dean had no idea how he knew, but the few cells in his brain not currently vacationing in fantasyland - those few remaining cells told him it was most likely popcorn.
There was a question he was supposed to answer, right?
With a groan, Dean pushed both hands through his hair, trying to get his thoughts in a straight line.
They took all of three steps, his students still in his back as well as the crowd of gossipers, when two things happened at once.
No. No that couldn’t be.
“What...” he began, then swallowed to find his voice or rather, the right words. Pointing at the pie, he asked, “What’s that?”
His soulmate’s name, he finally knew it. It was Cas and Dean was grinning like a fool just thinking about it.
C was going to be alright.
So not complaining, he let his two best friends do as they pleased and simply went along for the ride… spending the rest of the day daydreaming about a faceless person in angel attire.
As they stepped into the kitchen, Dean once again became aware of how early it still was, the gray winter sky only now getting its first touches of rose. The longer they worked on preparing their breakfast though – which mostly consisted of them heavily making out and Dean trying to keep an eye on the pancakes so they wouldn’t burn – the nicer the morning sky looked. By the time everything was plated, the sun had decided to make an appearance, luring both men onto the balcony. While Cas switched on the heaters, Dean settled down on one of the spacious deckchairs, foregoing the table since they would eat the pancakes by hand anyway. As Cas drew closer, Dean made room for him by spreading his legs and bending one knee so Cas could easily sit between them and lean against said knee.
“He’s in publishing,” he said, trotting out the lie Cas had told everyone in Stars Hollow. “He works in his family’s publishing business, editing or something.”
of all people had figured it out already.” And leaning in as if to tell them the secret, both women hanging on his every word, he added in a conspiratorial tone, “I fear you’re losing your edge, ladies.”
And not just because of his fear for Cas.
Somehow, his still relaxed posture, the generally relaxed atmosphere that flowed between the two of them now, so contrary to what it had been during dinner… it eased a knot inside of Dean he hadn’t noticed to be there until it was gone. It helped his smile come easily, full of hope while he held up the small present with the card tucked into the ribbon.
“Ehm,” Cas replied and looked down at his hand as if he had to check, “broken wrist; shoulder was dislocated; a few bruises, cuts, and scrapes. I’ll survive, though,” he assured him, looking back up at Dean.
As they got dressed, Cas suddenly looked up, as if just remembering something, and then looked at Dean, wide-eyed. “Dean, there are no direct flights from Hartford to New York.”
Dean’s heart beat wildly when he saw Cas’ soft smile, possibly remembering all those times as well. But he could also see that there was a lot of doubt and yeah, how could there not? It certainly wasn’t the best of explanations.
It was probably the lack of caffeine in his system but it could have also just been the early morning hour, but Dean needed a moment to grasp the meaning behind Cas’ words. When it hit him, he pressed a kiss to the man’s head as best as he could. “I love how considerate that is of you. But I promise, I wouldn’t ever mind you waking me up in any way you think we both might enjoy.” When Cas moved to look up at him, Dean caught his lips in a sweet kiss, before adding, “You have my full consent for that.”

going through while one of his classes was playing a game. Since he had been involved in all the activities, it had remained untouched and went back into his bag in the same condition. If he was really lucky, he would find some time over the next two weeks to take care of this, so it wouldn’t bother him once the new term began.
“And, no one ever knows the future. So please, don’t ever think Cas did what he did back then so you wouldn’t be born, okay? He really likes you, I know that.”
The last two stripes were added before the flag vanished and then C’s writing appeared again.
“Hello, Chuck, it’s nice to see you too,” Eileen replied, probably not noticing the somewhat awkward tenseness in the air.
“But-”
“Seriously, Taylor?” Sam pressed out. “All these years and you still confuse me for my brother? I even
Not trusting his instincts though, Dean still forced himself to move forward and check. He needed to
In what direction, Dean had no idea just yet.
Still though, it had the desired effect. Instantly, Cas turned back to him, catching his lips. Dean was nearly delirious already, parting his lips without hesitation when Cas’ tongue begged for entrance. There were hands everywhere and somewhere between the kiss getting more and more heated and his duffle bag being dropped along with their coats, Dean knew he had been pushed into the penthouse; the loud bang of the door being kicked shut a surefire indication, even though it was once again nothing more than background information that hardly registered with Dean. All that mattered were those lips on his and those hands on him. Without even thinking about it, Dean got rid of his beanie, scarf, and gloves, going through the motions with a single-minded focus.
“Yes.”
Not that he was complaining, not really. But he would have rather spent the rest of the day without some more work to handle.
“It was the most boring book ever. I feel like that hobbit walked through the woods for over a hundred pages. But the books from C. S. James? I can’t put those down!” she concluded with a sweet smirk. “So, definitely no question about who the better author is.”
Thank you again for sticking with me on this journey, and I hope to see you soon… because, you know…
It could’ve been worse.
And while he was still mad at Cas – while there were so many reasons for him to believe Cas wouldn’t care about seeing Dean like this – there was no way to contain the fresh anger bubbling up inside of him.
Yeah, suspicions was the right word.
Then again, the Shurley’s were
“There’s nothing to continue,” Dean argued, but this time, he wasn’t able to stop Jo.
“Why did
, Dean knew better than to click on them – but he did it anyway. Because apparently, he was turning into a masochist.
. Please, send some love her way 💕
“What?” Dean asked back, his brain not fully caught up just yet because, oh God, it really was Cas! Thank God, he was here. He was really here, he was okay, he was
“Hey, Cas?” he whispered into his hair before Cas could feel a kiss pressed there.
As they watched the little group prepare the first load of fireworks, he nuzzled against Cas’ hair before finally whispering into Cas’ ear. “I was thinking… Are you still trying to convince me that there’s a better author?”
“Uhm… so-”
“Friends?” Charlie threw in, obviously confused. “Didn’t you tell me it was one of his students that –”
No,” he replied with a bit more force than strictly necessary. “Why would you think that?”
“Then what?”
“He did?” Dean asked in surprise – not because he felt ashamed or embarrassed that Michael knew what his brother and Dean had done. But because he was shocked that Cas would admit to it when he most likely had a boyfriend back in New York.
They also knew that it was certainly a Pride celebration they would never forget.
“Cas, what’s going on?”
Fighting back his desire to give in right away, he let his Dad-side take the reins one last time.
, so leave her the hell alone. And for good measure, leave
Dean was about to reply but felt more words appear.
“And the new last name?” Eileen went on. “Are you married?”
The pleasure that was wracking his body…
you met upstairs. He’s my editor and best friend.”
Well, it seemed the only good thing about Cas being taken - or at least not interested in Dean any longer - was that Dean could put a hold on actually confronting his feelings for real. He had acknowledged them, had accepted them. But as long as there was never any hope that this would lead anywhere, he wouldn’t have to confront them any further than that. Wouldn’t have to examine them. Wouldn’t have to think about what they really meant - for him
The envelope was resting in his lap and more than once, Dean looked down at it, wondering. If Cas refused to see him, would it be a good idea to just leave it with him? Including the doodle he knew to still be in there?
Swallowing, Ava nodded, quickly pulling her hand back once he’d let go, the letter inside her jeans’ pocket within a nanosecond.
“Let’s try the first option,” Cas breathed out, much to Dean’s relief. He really did not want to leave Cas alone in such a condition.
They were breathing the same air.
“What?”
Twenty minutes later, Dean was cleaned and dressed, a small duffle bag hastily packed with the necessities to stay a night or two in New York if needed. With weather like this, one could never know. Leaving his room, he was still wondering what Grace had been talking about – when once again he heard familiar voices coming from his living room. As he had guessed, Sam and Eileen were there, but as he spotted the third person sitting on his couch, he stopped in his tracks, eyes wide in disbelief.
And the lovely woman walking by his side.
It didn’t take much coaxing for Cas to collapse onto him, head buried in the crook of Dean’s neck, hot breath ghosting over Dean’s skin while they both tried to get their breathing under control.
Finally reaching the bedroom, Dean gave in to his desire of fully feeling Cas in his arms once more, lifting him up to carefully crawl onto the bed with him. It was a wonderful sensation and only reluctantly did he lower him onto the bed, laying Cas out under him like the precious gift he was. For a moment, all he could do was stare into those ocean blue eyes that shone back at him with love and desire, illuminated by the lights of Manhattan shining through the window; making them sparkle all the more.
“I hope you can live with Zar’s choice of a meat lovers pizza because I’m sure as hell not sharing my pepperoni.”
Instead, Dean engaged in the general conversations going on around the table, laughing and enjoying the time with everyone. It truly had been a wonderful day so far and he knew it was far from being over – but if anyone asked him, he could spend eternity here. The only thing that needed to change was this frosty atmosphere between him and Cas and – God damn it all – he would make sure it happened.
= Did I miss something?
Pie at
It seemed, the man was a little geek when it came to Harry Potter - which Dean thought was positively cute. If only Charlie were here - she would have loved the man to pieces. But he couldn’t think of that now. No, Dean had to stay focused and not get distracted by the moment. Had to listen to Cas’ arguments.
(See the end of the chapter for
A car honking at him got Dean out of his stupor at last and he quickly made his way inside. Gracie and Cas seemed to both be working on their own stuff, completely immersed and in what appeared to be a perfectly quiet, harmonious atmosphere.
Dean could feel the blood draining from his face. His fingers went numb for a second and he had to grip the steering wheel harder so he wouldn’t lose control.
“Hey,” Cas chuckled, “come on, just a minute. I need to–”
“Grace…”
? He said that?!”
“You! This is all your fault!”
But he also realized that he’d lost his chance.
Angel Cookies.
Broken free from a spell he had been under.
risk for Cas having to go through that again, being hurt like that
He was about to go get his phone to check for any messages and call Cas in case there were none when the front door opened. The flicker of hope he felt in his chest was smashed in the worst way he could have ever imagined. It was Gracie and she had obviously been crying.
At last, Zar threw a wink in Cas’ direction and nodded. “Anytime. You know that.”
“Sure, pumpkin. You know you always can.”
“Not if you’re a true New Yorker, you don’t.”
Therefore, he absolutely anticipated his daughter’s next move.
“I didn’t get a chance last night to say goodbye,” he began, keeping his voice low. This was hardly the place to discuss this, but he needed to make sure Cas was alright. He wanted to know if he had made Cas uncomfortable, if that was why he had left so abruptly. “You were gone all of a sudden. Everything okay?”
Circling his table, he made sure to look directly at each student he addressed.
Because that was another thing he had learned over time. C was definitely a very intelligent and intellectual person. The thought of that kept Dean awake sometimes, seeing how he himself had barely made his way through high school, and was now looking ahead to start working at his uncle Bobby’s garage full time once school was over. The garage and scrapyard just outside the city limits of Lincoln, Nebraska, wasn’t much, but it was like a second home to Dean and he loved it there more than in his own room sometimes.
But sleep wouldn’t come for him.
Dean was sure his lips quirked up into a little smile. Nevertheless, both of his friends grew serious right away.
“It’s the cookies, okay!” Cas suddenly yelled and with one swift move, he ripped his arm away from Dean’s hold, even taking a step back to put some space between them.
Gracie skipped into his office and threw her arms around his neck, resting her chin on his shoulder as she looked down on his desk.
They would talk and get all these misunderstandings out of the way.
Once he had Cas spread underneath him again, boxed in with his arms and leaving little to no space between their bodies, Dean was thrilled to see that the frustrated look on his lover’s face had vanished, a groan pulled from him so filthy and full of longing that Dean didn’t hesitate to move. Strong legs wound around his hips, urging him and – Jesus, that position was simply marvelous. The feeling of Cas around him, around his dick, in his arms,
“Gracie–”
enjoyed. And given Cas’ reaction, he was doing something right.
It seemed Alice had caught on to his somewhat darkened mood. She kept sending him small looks of concern, but Dean refused to let it ruin their final evening together and ignored them. Sam would be around early the next morning to pick them up and then drop them off at the train station on his way to work. There wasn’t a lot of time left to enjoy some quality family time, so they had to make the best of it now. Gracie was fully basking in having her grandparents around and Dean was certainly not going to ruin that for her.
As usual, that only got him an eye roll out of Charlie. “Yeah, and so does about ninety-eight percent of the world population. Doesn’t mean you can’t fall for someone else.”
“But we know the gist of it.”
Shaking away the what if’s of the past, he focused back on Chuck’s speech.
“It’s … it’s alright, Grace,” Cas replied, and Dean was glad he seemed to be sincere about it. Of course he would have had every right to be mad at Gracie for giving away a secret – but Dean would still have defended his daughter had Cas said anything mean to her because of it. Instead, Cas went on. “I didn’t mean for you to keep it from your dad, it’s okay. Of course you shouldn’t have to lie to him, so it’s alright.”
Not wanting his daughter to sound impertinent, he softly flicked her in her back where Cas wouldn’t see it, and added a soft, “Gracie,” in warning.
Dean’s heart sank even though he hadn’t
Barking out a bitter laugh, Dean shook his head. “After thirteen years? Come on, Jo. This isn’t a Nicholas Sparks movie, okay? In the real world, people actually
To his great satisfaction, almost all students had been on time, making Dean proud at how organized his kids were. Only Max came running five minutes after their sale had opened, two more boxes of cookies in his hand.
“Cas? As in… Castiel Shurley?” Alice asked, leaning forward in her seat next to Gracie, probably to catch Dean’s answer.
Cas seemed to kick back into action after that, clumsily tugging on Dean’s shirt in a rush to get it off. Dean happily helped and once the offending material was tossed aside, he pushed Cas’ dress shirt down his shoulders. While he could easily free his right hand himself, Dean helped carefully disentangle the left one where the shirt got stuck on the cast.
God, he fucking loved his students. No matter how annoying, and tedious, and all-around hell they could be sometimes - they were truly little angels in disguise.
He didn’t have to wait long for a reply.
She’d worn a costume close enough to Charlie’s and his own – a garment put together from their respective pride flags, not that it was all that original to be fair, but as always, C had agreed to what their friends wanted and Dean and Charlie had followed along. Cassie’s attire looked like it had been made by a professional, but who was to say his soulmate wasn’t talented when it came to handcrafted things, right?
Damnit indeed. He remembered those days. Remembered being a young, good-looking teacher. The weight of the parents’ concerns, something that was hard to forget. The guilt never far, no matter how hard he pushed it down. There was no reason to feel guilty, it wasn’t like he was actually
“Yes, Dad.”
That… okay, he needed to stay cool here, but what the
Before they could all pile into Sam’s car, Dean was struck by a flash of genius and dashed back into his office where he grabbed the envelope from its place on the shelf.
The squeaking of tires and a roaring engine was what drew his attention and like most people at the fair, he turned to look in the direction – catching the last glimpse of a midnight blue Camaro that was speeding away.
At least Sam and Eileen had waited until Bobby and Gracie had taken off to check on Ruby - if they were lucky, the mare really would have her foal around Christmas Day, giving Gracie the present she so desired.
He was less pleased about Cas’ protest.
And third, our long, long,
“Or maybe the influence of all her uncles was helpful.”
“Did I, now? Well, it was a late night,” Dean replied with a quick glance to the clock on the wall. It was indeed closer to eleven than ten but Dean couldn’t find it in him to mind. “And I guess I’m getting old,” he added with a grin as he pushed himself from the wall to saunter further into the room.
Things certainly didn’t look up from there. The dining room was huge, enough space to fit the Shurley clan. An extra table was prepared for the children, the main table already almost bursting with the seven Shurley siblings, three of their significant others, Chuck and his sister, and of course Bobby and the three Winchesters. Somehow, Cas had ended up at the very other end of the table, as far away from Dean as possible. He tried not to think that Cas had done it on purpose, and mostly tried to ignore the squeezing in his chest. Thankfully, sitting next to Michael helped a great deal, the two friends chatting just like always, laughing here and there over old stories and dumb jokes.
“Liiiiiieee,” Gracie squeaked as he moved towards her room. “You know that’s
“You got it,” Michael replied and while he laughed with the rest of the room, Dean could see an understanding shine in his friend’s eyes. Yep, certainly a topic the two of them would have to discuss at some point in the next three years or so.
It didn’t matter what he wanted now.
“I like it,” Dean admitted softly, pulling himself back to the conversation.
But Dean had no desire to put it to the test. Because he
Cas’ voice had been so full of emotion that Dean dared to assert a guess about where his thoughts had wandered after that first bite. He had once told him that eating Angel Cookies always reminded him of their hurtful past and that it was painful to even smell them. Now though, Cas was eating them with gusto, a serene smile on his lips as he followed his siblings’ conversation. When their eyes met again, briefly, Dean was sure of his guess.
“You could go after him.”
And sonofabitch, did he do it for him.
“It was a mistake. Last night should have never happened.”
Dean couldn’t breathe. The blood was rushing inside his ears, making it hard to keep focused.
It was Cherry dancing nervously that finally made the decision for him somehow. Turning her around, Dean took the same way along the lake to get back home, eyes scanning the area on both sides closely. The further he got, the heavier his heart grew. Not finding Cas was a good thing, of course. But it also meant he’d missed him today.
He didn’t want Cas to go.
He heard Brady call something to him – but it was more a buzzing in his ears than actual words.
There was such a long silence that Dean checked if the call was disconnected, “Sammy?”
“Shit,” he said, not able to hide all of the panic boiling under his skin. But he needed to stay calm, needed to save Cas. Needed to find a way.
Videos.
because of the important role they play.”
“I’m sorry, Dean. But this little crush of yours is just the cutest.”
How come, sometimes, nothing happens for weeks and then everything seems to happen within a few days? With every encounter between him and Cas, it felt like a push and pull and every time Dean had time to
The only one really taking it serious tonight was Gracie, the countless stacks of chips spoke volumes. Some people might think it inappropriate for a young girl to already be gambling. Dean though was of the opinion that kids simply needed to be taught a healthy relationship with such things. Which was also why Gracie was allowed small sips of alcohol when Dean was around, like champagne on New Year’s or that sip of beer she wanted to try on her birthday. Sooner or later, she would grow up and maybe drink and gamble anyway. The least he could do was make sure she had a healthy understanding of it all, maybe prevent her from having any problems with them.
Seeking him out with his eyes, he found him in a heartfelt embrace with daughter, wondering what had just transpired between these two but seeing no way of finding out without prying into their lives too much. So instead, he finished his drink and waited for the start of the next movie they all wanted to watch.
What had been easy to ignore last Saturday - when they were out in the open space and surrounded by so many other people - was almost torturous now. Here in the dark, their elbows brushing together, Cas’ breath ghosting along Dean’s skin when he leaned in to whisper. Torture.
Another thought came to him, unexpected and unbidden. Of someone else by his side and for the briefest moment, he saw a vision of dark blue eyes and a soft smile, both framed by wrinkled skin and salt-and-pepper hair...
When Gracie got up, Dean quickly looked to the side, wiping the wetness-that-was-not-tears away from his eyes.
There was no immediate reply and Dean didn’t dare look up, busying himself instead with finishing his drink. Damn, he should have saved some because his guts were telling him that this conversation was far from being over. Would it look bad if he got a refill already?
“You. Inside of me.”
An idiot and… apparently ‘the other guy’ now. Without knowing, without ever wanting to, Dean had become a fucking cheater. God, he really was going to throw up.
There was no way for him to stop the feral growl at hearing Cas tease him like that. There was no way for him to slow down, barely enough presence of mind to make sure Cas wouldn’t hurt himself as Dean crowded him against the door. And there certainly was no way for him to keep his lips and hands away from Cas; kissing and sucking and nibbling on his neck while he also tried to get rid of that offensive hoodie still in the way. When it was finally gone, giving his lips access to even more delicate skin, Dean let his hands wander lower. In one quick and smooth motion, he took hold of the back of Cas’ thighs, lifting him up so he could press even closer.
“Oh, don’t worry, boy,” Miss Patty replied, making Dean almost roll his eyes. No matter how old he would get, for Patricia LaCosta he would always be a boy. “They’re all so excited, they don’t even feel the cold.”
wanted to go home, Dean was sure he could call a colleague, make sure someone was there to supervise the students until he got back.
“Yeah. This is more than I ever thought you would admit, so guess I’ll just count it as a good start.”
To his amusement – and immense pleasure – sleepy Cas reached for him the moment Dean leaned back up, blindly grabbing for him. He couldn’t suppress the chuckle as he already moved to the door.
“Are you kidding?” Cas asked, eyes wide.
“Well, hardly anyone in New York knows my birth name.”
Letting his fingers slowly trace over Cas’ shoulder, he continued.
“Yes, Patty, you have my word. Castiel came back; he must be around here somewhere.”
A quick kiss was planted onto his cheek and before he could react, Gracie let herself fall back onto her bed, using the bounce to get the covers loose and bury under them.
Knew it instantly - even though the name evaded him at that moment. But even without a name, he remembered that voice, and he knew one thing for sure.
Dean took a steadying breath. “I don’t think so, no.”
Tears were welling up in Dean’s eyes as he read all that C had to tell him. He had been so close to losing his soulmate, so close to losing the one person that meant more to him than anyone else. He was shaking with emotions, with fear and relief, tears now running freely down his face.
“You gotta be kidding me,” Dean mumbled when he woke up for the umpteenth time that night. It wasn’t even four-thirty in the morning and he was ready to give up on sleep again. How could it be that he was dreaming about Cas three nights in a row just because the man happened to be back in his life?
You hold in your Hand.

“Nothing. I was just… well… I was just wondering-”
It wouldn’t come.
“Duh. You think we’re not staying in contact with Gracie just because we’re in Europe?”
Turning, Dean closed his eyes, trying to get in a few more Z’s.

A home.
Dean scoffed at that, for once too tired and emotionally drained to keep pretending at playing nice. “We both know people here gossip all the time. I don’t give a damn about what they say about me. But if it starts hurting those I love–”
Starting today, look forward to a daily update for the rest of the year, each taking us back to Stars Hollow and Dean, Cas, and Gracie. We'll start off with the next three chapters of our tale... then take a momentary jump into their happy future with five fluffy (and sometimes sexy) timestamps - each of them fulfilling one of the prompts given by you, my dear readers 💖
There was some rustling on the phone on Sam’s end before his brother spoke again.
- he turned to Cas to explain what they were talking about. “My senior class is planning a trip right before spring break. To get some money, I convinced the principal and Taylor Doose to let the kids set up a table at the Fair, selling Christmas cookies.”
Knowing that his two favorite people were waiting for him at
“Wow!”

“Yes, pumpkin?”
[Eileen 9.23pm] Are you alright? How’s Gracie? Call us when you have a minute.
As he left
And then he was kissing him.
“Uhm,” he said, dumb as he was. Thankfully, he remembered the map in his hand, finally holding it out.
important thing for him. And if that meant talking to her because her time of wallowing alone was over – well then Dean would have to suck it up and let it happen.
“Yes,” the young girl beamed. “Mom said it’s one of your favorites, so I wanted to see it as well.”
Dean waited with bated breath. It was a full two minutes before he finally saw something appear on his skin.
“D approves of the theme.”
to love him.
When would Cas
Reaching up, he let his fingers brush gently along Cas’ cheek, over his lips – which were too kissable not to give in – and down his neck, hooking one finger into Cas’ necklace to pull him down by it. He needed to taste him, needed to be connected with him as much as possible. The moment their lips met again though, Cas started moving and Dean was lost. Lost in the feeling, the sensation, even more lost than he had been before, and the only anchor in his haze was
Unable to keep his hands still, Dean reached for Cas’ dick, reveling again in the feeling of it in his hand as he began to stroke him. Cas’ eyes opened, his gaze hazy and filled with lust but also with love and bliss, and when he leaned down, Dean happily welcomed the kiss. They stayed like this for a moment, Cas’ breathing hitching from time to time as he kept up with the slow movement of his hips, fucking into Dean’s hand and then back on his fingers. There was no way for Dean to tell how far Cas was with prepping himself but he had a feeling that it was thoroughly done.
Taking another deep breath, Dean finally wrote the words that hurt himself even just thinking them.
Chalking it up to wanting to be his friend again.
But was it possible that he hadn't loved her as she would have deserved it?
He completely blanked out on the conversation going on between Eileen and Cas, only pulled back to the present when Cas’ laughter rang through the foyer, intensifying the turmoil in Dean’s stomach by tenfold. After grinning at Sam – and God, did Dean want this grin to be directed at him – Cas left the room with Eileen on his arm.
“And why not?” she asked, sitting back so she could look at him, a challenge in her eyes. “Have you tried it yet?”
“Of course I do. You know that.”
Instead, he turned around and answered the phone. “Zar, hang on a second. Gotta leave the room.”
He had no idea how many blocks he’d already walked by the time his head finally cleared, leaving him with the realization that he had just stumbled through a minor panic attack. He stopped at a crossroads, leaning his hand against a street sign to steady himself. Back home in Stars Hollow, he knew at least five people would have come rushing to ask if he was okay. But this was New York, so he was safe, he was left alone.
“I mean, she was there. But my dream was about you.”
than he was, just to show Lydia that there was no space for her in their lives?
Bart seemed to contemplate and for a split second, Dean was thankful it was him and not one of Cas’ siblings. It would probably have taken a lot more than that to convince them – but Rebecca’s husband simply nodded and opened the door further while stepping aside.
“Really? That’s all? ‘Okay’?”
smiling about himself, he finally got up and ready for his morning routine.
“Well,” he replied, and by the calm tone, Dean was sure the topic didn’t bother him at all. When he looked back at him he also reached for Dean’s hand. “Sometimes it just takes a bit of time.”
“You mean if she knew that she almost wouldn’t exist because Castiel tried to stop her parents’ wedding? I don’t think so –”
Sucking in a deep breath, Dean halted that train of thought.
mistletoe and that might have been the lamest excuse ever but Dean Winchester never claimed to be original.
Cas was most likely
His voice was barely above a whisper and he could feel the tears well up in his eyes, not even trying to repress them or hide them or anything alike.
He had to ask. He simply had to because his tired brain – that part that was still cuddled up in a warm bed with the love of his life – simply refused to make the obvious connection.
He hadn’t even realized how completely silent it had gone all around them, but he didn’t care. He was furious and the only reason he hadn’t already exploded was his daughter pressed against him. But it didn’t keep him from snapping at the women.
It was alright, for now. It would all be fine, eventually.
Even though it was just a short one – more to get warm again and rinse off than anything – Dean was unable to keep his hands to himself, at least one of them touching Cas at all times. He also unabashedly ogled every inch of him, coming to a decision when it was time to step out of the shower. As they dried up, he playfully wound his towel around Cas, pulling him closer with it and into another longing kiss before he said quietly, “That night, you asked me what I wanted.”
“We didn’t blow up anyth–”
“So, you like them?”
Somewhere in the far back of his mind, a voice whispered to him that this was not really the way to solve all the misunderstandings that were still between them. He should probably
“But I just ordered another hot chocolate.”
His thoughts circled around the same few questions, again and again, never giving him a chance to think about what he would actually say to Cas once he was standing in front of him. Therefore, it also came as a surprise when the truck finally pulled into the Shurleys’ driveway.
Before Jo could say anything, Dean jumped in: “She’s talking about Michael’s youngest brother, Castiel. The one that hasn’t been home in thirteen years.”
He might not have lost him today, but Dean knew that in just three weeks, Cas would be gone again. Would leave for his life back in New York. The thought made him want to scream, tearing at his heart.
Knowing that no matter what kind of argument he used, it would be a lost battle against this overexcited version of his daughter, Dean sighed and pulled out his phone.
… shortly after Cas would head back to New York.
Oh God. Dean would faint. All that kept him focused were those damn blue eyes. Glassy with tears, dull with defeat, and yet shining like they were the only beacon of light in a sea of darkness for Dean to focus on.
Michael’s gaze was back on him in an instant, his eyes growing harder. “Are you implying he was
“Ehm…”
Stepping up to the table, he waited for a few more heartbeats, seeing if either would notice, but neither did.
But God damnit, he
“Don’t even dare, Winchester,” Jo warned him right away, her eyes filled with fire.
As the guy’s face came into the light, Dean grimaced internally. He remembered him as one of the jocks who were assholes to Cas during school. He really could not risk him seeing Cas like this.
Or break.
He had picked up his family from
Looking around, Dean saw Gracie still occupied, happily opening the gift Michael had gotten for her, so he moved over to Sam and Eileen first.
“The helicopter,” Amara repeated matter-of-factly as if he simply hadn’t heard her. His dumbstruck face must’ve been enough to rectify that assumption, a little smile tugging at her lips. “The streets are still in terrible condition, so I took the liberty to call my company’s helicopter. It’ll drop you off at our publishing building and you can catch a cab from there.”
Sighing in frustration, Dean took a step closer to Cherry.
Trying to stay calm, Dean turned back towards Cas, holding out his hand so Cas could hand his coat for Dean to hang up. All the while, he tried to find the right words. In the end though, all he could say was the truth.
From the minimal light that filtered into the room, he could tell it was still early. He knew he hadn’t slept long, seemingly less than his usual need for four hours… and still, he somehow felt better than he had in a while.
Cas nodded, stealing another quick kiss before he let Dean continue.
For the rest of his life.
Yeah, that was one rambled mess. No wonder Cas was squinting at Dean now, eyes full of questions. If Dean was lucky, it was only curiosity about the present itself. If not, Cas was most likely able to read all his emotions, all the feelings he had for him.
After what felt like an eternity, Joshua finally spoke into the phone. “Hello, Sir. No, I’m afraid your pizza has not yet arrived. But I have a Mr. Dean Winchester down here.”
at you?”
Alice laughed and added the vanilla powder.
been a great success for the town. They had gotten more tourists and Dean knew a lot of business owners around town had benefited from that. Dean and a lot of other residents from Stars Hollow certainly wouldn’t mind a repeat of all this next year.
❄️ for sticking around for so long and not giving up on me;
“He did.”
When he’d had his fill – for now – he leaned back and simply gazed down, waiting for Cas to open those blue eyes so he could get lost in them again. He didn’t have to wait long, Cas’ eyes fluttering open, his smile instantly stretching even wider. Not a word was uttered because none were needed as Cas simply pulled him back into a long kiss, back into his embrace. Back into letting their bodies speak of the love between them.
told her about that little detail. Oh, that meant payback…
Growling, Dean pulled Cas in for a quick kiss, just to wipe that smirk off his lips. It was harder than he thought, given how Cas would hardly stop chuckling.
That promise was probably one of the easiest to ever give.
It was the simple truth and at this time of night, alone in his office, knowing that no one would ever see this doodle, Dean felt safe to put his feelings on paper. It felt good, almost liberating. Maybe it was a first step in healing his broken heart.
Since Sam’s text didn’t make sense on its own, Dean closed the chat and opened the one with Eileen, hoping for an explanation. The first message was from last night.
! I mean… what I mean is–”
“But... I believed in this legend,” Cas still went on, quite obviously not giving a flying fuck anymore about laying his heart bare. “God, did I believe in it. Because it worked for everyone else in my family – my grandparents, my parents, my aunt, my siblings, even my damn cousins –
He didn’t have to search for his favorite fountain pen - his desk was rather in order, despite what most people might think of him - and with it in hand, he read over the quote again, making sure he had memorized it enough to write somewhat fluently.
There was no hardness, no coldness, none of the walls Dean had seen these first few days.
Cas had gotten him a gift? Had really taken the time to find something for him? Had put some thought into what Dean might like and then purchased it?
No matter how hard Dean tried to tame the happy hopeful thoughts - they wouldn’t go away. Sighing in defeat and smiling about himself -
Rushing over to his discarded coat and digging around frantically, he pulled out his phone at last, answering right away and putting it to his ear.
Propping it against his wall, he took a new piece of paper, this time not starting with the stick figure but rather concentrating on drawing a nice moon. He took extra care with it, noticing how the easy task calmed him down. There was nothing elaborate about the illustration, but it was definitely recognizable as the moon. A lasso was also drawn around it but there was no space left to add a stick figure.
“What?” he croaked out. “Alice, what- no, I- no.”
“Do you have any idea what you’re doing to me? How you mess me up?”
Just as he had known it would happen, Cassie’s arm stayed blank, no words appearing whatsoever.
And Dean knew he could trust that promise. Letting go of all the tension and nervous feelings, he let himself fall back into the moment.
This should not be happening.
And then something landed in his hair.
C. S. James?”
The shiny numbers on his alarm ticked to 3:30 am and Dean sighed. He’d been awake for twenty-seven minutes, and had only slept about three hours before that. Not enough to get him through the day. Because this week had been pure hell.
All of a sudden, Gracie was gone, and Dean still stood in the middle of the diner, staring at Cas, not able to move an inch or even avert his gaze. A few heartbeats later, Cas’ eyes were on him, staring right into his soul, leaving him breathless.
Yes, he would follow Cas anywhere and yes, they had said they would talk about where they would live in the future. But for the moment, it was more about the meaning than the location, and given the amused huff of a laugh, Cas knew it as well.
As it had happened so often over the past few months, the small but nagging question of ‘what if he’s your soulmate?’ came back to him and Dean tried to ignore it. He would’ve felt it if that was the case, right? Not that Dean could really trust his instincts anyway, as Cassie had proven spectacularly.
“What?” Cas yelped, looking like Dean had scared him out of his skin as he turned back around.
Dean didn’t even look at her, his eyes stayed glued to Emma so he had an excuse not to indulge Lydia in whatever this was.
Although maybe that was just because Cas wasn’t that kind of person.
He didn’t, because he didn’t want Dean to be close. He didn’t want anything to do with him. Maybe Dean had thought about the wrong reasons for that but in the end, the reason didn’t matter. All that mattered were the facts. If it was due to hate or embarrassment, it did not matter, the bottom line stayed the same: Cas would never want him around and that was that.
going to let you walk home in your condition.”
Not that either of them truly minded the interlude.
There really wasn’t anything suspicious about the way she had said the name – not much, anyway. But it was just enough for Dean to get suspicious. Had Cas…?
~*~*~*~
When their lips touched, it was everything Dean had ever dreamed of. He hadn’t believed in all those movie cliches and TV tropes but it really felt like fireworks were exploding, like the earth broke open and the axes aligned anew. Nothing around them mattered anymore, the closeness of the man now in his arms was the only thing that counted.
“If this is supposed to be a joke, it’s not funny,” he said roughly as he led Cherry back to where Cas was standing.
“Hey, Dean,” Bart called out for him. “Need a hand with the cookies?”
Cas’ voice was filled with warmth and humor and a hint of fondness. The combination just as much as his words made Dean grin back at him as he finally turned and made his way closer. Leaning on the breakfast bar that separated the kitchen from the rest of the open floor plan, Dean confirmed, “Absolutely.”
Shaking himself out of his musings, Dean turned his attention to Kirk, helping him set up the tables that would soon hold a wide array of cookies. All the while, Kirk was his obnoxious self, measuring the tables this way and that, to assure they fit the norm and the safety procedures - not that Dean had known there was such a thing for a simple cookie sale, but whatever.
Gracie only nodded into his chest, which wasn’t all that convincing. Since he was sure she wasn’t cold, there was only one other guess Dean had.
, the romantic in him amended.
Seeing how Eileen’s deadline was already up and Sam’s text had been shortly after its end, Dean forwent texting back and hit the speed dial for Sam. His brother picked up on the second ring.
Dean’s eyes went wide at Michael’s unmasked words. It was one thing having his brother and friends know about it - but while Michael certainly counted to this category as well, it was still something different having
By the time students milled in for fourth period, it seemed that the conversation and all the info had spread around the corridors already, making for an undisturbed lesson.
Shouldn’t he have known? He
Dean was still thinking about it when Zar finally moved. There were a few words exchanged between him and Cas, something about fresh water in the jacuzzi and pizza in the kitchen, and then he finally, finally stepped into the elevator. When Cas called out to him, Dean watched as the two men exchanged a long gaze, something passing between them that Dean couldn’t quite grasp – and that he knew wasn’t meant for him anyway.
“No. No, it’s not okay. I was supposed to protect you from all of this. You shouldn’t ever have… I thought… I thought I’d been able to hide… I never wanted you to–”
to but other parts were – and he would never admit this out loud – shy about it. He was confident that it wouldn’t stay this way, not for long. There was no need to try
, want that for you as well.”
“Not that I know of.”
A kiss was pressed to his lips, tender and sweet, calming him down and only now did Dean realize that his lips had been trembling. He kissed back, chasing him when Cas moved away too quickly. His warm breath was back against Dean’s ear, sending a shiver down his spine.
“Grace, pumpkin,” Dean interrupted, waiting for his daughter to look up at him. “You know I don’t need to read your letters, right? If you’re not comfortable with–”
“You gossiping harpies! I’ve told you: Stop judging Cas for what he did! He’s certainly been braver than you’ll ever be.”
“Alright, if you insist.”
While Charlie and Gracie babbled on, Dean tried to mull over Jo’s words. What did she say had been her next steps? Starting to explore? Maybe he should do that as well. Or maybe he should ask Sam and Eileen to take Grace tonight so he could get to Hartford. Get to a club and …
grow up and get over their schoolboy crush.” Jo already opened her mouth, but Dean was faster. “And embarrassed? Why would he be embarrassed?”
Which, of course, he didn’t, that stubborn man.
Grace answered with her typical sarcastic, “Ha ha,” yet after rolling her eyes, she actually joined in when Cas started to chuckle, apparently neither of them feeling the need to let Dean in on the joke.
“Point being,” Claire continued as if he hadn’t said anything. “The whole situation was pretty funny to watch, especially when your two uh...
He wanted so much more and in this very moment, his yearning for C was more desperate than it had ever been.
definitely sounded like something he would enjoy with a woman…
“Dad? I know you’re in there. I know you didn’t take Cherry out for a ride. Please, can I come in?”
“Dad!”
Not to be outdone, Miss Patty chortled in joy, “About time, young man! Tell us, who’s the lucky lady?”
When Cas said no more, a pleased hum the only sound he made, Dean finally devoured him to his heart’s desire. He began to kiss down his neck and along his collarbone, throwing in a soft nip here and there. Cas’ right hand was in Dean’s hair and he relished the soft tugs and the tingling of finger nails digging into his skin. He wondered where Cas’ left hand was – until he remembered that stupid cast. Right away, Dean let his lips wander to Cas’ left side, leaving a slow trail of light kisses from his shoulder, down the healing skin of his left arm. He didn’t touch the cast again, knowing just how much the thing annoyed Cas. Surely, no further reminder was needed.
For a few more seconds, Dean ran around his apartment, almost headless. He was about to meet his soulmate! It was finally happening and it was all because he’d been gushing about another guy and hadn’t filtered pronouns and suddenly…
Dean bit his lip, not entirely sure how to even write what he had to say.
At her last words, a grin stole itself on Dean’s face as he looked up at her, both dragons carefully balanced in his hands. “You mean without annoying princes to come by and kill them?”
Still gnawing on his lip, Dean thought about lying for a second – but this was his soulmate and the last thing Dean wanted to do was lie to them.
“Good morning.”
Not when Cas smiled at him and easily joked around and laughed about something funny Dean said. Not when Dean found Cas staring at Gracie with so much adoration and love in his eyes that Dean was sure that Cas would do just about anything for his daughter.
to stay faithful to his promise with C. Hell, he
Without saying another word, Dean pulled off his scarf and, placing one end on Cas’ right, uninjured arm. He wrapped the scarf around the cradled elbow, allowing Cas to take his hand away. Tucking the scarf around the elbow, Dean brought the end back up and knotted it on Cas’ good shoulder, checking the fit and comfort.
As he started the video again, he allowed his mind to remember Cas’ smile. To see his face. To imagine it being him - not only in the video but also the one who was currently sliding their hand down his stomach to reach into his boxers. To imagine Cas as the one wrapping his hand around Dean’s cock, freeing it from its confines with a sure grip.
“Cas...”
around each other. I... we were friends once. And I know the last time we talked with each other like friends you were still a kid because after that I had to be your teacher, but... can’t we just
[Eileen 11.36pm] Dean, seriously, call us! Michael texted that Gracie kept Cas from leaving. How is she? And how are you? If you need to talk, we’re here for you. I’m here for you! I even promise not to tell Sam anything we’ll discuss.
“Yes,” Cas replied.
The uneasy silence between them grew, getting under his skin, pushing for him to speak.
any of this just lying around, didn’t want to risk Cas seeing it and being reminded of the terrible moment. So he had taken it with him.
“Grace?”
“– but I really think you should ask him. Talk this out.”
“How so?”
“You wrote to Cas?”
A piercing laugh ripped out of Cas. “Are you fucking kidding me?”
Coming to his senses, Dean’s hand on Cas’ arm suddenly felt like it was burning, despite the coldness that grew between them. Slowly, he let go of the man, his hand dropping down in defeat, no idea any longer what to do.
While Cas didn’t say anything, his grin grew wider, telling Dean all he needed to know. Instead of getting lost in those mesmerizing blue eyes, Dean focused back on the book once he freed it of its wrapping. It was a small paperback, old by the looks of it but very well taken care of. Like something one would find in an old bookshop, an antique store or better yet, in the collection of a booklover. Reading the title Dean had to think for a moment before his eyes went wide.
When Youtube suggested a few scenes from
Avoiding any kind of reply for as long as possible, Dean took a long sip of his whiskey. Once the glass rested on his knee again and a reply was unavoidable, he slowly nodded.
“It’s... it’s this stupid legend and the taste of those damn cookies. It’s the smell that reminds me of... of
Was he really going to go down that path? Was he really about to… well, give in?
A soft knock against his door pulled him out of his thoughts.
When his laptop rang, indicating the incoming skype call, he took one last breath and then sat down on his couch.
“The wrapped one first,” he finally said, pulling his hand away and himself out of his thoughts, which were racing a mile a minute, not helpful at all to calm down those damn butterflies. “The thing in the card is... the real present, so...”
Dean tried - he really,
Was it really normal that he was thinking about his friend so much?
Turning the car around, he stopped shortly to send a text to Sam, telling him he’d be there soon, then he made his way back home; relieved to see that he had gone somewhat in a wide circle and wasn’t too far from the ranch.
It appeared not to be good enough, though. “I think I’ll pass,” Cas replied, moving forward, obviously wanting to get inside.
Cas was coming home.
But what?
At first, Dean ignored the hushed giggles and the excited tension lurking in the air. It was Monday after all, something probably happened on the weekend. Not to speak of the fact that Christmas was just around the corner.
It was Max who asked the back-up question.
Dean counted it as a win that Cas stopped for a moment, obviously thinking about Dean’s argument.
really was the best present for her this year.
“I didn’t say that.”
“First step: Pizza?” he asked and Cas nodded, taking the offered towel and wound it around his hips. Dean did the same and together, they left the bathroom to get some food into their system. He had an inkling that they would need all the carbohydrates they could get.
“Maybe,” Cas replied, smile clear in his voice. “Will you let your Christmas present count?”
In an effort to drown the tiny seed of a guilty feeling but mostly to get them back to their previous good mood and banter, Dean stole another bite from Gracie’s pie. Just then, Luke appeared on his other side and put down a piece of what appeared to be cherry pie in front of him.
“Good girl,” he told her when she finally snorted softly into his jacket and stood still.
weird to have gone for forty years of his life only to suddenly realize that there was this whole side of desires that he never knew about, right? He thought so at least.
“Sammy, I gotta go. Dinner’s ready. Give my love to Eileen.”
Especially when the answer to all that - to everything - was.
As always, Dean was not able to fool his friends, their gazes growing worried right away.
“It’s alright,” Luke said, awkwardly patting her shoulder as he looked back at Dean with wide eyes. “Ehm,” he added, turning back to Grace. “I didn’t read it, of course. Oh, and he also asked me to make sure you don’t forget about the gift certificate. So once school starts back up, I expect you to keep coming in to wait for your dad, you hear me?”
? Feel comfortable, I mean.” Dean’s deepening frown must’ve shown Cas that his question was confusing, because he quickly went on, “With us– no! I mean with
“Whoa, calm down,” he therefore told his friends, a bit more serious now. “Don’t worry. The secret is safe with us. And hey, we’re basically family, right?” he added, still grinning in a feeble attempt to keep the light mood. There were bystanders all around them, after all, as well as his kids.
“That’s not …” Dean started and didn’t know how to go on, shocked into silence. It seemed he really needed to select his words more carefully with Cas. Sighing, he pushed away from the frame, deciding to stop hiding behind jokes and cocky behavior. “That’s not what I meant, Cas. I’m sorry. I just … I came here to talk to you.”
“Wait, what?” Dean heard his brother’s surprised yell before he himself could reply to Cas’ revelation and everyone’s attention turned to Sam. He was looking back at Cas with a startled expression. “
And oh yes, good. Let’s move on and far away from the topic of a young teacher forcing himself to not think about one of his students…
He was thinking about Cas so much that, when he looked up to see a figure entering the bookstore theater, he was sure it was merely a case of wishful thinking. Or maybe he had summoned the man himself, he thought as he blinked. Because slipping into the doors was none other than the man of his most recent dreams, there was no doubt. Dean would recognize that posture, that figure, anywhere.
The fact that he had
Without another word, he turned Cherry back around, kicking her into a slow canter, knowing it would be the smoothest of her faster gaits. Walking would be too slow, a trot too uneven for Cas’ dislocated shoulder, and a gallop was out of the question with two of them on her back. It didn't take him long to notice that Cas was struggling to hold on tight. His left hand was useless after all and no matter how much Dean tried to support him, there was only so much he could do.
There was simply
With a last smile in her direction, Dean turned around and quickly moved the few yards across the street and towards the
“Yeah, well,” Dean said, trying not to let the words get to him - did Cas think badly of him now? Did it remind him of that day at the church, when he had essentially blown
At least, that was the definition he had always gone by. And seeing how other men still held no interest for him, right now it felt the safest to stick to it. There would be time in the future to fully dive into the discussion of what to label his sexuality – if he so desired – but this was not that time.
? I mean, the fact that you didn’t want to let me help you while badly injured – it killed me, okay? And I,” Dean added, struggling still to find the words. When he couldn't find them, he finally gave up. “I don’t know. Just...”
“Cas, what’s going on?” Dean asked, not even pretending to buy into his shit.
19 (first section)
told you?”
“Cas, I’m sorry.”
“Great, we’ll see you there, then.”
Thankfully, Cas looked rather intrigued by Dean’s statement, and not hurt.
As if in a horrible déjà vu, he saw the tears well up in Cas’ eyes, just before the man bowed his head, turned around, and ran.
“I had many years to learn it,” Cas replied to something Eileen must have said and that Dean had completely missed. What he didn’t miss was the cute smile on Cas’ face.
why his brain wouldn’t let him rest.
Groaning, Dean swung his legs over the side of the bed and sat there for a moment. He hadn’t thought about Cas that much in ages.
Thanks to the heating system inside the barn, it indeed was…
“Oh, come
He was sure he wanted to apologize and the more he thought about it, the more he realized he also wanted to know about Cas’ life. He’d wondered about it in the past and he would love to … to have his friend back?
“What do you mean? We’ve talked all through dinner.”
Despite the many helping hands, it still took some time to put all the dishes in the sink or directly in the dishwasher, to wrap up all the leftovers and store them, and to wipe clean the tables so the dining room was left in a semi-orderly state.
“And the next time I hear
“Grace…”
Speaking of kids, in yet another attempt to lighten the mood, Dean pushed Gracie in front of him, as if using her as a shield. He knew just how much his daughter had all the Shurleys wrapped around her finger. Surely, Gabe and Cas would forgive at least
“Oh– my god!” Charlie breathed out, Jo only nodding as if in agreement until Charlie turned to her. “Did he just say…?!”
“Gotta take this, just a moment,” he said, answering the phone. “Hey, what’s up?”
“I wouldn’t know what we have to talk about.”
“Yes.”
“Hey, pumpkin.”
“Should we continue this inside?” he asked, already worrying about Cas’ wellbeing. Besides… he
What broke out of him in the end, really wasn’t that much better, but, well, at least he had tried.
Dean hated flying. He really hated it – but this trip with a helicopter?
Amara gave her niece a loving smile.
With that, Dean slipped through the door and hastily made his way to his car, leaving Cas behind him, wishing that they wouldn’t have to interact with each other very often for the next few weeks.
he could do.
“I know.”
“What?” Dean bit out. Yes, he had certainly reached his breaking point, still sick with worry for Cas and fed up with his constant inappropriate thoughts. “What would you do?”
“Cas, that’s crazy,” Dean replied, getting a tad angry now. It seemed Cas had remembered his hatred for Dean at last and at the worst possible moment. So much so, apparently, that he wasn’t willing anymore to get help from him. Well, Dean wouldn’t stand for that. “I am
It wasn’t until they drew closer to the city limits of Stars Hollow and thus the road that led to the ranch, that Dean turned to look at Cas, squeezing his thigh to make sure he had his attention.
And wasn’t that telling, he thought.
Love you all,
Dean closed his eyes, trying to stave off the pain those words brought with them. Not only about the prospect of Cas leaving and possibly never returning. But also about Chuck’s situation. He didn’t admonish his friend for it, they all knew it to be true. They might be together and celebrating and laughing and enjoying Christmas time. But underneath it all, they all knew what would come very soon.
“Look, I... I also came here, because... damnit,” he interrupted himself, pushing a hand through his hair. Then he tried anew. Honesty was the key.
“Oh yeah?” Dean challenged, slowly starting to be pissed off. “Did he tell you he actually has a boyfriend back in New York?”
Dean tried not to be distracted too much by what had happened this morning. Especially not when he met Gracie and Cas later on, joining them once more. Instead, he enjoyed their exchange and the talk about Cas’ book. While they did so, Dean was amazed by how his daughter made sure not to let it slip that she knew about Cas’ secret identity.
Cheating was so far on top of his
“That I couldn’t lose the love of my life again,” Cas deadpanned and… alright, fair.
Dean was quick to join into the general ‘love you’s and ‘goodbye’s but internally facepalmed himself for missing so much of the conversation because he had been day-dreaming about something that most likely would never happen.
“We know that, too, Dean,” Alice assured him right away, taking his hand into hers again. “We’re not here to judge. Or to accuse you that you didn’t love our daughter. We know you did.”
One more misunderstanding between them and Dean would probably go crazy. He was further reassured when Cas pressed another kiss to Dean’s lips but despite the fact that he apparently wanted this as well, he didn’t let Dean deepen the kiss. Instead, he leaned back again and said, “I’ve wanted this with you for so long. But Dean, you…”
“I could never,” Dean whispered, finally finding his words again. “Lisa will always be in my heart.”
When his hand wandered to Cas’ neck to draw him back in, Cas melted against him right away, the kiss no longer interrupted by his chuckles. It might have been cold outside… but it definitely wasn’t too cold for a second round.
And Dean lost it.
“No. No fucking way, get it together.”
“What? Oh God, no. No Gracie, don’t think that.” Leaning up, Dean pulled her into a hug, neither of them caring for the awkward angle. “I loved your mother. I still do.”
But thanks to the nice warmth blanketing them, he let himself enjoy the view, his gaze following his hand as it roamed over Cas’ skin.
Dean took the beer but otherwise ignored him.
“So, is this a new study group I don’t know about?”
“Grace! What happened?”
“Are you kidding?” Dean exclaimed, reaching for Cas’ hand. “I’m… I’m
He needed to hit something, he needed to let it out before it ripped him in half. Before the pain of his broken heart would kill him. He just wanted to take a sledgehammer and hit something.
He decided that could wait until the morning…
Damnit, Cas wasn’t supposed to distract him to the degree that he was an asshole to his students and not listening to his daughter anymore.
Cas was waiting in the other room and every second he wasn’t with him was pure torture.
At least, he tried to.
I know some of you have both stories open to read them side by side. If you do and you downloaded AC at one point, I would like to ask you to please refresh it. My dearest beta

, he didn’t like it.
And to say he
Instead, Dean tugged Cas’ hand and once he had pulled his attention from where Cas was still fondly watching Gracie, Dean nodded towards the barn door. They told Gracie good night and headed outside, bracing the storm once more. Dean was relieved to notice that even with the addition of the battering wind, Cas’ footing seemed more sure than when he’d first arrived, maybe even back to normal if it hadn’t been for the ice and snow. He was sure there was still a little bit alcohol left in his system – but he didn’t appear drunk anymore.
God, in hindsight, it made so much sense to Dean; it made sense that Cas would accuse him of that. He had been a fool – but he also hadn’t known how else to handle it.
wouldn’t mind us being seen like that?”
“No.”
At first, Cas only laughed. After a moment, though, he pulled Dean in for another kiss – this one already more heated.
“Oh, wow! Jo, he didn’t even deny it.”
He was pretty sure that Gracie was asleep before the door was even fully closed.
His lover made a noise to show he had heard him but otherwise didn’t bother to move his head from where it rested on Dean’s chest.
So worried, she hadn’t said anything about it when Dean had tried to cheer
After thirty minutes, the second shift took over and Dean was amazed by how the time flew by. Looking up and around, he tried to maybe get a glimpse of Cas and Gracie. They should be back from their sleigh ride by now. But the town square and the streets around it were packed to the brim, leaving him no chance to see anything.
“Cas, buddy, what’s going on?”
“I’ve been meaning to ask.”
Dean scoffed at that, getting up. Not to run away but because he could feel the anger begin to bubble up inside of him again. He paced a few steps before leaning against the handrail opposite the swing, facing Michael. He crossed his arms in a defensive manner and glared at his friend.
When he feared Gracie would get impatient and go on, he finally turned towards her.
“This place totally suits you,” he commented after a while, still looking around instead of at Cas, who was currently working in the kitchen heating up their pizzas. He didn’t see it but he was sure he now had the man’s gaze fixed on him, so he continued. “It has style, looks classy, and still has a touch of coziness.”
“Alright,” came the whisper and somehow, it calmed him even further. “I got you,” Cas promised. “Just relax, I got you.”
Sitting down, he opened the book and browsed through the pages, stopping here and there, smiling at the memories. His search ended when the book fell open at the section with the portraits, a handful of papers pressed between the pages. Putting them aside for the moment, Dean looked closer at one portrait in particular.
Though that reminded him…
Michael nodded. “Yes, he did. I mean, no details, mind you–”
He didn’t actually know what to say and thankfully, Cas stopped him right away.
Her question made him hesitate for all of two heartbeats, before he grumbled, “What’s that supposed to mean?”
“And why the hell not?”
“Hell yeah, she is.”
“Charlie!”
“Hey, man, look. Maybe I wasn’t your teacher for long, but it was certainly long enough to know you have a very distinctive style when you write. Your voice certainly has evolved from when you were a teen, but... it’s still there.”
and it wasn’t even the worst feeling. The worst was feeling like he had hurt Cas again. Like it was Dean’s fault that he had been untrue to the guy in New York. He knew it was stupid, Cas was a grown man, he had definitely been on board, so if that resulted in cheating then that decision was on Cas… but still…
The words stung in his chest but he refused to let it sit and fester. Instead, he moved to his daughter and sat next to her on the bed. Immediately, she crawled up to him and curled into his side.
He wasn’t ready to see her tears or her anger or her disappointment or really
“Damn, you’re already freezing, aren’t you?”
, offended Vonnegut.
“Will you stay in contact with him as well?”
“You don’t have to –”
Was that what Lydia–
“Yes, it is,” Dean agreed sweetly. “What are you up to? Not gossiping again, are we?”
Not that he was thinking about ever seeing Cas naked.
For the first time, he fully understood what Cas had meant when he told him that the smell alone reminded him of
“Thank you, pumpkin. I really needed to hear all that.”
When he said, “Thank you. You have no idea what this means to me. I… thank you.”
not in front of his in-laws.
Once the last student had left his classroom, Dean sank down into his chair, just staring straight ahead. Today had been the worst so far, and he didn’t even know what made him more moody: the thing with Cas, or the fact that Gracie was mad at him. Since he couldn’t really do anything about Grace’s mood, other than ask for her forgiveness once more and then maybe bribe her with some hot chocolate, Dean’s thoughts quickly wandered towards Cas, papers on his table all but forgotten.
He knew one thing for sure, though. Cas would certainly go through with his threat. So it was probably best to just listen to him and take him to the mansion as quickly as possible. Someone there ought to be awake already. They would be able to drive him to the hospital.
Instead of a verbal reply, Dean had to wait only a few seconds – until suddenly, he could feel his skin tingle in other places than his usual left arm. It started on his shoulder and right away, Dean realized what C was doing. One after another, rainbow flags of all sizes appeared all over his body, vanishing as soon as he saw them, making room for more, for bigger and brighter ones.

This chapter focuses heavily on Dean's past relationship with Lisa and his feelings for her. From previous reactions I know that some of my readers are not happy about this - but Dean
Dean tried not to look hurt, thankful for his brother as he jumped in and greeted Cas as well, then introduced him to Eileen. All the while, Dean tried not to get whiplash from how fast his heart had gone from racing to heavy with the formal and cold way Cas had greeted him. After all, wasn’t this one of the possible scenarios he’d played out in his head? He’d known the possibility that Cas still hated him had been high, and now all that had happened was the confirmation of his fears.
“Yes,” she replied without hesitation, her smile wide and earnest.
Getting ready for school was routine, the two of them not thinking about the day ahead, instead enjoying their thoughts about the holidays that would begin once the school bell rang for the final time that day.
“Yeah,” he agreed, finally putting into words what he feared the most. “But you’re here right now and I’m not risking you running away. Not again, Cas. Not ever again.”
angry with her about it, especially when he usually failed to keep his smile off his face. “Come on, the others are waiting already.”
Once he'd dropped her off at Miss Patty's dance studio, Dean made his way over to the town square to see if there were a few last minute things that needed to be taken care of. He ended up helping Kirk with the stage decoration, Taylor Doose running around with his checklists and driving them all crazy. As was so often with these things, no matter how early preparation started, there was always last minute shit that went wrong or was missing.
“Wanna play dumb and have me drag it out of you anyway or just cut the crap?”
“Dean –”
Dean waited until Cas had come to rest once more – enjoying the new view Cas’ turning now gave him. Cas’ cock was already half-erect and without really noticing, Dean licked his lips. He had gotten a taste of it already, yes, but so far he had been hesitant to try more.
Luke nodded and as he stood in the open door, he seemed to carefully think about his next words before he spoke them. “Look, Dean. I don’t know what caused him to leave all of a sudden. And it’s certainly not my business. But I’m not the only one who has seen the impact that man had on Grace. Or on you, to be honest. I haven’t seen either of you so carefree, not like you’ve been these past few days, in a long while. So whatever it is or was, I really hope you’ll figure it out. For all of you.”
Dean gave himself another moment to smile at himself - yep, he was totally gone on the guy. There really was no denying it any longer, not even with all the typical Dean Winchester defense mechanism in full play - then picked up the other boxes full of Angel Cookies and followed Cas back to their families.

Taking a new piece of paper, he tried his hand at copying the picture Mary Bailey had of George lassoing the moon for her. Okay, well… in Dean’s picture, it was nothing more than a stick figure that held a lasso, which in return was wound around the moon, and Dean was sure even a ten-year-old would be able to draw this better… but he kinda liked it.
It touched a core inside of Dean… but he found he wasn’t mad at Cas for making Gracie worry. He was simply relieved to have him back at their side.
“My soulmate thinks your idea is funny and approves of it.”
for Cas’ departure. Getting proof now that that wasn’t the case eased some of the pain away. With a sigh, he pulled her closer and rested his head on her hair.
Dean ignored his weird thoughts once again, focusing on what Cas had to say. “My best friend’s sister is deaf and the two of them lived with me for a while.”
“Good morning,” he mumbled against Cas’ lips, pulling him into a loose embrace.
had made Cas this happy.
“Dean, please,” she interrupted, raising one hand in an appeasing gesture. “There really is no need for that. Misunderstandings happen, that’s life and a part of human nature. I, for one, don’t think you did anything wrong.”
Dean nodded, quickly leaning down to Gracie.
“Dean, where do you want the tables?”
Before Dean could ask, Michael once more beat him to it.
God, he wanted to kiss him.
Had he passed him without realizing?
Gracie’s high-pitched scream finally pulled Dean out of his musings and more than that, it silenced the room. Everyone watching on as Gracie threw herself into Cas’ arms, tackling the poor man to the ground while screaming into his ear. “Thank you! Thankyouthankyouthankyou! Oh my God, this is the best present ever. Oh my God, thank you!”
to learn? - so he continued in English. “I’m good, thanks.”
Dean could see that he quickly tried to school his feature - but the whole moment
Of all the terrible and stupid things Dean had
He couldn’t stop himself, couldn’t hold back anymore. Those lips… he wanted to feel them so badly. The air around him felt like it had been electrified, and it felt inevitable that they would lean in. That their lips would meet. Like this moment was always meant to happen, right here, right now. Dean would kiss Cas and everything,
“So should I,” the guy replied, his voice shooting right through Dean. It was dark and rough and Dean really tried to convince himself that the shiver running down his spine only had to do with the cold November air and nothing with the stranger standing in front of him.
Cas looked as though it didn’t matter anymore what he was about to say, or even that he was saying it.
By the time Sam and he had cleaned up the table, Eileen had already gotten them two beers and a glass of red wine for herself.
His mom and dad hadn’t been thrilled all that much about that perspective – but C had told him to go for it if that’s where his heart was.
Letting go of a deep breath, Dean looked back over his shoulder to see Cas still on the phone, then he finally turned his attention to the bay and the ongoing birth of a new life. Sam caught his gaze but they both knew it was best for them to not bring too much disturbance by switching places now. Dr. Richardson would let Dean know if she needed any more help.
“You know he doesn’t have a boyfriend. Don’t tease him like that.”
For breaking his belief.
This time, their friends weren’t calling from Charlie’s laptop while still at the hotel. When the call connected, the two of them were squeezed tight together, obviously calling from a phone. They were wrapped up in thick scarfs and beanies – Charlie’s in Gryffindor red and gold whilst Jo wore her favorite green set (which she adamantly ignored to label as ‘Slytherin’-colors even though everyone in the family knew she totally was a Snake) – and their faces were flushed from the cold, their smiles wide and beaming.
Remembering the conversation with Cas hurt so much, but there was one thing he let himself focus on.
one out yet?”
“Weeeelll, if this isn’t a little Heaven on Earth,” a familiar voice called out.
If that was all they had ever been destined to be, Dean would take it.
When Caesar appeared, Dean ordered himself some pie and coffee. Maybe after his favorite food, the world would look different. He was halfway through devouring the delicious cherry pie when he realized Eileen’s eyes had never left him, still boring into his soul. Not shying away from her gaze, he hoped it would get her off his agenda.
“I have my sources,” Cas simply stated, leaving it at that.
The only mother he had ever really known.
Compared to the past two weeks, Dean was certain that his mood had not been this good in a while.
Gabe – nope. Nice guy, and Dean certainly liked him. But no.
“Grandma, there’s no such thing as
“Did I have another choice?” Brushing his hand over his face, Dean sighed before sitting up as he continued talking. “At least she took it pretty well. She was more worried about Cas than anything else.”
“I… well.”
“You don’t need to tell me that you want me to be happy, Dad. I know that. You show me. Every day, you show me. But I think it’s time you see that I can, and
Cas simply rolled his eyes. “Ha ha, very funny.”

would already know about Cas’ accident. Trying not to let it get to him, Dean leaned back against the railing.
Cas treated her like his friend, and it was that difference which made Dean sure Gracie had confided things in Cas she hadn’t with any of them. After all his girl had been through, he was glad she had him. Seeing her now, he could tell she had gotten the light back inside her that had been missing for a long time.
“Aren’t you forgetting one more thing?”
“Because I was
Dean sure as hell wanted to try.
Suddenly, it all made sense.
It was a constant push and pull and every time he thought he and Cas had taken a step forward, there was something throwing them back. Just this Saturday, he had finally admitted to himself the

“Cherry’s seventeen and a half damn hands high,
Wait, what had she said?
He had no idea, and quite frankly? He didn’t care to find out.
Despite his forced calmness, his voice was still bathed with authority. He knew his students hated this voice. Probably as much as he hated using it. But he wanted - no, he
“Hey, I was the one to start it,” Dean jumped to his defense without hesitation, shutting Gabe up. “It’s one of the greatest movies in existence, let us nerd about it.”
This was simply Cas, and Dean could finally and fully let himself accept that he was more than just attracted to him.
“Some of us went to the Winter fair...”
There was a long moment of silence, Claire looking around the classroom. Dean could see and feel the barely suppressed excitement. Man, if his students were as excited about Vonnegut and Shakespeare as they were about gossip and his private life, it would make his job
Ran away.
Wiping away the tiredness from his face, Dean blindly reached for the pen he had left lying next to his pillow.
“Thank you, really. It’s a sweet thought.”
“Oh, that’s nice of him.”
The call came around ten in the morning, Dean reluctantly telling Grace that yes, they would be back soon. Part of him wanted to stay in this bubble, this happy place he and Cas had created the past two days. But he knew they had to turn back to reality at one point and after looking down at Cas who was curled up in his lap, arms possessively wound around Dean’s middle, looking just as reluctant to let go but nodding nonetheless, Dean promised his daughter that they would head back home today.
