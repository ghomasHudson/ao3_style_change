Sherlock raises his head; his eyes still half-closed, voice deep, and hoarse from yesterdays’ drinks.
“The last time I saw Mrs. Morstan was four months ago, Mr. Holmes. I’m sorry but I really don’t know what you’re talking about"
‘Sure,’ he smiles without mirth, pops a candy into his mouth, and looks out at the gardens in front of him.
‘The meeting was almost done with. We have said everything that we needed to say to one another. I just left earlier.’
‘I’m going to…have lunch now! Sherlock has to make those…boring researches about Seraphita names..so..I was wondering if you’ looking at Greg 'would like to have lunch with me?’
A bevy of police cars are outside Baker Street, along with Emergency Medical Services, and Bomb Squads. Lestrade pauses at the mess outside the living room door while listening to Mrs. Hudson.
‘Yes,…sure,…go’ Sherlock stands still for a while, staring at the floor, thinking, taking a long breath
‘Okay, I might be jealous, but your face! The look into your face when I heard you said ‘John’ while you were moaning, it said everything, you understood I heard it and you didn’t know how to sneak off’
‘Look…he signed up with his real name,’ Sherlock interrupts the exchange and gestures to the  booking form.
Mycroft stands up and walks in the kitchen towards his brother ‘Just checking if you’re okay, how do you feel?’
He nods “are you going to stay with him?...tonight?........ok,....call me if something happens, ok?...thank you, bye." Sherlock turns the phone off and looks through the window: it starts raining again.
He stops her, grabbing her by the shoulder “Wait, where are you going? are you okay?” he peers at her, frowning confused.
Victor walks in, still upset, swallowing nervously “Molly...this is a copy of the voice mail” He hands her a usb.
“How does he feel?” A low, scratched voice talks to Mrs. Hudson throughout the phone, she’s sitting on the chair, next to the table. Her left arm on her temple, face down, speaking in a low voice.
He places the bathrobe near the tub and helps Sherlock stand. Then, once he is out, Mycroft helps his brother put the bathrobe on. Sherlock, sleeved arms crossed snuggly against his chest, walks toward his bedroom.
‘It’s up to you, Sherlock. Everyone’s invited you home; decide which house you will sleep at tonight. Any of them, except this one, for God’s sake!’
‘You don’t know anything.’ The man says, his expression and tone dulling significantly, as he calms.
“Ok, ok..I got it. keep calm, you’re just...confused. I think you’re simply confused. Before Victor and now Mary. She works for the CIA, if she knew something she would told us, just like the photos she gave us. If something comes up about the case she will be the first to know it, and she’ll let us know." trying to comfort him, but John looks still confused and worried, not convinced. “Okay...” he replies, turning toward the window cab for one last time before getting off.
The quip shuts Lestrade up with an annoyed look on his face. Molly twists to stare at him for answers, but none are given. Sherlock is just happy that he’s made someone else miserable too. The old saying is true, it does love company. Just when Sherlock's reveling in his satisfaction, John suddenly stands up and calls everyone's attention. He's looking around at all the guests in the ballroom with a huge smile.
‘Yes, that one Mary gave us before didn’t work’ Sherlock answers not looking John into his eyes, just keeping eating.
Sherlock turns toward her, arranging the scarf ‘It was the alarm Mrs Hudson, it went on because Lestrade was inside’
‘So I thought it was destiny that was gently saying to me I had to take a break with men, so I decided I’ll focus on my work and myself’
Sherlock is lying on the sofa, still sleeping, while a thin beam of light shines through the window, reaching his angular face and gently showing his curly hair and his profile to John, who smiles looking at him. Sherlock slowly wakes up, smelling John's perfume next to him, his head is still spinning from the cries he shared with John last night. He turns, looking at the living room: the fireplace is lighten, and a gently smell of coffee and croissants crowds the room. He knows who's there.
Molly is sitting on the backseat, in the center, looking straight at the street, a bit embarrassed for the silence , Greg drives tapping with his fingers on the steering wheel, and moving his head at time while listening to the music, then turns the volume up.
. I suggest to listen to the songs I add to understand better the mood and the meaning of the fic. To listen to a song, simply click right mouse button and 'open link to a new window'. Hope you'll like it. Thanks for reading. Anny.
Sherlock runs in the woman’s office. John follows, trying to convince him to leave the soup kitchen. The woman starts running toward them, shouting, but Sherlock rises his voice ‘Your husband was an illegal surgeon, he changed the faces of the most dangerous killers and thieves of London! He did the same with Moran, the one who killed him one month after the surgery!’
‘Mycroft...I can’t come back at Baker Street, he wanted me back at Baker Street but I can’t, ... things can’t be like they were two years ago,...he’s changed’
He sees his brother, sleeping unconsciously. Next to him there's Greg, half-asleep, sitting on a chair with his head down, snoring. The door creaks a bit, and Greg wakes up, shaking his head, trying to focus.
“But...you can just drop by and have a look, just to listen to our poems..You also wrote one! Why don’t you read it?”
John’s trying to fix the air conditioning ‘I mean…we haven’t exactly found him yet, but we know he changed his identity when he faked his death two years ago.’
'Thank you' Victor looks at the woman standing on the chair, decorating the wall. Molly turns, suddenly her face turns red, freezing. She loses control, falling down the chair.
‘I’m not blaming Sherlock, I’m blaming you’ going in the living room. John turns and follows her, trying to arrange some comforting words ‘We..we can have another holiday! I’ll make you choose the destination, okay?’
‘No, as you know I was there because Mycroft told me I had to go to Baker Street, so I took the taxi and-‘
Sherlock opens the letter slowly, stepping a bit away from John. He glances at him before reading the note quickly, then closes it, and puts it on the counter near the fridge.
‘Where are your slacks?’ Mycroft stormily huffs, slamming the drawer shut. Frustrated, he marched from the bedroom to the kitchen, taking up his phone which he has earlier discarded atop the dining table.
John doesn’t reply, staring at the laptop, embarrassed. Then nods. “..mm...yeah. Listen, I was trying to write and update my blog, but...I don’t know if we have the situation clear..I was trying to recollect everything, from the beginning: I was shot."
But the phone rings again. This time John grabs at the phone by moving nothing but his left arm, and reads the message.
‘Sherlock, there are hundreds of fans out there for you’ Mrs. Hudson says to Sherlock, who doesn’t turn to look. He’s still eyeing the fridge.
‘She hasn’t, and I’m sorry. I’ll inform my colleagues and the dean, we have to print a missing poster and alert everyone.’
"Don't be so optimistic, John, they've always been like this, after all, the Holmes brothers will never change"
‘DO YOU THINK THIS IS TIME TO TALK ABOUT THIS? YOUR BROTHER IS DYING! GIVE ME THE ADRENALINE AND SORT THIS FUCKING SHIT OUT LATER!’
‘I was so obsessed with writing and poetry, I….’ cracking a laugh ‘I was so…..young, and optimistic, didn’t it bother you?’
A puzzled look flashes quickly across Sherlock face, before being wiped clean into his usual mask of haughtiness.
'Wow, nice! This’ll be my night Sherlock! We’re going to have fun, I can feel it!’ John crows excitedly over the noisy thump of bass blaring throughout the club.
‘We could…we could take Tanaka’s clue, and try to figure out who killed him, maybe this will bring us to Moran?’ John queries, looking between Sherlock and Lestrade.
Mycroft glances at the pages on the table, randomly leafing them with his thumb, talking slowly ‘You.....You never heard him talk of.....Victor Trevor?’
"Victor was a human being!" Sherlock rises his voice, angrily. "Not your puppet! And Sarah! You killed all those people because you were afraid they could reveal your identity! You wanted to create a fake world in which you could live with John, and your son. Moriarty's son. I've seen him: you brought him to the cemetery when Sarah died."
John “He’s not in love with him! He’s using him!! That’s....” grinning “...incredible...really! it is...!"
‘Here - sit here.’ Mycroft insists, slowly removing Sherlock’s arm from his shoulder. Confused, Sherlock inhabits the bed sheets. Though he sits straight, his sight is hazy.
A nurse goes toward the doctor, he turns to her “Get Holmes, he must have surgery right now.” “Why?” she asks, doubtful.
‘Of course he had! It’s in my office! How do you think he could remember all the appointments with his patients??’
John finishes cleaning the table and leaves the sponge, to go take out the trash. He walks out the door and puts it near the stairs, then stares at the street a moment. Just before he starts walking back, his phone buzzes.
‘They were in bedroom!!!And then when I opened the door his friend left and Sherlock said goodbye to him and I left, I was….you know I was embarrassed!!! And then Sherlock put something on and he went into the kitchen and then I called Mycroft who arrived minutes later..’ He huffs out, nervous, sweating, his face still red.
John joins the conversation, poking fun at Victor 'Stop spying on him, Victor is simply a beautiful guy who loves baking, write romantic poetry and teach French Literature, what's wrong about it??' Sherlock really.....loves him, and he clearly....care about Victor!!!' John laughs, looking around.
‘it’s okay now, I’m here, we’ll go away, don’t worry, it’s all over now, It’s all over’ He puts his left arm around his back, the other one on his legs, bringing him out the taxi and sitting on the sidewalk. John is in his arms, his eyes almost closed, whispering random words, Sherlock is sweating nervously. He takes his phone, but there are signal boots problem, so puts a hand on John’s pocket, taking his’, reading a message he has just received.
‘No, we’ll make the East Tour, it’s Indri, Green, Nest of Dream, and Zahamena’ Mary says to Molly. ‘We decided on that part of the island because it’s very rich in fauna and flora, and because it’s where Madagascar has its rainforest.’
‘We don’t need to talk. We don’t need long conversations to understand each other, I look at him and I understand everything, and it’s the same for him....’
‘You’re famous, too, now, you can’t do these kind of things, somebody would call the press and the next day your nudes would be on the papers’
‘Sherlock never grew up, John. There’s always a part of him who’s a child, and there'll always be. The child who hadn’t the chance to enjoy his childhood and who sees in his brother the cause of his unhappy adolescence.’
‘You refuse to admit to yourself, that you don’t talk to him enough, that’s it, that’s the big deal?’
‘I liked him because he had that…charming manners…and I believe he was interesting, too…I saw him reading a kind of…old scrapbook he kept, with words and sketches and polaroids….’
‘Because we say adieau when we say goodbye to somebody and we don’t want to see him again for the rest of our life’
‘If you had known the truth about Sherlock would you still have married me, John? Because I feel like a load for you, now’
The woman cuts John off ‘Sorry but I’m very busy right now, there are thousands of people waiting for a meal and there are very few of us today, sorry—‘
"But how could we face it? Kitty Riley, the cameras in the house, Moriarty!.. I was waiting for the storm to pass! I didn't want to rush it...It was something important for me, I wanted to take things slowly...I thought we could solve the Reichenbach case, I was waiting for it to be over to talk to you...and settle everything! But you died!!"
The queue of people waiting to enter in the club stretches around the block. John and Sherlock are to the door when John’s phone rings.
Sherlock is standing in the hallway, trying to focus. He slowly walks, shaking, toward the kitchen. Victor’s dogs bark in the living room, wagging their tails. Sherlock puts a hand on the table, trying not to lose balance. He turns, looking at the kitchen: he sees Victor everywhere, he can still hear his voice while looking around. He goes toward the living room, sitting in his chair, staring at the box with all the stuff Victor left in Baker Street, then stands up, going toward the bookshelf.
“Because they arrested me. And you saw photos of me with Adair, and because they accused me to be on Moran’s side. All that matters to me is to know if you trust me, if you still believe in me."
‘I know a really nice restaurant that makes really good stuff, and has many good wines… we could go there.’
‘You can’t pretend I’m going with you to a wedding! You invited me, I said no, what’s wrong with it?’
‘Exactly! And we both realized that we took the wrong bus so we get off at Tottenham, where soon after we greeted each other, and for the first time in my life I had the courage to ask him the phone number, and he gave it to me!’
‘Yes, obviously, he won’t flee. Tanaka cared about his friend too much to leave London. I bet he’s investigating, just like us.’  He smirks and abruptly steps out of the office tossing a “John!” over his shoulder.
‘I had! My family, my father left everything to me, he was rich, Sherlock knows it, please, Sherlock tell them!’
‘Oh jesus, poor me….’ His hands on his messy hair, then takes the Polaroid on the table ‘I think…’ peering at Sherlock ‘we could take some pics in the bedroom’
Suddenly Greg shouts ‘SHERLOCK WAS IN HIS BEDROOM, I SAW HIM AND I SAW HIS FRIEND TOO, I DIDN’T UNDERSTAND BUT YES, I UNDERSTOOD WHAT WAS HAPPENING BUT THEN I LEFT AND HIS FRIEND LEFT AND THEN I ASKED HIM WHAT WAS HAPPENING AND-‘
‘I don’t care. I won’t stay inside for seven days without doing anything. I need to go on with the case.’
“yes,....Greg...I’m worried. I’m worried she knows something, that she’s hiding me something I don’t know.."
‘That’s why he was here yesterday, he wanted to tell me he’s moving here’ Sherlock smiles nervously ‘And he thinks I’ll let him enter into my flat and sleep upstairs?!??!’ cracking a laugh.
Sherlock’s curled up on the sofa, still with his coat on. His mobile on the table starts ringing. He slowly stretches out his arm to reach the mobile, and answers with a rough, sleep-filled voice ‘mmm...’
‘I would like to thank you all for being here. I…I’ll be honest, I’m a bit…moved. I…I want to thank every one of you, because each person represents a moment, a piece of our lives. Mary and I invited only those who truly mattered to us, and you all have made our lives better for being in it. I didn’t prepare a proper toast or anything….but I just wanted to say ‘thank you, and..’
"I've been in contact with Inspector Lestrade, I know she'll be at the Awards tonight, I wanted to warn Scotland Yard and Mr. Holmes. Is he there?"
"I was busy with the case, and anyway I called him, he told me you were fine, I wanted to visit later but he told me you still needed some rest."
‘Yes, I know’ John smiles ‘Great, we had so much fun, I mean…the place is beautiful, both stunning and sad for the condition in which people live…’
“And I don’t know what’s going on with John..” Sherlock is still shaking, upset. “if...if he knows something about her,...if...he’s simply afraid....I don’t know....also,...those photos of Victor,.I know he is not Moran, that he did nothing...but...” he turns away “Mycroft, I don’t know who I can trust anymore." Sherlock is shaking, visibly upset "Help me, please" He looks desperate. "Only you can help me... John left me. We had a quarrel about...us...and he went away. I don’t know if I’ll see him anymore. I’m scared, Mycroft......Mycroft...?”
‘What the hell do you have in mind? This hotel is always full of journalists and press since you came here!! I can’t stand it anymore!! I won’t allow you to enter in the room without the police permission!!’
Sherlock turns him slowly, John has his eyes half opened, suffering, tries to talk ‘They’r......’ gasping ‘they’....’
John takes a long breath, lowering his head, then starts talking ‘Everything began after Baskerville. More or less..’
‘H--how did you know he’s Tanaka’s brother?’ John mumbles, trying to be discrete, as the rest of the crew stares daggers at them.
‘Or I’ll simply go and ask him, I’m getting really tired of this...comedy, Sherlock not telling me anything, you...all elusive about him..I’m done, sorry..bye’ John stands up, but suddenly Mycroft stops him.
‘Okay, the roast in the oven is almost ready. I suggest we drink until Sherlock arrives. You know, just to pass the time, and to celebrate his recovery, and our honeymoon!’
John puts his fingers on his eyes, stressed out, trying to stay calm and control himself ‘Forget about it Greg…really…it’s…finished anyway’
John takes a huge gasp “Probably I should...stay with him.” He peers at Greg, to see a reaction “It’s not a good moment for him...Mycroft,..and Victor...I’m worried he could do something dangerous..”
He follows the assistant toward the biscuit shelving. Upon the reveal, Lestrade laughs so much so that his abdomen throbs with pain and his voice becomes strained.
John is sitting, his coat on, hands resting on the shoulders of the bench. The dull green pint is scratched and scarred by years of mistreatment. John’s fingernails scrape scraps off, as he waits. He sits, watching the other people mull about their daily days. From afar a long and thin figure appears, coming toward him. Sherlock walks with his hands on the coat’s pocket, turning around with his head down, covering himself in the coat. When he arrives, walking slowly toward the bench, he refrains from looking at John. He sits silently, eyes fixated on all other beings but the man by his side.
‘Not about him, about me…she said it was our honeymoon and I was constantly sad and worried, and that I hadn’t to act like that. But I couldn’t, how could I relax and ejoy it thinking about what happened to Sherlock the night before? And if I hadn’t taken that taxi….’ He takes a long breath, looking through the cab window.
‘When Moran changed his identity two years ago, he obviously changed his face, too. Many killers who want to change their identity have illegal surgeries, with major facial changes. So, we need Lestrade to generate a list of illegal surgeons who worked in London two years ago.’
‘Why would Adair go to meet a man, who died two years ago? There’s not much sense in this. Do you think he used a fake name or something… something else? Probably Moran - he is likely the man the gang would be after, after Moriarty’s death.’
Politely, John shortly wishes Tanaka well, ‘Thank you for your help.’ Afterwards, he races to catch up with Sherlock.
They get into the car and keep the headlamps turned off, as they slowly drive toward the main street, waiting for the group to leave the pub, and they park with the group in their sightlines.
"He called me!" Daniel's mother sounds happy and smiling through the phone, excited to tell the news to Mary.
‘Yes..’ he laughs ‘But this was my personal image of you, I didn’t draw you, it's just my personal view of you’
‘Don’t be fool, I don’t think you’re stupid, I simply think you’re not interested in these things…and that you do not…..understand these kind of….emotions, troubles….’
They come in, John looks around at the new furniture in the kitchen, he keeps his arms tied together behind his back, walking curiously around the kitchen ‘Very nice, indeed’, he looks at the table, on the centre there’s a small flower-stand with a white rose in it. He looks at it closer, when suddenly, Sherlock comes out the bedroom.
‘Yes, it was great, and the landscapes are beautiful, there are colors you are never able to see here’
John looks up at Sherlock, takes a long breath, and picks up his own phone from the bedside table. Moving slowly across Sherlock’s body, in an attempt not to wake him. He searches his contacts for a matching phone number, but it pops up with; NOT FOUND. He switches it off. He puts the two phones next to the pillow and closes his eyes, huffing out an annoyed sigh, ‘the hell is this’? He whispers to himself, as Sherlock’s phone buzzes again.
She knocks at the door, slowly walking in, peering at Greg, who's focused on reading documents on his desk.
‘Mycroft has told you to spy on Sherlock.’ John smoothly clarified, watching the strain on Greg’s visage. He pushed further, eyes glowering, ‘Sherlock is going out during the night with people we’ve never seen before and… I mean - it’s strange! Isn’t it?’
Sherlock stops laughing as John elbows Greg roughly to make room at the sink. ‘John, did you know that they FUCK each other?' He slurs his words as he gestures towards Greg. 'Mycroft and him.'
‘He came up here, locked himself in the room for the entire day, and didn’t leave it until he checked out and paid early this morning. Strange isn’t it?’
John pauses for an inkling of understanding from Sherlock, but as the other end remains silent, he barrels onward. ‘I’ll send you a photo. You’ll like it.’
‘Do you still want to come home?’ He puts the mobile on the seat and hugs Sherlock around the waist.
"From the first time we met in the bus..when you showed me your notebook full of polaroids and scribbles of you and him at the school...you've always loved him,..for so many years."
Greg shouts to the pair of them, ‘I’m find too, if anyone cares. Humpf-let’s go dance upstairs, it’s the only way to digest this shit.’
“Yes but,..you can’t go on if you don’t tell me the truth first, we knew you resigned from your job at CIA before this case started, and you've lied all the time...why?"
Greg goes toward the door, looking suspiciously at John ‘You’re not going to organize a surprise party for me, right?’
‘Nothing will be the same after tomorrow Sherlock…you’ll come back at your work, at your ‘real’ life, with John, with Moran, with your cases. That’s the life you enjoy, you had your week off to stay away from work as your brother said and you took me, I’m not blaming you, I’m just saying the truth, nothing will be the same tomorrow…because tomorrow there will be him’ He opens the main door.
‘Sherlock! Sherlock look at me! It’s Greg, LESTRADE! IT’S LESTRADE SHERLOCK! Don’t worry; we’ll get you outa this shit soon. Just keep your eyes open and look at me, your brother’s on his way, okay?
Greg grabs his coat from the sofa, shrugging it over his shoulders, ‘Don’t worry. Let me do it. I’ll be back soon.’
John is typing, updating his blog, looking at the notes he wrote and trying connect all the informations, randomly reading them.
‘And that was just a tiny example of how much hard my adolescence with him was’ He takes a packet of cigarette from his jacket, and turns one on
‘I’m not his babysitter! Hire a bodyguard who’ll spy on him 24 hours a day if that’s what you want!’
She takes the call, keeping her voice calm and low, waiting a few seconds before answering. "....Hello?"
John moves nervously his hands ‘Yes…right Come on now. He’s waiting for us. He’s probably already gone,’ John looks out the window down the street. Greg shoulders his jacket, and they both walk out the front of the station.
Sherlock lowers his voice to a whisper, ‘you both cannot wait...to…to... ‘ but decides not to finish the sentence with his landlady present.
He gets toward the bookstand, taking a long breath, coughing and arranging the microphone. “Thanks, Mark. Thanks to all of you,..my students. Thanks for all the things you’ve taught me, thanks for your support and your help.”
JL :     He was a brave little fellow, always guarding the house. Every time somebody rang the doorbell, he’d always arrive first.
Sherlock walks quickly upstairs, running, the noisy and deafening sound of the alarm is around the entire home, Sherlock covers his ears and goes toward the pc, turning it off. Suddenly, Greg pops out in the living room.
‘Why did you do nothing when you saw the state he was in then? He was drugged!’ John roars back, fists clenching uncontrollably.
‘No! I’m not, now take the Polaroid and do me more photos’ Sherlock replies quickly, taking the Polaroid on the bed, his sheet almost touching his lower abdomen, and starts making photos at the room
‘….that guy was right…I don’t know what’s wrong with him and what happened to him, and instead of talking to him I started following his brother’s game’
‘The tour will take six days, so we will have another two days to just go around the main city and buy things.’
The cab stops in front of Baker Street, Sherlock’s now kissing him deeply, his legs opened, arms around his neck. He pulls back, ‘I should go now’ looking at him.
‘<<…Remember…’ Sherlock tries to read through the words and the blank spaces <<remember the time when we felt that the reason could be by our side, Remember….the sky that we ’ve been watching for so many times, While the real time flew away…remember the words, your words, the words I said to you to make you feel better, the words that wrote our songs, remember the time in our photos, when we thought that everything could change…while now there’s just me, watching your mind going away, and you, trying to find another way to shut your mind>>….why did you delete it?’
‘We should check the fever, I think it’s back’ John strokes his forehead. ‘I’ll get you another wet towel’ John stands up, and heads to the bathroom.
Sherlock swallows slowly ‘Well, your assumption is wrong, you can’t say he’s gay just because he refused your invite saying he’s engaged, he can be straight as well’
Sherlock finally takes stock of his transport and quickly scans down to his right leg. The bleeding is heavy, he sighs ‘Jesus.’
“Admit it! You can’t stop accusing him because you’re jealous. We’ve already proved Victor is innocent, if you keep accusing him we’ll get nowhere.”
"You organized this event and anyway, you got fired, so they can’t do you anything, don’t you think?”
‘She said that I’ve changed since Sherlock is back,..that I’m always concerned about him and I don't think about her anymore.’
Sherlock sips, then slowly swallows looking at the wine in the glass, making it round in it, then taking another piece of salad with the fork. ‘No, he hasn’t. At all. He has even gotten worse’
‘I don’t have time now! Adair left Tanaka a message. Obviously, some sort of code, to make him understand where the clues to solve his murder are left.’
Gregson ‘Well, I think it’s time to go now, hope to see you soon doctor Watson’ ‘It’s been a pleasure, Inspector’ John smiles while shaking hands with Gregson.
"I was trying to change my life! Just like you! You came back so sure about John's intentions, you thought he was ready to come back to you, you were disillusioned. It didn't happen, and Victor was an excuse to show him you're capable of love!"
Sherlock slowly turns back, while he unbutton his pants, then starts fucking him from behind, his hand on Sherlock’s neck, pushing intensely, Sherlock starts moaning
Suddenly, an sms on Sherlock's phone gets John's attention, he takes the phone, reading the message:
Mycroft steps back, eyes scrutinizing his little brother intently. He ventures, ‘Were you sleeping? What it is you’ve told him exactly?’
Mary is still surfing through the pages of the book, expressionless. A couple next to John give him a puzzled look.
Sherlock turns the tv off, throwing the remote control on the table, while serving tea to Mycroft. Mycroft, taking the cuppa and sipping tea: “You don’t know anything?”
Greg is still clapping when they pull up to him ‘Guys, we should do this every weekend!’ he says with conviction.
‘Really?’ she asks, surprised ‘Why? You think he didn’t die for an accident? He was run over a car while crossing the street’
‘It is! He’s in the dark about everything and has always been. Moran is confusing us, that’s why she took him, because she knows-‘ suddenly Sherlock stops, thinking about his words, both John and Mycroft stare at him, realising he has understood something important ‘...she knows you all hate him’
They leave the club together, Greg hails them a cab, steps in, and John helps a stumbling Sherlock get in the back.
‘I don’t know how somebody could walk in and install all those bombs unnoticed’ Lestrade ponders aloud. ‘If you want, you can try to get him out of there…I can assure you there aren’t any more bombs here or out there in the street.’
hat a… ridiculous human being.’ John stammers furiously, ‘With that… ridiculous French accent and his dandy mood.’ Scoffing, John broadly grins, ‘It’s like he came straight from the Victorian age – please! Go back to where you came from.’ Hands on his knees, shaking his head nervously, John glances round. He laughs loudly, looking at the couple next to him as they stare wide eyed.
The press and paparazzi are outside, interviewing and taking photos at the actresses and famous people from the star system. Inside, the audience is sitting quietly, waiting for the show to begin. Sherlock actors are all sitting next to each other, chatting. A journalist gets closer to the actor who plays professor Moriarty.
John studies the outside of the building; he sees a light flick on from an upstairs window, then turns back to Greg. ‘Okay…it’s definitely time to go now.’
‘Yes, they’re six books, the first is A Study in Scarlet, it’s based on the cases about the woman in pink, the pink case etc… but it’s different, even if they’re all suicides and some things are related, but the names are the same, there’s Sherlock Holmes, and John Watson, and they live together in Baker Street…you know’ she smiles at John who looks more surprised
"I don't want to involve myself into this, not again! We were talking about Sherlock again, and I don't want this..I can't change my life if I still keep talk to you about him"
Woodley straightens up, his nostrils flare, as he takes a sharp inhale, ‘He…uh…we. We were friends.’
John’s eyes narrow, Greg finds a glass, fills it, and runs back toward Mycroft, splashing water all over the floor ‘I’m gonna save you, Myke, I’m gonna do it’ bending over him.
‘I don’t know, I think about you two, you know…the cases…Reichenbach. After the reports came out on TV, but then Sherlock came back, and I don’t know what happened then.’
Mycroft glances swiftly at the cloths piled on the side, asking, ‘Why did you put it away if it is dirty?’
As she walks in the living room, she sees John and Mycroft over Sherlock, who’s now lying on the floor in the middle of the room.
Mycroft sips tea, then puts the mug on the table. “She hired a Victor’s student to mislead Sherlock..and all of us."
Mycroft rises his head, looking at his brother in the eyes, trying to take courage “Sherlock....I must tell you something."
‘We chatted for some days, he was always lovely, and funny, and I honestly was waiting for him to ask me to go out and take a coffee’
Back in the reception hall, Mary’s friends are laughing, and joking with her and John. The orchestra is playing a marvelous set, and most of the guests are dancing and drinking with vigor. The atmosphere is positively electric with happiness.
‘And I don’t think he even Googled that!’ Greg laughed at his own joke as he glances back to Sherlock who’s sharing a long look with John.
John, still faking a laugh, leaving Scotland Yard with Greg. 'A....surprise...party...??? Greg..come on!!!'
John and Sherlock head immediately over to the front desk clerk. He’s a small, portly man who smiles at them effeminately.
‘Yes, but you know the concept is different, the real aim of the movie is to show the concept of hope, that’s what Gatsby embodies’
Meanwhile, John’s back at the mic, still doing a terrible job, and still staring into Sherlock’s eyes.
John continues “We can’t be friends...we can’t pretend to be friends, we will never be, Sherlock. So it’s better for me and you to not see each other anymore. We are destroying ourselves. Our lives. You’re right. It’s too late now. I’ve married Mary. And you chose Victor. Good luck with that.”
‘Nothing, but I’ve never see him before! And suddenly Sherlock has a new friend, I mean it’s weird!’
Molly finds Sherlock sitting on a bench all alone. He has the little favor box with confetti and candies in his hands.
‘What happened….well, no matter. I’m over all that-everything is okay. You’re important to me, Sherlock. I just wanted to let you know that you’re my best friend, and that’s why I’m choosing you to be the Best Man. It’ll be an important day in my life and I want you to be by my side.'
Without further discussion, they simultaneously moved to leave the room, ran down the stairs, and out of the hotel.
Sherlock runs, calling a cab, waving his head on the street, talking on the phone. "Lestrade...put a bounty on Mary."
John grabs him, putting his hand on Sherlock's shoulder. "Sherlock" he whispers. Sherlock looks up at John, tears rolling down his face. John gets Sherlock closer to him, hugging him, Sherlock leans against John's chest.
Mycroft looks at him, then glances down, taking a long breath ’...When Sherlock finished college, he didn’t want to go to university, ....he preferred studying by his own, doing his experiments in his room. But father signed him up at Chemistry University....’
‘Mycroft, run over here, John got shot!! Please!!! Please!!!!’ He shouts, gasping. John sees Sherlock’s face quickly blurring in front of him, slowly closing his eyes...
‘Oh, well it’s called honeymoon, anyway. Wait, does John know he’ll spend his first night as a married man-in a gay club?’ Greg puts down his drink and crosses his arms.
“I’m....fine...it’s just a cold” trying to take breath, slowly closing his eyes, calming himself. Greg puts his hand on Mycroft’s shoulder, keeping closer in a more intimate way “are you fine?"
‘My brother gave this to me before flying away in Berlin,’ He says, a rolled sheet tightly clasped in his hands, ‘He told me I had to give it to you Mr. Holmes.’
John is walking toward home, passing through Baker Street, when suddenly he sees Sherlock’s door open and the light coming from inside. He looks closely, and clearly sees Sherlock talking to a man, who suddenly turns and walks away. But Sherlock leaves the entrance, going towards him, grabbing his left arm, grabbing him by his shirt. They talk once more, then the guy leaves….Sherlock stands for a bit, but then walks toward him again. And kisses him.
The bathtub is almost full when Mycroft turns the water off, the bubbles leaving a fresh vanilla scent like that of a freshly made cake.
‘Yes. Indeed I do.’ Greg runs a hand over his face, feeling the rough stubble already creeping through. ‘So, what he was doing in the toilet then?’
They get out together, standing in front of the bar. Victor puts his jacket on, he looks resentful “Sherlock, I’m going away.”
‘Yes…polaroids. I told you, he’s interesting, indeed, but now he’s gone, I won’t be able to know him because somebody else in this town already took him’
Greg “Let’s just do it.” Greg calls Daniel while John looks at Sherlock and at Victor “So you...” insisting “didn’t know anything? You didn’t know anything about Daniel...and what he was planning to do..you don’t even know Sarah is his girlfriend? Maybe she’s involved just like him..."
‘But why you two are always so...detached from each other? You do care for him but there's always this...eternal war between each other.'
John keeps silent, glancing down. ‘....Victor is using Sherlock, he knows he can do whatever he wants with him just because....Sherlock wants to distract himself...but I think he has to do with Sherlock’s overdose, and I think you should investigate about it.’
Mycroft is upstairs, arranging the bag, putting the clothes in the drawer. John walks in, taking him by surprise ‘Are you moving here?’
'Sherlock' Greg takes a long breath, than looks at John ‘Let’s come back at Reichenbach just for a moment, ok? When you didn’t know Mary, when Sherlock was still alive’
‘Mmm…no,not yet. We were busy with a case. I didn’t have time to talk to him, but I’ll tell him later’.
‘I’ll give you two days. Then you have to tell me where Tanaka works or I’ll send Anderson to find the message before somebody else gets it.’
Sherlock’s eyes spring wide open, and he suddenly jumps up screaming, the needle still stuck in his chest.
‘Great!!!!’ Sherlock comments almost shouting, faking a big smile on his face, quickly searching from the piles of books and sheets on the table.
‘I don’t know, you could give me some tips since you’re so good at getting informations, despite the fact that I don’t spy on people.’
Mycroft walks in and toward the bed Sherlock is curled up on, eyes closed. Mycroft thinks how tired he looks, and how horrible a mess, when Sherlock interrupts his train of thought with an annoyed grunt. ‘How is he?’
John slowly wakes up, rubbing his eyes still closed, walking through the kitchen. He glances at the tv while opening the fridge. Suddenly his phone rings, he peers at it while taking it from the kitchen table.
Sherlock growls as he stands up and totters after his brother. He pauses for a moment to lean on the wall for stability, before making his way to the kitchen while shouting towards his open bedroom door. ‘Checking? What are you
Mary shows a smile on her face, coughing, slowly walking away, while people on the street shout and get closer to Victor, calling the ambulance.
Sherlock blanks his face, but doesn’t reply. John closes his eyes, leans up, and onto his toes to rub his nose across Sherlock’s cheek.
‘Sarah!!! Just tell them! Tell them!! You can’t do this to me! I’m at university!! It’s a shame!! I’m not guilty!! I have not done anything!! Leave me!!’
‘He’s started bothering about after Sherlock’ Lestrade mumbles to the phone, while he pecks away at the tiny keyboard.
‘Then...the night you and Greg looked after him...’ Mycroft gives to John more photos, Sherlock sitting on a table, drinking, Victor next to him, his hand on Sherlock’s back, kissing him on his neck. ‘They...seemed to get acquainted.’ Mycroft comment, smiling ironically. ‘Then the night Sherlock got overdosed...’
'No, it's based on the cases but many things change, it's all set in the Victorian era, so many things are different from modern times. For example, Mycroft Holmes is very fat in Doyle stories'
‘He looks like a young  full of complexes collegiate boy who’s hiding his fiancé and runs away shouting to his mum that she doesn’t understand him’
‘We met on the bus, he was lovely. We talked a lot, he was so charming, I believe he was a teacher or something because he handed books, and he wore glasses, you know, the typical professor you have at the university’
Sherlock, standing next to her while she pours food in the dishes ‘Well… all his patients could want him dead, he was a witness.’
‘Because I must know the man who killed Adair before, I can figure it out. I can’t decode the message without knowing anything about him.'
"Do you want to kill me?" She asks, provoking John "Come on! Do it! I lied to you, I lied all the time, I have a son and you don't even know his name!" They both struggle to take the gun.
‘You can’t use him to oblige me to have this house surrounded by CCTV cameras twenty-four hours a day!’
'And what's that bag?' Sherlock opens a little paper bag, smiling and giggling: he takes a tape out of it, looking at John 'I think the case is solved, doctor Watson.'
‘We were bringing him to Hospital, Mycroft! You wanted to come back here. You brought the fucking adrenaline, and now you’re gonna do it!’
Sherlock wakes up late, he feels stoned and totters walking around the bedroom with his eyes half-closed, feeling like a gigantic stone is up on his head. Mrs Hudson is in the kitchen when he walks in. ‘Good morning Sherlock! How are you, dear?’
‘...He’s never been friendly, so we took a single room for him. At the beginning he seemed shy and introvert with the studies...he didn’t like professors, he didn’t like how they taught,...and it was hard for father and me to look after him, I already took a role for the Government, started to get my way in it......I knew the Trevor family, Victor’s father was an important police chief who worked for the French Government, they left France because he was undertaken by the British Government for an important case that year, so he brought his son to Oxford. Sherlock needed somebody who could look after him, and Victor seemed to be the perfect guy for him, or at least, at the beginning. So I sent him to Sherlock, who changed room and took a double one with Victor. Later I discovered that they had already met at the park, that Sherlock got an accident with Victor’s dog,...that’s why when I first introduced Victor to my brother he didn't react well, but then they started to get on well together. Victor seemed to be perfect for my brother, they shared the same hobbies, he could cope with Sherlock’s bad moods and knew how to cheer him up. But soon after their friendship became something....different. I met Victor’s father who told me they were......not just ‘friends’, and I suddenly understood everything. I didn’t mind, at the beginning,...Victor was a kind guy, romantic and rebel,..but their pair soon became dangerous. Victor liked to make scene, despite his good marks at the exams he was pestiferous, and Sherlock followed him. I remember how many times the University faculty called me,..I lost count. They started making the college life, drugs...parties...Victor was used to it, but not Sherlock, and he started to get lost in it, getting a drugs addiction,...and he seemed not to be able to stop. His vices worsened their relationship...and one day something bad happened.’
John could not believe his luck. The sun shines brightly, as a light mist covets the land. Without an issue, the ceremony commences. The archaic church is adorned with Mary’s favourite flowers. White lilacs hang above the entrance arch. He cannot recall their proper name, but their simplicity is lovely. They stood well with Mary’s elegant dress. The guests are nothing more than few in number, as Mary had lost both parents when she was young. They lost a son when he was three years old and tried to cope with his death after two years, with Mary's birth. Thought she had a few family members attend, her side was mostly filled with friends. Much like John’s own half, which consisted of his immediate family; parents Emma and Hamish, sister Harry. Also, his few friends; Molly, Mike Stamford, Mrs Hudson, Greg and of course-Sherlock. Everyone in his life that mattered, except Mycroft, he was on ‘business’ and couldn’t attend.
'I mean just because Mycroft is spying on him it doesn't necessarily mean he's dangerous. Mycroft spies on everyone! I bet he even spies on you! Your life has changed John. And now Sherlock's life has changed, too. I remember when he called in the middle of the night asking me why you were getting married.'
‘Put the hands on your hair, cherì’ ‘oohhh, that’s sexy’ ‘ Turn left now…no, no like that, I want half of your profile,…yes, don’t move’
‘I watched the video of your friend Greg, it was lovely! Lovely!’ She moves into the kitchen, and puts the kettle on ‘Mr. Parker has a lovely pub, and I know they usually do a karaoke night on Sunday. My friends always go there, and they have so much fun! You know they asked me to go, but I’m too shy to sing! On Saturday there’s a bingo night, but I don’t like those games, they’re so boring, aren’t they?’ She laughs.
John takes his phone, a bit disappointed, and then looks at Greg. He huffs out, and composes a short message.
"The tape you kept behind the painting at the hotel....and now I want to tell you a story. Just to check if you've got good memory. Three years ago the Moriarty's web planned to kill me and share the money the Russian spies were ready to give you once the case was closed. But when I faked my death, only one of the gang got arrested, Ronald Adair, and he didn't reveal the name of the other accomplices to the police. Two days later, the police found a body burnt dead, and a credit card with your name next to it, so the police assumed it was you. But your gang knew it wasn't you, but another collaborator, Duran. While Adair was in jail, Duran disappeared, and someone spread the news that you were dead. Hard to think it was a coincidence. You knew there was a good surgeon that could help you change your identity. And a month after Duran's disappearance, the surgeon was killed by a truck on the street. The universe is rarely so lazy. When Adair went out of prison, he came back to London to meet his collaborator, Moran, to have his money back. Adair found Moran, but Moran had another face, and another name. But the same killer instinct,...and unfortunately, Adair found himself with a stab in the back. And I'm sure that Seraphita Sebastian Moran is in front of me right now."
John judders. An unexpected hand firmly grips his shoulder. John’s neck snapped loudly, as he hastily turned to look at the attacker.
'You two pretend to be colleagues or something, but I know you FUCK each other senseless. HAHA! You thought I didn’t know, but I do!’
Sherlock turns, calmly “Yes...my brother is still in Baker Street. And I’m surprisingly happy about it, can't you see it?" showing a fake smile on his face, John and Greg laugh.
‘I’ll be sure to bring the camera!’ The two share a hearty laugh while watching Sherlock walk triumphantly back over to their table.
‘Why are you following me? I already told you I’m busy!’ the woman shouts at Sherlock, walking through the kitchen and going toward the bar.

The sound of bullets roars all around, the taxi is hit by guns and machine guns. Sherlock and John crouches in the backseat, putting their hands on the head, Sherlock quickly rises his head to see through the cab glass, but John shouts, lowering his head with his hand ‘DOWN!!! DOWN!!!’. The cab driver runs like a madman, trying to avoid the bullets, suddenly John takes his gun from the pocket.
Sherlock slips a hand in Greg’s pocket, steals his phone, and takes a pic of him washing in the sink.
Sherlock is sitting in his chair, with his laptop balanced atop his knees, scrolling the internet. ‘Do you want tea, Mrs. Hudson?’
‘I remember one song, just one…that hangs around my head when I look at these photos…it’s Linger by the Cranberries’
John looks down at him, smiles again. ‘Okay’ he stands up, ‘I should disinfect the wound first, so that you’ll be fine tomorrow.’
“She wasn’t like that...before Sherlock arrived. She was...a woman like any other. Then Sherlock arrived and..BOOM! surprise! always detached and ready to pack. She didn’t even turn up in Baker Street after the shooting...But it’s not this...it’s not about us, I’m talking about the case! I’m worried she could....she could know something and she doesn't say anything because I’m close to Sherlock,..because she’s afraid I could reveal something to him...I’m..probably ranting and raving-"
‘Oh, don’t go out of your way, I’ll do it for you’ Sherlock quickly climb the stairs, while Mycroft shouts from the living room ‘I won’t allow you to throw my stuff away!! Can you listen to me Sherlock???’
‘I’M TALKING TO HIM! JUST TURN THAT RADIO OFF!’ He does, and then hears his phone ringing. It’s still on the seat where he threw it, so he swerves to try and reach it while driving.
Sherlock looks at the man who was watching their exchange silently. ‘Um…I must go now’, the man says smiling, and heads toward the living room, taking his jacket from the sofa.
Sherlock looks away, doesn’t move and doesn’t hug her, she suddenly steps back, keeping her arms away, frowning nervously. Sherlock keeps walking slowly toward the exit door going outside, a hearse is waiting for him. He opens the door, looking at her “Come inside, there’s a seat for you too.” She stands still for a while, thoughtful, unsure of Sherlock’s intensions. The driver opens the car door for her “Please, madam.” She feels uncomfortable while sitting next to the window seat, trying to avoid Sherlock’s look.
Kissing gently Sherlock’s back, near his left shoulder, then slowly toward down his neck ‘You said it’
Greg throws the phone onto the passenger seat, and drives faster toward Baker Street. He parks the car on the sidewalk, and takes the stairs two at a time. When he tumbles into 221b, he sees John crouched over Sherlock, holding him in the recovery position. Greg puts his hands on his head in shock, ‘Oh my fucking god.’
‘Do you remember when somebody wanted to write a book? I remember’ Greg asks before tipping his glass back again.
They still look at each other, Sherlock’s breath becomes stronger, his look sterner. Suddenly, Sherlock’s phone rings.
Because you’re obsessed with him! You’re always comparing yourself to him, and I never talk about him, neither said anything about us, and you constantly make up wrong assumptions about us…… you’re jealous for something never happened’
“No, I failed Sherlock. I feel like a shit. For something I’ve not done. And I was publicly shamed. I have to pack and come back home.”
Greg and Molly can’t hear what he whispers into John’s ear, but they see him nodding intently before turning up a grin and a thumbs-up to Greg who looks baffled.
Sherlock doesn't answer, looking at Victor, still crying and hugging Sarah’s sister, then she turns to Sherlock, weeping “You promised me....”
Sherlock doesn’t take his coat off and sits on his chair, taking his scarf off, holding in in his hands. He looks at Mycroft nervously.
‘I don’t know!’ Mary lifts herself up, pulling the pillow from the bed. ‘I can’t remember!’ She announces, throwing the pillow at him. John yelps, the fluffy cotton scratching at his nose.
‘I bought some festoons, baloons,..I’m going to pick up Mrs Hudson in Baker Street, Mycroft is coming, and Mary is already there’
‘Okay’ John comments going toward the door ‘Hey, we didn’t have dinner after all last night, we could arrange for tonight, what do you think?‘
‘Nothing…you know, she was using so many products to clean the pavement….and she told me it was very dirty, and that Sherlock never clean anything-‘
Victor slowly goes back in the kitchen while looking at Sherlock, surprised. ‘You...called me..honey’
‘Of course he knew I was alive and that soon I would return to Baker Street. These kinds of systems were probably controlled at arm’s length or they would have exploded after you leaned on it over time.’
‘Well,..it’s chocolate..’ John comments, pointing at it with the teaspoon and looking at it while eating ‘and then there’s a nut of white chocolate inside, and then on the top is covered with coconut and mint’
Sherlock answers back, shouting more “I’m fucking tired of this case, ok? I’m not obligated to keep investigating if I don’t want to!”
Greg is interrupted by the entrance of a waitress whose outfit leaves little to the imagination. After a few uncomfortable moments, he finally orders for the three of them. Rum, coke, and pear juice at Sherlock’s insistence. She quickly brings back a bottle of Castillo from Puerto Rico, and John wonders who’ll pay for the expensive bottle. His musings are silenced by Greg pouring shots. ‘To the Newlywed!’
‘No!’ he shouts toward her, Mrs Hudson looks at him scared and while walks quickly toward the door shouts at Mycroft, who’s sitting on the sofa in the living room ‘Could you give him any pills for the mood, too, please??’
‘Yes, sure! John would do anything for him. John is Sherlock’s angel. When John is around, Sherlock will always be safe.’
‘Thanks’ he lets the smoke out and place his two right fingers with the cigarette near the temple, thinking
Mrs. Hudson continues talking, but Sherlock doesn’t hear a word she says. He’s too preoccupied, staring at the laptop screen:
‘I was so scared this afternoon…’ John whispers to himself while watching his sleeping former flatmate. ‘ I couldn’t think properly. I thought I was going to faint when I ran out of surgery. I thought no not again, please God, no. I couldn’t even catch my breath when I ran down the street, my chest and throat burning. I was thinking about all the things I still had to tell you. Things that I never had the courage to tell because…’ he trails off for a moment to gather his thoughts, sighing deeply 'I’m such an arsehole. I thought…why….why is this happening to me? Then I arrived at Baker Street, found Donovan outside, and asked about you. She told me you were okay. I was so relieved. I felt like nothing else mattered in the whole world. I lost all my energy, I couldn’t even climb the stairs. And when I walked in…I wanted to cry’ His throat caught heavy with emotion. ‘I wanted to cry because…that feeling…that feeling when I thought I had lost you forever…it came back again. And I was afraid, so afraid I could barely move. I was shaking, but then I saw Lestrade outside your bedroom door, and I tried to be strong. Then I walked in your room, you were here, and everything was okay. I didn’t need anything else, and I thanked God.’ John’s eyes were moist and brimming with tears. ‘I love you Sherlock, I love you so much.’John kisses Sherlock’s brow, and strokes his hair, resting his cheek on the feverish forehead. Sherlock, though still sleeping, grasps John’s hand tightly, which causes him to turn off the bedside lamp, and settles himself on the bed next to Sherlock.
John feels a rush of emotions, all of them excited as gives a little dance step, shakes his arms, and leans into Sherlock’s ear. ‘Should we act like a couple?’
‘He’s waiting for us, come on.’ John guides Sherlock with a hand on his back, looking at him a bit worried.
‘I’m astonished you were even capable of following me with your CCTV since that night you were, again, busy having dinner with Lestrade and the Minister, but sadly he was locked in my bathroom thanks to your brilliant alarm system program, trying all the possible password combinations, he didn't want to miss dinner with his 'Myke' Sherlock looks at his brother with a cheeky smirk, John tries to hold the laugh.
The three leave the office, Sherlock and Mary head straight down the hall, but John stops ‘Forgot something, you guys go on ahead- I’ll be right there’ and goes back inside the office.
The door rings. Sherlock ignores the contraption, attempting to concentrate. His fingers tap swiftly at the keyboard of the computer.
‘That’s why!’ He shouts, pointing at him, ‘For what’s happened, happening and because you’ve changed!’
‘Do you want me to come with you then?’ he asks, stroking Sherlock’s cheek with one hand, and kissing him gently.
‘There’s a beautiful part in which you’re able to see such beautiful animals, we walked a lot, but it was worth it, we even assisted to a cheetah attacking a gazelle’
‘..Sherlock used to go to Victor’s house during the weekends..one day his father found a pocket of drugs in his son’s room...despite it was Sherlock’s, Victor took the blame for it. Victor’s father was a respectable man, and he couldn’t stand that his son could take drugs, and that was the moment he decided to split them. Victor left London 3 days later, came back to France, and that was the moment their friendship ended. Over the years Victor has always sent many letters and birthday greetings to Sherlock,..but they never saw each other,..until now’.
Greg just looks at his mobile ‘I don’t know what to say. I told him I’m here, he said I could go after dinner.’
‘Interesting…and I’d add…’ Sherlock thinking ‘that at first she’s in love with Gatsby because he reminds her of the good old times she had with him and because she can forget the hell life she has with her husband, that’s why she thinks she loves him. But then she understands that he’s changed, that he’s been trapped in the past for too much time, and he’s become obsessed with it, so much that now she’s just become the puppet he wants to move like he wants. That's why he will soon realizes that life is different’
"It's set in the Victorian era. Sherlock Holmes is a superhero, and just all like all the heroes, he has an alter ego."
“You can’t spend the rest of your life crying, you have to do something. Get out and find something else.”
John catches his eye, thinking that Sherlock is hiding something, but decides not to say anything in front of Greg. ‘Oh, uh…first you shoot the silver rum, then chase it with the pear vodka.’ He says confidently.
Victor's voice trembles ‘I wasn’t!!! Sherlock, I never told you anything because I was afraid you would have left me, that you wouldn’t have believed me, I was too afraid to lose you, it was so hard for me to get in touch with you again after so many years, I didn’t think it was important, that’s why I didn’t say anything, please you have to believe me’
‘I know.  There’s a part of me that wants to forgive everything. On the other hand, I also want to give him a punch in his damn face and tell him how much suffering he’s put me though in the last months.'
John stands still from the sidewalk, frozen. Sherlock puts the arms around the guy’s neck, getting closer to him, kissing him more.
He  puts both his hands on Sherlock’s face giving him a long, strong, deep, kiss. Sherlock grabs his ass unbuttoning his pants, reaching his underwear and going under it
‘LET’S HEAR IT FOR OUR FIRST CONTESTANTS! GOOD EVENING GUYS! TELL US YOUR NAMES’ the MC demands at the microphone.
‘Yes, sure he did, he took care of him right after the attack, and he stayed with him during the night. He was so frightened when he arrived in Baker Street. I never saw him like that before. He looked so worried…’
‘it’s late...come on, everyone go to bed now’ John suggests, a bit annoyed, going toward the car, Greg looks at him, moody.
Melanie “She had a red long shirt...and blue trousers...and...black shoes...maybe white sneakers..I can’t remember.."
Greg switches on the car and slowly turns toward the right, parking. They get out and walk the opposite side of the pub street, then cross the street.
‘I can perfectly manage the case and Moran without Secret Services stalking around my house’ He comments annoyed, raising his voice, then looks at Mary with a hint of embarrassment.
John jumps out the chair, hold on to anger, tremor in his left hand. Sherlock turns the phone off, taking a long breath, looking at John dejected.
‘Just once! Just once! The first time I can’t do something he treats me like shit!’ John shouts through the phone. He makes me look like an idiot! He thinks I don’t care, just because I don’t live with him anymore, or I don’t follow him everywhere! He thinks he must always be put ahead everything! He can’t understand! He will never understand! I can’t make him understand, he doesn’t---What? No! All the things I’ve done for him, and he treats me like this! All the things I’ve said to him last…’ he takes a long breath. ‘He’s such a child! I can’t stand this anymore! He can’t think to arrange somebody’s life like he wants, he can’t! He makes me feel guilty every time I do something not linked to him; he thinks everything is about to him. He doesn’t value what I do for him. He said that I don’t care!’ cracking a nervous laugh. ‘Can you believe that? I…‘ he rubs his eyes with his fingers. ‘I don’t know if he does all this to show off, or to make me feel guilty for being away all week when he’s working on a case. I don’t know what’s happening to him. Why he’s become so...touchy. I don’t know how to act around him; it seems like every time I do something it’s a mistake. I just want things back like before, is that too much to ask?’
John lets the phone clatter to the floor, and picks Sherlock up from his shoulders, in an effort to drag him on the sofa.
‘Ok, so…now, we should make these people answer some questions, right?’ John suggests taking the sheet.
Then he lies down with his knees on the bed ‘Now put two fingers near your mouth….’ ‘Why do you close your eyes?’
Mary clears her throat “Ok, you don’t know me and I understand you wouldn't trust me but,...I’m Daniel’s friend and I’m worried about him."
‘Yes, I’m not happy thinking my fiancé likes to imagine he’s having sex with another man while we’re making love’
‘I didn’t forget it! Came to Baker Street, told me that he was going to get married, and asked me to be his best man. He didn’t tell me when, or where-he didn’t tell me ANYTHING. I didn’t know he wasn’t joking! I thought he wasn't being serious'
‘There’s such a confusion outside! I could barely get in! Sherlock your fans adore you, but I suggest that you avoid the press.’
‘Courage does not always roar, John…sometimes it’s just a little voice at the end of the day that says
What are you doing in a gay club? Why is my brother drunk and sending photos of you in a toilet? Why is he singing I will survive?
“....I’m ill, Sherlock...” Mycroft whispers, knowing he’s causing pain to his brother. Sherlock looks dejected, confused, shocked
Sherlock goes away, putting his hands on the coat pockets, leaving the office. 'Happy Birthday Inspector'
‘A present?’ Greg looks surprised, and grins back. ‘Why?’ he takes it and turns in over in his hands thoughtfully.
Victor leans down, crossing his hands ‘Of course, I haven't seen him lately, did something happen? Is he ill?’
“I don’t. If God knew and saw who killed Sarah...why he didn’t protect her?” He slowly turns to look at her. Mary swallows nervously. “If he really knew..if he really knew about Victor, why he did nothing? That’s why I never believed. God is a concept by which we measure our pain. If he really exists..then he also knows who has killed Sarah and Victor. He also knows that we had to stay right here today, in this car, behind Victor's coffin, he knew we belonged here...”
‘Okay…nice to know some things never change.’ John sits down on the arm of sofa near his head. ‘Sherlock?’ he says in a low voice.
Mary watches Victor going away, slowly standing up, and going toward the exit door. She takes a step outside the wine bar, looking around, and slowly walking away, keeping her hands in the black fur coat pockets. Three motorcycles run fast on the street toward Victor, who’s crossing the road, shooting him in the back. He falls on the ground, the phone crushes.
‘No! I said not near the chicken, put it down in the drawer.’ She huffs out ‘Oh dear lord.’ ‘I should clean the living room, too, Sherlock, the dust is everywhere’.
Mary looks down, taking beers with both hands ‘It’s not the right place to talk about it, John. And I already told you the holiday wasn't the problem.’
Sherlock turns a page of the sheet music. Mrs. Hudson continues into the kitchen, puts the kettle on, and pulls out some chamomile. Searching for the mugs, hoping to avoid experiments, Mrs Hudson begins to prepare the base of the chamomile tea.
“Oh no!!! it’s not!!! I don’t know who my wife is!! You know where is she now?? I don’t know! I don’t know it! She told me Russia! For the case! I hate her! I FUCKING HATE HER!! WHY THE HELL DID YOU JUMP OFF THAT FUCKING BUILDING???? WHY???" John kicks a chair with his leg, shouting and going around the room, nervously.
Sherlock ‘A sexually frustrated 40 years old man who had a trauma in his childhood because he couldn’t face his sexuality due to his father's authority. It has nothing to do with the age’
‘You’ll never really understand men, Molly, just like men will never really understand women, that’s the big mystery’ Greg answers, pointing at her.
‘I don’t care!!!! Tell him I’ll leave him on the doorstep, why don’t you invite him, instead? He would be pleased’
Greg and John lean over in their seats to peer at Mycroft, as he hunched over his phone with a slight snarl. Both stood, walking into the kitchen.
‘That’s what a memory can make. With time it changes, and you can even forget it, forget that moment. And times passes, years passes, and one day, you’re on a train, coming back home, and you put your earphones on and you listen to that song you haven’t listened to for ages…and suddenly the memory starts filming in front of you, you’ll clearly see it, you’ll start remembering everything, every moves, every scene of it, you’ll even taste the coffee, how sugar you put on it, you’ll remember the light that covered part of my face when we talked, you’ll remember the table, its texture, the sensation you had when you touched it, and suddenly the memory will be in front of you, as it happened the day before. And that will be the moment when you’ll feel sad, happy, melancholy….about it..’
“It was a disaster. A complete disaster. I’m not blaming you..I’m just saying it was an error..me trying to come back to him and...then Victor, and....” he takes a long breath, dejected “you know it, I don’t have to tell you the whole story...” John turns, looking at the bag. “you know what? Maybe I shouldn't sleep here, sorry". Suddenly John takes his bag, going toward the door.
Victor: “There are two kinds of happiness: the happiness you don’t expect, the one that suddenly catch you up on some idle Friday afternoon. This kind of happiness makes you so happy that the feeling lasts even after the experience itself. Usually, the best experiences of happiness are the ones who leave you something inside you, that makes you want to change something of your life, like an epiphany saying ‘ehi, that’s how your life could be, so why don’t you change it?’ that moment of happiness gives you the key, and from that moment you just need to open the door and change the root of your life forever.
‘I was excited about the winery opening,….and the fact that I was going to be a professor…but, there was something very important, in the deep of my heart that I was missing, and that didn’t make me enjoy what I was doing. Something that I thought about every day, when I woke up, when I went to bed, when I looked at the winery, the first day I walked in the university..'
Greg is propped up on the mic stand, leaning heavily on it before staggering around the stage singing with his eyes tightly shut.
As the bright screen penetrates his pupils, John’s eyes moisten. Drops leak from the sore sockets. They parade over the apples of his cheeks and John swipes at his face to falter the rain. He sniffs harshly, feeling a few tears peel away from his chin and collapse onto his neck. The dribbles that follow cascade downwards, beneath the fabric of his night-shirt as he reads.
‘My brother was innocent! He didn’t have anything to do with Moran!’ The boy defensively rumbles at Sherlock.
The man turns towards to them as, Sherlock starts kissing John’s neck. He licks a stripe along his throat, and reaches down with a hand to John’s ass, wrapping the other one around his waist.
‘Sure…do they embarrass you? You were my model’ smiling, touching Sherlock’s cheek with his nose, Sherlock hums.
Sherlock rises his head slowly, then turning toward the window cab, looking uninterested ‘About what’ he comments, knowing what John is going to say.
‘I’m here today to tell you about a love story. A love story between two men, who spent most part of their life living together, without knowing how much they were important for each other. Today I want to keep a promise for my best friend, and lover, J. Enoch Drebber: donate his money to the London Music School. There’s going to be a new room in this school named ‘Drebber’, where children will learn to play the violin. I hope he’s looking at me today, proud of what I’m doing for him.’
‘Here...at the cinema..., the fourth day...the fifth day they were in a famous fancy restaurant, The Trinity...the sixth day they were having lunch at the park...’
He gives her a kiss on the cheek and sitting up with his left elbow on the pillow. He remains like this for a while, thinking with narrowed eyes.
‘no,…ok,..you want to take some…promotional pics? You examining some…..blood or anything with tube crash?Like h
‘No! Man I’m not like that. Fuck, no. And Adair didn’t want to kill anyone either. I mean he was afraid this guy would kill him, sure, but he wasn’t going to murder anyone!’
Sherlock grunts annoyed, ‘Oh its Moran! I already know it there’s no need to investigate. Simple and predictable,’ He stares at the ceiling, muttering, ‘Quite predictable, but totally expected - boring!’
Sherlock rolls his eyes closed, then rubs them in thought. ‘Milk with chocolate, and chocolate biscuits.’
A little smile appears on John’s face. “I always need your words, now and then” They both smile. John turns, to see Sherlock staring at something, he frowns, confused, looking around and realises Mary has gone.
Brando suddenly gets off the sofa, going toward Victor, licking his leg. He suddenly stops playing, than turns toward the fireplace and looks at the clock ‘It’s five, already’ stretching his arms and yelling ‘que fais tu, cherì?’ he asks to Sherlock.
Sherlock says he needs to ‘gooooo’ but insists he can’t make it without John’s help. So, John reluctantly leads him to the bathroom.
“John, I can’t talk right now,...the CIA head called me....and I see you don’t need me anyway, you’re safer in Baker Street"

‘Hey, I’m not talking about this…I’m just…saying that probably we’re making wrong assumptions, we’re jumping to conclusions too early. We don’t know who’s this man, neither what he has to do with Sherlock, probably he’s useful for a case or something’
‘…….okay’ he answers calmly, almost annoyed, and walks outside with his dressing gown on, his hair completely messy, with a smirk on his face, rubbing his eyes
‘He didn’t want to kill me. He wanted to warn me and anyway the mines were put before I came back in Baker Street.’
John snickers at the double entendre, but steps up onto the stage, and a second microphone, ‘Remind me to kill you later’ he mutters, but is quickly shushed by Sherlock.
He turns, looking at the front door quietly for a moment before trudging up the steps. A few paces ahead John suddenly turns back again, violently kicking at the mesh on the fence near the door. He hastily jumps back, as it breaks. Gulping, John withdraws his phone from his jacket pocket.
‘So Why did you make me come here with the Polaroid--Ahhhh!’ He shouts in realize ‘Ok, now I get it…you want to…like…. stab some corps at the morgue and then takes some pics?’
Sherlock scoffs, heading into the bedroom. The door slams behind him and Mycroft is left staring at the door, eyebrows raised and lips pouting; confused.
Pictures of Victor Trevor is Matthew Gray Gubler. Picture of Sherlock from Victor's twitter is from Setlock Series 3.
‘You know I took a lesson about fear today at university’ he keeps his drink with the left hand, the right’s drumming on sherlock’s left hand to get his attention
I’m so sorry, I couldn’t come!!! I was in the bathroom, when the alarm system locked me!! and I couldn’t get out!!!
Sincerity in Admitting Fault: It was wrong of me to say that. You worked so hard on dinner and I had no right to try and diminish your wonderful meal. Your friendship is a gift. Oh so precious and so rare. I know I sometimes take it for granted and I despair.
Lestrade give a fake smile, taking a long breath, ‘Stay with Sherlock, and tell him he needs some rest, okay? He looks tired and he’s limping a bit- he shouldn’t walk that much.’
Mrs. Hudson is still motionless at the doorway, moaning and crying. ‘Oh my god. Oh my god! Sherlock, get down from there, please!’
Greg and John sit on the sofa. Both feel a bit awkward, glancing round the room. Occasionally their eyes meet and the pupils rush away from one another. After a long while Greg sighs loudly, his gaze focusing instead on the carpet.
He suddenly freezes, trying to take breath, shocked, turning to look at Sherlock, who suddenly frowns.
‘It’s not true..I didn’t use you, I enjoyed what we did, and it wasn’t because John was away. I can’t go to your wedding because simply I don’t want to. Why do you have to throw away a week of enjoyment and peace and nice things between us just for a ‘no’?’
‘Shhhh, wait’ He goes down on him and starts kissing Sherlock’s chest, his nipples, then down on his belly until he starts licking and sucking his cock. Sherlock starts moaning louder, keeping the hands on his hair, pushing him ‘oohhhhhhh, yes, yes, mmmmmmmmmmmm’ he closes his eyes, then turns his head back toward the angle of the room, up the library
‘Nothing. Forget it. Tanaka was Adair’s friend. They met before Adair was killed, and he told me Adair was going to meet an unknown man. It was that man, who killed him soon after. Adair had some evidence that belonged to this man, which why he was killed. This assailant, however, did not find the evidence. So we must, in order to solve the case.'
Greg walks up to Sherlock and scoops him up underneath an armpit; John does the same to the other side. ‘We’re going to hospital, Sherlock. Stay with us.’
‘I think, um…He’s….uh.’ John can’t put together a coherent sentence to save his life. John tenses up, and Greg pulls his eyes from the closed door to stare at John with a dropped jaw.
‘Yes, he no doubt requires at least a few days to recuperate.’ Mycroft effortlessly agrees. He pushes further, droning, “I am becoming intolerant toward this case.’
Mycroft peers at Sherlock, ‘Since this house has been attacked with several mines that have destroyed the whole floor and you don’t care for who could have been, I’ve decided to take the case and solve it myself.’
‘You have mistaken the heroin with cocaine,….that’s what happened, that’s why you overdosed…..’ ‘…but you took them on purpose, didn’t you? And somebody from the Rockets club gave it to you……who?’
‘Oh, we go check on him, yeah?’ Greg suggests and moves to get up. Sherlock dismisses him with a sharp hand motion.
‘He’s fine. Everyone that was involved or has been potentially impacted by the blast is perfectly fine.’
Mary and Molly walks out the corridor, finding John next to the wall, spliting wine, coughing ‘a sexual..???’
The air is cold and damp, a light rain is falling down, touching Sherlock’s hair, who’s standing in front of Victor’s grave. He touches it with his left hand, thoughtful. He stands in silent for a while, shivering.
Suddenly, his phone rings. He takes it and checks the voice mails. It's from Sarah. He runs as fast as he can, going back home. He jumps up the stairs, shuts the door, and still panting, presses play:
John does the same, his eyes downcast, deep in thought. Finally after a few blocks, he turns to Sherlock, ‘Who was that man in your apartment?’
On the BBC Channel a reporter is inside 221A Baker Street. Mrs. Hudson is sitting on a chair with her legs crossed, hands folded nervously.
Sherlock is aware of John over him and speaking to him, but he can’t seem to form a proper word, so instead continues to mumble, whilst shaking.
‘It’s going well, but Sherlock was waiting for you to make some interviews to the surgeons’ Greg answers, taking another bite with the fork
John hears the medley of his phone, waking up. Stretching his arms and opening his eyes, he takes the phone in hand, reading the SMS.
‘Oh…okay,’ nervously fidgeting his fingers, John walks toward the living room, his face down, moving his lips, then suddenly stops and turns back to the stranger. ‘So, who are-‘
Sarah Sawyer is tied to a chair with a rope, she’s screaming while Moran is biting her with a wood stick “Tell me!!! tell me!!! Where is Daniel?? Where???”
‘Yes, Yes’ he smiles ‘the beach has a beautiful white sand and the color of the ocean is transparent, it’s….stunning’
‘You can even wait in the car. I’ll go and check from the exit door. That’s it! Then we’ll come back home.’
‘I don’t know, he didn’t tell me, he told me I had to look after him because he was worried about the people he was going to be with, so he sent me here.’
Still leafing pages and reading ‘<<Cet amour, si violent, si fragile, si tender, si desespere. Cet amour, beau comme le jour, et mauvais comme le temps. Quand le temps est mauvais Cet amour si vrai Cet amour si beau…>> ….hey, that’s not yours’
'Then stop ruining your marriage because of me or Sherlock' Victor walks in the living room, looking at John, clearly hearing his words before.
‘Are you okay Sherlock? You seem out of sorts.’ John leans against the archway, arms crossed, and face still displaying confusion.
‘Hey, where are you going? ‘I’m not on drugs! I’m clean! What are you doing in my bedroom? Get out!’
‘I asked him if he was going to be Sherlock’s friend again......and he answered <<best friends are always best friends, no matter how life change their lives. But lovers... once they’ve loved, will never be friends again.>>
Greg quirks a small grin, Oh, I can’t wait to see his response.’ The three of them shift their eyes over to where John is laughing and generally enjoying himself.
still checking his phone ‘…I know him, you know….since he was a kid,…I know who he is, I know what he does….’
‘Move on. Find somebody else, and accept it. I know what it means. I’ve been through it when....you got married.’
Mycroft, sitting on the sofa, with a sarcastic smile, enjoying the situation 'Without any doubt, brother mine'
‘Ooh, I love to do spinning, I go to Queen Mother’s Gym, it’s good, and not too expensive. Which gym do you go to?'
Sherlock arrives upstairs, he shuts the door and walks inside the room: it’s perfectly cleaned. It smells good, everything is in order, perfectly set up. Sherlock takes the suitcase on the bed, and drags it toward the stairs, it’s open, and half of the clothes fall on the floor. He throws it down the stairs, the suitcase falls on the first floor. He can hear Mycroft shouting downstairs, then comes back in the bedroom and looks at another smaller suitcase on the dresser: this one is closed. He opens it. ‘Oops’ he comments, sarcastically.
‘Oh…god’ he huffs angrily. Sherlock avoids his look going toward the table, looking for some sheets.
Next to Brando, Sherlock is lying on the sofa, his legs half risen, a moleskine rested on them, writing notes and sketching. Dean is awake in her basket, scratching the ear with her paw and yawning. The living room is messy: there are bottles of wines on papers randomly thrown on the table, a shirt is on a chair next to the fireplace, full of piles of books. Five cups of coffee are on a chest of drawers, next to them a coat leaned down, almost touching the pavement. Two guitars are leaned against the wall, and a piano next to it: there are two cups of coffee and many books and sheets on it.
Mary ‘Victor, we want to help you,...but you should tell us the truth. I got a call by one of my colleagues, these are some photos taken by the C.I.A. on the 3rd of March, one week before Adair was killed, and two weeks before your arrival in London.’
