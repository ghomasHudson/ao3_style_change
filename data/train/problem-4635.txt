A still sleepy Dean walked in with Cas close behind both rubbing their eyes mumbling good morning in greeting.
“The King and Queen of the Unseelie court must becoming, they aren't super formal anymore either, but Gramma does love dressing up from time to time,” Dean answered, “After dinner, we can change.”
“Wren, dear girl, what do you have now?” Rowena asked her Scottish accent thick as she watched the trio enter the room.
“What do I get?’ Dean asked smiled she made a face and kissed him on the cheek he handed her the bag, she pulled out the leather-bound journal and pens, she brushed her hand down it
“When has that stopped you?” Charlie replied, sitting on the stool, her tail twitching, clearly still annoyed with Cas.
Salem smiled, bouncing a bit in her chair as she continued eating her food, leaning over when the red-head sitting next to her whispered something Cas couldn't catch in her ear. Dean tapped him on the leg, getting his attention. When he turned, his mouth went dry. He knew Dean was beautiful, but it still took his breath away every time Cas looked at the man up close.
Dean scoffed at the audacity, saying he would rather die than eat that tofu crap he was always trying to get the twins to eat. Clover walked in at that moment as Sam was about to reply. Instead, he turned to greet his sister.
Jimmy didn't reply. He didn't know-how; instead, he decided to sort of change the subject; “I'm going to ask you a question, and you don't have to answer, and please don't get upset, but you were talking in your sleep,” he said.
"The maid Anna, she kissed, and Stella saw, did you bring her down?" Jimmy asked while trying to help Stella with her breakfast and giving up when Stella pushed his hand away.
“I take it you are talking about Ivy and Jimmy?” Cas rubbed his face. Ash’s complaint since Jimmy showed up at the center.
One orderly had Ivy up off the ground as she was swinging and kicking trying to get out of his grasp. Dean was trying to talk to her calm her down, the other had Marv who was holding his hand to his nose blood gushing from between his fingers.
She frowned and wiggled out of his grasp, taking Dean's hand and following him. Jimmy sighed and followed, he should have known she wasn't going to want him to carry her, but it was worth a shot.
Cas couldn't help but stare when he walked in; tall, muscular guy with dark blonde hair and green eyes, black jeans, a Zeppelin t-shirt under a plaid button-up, work boots made a light thudding noise on the tile floor. The ward was quiet. Cas was sure everyone could hear him breathing heavily. He was taken back by this man as he stopped looking at Cas before turning his attention to Meg.
Ivy took it and looked at it no one sent her stuff she took the box with caution wondering if could be from her dad, but why would he start sending her stuff now? There was an envelope taped to the top with her name on it in fancy script, she smiled and glided her fingers over the pretty lettering. The tape along the box came off when she pulled the letter off.
Jimmy said he wanted to get them changed and into some clothes, and if they were hungry, they could eat lunch. Dean nodded and said he was hungry, asking his sister. She tilted her head confused. Looking at her brother, he put his hand to his mouth and said eat; Stella nodded her head with enthusiasm. She was starving.
“It's not a big deal; besides, we aren't strict on formality anyway,” Dean replied as they walked through the gates, “I'm sorry about earlier when I snapped at you.”
”Stella, it's ok, ” Jimmy said, pulling her dress over her head, noticing she was more flushed then she was earlier.
Chuck looked around confused, “What are you talking about?” he asked, looking very confused as to why Cas was upset now.
Hael nodded and called over the walkie-talkie to have Ivy brought down to the nurses station Dr. Novak wanted ot see her. A crackly voice replied with something that sounded like they were annoyed, but agreed saying they would be down in a moment.
Jimmy hand found some pacifiers they had bought but never used; he gave one to Stella, thinking he would get some custom made for her and the other to Dean. In case Dean needed something to suck on when he was tired or stressed beside his thumb.
“I'm gonna check on her and maybe I can get her to come out,” Cas said patting Ash on the shoulder in reassurance.
Cas nodded most siblings had and underline scent he and Jimmy smell like honey while Gabriel had honey with hints of chocolate.
Cas looked at Jimmy he shook his head, “their Daddy isn’t a very nice man, so they take it out on everyone else,” Cas replied handing Dean more food, “I’m sorry he said that to you, but it is their loss not wanting to be friends with you and Stella.”
“I won't be here next week, and I was hoping that I could get the assignments,” Dean asked, shifting his weight from side to side.
“What's her name? How did you meet?” Clover asked excitedly, swiping through the pictures after Dean handed her the phone.
Cas shifted his weight as they waited for the King and Queen of the Unseelie court to enter the hall. Dom, who decided to come early to see Blue, was standing to Cas’s left, busy talking to Blue about something that Blue was sure would get her blamed. The other fairy shook his head, saying it was nothing to worry about.
Cas nodded like it was no big deal, giving Dean a wink. Dean shook his head, his dad was known, but he didn't have that much pull with Naomi. In fact, Dean felt like the woman didn't like him. He made a mental note to ask his dad about it. Maybe he knew why. Dean enjoyed looking at all the flat land he had never strayed too far from the city as he was excited to see a farm.
Dean sighed. Ivy had expressed more than once she hated that she talks like a toddler. Gabriel told her that the more she worked at it, the better her speech would get, but she got frustrated.
"Can you tell me what she is saying?" Jimmy asked, looking a bit sheepish. He wished he had taken ASL in school.
"She can sort of hear you, but I don't know how to tell you, no one cared. It's why Sam and I came up with the signing for her," Dean said, his voice thick on the verge of tears.
Cas woke up after dreaming about Dean. It was the first time in a long time Cas had had a sex dream. It was amazing sex, amazing enough, he had a wet dream. He sighed when he looked at the mess in his bed, getting up and changing the sheets before stripping and getting in the shower. Cas decided he would skip his morning run and instead get ready for work and have breakfast with the patients. He spotted Ivy was in her usual spot, waiting for her brother. She looked tired. There was no one at the front desk. Cas assume Meg was helping another patient. The orderly always seemed to be missing. Cas made a mental note as he headed down the hall to his office to ask how Ivy slept; she was on sleeping medication. Still, the file said sometimes it doesn't work; he went to his office and set everything down on his desk, turning when he heard a light knock on the door frame.
Ivy stood up and grabbed the box off of Cas’s desk knowing that “Sir” would get upset if she didn't keep it with her. She hated this hopeless and helpless feeling but she would do everything to keep Dean safe.
“Dean are you alright?” Cas asked concern dripping from his voice. He wasn't just Ivy’s doctor he could be someone Dean talks about thing as well.
“I don't know I just walked in,” Dean said watching his sister try to get lose she finally did and ran to Dean the orderly wanted to stop her but Cas held his hand up wanting to watch them interact.
The woman behind the counter looked up as the door opened. A smile spread across her face. She came around the table to greet them.
“Can I go?’ Jimmy asked. Now that Cas knew it wasn't him who had drugs, he was worried that he would wake up without him there.
Zachariah Adler was one of Jimmy's clients. Jimmy was in advertising, and Mr. Adler sold mattresses.
Dean snuggled close to Cas he loved the way the man felt, no one had touched them like that in a very long time, Cas smiled and held him tight as they went down the stairs.
Cas rubbed his face as he sat back in his chair, looking over the English assignments. He was attempting to grade them in between classes. He usually did this at home, but he was busy hanging out with his best friend.
Stella looked down, and the puppy did a little dance, she patted her leg and went to the back door to let the puppy out to go potty, Dean followed along with Cas and Jimmy who was waiting in the hall to see if they would work things out.
"I can't believe they kept that she couldn't hear to themselves," Jimmy said, leaning the door frame again.
”I'm sorry baby, the water might sting, but it will get better, ” Jimmy said, taking her hand, he picked her up and placed her in the tub.
“I took it, the glass broke. I'm getting it reframed,” Cas said smiling. It was the least he could and this way he could replace the frame with plastic on it was safer for everyone.
Stella wasn't paying any attention to what they were saying. She Was looking around at the stuff, spotting some toys in the corner, and tugged on Dean's hand and pointed.
”Now, we will come back for lunch, ” Cas said as they entered the building heading towards the daycare.
Cas called Jimmy over to help him push the twins on the swings. Stella stopped the swing and ran to the slide before Jimmy could get to her, he looked at Cas who shook his head. They couldn't be mad that she was mad that would be saying his feelings weren't valid.
“Stella. You have to sit and eat,” Jimmy said as Stella got up again, walking around the room looking out the window. Jimmy looked at Cas and sighed. She had been like that since the bear got ripped.
He headed back into the bathroom, checking the water before getting in. The warm water felt amazing as the dirt and grime from the night before were spiraled down the drain... Washed up and rinsing off, he didn't want to take too long. Not in the mood to listen to his father complain about taking his sweet time. He turned the water off, grabbed a towel, and brushed his teeth before heading into his room to get dressed. Cas looked in the mirror and smirked before heading back down the stairs.
Dean nodded and took a sip of his own beer. “Look, if you wanna know about me, that's cool, but I can't have Clover go to an asylum, or whatever, it would kill her,” he explained, looking over at Cas.
Harper nodded and picked up a chip, “Here's what I don't get; why bring us back and not stick around to tell us why,” she said, shoving the rest of the chip in her mouth.
Dean nodded, still rubbing his eyes as Cas set him down, taking him into the living room. Stella was teaching the puppy to sit, and it was listening to her.
Dean nodded, saying they would be out soon. Benny apologized again and backed out of the room. He took Cas by the hand, pulling him along, saying they should hurry up before someone else came looking for them.
“I don't understand why they fly into this window,” Wren said dejectedly, her gaze looking down at the small bird as it tried to get up and fly away. “It's not it's time yet,” she added as she scooped up the tiny bird to look it over. That’s when she took note of the broken wing before taking the bird back into the house, the boys right behind her.
“Sure thing Dr. Novak I just told her I was sorry,” Ash replied, looking at Dean and then back at the doctor.
Dean and Stella smelled like a cherry pie with a hint of pine, and now that Cas was thinking about it, Sam Gabriel’s baby did have that same scent.
“I'm leaving for the night, Ivy’s still in the same spot, everyone else is good and in bed,” Meg said.
Cas stepped out in the hall to get Dean, he told him to follow him inside shutting the door behind them before moving over to his desk to show Dean the package that Ivy had received.
“No,” Cas mumbled, pulling the blanket tighter, keeping Dean from letting the sunlight in; it was blinding how bright it was.
“You said my name, you haven't...” he cut himself off feeling the tears well up in his eyes at how proud he was in that moment.
The men looked at each other and shook their heads, ”never, I wanted her, and I am going to keep her, ” he said.
The twins woke up about twenty minutes before the doctor was supposed to get there. Jimmy explained as much as he could while he changed Stella that the doctor was going to touch her, and he would stay the whole time.
Dean was sure he was going to get pulled over for speeding. Luckily it seemed that all the cops were busy else where making it to the facility in record time. He showed his badge to the camera rushing to the building pushing the elevator button repeatedly. Knowing full well that it wouldn't make it move any fast. He waited impatiently as the elevator finally opened getting into the car he pressed the button for Ivy's floor. Taking a deep breath to calm himself he didn't want to spook her by showing that he was upset he was as calm as possible when he exited making his way to the nurses station, Jo smiled at Dean letting him know Ivy was in her room. Cas wanted to see him in his office.
He had never felt this way with anyone but Cas, the bliss the deep subspace he could feel himself falling into as Cas rubbed his cheeks; Dean was hard, trying not to find the friction he so desperately wanted. He felt Cas shift under him, knowing that Cas was getting a bit turned on. He hoped that Cas wouldn't end it just yet. He wanted to feel his cock inside of him, splitting him in half in the most delicious way possible.
Cas covered his laugh, watching them interact; he could tell they were teasing. It was nice to see; it had been years since he and one of his brothers talked; today was special with Gabriel.
She nodded and curled up in the chair and closed her eyes it wasn't too long before Cas heard soft snores coming from the chair he smiled, she wanted to take a nap. Meg walked-in she was going to ask where Ivy was but she spotted her asleep in the chair.
Ivy told Cas that she would take a nap; looking at Jimmy, she asked if he wanted to cuddle with her. Jimmy was surprised, turning to his brother for answers. Cas shrugged and said it was fine with him. Ivy smiled, leading Jimmy out of the room and down the hall.
“You are a fucking cheater Benjamine Layfette,” Salem shouted, pointing to the man sitting across from her.
Dean smiled wide before lifting Cas’s hand and kissing it. Herny smiled at his grandson, happy both of his grandchildren had found their person, but he did worry about Blue and Gabe. It was unconventional, not that he expected anything else from Blue.
”It's ok; babies get dirty when they are learning, ” Jimmy said, grabbing a wipe and cleaning off her dress.
“Sam, I have been back for a month, and I couldn't find you; every time I would get a location, you would disappear,” Harper snapped, grabbing her beer and taking a long drink.
Harper looked at Karen, “Then how the hell are we here?” she asked, moving to take up Dean's spot hugging Sam. even tho she was mad at both of her brothers, she still missed him.
Most of the children looked like humans. The demon children had black, red, or white eyes, depending on their parents' type of lineage. Angels are rare, but one or two have shown up every so often. Fluffy wings and halos, those things were easy enough to hide from the world.
“I know I'm your friend, but I…” Ivy covered Jimmy's mouth with her hand cutting off what he was going to say.
“Ash came in, yelling about Ivy being in trouble with you. She wouldn't be able to go home this weekend. Roy took him to his room,” Jimmy said, placing a hand gently on Ivy's head and giving her a small pat.
“Especially if you are boring,” Dean replied, taking his free hand and moving Cas’ arm from over his face.
The rest of the plane ride was quiet. Dean fell asleep until the plane hit hard turbulence, and it scared the crap out of him; Cas calmed him down, saying everything was ok they were together, and there was only an hour left in the flight. He nodded, attempting to relax. When the plane finally landed, Dean couldn't get out fast enough. Cas trailing behind him, yelling for him to slow down. He didn't even know who he was looking for; Dean didn't care. He just wanted to away from the plane. Cas finally caught up to Dean, pulling him over to the side to let the others getting off the plane get by.
He groaned as he grabbed the bottle of slick, drizzling some over himself, and lubed his hand. The Alpha started slowly working himself, thinking for some reason he should film himself jerking off to the Omega. Grabbing the phone that was next to the laptop and opening up the camera.
Dean was thinking about the blue eyed man while lying on the couch what was it about him that made Ivy so comfortable? Dean couldn’t stop thinking about how hot he was, that messy hair, scruffy chin and perfect ass Dean knew was hiding under that lab coat he liked to wear. Dean thought about how much he would love to bury his cock in that mans mouth and have him fuck Dean into the mattress, he was palming the bulge in his pants might as well hop in the shower since he had sometime before heading back to the facility.
He rubbed his face in frustration. He no longer wanted anything to do with technology. Running a hand through his hair, Dean headed to bed.
Ivy got her tray of food and found a table Ash came over to her she glared at him. She was pissed he broke her picture of her mom.
“What's going on? Is Ivy ok?” Bobby asked, there weren't many reasons Dean would be in a mood and something being u with Ivy would be one of them.
“Yeah man, she talked today,” Dean said,, beaming he couldn't be happier as he drove Benny home, thinking about the last time he had heard Icy says his name.
Dean agreed but only if Ivy kept up her end of the deal otherwise he would say no, Ivy nodded and wrote down that she would do the best she could. After dinner, Dean hung around Cas went back to his office to complete some work he needed to finish. Dean played a game of cards with Ivy. She kept making kissy faces at him the whole time. ,
Cas and Dean covered their laughs, looking at Gabe in his vest and what looked like tights, “I wouldn't laugh. You have to wear them too,” Millie's voice called out from behind the boys.
“Ivy?” Cas asked, moving his head so she would see his face and look at him, “Ivy please tell me what happened,” he pleaded, he wasn't going to be able to help if he didn't know the details.
She raised an eyebrow and nodded, “He is pretty. Wait till you see Ivy up close. She's just as pretty,” Meg said, laughing as she moved away from the desk.
“Yeah, and he likes her,” Cas said, sighing, “I am a little worried about this weekend,” he added, watching Ivy talk to Jimmy.
Jimmy kissed Stellas cheek before she laid her head on his shoulder. She smiled behind her pacifier. He smiled back.
Dean didn't reply; he knew the truth of the situation; they hated Blue but would never admit it. Cas called out, asking where something was as he headed into the back to help Cas. It was too long before the staff from the castle showed up, telling Dean and Cas they could leave, and there was leftover breakfast waiting for them. The walk was quiet. Cas didn't say much he thought his family was messed up; he also was surprised to find out that Dean was technically a prince.
“Yeah, who else? It's like since he showed up all pretty with his sad blue eyes. I'm invisible,” Ash said, leaning forward in his chair.
Cole made his way over, spotting Stella alone; he sat down next to her. Stella looked at Cole; he smiled softly.
When he looked at his phone, he smirked, deleting the number his “date” had stuck in his phone. He saw a missed call from Charlie, his best friend in the whole world, the one person besides his twin who understood him. He tapped her name, putting the phone to his ear, listening to its ring. He smiled when she answered.
Dean laughed as they followed Pamela into the house, she was talking about how she tried to find out who pulled Dean out, but she got nothing. So they were going to a seance. Pamela was pulling candles and the things she needed out of the cabinet; Dean hit Sam and nodded at Pamela.
Harper didn't hear the response, but she was sure it was something along the lines of it was a habit.
”I'll check out the boy first, ” the doctor said, he set his bag down on the table next to Dean and pulled out a stethoscope. He listens to Dean's heart and lungs the doctor said Dean was great he needed to get undressed so he could check out the rest of him.
Dean took a shower and was looking forward to seeing Cas in the morning as well as Ivy, but there was something about Cas that drew in, and he wanted to know more about the man. It had been a while since Dean had flirted with anyone. He was always busy with work or visiting Ivy; his co-worker and best friend Benny was still trying to set him up on a date. In all honesty, there was too much to worry about, and the last person Dean dated took them to see Ivy. When they left, she commented on how she didn't understand why he spent so much time worrying about someone who didn't talk and didn't worry about him. Dean dumped her the next day. If she couldn’t respect that his sister needed him, then she could find someone else. He took a chance and shared something extremely personal. She laughed in his face. Dean stopped after that, so now one night stands and drunken hookups, no strings attache,d and he were mostly ok with that. Dean woke up the next morning, running late. He hated being late, quickly got dressed in his nicest pair of jeans, a soft long sleeve henley maybe he could get Ivy to go outside today, and checks himself in the mirror, and headed out.
“Anyone you got your eye on?” Hey, this was no time for pussy-footing around. Dean only had a few days till he left and he wanted to see Sam happy before then.
Good to know Dean was the only one thinking highly inappropriate things. He was feeling like such a damn cad right now. Sam could never know. Dean would be good, he’d toast their goddamn wedding and never breathe a word of it. “Yep.”
“That’s my man,” Dean grinned. See? Cas was taking the hint! He was great at matchmaking, it was practically in the bag.
Dean leaned closer until he was practically talking to Cas’s jawline. “I’m a handy man to have around if you need to learn about tools.” Not a line he would have said to a girl ever, but he was curious how thick he’d have to lay the innuendo down for this priest.
Dean wrapped one hand around the back of his neck, glad there were no cameras this time. The kiss was just as thrilling as the first, and he poured gratitude and desire and everything else he failed at putting into words for the past few months.
“We have a confessional room with a narrow screen. One can sit behind it if they wish, but there’s more than enough room to sit face-to-face as well.” He almost preferred those, because the sinkers never suggested it.
“Hello, sorry.” A tall woman with short hair took the seat next to them, one hand landing on the poison-green purse. Her nails were bright red. “I had to take a phone call after going to the potty.” She had a lot of teeth in her smile.
He hoped these walls were soundproof, because he’d been shooting in tissues for like two months. Breakups were hard, and so was he.
Cas turned his head to stare back at Dean. It left them very close, but it wasn’t as if their mouths lined up. He would have to tilt his head down to brush Dean’s lips.
“Jack,” he says, saying the same outloud for the first time in months. It feels foreign around his tongue. “Jack, you better got your ears on. And you better not fucking ignore me this time.”
Dean walks off, the adrenaline from his fight with Balthazar dying down. He turns the corner towards the elevators and digs into his pocket for his phone, and the business card Henrickson slipped him earlier. Dean stares at it for a moment, like it’s a predator about to strike. The numbers are calling out to him.
He turns on his back and stares at the concrete. It’s hard to believe there was a time they didn’t have the bunker; when home was just a far off dream, and they had no clear idea where they’d be sleeping that night. Sometimes a seedy motel with questionable stains, sometimes the back of the Impala, which got more and more uncomfortable the older and taller he got. Roomy for two children once upon a time, but now he has to bend his knees to lay down, and his shoulders are too wide to fit on the bench.
“And then,” she says, rapidly but with exhaustion and fear permeating each word, “and then, I don’t know what happened. I thought, ‘I have to help him, but how?’ and I heard a voice. It was so clear! But it came from inside me. It said, ‘I can help’. Next thing I knew, my hands were on her head, and she was—she was burning, from my hands, and she crumbled into ash!”
They don’t talk about it. Instead, they talk about potential cases, but nothing seems like it’s their type of deal; mostly just mundane, cruel, human-on-human violence.
Dean doesn’t realize minutes fly by as he stands there, watching Cas. The innocuous rise and fall of his chest is the most mesmerizing thing in the world now. Sam clears his throat and gets Dean’s attention.
God, if that could happen, if they could finally catch that break. If things could finally start going
“We’re going to pause the interview here,” Henrickson says, then he hits a button on the recorder. “You know you’re not under arrest. D.A.’s not even going to waste his time looking over the paperwork. It was self-defense, clear as day, Castiel. And, for the record, you didn’t kill a man. Alastair Black was a monster. He needed to be stopped. We all know it was only a matter of time before he got bored of you and hurt someone else. You stopped that from happening. You saved lives.”
“It’s certainly possible. Neither goodness or evilness are inherent, but a conscious choice. Would you look at an infant Ghangis Khan and think him capable of the carnage he would wreak? Would you look at an infant Joseph Stalin and imagine him one day starving his own people? The fact of the matter is simply that this child will possess extraordinary abilities. Goodness might not even be the deciding factor; he could possibly destroy the world on accident.”
“Let’s hope it finally works out,” Gabriel says. “Hey, should we throw a baby shower? I see them on TV all the time. Do they really get that crazy? I wouldn’t know. Last baby shower I was at didn’t work so well.”
“He’s not exactly my type,” Jo said weakly. That much was true. Nick was a lovely boy, but he was immature and had a bad habit of agreeing with everything people said. It was an awful trait he always seemed to attract the most entitled, demanding women with expensive tastes.
Instead of raising in defense, the angel let itself be dragged back and bound to the rack. Its lack of movement was so suspicious that the other demons backed away once the chains were clicked shut, as if expecting it to spring out of the shackles and smote all.
The kid they were looking for was eleven and this kid looked to be about that age. “Hello. Are you here about the new church?” he asked politely. “My name is Jesse.”
This one had a lot of red in its sauce so he was hopeful it was tomato sauce. The Big Cross lady brought Cas a small bowl and Dean was so busy paying attention to him he stuck another spoonful in his mouth without thinking.
, which expands on that line of thinking. It strips away the short-lived petty judgments and intertwines the divine and the universe.” Cas spoke so seriously and intently, gaze trained on Sam and nobody else.
“Thank you. I don’t want to take attention from either the cooks nor the judges though.” He never looked away from Dean, head tilted with a curiously unreadable expression.
Now the lady turned to blink at him. If he remembered correctly, her name was Rebecca. “He didn’t tell us he was dating anyone.”
The small space felt stifling. Castiel could only hear himself and the slow breaths of the person next to him. “I have a follow up question,” he said slowly.
A young man walked by just then, tall and clean cut with a friendly smile. He wasn’t wearing an uniform, but he had pressed pants. Pressed pants! “Sam, breakfast is in the kitchens.”
Dean immediately frowned, he did no such thing! And when the door opened he raised an arm protectively over his chest until he could see if it was that transparent. Luckily it was just Sam and Blue Eyes.
Edith folded both hands on her cane. “It’s fine, Father Novak. A servant of the Lord has his mind on other things.” One papery hand rose as her eyes flew to Dean. “Not that one can’t…”
“You heard what I said, right? It applies to you too. Let’s just give Cas his space. We can grab something to eat.”
And it’s late. And Cas is still driving, following whatever minute leads he manages to sniff out. Dean shouldn’t break his concentration. He shouldn’t ruin the mood.
It doesn’t help him relax. It makes him more anxious. His heart thrums rapidly. His feet shake. He tosses and turns, unable to get comfortable. His mind races.
And his eyes are burning, and it’s hard to breath, and he knows what’s behind that door, sees it every night no matter how much he wishes he didn’t, no matter how hard he tries to focus on anything else, no matter how tightly he closes his eyes. They’re free, they’re supposed to be free, their life is their own now, for the first time ever, there is no puppet master, they’re free, they’re free —
Eventually the coffee runs out, so he finishes the beer on the nightstand. It’s half-empty, stale and lukewarm, but he finishes it down in just a few swallows, then grabs the case he keeps stashed under the bed. The liquid hisses when he twists the cap off. He aims for the trash can, but it bounces off the rim, and falls to the floor, joining the pile that’s collected in the corner of his room.
He makes it to the door and prepares to knock, but he pauses with his fist is halfway there, suddenly aware of where he is and what he is doing.
“Now you’re just lying.” Dean’s blood boils under his skin. “You woke him up the first time.” He sticks his hand in his pocket, wrapping his fingers around the angel blade.
. He’s re-watching older seasons, unwillingly to watch anything new without Cas by his side. It’s become their routine; dinner, shower, then hang out together, usually in Dean’s room, watching movies or television on his laptop. They had discovered that the pop culture download Metatron gave Cas didn’t put together a full picture, and anyway, there was a difference between knowing something and experiencing it.
A sob scratches at Dean’s throat. His lungs shudder behind his ribs. He braces his back against the elm tree to hold him up. The blade falls from his fingers into the dirt.
Kelly swallows. “I didn’t know what to do. I got someone to help me get him here. They wanted to bring him to a hospital, but...” She glances away. “I didn’t know what to do.”
“Even I’m not that evil. And they’re going to let him run Heaven? You think he’d like a side-gig in Hell?”
“Sure. We can make it a tradition.” Dean waves at a penguin staring at him intensely and chuckles when it flaps its wings even harder. “Maybe we don’t have to go just yet—it is Sam’s night to cook, you know.”
“I’m not having this discussion. Seriously, first Mom, now you? How long have you been thinking like this?” If Cas suggests they reach out next, so help him. He forces himself to finish the rest of his drink.
Sam comes down to the station, haggard but cheerful. Dean can’t manage conversation, but Sam’s presence beside him is comforting and soothing. Fifteen minutes later, Dean, Sam, and Henrickson are in a car headed for Kansas City. It’s only a forty minute drive. Barely a blink of an eye. A forty minute drive is only a milk run, really. But this time it seems to take forever. Each mile is eternal. Each second lasts minutes. The road stretches on, endless, forever. Farther than his eye can see.
. But Sam whispers in Dean’s ear, “Let’s give him space,” and Dean is following, out the door, Balthazar trailing behind them sulkily.
Eventually, he forces himself out from under the covers and grabs the jacket, pinching the fabric beneath his fingers. He smells it. It smells like dust and nothing else. But Dean slips it on and leaves his room. It’s late. Sam and Eileen are in bed by now. He walks down the hallway and stands in front of the door to Cas’s. This time, he doesn’t hesitate. He pushes it open and steps inside.
He laughed when Cas popped up, grabbing him pulling him back into the bed placing light kisses on Dean's face. Dean adjusted himself into a more comfortable and accessible potion for Cas, enjoying the feeling f the other fairies' lips on his skin. The tenderness was euphoric; Dean had never had anyone kiss him the way Cas does. He was always the one who was tender and caring in the relationship. It was nice to have it reciprocated.
“It's not our fault. She was the one that kept going,” Harper said, folding her arms across her chest while leaning back in her chair.
Stella walked back over to the stuffed animals looking around; she noticed that he bear missing. She looked around, spotting Cole, who had her bear she marched up to him and snatched the bear walking away.
"Can it be fixed with surgery or something?" Jimmy asked as Stella climbed into his lap with a sleeping Belle.
“I am vibrating. Do you not like it?” Cas asked with a confused look in his face. “I thought this is what you wanted.”
She nodded and yawned, holding her arms up. Jimmy unbuckled her, lifting her out, pulling her into his lap. She cuddled close, putting her thumb in her mouth, nodding off to sleep comfy in her Alphas arms.
Dean sighed and nodded, he wanted to be close to his sister, but he knew things were going to change.
She had a surprise look on her face, that was definitely something that should have been added to the file.“I didn’t even know that their dad gave information about Ivy when she was admitted he may have left that out” Meg said
I don't know what to do anymore... I can't fill this hole in my soul, and it keeps getting worse every day. People say to take it one day when someone dies, but how can I when I know that you are in Heaven?
“Any sign?” Rowena asked a moment later, looking at Cas while the twins looked over the bird. She was standing beside him with a small, hopeful smile on her face.
Stella turned her head; she could be mad if she wanted to be. Stella folded her arms across her chest as Jimmy took off her bottoms to change her.
Dean Winchester was everything Cas wanted in an Omega. He was small, feminine, and smart. His pretty green eyes and freckles stood out against the milky white skin. He was getting hard thinking about how much he would love to bury himself deep in Dean and never let anyone else touch him ever again. Luckily, Cas had learned to control his scent. Otherwise, the whole room would reek of Alpha arousal, and he couldn’t have that even if he could smell Dean.
Dean looked at Cas and then back up at his sister. Getting up quickly, Salem squealed and took off running into the house, Dean hot on her heels. Cas looked around as everyone started laughing.
Sam walked her to the door while everyone else sat back and waited. Sam called the girl the wrong name, and she looked a bit disappointed, Dean shook his head, and Harper covered her laugh as Karen smacked her in the arm to shut her up.
Jimmy stopped by Cas’ office to tell him he was heading down to the daycare, Cas said he would go with him he wanted to see how Dean was doing.
When the Alpha got home, he opened his laptop, hoping to find something good to watch to get some relief. Putting things away while the thing booted up, Cas settled on his bed with his laptop set up off to the side and everything else he needed. Cas undressed and laid down.
They were finally called back, Stella patted her leg, and Belle followed next to Stella stopping when she did.
“You got nothing to be sorry about. This is not your fault,” Dean said moving the paper before pulling Ivy into a tight hug.
Wren didn't say anything as she headed to the dresser to grab her scrubs to get ready for work. She already knew what Cas was upset about, and Dean didn't want her two cents.
Castiel followed Dean down the hall and into the bedroom. “Would you like me to remove my clothing now? I can show you some of my features if you would like,” he asked.
Cas looked at Dean, “Salem, just because you are bad at poker does not mean everyone is cheating.” Dean said, chuckling, “You remember Cas.”
“I find this strange, Ivy starts opening up. She's writing things down saying your name and then this?” Cas said holding up the box, he rubbed the back of his neck as he set the box down on his desk, “Someone is watching and I think it's the person who hurt her.”
He parked his car as close to the gate as possible that way. He could make a quick escape if he needed to; he spotted his least favorite brother's car parked right in front of the steps. Cas rolled his eyes as he opened the door, hearing his mother's voice talking about him.
Dean looked at the man in surprise, “Thanks for that,” he said, slamming the Angel killing knife through the man's heart.
“Your grandfather has taken you sister and the boy; he wants us there for dinner. I need you to go to the bakery and help your mom for a while until the replacements show up,” John said,,,, walking out of Dean's room leaving the door open.
“To get us out of heaven,” Harper said, taking a sip of her beer, before setting the bottle down on the counter and folding her arms across her chest, giving her younger brother a questioning look.
“Don't leave me hanging; what do you think happened?” Dean asked,, wondering why Cas was drawing this out and not telling him.
“If you’re asking if I got fired with no evidence... then the answer is yes. And I feel horrible about it,” Cas answered, finishing his beer.
Jimmy asked if everyone was ready before he started the car and headed off to the office. It was a quiet ride no one says anything Stella would point and Dean would tell her the name if he knew what it was, Cas or Jimmy would fill in the blanks that Dean didn't know.
John nodded, not saying anything further, turning his attention back to Chuck and the wedding plans. Jimmy walked into the room Willow behind him with her head down, cradling her arm. She peeked up when she heard Jimmy greet Cas, giving him a small smile before joining her brother on the opposite couch. Cas patted Jimmy on the leg nodding for him to follow. He had questions, and asking anyone else would cause problems. Also, he was avoiding Dean. The hybrid was too pretty, and it was making Cas uncomfortable. They left the room telling their mom they would be back. Heading to the backyard, Cas pulled a joint of catnip out of his pocket, sticking it in his mouth and lighting it, taking a drag before handing it to his brother.
“She went for a walk down to the pond,” Dean answered as he turned to set the plate of bacon down on the table, “Cas should be down soon.”
Dean nodded, following Cas taking a deep breath, knowing his father would be there the following day, hoping that he didn't do anything to embarrass him.
“It's policy, especially when it come to Ivy. She can be a bit problematic,” Hael replied going back to what she was doing before Dean could protest.
Stella was lying with her head in Jimmy's lap dozing off; Jimmy said he was going to take her to bed.
“Before we go back in, how old are they? Willow seems small,” Cas asked. It wasn't uncommon for female hybrids to be smaller than their male counterparts.
“You are not in trouble, I don't know why he would say that, but I will talk to him about it,” Cas said.
Cas paced the hall before he headed to the door. In two weeks, they decided to meet up, and it was the longest two weeks of his life. They talked, sent photos, but this was different. All kinds of scenarios were running through his head, like what if this guy brought a fierce Alpha friend and they robbed and murdered him?
Stella furrowed her brow at Jimmy, confused by what he said she looked to Dean for answer seeing he had clothes on. She looked down at herself and pointed to Dean and then herself again.
“I'm gonna go talk to Cas for a minute; I'll see you later,” Jimmy said, heading back down the hall to the office.
Her eyes flew open once she realized who was talking to her. She squealed with excitement,“Benny!” she breathed out in a very rough unused voice, wrapping her arms around the large mans neck.
“I'm pissed! Something could have happened to you! You can't keep sneaking off like that!” Charlie scolded while folding her arms across her chest. Yup, she was clearly mad.
Dean turned and looked at the Alpha, he smiled and nodded, saying he was heading home now. Cas nodded and smiled, replying to email if he needed anything. The student nodded and continued his way out the door.
“He is helping Willow clean up some scratches; she does that when she gets upset. She scratches herself. Dean does the same thing. You'll have to keep an eye on him,” John replied, taking a sip of the drink in his hand.
"Hey, look at that, you're almost all clear," Jimmy said, smiling at his grumpy baby, "ok be grumpy. We are going to go to the park."
“Chuck tells me you work at the record store,” John stated, his voice sounded like it did not approve.
“I would like to ask if you knew why the group home isn't in your sister's file?” Cas asked after a few moments of silence between them. He was fine with the quiet but he wanted ot know what else was missing from Ivy’s file.
Stella didn't want to play with the blocks she got up and wandered away. At the same time, Benny was putting the blocks away. She found the stuffed animals she sat down, taking her pacifier out of her mouth, setting it on the ground next to her teddy bear, and started babbling to the animals.
“I guess... but no more talking like that. Mama and Daddy were talking like that when we were little. They ended up taking Dean away for some time. So we don't talk like that anymore,” Clover stated, playing with the end of her hair as she talked to Cas.
”Hey, Dad! She’s sweet and lovely. I don't understand how this place can get away with not taking care of them?” Jimmy said he was upset and worried.
“This weekend we have family dinner, everyone will be there,” Cas said, sitting down at his desk, sending a quick text to Jimmy about what he Dean had informed him.
Dean didn't say anything. He kicked off his shoes, climbing into the bed, pulling Cas bac,k wrapping his arms around him as he sobbed.
“Mr. Novak, I am sorry this happened. I was I on the phone with a client,” Becky said, hoping he wasn’t pulling her.
Harper got up and paced the room, slamming the book close, annoyed by the fact that they still didn't know what pulled them out of Heaven and then left them in their coffins. She said she was going to see what Karen had come up with.
Cas was taken back, but Dean's statement, “Ok, I'm sorry. You both are really young and haven't seen a lot of the world. I think it's weird, that's all,” he replied.
“If there's no more incidentes, even if Marv is bothering you I don't see why not sometime next week, ” Cas said, hoping that would make her happy. There were no notes of an eating disorder but Cas was sure if Dean didn't show up she would never eat.
“Dad makes a huge donation every year, and you don't get special treatment?’ Gabriel asked, looking at his little brother.
“It's ok Cas, but just look how she is,” Dean said pointing to his sister when he saw her walking towards them.
Cas shrugged, he was who he was, and he wasn't going to change for anyone, especially his father. They made their way into the dining room, where his mother was holding brunch for everyone. She smiled at her youngest as he made his way over to her. He greeted her with a kiss to the top of her head before looking at the rest of the group.
”The bear is Stellas. She came in with it, ” Becky said, taking the other half from Bela, ”time out both of you.”
Sam showed up the following morning, announcing that he decided to stay for a few days. The quiet had always helped him clear his mind. Dean agreed, it was a little early for their family to get together, but this was fine and probably something they should do more often.
They both looked at him like they had no idea what he was talking about; Dean reminded them that they had a name, Castiel.
“Cum for me,” Cas said, thrusting faster, reaching around and grabbing Dean's cock, sliding his hand up and down.
“Breathe, there is nothing to worry about,” Cas said, handing their boarding passes to the flight attendant.
He checked his watch, blew out the air between his lips, fixed the stack of papers, and placed the cap back on the pen he grabbed what he needed before heading out the door to his classroom.
Cas turned and looked to see who he was supposed to be marrying, taken aback at the sight of the man glaring at him. The guy was handsome. To say the least. He seemed uptight, sitting there in his pressed dress shirt and slacks. He nodded his head slowly in greeting, looking Cas up and down with judgment clear in his expression. A little giggle pulled Cas’s attention away from Dean and towards the sound. He found a small girl sitting next to his brother, covering her mouth to smother the laughter, her eyes bright bottle green, and her hair a dark brown. She must be Dean's sister, with her similar facial structure and eye color; she was the one who is supposed to marry Jimmy.
“That's ok, maybe not today. I just wanted to introduce myself to you, and maybe one day this conversation won't be one-sided,” Cas said, pointing at Ivy.
Mary turned and looked at her son, her jaw dropped in shock at Dean's comment, “I am nice to Blue. She's the one who gets offended,” the older fairy replied.
Dean looked up at the jumbo jet and shuddered; the fear was starting to creep in being stuck in the air thousands of feet above the ground. No escape if anything should happen. His heart rate picking up the closer they got to their gate.
A slight look of wonder in Jack’s eyes and then nothing as the man took his final breath. Dean turned his head away, his eyes landing on his sister, standing in the doorway. She had tears in her eyes, it was always hard for her when someone passed.
The ride was quiet all the way back to the house, an uneasy settling in their stomach, but neither one wanted to say anything. Because if they did, it would make it
Stella didn't back up this time. Jimmy cupped her cheek, staring into her hurt green eyes he knew he messed up, big time Jimmy would have to figure out how to get back on her good side.
“I have no idea, what's missing?” Meg asked she knew that Ivy and Dean's father was a drunk and probably forgot many details that should have been placed in the file.
“Bullshit, I saw you die,” Harper screamed; this was just cruel whoever this imposter was, they were toying with her; she cocked the gun again, this time taking a steadying breath.
The rest of the day went by quicker than Cas would have liked. Even after Charlie left for the day, he tried to stall as much as possible before leaving. He shot Jimmy a text that he was on his way. Waiting for his ride, the incident with John and Willow popped into his head, hoping it was nothing more than John being overprotective, telling her not to be alone with him because of the way he looks. The ride to his parent's house was quiet; Cas sighed when his phone dinged, pulling out the unknown number from the night before, saying how much fun they had. They should do it again, he smirked and deleted the message. The chances of seeing them again weren't slim. Still, he could always lie like he always did, saying his phone broke he had to get a new one losing all his contacts.
Cas called for them to come in, it was Jo she peeked her head in, “Ivy is awake,” she said standing back so Ivy could walk in she ran to Dean throwing her arms around his neck.
Dean would be lying if he said he had never had this kind of fantasy before, but it was different. Down south started betraying him again as all the blood began to rush there, making him hard not to hide anything in the grey sweats he decided to put on, which he was now regretting that choice, seeing as how nothing seemed to get by the bot.
Jimmy followed her to the slide in case she needed him. She didn't, but he was still there if she needed him while Dean and Cas played on the swings.
They paid, and Cas laid down some rules about staying close and not wandering too far by himself, and when he was ready to go, let him know, and they could go.
Cas nodded. He may need to brush up on his religion. After Marv came Donatello, who thought he was a prophet of the lord. That was a new one for Cas; next, was Ash, who believed demons were real, and the FBI, CIA, and NSA were all watching him through an implant in his eyeball, then came Ruby she was there because of her anxiety that she was sure was getting better. Cas wanted to stretch and leave the office. It was lunchtime. He wanted to see how lunch was run and how the different residents interacted with each other. He headed down to the dining hall, looking around as Cas made his way down the aisle. He found Meg at the front desk. He talked to her about how everyone got along during meal times when the double doors leading into the ward made it known that they were being opened.
“He needs to mind his business,” Dean read, a smile in his voice, Ivy wasn't wrong Marv was a bit nosey and Ivy sometimes was the target of his boredom.
”I think we should get some pacifiers, ” Cas said, nodding to Dean, who was sucking on his thumb as well.
Cas sent Dean a text hoping it wasn't too late to join them. He headed to the bathroom while waiting for Dean to message him back. Looking in the mirror, he was surprised to see the dark circles that had begun to form from the lack of sleep due to the weird dreams had disappeared altogether, “What the fuck is going on?” he whispered. His phone finally went off. After a few moments, a text from Dean saying he was more than welcome to come over still they were just getting started.
Cas just smiled, he was going to make Dean wait, as much as he would love to take the boy right then and there. He moved his hand, trailing a finger up his taint to the tiny cock between the Omegas legs, wrapping his hand around it. Moving it painfully slow as Dean squirmed for more friction.
Jimmy took a deep breath. He really didn't want to know the answer, but he did want to know the answer, “Were you pregnant?” he whispered, just loud enough for her to hear.
He made sure he had everything he needed by his bed so he wouldn't miss anything. Fake slick, a towel, and a bottle of water for afterward, he always seemed to be parched after. He made himself more comfortable as the black screen showed the nest the Omega used to start his show. The camera was always angled not to show his face. He longed to know who was making him hard, but he had a pretty thing in his English class he could use to replace the faceless person on the screen.
But his mind keeps racing. The nausea gets worse. Gabriel’s story stays inside his brain, repeating in a sinister voice.
“No, I’m Madonna. Yes, I’m Gabriel. Geez, did you lose brain cells over the years?” He glances around. “You got any food?”
“Whatever,” he says, finishing his beer.“We don’t need her, right?” The words pain him to say; he forces a tight smile regardless. He stands and grabs another beer. “You, me, Cas. Us three is family.”
“He really okay?” Dean finally asks in a whisper, terrified to rupture the heavy silence. This has to be a dream, right? He’s waited so long to hear Jody say those words. He was beginning to expect they’d never come, not in reality. He’s afraid to pinch himself. Afraid he’s going to wake up alone in his bed, the empty silence of the house mocking him.
No. No, I’m sure of it. I felt your grace, Castiel. It’s warm and sweet. You want to protect Mother. You protected me, and fathers protect their children.
“We can get it out,” Dean says, fighting to hold Gabriel’s gaze. It’s different from Cas’s gaze; still concentrated, but Cas looks at him like he’s trying to figure out a puzzle. Like there’s something in Dean he can’t quite understand, no matter how hard he tries, no matter how he examines the angles. Gabriel’s looking at Dean with murder in his eyes; it’s probably not outside his powers to kill Dean with just a thought. “I know a witch, she can open the Cage. We’ll get that piece of his grace—it’ll power him up, right?” Like sticking an overpowered battery into a cellphone.
And then he finds himself in front of The Door. He waits. And waits. And his heart is tight and burning in his chest again, just like it was when Billie was crushing it from the inside. Except this time there’s no comfortable, familiar arm holding him up. No voice by his ear, reassuring, “I’ve got you, I’ve got you.” It’s just him, and The Door, and the pain that won’t go away, no matter how much he sleeps, or drinks, or wishes it would just
of juice. Cas needed the souls from Purgatory to stand on an even playing field against Raphael. No average angel would even dare to face off against an archangel.
He sets the plates nicely, taking great care to make sure everything is neatly arranged. Then he stares at his work, at his hands, and carries them back to the library. He slides one plate in front of Sam.
Later that night, Dean goes back into the library and finds the book. He sits at the table and turns on the lamp; it's harsh and makes a soft buzzing noise. Dean’s careful with the pages, turning them gently.
I hope everyone is staying safe. If you're a healthcare worker, a grocer, a gas station employee, or a restaurant worker, thank you helping keep society stable at this crazy time. You're so appreciated!
Dean’s hand comes up and curls into the long hair. “You’re safe now,” he mutters softly, rocking slightly. “It’s okay.” Dean’s hand brushes against a hidden bump on the back of Cas’s head; Cas flinches, but then relaxes back into Dean. Dean’s hand is still by the invisible wound, throat tight.
He thinks of his mother. Wonders if she’s okay. Just because Dean’s mad at her, doesn’t mean he doesn’t want her to be okay. He reaches out for his phone and scrolls through her messages. Weeks worth of them, coming every two or three days, letting him know where she is, what kind of case she’s working on, how it went. Her latest message from last night, reads:
When he wakes up, it’s late into the evening. His head hurts. His mouth is dry. Dean pulls on his robe and stumbles out of his room. Sam’s nowhere to be seen. Dean’s footsteps echo in the large, open bunker as he climbs to the library. His phone is still on the table. He flips it over.
He watches Cas’s chest rise and fall, feels the warmth of his breath from his nostrils, watches his eyes flicker under his lids, and wonders what he might be dreaming about. This isn’t waiting beside a comatose patient; it’s simply watching a sleeping partner, in the midst of a peaceful dream.
There’s a knock on the door. Dean jumps, startled, heart hammering inside his chest. The knock comes again, faster. Dean glances down the hallway, but there’s no sign of Sam. Dean grabs the gun that’s under the table and checks to make sure it’s loaded. It is. He flicks the safety off, but keeps his finger parallel to the barrel. He walks up the stairs, which creak under his weight.
“I know what you told Sam. But see, I’m not Sam. I’m—I’m here, Cas. You and Sam both asked where I was, and well, now I’m here.” Dean pats the sides of his legs for something to do with his hands. He’s stared down the devil himself, but somehow, he’s never been more nervous in his life than at this very moment.
That last glimpse of Cas’s face haunts Dean at night, and the bunker door closing behind Cas echoes in Dean’s skull when there’s no other noise to cover it up.
“Not sure. This is Lucifer we’re talking about, after all, and in case you weren’t aware, that guy’s preeeeeetty crazy. Does the apple fall far from the tree? Does it even leave the branch?”
Jody smiles. She pats Dean’s cheek. “I know. You’re good for him.” She kisses Dean’s cheek. “Call us soon as he’s discharged, okay?”
He looks back down at the book, but the ink is smudged, and the writing is hard to decipher, anyway. Middle English is so wordy; why did people take ten words to say when three would suffice? Not to mention the ancient pages smell, like aged milk, and the calligraphy is overly fancy. So many loops and squiggles for no practical reason. He has to be careful turning each page, because the paper is brittle, and even just sitting out in the open air like this could cause decay.
It’s past midnight when Sam enters, arms crossed over his chest. “You need a break. Go to the motel.”
Dean’s not going to leave; won’t even consider the prospect of going home until he’s gotten his shot at fixing things with Cas.
Gabriel rolls up his sleeves. “Staying away from the hospital was the best thing. If he suddenly got better, like angels tend to do, there’d be no way to explain it.”
And then Eileen’s shoved him against the wall, her elbow pushed into his neck. “Stop,” she says, looking him dead in the eye. “Dean, you need help.” She looks over her shoulder. “Sam, are you okay?”
Dean’s head spins if he thinks about it too much. How fickle life is; how much can change at the drop of a hat, for good and for bad. Henrickson parks. Then, for the first time in the entire trip, he looks back at Dean.
Having Gabriel on their side was a big win, even if Dean’s still doubtful about his intentions and loyalties. Having two archangels? They might actually have a shot at this.
“Wait, my brother was up before me?” Cas asked as he got out of the bed, looking around for his duffle bag of clothes to change.
He flopped back onto the bed, covering his eyes with his arm as Dean sat next to him. Leaning over the other boy’s body while reaching for his hand and lacing their fingers together. He laid his head on Cas’ chest, listening to his heartbeat.
“What's today?” Cas asked, confused as he looked around the cafe, smiling when he met the eyes of a sweet young thing at a booth, all by his lonesome.
“Had to pee, bad timing,” Ivy said, lifting her head to look at Cas before laying it back down on the other man's shoulder.
"Stell, you scared me this morning. I know you are mad, and I promise that will never happen again," Jimmy said, opening the door to the playroom.
“Come on Doc you can eat with us,” Benny said clapping Cas on the shoulder before leaving the room and heading down the hall to find Ivy.
Reading the instructions, he looked up, “Castee-el,” Dean pronounced, looking up and waiting for the robot to open his eyes. He sighed and looked around, giving it a little more time before trying again. Maybe he was saying it wrong? Dean tried a few more times before giving up, deciding to get a coffee, swearing at himself for not going with a common name. Muttering the name over and over as he got everything ready to make his drink.
She smiled and waved bye followed Meg out, who turned back to Cas. “I'll be down in a minute,” Meg said to Ivy with a nod. Ivy made her way down th hall, making sure she was out of earshot. Meg looked at Cas. “She never does that, ever she's been here nine years, and you are the first to get her to laugh other than Dean,” she said, excitement in her voice; this was a big step for Ivy.
"She is a hearing dog for Stella," Jimmy said, sighing as Stella picked up the puppy, wagging her finger at it, babbling.
His wing twitching with his annoyance as he turned and faced Cas. “Exactly! It's the dirty little secrete, but now it's out, and I wanna make sure my sister is safe and the baby,” Dean bit out at Cas. he wasn't mad at Cas. He didn't know, and no one prepared the brothers for what could possibly happen. They walked the rest of the way to the bakery in silence; Dean didn't say anything, and Cas didn't ask. He figured it was best to let the topic go.
“I don't know control would be my best guest” Cas suggested with a shrug in truth he didn't know but it was his best guess.
“Can you bring her? I want to speak with her,’ Cas asked, walking back to his office, not waiting for Meg to answer. He wanted to get away from her after making a fool of himself with Ivy’s brother.
“I'm so happy you are here; we have to go get fitted for the dinner tonight,” Blue said, clapping her hands before grabbing the two fairies by hand dragging them behind her talking a mile a minute.
The next morning Stella had a doctor's appointment to check her hearing, and Dean had to go to daycare alone. He was sad because they always did everything together. Dean was happy to see Benny and Charlie were already there, setting up the blocks for them to play.
Cas made his way down the stairs, his hair messy and dressed in one of Dean's PJ bottoms and no shirt. Clover whistled at him and giggled when he rolled his eyes, giving her a wave as he headed to the coffee pot.
"I'm with little Miss I would be mad too. Yes, I brought her down she was sitting on the steps when I came in this morning," Elle said, setting a plate of food in front of Jimmy.
Ivy swallowed and shook her head hard telling them no, they weren't sure if she meant no she didn't know or no, she wasn't going to say to them.
“Restrained, she knows she's not allowed pens. She put up a fight but I got her to calm down,” Roy replied like he proud that he a two hundred pound man was about to subdue a hundred pound girl.
“Yeah, we don't bring the thing that burned Pam's eyes out of her skull,” Harper said, slamming the cans of paint on the bench.
The doctor came in a short round man with no hair, and a red face smiled softly at Stella, who hid behind Jimmy. He laughed and waved, turning his attention to Cas.
Dean was playing with blocks when Jimmy and Stella came in, Dea was excited to show his sister all the cool stuff they could play with, she smiled at him.
“Have I done something to offend you? Am I not what you ordered?” Castiel asked almost robotically, looking deep into Dean's eyes.
“Fuck you,” Jimmy yelled. He promised Ivy that he would be there this weekend to work on his relationship with Cas.
Cas nodded, saying he had no clue who that was, but he was happy if it was helping. Once the plan was in the air, Dean ordered a whiskey on the rocks hoping it would help relax him enough to enjoy the alone time with his Dom.
“No, Daddy hit us,” Ivy said, looking away, feeling ashamed of what happened after that, “You know about other stuff,” she added in a whisper.
Cas grabbed hold of Dean's hair as he began thrusting back and forth until the boy was gagging, tears sprang from his eyes, and he could feel his knot growing. He pressed the Omegas head down until his nose was flush with his hairs before letting him off. The Alpha picked up Dean and tossed him back onto the bed, kicking off his shoes and pants before grabbing him again to flip him over. Kneeling at the edge of the bed, he pulled Dean by the thighs burying his face in his ass, lapping up the slick that was leaking like crazy. It was as sweet as Cas had imagined it would taste. The fact that Dean was moaning and attempting to hold his ass open wider to give Cas better access was too much, he needed to be inside of him.
The men laughed and introduced themselves the messy-haired one was Castiel, and he was going to be Dean's new daddy while the other one was Jimmy, and he was going to take care of Stella.
“Did you text Sammy? Is he coming?” Clover asked, sniffing, then wiping her nose on the sleeve of her sweater.
“How do you know that?” Cas asked he was under the notion that they didn’t know who they were related to only if they were twins where the siblings kept together.
Jimmy shook his head and kissed Stellas cheek, setting her down, he walked to the crate and opened the door. A little silver puppy trotted out sniffing the air; it had on a little yellow vest that said "In Training" on it.
“You better not get my sister in trouble; remember what happened last time?’ Dean asked, giving the purple-haired fairy a pointed look.
She waved the gun, telling him to go on, “Your name is Harper Lee Winchester, we were born January twenty-fourth nineteen-seventy-nine, our Mom was Mary, our dad was John,” he said.
A huge smile spread across Dean's face. This was the first time Cas had said they were boyfriends; he shook Gabriel's hand, saying it was nice to meet him, and he was excited to meet the rest of the family. Gabriel nodded, saying they were excited to meet Dean too. He was the first Sub to take Cas completely off the market, Gabriel said, looking over his shoulder at Dean as they walked to the parking garage.
“Do you know what they are about?” Cas asked; he was sure if some asked, they would have made a note in her file about it, but he didn't see anything.
Ivy looked up when Jo called her name she had a box in her hand and a smile on her face. Ivy never got mail to this was exciting.
She shook her head, "we share everything, why not the puppy, you have to help me train her, and give her a name," Stella said, smiling.
“I'm Castiel,” he replied, flipping the pages of one of the books they brought into the barn with them.
“I know I had to go across town to get her favorite, and I called ahead of time to let Ivy know,” Dean replied, holding up a pie.
“Um, tonight my buddy Benny is gonna come by with me to see Ivy,” Dean informed Cas stepping further into the office.
“Daddy, Cole said he didn’t like you or us,” Dean said as they sat around the table in the middle of the office to eat.
Dean woke up the next morning to the sound of his alarm and a pounding headache; the last thing he remembered was Cas calling, punching the wall, and the bottle of whiskey. The damn bottle was half empty. He knocked it over getting up off the couch. Dean had to get to the garage this morning. He was working on restoration they paid more than his normal oil changes. Still, they took up a lot of his time; it cut into the amount of time he got to spend with Ivy. He showered quickly, grabbing something quick to eat and head off to work; hopefully, Bobby would notice he was hung over.
Jimmy groaned into the phone, which brought Cas back to the conversation at hand, “The Winchesters are coming in today; we are meeting the twins,” he reminded his twin.
Dean was sleepy by the time they got done with lunch, last week after the park and the twins said they had fun Jimmy and Cas decided they would take their babies out separately once in a while like Cas taking Dean to the car museum and Jimmy had some special planned for Stella during the week after her doctors appointment.
Cas shook his head and started laughing. There was no way. Alfie nodded, showing Cas the date on his phone; taking the phone, he attempted to remember what happened. Alfie asked again if Cas was alright; the man nodded, heading over to the couch to sit down, handing Alfie back his phone as he passed him. “You don't have to stay; I'm feeling much better now,” Cas said robotically, not looking at Alfie. He was shocked at the loss of two days.
“I know I just I think I know what happened when she was younger and I don't know how to bring it up to Dean,” Cas said rubbing his face and looking over at the nurse.
Cas headed back to his office to read over the files again seeing what he missed he didn’t remember reading anything about Ivy being in a group home maybe something happened there.
Jimmy fixed his coffee, taking a seat at the table next to Stella, who was looking down at her tray, not paying any attention to Jimmy, who was doing his best not to be upset that she was still mad.
Sam’s eyes are full of disappointment. He shakes his head. Eileen’s eyes are wide and worried. “It’s nine a.m., dude.”
They wait uncomfortably. Every passing second grates on Dean’s anxiety. And he wishes he’d grabbed onto Gabriel, or demanded to board Angel Air. Even if it hurt his stomach and gave him a migraine, even if it left him backed up for weeks, he’d take it, to see Cas, to see what happened, to make sure he was okay. Did Gabriel really have Cas’s best interests at heart?
“Bullshit.” Dean approaches Jack. “You brought everyone else back just like that.” Dean snaps his fingers.
Un-beta'd because I only got it finished this morning, but I want to share with you all! If you enjoy, please leave a comment! Thanks for all the support. <3
“We don’t need them to be our friends. Hell, we don’t even need to like them! But we do have a common interest. This is about the world, Dean, not your pride. Can’t you stow it for once in your life?”
This is all that is between him and Cas. After months of knowing nothing, he now knows that Cas is on the other side of this door. He just has to open it. He’s terrified. He can’t make himself raise his arm and twist the handle. He can’t make himself knock. He stands there, stupefied, and doesn’t notice the doctor approaching them until she’s right beside Dean.
Dean recoils, angry. He glares, fingers clenching into fists. “Why the hell not? He deserves to know.”
Castiel’s grace doesn’t react at all. It doesn’t shrink away. It doesn’t grow bigger. The scrapes on Castiel’s hand don’t heal, nor does Castiel’s battered grace. The bruises still stay dark and malevolent against the background of his skin.
He putters around. Cleans up the library, makes breakfast—bacon and pancakes. Sam makes a face at him, comments about his cholesterol, but snags some bacon anyway, and drinks three cups of coffee before he stands up again.
“I’ll help you stop Lucifer,” he says, almost growling, “but I mean it. My way, or I’m out. Capiche?”
And it’s crazy to think how his family has grown, extended to realms he never would have imagined. Once, all he needed by his side was Sam. They, alone, were a family. And now that’s grown to include Castiel, and Eileen. Jody, Donna and the girls. Claire and Cas text fairly often—Dean’s caught snippets here and there, and it mostly seems a trading of memes—though sometimes Claire reaches out to Cas, or to him and Sam, for advice on a hunt. Garth and his wife, who, last time they spoke, were expecting. He’s got people.
At last, Gabriel finds it. The remnants of Castiel’s grace. It’s hidden deep in his chest, like it's hiding from harm. And its shape resembles that of Castiel’s wings. It’s wounded, curled in on itself, and dim. Hardly the supernova that is breathed into all angels upon their birth. Not at all like what it was years ago, when Gabriel played with the boys in the television; it hadn’t been a supernova, but it’d still been bright and blue, no doubt the grace of a warrior. Gabriel reaches out with his grace, wrapping it around Castiel’s. He breathes, pulsing his grace into Castiel’s, focusing on healing the wounds.
“Henrickson told me before he left. KCPD have finished surveying the scene. Two stab wounds, one to the back of the neck, the other right through the heart.”
Sam sighs and thumbs at the pages over the giant, dusty tome in front of him. “Surprisingly, there’s very little lore on the subject of a half-archangel baby. And by little, I mean, zip. And by zip, I mean absolutely nothing.” He closes the book with a hard thump. Dust dances in the air.
“Anyway, he’s here to help with Rosemary’s baby. Gabriel thinks the kid can be good. What do you think?”
He doesn’t know how long they sit like that, Cas sobbing, and Dean brushing his hair, careful to avoid that wounded spot. It’s long enough that the sun finally sets, enclosing them in darkness. Long enough that Cas cries himself out, sighs, and deflates against Dean.
Cas tries, fails. Tries again, fails. The third time he manages to catch his breath enough to hold it, for just a few seconds before the air escapes in a wheeze.
All that he is, though, is grateful that Cas is alive, that Cas is here; his heat against Dean’s skin, his breath close to Dean’s ear. Alive, alive. Anything else, they can work through. They’ll figure it out. They can fix it. Death can’t be fixed, but they can fix this, so Dean isn’t angry, and he’s not infuriated, and he’s not pissed off. He’s relieved.
Gabriel sees old scars and wounds. He assesses their origin: hellfire, a demon claw, a stab from an angel blade. There are lots of those, criss-crossing everywhere across his torso, face, eyes. There’s hardly a place on him that isn’t scarred in some fashion, old or new, heavenly or hellish. Even Castiel’s wings are in tatters, feathers barely hanging onto the bones, if there are any at all.
Dean looks at the ceiling and more hot, salty tears run down his face. Five days of this? How is Cas supposed to survive five days of this? How is Dean? Dean’s not sure which is worse: witnessing Cas suffer and not being able to do anything about it, or when Cas was missing and he knew nothing. Having Cas’s pain thrust in his face certainly is different than the horrors Dean’s mind played out.
Dean rolls his eyes and clenches his teeth. His tendons pull taut under his skin. That was over a year ago. A year, he was kept in the dark, Cas carried that — that
Castiel looked like he was trying to process the answer, “I was built for you according to your specifications. Why would I say, no? You are attractive,” He said bluntly, the confusion clear on the robot’s face.
Stella jumped off the table, hiding in a corner, making herself small, putting her head down. She was shaking; she didn't like the doctors; they always poked her and put things in her. The last doctor made her hurt.
“No one has a right to assign death but God. I took a man’s life, Dean. I violated God’s most sacred law. That can’t be excused.”
The note outside labels the patient as Doe, John. Henrickson is busy explaining that it’s for safety reasons, but Dean barely hears him.
A few minutes later, Sam appears rubbing his eyes. “Dean, it is three in the morning, what the fuck are you — Jack?”
WARNINGS: In this chapter, Castiel begins to speak about his abuse. There is discussions of violence and rape. Keep yourselves safe.
Dean can live with that. He wants to be the one to put a knife through Lucifer’s heart; for all the pain he caused to humanity, to Dean’s family. Dean will kill him, and he will make sure it’s slow and painful.
