"If you let me make breakfast with no interruptions on your part." Cas assured. Dean licked his bottom lip with dark eyes then leant forward to press their lips together. "Go, or our deal no longer stands." Cas murmured against Dean's lips after a few seconds. Dean raised his hands in surrender and backed up with a smirk. Cas shook his head fondly and turned back to the hob to finish the pancakes. "Here you go." He said as he placed the plates of pancakes in front of the Winchester brothers.
"Papa?" Levi mumbled sleepily. Dean chuckled and pulled the boy to his chest, his heart swelling when Levi nuzzled his face against Dean's bare chest. "Daddy." Levi decided after a moment. Dean pulled his son closer, sighing contently at the warmth coming from the boy, slipping into welcome sleep.
"Sammy and I are going on the hunt in a bit, it shouldn't take more than a few days" Dean explained softly. Cas hummed in confusion and looked over his shoulder to glance out of the window, it was still dark outside.
"Omega." Dean said firmly. Castiel's mouth snapped shut and he averted his gaze back to the table, exposing his neck minutely. Sam blinked in surprise again at the difference.
Dean held Cas close as they both laid on one of the bed's in the motel room. Dean whispered to Cas, still trying to calm her down. Both were feeling an odd buzzing throughout their bodies and it was making them tired, which made the almost human panic.
"How could you disappear on a hunt and leave your family behind?" Mary hissed. Dean clenched his jaw then whipped around and slammed the lamp off the side table. Cas and Sam flinched as the lamp smashed against the floor, John and Mary however didn't react.
"Tell us what you know." Dean reasoned calmly. Cas ran his hand through his hair nervously as his heart started beat faster.
"Levi, shoes and coat on now please." Dean called up the stairs where he could hear Levi running around. Cas laid a comforting hand on Dean's chest and looked up at him.
"I'm confused." Cas answered without taking his eyes off of Levi. Sam hummed. "He was being a dick but now he's acting like he did before."
"Get the house ready for the storm." Dean finally said, moving away from Cas. Dean got into his car and pulled out of the driveway.
"Yes, thank you." Jack answered eventually. "Where's... Dean?" He looked around expectantly, looking for the older Winchester, and his eyes fell on the sheet covered body. "Is... is this my father?" Jack asked hesitantly, reaching is hand out to lay it on Cas' chest.
It was nothing like when he was with Dean, all he felt was pain. He wanted it to stop. He wanted Dean.
"So, we've got 8 months left to go until we meet baby Winchester number 2." Dean commented with a grin. Cas giggled and rested his head on Dean's chest.
"I don't know if I can be here." Dean whispered, his eyes flicking around the room, never landing on his friends and never landing on the security puppet.
"Papa, Daddy make egg!" Levi exclaimed excitedly. Cas smiled fondly at his son and glanced over at Dean.
"Grubs up." Dean announced as he put the four full plates on the dining table. Sam stood with his laptop and Cas with her book. "Nope, laptop and book away. We're having a family dinner." Dean said, Gabriel turned the corner with a laugh. Sam and Cas put their forms on entertainment on the couch then sat at the table as Dean placed bottles of coke next to their plates. They ate together happily, talking and joking together. Afterwards Gabriel used his angel powers to clean everything up and Sam and Cas returned to their places on the couch. Dean flopped down in the middle of them and sighed loudly.
"Well, Levi was born through my grace, whereas this baby is growing in a womb. So this baby will take the usual 9 months and will come out via a birth canal that will form during labour." Castiel explained simply.
"I know who he is, I want to know why he's here." John asked. Castiel whined at the hardness in the older alpha's voice.
"He went to a motel, he doesn't want to be here right now." Sam said, his gaze back on his laptop screen so he failed to see the hurt on Dean's face.
"I love you, angel, unconditionally." Dean declared. Cas felt tears in his eyes again but he knew they were of joy rather than sorrow. Dean tilted his head up so that he could push their lips together. Cas wrapped his arms around Dean's neck and, after a moment, he pulled away from the kiss to hug Dean tightly.
"Yeah! He chase, he monster!" Levi shouted with a laugh. Cas chuckled at his son and started to creep forward.
"Wait, I don't want to tell mummy yet." Dan said shaking his head. Mark wrapped his arm around the younger boy.
"The night before the attack." Dean answered after a moment. The doctor nodded and wrote in the file.
"So, Cas, how did your interviews go?" Sam asked conversationally. Cas smiled brightly and turned towards the younger brother.
"Maybe it's the same person that had opened the window in the first place?" Phil guessed. Dean hummed.
"If he's my son why did you wait six years to tell me about him?" Dean asked. Lisa shrugged and tried to get closer to the man but found that Cas was in the way.
"I feel like we're going to find Jimmy and Eli." Cas reiterated. "I'm not saying that I suddenly think they're alive and well but I think we're going to find them and I feel hope, hope that they are alive. I haven't had hope that they're alive since the first month after they'd been taken." Dan's eyes were wide with shock.
"Alpha, here." Mick announced his return. He laid the book carefully on the table in front of Dean and turned to Castiel. "Hello, my name is Mick Davis." The alpha introduced with a warm smile. Castiel looked to Dean for confirmation that he could shake the hand that was being offered to him.
"Just, please." Dean said. Cas' lips twitched into a little smile before she picked her book up off of the coffee table.
"Levi why didn't you listen to daddy?" Cas asked. Levi shrugged sadly and messed with his food for a moment.
"Cas! Nice to see you awake, man." Sam exclaimed, pulling Cas into a tight, brotherly hug. "How are you feeling? How's Levi?" Sam asked with a happy grin.
"Hello, Jessica. I'm Castiel." He greeted happily. The omega in front of him was beautiful; her long hair framed her face, her eyes were kind and unassuming.
"Brother, I need to to focus all your attention on your grace." Gabriel said softly. He was sat behind Sam with his hands resting on Cas' stomach. Cas closed his eyes, his eyebrows furrowed in pain. He squeezed both Winchester's hands as another wave of pain flowed through him.
"Sammy, what happened?" Dean asked. He stood up as soon as Cas sat up. Cas looked around behind Sam then his eyebrows furrowed.
"Let's get going." Said Gabriel as the archangel headed towards the door. Dean stood and positioned Cas on his hip, ensuring that the large shirt covered her completely, then he followed Gabriel out the door. Sam watched them walk out the door and made a move to follow them but hesitated. Gabriel had said that the spell on Cas was due to 'other forces' but there was a hint of pride in his tone,
"Are you telling us that you came up with this idea but didn't have a plan in the way of actually getting in?!" Dan lectured in shock. Mark chuckled nervously and nodded.
"What do you want to watch, Cas?" Dean asked after a minute, startling Cas slightly. Cas smiled to himself and turned to Dean.
"Right here, big boy." Not-Cas purred, with a seductive smile. "I'm your angel 100%. I can be anything you want, baby." Dean growled and shoved again.
"My family, my brothers and my father, treat me as an equal. I do not bare my neck, I do not submit to any alpha further than a slight exposure of my neck out of respect for my family who are alphas." Castiel defended. He was aware that he had been baring his neck towards Winchester's king but he didn't want to try to explain the way the Alpha made him feel to the younger alpha.
"I often spoke to my father, before I was born..." Jack elaborated when he saw Sam's face, "He spoke fondly of you and Dean." Sam smiled softly upon hearing that; he knew that Cas regarded him as a brother but he was never sure.
. Castiel's comforting words were often a welcome change to the self-depreciation that usually ran through, however, now, he wouldn't get to see the mix of fond sadness and adoration, he'd never get to see that again. This didn't feel like all those other times, this felt final. Like the end of the line. Reluctantly, he laid a sheet over Cas' body. With a deep, shaky sigh, he took one last look at Cas' face then he covered it.
"Cassie!" Gabriel cheered through a mouthful of food. "You look stunning, brother." He continued sincerely after he swallowed. Castiel flushed and fiddled with the skirt of his dress shyly.
"No, Balthazar, the Day of the Spirits is one of the most important days in a wolf's year and you're faffing around in the stables when you were instructed to be here with your brothers." Chuck fumed, "Next thing you know, you'll be aloof on the Full Moon."
"Oh my, isn't he the cutest little thing?" She said. Dean flashed her a charming smile and Cas' heart clenched painfully. Levi turned at the sound of the voice and the woman's cooing intensified. "Look at those eyes! Half yours half his mom's?" She asked. Sam winced and turned to Cas, who had the beginnings of tears pooling in his eyes. Dean nodded with a flirty smirk. The woman looked over at the men further down the aisle. "Where
"Castiel Novak." Castiel greeted shyly. Donna beamed and pulled him into a hug. Castiel huffed in surprise when she subtly scented him.
"Can you pass me my drink?" Cas asked quietly, pointing vaguely towards the coffee table that he couldn't quite reach. Dean chuckled and reached over, stretching slightly to grab it, and got Cas' hot chocolate. "Thank you." Cas turned his head slightly and kissed Dean's shoulder, the only part he could reach.
"Cas, these are the Elders; my father, Bobby, Missouri, Rufus, Donatello and Jody. My brother joins the meetings because I trust his judgement." Dean introduced, pointing to each member at the table in turn. "Benny and Cole will be arriving shortly." Dean pulled the head chair away from the table and lead Castiel to sit down while he stood next to the Omega.
"The Omega is clearly a spy, he's going to report back to his family. They'll plan an attack." Rufus rambled.
"Because I have a family now, what if I didn't come home? What if I get killed on a job and Levi has to grow up with one dad? What if you realise how stupid it is for you to continuously wait for me at home while I'm out getting hurt and leave me? What if I come back from a hunt and you've packed up Honey and taken Levi somewhere?" Dean asked, his voice low and insecure. Cas chuckled at the man and put his finger under Dean's chin so that their eyes would meet.
"Whatever. Have you told the elders yet?" Sam asked. Castiel found him to be fairly bratty towards his brother but he supposed that the situation allowed it.
"He should be down soon, he went up 10 minutes ago." Sam piped up from the couch. Cas hummed and carried Levi to the living room and eased himself onto the arm chair. He relaxed into the chair and watched the show that Sam had put on while he waited for Dean.
His heart rate increased when the first boom of fireworks rumbled though the castle. It was time. He folded the map neatly and put it in his satchel before blowing out the candle and carefully leaving his room. He checked the hallways to make sure there wasn't any servants there then he hurried out down to a small passage that lead to the empty servants quarters. He easily navigated through the rooms until he reached the door that lead to the castle grounds. The sounds of the fireworks on the other side of the castle covered the sound of him swinging the gate open and locking it behind him.
The sun was beginning to fall behind the trees when Cas pulled up to Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria. His friends were already waiting for him by their cars, they'd parked in the spaces that were furthest from the building- which Cas found illogical because if they had to run then their cars would be further from them. With a shake of his head, Cas got out of his car and approached his friends. Dean looked at him in question when the younger boy came to a stop in front of them, asking if he was still ok to go in, Cas nodded and gave Dean a small smile.
"What?... How?... What's changed your mind?" Dan asked. He was struggling to fathom the fact that his best friend was finally seeing it his way, that he finally had some hope in his eyes too.
"Just talk to your brother." He said before moving on to his patients. "Hello Mr Humpfrey, how are you feeling?"
"Cas, listen to me. I know I messed up, and I'm sorry, I shouldn't have treated you the way I did when you got your junk back. I do return the sentiment, Cas, I really do and I'm working on treating you better. However, you did not betray me Cas. I promise you, you didn't betray me. That shifter used your weakness against you and it isn't your fault you gave in, I did the same with the siren but we can move on. We can just forget about it." Dean reassured gently. Cas looked at Dean surprised.
However, it wasn't long before a loud crash distracted Aether long enough for Sam and Dean to push him back to where they'd agreed earlier. Immediately, Aether slammed his fist on the floor and split the ground in two, separating the brothers. The crack in the rock filled with water and Aether looked around cautiously but angrily. Sam surged forward to tackle the Elemental but was thrown back then surrounded by fire to prevent another attempt to take him down. Dean shouted out for his brother, pulling away from Cas' grip. "Gabe, get a move on!" Dean yelled frantically as he looked for a way to get over the gap. Gabriel conjured a fire to trap Aether.
"I doubt that. I can't just stay here all the time, I'll need to take Levi out sometimes. I have to put both of us in danger every time that we go out. And I know it. You know it too." Cas continued. Gabriel sighed and retreated to his room. The Winchester's watched Cas carefully but said nothing. Sam eyed Dean skeptically. The older Winchester had sat as far away from Cas as he could, Levi sat between them. After a moment of watching Levi, Dean stood and left to retrieve his laptop. When he returned, he heard Cas talking quietly to both Sam and Levi. "I knew it was too good to be true."
"Dean." Sam called as his older brother turned to walk away. "How are you and Cas?" Dean pulled out the chair next to Sam then sat.
"Come on, wake up." Cas slowly opened her eyes. Gabriel's blurry face came into view. "That's it, brother. I'm here. You need to be awake so I can heal you." Cas blinked a few times and dizzily looked around. Gabriel pressed his hand to Cas' cheek, healing all her wounds. Cas coughed uncomfortably then met her brother's eyes. Gabriel let out a laugh of relief and pulled his brother into a hug. "I'm so glad to see you. Why didn't you call me right away?" He asked as he untied Cas' restraints. The younger angel looked down ashamed without a word so the archangel resorted to reading the angel's memory. "Oh, Cassie, none of that is true." Gabriel murmured. Cas sniffled.
"... Very." Dean chuckled and stroked his thumb over Cas' cheek before bending down to kiss Cas' stomach.
"When we were kids, we didn't know that the cameras existed, we didn't care. Cameras are always put in places that has the best field of vision, high up. With cameras high up and arcade games in the way, there's no way we could have seen them when we were kids but now we could find them and see what happened that day." Phil watched Dean thoughtfully.
"It goes to dad's workshop." Cas answered. He stood and approached the door, aware of the other's following him. He pushed the door open and quickly flicked on the light to flush out the darkness. He gestured for his friends to follow him as he stepped over the threshold of the room.
"Go ahead, buggy." Dean encouraged. Levi looked back at his parents then looked back to Sam with a gummy grin.
Dean had just started to believe that, that Cas wanted to stay with them, be a family with them. But now, it didn't matter how many times he called, Cas just wasn't coming back; and he'd been calling for hours. He'd been knelt by Cas' body calling, screaming, for him to come back. But he didn't. He could see Cas' wings burnt into the mud, he had seen Cas' grace burn out, the blade ripping though the angel.
"Yeah, he pulled Dean from Hell a few years back." Bobby answered. John's head whipped around to look at Bobby then his gaze fell on Dean.
"Levi, answer your Papa, please." Dean said sternly as he continued to make Cas' coffee. Levi frowned at his father and turned to Cas.
"The siren, he had a friend. A shapeshifter." Cas took a deep breath before he continued, "I was tied up again, it was reminiscent of when I was taken by my brothers, I tried to call for Gabriel but I couldn't. The shapeshifter, he looked like you, Dean. He said he'd chosen a form that I would find pleasing, that would hurt me the most." Cas moved his arms to rest his hands on Levi's back, he gently ran his fingers over his perfect nails to avoid looking at Dean while he told the rest of his story, "He said that the siren wanted to become human and was going to use my visage to achieve that with you. He said that we could have some 'fun' before his friend got there. I'm sorry, Dean, I allowed another to... to touch me. And I know you don't return the sentiment anymore but, to me, I have betrayed you. I allowed him to mark me and kiss me without much of a fight. He'd assured me that it would be like being with you and I gave into temptation, I just wanted to experience what we had just one more time. I swear to you, I feel awful. I'm so sorry, Dean. I know I should have fought to keep him from touching me, I should have fought to stop him from marking me. But know that despite our differences in opinion towards each other, I am loyal to you." Dean listened without a word but shook his head when Cas finished.
"I agree but he definitely has some of your features. Like his eyes, they're very clearly half yours and half Dean's." She pressed. Cas' mind raced.
"I should have been paying more attention to her, I should have done something about the looks she was getting."  Gabriel growled.
"No, no Levi, it wasn't a monster." Dean laughed. Levi leant back to look at his dad, his head tilted in confusion.
"How are you doin', man?" Dean asked. Cas nodded hesitantly. "I mean, you went through a lot and I just want to see how you're holding up." Cas silently shrugged his shoulders.
"What?" He asked softly, unsure of if he heard him right. Dean had the same shock and uncertainty in his eyes.
"Hey Levi, were you a good boy for granny, grandpa and uncle Bobby?" Dean asked. Levi nodded with a gummy grin that resembled Cas'.
"King Charles has sent his most innocent man over enemy lines, he's going to break us." Rufus snapped. Dean let out an easy laugh.
"Dean, we don't need that." Cas said, repeating himself for seemingly the millionth time since they started shopping.
"I know." He turned to the older Winchester's with a sad smile. "But hunting gives him a sense of purpose. He's been doing most of his life, he can't just... stop." Cas reasoned but Mary's face hardened and she stormed away with John following close behind.
"This is all your fault." Cas muttered. Dean's head snapped towards Cas in shock, he couldn't believe what he'd just heard.
"We've talked about this, Mary, I never was a fucking child!" Dean yelled. Mary looked away, her gaze landing on Sam who had his arm wrapped reassuringly around Cas' shoulders. "I went from regular 4 year old to full time parent in an instant. So don't you dare tell me how to look after my family." Dean roared. Mary flinched at that and stood down. John put his hands on Mary's shoulder and pulled her backwards. Dean stood in place breathing heavily as he tried to calm down. Cas stumbled towards Dean and wrapped his arms around the man, the hunter slowly relaxed into Cas' hold. "Where's Levi?" Dean asked the angel, his voice much quieter than before.
"Ok, bit of pressure." Was Cas' only warning before the doctor pushed the probe in. Cas winced and squeezed Dean's hand, which Dean replied with a reassuring kiss to Cas' lips. Dr Ottoway frowned and moved the probe slightly, he leant forward on his stool to look at the screen more closely. "Mr Winchester, when... When did you say you were assaulted?" The doctor asked, not taking his eyes away from the screen.
"It's been like 6 years, Lisa. And we were barely dating, it was 4 days." Dean argued. Lisa rolled her eyes and laughed.
They left the main building through a side door and headed towards a small one storey building off the property. Everyone baring their necks to their Head Alpha still bemused Castiel but he was coming to terms with it, his father had always told him that he adjusted to changes quickly.
"Yeah, he is. And you can put whatever you want on yours." Dean said once he stopped laughing. Levi grinned at Dean then put bacon and cheese on his bun. "Nothing else?" Dean asked, hovering the burger over Levi's plate. Levi nodded his head once and followed the burger with his eyes. Dean carefully lifted Levi over the plates and set him on the floor. "Go sit at the table then." Levi climbed onto his seat and bounced happily on his knees. "Cas, Sam, grub's up." Cas and Sam hopped up and joined Levi at the table. Dean carried their burgers to them, knowing that if he gave Levi his straight away it would be gone before Dean had even sat down.
"Let me try, it's getting dark, we need to move faster." Dean cautioned. He braced his hands on the corners around the nail, he took a deep breath before he pulled as hard as he could. His biceps tensed and shook as the nail slowly slid out of the wall. He let out a deep breath when the nail finally came loose, he released the wood panel. It swung down, hitting the floor, held up by the single nail still in it.
His father had designed and created all of the animatronics and the suits so Cas knew exactly how all of them worked and all of the specific design details each animatronic and suit had. With this, he knew that the bear in front of him was one of the special suits his father had made. There were only two of them, Golden Freddy and Golden Bonnie, and his father had told him that they were extra special but also dangerous because of the springlocks. Chuck had told him that the springlocks had to be operated by someone who'd been trained to use them and they had to be maintained carefully, otherwise they could be dangerous and badly hurt someone. His father hadn't gone into detail but it had scared Cas enough when his father had demonstrated with a single springlock, the quick click and snap of the small metal device was enough to deter him from messing with it. He also knew that the golden suits were the very first large animatronics that his father had made, he'd been around the golden suits for as long as he could remember.
"Did you find everything you were looking for today?" He asked politely as he glanced up at Dean quickly. He averted his eyes to the till when he saw Dean's stony glare.
"How was I supposed to find you, dummy? You practically disappeared off the face of the Earth." Lisa answered with an easy smile. Dean shook his head in disbelief.
"Oh I'm so sorry." She murmured, taking his hand again. Cas shook his head and slipped into a brief silence as he tried to come up with more information.
"Daddy, you been gone 2 Monday's." Levi objected. Dean frowned and looked beyond the phone, presumably to look at Sam.
"Phil told me off." Cas mumbled sadly. Dean chuckled at the boy and raised his hand to rest on Cas' head; he knew that the younger boy didn't like conflict and hated when he was scolded by anyone.
"But it will be yours and that's all I care about, I won't raise or treat it any differently than I do Levi." Dean replied, his tone soft and reassuring.
Cas pulled into a motel that was relatively close to the house. He carefully lifted Levi out of his car seat and into his arms. He carried Levi to the reception, where a middle aged woman was sat contently behind the desk.
"Deanie, bee!" She said jumping up, trying to reach it herself. Dean lifted her onto his hip and let her grab the plushy. Dean kissed her forehead and held her tightly.
"Thank you, Hannah." The omega servant gave him a small smile then started down the stairs. Castiel made his way quickly through the corridors to a side door of the castle, carefully avoiding any of his family. "Good afternoon, Isham." Castiel greeted politely. Isham simply opened the door and guided Castiel down the small cobblestone path down to the gate. "Thank you."
"How did you manage to get Levi to look so much like you and..." She asked, trailing off when she realised that she didn't know Dean's name.
"We need to discuss getting Cas back to normal." Dean said as he reached under the water to place his hand on Cas' knee. Sam rolled his eyes.
"Thanks a lot, Gabe." Dean grumbled. Gabriel laughed at the hunter. Dean's frown deepened then he stomped back into the house.
"Werewolf? Thanks, sweetheart." Dean asked, thanking Cas when she put the now full cup down in front of him and sat next to him. Sam smiled at them before shaking his head.
"Dean, I think I've found us a case." Sam shouted as he walked down to join them for breakfast. Cas was stood at the stove cooking bacon, eggs and sausages while she engaged in quiet conversation with Dean and Gabriel.
"I'm scared too, Bee. But how am I supposed to look out for you if you're ripping my head off whenever I suggest something other than your first instinct?" Dean murmured. Cas' heart clenched and fluttered at the old nickname, he tilted his head down into Dean's hands and raised his own smaller hands to cover them. Dean rubbed his thumb over Cas' cheek and briefly rested their forehead's against each other before he tugged him into a tight hug.
"Good because I know you love him Dean, I know you do and I'm completely fine with that. Dad is gone, he can't hurt you anymore and I know Mom loves you no matter, so do I but I love Cas too, don't hurt him." Sam said before turning back to his papers. Dean huffed then stood up and headed to the gym. Sam sighed then prayed to Gabriel.
"I'm sure I'll be seeing you again soon." Castiel said soothingly. He rose to his feet and shyly curled his hand around Dean's forearm. Dean walked through the room, smiling as the crowd of pups followed behind them slowly.
"It would take less than a day of observation for him to understand the dynamics we have here." Dean said, leaning back in his chair casually.
"And the love I feel for you." It was barely audible and Dean really had to strain to hear it but when it registered his heart clenched happily.
"You know, that thing it poisons you, forces you to do things." Dean said. Thomas looked at his feet then up at Hayden, who was avoiding eye contact with the man and looked guilty.
"He was just born, Dean, he needs to be somewhere safe. Bunker's the safest place there is." Sam tried. Dean ignored his brother and tied the sheet around Cas' body with the torn curtains. "I don't think he's evil, he's scared." Dean scoffed but didn't reply.
"Can we go to the waiting room?" Dean questioned when he saw Cas shifting uncomfortably. The nurse's face scrunched up and shook her head. "Or can our son and Cas' brother come in here?"
"I presume you know who we are." Gadreel stated. Cas nodded. "Do you know why you're here?" Cas shook her head.
Dean joked, Cas could see that his bright smile faltered slightly when he saw Levi's tear filled eyes.
"Something was dragged through here." Dean said, pointing to the drag marks in the mud and the folded down branches. "It wasn't big whatever it was."
"Yeah, I figured you'd need direct access to it." Gabriel answered opening the door to reveal the bunker beyond it. "At the moment this door is the front door and so is the only way to get into the bunker."
"You're definitely not going on hunts with an iPhone X, Cas. To break that would be blasphemy." Sam said. Cas opened his mouth to argue that it wouldn't be blasphemy but Sam raised an eyebrow so he just shut it again.
"Hello?" He asked upon opening the door to a man. The man seemed to be in his twenties, he had scruffy brown hair and brown eyes that held a profound sadness within them, he stood slightly shorter than Dean and was fiddling with his jacket nervously. "Can I help you?" Phil tried again when the man didn't speak.
Cas blinked his eyes open sleepily, he flopped his hand over to Dean's side of the bed but found no hunter. He sat up and hissed at the ache in his lower back, smiling at the memories. A loud laugh echoed up the stairs. Cas slid off the bed and pulled on a clean pair of panties and Dean's t-shirt before he started downstairs. He smiled to himself when his eyes fell on Dean's shirtless back and he could see the dark red scratches covering it.
"What kind of love?" Dean queried. Cas blushed and looked down at her hands, her long hair fell around her face.
It didn't take long for the clearing to fill with pack members. There was some pushing and shoving as some wolves tried to get close to the platform but Dean stopped it with a raised hand. Castiel was glad he was on the platform with Dean rather than on the floor with them because they were packed together tightly with barely enough room to move. Which surprised Castiel, the clearing was massive but thousands of pack members filled it, some even standing between the trees.
FredBear's was a simple rectangular building that held the main party room, the kitchen, Chuck's office and a staff room. There was a stage to the left of the door with wooden tables and benches sat in front of it, and there was the security puppet sat next to the back door.
"I can watch it later." Cas replied, curling his hand around the back of Dean's head. Dean chuckled and kissed his way down Cas' neck. "This is a lot more appealing to me right now."
"It Kismas, Papa." Levi said, his voice quiet but excited. Dean wrapped his arm around Cas, letting his hand rest on the angel's stomach, smiling up at Levi.
"I gotta go but my friend will be here soon." Not-Dean said on his return, running his hands through the angel's thick hair. "I had fun." He muttered. He tugged Cas into another swift kiss then retreated back into the dark. Cas waited until he heard a door close then turned his head and emptied his stomach. He had been aiming for the floor but he was still tied to the chair so most of it fell onto his shoulder and dripped down his arm and chest. He turned his head the other way and cried quietly. He felt like he had cheated on Dean, despite Dean not returning his feelings, and to Cas that was the worst thing you could do to someone. He loved Dean with everything he had, they had a child together, but he'd let another touch him. He just hoped that Dean would understand.
"Are you wearing boxers?" Cas asked lowly. Dean winked with a flirty grin, catching Cas' bottom lip between his lips teasingly while Cas continued to grope him. Dean slid his hands around Cas' body to grip his ass. "Dean." Cas said in warning.
"Hiya, fledge." Gabriel chuckled. Levi laughed joyfully as the archangel tickled him. Cas watched them fondly, his hands subconsciously came to rest on his stomach. Gabriel caught his brother's movement and looked back to Levi. "How about you go play in your little kitchen for a bit?" Levi nodded excitedly and slid off the bed to run downstairs to his kitchen play-set. "Cassie?" Gabriel said softly to get Cas' attention. Cas turned his eyes from the door where he had watched Levi leave to look at his older brother.
"Helping you escape the kingdom is akin to letting the serpent into Eden." Gadreel said. He pulled the maps towards him and started to show Castiel what the path of least resistance would be on the day of his escape. They spoke for hours until it got too dark to see without lighting the candles. "Come on, Castiel, I will walk you back to the gate."
"Hey Dean." Sam greeted, exiting the Bunker. He smiled upon seeing Dean and Levi hugging, leaning on the counter while waiting for their food to cook. "Hi Levi." He greeted gently.
"I won't let anything happen to you." Dean promised. Cas choked a laugh and nuzzled his face into Dean's chest.
"What do you mean you're not strong enough?! You're a half seraph, half archangel hybrid who could become a full blown archangel with the right power but you aren't strong enough to heal my brother? The father of your child?" Sam shouted angrily, fury in his eyes. Tears fell down Cas' cheeks as he looked at Dean desperately.
"Mick." Dean called out into the quiet of the library. Castiel looked around confused but Dean sat at one of the tables and relaxed back into his chair, his legs spread comfortably. "Come on, Cas, take a seat." Dean insisted softly. Castiel followed the subtle order and sat in the seat next to the Alpha.
"Oh Cassie, some of the locals have taken to you." Gabriel said in a cheery tone. Sam elbowed him in the ribs as Cas and Dean turned around. Dean's eyes narrowed slightly then he took her hand in his own with a soft smile. Cas returned the smile then joined Sam and Gabriel in their conversation of what they were going to do next.
"I was driving back here when I passed out at the wheel. When I regained consciousness, I was very disconcerted and I realised I was female so I walked here because the car was wreaked then it started to rain on the way here and I kept tripping on my pants so I removed them." Cas explained. Dean snorted a quiet laugh at the, almost childlike, solutions Cas had come to.
"Ok. Thanks Dad, it means a lot." Dean said once he was sure that John had finished. John nodded and pulled his eldest into a tight hug.
"So I looked into the events of Freddy's last night." Charlie started after the waiter had placed their food and drinks down in front of them and had left with a polite smile.
"Hey, baby, can I borrow your phone really quick?" Dean asked as he settled next to Cas on the couch. Cas handed the phone over, confusion written on his face. Dean played a random song on the phone then pressed the speaker against Cas' belly.
"I just, I just want to be close to you." Cas murmured, trying to keep the shake out of his voice. Dean frowned then he stepped closer to the angel, cupping his face in his hands.
"The deal was that you could touch me as much as you want, and you're barely touching me." Cas begged, tightening his legs too.
"Blue Ridge, Georgia." Gabriel answered. Dean bent over and rested his hands on his knees. Cas shuffled forward and rested her hand on his back in concern.
"What's up, doc?" Dean called out. Levi slowly opened the door and peeked his head in. He tilted his head at the sight of his parents.
"I need to go and find Papa. Don't you want Papa back?" Dean questioned softly. He was really anxious to get going, he didn't want to be apart from the angel much longer.
"So how will this one be different to Levi?" Dean asked. Levi frowned and turned to look up at his parents. Cas watched Dean's hand fondly then turned slightly to look up at Dean.
"Daddy being assbutt is why you throw you phone?" Cas nodded and looked out the window into the back garden.
"I'm going to find a job, hopefully somewhere I can watch you while I work." Cas explained; half to Levi, half to himself.
"Yeah, I excited." Levi said in explanation. Dean sighed, he couldn't fault the boy for being excited about Christmas.
"How long have you been there?" Dean asked, a light blush made his freckles more pronounced as he thought that his baby brother might have seen him with Cas.
"Yeah?" Dan replied for them. They all turned their eyes away from the camera that was facing the corridor outside the security guard's office and looked towards the boy.
Dean asked. Cas told him then quickly put his phone away to grab Levi, who was trying to crawl away. Levi struggled against Cas' hold and managed to get away.
"Change them back." Gabriel demanded angrily. No matter what powers Aether now held, he was once human and for a human to show such disrespect towards an archangel was blasphemous. Aether laughed.
"It's bedtime, bug." Cas said to the little boy who had his head laid down on Dean's shoulder too, his eyes beginning to droop. Levi whined and curled further into Dean.
"He's only going to find you some things." Dean reassured, holding the boy close. The toddler hummed and nodded into his neck. Sam watched Dean as he and Levi looked at the soft toys while Gabriel and Cas looked at clothes. A quiet cooing turned everyone's attention to the woman behind Dean.
"No, Levi." Dean stood and walked Levi over to the corner of the room. "Sit down, hands on your head, facing the wall. 2 minutes. Get up, I'll put you back and the time will start again." Dean stated. Levi cried but did as he was told.
"Dean, I wasn't expecting you back for a few days." A voice said from behind one of the bookshelves. Castiel didn't recognise the accent so he assumed the voice belonged to someone overseas. "Oh, I apologise, Alpha, I wasn't aware that we had company."
"Please don't go, daddy." Levi begged, hanging off Dean's jeans in a desperate attempt to keep his father in place. Dean frowned, they'd finally got the location out of the siren and the brothers had already packed the Impala while Gabriel sorted the creature out. Once again the elders of the family had agreed to watch Levi but, evidently, the toddler didn't want his dad to leave.
"Kismas?" Levi asked around a mouthful of spaghetti. Cas frowned at the boy while Dean chuckled quietly.
"Good. Sammy's fucked off on a hunt for a month so it's just us here. I think it will be good for us." Dean rambled as he went about making Cas' drink.
"He seemed angered by your leaving without a guard but he said he wished to discuss the preparations for the Day of the Spirits." Castiel nodded. They walked in silence through the corridors as they approached Chuck's study. "Omega Prince Castiel, your highness."
"Dean W- Smith." The man introduced confidently. Castiel noticed the stumble the man had when introducing himself but didn't question it. "So Cas, what are you reading?"
I know you don't think you do but you deserve to be happy and it's about damn time something good happened. He's Cas, male or female. We all know you've fallen for him, anyone with eyes can see that." Sam explained softly, Dean blushed and bowed his head.
"Cas, there is nothing normal about his parents being in different places." Sam objected. Cas looked down at the floor and rubbed his eyes.
"I know, baby, and if it is mine I'll be so fucking happy. But if it's not, don't worry about it. We can sort it out and then we can try again if you want to." Dean reached up and stroked his thumb over his angel's cheek. "No matter what happens, I'm going to be right here. I'm going to be by your side until you send me away, remember?" Cas gave Dean a soft smile and cupped Dean's cheeks gently.
"What's this about?" Phil asked, shifting slightly, using his body to shield his sleeping friends from view.
"Deanie, why is he wearing a dress?" She asked pointing to her. The three men looked at her confused.
"No-one ever believed us." Dean repeated louder. "We always told people that Golden Bonnie took Jimmy and Eli but no-one ever believed us."
He was surprised how easily he managed to get to the kingdom's gate, however, he didn't want to look a gift horse in the mouth so he wasted no time in unlocking the gate and sliding out quietly. After he re-locked it, he leant against the kingdom's walls and grinned.
"There have been some whispers about a few scams in town." Dean improvised. Sam nodded and looked at Hayden and Ryan. Dean was watching Thomas carefully looking for a way to help him. The hunters let Hayden and Ryan talk about some fake scams for a while until Dean turned to Thomas.
"Theoretically, the Colt, the First Blade and Death's scythe could also kill it. We have those three too." Sam added.
"I'll go, Sam." She said. The younger Winchester nodded and gave her a grateful smile. Cas stood and shuffled past the closely packed bodies to the Impala, not regarding her surroundings. Just as Cas was reaching into the passengers foot well to pull Sam's laptop out, large hands grabbed at her shoulders and pushed her against Baby. Cas let out a shocked squeak and thrashed against the hands. It was now that Cas realised that, with her grace weakened, she had the strength of a human woman and no way of fighting them off. The two men laughed obnoxiously and pulled at Cas' clothing as her eyes filled with tears. Terror burned through her body since she realised their intentions. Faceless men pulled her vest top strap and bra strap off her shoulder and hands pulled her pants undone, tugging them down a fraction. "Stop, no, no. Please." Cas whimpered helplessly. A hand pulled her shirt up over her left breast and pulled the cup down to roughly grope her, ignoring her pleas. "Please..." Cas sobbed, tears streaming down her face as she struggled against the hands. She squealed in fright when a incessant hand was shoved down the front of her panties. She sobbed violently as she threw punches with no force behind them. Suddenly. the hands were gone and replaced with pained grunts. Cas hesitantly looked up but tears were clouding her vision. She saw a large blurry figure beating her attackers.
"He's a Novak, Alpha." The smaller alpha replied cautiously. The Head Alpha growled at the challenge.
"When he gets back you better start treating him right, if not for yourself then for your little boy. They both deserve better than what you're giving them right now and you know that." Mary warned. Dean nodded.
"No, she, err, she kissed me." Dean said hesitantly. Cas pushed Dean's face back, raising an eyebrow at the other man.
"Mick brought some friends from overseas and some are amazing sculptors." Dean explained. He held his hand out for Castiel to take then he lead the Omega to the platform.
"Omega Prince, the Alpha King and Princes have requested your presence for the evening meal." A beta servant informed him after a polite knock. Castiel rolled his eyes at the formal summon. The servant, that Castiel knew was called Isham, lead him through the long corridors and down the grand staircase before opening the door to the family's private dining room. "Omega Prince Castiel." Isham announced as Castiel stepped over the threshold. Castiel quietly thanked Isham and headed straight for his father.
"Oh! What else did you get up to?" Cas asked. Levi's grin dropped slightly and he slouched a little. "Levi?"
"It's dark, Omega Prince, you are far from Novak." The Head Alpha reasoned. Castiel tilted his head in confusion and looked towards his satchel that lay on the floor a few feet away from them. "Do you not know where you are?"
"The forest is dangerous." Dean said. Castiel rolled his eyes and moved his face away from Dean, straightening his head.
"There's no spines, no ribs, no collarbones, no heads." Cas elaborated. They looked down at the bones confused. "If these are the kids that my dad was talking about they shouldn't be just bones at the moment, they should still have skin, muscles. But they coincide with what my dad told me."
"Cas? Would you like dresses or pants?" Dean asked softly, not really wanting to interrupt Cas' singing but not knowing what to pick for her. Cas looked around the section then pointed to a dress. Dean picked it up and smiled; the dress had a light aqua blue torso with pink and orange ombré flower and purple flower details and the green stems connected them and the skirt was a peach soft tutu. "You'll look beautiful in it, Cas." He said softly, Cas squealed happily and hid her blushing face in Dean's neck, her curls bouncing in her bunches. Cas pointed to a white shirt with a bee on it next and some tiny blue jeans. Dean figured they wouldn't need much so moved onto shoes. He found a teeny pair of light pink sneakers that could match both outfits. "Want anything else, angel?" Dean asked as he tried the juggle both the toddler and the clothes. Cas wiggled in Dean's arms, trying to get down.
"Your scent, instinct." Castiel shook his head desperately. "Hey, it's ok. In Winchester, we don't force our omegas to mate anyone, even if Fenrir paired them himself. I will teach you, don't worry. But I need to tell my father first." As soon as Dean had finished, an alpha with salt and pepper hair walked into the room, a stormy look on his face.
"Exactly, so I'm not going to cheat on you. I know I don't have a great track record with relationships but you're different and I'm not going to ruin it just because we're under this stupid spell." Dean said reassuringly. He pressed a kiss to Cas' forehead and continued on their path to the checkout.
"I think I saw a tracking spell in the Bunker, admittedly it's to track down angels but I think it could work for a nephilim. But I'd have to look at some of the lore behind nephilims to make sure." Sam voiced after a moment of thought. Dean nodded and glanced up the stairs again.
"No, of course I didn't, I pushed her away when she started pushing up against me." Dean replied, offended that Cas would think he'd kiss her back.
"It seemed like they were going after him, trying to get him." Cas argued. Phil frowned and turned to look at Dean over the couch. Dean shrugged and nodded.
"Food, Daddy?" Levi asked, pushing himself up on the back of the chair to look at his dad. Dean chuckled and shook his head.
"I not good for Papa." Levi said. "But I sorry, Daddy! I go Papa now! Please." Levi begged through his tears. Dean shook his head.
He'd been planning this for months, even if he hadn't put anything into motion, and he was getting more nervous as the night drew closer. But he needed to calm himself so that his family wouldn't notice that something was wrong. Luckily, the number of people who attended the Remembrance Ball's did make him nervous and his family knew that, so any nerves his family noticed he could blame on the ball.
"We should get going then." Cas smiled. They drove to the cafe in their own cars, pulling in on either side of Phil's car.
"You done?" Dean asked softly. Cas looked down at the pile of fabric in her arms and nodded absently, Dean smiled and placed a hand on the small of her back to lead her to the checkout. The spotty teenager behind the counter threw Cas a flirty smile.
"Ok, ok, yeah I can do it." Cas nodded. Cas closed his eyes and whimpered as he focused on his grace, on the source of the pain. Sam, Dean and Gabriel watched as Cas stopped squirming and his hands relaxed.
"I've been around my dad's designs and animatronics all my life, I know if it's his work or not." Cas argued. Dean nodded in agreement and then frowned.
"Beats me. All signs point to witch though. One of the cops found a hex bag at oxygen guy's crime scene and I'm willing to bet there's one at the other 3 too." Sam continued.
"Then who did?" Dean asked. "Guys stay here, Phil and I need to check something." Dean called back. The younger members of the group nodded, their eyes surveying the dark showroom. Dean and Phil moved into the arcade and quickly found the window they had originally entered through. Dean pushed against it as hard as he could, Phil quickly joined him to see if they could get it to move but it just creaked.
"There's a gate there, Dean." Cas said pointing to the gate on the far side of the play area. Everyone turned to look for the gate then turned to Dean and Phil with smug smiles. Dean rubbed the back of his neck in embarrassment as he looked at, but he noticed the chain tying it to the fence.
"Who's that?" Dean asked gesturing towards the boy that Levi was skillfully avoiding. Lisa grinned and crossed her arms across her stomach.
"It's been a long day." Dean murmured. Cas sighed contently and laid his head on Dean's shoulder, laying his forehead on the other's neck.
"Yeah, he's going to encourage Levi to detach his soul from Cas' grace so he can start to form his body because if Levi stays attached any longer than today then it could get dangerous for Cas." Gabriel explained. Sam nodded and looked up at Dean. The older Winchester had an odd look on his face as he looked at Cas, Sam could tell what he was going to do. A few tears leaked through Cas' closed eyes as his body began to shake. "He close to detachment." Cas' eyes snapped open and began to shine bright blue as his grace powered up. The Winchester's watched in awe as a swirl of blue and green light materialised in Gabriel's arms. "You did it, brother." Gabriel whispered proudly. Cas' eyes focused on the light and he smiled fondly. Gabriel gingerly passed it over to Cas.
"I mean books, Dean, not comics." Cas said with a small smile. Dean scowled at her but it quickly turned into a smile. He pressed a kiss to her forehead then turned to the kitchen.
"Ok then. You need to drop the attitude, your Papa only asked you to put your coat on. You get one warning when we go out, if you misbehave after the warning then I am bringing you straight back home, you understand me?" Dean asked. Levi nodded. "I said do you understand me?"
"Cas, that's great. Levi keeps asking me if he can have a little brother and I know you wanted another baby. So did I." Dean rambled happily but his smile dropped when Cas sat up and revealed his wet face.
"After being in such close proximity with Aether's true form I can sense his power and where he is so when they get up, I'll take us to him. You three will have to try and distract him while I conjure the power of nature." Gabriel explained.
"This book contains every rule that every Kingdom abides by." Dean explained. Castiel leant forward, his eyes lingering on his own Kingdom's name before sliding down to Winchester. "And they are all archaic and stuffy sounding but it's our way and I like it." Castiel nodded in understanding. Dean nodded his head once then flicked through the book until he found the rules of Winchester. "Ok, 'everyone must refer to the Head Alpha as 'Alpha' when in the presence of company or outsiders, it is up to the Alpha to restrict the title further.' For me, I only expect the title if in the presence of outsiders or members of the pack that aren't close to me, I'll point out who my family pack are so you know." Dean started. Castiel nodded. "If we were to mate, this rule would apply to you as you would be Head Omega."
Televisions were rare and only royals could afford them, but even for a King to have more than one in their house was uncommon.
"What do you think you can do to me?" Aether hissed. Gabriel grinned wickedly. "Nature's my bitch, you think she'll harm me?!" Aether's voice raised, an action that could easily be mistaken for anger but Gabriel could see the other was stalling out of desperation and fear of the unknown. Gabriel tossed the witch down the crack then proceeded to conjure water, to deepen the river that Aether himself had placed down there, then fire, to fill the space between, then air, to make the river rage and the fire inescapable, then earth, to close the crack the witch had created. Nothing but the muted screams of the other filled the room but eventually that stopped too and was replaced by soft whimpering.
"Ok, do you mind getting started on that? I need to check on Cas." Dean stepped towards the stairs as Sam nodded.
"I'm Castiel, your brother's nurse." Castiel returned. He stepped around Sam and approached Dean. "Hello Dean, I'm just going to check your vitals and check your responses, tomorrow I'm going to start moving your limbs to make sure that you don't get bed sores or stiff joints."
"Anyway, 5 men missing over the last month, all last seen at some strip club leaving with 3 women and 2 men. Each one went home after leaving with the stripper and killed their significant other, in a variety of colourful ways." Sam explained. Dean leant forward on his folded hands.
"Yeah." Cas moaned, letting Dean pull his head back a bit. Dean groaned then brought Cas into a passionate kiss as he re-positioned himself at Cas' hole. "Please, Dean, I want you, I want it hard, I want to feel it tomorrow." Dean straightened up as he pushed into Cas' open hole again, gripping tightly onto Cas' waist. Dean could feel Cas quivering beneath him and bit his lip at the sight.
"Papa!" Levi exclaimed, throwing himself into his father's arms happily. Cas grinned and pulled his son into his arms then he stepped further into the kitchen.
There was a war, centuries ago- which was nothing compared to the lifespan of wolves- across the country. The wolves had lived for millennia in harmony with each other, their packs co-existing but something changed; the packs divided into their kingdoms and it was every wolf for himself. The royals had armies and strategies while the savages used brute force and surprise attacks. Eventually, a peace treaty was signed by each kingdom's head alpha and allies were formed in case of another war. The historic event was, unimaginatively, called the War of Kingdoms.
"Alpha..." Castiel said quietly, just loud enough to get Dean's attention. "Would you mind putting some pants on?" He asked nervously when Dean hummed.
"He took aspects of nature in order to control it. No-one likes to be controlled, Sam, so when the victim has the opportunity to overpower the controller then they will do so. Nature, being the most powerful thing on Earth, despises being controlled by a lesser creature and will do anything to go against Aether when given the chance and will be kind to those who use her against Aether. The only problem is that, to be able to use nature against Aether, one must use magic however she will allow it if it means she can break free from Aether's grasp." Gabriel elaborated. "Hence why only nature can harm him." Cas tilted her head to the side as she looked over to the waitress then crawled around the booth and climbed onto Dean's lap.
"Da'yl!" She shouted happily. Dean's face soften to an affectionate smile while Gabriel's face turned to one of such anger that it could challenge God's wrath.
"Dean, since my grace has weakened a few... feelings have become more pronounced." Cas said after a moment of thought.
"You look so good, I love your new style." Dean uttered into Cas' ear. "This and the panties I know you're wearing under those pants. Love seeing you in my shirts too." Cas cupped Dean's neck, a blush making it's way up his own neck to his cheeks.
"Cassie, can you take Levi to his room?" Gabriel asked calmly. Cas stuttered his breaths but he couldn't calm down.
"Let's go get you dressed then." Cas stood up and pulled the small boy into his arms. "What do you want to wear today?" He asked as he entered Levi's bedroom.
"Daddy, Papa?! We have Kismas? Peas?" Levi asked, bouncing in his seat. Cas looked at Dean, who was already smiling back at him.
"Yes, alpha, I'm ok. Thank you." Castiel said, surprised at himself. He tilted his head slightly as the smell of dust after rain, leather and smoke washed over him.
pray that the police believe us when we take him in." Phil groaned. Dean turned back to Phil and knocked his fist against' Phil's shoulder.
"We'll sort it out, don't worry." Sam said sympathetically. Sam looked at his brother and his best friend and frowned. Cas was smiling at the corpse. The angel snapped out of it when Dean slapped him on the back good-naturedly.
"You're an angel, babe, it wouldn't affect you if you did get burnt." Dean countered. Cas huffed out another deep sigh and slid the newly finished pancake onto a clean plate then he carefully turned in Dean's arms, laying his hands on Dean's chest.
"So have you worked out what it is?" Dean asked, ignoring his brother. Sam nodded, tapping on his laptop and pulling up the coroner's photo's. "Hearts missing, standard werewolf?"
"Cas is having a baby." Sam replied without taking his eyes off of Cas. Pain ripped through Cas' stomach and he desperately grasped Sam's hand.
"Daddy make b'eckfas' then get me dress." Levi said. "But then he shout at Granny again and I run away." Cas nodded and sat up.
"How'd you get Cas?" John asked. Dean had forgotten that his dad and Bobby were even holding him back.
"Maybe we should ask your dad about it?" Charlie was asking when Phil returned to the living room. Cas shrugged and gazed out of the window.
"What ott?" He asked. Dean turned his smile to the toddler. With the otter toy in hand, Dean carried Levi down the aisle to join his brother and the angels. Cas glanced at the hunter sadly and looked down at his feet. "Papa?" Said Levi's quiet voice. Cas turned to his son and put a fake smile on his face.
"We don't have swim suits, Gabe." Dean stated when they were back in the safety in their house. Gabriel looked at him incredulously.
"That's the asshole who took our brothers." Cas hissed. Dan curled his arm around Cas' shoulders to comfort him but he could feel the heat in his hands and he could feel the anger in his chest. They watched intrigued as the now Golden Bonnie made his way through the showroom again and pushed through the staff corridor doors.
"It's not a proposal." Dean said hurriedly so that Cas wouldn't get the wrong idea. "Not yet. It's a promise ring, I promise that I am yours, I promise that you and Levi are my priority, I promise I feel the same as you do." Dean's voice was soft, to keep the moment between them. Cas pulled the ring out of the box and slid it onto his left ring finger.
"You'll let us know where you've gone, right?" Sam asked. Gabriel nodded next to the younger Winchester. Cas nodded and got into the car.
"I think Sam wants to go tomorrow or the day after but I don't know for sure." Dean replied in the same tone. "You and Levi can commandeer my bed again if you want." Cas flushed, turning his head to hid his face in Dean's neck. "Hey, don't hide, I don't mind." Dean reassured him softly.
Castiel followed behind the Head Alpha with his head lowered, he was aware of the other two alphas flanking him but he kept his eyes on the Head Alpha's back paws. The alphas were talking to one another but Castiel wasn't listening; he hadn't heard any howling from the direction of the Kingdom of Novak so he assumed that he had managed to get away with his plan.
"Are you happy, Cassie?" Gabriel asked once Cas was seated. Cas remained silent for a moment as he just watched the TV.
"He visited me in Heaven a few times." John said. Dean smiled at Cas' thoughtfulness. Levi whined quietly and tugged at Dean's hand.
"It's ok to be scared of the dark. So long as you know that I won't let anything happen to you." Dean reassured. He held Levi tight against his body and started to rock back and forth gently.
"Levi thinks we need it too." Dean retorted. Levi nodded unknowingly and reached for what Dean was asking for. Dean smiled at Cas, leaning towards the shelves. He rested his hand on the small of Cas' back and let Levi grab the box. Cas shook his head fondly and let the boys put the box in the shopping cart. Dean pressed a quick kiss to Cas' temple then dropped his hand from Cas' back before leading the way down the rest of the aisle.
"I swear I'm ok, Bee," Dean reiterated lowly. "This should be bringing everyone together but no-one is trusting the others. This whole sitation is insane, anything is possible." Cas nodded in agreement. He turned in Dean's arms, wrapping his own arms around Dean's neck, and relaxed into Dean's hug, letting his legs hang over his friend's. Dean laid his head back against the chair while Cas nuzzled his face into his neck, he closed his eyes and listened to the sounds in the house; the sounds of Charlie and Mark talking behind them and the whispers of Dan and Phil upstairs. Dean sighed contently; despite the whole crazy situation, he was happy, his little family was back together again. He tangled his free hand into Cas' wild black hair and gently scratched at his scalp.
"I only came out when I heard the engine start, so I didn't see you inappropriately grope our best friend." Sam teased. Dean rolled his eyes at the other man but he could feel his heart rate slowing. "So when are you going to tell him?" Sam was reminding Dean of an excitable child, he could practically see the man bouncing with energy.
"Dean, please." Cas whispered desperately. Dean leant back slightly to look into the angel's blue eyes, his eyes were crossed since they were so close but Dean only found it cute.
"We were just looking at the storm." Phil answered reassuringly. Cas looked between them suspiciously but didn't question them further, he knew that he could just ask Dean when they were alone.
"Hey sweetheart, wake up." Dean whispered. Cas moaned softly and rolled towards the hunter. "Come on, baby, we're going soon." Cas groaned and slowly opened his eyes. A small smile appeared on his face when he focused on the green eyed man in front of him.
"I told you." Cas snarled. "I'm not a child, Dean, I know the difference between logical movement and animatronics roaming the fucking building." Dean sent a hard glare at Cas and ran his hand over his face before turning and storming out of the house, slamming the door behind him. They heard Dean's car door open and close but then there was silence.
"Come on, I'll put you between me and Dean." Sam said. He guided Jack down the halls until he reached the corridor that held their room. Both of them froze then they heard a soft, broken scream. Sam signaled for Jack to stay put and tip-toed towards Dean's room. When he quietly opened the door, the wails grew louder. Dean was laying face down on his bed, his face buried in his pillow, and Sam could see his shoulders shaking violently as his older brother sobbed. Sam's heart broke at the hurt wails and cries coming from Dean. He'd never seen Dean break like that, not after any of their deaths. It was normally anger and vengeance not uncontrollable tears and sadness, not like this. He blinked back the tears forming in his own eyes and backed away slowly, leaving Dean to let it out in peace. Without another word, Sam opened the door that Jack was stood in front of then retreated to his own room.
"Listen, Ben, I'm not your dad." Dean said, not seeing a way around the conversation. Ben frowned and looked back to Cas.
"Yeah, I want to be on that side of the fence in the dark." Dan commented sarcastically. He climbed over the fence next, Mark and Phil helping him to stabilise himself. Cas sighed and looked around the dark car park, it felt still and lifeless despite there being 6 people there. He frowned as a shiver ran down his spine then quickly followed his friends. They followed Dean through the fire exit but again Cas stopped, though this time not because he was skeptical of their way of entry but because something had caught his eye. While it had been nearly a decade since he'd been here, he still remembered every aspect of the pizzeria and the small pathway in the bushes wasn't one of the things he remembered seeing. He eyed it curiously and moved to walk towards it.
"He wouldn't listen when I told him I couldn't pick him up." Cas explained. He heard Dean sigh and could almost see the hunter rubbing his hand over his face.
"Thanks, dad." Dean tugged the new jacket on then carefully held Levi's last present in front of him. "From Daddy and Papa." He murmured.
"I should go and get ready." Cas said to Dean after a couple of movies. The hunter pressed a kiss to Cas' temple and moved his arm so the angel could get up. He let his hand glide down Cas' body as the angel stood and tipped his chin up towards his brother when he met the other man's gaze.
Strong hands gripped his waist suddenly but they instantly felt wrong. They dragged him into a narrow alley between two shops and shoved him down to the floor behind the dumpster. Cas watched helplessly as the coffee that had been in his hand fall to the floor and spill everywhere.
"Wanna watch more of your favourite psychopath?" He asked. Cas thought about it for a second then nodded with a sigh. Dean grinned and pulled up the next episode of American Horror Story, Cas pulled her curls over one shoulder then leant into Dean's side. Sam watched the scene in surprise but said nothing. Dean subconsciously ran his hand up and down her side as they watched. Cas smiled to herself and leant into him further. Eventually Sam and Gabriel joined them until Dean's stomach growled loudly. "Let's go get food." Dean announced standing up. Cas fell on her side and glared up at him. They piled into the Impala and Dean pulled out to find the nearest diner.
"Nothing! We're playing hide and seek but Jimmy is real good at hiding." Cas said as nonchalantly as a 6 year old could. Chuck raised his eyebrow incredulously but nodded his ok. He bent down and pressed a kiss to Cas' head before gently leading Cas out of the office. Cas grinned back at his father as the elder shut the door then turned to his table where he had put his brother down. But Elijah wasn't there. He'd gone. In a panic, Cas ran around the pizzeria frantically looking for Elijah, he didn't want to draw attention to himself by shouting out but he soon resorted to looking for his friends, hoping one of them had seen Elijah. He found his friends in Pirate's Cove, quietly talking next to Foxy's stage. "Guys!" Cas exclaimed running up to them.
"When Dad was creating Cassie here, he let me help him out, finally. I'd been bugging him for millennia before to let me help create an angel, a sibling but he'd always said no. But with Cas, he finally caved. Technically, Cas should have been amongst the lowest ranks, as the generations of angels determine the rank they're in. Cas is an archangel-seraph hybrid, archseraph if you will. With the correct power he could become a fully fledged archangel." Gabriel explained fondly, a proud smile appearing on his face. "Because I helped our father create him, Cassie has a special place in my heart. He is my favourite. So I'm here to help."
"Look at Pirate's Cove." Phil said through clenched teeth. Dean followed Phil's torch beam and froze. There in the doorway of Pirate's Cove, stood Foxy; his jaw unhinged, his eyes focused on them, his paw curled around the doorframe, like he was ready to run at them.
"Then what is it?" Cas asked defensively. They stopped and turned to look at the gap they just walked through.
"Hey!" A voice yelled from the bar. Cas' head snapped up and saw Dean running towards them. "Get off her!" Cas stuck her hands out towards Dean to slow him down but didn't move from Daryl's protective grasp.
"Hi Zeppelin, it's daddy." He murmured happily. The baby kicked again then Dean leant back. "Do you think dad will mind that I used Bobby as Zepp's namesake?"
"I get that but why does she just jump to the conclusion that he did it, he's obviously trying to get better and she's recognised that. Part of learning to trust someone is not jumping to such conclusions, innocent until proven guilty and all." Dean reasoned. "He clearly loves his son too." Cas smiled and leant back into Dean's side. Dean raised his hand and cupped Cas' cheek to pull her into a soft kiss. Cas hummed contently and pushed into the kiss. Cas gasped as Dean gripped onto her waist, Dean took advantage of her slack mouth and he slipped his tongue passed her lips. Cas whined and tangled her hand in his hair to hold him in place. Dean smiled against her mouth and dragged his hand down her side to tighten his hand on her thigh. Cas bit her lip with a smirk when Dean pulled away for a breath, Dean ran his fingers through her hair and smiled at her lovingly. "Let's keep watching." He whispered, Cas' smile dropped slightly but she managed to keep it in place until she was tucked back into his side. She couldn't understand why Dean didn't want to keep going, he was known for sleeping with women so why was she any different, perhaps because she was actually a man but she still didn't understand why. Maybe Sam would know.
"Do you want to come with Papa and Uncle Gabe or do you want to stay with granny and grandpa?" Cas asked Levi as he got himself dressed. He tucked the front of Dean's shirt into his black skinny jeans then turned to the boy.
"You ready to see Papa?" Dean asked as he heard the water shut off. Levi held onto Dean's leg tightly and nodded nervously. "Hey, listen to me, it is Papa, I promise." Levi nodded. The little boy tensed slightly as he heard footsteps coming down the stairs. Levi hid his face in Dean’s leg and curled his little arms around his thigh. “Hey Cas, are you ok?” Dean asked when Cas reached them. Cas smiled up at Dean shyly and nodded. Levi hesitantly peeked out from behind Dean before a wide smile spread across his face showing his little teeth.
"My phone." He whined when Dean just looked at him. The hunter made a noise in acknowledgement and pulled Cas' phone out. The nurse collected their blood and hurried out of the room. "I'm going to tell Gabriel to take Levi to get some food." The angel muttered. Dean collapsed into one of the chairs and sighed; he really hoped this baby was his.
"My mom said that Mark and Charlie were coming after lunch and that Dan, Phil and James were coming soon." Dean answered. Cas nodded seriously and looked at their brother's.
"But it won't work." Cas insisted once the other had finished. Not-Dean raised an eyebrow incredulously.
