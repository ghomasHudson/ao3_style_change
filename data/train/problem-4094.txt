“As green as you are,” Dean continued, “At the end of the day, those instincts count for something. Where I’m from, it means that people live longer lives because of you, because you made that choice. I think that when push comes to shove, you’ll make the right call. You’ve been faced with a monster before, and, knowing nothing, you jumped right in. Man, once I get you all learned up, you’ll be one scary motherfucker.”
He thought that, probably, Castiel and Ash would spend one night in a cold field waiting for a goat-eating dog before politely asking to be dropped off at the next available point. That probably it was all for the best, because if he were being honest, here, in the dark, he wouldn’t want anyone to live this life.
“Fine,” Gabriel replied, “You’re no fun. We’re all downstairs, come for cocoa when you’re done being grumpy.”
“That’s your car, right?” He shouted over his shoulder as they approached the trees, and the sleek black car parked just in front of them.
“I’m your pretty boy, Cas,” He says, placing both hands on the back of Cas’s neck, wrapping his legs tighter around his waist, “I’m your favourite fuck toy, aren’t I?”
Dean’s hands tightened, fingers digging into Cas’s skin as he picked up his pace, fucking recklessly into Cas’s hand.
It didn’t take much more than that, a few more teasing words before Dean was spilling, his come smearing on Cas’s hand and the skin of his stomach. Cas watched him, his gaze gentle as Dean’s brain came back online.
During the car ride home (and the considerable time spent sitting in traffic), Dean messaged Sam, trying to catch him up on the situation without telling him much more than the bare essentials.
“It better not,” his Boss said, finally letting go of his chin, “Let’s get this contract signed, we’ll deal with your bad behaviour tomorrow.”
The feeling of it was dizzying, knowing that he did that, that his body brought Daddy that pleasure. There was a fire low down in his gut, and it burned right through him. He whimpered again, hips jerking frantically against the sofa as Daddy caught his breath.
His food arrived quickly, and it was warm, and Dean was so grateful that he left his last seventy cents on the table for the cashier and his heavenly fry cook.
“Aw,” Cas says, taking Dean’s face in his hands, “I’m gonna take good care of you, baby. Come upstairs. And bring your new toys.”
“I don’t know man, luck is relative,” came Ash’s voice again, “It’s nice to be outta Wilson. Dead end town if ever I saw one.”
“Don’t have any worldly possessions. But I packed all my clean underwear and my entire stash, so I’m set to go.”
Dean did as he was bid, warm palm pressing against the smooth hot flesh of his cock, fingers circling his shaft as he started jacking himself, slow as ever. The slide was dry but Dean was sure that wouldn’t be a problem for long, pre-come already beading at the tip, just waiting to be smeared all over.
“As long as you’ll have me,” Cas replied, effectively ripping his heart out and nailing it to his sleeve.
“Hello,” Castiel replied, pressing kisses to the nape of Dean’s neck. It was nice, and surprisingly gentle. “I’ve been thinking about you all evening.”
They were quiet for a few moments. Castiel stayed turned around, watching the red of the sun bleed into the sky above the empty house they’d left behind. Ash scratched at his stomach.
“Listen kid, if you think you get to see where the Boss lives and come out of it alive, that’s your business. He’ll be real sorry to see your fruity ass go, I bet.”
“Uh, yes,” Dean said, entering a bit of a blind panic, “Don’t move, don’t talk, don’t suck your dick. Aye aye, Captain.”
Dean focused on keeping a quiet as he could, holding still and doing the job he’d been given. Eventually he felt the tension leave his shoulders, blind-panic clearing as he tuned out the muffled drone of the meeting going on above him.
“Maybe field work isn’t for you,” Dean said, his tone understanding as he strolled back towards the parking lot, a night-time tour guide of horror and death.
“Oh yeah,” She said, hurrying down the steps to receive him, “Real big dog problem. Ate half my goats.”
He heard a slick noise behind him, but his face was still pressed against the table. There was a grunt, and then a warm splash across his jaw.
Dean had his t-shirt off in seconds, tossing it somewhere on the floor before taking himself in hand again. It was less than a minute before Dean was back on the cusp, his thighs straining as he tried to shove into the tight circle of his fist, so close to the edge, almost out of his mind.
“I don’t give a shit, kid. This is a courtesy call to let you know your ass is fired. Don’t come back here again,” Jerry replied, before promptly hanging up.
“Fuck,” Daddy said above him, grinding down against Dean. It felt amazing. Dean was so hard it ached, his own cock leaking onto the lace of the thong.
The kiss was messy, and so hot that if Dean hadn’t just come, he’d have been hard in an instant. They spent a while on the sofa, making out and just touching each other, until Daddy’s cell phone dinged, the noise ringing out in the quiet of the office from where it sat on Daddy’s desk.
Daddy must have tucked them into his panties just before he left. That was a four hundred per cent tip.
His boss merely kept watching him. Something about being so exposed, naked and masturbating in front of a fully dressed man, really had Dean going. Being watched, especially by Daddy... He liked it.
Dean frowned at her as he remembered the quiet man from last night and his efficient kitchen staff of one.
“So,” Hannah said, once they were back in the car with Thick-neck a few hours later, “We’re going to get you some nice suits made, so that if you need to accompany the Boss anywhere, you can do so while dressed appropriately. I’ve already sent your measurements and sizes off to our shopper, so they can purchase all the clothes that the Boss requested for you in the right sizes.”
He closed his eyes, rubbing at the damp spot a little before bringing his finger back up to his mouth to suck on, like his own pre-come was the best tasting thing in the world. He let out a little moan, noises he hoped Daddy liked, letting his head tip back as though lost in ecstasy. He felt eyes on him as he moved, but he took his time, wanting to drag this moment out.
Dean nods, and lets Cas push him down on the bed, on his back. Cas lays down on top of him, a mirror of this morning, and trails soft kisses along his collarbone and up Dean’s neck.
“No,” Dean said, feigning seriousness, “A creature who has eaten a bacon cheeseburger before. I mean, come on. It doesn’t get much better.”
He had a quick shower, just to get the semen off of him. It didn’t seem sexy anymore and he mostly just felt dirty, slutty and disgusting for wanting this so bad. It was just a job, he reminded himself, this was what he did now, and if his boss wanted to come on him, then he would. What Dean wanted didn’t really factor in. He scrubbed himself angrily, and got dressed again in his pajamas from the previous evening. Time to wear his shitty old clothes back to his shitty old apartment.
“Ash you didn’t see him, there was something wrong.” Castiel said bluntly from where he was curled against the door, head in one hand.
He woke up warm and content, his body curved around Dean’s. They’d cleaned off and climbed under the covers almost straight away, both road-weary and then physically tired out.
“That will be Hannah,” Castiel said, his voice all business again, jarring Dean from the soft, sensual moment they’d just shared.
“Aw, are you cross with me baby?” Cas asks, wrapping his arms around Dean’s waist and resting his chin on Dean’s shoulder.
“Not addressing me properly is a sign of disrespect, Dean,” his Boss said, pinching the flesh of his inner thigh until he squirmed, “Do you really think it’s a good idea to disrespect me?”
“Fuck off,” Dean said, “I’m not doin’ that. You can smash my kneecaps in if you want, but I’m not gonna go around hurting people just because you decided I owe you money.”
He lost count pretty quickly as his Daddy laid a few particularly hard blows to his upper thighs, nailing him right across the balls. The pain was sharp and he couldn’t think properly. It stung so bad, and he felt winded, but Daddy didn’t stop. His ass was burning, like the skin was pulled too tight across his muscles, like the heat in his face as he blushed. Every now and again, Daddy would stop and use a soothing hand to massage his hot skin, a tender and gentle touch sandwiched between periods of what felt like unending pain.
He presses his torso along Dean’s back, grinding into him as he reaches down into Dean’s new panties. He pulls Dean’s cock out, stroking it in time with his movements, slow and methodical. Dean’s moaning, panting hotly into the sheets as he takes everything Cas gives him. Cas tucks the lace waistband behind Dean’s balls, and and starts moving faster, twisting his wrist on the upstroke, his thighs smacking into Dean’s.
“Never mind that, buddy. Why did you, huh? How did you land there? Maybe you’re already running from the police.”
“I would like you to join my staff as my courtesan, in exchange for paying off your debt,” the man explained.
Next he picked some silk athletic shorts in a peachy colour with white trim, to match his scent. They fit like a glove too, hugging his ass and showing a hint of cheek. It was warm in the apartment, but he didn’t want to walk around totally exposed, so he pulled on a robe over the top, light grey and stupidly soft. Typically enough, it only just covered his ass. Dean rolled his eyes, stepping out into the foyer.
“You have a lovely smile,” he said, entirely by accident. He’d been watching Dean flirt with the desk clerk, trying to get them a nicer room. He’d turned to wink at Cas and Cas was suddenly breathless.
“And how much would that be? How am I supposed to pay my rent?” he asked incredulously, “I need to help my brother get groceries!”
“If it was a weird baby thing, you’d still do what I asked of you and thank me for the honor. But I assure you, it’s purely perfunctory,” Daddy leaned in, his lips brushing Dean’s ear as he whispered, “Trust me, you’ll be grateful for it later when you’re not combing dried come out of your pubic hair.”
It took them awhile to get to Santa Fe. Ash found the stack of roadmaps kept under the passenger side seat, and asked to detour through all the towns with the best names.
“We should go to Mount Rushmore. It’s near here, it’s tourist season, and if we’re lucky, they won’t have put our faces on the news yet.” Ash said from where he lay, his voice rolling in from the backseat, dusty and deep.
Dean was panting open-mouthed into the crook of his elbow, eyes screwed shut in concentration as he moved, pre-come smearing over the couch as it dripped through the lace, the fabric rubbing against his slit, clinging tight to the sensitive skin at the tip, and pulling tight across his balls. It felt incredible. Daddy must have been getting similar stimulation from the strap of the thong between his cheeks, because he kept slowly dragging his cock along it, and pausing to rub his cockhead against the piece of lace at the back, making it damp and itchy against Dean’s skin. Dean felt like he was on fire, like his skin was too tight for his body, like he was about to explode.
Dean took a deep breath, as quietly as possible. He slid his thumbs under the waistband, and pushed his underwear all the way down. It was a little chilly in the room, but his cock didn’t seem to notice, slowly getting harder as he stood there under Daddy’s sharp gaze.
Dean nods, turning back towards the pile. He sifts through the different pairs, but he chooses a pair made of sheer fabric, baby pink. The ones with the lace and a heart-shaped cut out.
Castiel was running so fast he didn’t hear, nearly crashed into the car’s massive rear end. His fingers shook as he reached the passenger side door, grasping for the handle in the dark. He heard the fumble of keys, and then the door was unlocked. He slid into the car in unison with the stranger he had just helped commit a murder. The car roared to life and was put in gear.
The diner seemed entirely different in the day time. It had waitresses who smiled at him, on their way to tend to the families and couples and old people who filled the booths. It had the noise of a diner, completely different to the dead of night, the high schooler behind the till faking a smile as she asked him what he would like to order today, sir.
John merely shrugged. He tugged on the duffel bag’s zipper and, to Dean, the sound felt deafening in the quiet of their shitty apartment.
He heard the muffled sound of footsteps on soft carpet, and then curtains being pulled behind him, and then finally, finally, felt a warm hand against his shoulder that he instantly knew belonged to his boss.
Castiel had seen more Cactuses in the last half hour than he ever had in his life. He was drowsy as they turned off the highway, and hoped that wherever they went had fewer cacti. Dean began to case the outskirts of town, hoping to spot the cheapest looking motel possible. He explained carefully that it was more to do with the honour system that every good shady establishment seemed to stand by, than the cheapness of the place. If a manager had something to hide, they would usually go ahead and add you to the list, he said.
They came to Daddy’s office, and Dean was pushed down onto a leather chaise lounge, tucked into a corner of the room where Daddy could still see him.
He drifts awake, becoming more aware of the fact that Cas is plastered along his back, hands wrapped around Dean’s wrists. He’s placing soft sweet kisses on Dean’s neck.
“Please, take a seat, Dean,” his Boss said, gesturing to a chair on the other side of the large desk.
“Just fine?” Daddy asked, placing his hands lightly on Dean’s hips, just over where his suit pants sat, pulled up but not buttoned.
“No one knew I was there,” Dean whispered, arching into the touch, “I thought you might let people watch, or touch me, but you didn’t. I was hidden away, just for you. It was hot.”
The pressure on his balls lessened, and Daddy was back to fondling them. Dean had never really been one to get his balls hurt but he had to admit, this was really doing it for him. Maybe it was the edging, or the powerful man in front of him, but within a few strokes, Dean was already close again, right on the brink of coming.
I didn't do an Advanced Reader Copy for this chapter bc it's not even sexy, but Chapter Three will have an ARC so! lemme know if ur interested and I'll pick someone to share it with once it's written.
“I—,” Dean was hyper aware of his reddened, sensitive crotch, “Helen—the waxer, she said not to touch the skin while it was inflamed, or it could get, uh, an ingrown hair or something.”
“Should we put these panties to good use?” Cas asks, palming at Dean’s soft skin through the hole in the back of his underwear.
“Very much,” He answered, breaking the staring match he had with the river, “I’ve never seen so much water in my life.”
Castiel chewed his lip nervously. He ran his fingers along the cold metal of his gun, gripping it tightly the way he remembered Dean’s hands positioning his.
Daddy pulled back for a second, and Dean thought he’d come right then as Daddy leaned down slightly to spit, the saliva hitting his cheek and running downwards. Daddy must have taken his dick in hand, because he rubbed his cockhead through the mess and spread around before settling back in and fucking Dean’s cheeks again, faster this time against wet skin.
“Take a hit,” He said, “Why’d you get into all this heavy shit anyway? It’s a beautiful day, the sun is out, and we’re not in prison. Let’s just all be chill.”
“Rise and shine, pretty women,” He said upon his return, “The day is half gone and we’ve only just begun.”
He trailed off, staring out the window into the dark of the parking lot, his face half in shadow. They were in a strange situation - had he not acted on instinct, he would probably still be at home, spending his nights taking orders and discussing the disappeared murderer. But he felt panic, desperation, when that thing - the ‘Crocotta’ - had pushed over people he knew. Castiel had never had much in common with the people he lived around, but that never meant they weren’t his people. Castiel had felt it within him, this urgency to get to the creature before it’s hideous teeth made a second appearance.
“Good boy,” Daddy murmured, and it earned him another kiss, wet and hot against his jawline, “And after, when I held your nose? Did you like that?”
“It’s okay,” Castiel said, scratching at a hangnail, “I got emancipation and an old house full of belongings.”
He googled ‘Genesis Enterprises’, but only found some bullshit landing page with generic stock images and a mission statement that was potentially the vaguest thing Dean had ever read. There was no information on who worked for the company, or any contact details. It was clearly a decoy page, and a decoy company name.
The bag was pulled up and off his head, revealing his boss standing in front of him, bathed softly in lamp-light and looking comfortable in casual clothes in the middle of a spacious modern looking bedroom.
“You just told me I can be either your personal whore or beat people up, all because of some bullshit debt that you’ve decided is my problem. With you, I want a safe word.”
Dean took a sharp breath in, turning his head as if to hide it in Daddy’s shoulder, but Daddy wouldn’t let him. Why he was even admitting to any of this was beyond him. Daddy just seemed to get every little thought out of his head.
“Are those all for me, babe?” He asks, concerned, “That’s too much! You already put money in with my parents for our vacation...”
Dean nodded dumbly, stepping away from his boss to reach for his clothes, still piled on the floor. His brain was foggy with the need to come, his dick aching, begging him to keep going. He stumbled into his jeans and underwear, pulling them up at the same time, gently tucking his cock, still wet and slick, into his pants. He pulled on his shirts too, haphazard and distracted.
Daddy wasn’t far behind him, grunting as he bit down on the skin of Dean’s neck, his hips stuttering and coming to a stop as he milked himself. Dean held him close as he breathed through it. Daddy pressed a few soft kisses to the bite mark he’d left behind, before rolling off of Dean, who was sorry to see him go.
It wasn’t awful, Dean thought. The clippers pulled at a pubic hair every now and then, and the quick, sharp pain was enough to stop him from getting hard as Helen gently moved his dick out of the way of wherever she was trimming.
“Is this sexy?” Daddy asked, “Do you feel this is increasing your enjoyment, by adding anticipation?”
Dean was hard again, his cock back to its old tricks, a thin line of pre-come dripping down onto the leather beneath him. He felt a finger pressing against his rim. Soon enough it was two, and then Daddy was pressing and curling his fingers inside Dean, his mouth moving down to kiss and lick Dean’s sac as it hung heavy between his legs. Dean’s hands clenched, grabbing at the cushion in front of him, the waves of pleasure rolling through him as Daddy pressed all his buttons.
Cas pulls back, his chin shiny with his own spit. There’s lube on the bed next to him, and he skirts some onto his fingertips, rubbing it between Dean’s cheeks. He hikes Dean’s legs up, and slides his dick along the line of Dean’s ass, same as he did the morning, teasing him with slow back and forth movements.
Although, the guy did seem a little unhinged. Maybe he wouldn’t care if Dean died, knowing John had another son if he got bored of the first. The thought made Dean sick. He’d need to figure out a way to make himself indispensable.
“Sure,” Hannah said, “But if you don’t actually work for the company, then the loan will accrue interest. You’d owe more and more every month until the debt was doubled and then we’d have to smash your skull in.”
“Get on with it,” Daddy said, eyes flicking down to where Dean’s cock still stood, hard and leaking, “And take your shirt off.”
Dean looked up and saw the terrified face of his cashier. Who, he figured, was now his accomplice in what looked a lot like a murder.
“You,” Dean pants, “I belong to you. My ass is yours, my cock. My pleasure. I want you to have it, want you to take it.”
Dean got his knees under him, his ass exposed while his head and chest stayed pressed into the leather beneath him.
He wanted to fuck into his fist, but balance was hard when he was perched like this on the edge of the desk, with his knees pressed as far as they could go to either side. Instead he settled for watching Daddy watch him, twisting his hand on the upstroke, slow and firm, his eyes hooded as he put on a show. He was close, breathing hard as he worked his hand over himself.
Suddenly, he heard the door swing shut behind him. Before he could turn, a woman entered his field of vision, stepping gracefully behind the desk, taking the seat opposite him. She had a thin manila folder with her, but she didn’t open it.
They sat in silence, the room so still aside from the gentle rustle of pages moving, that it took a few minutes for Dean to notice that there was soft jazz playing, audible enough to fill the quiet room but not loud enough to be intrusive. Or noticeable, even.
He slicks most of it on his dick, and rubs the rest between Dean’s cheeks, against his red, puffy hole. He takes on of Dean’s knees and pushes, rolling Dean onto his back, with his legs spread wide. He pulls Dean down the bed, into his lap.
“You didn’t know,” Dean said firmly, cutting him off, “You didn’t know it would go down right at that moment. Mistakes happen.”
“I’ve been thinking about it,” Castiel replied, “Which was distracting. Maybe I should punish you for making my mind drift while I’m meant to be working. Your ass is lovely when it’s all pink and pretty.”
Dean whined a little, the words overwhelming him. He felt Daddy’s other hand move beneath him, between him and the couch, and groaned loudly as Daddy pinched his left nipple, rolling it between two fingers.
“That was good at first,” he said, his voice barely above a whisper, “But it was... I thought you might kill me.”
“Good,” Cas replies, running his soft fingertips down to Dean’s groin, where his cock is indeed stiffening where it lies. Cas strokes the underside, teasing the ridge under the head, before moving his hand down to Dean’s balls, rolling them in his palm.
He places the box to the side and reaches for the next one. It’s got a ribbon on it, the package soft and squishy. He looks at Cas, but his face isn’t giving anything away.
“We were all set to go camping last night. We got our bags packed and our house locked up. It’ll look like we’re not coming back.”
“I have... Brothers,” he said, carefully, as though he was weighing every word, “They do much the same thing that I do, just in different cities. One of them made a rather large mess, and now the rest of us have to clean it up.”
Castiel went to wake the fry cook and Dean sat at a table by the window, looking out into the quiet of the night - he’d been right when he thought he’d find it here.
“Well, I did get my balls waxed, so that wasn’t exactly fun.” Dean replied, stiff in Daddy’s arms, “I didn’t think you’d be the type to like the completely bald look.”
Cas tuned out the rest of the conversation, choosing instead to focus on Dean, the line of his shoulders in his too-big leather jacket. The bend in his legs, and the way he tapped the tip of his boot against the floor while his other leg took all his weight.
Dean rolled his eyes, just a little, feeling exasperated with everyone telling him that his father’s fuck up was his to deal with. That’s what people said when they wanted to screw you over.
An extra burger in hand for Ash, they strode back out into the night with purpose, as though they were men with places to be.
It took him a moment before he could think clearly again, while the strange man in question pressed soft kisses to the bruising on his throat.
Dean hurried to straighten his clothes before leaving his room to greet Castiel. He wasn’t sure what mood his boss would be in, and wanted to follow orders as best he could to avoid pissing him off again.
He slid on a pair of lounge pants and a t-shirt, both soft cotton that felt more expensive than anything he’d ever worn before.
Lunch with Dean’s parents seems to drag on forever. He’s pleased to see them, of course he is, but he also wants to be back home, in bed, riding his boyfriend like his life depends on it.
He could sell some stuff, he supposed. Not his car—never the car, but he had a few things lying around that he could do without. Like the television, or whichever kitchen appliances weren’t nailed down, if it came to that.
He moved his hands onto Dean’s chest, fingers running across the soft fabric of his t-shirt. Dean’s hands were at his hips, unsure of themselves. It was so sweet, and so at odds with Dean’s confident demeanor that Cas couldn’t wait any longer.
“Not everyone can have an ass this perky with tits to match,” Dean said, matter of factly, “It really gives me an edge.”
“I’d deserve it,” Dean said, like he was admitting a secret, “I want you to think about me all the time. Means I’m doing my job right.”
They slept that way until the sun came up properly, casting bright light across the floor through the cactus-patterned curtains. It was all a bit much for Castiel.
“I—Yes?” Dean answered, unsure of how he could have misbehaved, before hastily continuing, “uh, Daddy.”
Soon enough he was being shown into another impersonal white reception area, except this one had a little white candle burning. Hannah walked right past reception again, like she’d been there a hundred times before. So far, they hadn’t had to check for appointments at all, everyone was just... Expecting them. Waiting for them to show up. Maybe it was good that Dean was going to be a boy-toy, he wasn’t sure he would ever be organized enough to personally assist anyone like his Boss.
“Roll a new one, I’ll come join you.” Castiel said, unbuckling his seat belt to clamber over into the back.
“That’s too bad. Don’t you want to come open your presents?” Cas says, trying to coax a reaction from Dean.
He pressed his lips to Dean’s, insistent and searing hot. Dean squeaked into his mouth as Daddy hauled him closer by grabbing his ass and squeezing it, fingers digging into the inflamed flesh beneath thin denim.
His Boss stood then, and walked around the desk to stand next to him, grabbing Dean’s chin and forcing him to crane his neck to make eye-contact.
“Well,” he said, tensing up as he recalled the morning. He hoped his boss wouldn’t mind too much about the snooping, or that he took food without permission. It was probably fine, he told himself. “I found a little kitchen area with some snacks, so I just took some of those.”
There was a door directly across from him, between the vanity and the sofa. To his right, was an archway leading to the biggest wardrobe Dean had ever seen. There were drawers and shelves and rows of hangers. There was a floor length mirror, presumably for him to stare at himself as he got dressed in whatever his Boss had requested to see him in.
“You could head back up to the roadhouse,” Dean suggested, “A good a place as any if you don’t want to be in the field.”
Dean nodded stiffly, accepting the pen his Boss passed him, and signing his life away on all the appropriate dotted lines.
His face stung, and Dean felt like sulking. He was just trying to avoid getting spit everywhere, but if the Boss wanted a drooling mess in his pants, then a drooling mess he would get.
He used his tongue a little, but his Boss seemed mostly content to just fuck his face, so Dean focused on sucking at the right times and keeping himself from gagging when he got too much cock too close to the back of his throat. Dean was hard, loving the feeling of being used, his cock making a damp patch on the front of his pretty underwear.
Dean remembered his come, and wiping it up with his hand before licking it off his fingers, wanting to do it now before it was cold and disgusting.
Castiel’s chose to shut his eyes tight and focus on his breathing, rather than look around him as the town he grew up in rushed past in the dark. He’d never see it again. Not that he minded, much.
Dean was already getting hard in his shorts, thinking about how it had felt last week when Daddy had bent him over the dining table and spanked him. He’d liked it in the past, when a partner would playfully slap his ass a little, but this had been something else, intense and hot, his sensitive skin stinging and reddened, turning him on far more than he ever expected it to.
“I know that it’s the spirit of some little kid who disappeared in the vicinity of the town well, so three guesses as to what happened.”
Dean laughed quietly against his neck, his hands running dizzying laps around Cas’s skin, across his chest and down his arms. Cas used his grip on Dean to rearrange them, pulling Dean on top of him properly, the full weight of him pressing Cas down into the mattress. It was addictive, Cas was sure of it. Now that he knew what it felt like, he couldn’t imagine not wanting it every minute of the rest of his life.
They declined April’s offer of a cooked breakfast, feeling sick in their souls after smelling burnt meat all night. The moment they got back to the motel, Castiel stripped off his dirty, sooty clothes and climbed into bed, lying down on his front.
They lay together like that for maybe twenty minutes, and Cas spends his time alternating between idly running his fingers across Dean’s chest and stomach, and gently circling his hips into Dean’s wet hole.
He heard Dean shout behind him, his name, higher and more hysterical the longer it took for Cas to find his weapon.
Dean watched as his boss got up, pulling a thick robe from the closet and shrugging into it. He picked up the black bag from the foot of the bed and tossed it in Dean’s direction without a glance, before leaving the room and shutting the door loudly behind him.
“I’ve always wanted to be thought of as intimidating and formidable.” He said, crossing his arms on the table.
Cas took himself in hand again, Dean’s come slicking the way, and began to jerk himself off, watching Dean watch him.
“Anyways, it’s another five hours east, so let’s get moving before the sun goes down. I saw the Chainsaw Massacres, and I ain’t driving through Texas at night.” Dean said, winking at his companions as he got up again.
“I’m going to sit quietly for a while,” Castiel said, stepping down into the main living room, “Would you pour me a drink?”
I'm so sorry for taking so long to finish this! I've had three thousand words just sitting in a doc since literally the last time I posted. In my head it's only been a few months since then but turns out my head is not accurate and it's actually been nearly a whole year. Oops.
“Alright, I’m beat. Let’s get an hour or two of shuteye before we go and see a man about a very big dog.” Dean said, laying back on the double bed to the left of Castiel’s.
“I’m going to blow you later, I think,” Cas said, rubbing his thumb against Dean’s tip, “Would you like that?”
When Dean gets to the bedroom, he finds Cas standing naked at the edge of the bed, a thick cock ring in place.
“Very. But I knew you’d be here waiting when I got back, so I had good reason to get everything done quickly,” Castiel said, his fingertips ghosting along Dean’s sides. It nearly tickled.
“Ready to go?” Hannah asked, leaning gracefully against the front desk, tucking a wallet into her handbag.
“It can be like that at first,” Hannah said, “I’ll leave you to it. The only instruction I have to pass on is that you should change into fresh clothes, otherwise you’re free to do what you like. The Boss will be down at eight to have his breakfast with you.” She turned and left, already focusing on her phone again.
They lay low in Rapid City for a few days, in a motel on a street lined with trees. Castiel supposed it was canopy of green above his head that made him feel a little more concealed and safe, but perhaps it was because he was being kept preoccupied with learning how to use a firearm. It made him uncomfortable, knowing that the cool metal in his hands was meant for killing, but the weight of it in his palm felt like an acceptable balance to finding out that things really do go bump in the night. He hadn’t actually fired it yet, for which he was glad.
“I don’t owe anybody anything,” Dean said, his tone icy as his patience wore thin. He put the glass down and crossed his arms.
“Well, I hunt ‘em down. They don’t always need killing. Sometimes they’re already dead - like ghosts and other crap.”
“Mm, Sounds ominous,” Dean says, shuffling himself back against Cas, taking his hand and resting them both on his stomach.
Cas redoubles his efforts, finding his second wind. Their torsos are pressed so close together, sweaty and hot, rubbing at Dean’s cock from both sides. He’s writhing beneath Cas, clutching him as he gets fucked into. One particularly well placed thrust and Dean can’t hold back any longer, coming hard, crying out as he spills across their skin, adding to the slick heat between their bodies.
“Fine. Let me just get dressed,” Dean said, moving to shut the door again, only to find his way blocked by a big thick arm against the wood.
Fuck, it felt huge. If he wasn’t careful his jaw was going to ache. There were a few more moments of shuffling, adjusting their positions until his mouth was full, cock head pressing almost uncomfortably at his throat, and then they settled.
They must be about the same height, Dean thought, but his Other Option seemed so imposing. He had dark hair and bright eyes, blue like the sky as dusk settles. He wore a suit, a nice one, and while it hid the finer points of his figure, Dean could tell that this guy was stacked.
“Good boy,” Cas says, voice low as he watches Dean slides them slowly up his legs, settling them into place over his hardness, the cut out resting perfectly on the curves of his cheeks.
“So... I come here and just bend over when and where you tell me to?” he asked, shifting in his seat.
“Alright, but when you need a Nana nap, you just let me know and I’ll make sure no perverts molest her while you’re asleep.”
The squeeze became a clench as a voice, her voice, drifted across the breeze, mingling with the quiet conversation of the trees. He almost thought he’d imagined it, as one often does in these situations, but then it came again. Calling him, his name.
Dean felt like the bottom of his stomach had dropped out. That explained his father’s hasty exit then.
“You don’t have to eat it,” the Boss said, “You can order something else if you don’t like what they’ve made.”
Dean blushed harder, gripping the cushion in front of him again as he thought about what Daddy wanted from him—to hump the couch, to fuck his dick against the leather seat until he came. He was so wet, the lace of the thong sticking to his tip, the drag of it delicious. Daddy’s cock was so hot between his cheeks, he wished it was inside of him, filling him up. He felt out of his mind with how bad he wanted to be fucked in that moment, surprised at himself with how much he craved it, needed it.
Dean sulkily picked at his breakfast, the home fries going cold as he dawdled. His ego was bruised and his ass still hurt, despite the soft silk of the panties he’d chosen that morning, a plain black colour, fabric smooth against his skin.
Dean drifted for a moment, sated and warm in the most comfortable bed he’d ever experienced, and jumped a little when he felt a warm washcloth against his stomach.
Hannah ushered him through the heavy wooden doors of their Boss’s quarters, and Dean felt his cheeks heat up again as he saw the white sofa where he’d exposed himself the previous evening.
It was unfortunate that Castiel chose then to refill his cup, the pouring of the coffee masking the sounds of rustling grass in the still night air. And that he then asked quietly for the time, meaning that Dean was not watching when the stalks around them began to shift. By the time Dean noticed, the dog was on them, and he had but a split second to get the shot off.
At least she was quick, swiping hot wax between his cheeks, which he had to hold open for her. He’d never felt more exposed in his life, and less than twelve hours ago he was jerking off in front of someone who could definitely kill him and get away with it.
“Hannah should know better than to forget a member of staff, that’s her job,” Castiel said, moving away from Dean and pulling his phone out of his pocket, tapping away at it rapidly, “You should at least have a way to contact her.” Fury radiated from him.
Dean palmed himself over the silk, wanting to take the opportunity to show off. He ran his other hand over his chest, his touch light until he got to a nipple, where he began pinching and rolling it through the fabric of his shirt. Daddy watched him with an impassive face, but his eyes followed every movement he made. He ran a finger along his length, a delicate touch that seemed at odds with how hard Dean was, how turned on he felt in that moment.
At ten past nine, Dean gave up waiting. He figured that if Castiel wanted to see him, he’d be here to see him. He retired to the small powder room that was his own, eager to shower and change his clothes.
Dean moaned again, desperate this time. He couldn’t see anything, eyes hidden behind the mask, and fuck if this wasn’t terrifying. His eyes started watering, his vision going fuzzy even though all he could see was darkness. His hands scrabbled at the Boss’ thighs, trying to push himself away. He wouldn’t budge.
“I won’t ask again,” Daddy said, his voice quiet but dangerous, sharp like the blade of a well hidden dagger.
“Yeah, it shows,” Ash said, quickly backtracking as he saw Dean’s face, “I mean. Not much. Only if you know what to look for.”
“Sorry Daddy,” he murmured back, feeling his cheeks flush harder as his cock throbbed at the sight of it.
“Yeah, Cas,” Dean says, enjoying this chance to see Cas fall apart first, “That’s right, I’m your pretty boy.”
he’d wanted to say, but didn’t. In reality, Dean was nearly twenty-six years old and should be able to make decisions for himself. If he couldn’t say ‘no’ when his father suggested they up and move cities to be close to Sam, that was on him and he knew it.
The head tailor, Mr. Flack, measured him all over. His shoulders, his back, the width and breadth of his chest. How long his legs were, how fat his ass was. He called the measurements out to his twiggy little assistant that Dean couldn’t remember the name of, and Dean just stood there on the fitting podium in his socks with his arms out to either side.
“You can come whenever you like,” Daddy said, sitting up to watch Dean move, taking his hands with him.
Taking Dean’s cock in his hand instantly made it to the top five best moments of Cas’s life. It was pretty, flushed pink at the tip, and in proportion with the rest of Dean. He thought of all the things he might do with Dean’s dick in the future, and squeezed their dicks together in his palm.
“I don’t know about that. One of ‘em saw monster teeth and didn’t crap his pants, the other has a big computer and a mean right hook.”
Fuck, oh god. Dean chubbed up just thinking about it, the strength his boss would be able to put into each swing with his thick, muscular arms.
Cas pulls out, and works the cock ring off of his dick, before pushing back in. He’s been ready to go, hard for nearly a full hour, and it only takes a few thrusts before he’s coming hard inside Dean, splashing hot and wet inside of him, working through his orgasm.
“Right,” Dean said, “No connections between any of them, and who’s going to be murdering so many people in such a small town?”
“I wish Chupacabra’s looked like fuckin’ Lassie.” Dean said, tossing crumpled wrappers into the trash.
There was a goon leaning against the opposite wall, who started walking off the second the door clicked shut, not bothering to wait for Dean.
“Open it!” Cas urges, his head resting against Dean’s shoulder, one hand resting gently on Dean’s bicep.
Castiel hid his smile in his eyes, focusing on the curve of the road and the mountains falling away to the right of him. There was every chance that they would get to wherever they were going and, someday, the cops would be waiting to meet them - but Castiel knew in his gut that it was unlikely. He tried to avoid naivety by vowing to himself he wouldn’t blindly trust the man who said monsters were real, but it was a pointless promise. He’d witnessed the creature’s teeth with his own eyes, and he knew a good man when he saw one.
“It can’t hurt. I mean, in a small town, the fewer people around, the fewer people to see us, right? But the fewer people that those folks see everyday. We’d stick out like a bunch of sore thumbs. Not good. In a city, there are more people to spot us, but no one’s going to be looking.”
“I heard you walked off your shift last night, is that true?” Jerry asked, getting straight to business.
Dean sat there in his Boss’s bed, naked and rubbing at his sore neck as he tried to take stock of what had just happened. Of all the names he imagined his boss having, Castiel wasn’t one of them.
“The thing was called a Crocotta,” Dean interrupted, “And probably your dentist was long dead. It was just wearing his skin.”
He felt the laugh rumble through Daddy’s chest, and a kiss against his shoulder, and then he was drifting off to sleep.
It was dark in the living room, the only light coming from the city beyond the huge windows, when Dean woke suddenly. His legs were cold and he noticed the blanket was gone, but that wasn’t what woke him—there was the heavy weight of someone on top of him. He stiffened, moving to get his arms underneath him when he heard a voice.
“Anything,” Dean replied quickly, his mind suddenly blank of every food he’d ever liked, “uh, I really like bacon cheeseburgers. With heaps of fries. And a beer.”
He had his head tipped back in pleasure, eyes falling shut as he jacked his dick, and then Daddy squeezed him again, hard, and that was all it took before Dean came, spurting his release all over his own chest. He stroked himself through it, tipping his head down to look at Daddy, just in time to see him move forward and lick a stripe right through Dean’s come.
He toyed with the band of his boxer briefs, hesitating. Daddy pursed his lips a little, like he sensed it, his eyes fixed on Dean’s hands.
Dean leaned his head against the window, watching as the lights of Chicago approached. He felt sick, a dull throb behind his eye and his guts like lead as he thought about his father.
Dean had had no choice but to collect his wallet and go with the men, the main thug and the two other, thinner-necked thugs. They’d walked him out to the Rolls in the parking lot, standing uncomfortably close as they did so, before all but pushing him into the backseat. They took his phone.
Dean was half on top of him, his strong thigh nestled between Castiel’s and Cas could feel the hot press of him against his hip. He pushed his hands under the waistband of Dean’s underwear, the last barrier to having a gloriously naked Dean in his lap.
“You sit in it, and lean forward,” the Boss said, sitting down to watch as Dean figured out what to do.
He crossed the room and pulled Dean into a hug, holding him close for a long moment. It was oddly tender compared to the way they’d parted that earlier
“Thank you,” Dean said, letting out the breath he’d been holding, “Daddy,” he added hastily, not wanting to make tomorrow any worse.
“They don’t got the right bullets.” Dean said, with a look full of meaning that Castiel failed to grasp.
“Good,” Daddy said, once he’d finished, letting him stand up straight again, “I have to do some work now. Let’s go.”
“What am I supposed to do with this, huh?” He asks, gesturing to his erection, “It’s my birthday and you’re going to leave me like this? You’re terrible.”
Dean was left, half hard and fully dazed, resting on his little stand under the desk. He felt embarrassed for panicking, knowing that his Boss wouldn’t let him die, not when he’d only managed to work off about sixty dollars of his dipshit father’s debt.
Soon enough Daddy’s hips stuttered to a stop and Dean felt come spread hot and thick behind his balls. He thought of what Daddy had said about combing it out of his pubes and was suddenly very grateful that he’d been waxed clean.
“We do have openings, if you’d like to work off your debt,” Hannah said, ignoring his remark, “If you were to start with us immediately, you’d be put into Debt Collection.”
Cas is losing his composure now, he’s been hard for so long and desperate to come, wanting to spill inside of his boyfriend, luxuriate in the pleasure they give each other.
It was really, really small. And sparse. There was nothing but an empty desk with a chair on either side, and one large window that stretched from floor to ceiling. Thick-neck pushed him into the chair in front of the desk, as though this was some sort of waiting room. Dean looked over his shoulder, watching him step back outside and take up a place at the door. Guarding him.
“I’m going to go wash off. Stay put,” his Boss said, sounding a little breathless as he stood and left the room.
He gripped the steering wheel tighter and frowned into middle-distance. It wasn’t like he was begging anyone to stay, he thought.
This though, this was different. Daddy’s tongue was like magic, flicking gently along his rim, swirling against him and then pressing against his hole, wet and slippery tongue spearing into him. Dean had been sleepy and relaxed, but soon he was strung tight, desperate for more, pressing his ass back against his Daddy’s mouth as Daddy licked him open, moaning against Dean’s hole like he was the one being pleasured.
In the end, he forgot most of what Dean had told him, not waiting for heartbeats or breaths, but holding the gun as steady as possible, aimed at the wiry brown fur that he could barely see in the starlight.
“No, it’s- It’s fine,” Castiel said, “Really. I get it. It’s not exactly like you can clock in before you go staking vampires or something. It’s just, you know. A bit shocking.”
“Do you think you’ll need a safeword?” his Other Option asked in response, staring right at Dean like he could see into his very soul.
His hands dropped to unbuckle his belt, opening it slowly, his movements like molasses. His boss seemed to like it, his posture unchanged, but his eyes glued to Dean’s every movement. Like he was trying to appear unaffected. The hunger in his gaze gave him away.
“What are you gonna do, Daddy?” Dean asked, feeling flirty and wanting to tease. He arched his back, pushing his ass back against Castiel.
Dean threw up his arms, but he took his shoes off anyway, lying flat on his back and staring blankly at the ceiling. Castiel surveyed him, one eyebrow raised.
“You’re a dick,” Dean says, but he’s pleased all the same. They’ll be nice to have inside him on a lazy sunday at home.
Daddy was still sitting on the ottoman in front of him, his face about a foot away from where Dean was stroking himself, the intense, burning gaze of his eyes focused on Dean and his ministrations. Dean couldn’t remember the last time he’d been this turned on. Daddy was looking at him like he wanted to devour Dean, and Dean was just about ready to let him.
He spent most of the day like that, lounging on his velvet sofa in his pretty knickers, drinking coffee and reading a book on Chicago history that he’d found in the living room. It was nice. He hoped he was getting paid, but he wouldn’t be overly mad if today was a write off.
Dean nodded, and got ready to leave. He shoved his feet into his ratty old boots and grabbed his phone and his jacket, before gesturing for Thick-neck to lead the way. Thick-neck stayed where he was, hand out. Dean sighed, passing his phone over once again.
Dean laughed, hopping down from the desk and tucking away his dick. His legs felt like jelly, his whole body loose and relaxed.
He could have been posing for a painting, legs stretched the width of the cab, with his torso resting on a love-seat of duffel bags, head loling back.
He tensed up, fingers tightening as he wondered how many people were in the room while he warmed his Boss’ cock in his mouth, wearing a pink princess eye-mask and silk panties. If anyone came around behind the desk, they’d be able to see him no problem, chin shiny with drool and a thick hefty dick between his lips. His cheeks burned at the thought of it, of anyone seeing him like this, nothing but a warm wet hole for a man with too much power.
“Can I ask something?” he said, handing the signed document back to his Boss, who just raised his eyebrows, waiting for the query.
Suddenly he’s got Dean’s thighs on his shoulders, and he’s spreading Dean’s cheeks, kissing along the sensitive skin between them, across his dry hole. Dean squirms, having been wildly unprepared for this.
Eventually he fell into a youtube rabbit hole, just letting the phone play whatever was next. He stretched out on the sofa, pulling one of the throw blankets over him. He propped the phone up against a cushion and watched youtube sleepily as the mid winter light of the afternoon faded, his eyelids drooping while the sun dipped below the horizon. He lay on his stomach, cozy and warm under a blanket on the most comfortable couch he’d even been on, and drifted off to sleep.
Feeling Dean on top of him, as naked as the day was long, felt like revelation. He was careful not to crush Cas, their cocks sliding into play next to one another. It was glorious. Dean’s hands gripped at Cas, looking for something to anchor him down as though he might otherwise float away.  Cas held him, a soothing hand at the back of his neck to keep him close for kissing, while the other explored the curved expanse of his back.
“Daddy,” Dean moaned breathily, not caring how he sounded in that moment, just knowing that he needed Daddy to keep going, to hold him close and come on him, use him like he was supposed to. Hearing Daddy’s deep voice, his noises of pleasure, but not being able to see him was hotter than Dean expected, but he still wanted to turn and see Daddy’s face, to confirm that he was feeling good.
“Is that clear?” his Boss was saying as Dean tried to fumble his way into comprehending the full scope of what he’d just heard.
“You gonna stop by and see Sam on your way out?” Dean asked, at least trying to figure out if his father was heading east through Chicago or not.
“Yes,” Dean replies, his throat dry. He holds up a lacy pair with a heart shaped cut out, “Whenever you want.”
“Oh,” Cas said, shifting his duffle to the floor, watching as Dean walked over to him, “I like a guy with a nice smile.”
“You really are lovely,” his boss said, rubbing firmly over his cheeks, grabbing a handful of his ass and squeezing.
“I’m usually far more careful. This creature was a dickbag, lucky enough to be in a small town. Well, lucky for him.”
Bobby phoned and let him know he was dealing with a Crocotta, and an outdated one at that. Usually these things had adapted to technology and phoned or emailed their victims. It had been a long time since one had gone old school and lured people into the woods. Then again, Dean reasoned, this town was on the small side of podunk.
Dean suddenly felt small, cold and exposed on the couch, covered in semen. He sat up and reached for the napkins from his dinner, cleaning up the sofa and himself as best he could. He looked over at his boss, who had already put his cock away but left his belt hanging open.
The pressure abated for a moment, Dean knelt over him so they could both ease off their underwear. Cas could feel his heart racing but it didn’t register, his focus solely on Dean’s face hovering above his, his chest moving as his breath quickened.
Dean felt a bit stunned, held in place by the intense gaze Castiel was leveling at his groin, and all he could do was watch as his boss leaned back in, directly nuzzling his cock this time, feeling the heat of breath against his sensitive skin. The pressure felt so good, nose and wet lips against his flesh wherever the gaps in the lace allowed contact. He brought his hands to rest on Castiel’s shoulders, cupping the base of his skull in one palm, combing his fingers through the short hairs there.
Dean’s eyes snapped back down, focused on the man’s face. His fingers trembled a little as they pulled off his shirt, a plaid button up. He watched his boss watch him, dropping the shirt to the floor and grabbing the hem of his t-shirt.
Castiel turned back around to face the front, the progress of the sunrise having flooded the whole sky. He could see better through the windshield.
“I don’t give a fuck how the law works, Dean,” his voice soft but clearly dangerous, “Your family owes my family, and this is how it is, no matter how much you wish it weren’t. Take your lot and be grateful I’m being this lenient with you. Figure out your shit.”
“Sure, if you want.” Cas says seriously, “You could get on your knees for me and fuck your new toy.”
“Dean, we have to get up,” Cas says, rutting a little more insistently, “We’ve got breakfast with your parents.”
“When it comes down to it,” Dean said, interrupting Castiel’s thoughts, “It was a fight-or-flight kinda deal, and your brain said to fight, to protect.”
“Oh, you’re not wrong. Sometimes I genuinely worry that he’s a genius in hiding from the government, I mean, he knows how to do things that regular people wouldn’t know, you know?”
“Like a guy who knows how to have a good time,” Dean said, his voice light, “But keep the fumes outside the car.”
He blushed at that, that he’d admitted it at all, but the look Castiel gave him made it all worth it. Suddenly Castiel was leaning forwards, and Dean felt a flash of heat in his stomach as his boss pressed his face against Dean’s crotch, rubbing his face slowly against the soft fabric. His nose nudged Dean’s cock, which was starting to show interest in the current proceedings.
Dean gathered his things, including the new phone and it’s charger, before walking to Castiel’s office. The door was open, but he stopped at the entrance anyway, knocking cautiously on the wood.
Dean’s jaw drops a little when he opens it. There must be at least fifteen pairs of underwear, all neatly folded. Satin, lace, soft cotton. A pair of silk shorts that will definitely leave his ass hanging out, but he supposes that’s the entire point of them. There are bright jewel tones, and soft pastels, sheer and frilly, as well as a pair of wicked looking black panties that lace up in the back with a length of shiny ribbon.
It was a Tuesday night and Dean was in the backseat of a black SUV—a Rolls Royce, with tinted windows and a mini-fridge. The doors were locked and he couldn’t see a button to unlock them again, not that he’d try to if he found one. There was a stocky, bald-headed man in the driver's seat, with a similar looking guy riding shotgun. There was another goon in the back next to him, sitting quietly and staring straight ahead. What a boring job, Dean thought.
“Perfect,” his Boss said, making a note on the contract, “You’ll be fine carrying on with that then.”
“Okay,” Dean said, trying to cover the mess in his lap as casually as possible, “Do you want me to stay, or...?”
“Of course,” Castiel replied, a smile tugging at the corner of his mouth, “Do whatever you want with it.”
Dean followed him, down the other hallway and into a room with huge windows. It was softly lit, and beyond that Dean could see the shell-pink colour of the sky as dawn broke.
“I’m taking you wherever you want to go, seeing as you just helped me kill the thing wearing your dentist.”
It felt good, to be touched, not only gently but at all, by firm hands that delivered pain which had crossed over into pleasure. The stinging started to feel good. Dean's eyes were watering but he wanted more.
The man sat down opposite him, on an expensive looking square ottoman that was large enough to seat four people.
“You were made for this,” He says, “Made to lie back and take my cock for as long as I want you to have it.”
“You’re an asshole,” Dean had said to the silence of the empty living room. He’d immediately felt childish, unable to say it to John’s face, and knowing John wouldn’t care if he did. It was maddening.
Fingers tightened in his hair again, and his Boss started moving his head for him, pushing Dean down onto his cock before dragging him off again, his hips shoving upwards on the downstroke. It felt incredible, and Dean put himself to work, trying to do all the things he remembered liking about blow jobs.
“I guess we’re coming with you, to Santa Fe,” Castiel said, unsure of himself, “Will it be a long drive?”
Any reply Castiel might have had was then cut off by the arrival of two plates stacked with grease. Dean looked pleased, and Castiel was pleased in turn. They only talked a little over their dinner, two people sharing time in the pre-dawn stillness of a city at rest. It was dark in the diner, and so when Dean spoke more of vampires and how many he’d met, he did so while bathed in orange light from the street-lamp outside. It was quiet, and it was calm, and he felt at peace.
Dean followed Daddy’s line of sight, landing on the spot of pre-come he’d drooled on the polished surface.
Parking back under the trees, he turned his car off and sat for a bit, looking. Listening to the rustle of the pines above him. He got out of the car, and walked deeper into the trees. The light was different in this valley, and it made him want to climb the nearest slope, until he could see the sun again. An irrational squeezing in his gut told him he wouldn’t.
Castiel had never seen a river so large. He sat for an hour with the window rolled all the way down, his chin resting on his arm as the air rushed by, whipping his hair around his face, watching as the sun sparkled and winked at him in the reflection of the water.
He took his time in the shower, letting the warm water wake him up and soothe his tired body. He resolutely ignored his dick—he was mad at it, for getting so excited the previous evening, for making him look eager and easy. Not that he wasn’t eager and easy, he just didn’t like people to know it.
Dean paused, fingers drumming on the table top. His eyes were fixed on a point just over Cas’s shoulder, and Cas could feel his indecision as though it were a tangible thing.
Dean settled his focus onto the road, letting the rumble of the engine play soundtrack to the regressing of dawn from the sky.  Snores drifted up from the backseat. Castiel kept looking at him.
“Yeah well. What’s going to happen? No one is going to tell you off for a little pest control, alright? This time I’m sure it’s fine if you get a little sleep.”
Dean pulled the phone away from his ear and looked at it. That had taken barely thirty seconds. He sighed, tossing it to the side and just sitting there, thinking.
It was the first thing anyone had said since they’d started driving, and they’d sat in silence as they sped toward the sun as it gradually peered over the horizon.
Dean felt as Daddy ran a finger through the puddle of come on his lower back, and it drove him crazy. He re-doubled his efforts, so close to the edge and getting closer as Daddy smeared come all over his lower back and his ass, pressing it into his skin as if to mark him.
Dean tried to focus, shifting his brain from the man’s strong jaw line to the words he’d said. Dean frowned.
“You’d better clean that up before Isaiah sees it.” Daddy said, grabbing Dean by the neck and pushing his face towards the table, “He won’t be too happy if you leave that from him to find.”
“Well now, if that doesn’t ring all sorts of bells. Sit tight, I’ve got a feeling.” Bobby said, hanging up.
“Oh dear,” Daddy said, his voice a murmur near Dean’s ear, “You seem to have made a mess on my nice table.”
“Hey, where are you taking me?” he asked, fantasy forgotten as he realized he hadn’t put much effort into double checking the identity of the man who’d come to collect him.
He opened it, and there was Thick-neck, waiting on the other side. His neck looked a little thicker this morning. Dean wondered if he’d had any sleep—he’d barely got any himself, and yet Thick-neck looked as fresh as a body-building daisy.
“Good,” Cas replied, turning back to his bag, wanting to let Dean recover from their little conversation.
Dean was on edge. He’d been delivered to the office building on the dot of eight o'clock, and had been waiting ever since. There were no instructions to follow, and no one to ask what he should do. He wished he had Hannah’s contact details.
“Nah. Baby’s my home,” Dean said, shifting his grip on the steering wheel, “A house just makes things complicated. You always end up feeling like you gotta go back to it.”
Castiel shut off the main lights of the diner, and waited by the back door for Ash, who was wiping down the bench tops for morning. Why a diner in a town of a thousand people was open this late had always been a little bit beyond his comprehension.
“Fuck, you feel so good,” his Boss said, sinking in deep, pushing Dean as far down on his cock as he would go.
“Then I don’t see a problem,” his Other Option said, still considering Dean with a twinkle in his eye.
“You gonna come with me, or you staying put?” Dean asked hurriedly, in a low voice, eyes to the ground.
“I think I’d like to use you now,” his Boss said, and a thrill ran through Dean right to the pit of his stomach.
“Hello there!” Called a wrinkled woman, waving to him from the porch at the front of the beat-up farm house.
“What about you?” Dean said, his brain still a little foggy from what was a surprisingly good blow job.
“Yes Daddy,” Dean said, shifting onto his side to ease the burn from sitting on his freshly-spanked ass.
“Excellent,” Daddy said, shifting back to the ottoman across from him, “One last thing Dean, and then we can make this official.”
He eased his zipper down, so slowly it barely made a noise. Undressing like this, purposefully and methodical, had Dean hardening in his underwear. This became clear as he slid his jeans from his hips, revealing the burgeoning tent that was conveniently right at his boss’s eye level.
It sent a shiver down his spine and he wasn’t sure whether to be creeped out or not. It was a little different than jokingly asking ‘who’s your daddy?’, which wasn’t something he’d ever said anyway, because he wasn’t born in the forties. He sighed, resigning himself to the fact that it wasn’t like he had a choice.
She introduced herself as the widowed April Bushel. Dean asked her about times and dates and places, walking with her out into the pastures to survey animal tracks and damaged fences. He said he felt he could handle her problem. She said he looked nice in a suit. He accepted her offer of fresh lemonade, before promising to return that evening with his colleagues - and every evening after that - until they got the beast. Then he bid her farewell and drove back to town.
“Cas, man,” Dean stopped walking, “I like you and everything but I’ll let you know when you’re allowed to drive my car.”
Dean stretched a little and then got to work, slipping below the blankets to find where Daddy’s cock lay soft against his hip. It was dark beneath the sheets, so Dean worked by feel, pressing sloppy open mouthed kisses along Daddy’s shaft, licking at him gently, slowly getting him hard. Just as he started laving his tongue over and around the tip of Daddy’s cock, there was a noise in the hallway and suddenly the bedroom door was slamming open.
The thing about Hannah was that she was essentially the executive assistant to a mobster. But, Dean reasoned, she’d helped him land this cushy position so that he wouldn’t have to commit any actual crimes, like extortion or assault. He didn’t feel indebted to her at all, but he also didn’t want her to get in trouble because of him. Especially because Castiel always seemed so unhinged in his displeasure.
Things were quieter, with just the two of them. Something about Dean was intoxicating, maybe all of him. Ash had been there to water it down, for Cas to slide into the back seat and distract himself when there was a fluttering in his stomach that he couldn’t identify, or when he didn’t realize he’d been staring at Dean and Dean caught his eye for the fifth time in as many minutes, sending him a small smile that felt significant.
Dean had received a call from Bobby that morning, telling him there was a small town named Wilson at the foot of the Tetons, and that people there were showing up dead - and not by accident. The coroner had written “suicide” on the badly-photocopied form, but there was enough not quite right with it all, and it had Bobby Singer picking up his phone.
“You want me to be a thug?” he asked, “You want me to shake down desperate people for money they don’t have?”
He felt fingers stroke against his warm cheeks, and then knees on either side of his torso. His arms were just kind of hanging there, and he wasn’t sure what to do with them, deciding to place them on his Boss’ calf muscles, which were firm and solid under the expensive wool of his suit.
He jerked his hips a little, gasping at the feeling of his flesh dragging across the leather as Daddy thrust against him. It only took a few seconds before Dean had a rhythm going, matching his movements with Daddy’s, both of them picking up speed as the pleasure grew, not having the patience to make it last.
“We have a salon to go to, and then some fittings after that,” Hannah said, not looking up from whatever it was she was typing.
When he got no answer, he put his hands out in front of him and began walking slowly. Just as he started to wonder how big this room was, he bumped into something soft, knees pressing into what had to be a mattress. He turned and sat down to wait, figuring that he hadn’t been told not to, so why not take the liberty.
Finally, after what felt like eons, he felt the shuffle of feet again, muffled noises fading away as people left the room. Finally, the door swung shut.
I'm hoping for the gap between this chapter and the next to be at least eight times shorter, but we'll see how I do. Thanks again! x
The silk shorts joined the robe on the floor, and Castiel stilled as he registered what Dean had put on for him—the soft white lace of the thong, frills and all, cupping Dean’s rapidly hardening length close against his body.
He rested there for a moment, waiting for the inevitable, already unsure of how long he’d been without his senses. Surely not more than a minute, at most.
Ash leapt over the counter and punched the Crocotta twice in the gut and once in the face, before helping the Cashier get a grip on it.
Dean nodded, agreeing only because sixteen hours on his back was bound to be less physically demanding than sixteen hours tending bar.
“No, you needed it, I suspect. You had a strenuous morning,” Daddy said, massaging something soft into his burning skin, “I would have let you sleep, but I felt compelled to apply lotion to your rear. It looked sore.”
He didn’t have to strain for long, because the fabric twitched slightly, and before he knew what was happening, his Boss was in the cozy dressing room with him.
They walked back down the labyrinth-cum-hallway, the thugs following along behind, before stepping into the elevator once again. This time, Hannah pushed the button for the forty-ninth floor. Of course they’d have to go up even higher.
“Fuck,” Daddy said, standing up to get his phone from wherever it was and answer it, “What do you want?” he barked, short and sharp.
“My family is in town,” Castiel said, breaking the companionable silence, “They’re... Demanding people.”
“Yes,” Hannah smiled, seemingly pleased at Dean’s attitude, “Despite the circumstances surrounding your employment, he’s always made sure to treat us well. I’m sure that will include you.”
“These were an excellent choice,” Daddy said, massaging his ass cheeks with strong, firm hands, “I’m very pleased.”
If Dean yawned every couple of minutes on their drive into Santa Fe, it wasn’t Cas who said anything repeatedly about how such tiredness was avoidable.
Dean was woken up at the crack of six-thirty by his phone ringing, loudly, on the mattress next to his head.
“Right, so that would be going around with those assholes out in the hallway, intimidating people?” Dean asked.
“See you in six weeks,” she said airily as she pushed him back out into the hallway, as though that wasn’t the cruellest thing she’d said since they’d met.
“Good boy,” his boss said, still watching him as he toed on his boots. “You may go. Someone will collect you first thing in the morning and bring you back here for some... Company onboarding. Try and get some sleep.”
"Good, I'm glad you like it," Castiel murmured, pressing a gentle kiss into Dean's hair. It felt good. “What did you have for breakfast?”
“I wasn’t sure if you were joking, so I did.” Cas said, despite his only packing the two shirts he liked and a change of pants.
"Cas, I--” He can't quite say it, blushing as he runs his fingers over each pair with reverence. He loves getting nailed six ways from Sunday, but the panties are still a bump in the road for him.
“I want these raggedy pants off,” his Boss said, and Dean was quick to oblige him, shucking his pajama pants over his hips and down his legs, losing them somewhere in the blankets.
“Here you go,” came a voice from beside them, a young blonde girl with a white apron around her waist. She handed Ash a beer, her fingers marred the condensation on the glass.
Dean’s chest was like silk under his fingertips, smooth and soft to the touch, skin draped over layers of hard muscle. He needed to know if his shoulders were the same, his back, his legs. Dean’s body was heaven in his hands and he rejoiced as he partook.
Dean did as he was bid, shifting onto his stomach so that Daddy could look at his red and stinging cheeks, his erection waning from lack of stimulation. The couch was comfortable. There was a fluffy cushion under his head, and soon he was drifting off.
“Okay Daddy,” he replied, lazily opening his eyes to watch as the thong was pulled down to the middle of his thighs, his hard cock finally released from it’s confines, standing at full attention.
Dean stuck to the backroads like the last strong stitch keeping a seam together. They were on the cusp of a national park, so he sometimes had no choice but to grace the highways with his presence, because backroads were notorious for not having any signs of civilization - which included gas stations. He had head out of town as fast as his baby could carry him, and it ate up a lot of gas. He’d stopped in Sheridan for his own fuel requirements, because he didn’t really trust the black strips of leather that Ash affectionately called ‘Jerky’.
"Fuck,” he replied eloquently. Dean eased him back onto the bed, separating them for a moment so they could lay back on the pillows, instead of half-hanging off the edge.
Daddy looked up at him, raising an eyebrow, but Dean just smiled innocently, knowing what his Daddy wanted but not giving it to him. He relented before long, the need for more overwhelming the desire to tease. He tucked the band of his panties behind his sac and got to work, stroking his cock in one hand while rolling his balls with the other.
After he graduated from High School, Ash got him the night shift at the diner. He liked it there, as much as anyone could like working at a diner in a small town. Castiel sometimes worked days, but the place always felt different then. He liked it better at night when it was just him and Ash, making burgers for anyone coming through town. Mostly they just talked while Ash smoked joints out the kitchen window, or sometimes they’d play chess or cards or buy fries all night, just for something to do. Once, when Ash had talked Castiel into joining him at the window, they got stupidly high and ate everything in the dessert cabinet. In the morning Ash told their boss a bear did it. Their boss gave them both a warning.
“Mm, not too much for my good boy,” Cas says, kissing along Dean’s jaw, “Plus, they’re not entirely selfless,” He adds.
“Put these on,” his Boss said, handing him a pair of noise cancelling earmuffs and a sleeping mask that was a soft baby pink. It said ‘Princess’ on the front in gold cursive lettering.
They tried to keep kissing, but soon the movement was too much and all they could do was pant against each other’s mouths as Daddy rocked their hips together. Dean was moaning, already half out of his mind with pleasure, daddy’s cock hard and leaking against his own, sliding sweetly together in the tight space between them. He clung to Daddy, meeting every thrust as best he could, looking up at him through half lidded eyes, fighting hard to stay present and not lose himself in feeling.
“That’s not how you speak to Daddy,” he said, his voice low and dangerous as he gripped Dean’s jaw again, tighter this time, “Try again. You can do what I ask of you, can’t you Dean?”
He started fucking into his fist in earnest, the pleasure really building now, looking down at his boss from under hooded lids, his lips open as he panted a little.
“Who’s askin’?” Dean answered, polishing a glass as he squared his shoulders, ready to stare the guy down if need be.
“No, really,” Castiel said, twisting in his seat to look at his friend, “When he came in, I heard him growling, and he had all these teeth, like he was half shark.”
“I’m sorry to leave you,” Castiel said, pressing a kiss to Dean’s lips, “I’d much rather be here. I wanted to take you upstairs to my living quarters, keep you all to myself.” He sighed, leaning in to kiss Dean again, deep and slow.
Dean thought back to the previous night, blushing when he remembered the way his new Boss had watched him touch himself. He felt weird about it, and felt even weirder that his dick was onboard with the idea of seeing his new boss again today.
Another sharp slap rang out, piercing the stillness of the room, and Dean gasped again. Daddy was not pulling his punches, not in the slightest. Another blow came, and Dean lurched forward, clinging onto the table for dear life, his cock trapped between his body and the wood beneath him.
"Yeah," Dean said, his body thrumming at the close contact, knowing that he shouldn’t relax around this man but wanting to anyway, "that bathroom is amazing, I was in there for hours."
“Uh, all the rules are rule number one, because you cannot rank the importance of them.” Dean said, attempting to save face.
Dean followed, lifting up the soft covers and sliding beneath them, scooting closer to the middle of the bed as his boss pulled him in. A strong hand slid up under his t-shirt, and Dean helped to tug it off over his head, tossed somewhere behind him.
All he got for his troubles was his Boss’ thick cock back in his mouth, thrusting into him hard as he tried to keep up. It was only a few minutes until he could hear ragged breathing above him, the rhythm growing erratic as his Boss slowed to a stop, fucking in deep one last time and coming, splattering against the roof of Dean’s mouth.
“Oh? You've been thinking about what I might like?” Daddy asked, his thumbs rubbing soothing circles against Dean’s sides.
The clock behind the counter told him it was twenty to one, and he rolled his shoulders as he approached it. The cashier pushed a laminated menu towards him, and he didn’t touch it because he’d already seen the words “burger” and “bacon” and no longer had any use for a menu.
“Are you being a tease?” his Daddy asked, pinning him with a firm look, his eyes piercing right through Dean.
Daddy shifted off him slightly, and Dean heard the clink of his belt being undone. He tried to roll over, but Daddy placed a firm hand between his shoulder blades, holding him in place on his stomach. He lifted his hips up slightly to help Daddy slide the shorts down, but they stopped at mid thigh, keeping his legs tight together. The thong stayed on.
Before he could think too much about it, the lights were switched off and Daddy was back in bed with him, pulling Dean close until they were spooned together, Daddy’s warm breath against his nape and one arm slung around his waist.
“That’s—” Dean frowned, thinking for a moment, “That’s a fancy word for sex work. You want me to find you a courtesan?”
Cas took his time, like he said he would, pushing Dean’s shirt from his shoulders as they kissed. The tension built but it wasn’t urgent. They didn’t have anywhere to be, except right where they were.
“Isaiah wasn’t here to serve your meals?” Castiel asked, his brows raised in surprise. It was an interesting look, Dean decided, on the face of a man who seemed to have everything in control all of the time.
“I should think so,” Cas replies sleepily, watching Dean disappear into the bathroom to soak his panties, “We should have a nap.”
Dean made himself a coffee, and rummaged through the cupboards while he waited for it to cool. The place was stocked with snack foods; mostly pretzels and salted nuts, but Dean grabbed an armload and headed back to his powder room, deciding to hole up in there until Castiel showed up.
“Stop. Now,” Daddy continued, standing up, the heat of his body so close to Dean but not close enough, “I’ve seen all I needed to see. Get dressed please.”
It was just after four when Dean finally heard movement, the heavy front doors opening and then clicking shut.
Dean watched as Castiel nursed his drink, eyes closed and his head tipped back, letting out an occasional noise when Dean found a knot. He worked until his hands ached, and then kept going.
“Will I be allowed my phone? I need to be available to my brother, just in case,” Dean explained, hoping that his Boss would be merciful after his little outburst.
Dean was on his feet almost instantly, hoping to put his boss in a much better mood. Castiel took him by the hips, pushing with gentle firmness until Dean stood directly in front of him. He looked up at Dean, making eye contact as he undid the soft belt of Dean’s short robe, letting it fall open. Dean shrugged it off his shoulders, and it pooled at his feet, leaving his chest bare. Castiel’s eyes flicked back down, to the peach silk of his athletic shorts that shined under the soft lighting of the living room.
Dean hesitated before approaching the table. He’d never been waxed before. Was she going to wax all of him, his chest, his legs? Or was this full brazillian territory? His cheeks burned as he imagined it. He’d been with girls before who were bare, and the soft smoothness had been nice against his own skin, his lips. He tried not to think about his new Boss’s mouth near his genitals as he climbed clumsily onto the table.
Hannah pushed the buzzer on the intercom, just to the right of the doors, and waited for a response. There was an audible sound as the lock tumbled, and Hannah pushed one of the doors open.
They were across the road from a cemetery. Everything about it felt upper-middle-class, right down to the perfectly manicured flower-beds and the clean wrought-iron fence. They walked quietly, along the winding paths of the graveyard towards a square stone building. It seemed to rise out of the ground like a natural feature, surrounded by mist. On paper, it was stereotypical, but the unease Cas felt was genuine and real.
“This is Helen, she’ll be taking care of your grooming today,” Hannah said, handing him off to a bored-looking middle aged woman in a pink apron.
There were footsteps and then the door shut again. Suddenly Dean was pulled bodily up the bed, out from under the covers, the fingers digging into his neck so hard that they were likely to leave a mark.
He only noticed that he was hard when his dick started sliding through a puddle of pre-come that must have dribbled out at some point. And fuck, this was kind of hot, wasn’t it?
Dean believed the line John fed him, time and time again, telling himself that a new beginning with a fresh perspective might be enough to calm John’s nerves, to help him settle and want to be a father to his adult sons. He knew John was a drifter and a dead-beat but still, his stomach soured every time John proved him right.
“Yes,” the man replied, looking at Dean so intently that a shiver went down his spine, “I do have an... opening, of sorts. A position within my personal staff that I would very much like to fill.”
Dean nodded, fully committed to the task of making his boss feel better. He watched as his boss moved away from him, beginning to get undressed. First his shirt, then his pants, off and into a hamper by the door to what Dean assumed was an ensuite. He itched with the need to get his hands on the miles of tan skin that was newly exposed. His boss was kinda stacked, Dean realized; sturdy shoulders and thick thighs, broad chested with muscular arms. He couldn’t look away.
Cas eats him out until he’s dripping with it, thighs tense against Cas’s hair, feeling loose and open as that magic tongue flicks in and out of him.
His grip tightened, vice-like, around his Boss’ ankles. He felt a hand on his shoulder, the warmth of his Boss’ palm pressed into his skin. Meant to soothe him, to help him settle.
“Yes, that’s generally how it works here,” the man said. His gaze was piercing and Dean had to focus on breathing to make sure he kept doing it right.
He got home by six, his apartment cold and empty. Dean sighed, deciding to have a hot shower before parking himself in front of the T.V. for the rest of the evening.
Then Dean felt fingers on his nose, pinching him, and suddenly he couldn’t breathe. He couldn’t pull his head back, and when he tried to open his mouth wider, his Boss would just push in more, filling him up, cock nudging at his throat.
“I think we have a case up in Ohio, if you’re interested,” Dean said, “I was thinking we could leave after breakfast.”
“So’s your situation, but what’re you gonna do.” Dean said, ignoring the light punches on the back of his seat.
“How long? Will you stay, I mean,” Dean asked him, his eyes hopeful as he watched Cas, “Just so I have an idea...”
“I have to make a few phone calls, take care of a few things,” Castiel said, standing up and straightening his suit jacket, “I’m sure you can keep yourself amused for a while.”
He feels it coming, the way Dean tightens around him, his back flexing and bunching, and then he comes, a guttural groan leaving his mouth as his body clenches. Cas tips them over, laying down on their sides while he’s still hard and in Dean’s ass, rolling his hips gently, just to keep the movement going.
Dean didn’t look in his pocket until he got home, over an hour later. He pulled out the little roll of cash, to see what he’d made that day—five crisp bills, all benjamins. He was stunned. Numb. He had no idea what to feel. Deciding to worry about it in the morning, he put the bills with the rest of his cash, and got ready for bed.
“You’re in no place to judge.” Castiel said, feigning severity as he levelled his gaze in Dean’s direction.
“Well, we just have to go to the tailors, and then we can go back to the office,” Hannah said as they stepped into the foyer. Dean watched through the window as Thick-neck appeared, right on time.
“I can’t—I’m not going to hurt anyone. Please,” he said, hoping he didn’t sound like he was begging, “There’s got to be another option. Like a janitor, or a receptionist or something. You got a bar? I’m a great bartender.”
“Are you fucking kidding me?” Dean said, “You got me fired from my job because your goons hauled me away in the middle of a shift. You’re threatening me and my little brother. You send me to get my asshole waxed instead of spending all this time and money and manpower on finding the person who actually took out the loan in the first place. This is your fault, and it sure as hell is your problem.”
“I make no money. My side jobs are hustling pool and scamming credit card companies.” Dean said, his smile fading as he fiddled with the corner of a napkin.
Finally, Dean reached inside his panties, fondling his dick, stroking it slowly with a loose fist, trying to keep it out of sight.
Dean grit his teeth. This wasn’t going to end well. He advanced on the monster, who was knocking over anything he could reach, pushing the woman at the counter off her stool, getting as many things between itself and Dean as it could. Satisfied, it turned to run - straight into the cashier, who was now in front of the counter
“Honey, if we start now, we’ll never stop,” Cas says, and he presses a kiss to Dean’s cheek before moving away.
He lays there, warm and safe under the weight of Cas’s body, and they kiss unhurriedly, hot and wet, open mouthed, as slow as the roll of their hips against each other.
“Like you said, murders that could be suicides, people lured into the woods. I went to check it out, and I swore I heard-” Dean swallowed, thickly, “My, uh, my mom.”
“Well I wouldn’t want to spoil your lovely skin, and I’m not sure that I could look without touching right now. I’ll just have to unwrap you next time, like a present.”
First, came the underwear. Dean hesitated, not sure which pair Castiel might like best. He settled on something new, hoping his boss would appreciate his daring, easing the soft white lace of a thong up his legs and into place, frills adorning the front and hips, and coming to rest between his cheeks. Dean hoped it looked as good as it felt.
“Alright,” he heard the Boss say, walking back into the room, “You can get up now, I don’t want you getting all cramped up.”
“I heard, uh,” Dean swallowed hard, “Maybe a nickname, I don’t know. You called him Gabriel,” he finished weakly.
Getting colder, Dean grabbed the discarded shorts, and went to his powder room. The come was now sticky and gross against his skin, and peeling off the thong was the worst of it. He dropped it into the empty hamper, pitying whoever was going to have to deal with the mess they’d made.
“Yeah, yeah. You’ll be thanking me when you’re stuck somewhere with nothing but lead to help you out. Can Ash shoot?”
“Only if you show me a good time.” Castiel said, pushing his foot lightly into the back of the driver’s-side seat.
He’d waited in the dining room for an hour, hoping not only for his boss to arrive, but for breakfast to appear. He hadn’t had a chance to eat the night before, and by now he was starving.
Cradled in a valley and watched over by mountain peaks, the town was small and quiet - and apparently full. Dean saw no motel, and the one Bed and Breakfast boasted a single bed, and wasn’t open at one in the morning anyway. He thought of finding another motel, but his eyelids felt too heavy to stay open for the fifteen minute drive back to the last town he saw. Dean headed out to the trees at the other end of town, parking beneath them to sleep in his backseat - he would work the case in the morning, there was nothing to be done now.
“I fucking hate this, and we didn’t even see a ghost,” Ash said, his face screwed up—probably because of the smell, Cas thought. The kid they torched had been dead for a little over a decade, but the stink of burning remains was awful no matter how old the body, Dean assured them.
First he checked the dining room, wanting to see if there was anyone there. Then he wandered around. The place was huge. There were multiple bedrooms, a library, another spacious lounge, a huge board room with a long table and a dozen chairs. Finally, tucked away between a smaller meeting room and a spacious bathroom, he found a kitchenette. It was more like a break area in an office than a kitchen, with only a microwave to cook anything in, and a fridge filled with bottled water and champagne.
Hands were on him again, spreading his ass apart, and then he felt soft gentle kisses along his crack, the smoothness of his freshly waxed skin enhancing every touch.
It kept him from going into an all-out panic, the calming weight of it against his skin. He focused on the feel of it as he heard the faint sounds of voices, people talking. His Boss was having a meeting it seemed.
“Well, I guess I’d better try and win you back then, huh?” Cas asks, settling down on the sofa next to Dean.
Dean had seen Castiel examining the different cards, and offered to get them their own FBI badges. Ash had voiced his approval, while Castiel smiled wryly, suggesting that they wait and see if they’d escaped successfully before creating more incriminating evidence against themselves.
It felt good, Dean thought, to get back into the swing of things. Dust swirled around him, up into the sky in it’s best rendition of a cloud as he drove down a dirt track to a beat-up farm house. He’d stopped off first at the police station, fifteen minutes down the highway from where he’d left his companions to sleep. They weren’t used to life on the road. He empathized.
“Thanks,” Dean replied, eyeing the bottle. It was an expensive one, they’d sold it at a hipster bar he used to work at in Kansas. He’d never bothered spending the extra money, but he knew they were nice.
He holds Dean like this, in his arms, working him until Dean’s dripping again, and then he pulls out.
“My apologies about today, it won’t happen again,” she said, hands clasped behind her back, meeting his eye with the kind of intensity of someone who prides themselves on their work.
“Jerk yourself off,” Daddy said, his voice low and commanding, rough from what Dean hoped was desire.
“We looked him up, little Sam. Scholarship to University of Chicago, that’s pretty impressive. Would be a shame if he had to drop out due to financial hardship. Or smashed knee-caps,” the thug stood straight again, “I’m kidding, we don’t do that anymore. Much.”
“Okay,” she said, finally looking up once they were standing in the middle of the foyer, “I can’t give you a full tour right now because I have a few things to do, but go ahead and take a quick look at your personal rooms before the Boss gets here.”
The thug considered him for a moment, before resting his forearms on the bar, leaning in to speak quietly as though they were co-conspirators, or old friends. Dean noticed how thick his neck was, the same width as his head. It was weird.
“You want your pretty new knickers?” Cas says, “Pick out a pair to wear, and then hurry up and get on the bed.”
Cas directs him on what seems to be an increasingly random route around the city, all while rubbing slowly at the bulge in Dean’s jeans.
Dean’s incoherent by this point, groaning whenever Cas hits his prostate, shoving back against his thrusts.
Hannah just spread her hands in front of her, as if to say that was exactly what they wanted from him. She was still smiling.
He pointedly kicked Dean’s lounge pants to the side, before leading him out of the room with one hand still holding tight to the back of his neck. Dean felt exposed, walking through the apartment in a pair of women’s panties with a raging erection, but it wasn’t like anyone was going to see him, he supposed.
“No diapers,” he said gently, taking Dean’s chin in his hand and carefully studying his face, “It’s just a title. A way to uphold the dynamic between us, you being subservient to me, doing what I ask of you. You can do that, can’t you?”
There was a cushioned area to rest his chest against, and padding for his knees. It made sense then, he realized, his head was bound to be right in the Boss’s lap once he was sitting at the desk properly.
A guy with a mullet, who Dean presumed to be Ash, came through from the kitchen, a joint in his hand.
Dean slumps down in his seat, grumpy about his hard dick, and his stupid boyfriend denying him orgasms on his birthday. What an asshole.
“Your father makes you call him Sir?” he asked, sitting down next to Dean, not leaving much room between them.
Instead he spent a long time alone, exfoliating and cleansing and washing his hair until it was soft and silky. It felt luxurious, and Dean couldn’t help but love it.
Dean was glad his panties were covering his dick as he felt more precome drool from the tip. It had got him into enough trouble as it was. His own breathing felt ragged as he moved his face, his mouth brushing the streak of semen, letting it smear across his lips before he started licking it up in earnest. It was salty and cooling off, which made him work quickly, wanting to get it while it was hot, as it were.
“Bye Daddy,” Dean said, turning to leave. He was all mixed up. Couldn’t tell if he was angry or not, or if he was supposed to be.
Dean was hoping they would go straight home, but Cas instructs him to drive in the opposite direction.
He was pulled from his thoughts as the Rolls took a sharp corner, pulling up at a nondescript parking garage.
It was a rickety booth, at the back of a diner on the outskirts of Amarillo, Texas.They’d gone the long way out of Santa Fe, because Ash had been determined to see a town called Las Vegas that was
Dean wasn’t sure why it caught him so off-guard, the whole point of this arrangement was the idea that they’d be having sex. That this man, his new boss, Daddy, would be seeing him naked.
“Tell me what you liked,” Daddy murmured, his voice low and a little threatening against Dean’s ear. One of his hands lay gently in Dean’s lap, right over his erection.
“Don’t say it.” Castiel said in a low voice, glancing momentarily at Dean, who threw his head back in laughter.
Dean’s face flushed as he slid the eye mask on, securing the elastic behind his head. Once he added the ear muffs, he couldn’t see a damn thing, and the only sound was a gentle ringing in his ears, probably from a decade or two of turning his music up too loud.
“So you cats are free to hit the road, if you like. I can get you some new identities. I’m heading down to Santa Fe to see a man about a Chupacabra. You’re both welcome to tag along, if you got nothing better to do.”
“Everyone makes mistakes,” Dean said, trying not to sound like he was pleading, even though he was, “You said today was difficult. It’s like my fourth day here, so I’m probably the last thing on anyone’s mind.”
“You see Dean,” the guy said, “It’s very much your problem, because my boss wants what he’s owed. And if you refuse to take ownership, to be a man and deal with your responsibilities, we can make this your brother’s problem.”
“Alright,” He continued, “You beauties want to see the sights of Santa Fe, or should we do a little study session on the Chupacabra?”
“Bye Bobby.” Dean flipped his phone shut and threw it in the backseat, narrowly missing Ash’s kneecap.
It wasn’t until he was in the bathroom, easing the soft panties down over his aching ass, that he noticed the bills. Three crisp benjamins fluttered to the floor, laying innocuously on his ratty, stained bath mat.
“You’re very good at your job, so far,” Daddy said, laughing a little, “But I agree, I think it’s time to discipline you again. I’m too busy to be dealing with a brat.”
Dean took his place, tentatively glancing over his shoulder to make sure he was doing it right, before lowering his chest down against the wood in front of him, braced a little on his forearms, his ass basically in his Boss’ face.
Daddy sighed against Dean’s mouth, kissing him one last time before getting up and checking his message.
“You smell incredible,” Castiel murmured against his ear, breathing in all the scents of Dean’s indulgent spa morning.
He hoped that his boss wasn’t into being watched. Or, he thought as his blood ran cold, his Boss might want to share him. Dean was a private person, he couldn’t imagine how he might feel if he was forced to suck dick in a room full of people. Or suck the dicks of a room full of people.
Dean moves like lightening, face buried in the covers with his ass up before Cas can even move, the sheer fabric of his panties cradling his heavy, leaking cock, beds of precome shimmering through the soft material.
Dean moaned, unable to say anything, hands moving to clutch at his Boss’ thighs as if to beg for what he wanted.
It was dead quiet, the newspaper and the smooth jazz long-since abandoned. Dean could hear his own breathing, his heartbeat, both loud inside his body. He felt his boss, nudging his legs wider with one knee. He felt warm skin along his lower back, and then his lounge pants were tugged down over his butt in one swift movement.
They were just in the process of stuffing him into a dressing room with some sample suits to try on, when the bell above the front door chimed.
It's important to note that this isn't a roadmap for healthy and safe BDSM, it's a fantasy where things are a bit dangerous and risky. Please do not be this cavalier about BDSM in real life! Technically Dean is coerced into this position so the entire fic is dub-con at best so if that's not your cup of tea, then please be careful reading this. :)
“I want to try one of these,” Cas says, walking over to the pile of gifts, “Did you have anything in mind? The clamps perhaps? Or maybe the vibrator?”
“Pardon?” Dean managed, finally, after a good few seconds spent staring at the man with his mouth agape.
“Really?” Daddy said, “Well then, I think my lovely boy deserves a reward for being such a quick learner.”
Ash met them in the middle, chucking the bags he carried in the back, before diving in after them. Castiel slid down in his seat, panic building under the stiff polyester of his diner shirt.
“Good boy,” his Boss said as he climbed into position, “A few rules. Don’t make any noise, I need peace and quiet. Try not to move. I don’t need you to blow me, I’ll let you know when it’s time for that. If you need the bathroom or something, you can tap my leg three times and I’ll let you up if we’re alone."
Bobby had yawned through the phone and assured him that all he needed to do was stab the thing in the back of the neck. It was proving a lot harder than it sounded. He’d managed to find it, wearing the skin of some poor guy from town. Dean thought he’d seen him outside the police station at some point.
He wasn’t sure how long it was before the car slowed and finally came to a stop. His footsteps echoed, so he must have been in some kind of garage. The goon wasn’t very helpful as he led Dean through a series of hallways and stumbling up a set of stairs before shoving him into a room.
The tension in Dean’s body was unreal, he felt like he was on a precipice and the man was asking him to jump.
“For you,” Dean replied, blushing at his own words, and then ever harder once Castiel kissed him, a chaste press of lips.
He looked down between their bodies, to see Dean’s length moving alongside his own. He took a moment to commit it to memory, sure in the knowledge that it was the most erotic thing he’d ever seen.
“These are lovely on you,” Castiel murmured, fingers caressing the fabric at Dean’s hips and slipping up under the hem to feel the equally soft skin.
“I didn’t tell you to stop,” Daddy said, and Dean did as he was told, jerking off as quickly as possible, desperate to finish before things escalated.
His body still pulsed with adrenaline, and the intensity of the looked he leveled at Ash was ramped up to eleven.
He left that for later, instead choosing to open the other door off the powder room, pushing it open to reveal what was probably the most luxurious bathroom he’d ever seen in his life. He could tell it was expensive, because the tile on the floor was so small and white, shaped like little hexagons.
Castiel often wanted to ask what a guy like Ash was doing in Wilson, but he always thought better of it. Probably because Ash had never asked him the same. It just seemed strange that someone who knew so much about physics and how to build supercomputers would want to spend so much time in a mouldy house under the shadow of a mountain. But then, Castiel knew that people thought similar things about himself - he put it down to his being vastly well read.
“Yes,” Hannah replied, “It’s an area just for you, a place to go when the Boss is busy and you need some downtime.”
He brought one of Dean’s hands up to his mouth, pressing soft, warm lips against Dean’s knuckles, before he slipped back through the curtain. Dean stood there, half dressed and stunned, until he heard the bell above the front door tinkle again. He slowly pulled on his dress shirt, unsure of what in the hell just happened.
Dean wandered back to his rooms, feeling a little dazed as he got dressed again, swapping the expensive new t-shirt for his old, thread-bare one.
They walked off into the night, in the opposite direction of the woods, cigarette smoke trailing behind them. Wilson was still at three in the morning, and Castiel liked it best that way.
Dean was right, as it turned out, he was getting a physical. And a full STD panel, which he felt stupid for not piecing together until the moment the doctor had his dick in hand.
Dean blushed again, a thrill going through him at the thought that he’d done well. He wanted Daddy to be pleased with him, to be happy with what he did.
The shorts were still hooked around one ankle, and Daddy helped to pull them back into place. Dean was just tying the belt on the robe when there was a knock at the front door, a pause, and then the sound of someone turning the knob.
Dean hesitated, wanting to change out of his pajamas, but knowing very well what would happen if ‘Boss’s orders’ weren’t followed.
“Hmm,” he heard from behind him, “These were a safe choice. Pretty, obviously. But safe all the same.” The waistband of his panties was pulled on and then snapped back against his skin, emphasising the point.
The cashier ambled over then, standing above them silently with a notepad. Dean coughed, motioning for Cas to go first. They gave their orders to a blank stare of a man, and then sat in awkward silence as he shuffled off again.
By ten o’clock the next day, Dean had checked into the only room at the Bed and Breakfast and talked his way into the town’s police station. He spoke with the Sheriff about the bodies that had been found in the woods, realizing that he’d probably slept near whatever this thing was, if there was a thing at all.
Once inside, they found the right name plate, and Dean carefully removed the cover. Sliding the coffin out to open it was a struggle, but Dean moved like he’d done it before, which, Cas imagined, he probably had. The whole thing felt ceremonious, even though it wasn’t.
The sun had just begun to set as they pulled up to the same office building as the previous night. Even with the fading light of a winter afternoon, Dean could now see the small discreet signage outside the parking garage. Genesis Enterprises. That’s what Thick-neck had said too, at the bar. He made a note to look it up later, when he got home.
Dean stayed like that for longer than he could guess, thumbs rubbing idle circles on his Boss’ thick calves. Then a deep noise cut through the silence, like a door closing. He felt the vibrations of foot steps across the floor. And then more movement, he wasn’t sure what.
Underwear. Women’s underwear. Silk and lace and satin, all colours and cuts. They were in his wardrobe, so they must be for him. He opened all the other drawers as quickly as he could, but the panties were the only underwear he could find. It was them or nothing.
“Yes, but I don’t see how doing all the things we usually do but in a tent will make them any more exciting.”
“Well, look at you,” his Boss said, stepping closer and fondling the obvious bulge in Dean’s lounge-pants, “Been enjoying yourself?”
He leaned in, pausing once to make sure Dean knew what was about to happen. Their noses touched, brushing gently together, and then their lips touched, in much the same way. He pressed deeper, wanting to feel Dean’s mouth against his. Dean’s fingers gripped tighter at his waist, pulling him closer, until they were chest to chest, kissing at the end of Cas’s bed.
This man—his boss, Castiel, stared at him in silence. Dean could practically hear the cogs turning in his head. Dean felt himself yanked up off the bed, held by the throat at his boss’ eye level.
“Shh,” Daddy said, laying down on top of him, taking the proffered hand in his own, “You’re doing so good, you’re perfect.”
They all behaved the same, too. Ushering him into a black SUV and ignoring him for the entire drive to Chicago. Hannah met him at the elevator, leading him in and pushing the button for the forty-ninth floor. She was on her phone again, tapping furiously at the screen as she blindly led Dean down the hall and through the Door’s of their boss’s residence.
He made sure to cover every part of Dean’s chest, collecting every stray drop on his tongue, before he moved up to kiss Dean, their lips brushing slightly before Daddy pushed a sloppy load of Dean’s come into his own mouth. They made out, pressed against the desk and snowballing his spend back and forward between them in the filthiest kiss Dean had had in a long, long time. If he hadn’t just jizzed all over himself, this alone would have got him harder than diamonds.
It wasn’t what Dean expected, but then he supposed he wasn’t really sure what crime lords were supposed to eat for breakfast.
“Dean,” he said, his hand resting on the canvas of his bag as though to steady him, “Do you like men?”
Dean settled back into his seat and stared glumly out the window, watching the people on the street as they drove past. It was annoying not knowing what was going on, but in the long run it was better than smashed kneecaps. And an unexpected perk was getting to see a doctor for free, that was pretty great.
“That’s not how the law works,” Dean said weakly, desperately trying to make the man across from him see sense.
Dean laughs, turning back to the gift pile. He unwraps some nipple clamps, a set of butt plugs, a new paddle, a cock ring engraved with ‘Pretty Boy’, and a fairly hefty vibrator.
“Oh, fuck,” Dean moaned, as his boss started rolling their hips together, creating a slow but steady rhythm.
“What d’you say, fancy a trip to Rapid City?” Dean said to Castiel, his voice light despite the mood in the car.
Eventually he heard the door open and close again; felt a presence in the room with him. He sat up straighter, hoping it was his boss coming to put him to good use.
“Look. I ain’t talked to your daddy since nineteen ninety-nine, but if you need him to come hunt with you again, I’m, uh... I’m sure I could persuade him.”
Dean kept moving, his hips pushing him into Cas’s fist, while Cas stroked them both. It felt surreal. Nothing had ever felt this good, he was sure of it.
“This is exactly why I bought these ones,” Cas says, before going back in, this time licking at Dean’s entrance, swirling his tongue across the muscle.
“No,” Dean said, his voice small, “I just meant, you know, yesterday you said this wasn’t a weird baby thing, but it sure feels like it might be.”
I got a little carried away describing Dean's powder room area, so feel free to skip the first little bit if you aren't at all interested lmao. No hard feelings!
Dean felt his cheeks flame as he stuck his tongue out, licking through the puddle on the table-top, licking at the wood in earnest, lapping up every drop until the only thing left was his spit.
“Come on, time to get up Castiel,” came the voice again, and Dean felt his boss—Castiel, grumble and shift, rolling away from him.
The apartment they entered must have been the most expensive place Dean had ever been. Shiny floors with marble tile, expensive looking rugs, art on every wall. The chandelier above him glittered like it very well might be made of diamonds. Dean was so busy watching light sparkle off of it, he didn’t notice the other man in the room until he spoke.
On what he thought it was a regular Friday evening, Castiel began what was to be his last shift at the diner. When he started at seven, it was already getting a bit dark, and Ash had a case of beer in the fridge out back for when it got to be two in the morning and everyone in Wilson but the both of them were safe in their beds.
“Thank you,” Castiel said, chuckling, “It has been said in the past that were it not for Ash’s fry-cooking abilities, he would have been fired a long time ago.”
“In here,” Helen said, opening a plain white door to a small room with what looked like a kind of massage table. The space was filled with the overwhelming scent of lavender, and Dean felt like he might choke on it.
Dean got up abruptly, overwhelmed with the urge to brush his teeth, his tongue, any part of him that had willingly and eagerly come in contact with that maniac’s jizz. His cheeks burned with shame, even though he was alone in his bathroom, and no one knew what he’d done.
Dean’s stomach fluttered, his dick fully hard now as his mind raced ahead of him, imagining Daddy dragging him to the bedroom and dealing to him—would he have to kneel on the bed? The floor? Maybe he’d have to bend over again, and hold posture. Maybe Daddy would tie him up and take to him with a paddle. Maybe he’d do it right here on the couch. Anything, Dean would take any of them.
“Come here,” his Boss said, sitting in his big chair and pulling Dean down with him, until he was sitting neatly in his lap. He held Dean close, leaving a soft kiss or two on the side of his neck.
They barely moved to begin with, a miniscule roll of Dean’s hips against his, unhurried and unstrenuous. Cas bent one of his legs, his foot anchored in the sheets, trying to make it easier for Dean to balance and get a rhythm going.
Now, though. Sunshine streamed in through the windows, and Cas could see the dust-motes in the air. He felt Dean shift against him, gentle movements that indicated he was awake.
He looked at Cas again, who was burning a hole in the side of his head. He’d acted pretty quickly under pressure, seeing razor teeth and still jumping willingly into the fray. Dean felt vaguely impressed.
“Sure, but usually they’re self employed and can set their own rates. You’re paying back a debt, and therefore work at the rate that I set for you.”
“Legs spread,” Helen ordered, pushing her little cart and a spinning stool over to the table. She sat down at the end, looking expectantly between Dean’s still-shut legs.
Castiel decided to put up rather than shut up, rolling his eyes as the spikes of Ash’s mullet dug into his neck.
He rolled into bed, tired and worn down, wanting to just sleep off the day and the wave of shame he’d felt when he found his day’s “tips”.
“Look at that, man,” He said loudly, walking back to the car after retrieving the can, “Shot through the heart.”
“Puns are no help in effectively escaping police attention,” Castiel said, his tongue firmly in his cheek.
He spent most of the drive lost in thought, staring out the window as he wondered what the boss could want with him. It probably wasn’t anything bad, he figured, and as much as he wanted to be annoyed by the idea of driving an hour to give a blowjob, he found he couldn’t be. If anything, the idea excited him, that he could just be summoned from wherever on a whim, because his boss wanted to use his body for pleasure.
Cas grabs his chin, kissing him fiercely as he picks up the pace, fucking into Dean roughly. Dean breaks the kiss, gasping.
“Well,” Dean said, hoping to sound casual, “I hope you don’t owe anyone money, you’d make a terrible courtesan.”
“My apologies for the wait,” Hannah said, carrying a large silver tray in one hand—the kind with the big round lid on top. Dean had only ever seen those in the movies.
“I only ask, because I like men,” Cas carried on, wanting to break the silence, to make this as easy as possible.
Dean looked away, his gaze drifting to the city beyond the huge windows. He needed a moment to think. It wasn’t like this man was ugly. Unless he was into some weird kinky shit, Dean could do a lot worse than fucking this guy on the daily.
He shoved the change back across the counter, unaware that his fingers were on the only money that Dean Winchester had to hold to his name.
“I’m sure you understand that I value my privacy, Dean,” he started, “You may have your phone on, and charged, but you will only be permitted to use it to check and reply to any messages from your brother at set intervals throughout the day. You will be supervised. Keep the sound on, and you can answer your brother if he calls. Otherwise, the phone is off-limits.”
“Here you go,” she said as she placed the tray on the ottoman in front of Dean, along with a cold bottle of beer, “I wasn’t sure what brand you liked, so I just picked something popular.”
Dean closed his eyes, moaning as Castiel pressed firm, wet kisses against his lace-covered dick, almost more than he could bear.
Dean was still hungry, and although it had been easy enough to ignore up to a point, he decided it was time to do something about it. He left the bathroom to get dressed so he wasn’t wandering around in a bathrobe. The real question though, was what to wear. He wasn’t sure if his boss was still mad about that morning, so he tried to put together an outfit that might help distract him.
“Sure,” Castiel said, “In that case, another rule number one is to always be well rested in order to kick ass and take names, alright? So go lie down before you get any more sleep deprived.”
“Fair enough,” the man replied, still smiling, “If you feel unsafe, you may say ‘safe word’. But, please do bear in mind, if you use the safeword constantly to get out of every single thing I ask of you, I’ll have to send you back to Hannah for reassignment.”
“Yeah,” Dean replied, taking Cas’s hand in his and twining their fingers together, “I was hoping you would.”
“Dean!” Castiel called, crawling over to where the beast lay dead, “Are you okay, did I shoot you by accident?”
“I could organize a time-out,” his boss said, musing it over, “But it would be slightly different than what you’re probably thinking.
“Also,” Dean started, “Speaking of bacon-cheese, the burger you made that night was amazing. Like, easily in the top five.”
“And you’ve forgotten to address me properly all but once, so we’re going to have to do something about that.”
“Of course,” Dean said, heading over to the drink cart, filled with crystal decanters and sleek glasses.
He felt hungry, unable to stop himself as he reached out, pulling Dean to him by his flannel. The space lessened to an inch or two and Cas wanted to devour him.
Dean watched as she pulled out her phone and took a photo of him. He blinked his eyes, trying to get rid of the shadow in his vision that the flash had left behind. Hannah was typing something, her thumbs moving at lightning speed, her entire focus on the screen as it lit up her face.
“Hello to you too,” came the voice on the other end of the line. It was his boss—his other one, from the bar.
He thought about how Bobby was wrong, and that it made no difference to him if the car was empty or not, that silence was inevitable in the dead of night, no matter how many souls were around.
“I’ll see you tomorrow,” he said, fiddling with the waist of Dean’s jeans, like he couldn’t decide if he wanted to cop one last feel.
“I want you to be my courtesan,” he said, calm as anything, as though those words didn’t bring Dean’s brain to a crashing halt.
“Dean,” she said, smiling politely as though he hadn’t been hauled here in the middle of the night against his will, “My name is Hannah, I’m here to discuss your small debt problem.”
“So... I’m sucking dick for eight twenty-five an hour?” Dean asked, not quite believing what he was hearing.
“Perfectly fine. Once the laminate cools it will be pretty hard to tell just by lookin’ that this ain’t the real deal.”
“See anything you like?” Dean asked quietly, picking up the pace, so hard it hurt and dribbling pre-come all down his length. The glide was smooth and slick now, and Dean could feel the tension in his gut, the stirrings of an orgasm just beginning to build.
“I want you to be a good boy, Dean,” he said softly,his fingers brushing through Dean’s hair so lightly that it was almost imperceptible, “Will you do that for me?”
Dean eases the paper open, and finds a sleek black box. He lifts the lid slowly, revealing a set of Ben Wa Anal Balls in varying sizes.
Luckily for him, Hannah led him the other direction, to the far end of the large apartment, and into a spacious office room. There were bookshelves lining the walls, a well-stocked liquor cabinet, and a big, imposing desk sitting in front of the floor-to-ceiling windows. The room had dark wood panelling, with deep earth toned wall-paper. It felt like a very masculine space to be in, so Dean wasn’t surprised to see their Boss sitting at the big imposing desk, looking very much like this was exactly where he belonged.
“Oh, cool. Just I heard Castiel here shouting like a little bitch, so I figured I’d come and save your asses.”
Dean clambered off of Daddy’s lap, missing the warmth he felt from being held by strong arms. He felt one hand yank at his lounge pants, and then fell easily to the floor, leaving him in his silk panties, stretched tight around his cock.
Dean threw his phone onto the seat and sighed. He’d thought about calling Sam and telling him, but Sam was at college and Dean figured that meant he didn’t want to know anything about Dean or ghosts or the voice of their dead mother.  So he kept driving.
“Makes perfect sense.” Dean said, raising his eyebrows at Castiel who used a hand to hide his smile.
“Okay, but there are rules right? Like for kinky bondage shit, there’s rules to stay safe,” Dean felt panic rising in his chest, but tried to breath through it, trying to maintain at least some sense of composure.
Dean thought about that for a moment, realizing it was probably his best bet to just go along with it. The chances of him being kidnapped were slim, and it probably was best to do everything he could to ensure his Boss’s privacy remained intact, lest he face the consequences. He slipped the bag over his head, and tried not to freak out about it.
Eventually they were snaking through the streets of downtown Chicago, and Dean felt himself shrink down in his seat, despite the heavily tinted windows, as they passed a university building. He didn’t know if it was specifically Sam’s building, or if it even belonged to Sam’s school but shame curled in his gut all the same. He’d known straight away that he couldn’t tell his brother about this, about covering for their father yet again, about getting naked for money to cover for him, which was new.
Dean was still blindfolded, but he managed to un-straddle the stand, and crawl out from under the desk. He was kneeling on the soft carpet when suddenly he could see again, the sleep-mask pulled from his head and discarded on the desk behind him. He stood up, blinking a bit in the bright light of the midday sun coming in the huge windows.
At least the thong had worked out, he supposed. He’d have to have a look at what else was in the drawers. He climbed between his own, familiar sheets, resigned to sleeping alone.
He had his wits about him enough to try and make this sexy, subtly trailing his fingers across his stomach as he rucked the fabric up his chest, flexing his arms a little as he pulled it up over his head, wanting to impress his boss, to keep this opportunity. He may be a potentially dangerous loan shark but fuck if he wasn’t the hottest thing Dean had layed eyes on in months.
“Now we salt and burn the body. Swap the guns for gasoline, and all that.” Dean said, starting off towards the house again.
“Uh,” Dean hesitated, “Well no one was around so I just went looking. Sorry if I wasn’t supposed to.”
“Where are we?” he asked, unzipping his jacket as they entered the nearly too-warm building, a huge white atrium with a rock garden and a giant snake plant by the reception desk. There was a fountain tinkling somewhere, but Dean couldn’t see it. The place felt sterile, bare of any personality or humanness.
If Dean spread them, she was going to get an eyeful of his crown jewels. He really didn’t want this woman near his dick and balls but on the other hand, he enjoyed his kneecaps the way they were. There wasn’t really any other choice here; he took a deep breath and let his knees fall open.
He heard Dean get up at one point, but ignored him in favour of shutting his eyes again, pushing Ash to the other side of the bed as he got more comfortable.
“Yes,” he said bluntly, not wanting to explain that he sometimes drove five hours to Boise just to get a blowjob from a stranger he met in a gay bar, “Have you?”
“Okay,” Dean said, turning the phone over in his hands. It was a brand new model, the latest Samsung Galaxy S series, he wasn’t sure what number they were up to. It was a damn sight fancier than his second hand iPhone seven with a shattered back and a large crack running up the front. “Thanks,” he said again.
