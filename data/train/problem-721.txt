"God, Sherl, if I didn't love you so much I'd have a go at you right now." John says through clenched teeth, a muscle in his cheek jumping.
Sherlock, feeling much better emotionally at this point, stands, staggering a bit before John catches him.
The last bit was said with a smile, Sherlock knew Cluedo had wormed her way into his heart all on her own. John laughs softly, his hands finding their way to Sherlock's head, stroking the side of his neck in a way that made his skin turn into gooseflesh.
"You alright, love?" John's voice was a gentle rumble in his ears. Sherlock nods, his head moving against the cotton of John's sweater. They were cuddled on the couch together, and the only thing grounding the detective was the warmth and weight of his boyfriend's arms around him.
He had been purging for close to fifteen minutes. He had gotten everything up in the first ten, but he couldn't stop raking his fingers down the back of his throat, obsessed with getting each tiny morsel of food out of his body and down the toilet. His knuckles bled, his throat was raw, and snot and tears dripped off his face and blurred his vision. Nothing but bile was coming up, but the detective knew the statistic that stated you could only purge up to 80% of what you ate, but goddammit,
"Good. Go to sleep."
John frowns, and then unexpectedly shoots his arm out and grabs Sherlock's forearm and squeezes hard, earning a grunt of pain from the detective.
But now they were seated in a booth in a local restaurant, and locked in a battle of wills.
John begins to putter about the kitchen, turning the coffee maker on and opening the blinds before stopping to think hard about what he would make. Cooking for Sherlock was always hit or miss, and it felt like a losing battle at times. Serving him healthy, low-calorie food seemed to go over best with the detective, but there's only so much energy and needed weight a fruit salad can give to a person. Breakfast is usually the easiest. Coffee and toast, or a bagel. It wasn't much, but Sherlock tends to feel ill if he eats too much in the morning, and it sets a bad pace for the rest of the day. John remembers serving him a full English breakfast once, and Sherlock had spent the morning crouched over the toilet, unwillingly getting sick. The rest of the day he refused solids, and John was ready to tear his hair out in frustration by the time night fell.
He feels fingers loop through his own as Sherlock shifts to lay he head on John's lap, the latter stroking and playing with the former's dark curls.
"Um, I'm not sure," John says, pulling the meat thermometer from the bird. "It just needs to keep cooking. You were a real help earlier today with the hors d'oeuvres while I was with the turkey, but all there's left to do is wait, I suppose. Everything else is done, the table set and the string lights on, yeah?"
"No." Sherlock says, a bit too quickly. Although he enjoys having John compliment him, he was beginning to feel a little uncomfortable with it. Logically, he knew John wouldn't lie to him or make anything up. But he couldn't stop the deep, prickly feeling that made him question everything he said.
"So, has the boy been seen yet?" Sherlock asks, trying to force some authority into his tone.
It was Molly.
Sherlock is surprised. Lestrade has never just "handed over" jurisdiction to him before, no matter how heavily he was involved in the solving of the case. It occurred to him it was most likely a pity offer, and although that annoyed him, beggars can't be choosers and he's lucky he even
His hands shake as he twists and snaps the razor, careful to keep his fingers out of the way. That last bit was ridiculous; why bother protecting your fingers when you're about to open up a vein??
"Where'd you get that idea?" John asks, angling his body to face Sherlock's, his hand resting on his knee. John felt Sherlock repress a slight shudder, and he pulls his hand back quickly.
"Thank you. Let's go," Sherlock says, taking John's hand and turning to leave. So far, no one had said anything about him and John's obvious relationship, but it was becoming apparent that everyone had known and called it before John and he even considered it a possibility.
me, but word is that you have some sort of, I don't know, food problem, of sorts? It's not my business, but I just thought--"
"Yes, I'm sure! I don't know where he is, but he's not here." Mycroft pinched the bridge of his nose with irritation and guilt. How could he not know where is own brother was?
John's voice rings through the flat, a sound that Sherlock has come to love. They were supposed to go out to eat, the transparency of John's intentions irritating the detective. He had found a packet in John's desk that had information about dealing with eating disorders, and one of the tips was to go out on a fun trip that involved food, but did not revolve around it.
proud of you, love," John says softly, pressing a kiss to the other man's neck. "You are so much better than you were 6 months ago. Seeing you heal and grow does wonders for me. You're trying, and it shows. I couldn't ever be happier about anything else."
John scoffs quietly, just a ghost of a chuckle. He turns the detective arms over, and touches the cut slightly.
without fucking up?
"Well, that was a bit of a shitstorm," Sherlock says dryly.
They had put up the tree the day after Thanksgiving, and done their Christmas shopping the next Monday. Decorations and outside lights came in the first week or so of December, and presents from friends and neighbors started accumulating under the heavily-adorned tree a week and a half ago.
Sherlock strains to hear if John is awake, but he can't discern where he is from this far away. He figures he would have come to find him if he knew he was missing, so he was safe to cut.
When John finally announced that the turkey was ready, time stood still for Sherlock.
The two sleep peacefully through the night, each dreaming of the others lips.
"It's not funny, John, it was distressing," Sherlock grumbles bitterly.
before, I don't know how to show it. So I just...don't."
the medical attention?" Sherlock replies bitterly, rolling up his left sleeve.
"Sherlock, is there something you're not telling me? You're being more of an arse than usual." John says, failing to conceal the hurt in his eyes.
John tries not to look at the scars decorating Sherlock's body, but he soon finds himself tracing the wounds, spanning from shoulder to mid knee, with a few on his calves.
"Could you..." the detective falters, feeling a bit silly. "Could you, er...describe me? What I look like? What I actually look like, I mean."
to not know how to properly care for her!" Sherlock asserts, feeling a little flustered at the realization that he is now what they call a "cat person".
"John?"
Sherlock's face twists into a scowl, "Oh, wipe that smug look off your face, Doctor Watson. I'm not your patient, you didn't "fix" me, I'm doing this on my own."
, you don't know how
The detective chews on this statement a while. As much as it pained him to admit it, he did want to talk some things over. Sometimes it was hard to talk to John around the whole boyfriend dynamic. A neutral party was probably the best bet for conversation.
He tiredly stands, and makes his way to the bedroom. Sherlock is a still lump under the covers, and John takes a moment to stare hard at his form, trying to discern a breathing pattern. Ever since that night that Sherlock almost died, he's had the compulsion to watch him while sleeping to make sure he was still breathing. The lump moves softly, and John is visibly put at ease.
"Come on out, and I'll take a look at it. Please."
Sherlock's mind is blank for a bit, before exploding into such pure joy that he thought he might fall to the floor. "You're serious?! A case?!"
"Hello, Molly," Sherlock replies, giving her a once-over as well. A new dress, but not too revealing; her bag held a a few gifts that look to be professionally wrapped; she was wearing perfume, but not too much; and her makeup accentuated everything the way it should without being over the top. It was obvious she was taking precautions to avoid being deduced and called out on her attempt to impress Sherlock. He knew she still fancied him, but she had respectfully backed off once she found out he and John were an item, which Sherlock appreciated.
Sherlock turns to face John and buries his head into his side. John puts his arm around him and pulls him closer, smiling fondly.
John still isn't sure he comprehends this correctly, but he knows better than to shit on someone's identity. "I know you love me, and it's okay if you don't want sex, I'm not going to force you to do anything you don't want to do. Is kissing okay though? I mean, what is the line that we can't cross? What constitutes as sexual for you?"
"Anything for you, love." John says, trying to put as much kindness and as much love as he could into those four words. Sure, John had indeed fantasized about sex with Sherlock, but if he didn't want it, there was no point in pushing it. If all he got from this point on is a bottle of lotion and some tissues, it wouldn't matter, because he already has more than enough love from Sherlock Holmes.
"Well, no one
They were drastically different, but somehow all the same. Every day he and John interview potential clients, almost every day they are running the streets of London, hand in hand, chasing taxis and criminals and running from the boredom that threatened to overtake the detective.
"I love...I love you too...John..." Sherlock mumbles before he drops off into a deep sleep, the love of his life by his side.
Sherlock is momentarily confused at his boyfriend's sudden discomfort until he feels his stomach again, making out raised lines crisscrossing his midsection.
Molly wipes her eyes, careful not to smear her makeup. "Get back out there and go back to John. Tell him what you did after we leave, or I will. I will not have you hurting yourself on Christmas Eve."
He makes a decision. He inhales, holds his breath, and brings the blade across his wrist heavily. Blood beads up out of the cut, and run down his arm after a few seconds. The sight of it gives him a slight high, and he poises his blade to cut a second time before he's interrupted by a knock on the door, dropping the blade in surprise.
John inhales and covers his face with his hands as the detective stared at his stomach.
Molly is cut off by another knock, and the conversation is halted by the rest of the guests entering the room.
Sherlock exhales forcefully, trying to calm the whirlwind of emotions inside him. Hurt. Anger. Frustration. Betrayal. Shame. Embarrassment. Everything he hates all swirled into one. Emotions came so easily now, and sometimes Sherlock wished he could go back to feeling numb and sad. At least sadness was familiar.
So he lets go, and he makes merry.
His dreams had faded, and he was in a comfortable limbo between sleep and wakefulness, just awake enough to feel the warmth of John next to him, but just asleep enough to not feel anything but peace.
Sherlock smiles a bit. John wasn't even awake, but he was caring for him even in his sleep. Sherlock grips his shoulder more firmly, shaking slightly.
with the emotion was often a much more arduous task, but he still felt rather proud of himself for being able to identify  his emotions so well up to this point.
"Yes," Sherlock whispered.
Sherlock's mouth twitches slightly in what John guessed was an attempt at a smile. "I...I love you too, John. Even if...even if I don't show it well enough."
He picks up the razor from the floor and examines it. Surely there would be a loophole, some way to extract the blades and then replace them.
Sherlock was grateful for John's optimism; it does get so terribly exhausting being a pessimist. Even if he doesn't always believe what John says, it was nice to have a constant positive note in his life, keeping his negativity in check.
"No," Sherlock says, his eyes narrowing. "What are those?"
Focusing on the book was difficult; the image of Sherlock convulsing and sobbing on a hospital room floor kept flashing across his retinas, and he couldn't help but feel a deep and profound sadness. He felt a little helpless as well. There was only so much he can do for Sherlock in that state; nothing he could say or do would make the panic attack cease. His chest aches at the thought of his boyfriend suffering from these regularly, alone and afraid, with no one to hold him afterward and tell him he's loved and that he'd be okay.
Hey guys! Just letting y'all know, this is the last chapter I'll be able to put out for a bit, I'm moving across the country for college and I don't know how long I'll be offline. Enjoy this chapter, I'll be back when I'm settled! Thank you for staying with me this long!
But when they got home, when no one could see, things changed. Instead of sitting in their respective chairs, they would cuddle up on the couch--Sherlock usually in some wildly uncomfortable position and insisting he was fine--and John would drink tea and absentmindedly fiddle with his boyfriend's curly dark locks. They would chat, Sherlock mumbling incoherently as he slipped into sleep, his neck aching in the morning as he realized John had stayed by his side the entire night. A good morning kiss was to be expected, and then the normal started once more. It was an exhausting whiplash effect that Sherlock thrived on.
Sherlock shook his head. "It's fine. I never had a taste for it myself, the whole process was rather disappointing, but I understand that you're not like that, and I can't ask you to become completely celibate just for me. It's just a foreign concept, is all."
"Oh. That's great...would you care for a cuppa?"
He shifted, moving his arms to encircle Sherlock, who leaned into him and pressed his body against him. He had to protect this man. He had to save him, or find someone who could.
John looks over at the couch where Sherlock lay, making sure he was still okay. A cup of hot tea sat on the coffe table in front of him, half empty.
Hello friends! I'm working on an actual chapter as well, but here's a Christmas chapter to tide you all over! Sorry it's so late, but I hope you all had a wonderful Christmas, Hanukah, Kwanzaas, Yule, or whatever it is you celebrate!
John laughs out loud, surprising himself. Has he always been that clueless? Has
She smiles at him fondly before handing her gifts and coat to John.
"Yeah, I know. To be honest, I thought it might help you take care of yourself if you had another living thing to take care of. Something that needed you alive to survive itself. So...I brought her home." John finishes, rocking slightly on his heels in anticipation.
He knows he's been caught, surely they must have noticed his nearing 20 minute absence. The only thing he can do now is make her go away long enough to collect himself.
"You never thought that I cared about you? You never thought that I would resort to cutting myself to escape from the pain of losing you? Compared to what the Fall did to me, these scars are nothing,
"I'm sorry, Sherlock," John says, his eyes filled with secondhand hurt at the look on the detective's face. "I know how important privacy is to you, but these things happen. We don't have to talk about it, I've actually asked them not to say anything about it. They know it's your first case in months, and they're going to be gentle."
He undresses and crawls into bed with Sherlock, settling on his side so they were back to back. He feels his boyfriend unconsciously move closer, and John relished the warmth of Sherlock's body pressed against him.
He needs to cut. Right now.
, Sherlock,
"Pale? Translucent, more like," John teases, running his thumb over the detective's cheekbones.
He collapses on the floor, and pulls a towel down from the rack to muffle his cries. He cries until he's certain there's no more tears left in the world for him to cry, and after a few minutes he is left an empty husk of a person on the bathroom floor. His face hurt, his stomach hurt, everything hurt except for his soul, which remained completely numb. He needs to cut.
. If she wanted to lose weight so bad, why didn't she just quit eating? Didn't she know she can't lose weight when she's eating enough to sustain a family, even though she's vomiting it back up? Disgusting. Pathetic.
What a ridiculous nightmare he lived in that made that phrase completely sensical to him.
Sherlock doesn't quite know where to look, where his eyes should go, so he just turns his attention to Cluedo while still leaving his face observable.
"It is good for you. You were half dead when we started, Sherl, anything's better than that, mate." John says kindly, smiling the way he did when he was looking at the detective, sending a rush of affection through Sherlock despite the circumstances.
know how much I've done for you, and that when you snap it's just because you're changing and you don't like it."
Sherlock nods, processing. God, how he loved this man. Who else could put up with his mental state, the constant battle of wills and resolve over something as minute as an extra bite of toast or a quick flash of the wrist? Sherlock knew he was extraordinarily lucky to have John for himself.
"Do you want to try that case again?" John asks, rather suddenly. "We don't have to, I just thought you might want to try to get back into the game. Get back onto the horse, so to say."
Cluedo chooses this moment to yowl indignantly, and Sherlock covers her ears and says in mock-offense, "Not in front of the child!"
Sherlock grits his teeth, willing the voices to be silent. But what if they were right?
was the broken one, and John is the infallible protector with no faults. He knew, logically, that John must have some insecurities and doubts, but he largely doesn't think about it. He wanted to say something along the lines of "I'm more fucked up than you so you can't possibly understand how I feel", but he knew that wasn't true. He was, admittedly, more fucked up than John, but he knew that that didn't mean that John didn't have the right to feel badly about himself at times.
"Rules are rules, mate." John states definitively, giving Sherlock an irritating fake smile.
As his vision focused, he made out John and Mycroft crouching beside him, attacking him with a barrage of questions.
John smiles warmly to himself. He could tell today would be a good day.
"Okay, fine, whatever you say," Sherlock concedes. "Just show me the case already."
Why does everyone think I'm not? I'm not some broken child, I am a grown-ass adult and I can fucking do things by my fucking self! Stop treating me like I'll break if you breathe on me, I swear on my goddamn life I will call a cab and leave you here if you don't stop fucking saying shit like that to me!" Sherlock shouts at the top of his lungs, his hands curling into fists so tight that his fingernails pierce the flesh of his palm. He has had it up to fucking
John laughs, shaking his head, "Yeah, I think you're right. I don't think I could ever leave Baker Street even if I wanted to."
He didn't realize he had said this aloud, but he's almost glad he did. There was some small part of him that enjoyed this. It made him feel safe and loved, in a way. It let him know that someone cared, that someone would be there to love and pick up the pieces he shattered himself into. He would never say this, of course, but deep down, that's how he looked at this. Not as an invasion of privacy, not as a punishment, but as an act of love. It was a rather strange way of looking at it, but Sherlock chose to think this way.
John wanted nothing more than for Sherlock to be okay. Unfortunately, old habits die hard.
A brief flicker of annoyance across his therapists face, but he covers it with a strained smile. He guestures to the armchair next to the shuttered windows, and Sherlock delicately sits down.
John seems to notice, and grabs Sherlock's hand tightly, smoothing his thumb across his scarred knuckles. The touch is welcome, and the detective feels some of the anxiety assuage.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. "I already told you: I don't have friends. Just one."
Sherlock looks down, his ears burning. "Approximately seven minutes ago."
"Hey. No. Don't walk away just yet. Can you talk to me, a little? Please?" John asks, sadness clouding his eyes and tiredness lining his face.
to help him. John is going to read all he can, talk to anyone who could help, do anything to save this man. He would do his damndest to ensure Sherlock's happiness and safety, and God help whoever stood in his way.
"For...for always being such an arsehole." Sherlock says quietly. "I'm sorry that I'm so...
"Sherlock--" John says, his voice slightly strained, sucking in his stomach and moving a few inches away so that the other man's hand doesn't touch him.
"Good things or bad things?" John asks, his voice like liquid amber caressing the detective's mind, calming his racing thoughts.
Suddenly, alarm bells and klaxons start sounding in his mind, and the peaceful numbness submitted to a familiar panic. Nibbling at food from an unknown origin was one thing, actually making it with intent to eat it? That was terrifying. It's easy to pretend that calories don't exist when you don't know exactly what and how much is in the food. But when you make it, you're aware of every tablespoon of butter, every ounce of sugar, you are made intimately familiar with the food and then you're expected to eat it. Sherlock could feel a panic attack coming on, but he takes a breath, closes his eyes, and says,
"I'm fine, thank you for asking, and I'm capable of making my own decisions. We're going to the house, just me and John, and we'll be fine. I don't need you, I've never needed you." Sherlock snaps, his tone just a tad angrier than he meant to sound.
John smiles, stroking the side of his boyfriend's face. "Alright, love. You stay here, I'll be back shortly." Sherlock makes a noise of vague agreement, then another of irritation when John disengages from him and leaves the bed.
A knock at the door startles him, and fear rushes into his system as he freezes where he is, his fingers still partway in his mouth.
"I don't really want to." Sherlock says, fulling aware of how much of a petulant child he appeared to be. "Not right now, at least. I'm tired."
Sherlock smiles, "just like you."
"Yes," Sherlock says quietly, not entirely truthfully. "I just was a little...I don't know, rattled? I didn't like the thought of our Cluedo ending up in the hands of someone like that boy. It's silly, I know, and I wouldn't have even considered having empathy for the animals if it weren't for your bleeding heart bringing home a stray animal and forcing me to fall in love with it."
The documentary John had rented is playing, and it was tracing the ancestry of cats all the way back to Egypt, where the first domesticated cat is thought to have originated. Sherlock is paying rapt attention to the film, but John finds it hard to focus on the TV when his own beauty is next to him, and John is allowing himself to indulge in what he had always itched to do ever since he met Sherlock: run his hands through his hair. The thick, curly longs feel so wonderfully right in his fingers, and John feels like maybe, just maybe, they'll make it out all right.
They had gone to ride the London Eye, which Sherlock had never been on. They managed to get a car all to themselves, and let's just say John had no doubt that Sherlock loved him.
It's funny, isn't it? He can flay his flesh to the bone and not bat an eye, but the sting of antiseptic and the prick of a suture needle have him squirming.
Sherlock nods, suddenly trepidatious.
"Whatever you say, love," John says, still looking so gorgeous in that shade of happy. "We can watch a documentary on cats. For educational purposes, of course."
"I'm fine...I just fell asleep...sorry..." Sherlock mumbles, his mouth dry and cottony. He could barely feel his extremities.
John finds this difficult to process; as a man in his late forties, sexual attraction is a long-since established facet of his life. How could someone
The kitten stumbles into the room in the vague direction of the detective, who lifts his feet up onto the bed on instinct. A little silly, he realizes.
Sherlock looks up to meet John's eyes. "That's all that matters," he affirms.
"Am now. What's the matter, love?" John says gently, his eyes soft and kind. He reaches out to Sherlock and grabs his hand, squeezing it reassuringly, grounding the detective.
"You're doing really well," John says quietly, still focused on the spaghetti in front of him.
The detective cups the side of his flatmate's face, one hand resting on the back of his neck. John grasps Sherlock's left wrist--dangerously close to discovering the new cuts made moments before--and Sherlock exhales slightly in pain, but  hopes John doesn't notice.
"Bilbo looks like someone I know, but I can't place it," Sherlock mumbles distractedly, leaning into John's touch.
"I'm sorry."
"Well, all right then," John says, scribbling numbers into a notepad that he kept hidden from the detective.
Not so standard reply. Maybe things were changing. John isn't sure what the change in desire to drink tea signified, but he was ready to accept any kind of change at this point. As John is making the tea, he casually remarks,
After the movie was over, the two strip down and enter the shower, steam enveloping them like a blanket as they press together, bathed in hot water and love.
"I'm sorry," Sherlock says eventually. He felt stupid and shameful and self-loathing. Can't he just go
It was rather strange, having an eating disorder and being in active recovery from it. He always felt as if he had a limit he couldn't eat past, but a limit for what? He wasn't going to be able to lose weight anymore, and he wasn't really going to be able to maintain anymore either. So why is he obsessing over his limit when there's no reason to have one? Yes, he feared gaining weight more than anything, but it was going to happen--hell, it
"Anything I want?" Sherlock says suggestively, sniggering when John's eyes flew wide.
John gives Sherlock a look. "You know what. I'm supposed to wait by the bathroom every time you go within an hour of eating."
Sherlock has never been more on-edge.
Right before John's breaths slowed into a sleeping rythm, Sherlock speaks up, his voice cracking.
"I love you too, Sherlock." John says, eyelids heavy with sleep.
"I did mention it, actually, but I left out the details. They don't need to know everything." John responds. Sherlock nods, feeling rather ambivalent. People have accused him being queer, but he never really sat down and tried to find a label for his orientation, so it was a nonissue for him. Still. It's just one more thing to be picked at for.
The two hail a cab, and spend the ride talking, laughing, and joking. Sherlock realizes how he missed the buzz of the pre-case adrenaline. His senses revving up to full gear, witty banter and flirtation with John, the thrill of the chase to land some criminal behind bars--oh how happy he was to be back!
Sherlock's mouth twitches in what could be a smile, but remains silent.
John is silent for a moment, but Sherlock can hear him shift his weight, still outside the door.
Sherlock's stomach sinks. Moving to London had been the start of what he hoped was a new life. Growing up in a small town meant that everyone knew everyone's business, and he was ever so desperate to escape the place that knew every painful detail about him. And now, people know.
"Well, it's not that I
"I wonder if he's looking for me..." Sherlock wondered aloud. He knew that John would tear apart the world to find him, but there was that nagging voice in his head trying to convince him that he wasn't worth it.
Recently John had allowed him to keep a razor in the bathroom for shaving. He had been clean for about a month prior to this particular allowance, and the deal was that he could have one razor with one set of blades, and if he wanted to replace it with a sharper razor, he would have to return the dull one. The aim was to make the idea of cutting less desirable when the fact that John would find out when he wasn't able to shave anymore came to light.
"So what if you have, Sherly? That's a good thing, you know." John says exasperatedly, pinching the bridge of his nose in frustration.
"You can just say I'm pale, John, it's a common fact."
The taller man inhales through his nose, annoyed. "I hardly ate anything, how am I--"
"He's at home. We were waiting for you so we could go question him," Lestrade explains.
But in this moment, Sherlock felt pretty close to what he thought the girl must have felt in her last moments.
"No, not just like that. I stopped for a while, then relapsed, then clean for a while, then I relapsed again. I've been clean for about two year and a half years. I managed to stop soon after you came back. It wasn't easy, mind you, but I focused my efforts elsewhere. Taking care of you has kept me busy, and so has the cases. It is dangerous to be alone. Luckily, I'm not alone anymore." John says, his eyes crinkling at the corners and gazing lovingly down at Sherlock, making the detective feel warm inside his chest.
With that, the detective bursts into tears, dissolving in sobs as he clutches his boyfriend's arm as ragged cries are ripped from his throat. He hasn't allowed himself to cry since he first confessed his past to John six months ago, and all of a sudden the dam in Sherlock's mind breaks and he can't do anything except cry and cry into John's arms.
Sherlock grimaces a bit at the reminder that everyone most likely knows, to some degree, of his fucked up mental state. He used to not mind as much being called a freak, mostly because his "freak" attributes were his superior intelligence and his deduction skills, and Sherlock is rather proud of those. But this is different. Being depressed, suicidal, anorexic, and a cutter was so much more personal and close to home, and he had fought so hard to keep that aspect of himself hidden and away from scrutiny. The word "freak" now carries so much venom nd weight that Sherlock isn't sure he can handle it being directed at him again.
He sits on the edge of the bed, trembling.
"Stop wasting my time, John told me all that already. Where's the boy? And the cat?" Sherlock says shortly.
"Hey, come here."
, about this time, and I don't think it's just because you're a man."
After dinner, Sherlock helps John with the washing up, buzzing with anticipation. It was the third meal he had eaten and finished, and he hoped that was enough to convince John of his recovery.
"Oh, these cracker things are lovely, did you make them, Sherlock?" Lestrade says through a mouthful of food.
John returns to the living room, settling in next to Sherlock with two cups of tea and a bowl of grapes.
So when John served him a very complex sandwich composed entirely of vegetables and low fat meat, he had to allow himself to eat. For Cluedo, John had said. Can't have her impaling herself on his bones. Sherlock surprised himself by laughing at that. He hadn't laughed in a long, long time. John seemed to realize that as well, and his eyes had welled with happy tears that made Sherlock feel like maybe he could recover after all.
Sherlock's cheek twitches in annoyance. How the hell could he not know?
"Fulham. Short drive, but we only have two cars, so we'll just take non-essential personnel--"
John chuckles softly in a knowing way, which further pisses off the detective, but he lets it go.
John had to agree. The two were cuddling in bed, watching the morning sun filter through the dust, turning the air alive with flecks of gold. Sherlock's head rests on the crook of John's neck, tickling his flatmate with his breaths. Sherlock 's hand sits on John's chest under his T-shirt, relishing the feeling of his heartbeat on his palm. He moves his hand to John's stomach, caressing his thumb over his boyfriend's skin.
"Every time I talk to him I feel like he's trying to dissect me," Sherlock says, already finding himself irritable about the topic. "Like I'm some patient he needs to diagnose and patch up."
Sherlock had just finished having breakfast with John, their hands interlocking on top of the table as Sherlock nibbled on his toast that he never finished.
Silence again, another exchanging of looks. Sherlock whirls around, coat and scarf flapping dramatically, and grabs John by the hand and pulling him with him. His grip on his boyfriend's hand is a little too tight, but John, as always, endures.
"Can I..." Sherlock cringes at how desperate his voice sounds, "can I...see it? Please?"
"I have you, and that's enough." Sherlock's mouth turns up a little as he says this.
The case was simple, in theory, so the detective was rather frustrated at the fruitlessness of the interview and at his inner voice chanting
"Are you?"
"Oh, Sherlock," John mumbles into his shoulder. "You've always made me proud. I could never be disappointed in you."
"I'm trying my best, John. Please keep that in mind." Sherlock says, equally as quiet.
John slowly untangles himself from Sherlock, careful not to wake him up as he disengages. It was still rather early, perhaps around 8:45 in the evening, and he still had some paperwork to do before the week was over. He no longer felt anxious about leaving his boyfriend alone in the bedroom anymore; he had grown fairly confident in Sherlock's ability to come find him if he felt the need to hurt himself.
A salad. That does sound good. Not too high in calories, but still tasty. Sherlock nods in agreement.
Sherlock is made aware of a hand on his back--rather, just five fingertips gently resting on his right shoulder blade. The touch grounds him, but doesn't overwhelm him in his raw, vulnerable state. John says nothing, just continues keeping his fingers on his boyfriend's back until his sobs turn to whimpers, his gasps turn to shudders, and the twitching of his hands still into slight tremors. Slowly, after what feels like centuries, the detective pushes himself off his hands and knees and rocks back into a kneeling position, his head still bowed and his hands closed into fists.
"I understand. We all have doubts, I know I do."
"Sure! Sure..." Sherlock says, rushing back to his room.
John shrugs honestly. "I don't know. It's just...more real, more intense. Like the first time, but with some kind of urgency with it or something, like if I don't act now and love you hard enough I'll lose you forever or something. It's stupid, but that's the best way I can put it."
John looks at the reader, his expression unreadable. Sherlock has to bite the inside of his cheek hard to keep him from asking what the number was, but he winces when he chomps down on the skin, raw from being chewed on constantly.
A knock at the door is heard, and his boyfriend releases him. John crosses the room to answer the door. He opens the door, and exchanges greetings and hugs with the guest. Sherlock recognizes Molly's voice.
"John. John. John. John. John."
"Do you need any help with that?" he asks, walking over to the kitchen.
"Oh, I, uh, I have a...surprise, for you, of sorts."
"Well, that's done," John says, tugging on the last stitch, making Sherlock wince. "Sorry mate."
John's eyes fly open, his body tensing as he goes from 0 to 100 in a split second. "What...whassamatter? Sherlock...." his words slur with tiredness.
As they enter the room, the group goes silent, and gives the detective that silent stare of judgement. He glares at them, and they hurriedly go back to their work. Donovan lets her eyes linger a bit more, her eyes carrying a wicked glint in them, making Sherlock's stomach turn uneasily.
And that was, well, progress. Progress he never thought he could make.
"A lot of things," Sherlock whispers into the darkness.
"It's fine, John, I'll be alright," Sherlock says dismissively, waving his hand. They both knew the detective had an insanely high pain tolerance, but he knows his boyfriend still feels bad stitching him up with only topical anesthetic.
His body hurts from the tension he held during the dream, and his jaw aches from clenching his teeth. His face is wet with tears, and the detective dissolves into silent sobs as he tries to rid the dream from his mind. He's become quite good at crying almost unnoticeably, but it had been awhile since he had cried like this. He usually felt so empty, but he's full out sobbing now, and it hurt everywhere to keep it contained. He claps a hand over his mouth to stop himself from making noise, and he tightened his body to suppress the sobs wracking his body. He squeezed his eyes shut so hard that his face hurt, but the image of John dead on the floor had burned itself into his minds eye, with no escaping it.
The ex-soldier laughs, and Sherlock has to say it looks good on him. Everything looks good on him, actually, but laughter especially.
They're at dinner, and Sherlock is forcing down bite after bite, about to short-circuit, but bound and determined to win. Each mouthful of food sliding down his throat feels like another nail in the coffin. He realizes, for the millionth time, that he's never going to look as thin as he wants to as long as John is around. But if he's honest with himself--which he often isn't--he knows he will never be thin enough, no matter how much weight he loses.
"I would rather like to go home now."
The cab ride home is silent, but not in a bad way. Awkward silences were unheard of at this point in their relationship, and sometimes it was nice to not have to say anything. The cab pulls up to 221B, and the pair tiredly walks into the flat, up the stairs, and the detective collapses on the couch. Cluedo jumps up onto the couch to meet him, and curls up next to him.
John smiles lovingly at his boyfriend, and brushes his thumb across his cheekbones again. "Well, however awful it was, I'm glad that it led here eventually. Even with all this...mess...that we've been in, I still wouldn't trade it for the world. You are my world, in fact."
"Does it matter? They never come when called." Sherlock says petulantly, still eyeing the cat as if it were a creature of the deep.
Sherlock discards the razor onto the floor and feverishly searches the bathroom as quietly as he can, trying to find even one blade that John hadn't managed to find and confiscate. Under the sink taped to the ceiling of the cupboard, inside the power outlet cover, and inside the shower rod had been his go-to for hiding spots, but somehow John had found them all.
"F-fine." Sherlock replies, his voice cracking as he straightens up, his cheeks stained red as he tries to hide the glow with his mug of tea.
"I just don't want to do this anymore," Sherlock sighs defeatedly, then rushes to clarify as he sees the alarm on his boyfriend's face, "I mean, this whole recovery thing. I want to get better, I do, but I wish it were easier. I would love nothing more than to be able to snap my fingers and get better. Not all this drama with the scales and the wrist checking and having to wake you up in the middle of the night because I had a flashback."
"Alright, I'll stop then," John says gently. "I hope you know, though, that I wouldn't say anything that I didn't believe to be true."
John smiles fondly before leading the detective to his laptop.
He read a news report once of a bulimic girl who met her end kneeled in front of the toilet. She had gorged herself to the point of food coming back up her esophagus when she swallowed, and the act of purging ruptured her stomach and bowels and she died on the spot. Naked, bruised, and covered in her own vomit, blood, and feces was how she was found by her mother. Autopsies showed that her stomach had pushed its way up her ribcage and displaced her other organs to accommodate the sheer amount of food she ate. He hated that he thought this, but his first thought when he read this was just that she was
Thankfully, John had closed the door behind them, so his panic attack wasn't broadcasted through the entirety of the hospital wing. Sherlock appreciates everything his boyfriend did for him, even something as small as ensuring his low moments were private.
John shrugs, "If you can't, then I'll just work harder. Nothing will stop me from getting you help, Sherl. If I can't do it then I'll find someone who can. I love you, okay?"
"It's fine." Sherlock says quietly. He was so damn ready to start a new life. That's what moving to London had been about: running from his problems to a place where no one knew how broken he was. But now that was ruined. Now people
Sherlock pulls the blankets down, his boyfriend protesting as he tried to keep the sheets up, but finally relenting as Sherlock yanked the blankets away and pushed up his shirt.
"It's fine." Sherlock mumbles, yanking his sleeve down and making to move before John stopped him.
"You come forward and tell me without me having to harangue you."
But some things never change, no matter the circumstance.
"Oh, yes, actually. The turkey isn't quite ready, so help yourself until it is," he replies, gesturing at the table with plates of finger food on it.
Molly returns, and it's as if nothing happened. She stays within eyeshot of him, but doesn't smother him.
Sherlock realizes his mistake and tries to backpedal, but John balls up his fist and looks as if he is about to swing, so Sherlock falls silent, readying himself for a blow.
"Sherlock. You've got to eat, love." John says, hating how pleading his voice came out.
"Why do you feel like that?" he asks, trying to understand. "Is it...do you just not like your body, and you don't want sex because of that? Is it the medication? I don't really understand that."
," Sherlock had seethed, "You don't
Sherlock had been trying to identify each new emotion that presented itself to him, and he was doing a pretty bang up job at it too, if he says so himself. Granted,
It wasn't much, but the detective had to admit that John was getting better at cooking, and if Sherlock was honest with himself, he actually did enjoy eating. The taste, the smell, the sharpness of his hunger easing. Everything that came after was horrific though. Feeling full, thinking of the calories, devising ways to burn it off, and the soul-crushing guilt that accompanied it.
"Did John tell you about...what was going on with me?" Sherlock says carefully, already irritated with the breach of privacy.
Finally, the computer starts up. John opens a new window and clicks on the History tab; he needed the pages he was looking at yesterday.
"J--John?" Sherlock says in a throaty whisper.
"That's fine," the detective said. "I've never really had a set orientation, I don't think it matters what gender I'm attracted to, it's all the same. I've only ever felt true, romantic feelings for you, but it did take the better part of 12 years to get there. Doesn't matter. I mean, it does, but not the specific label."
Sherlock's face is covered with red speckles, heavily concentrated around his eyes and cheekbones. He turns his face away from John's, and the doctor drops his hand.
John shakes his head and returns to the kitchen. He recently has been trying to learn to cook. Fish and chips and other fast food was on the list of Sherlock's "fear foods"--foods that he absolutely refused to eat for fear of weight gain. John couldn't very well force him to eat junk food, but hopefully he would be more receptive to healthy, home cooked meals. He wasn't very good at it yet, but so far he has not set the flat on fire, so John is calling that a win.
"I'm joking, John. Try not to choke on the stick shoved up your arse." Sherlock says, a little more coldly than he meant to.
Donovan smirks, and Sherlock braces himself for the torrent of insults she is sure to throw at him.
Sherlock nods thoughtfully, chewing on the statement. He supposed John was right; he certainly hadn't thought of it that way until now.
"Come here, you stupid git," John laughs, stretching up and pulling Sherlock down to his level, kissing the man gently.
"Well, you're the doctor here, so I must follow the doctor's orders, correct?" Sherlock sneers, catching himself off guard with the amount of venom in his voice. Yep, he's still angry.
"You've got to pick up the fork, mate. I'm sure your parents taught you how to use one." John jokes, hoping to lighten the mood some.
"I don't know, that's why I ask--" Sherlock replies angrily before freezing in shock.
Mycroft sighed. "John. I stopped monitoring him a while back. I thought that now that he was with you, things would get better. Obviously I'm wrong, but that doesn't change the fact that I have no earthly clue where he went."
Sherlock was doing better.
Sherlock was draped over John's shoulder as he worked on his computer, beating his head against his boyfriend's in time to his name being called.
It didn't
"That's not fair, John, I never thought--"
Still, it was their second Christmas as a couple, and this time Sherlock was not in a hospital for it. That's reason enough to celebrate, Sherlock thinks.
Sherlock nods again, standing with John and allowing him to lead him back to the bedroom and into bed. John takes him up in his arms and holding him tightly.
"It's just the capillaries in my face, John," he says, rather irritably. "They burst when I have panic attacks and I get the little freckles for about a week before they clear up. They look like hell, but it's normal. My normal, anyway."
Sherlock snaps his head up, instantly angry. "What the hell do you mean by that?!"
It was around 8 in the morning, and Sherlock was still asleep next to him, his clothing having pressed creases into his face and arms during the night, and John was propped up reading a book. He didn't want Sherlock waking up alone, not after last night, and he enjoyed his early morning company anyway.
"Sherlock...I get it if you don't want to talk. I'm some random person with a PhD that wants to make you open up and tell them all your secrets and cry, and then send you on your merry way after pocketing some cash," he says, staring hard into the detective's eyes, making Sherlock squirm a bit. "But whether you like it or not, I am your therapist and if you want to get better you have to trust me and talk to me."
Trying to move on from the disappointment and sadness he felt from Sherlock's search history, he logs into his account and starts on the paperwork. It didn't take long, but by the time he had submitted the last page, he was tired and ready to go to bed. He logs off, and turns his laptop off. His eyes hurt from staring at the screen; perhaps he should get reading glasses with a blue light filter.
John seldom allowed himself the hopeful optimism that he wanted when thinking about the detective. It seemed like every time he allowed himself to feel hope about the situation, Sherlock would enter the bedroom with bloodied arms, or he would walk in on him feverishly exercising on the floor of the bathroom. It was rather exhausting, but John couldn't imagine how much harder it would be for Sherlock to constantly live like this, for years upon years.
They were hosting a party, as they usually did for Christmas Eve. Last year was no exception, but according to John it did seem rather hollow without Sherlock there. Molly was indeed disappointed, he had heard. This year, hopefully, promised more fun and enjoyment now that he was home.
The Reichenbach Fall.
"No, it's fine, you can put your hand there. It was just unexpected," Sherlock waves his hand dismissively. "I just mean that sometimes, I feel, that I don't show you how much I love you. I've never actually been
"Yes." Sherlock breathes, careful not to wake the real John next to him.
John nods thoughtfully, trying to find the right words to assuage Sherlock's concerns. "Well, like it or not, people will treat you differently now. And I'm not saying that's right or a good thing to do, quite the opposite in fact, but you know they're not going to forget about this anytime soon, and you're going to need to be able to cope with it. The staring, the patronizing, the sidelong glances. It'll ease up one day, but not for a long time. And I'm sorry about that. I just don't know what I personally can do about it. I hope you understand."
"It's kind of odd for me to say this, Sherl, but...this is almost scientific, the way you do this," John says, most likely to ease the tension out of the air, "I mean, you'd have to have surgeon hands to cut this deep but not cause permanent damage."
"Alright, I'll do it," Sherlock mumbles sleepily. "What is it?"
"I'm sorry," Sherlock says quietly. Saying sorry was still difficult, but it wasn't quite like pulling teeth anymore. "I know you've helped me a lot, I didn't mean what I said."
The voice chuckles a bit, ignoring Sherlock's irritated scoff.
"It has. Otherwise you would tell me. How much?" Sherlock asks, fully aware of how crazy he sounds.
Sherlock gave a noncommittal grunt, earning a soft, sleepy smile from his boyfriend.
"They don't look that bad," John says reassuringly. "Just interesting. I've seen it before, but not very often. It's rather rare, or at least uncommon. I didn't quite twig on what it was when I first saw it, that's all."
"Well, we better get going. You're really going to like where I'm bringing you." John says.
"You want this, right? I mean, you're okay with this? This is what you want?" John asks breathlessly. He doesn't want to push Sherlock, not so soon after his panic attack. They had never gotten remotely close to this; the entirety of their relationship has been pretty much fully clothed on Sherlock's part, with the occasional shirtless John at night. John didn't know if Sherlock would ever be ready for anything intimate, and he was willing to wait forever if he needed to. He just wanted to make sure Sherlock was on board when the time came.
The search history brought his light mood down to the ground in less than a second
"No one...no one has ever...said that to me...before...ever" Sherlock gasps, forcing words out between voice cracks and sharp inhales. "I've never...I've never made anyone...never made anyone proud before."
"Alright, then. Show me, and I'll see if they need medical attention."
Despite the word "freak" hurting, Sherlock was very relived that that's the only thing she chose to say. Whether John was behind the lack of teasing or not, he appreciates it.
And for the first time in a long time, he meant what he said.
The argument plays over and over in Sherlock's head, his eyes screwing shut as he tried to block out the voices bouncing around in his head.
"Okay then. Come back to bed. We'll talk in the morning." John says, rising and gripping the detective's hand, squeezing it reassuringly.
A pair of pointed ears are visible, followed by a small, black head with almost comically large emerald eyes and whiskers much too long for a creature of its size.
John returns his hand to Sherlock's knee, rubbing his thumb over it soothingly. Sherlock's hand finds its way to his, and the detective's spindly fingers grip John's more stocky ones. "It's alright, Sherlock. I know you love me. I can tell from looking at you. And you're doing so well, and I feel absolutely honored that you're doing all this now that I'm here. I know you don't love yourself, and I hope one day that will change, but there is never any doubt in my mind that you love me."
John did something he hadn't done in a long time.
He hears John sigh, and he can picture him pinching the bridge of his nose and running his hand through his hair. Guilt and shame eat at the detective, and he hates himself for all the pain he's caused. John didn't ask for this. Who the hell would?
"Wonderful," Sherlock says sulkily.
Sherlock kisses back, of course, but he can't stop the little arrow of guilt niggling at him.
"It's not that easy." Sherlock snaps, hostility glowing in his chest. "You don't know anything about it."
"I'm glad you came when you did, don't get me wrong, but it still kills me to see you doing this." John says quietly.
"Yes, I'm fine," Sherlock lies.
Sherlock sighs. "All right. We'll call her...Cluedo."
you." Sherlock huffs, turning to tend to Cluedo, who had started rubbing her face on Sherlock's hand demandingly. John just smiles and finishes up in the kitchen.
But what if it was? What if the answer was right in front of him, soft blonde eyelashes and worried skin? What if he didn't need to live like this anymore, what if he could be....happy? What then?
"Thank you, that was much appreciated," Sherlock says evenly, hoping that Lestrade would take his words to heart. So far it seemed like this bloke was the only one treating him normally at this point. "Let's get to it then. Where did you say the boy lived, again?"
John's mouth parts, but he ignores it for Sherlock's sake.
He gently, ever so gently, slides his hands to Sherlock's waist, his fingers barely touching the detective's skin under his day-old shirt, before slipping his hand under the shirt and resting there at his waist. Sherlock's lips stall, and he pulls back a bit, inhaling sharply. John immediately jerks his hand back, already feeling guilty for pushing his boyfriend's boundaries like that without asking for consent.
Sherlock has to remind himself.
John jerks his head up, his eyes turned to ice, "I should be grateful? Grateful you're not fucking dead?!"
"Are you sure that's the best idea?" Lestrade asks John. Another wave of indignant annoyance washes over the detective, bringing him dangerously close to his breaking point.
John turns over onto his side so he faces his boyfriend. Even in the dark, Sherlock is dazzled by the beauty of his soldier.
Sherlock's hands tighten into deeper fists, and he keeps his eyes downcast. "I don't know. I've just never been interested. I thought I was aromantic for awhile--not feeling romantic attraction either--but that changed with you, and I thought maybe I would want to be intimate with you, but...I guess not. I still love you," he adds hastily, "but I don't feel anything sexual for you. It's not you, it's just how I am."
John runs his hands through his hair for the millionth time today, as if his follicles held the answer to his problem. "Well...I guess we'll just have to do it the old fashioned way and go out and look."
The two stay like that for a while, until Sherlock is finished with his tea. The detective stirs, and sits up. It's only 7:00 in the evening, but he feels exhausted, as if he could sleep for weeks and still wake up tired.
Sherlock nods, and then forces himself to speak his next words. "I think I'll have some anyway. And the turkey. Maybe the champagne too."
And in a way, it was.
Molly takes a step forward and hugs Sherlock, something she had never done before. He finds his arms around her almost reflexively. She squeezes him tightly, then pulls back, a little too quickly.
John?" Sherlock says louder.
"Fine." Sherlock says haltingly. "I can do a meal a day."
He opens the door to Molly standing outside, he eyes tearful and distraught.
John eventually pulls back, his eyes half-lidded and full of pure love, staring at Sherlock as if he hung the moon. The detective was most likely looking at him the same way. John dries their hands, then claps his own together.
For once, all was well in the world.
"So, John..." Sherlock begins, pausing to clear his throat. "About that case...I thought it might do me some good to get out of the flat a bit. Solve something."
The detective and his boyfriend finish making dinner, and they sit down to eat. Sherlock has estimated about 250 calories for the whole thing, excluding the salad dressing, which he politely declined to when offered. Not bad. At least not bad enough to freak out over.
He makes his way back to the living room, leaving Molly in the bathroom to collect herself. John is busy talking to Mycroft, who had apparently just arrived. John excuses himself and walks over to Sherlock, worry already creasing itself into the furrow of his brow.
"How about...just my face?" Sherlock asks. He's not sure if he's up for a description of his body at this time. He knows he's gained weight, but he doesn't want to know how noticeable it is.
"It's fruit, Sherl. I'm not asking you to eat a disgustingly American cheeseburger."
Sherlock wasn't recovering. Not nearly fast enough. It was always one step forward three steps back for them. Sure, he was telling him when he was cutting, but not until several deep, concerning lacerations decorated his skin. He was gaining weight, but so incrementally that he was still a skeleton and John didn't know if his body could take the stress he was inflicting on himself. Yes, he was taking his medication, but he purged so often that John very much doubted it was being properly absorbed. Sherlock may think he's recovering, and John wants to think that too, but the truth is that Sherlock is not doing well at all.
"Whatever you say, love." John replies. "Now, help me cook this chicken and we can eat."
The office was a friendly, warm place. Low lighting from several lamps, pictures of Frank's kids and dogs, comfortable armchairs and a couch, all designed to be non-threatening and welcoming.
But he needs to cut. Badly.
It wasn't a lot, given how his stomach had shrunk, but he ate enough to where his stomach hurt, and with each bite he felt more and more out of control. He was full, so why couldn't he stop?!
"It went fine."
John's face turns serious and Sherlock's heart stalls.
"You know, I've been standing here for ten minutes listening to you making yourself sick." Her voice shakes with sadness, her lower lip trembling.
"I suppose," His boyfriend says doubtfully. "I'm not very fond of pets. Doesn't make sense to voluntarily bring an animal into your own home." He sets the kitten back down into the box, then gets up and wanders into the back bedroom. Music is heard from within in a few moments.
"Okay, I think I have to get to work..." John murmurs into his boyfriend's lips, but makes no move to leave.
Sherlock got up, almost robotically, and walked into the evening air to hail a cab. He had a lot of thinking to do, and it wasn't going to be easy.
Ah. The million dollar question. Sherlock briefly notes that John used the word "need" instead of "want", showing that it was more of an addiction instead of a pastime. Sherlock nods again, and John can feel his hand shaking within his own.
"Sherlock..."
So why is he here, once again, breaking promises with every slash of the blade?
"Go to sleep. Stop thinking, just for now. Listen," John says, pulling him closer, pressing his hand into the back of his head, pulling Sherlock's head close to his chest. Sherlock marvelled at how perfectly their bodies fit together, the curves and strength of John filling the edges and emptiness in Sherlock. He could hear his heart beating smoothly in his chest.
He knows he'll have to have a serious and uncomfortable conversation with John later, but it's nothing that he hasn't done before.
His boyfriend smiles thinly and nods. "All right. After."
Suddenly, he feels a lurching sensation and the scene vanishes.
Sherlock doesn't know how to feel. The whole "allowing emotions to present themselves and acknowledge them" thing he's been trying to do as been largely confusing and frustrating. What's the point of feeling things if you can't even fucking figure out what the hell you're feeling that way about? He puts down his violin, sits on his bed with his head in his hands, and tries to do some introspection.
-Hannah
John inhales deeply, opening his eyes and shifts so that the hand cupping Sherlock's face is propping him up on the pillow. Sherlock's cheek feels suddenly cold with the warmth of his hand gone.
"Am I what?" Sherlock asks, confused.
"So what are your plans for this evening, beautiful?" John says, somewhat teasingly, darkening the shade of red on his boyfriends face.
He's always loved how John feels. He feels strong, solid, steady. Like you could hold onto him in a hurricane and come out unscathed. Sherlock has always felt rather fragile, as if the wrong word could snap him in half. He hated feeling like that, weak and frail. He has always tried to masquerade as strong and unshakable, but in reality, deep down, he knows he is not anything like John. But, as long as he had him, maybe he can stay in one piece after all is said and done.
"A cat?" Sherlock says flatly, eyeing the tiny kitten with confusion and slight disgust.
Sherlock is silent. It almost didn't occur to him that other adults have faced this too. Every time he was in a hospital, it was always with teenagers and the occasional twenty something. Even in the adult ward, most of the residents were either drug addicts, abuse victims, or had anger issues. He was generally the only one who actively self-harmed and had an ongoing eating disorder. It was often treated by the other patients, even the staff, as if it were something teenage girls with daddy issues did for attention, not something that has held him hostage for most of his life.
"It's no problem, love." John says fondly. "You've earned it. However," he adds, making the detective's heart stall. "I want you to eat at least one meal a day on this case."
Sherlock's mouth twitches and he rolls his eyes, "Yes, Daddy." He says mockingly, then his face freezes when he realizes the implications.
Sherlock nods, purely grateful for this man, this gift he never knew he would recieve.
"It feels good to me as well," Sherlock says quietly, focused on managing one bite at a time.
"What would you like for breakfast?"
"Don't lie to me, love. I'm not going to be mad. I just don't want to stand out here while you hurt yourself."
talk about anything," he says, ever the pedant, "but I have to, so I will."
After the lettuce is chopped up, John leaves the detective to work on some of the strawberries and snap peas they were adding, while he washes some spinach and slices some onions. The two work in comfortable silence, punctuated by knives chopping and scraping against cutting boards. John begins to hum a tune that Sherlock didn't recognize, but finds himself swaying slightly to the beat. He's not really one for music, but anything that John does is worth experiencing.
His therapist sighs, leaning forward on his elbows and massaging his temples and then lifting his face to look at him.
"Nope. It's a surprise." John says, a grin on his face.
The detective's heart jackrabbits in relief, "Really? What is it?"
is here for you. Don't you
"I'd like you to help me make dinner," John says.
Sherlock feels two arms slide around his waist and cross in front of him, closely followed by the warmth of John's body pressed up behind him. The detective smiles, resting his hands on John's. The fact that John's arms still crosses easily around his midsection did not escape him, but he mainly just enjoyed being touched by John. It was new, the appreciation for physical contact, but it was welcome.
John sighs deeply. Sherlock is getting better, but he's still struggling. John figures he couldn't get the history to clear on this ancient thing, and tried shutting it down instead. He rests his elbows on the table and rubs his eyes tiredly. It's no use confronting him about it; what was he supposed to do? Monitor his internet use as if he were a child? John knows he's been eating and keeping it down for the most part, and coming to him when he's spun up about something, so there's really not much more he can ask of him. If looking up nutrition facts of salsa is something that makes him feel more in control, then John couldn't really fault him. It was just...discouraging, nonetheless.
Sherlock turns over with some difficulty, looking directly into John's eyes. "Doesn't it get exhausting? The whole empathy thing? I've never seen the point of it, but after today I just can't believe how exhausting it is to care about something as simple as a cat, even thought Cluedo wasn't in the least bit of danger."
"Do you need to cut?"
"So last time you were here, you mentioned John...how is he?" Frank asks, startling the detective out of his rapid-fire deductions.
Sherlock tried not to wince as the needle pierced his broken skin.
put the case on hold until I heard back for sure whether you were still on the case or not."
Sherlock gets up and plods to the bedroom, throwing off his coat and kicking off his shoes before collapsing on the bed fully-clothed. After a few minutes, John comes and joins him, settling next to him and spooning him, his arm thrown over the detective's waist. Sherlock is more or less asleep at this point, but he still snuggles close to is boyfriend anyway. John closes his eyes, and listens to him breathe. As long as he was breathing, everything would be okay.
John looks at his boyfriend sadly. "You're not a freak, Sherlock; I don't care what Donovan says. You're an incredibly gifted and talented man, and some people just don't see that."
"I think I'd like that," Sherlock says, taking a moment to meet John's eyes and try as hard as he could to beam his thoughts into his boyfriend's head.
"So you like her, and want to watch a documentary on cats to know more about her?" John teases.
John continues to ignore him until he can't resist, turning to kiss him on the cheek, earning a smile from the detective as he flops down on the couch, as his own face blushes.
John clears his throat. "The good kind, I hope. I was downtown last week, while you were gone to therapy, and I found this." He disappears into the bedroom they shared and returns with a box. Sherlock sits up straighter, his interest obviously piqued. John settles onto the couch across from him and carefully sets the box down, and delicately removes the lid.
"First, we need to watch the entirety of Lord of the Rings--you'll love Bilbo, I know you will--with snacks of your choice, of course, and then we can take a shower together--I heard that was fun, never tried it before myself, but we can try--and by then it'll be well past midnight so we can go to sleep satisfyingly exhausted."
John can't stand the thought of something happening to Sherlock. He had asked if Mrs. Hudson knew what to do, and she said just to wait for him to come back. John checks his watch: 6:47pm. Sherlock had been gone since 4:30 and hasn't answered any of John's calls or texts, not even to say that he wasn't dead or dying at the moment.
Sherlock nods. He hasn't quit memorized the calorie count in most vegetables, seeing as they were all on his list of safe foods, and the nutrition facts are hard to read on the sly on the flimsy plastic encasing them, so he's flying blind for now.
Growing up fairly well-off meant that Christmas could always be afforded, and Sherlock and his siblings always received what they wanted (within reason--he remembers one year being horribly disappointed in not receiving the same type of live dragon he read about in one of his fantasy novels), and it had been largely a positive event in his life.
Sherlock snorted, trying to make light of the situation, "Well that's not going to happen."
John's starts a bit before answering, "Yeah? What's up?"
When they walk into the room, a hushed silence falls and all eyes are on him. Sherlock shifts his weight uncomfortably, suddenly aware that he looks much different (read: fatter from full meals and with stubble caused by not being allowed to use a straight razor) and most likely appearing anxious and unsure: two things he had never allowed himself to be until recently.
"So, is there anything you
"Are you alright?" he asks.
"I'm really proud of you, love," John whispers in his ear after they had settled down onto the couch. "Even if today didn't give you the results you wanted, you kept at it, and you kept it together. That's progress."
Sherlock sits at the kitchen tables and offers his arm. John swabs it with a antiseptic wipe, which stings a little. After that, John threads the suture needle and begins working. It only took three stitches to close, but Sherlock knew it was three more than John had hoped to stitch tonight.
Actually, he didn't really have a good idea of what he looked like at all. He hated himself, and that made looking in the mirror quite an unpleasant event. He could identify himself in a photograph, of course, but he had never really taken a proper look at himself without feeling a deep sense of revulsion that would just about ruin his day.
John's head lifts to look his boyfriend in the eyes. "Don't apologize, love. I know you're feeling just as badly, if not more so, than I am right now. We're doing this together, remember? I will never ask you to apologize for relapsing. Never. Recovery is a staircase, not an uphill slope. You'll fall down a few steps along the way, but you'll get up and move past it. Relapsing is not falling all the way down the hill every time."
When he opens his eyes, he sees John's face. He could see the worry and fear drain from his face, and he watched it be replaced with pride and just a tiny bit of self-satisfaction.
"Nonsense, Sherl, I'm--" John starts, but is cut off by Sherlock.
Lestrade beings to relay the information John already gave him, his voice irritatingly kind and understanding.
It was happening again.
But this one....
"You do know there's an alternative to this, right?" He says slowly, as if he was presenting an obvious option that Sherlock had elected to ignore.
Sherlock feels a muscle in his cheek start to jump, and he forces himself to take a breath and relax his grip on the plate. "What John wants of me is his business. Go on and mingle now, Craig."
"Sherlock, you in there? Are you alright?" John's voice is heard on the other side of the door, and Sherlock prays he didn't hear the soft clatter of the razor hitting the tile floor.
John smiles warmly, and walks over to sit next to Sherlock, wrapping his arms around him and resting his head on his shoulder. Sherlock feels himself melting into his boyfriend's touch.
"No, it really is rather funny," John says, trying to keep himself from laughing again. "You're quite possibly the smartest man I know, and I'm good at getting a read on people, generally, but the fact that both of us were completely unaware that the other was in love with him is genuinely laughable, you have to admit that."
Sherlock still has a small scowl on his face, and he is well aware of the fact that he probably looks like some pouty, petulant child at the moment. "Fine. Are we going to cook dinner or what?"
When their lips meet, everything else melts away as if it's the first time all over again. The first real kiss, not when John kissed him out of desperation when he was spilling his life story. Calories, carbs, trans fat, and kilograms disappear as they kiss, and Sherlock wants to stay like this forever.
"I mean, it does, to be honest," John admits, flicking his gaze down to meet Sherlock's. "In the army, you can't really afford to have empathy for people who might not be by your side the next day. It's just a fact of life. You learn to become detached, not forming any real bonds for fear of having that person taken from you, or you from them. Coming back and relearning how to care about people and how to feel things again...it was difficult. I don't think I had properly cared for anyone since I discharged until I met you."
The detective narrows his eyes, "What were you doing?"
But Sherlock was clever. Surely he could figure out how to take the razor apart, cut, and then put it back together seamlessly, right? And yes, he was perfectly capable of doing such, and he had done it many times, but that was with a higher end, reusable razor set. All John had given him were the cheap plastic disposable kind that would require breaking to access the blades inside.
John sighs, unwilling to come forward with the information. "They don't know everything, I haven't told them much besides that you're unwell, but your...attempt...was quite the buzz around the medical staff. No one is supposed to talk about it, but you know how word gets around. From what I can tell, the only thing people know is that you tried to kill yourself, and have been off the grid ever since."
"Neither do you, but you still have a name."
Sherlock looks up from the back of the tea box he was studying--looking at the nutrition facts, no doubt, but John doesn't really care to get into a row over that at the moment--and narrows his eyes suspiciously. "What kind of surprise?"
John seems slightly surprised, but not at all judgmental. "Of course I can. What do you want me to describe? Just all of you?"
"I'll just say this, and then I'll stop talking," John murmurs into Sherlock's ear, "no matter how far you run, no matter how many times you relapse, no matter how much you hate yourself, I will always love you, okay?"
Sherlock nods quickly, not loving the idea of being trundled to the ER once again. "Yes, here would be nice."
"Don't lie to me, Sherl. You woke me up, so something must be up. What is it? Another nightmare?"
to feel in control of the situation helped a lot. John's mind turns to concentration on the recipe, and he banishes all worry from his mind.
Sherlock nods. "Yes, I know. Just...doubts. Always doubts."
at a constant, disheartening tempo.
John's face takes on a pained expression, his eyebrows creasing adorably.
John felt kind of silly praying--he had never been much of a churchgoing type, but he didn't know what to do now.
He feels himself being laid in the bed, his dressing gown being pulled off and cast aside, as John sinks into bed with him, spooning him and holding him closely.
Presently, he feels John carefully extract himself from behind him, keeping a hand on his back to keep him from falling into the spot John vacated. Then, to his surprise, he feels John pick him up delicately and easily, bringing him back to the bedroom.
"Would you like to watch a film tonight, love?" John asks from the kitchen. He had started saving the food that Sherlock didn't eat in the fridge so that the detective could finish it if he liked without having a fuss made over it. Another thing Sherlock appreciated.
John hands him a heart of lettuce, gently guiding Sherlock's hand as he chopped. Sherlock could have chosen to feel annoyed at the guidance; the man knew his way around a knife, but some part of him savored the touch and allowed it.
"I love you," John whispers in his ear.
The fact that he had next to no body fat wasn't helping either, but the doorway he sat in helped shelter him from the -12° windchill at least.
Sherlock opens his mouth to argue, ready to rapid-fire self-deprecating protests, but deflates a bit. Arguments are getting tiring these days. It used to be easy to attack and parry words and insults, but now it was more exhausting than cathartic. He doesn't know why, that's just how he is now.
