"Here's my number. Call me if anything happens okay? Take care. I'll see you soon buddy." Sam says and hands Castiel his phone number and Castiel takes it gladly.
"Yeah yeah. I know."
"Fuck the puppy," Dean said as he grabbed Cas and turned him towards him. Castiel put the puppy on the pillow who was still sleeping carefully even though Dean had pulled him roughly.
Dean never got bored in fact he learnt more shortcuts to solve complicated problems, somewhere in the middle, even Dean joined them and helped Lisa and he himself learnt.
"This is you guys right?" She asked and before Sam could answer he heard someone beside her.
"I had a dream Cas and….and you suddenly disappeared. And a woman appeared and told me to take care of you. That no doubt I will with my life but I felt so scared when you disappeared in middle of talking and you said I left you when you told who you were and before you could say and anything you disappeared-"
"Had a good sleep huh?" Sam asks as he pours himself a cup of black tea.
: Physics. Dean did well and so did Cas. Charlie was not that sure but she said she would definitely pass. Lisa well, she was a topper back in school and they were expecting the same.
"Thank you " Dean said after he wiped off neatly. Cas nodded.
"Do I even have a choice? I'll be coming but not as your partner. Cause I never was. It was all you. Alone."
"You have and you did back then too!" Lisa almost yelled.
"No. I like a guy. He's really..... captivating. Whenever I am with him it's like I don't seem to care about anything else other than him." Dean realised what he said and closed his eyes.
"How do you not know BTS?" Cas asked, crossing his arms and glaring at him.
The same was going on with the girls.
The doctor had told them Dean can wake up any moment so Castiel had no time. He saw his love, with all the pipes and IV and the heart machine beeping in its normal speed. He listened to that. For a moment.
It was time. He rushed out and got in the car and drove in full speed to the coffee shop.
She calmed down and looked at the other three.
"Dean. I myself am a lesbian so I don't mind. Don't worry." Charlie assures. Dean smiled.
: What's with that emoji?
"I need to confess something. I-I don't know if you're gonna like it." Castiel's voice sounded of sorrow and hurt. Dean looked up at his angel and kissed his forehead and nodded to go on. Castiel sighed.
"You seriously don't have anything to say to me?" He ask in his cold voice. Cas looked up.
"What? Where? Why?"
"I'm okay with this too I guess." Jody says.
Sam gave him a small smile before quickly rushing in. Dean wasn't in his bedroom. Cas ran to the bathroom to see Dean on the ground and a broken mirror. Why didn't they hear anything? Castiel lifted Dean's head and put it on his lap and checked the pulse. He was surprised that he was doing what every human would do.
Cas reached forward and held Dean by his shoulders. Castiel was hurt when Dean pushed him away.
"Tell me why."
He met Charlie who was deep in thought.
Dean couldn't believe his ears. Castiel liked someone already? And he knew him?
"Cause even you look like a blood bag to me."
"All I wanted was a single date with you."
Dean came back to the bunker after finishing up a case. It was a long trip back home. He was exhausted and tired. All he wanted to do was hug his angel, cuddle and sleep. He entered the bunker meeting a tense atmosphere.
"What?"
"And yeah, that's us. Wait, you are here? I'm coming hold on." Sam hung up the phone and turned to Dean who still with the kids.
"Then fucking don't ignore me. Okay?" He yelled still angered and his head hurt like a bitch. He held his head, which was hurting a lot.
"What's this Dean?" Castiel asked looking at his cup.
"Are you alright? I can leave for a few minutes." He said and Dean looked up to him.
"Thank you!"
"Me and my brother's used to quarrel as to who should tie her hair. She was bossy. I miss having her around." Castiel took the last bite of his first sandwich. Dean and Cas finsihed their rest of the dinner with a comfortable silence.
"I'll go clean the bathroom." Sam said voice dipped in sadness and guilt.
"Dean, I'm sorry." Castiel apologized. Dean shook his head. "No Cas. I don't need any explanations. I just want you." Dean replied holding back his tears. Castiel nodded
"Oh I haven't forgotten. I care about him."
"Sam, you know I don't sleep," Cas responds. Sam chuckled and sat a little too close to Castiel. Sam had come out as bisexual last month, Dean had no problem with it nor did Cas.
"Hey hey....are you okay?" Dean asked, wiping the sweat from Cas' forehead.
Dean had only smelled him twice and the smell didn't come back. He frowned. He wanted Cas to be his mate. Only his.
"Fine, fine. I know." Charlie gave up.
"Um..hello?" Castiel replies and the boy blushes. Cas wanted to roll his eyes but that would be rude so decided against it.
Again, Dean felt someone watching him but that couldn't be possible. He and Cas sat at the last bench and there was a window which led to the forest of tall eucalyptus trees.
"Oh my god. You're.....Cas." Sam breathed.
"Of course he doesn't know. Look at this."
"Hey Lis. Wassup?" Lisa was sitting on the benches outside the canteen.
"Not when I'm still alive, Alastair." The voice said and suddenly everything went quiet.
Dean froze when he heard the man mention Castiel.
When the boy entered, Dean stood shocked. It was the boy from his school. The blue eyed boy. Dean didn't know what to feel, shocked? Happy?
"You look like you're going somewhere?"
"Never."
Dean sat down infront of him. Cas sniffed.
Dean listened to every word of his boyfriend. Related to the mother of all? What shit is this? He just wanted a happy
Dean was shocked to see who it was. It was his mother and his brother. He looked to Cas.  Castiel didn't get out at first. He sent one of his men, Gabriel. The most skilled and his best friend.
: Yeah, them.
"I don't have any choice."
"H-Hi." The boy stutters.
"I love you too and I'll never leave you, whoever you are. I promise." Cas smiled his bright smile.
Dean dared a step forward to Castiel and the rest was covered by Castiel himself. Now they were standing so close to each other.
Dean didn't like his boyfriend dreaming over some Chinese men.
He got up shakily and tried standing in one place. Dean had seen Cas like that millions of times before and whenever he touched him, he would fade so this time he didn't dare take a step forward. He stood put. Dean saw Castiel snap his fingers making the others in the room conscious. The others slowly stood up.
"I know. I'm Castiel Novak." The guy replied. Dean was surprised that he knew him.
: Psychology. Cas' second favourite subject, you can guess how he had done. Dean said some questions he didn't understand but yeah he did well. Charlie was scared of her result as she was not so sure she did well. Lisa did well.
"Dad..Mom. I have one last question." Dean informed. His parents looked at him and encouraged him to ask.
"I would never! Why'd you think that?" Dean asked, cupping Cas' face almost squishing it.
The day finally came, it had passed by his parents telling him it was okay and he can get through it. His brother, Sam also told him that he could stay with him in his room. Dean declined politely. He didn't want anyone to see him through his transformation.
"Oh."
"Awesome. Let's go get breakfast or else we'll be late for all the delicious food waiting for us." Cas laughed at Dean's love for food. Not in a bad way though.
"English, Math, break, psychology, art, break and lastly Physics." Dean said and looked at Cas who was looking at his own time table.
Sam checked his phone to see any messages from Castiel but there as none. How was Dean gonna react when he sees Castiel, who doesn't remember anything about him? Why can't God give them a happy ending? Hadn't they suffered enough?
Hey!! Please do leave kudos and comments if you like this story which is very much appreciated. Thank you so much you guys!! 💜💜
: English. It was a damn easy subject for all the four of them and they did well.
His lover, blamed of his accident, wasn't even allowed inside the hospital.
Cas sighed and screamed seeing Dean standing there.
The college building was huge almost like Hogwarts.
The four of them had gotten pretty close. Dean and Charlie decided to keep a secret of their inheritance from Lisa because they had no need to tell her.
Hope you liked this story, please do comment and leave kudos. It is very much appreciated. Love y'all 💜💜 see ya soon 🔜
"It's you dumbass. It was always you." Castiel whispered. Dean chuckled at the choice of words Castiel chose. Dean didn't say anything.
Happy reading y'all 💜💜
Castiel despite the being pushed away by Dean, touched his forehead and healed the pain.
She helped Dean drink some water and his pain vanished for sometime. Dean had dosed off to sleep.
: Take care, both of you.
"Okay, Dean. Today you might get miracle of your life." Sam whispered to himself.
"Y-Yeah yeah I'm good." Cas smiled sadly. Dean knew that was a lie but he wouldn't push it. If Cas wanted to tell he would.
"Oh, we have almost the same classes today. Except I have chemistry instead of art." Cas said and Dean smiled.
"I can't tell you Dean." Cas said as he felt himself tearing up.
"Could you please leave?" Asked Castiel in a very cold tone before Lisa could reply Dean.
"The mark, you and him. Him being your mate. I don't know if I should be the one to tell you this."
The man laughed.
"Isn't the reason obvious?" She asked smiling broadly. This annoyed Castiel a lot.
They were all good people and Dean got a little comfortable.
"I know what you are. And I know you're trying to control yourself that means you've through you're inheritance recently." Castiel stated. Dean was shocked by the information thrown by Cas at him. Cas? Yeah that sounded better.
"You don't disturb me. And don't worry about about my clothes, it's fine as long as you're okay." Cas blushed at Dean's statement.
Cas didn't reply so Dean picked him up and went outside, Charlie following behind.
Jody hugged the boys.
Castiel chuckled. "So get this,....I found out something. I went to the library and found a book named
"I'm good. I missed you like a lot."
: Hey guys.
Dean was never this happy.
Dean chuckled a bit and pulled Cas to their bed.
Hello fellow destiel shippers, hope you are having and amazing day/evening/night.
As if he was sleeping, he opened the door yawning.
"You think so? I'm sure. We need to get in now, Sammy." Dean said and they got out of the Impala and slowly approached the barn which was a small distance away.
"Yeah, come on."
"Come on Charlie, please tell me." Dean pleaded with her, afraid she would not tell.
His mother went out of his room and saw John, her husband looking at her with a small smile.
"Dean! You can't fucking die on me like this. Get up you assbutt!" He yelled shaking Dean. Sam was surprised and was filled with different emotions, surprised because Cas, an angel of the lord used a curse word. Sad because Cas was yelling at Dean to wake up. Confused because he didn't understand why Dean didn't wake up even though Cas healed him.
⭐Okay so I just wanted to tell you guys that I'm posting the same story on Wattpad too so if you're interested or like to read it there, you can
Dean looked at Charlie who understood. Dean placed Cas on the bench and Charlie sat beside him.
"About what?"
Dean looked to Cas who had his eyes closed, he was awake. Dean could tell. Dean blushed remembering what Dean had planned to do that day. He was gonna propose to Cas. They would get married and Cas would be his husband. They would have their own family and they could adopt a kid or more. Wait, can Cas get pregnant? Oh my god. The mental picture he got was precious.
They were about to go towards the boy's dorm buildings, when they heard a most disliked voice of a girl.
"Okay um.. the time's up. Let's go or else we'll be late." Dean said and Castiel agreed and got up.
Castiel wanted to hit his head with something. Who on earth would tell that directly?
He opened his mobile for the first time since he came to college. It was 9:34pm and he knew everyone at his home would be awake so he video called them. Realising he would disturb Cas, he stepped outside.
"I know you will. Thank you for protecting me."
Dean, well, was very nervous. Charlie had told Dean to just confess. Dean very much wanted to but he feared Cas wouldn't like him back.
"Not both of us, only Cas," Sam said and wiggled his eyebrows at Castiel. Castiel just looked at his coffee cup.
"Okay, guys. Meet Sam." Garth said as he wiped the saliva off one of the babies. Sam raised an eyebrow. "And this one is Castiel." As soon as Garth said this Dean could hold back a huge smile. Sam smiled in relief. This was the first time he'd seen Dean smile in a long time. Maybe spending time with baby Cas would do Dean well. Sam noticed Dean's eyes getting watery.
"Should we still play along to this?" Castiel asked sadly, tears filling his eyes as he looked at Sam.
"Yes. Yes. Oh my god." Dean said and Castiel took the box from Dean's hand and took out the ring from it. It was a ring that had a little grace in it. Castiel then slowly gave away his full grace into the ring by cutting a small open on his arm. He was human now. The ring was glowing. He put on Dean's ring finger. Dean smiled as tears rolled down his face.
"Wha-"
Dean and Sam laughed.
They said goodbye to Lisa and headed back to their dorms.
"Sure, I would love to get to the know the angel better." Charlie winked at the boys and ran off to her own class.
Days passed and there was no sign of Castiel.
Castiel blushed and thanked her.
: uh y-yeah yes it is Sam. Dean, Castiel, where did you find that?
"I don't know you." Dean said with gritted teeth.
Dean woke up earlier than Cas that day and got ready, Cas followed suit.
"Hey what happened?"
"It's my favorite K-pop boy band and you have to see them, they look gorgeous." Castiel was daydreaming about how the members of BTS looked. They were a sight to see. Castiel very well knew this was gonna make him jealous.
"What is it?" Cas asked concerned. Dean looked worried.
Again. The same feeling of someone watching him.
(See the end of the chapter for
"What just today?" It was Dean. He looked confused and was looking at Justin and then at Cas.
: We'll sneak you in?
"No. How did you know I was.." Dean trailed of.
Sam insisted Dean on driving baby. Dean smiled as soon as he touched the steering wheel. Sam was checking his phone, again and again, to see whether Castiel had texted him. But nothing yet.
What was happening to Cas?
"Can I help you somehow, honey?" It was his mother. Dean groned in pain. He manged the word "water" somehow and heard the footsteps receding.
"Of course."
"He told me his parents told him about our kind. He helped me when I felt the thirst towards Lisa when she came over." Dean informed.
"He's right. Come back later." Dean said and smiled at her.
: Do you guys know what this symbol means?
"I'm sorry. I thought you'd hate me."
"It's not you, Lis. It's me. I don't want to hurt you in the future. I don't want to lead you on even though I don't feel like before towards you. Please forgive me. I'm sure you will find someone better than me. Good night, Lis." Dean kissed her forehead one last time and smiled at her and walked back to his building.
Castiel banged on the door. No response. Castiel couldn't feel anything, anymore. The bond was blank. He was panicking. He shouldn't be feeling that. But when it came to Dean, he was just full of surprises. Sam gestures Cas to come back before pushing the door using his broad shoulders. It opened with a crack in the door. Castiel put a finger on Sam's forehead, healing all the pain.
Sam looked at Dean confused. Dean didn't know what to think. Where had Cas gone? Did he leave him? But Dean didn't know why! They never did even fight since that day. He couldn't lose another person he loved again. He had lost everyone he'd loved, he lost his mom twice and got over it pretty quickly as he expected it was bound to happen. Except for Sam and he was thankful that Sam hadn't left him, he was not ready to lose his love too. Cas was the only thing holding him in place and control. Now that he had disappeared, Dean felt himself losing. He felt strong arms on his shoulder, he turned expecting to see Cas but it was Sam.
"I guess I died and came bac-" Cas didn't get to finish the sentence as Dean sat up.
"I would never ever hate you or leave you. Remember this forever. Don't be scared little angel. I'll always be with you." Dean kisses Cas' each eye telling him that he loves him again and again.
"Why would you kill yourself, Cas?"
"Cas.....come on now. Please." He pleaded his voice cracking and he looked around but still no Cas.
"I would very much want that. Don't leave me ever. I love you too." Dean whispered in Castiel's ear. Castiel helped Dean freshen up as he was stinking due to the hunt, and they both cuddled as sleep overtook them. With a puppy in a basket on the side of their bed, who also slept very well. Sam had a nice entertainment but it was short lived.
"Sam told me not to. He told me to first ask you  if it was okay to keep him with us and then tell you that it was a puppy." Castiel answered confused.
"It was boring." Dean rolled his eyes.
His room door opened slowly as his mom entered. She kept the glass on the nightstand and saw Dean who was looking at her with a pained expression, his eyes color flickering between green and dark red. His mother gasped but didn't say anything.
"Hey Cas. It's okay. We're here now. It's gonna be alright."
: Is it something bad?
"Look after me? Why?" He asked. Sam just kept quiet. Dean rushed out of the room searching for his angel.
"Happy Birthday Dean!" Garth hugged him. Bess just wished him.
"I'm sorry. You must've mistaken me for someone else. I'm Steve." He pointed at the badge. Sam was speechless. Everything was the same. He was Cas. But with no memories?
Charlie and Cas hugged. Dean didn't want to. It was not a problem though.
But Dean, I will never leave you, even after you die. I will always be by your side, watching over you. I love you." Castiel said as he placed a kiss on Dean's neck.
"She's a real pain in the ass." Cas said. Dean looked up to see Cas trying hard not to laugh. Dean smiled and both of them laughed.
Dean didn't answer and Cas understood.
: it's my birth mark. It's been there since I was born.
"You don't need to thank me Cas. And I'd always do that......does he know?"  Cas shook his head. Lisa sighed.
As he was walking down the stairs to the exit of the hospital he met Dean's best friend, Lisa. She was supportive and helped them all the time.
Dean hadn't really slept, he was awake. He heard the rustling of the other person and thought Cas was having trouble sleeping, but when he heard silent sobs he was wide awake and snapped opened his eyes. He looked towards Cas' bed. The boy had his head face buried in his hands.
as he said he gave some juice, even he drank and after that all I saw was black."
"What's the truth that he can't tell me himself? This only means I was lied to. I don't understand."
Dean was confused as to why his mother was bringing him wine.
Garth and Bess were smiling at the couple and Garth gave a thumbs up when Dean looked at them, Bess smiled at them lovingly.
"Yes. Charlie and Lisa found out just by me looking at you. You're so dense Winchester." Cas told and Dean took a few steps forward and kissed Cas on the lips, it wasn't too passionate, it was just perfect for their first kiss. Cas was shocked but eventually kissed back.
"Oh, where though?" Dean asked as he sipped the coffee which didn't taste good for him but still drank it as it was by Cas.
Castiel looked up at the tall guy and titled his head to the side, confused. "Like who Sam?" He asked innocently. Sam chuckled a little.
They had one week before their exams started.
Dean kissed Cas' forehead and went back to his bed. Cas layed down. Dean talked to Cas until he felt asleep. It was the most peaceful sleep Cas had slept in three days.
"Ask him!!" Sam said angrily pointing at Castiel. Castiel looked down.
Cas hesitated before he called Dean.
Cas knew they would accept him but telling the same lies to himself was getting difficult.
Dean nodded. "I will. I don't wanna keep secrets from him."
Sam knocked on the door.
"I know." Cas said which made Dean chuckle.
meant but unfortunately there was nothing written in the books.
Sam prayed to Cas as soon as they sat in the car but there was no response. Sam didn't understand what had happened.
"Good morning." Dean said as he yawned. Yes. Vampires can sleep if they really want to or else they can stay up all night. It depends on what the vampire wants.
"And that's all thanks to your boyfriend." Cas said at last. Dean raised his eyebrows.
"Yeah. Me and Charlie were waiting for you and Lisa. Lisa had come and you hadn't so I was worried and the whisper suddenly said ' save him ' and I ran to find you."
"What is it?" Mary lit up like a bulb.
"Hey Castiel."
"Yes. Hundred percent."
"Hey, seems that we're room mates." The guy said in his raspy voice. Dean gluped and quickly took a swig of his juice.
"I just wanted you! And you are following him around like a lovesick puppy as if he loves you. Because newsflash, he doesn't. It's just brotherly love, try learning to differentiate between them." She said with a hopeful glint in her eyes.
Justin approached Cas and he was uncomfortably near Cas. Cas pushed only to be pinned back by the boy.
Dean had his art class before the second break. It was an exhausting class, but Dean liked it. They were given a project of drawing a picture of the thing or a person that makes you feel special. Dean had someone in mind and so did Charlie. The teacher told them since it was a joint project with their partner, it has to be unique. The teacher wanted a single drawing which contains the told topic.
Castiel grabbed the beer in Dean's hand and placed it inside the fridge. Sam was surprised this time that Dean let Casteil take away his beer in the morning. Whenever Sam had done that, he acted like a baby who was forgotten to be fed.
It was in the morning that Sam left for the grocery store to bring a pie to cheer up Dean for good this time. He couldn't leave his brother hanging like that.
He was brought back to the present by the scream of his little brother.
Dean started laughing as he saw Sam. His hair had turned pink. He had no clue how but it was damn funny.
"Yes." He said looking down at the promise ring they had gifted each other on the first month anniversary promising to love each till the end of the breath. Till they die.
"Cas, this is Charlie, my art partner. Charlie, this is Cas." Dean introduced.
Castiel, being the literal angel he is, agreed as per the mother's pleading.
"Didn't he once tell you that he wants to adopt kids after you both get a job and have a stable income. Bitch it might not be his."
"Nice to meet you." Cas extended his arm. Charlie smiled and looked to Dean who was staring at Cas' extended arm. Charlie remembered their conversation from before and decided to briefly shake Cas' hand.
"Don't you want to know who that is?" Asked Castiel. Dean looked at with anger and hurt but sighed.
: don't worry Charl, I can get us through 😉
"We're good Sam. And I have a question before I talk further." Jody says and turns the Camera to the surroundings. Sam gasps.
"Hey Dean?"
"You guys are my heroes. And Sam and Castiel are the most important to Dean. So I thought these would be the best names for them. I admire you, Dean." Garth said.
"Or else....or else I'll make that accident happen again and this time he will not survive." Mary said, with an evil smirk.
: Sure hun, but how would we come to the boy's dorms?
"His name's Castiel. He's good. He knew about me." Dean said and saw his father raise his eyebrows.
"What classes do you have today?" Asked Cas.
"He...uh he's gone to heaven to attend some duties and it was important. He had to rush and told me to look after you." Sam replied. It was a lie and Dean seemed to notice.
"Promise?"
It has been three days and Lisa has a hard time believing that she was friends with a vampire and a werewolf.
"I do yeah. I still fucking hate him. But he doesn't seem to mind.."
"I'm losing my grace. Only a little bit is left in me. I lost most of it when.....I um...was being.... tortured." Castiel took a deep breath. Dean was looking at him shocked. Castiel was losing his grace? Dean didn't care if Castiel had his grace or not, whether he was an angel or a human because to him Castiel will always be his angel.
"Yes. Make me yours." And that's all Dean wanted to hear. He kissed Cas, removing his own clothes in the process.
Sam suggested that he'd drive, Dean agreed still thinking about what happened to Cas. Will he come back to him? Dean was emotionally weak, after seeing so many of his loved ones die, he was not ready to see Castiel's lifeless body.
"Hey! We're the cutest couple around the campus."
"Since that dream."
He opened the door to see Cas already sleeping. Dean smiled.
He approached the class and opened the door. It was dark but Dean didn't need light  to see that Cas was tied to a chair, unconscious in the middle of the room and Justin was standing there with an evil smile on his face. He had hit his baby. Dean was very angry that his eyes had turned red and his fangs were out.
"Dean....we have to study." She said, fearing what will happen if Dean was there.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Sorry for disturbing you and making a mess of you shirt." Cas said sniffing.
"H-H-He's uh... He's gone to heaven. Some ur-urgent business." Sam said, and he bloody stuttered. Now they will surely know something is wrong.
The clock hit 12 and Dean didn't feel anything but a few minutes later, his whole body was in pain. He couldn't do anything. He refrained himself from screaming but it was too hard.
"Cas??!!!! I know you can hear me. Get down here." He yelled in the hallway and Sam had to cover his ears.
"I woke up in a hospital a year ago on I don't remember sorry. They told me I was found by some people and had lost too much blood. They even told me I might have slight amnesia but I seriously don't remember anything and then I took up a cleaning job at the grocery store to pay the hospital bills and then seeing my work I got promoted. I don't know if this helps you but I hear voices every night. It's like someone is calling to me and they're sad. I've heard it from the day I was found in the hospital. They seem so sad and hurt and I can feel them and to be honest, when I saw you I felt like I know you and I felt really happy. And.....this might sound crazy but I don't get sleep like others nor do I get hungry." Cas/Steve ended.
"So what're you gonna eat?" Sam asked as the waiter came up to them.
"He won't even like me now. Why did you do that?" He asked with anger and sadness. Dean did not know Cas was into men except for Sam. Because he kinda insisted on telling, promising that he'd not tell anyone. Sam kept his promise. The only thing Cas hid was he wasn't into guys, he just liked Dean. No other men interested him.
Just as Dean turned to Sam angrily the man, demon caught Dean by his shirt and yanked him close. The other launched forward to push the demon away but with the snap of the fingers, all fell unconscious except for Sam.
"Did you like the campus and the food, son?" His father asked.
The door was opened by a young lady. Sam smiled, Dean did not remember who she was.
Dean felt bad. But it had to be done. For himself and Lisa.
This is the last chapter and yeah enjoy reading readers 💜💜
"Right." Cas chuckled remembering how cold he was to her. "I'm Castiel."
"Hey, come on this way." Cas said getting his attention. Dean looked at Cas who had pie in one hand and two sandwiches on the other.
They went to the campus terrace. No one usually goes there. It was like the secret spot of the four friends.
"Yes baby?"
"No. I don't have anything to say." He replied unable to meet the other boy's eyes.
Castiel had changed his full attire. He had gotten rid of the trenchcoat, his everyday clothes. He was dressed in brand new black jeans and a white shirt which was not tucked in, a tie was loosely hung from his neck and that hair......godamnit, was gorgeous. Dean was left speechless by seeing Cas. He walked up to Cas who was standing there and waiting for a reply from the brothers.
"I love you." Cas said, surprising Dean.
"So am I just-" Dean was cut off as someone entered. Castiel took this as a distraction and walked away to the class from the changing room. Dean followed him out and nothing else happened other than the two glancing at the other not knowing the other knew.
Castiel felt every emotion from Dean because of their "profound bond" as Cas says it. Love, anger, jealousy, guilt, sadness, hurt, heart-broken. Why wasn't Dean accepting that he liked him? He turned to Sam who looked just sad as he looked still watching the place where Dean stood.
"Cas....are you still gonna ignore me if I'll kill myself?" Dean took out his gun and pointed at his heart.  And suddenly there was the sound of wings fluttering and there stood Cas just as Dean saw him in his dream. Sam had run out from the room as soon as he heard that last sentence, but thankfully Castiel had come. He slowly made his way away from them.
It was a quite night. The only sounds were of the clock ticking, crickets chirping, leaves rustling due to slow wind. Castiel saw that Dean had already slept. He couldn't sleep as he was too lost in thinking what would happen to him. There was still two months for Christmas break, meaning two months of telling lies to himself.
Dean was in a bad shape and just when Sam stepped forward to talk to Dean, his phone rang. The caller ID showed "Garth". Sam smiled and picked up the phone.
Dean raised an eyebrow. "Oh, me? I'm fantastic." Castiel could see the anger in his eyes. Maybe this was the anger that Sam was hoping for not an emotional breakdown.
"Stop lying!"
"Why would- wait, what are you hiding from me?"
"I promised you that I'll think of a new name for you."
"You dug your own grave."  "What do you mean? You're gonna tell my son? You think he'll believe you?" She scoffed.
Cas didn't know about the rare vampires who had their mate decided by someone from above.
"I'm just making lunch, Garth's in the living room to the end. Make yourself at home." Bess said as she went to the kitchen.
"Cas...I need to tell you something I learnt yesterday." Dean said. He had forgotten to tell him because of their activities the previous night.
"Dean? What're you doing here?"
Sam and Dean checked the whole barn and found no one.
"Which is this song you're listening to?" Dean asked.
"Yes. Not literally but I take care of him now as his parents died.....died in a....a car crash."
A guy approached Cas. He looked good but not as good as Dean. He had light blue eyes, dark brown eyes, plump lips. He looked at Cas in a way that made him uncomfortable.
"Never."
: Oh yes I did.
Dean just ran towards the direction of Cas' class leaving the girls to wonder what happened.
"Are you serious right now!?"
Castiel held Dean's chin and made him look at him and gasped. Dean's eyes had turned red from green. Castiel didn't know about the colour changes.
Dean took his clothes from their shared closet and went to the washroom. He got a nice hot shower and put on his everyday clothes which looked like it was made for a model.
Dean didn't know what to do now. It's not like, he can just go to heaven and ask for Cas. Maybe he had some heaven business to attend to, he's gonna come back. He told me he would never leave him and now....he just vanished.
"I'm your true mate?" Dean nodded.
And it was over and their results would be announced after Christmas. They finished their first year of college.
"Yeah." Cas blushed and looked away.
"Yup. I like talking to her." Cas told Dean smiling. Dean nodded.
"That's why we need to go back."
"What is it?"
"Hey Lis. What's up?" Dean said clearing his throat.
"He harassed Cas. He should be thankful that I let him live." Dean scoffed.
"I- I am sorry for being late." He said and Dean pulled him and made him sit on his lap. Lisa rolled her eyes.
Cas decided he would give it more time and joined Dean with completing his homeworks. The boys were done on time. It was dinner time and had to get down.
"What do you say Cas? Should we let her be out "best buddy"?" Dean asked.
It was all set up when the door was busted and a broad-shouldered man entered.
"As you wish, angel." Dean was on top of Cas again. He admired the view of Cas. He looked ethereal. Angelic.
Sam woke up and smiled knowing today was Dean's birthday. He was always excited to celebrate his big bro's bday.
Castiel gave him the best puppy eyes he could. Dean saw this and sighed. He looked at his brother who raised his hands in the air.
"Ugh, you guys are gross."
"I'll tell you later uncle."
"Dean you didn't answer my question. Who's your room mate?" Sam asked excited.
: Thank you mom, dad. And Sammy.
: Dean and Charlie had art while Cas and Lisa had a study break.
"Vampires have their perks." Cas shrugged.
"I'm not embarrassed of being your mate. I really love it. I love being yours. I didn't tell them because I know they will accept me in an instant cause you don't choose mates. I want them to accept me just as I am."
"Hello, Dean." Castiel spoke. No one other than Sam knew what had happened previously of Cas missing and things. They didn't get time for that.
“I like coming here in the mornings. I like the quiet. The promise a new day holds. For a while there, it felt like the only time I could truly be myself. Not have to carry the weight of a mask,” Cas explained, as he used the hand of the arm encircling Dean’s shoulders to card through Dean’s hair, “I liked that I had this time alone; time to think and clarify and work through things.”
All of his thoughts got stuck when he saw Castiel’s arms around Max.
Dean spat out the toothpaste and then turned to Cas while fixing him with an exasperated look. “Babe, then wait until I’m done brushing my teeth.”
“Yeah Cas, the other times we lost you. That’s when Dean breaks. You’re his breaking point. That’s always been the case Cas, he’s always wrecked. He withdraws into himself, pushes everyone away, gets suicidally reckless. He’s always wrecked but this time he seemed wrecked and… I guess, haunted.””
“So, you’ve been waiting for me to initiate contact?” Castiel said after a while.
“As her roommate, that is a very frightening idea,” Hannah chuckled. Castiel smiled politely. He could tell Hannah was reaching for more conversation, trying to draw out this time they were spending together. Castiel could feel her eyes on his face as he kept staring at the van.
Dean shook his head to clear the thoughts away; he almost missed what Sam was saying when he started talking again. “Dean, you can sleep at any given minute of the day. Literally, on command. I have seen it. I’m not buying it.”
I fucked up with Sam. And now, I fucked up with you. I..I just feel so
“Get the fuck out of my way,” Dean all but
“Dude, you’ve got to work on your wording,” Dean said after exhaling roughly.
He was in pieces.
He could not breathe.
"What do you mean "fun things"?" Missouri asked, eyebrows drawn.
Dean has a lot of questions for Amara, and lets see how she responds to them.
“Dean, you have nothing to be sorry for,” Cas said tenderly, “I spoke, and you listened. But Dean, I need to know that you’re okay.”
Cas settled himself and nodded at Sam.
“You’re not,” Sam retorted, but it was not a challenge – merely a statement. Dean shrugged and sipped his coffee, watching the steam curl around his vision the way the empty had curled…
like it.
“I want –" Dean started, voice tight.
“And, as I’ve mentioned, Sam was not in the accident nor would it be wise to give your brain triggers that will force premature memory recall.”
“And don’t, please don’t say you never said that,” Dean’s voice, usually overflowing with emotions, just rang hollow.
Cas sighed, the red tinge not yet fully faded on his cheeks, as he reached below the seat in front of him. Dean saw Cas pull a black messenger bag out and lift it onto his lap. He shot Dean a nervous glance before lifting the flap and pulling out what looked like a green notebook.
Jack cocked his head to the side, and Dean smiled at the gesture. The kid really reminded him of Cas.
“Coming,” Dean called as he hurried towards the door.
“I do not know why you are here, though, Castiel,” Amara said, not unkindly, as she eyed him quizzically.
Castiel fought back the overwhelming rush of tears that burned behind his closed lids.
Accurate. But annoying.
“If you decide to finish these last three weeks, I promise the following: if Sam wakes up, you can go see him, no questions asked, no objections from my side; any developments, good or bad, I will let you know immediately through Charlie or Stevie. I will also, of course, reinstate all phone and visitation privileges. In fact, I will even let you call Bobby right now, and you can talk for as long as you want with no time limit.”
“You were,” Dean whispered, “We got you out. But you seem to be trapped in your head, in the loops the Empty set out.”
Dean’s posture quickly hardened from shell shocked to cold fury. His gaze steeled, his shoulders tensed. Cas watched as Dean’s guarded persona bled over him.
Castiel grinned at him. “No, I am not. I am running straight towards you, Dean Winchester. Straight towards the person who reminded me of all the joy living can bring, the person who I am falling so ridiculously head-over-heels in love with.”
Cas smiled warmly, and his face flushed at the compliment. “Don’t look at me like that, or I’m going to drag you back to bed, and then, we’ll be late,” Cas warned.
Dean’s jaw dropped. He has seen about ten photos of Cas in the past five years (okay, not about, he saw exactly ten photos. Whatever.) And now, suddenly, he has
Thank you so much to everyone who has read, interacted or subscribed to this story! You guys are so amazing and I so appreciate every single view, kudos and comment!
“Look, you’ve been travelling for over a day, I think you should just go to sleep. Call me in the morning, and we can figure out next steps, okay?” Meg suggested.
Amara said nothing as she studied him.
“And then, the fucking doctor just said that Sam had some type of head trauma and he kept using the word ‘if’ like he may not wake up.”
There were quite a few of Cas.
“Of course we’re not leaving him,” Sam interrupted, “but unless you stop treating this like a kamikaze mission, I’ll be the one going into the Empty and not you.”
When they reached the door, Castiel walked through without hesitation. This room was still new to Dean, he didn’t feel the same confidence strolling in and making himself at home the way Castiel just did. Dean stood on the precipice for a few seconds before following the other man in.
And never during those times had Sam made such focused and pointed eye contact.
“Yes, Yes and I will have so much fun doing so.”
Dean scoffed and rolled his eyes, which he had been doing a lot of recently, “Yeah right.”
“Shut up,” she said it plainly, with no malice, and Dean sighed in defeat.
“She does seem to like collecting wayward souls,” Dean mumbled.
Castiel burst out laughing and was happy to see some of Dean’s real smile sliding back. He wanted the fake smile gone more than he could remember wanting anything else. He wanted Dean to look at him with his eyes dancing with humour, with his lips tugged upward.
Cas looked down at his hands as he tried to avoid replaying Dean’s hasty exit in his mind. He wasn’t exactly sure what he had done wrong. He wasn’t sure why Dean had gone from holding onto him as if he were the only source of oxygen in the whole world, to cold and brimming with anger. But he hated it. He knew he should ask Sam more questions about Chuck. How were they planning on keeping an eye on him? Were there any loyalist angels in Heaven that might pose a threat to them? But instead, all he could think of was Dean. The way he had looked at him when the Empty had come for Cas and the way he looked as he had fled out of the room mere hours ago. He wanted to talk to him. He ached to talk to him.
He luckily managed to pull himself together before the end of the ceremony, in no small part thanks to Cas’ hand that was twined in his.
Dean nodded slowly, “okay.”
“Looks like the new patient is joining us today,” Castiel offered as Hannah came to a stop right next to him. She sat down on the bench as she reached out a hand which held a steaming mug. Castiel took the cup of coffee she offered as he breathed in deeply.
“Heya, Cas,” his voice was rough. Castiel walked over and dropped onto his haunches in front of Dean, unsure if he would want him sitting next to him. Unsure of what he needed.
So, he just stopped climbing into bed until he was about to physically fall over. He threw himself into his studies and made sure to take on as much extra lab work as possible. He read. A lot. He started gardening, as much as he could on the small balcony attached to his apartment.
fight.
“Dude, everyone fucking
“Well, you did it at the start of our relationship, so I thought I’d do it at the start of the next phase.”
“Sam calls it a fetish,” Dean dropped onto Castiel’s bed, star fishing so that he took up all of the space on the comforter as he stretched out. “I call it an adequate appreciation.”
“Dean?”
“Gabriel, you were just a child yourself. You were not my parent. It was not your responsibility to look after me, but you were there for me when it mattered. When I crashed and splintered, you helped me put myself back together. You gave up so much of the independent life you had created for yourself to ensure there was a place for me to stay after the first time I tried to... you know. You dropped everything, again, when I needed you this time.”
Jack was nodding slowly along.
“You didn’t explain, you just told me to leave,” Castiel said after a moment, voice still unsure, but luckily for Dean, he did not try to reclaim his hand.
“Dean,” Castiel grinned fondly, “I was looking for the right words.” He reached for Dean and pulled him back to their earlier positions.
Dean huffed out a breath and then nodded. “Usually, you know, I didn’t let Sam near him. I never told Sam what happened when he got that way. But he saw it this time and he nearly goddam lost his mind. But I convinced him it was fine, that it wasn’t worth the effort.”
A flash of pain seemed to flit over Dean’s features. Cas looked at Dean, raising his eyebrows in question. Dean just shook his head and stood up to clear the table.
He stared at his phone for a long while, the anxiety of being forced to share space with the stranger building behind his sternum, creating an uncomfortable feeling like a rapidly filling balloon pressing on his lungs.
“And the same for you, you know that, right? I’ve got you. Whatever you need,” Dean whispered.
“What I said earlier, it was cruel…” Dean breathed out, his eyes closed, regret spilling over his face.
“You should go to the hospital,” Dean had said, but Cas just shook his head. He said that he would keep an eye on it, but that he really felt fine. Dean hadn’t looked convinced but nodded once before disappearing back into his room.
Her face dropped and she closed her eyes.
“Anything. Tell me your dating profile bio. For example,” he said, gesturing to himself, “My name is Dean Winchester. I’m twenty-one years old. I’m an Aquarius. I enjoy sunsets, long-walks on the beach and frisky women. And men.” Dean said. Castiel could have sworn the other man’s eyes flickered to his at that last part. His heart rate tripled, and he could feel it beating insistently at the back of his throat.
Good morning wonderful human beings!
“What?” Dean wasn’t even angry, just completely floored.
He undressed quickly and hopped into the shower. He cursed when the first weak splatters of water bounced off his skin – the water pressure was truly awful.
It was very dark in his room, so dark that he could barely see the outline of the pillows below him.
“You slept in a tent the whole time you were in South Africa?” Dean asked, eyes wide.
Dean watched as the memories came back to him, saw the dawning horror and the fear that froze his movements.
icon. He only managed to look at the photos once this time before another external force acted upon him.
Dean’s eyebrows furrowed, “Uhh… what?”
The silence that came after was ear-splitting. Missouri stared at him: no anger, no frustration, just an exceptionally neutral look. Somehow, this seemed to slightly lessen the intensity of the thunder in his veins.
“Dean, there’s a reason your mind has done this, and until you are ready to remember, it won’t do you any favors to try to force your mind into recalling those days.”
And, even then, he still did not always get to say what he wanted to, and often needed to say. A part of him was always on guard, keeping his walls up. He had no idea how to talk about things of this nature when the stakes were not apocalyptically high. Which, he guessed, was as good a starting point as any.
Given the early hour, he was very surprised to hear a soft knock on the door. He jumped upright, heart beating fast. But when the door creaked open, it was not Dean, but Charlie.
“I’m no good with words, so I’m sorry if I’m about to fuck up, but I just want you to know… I’m really grateful you’re alive. I’m really happy I got to meet you.”
. Look, you don’t have to talk to me about it, but you should talk to someone. You haven’t looked this… I don’t know… out of it? Not since I’ve met you. And given where we are…”
Perhaps this information would help in some way. Castiel was not a doctor, he wouldn’t know.
He threw the comforter off himself and suddenly felt immense relief that he got here first yesterday - the room with the queen bed was the only room that had an en-suite bathroom. There was just no way he’d be able to cross the small apartment in his washed out and threadbare boxers with a hard on. The mere thought of it had him grimacing.
Cas hummed and in the same hushed tone replied, “In this life. And in the next.”
Castiel huffed out a laugh. It would have been easy to dismiss the comment as arrogant, but Castiel could see the relief in Dean’s eyes. Bravado can be a great shield.
His entire body was vibrating with energy. He was finally leaving today.
He also knew that he was incapable of stopping any of it.
When he felt like he could speak again, he looked at Amara, “I want to see him.”
Cas hadn’t eaten a proper meal in what felt like days. He realized that he was absolutely starving. So, steeling himself for the wrath that is Dean Winchester, he opened his door and shuffled towards the fridge.
TW: Physical abuse, blood, major character serious injury (not Cas or Dean), car accident.
“Sorry, I didn’t mean to wake you,” Castiel whispered, settling himself across from Dean who was still blinking at him sleepily.
“A multitude of things,” Castiel admitted, fisting the comforter.
He knew Dean was very tactile, found physical touch to be very reassuring, very calming. And for a second there, Dean seemed to lean into the touch. But suddenly, he became very rigid. He jumped upright, as if he had touched an exposed wire, the movement rapid and unexpected. Castiel stumbled backwards a bit as he lost his balance.
Dean pulled at his hair and closed his eyes, trying to think through this clearly, trying not to address this reactively.
what they did,
“Hey, you weren’t selfish,” Dean scolded.
And then, “Of course.”
“I’ll break his legs. I swear to Lucifer…” Meg interrupted.
… it felt good, and it was drowning out everything else, and Dean wanted
Everything
. It was too soon for that. Absolutely too soon.
He heard a giggle coming from behind him, “Annoying the good doctor on our first day are we?”
Cas’ PhD supervisor, a wild and eccentric man by the name of Dr. Devereaux had enlisted a bunch of his top Zoology grad students - which consisted of himself, Meg and Balthazar – to assist in a research expedition to South Africa. The research they would be conducting and assisting in would hopefully lay the groundwork for an African Lion conservation project Dr. Devereux and Dr. Fox, a local professor, wanted to present and hopefully attain grants for. The three grad students and the two professors spent the past two weeks collecting data and in their free time, going on game drives and attending social events with the local game rangers. It was any zoologist’s dream to see the South African
But Dean didn’t hear any of this. The buzzing in his head returned tenfold, and he could barely hear himself thinking.
Dean, Sam, Eileen and Jack finalize and execute their plan.
She shook her head but then took a deep breath in and nodded. She looked slightly green as she glanced down at her pages again.
“No, I didn’t have one today. She had a family thing and rescheduled for tomorrow.”
“Maybe I don’t quite know what to say,” Dean admitted, “But, I didn’t leave. I showed up here, in your doorway.”
“This is turkey bacon,” Dean said pointedly ignoring Sam, “and this is the good stuff”. Dean pointed at another plate and winked at Eileen. Eileen smiled gratefully and grabbed a plate, Sam followed suit and Dean sat down with his coffee.
Dean was not proud of what he did next.
“But I can’t
Thank you to Hellbreaker42 for being an awesome beta. All remaining mistakes are my own.
ago. Dean is the only idiot in the world whose heart would still beat solely for a person who left it battered and bruised that long ago. Dean has just never been the type of person that was good at letting people go.
“Yes,” Castiel nodded and took a seat at the desk, “it’s very daunting for him. Max was admitted here three months ago. He lost both his mother and his twin sister in the space of a month. The grief of that... it wasn’t something he wanted to feel. He overdosed six weeks after his sister’s funeral.”
“Heya, Dean,” Charlie appeared in the doorway. “Amara said I should give you this.”
Dean felt rooted to the spot, his arms shaking violently. Of course, of fucking course, Cas would be reliving this moment. Dean took a very deep breath and headed down the hall and towards the memory that had physically cracked his heart down the middle.
He just wanted to see Sam.
“Nah,” Dean replied, “I like them.”
Meg was slowly returning to her normal self. The worry lines that had seemed carved into her face appeared to be shallower, the shadows under her eyes were dissolving, the gaunt look in her face less prominent every time Castiel saw her. Furthermore, he had Gabriel back. His older brother slipped so easily back into his life, transitioned back into his role seamlessly.
“I…” Dean started to object.
I googled the process of becoming a firefighter in the USA so if I got the details wrong, I do apologize.
Dean grinned as he dipped down to grab the shirt Castiel had dropped and immediately set to folding it. After what seemed too short a time to pack up a place he had stayed for so long, Castiel sat down onto his bed and stared at his suitcases lined up neatly next to the door.  He closed his eyes and breathed deeply.
tonight. She also prescribed him a mild sedative to help him sleep.”
“You’re right. I just, sitting here with him like this… It’s difficult to not feel like a failure, you know? And I hate the idea of him being there, being out of reach.” Dean whispered softly sitting back down and leaning his head on the back of the couch.
“That has never happened before, ever,” Cas said emphatically, raising a singular eyebrow at Dean.
And then there was Dean.
“Not sure?” Castiel’s voice was barely above a whisper. The soft sound somehow incongruous with the bright sun streaming through their window – the security bars casting a strange shadow pattern on the floor.
By his first Thursday, he was getting comfortable with this weird life he was now living; this limbo space he was currently occupying. He was comfortable enough that when he opened his eyes that morning, he didn’t scramble to find where he was and didn’t jump up in a panic because he had overslept; he just rolled onto his back and lazily stretched his arms and legs.
“Kind of like how circuses train their elephants.” Sam said, his features oddly blank.
“I’m not naked,” Cas countered.
Cas’ home page loaded faster than Dean had anticipated.
The wedding was postponed on three separate occasions due to covid related travel restrictions.
Castiel’s head snapped up at Dean’s confession. He looked at Dean questioningly.
Dean’s eyes were burning, and he blinked as two tears brimmed over. He laughed lowly, “there just never seems to be an after.”
“Awesome, so can we do this?” Dean asked as his eyes twitched towards Cas.
This wasn’t the real Dean.
He still could not breathe.
“Nothing,” Dean mumbled, biting back the urge to wince again.
Dean used his free hand to start picking at his jeans. “Yeah, I can’t remember the week before I woke up in the hospital. Even my early days there are very fuzzy. Amara told me there was an accident…” Dean swallowed heavily, “ I don’t really wanna talk about it.”
“Dean. He seemed,” Cas started, after the two had sat in silence for a while, “he seemed angry.”
It was a picture of Dean with his arm thrown around his brother, both of them smiling widely at the camera.
“I love you so much Castiel Winchester,” Dean had whispered with his eyes closed.
Dean grinned, “I already think you’re awesome. I just think now you’ll be awesome and happy. You deserve to live a life you chose. A happy life.”
It’s not like he could cook anyway.
She talked and talked.
“Would it hurt Dean?” Sam asked just as Dean was about to insist they get this show on the road.
After a while, and a lot more head banging, he realized it was a losing battle. It seemed like both his biology and his brain were dead set on making his life hell.
“What is this?” Dean’s heart fluttered. Cas had remembered Peter Pan.
, if they weren’t the most beautiful eyes he had ever seen. The dark green eyes, alive with curiosity and something that he couldn’t quite place, framed by dark eyelashes that seemed like they could not exist naturally. Castiel blinked slowly, and the rest of the stranger’s face came into view. A constellation of freckles and on creamy skin, short caramel hair that framed cheekbones that Castiel was sure poets could write sonnets about.
Sam turned to look at him, huffing out as if the movement exhausted him, and locked his eyes on his brother.
He immediately understood why Missouri had insisted that he be forewarned about Sam’s appearance. Even fully warned, his heart twisted at the sight of his little brother.
“Hey kid,” Dean grunted as he got up and ruffled Jack’s hair, “we missed you.”
It was probably a testament to the fact that Chuck was no longer writing their lives, as for once the plan went off without a hitch. After entering the Empty, the amulet around Dean’s neck had lifted in the air and immediately started pulling Dean in a direction. And Dean had focused on that. He had never been claustrophobic, but the complete darkness felt like a weight on him. He was grateful for the occasional flash of light behind him, a reminder that his brother was there with him and would be his guide back. Dean followed the angelic compass. He ran for what had seemed like an hour (although he couldn’t tell exactly) when the amulet suddenly plunged down and froze, a couple of inches away from Dean’s body.
“I remember, Cas. I remember everything.” Dean choked out, his voice gravelly.
He walked back to the bedroom and grabbed his phone where it was resting on the coffee-brown side table, still plugged in to the charger in the wall. As he walked back into the bathroom, he opened
Dean was only human after all.
Castiel tried to will the blush to leave his face. He did not know how to talk about Dean, how to be candid about something he had been told for so long he needed to hide, to bury.
. It wasn't enough, though. There was so much more that they needed to consider, so much they had to understand. Frustration at the size of the task ahead of them, and without Cas there to calm him down, Dean’s factory setting of anger took over.
in a way he couldn’t quite figure out how to explain.
“Dean, I need you to understand that everything I have done, and everything I will do, is what I believe is in your best interest. You are my patient. My sole purpose is to make sure you are okay. And I also know that, now that you have allowed yourself to remember, keeping any information regarding your brother’s medical condition will not serve your best interest.”
Cas squeezed Dean’s hand softly.
“For what it’s worth, I missed you too,” Bobby said gruffly, “but not in the same way as him.”
Cas shook his head slightly. “Sorry, that is just an unexpected offer.”
“But don’t worry. It will die down quickly.”
“But there is one thing, if you don’t mind my asking.” Castiel concluded.
“A while. We’ll be at the hospital in twenty minutes,” Bobby replied. “Are you sure you don’t want to go home first?”
What can he say? Dean was a sucker for a man in a suit.
“No need to thank me,” Castiel grinned tenderly. Dean’s answering smile wasn’t his usual earth-shattering beam of light, but it was more real than the one he had had when Castiel first walked in. Castiel tangled their legs together and traced Dean’s eyelids with his index finger. He could see how sleep was tugging at Dean’s lids, how it took a little longer each time for them to open after he blinked.
“Cas?” Dean broke the silence, his face a mirror of his own disbelief.
“Dean, I am just happy that you want me involved at all,” Castiel said with the air of someone confessing something very private.
Another beat.
Huh, this whole God thing had some perks.
“It is?”
on his laptop, he tried playing games on his phone but nothing,
The weird tense and charged energy that now encircled them when Cas stared at Dean and Dean ignored him, made it feel like a small current of electricity was running over his skin. He was so keyed up by the atmosphere and by Cas’ presence in the other room that he seemed completely incapable of staying fucking still.
notifications. He knew they were pictures Meg had likely posted of their research trip. She had been attached to her camera for the fourteen days they were there. He also knew that if he did not like and comment on the photos (something incredibly clever and unendingly witty), Meg would be deeply unimpressed.
“Who are you?”
Dean hung up and stretched out on the couch. He knew Sam meant well, but he could barely admit to himself how deep his feelings for Cas still ran. He didn’t like thinking about it - how a part of him cracked when they broke. And usually, he was pretty good at not thinking about it, by drowning himself in work or finding other distractions.
Cas expected a fight, expected Dean to flip him off playfully and say that they were fine. Dean did not act as had Cas expected. Instead, he walked straight towards him, pulled Cas into another hug and replied, “Yeah man. We really need to talk.”
Dean’s eyes flicked to her, and she just shrugged. He couldn’t help the grin that spread across his face. “Speaking from experience, are we?”
(See the end of the chapter for
The ghosts in Dean’s apartment were ones Dean never felt the need to face. During the six months of Sam’s recovery, they stayed at Bobby’s, but once Sam was up and running again, the small space became a little cramped with three grown men sauntering around.
Dean switched on the radio, and the familiar sounds of Led Zeppelin filled the car. He hummed along to the melody while avoiding eye contact with Cas. He could feel his blue eyes boring into the side of his face.
“Cas?” Dean asked, completely ignoring the other three people in the room.
“Is he okay?” He asked, as he sat down.
It had taken six months of therapies and rehabilitation after the incident before Sam fully recovered. He had to repeat a year in school, but that didn’t stop him from absolutely excelling once he was back on his feet. His acceptance letter to Stanford was currently stuck to the fridge with a cowboy shaped magnet that Cas bought for Dean after they had spent a weekend in Dodge City.
Castiel couldn’t do anything right now. He didn’t know how to help. But he did know that Dean did not mean what he was saying.
was defined by him constantly counting down the hours to his release while simultaneously berating himself for worrying about the hours left instead of actually experiencing them. It was an absolutely torturous cycle that he seemed completely incapable of getting himself out of. Pamela, in their last session, had informed him that this was natural and that he shouldn't be so hard on himself. Which, of course, was easier said than done. Castiel had made progress while he was here, but he was still human.
“I trust you Dean,” he whispered, a prayer into the otherwise silent room.
(See the end of the chapter for
“But that is no excuse, I know. I’m
The first thought Dean had when he awoke was that he must have fucked up in a monumental way in his past life for him to be punished this severely by the universe.
Dean shook his head. “That happened on the way home from the hospital.”
“You too, Cas. You have to know that. I’m falling in love with you, too. Of course, I am. How could I not?” Dean was babbling, and the words poured like honey into Castiel’s ear. He smiled as he switched their positions, effectively trapping Dean below him, his back flat against the mattress. He pushed his thigh in between Dean’s legs as he leaned on his arms which were framing Dean’s face.
“Castiel, why are you awake?” Stevie asked as he approached her desk.
“Where were you going?” He mumbled while wiping at his eyes with his left hand. “Fucking off to the club I’m not allowed to join?”
It was the closest they had come to addressing the separation, but when Castiel looked into the green eyes of the man who had reminded him what it was like to really be alive, he also knew that not all conversations need to be had out loud.
“Well yeah, it was,” Dean said after his laughter died out, “but now, I don’t know what to do. I feel like I need some time to just think about it, but I can’t because he’s
“That is a brilliant plan, Dean,” Cas said, a smile pulling at the corner of his lip.  He had never thought that he would get to have this again. To experience the complete bliss of having Dean and having his son back.
And Cas knew that this was stupid, wrong, pathetic. He knew this, down to the very marrow of his bones he knew this. But in the weeks and months that followed
“I know, but this is quite a distance from the University. I feel horrible that you feel the need to drive this far each weekend.”
“You let me take the easy way out,” Dean heard himself say, faster than he could process the words tumbling out of his mouth. “You let me go away, somewhere far away from the consequences of my actions.”
Dean looked up as Cas entered the room with two shopping bags. He stopped dead in his tracks when he saw Sam’s gaze land on him.
Dean nodded, eyes staying closed this time. Castiel counted his breaths, but before he reached ten, he joined Dean in unconsciousness.
“What am I supposed to do?”
“Is the bed gonna be okay?” Dean asked.
The quote Dean wrote in the cover of the notebook is from the book
It had taken a while to get used to things as they were now. And, for the duration of his stay so far, there had only ever been seven patients, including himself, and the staff worked on rotation. But, there hadn’t been any change in the nurses he was dealing with. Everything ran very predictably, so he didn’t have any right to complain.
“We’ve established that you don’t need to apologize. But would you like to talk about it?”
“Dean, you are like a hurricane; you are loud, attention-grabbing, and you leave chaos in your wake,” Cas gestured at Dean’s side of the room that was littered with books, clothes (both dirty and clean) and the drafts of the letters he was writing to Sam spilled all over the floor.
Furthermore, Dean fought the urge to grab said creamer and make Cas a cup of coffee. With two sugars.
“Thanks, Cas,”
Exactly two hours later, Dean was pulling a necklace with an amulet glowing with Cas’ grace over his head. He had felt weird after Jack had pulled Cas’ grace from his body, it had not been painful exactly, but Dean did definitely feel as if something was missing.
It was a good photo. Great, even. It really, really was.
overnight. And he had been nowhere near as … he hadn’t been this bad last time.
“Dean, I may be wrong, but I think you have psychogenic amnesia. Or dissociative amnesia. Your brain has made the decision not to remember a couple of days leading up to the accident. We will obviously do some tests…”
Fuck, Dean loved the way Cas looked at him.
He could only hear her side of the conversation, but when it seemed to be drawing to a close, he blurted out, “He wants to see Amara. He keeps saying that.”
afford to say. The words that pressed at the back of his throat, urgently pushing to be freed.
A great big thank you to Hellbreaker42 for his amazing beta work! You are awesome and I don't deserve you!
He had barely been able to sleep the night before, a deeply unsettling mixture of jet-lag and well -
“Castiel, I’m going to Dean now. But I want you to please go find Linda, she’s in the kitchen, and have her meet me in your room, okay?”
Dean opened the photo. It was a selfie of Sam and Eileen, their arms wrapped around each other where they stood outside a little café. Dean couldn’t help the grin that spread over his face as he saw the unadulterated
Cas, however, with his comforting hand placed on Dean’s lower back, had encouraged him to go with her. He had assured Dean that he would be right there when he got back later, that he would be right next to him when Amara arrived in a couple of hours. After this reassurance, Dean had let himself, albeit grudgingly, be led away.
“Of course, Dean.”
“I’m going after Cas. Drag his ass back to where he belongs” Dean said simply, and the fact that he had something to do was already lifting some of the heaviness inside him.
But seeing as he was being punished, he had, of course, awoken with the most intense case of morning wood he’s had in – fuck –
“Jesus, Cas. What’s wrong? What’s happening?”
“What?” Dean snapped, the calm uncoiling in front of Castiel’s eyes. The rigidity bled into uncontrolled movement. He was shaking, fidgeting, flexing his fingers.
“Yeah, sure, because chaos wears a hoodie and slippers at five thirty pm,” the sarcasm fell off the man’s lips.
“Yes, Dean. You’re exhausted,” Cas’ finger dropped to ghost over the shadows beneath Dean’s eyes. The touch so gentle that Dean’s throat constricted.
What would have happened to him if Dean had just fucking upped and
People aren’t flattered when you remain hopelessly in love with them years after the relationship disintegrated. They file restraining orders and try to force you into court ordered therapy. That’s what Gabriel told him, at least.
Cas was everything to Dean.
Meg looked over to Gabriel who looked extremely uncomfortable.
to see Meg, to see Gabriel. There was nothing muted about him today.
Thanks for reading :) x
“The accident? You caused it?” Castiel asked, the cold feeling intensifying, his blood turning into ice in his veins.
“Yeah?” Sam asked, eyes jumping to Dean.
“You seem more anxious than usual today,” Missouri noted in her never-changing neutral tone.
“You make me feel so many things, Dean,” Castiel eventually said, gently squeezing his fingers with his own. “For so long, I didn’t feel anything. I felt like I was a
Thank you so much for reading!
Welcome back and thank you for joining!
“Why does Charlie need Dean?” Castiel asked, as he walked up behind Dean.
Dean averted his eyes and stared hard at the faded mustard yellow carpet and huffed in his general direction. That counted as a greeting, right?
Cas was the one babbling this time.
“You create your own prisons,” Castiel said wearily, “You make everything your sole responsibility. You create situations that force you into a state of mental isolation. Usually then you only rely on those closest to you, if they aren’t the ones you are hiding from. I just don’t know what I did that made you believe I wasn’t one of those you could take into your confidence.
Cas’ eyes dulled a little, the joy and relief fading from his gaze. And Dean wanted to stop himself. He really did. He wanted to stop the venomous words suddenly exploding in his head, fighting their way forward. But he could not stop. And he was tired. He was tired of fighting the feelings. Tired of trying to control his emotions and thoughts.
They decided to play a game after everyone had cleaned up and made coffee.Claire chose first, and she chose
Dean’s throat pulled tight and he blinked fast, hoping to stop the tears from escaping where they were burning his eyes.
“I’ll call for him, while I’m running,” Dean countered weakly, restating the previous argument with no better logic. Sam could tell by the look on his face that Dean did not really have a plan, he just wanted to get moving.
“New rule: you are to be fully clothed at all times while in the common areas,” Dean spat as he hurried to the kitchenette. He kept his back to Cas as he started pulling ingredients for breakfast from the fridge.
“Yeah, no, I don’t buy that.”
It was evident in the way they held onto each other, in the way they reached for each other in both moments of fear and in moments of peace.
Castiel had barely slept when the alarm clock next to his bed went off. He sighed and blinked, opening his heavy lids. After breakfast, he would have to bare his soul to no less than eight people, discuss moments he would rather erase from his narrative. But, he trusted Amara and Pamela. And more than that, he promised Meg he would give his all to this program.
“What are you referring to?” Cas asked, fully turning on his side, so that his body was mirroring Dean’s.
Which it obviously didn’t because no matter how much Dean tried to think of the most frigid images he could imagine, his traitorous dick showed no signs of softening.
“So, what had you guys looking so mopey?” Eileen asked as she took a sip of coffee.
Dean’s entire body erupted in goose bumps, and his hips bucked up on their own accord. How did having something so holy in his sight make him want to do such filthy things.  Cas’ eyes glinted with mischief and adoration.
“Slow down,” Dean warned. “You’re going to make yourself sick.” He slowly held the bottle out again, and Sam lifted it to his mouth. Dean noticed his arms shaking, his muscle straining with the effort of lifting the plastic after nearly ten weeks of disuse.
It was past what was considered a reasonable time for dinner, but Dean hadn’t come out of his room. Perhaps Cas’ constant verbal poking and insistence that they talk annoyed him more than his desire for food. He would likely emerge later once he believed Cas had gone to bed. But Cas would be here. Right fucking here. He could outwait Dean; he had five years of insomniac nights as practice.
with Cas, but… should Dean check on him or ignore it?
It was Monday, so he had spent an extra two nights at
“Not like demons, or whatever. I mean, yes, technically, demons, but I don’t think I’m about to be possessed by a demon or whatever. But people can get possessed by other things and can become overwhelmed by shit. It’s like a reminder to stay true to myself, to not let the bad shit that happens take control of me. I don’t know. I’m not very good with words and explanations.”
Sam’s judgy face like he was sitting right next to him.
“Listen lady…”
The kiss deepened, became more frantic, become a mess of moving arms and legs, reaching and grasping all in an attempt to get closer, closer, closer. When Dean’s head started spinning, he reluctantly pulled away from Cas to draw in a few very deep breaths in rapid succession. Cas used this opportunity to attach himself to Dean’s neck, licking his way up his throat until he reached his jaw. Dean was panting again, eyes rolling back in his head as Cas gently tugged Dean’s earlobe with his teeth.
“No, man,” Dean said. “Don’t apologize. I just realized that I shouldn’t, you know, like, push you, or anything. I know that. I’ve been with someone before who had some issues, no offense, with that side of himself. And touching for comfort versus flirting is different…”
Without further ado... Let's see what our boys are up to.
Stevie shot him a look and then nodded again sharply. “Apparently he is asking for Amara. Is she close by?... Okay…. Yeah… I’ll let him know.”
Being around him, seeing him, hearing him, smelling him… It was all too much. Too much sense memory. Too painful. Too overwhelming.
’ by the Lonely Island. I can do either, just let me know what you need.”
Dean watched his movements closely but remained silent. Deathly silent.
“What?” Cas asked, anxiety induced adrenaline pumping alongside his blood.
“It’s so good to see you my friend,” Cas said as he placed his hand on Sam’s shoulder.
And then she was gone.
“Baby,” the word slipped out, soft and unfamiliar. Dean’s whole body ached.
He opened his mouth but luckily was saved from replying by Claire dropping into the seat next to Dean’s.
“Wait,” Dean said, pulling away from Cas slightly to look him in the eye.
He had felt a flame of blistering anger licking through him when Castiel spoke of how his brother had left him. Twice. He knew it wasn’t rational to feel this level of emotions about a man he had never met and whose personal story wasn’t familiar to him, but when he closed his eyes now, all he could see was
“Well right, how about we regroup in the war room in about an hour?” Dean asked. There was a murmured agreement.
“I didn’t – I wasn’t trying to – “
He thought of Cas.
“Where is he now?” Eileen asks, looking at Jack.
. And at night, they would all do something fun together, like watch a movie or play board games. Dean had been delighted, and admittedly shocked, to find that
“Sorry, Bobby.” Dean called, although he wasn’t sorry, not really. He was very anxious about going to the hospital and he knew that being closer to Cas would help ease that burning ache that clawed at him each time he thought of his brother.
(See the end of the chapter for
Jody sobbed loudly. Dean squeezed Castiel’s hand bone-crushingly tight. And when Castiel glanced at him, he had gone completely rigid, his face seemed bleached of all color. Castiel blanched a little; he had never seen Dean look like that. When he noticed Castiel staring, he shook his head lightly and then smiled in reassurance. The smile seemed real enough. Castiel ran his thumb along Dean’s and then turned back to Jody.
“Okay,” Dean’s voice was gruff and scared.
“So, that’s what you were staring at this morning. I just thought you liked looking at me without a shirt on.” Dean winked. Cas blushed and bit his bottom lip.
It was the wrong thing to say.
Dean catalogued him as he stood in the silent room, save for the wonderful beeping that reminded Dean that his brother’s heart was still beating. His hair was dirtier than he usually let it get, the bald spot was almost completely covered – although there still were some wires stuck in his hairline. Both of his arms were scattered with the deep blue and purple of fresh bruises as well as the yellowing green marks of older ones. His face was thinner, the bones seemingly wanting to protrude from his skin which looked paper thin and somewhat translucent. The last thing he noted was the round, plastic tube leading out of Sam’s nostrils, hooked up to one of the multitudes of unfamiliar machines behind his bed.
“I didn’t want to set you back. It’s what I had to discuss with Charlie last weekend,” Meg said, biting her thumbnail. Castiel looked at her, really looked at her, and he could feel the unease that was clinging to her radiating towards him. What an unbelievably difficult situation she must be in.
And so, he trusted her.
Bobby had also never seen Dean cry.
“That’s creepy. Come here.”
Castiel and Dean didn’t get another chance to talk that evening, but Castiel was hyper aware of every movement Dean made, relishing every accidental bump of their legs or arms. And every time he glanced in his direction, Dean was already looking at him.
“Okay. It was one of the worst and best experiences of my life. It was complicated and messy but necessary. I needed to be there. I needed to fix – “
“Well, I’ve been thinking about it, but haven’t done a lot of research,” Sam said, “Getting Cas back was priority number one.”
More than.
He couldn’t cry now.
“Dean?” Cas asked groggily.
And so, that is exactly what he did.
Long before he was ready, he was face-to-face with the white, stale-smelling curtains. He took a deep breath and let it out slowly and then pulled them away.
“No, absolutely not. The more the merrier,” Dean said happily. She smiled widely at him.
“He’s not a good man, Cas, and he hurt me and let me down in ways I can’t even…” Dean bit the inside of his cheek and rubbed his hands on his thighs, “anyway, life sucks and then you die, right?”
“Get some rest,” she said.
“I am embarrassingly aware of when you touch me. I just wanted to know why.” Castiel dropped his eyes to his knees, not daring to look at Dean.
“He told me that you would never put Sam in a position of being without you.”
Thanks for reading :)
“Well, not purposely but he did.” Eileen said, smiling at Dean, “You.”
“Yes, you were having a nightmare,” Cas replied softly, the sound of his voice warmed Dean from the inside. Dean flushed instinctively and tensed, embarrassed at having had Cas see him in such a vulnerable manner - all his defenses down. Cas, obviously having sensed the rigidity, started withdrawing his hand from Dean’s shoulder. The thumping in his chest escalated at the thought of not having Cas’ hand on him. He knew that he wanted to let Cas in, he just had to get used to the idea that vulnerability did not mean weakness. Not when it came to this angel. Dean darted his hand out and stopped Cas’ retreat. He pulled the angel’s hand back toward him and lower than the original position, placing it over his heart. Cas shifted closer to him, draping his other arm across Dean as well, covering the expanse of his shoulder. Cas used the fingers on the hand Dean had placed over his heart to gently tap out the rhythm of the human’s heartbeat. Dean tried not to think about how much safer he felt having Cas this close. He also avoided analyzing why the gentle taping of the angel’s fingers on his chest seemed to soothe his racing pulse. He avoided thinking about all of it, just felt it. Experienced it, experienced Cas in this new way.
“Well, when the souls got loose, they went back to their bodies right? Like long distance magnets?” Eileen said, resolve settling on her face as she became clearer on what she wanted to say.
“Tomorrow?” Cas asked, hating how broken and small he sounded.
Dean nodded, slowly, eyes never leaving Cas’ face.
“Of course, Castiel,” Gabriel said solemnly, “I should have been here sooner. Shouldn’t have left at all, if you want to get into it.”
“Cas?” He said louder and he heard footsteps rushing towards him from outside. The door creaked open, and then Cas was there, standing in his boxers and one of Dean’s old t-shirts, holding out a cup of steaming coffee.
Meg let out an irritated sound, “I told you I would get him here, didn’t I?”
“That’s all good and well,” Dean stated, “but last time I checked Cas didn’t just leave an ‘in case of emergency’ grace stash."
Cas looked at him, “You think I will be awesome?”
And all of that was true, it just wasn’t the whole truth.
“And so, the dead finally rises,” Sam called jokingly as he spooned the bacon from the large skillet he was holding.
Please remember that the epilogue will be posted tomorrow!
“You haven’t mentioned him before,” Hannah noted.
Dean made a soft choking sound, and Castiel drew him tighter. Castiel kissed the back of his neck and then kissed a line down his shoulder. Light, grounding gestures.
Cas looked contemplative, his gaze never drifting from Dean’s face, “I can understand that."
“So, you want me to record familiar stories?” Dean clarified. He recalled the doctor in the ER saying something similar.
And then she started talking.

Dean twisted himself a little so that his face could fit more securely in the juncture between Castiel’s neck and shoulder. Castiel ran his hand up and down Dean’s back.
Castiel blanched. How had he known?
by Madeline Miller.
“So,” Cas started. “Where are we going for your celebratory lunch?”
And hers were compounded because she had first-hand experience of what he looked like when he fell, of when he broke. Castiel felt shaken by one night of worrying, one sleepless night, and yet, Meg had endured it night after night, not once complaining, not once asking for help. She worried for him. She loved him.
Sorry this chapter is a little on the short side, but I thought Dean's emotional processing deserved its own chapter. Also, please note that this chapter references S13e06 - Tombstone
“I’m fine,” Castiel said, plastering a smile onto his face.
“Once I knew Alex was going to be fine, I deteriorated. I just felt this dark pit inside me all the time; I just kept thinking about how I failed as a mother. Again. The near-loss of Alex reopened the wounds of losing Sean and Owen. And after Alex was released back home, I just kept getting worse and worse. I tried to be there for her, but I was just so stuck inside myself, simmering in my fear and in my failure. Donna came to get me when I hadn’t left my room in three days, not for food, not to change clothes, not to shower or go to work. She just packed some of my things into one of her duffels and then Alex’s things into another one. She dropped Alex at her place and brought me here.”
“I’m not sure exactly. Something in you shifted when he helped us after I let Lucifer out,” Sam winced, the old mistake still a tender subject, “But I can’t say that I realized then, or if that was the moment that something developed, but I noticed a difference then.”
Sam and Eileen shared a look that was so pointed, that Dean felt the need to clear his throat.
“Hi,” Castiel responded after what would have been considered a slightly too long pause.
Thank you so much to everyone who has read, left kudos, subscribed and commented on this fic! It means so much to me and I appreciate each and every one of you :).
“Hey uh, Cas, would you stay?” Dean inwardly cringed at how shaky his voice sounded.
deserves that. Ever. Kids deserve to be loved, cared for, accepted and protected, both physically and emotionally. So, you did not deserve that.”
“Tomorrow marks six weeks,” Castiel replied softly.
“Dude, all through dinner and the movie you just had this hella vacant look. You didn’t even once try to point out the mathematical and scientific improbabilities of the

And then Dean was storming out of his brother’s room, ignoring the calls following him to his room. He was able to lock the door behind him before the dam of emotions he had been holding back for the better part of a decade collapsed.
“I’m sorry, Cas. I didn’t mean to push.”
“Don’t get too comfortable,” Dean’s icy voice finally broke the silence.
Dean had insisted that Castiel stay with him tonight. In an
He opened the app on his phone, but before he was able to click the notifications button, the first picture on his feed drew his attention.
“I plan on getting very well acquainted with those teeth,” Dean said a little breathlessly. Cas laughed softly and placed a kiss in the hollow behind Dean’s ear.
Cas immediately started signing to the girl who looked a little nervous being around so many strangers, but still held her space comfortably.
Cas was dizzy with desire; his entire body felt like it was electrified. He shoved Dean’s underwear and jeans out of the way so that he could close his right hand on his cock. Dean hissed and pulled his mouth away the second Cas’ hand wrapped around him. He closed his eyes and dropped his head back onto the wall, his hands digging painfully into Cas’ biceps. Good. He wanted bruises. He wanted to remember this.
Which, when you were in a self-imposed lockdown in a tiny-ass room, was less than ideal. In between his stoic-faced journeys to the kitchen, he tried to entertain himself. He tried to read, he tried to watch

When he let the air out, he opened his eyes and stared hard at Amara. “And what did he say?”
“Dean, calm down,” Missouri said in a way that would normally have been soothing, but right now was only adding gasoline to the fire raging inside him.
“I think three or something,” Dean said pushing past Sam and going to sit on the chair opposite the bed.
“Oh, my god, you remembered what happened to you, didn’t you?”
“Fuck.”
Thanks for reading and see you all next week!

Dean shook his head. “Not really. But, I didn’t really care either. All I could think about was that stupid ‘If’, and there was John just not …”
into the hamper that stood next to the trash can at the foot of Cas’ bed.
“You can go back to sleep, Dean."
Castiel sat on his bed. He placed his hands on his knees and closed his eyes. He breathed in deeply through his nose, counting the four seconds out slowly.
I hope you all had a lovely week and that everyone is staying safe. Thank you so much to everyone who has left kudos and comments on this fic, it is greatly appreciated. And just a general thank you to anyone who takes the time to read this :)
He shrugged off his trench coat and hung it up on the coat rack, next to a green jacket that must have been Dean’s.
Castiel had been right to check in with Jody.

by Secondhand Serenade.
There was something about Jack’s confidence that leaked into Dean, fueling the ember of hope Sam had planted last night. Jack looked nervous, still glancing between the Winchester brothers.
They had done it. Them. Dean and Sam had finally taken down Chuck. They had ended it,
Gabriel looked at him.
The thing is, when Dean had first seen Cas, his heart lifted. It felt like a breath that had been stuck inside him for years was finally able to escape. It was overwhelming seeing him, sure, but it was like a part of him had been waiting for Cas for years. And when Dean saw him, it was like a part of his soul reached for Cas, had whispered
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m scared,” Dean admitted. He still found it hard to say things honestly, but it was easier now. Easier with Cas, especially.
“We knew you’d want to save him. And we want to help,” Eileen said gesturing to the file.
Cas turned toward him. He interlocked his fingers and placed them on Dean’s chest and then rested his head on the pillow they created.
“Dean,” Cas groaned, hips rolling forward. Dean smirked as he continued moving his lips on Cas’ skin.
“Hey, look at me,” Castiel tipped Dean’s jaw with his fingers, “you did nothing wrong. You were in a weird place last night, and you were looking for comfort. And when it was something I couldn’t give you, you listened when I spoke. Dean, I’m the one who’s sorry…”
“I don’t think ‘finders keepers’ applies in this situation.”
Dean studied him for a minute before a small smile appeared on his face, “It’s not like it’s your first time sleeping on a couch.”
“Well, if memory serves me right, most nights I snuck off that couch and into your bed,” Cas said without thinking. He immediately went rigid as he processed his own words. He cringed internally,
Jack looked at all of them and a huge smile lit up his face, “I want that too.”
Castiel pointed his head in the direction of the cafeteria. Dean immediately started walking that way and Castiel fell into an easy step next to him.
He was Dean’s home too. There was no point in denying it. Not now, not after everything. And Dean could not even pinpoint exactly when it had happened, when the blue eyes pierced through the fortress around his battered and bruised heart. He couldn’t remember the exact day the walls crumbled, the moment Cas crossed the threshold and took his place next to Sam, like he had always belonged there. Like he had always been a part of the rawest crevices of Dean’s heart. But all Dean knew was that that part belonged to Cas now. And now that he was gone, now that he was in the Empty, he would never be whole again.
“No Cas, don’t try make this better okay? I let Jack down. I did. And it’s not like what I said is true. I told Sam that Jack wasn’t family. But of course he is, of course. I was just so blinded with rage and it…” Dean felt his throat tighten.
“Do you want to talk about it?”
Chuck had so desperately wanted. The thought still made his stomach lurch, how close they had come to ending the story the way the writer intended. But that didn't happen. They escaped it, wrote their own way out. The victory, however, lacked the triumph it should have had and the gratitude for his brother was dulled slightly by the weight of their losses. He felt the absence of Jack and Cas acutely, the places where they were supposed to be somehow taking up more space now that they were empty. But he knew that Dean was going through something much deeper than he was.
Sam scoffed, “I’m literally following instructions Dean.”
“Hey,” Dean said, reaching his arm around and placing it on Castiel’s shoulder before pulling him into Dean’s side. Castiel dropped his head onto Dean’s shoulder and sobbed brokenly for a few seconds. Dean just held him and rested his chin on the top of Castiel’s head.
“I’m still not great with words, but every day, for the last year, I wrote down something I loved about you, or something we did that I loved.”
Cas nodded but made no move to give the damned thing to him, so Dean just grabbed it out his hand.
“The Roadhouse,” Sam said without hesitation. “But, uhm…”
smile already pasted in place.
“Yes,” Jack said beaming, and both Sam and Eileen nodded enthusiastically.
“Heya, kiddo. How are you feeling?”
Dean felt his body tense up at the sound, even full well knowing Billie could not reach them here. Not
He would tell her in his session on Wednesday.
There was a ringing silence after Amara finished speaking.
“Were you able to? Talk to her, I mean?”  Castiel asked as he took Dean’s hands into his own.
“No exactly. It’s horrible but smart because its how they get the animals to be submissive. It takes the fight out of them.” Sam continued.
Castiel noticed that Dean tended to babble when he was uncomfortable.
They drove on, comfortable silence stretching between them. Dean even dropped off for a couple of minutes while Cas was running his fingers up and down Dean’s arm.
It seemed entirely unfair to him that someone could actually look like this. And, Castiel self-consciously ran his hand through his hair that somehow never seemed to stay where he intended it to, even when he tried to look good, which, admittedly, he hadn’t in a while.
Dean rolled his eyes. “Out with it,” he demanded.
“Are you ready?
So today, he was determined to get Dean to talk to him. If he had to push, shove or full-on bang on his door for an hour straight, Dean was going to talk to him.
He was at least self-aware enough to realize that this was unhealthy and childish. He was also self-aware enough to realize he didn’t care. Not when it came to Cas.
Castiel was spiraling.
There was a knock at the door.
“After what I did to you, I didn’t know if you would’ve cared if I came back. I didn’t know if you even wanted to be around me” he said honestly, and the admission sat between the two of them, something heavy and painful.
“Just need to make a quick stop, won’t be long.”
“Yeah, totally normal. I feel totally normal towards cowboys”
“Fine, uh,” Dean glanced back to Cas’ closed door and listened for any signs that he may be awake.
Dean grinned fondly, and he continued his shaving ritual. By the time he walked back into the room, Cas was busy shrugging on a dark suit jacket over his white button-up shirt. He adjusted the knot at the top of his royal blue tie.
Bobby had barely parked the car before the front door was thrown wide open and Cas tumbled out of the front seat. He rushed towards Dean with the urgency of someone who just found a water source in the middle of the desert, not like someone who saw Dean two days prior during his final visiting hours.
“Right, Dean. Why don’t you tell me about your relationship with your father?”
“Because you would have done the same for me.”
. I'm always looking for more Heller friends. Currently, my real life friends and family are taking the brunt of my Supernatural obsession even though they don't watch the show.
Dean started fidgeting as Castiel spoke.
Cas was looking at Dean, was directly looking at him, and Dean was undone. He was coming apart, the seams ripping unceremoniously from the very fabric of his being.
“I like seeing you happy,” Dean admitted, surprising the both of them.
that he was almost goddamn shaking. He felt like every muscle was vibrating under his skin. He felt like a drawn bowstring, a shaken up fizzy drink with a stubborn lid that refused to budge.
“It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance,” Cas said, smiling at Sam. Sam looked between the two of them for a bit. When he noticed Dean softly rubbing Cas’ back, Dean saw understanding bloom in his eyes.
“With you?”
I'm hoping you are all doing well and that you've had a great week.
Dean shook his head, “No, sorry. Its just..” Dean ran a palm over the bottom half of his face.
when he lost the contact of Cas’ knee against his.
Dean was absolutely terrified that Cas would realize he was wrong about him, that he wasn’t a prize, wasn’t someone who was deserving of this level of reverence. He could barely even
“Plus, it’s not affecting me,” Dean changed the topic.
The original hug scene in this chapter was inspired by a Misha Collins Cameo that has been circulating on TikTok. In it, he was asked what he would have liked for the Dean and Cas reunion. His response was that he would have liked to have seen "the most authentic and loving hug".
once when Dean had nearly accidentally hit him when Castel woke him on Friday morning.
“Cas, I…” Dean tried to interrupt, but Castiel trailed his hand from Dean’s cheek to his lips to cover his mouth gently with his palm.
“No,” Dean sighed, “Like I said, I just wanted some time to think. And what is there to talk about anyway? Like I know people always say you should talk, but what if there is nothing to say?”
“I need you,” Dean countered, moving one hand inside Cas’ underwear. Dean grinned when he felt the angel was already half hard. He stroked once and Cas moaned lewdly above him. Dean lifted his head and nipped at Cas’ Adam’s apple.
“You do?” Cas asked hesitantly.
TW: neglectful /emotionally abusive parents, mentions of two separate suicide attempts, mentions of attempted SA, mentions of conversion therapy, religious trauma, internalized homophobia
“Bobby? He’s here? Why isn’t he in Vancouver at the auction?”
It took a couple more drinks before he had the nerve to return to the room; the nerve to face Castiel again. The nerve to deal with the feeling that constricted his heart every time he made eye contact with those God-forsaken blue eyes.
To a group home, or some shit. I don’t have the fucking luxury to sit and talk about my feelings and do weird stretchy poses. I need to go home. I need to go home right now!”
The title of this song comes from the song
It wasn’t a question; it was a statement, but Dean saw it as the former. “Of course you did, asshole. Worse than – “
Dean drew back, deliberately dragging his arm across Cas this time, chasing the feeling of skin on skin. He moved Cas’ hand from his chest and placed it on the side of his throat as he lay back down. His one arm propped below his head and the other grabbing Cas’ arm and pulling him down. Cas did not say anything but conceded to the unasked request, eyes never leaving Dean. He mirrored Dean’s position, one arm pillowing his head, but kept his other arm stretching the distance between them, his hand on Dean’s throat.
“I don’t really know who I am without my faith,” Cas said softly. It sounded like a confession. He walked over to his bedside table where he switched on the lamp before turning off the main room lights.
Dean was out of his bed and banging on Sam’s door before the thought could lodge into the part of his brain that constantly relived all the ways he had failed those he cared about.
“Yeah, Yeah,” Dean grumbled. Cas smiled at the hunter, his heart feeling full. Dean scurried over to where the breakfast foods were on display. Sam had really gone all out and Dean was piling his plate high with food.
The audio tapes Dean had sent with Amara seemed to be working.
“Okay man, what’s up with you?” Dean’s voice cut through Cas’ reprieve.
Dean choked, actually choked, on his own spit, and Castiel laughed, the tension eased slightly. Castiel placed his hands flat on Dean’s chest and started slowly running his hands downward.
“Hello, Dean,” Cas said softly.
“I’m fi…” Dean caught himself, shaking his head as he had done earlier, and when he looked at Castiel, he seemed more present than he had the whole day.
“Very well,” Castiel smiled. “Which book would you like me to read?” Castiel pointed to the stack on his bedside table. Dean turned slightly so he could look at them.
“I am not fidgety,” Cas countered, and Dean swore he could hear the angel’s eye roll.
Dean started tapping his foot as he watched the second-hand tick closer and closer to his allotted time.
“And what consequences are those, exactly?” Amara challenged, one eyebrow raised.
Dean continued on like that for a while.
He knew what was awaiting him when he opened the door. In their last session, Missouri had gone over all the physical changes Sam went through so that Dean wouldn’t be caught off guard. She explained that he was thinner, paler, that he had a couple of ugly bruises running up his arms from where the nurses drew blood and stuck the needles attached to the multitude of IVs he’d had over the past eight weeks. Missouri explained that he also had tubes in his nose.
His heart continued the painful squeeze thing as he studied the photo.
Before Dean had come to Sam and Eileen and told them of his plan to save Cas, Sam had found some information in the Men of Letters archives of a dimension called
Dean held on to the photo for nearly forty-eight hours. He ran his finger down Cas’s jaw on the photograph, trying to imagine the rough stubble instead of the glossy page. Trying to hold on to the memory of the warmth he had felt that day, of that feeling of being reunited with Cas.
And he was totally fine.
“Okay, so where do we start?” Cas asked, eyes alight in a way Dean hadn’t seen before.
“Yo, grandpas”. The sound burst through the closed door before it was followed by three loud knocks. Castiel’s eyes snapped open, and he took a deep breath in as reality crashed into him violently. When the room came into focus, he could see that Dean was facing the same battle with coming to grips with consciousness.
Dean barely had time to stand before the door rattled as his new roommate tried the doorknob. The apartments only had one set of keys that was left in the kitchen. Dean heard them jiggle where they were still stuck in the lock.
“Morning, Sunshine,” Dean greeted a little hazily with the memory of sleep still echoing in his mind.
“You’ve been what? How?” Sam asked, immediately going into research mode.
So that is how after eight days of intense planning Sam and Dean found themselves having the same argument every few hours.
that he can leave now. I think that’s what happened with the demons too. The Empty doesn’t have influence outside of its plane, but in it, it is very strong. Strong enough to psychologically affect one even outside of the Empty’s realm of control.”
Thank you so much! Wishing you all a lovely week ahead
But here he was with his finger frozen over the trackpad where he had been scrolling before the photo had burst into Dean’s vision.
Dean felt Cas’ nod more than he saw it. “It is stunning.”
“Didn’t you just start a new medication?” Castiel asked as he started tracing nonsensical patterns onto Dean’s forearm with his free hand.
“Yes, everything is perfect,” his eyes shot to Dean’s as he fluffed the pillows.
“You heard my prayer?” Sam asked, smiling at his surrogate son while holding Eileen’s hand under the table.
He’d expected the blow of seeing Dean to lessen in its severity as the years progressed, as the time they spent apart started outnumbering the time they spent together, but he was sorely mistaken. The pain he felt after their break up (sitting in his bed for a month, not doing anything but crying his eyes out and sleeping in fitful and restless bursts) when he saw the first photo of Dean since that night, out with friends for his farewell dinner, hurts no more than the photo he held in his hands now. He lowered his eyes to the caption which read “The trouble with being the best man at a wedding is that you never get to prove it.”
If he did that, if he brought Castiel back, Zeke would leave, and Sam would just be a broken shell, a collection of internal burns and half stuck angelic duct tape. Sam would
Castiel had heard the name Dean Winchester long before he ever laid eyes on the man.
“Yeah?”
“Okay, Dean,” Cas said softly. Dean let out an explosive breath and nodded. Cas shuffled out the room, he hesitated just outside of the door and looked over his shoulder. Dean was already looking at him.
Cas started blushing. And Dean’s interest exploded.
“Can I bring someone?” Sam asked in faked nonchalance.
Dean pressed his lips slowly to Castiel’s, a chaste, swift brush, before he pulled back to look at him. Castiel’s eyes were closed, and his breathing was labored.
As Cas dragged the heel of his palms down Dean’s chest, stopping only to scrape his thumbs across his nipples, he realized there were more freckles than he'd remembered. Dean must have been spending more time in the sun now than when they were in college. Cas' heart constricted at not knowing why he was spending more time outside. Of not being part of the –
Firstly, I wasn't going to write a proposal here when I did my plot outline. I thought it was something that was done often in fics and I wanted to move away from it. But then, as I was writing it, I just realized that Cas deserves nice things. And the two of them deserve a soft ending, no matter the world they exist in. So this was the result.
“Heya, Sammy, Eileen!” Dean greeted them enthusiastically as soon as their faces were visible.
He was over-protective. He knew this. Sue him.
He had felt fucked up about that for a long time. How something solid could just effervesce for no other reason than “people have different paths”.  No screaming, no fighting, no catastrophic implosion. Nothing he or she did wrong. She was just there, and then, she was just gone, and Dean, in the blink of an eye, was alone again. A man that had known the warmth of a ray of sunshine and had it slowly dissolve in the wake of the familiar greyness. Dean was man enough to admit that it had fucked him up.
“Dean?” Sam asked gently,
Castiel listened as her footfalls diminished. Dean was wiping at his eyes and pouting in a way that reminded Castiel of a grumpy toddler. He laughed affectionately before leaning in and kissing Dean’s forehead.
And Castiel had done enough work on himself to understand that he could love her, and still crave and seek a different connection.
“What were you listening to that put such a smile on your face even though you had to be at work at the ass crack of dawn on a Saturday? Was it Metallica? Metallica always calms me down and puts me in a good mood.”
An unreadable expression flicked across Castiel’s features before he hung his head, dark hair falling into his face. His silence prompted Dean to continue.
“I am calm,” Dean tried, but even he had to admit he didn’t sound very calm.
“Clarence, you look fucking dreadful,” Meg greeted him. Castiel sighed. He knew he did, his face looked ashen, and the shadows under his eyes contrasted horribly with the bloodshot eyes themselves. Meg watched him wearily, and Castiel noticed that she tensed up as she catalogued him.
In the storage room.
“Just, fair warning, do not ask about the prostitutes in Monte Carlo,” Meg said, a pinched look blooming on her face.
The dinner went alright. The food was edible, mostly, and conversation was stunted but continuous. All in all, Cas would count it as a win. They talked about work; Dean had served two tours after college before finally settling back in the US. He’s been working as a firefighter for the past three years. Cas was happy that Dean managed to follow that dream; it was something he always wanted to do. He’s very close to two of his colleagues, Garth and Victor. Sam just got married. He’d just finished his undergrad a couple of weeks ago and was set to start law school when the summer was over. Dean spoke of his new sister-in-law, Eileen, very fondly.
“Some of those who ventured in to the Empty, ventured in with a demon captive. It was only done three or four times because most members were hesitant to go there. They mostly did it through astral projection.”
The first visit was very emotional. Bobby had threatened to strangle him if he ever did something so stupid in a car again. Or in life. Dean had never seen Bobby cry, but he definitely saw tears in his eyes right before he hugged him that first afternoon.
as it was a very Cas-centric episode. Cas also monologues in this, just like he monologues in that episode.
He managed to strain the pasta and add the very basic tomato and basil pasta sauce, the only sauce he knew how to make, with no further injuries. Well, he wasn’t injured, but the kitchen looked like a bomb had hit it.
“From the Cafeteria,” Castiel answered, his throat dry.
“When I left here, I considered just driving back to Kansas. Leaving you the room and giving you space from me,” Dean said once he felt more like himself. He was still a little drunk, but he was definitely racing towards sober.
in Johannesburg. Thereafter, he was seated next to a new mother whose infant had not stopped screaming for what felt like the entire sixteen-hour flight. He had stumbled half drunk on sleep deprivation through JFK just to almost miss his connecting flight to
“Hey, Cassie,” Gabriel stepped towards him, and Castiel threw himself into his brother’s arms. The same way  he had so often done before, back when he was a child and his brother had been the only one who could make him feel safe. The only one that could keep the voices at bay, could keep their parent’s poison out. Gabriel, goofy, never-serious, mischievous and loud, Gabriel hugged his brother tightly and whispered softly, “I’m so sorry, baby brother. I’m so, so sorry”.
“I know that, I do, I know… I just keep fucking up, Cas. I didn’t protect him. I let him down. I let him get
When they pulled apart, Cas slipped his arm around Dean’s waist.
did. But it was like that thing where someone tells you to think about anything but a pink elephant, and then, suddenly, all you can think about is a fucking pink elephant.
“Yeah, I’m hanging up now. Tell Eileen I send my love.”
Dean turned to the familiar sound. Cas was watching him with a frown from the far end of the hallway.
I'd love to hear your thoughts on this chapter! You can comment underneath or find me on tumblr
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean was quiet; he wasn’t sure what to say.
“You know, some people would argue that it’s not the greatest idea to look for anything like that in a mental hospital,” Castiel said pointedly.
“Trauma?” Dean interrupted.
Castiel saw Meg, as usual, sitting on the purple couches in the reception. This time, however, Gabriel was next to her, with his leg bouncing, scrolling through his phone. Meg was sneakily trying to see whatever app he had open. Castiel grinned.
“You wound me with your words, Sam. I am wounded,” Dean teased.
Dean sighed. That was a fair assessment.
Gabriel chuckled and dipped an Oreo into his coffee.
“Dean, I told Sam you would be in for breakfast shortly,” Cas said, voice strained.
“It’s what happens with you often.”
Dean huffed out a laugh. “What? The eight weeks of emotional disinfecting?”
someone that could reflect back to him all that he’s needed for so long. Someone who would understand without him having to explain. But, although he cared for them, there was something inside him that stopped him reaching out, stopped him from trying. So now, instead, he was awash in a mix of loneliness and numbness that were constantly at war which just left him feeling raw and achy. The only time this ache was bearable was when he was around Meg. But she didn’t understand, not all of him, not every dark scar scratched into his heart. And he wasn’t sure he wanted her to be that person for him. He already
See you wonderful humans next week :)! xx
Dean and Cas were already seated in the war room when Eileen and Sam walked in. Dean smiled at the two of them as they took their own seats. Dean thought, as he stared at the three members of his family, that he could get used to this. Could get used to the idea of a home full of people.
… his memories returned, sat like a heavy rock right in the center of his chest. This rock grew heavier when Amara informed Dean that she still wasn’t allowing him any visitors. She had explained to him that because there was no whisper of natural memory recall yet, she didn’t want to risk the progress Dean was making by introducing potential triggers. Dean had been pretty deflated after that conversation and withdrew into himself for a while. Castiel, however, knew how to coax him back to the land of the living.
“But… “ he had continued reluctantly, “after seeing what it did to Meg... I don’t want to put her through that again.”
in the past when anxiety had licked at him.
The gesture was so familiar.
“Dean, you did the best you could, in very difficult circumstances.”
“How long what?” Sam asked, slightly confused.
Cas saw Dean role his eyes and smiled at the familiar gesture.
“I didn’t know what else to do or what I could say, because there’s a lot I can’t tell you, yet. Can’t, Cas, not won’t, okay? You have to trust that I wouldn’t do this if these weren’t monumental stakes.” His voice soothed, dropping into a whisper.
“He hadn't been around in weeks...” Dean murmured, trying to remember, or better yet, think of any reason he would’ve actually gotten into a car with his father.
Right.
“So what, Dean?” Castiel asked, fearing the answer.
Sam, therefore, stayed with him, always playing devil’s advocate when Dean suggested plans, always asking about Dean’s safety. And, without fail, Dean scoffed every time Sam shut down a plan when it seemed too risky. But Sam had held his ground and refused to let Dean attempt any halfcocked plans much to Dean’s palpable annoyance.
He did not smile often anymore. He didn’t find a whole lot of reason for happiness; hadn’t for years. But, hugging his best friend was one of those few moments that shot like a bullet of clarity through the haze that usually encompassed him.
Dean’s heart stopped, “Sammy…”
Gabriel lifted the coffee to his face mechanically and swallowed heavily.
Dean tried to avoid thinking about his brother as he was wheeled out of the room with his rumpled duffle on his lap (he remained staring at the floor blushing furiously for the duration of the journey). He hadn’t been apart from Sam for longer than a weekend since the kid was born, and the idea of being apart from him twisted his insides in a way that was nothing short of excruciating. He had made Amara promise that John would not be allowed to see Sam before Dean was released. She had agreed, which was a relief, as there was no way he would have gone if she hadn’t.
Dean nodded, trying to hold on to the feeling of hope even if it had dulled a little. He left his brother’s room sending a prayer to an angel he hoped could hear him.
Castiel was about to appease her, tell her he was fine, when he focused in on her face. Castiel narrowed his eyes as he studied her. She was thinner than the girl he had met--her cheeks were hollow, her skin sallow, lines etched into her face where mere months ago there had been none. Everything about her seemed to scream exhaustion. Castiel had gotten used to seeing her this way, this worn-down imitation of the woman that had approached him in the library all those months ago. And Castiel knew he was the cause for it. As much as she denied it, he knew that this was the result of weeks of stressing about him, of trying to cope with the trauma of what happened to him and what he had put her through. He tried not to think of it, tried not to contrast the two Megs in his head, because he knew the guilt of seeing the evident changes would bring a monsoon of regret.
The thought of what to do with the notebook occurred to him after he had already paid for it.
“I love you Jack,” Cas said softly, “we all do. We want you here”
“Hello, Dean,” Eileen said smiling.
Dean grinned before he looked down.
Dean opened the basket and pulled out a thick quilt. He draped it over Baby’s hood before hopping up and patting the side next to him. Cas joined him, although his scramble up was a little inelegant. Dean couldn’t help the rush of fondness that ran through him as he watched Cas settle down next to him.
Castiel had not slept well, or in actuality, he had not slept at all.
“Always,” Dean grinned, but his voice sounded a little strained.
“Castiel, it’s okay if right now someone else is the only reason you’re alive,” she had said, the gentle cadence of her voice calming him slightly.
“If you are referring to before I took a blade to my wrists, the answer is no. I have not seen them since then” Castiel chuckled humorlessly. Just the mere thought of this interaction sat like a rock inside his chest, something hard and heavy.
As he dragged himself into bed, still fully clothed, flashes of images pulsed unbidden in his brain: John screaming; John lashing out; John apologizing before collapsing on the floor in his own sick; Sammy screaming; Sammy crying; Dean trying to stop his nose from bleeding; Dean cradling his arm as it hung from a weird angle.
But in him staying quiet, had he taken something away from Cas? Because, with a sudden dawning horror, Dean could not remember one person telling Cas they loved him. A sharp electric feeling pushed into Dean’s ribs.
Dean’s heart resumed beating, if somewhat erratically, “Where’s John?”
The second one was, ‘
“Hello to you too, brother,” Castiel grumbled as Gabriel squeezed him hello.
“That’s what I said, although, not exactly like that,” Dean agreed. “But she said she would come to see me and explain everything as soon as she could. But she did tell me Sam’s alive.”
I hope you enjoy it!
“But, they’re such great people! And, they are porn stars, not hookers.” Castiel heard a warm voice from somewhere behind him and he spun on his heel. Standing within arm’s reach was his older brother, his familiar face holding a look completely unfamiliar to Castiel.
“You’re doing what?” Dean asked,
Dean just glared, breathing heavily.
Cas had written to him every day.
“That’s okay,” she said, smiling at Sam in a way that had Dean covering his grin with his hands.
“Cas and Bobby,” Dean said as he shoveled eggs into his mouth, not really tasting it.
deluded.
“Nah?” Cas said, the syllable sounding strange coming from his baritone voice.
“The curiosity thing. Is there anything else you’re curious about?” Dean asked.
With those words he headed towards the garage, needing the open road.
The “
“Dammit” Dean yelled hitting the steering wheel, breaking the silence that had settled around the brothers, “Fucking dammit.” The words tore from Dean’s chest and he hit his head into steering wheel.
It seemed that Cas could not sleep, but he could still dream of them. The life they would have –
to touch Dean’s skin, felt almost delirious with the need to press his lips on the elegant arch of Dean’s throat. Cas wanted Dean closer. He wanted
There was a soft knock on his door, Dean jumped back from Cas.
And on the first ruled page, in Cas’ writing again:
They sat in companionable silence for a while, both sipping their coffee.
Castiel closed his eyes, as if the words hurt him. He began to move, as if he was about to get up, and Dean felt panic rising in him. The idea of distance between the two of them making it hard for him to breathe.
“Well, then what do you want, Dean?’ Cas exhaled.
“I was scared, Cas.”
. But no pressure, obviously :)!
“What are the odds of that?” Sam sounded slightly horrified but mostly just shocked.
“Look, Doc, I’m not great with the words or the feelings,” Dean said, after a couple of seconds of silence.
, in no way mitigates all the good you’ve done. How much you’ve helped me. Okay?”
“Dean, I –“
Their eyes locked for a moment and then Cas doubled over as a coughing fit wracked through his body.
“Oh God,” the words fell from his lips and he balled his hands into fists, “Oh God."
“Cas, don’t… don’t make promises you can’t keep.” Dean whispered, tears flowing freely down his face now. He dropped his gaze, but Cas grabbed his chin and forced Dean to look at him. Dean had no idea what he was seeing. A haunted, broken man? A failure? A wreck? A combination of all of these?
When they were together, Dean and Cas never fought. Not really. They bickered, sure. Annoyed each other, naturally. But they never actually
Firstly, I know this chapter is a day early, but I have a really busy day planned tomorrow, and I always prefer to get things earlier rather than later so *gestures* here ya go!
Dean scoffed.
“Yes, Ma’am,” Gabriel said, and the serious look flew off his face and was instantly replaced with the mischievous one Castiel had known since childhood.
He grabbed Dean’s hands between his own, and tried not to take it personally when Dean flinched away. “Dean, I’m going to go get Stevie. Please wait here or go wait in the room. She will call Amara. Please, just, wait here, please don’t do something before she gets here.”
Dean just sat beside her, both waiting for Cas.
"I know he needs more time but.... Can't we just adopt? We have Jack, he's practically the next heir even if I marry some girl and have a baby, what else do you need?"
"I love you."
: Lisa may not understand but Charlie might. But sure you can bring them.
"Where's Castiel?" Clarie asked. She had forgiven the angel for taking her father's body, she was happy to hear that her parents were in heaven. She saw the angel as her parent figure now.
He talked to them for a few more minutes and headed inside to his room. He saw Cas was sleeping in a different way than before. The comforter fallen off the bed. Dean sighed and put it back on him. He himself went back to his bed and layed down, closing his eyes.
"Day before yesterday." Dean said.
"Can you choose your mate then?" Charlie asked. Dean shook his head.
"Why now? Why when everything's going right?"
: You both are safe right?
Castiel locked the door and turned to Dean who had his eyes closed.
"Dean Winchester. I found you."
"Just do it." Cas cut the call.
Dean stood close to him. He saw a strand of hair that was out of the way and without even thinking just put it back in place. He didn't even see Castiel blushing. Sam didn't dare interrupt because his plan would just work out right here, no need of going out too. Dean was getting jealous that this was for someone else and not him. He wanted to be the one who will flaunt him in front of everyone out there and here he was standing like a coward,  scared of telling Cas that he lik- no loved him. It was love at first sight kinda thing but when Dean realized that Angels don't feel anything he had pushed the thought to the back. Now seeing Castiel like this, so beautiful and looking so sexy for some other guy, it just broke him. He just turned away and walked to his room, lost in thought.
"He said that you would leave Cas and you'd never love a nerd like him. He also said that you'd leave him after you used him." Charlie said. "That's why I brought him up here so he could forget."
It was the last week of November and their exam dates had been put up.
Dean noticed the same song playing again.
"I don't even have one. I have eyes for a certain human and you know him." Castiel said as he healed Dean of the side effects of the poison.
"Oh no. You can stay here, we have plenty of space for all of us." Bess insists.
"My mom had called. She wants me to go back there when the holidays start."
"Don't worry, it will wear off in....I'm sorry I don't know." Castiel said as he sat beside Dean. Dean looked to Cas surprised.
"H-Hey." She sat down drinking water.
It was a drawing of an ancient rune-like symbol. It had many geometric designs and a capital C written in the middle of it. It was really detailed as if it was telling him something but Dean couldn't point out what. He decided to ask Cas about that.
The mother and son were gobsmacked. They weren't expecting this. They didn't expect any of this. Even though Sam never supported his mother in this business, he was still part of it.
Dean stayed awake with Cas for how much ever time he stayed up. Sometimes Cas would fall asleep in the middle of studying and Dean would get him to bed. They used to wake up early and Cas would teach Dean math and Dean taught Cas chemistry as he missed some classes to rest cause he stayed up all night.
"How can you say that? He literally told me to get out."
After some time of kissing each other they broke the kiss and Cas spoke.
Dean yelled in his head. But first, he wanted to sort things out with his boyfriend, soon to be husband.
"I feel like someone is watching me."
Dean walked to the kitchen lazily, not even noticing Cas and Sam. He grabbed a beer and that's when he saw them.
"What do you care about? You'll leave him eventually." Justin scoffed.
Dean was full awake now.
Sam got a call. A video call from Jody. Sam answered it with a smile.
"I'll go out now. Hope you remember what I said earlier." Dean nodded, his cheeks flushed red.  Cas stepped out wearing a mask and sunglasses which covered his appearance.
"Marriage? To whom?"
"How greedy are you Mary? Trying to hurt your own son just to get us out? Tsk tsk." Cas shook his head.
: Chemistry. Cas was nervous as it was not his subject. He was thankful as Dean taught him all the important topics in the last week. Cas did well. Dean was the same. Lisa and Charlie did well too.
Cas and Dean were walking to their class when Dean asked.
"Still, even if you loose control and try drinking blood from me, you can't. You see I like garlics a lot." Cas winked. Dean tensed up. Garlics! The word itself was scary. His father had told him only a few vampires don't like garlic, others can eat it like they're humans.
"I like you a lot Cas. I can understand if you don't want to be my mate. I don't know what will happen but it's okay. I won't force you into anything." Dean said.
Dean sighs and just walks away inside. Jody gives Sam a questioning look.
They walked down the stairs to the cafeteria. Dean knew Lisa was gonna come again. He didn't know what to do or how to send her away just for the night. He had to come up with an excuse to break up with her as soon as he could.
Charlie took out her phone and played a song. Cas' eyes lit up. It was a BTS song. Cas had said he loved that Korean boy band a lot. She played his favourite. Euphoria by JK.
"I-Is it possible that..that there can be one exception?" Dean asked, fearing the answer. He can't let go of Cas. He loved him too much to lose him now.
Meg showed him the pictures from a CCTV camera which showed Mary Winchester and Sam Winchester entering the building which was rumoured to be the phoenix's headquarters.
Dean followed back Cas to their class. Cas just gave a smile and Dean understood they were good. Nothing to worry. The class ended pretty early.
Dean slowly followed Castiel to their room, his heart speeding up as he took each step. They finally reached the room and Castiel took a deep breath.
"They're Korean Dean." Cas face palmed.
Dean took Cas to their dorm. Lisa and Charlie couldn't come as it was still daylight and they couldn't sneak in without any boy noticing.
Dean and Cas finished their homeworks and and went to sleep, tired from that day's work. Too tired to even go have dinner.
"Cas, who was that girl that was around you all the time back at school?" This was the question Dean desperately wanted to know the answer for.
Cas looked to Dean. Dean hesitated before nodding. Cas walked away. Dean grew impatient. He wanted to run after Cas and be with him. Then it hit him suddenly. Was Cas his true mate?
"Heyy, Dean!!!" Cas yelled from the washroom.
"Oh, that's why it felt familiar." Dean said and got out of baby and both the brothers headed to the front door and knocked.
"Castiel. Can you please leave our son now? He's going ne through enough because of you." Mary, Dean's mom, was pleading outside the hospital.
Dean and Cas got up and headed outside to the bench where they first ate dinner.
"Yeah?" Sam asked and smiled at his best friend.
"Morning, I guess?" Dean said laughing nervously. Sam could see the slight anger and jealous lingering in Dean's eyes, he was surprised that Dean hid it pretty well.
"Dean I need to talk to you about something. Alone." Castiel said in a stern voice. Dean remembered the first time Castiel had said that in the barn and how Dean couldn't move and was lost in the angel's eyes. Dean nodded.
"You did baby, when I was...."Cas blushed when he remembered.
"Clarance, you came!! I've been waiting." A voice came sarcastically from behind him.
"What? Why are you thinking of Cas?" Dean asked, confused.
"Yeah but I'm a bit nervous," Castiel replied shyly.
Charlie and Lisa saw the body of Justin and gasped.
Much love
"I'm sorry for breaking my promise. Ju-Justin he...he told me that we could be friends and he won't trouble me. So to
Dean did not answer but grabbed him by the collar and turned him around holding his neck with his elbow and another hand on his head. And he snapped it.
"I love you Cas."
"Mary, you can't do this to your own son. He loves him. How much blind are you to see this?" John, Dean's dad was butting in the conversation.  John was supportive of them. He knew how much the two loved each other. But his wife and son couldn't see it and always went against the couple.
Cas then turned around and Dean saw the same symbol on his skin. Dean was confused. What was that?
"Where were you?" Asked Dean as soon as Sam entered.
"So are you okay now? Should I leave for some time?" Cas asked.
Dean did not drive this time too, Sam was worried as Dean refused to drive and trusted baby in his hands. Dean was always zoned out as of he had no reason to live but was holding on to a miracle.
"C-Can you stay with me at the dinner?" Dean asked hesitantly as he felt so protected and safe around the other boy.
"But on one condition."
"Why did you hurt him?"
"Okay, Castiel. Tell me who that is." Dean said and immediately was surprised when he felt soft lips on his. Dean closed his eyes and savored the moment.
"What do you mean?"
"Hey um....I heard Cas is back. Is it true?"
"Okay, boys. Don't you dare hide anything from me." Jody says and Clarie nods along to that.
After they were done with they're love making, Dean hugged a sober Cas who was blushing like hell.
"Okay, I'll check with Dean."
"You were gonna tell me about that right?" Cas asked.
"I recognize that car and it's them. Why don't you believe me." Sam assumed it to be Clarie.
"Okay. B-" the call was cut.
"Of course. I don't like hiding things from you."
He heard a gasp and opened his eyes to see Sam, Dean's little brother watching Dean open his eyes.
"W-why are they asking to meet all of a sudden?" Mary was called by Meg and told to be ready for a meeting with them.
He saw Sam and Cas standing in front of each other as if they had fought for a good one hour. Dean was confused. What was the reason his brother got angry and that too on Cas? He was scared.
Sam got up and stood beside Castiel who looked up at him as if he stood on a tall building. He put a flirty hand on Castiel's shoulder and whispered in his ears. "Just play along." Castiel shook his head. "Do you or not want to know how Dean feels about yah?" Castiel nodded, blushed, and looked down at his cup of coffee.
"I can't tell you Dean. Stop making this even harder than it already is." Cas pleaded.
"How was art? Did you do something?" Cas asked curiously. Dean shook his head.
"It's....it's nothing."
* .   *.    *.
Dean walked away to get their drinks.
: hello.
"Ugh! I'm going out." Cas said in frustration as he left his house and without even him knowing he walked to their place. The place where he and Dean met for the first time.  It was still as peaceful as it was before. He sat down on the grass thinking of old times. How carefree they were, the way they didn't have to fear anyone, they could live their life as normal beings. But now it is long gone.
Dean was tossing and turning on the bed, feeling hot and sweaty. He just wanted this night to be over.
"I- I don't know. It glowed and...and what if you think that I'm not normal and leave me? I had so many thoughts going through my head and I was scared." Cas said tears starting to roll down his face. Dean wiped away the tears.
Dean found Justin by his friends. He went there calmly as he didn't want to create a scene.
Woo hello!!!
The three of them talked about about college and where Charlie stayed. Even the girls had dorms and were with a room mate. Charlie said her room mate was a girl named Rowena.
Charlie, Lisa, Dean and Cas fled from the place.
The three of them talked for a while and they discussed the case. Sam concluded that this might be a salt n burn case. It was a ghost and they could finish it in a few days and Garth had already had almost all the details.
He reached the canteen to see Dean and Charlie. He ran over and hugged Dean. Thank God not many people were there yet.
"Damn right. I'm gonna kick they're ass."
"You were in a relationship with her son?"
(See the end of the chapter for
That's all Cas wanted to hear before he smites her and only the host body fell on the ground. The body coughed. Castiel was surprised. How can a human still be alive when a demon was possessing them.
"Hey Dean. I'm sorry. It's none of business to ask. I just.... I don't know what I was thinking. I'm sorry." Cas told Dean who hugged him suddenly. Cas was shocked but recovered quickly and hugged Dean back. This was a precious moment both the boys wanted to remember.
"Oh so only Winchester can call you that ? Hmm? you're mine." Justin leaned near Cas neck and licked. Cas tried pushing him away but no luck. Justin was stronger than him.
: Math. Lisa thanked Cas for teaching her before and it helped her a lot in the exams. Dean did comparably good. Cas was on the same level as Lisa. Charlie did good.
"I feel sorry for that boy." Charlie said as she ate her fries.
Justin's body fell lifeless on the floor.
"Hey don't yell. I'm having a hangover."
"I'm leaving."
"I wasn't planning on leaving you anyway. Let's go?" Cas motioned towards the door and Dean nodded and follwed cas outside their shared room.
"Whaaat???" Dean yelled back.
After he finished, he felt the thirst gone. He looked to his mother.
"He what now!?!?" Lisa exclaimed and stood up.
His brother with whom Dean had fought because his brother didn't support his relationship like his brother sat crying bedside the bed whispering apologises over and over again.
Dean woke up, feeling thirsty. Very thirsty. He saw the glass of water beside him and drank but spit out immediately. He was thirsty for something more red. He growled and before he could do anything, his mother came to his room holding a glass of.... Red wine?
Castiel got off the bed and Dean stood up too. Castiel didn't meet Dean's eyes and Dean was getting frustrated.
"He has a date. It's valentine's after all. With all the other things over, and no monsters for us to hunt, why not just chill? You're gonna be getting laid, so I thought why not Cas too and set him up with a 'guy'. " Sam said pressing the word 'guy'. Castiel looked at Sam shocked. Castiel looked at Dean who looked like he didn't like the idea.
"Can I survive on human food? Like I don't have to drink blood all the time right?" Dean asked.
So I decided that I would update two times in a week so here you go ❤️
"It's been a long time, Jody. We're really happy to see you." Sam said and Dean just nodded. Sam assumed he was not ready to mingle yet. It was as if someone died. It almost looked like it, but there were no weird sightings nor a body of Cas so they still assumed Castiel was alive.
"She was pale, unlike any of us boys. She had eyes like yours, emarald green. Black hair, just messy as all of us in the family." Cas chuckled at the remembrance. Dean smiled too. He remembered how he wanted to touch Cas' hair back in the school. He shook away the thoughts. This was not the time.
"Why sh- wait what!?!"
"What's wrong?" Dean asked while he out away his phone giving his boyfriend his full attention.
"Straight to the point. Good. I want to take over your business."
"You're coming with me, right?"
"Get to the point Cas," Dean said, dreading the answer he would get. Did Cas cheat on him? Is that why Sam was angry at him? Dean hoped he wouldn't leave him. He's all Dean ever wanted in his life. His heart started beating fast when Castiel looked to Sam, a kind of pleading in his eyes. But Sam shook his head. Castiel sighed and turned to Dean.
"Baby vampire?"  She made a 'really' face.
The kissing continued on for a few minutes until both of them were tired.
Adios, bitches ❤️❤️
"I- I don't know." Dean answered.
"It's....let's leave for another time. So, how are you and the girls?" Sam asked. The smile came back to Jody's face.
"Mom…."
"It's good son. But be careful who you trust. We want to know that you're safe there." His father said concerned.
"I couldn't say no to him. He already had the basics." Sam replied. Dean sighed and let out a frustrated groan.
: Hey girls, me and Cas have something to tell you. Come over?
The teacher had entered now and was telling something about the uses of brushes and how to choose the accurate brush size for a perfect stroke.
"Never."
"Cas!!" Dean ran to him and hugged him.
"Did you find your mate Dean?" Cas asked in a serious tone. He didn't know how to react but he sure as hell wasn't going to cry in front of him. Cas needed to find someone else fast. He couldn't see Dean with someone else.
"Can we talk ? Alone?" Dean asked and Cas nodded confused. Charlie smirked as Lisa sat down beside her.
He heard a soft knock on his door.
"Hey you can't do that. You promised to tutor me today." Dean whined. Castiel heard a snort from Charlie who shut up.
Dean stood up from his bed and within two steps he recahed Cas' bed. He placed a gentle hand on Cas' shoulder. Cas looked up, eyes light red due to the crying.
As he had completed all the admission process, he just had to go and know which dorm he was allotted and collect his time table.
, her genuine interest in Dean, in his well-being, had put him at ease, had let him lower his guard enough for her to squeeze her way into his life and his heart. And it was good. For a while there, it had been
Cas eyed him suspiciously.
Dean knew that they had to move out eventually, but every time he thought of going back to his apartment, memories of John and
And he hadn't had the chance to explain this to Dean.
Dean silently screamed into the pillow again before removing both it, and the comforter, from his face. He blinked at the morning sun, adjusting to the excessively bright light that the threadbare curtains let in. He missed the blackout curtains at the station.
Amara tensed and bit the inside of her cheek as she held his gaze. “Dean I – “
“Dean,” Castiel tried again.
Eileen walked over to the two and tapped lightly on a very distinctive bruise blooming behind Dean’s ear.
“Cas?” Came Dean’s voice, tense and uncertain.
Dean felt like he had somehow stumbled his way into something that was both very real and very honest, something that was quickly becoming the central point in his life. This thing that was growing between him and Cas made him feel
Cas stiffened violently next to Dean, his hand stilling the motion on his back. Dean felt his mouth dry out, his vision blur.
Meg had been ushered out by the nursing staff before he had been able to ask her how she knew Dean, and the curiosity gnawed at him. Castiel had been shocked to find that he had felt anything this acutely, let alone a sensation so randomly mundane. He had decided to focus his attention on this feeling. To nurse the prosaic feeling and analyse it. To see how it affected his body - how it made him fidget and tap his pen on the book in front of him instead of writing. It had been
TW: Panic attacks, mentions of a car accident, mentions of physical abuse.
“Yes, he does. He is going to stay. He’s going to get well-acquainted with my couch,” Meg said quickly, standing up.
Awesome.
Dean swallowed heavily, “I hope this doesn’t lose me any brownie points with you or anything.”
“No one has explained the processes here to you yet, have they?”
“Dean, he wasn’t alone. Mr. Singer has been with him at every single visitation.”
He did everything he could to avoid going to sleep. To avoid the way Dean seemed to haunt all over his
Sam nodded and the corner of his mouth lifted in a half smile, “You two have a lot to talk about.”
Castiel was pretty sure he was going to spontaneously combust.
“Mr. Winchester, are you ready?”
He was as surprised as both Amara and Cas seemed to be when the word filled the room.
“It looks like it was a bad accident…”  Castiel started, lacing his fingers with Dean’s, both of their hands tangled in his lap. The gesture was so casual and so
“Yes that one,” Eileen coughed.
Dean flushed; Cas’ candor always seemed to have that effect on him.
“Oh my god, that’s Dean Winchester.”
Castiel sighed as he took hold of the door handle. He would, however, “seek” if he had to. For as long as it took.
“I’m here Dean,” came the angel’s reply as he placed his hand on Dean’s shoulder. Dean was suddenly very distracted by the feel of Cas’ skin on his. With the lack of sight enhancing his other senses, Dean could feel every inch of Cas’ hand, feel each individual groove of his fingertips. Dean resisted the urge to lean into the touch and demand more.
He inhaled deeply and realized just how much he missed his smell. His presence. Just him.
The image he conjured stubbornly refused to leave his mind as he spurted onto the wall of the shower.
“You brushed your teeth,” Dean said, but it somehow sounded like an accusation.
The room was deathly silent, and Dean cleared his throat, “I let you down Jack. I failed you as a parent and as a person who was supposed to care for you unconditionally. And I want to make up for it. I want to earn your trust back. All of us love you, all of us want you here with us.”
The idea of only being friends sent a sharp, agonizing pain straight through Cas’ heart, but he would take what he could get. He knew that. He just wanted back into Dean’s life in any role that he would allow him. He hadn’t even known how desperately he wanted this until he was forced to confront his feelings for Dean.
Dean continued to glare at him. And Cas shrugged as nonchalantly as he could muster. But the longer Dean stared at him with such intense malice, the faster Cas’ throat dried out. Swallowing became difficult. Breathing became difficult.
Cas smiled gently, “After today, there’s very little that could cause you to ‘
“Yeah?” Dean was unendingly grateful for the interruption, but he still couldn’t quite find the courage to look at Cas.
“What is going on with Dean, is he alright?” he heard Jack ask Sam and Eileen. Dean was in his room with the door closed behind him before he could hear either of their responses to the question.
broke from his mouth. “Why’d you do it?”. It probably wasn’t the right time to ask. He wasn’t even sure how
“You don’t know me that well. I could have deserved it.” Castiel countered.
“Yeah,” Dean said as he pulled his chair closer.
where he was not awake or speaking but sometimes reacted to stimuli. Not all the time, though. Bobby had mentioned, however, that as the days progressed, the times he reacted started outnumbering the times that he didn’t.
“Well, Dean, the point in talking about it is that you’ve been dealing with the pressure of having this kind of parent since you were five, as according to your file, that’s when your mother passed. That’s a long time and it was a very young age to be exposed to continual trauma…”
The way he said it so simply cracked something inside Dean. He dropped his elbows onto Sam’s bed and buried his face in his hands. “Sam, I’m the oldest. That’s my job. My job is to look out for you, to keep you safe. You shouldn’t feel like you have to…”
“You,” he said directly to the angel, “don’t go anywhere. No driving anywhere. No stores, no walks, no flitting off to the other side of the globe if Jack fixed your wings.” He was so tightly strung. Cas said nothing, just looked at Dean.
Just because he couldn’t be with Dean right now, didn’t mean he couldn’t write down all the things he wished he could say. It didn’t mean he couldn’t tell Dean all the things he wanted to, every day.
The car pulled into the apartment complex, and the driver popped the trunk. Cas thanked him while slipping his phone into his pocket before getting out and grabbing his luggage. He walked to the apartment, his thoughts still buzzing around Dean.
After, Dean lay with his head on Cas’ chest while Cas ran his fingers up and down Dean’s arm. Both men were breathing heavily.
“Great, Doc, I need to see Sam.”
“Dean, I –“ Cas started, his voice husky and lust rough.
“Yo!” Claire. Castiel identified the voice.
It started with a two-hour delay at the
– story.
“Dean, it’s the middle of the night. I think we should get you back to the room, and then I’ll call Stevie…”
“Dean, I want you to know that I regret nothing. All the choices I made; I would make them again. In a heartbeat.” His eyes were steely, very clear and his gaze pinned Dean, “I would do it again. And I meant everything I said in there. I am not going to deny that or try walk it back. Being able to finally live that part of me was the happiest I have ever been in my very long life Dean.” Dean’s heart was hammering in his chest, the sound almost deafening. Dean tried to speak, but to his utmost horror he found himself paralyzed in his silence
Dean pulled away slightly so that he could look Cast in the eye, “I’m sorry, man, I didn’t mean to intrude or anything.”
“Dude come one!” Sam shouted exasperated, throwing a wet dish cloth at his brother, “we have a communal bathroom.”
And, with his head in his hands, Dean Winchester cried.
“Virginity is a social construct,” Castiel said neutrally.
“No. But that doesn’t mean I can be away from Sam or my responsibilities... just to do fun things.”
“Sam,” Dean interrupted, “It’s okay. I’ve told you this. You were half out of your mind with grief.”
“Yeah, guy sounds like an abusive dick,” Gabriel said.
“Okay?” Dean prompted.
Dean was out of his chair before Sam could finish the thought.
“Where are we?” Cas asked as he watched the windmill.
Gabriel grinned, but it didn’t reach his eyes. He darted a furtive glance over to Meg before scratching the side of his head uncomfortably. Both of them avoided looking at him.
“What just happened?” Jack asked again, his eyes wide.
“I’m not going to let you just leave him…” Dean growled, jumping into a standing position.
Dean’s blood ran cold, and his breath hitched in his throat.
Castiel grinned at him and placed a kiss on his forehead. Castiel then changed into his own pajamas, switched on his bedside lamp and switched off the main light. He was busy pulling his own sheets back when Dean said, “Hey, uh, Cas. Would you stay with me? In my bed tonight. I mean, no pressure or anything.”
“Adjusting to what, Dean?” Castiel’s voice was very soft. Dean cracked open one eye to stare at the man who was wearing his clothes, a sight that left him a little breathless (don’t think about it). Dean searched his face and hated the guarded look he found there, that look had never been aimed at him before.
“May I?” Dean asked, unsure as to where the sudden confidence came from but glad that he had it. Castiel looked at him intently, and then nodded once.
Secondly, I have been toying with the idea of potentially doing time stamps with this fic. I've never done them before and I'm not sure if it something you guys would like to see. My beta even suggested a conversation between Sam and Dean about Dean's experience at
“Cas, I fucked up. I let him down. Cas… Cas, I didn’t know…” the fact that the words were muffled against Castiel’s shirt did nothing to hide the naked grief carved into those words.
“Okay? You can’t just say ‘okay’. What happened?” Dean had felt his temper rising, the anger pulsing in conjunction with the panic in his veins.
Wishing you all a lovely week ahead!
Dean sighed theatrically. “Fine.” He walked over to the dresser to grab his own clothes. He wasn’t going in a full suit and tie, but he would at least put on his nicest collared shirt. It was a big event for Sam.
