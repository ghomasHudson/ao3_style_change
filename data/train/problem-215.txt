The girl turned around to shoot him a glare that he ignored.
Not that Sherlock wasn’t normally odd. But…this was a different sort. This was too normal to be considered typical Sherlock behavior. And that was what was putting him on edge most.
I didn’t magically turn queer if that’s the question you’re wondering. Look, I still very much like women. I don’t particularly find much about male anatomy all that appealing on its own. But Sherlock had given me something different.
Well, no need to think about that. Sherlock didn’t want him. He never would. Why not try to forget with another attractive girlfriend? Really that sounded like a brilliant strategy to him. She continued to smile at him, asking him more personal questions now.
“Hello…er…Miss Adler. I did as you asked.”
“So,” Sherlock said as he pulled up a chair. “Who’s after you?”
When he returned from his night out, John found the flat empty. One glance at Sherlock's bedroom door thankfully confirmed it was open and unoccupied. Well, that was a relief at least. Good to know that he and that
“And somehow managed to do the deadbolt behind him?” Sherlock said drily. “Use your brain Lestrade.”
“Killers,” Irene said with a sharp look.
“Yes,” Kate agreed. “But Dr. Watson left after only a bit. I’m not sure we’re going to get much out of him if he runs every time he’s feeling something—at least if that wasn’t a knife in his pocket.”
He grabbed Sherlock’s arm and tried to pull him from the table, stopped only as the boy resisted, pulling back until his head clunked into the chandelier.
John prickled at the mentions of Molly’s appearance. She looked lovely of course, but Sherlock wasn’t the type to remark on those things. Or at least he usually wouldn’t. Why was he paying attention to the size of her breasts? Perhaps it was jealousy working after all. Perhaps Sherlock fancied her.
He left Sherlock be and came over to where John was sitting with the dog.
Well, no point dragging it out. Sherlock followed Lestrade to his car, trying his best to stop thinking about John Watson for a few minutes.
?” she asked, peering around the classroom with her hands folded. “Lovely book wasn’t it?”
He swallowed, brow furrowing as he remembered the rest of it, detail clear as day. His one fatal mistake.
“But why?” Sherlock had asked.
Mary certainly wasn’t traditionally beautiful. She was nothing like other women I’d gone for before. But that didn’t mean I couldn’t appreciate aspects of her. I think in many ways, there was something about her, about the way she spoke, the way she carried herself. I was embarrassed of course, but intrigued as well. I stayed with her to make sure there was nothing else that could be done. But of course, at that point it was more about just talking with her a bit as she tried to dry up the fabric.
“Then what?” John asked, doing his best to keep the edge out of his voice and mostly failing. “Aren’t we at a stalemate if that’s the case? She won’t just give you the codes. You won’t surrender the phone. Neither of you will get what you want. How can this possibly end all right?”
Until next time-elsarenard
Nothing. He moved his hand a bit, acted as he had the night before, as best he could remember. After all, he’d been quite out of it so it was possible he was forgetting something. His body had begun to respond, but it was nothing akin to his reaction the previous time. No, he was certainly missing something.
"Good girl. I'll be waiting."
John sighed and tucked the phone away. Well, that was just perfect. His one good part of the evening was about to be ruined like everything else.
“They really fell for it?” Kate asked later that evening, now that they were settled in their new safe house. “And you went to drop off his coat and everything?”
He was running out of theories so out of curiosity he clicked on it. It looked fairly average. Smiling couples on the homepage. He clicked the login box, but was surprised to see that unlike other sites, John hadn’t let it remember his username or password. Well, that was problematic. More for the username than the password issue (it was probably the same as his other logins).
“I’m fine,” he managed. “I rather let the moment get the better of me and the words that slipped out…” he paused and cleared his throat, “it was a mistake.”
“Hamish,” she said, rolling the name around in her mouth. On any other beautiful woman he might have found it erotic. But with Irene it was quite easy to ignore. “Scottish in origin? Quite handsome, though perhaps a bit old-fashioned. Would it be Hamish Holmes then? Or Hamish Watson?”
“I just handle it better than others do,” John said. “Really, he’s always a bit of an arse. Holidays don’t help either.”
His decision was cut off when John appeared coming down the stairs from his room.
It was a sort of mad scramble towards the bedroom. They had an unspoken understanding that Sherlock's would be easier to reach. And without further ado they were moving through the door, mouths still trying to kiss, hands grasping where they could.
“Yes, it is,” he said calmly.
“What in the bedroom?” John said with a chuckle, only to pause when he finally got to the door and saw the figure asleep on the bed.
That was all it took. John thought to himself that he'd never found a better way to shut Sherlock up. But by all means, this seemed to be the key. With a grin he allowed himself to be escorted into the bedroom, and with the door shut he let himself go in Sherlock's more than capable hands.
“Yeah, all right. I’ll see you in a while, Sherlock…” he paused in the doorway, looking meaningfully towards the detective, but he didn’t respond. “Oh well, don’t be surprised if he starts asking for me in a bit,” John said, looking towards her. “He’ll do that sometimes. Forget I’ve left. Well, best be off.”
John raised a brow, wondering where she’d gotten that information. He hadn’t talked to her much recently. Sherlock had been doing more cases by himself and as a result he hadn’t gone to Bart’s quite so frequently.
“What are you getting him involved for!” Lestrade hissed as soon as Donovan had passed out of the cafeteria.
(See the end of the chapter for
John looked the other boy over, wondering how easy it would be to punch him in the nose, kick him in the shin and then watch him topple to the ground. Too easy. But he was trying to do better this year. Fewer fights. Less drama. More focus on his studies.
“Unless someone more interesting comes along,” Irene said with a wink.
"I'll take good care of you," he went ahead and added, before adding another finger. He sought out Sherlock's pleasure, unable to contain his own sigh when he saw Sherlock's entire body arch into his touch.
“Er…no I think I’ll have to pass. I really ought to be coming—I mean going.”
“I’m done,” he muttered and jerked out of Donovan’s grip. Time to go find John and call the whole thing off.
“She’s a very lucky girl,” Molly said, smile still bright as ever. “To have someone like you.”
Mycroft’s sneering words had him at a loss. “The damsel in distress.”
Sherlock froze and stared at him for a long moment.
“There has to be someone,” Lestrade argued. “It’s a big school. I mean...I think crazy might be sort of our ticket you know…just not…criminal.”
Mycroft sighed again.
My jaw clenched as I looked away. Had I gained Sherlock back, only to lose her? Before I could choke up any further, Mary lifted my chin so I was staring at her once more.
"No," Sherlock said. "I just was thinking about Christmas Eve…"
And then Sherlock did the unthinkable. He leaned in and kissed Molly’s cheek. John felt his stomach drop, his whole body tensing as he stared at the man he loved kissing someone else. Married to his work? But apparently blood well able to kiss Molly after being horrible to her. John didn’t even know what to say. Thankfully he was interrupted from having to say anything by Sherlock’s phone.
“So what’s wrong? Trouble with Mrs. Hudson again? Or is it still this nonsense about dance school?” she said, hoping one of her guesses was close.
He sent both of the photos off to Irene’s number, waiting a long moment before a reply came with a breathy female sigh. Well, that wasn’t much of an improvement, but at least now it wouldn’t be John moaning through his phone.
“No, I mean it,” she spat at him as she slid her shoes on. “It’s heart-warming. You’ll do anything for him – and he can’t even tell your girlfriends apart.”
Molly sighed and shook her head. She remembered back to the years when their parents were alive. Sherlock had been…different. So carefree and happy and loving. Willing to do things with her, curl up beside her when she had nightmares, make a blanket fort in his room. She was stuck in nostalgia for a few moments before she shook herself out of it.
Sherlock didn’t remember the last time he’d felt this level of distraction. This level of inability to think, to reason, to process through the events of earlier. Irene Adler—the woman.
“Excellent begging,” Irene purred. “I knew you could, Mr. Holmes. Now, perhaps you and I should chat about Moriarty while Watson here takes care of his little...
Lestrade offered her a weak smile. Well, he’d learned a bit too much about Sherlock Holmes for his comfort. But at the very least they were a few steps closer. He’d pass on the information to Watson tonight, and with any luck they’d be home free from there.
“Hello Sherlock,” Moriarty said with a leer. “Had a good weekend did we?”
"No Sherlock always replies," John said, mind reeling. "He's Mr. Punchline. He will outlive God trying to have the last word."
He went over to pick up his violin, intent on finding something to distract him from the fact that some giggling bitch was sitting on his sofa room with her hand on John Watson’s knee acting like she owned the place.
But of course, within a few minutes it became apparent he couldn’t stay there acting like a besotted fool over John. No, he needed to move.
"Yes," John said without hesitating. He reached a hand out and laid it on Sherlock's shoulder. "Yes."
He turned and stared at the stage to avoid the eyes the other boy was making at him. Really this was becoming absurd.
“Not at all,” Moriarty said with a wink. “Catch you later, Sherlock.”
Just as he was about to finally reply, a noise came from his pocket.
It felt like ages before he finally wrestled Sherlock's shirt off. By that time the detective's fingers were working at the bottom of his jumper, pulling it up and over his head. John took a moment to admire Sherlock's toned chest before he fell back on him for more passionate kisses.
Molly gasped and pulled her hand away from the drawer. She flushed scarlet and shut it again.
So, on to showering in the meantime and then hopefully to fresher ideas, ‘til he could figure out the confusing mix of whatever had happened.
“So…can I see your room?”
“How so?” Sherlock asked.
Another text appeared on the screen.
She stared at him, looking him straight in the eyes. Within a few seconds he was squirming, and she knew she’d done her job well. She pouted a little bit more.
“I agree with my brother, I’m in no mood to be generous,” he said. “You are free to go as you like. But I’m afraid you’ll be given no protection. Think of it as your punishment. If you’re clever maybe you’ll survive a few more months at least. I’d enjoy them if I were you, Ms. Adler.”
“Not like yours,” Sherlock muttered. “But then again, we can’t all drug unsuspecting girls at parties now can we?”
“No. Prefer my own company, thanks,” John said.
“Please John, I…I can’t do this,” Sherlock begged. “You…you’re so wonderful and I…not while you’re drunk. It wouldn’t be real…And…you have a girlfriend”
“Oh, hi,” John said, doing his best to not slur his words. His head felt pretty fuzzy, and he had a good feeling Sherlock would see in a heartbeat that he was tipsy if not drunk.
Sherlock didn’t respond to the insult. “But you’ve acquired something that’s more danger than protection. Do you know what it is?”
She'd have to find another way to get the phone. Especially now that her cover was more than likely blown. She didn't expect John to be quiet about it unless Sherlock persuaded him to do so. But regardless of what John thought, Irene was aware Sherlock harbored no feelings for her. It wasn't her name he cried out during climax. It wasn't her he said he loved…
“I’m afraid this conversation will have to continue later. I have an important meeting in a few minute’s time. We can discuss this further this evening.”
Jeanette’s frown deepened and she glanced at her watch. “And Sherlock Holmes is a very lucky man.”
John rolled his eyes and shoved the phone away again. He turned his attention back to Cindi, kissing her, caressing her, enjoying her soft skin and attractive curves. He worked to get his clothes off, reaching for the condom in his pocket.
Kate pushed away from the wall, moving her hands to the dressing gown and untying it. Irene felt her mouth dry up as the fabric fell away to reveal smooth creamy skin only covered up by tantalizing black lingerie.
(See the end of the chapter for
Upstairs Sherlock went straight for his violin. Something to distract him. Anything. He didn’t understand John’s motives, and he likely wouldn’t any time soon with the man’s presence so close. No, he’d need to wait until he had some actual space to think before he worked on breaking apart those lies.
I swallowed, wondering why that comment seems so strange. I didn’t know why it should matter to him if I have facial hair or not.
“A drug sweep. If she is dead tonight is very likely to become a danger night. Can you do that for me?”
“He looked a bit upset. I’m not sure. Did you two have a little domestic?”
However, both of those failed to take into account the fact that only John had been interesting to him. He hadn’t been able to stimulate himself without that image of the doctor joining him in bed.
“What now?” she said with a sigh.
“The necklace, and probably the money too, would have both had grease stains from the bacon then. There’s a few other greasy fingerprints on the table area. Although a few of them are quite smudged nearer to the edge. Also, may I point out if this really was a true burglary, the criminal likely would have taken the fine silverware in your kitchen, or even your television set. No far too much left here.”
God, he needed to hook up again. It had been far too long since he'd had a proper shag. What with Jeanette running off before they could it had probably been almost a month now. He almost groaned aloud at the thought.
The other boy was attractive, enough so just in the general terms of aesthetics without looking so dashing in his suit. But to add to that with a casual smile on his face as he watched the performance, clearly at ease as he gazed on the dancers, that was simply too much. Sherlock tried to restrain a shudder and failed.
Irene distracted him from his thoughts by tossing a towel his way. She was busy straightening up the dressing robe, and he suspected she’d been enjoying watching. But of course, he refocused on Sherlock before he could think on it too much. John cleaned himself and his friend before he did Sherlock’s trousers back up carefully. After a moment he pulled away, even as Sherlock sat back on the couch, still regaining his breath.
“Of course I’m going to miss the dinner, there’ll be
Mrs. Hudson was fussing over everything. Getting the decorations up and making food for all of them. John finally managed to convince her to just leave a sign on the door telling people to come upstairs in order to get her to sit down for a bit.
“Mrs Hudson’s been attacked by an American. I’m restoring balance to the universe,” Sherlock snapped.
“No nothing like that,” Sally said. She looked towards Greg and noted that he didn’t look nearly as happy as he had a few minutes ago. “I’ll…er…talk to you later. It was…er…nice.”
She sat and waited. Nothing came. With a sigh she settled back in her seat. A game then. Even though she'd been informed it was over.
“You really think they’ll do something?” Kate asked, leaning closer.
“It’ll be all right,” he promised in a whisper.
Moriarty eyed him again, looking over the simple boy with a sigh. “If you don’t get any, I don’t get any,” he said. “So get some. Perhaps you’ll even enjoy it.”
The detective looked at him for a moment from where he was examining the windows. “Black, two sugars please.”
John wasn’t sure what to make of Sherlock coming so easily. He’d expected the boy to put up more of a fight.
There were so many moments it didn’t seem real. Even reaching for his still form, pulling a slim pale wrist out so I could search for a pulse. I kept expecting to find one, kept thinking there was no possible way it could really be happening. I had to be imagining things. I had to be dreaming. If I could just force my eyes open I’d be back in my bed in Baker Street.
“You’re not so bad,” she said, still looking him over quite hungrily. God, John just wanted this all to be over. He just wanted it to go back to him and Sherlock solving crimes without his stomach tying itself in knots every time Sherlock looked at him, or his jaw clenching every time he looked at Irene.
“That’s it, we’re done for,” he muttered as he watched the retreating boy’s figure.
“Good. Maybe a little more time of that, and a little less time fucking that pretty redhead bitch?”
“No,” John said, trying his best to salvage the situation. “
“Thank you,” she said. “Also, would you like my number? Wouldn’t mind seeing you again, Dr. Watson. I’m sure we could find lots of other mysteries for you to solve,” she said with a small wink.
“I’m sorry, John,” Sherlock said. He stared at John, those calculating eyes boring into him, stormy and mysterious and altogether beautiful. A shiver ran down John’s spine, and he tried to reach for Sherlock again. Another kiss. That was all he wanted. Make Sherlock know it was all right. He was aware of his body continuing to respond, erection showing him to be willing and eager and he just needed Sherlock’s mouth back on his…
Lestrade sighed and just looked away. He wasn’t willing to admit being wrong just yet. Not when he hadn’t tried anything.
Molly was unable to keep a smile at bay. The way he was looking at her, so pleading and puppy-like was simply adorable. Her heartbeat quickened a little. It was nice to feel wanted.
“Hmm…your texts don’t normally make that noise.”
His phone beeped once or twice more in their progress onto the bed. He glanced at it before he finally surrendered to Cindi’s attentions.
"If you admit you love him I'll tell him I'm alive," Irene said.
She tried to keep her voice steady, even as it shook slightly. Her mind took a turn to two years before. Hospital rooms and Sherlock’s prone body. She shook her head to clear the memories away. God, she didn’t want to remember that.
"What happened?"
“Oh had you,” he said with a smirk. “Hurry it up. I’m getting bored already.”
John's eyes closed as he worked to keep his emotions under control. God, why had it happened like this? Why not like any other couple falling in love?
I let out a laugh and leaned into him. I closed my eyes, and knew for the first time in months, if I had a kip there on the couch, Sherlock would be there when I woke up. This wasn’t some dream to end after I woke, it was a present reality I grabbed hold of without a second though. And hopefully it would continue to be so for many years to come.
“John doesn’t want to come, dear?”
. Sherlock’s one weakness it seemed. It had to be her.
As he began trying to focus on dissecting his frog, he noted something going on a few tables away from him.
Shannon had turned to give the camera a little wink. Irene smiled and closed the computer. That had gone even better than expected. Watson had thrown himself at her plant with no problems, while Sherlock had acted in clear jealousy. Oh the looks he kept shooting the two on the sofa. It was simply adorable.
But it had been just after that when things had gone south. Staring at John and losing himself in a whirlwind of thoughts for a moment. Memories and fantasies and a gambit of perfect saved mind palace images of John, his little shrine in the back room. And before he could even process what he was saying the words had slipped out of his mouth.
He made a noise into my mouth and I finally withdrew, sighing as I looked up at him, wondering if this was the moment where he again rejected me, told me I wasn’t quite what he was looking for or something like that. This was Sherlock after all. This was the man who solved hundreds of cases and could look at someone and figure out their life story. This man was brilliant and beautiful, strong and stoic, handsome and humorous. Could he ever even look at me and see an equal?
“No, she actually said she’s allowed to date!” Lestrade said. “Molly said so!”
They pulled up in front of Anderson’s. The party was already clearly in full swing.
“The flight of the dead,” Mycroft uttered.
“Provided less information,” Sherlock said with a sigh.
“Why did he leave?” Sherlock asked. “I thought he didn’t have work today.”
There was another moan and then.
“Good,” Irene said, ripping open her dress without a second thought. Kate rolled over and Irene quickly moved to straddle her. She leaned down to begin a passionate kiss, just as there was a loud crack and thump as the door was broken inwards. She heard them pause, watching, momentarily shocked, momentarily interested. She knew the idiots wouldn’t have any women or gay men with them, no one who could resist the siren call of hers and Kate’s beautiful nude bodies wrapped together in passion.
John stared at him for a moment, wondering what he’d missed. As far as he could tell, Holmes wasn’t usually the type to care what anyone else was doing. However, as he looked around for some kind of a cause for the odd behavior, Sherlock slipped away. By the time he’d looked back, Holmes had kicked off his shoes and climbed on top of one of the tables.
“What?”
“No. Thank heavens for small mercies,” Mycroft said with a smirk. “But that doesn’t mean I don’t care for your welfare.”
“John, you’re back. Was the sex really that bad?” Sherlock said.
“Not right now,” John said through gritted teeth.
“No,” John said. “Er…Mycroft. We…need to check the place. Make sure he’s clean…Mycroft thinks it’s a danger night.”
I stepped up into the familiar place as Sherlock was seeing some people out. He raised an eyebrow as I stepped in, but didn’t seem to protest. I went and sat in my old familiar chair, doing my best to avoid making eye contact.
“Oh, you know how the holidays get to me,” Sherlock said. “All the cheer and festivities…bah humbug.”
Molly frowned and glanced from Mary and back to him again.
And then he was stalking to the door, opening it and heading back into the living room as another orgasmic sigh broke out.
He looked up in time to see Moriarty pausing, turning around, eyes wide. A single brow rose and a look of surprise flashed over his face before it was contained again. Those familiar lips pursed.
“Your face is flushed, your pupils dilated, your breathing erratic. If I took your pulse I guarantee that would be higher too. I did this with the woman, John. Do you really not believe it will work on you too?” He gives this little half smile I’ve grown so fond of, and it proves his point, my heart leaping in my chest, stomach twisting almost painfully.
All her time playing the game and she’d lost. She wasn’t even sure if her plan with Sherlock and John had succeeded. She’d pushed them as much as she could and still the two stubborn idiots refused to budge.
“You always say such horrible things,” she said. “Every time. Always.
He’d never given head before. A few hand jobs, yes. But never this. It was different, but not unpleasant. Not repulsing by any means. And he found himself responding in kind as he saw Sherlock’s mouth drop open.
Lestrade shuddered. A teenage boy capable of acting like a mobster? It was hard to imagine.
Sally smirked slightly. Well, fun was a bit of an understatement in her opinion, but she’d let Irene get away with it.
Donovan glanced back and her eyes widened.
“Very good why?” Sherlock asked. “I still don’t see what reason he’d have to… come on to me… as you might say.”
“Come on, let’s get you home,” he said firmly.
Donovan let out a deep breath and closed her eyes for a few seconds. After a moment she opened them again, appearing only a tad bit calmer.
"I don't know."
He thought about denying it, but it was clear John had already caught on, so he managed to nod.
"Composing?" he asked, doing his best to smile even though he didn't feel the slightest bit happy at the moment. How could he with Sherlock acting the way he was?
Her fingers curled tight around the phone, eyes darting towards Kate on the bed, naked and peaceful and oh so vulnerable looking.
She just smiled. “I have more than you since I don’t discriminate.”
“Things just get weirder and weirder,” Lestrade muttered. “Say, you know what’s eating Sherlock? And that gift? You know anything.”
“Er, are you going to the party?” Molly asked, shifting as she clutched at her maths textbook.
Sherlock nodded and watched as Molly pulled down the sheet.
“Right. I’ll grab a turtleneck jumper instead. Just don’t want Lestrade suddenly asking questions.”
“No,” Sherlock said. “He’s tired. I thought I’d leave him be this evening.”
Sherlock did his best to smile. “Then let’s enjoy an evening, shall we?”
“Hello,” she managed to whisper.
“No, I’m quite awake,” Irene said.
“I will help you, Ms. Adler,” he said. “I could use an interesting case for once. Now, perhaps you’d like some time to clean yourself up before we sit you down to find out what precisely is the matter.”
“You never touch Mrs. Hudson again,” he hissed. “And don’t you even
“No worries,” John said. “We’ll pick some up later.”
“It’s not working,” she said.
The man snorted. “Perhaps. It is difficult to say with Sherlock. Very…private…that one.”
He grabbed the papers she’d thrust at him. “Oh um…that’s it? There’s nothing else I need to do?”
Mycroft stared at him for a long moment. “I thought we’d agreed you’d leave this silly dancing nonsense aside once you were finished with school. Actually apply yourself to science or philosophy…or something more…practical.”
“Oh shush you,” Irene said, reaching over to smack Kate on the thigh, though she smiled in spite of herself. “Now, be a good girl and go fetch me my tea. I intend to watch that footage over again. See just how well you’ve played our two darling boys. From the state of Mr. Holmes I’d have to guess quite well…but I need to see for myself.”
“Hope? What are you on about?” I managed to bite out. “Sherlock, there’s nothing to deny…I don’t fancy—”
John did his best to not sigh in relief. Good, so Sherlock hadn’t intended to give her the phone then. Just trick her. Perfect.
“Why not?” he said, cocking his head. “You made me beg you and John. Isn’t it your turn then?”
“Yes.”
“A year in the army?” Lestrade said. “Well at least he should be horny.”
“Jus’ thinkin’ I shou’ kiss you,” John slurred. “Keep thinkin’ ‘bout tha’ kiss.”
since auld lang syne.
He closed his eyes. Why did this have to be happening? Sherlock Holmes had to finally have feelings for someone, right around the time John started to realize how much he needed him. Sherlock and his bloody timing.
“I think it was less than five seconds.”
“Oh, come on. It’s not code. These are seat allocations on a passenger jet. Look ...,” Sherlock said, turning the screen round to show him.
Sherlock frowned. "I must breathe and allow my heart to beat—"
He hardly noticed when they arrived at the airport. He was still puzzling through John’s motivations. To deny his feelings yet participate in all that…to pretend it meant nothing to him. Why? The obvious answer hung in the balance. Sentiment. Something he still felt he’d never understand. But Molly’s answers weighed on him. And he knew the moment he returned to Baker Street he needed to press for some actual understanding.
“Cor, don’t say it that way, sounds pretty bad,” Lestrade said with a grin. “John taking his sexual frustration out on you.”
Irene smirked. “I’d like to see if Dr. Watson really could make you beg for mercy.”
God it was heaven. He groaned and clutched at Sherlock's shoulders as he eased in, looking down into those startling eyes that were staring up at him in pleasure. He pushed his hips a little harder, watching every expression on Sherlock's face before moving to claim his mouth in yet another kiss.
She tilted her head slightly. “Is that all? I’d have thought by now you’d have puzzled it out. You and your cleverness and all.”
“Yeah, seems like this bout has been lasting longer than normal though,” Lestrade muttered. “Especially with you.”
Her hand was on his, he stared down at it, wishing for the shorter blunter fingers of John instead. What would it take for that to be real?”
Donovan reached over to deliver a slap to his arm.
“So, you think Watson will actually date her?” Kate asked.
“Yes,” Irene said. “I think it is.”
“If you don’t mind, Ms. Adler,” Mycroft interrupted. “Perhaps we can move this to a more…comfortable and private location. I am willing to open negotiations. But not here.”
And then he was on the plane, wandering the aisles, staring down at passengers who were far too still. For a moment he thought they might be mannequins. But it quickly became apparent they were anything but.
John did his best to maintain a straight face while Mycroft told him all about Irene Adler and her recent "demise." Honestly it was altogether humorous watching the older Holmes make a fool out of himself in thinking how good he was fooling his little brother to protect his heart.
“Hmm…but you don’t flinch from his touch. No… well I’ll leave you to see to him then. Don’t worry, Dr. Watson. We’ll see each other again soon enough. I’d almost count on it.”
Sherlock narrowed his eyes and stared Watson over for a long moment. “I don’t know what you’re trying to pull?”
John went to sit down. “Oh no, it was…lovely. You…did a wonderful job…”
His mobile beeped. He looked down at the screen and frowned.
Sherlock didn’t answer, but was interrupted by Mrs. Hudson asking him to turn the thing down. John quite agreed, though he didn’t know how to say that without stating the obvious. And then Sherlock would simply have one more thing to mock him for. The detective himself didn’t appear the least bit bothered.
John snorted as he noted Anderson himself at the door, trying to dissuade people from not coming in. He watched as Sherlock shut off the car and climbed out, not bothering to look and see if John was following. Sure enough, Sherlock stalked right past Anderson muttering something about him needing to shut up and how his babble was lowering the IQ of the whole street. God, he could get used to following Holmes around, that was for sure.
“It was Cindi and we’ve broken things off.”
“And what would that be?” His tone was bored, but she knew she’d caught his attention.
“No, Sheloh, no. Want to keep kissin’.” He leaned in lips pursed slightly.
“Have I?” she asked, blinking. “Hmm well one forgets in such fine company. So…have you decided what you’ll do? Will you tell John?”
“Really?”
John wasn’t even sure why he’d decided to spend time in the sports hall. He was sitting on the bleachers, thinking about all the work he’d have to do for school once he arrived home. Sure, his nonchalant attitude was fun to try on the teachers and made him quite the legend around his fellow students, but he was determined to actually finish his schooling. After all, it would take more if he ever wanted to become a doctor.
“Out,” John said, grabbing his coat and throwing it on. “And I expect you not to text me unless there’s a case, understood?”
He did his best to keep a smile on his face as he walked forward, noting that Watson had a particularly sharp tool in his hand, and was glaring daggers in his direction.
I sighed and met his gaze. “About yesterday…”
noise—the one it just made.”
“We might both want to…er…make sure to cover up before going to the crime scene,” John said.
He blinked a few times, trying to catch up with her conversation. “What? I…I don’t follow.”
She moved to her car and Lestrade walked back towards his.
“Yeah, wasn’t working for me,” I muttered.
“So do I,” Kate said with a lusty wiggle. “And just a bit more of that, and I’ll be—ooh!”
She rose and walked over to the computer, fiddling with it until a new image popped up. Kate gazed at a room where the secretary was standing talking to several people. Kate recognized one of them as some inspector Sherlock was associated with.
“No,” Sherlock muttered.
“Oh really,” John said. “Pleasure’s all mine Ms…”
“I don’t see how this is relevant to my current experiment,” Sherlock said.
After what felt like ages, she finally pulled the device from her face. Her shoulders began to shake as she sank back onto the sofa again. Her eyes closed, and she simply gave in. For once in her life, she allowed herself to be beaten.
“Why would you?” He blinked a few times. Was that really possible?

“Are you punishing me, Sherlock? About the dance school? Is that what this is about?”
John only hesitated a moment before pulling Mrs. Hudson up and leading her to the door. Their eyes met momentarily, and Sherlock swallowed, doing his best to retain some semblance of control when all he wanted was to move forward and pull John into a kiss.
“Sherlock,” he tried, but the boy was already dancing, and people had begun to form a circle around him.
"I…I'm sorry…I didn't mean to…I…" the detective stammered, clearly horrified by the display.
Irene sighed and stalked off to the door. She paused only a moment, before heading out to face the reality that awaited her.
Donovan rubbed at her temple and finally looked at him.
Sherlock’s jaw clenched. “I’m not interested.”
Sherlock finally stopped his staring contest to look at him. “What did you say?”
“Mmm, want you so much,” John mumbled against his lips.
Her eyes strayed to his as he rose to go grab his coat. He knew she couldn’t come, so he drew near to bid her farewell. After all, who knew if she’d still be in 221 B when he came back.
Lestrade paused, mouth still half open. Donovan watched as his eyes roamed over the ground before his jaw snapped shut.
“Thank you,” she said, before walking him to the door.
Sherlock in the meantime remained still, gazing around the room and then back at Irene, only to become more puzzled. Finally his attention settled on John.
He struggled to piece it together still as he worked through his classes, and was still pondering when he went to meet Irene after school was finished.
Sherlock screwed his eyes shut all the tighter, thinking of John staring at him with that brilliant shining smile. Eyes glittering, warm and mirthful.
“Hmm yes back when you insisted you weren’t gay,” Irene said with an eye roll. Her eyes caught Kate’s in the mirror, boring into them with a level of heat that caused Kate to squirm.
“It’s getting late, I’m going to head out,” Lestrade said with a sigh. “Good night. Lovely to meet you, Jeanette.”
“Ah, take your time.”
“Sherlock.”
He ignored her mentioning herself, as though she might at some point be in this same position. He could hardly imagine it. But Sherlock had complied with her demands. And after all, he’d humiliated himself just for information. John was more than willing to give him the mercy he deserved. He put his hand in place and began to stroke softly.
Sherlock said nothing, too caught up in trying to make his deductions about John.
“Have a good night, Sherlock. I’ll text you later.”
(See the end of the chapter for
He watched Sherlock’s hand on the violin again. The man’s eyes were closed, concentration fully in playing a short little round of Christmas carols. Mrs. Hudson looked positively gleeful on the couch, still drinking. John sighed and decided to go make himself useful and make her some tea. The party had barely started and she was already tipsy.
,” he sneered. “How can John be having a birthday dinner, all his friends hate him. You only have to look at their faces.”
However, as they were pulling away, he looked up to see John’s face in the window. In the darkness he couldn’t make out an expression, but the curtain pulled back a moment later and then the light flicked off. Sherlock felt something in his stomach twist painfully, and then Lestrade was pulling away from Baker street, and he did his best to forget.
It was the last straw, the rage boiling inside hit a high point and I flung myself at him without a second thought.
“How is Sarah?” Sherlock asked.
Sherlock sighed. “Sounds boring.”
Sherlock said nothing still. He had no words. There was still so much to consider. The world passed around him in a blur as Mycroft led them back to his car. Mycroft selected the passenger’s seat while Sherlock and Irene slid into the back.
Sherlock had been looking forward to the ballet for months now. As soon as he’d seen the program for the coming year he’d found the simplest and most straightforward way to persuade Mycroft to buy them for him. Well…otherwise known as blackmail. Which was how he and Irene were sitting together, watching the various attendees pass by their prime seats.
There was a long moment of silence. Kate's expression was difficult to read. She kept her arms crossed as she studied Irene.
By lunch hour of the next day, Donovan nudged him on the way to the cafeteria and instead motioned towards the back of the school. Lestrade followed her down to a small dead-ended hallway in the basement. Five boys were waiting for them.
Lestrade shook his head. “No. You’re wrong. She’s…lovely.”
.” She turned her eyes meaningfully towards his pants.
“Forget Molly then,” Watson said with a shrug.
He pushed those memories aside in favor of considering the current case. Irene Adler, dead. It was odd really. He’d come to admire her. She wasn’t attractive to him in the slightest in terms of her beauty or her sexual allure, but her intelligence and cunning were incredible. It was rare for him to find someone so…complex to work with. And besides…she’d been the one to awaken some of his interest in John. Or perhaps to make him realize it. But his sentimentality was getting the better of him, and Sherlock soon schooled himself again.
John tried his best to not make things any more awkward than they needed to be, but the cab ride to the crime scene was rough. Sitting next to Sherlock, remembering what they’d done only shortly before. He’d try to subtly eye the detective, and thankfully Sherlock seemed to be off in his own little world, not paying a speck of attention to what John chose to do.
"Maybe," John said, unwilling to tell her outright that she clearly was. What else explained Sherlock's strange behavior the last few months.
Find me on
Sherlock groaned and sat up, reaching onto the ground and pulling his trousers up, rifling through the pockets.
He gasped and tore it open, hardly daring to contain his enthusiasm as he scanned the words.
“John,” Sherlock whispered. “While this is…pleasant…I’m convinced you’ll regret your actions come morning given how intoxicated you appear to be.”
“And to think this is only the beginning,” Irene said, pulling Kate closer and sealing their mouths together in a passion filled kiss.
“Clumsy… Sherlock my insurance does not cover your poor impulse control.”
The door slammed and John sighed. So much for a thank you. Giving up his girlfriend. Sitting here by himself reading a book while Sherlock possibly got high in his bedroom. Closest he would ever coming to being Sherlock Holmes' boyfriend.
Though that still didn't mean Kate had forgiven her.
“Perhaps you have a point,” Moriarty said softly. “But I’m guessing you want something for the information.”
“Well…there is one problem,” Molly said. “Er…I suspect the girls would be…problematic. I’m not…he’s never told me directly…but there’ve been rumors and it wouldn’t surprise me if…well I think he’s probably gay.”
At home I watched the telly for a while and then retired to bed. But it was in my dreams that the strangeness began.
Molly frowned and stared at her brother. “Why can’t you be normal, for once?”
“No, just was in the laundromat and saw your car. Thought I’d come over and say hello,” Watson said with a smile.
and surely I’ll buy mine!
? he thought to himself. But instead he turned with his violin in hand, fiddling with it, even as his eyes closed for a moment. Everything in him wanted to know why John had lied. He wanted to ask why John was so fascinated with Adler when all they should be talking about were the words he’d spoken earlier. But Sherlock knew now wasn’t the time and instead changed the subject.
“Oh…er…might just settle for the fettucine again. Was quite good last time,” John said.
“Mr. Holmes, I think we need to talk,” Irene purred.
Sherlock shrugged and reached out to put a hand to John’s face. The doctor froze up, staring at the detective.
Sherlock felt suddenly very out of breath. He managed a nod, trying his best to school his face, attempting to give John every indication this was merely to stop Irene from bothering them, not for any other purposes.
“Moron,” he muttered, giving the disgusting man one last glance before going to examine Mrs. Hudson.
“Hmm, bed? Why?”
“He’s…abnormal. What if he never dates?” Molly asked, voice rising another octave as she stared at her older brother.
John tried his best to not react.
Mrs. Hudson poked her head out of her doorway.
“Do you want to go back to your own bed?” Sherlock asked. “I can…help you.”
There was a noise from his phone, and he looked up from the computer, glancing at the screen to see yet another text from Irene Adler.
“Tell you? You’re too blind to read the signs. The burglar is in the room with us at this very moment.”
His mind was working faster over the information. Pressure points. Moriarty knew how to play people.
“Mrs. Hudson,” Moriarty said. “Is there any chance we could convince Sherlock to take his medication before class? Or has he just fallen too far out of reality and needs to be institutionalized?”
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “As always, thank you for your
An orgasmic noise from Sherlock’s phone. He had to be dreaming. He had to be hallucinating. He had to have hit his head or something—all that had happened continued to add up to some dream unfounded in reality. A sexy criminal walking into the room with no clothes, Sherlock kissing him, Sherlock making what seemed like advances on him, and now sex noises coming from his phone. Had he been watching too much pornography lately? Was this an effect of not having a girlfriend in the last few weeks? Was he this sex starved that his mind was supplying him with these situations?
“Marvelous.”
“The hint then if you please,” Sherlock said. He too had moved a hand up to his mouth, though only to brush a knuckle over his lips. John studied him a moment, wondering what that meant. Had he found it disgusting? Was he reminiscing what it felt like? Sherlock seemed practically asexual. Even now he didn’t seem the slightest bit bothered by Irene’s nudity, eyes fixed on hers rather than anything else. John shifted his gaze on the floor. Too much temptation in one room…too much confusion.
He stood and looked at Irene.
“No no no, I can get this,” Sherlock said. “No, Sarah was the doctor and then there was the one with the spots and then the one with the nose and then…who was after the boring teacher?”
But looking between the two men in the photos gave Irene chills. Until meeting Watson, Sherlock had lived alone, no friends, no real acquaintances. But something had changed when he began spending time with the doctor. Irene’s fantasies were only able to run wild with ideas. There had been rumors of course, but here seeing living proof before her eyes, Irene was convinced. Even if the two didn’t know it yet, there was a level of chemical attraction that made them just right.
He could picture his brother straightening up, voicing getting a little sharper. “Why? What’s happened?”
“If it was the end of the world, if this was the very last night, would you have dinner with him?” she asked.
He shook his head and looked away. Donovan looked slightly amused.
He let himself pay attention to the telly for a bit, drifting in and out of real awareness of the flat. He sipped at his drink, pouring another whenever he finished one. He was well on his way to getting thoroughly pissed when the door downstairs opened.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and stuck his phone back in his pocket. He turned back to John who was still staring at his neck.
“Er…yeah,” John said. “I did not really mean it. Just…wanted to make sure everything was all right. Just thought it would smooth things out.”
Irene jerked awake to a jarring noise. She pulled herself half off the sofa to look around the room, eyeing the various corners of the tiny hotel room, only to become satisfied that she was indeed alone. After a long moment she realized it was her phone.
Sherlock, however, grabbed his arm before he could truly disappear into the next room.
“It’s a very imprecise word,” Sherlock said. “Perhaps you can clarify your intentions in using it. Are you saying you…desire me? I initially was sure this was what you were describing, a tangible biological response where your body is giving you signals that you are interested in potential copulation. However—”
“We’ll deal with it,” John muttered. He turned back towards the door as though to leave, probably still focused on getting some eggs for breakfast.
The worst was the final one, the confrontation of feelings I needed in my life but that found me in sleep instead.
"Fine," he said after a moment. "Fine…I love Sherlock Holmes. Was that what you wanted?"
To a certain extent, there was a benefit in being able to talk about everything that happened, but at the same time it dragged up those painful memories a second time. I tried so hard to just bury it all. But I suppose it’s not entirely possible to throw pain and anger and confusion into the coffin alongside the body and hope all of those will just rot away underground if you let them.
“Oh hi Greg,” she said. “Have you met Mary?”
He moaned out the name stuck in his mind, and before he could process anything else he was coming.
. He just recognized the attractiveness of his friend, that was it. It’d been a weird week. Give it a day or two and he’d be back to his normal straight self. Just give it a few—
Instead he smiled and took it in his own, giving a firm shake.
She turned to look at him, admiring the half-panicked expression, the way his hair was sticking out that let her know he’d been running his hands through it one too many times. Boys. Honestly.
“I needed help,” Irene said.
“Hello, Ms. Adler,” Sherlock said in a low voice. “To what do we owe your visit?”
“What can you do, Mr. Holmes?” Irene purred, leaning forward over his shoulder. Her mouth was right by his ear. Whatever she said next, John couldn’t hear. But her eyes flicked up to look at him as she did, still smirking and even adding a wink in.
“Merry Christmas, Mycroft,” he said.
“The heart to your brain. As you said. I suppose your little games with John and I make sense now. Living vicariously probably.” He snorted. “You said killers were after you. CIA would never have actually done away with you. Locked you up maybe. So who could that be? Why the man you mentioned earlier. Moriarty. And while he might have given you advice, I highly doubt it was free. So he wanted information? Information you did end up giving him. But at what cost? No, he had something more on you than simple helpful advice. He was the reason you faked your own death. He was the reason you ran. But it wasn’t for you. No.”
She huffed, but did disappear again, leaving him to head up the stairs.
“What are you doing here?” he demanded.
“Necessary for what?” John asked. But Sherlock seemed to disappear into his mind palace for a few moments. John rolled his eyes and settled for going over to open his laptop up. Perhaps he should just consider what the latest update on his blog should be.
“I mean I know we don’t have any money really either,” Lestrade pointed out with a frown. “But…hey it’s an idea.”
Sorry for the late update. I have three WIP’s right now, and this one just isn’t my favorite. Nonetheless, I do want to continue.
“John, timing,” Sherlock muttered, thinking of all the lectures he’d been given on the subject himself. He might not know much, but he was aware this was wrong.
Lestrade smirked. “Ah, well, doesn’t mean you couldn’t find one. You seem like a decent girl. Got to be someone willing to put up with you.”
I was washing up for bed, staring in the mirror and wondering if I really should shave the blasted thing off if it was clear nobody liked it but me. However, I decided to wait until morning to do so, figured I’d get some sleep and be feeling more together in the morning. I sighed and headed out of the washroom to find Mary sitting in bed. Normally she has a book she reads before we turn in, but that night I found her sitting up, just watching the door. She gave a half smile when I came out.
Sherlock frowned and did his best to keep disappointment out of his expression as John disappeared upstairs. Bed? It was barely even ten. That was atypical to say the least. All of these odd behaviors and Sherlock still couldn’t make a clear deduction other than the obvious that something was
“I made a bargain, Mr. Holmes. And I do intend to follow through,” she said, throwing him a sultry smile. “So sit down. We’ll discuss the few things dear Jim told me.”
“John,” she said calmly. “I want to talk about what’s going to happen next.”
“What…what should I do to make my feelings apparent? Beyond actually saying them aloud,” Sherlock said. “I want…I want to show her I care about her. I want to show her I can change if that’s what she wants.”
“It’s unfair,” Molly said, folding her arms. “In many societies I’d be considered a woman by now. I should have the rights to choose whether or not I date. Once I graduate I’m going to be a complete wreck not having gotten all of the awkward first time nonsense out of the way. I’m likely the only person in the school who’s not currently dating.”
Irene drew back, smiling ruefully. “Too late.”
All she knew now was that it was time to run again. She had little doubt her cover was blown. And as much as she wanted to keep playing matchmaker, dying wouldn’t serve her purpose…or at least not really dying.
The other detective folded his arms and sighed. Sherlock in the meantime was now looking through the rest of the place. Carefully examining the table where the jewel had been left, wandering back to the kitchen to look things over.
Sherlock had sort of, slumped against him. He’d begun babbling something about how comfortable his arm was. And then—then Sherlock’s hand had drifted down to his trousers.
The boy in the suit shrugged. “I’ve occasionally done a bloke. But only for sex. I can’t risk my reputation with something so public as dating I’m afraid. And certainly not with someone so…freakish.”
“The don’t-even-think-about-it one,” Donovan said. “Molly Holmes. She’s a sophomore.”
John was still trying to process everything that had happened over the course of the day. Sherlock sitting in Buckingham Palace wearing only a sheet, Sherlock disguising himself to go meet Irene Addler, or The Woman, or whatever the hell she was supposed to be called. And then being allowed to punch Sherlock in the face. What a day.
He scowled not thrilled at having Sherlock's words quoted back to him like gospel.
Lestrade’s jaw dropped open. He glanced back at the boy in the car, high cheekbones and scathing eyes all topped with dark curls. There was nothing remotely similar to Molly.
“Yes,” Sherlock said, trying to keep the edge out of his voice. “I am.”
John shrugged.
He grinned. "I'd love to, Sherlock Holmes. Now, if you're quite finished running that smart mouth of yours, I'd rather put it to better use."
“Office,” she said with a wave of her hand, not even bothering to look at him.
“I’m your guardian, that is my right,” Mycroft said in a dull tone. “Don’t confuse my practically for sentiment, brother.”
The door shut, and Sherlock breathed a sigh of relief. He rolled over, a hand reaching down to push his pants aside. It had been a long time since he’d done something like this, but nonetheless, the soft touches made some of the heat dissipate, allowed a small amount of respite. He breathed deeply, trying to quiet any sighs or moans, knowing John was just outside listening in to make sure there wasn’t anything wrong. Mmm John…
“Do I mind what?” Sherlock said. “You’re the one intruding on the ballet I’m trying to enjoy.”
“Of course I wasn’t going to punch his nose or mouth,” John said, glancing back over at Sherlock. “But that doesn’t mean I
Sherlock froze at that. Molly had presented two real possibilities. And both had him terrified. Either John really did love him but was worried his feelings might scare Sherlock off. Or, the alternative was that John really did love him…but felt that they wouldn’t really be a good couple together. And with their history together, that was certainly probable. That John was happy living with him, but thought that Sherlock was too…Sherlock to possibly merit anything more. After all, it wasn’t implausible for someone to find him attractive. Molly herself was evidence of that. But even she seemed to have moved on by now. He glanced her over and saw more than one sign that she’d had sex in the last week.
John was lying. A small voice in the back of his head whispered it was sentiment getting the better of him. But there were too many signs. Every bit of the way John had said that had seemed like an invention…his nervousness and his inability to keep it simple. All he’d needed to say to Sherlock’s question was yes. Instead he’d rambled. Created. Done his best to keep a story going.
“Well, we all do silly things sometimes,” Molly said with almost a giggle in her voice.
I sighed. “She won’t have me until I’m sure you’re not in my future. She said she couldn’t marry me knowing I might wonder what would have happened if I’d told you. I love her…just not the same way I love you. I could be very happy with her. Probably happier than I’d ever be with you…but…that doesn’t mean I can just deny what I’m feeling.”
“Okay,” Lestrade said, straightening.
"I love you too," he whispered. "Now, how about we finally have a good shag, what do you say?"
“Um…hello,” he said. “I was just wondering if you’d…”
“Sally Donovan. Call me either. I’ve been asked to show you around,” she said.
She gave a feeble smile and nodded. “At least if he’s happy that’s something. As I said, I suppose I don’t have much to live for anymore.”
“Sherlock, this man was at the door. Is the bell still not working?” she asked.
“He fell out a window,” Sherlock said before hanging up.
It takes him a minute to process that, but soon he realizes his mistake.
“Then go ahead and undo his trousers. And if you’d like a little bit of fun for yourself in the process, undo yours too.”
Donovan sighed.
, Sherlock thought.
He was roused from his thinking by the bathroom door opening. He glared in the general direction, watching as Irene stalked out wearing one of Sherlock’s dressing robes. He was only thankful it wasn’t his favorite. If that had been the case he might have flown at her to rip it off….or maybe not. That would likely put Sherlock in an even more awkward position again.
His eyes traced the London streets, trying to focus on the details speeding by instead of the thoughts racing through his mind. He kept replaying the kiss, John’s soft lips on his, the man’s body practically pressed up against him. So beautiful and strong and fragile all at once. John…
“Okay,” John muttered.
“Never fear, darling. A little patience is all this game requires. Now, I must be off to see that client. You’ll be alright for another hour, won’t you?” Irene asked, glancing her over with obvious care.
He put out his palm and waited. Sure enough, five twenty pounds were placed neatly in his hand. He crumpled them up and shoved them into a pocket.
Their ride over was mostly silent, but when they arrived at Angelo’s, Sherlock did his best to put on his best manners.
“Oh that’s sweet of you dear, but it’s all right. Sherlock has been in a mood for quite some time now,” she whispered. “What happened with you two?”
“No, it was me,” Sherlock assured her.
“Mmm,” the other man said, slumping against Sherlock’s chest. “Nice.”
“It was sooooooo romantic,” she said.
Irene smirked at him, and he knew she must have heard. Well then, he’d simply have to remark on her having sex with a politician’s wife then. The perfume really did make it obvious, she should have known better.
They were interrupted by Mycroft returning to the room, telling Sherlock to leave Irene alone. The challenge in the detective’s eye bothered John. Sherlock never was good at leaving things alone…and the last thing John wanted was more time around Irene Adler. The woman was clearly up to no good, and he feared what further contact might do to the already confusing relationship.
. He made Sherlock feel…god…
“Are you really going to just give up on doing anything with your life?” Molly asked, eyebrows furrowed. “But Mr. Stanford was telling me how well you do in his biology lab. He mentioned that you’d been talking about apiology. Or perhaps you’d find something in chemistry more suitable. Or even your violin to be honest. You’re quite good at that.”
Sherlock sent her a hard stare. It was in that moment he decided to end the Moriarty problem before it could even begin. He glanced at Molly before looking at Mycroft. “You’re getting slow. How have you not worked out that she took a ride home today?”
She pursed her lips. “And you, Mr. Holmes. What would you do with a few months left?”
He stiffened. “Your little sexual games prove nothing. As you said, love is not the equivalent to lust. John might have proven enjoyable, but sexual stimuli proves nothing on my feelings.”
Mycroft wasn’t home yet, so he grabbed a chemistry book and settled down on the couch to read with a cigarette in his hand. He could hear music from Molly’s room and knew better than to even approach her when her door was closed. She’d either be absorbed in the latest Glee episode or studying for the next biology exam. Neither was a time to interrupt her.
John did his best to feign surprise, especially while Mycroft explained about the terrorist cell and the beheading.
John turned and stared just in time to see a dark figure disappearing off in the opposite direction. John felt like his heart might stop beating. Sherlock was there. Sherlock had heard him. God, he could never take those words back. They were out there.
