There's a self-deprecating note in her voice, something woeful and forlorn, and Dean knows it well. He turns and appraises her, smiling warmly.
“Why are you?” the boy counters and Cas smiles. Lexie has his cheek pillowed on Cas’ shoulder and is staring up at him with wide eyes. Cas naturally rocks him a little and Lexie lets out a content sigh. “It's nighttime.”
Later, when he's sitting at his desk with his second Starbucks of the day and a fresh shirt on, Gabriel texts him to say that Castiel might drop by tonight. No reply from Dean yet, to any of his texts or calls, but WhatsApp tells him his brother has been online in the last hour. The fact that he's ignoring Sam totally is, oddly, reassuring. If his brother has gone to ground, he'll characteristically need some time before resurfacing, and Sam can work with that.
Sam had shaken himself free with his own skyward look, the expression of the long-suffering, and had patiently followed Dean as he’d snaked his way through the crowd, greeting friends and colleagues, and hitting up every beer stall he finds. The sun feels hotter now than it has in recent weeks, and Dean’s skin is turning that pinkish-brown that means he didn’t put on enough sunscreen this morning. The lecture about skin cancer can probably wait until tomorrow - he’s not
“Yeah,” Dean drops his head to Castiel’s shoulder and breathes him in. The steam is cocooning them both, hiding them away from the outside world. He feels safe, as though he never wants to leave this shower ever. “Are you?”
“No…” he hears himself say. “No, I didn’t. This isn’t right. He was getting better…”
Later, in the early evening at the base of the Grand Staircase, while stewards and guests mill around, they’re introduced to some of the other passengers they will be sharing their journey with.
“Dean,” Amara says slowly, sliding her coat from her shoulders as she takes in the sight of the papers. “What's this?”
, for all her help with this and I couldn't have done it without her.
Soon, warm lips brush the nape of his neck and Dean’s arm winds around his waist, pulling him close against his body.
But now, Sam’s concern feels justified, and he's kicking himself for not pushing Dean harder in their past conversations. He's seen for himself the spiteful, vicious streak Amara has in her but now he's starting to wonder if it's more than that. If she's capable of more than just throwing the odd insult at Dean, more than just bossing him around like a child.
He knocks again, awkwardly, and almost drops the flowers. This was a stupid idea, and he’s starting to wonder if maybe Cas had spied him through a window and is avoiding him on purpose. He knows it’s kinda early to be dressed up as though he’s heading for the opera, and he didn’t expect to see Castiel’s car outside his house when his cab from the airport took a detour and just so happened to pass down this particular street. He wonders now why Cas is home early, and suddenly worries if he’s ill. He knocks again, a little louder, then tries the handle. To his surprise, the door opens easily and he’s left staring into Castiel’s hallway. Castiel never leaves his door unlocked - his neighbourhood certainly isn’t a bad one but there have been break-ins and trouble in the past, so Cas takes no chances. He deposits the flowers and chocolate on the hallway table and calls Castiel’s name, quietly at first then louder, then falls silent to listen.
He opens the door and stands back to let her in before him. She shrugs off her coat and hangs it on the hook, turning away from him and heading to the kitchen without taking off her stiletto heels. He sighs. They just had wood floor laid a couple of months back and she knows he hates it when people don’t take their shoes off before walking on it. He just doesn’t want it damaged before its time. Even Sam doesn’t let the dogs go running in there, he keeps them on their leads or directs them into the living room. Quashing his irritation, he follows her. She was silent the entire drive home, kissing Gabriel and Sam politely on the cheek as they left but then dropping his hand the second they reached the Impala. He’d played some music, some AC/DC to try and lighten the mood, but she’d remained cool and stony, resistant to any attempt at conversation. They’re going to fight, he knows it. May as well get it over with.
“I love you…”
Smirking at his brother and shrugging in a helpless fashion, Sam links arms with Jo and, laughing together at Dean’s grumbling and grousing that follows them close behind, begin to pick their way through the remainder of the crowd. The early evening sun is warm on his skin, and they cross the street to where the cop with the aviators and the deep summer tan is standing directing the crowd. Charlie’s red hair stands out, bouncing as she waves enthusiastically at them, and he’s sure he can see Benny in a leather vest, matching pants and not much else. For the hundredth time, he wonders why Dean and Benny aren’t still together. They’d seemed like such a great couple, but at the very least they’ve managed to remain friends somehow which he supposes counts for something. Sometimes he wonders if Dean still pines after Benny; he catches him staring at him sometimes with an odd, faraway look in his eyes.
“Isn’t that Castiel?” Sam points over Dean’s shoulder and he turns, interested. He’s heard the name before, and he wracks his brain to remember why.
“To Samwise and myself,
Castiel strokes his back. The water runs a few degrees cooler. “No, Dean. I’m just hiding it better. It was awful for me, too. I’ve almost lost him twice, now. I can’t go through that again.”
“Morning,” Cas says, stifling a yawn. Dean's arm is warm around his waist and he wraps his arms up around his neck, leaning into the kiss. Then Dean smiles against his lips mischievously before Cas is dipped backwards, low to the ground with their lips still joined, and a laugh bubbles up inside him and breaks free as the children giggle somewhere in the background. When Dean lifts him upright again he's breathless and smiling.
They're good together, Castiel and Meg. A good match when it comes to sexual chemistry. They're rarely unsatisfied when the other is around. As he straightens his clothing out a while later, fastening the buttons of his shirt and reaching up to try and tame his hair somewhat, he thinks for the millionth time that she deserves to meet a good guy. Someone who can give her more than he can, someone she
Or his conversation with Sam over breakfast might be more candid than he intended.
“I can't do it, Jimmy. I can't marry Dean.”
“Bobby isn’t,” he murmurs, allowing the guilt to crash over him like a wave breaking on the sands. Amara shakes her head.
By that time, it’s pretty late - almost midnight, and the snow is coming down heavy outside. It’s almost Christmas.
Maybe he should wish for it this Christmas.
I miss these boys already ♥ Enjoy!
He gestures to the steward to lead the way, feeling Ruby’s fingers squeeze his forearm as she moves in close to his side.
Less than ten minutes later, he's walking down the Main Street with Lexie on his shoulders and Billie tottering along happily crunching on a cookie, while Cas follows a few paces behind talking on his phone. The weather is blissful, hot and dry with a refreshing breeze on the air, and as they wander towards the car to head home Dean thinks life in this small town is pretty damn good.
Across the room, Lexie coughs into his hands.
“Lock the door.”
wasn’t obvious?” In spite of his - admittedly weak - protests, Dean can feel his cheeks flaming. “I don’t care that you still see Mick.”
“You’re taking this all better than I am.”
, and damn he still can't get used to that - holds the door open for two little twin boys dressed in blue denim shorts and t-shirts with inspirational slogans on them, and smiles as they immediately run up to the counter to press their noses and palms against the glass. His gaze then travels to Dean and the look in his eyes warms immediately, then fades in confusion as he hears the background music playing.
He snorts a laugh at the note - how typical of Jack - then, fumbling with his bowtie, he exits the room and heads for the stairs, ignoring everyone he passes.
“And the award for best-dressed couple of the night goes
He’s still reeling from his explosive fight with Cas. That entire evening had been a nightmare from start to finish, and he keeps going over and over it all in his mind, thinking of different things he could and should have said. He wishes he’d tried harder to stop Cas from leaving, regrets not keeping a closer eye on Billie, and wonders what else he could have done to avoid the inevitable fallout. Anything? Sure, he could have locked the front door, he could have kept a closer eye on the child, he could have fought back when Cas threw such cruel words at him... but ultimately, would it have made any difference? Would this argument have happened at another point down the line anyway? It feels like it. It feels like Castiel has been storing up grievances for some time now, perhaps longer than Jimmy dares to imagine, and they were bound to come out sooner or later.
“I’m leaving,” he bends to kiss Meg on the cheek, his hair damp from the shower and droplets falling onto her bare skin. She pushes him away, smiling lazily.
He doesn't know what to do to help his twin, but he does know that contacting Dean would only push Cas further away from him. Cas has been betrayed by people in the past, Dean included, and adding himself to that list of people could break them forever. It may be a price he's willing to pay in the future, but that day hasn't come yet. For now, he's wallowing in his own misery and doing a damn fine job of it.
“Sir, could you move off the street, please?” Even his
“And how long do you have left?” Her eyebrow is raised and her foot moves higher, past his knee. His jeans feel almost uncomfortably tight and he reaches down to adjust himself, pushing his chair away from the desk.
with such marks, displaying them in such a vulgar way. It makes him dislike the guy even more, and he turns away in disgust. For all the ways Castiel can be liberal in the bedroom, he can also be quite a prude and he knows it.
He straightens again suddenly as the tone of his cousin’s voice sinks in. Gabriel is normally fun-loving and excitable and usually would never pass up the opportunity to laugh at Castiel’s expense. But today he sounded flat and emotionless, and his feeble attempt at a joke had fallen utterly flat. Castiel knew then that whatever reason Gabriel was calling him for, it wasn’t a good one.
He extracts himself from the bedding and pads to the kitchen, pouring a glass of cold water and drinking it slowly as he leans a hip against the counter, unconcerned with his nudity in the silence and solitude of the dark apartment. The only light seeping in comes from the streetlamp outside, and the blissful quiet is punctuated by the sound of cars going past infrequently. A dog barks somewhere below the window. Meg lives above a thrift store and spends the majority of her weekly pay in there, frequently showing up at Castiel’s bookshop to show him her latest bargain. Her red dress is draped over the back of the couch, crumpled now, her heels discarded beneath it. An empty wine bottle is on its side on the coffee table with two wine glasses next to it. God, they were drunk. No wonder his head is pounding.
“That’s mighty cryptic of you,” Dean says, patience beginning to wear thin. “And I’m sure half the folk in this room would take offence at being compared to steerage.”
“What is it?”
for the delay with this chapter. The reason why can be found
Then he’s gone, the door to the diner opening and closing in an icy blast and a flurry of snowflakes. Sam watches him cross the street to his car and Dean kicks him under the table for being such a sap.
“Yeah,” he manages, the sound coming out weak and cracked. “I’ll be out in a minute.”
“Yeah,” he murmurs, eyes open now, watching the ceiling. She doesn't say anything but he feels her shift, shimmying out of her underwear then he hears it hit the floor somewhere on his side. She presses up against him, nude, and he doesn't move. Her fingers trail up his chest, nails scraping lightly.
Things go from bad to worse with disconcerting speed.
“Neither was I. But Amara wouldn't let me hear the end of it if I didn't. She thought I was joking when I said I’d rather stay in and watch reruns of Dr. Sexy.”
Castiel has turned his back, but the guy’s curious question makes him glance over his shoulder, incredulous.
“I don’t like boats,” Dean says simply and the man smirks at him.
With a quiet sob, Billie turns and runs off down the hall. The sound of his bedroom door opening and closing is the only thing that echoes after him.
“I can go today. You guys are becoming close, huh?”
Every Pride parade starts out the same for the both of them. They both linger on the fringes, drinking beer at listening to music, watching the performers, just hanging out. Then Dean has a couple beers, then a couple more, then soon they’re walking among the crowd, laughing and joking and Dean usually attracts a few hot, older guys who cling to him for a while and try to draw him close so they can dance or make out or whatever they want to do. Dean is polite, charming, but dismisses them with disinterest. He isn’t here to hook up, he’s here to have fun, and Sam is always thankful he isn’t left standing alone while Dean amuses himself with a stranger. Not that Dean hasn’t had his fair share of one night stands - he definitely
“Oh, yes. I want to go to St. Barts. I read something in the
That evening after work, Castiel goes to the gym to activate his pass. He has to swing by the mall on his way to pick up a couple of things since he can't lay his hands on all of his gym kit. ‘A couple of things’ winds up being shorts, sweatpants, three t-shirts, sport socks and a pair of brand new Nikes. And a bag to put it all in. He's far too susceptible to the sales latter of assistants and he grumbles all the way back to his car.
“I am staying…” he reassures him.
Sam had hoped that a trip to Europe would lighten Dean’s mood. See a bit of the world, drink wine in Paris, visit the Moulin Rouge for a night of fun and debauchment. Dean had certainly seemed to enjoy it - he had woken up the following morning in just his shirt and bow tie, a handsome Middle Eastern young man on one side of him and a young woman with tumbling blonde curls on the other side. But even that hadn’t seemed to bring any light back to his eyes. He was listless, dismissing endless love affairs as mindless fun, and drinking more wine in a single evening than Sam could consume in a week. For a few days in Prague, Dean vanishes without a trace. When he turned up, he had bruised knuckles and a split lip and a grim set to his jaw, and barely spoke a word for days. His breath smelled of alcohol and he slept late every morning. Sam was concerned, of course. But he had his own problems to deal with, in the form of one Jessica Moore, and one Ruby Cortes, both vying for his attention and affection, and both presenting entirely different opportunities. Sam was preoccupied, but couldn’t deny he was enjoying the attention. And as a result, Dean was slipping from his radar.
“You’d better take a seat and watch then, Deanna.”
Dean lies awake all night and at a little past four in the morning his anxiety gets the better of him and he has to disentangle himself from her and the bedding to go and throw up in the bathroom. This is becoming a regular thing, lying awake and working himself up so badly that he makes himself ill. He needs to get it under control, to man up and stop having constant pity parties for himself. He has everything he ever wanted. He's
It's late and they should be in bed. The sun has long since set and the only light now comes from the full moon and the scattering of stars, and a low light emanating from somewhere down the hallway inside. There are four empty beer bottles and two empty plates on the table, and Cas has his bare feet up on the arm of the rattan outdoor sofa with his head in Dean’s lap. Dean is stroking his hair idly, winding his fingers through the strands, and they're both gazing up at the skies lost in thought.
“Made you look, Winchester. But you’re not as cool as you think. So you think he’s cute, go talk to him! What’s the worst that could happen?”
He breathes in deeply, but before he can let it out the door opens and closes behind him.
Dean glances up then, a shadow of indignation behind his eyes. “I valet Baby perfectly fine by myself.”
“Yes. He’s on a bit of a health kick - want to lose those few extra pounds, you know?” Amara laughs lightly in a way that Sam suspects is meant to conspiratorial. “Of course, I think he’s fine just as he is but he’s really got it into his head that he wants to work out more. But as long as he feels good about himself, what does it matter?” Her smile is unflinching and Sam just about manages to crack a brittle one in response.
And then he did.
“Need to relax, little brother,” Dean had slurred. “You’ll give yourself a nosebleed.”
“Neither can I, sweetheart. C’mere,”
“Let me in?”
Abused.
He’d been sick with paranoia for days that Sam and Gabriel would turn up on his doorstep in some kind of intervention, dragging him away from Amara and back to their place, if Castiel had told them exactly what had gone on that night. The fact that they haven’t seems to suggest that they aren’t in possession of all the facts, and for that he’s thankful. He doesn’t want Sam knowing what an utter failure he is, doesn’t want him jumping to the same inaccurate conclusion that he fears Castiel had reached first of all - that he, in some way, had hurt Amara. He couldn’t. He doesn’t have it in him.
Thank you for all the love and comments, and for your patience with this fic. I've had some exciting personal news so it's taking up a bit of my time, so I appreciate you all waiting on these updates ♥
“No!”
“It’s no problem at all.” The cop releases his hand and smiles. “I think your friends must have realised you’re lost. I believe they’re looking for you.”
Men, women and children are flocking down the streets towards the dock, laughing and chattering and pointing in the early morning sun. There’s a chill in the air, especially this close to the sea, and Sam tugs his coat a little tighter around himself to ward it off. They’re running a little later than Sam would have liked, but still in good time for the noon departure. He wants at least an hour to settle into his cabin before they venture out onto the deck to wave as the ship sets sail on her maiden voyage. He’s arranged for Jessica to have a cabin directly opposite from his, so he can be on hand immediately if she needs anything at all. She should already be on board, having set off with her mother and aunt early this morning and aiming to be one of the first to board the ship. Her mother, a formidable woman with curly blonde hair and a barking voice, would no doubt have been first in line if she’d got her way.
For the first time all week, he's warm. And for the first time in as long as he can remember, he doesn't dream.
Dean leans in, kisses Cas on the mouth and smiles into him. “Not the length of time we take in the shower. I’m not sure I’m up to it, Cas. Blame stress or something.”
And on top of it all, Castiel’s words are swimming in his mind, pushing themselves in where they're not wanted. The expression on his face and the careless way he spoke of Dean’s drinking and his relationship and his life, it had almost been too much. And now, it haunts him. He wants so badly to go back in time and set Castiel straight, tell him that things are fine with Amara and he's just a social drinker and that Castiel is barking up the wrong tee. That his life is just fine and Castiel has no business commenting on it at all.
He smiles to himself, leaning back in his chair and clicking the mouse to reactivate the screen. His wallpaper of a kitten hanging from a branch greets him along with a notification of incoming emails. Two first-edition book requests that could take him months to source, and a confirmation that his translated notes on a lesser-known Nabokov work had been received by his agent. He sighs, eyeing the roses balefully before getting back to work. They sit there on his desk, staring back at him, impervious to his workload.
psychologist. Quit thinking you know it all and just accept this for what it is - you, me, and a damn good time. But if that ain’t enough for you any more then I guess I’ll just see myself out.’
Then she’s gone, leaving the kitchen in silence, turning the light off and leaving Dean standing alone in the dark. He pours himself two fingers of whiskey with a shaking hand, adds an ice cube, and stands in the dark kitchen drinking slowly. When he's finished, he pours another glass. Three fingers. It helps. By the time he ventures upstairs, he feels more mellow and walking into his bedroom to face Amara doesn't feel quite so daunting. His cheeks smarts, the bone beneath it aching. It won’t bruise, but it hurts. And he hurts elsewhere in his body, inside, beneath his heart. He feels sick and the alcohol doesn’t help, churning in his stomach, burning his throat. But he needs it. He can’t begin to rationalise all this without it.
Thank you once again to Tricia for being so awesome and getting these beta'd so fast. Where have you been all my life?!
shouldn't have to be the breadwinner in this family. What happens when we have kids? How do you plan on supporting us?” She's sneering now, her red lips twisting unpleasantly. “You need a
“Of course you do, sweetie, that’s what I told him.” She says, soothingly, and Dean seems somewhat mollified as he turns back to the barbecue. “I’m going to go and relax until dinner. Come and find me when it’s ready.”
He taps on the bathroom door which opens a little at the impact, and he frowns. There’s no cloud of steam emanating from inside which is peculiar as Castiel’s showers are almost hot enough to scald his skin. A slightly sick feeling of concern beginning to coil in his belly, Dean pushes the door open all the way and stares, wide-eyed, at Castiel.
“Cas?” He whispers and receives a slow, sluggish look in his direction in return.
“What's up? Why are you awake?”
What do you think of Castiel's approach to Dean so far? And is it time for a serious intervention?
“Yes, I know. I’ve been watching you and your brother since you boarded.” The man sips slowly from his own glass, regarding Dean with a strange type of interest. His gaze is curious, yet simultaneously dismissive, as though he wants to know a little more about Dean but thinks that whatever he might find out will be of little interest to him. “New money, aren’t you?”
“Are you coming home now, daddy?”
“I don’t doubt that. And the ‘fun’ element is what makes me think Cassie would be the worst guest you could hope for. He doesn’t exactly do ‘fun’, at least not in the traditional sense. His version of fun is watching beekeeping documentaries on NatGeo.” Gabriel shrugs in a ‘what can you do’ gesture and Dean’s brow furrows.
“Never mind. Enjoy your workout.” Castiel turns on his heel and heads for the stairs, feeling the piercing state of green eyes all the way across the room. He stops at the water fountain then jogs downstairs, reenergised by his sudden anger at the man for approaching him like that. For behaving the way he did at the party. For it being such a non-event to him that he doesn't even remember it. He probably acts like that to everyone, so much so that it doesn't even register as bad behaviour.
“Cookin’ up a storm as usual.” Gabriel deposits the tray on the counter then slides two cookies into a bag and leans over to hand them to Lexie, either missing or ignoring the expression of irritation on Cas’ face. Cas hates people giving the children sugary food without his permission; Dean has to turn away to hide a slightly guilty smirk. The boy takes the bag with a shy smile and a whispered thank you, and Gabriel ruffles his hair affectionately.
“Billie!” Cas’ voice comes sharply across the kitchen, strung out with exhaustion as he rocks a fractious Lexie. “Put that down, it’s expensive!”
is sexy. “There are cars making their way down here now. You wouldn’t want to get hurt now, would you?”
He doesn't have a choice. He never has a choice, not these days. He closes his eyes, and gives in.
There’s a tense silence for a moment before Gabriel clears his throat.
And, before him, spread out on the table, are two credit card statements totalling thousands of dollars.
‘Every relationship takes work, Sammy. You know that. Hell, you've got a full-time job with Gabe on your hands. Me and Amara, were just fine. Did anyone ever tell you that you worry too much?’
“He’s okay, Dean.”
He’ll probably never see either of them again anyway.
“Dean?” Sam approaches him now, touching his brother on the elbow. “Are you quite alright?”
It’s raining outside. It’s the kind of light drizzle that soaks you to the skin within seconds, and the sky is heavy with the promise of more to come. It’s going to be a long day for anyone who needs to venture outside for any reason at all, especially if umbrellas and raincoats are in short supply. This type of rain sticks to eyelashes and eyebrows, makes hair glitter with the finest of water droplets, and seeps through clothing onto skin and into pockets to leave a wet sheen on anything residing inside. The wind doesn’t help either, and it sends blankets of rain buffeting against windows and doors, making glass panes rattle and creak.
to kick some serious ass if only that ass would stand still long enough for him to do so.
He can hear the church bells from a few streets away signalling the start of Midnight Mass, and Dean knows he probably doesn’t have too long before Castiel returns home to - hopefully - be stunned by what Dean’s done for him. Suddenly it doesn’t seem to matter that they’ve barely exchanged a complete sentence over the last few months. Dean can’t think of a more perfect way for them to be properly introduced: on Christmas morning amid fairy lights and snowdrifts. His romantic streak is really running away with him - what would Sam think if he could see him now?
“You OK?”
“Yes, actually. And he seems… I just don’t want him to be…” Dean flounders, trying to express himself without confirming their suspicions of him being utterly lovesick. “Nobody should be alone on Christmas.”
Her smile is a little too sweet, too saccharine, and as tempting as it is just to invite himself inside and wait for Dean to return, the thought of sitting opposite Amara for any length of time leaves a bad taste in his mouth. He’ll call Dean tonight, arrange to meet, and not take no for an answer.
“Now. Finish your brunch. I need to change the bedsheets and shower. Maybe you can help me out with both those things. If I’m going to get clean, I may as well get dirty first.”
went to church on Christmas Eve so surely this year is no different. The coast looks clear enough.
it, but he chooses it. I’ve learned to respect that choice. He used to be the spirit of Christmas when we were kids, believe me. But times have changed, and Castiel changed with them.”
Then a stream of crying emojis.
“You can tell the other Mr. Winchester to enjoy himself, and that I’ll see him at breakfast tomorrow.” He knows he’s being rude, but can’t seem to help himself. Perhaps he’s not as relaxed as he thought. “See yourself out.”
Thanking her quickly, he pays and backs away, leaving almost ten bucks change for her collection. He didn't want to think about that, not tonight.
“Heya Sammy,” He thunders down the steps from the decking onto the lawn where Sam is tending barbecue, a four-pack of beers in his hand, and claps his brother on the shoulder. “Hope you don’t mind me bringing a plus one.”
And, incidentally, who he isn’t with.
Sleeping the rest of the journey in a drunken stupor is seeming more attractive by the minute.
“None at all!” There's a clatter, the sound of Gabriel messing about with baking trays. “Just a flash of inspiration, Cassie.” Dean smirks in spite of himself; Cas
“When’s the funeral? I haven’t missed it, have I?”
“You've spoken to him a total of, what, three times?” Meg walks back across the room, her blonde curls bouncing with each step, and deposits a hot cup of coffee into Castiel’s hands. She sits down next to him, one leg tucked beneath her, and regards him critically. “And he's been a total ass every time. Why do you care? Whatever's wrong, it probably serves him right.”
“I don’t know, Dean. Do we? Because it certainly seemed like it at your brother’s.” Her words are as sharp as her stare and he sighs, dropping his gaze to the floor. She never makes arguments easy.
But one morning, as he gathers an armful of laundry and heads downstairs to laundry room, the sight of one of the items of clothing he's carrying brings a smile to his lips. One thing has been going right lately, and long may it last. He dumps the pile onto the work surface and busies himself with the washer, his thoughts suddenly interrupted by a knock on the front door upstairs. It's soft, tentative, and he frowns, not recognising it. Perhaps it's a delivery of something he's forgotten he's ordered - books, probably. Since he and Cas fought, he's been burying himself in the latest crime and thriller novels, trying to put it all out of his mind.
“Alright.” Dean had lifted and dropped one shoulder, not really very interested - until he’d noticed Sam turn to walk away and offer his arm to a woman. And not to Jessica, whom he’s engaged to, but to Ruby, who looks as superior and judgemental as ever. She had thrown a saccharine smile in Dean’s direction and walked from the dining room on Sam’s arm, as Dean had stared after them in discomfort. Something didn’t feel right; Ruby was insufferable, they all knew that. But to allow her to worm her way up to Sam like this? What is his brother thinking?
“But you're not by yourself, baby.” Cas brushes dark curls off the boy’s forehead, confused. “Billie is right there.”
“No, I… I let myself in, your door was open.” Dean approaches slowly and squats down to Cas’ level at the entrance to the shower. “Are you okay?”
He tries to hold her gaze but her eyes have darkened with fury and he looks down at the pages instead. Streams of black type, endless lists of stores where she's been shopping, spending dollar after dollar when she knows,
How is she always

has been created especially for them. A woman with a large Afghan hound passes them, flanked by two porters. A barber is offering half-price cuts for men, along with a hot shave to help them look their best for the maiden voyage. Above them, a black motor car is being winched up and swung across onto the deck. An enormous warehouse sits squarely at the other end of the dock, the words
Meg had consoled Gabriel through her own shocked tears, while Dean tried to help the firefighters clear out the remains of the mess and salvage what he could - which wasn't much. They had closed the place down, and six weeks later after all three of them worked twelve hour days alongside a team of workmen, they reopened with a new name, a new logo, and a new layout.
“Oh really?” Cas winds one of Lexie’s dark curls around his finger. “Is he a nice monster, then?”
Gabriel sends Sam a sideways glance and a wink, then they’re laughing and entwining hands across the kitchen table before stumbling to the bedroom together, exchanging sweet, syrup-sticky kisses. They make short work of their clothing and the rest of the morning is spent in languid pleasure, relaxed against the mess of sheets and pillows while the dogs curl up together in the kitchen and wait patiently for their afternoon walk.
But over time, that fun grew stale, the excitement seemed to erode somehow and the light in Dean’s eyes began to go out. He would still have friends over for dinner parties but he was listless, only partaking in light conversation while their new friends drank their fill of his wine and ate his food. It soon became apparent that high society didn’t suit Dean, that it was fun for a while, but that he missed the simplicity of his former existence and the pressure and expectations that their wealth now put on him was crushing his spirit.
Sam had seen the scorn in the petite blonde’s eyes as she’d regarded Amara. He’d definitely side with Gabe on this one.
He tips his head back until it hits the door, appraising their bathroom. He’d proud of this room. He’d done a lot of the work himself, laying the floor tiles and painting the walls. The bath stands in the middle of the room, deep and claw-footed, and the shower is a deep walk-in with a monsoon showerhead. The glass panel is a little loose and he
Then the bathroom as they kiss and embrace under the paltry shower spray and Dean promises to fix it for him one day very soon. Castiel is solid muscle and Dean’s mouth explores every inch of skin he can reach.
As he eats, he rolls his shoulders and sighs in discomfort. Less than thirty seconds later, Dean is behind him and massaging the nape of his neck with gentle, deep strokes of his thumbs. One hand comes up to wind through his hair while the other works its way across his shoulders and down his spine and he groans at how good it feels. How long has it been since Dean has touched him like this? It feels like months but he knows it can’t be more than a few days. He closes his eyes and relaxes into the massage, losing all sense of time for a moment or two. He's
“Still? How much air does he need?” As Jack opens his mouth to respond, Dean waves him away. “Don’t answer that. And don’t wait up - Sam is a big boy, he can get himself into bed on his own.”
to him?”
“Right.” Cas hoists them both up, Lexie on his hip, and walks towards the bedroom with the blanket still wrapped around them. “There's no monster, baby, and I'm going to show you.”
“Mr Nannini will show you to your table, sir. He’s one of our finest waiters.” At this praise, Mr. Nannini lifts his chin in pride. “The kitchen was on the brink of closing but I spoke with the chef and you may have whatever you choose from the menu.”
“My man.”

“Oh, come
As he allows himself to be dragged away into the crowd, he swears the cop turns and shoots him a smile over his shoulder. Their eyes meet for just second. But then someone pushes past him and the moment is lost. But some small part of him knows this isn’t over. That he’ll see that cop again.
“Because he’s a Scrooge, that’s why. Why do you care?” Gabriel dips his French fries into his chocolate milk and munches them happily. “Is his the only house on the street not all decked out or something?”
“It’s nearly six. Wanna get up? I’ll make us an early breakfast. The kids can sleep in.”
“Your name.”
“No, uh.” The voice on the other end is familiar, desperately so, but Dean’s too unfocused to put a name to it. “This is awkward. It's Castiel. Sam and Gabriel came over for dinner last night and he left his cell phone here. I was going to drop it off later and I shouldn't have answered it really, I didn't think…”
“I lost someone,” Castiel says heavily. He doesn’t go back inside, nor does he invite Dean in, but he does wipe a patch of snow away on one of the steps and sits down. After a second’s hesitation, Dean joins him, thinking that Castiel must be freezing cold, barefoot in the snow. But it isn’t the right time to mention it. “Someone I was very close to. They died on Christmas Day, four years ago, and I’ve never really gotten back into the Christmas spirit since. I’ve tried, but joining in group festivities is very difficult for me, so it’s easier to spend the day alone. That way, I don’t disappoint anyone.”
“Hello gang,” Meg is greeting them all with a small, slightly mischievous smile. Her hand is on Castiel’s waist and she’s standing close to him. They’re involved, he surmises, at least on some level. Castiel doesn’t look quite as into it but perhaps it’s the presence of his cousin who is fixing him with a wide grin.
“I have plenty of company.”
“You and Billie OK?”
“Only way to get home.” Dean takes a large sip from his glass, relishing the burn of the alcohol as he swallows. Then, feeling rather rude, he swaps the cigar from his right hand to his left, holding it between finger and thumb while still keeping hold of his glass, and leans forward with his hand outstretched. “Winchester. Dean.”
But he can’t walk away, not now. Not yet. One last-ditch attempt to fix everything should work, right? She was so horrified by the accident that he’s certain they’ve turned a corner now and that nothing similar will ever happen again. They can go back to being the happy couple they once were, surely. Somehow. It must be possible.
Jack had found a way to make himself useful after all.
He eyes the roses with distrust. They didn't come with a tag. They smell nice, the perfume permeating the entire room, but he doesn't know why they're here. He's been wondering about them all morning, concerned that they've been delivered to the wrong person. It’s Valentine’s Day at the weekend, so there’s every chance the roses got lost on their way to the intended recipient. There’s also a chance someone did send them to him, but he can’t think who. Either way, he’s decided to feign ignorance and keep them. They do make the dusty little office smell fresher and they brighten up the place. He’s not about to go walking up and down the street in search of someone who may or may not be expecting them. He’d make himself look completely ridiculous, which is one of his least favourite things to do.
“What are you doing, sweetheart? We don’t need to do this right now.”
hopes that it isn’t just his wishful thinking and that the cop feels it too. The guy has taken a step forward so now there’s barely a foot between them, and Dean can smell his cologne. He has fine lines around his eyes, full lips that look deliciously kissable, and a deep tan that speaks of long hours spent outside. And those
“Yes. But he isn’t - he’s gone to the gym.”
“That would be nice, Dean, thank you.” A fresh, genuine smile washes over Castiel’s face and the knot in Dean’s chest unclenches. “It's just been a long week. I'm looking forward to seeing you properly this evening. And the kids. And Jimmy,” he adds as an afterthought but smiles and runs a hand through his hair, messing it up even further. Dean watches him, considering. Perhaps he's over analyzing the elder set of twins. Maybe Cas isn't being as sharp with his brother as it seems. He sure looks happy to be seeing him tonight. He's certain they go through phases like everyone else, and Cas gets naturally grumpy when he's a bit stressed out. And his editor has been hassling him more than usual lately. Perhaps his twin is just the one on the receiving end of it, and Jimmy is so used to it by now that it doesn't even bother him.
“No. You can't. Billie said if you try and talk to him, he’ll stay forever. He won't leave. You can't, daddy!” His little voice is tear-filled and melancholy. “I'm scared.”
He isn’t exactly a gentleman, he knows this. He’s never pretended to be one. But even so, he’s attracted the attention of a few society ladies and, worse, their mothers who swoon over him and coo at what a wonderful husband he would make for their daughters and what a ‘wonderful match’ it would be if they joined their families. His new money doesn’t seem to be too much of a deterrent; on the contrary, their eyes light up when he tells them vaguely of how he came about his current wealth. The girls simper and the mothers put their hands on his arm and say things like ‘gracious, what an exciting story’ or ‘oh, the grandchildren would love to hear all about this’. It sickens him, really. He’s never considered settling down with anyone, but if he does he likes to think it would be someone like Joanna, the girl back home whom he’s always treated as a sister. She’s strong, brash, brave, and distinctly unladylike and doesn’t care for society’s bells and whistles. Her mother, Ellen, is much of the same and it’s clear to see where Joanna gets her spunky personality from.
“Oh, baby, no.” Cas wraps his arms tightly around his son, his heart aching. “Listen, there's no monster, I promise. It's just a silly story Billie made up to scare you.”
But he didn’t feel like he could after their big, stupid fight. And Dean hates himself for that. His grip on Castiel becomes bruising, and the water that had previously been running hot begins to chill again. His joints are starting to ache and he doesn’t want to think about how sore Castiel must be - nor how likely it is that he’s going to make himself sick sitting here for much longer. All thoughts of sex have gone out the window, and now all he wants to do is wrap the older man in blankets and cuddle him until everything comes right again.
Dean’s mouth is dry. He’s sure he’s never felt attraction this strong before, not in his entire life. It’s as though the air between them is sizzling, crackling with static, and he
But moments after Jack had poured Sam another glass of champagne, staring longingly at the bottle and wishing he was of an age to enjoy it himself, there had been a clamouring outside their cabin followed by a clatter of fists upon the door, and Sam had got to his feet to investigate the source of the racket.
After
Apart from the fact that it isn't, not really. Cas refuses to talk about what upset him on the beach, claiming he hasn't got a clue and he was just swept up in the moment. Dean calls bullshit, and they've argued about it. They'd almost had another argument last night too, when Dean brought up the wedding and Cas had got this almost haunted look in his eyes and suddenly declared he was tired and wanted to go to bed. They had just put the kids down, it was eight PM, and Cas had just retrieved a bottle of wine for them to share out on the deck, so Dean didn't believe his excuse for a second. His temper flared, he had accused Cas of not wanting to get married, and Cas had shut down, telling Dean he was being ridiculous before he'd retired to bed. They hadn't spoken another word to each other all night.
He dresses slowly, yawning as he does, and follows the sounds of his family down the hall into the kitchen and is immediately grabbed around the waist by Dean who kisses his neck and murmurs, “Morning, darlin,’’ into his skin.
“Don't worry. Newbie nerves are completely normal. I'll just get you signed up, show you around, then you can explore the place by yourself. Have you been a member of a gym before?”
It's a short walk to Dean’s from the station, and Sam takes in the scenery as he goes. The houses are all very similar, with white picket fences and French-style bay windows. Some are painted in pastel colours, some plain white. Dean’s house has steps leading up to a dark, baby blue door with a large knocker and he knocks determinedly. He’s going to have it out with his brother this time, no matter what. He’s prepared for Dean not wanting to talk, getting all sarcastic the way he does when he feels cornered. He’s prepared to be told to leave.
Just as his eyes fall closed and his hands lift to wind into Castiel’s hair, the front door bangs open and voices float down the hallway. Castiel stiffens in shock and tries to step away, but Dean grips him tight and, sliding down from the counter, doesn’t allow him to go too far. He slides his hand into Castiel’s just as Sam and Gabriel clatter into the kitchen with Bobby and Mary in tow, and they all stop short at the sight of Dean standing in his kitchen holding hands with someone with a shit-eating grin splitting his face.
“Dean?” He turns to look over his shoulder, eyes scanning the crowd as he searches for his brother. “Dean? Do you see this?”
And the more glasses of mulled wine he polishes off, the more an idea begins to grow in his mind.
Monitors beep, papers rustle, doctors call to each other, and telephones ring. But Dean hears it all as though he’s underwater, miles away, lost in his own bubble and unable to break out of it. Unwilling to even try. Mind set on one thing and one thing only, one room, one bed, one little boy. One man who made the one phone call to him that made his legs give out beneath him back there on the beach.
a good documentary on NatGeo later about bumblebee conservation which he'd like to watch. An early night. An empty bed.
“No problemo, amigo. Dean, get on home. Meg and I can clean up; go enjoy this beautiful day with your family. And take a photo of you and Cas skinny dipping for me.”
if he’d only had a Q. And a Z, T, L and U. He still ain't convinced Sam hasn't made the word up but he can't be bothered to question it. He's hiding it better than Cas, but he's actually kinda nervous about this parents’ night. He's never been to one before and while Cas has bitched and moaned about standardised schooling not being an accurate measurement of a child’s abilities he knows they both want the children to be doing well.
“I should wait…”
Sunday brunch has to be Sam’s favourite part of the week. Gabriel always cooks for them both, makes it special, and they laze around together for most of the morning listening to the radio or going for a walk with the dogs, or lying tangled in the sheets and each other’s arms. They've been together a while now, and the familiarity is soothing and comforting in a way he knows Gabriel never expected it to be.
“Yeah, uh, maybe. That would be pretty cool.”
. People in this world don’t inhabit such hovels as cabins; those are saved for the people in the lower classes. The people he now surrounds himself with require multiple rooms and an array of staff just to take them on a few days’ journey from one side of the world to the other. Although he has to admit, he’d rather sit this one out in luxury than cramped below decks like a sardine in a tin can.
They sit there for a long time, until eventually Amara stirs and pulls him to his feet, walking them both back to bed. She falls asleep immediately, curled in his arms, and he lies awake for the rest of the night watching the red liquid numbers on his alarm clock shift from one to the next.
*strolls in with Starbucks* Two chapters in two days? That is SO unlike me!
There's something up with Cas, he thinks once again, worry sitting low in his gut. Dean has been trying to figure it out for days now, ever since the incident on the beach. He looks exhausted constantly yet seems to be sleeping just fine, and whenever Dean tentatively enquiries as to how he's feeling he's swiftly dismissed or rebuffed. Cas is fine, apparently. Everything is
Castiel lifts his head to gaze at Dean and the cold, distant look in his blue eyes is chilling. Yet in the same movement, he presses closer, starting to shiver now that Dean’s presence has jolted him from whatever trance-like state he’d been in for however-the-fuck-long.
“You alright, kiddo?” Dean kneels in front of him and Billie nods without looking up. “We won't be long. Be good for your uncle.”
“Forever?” Billie pulled back and gazed wide-eyed at his father looking, for a second, more identical to his brother than ever. “I broke it forever?”
There's a letter on the kitchen counter.
Less than a half hour later, Castiel knocks on the front door gingerly, unsure what to do. Dean had sounded so dreadful on the phone that there's a very good chance he could be passed out now and unable to answer his own door. At the same time, maybe Castiel was just imagining things and walking into someone's home unannounced feels like a huge violation of their privacy. But when Dean doesn't answer on his third knock, Castiel is at a loss for anything else to do. He tries the handle and, finding it unlocked, enters with some trepidation.
“But not you? Why?”
“Don't you dare touch me, Dean,” Amara says icily but advances a step towards him as she speaks, her eyes flashing like fire.
They’d fucked passionately over the kitchen counter, then again on the couch. And again in the bedroom, Meg on top, and alcohol giving Castiel a burst of stamina he wasn’t expecting but was certainly grateful for. They hadn’t bothered to clean up, too spent from their activities, and Meg had curled her naked body up against him, laughing as she'd caught her breath. He'd kissed the pads of her fingers and eventually he’d fallen asleep with his hand in her hair and her breath coming in gentle puffs against his chest. She's lovely in every way, and he knows they both wish it could work out as boyfriend and girlfriend. But they drive each other crazy if they even hang out for too long, so a long-term relationship is out of the question. He can't stand how messy she is, and she's easily infuriated by what she casually refers to as the ‘stick up his butt’. Their friendship is ten years strong and they've both seen men and women pass between them as fleeting affairs, half-hearted attempts at serious romance, only for them to come together again and again as lovers and close friends. Castiel sometimes wonders if he'll ever find anyone special, anyone he loves and cherishes more than Meg. Anyone who lights a different kind of fire within him. Anyone who's better in bed than she is, can make him see stars when he comes the way she does. He isn't sure. He hopes so, because he knows for certain that one day she'll find a man of her own, fall in love and settle down, and he’ll be left watching from the sidelines. It's a thought that makes him feel suddenly cold and he rubs his arm absently. Tonight isn't the night to feel lonely, not when she's waiting for him in bed.
“Because Dean isn't Cole.” Sometimes Jimmy really wants to slap his brother. For all his intellect, he can be incredibly obtuse on occasion. “Dean loves you, all of you. It's obvious, from the way he looks at you to your track record. You've been through some shit together already, Cas. That counts for something.”
Until halfway through dinner, when Gabriel asks them if they have any plans for the summer and Amara nods eagerly.
Castiel wakes long into the night, drenched in sweat with a numb left arm and a dull ache between his temples. He blinks up into the darkness, disoriented for a moment until he realises that he isn’t in his own bedroom and the warm body curled up at his side is Meg. He manages to shift them both until he can pull away and sit up, running a hand through his damp hair and leaning over to push the window open. Meg always keeps the heat on too high, and even though the sheets have been kicked to the bottom of the bed and they’re both lying entirely nude, Castiel is far too hot. It makes him feel slightly sick and his throat feels clogged, sticky. His tongue is stuck to the roof of his mouth from dehydration.
Billie is sprawled out in his own bed, his toy elephant in one hand being dangled off the edge, and he's breathing deep and slow, snoring a little on the exhale. Cas deposits his other child on the bed and wraps him up in the blanket while he kneels down, silently lamenting his knees not being what they used to be. Lexie clings with his little fingers tight around Cas’ arm, and he stares with wide eyes as Cas lifts the covers and reaches under the bed with his free hand finding, as he expected, only dust bunnies and toys.
, I didn’t realise there was a genuine reason you didn’t celebrate. Fuck. I’m sorry.”
“Don’t worry about it.” She produces a brown paper bag from her purse and drops it onto his desk. “Here. You have to eat, keep up your strength. You’re a growing boy.”
“Gabe and Sam are having a barbecue tomorrow. I'll be going for dinner.” He's about to check if Amara minds spending the evening by herself but she squeezes his hand and smiles widely.
“You know it's July out there, right?” Cas approaches the counter and Dean leans over to give him a peck on the lips. “And over a hundred degrees?”
It’s a long while before either of them can catch their breath enough to speak, and even then it seems like the wrong thing to do. The silence that has settled upon them is thick, loaded, and could go in any direction, intimacy or anger or more pain, and Dean is worried that Castiel will spiral off to the deep end again, and he won’t know what to do. But soon enough, Cas is singing against his skin and pressing close, all warm embraces and gentle lips.
Amara steps in close to him, a fire in her eyes like he's never seen before, her face twisted in cruel fury. She fists her hands in his t-shirt and he reaches up to grip her wrists, drag her off him. But before he can, she pushes him backwards. Hard.
“Of course, baby.” Dean kisses him, tasting the salt of Cas’ silent tears once more. “I’ll be there, right by your side. You can count on that.”
“Fuck. I don’t…” He swallows a mouthful of bile. “Fuck.”
And it's true: the account is in joint names. It ties him to the wildly increasing debt and he fights back a wave of panic at how it could affect the garage if it can't be paid off. Which, right now, it can't be.
It's pathetic, Dean. You need to get a real job, learn to take care of me properly.
“I'm sorry, daddy,” Billie had snuffled into Cas’ neck. “I can fix it.”
It's very, very late when they finally stumble into the house and collapse into bed, too tired to rinse off the sand and the evidence of their activities down on the beach before it all went sideways. The sheets will wash. Cas falls into a restless sleep on Dean’s chest, huddling close, and Dean lies awake until sunrise, a nauseating concern taking root in his gut and the sand beneath his legs chafing his skin. The pleasant, happy, everything-is-right-with-the-world feeling is long gone, the glow replaced with a cold anxiety gnawing away at his insides.
“And you decided to tell me this now? No, wait, not now. In front of your brother. Do you have any idea how that felt? Was it your intention to humiliate me? Because that’s what happened!”
Another night, another nightmare. Three o’clock the next morning sees Cas wide awake and trembling all over again, sipping tea and pinching the bridge of his nose to ward off a headache. Dean sleeps on in their bedroom, the kids are peaceful in dreamland, and this time no comforting text messages have arrived from his brother. It's just Cas, alone, and he curls up on the couch to watch the ocean again, lost in thought, just like last night. And the night before. And the night before that.
“What is it, Winchester? Afraid of getting shot down?” Jo is smirking at him, arms folded across her chest and eyes sparkling with mirth. She’s in a white shift dress with rainbow tassels at the hem, and her eyes are heavily made up. Her long blonde hair cascades in ringlets and she tosses it back confidently, pushing between the pair of them and throwing a ‘Come on, boys!’ over her shoulder as she goes.
Pulling out a chair at the table, Sam sits down and stretches his long legs out in front of him. This could be a long conversation and not one he particularly wants to have in spite of the fact that he’s spent the entire week wondering exactly the same thing. He's surprised they've got to the weekend without either of them bringing it up. Gabriel plates up crispy waffles, douses them in whipped cream and maple syrup, tops with strawberries soaked in balsamic vinegar, and deposits his work of art in front of Sam.
Tomorrow is Christmas Day and Dean will be waking up with his brother, opening their gifts, then welcoming their friends for dinner and drinking long into the night. And, across the street, he can just imagine Castiel’s house looking cold and sad, and it causes a pang of sorrow to pulse in his chest.
“Don’t you think she can be a bit,” Gabriel swirls his coffee, eyes upcast to the ceiling in search of what Sam is certain will be a more diplomatic word than the one he initially thought of. “Domineering. Especially when it comes to Dean.”
Fuck, he shouldn't be asking that.
He lies back, holding the note to his chest, a million thoughts spiralling through his mind as he tries to imagine where Dean is right now. Wherever that is, Castiel just hopes he's safe.
“You're it for me, Sammy.” He'd said, eyes dark and intense, looking more serious than Sam had ever seen him. “I want it all with you. The nice house, the picket fence, the dog, the damn kids if that's what you want. Whatever you want. But I just want you.” Then he's squeezed his hand and given him an impish grin. “You'd better want me in return or I'll push you off the pier.”
“So soon?” Crowley says, with a twinkle of mirth in his eye. “Am I boring you?”
So that's exactly what they do. The boys are in their footie pyjamas, Dean in sweats, and Cas in his plaid PJ pants and a sweater, and they pile onto the bed with Cas in the middle and wriggle about until they're all comfortable. There's an elbow digging into Cas’ ribs, Billie is a dead weight on top of him, Dean’s leg is too heavy draped over his thigh, but somehow he feels his muscles unwind as he closes his eyes and sighs deeply.
“Wound up? Wound
Then, just as he takes a step backwards in fright, suddenly realising all at once that he’s been caught, the front door opens and Castiel stands there, gaping out into the snow at Dean in his work boots and pajama pants. Bright blue eyes travel from Dean’s face to the Christmas lights and the decorations, and before Dean can even open his mouth to try and formulate an apology or an explanation his foot slips on the top step and he falls backwards, arms windmilling wildly, until he lands gracelessly in the flurry of snow pushed to the edge of the path. In the distance, the church bells begin to chime again and all Dean can say, as he hauls himself into a sitting position in the wet snow, is: “I thought you were at church.”
Last year, Castiel had Dean help him redesign his bathroom. It’s all dark tile with pale grouting, wooden flooring, claw-footed tub and walk-in shower. It’s spacious and relaxing and Dean loved helping him with the project, coordinating the contractors and rolling his sleeves up to step in when he thought he could do something better himself. He and Cas have shared many a happy memory in her, in the shower and in the bathtub together - and one not-so-successful time when Cas had bent him over the sink and taken him hard from behind while Dean’s sweaty palms slipped on the ceramic and he fell forward and split his lip open on the tap. But now, all the good memories freeze and shatter before his eyes as the scene in the bathroom before him reeks of nothing but pain and sadness.
Standing in the hallway beside the table where Dean has left his cell, she drops it onto the tiled floor where the screen shatters instantly and the phone goes dark. Then, for good measure, she grinds the spiky heel of her shoe into the broken pieces.
“Huh?” The guy’s brow furrows a little more and Castiel takes a moment to appraise him, head to foot. Grey v-necked t-shirt, sweaty, charcoal sweatpants, also sweaty, beaten up sneakers that were probably expensive once. Towel around his neck. Objectively fit, with a fine layer of muscle covering his body and just a little softness at his stomach and hips. Not dissimilar to Castiel himself, and the thought makes him feel a little better. Then worse as he realises he's staring.
Dean looks up at the sound of the door opening. His eyes are bloodshot and there's a nasty cut bisecting his bottom lip, and a bruise blossoming below his left eye. He blinks dazedly, then manages something akin to a smile.
“I'm great,” he replies, almost slurring his words as a relaxed smile spreads across his face. “Nearly asleep.”
Updates might be a little slower over the next few weeks because I fly to Thailand today for honeymoon. But since I wrote the majority of Rise and Shine while I was in Rome, you never know! ♥
we can go away. You’re worrying too much.”
Ruby... Ruby is a different matter. Sam can’t help but think that he would rather like it if she missed the boat entirely. It would make things simpler, that's for sure. But equally, there's a thrill in his chest at the thought of seeing her.

“Good. He didn't mean it, you know. It was an accident-”
everything OK? His thumb lingers over his phone’s keypad as he hesitates, unsure how to respond. He's fine, generally speaking. But sometimes…
Across the changing rooms, in a corner, the guy is punching in his locker code and rifling through his things, unaware of Castiel’s eyes on him. He's shirtless now, the damp t-shirt in a puddle at his feet, and Castiel has a clear view of his back and side. He can't help but stare. The guy has deep scratches down his left side in two patches, red streaks running below his ribs then again just above his waistband, disappearing below his clothing. Castiel knows those scratches. He's
“And you saw fit to open my mail, did you?” Her sharp voice draws him back to the present. “You really don't trust me at all, do you?”
The house is quiet and still, and Castiel immediately feels guilty just being there. He calls Dean’s name quietly, closing the door behind him, but gets no reply. The living room is devoid of life, as is the kitchen. He tries one bedroom, which looks to be a guest room, then another. Then the bedroom that must be the master, with the door to the en suite open.
- and it doesn’t take her more than a few seconds to decide what to do.
He knows about the five stages of grief. But he didn’t think it would feel quite like this. Denial is meant to be the first stage, and he didn’t expect it to feel so… nothingy. He doesn’t feel in denial, he just feels numb. Empty. Like if he were hooked up to a heart monitor he would just flatline yet still be sitting there staring at them. There’s a low ache beneath his ribs and in his throat, and his eyes burn from too much silent crying. He’s tired and leans his temple against the tiles. He’s curled in the corner and a nap might help his state of mind. His eyes close and he dozes for a while, in and out of sleep, and he doesn’t hear the door open and close downstairs, nor footsteps making their slow, deliberate way up the stairs.
“Yeah. Okay. I won’t sleep anymore now anyway.” Dean sits up and runs a hand across his face. “You can take first shower.”
The drive to the school is tense and silent, Cas focused on the road with his jaw clenched and Dean playing Words With Friends against Sam on his phone - and getting his ass kicked. He could have put down
‘You might be a psychologist, Cas!’ Dean had raved at him, gesturing wildly and making Castiel flinch back away from his ire. ‘But you ain’t
“No, don't. Please, don't get up yet. I want…” Cas’ blue eyes sparkle in the starlight, tears clinging to his lashes. “I want you to stay.”
“Why doesn’t Castiel decorate?” He asks suddenly, and Gabriel and Sam break off from their mooning at each other to glare at him in irritation.
He takes a long time in the shower, enjoying the solitude. He tips his head back, lets the water stream down over his face and into his mouth. It's a little too hot, close to scalding, but he finds he needs it. It soothes his sore back, makes the cuts smart then ease into a dull, almost pleasant ache. It helps the knot beneath his ribs, ever-present and for no real reason, loosen. He washes himself slowly, their jojoba oil body wash feeling good as he soaps up his skin. When he finally shuts off the water, it's past three in the morning and he's exhausted. Eyes heavy with sleep and alcohol, he dries off and walks nude into the bedroom, pulling a clean pair of boxer-briefs from the drawer and climbing into bed next to Amara. He only stumbles a little now. There's a perspiring glass of water on the nightstand and two aspirin which he swallows down gratefully, thankful for her consideration. She's already asleep, her hair tied in a knot on the top of her head, and she turns to snuggle into his side. The blankets feel too heavy, suffocating, but he pulls them up to his chin anyhow and turns his head to look across the room, out of the window. The moon hangs low in the sky and he watches as a cloud makes its slow path across it, fluffy and gray.
He walks along the deck, finding himself to be on the roof of the smoking room judging by the voices and laughter that drift up to meet him, smoking slowly and looking up at the starlit sky. He can hear the crashing of the waves below him as the
“Mr. Winchester!” The disembodied voice of Jack comes brightly from somewhere to his left, and Dean jumps so much that he drops the key and grumbles in irritation as he stoops to pick it up. Had the boy been lying in wait for him or something? “Did you have a nice dinner?”
There’s a crowd of people around Lexie’s bed and he can’t see the boy properly. He recognises the back of Jimmy’s head, Dr. Bradbury’s bouncing curls, Eve’s long hair hanging in a sheet down her back, Sam standing a head and shoulders above everyone else, Jess with a hand covering her mouth. And, of course, Cas. Cas leaning over the bed, his face in shadow, his voice low as he murmurs something to his son. Dean pauses in the doorway, discomfited and confused as to why they’re all there before him, why they all know before he does. Then Sam and Eve step apart and Dean has a full view of the bed and a weak, horrified cry leaves his lips.
Sam will just have to wait for that call.
He climbs into his car, a faithful Continental that Meg always complains isn't classy enough for her, and starts the engine. The day is warm, springtime come early, and he rolls the window down. There's a car parked a little too close to him on his passenger side and it takes him a few manoeuvres before he's free of the space. The car is oversized, a black muscle car with silver mirrors that shine in the sunlight, and Castiel rolls his eyes at it as he drives away. Whoever drives that thing is probably trying to overcompensate for something. Smirking a little at his childish thoughts, he heads for home and doesn't pay the gym, the pretty girl at the welcome desk, or the asshole guy at the weights machine a second thought.
“Yeah. Me too.” Sam closes his eyes, breathing in the scent of Gabe’s caramel-macadamia body wash and coconut shampoo. Guy always smells like a candy shop, it's one of the many, many reasons Sam loves him so deeply. One of the dogs winds it's way around their legs, whining for treats, and he leans down to scratch it behind the ears. “I'll talk to him. You talk to Cas?”
And he makes his way into the function room towards their seats at the front, taking another glass of champagne from the nearby waiter, already feeling the buzz of alcohol coursing through his veins. He can feel Sam’s gaze tracking him all the way to their table.
“His white count is up,” Dr. Bradbury had said, her eyes wide and a tentative smile touching his lips. “And his temperature is down half a degree. It’s… unbelievable progress, but progress nonetheless. We’ll continue to monitor him every hour.”
Hell, he’s even contemplating breaking every speed limit in town in the hope of summoning him. When he turns back again to search for the cop, he’s gone, and the crowd is thickening again as the evening party-goers begin to filter out into the streets.
“Oh, might I?” Dean raises an eyebrow at him. “How kind. And do come in, please.”
There are no lights on in the house and the radiators are cold to the touch. When he strains his ears, the sound of rushing water from upstairs is faintly audible and he ascends the stairs slowly, his thoughts turning slowly to how he could surprise Castiel and make it up to him using his most valuable asset: his mouth. He imagines himself on his knees in the shower at Castiel’s feet and his cock twitches between his thighs.
Dean still has to pinch himself from time to time to make sure he isn't dreaming. That he is a part of this family, that the two boys call him daddy, and that this is all real. It has been a somewhat rocky road getting here, but finally it seems like everything is really falling into place. He's got his job, his husband-to-be, his children, and his brother back in his life plus a brand new niece. Sure there are a few kinks to be worked out, a few bridges to build, but nothing happens overnight, and in general, he's pretty thrilled with how everything is going. He rests on his elbows and peers down at Lexie who smiles at him and leans forward. Cas hoists the boy up under his arms and sits him on the countertop; Lexie immediately twists around and wraps an arm around Dean’s neck.
It breaks his heart that she does.
, you may already know why this chapter took so long to post. But long story short, I had a traumatic miscarriage at 10 weeks pregnant less than a month ago and I'm still not recovered emotionally. I had planned to post this chapter on the day of my 12-week scan and announce the good news to you all, but obviously that didn't come to pass so I found it a bit hard to get this all completed and to let go of the twins. To everyone who has offered support, thank you. It means more than you'll ever know.
“Castiel.” Meg leans forward and rests her elbows on his desk, linking her fingers together. Her nails are painted black, the varnish a few days old and chipped at the tips. “I don't need an excuse to watch you get hot and sweaty. I have plenty of lingerie that has the same effect.”
“Dean, what the-”
Those were simpler times. Sad times, of course. Especially towards the end. But he has some good memories of his childhood, most of them revolving around his brother and his father, and the occasional trip they took together hunting or fishing or hiking. Spending time together, just family. Nothing like the life he lives today. He feels caught, trapped like a fly in a web, and as though something dark and ominous is rising up behind him, poised to strike at any given moment.
And yet, the spirit of Christmas is evading Dean. And it’s entirely because, across the street, Castiel’s house sits in darkness apart from one lonely light on in the kitchen. No lights, no tinsel, no tree, nothing. Possibly no gifts, either, and that makes Dean unbearably sad. He remembers as a child, having nothing to give Sam so going out and stealing wrapped gifts just so his kid brother had something to open on Christmas day. They had no tree, and they made do with the crappy motel room TV with blurry, crackly Christmas movies on. But they had each other. Castiel, it seems, has nobody.
“What’s wrong?” He persists when no response is forthcoming down the line.
me. Enjoy.” He pulls his own chair out with a screech that makes Sam’s ears ache, and almost swoons as he pops one of his own strawberries into his mouth. “Not to toot my own horn, but I am extremely talented.” He pushes a mug of coffee across to Sam who takes it gratefully. He’s going to need his energy for this. “So, about this brother of yours.”
“Talking about my dear cousin again, Dean? Or should I say,
“Come home,” Amara whimpers down the line and Dean closes his eyes. He doesn't want to, not right now. “Please. Please, Dean. We can sort this out. I'm sorry, I'm so fucking sorry. Please don't leave me.
No response. Castiel just gazes straight ahead, blue eyes glassy and his lips bitten and raw and worry spears at Dean in low pulses. He reaches in and brushes Castiel’s hair aside, water slowly soaking his hand and arm. It’s freezing - how is Cas even sitting in it? And how long has he been like this?
Castiel, the weird, nerdy little dude who came to Dean’s aid when he needed it the most. Who didn't sugar-coat his words. Who all but confirmed Dean’s months-long suspicions that his relationship is broken in ways he can never repair, a teacup shattered on the ground that can never come back together again. Castiel, who made him tea and gave him his bed to sleep in. He closes his eyes, trying to engage his brain which feels thick and fluffy like candyfloss. The phone is still pressed to his ear and he lowers the volume even more, not wanting to wake his host.
That's exactly how he feels. He nods, fighting an impending headache as Billie slides down from his seat and makes his way over to him.
They pass a family with what could be classed as an obscene amount of luggage needing three cars to transport it, the man in a sharp black suit and a young woman with red curls tucked neatly beneath a wide-brimmed hat.
“Does something about me suggest that’s what I might be looking for?” His tone is teasing and Dean relaxes infinitely, leaning an arm against the railings and moving a little closer to the cop.
“Alright.” Castiel stands, draws Dean to his feet with both hands and presses a kiss to his mouth. “Unless…”
“Dean, if you need Gabe and I to loan you some money then you know we will. All you have to do is ask.”
“A valet?” Dean scoffs, finishing his Scotch in one mouthful. “No, I didn’t bring a valet. I’m capable of fastening my own pants, but thank you for the offer.”
Lexie casts a dismissive look towards his brother then tugs at Cas again. “Stay.”
A bouquet of flowers sits proudly on Castiel’s desk.
Amara succeeds where Castiel didn't. They end up in the emergency room, where she sits holding his warm hand in her cold one, her hair a mess and her eyes and nose Rudolph-red. The nurses are brisk but friendly, and he's triaged pretty quickly. Only when he's settled in a bed, shirtless and staring blankly ahead of him, does the reality of where he is sink in.
Dean's avoiding him. Dean’s been avoiding him all week. He's called, he's sent texts, he even dropped by the other night but found their house dark, still, and empty. He'd had to temper down a flash of alarm then, his mind beginning to race with unsavoury possibilities of Dean injured somewhere, but Gabe had later seen a photo Amara had uploaded of herself at a swish restaurant downtown, hand on hip and glass of wine in hand, with Dean tagged in the status. He'd felt a burst of irrational anger and jealousy at the sight of it, anger that Dean had been so staunchly ignoring him yet had the time to take Amara out, and jealousy over the fact that this woman seems to be drawing his brother further and further away from him as each day goes by.
He doesn't push her away and she reclines in her chair, hands now folded on her stomach, watching him.
“No, Dean. Please don’t be upset. Nobody has ever…” Castiel gestures to the decorations. “It’s so thoughtful. Thank you.”
“Thank you.” Jack, missing the sarcasm in Dean’s tone, closes the door behind him. “Shall we go? Oh.” He stops short, taking in Dean’s appearance. “Do you need help changing? I know you didn’t bring a valet, so...”
“The nightmare? Again?”
He unties his tie and hangs it in the closet. His jacket next, then he unbuttons his shirt slowly, absently. He's thinking back over their night. Sam and Gabriel had looked so darn happy together that it made his heart melt for his little brother. Sam had had a rocky few years at college before meeting Gabriel, falling in with a bad crowd and taking too many drugs, but now he's straightened his life out - Dean smirks at his own pun - and settled down with Gabriel, plus he has a thriving career as a human rights lawyer to boot. Life is good for the youngest Winchester and Dean is eternally grateful. John Winchester had always wanted the best for his kids, and Dean is sure his father is smiling down upon Sam right now. On himself, too.
“Hello! Earth to Dean!” Sam is snapping his fingers in front of Dean’s face and he blinks, thrown from his little fantasy with a start, and glowers at his younger brother. “Man, you
“You guys seem really settled here.” He reaches down to scratch one of the dogs behind the ears as it runs up to him and noses up his legs, scenting him out until it realises who he is and gives a joyful bark. It’s Banjo, ginger and hairy and he sheds all over the soft furnishings, but Sam has nothing but love for the mutt.
And after a moment’s hesitation, other glasses are raised both around their table and at neighbouring tables as a multitude of passengers join in, and his words echo around the room.
seems to dwarf the ship Sam had once been in such awe of. Freshly painted, shining in the morning light, the funnels gleaming as the sun catches them, she stands proudly above them all and Sam feels a low thrill of excitement at what lies before them. Being on the maiden voyage of the grandest, most luxurious ship in the world is something he never would have imagined in his wildest dreams, let alone holding a First Class ticket.
His gaze travels down to his own arm as the phone rings and rings, propped between his cheek and his shoulder. He’s bleeding from multiple cuts, some that look fairly deep, and when he rubs his knuckles across his cheek they come away stained with half-dried blood. What have they done? How has it gotten to this point, where one of them is actually hurt and bleeding? Where did things go so damn wrong?
Cas actually looks startled to be asked then nods ruefully. “Sure. Just tired. Kids are running me ragged today and my editor is badgering me for a revised draft. Everything's fine.”
All this time
“That sucks,” she links her arm with his. “What’s up with Dean? He’s going to put his neck out if he carries on like that.”
“Cas, I’m so sorry.” He leans in and pulls Castiel close to him, burying his face in his wet hair and pressing kisses wherever he can. “I’m so fucking sorry. Whatever it is, I’m sorry. And for all the shit I said to you, Jesus, you didn’t deserve any of it.”
“How's Lexie?” Jimmy asks, the first words to leave his lips as he pulls open the front door.
, Dean. Not some crappy job that barely pays the bills.”
“Who was that?” He asks distractedly as she makes her way out onto the deck to watch him. He’s in faded jeans and a plaid shirt open over a black t-shirt, sleeves rolled up to expose his forearms. He really
“What was that for?” With one arm still around Dean’s neck, he touches a fingertip to his own lips. This close, Dean’s freckles seem magnified and his pleased smile is almost dazzling.
So he works out. As best he can. Five minutes on the treadmill, ten on the cross trainer. Twelve doing stretches that don't feel like they're stretching anything at all beyond the seams of his clothing. Lifts some weights, then lifts some lighter ones when his shoulder threatens him with popping out of its socket. Considers a personal trainer at some point in the future then reconsiders it when he notices how preppy and hyperactive they all are. He doesn't need that kind of energy in his life. His life is fine without someone jumping into his personal space and talking, at length, about the state of his abs.
Are they still friends? He hasn’t a clue. Does one night, one incident, make them friendly? They’d disliked each other intensely before this yet it seems incredibly difficult to go back to finding the guy irritating and smug. Not now that they’ve spent time together, in an intimate sort of way, and both divulged fairly personal secrets. Dean about having issues in his relationship, and Castiel about his brother’s tragic death. Would he like to be friends? He has a clue about that. He thinks he would. His friends are thin on the ground these days, at least when it comes to ones he can truly confide in. He would quite like someone he could talk to.
more with.
He sighs, runs a hand through his hair to push it back from his face, and decides to bite the bullet. If they can get whatever it is talked about and out of the way, they can enjoy the rest of their day together. “What’s on your mind, Gabe?”
in the light from the crackling fire. His living room is his favourite room of the house. He’s renovated most of the place himself, but the living area is spacious, warm, with lots of fabrics and textures and a log fire that crackles merrily throughout the winter.
“Cas…” Worry chokes him like a noose. He moves to sit up, to climb off Cas and find their wet clothes, but suddenly the warm arms return to hold him around the waist and keep him in place.
They’d had some rough times growing up. Nights spent alone in motel rooms while their dad worked long shifts, evenings with nothing to eat but Spaghetti-Os or Captain Crunch, Christmas mornings with no presents to open. But through all of the uncertainty of their childhoods, Dean had been the one constant in Sam’s life. So in later life, when Dean was all pent-up rage and self-hatred and throwing empty beer bottles at the walls or calling for bail money
“No,” he says tightly, swiping his towel up from the floor and slinging it over his shoulder. “I'm not. It's all yours.”
“Oh yeah, it’s been a blast.” Words, Winchester, come on. “Have you had fun?”
! Daddy says so, too.”
But it’s no use. Castiel, wild with grief, grabs at the nearest thing to him - a vase of fake flowers on the bedside table - and launches them at Dean with hate and fury in his eyes, tears on his cheeks and a wild scream of hatred leaving his lips. Dean braces himself for the impact…
Sighing at his own confusion, he scoops his phone up and reads the message through narrowed, squinting eyes, the screen too bright in the dim room.
So he winds up in the one place he hates the most and has to grit his teeth throughout the entire experience. He leaves with every cut and graze cleaned thoroughly and a few stitches to the one in his arm, stitches that the doctor tells him will dissolve naturally. He barely says a word. All he could think was that Castiel’s hands had felt so much more comforting when they wiped the blood from his skin and pulled shards of broken glass from his flesh with tweezers. With Castiel, it almost hadn't hurt. The doctor was proficient, quick, and British, and there was a look in his blue eyes and a tone to his voice that made Dean feel like they knew each other. But he lay silently on the bed as instructed, gazing at a point in the distance while Amara held his hand, and the doctor left without much further ado.
Amara pushes the blankets back off them both and, in one swift movement, she kneels up and straddles Dean’s face, facing down the length of his body. She smells warm and musky and he tries to regulate his breathing and push down a beat of panic. He doesn't want to do this. He wants to turn over and go to sleep. He doesn't want to touch her, doesn't want her touching him. The memory of her slap is still too raw, the words thrown at him are still circling his mind. He wants to be still and quiet and alone. Untouched. But she's pushing down his boxers and his hands automatically come to her hips to steady her when she almost overbalances. He can't bring himself to put his mouth on her and she seems to know it.
What accident? Something at work? A car crash? No, that can't be it because Sam would have been called as Dean’s emergency contact if he'd ended up in the hospital. So something bad, bad enough to send him from his home and into the welcoming arms of a virtual stranger, but not bad enough for medical attention. He sips his coffee, relishing the burn as it all but scalds his throat. He feels like he's failing Dean. The red flags are all there, signifying that his relationship with Amara is growing increasingly wayward, yet whenever Sam tries to get him to talk openly about it his brother either shuts down or brushes it all off with a laugh.
No doubt he's pointing to one or both of the boys, dazzled by the sugar and the lights, and Dean tugs a clean t-shirt over his head with a grin. As weird and kooky as his boss is, he can't deny that Gabriel has some sort of charm about him. It's a shame Cas doesn't quite see it that way.
He deserves this, he tries to reason with himself as he slips past a small group of elderly men who visibly look him up and down as he does. He grew up dirt poor, he worked his fingers to the bone from before he was even in his teens - he deserves to take it easy for a while. To have a few things handed to him, to have people fetch and carry and do whatever he asks them to.
Merry Christmas to you, if you celebrate, and happy holidays. Here's to 2019 ♥
He's considered selling the house and moving away back to their hometown, but it feels like a knee-jerk reaction to something that can hopefully - possibly - be remedied. If he does that, ups and leaves at the first sign of trouble with his brother, it will likely be the final nail in the coffin of their relationship. And becoming estranged from Cas - never seeing Dean or the children again - doesn't bear thinking about.
There were now little chairs on the street outside with circular tables for customers to sit and drink their espressos at. They serve ice cream and gelato. They've launched, after Cas’ shy suggestion at dinner with Gabriel and his wife Kali one night, a gluten-free and dairy-free range of cookies and pastries. Dean had poked warily at them before trying one and still won't admit to Cas that they taste just as good as the sugar and cream laden delicacies he tends to go for. They'd taken advantage of the damage from the fire to extend the cafe and fit a new white marble countertop flanked by glass cabinets, and have lined the walls with shelves to display Gabriel’s handiwork. Dean himself is slowly learning to bake and enjoys it. His signature is chocolate and cinnamon croissants, and they always sell out every day.
He hopes that will be enough to satisfy Gabriel, but the sardonic look he receives in return suggests otherwise. He should have known his astute partner would never be so easily dissuaded from a discussion such as this.
I have a couple of conflicting sources that say Molly Brown wasn't given the nickname Molly until later in life, but for the purposes of this fic, I'm calling her Molly. It suits her better than Margaret :)
“Mr. Winchester, how nice to see you.” The restaurant manager welcomes Dean with a smile, one that turns from surprise into cool professionalism in the space between one blink and the next. His hair is slicked back with pomade and his glasses are small and circular, giving him the appearance of some sort of twitchy rodent. “My sincere apologies, I was informed by your brother that you weren’t dining with us tonight. I’ll have the waiters set you a place at the table.”
. What could go wrong? He has the most fucking insanely awesome house in the world, the most handsome fiancé he could want, and a job he's excelling at. Life is damn good. It's especially damn good tonight because the twins are with Jimmy in their shiny new bedroom in Jimmy’s shiny new house, which means Cas and Dean have had a real, official date night with the house all to themselves. They've cooked dinner together, laughed and grinned their way through games of Scrabble and Jenga, and now they're relaxing in the evening starlight and Dean thinks life doesn't get much better than this.
“Nice suit, Cassie. Did you dig it out of dad’s closet for the special occasion?”
It breaks his heart a little to leave the kids, as it always does, and he fervently hopes the evening will be over soon. Dean casts a look back over his shoulder at the boys as him and Cas climb into Cas’ car to head to the school. Lexie is in the window, waving to them with a vague, dreamy expression on his pale face. Jimmy stands in the doorway holding Billie by the hand and the look on the little boy’s face makes Dean’s heart clench. Billie looks so sad, like he's been told Santa isn't real or something. He's looking down at his feet and his eyes are huge and melancholy. Dean decides to speak to Cas later, to tell him to forgive his son, to remind him that accidents happen. The weird thing is that Cas knows that, and he normally would have forgiven his kid easily by now. Something is eating at him, something he's keeping hidden, and Dean is determined to find out what.
One day. He’s sure that one day he’ll find his happiness.
If there's something more sinister going on than he's ever considered.
Castiel smiles sadly at him, but doesn’t balk at the question. “My partner. His name was Inias. He died in a car crash in the early hours of Christmas Day, driving over to see me. I’ve never truly forgiven myself.”
“Hey, do we know each other?”
On the end of the line, he hears the tinkle of what could be cutlery. Or keys. And Castiel’s voice comes through the phone again.
Cas seems chill tonight too, and that's another thing that Dean counts as a victory. Cas has been tense lately, distracted, tired, but tonight he seems like a weight has lifted. Perhaps that's what's been bugging him, Dean muses as he runs his fingers through Cas’ hair, smiling as Cas presses into the touch. They've had no them time, no time together as a couple, and this evening has been pure bliss. Burgers, beer, games, cuddling. Dean Winchester is officially a cuddler, and he doesn't give a shit. It feels damn good to cuddle with Cas.
On reflection, it seems foolish to miss a meal. Is it his imagination, or do his pants already feel a little loose? Damn European food. He would love to sit down to a burger with Ellen right about now.
They’ve barely spent two days in England, and he wishes for more time. He’s been tempted to delay their journey home, to sell the tickets and buy them onto the next crossing, but the lure of the largest and most luxurious cruise liner the world has ever seen is too much. That and the fact that they’re tipped to cross the Atlantic in record time, and he knows he has to be on board. What a story to tell back home! They have plenty of tales to tell their friends and family already, friends and family who are no doubt already intrigued after they hot-tailed it off to Europe at a moment’s notice, but this will be something else.
“So you act like a total ass, then expect me not to care?” She sneers at him and his heart pounds. An unpleasant sensation is opening up beneath his ribs, anxiety and fear all combined into one. He tries to get away from her again and turns to walk into the bathroom. Almost instantly, the room feels too small, the walls too close, and the ceiling too low. She’s right fucking there again, and he's suddenly hot all over, so he steps back to get some space, brought to an immediate halt by the shower screen. “I don’t think so. This would never have happened if you hadn't opened my mail in the first place.”
He’s waiting on Castiel’s front step now, waiting for him to answer the door, and it feels like he’s been waiting an age.
“I do, Dean.” Sam’s arm is suddenly on his forearm, stopping him in his tracks. His brother’s hazel eyes are dark with concern, his brow furrowed. It makes him look older, somehow. “We all know what she's like. But what I don't know is why you're still together. Even Gabe can't stand her, and he likes everyone.”
“You okay?” Dean brushes Castiel’s hair back and kisses the end of his nose. Cas can only nod, still trembling, still sticky with come and sweat, and Dean helps him back into his clothing before adjusting his own. They’ll need to shower, but it can wait. Everything can wait. “I missed you, man. So damn much.”
“Hey, Cas.”
That's a wrap, folks! But I have the next part of this series in the works, so we'll see our boys again very soon. I want to say a huge thank you to my beta,
“It’s not you, I hope you know that. I… I had a phone call after you left, and…”
She had led him to their room, sat him down on the bed, and tried to hold back her tears as she looked him over. Then, with a tone that implied there was no room for argument, she told him where they were going and he complied without a word.
There's something about the man that Castiel just can't put out of his mind. Something in his eyes when he spoke of Amara. A tension in his shoulders. The way his gaze flicked away from Castiel, the way his embarrassment was almost carved into his skin.
“How long is your lunch hour?” Her voice has changed tone now, dropped to something low and husky and it
tight.” Dean says, back-pedalling frantically. “But the budget just doesn’t stretch to overseas trip right now. Does it?”
He doesn’t reply, doesn’t argue or ask for help. She doesn’t cook, not unless Dean is out and she has no other option. She’d rather order from the sushi place in town than have to make her own meal and deal with the cleanup after. But Dean, sweet Dean who would do anything for her, will cook and clean up and have it all done so she doesn’t have to worry about a thing.
“No sugar until after dinner, kiddo. You know the rules.” Dean wipes his brow with the hand that isn't holding onto Lexie. The shop is swelteringly hot in spite of the air conditioning and he vehemently wishes he could leave and go home with Cas and the twins to enjoy the sea air.
“Yes?”
to be left out of those) or that they’ve met up with Charlie and Jo, or Benny and Gabriel before he goes off to have a little fun on his own, coming back with lipstick kisses on his skin and smelling of six different brands of cologne, a light-up-the-world grin on his face and eyes sparkling like jewels. He always looks so happy at Pride, so at home and at peace with himself, and that’s the sole reason Sam goes along with him. Sure it’s fun, and it’s always good to show his support to the local LGBT community, but at the end of the day all Sam cares about in this scenario is Dean’s happiness. And seeing it makes him happy by proxy.
, would it? Sometimes, and he knows he shouldn’t do this but he can’t help himself, he fantasises that Castiel does slip on the ice and that it creates the perfect excuse for Dean to go rushing out, help him up, and Castiel is so grateful that he invites Dean in for a drink to say thank you and they hit it off, spending all evening talking and laughing, then Dean makes them both breakfast the next morning, and…
“Are you insane?” She laughs and it isn’t a pleasant sound. “We don’t need to do that, Dean. Don’t be ridiculous.”
“It looks like Christmas in here!” Billie announces proudly, reaching for Cas with arms full of neatly-wrapped Christmas tree sugar cookies. “And it smells like it, too!”
“Dean, I’ll come and get you. You can come here, it's fine. It's not a problem. Just tell me your address.”
Cas glances at the clock: two in the morning. There's every chance Jimmy hasn't gone to bed yet, is sitting up watching documentaries with a glass of wine after grading his final term papers. His summer break starts next week, which means he's been up to his eyeballs in paperwork yet has still found time for his brother and nephews. Cas feels a swell of affection towards his twin and picks up his cup and phone, settling on the sofa beside the open screen door and finding the source of the draught. He must have forgotten to close it properly before bed. That's not like him. There's a sweater of Dean’s thrown over the arm and he pulls it on, feeling chilled as per usual these days. The remnants of the nightmare still cling to him, images of things he can't forget, and he blinks to try and clear them. The shadows in the living room seem threatening somehow and he turns on the lamp beside him, pulling his knees to his chest.
to him, distracts him in a way he should find irritating but just can't.
Cas pauses before hitting send. He doesn't want Jimmy to worry; he's perfectly fine and just going through a weird phase. He's always been prone to nightmares, or night terrors as his parents used to call them, so this is nothing new. He just hasn't suffered with them in a long time. Since right after Cole’s death. In the months that followed he had been like some macabre animated corpse: pale and thin and plagued by horrific nightly visions of his husband lying dead before him, of his children crying, and himself collapsing to his knees with his baby boy in his arms unable to look away from the scene before him. It had been the worst period of his life, and the fear of ever feeling that way again is causing him more stress than he dare admit. He can't pinpoint where it's all come from lately, but the worry of what could happen in the future and the ‘what if’s that slink in whenever he's alone and his mind wanders. Sipping his mint tea he shakes his head dully, trying to come back to himself, and erases the word he's typed.
Wednesday afternoon finds Sam slumped over his desk, sweating buckets thanks to broken air-con and a despairingly inept handyman, with his cell phone in his hand and a grim frown between his eyebrows. His hair is sticking unpleasantly to his forehead and whenever he brushes it back it just sticks to the nape of his neck instead. Maybe Dean’s onto something when he tells him to get it trimmed. He works for an hour longer then gives in to the heat, telling his assistant he’s going to finish up the day at home. He works in the city and it’s a short train ride home, one made even more uncomfortable by the heat and the number of people who have also apparently given up on work for the day. He holds onto the strap above his head, body swaying with the movement of the train and tries to read a page or two on his Kindle app but he’s too distracted by thoughts of Dean. He manages to snag a seat when a lady with her children gets off, and before he knows if he’s almost home. He should call Dean when he gets back, maybe try and grab dinner together.
that guy? How is he even real?”
Gabriel finishes cooking, making a spectacle out of it as he pours rum on the burgers and sets them alight, making Amara laugh and clap her hands, encouraging him. Soon they’re settled around the outside table, candles lit and lights strung above them to create a mellow, calm atmosphere as the sun sinks below the horizon, and they sit down to eat together, feeling, to Dean, like a real family. He keeps catching Sam casting him furtive glances, looking between him and Amara, and Dean makes a special effort to pay attention to her, tucking her hair behind her ear or stroking her shoulder or kissing her cheek whenever he can. She enjoys it, pressing into his side and smiling up at him. It’s like old times again.
He snaps his fingers sharply at the two younger men flanking the double doors, who immediately nod a small bow to Dean before vanishing into the restaurant. Dean waves away his apology, his blood singing with the shot of Scotch he’d quickly swallowed before leaving the room, and takes in his surroundings. Low lighting, the murmur of political and economic discussions, ladies laughing, the clink and chink of crystal glasses and china plates, and in the midst of it all - Sam. Sitting at a large circular table flanked by two men that Dean recognises from their introductions earlier, but can’t name, and with Jessica sitting opposite him, her blonde curls twisted into an artful style on the top of her head, jewels glinting at her wrists and decollete. She looks as bored by the whole debacle as Dean feels. And, two seats along from her, dark-haired and imperious: Ruby. Dean snorts quietly as the restaurant manager reappears with a dark-haired, dark-eyed waiter in tow. Both of them are dressed in black tie, shoes shined to perfection, and not a hair out of place.
Dean gives Lexie one last kiss on the forehead, pulls the covers up over Billie, and follows Cas back into their room where they sit down together on the edge of the bed and remain in silence for a while. Eventually, Cas reaches over and takes his hand, smoothing a thumb over the back of it.
“It was an accident! I was distracted!” He’s raised his hands in supplication, anything to try and calm the situation down. “You should have told me you were having money troubles, I could have helped…”
“Absolutely. Everyone seems to be enjoying themselves and behaving,” the cop smiles. “What more can I ask for?”
Amara closes the door behind her and returns to the kitchen. The large glass doors are wide open, allowing a warm breeze to drift in and circle around the kitchen. There’s a bottle of wine open on the countertop in a cooler and she pours herself a second, sipping it slowly and tapping her manicured nails on the marble top as she does. Outside, Dean is bent over the barbecue, tinkering with something.
He's never felt so hurt in his entire life. He always thought nothing could come between him and Cas and truthfully he isn’t entirely sure what it is that has. He knows Cas hasn’t been right for a while. He’s been having horrendous nightmares about his dead husband and has been on the phone to Jimmy at three in the morning countless times over the last few weeks, shaken and nervous, murmuring things about Cole and Dean and almost delirious with exhaustion. He knows Cas is struggling to plan the wedding, worried about what Dean wants and worried it isn't gelling with his own desires. But, as Jimmy has told him countless numbers of times, how will he know if he doesn't ask? But Cas hasn't asked, doesn't dare to. He just chokes it all down and eventually it's going to come to the surface and who knows what will happen then? He's seen Cas and Dean fight, and it isn't pretty. He’s worried about his brother, especially now that he can’t call him and see how he’s doing. He’s tried, of course. But Castiel never answers his phone.
“Don't you want someone, Cassie?” His cousin has asked him only the other week over coffee at his bakery. “A real someone. Not just a fuck buddy.”
Castiel groans, covering his eyes with a hand. He hasn't worked out in years, not beyond going for the occasional jog when he notices that his stomach is a little softer than he generally prefers. And now he's just had a phone call to tell him he's won a month’s free gym membership thanks to the raffle ticket he bought at the charity event almost two weeks ago. He'd stuttered his thanks, hung the phone up, and levelled a look at Meg who had stared coolly back before bursting into such raucous laughter that tears streamed down her cheeks.
“Well, I do what I can.” She laughs lightly in an attempt at modest which fools nobody. “When you have so much, you should really give something back, don’t you think?”
, usually one he can rely on to help him drift off, hadn’t done the trick tonight and he had been lying there for hours, alternating between staring at the ceiling and the closet door.
“No.” Castiel adjusts his tie self-consciously. “I wore it to Michael’s wedding last year. It still fits.”
Dean could have a lot of intensely enjoyable dreams about those thighs.
And that's how Dean finds them the next morning: Cas curled awkwardly in Lexie’s kid-sized bed with his child draped over his chest. It's Cas who he goes to first, stroking his lover’s hair and waking him slowly, smiling and leaning in to steal a morning kiss when Cas’ eyes soften and he smiles up at him.
After dinner, as Dean rose with the other guests to retire to the smoking room, Sam had materialised at his side and tapped him on the shoulder.
“You’re corny as hell, Cas.” Dean laughs, allowing himself to be backed up against the countertop and lifted up onto it, leaning back and allowing Castiel’s kisses to trail from his jawline down his neck, then his t-shirt is being tugged down so his clavicle can receive the same treatment. “Cas, we can’t. My family will be here soon. Mmmm, but that feels so good…”
“Eve dropped those by last night,” Cas says, sliding onto the stool next to Dean and taking one for himself. “She knew we wouldn’t have much food yet. I haven’t been to the store.”
Currently, Billie is reaching for the camera Dean bought for Cas for Christmas, and is just turning it over in his hands with a curious, mischievous expression on his face. Dean notices, glancing up from where he's chopping carrots for dinner and humming Metallica under his breath agin, and opens his mouth to ask the child to put it down when he's beaten to it.
“We are.” They clink bottles and Sam sets his aside while he flips the burgers, adding a fourth without comment. “The house is great, it’s near work. The neighbourhood is homey,” He casts a sideways glance at Dean. “It’d be nice if you guys moved into a place like this. Perfect to raise-“
. It’s just a shame he feels like he wants to shed the expensive tuxedo he’s wearing, roll up his sleeves, and head down into the lower decks of the ship to find himself some people who he’d be more at home with. It’s stifling, being in a room with the people he’s being forced to associate with. It feels like he’s choking, as though invisible hands are wrapped around his throat and are tightening slowly as every day passes.
“What happened? Where are you?” He can hear a scuffling sound on the end of the phone. “Dean? Talk to me?”
Then she's gone in a cloud of chai spices and sweet perfume and Castiel stares after her, a little hot under the collar. He knows exactly what dress Meg is planning to wear tonight, a tight-fitting red number that shows off her curves in all the right way. She'd sent him a photo of it the night before. And if her flirty farewell means anything, neither of them will be going home alone tonight. Maybe he should hire a tuxedo after all.
He’s adjusting to it all okay, he thinks. Better than he thought he would. It had taken a while to accept, but now he’s starting to feel at home in this world. Meeting Jessica has helped, certainly. And he can’t help it: he quite likes being waited on. You know, on occasion. Having someone to get him a drink when he fancies one, or clear the table for him after dinner, or make up his bed for him. Make sure the fires are lit and cleaned out the following morning. Cleaning. Tidying. All the things he didn’t realise he hated doing until he no longer had to do them. Of course, in what he’s come to think of as his ‘old life’ his home was a quarter of the size of his current one, so cleaning and tidying it didn’t take the mammoth effort that it does now. He didn’t need staff back then. Now he wonders how he would cope without them.
“I know, baby. I know.”
The source had been Dean, steaming drunk and laughing as a steward and a porter held him up between them. His shirt had been unfastened to mid-chest, hair askew, cheeks flushed, and the smell of cheap spirits had pervaded the air in the corridor. Sam has cast furtive looks up and down, then dragged Dean into the room by his belt, standing back to allow the ship’s staff to follow.
“Unless what?”
Onward to the chapter!
They lie quietly together for a while, each tracing patterns on the other’s skin. Afternoon bleeds into evening and the sun goes down outside, plunging the bedroom into cool, greying shadows. Dean plays with Castiel’s hair, kisses his temple.
Dean is relaxed. He's sipping occasionally from a beer bottle, has his head tipped back against the sofa, and is quietly humming
It's just a shame they can't talk back.
He tugs at his bow tie where it cuts uncomfortably into his Adam’s apple, and feels a bead of sweat drip down his spine beneath his shirt. He’s dressed up to the nines in his best (only) tuxedo and bears a bunch of roses in one arm and candy in a heart-shaped box in the other.
Standing and swallowing down that thought, he heads upstairs and unlocks the heavy front door, pulling it open and welcoming the morning summer breeze that winds its way in from outside. Words, half-formed, die on his lips at the sight of his visitor.
What happens
Sorry this has taken so long! I have an eye ulcer which means writing has been a bit difficult. All on the mend now.
But he doesn't voice it. Mainly because he doesn't get a chance.
“His new wife, Madeleine,” Molly Brown whispers to him conspiratorially when the pair have turned away to greet other passengers. At Sam’s sharp look, she gives him a smile. “I saw you looking.”
“I got totally swept up in all this,” he gestures to the mess of books and papers on his desk, to the leather-bound text in front of him. “I didn’t mean to keep you waiting. I apologise.”
The unsinkable ship.”
or maybe Dean’s now so drunk that he’s hallucinating. But he hasn’t had
“You're beautiful, Amara. You were beautiful last year and you're beautiful now. You haven't gained a pound. C’mere.”
“I’m not sure. Those shades are kinda hiding everything that might help me work it out. Would you mind?” He mimes pushing sunglasses up onto his head and the cop laughs, obliging. Then Dean’s looking right at him, right into his eyes, and swears he forgets to breathe for a second. The guy has blue eyes, perfect, ocean blue eyes and it feels like he’s staring straight into Dean’s soul.
Or can he?
“Kinda intrusive, though.” Dean mumbles, looking down at his boots with flushed cheeks. Most of his embarrassment and fear that Castiel was going to freak out and call the cops has all but dissolved, but he still feels a bit stupid for doing what he’s done. He freezes in utter shock when Castiel’s hand comes into his peripheral vision, hesitates, then reaches over to clasp one of his hands in his own.
“Let’s board.” He smiles at her as the sun moves out from behind a cloud, bathing the excited crowd in glorious warmth. “This is going to be the journey of a lifetime. I’m sure of it.”
The rest of the evening goes without a hitch, and later on Gabriel turns up the music and they play a lengthy game of Monopoly, Sam forcing them to continue way past the moment when even Gabriel groans and grumbles that he’s over it and wants to head inside to bed. Amara wins, and Gabriel kisses her hand in congratulations. The evening is a success.
“I'm fine, Gabriel. Really. But thank you for your concern.”
But then they drink, and drink a little more, and as Dean gets progressively more drunk his inhibitions drop to next to nothing and his confidence soars. Then, every time, it ends the same way: with him draped over a stranger, shirtless, covered in glitter and body paint and having the time of his life. He never forgets Sam though, always checking to make sure his brother is okay and not being left out of conversations or impromptu dance parties (no matter how much Sam
It lights the whole sky.
“Not yet, kiddo. Got a few more treats to sell, floors to clean, then I'm all yours.” He blows a raspberry onto Lexie’s neck and the boy giggles and wriggles away. “See anything you fancy?”
“Tennis lessons?” Sam grimaces. “Dean with a tennis racket? Nope, can’t see it.”
“No. Not yet. I can’t sleep, either. Every time I close my eyes I just see him lying there,” Castiel admits, resting his chin on Dean’s head. Dean pushes his hands under the warm woolen cardigan, up under Cas’ t-shirt to feel the heat of his skin. “I see you crying. I see Billie, frightened of us both. I see things that aren’t real, too, Dean. But it’s normal after an experience like this.”
Sam smirks back at him, pretending to whack him on the arm with the spatula. Dean ducks away, laughing, pressing down the hollow dart of alarm that threatened to rise at his brother’s jokey gesture. Sam wouldn’t really hit him, and it wouldn’t hurt if he did. He’s being stupid, reacting to it. He turns away to open two beers, handing one to his brother and leaning against the fence post to watch him cook.
Now, melancholy and missing home, he fumbles in his pocket and retrieves his tobacco and paper, rolling a cigarette between experienced fingers and striking up a match, cupping his hand over it to protect the flame from the wind. It takes a few tries but eventually he lights it and inhales, filling his lungs and coughing a little as the acrid smoke catches the back of his throat. He exhales through both nostrils, twisting his lips to one side and putting aside all thoughts of Ellen and Joanna for now. He misses them. He misses it all. This isn’t what he pictured when, as a child, he imagined being rich. Not at all.
Because he is. Okay, that is. Dean Winchester is always okay.
“ You're very welcome. Thanks for forcing me to buy the tickets. I’ll call you later.”
Then he's gone, Meg on his arm as she shoots both Dean and Amara a look that could freeze the seventh circle of Hell, and Dean feels his chest tighten in humiliation and remorse. Castiel had looked utterly flummoxed by Amara’s comments and by Dean’s inaction. He trails behind as they all head towards the event room, sensing Sam hang back to walk with him.
“Have you spoken to him since?” Sam demanded, heat rising in his cheeks in both indignation and stress, and Gabriel’s cool hand on his forearm warned him to try and back off. Castiel was the one to help Dean, not hurt him.
It’s hot, hurried, and Castiel pants into his mouth the entire time as Dean’s hand works him into an aroused frenzy, bringing him closer and closer to orgasm. Their Panama pants are pushed down to their thighs, tangling their legs, and they arch against each other as their pleasure crests. It’s bittersweet for Dean; he finds he can’t truly let go and enjoy it, knowing Cas has been through such an awful trauma. But he’s more than happy to allow his own body to be used however Cas wants to try and bring him the pleasure he craves. They both sweat beneath the sheets and Cas buries his face in Dean’s neck, panting and gasping there, hiding away as his orgasm overwhelms him. He spills over Dean’s fist, hot and sticky, and Dean follows him moments later even as Castiel’s movements on him become slow, jerkier, his grip tightening and easing in spasms as aftershocks wrack his body.
is that I’m still standing here listening to your shit,” he says icily. She actually glances away from her phone for that - hallelujah - but he’s done. He is so fucking done. Feeling like he can’t even look at her anymore, he storms past her, wincing when he accidentally bumps against her shoulder and then doubling his pace when he hears the clicking of her heels following after him.
“People like you?” The guy seems genuinely shocked by Castiel’s tone. “What the hell do you mean? And - wait - ‘guys like me’? What the hell, dude?”
mad.”
an idea.
They had planned to meet for lunch at one o’clock in the bakery downtown, owned by Castiel’s cousin. He steals a look at his watch and cringes at how long she must have been waiting.
“I thought I’d be okay. That I could deal with this by myself. But… I never even got a chance to say goodbye. He basically raised us, Dean. Me, Jimmy and Gabriel. After our mother died, we got really close. He taught me piano, taught me how to drive. Encouraged me to study psychology, helped me open my practice. He was always so proud of every paper I wrote. He told me all the time. And I…” Castiel sniffs, a low, wet sound, and wipes his nose with his sleeve. “I was always too busy to go see him. He’d ask all the time and I’d always put him off. I thought I had time. We should have had time…”
He nudges Cas off him and stands, tugging Cas down the dunes and towards the beach. Laughing and shoving each other they break into a jog, then a run, racing each other to the water. Cas wins, his running regime giving him a head start, and Dean retaliates by tackling him around the waist and they go sprawling into the ocean with cries of laughter, fully-clothed without a care in the world.
“Money’s tight?” Sam is frowning now, and has stopped with his fork halfway to his mouth. “Really? Why didn’t you say anything?”
Amara gets up from the table and approaches him, her movements calm and collected and ice in her dark eyes. Dean wants to cringe away, turn his back, walk into the living room, but he doesn't. He stands his ground. They need to talk about this.
“What? I need an excuse to kiss my fiancé?” Dean pecks him on the mouth again then retreats to finish breakfast.
“Sure thing, Sammy. You got it.”
Onward!
“Don't say it,” he says, preempting a lecture before Sam can even open his mouth. “You know what she's like.”
“Dean? Are you still awake?”
“Dean, I can’t find him. I can't find Billie. He's missing.”
That gets Dean’s attention and he turns to stare at her in incredulity.
“Well,” Cas presses a kiss to Lexie’s forehead. “Why don't we go and see about this monster? I'll get rid of him, then you can go back to sleep. How does that sound?”
And he’s gone, scampering off down the corridor with so much energy that his perfectly combed hair bounces in spite of the pomade slicking it back, and Dean can’t help but chuckle to himself as he lets himself into his suite. The boy is kind of sweet. A little bit like an irritating little brother. But still.
Dean lets him babble on, closing his eyes in an attempt to stop the room from spinning. It doesn't work and a wave of nausea grips him instead, one he can't fight off. He vomits into the glass and blood in the shower stall, coughing up watery bile and trembling with the effort. The phone slips from his hand as he cradles his pounding head. Fuck. He needs to pull himself together.
Castiel wakes in the middle of the night, gasping. He's sitting bolt upright, eyes glazed unseeingly, with his hand outstretched in front of him as though he's reaching for something... or someone. It takes him a full minute to realise where he is and that he's been trapped in the throes of a nightmare, and when he finally lowers his hand he clenches it into a fist in an effort to stop it trembling. Glancing down, he takes in the prone figure of Dean sleeping soundly next to him. Dean’s face is relaxed in sleep, a small smile playing at the corner of his mouth, and he's snoring softly. One hand pillows his cheek and the other twists gently in the sheets around his waist after being almost tugged off him by Cas’s tossing and turning. As his heartbeat slows, Cas reaches out and winds his fingers through Dean’s hair, finding comfort in the touch, though his hand still shakes and he's drenched in cold sweat and shivering. Hugging his knees in to his chest he rests his forehead on them for a moment before pushing the sheets away and getting up. The hardwood floor is cool beneath his bare feet. His throat is tight and he swallows reflexively. Has he been talking in his sleep? Crying out? He must not have been. Dean surely would have awoken if he was.
Dean is pretty sure that in all his thirty-six years, he’s never had a better plan. And when he gets up off the couch, the fact that the living room sways more than a little doesn’t even register. He’s got a mission to complete.
The thing is, Sam Winchester would
The screen shatters.
As though by magic, his phone chooses that moment to beep at him and he spins it towards him, reading the text message on the screen without really seeing it. It’s from Castiel, asking him how he is. Again. He’s sent a total of nine messages this week, all short but loaded with concern, and Dean’s replied to precisely two of them. He doesn’t know what to say. Half of him wants to block the guy’s number and hope never to run into him again, and the other half wants to divulge everything he’s feeling, every moment of fear and sickness and anger at how wayward his relationship has become because he knows Castiel will listen and respond with no judgement. But he can’t risk that, he knows he can’t.
“No, not tonight,” Castiel says slowly, venturing out onto his porch and taking in Dean’s handiwork with wide-eyed awe. “What… Dean, what are you doing here?”
He misses the children so much. They've been such a big part of his life ever since they were tiny, even when he and Cas lived miles apart. The boys are rays of sunshine in their own ways - Lexie very sweet and caring, and Billie adventurous and outgoing. He used to love lazy evenings in at the beach house, out on the terrace in the late afternoons, when the twins would fall asleep on top of him all warm and cuddly. Cas would sit with a glass of wine and just smile at them, watching them in silence for hours. In truth, moving to be close to his brother had been a split-second decision and one he had never regretted.
This guy - this
“He claims he’s traveling with you, Mr. Winchester,” the steward had sniffed, looking at Dean distastefully as the elder Winchester had collapsed down into Sam’s vacated seat and was reaching for the untouched glass of champagne, which Sam quickly whipped out of reach. Dean had flared, but Sam had paid him no attention.
“None for me,” Dean waves a hand lazily. “Need to be heading to bed.”
“Mr. Winchester?” There’s a sharp knock at the door, and a moment later it opens to reveal Jack, standing almost to attention, every muscle in his body wound tight and an expression of pride on his face. “I’ve come to walk with you to dinner. Mr. Winchester - the other Mr. Winchester, goodness it’s confusing - said you might need my assistance in finding the dining room.”
“No, genius. She's talking to someone.”
It's late when Dean and Amara finally stumble through their front door, both at different levels of inebriation. The night was a roaring success and Dean couldn't contain the swell of pride he felt as he watched Amara up on stage, thanking the fire service for their years of hard work and presenting them with a cheque that made their mouths drop open. He'd been on his feet applauding as soon as her speech had finished and she'd blown him a kiss from the stage, looking a million bucks. They'd slow-danced together, later on, he'd drunk tequila shots with Gabriel and had shared an illicit cigar with Sam outside - a decision he knows his brother will baulk at come morning. Sam will probably wash his mouth out with soapy water and need a lie down to cope with the trauma. He sniggers at the idea, almost overbalances and only just manages to catch himself on the closet door as the room sways around him. Maybe that last beer wasn't such a good idea.
“Will you come?” Castiel turns his head to look at Dean. “I don’t want to be alone.”
Dinner wasn’t the unmitigated disaster that it could have been. On reflection, as he sits in the smoking lounge with a brandy in one hand and a Jose Morales in the other, it went fairly well. He didn’t offend any of the other diners, he wasn’t asked to leave, and he’s still sober enough to know where he is and who he’s with.
Dean is jerked awake a few hours later by the sound of his phone ringing. He's evidently fallen asleep with it right beside his head because he's instantly deaf in one ear from the loud, sharp noise. He blinks, disoriented, then groans as pain sears through his head behind his eyes, scrabbling to silence his phone with a trembling hand. Shit. This feels like the worst hangover he's ever had and then some. Blearily, he looks at the screen to see Amara’s name and frowns, before turning his head to realise that he's alone, in an unfamiliar bed, in an unfamiliar room. The sheets smell different. There's the low sound of cars passing by on the street outside. Amber light from street lamps drifts in from behind the curtains.
Castiel hadn’t been much help. It was clear something had happened that night, but whenever Sam’s enquiries got too close to what was probably the truth, Castiel clammed up and said it wasn’t his story to tell, and that they needed to have Dean here to talk things out properly.
“No. But I will be.”
“That's…” Cas flounders for a second, his overwrought brain struggling to keep up. “Not very nice. Where did he come from?”
He says it quietly, suddenly shy, and Castiel’s blue eyes widen in disbelief for a moment before a slow, joy-filled smile spreads across his lips. Then he buries his head in Dean’s chest and
“Daddy?” A very small voice drifts from the hallway and Cas turns to look over the back of the sofa at Lexie, rubbing his eyes and stumbling softly across the room. “I can't sleep.”
But Castiel’s tone belays his words. That isn’t all, and Sam knows it. It’s visible in the tightness of Castiel’s mouth, the frown lines, the way he’s holding his shoulders. It looks as though he’s having an internal debate with himself as to whether he should divulge something clearly personal to Dean or not. Eventually, he apparently comes to the conclusion that he shouldn’t and clams up entirely, saying nothing more behind encouraging Sam to talk to his brother. The barbecue goes off without a hitch, but Dean is noticeably absent and it leaves a sour taste in the air.
and she didn't mean it and
“Don't you think something is off there? With him and his wife?”
like everyone, that he's infuriatingly particular about whom he spends his time with. But it would be a poor attempt at deflection, one that his younger brother would see straight through.
Dean wakes in the night, crying in his sleep. He thinks he might have been dreaming about Castiel. He lies still in a patch of moonlight, wiping his eyes and wondering why the mere thought of the older man fills him with both devastating sadness and a flicker of something he thought he'd forgotten long ago. Hope.
This morning, when Sam emerges from the shower in sweatpants and a plain black t-shirt, he finds Gabriel standing at the stove humming a tune to himself, lost in what he's doing. Sam creeps up behind him, slides both arms around his waist and presses a kiss to his temple. A warm hand comes up to cup his jaw and Gabriel turns to kiss him on the mouth.
His brother had been fairly athletic at school, when he felt like putting the effort in. But these days he prefers jogging and lifting weights to any sort of competitive or team sport. Unless that’s another thing Amara has managed to persuade him into doing.
He's halfway through imagine a plate stacked high with blueberry pancakes when his phone beeps. It's Amara:
“Huh?” Dean pulls away sharply and sits up. “No. Don’t know what you mean.”
“Woman, have you lost your mind? He probably has some equally stupid-hot husband lurking somewhere. Besides,” he laughs in a way that sounds a little too self-deprecating. “I’m way out of his league. He should be so lucky.”
She squeezes his thigh and he unconsciously tightens the blanket around him. He's itching to be alone now, for some peace and quiet to just think.
“I'm sorry, Cas,” she'd said, wiping her eyes with the back of her hand, eyeliner smudging a little as she does. “But I was just picturing you. In little shorts. Lifting weights. And… oh, that's it.”
Gabriel winks lewdly while Cas blushes scarlet and Dean glares half-heartedly. Gabriel is a consummate flirt, and it doesn't seem to matter one jot that he's straight as an arrow: he loves to hit on both Dean and Cas on the regular. But Dean isn't one to say no to an early finish, so he high-tails it to the break room to unwind his apron from his waist and grab a change of clothing. He can hear Gabriel and Cas making small talk and strains his ears to listen. Castiel isn't the biggest fan of the candy-loving baker. He's never said as much, but Dean has caught him shooting jealous glances whenever Gabriel gets too flirty, and his tone is always stiff and formal whenever they hang out. Like it is right now.
“Mr Winchester? This way please, sir.”
He never sleeps particularly well after a night of drinking. Especially when he was so rattled when they’d returned home last night. The evening had been fine, but the words that the woman with the long dark hair had thrown at them had stuck in his head. He can’t even remember her name, but what he does remember he doesn’t like. Her supercilious smile, her barbed comments which clearly showed how superior she thought she and her friends were. And the way her boyfriend - husband? - had just
He looks around the group brightly, expecting the polite laughter that Castiel, Sam and Dean all indulge in. But Amara’s face is stony, her smile just the wrong side of friendly, and she tosses back her dark hair in a curtain then clears her throat.
Dean tunes out, even though the suggestion of caramel apple pie is enough to make his mouth water, and watches the snow fall in glittering flakes outside, blanketing the streets and the cars in a perfect white frosting. Across the road, the Impala has a thin layer of snow on her windshield. Dean stirs his vanilla shake slowly, distracted by thoughts of his neighbour. Castiel hasn’t lived opposite him for very long, only a few months, and in that time he seems to do nothing but work and go running. Dean’s never seen any cars outside his house, no guests going in or out, and on moving day Castiel was alone. That’s their only interaction to date: Dean had given the guy what he thought was a friendly smile and offered to help him move in. Castiel, in turn, had looked like a rabbit in the headlights and frantically declined the offer, scurrying up the porch steps and into his house with a box and not reemerging until Dean was safely inside his own home. Since then, all they’ve exchanged are shy smiles and quick waves - all instigated by Dean. Perhaps Sam’s right and he should just let the whole thing go, but something about Castiel is drawing him in magnetically. His house isn’t in disrepair but it’s in dire need of some love and attention and Dean is itching to go over there and fix the porch steps and give it a lick of paint. The only lights that ever go on at night are the kitchen and the bedroom, never the living room or any of the other upstairs rooms. The house feels lonely and cold, and Castiel himself doubly so. And the utter absence of all Christmas decorations is the cherry on top of everything. Dean wonders what Castiel would do if he turned up on his doorstep tonight with a handmade wreath for his door as a Christmas Eve gift.
Then, following his brother’s slightly glazed eyes, he sees what made Dean come to an immediate halt and stifles a smirk behind his hand. Not what, but rather
(See the end of the chapter for
“I don't want to fight any more, not tonight.” Exhaustion seems to have seeped bone-deep into him and he reaches for her hand to apologize, only to be slapped away. “C’mon. Let's just forget it all and go to bed, okay? I'm exhausted, I have to be up early…”
The excuses fell so easily off of Dean’s tongue Castiel can’t help but wonder how many times he’s used them before, how many times he’s repeated them to himself...
“Dean.” Ruby says, her rouge-tinted lips lifting in a smile to reveal straight, white teeth. She has a deep blue sapphire nestled in her cleavage and a string of pearls woven into her hair. Her dress is black and beaded, lace draping over her shoulders, and she looks wonderful. Shame her beauty is only on the outside. “So glad you could join us. Isn’t it a wonderful party?”
He looks around then for Dean, expecting to find him talking to a pretty young girl and flashing her his charm, but instead, his brother is standing on the staircase, leaning one hip against the banister and looking up at the clock, a pensive expression upon his face. His arms are folded tightly, as though giving himself a hug, and the tension in his shoulders belays his discomfort. He doesn’t like sea travel, never has, and has been dreading the return journey to New York ever since they arrived in Europe all those weeks ago. He had vanished into his cabin as soon as he’d been shown which one was his, straight-backed and tense, and had emerged a half-hour later looking, well, not relaxed exactly but more capable of dealing with the situation that he’s been presented with. Sam knows why: he’d heard the unmistakable clink of bottles when their steward had lifted one of Dean’s bags and had seen his brother’s eyes flick sharply to the offending item of luggage, a brief expression of guilt fleeting across his features. The only unknown question is whether it’s a beer or two that Dean has had to settle his nerves, or if he’s started early on the hard spirits. It wouldn’t be out of character; the elder Winchester had spent most of the journey to France comatose in his room under the influence of a bottle of cheap vodka he’d procured in the hours before boarding.
Cas can picture his brother’s doubtful frown.
It's the guy from the charity event. The guy on the arm of the woman who had insulted both him and Meg, who had stood by and said nothing. Had probably shared his wife's sentiments. So, in other words, an asshole. And Castiel is not in the mood for assholes, in any sense of the word. Even when they come in such a pretty package.
He sits in the office for a while, staring out of the window at nothing, picking idly at one of the healing scabs on his wrist until it bleeds. He’s entirely unaware that, across town, his brother is waiting to give him either a strict talking to or a firm ass-kicking. Whichever comes first.
A white picket fence divides the passengers from the onlookers, people waving each other off, some waving back animatedly while other lift their chins and walk with an air of superiority, as though
Blocking out Dean’s slightly wild detractions as Jo continues to needle him, he checks out the cop again over his brother’s shoulder. The guy is smiling demurely at a girl who is posing next to him, holding up her phone for a selfie, before encouraging her back onto the sidewalk and safely behind a barrier as another truck passes by. The roads have been opened again for a few hours and cars are starting to drive past, weaving their way between rainbow flags and placards and people taking photos and dancing and embracing. The cop says something into his radio, then turns to look over his shoulder as though he senses someone’s eyes on him and Sam looks away quickly. Damn aviators, he can’t tell if his snooping was observed or not. He needs to invest in some of his own.
“He is. My apologies,” Sam had held out a hand towards Jack who had instantly pressed his billfold into it. “Will this cover any inconvenience?”
chopping a tree down and displaying its corpse in your home is the exact opposite of a crime against nature, Dean,” Sam says mildly, spearing a lettuce leaf with his fork, much to Dean’s distaste. “Why are you so obsessed with this guy, anyway? Are you the creepy neighbour who spies on him from behind your curtains?”
“He’ll be fine. Cassie doesn’t take shit like that to heart. Water off a duck’s back.” Gabriel finishes his plate of waffles and narrows his eyes at the pan as though he’s trying to decide whether to polish off the last one. “It’s his date I’d worry about. That Meg is a feisty one. If she and Amara wound up in a ring together, I know who my money would be on.”
“Yes.” Comes the simple answer. “He’s sent me a couple of text messages.”
“Cassie, so good to see you.” Gabriel smiles at the pair, leaning over to clap the man on the shoulder and ruffle his already tousled hair. “This is my better half, Sam, but I think you’ve met. This is his brother, Dean, and Amara, Dean’s girlfriend. Everyone, this is my cousin Castiel and the ever-gorgeous Meg, who I never see enough of.”
“Yeah? Does it feel real to you yet?”
Behind him somewhere, his luggage is being loaded onto a trolley and will somehow miraculously arrive in their cabin before he does. He slows his pace to a stroll, content to allow the staff a few extra minutes to get his room arranged to his liking. This is all so new to him: staff. Luggage. England. First Class.
The word
“Dean?” Amara appears in the doorway, dragging a comb through her long damp hair. “What are you smiling about?”
His head cracks against the expensive tiled wall and he remembers nothing but blackness.
“Yeah?” Dean smirks, glancing out at the water. “I think I know a good way to wake you up…”
She moves back towards him, smiling coyly and wrapping her arms around his neck. “You think?”
He has to be.
It's in a white envelope with Cas and Dean’s names written on in neat cursive, and they've both been steadfastly ignoring it for the past week. It's an invitation to parents’ night at the school tonight to round up the school year, and neither of them are excited about going. Cas is nervous, both fretting about the kids not doing well and reiterating that it doesn't matter either way because he knows his kids are smart and doesn't need anyone else to tell him so. He gets this look about him whenever he goes on one of his rants about it, and Dean has to hide a smile behind his hand. As for himself, he just plain doesn't want to go. He still isn't good with crowds - when the bakery gets packed out he feels tense and sweaty - and he can't help but imagine people staring at him at the school, talking about him and Cas, talking about the twins. His fears are unfounded, he's sure, but he can't quite crush them down.
Cas isn't OK. Something's wrong.
“I'm absolutely fine, Dean,” says Cas in a tone that suggests he is, in fact, anything but.
With a mounting sense of concern, Castiel pushes open the only door left, the door to what must be the master bathroom. There, against the wall with bloody cuts to his arms, neck and face, Dean is sitting with his head in his hands. There's broken glass all over the floor, spots and streaks of blood where Dean’s clearly pulled himself up out of the shower stall and moved away from the worst of the mess, and there's a rank smell of sweat and vomit in the air.
“What’s wrong?” Castiel’s voice is firm now, harsher and more gravelly than Dean has ever heard it, and he sounds so serious that somehow it’s amusing. A snort of mildly hysterical laughter bubbles from him and he scrubs a shaking hand across his face.
He offers up an unconvincing smile and Dean squeezes his fingers.
“Damn, have you
“What’s that?”
Stung, Dean drops his hand and sits back in his chair. The air around them is thick with acrid cigar smoke and he adds to it, inhaling and exhaling just to buy himself a few precious seconds before he responds. “Maybe. Does it matter?”
He throws their bedroom door open and turns to slam it in her face but he’s too slow because she’s right there.
“Fine, thanks.”
“Does that dusty dictionary of yours have a definition for the word ‘commando’ in there? Because that's how I'll be tonight.”
Irrationally irritated, both by Sam’s peculiar behaviour with Ruby and at the strange conversation with this unwelcome stranger, Dean turns his back and heads for the door on the opposite side of the room. All around him, men are standing in small clusters, laughing and conversing and visibly revelling in their own successes. They all clutch crystal glasses filled with whisky, brandy, Scotch, gin, anything strong and alcoholic, and Dean’s skin itches with the desire to have just one more as a nightcap. Perhaps he can have something sent to his cabin. No, he corrects himself, his
Dean hasn’t been out for very long, not publicly at least. For years, only Sam and their closest friends Jo and Charlie knew the Dean wasn’t as into girls as he pretended to be; that the entire ladies’ man demeanour was him desperately trying to overcompensate for the fact that he wasn’t comfortable in his own skin and thought that there was something wrong with him for the way he felt. He’s always been a strong, confident guy, for as long as Sam can remember, and somewhere along the line had got it into his head that he couldn’t be the person he was while liking men. It had taken months of self-analysis, interspersed with fits of anger and emotion, for Dean to come to terms with himself and now that he has done it seems he wants the whole world to know. And the annual Pride parade has quickly become his favourite day of the year.
“What?” He laughs, sipping from his own bottle and wishing the entire table wasn’t staring at him. Why did he have to say anything about money? “Sammy, that’s kind. Thanks. But we’re fine. If I ever need a loan, I’d rather owe the bank than you guys. But I don’t. Need a loan. We’re fine. Amara’s right, I was being dramatic. Everything’s fine.”
“You’re forgiven. You're shaking, Clarence.” Meg takes one of his hands in both of hers. “I think it's time to lay off the caffeine for the day.”
It had seemed like such a good idea at the time, when he’d started to plan everything out on the plane. He’s been brewing all week over what happened and throwing ideas around for how he can make it up to Cas without either angering him further or making either of them out to be a total ass. He remembered once, after a pretty intense round of lovemaking, they’d watched some crappy rom-com where the guy had turned up in a suit and tie with flowers and candy, and Cas had elbowed him in the ribs and asked when he was going to do that for him. Dean had rolled his eyes dramatically and gone down on Castiel instead. But that probably won’t cut it this time.
He wakes suddenly, eyes open and staring unseeingly ahead of him, to the smell of bacon and coffee coming from the kitchen, and the twins’ lilting voices chattering away animatedly. His hands are clenched in the sheets and every muscle feels wound up tight. Was he dreaming? Another nightmare? He can't remember. Everything feels hazy as he blinks sleep from his eyes and sits up - then panic sets in as he realises how light it is outside and how late it must be. He casts about for his phone or the clock, his heart hammering against his ribs. He's overslept, he must have. Is he late? Who's taking the kids to school? Why isn't Dean at work? Then, with a rush of relief, he realises it's Sunday morning and it doesn't matter how late he's slept. They have nothing to do and nowhere to be. He collapses back against the pillows with a sigh, rubbing his temples and turning to snuggle down under the pristine white sheets... well, they were pristine until Billie decided to bring his colouring books into Dean and Cas’ bed one morning. Now they're streaked with blue and green crayon.
“…out of hand,” she's sobbing again, managing to speak through her tears, and Dean can only nod numbly at this. “I'm so sorry, Dean. For everything. Can you ever forgive me?”
Cas had gone to Billie’s room while Dean sorted out the broken parts of the camera, and he could hear low murmurs and hushed voices floating down the hall. He had sidled close enough to peek through the door and had seen Cas on his knees with Billie’s arms thrown around his neck. There was tension in every line of his partner’s body; he was clearly still upset and Dean was sure the boy could sense it.
He fumbles on the nightstand for his phone and squints at his emails. One from a guy overseas, Raphael, searching for a rare edition of a script from the Old Testament. Fat chance, Castiel thought, but if anyone can find it then he can. He knows why people come to him with this type of peculiar, unorthodox request. He has a reputation amongst his peers for being able to source things nobody else can, and he’s made a name for himself within his niche industry. He wonders where Raphael got his name and email address from. The screen is blurred without his glasses and he has to close one eye and squint to read it properly.
“Yes,” Comes the clipper, automatic reply. “I’ll be much happier when we’re back on dry land though. I’ve got a bad feeling about this, Sam.” Worried green eyes suddenly turn to him and Sam feels a pang of sympathy for his brother. “Perhaps we should have disembarked in France. Stayed a while longer.”
“No, not yet!” Jack misses the dig completely. “I thought I’d wait until you and the other Mr. Winchester were back, just in case you needed anything. Do you? Need anything?”
1) the annual Christian festival celebrating Christ's birth, held on 25 December in the Western Church.
And not the kind of relaxed, post-coital single-glistening-tear-of-happiness crying the situation warrants, either. This is sadness, deep and soul-wrenching, the type that makes Cas shake and struggle to draw breath, and Dean has to forcibly push himself up onto his forearms to get Cas to release him.
“What?” Dean’s head whips back around in the direction of the cop so quickly he risks whiplash, and Jo cracks up laughing.
“Does that help?”
“I…” He fumbles over the words, falls silent. He wants to say that no, he just can't. There's too much hurt here. Too much deceit, too many lies. But she descends into fresh sobs and, in spite of himself, his heart aches for her. “I don't know. We need to talk, okay? About a lot of things. I dunno what to think right now.”
“He’s a cop, Jo. He’s probably an asshole.” Dean doesn’t turn to speak to her, doesn’t even tear his eyes away from the guy long enough to say hello. “Hi, by the way.”
“I have a monster under my bed,” Lexie says, almost conversationally. “He's keeping me awake.”
“We've met,” he says coolly. “But I'm not surprised you don't remember. Guys like you don't tend to remember people like me.”
“He could hear me!” Dean hisses, but there’s a quirk of a smile playing at his lips.
painted proudly across the top. Porters move back and forth, directing other staff as burly men in vests and braces haul luggage carts to and fro.
for working with me on this story!
“Yes!” Gabriel sounds surprised. “I had no idea he was coming. He normally avoids these things like the plague. We should say hi. Cassie! Over here!”
“He was careless, Dean,” Cas’ voice is choked and he wipes at his cheeks fiercely with his fingertips. “You told him not to play with it and he didn't listen.”
As if he’s reading Dean’s mind, Castiel leans into him and lets out a low sigh.
Then not much at all.
“Huh?” Dopily, Dean turns to see Charlie on her tiptoes, waving wildly at him and calling his name so loud it can be heard above everyone else’s conversations around them. In truth, he’d almost forgotten that they weren’t alone. “Oh. Shit, yeah. I should probably…” He jerks a thumb over his shoulder and the cop nods, still smiling at him in a way that makes Dean feel like he’s both floating and falling simultaneously.
I'm now on Twitter! Come follow me for writing updates and SPN fun! http://twitter.com/coffeeandcas/
Half an hour later, Castiel is pretty convinced that he, in fact, cannot do this. He's hot, sweaty, his clothes are sticking to him unpleasantly in places they shouldn't, and he's wishing he'd picked up a water bottle at the mall. He's sitting at a weights machine that purports to do something to his triceps, and he can't bring himself to actually use it. His arms ache, his thighs ache, his abs ache, and his head aches. He's so done with this pathetic attempt at a workout, but if he leaves now he’ll make a fool of himself in front of Bela. He keeps peering down the stairs to see if she's left the desk yet, leaving the coast clear for him to make a hasty retreat, but she seems permanently glued there. He's trapped here for the length of a half-decent workout.
Dean turns over, drawing the covers up over himself, mindful of the raw scratches that now adorn his hips and chest. Mindful of his red cheek from her slap. He should get up and put some antiseptic on the worst of it, should maybe shower himself and put on fresh underwear. But a weariness has him in its grip and he can't fight it off any more. He just wants to go to sleep and wake up tomorrow, go to work and pretend that today and tonight never happened.
“You're damn lucky, Dean,” John had told him once as they shared beers outside on the porch of John’s house late one summer’s evening. “Your own business and a woman who loves you. Plenty of men would kill for less.”
Oh, shit. Oh,
“This is quite a party, Amara,” Sam says, lifting his glass to gesture to the room. “You should be proud of yourself, bringing all these people together.”
Then the older Winchester had stumbled to his own cabin and only reappeared a few hours before dinner the following day, subdued and quiet, with a greyish tinge to his skin.
“Me too!” Lexie smiles widely, gazing up at Dean with soulful, pleading eyes. “We can all nap!”
“Meg isn't just a fuck buddy.” Castiel had dipped his cappuccino with a frown, wiping the foam moustache from his top lip. “There's more to it than that.”
Oh God. It's that plea, the desperate tone to her voice, that does it. Dean’s resolve, shaky and tattered to begin with, breaks and he pushes himself up onto an elbow, the phone pressed tightly to his ear.
Abruptly deciding he doesn’t give a shit about rules and decorum any more, after a mere ten minutes of trying, he reaches for a bread roll and tears it in half with his hands, earning a grimace from the elderly man to Sam’s left and an open-mouthed stare from two of the other diners. Molly Brown’s eyebrow and lips lift in a small smile, and Jessica’s eye twinkles as she catches his gaze then quickly looks away. Sam, tight-lipped, looks disapproving and his eyes flick fervently around the table to see if they’re being judged.
He'd really, really missed working here during the time it was being renovated. He and Meg had come into work one morning in early May to find the place barely more than a pile of ashes and kindling as a distraught Gabriel screamed into the phone at some poor insurance associate who must have been quaking in his boots. Some faulty wiring had caused a spark during the night and the place had all but burned to the ground.
“Yes. Thank you.” Then, unable to resist a jab, he says, “Isn’t it past your bedtime?”
He adds a half-spoon of sugar to his espresso and drinks half of it in one gulp, wincing as the liquid scalds the roof of his mouth. It’s early, a half hour after dawn, and Dean’s been up for ages already. He’d woken with a start from a nightmare, sitting up with his heart pounding and his hands fisted in the sheets, feeling nauseous and hot all over. He doesn’t remember the specifics, but it was a familiar nightmare. Pinned in a crashed, crumpled car with the smell of gasoline all around him. Fighting against the seatbelt crushing his chest, restricting his breathing and getting tighter by the second. Glass everywhere, tearing his hands and face to shreds. Screaming for help until his throat is bloody and raw, but nobody coming to his aid. Shadowy figures in his peripheral figure, familiar people, watching him suffer and cry but not stepping in to help him. It’s a nightmare he’s relived over and over throughout his life, one that gets progressively worse the older he gets, and it always causes him to wake up with a piercing cry of distress. Normally Amara will kick him in the shins or pinch him until he snaps out of it, but this morning he must not have been making enough noise to wake her. He’d disentangled himself from the bedsheets, leaving them damp with his own sweat and shut himself in the bathroom, breathing hard and leaning over the sink, locking eyes with his reflection until his heart rate calmed. He’d showered in cold water, dressed in sweatpants and a t-shirt - a Calvin Klein one he didn’t remember buying but one Amara must have put in his drawer for him - and had gone for a run to clear his head.
Exhausted and spent, Dean had just cradled her and stroked her hair, silent, and his gaze distant and glazed. He's too vulnerable right now to try and voice his feelings, for fear of her turning from the apologetic, sorrowful woman in his arms to something full of spite and venom.
They don’t have sex in the shower. Castiel draws him in by the hand once they’re both nude and they kiss, touch, press their bodies against each other, but neither of them feels the pulse of arousal to take things to the next level. Perhaps it’s the residual shock of almost losing Lexie, but all Dean wants is to be close to Cas right now and the feeling seems more than mutual. Castiel washes Dean’s hair, massaging shampoo into his scalp and kissing his cheeks and jaw as he does so, and Dean keeps him close with hands grasping at his hips. He pins Cas to the wall and kisses him deeply, gripping his biceps almost hard enough to bruise, thankful that the rush of water from the shower head conceals some of his tears. But Cas is never one to be fooled and he brushes a thumb over Dean’s cheek, worry creasing his brow.
Again, I ask you to place your faith in me and remember there's a happy ending tag up there somewhere. I'm sure there is...
about a new hotel in Gustavia and it looks so dreamy. I’m hoping Dean will take me there for our anniversary.” She laughs flirtatiously and Gabriel raises his eyes at Dean across the table.
“You do you, Clarence.” Meg hops off the table and swipes her takeout chai from his desk as she heads for the door. “Fuck anyone who gives you any bullshit for your suit. I've got your back. But for the record, I prefer you in something without the elbow patches. Something less ‘geriatric professor’ vibe.”
“Oh, that sounds wonderful! I'll bring some wine. What time?” She slips past him into the kitchen and he's left standing in the empty doorway, trying to think of something to say. “I'll have to buy a new dress. None of my old ones from last summer fit me any more. I can't believe I ever fit into any of them.”
It hadn’t taken him long to buy a property, but the day he received the keys and threw open the door, the sound of his own footsteps had echoed on the hardwood floors and he had been hit with a pang or inexplicable loneliness. He’d always lived with his brother and father, before John passed away and... well, his brother had dealt with the passing of his father in his own way, leaving Sam to hold down the fort as much as he could. Their relationship was close, had always been close, but in the later years Sam could feel the strain like an invisible wire between them, crackling and tugging, and in spite of all his patience and good intentions, he had begun to resent his brother.
“Dogs, right?” Dean cuts him off smoothly, kneeling down to ruffle the ears of Jarvis, their rescue Cocker who has trooped over obediently to see what all the fuss is about. He’s old, going blind and deaf, but is man’s secret favourite out of the pair. “You guys should get a third. All this space, seems like a waste not to.”
The glass wall of the shower screen is behind him. The one he's been meaning to take a look at for weeks. And she pushes him hard enough to send all of his weight falling back against it, his hands scrabbling wildly for purchase on something and finding nothing.
“I don’t know why you even give a damn, I really don’t,” Meg says, pushing her blonde curls out of her face. “He seems like an ass to me.”
Sam hides a smirk by coughing into the back of his hand. The idea of Dean spending the next few days in the company of the world’s finest is mildly entertaining. There will be fireworks at some point, he’s sure.
A short while later, there’s sweat on his forehead and upper lip, dripping down his spine, but he’s red-cheeked with happiness at the results of his hard work. Castiel will love this. He just
“Dean! I tried calling Cas but his phone isn't on. Thank god you answered!”
he types back.
Cas trails off again and a tremor shudders through him - and in an instant, Dean knows. He doesn’t know
“Yes.” Cas pulls into a parking space and unfastens his seat belt.
There’s bread, butter and honey, so Dean makes them both thick slices of toast, two steaming cups of peppermint tea, then slides back under the covers with Cas and manages to coax him into eating. They eat together, Castiel lying against Dean’s chest, and they get crumbs in the bed which would normally make both of them scowl. But today, anything goes. Then, when they’ve finished and both their plates are discarded on the floor, Castiel does something unthinkable. He turns in Dean’s arms and kisses him, and it’s all heat and sticky-sweetness and desperation, and Dean kisses back for a moment out of surprise before gently nudging Cas back and holding him there with a hand on his shoulder.
“But you hate the hospital,” she sniffles wetly down the phone. “I didn't want you to wake up and hate me even
“Cas.” Dean cups his chin and presses a kiss to his mouth, feeling his cheeks flush warmly. “You misunderstood me. Cause, I was kinda hoping you would be.”
“Oh, you won’t get hold of him.” She turns back into the house for a moment then reappears with a phone in her hand. It’s obviously Dean’s phone, although there’s a big crack down the screen that Sam doesn’t remember being there before. “He left his phone here. But I’ll let him know you dropped by.”
“Darling, there you are. I've been looking everywhere for you.”
“Oh god, Dean,” Castiel snuffles, sounding like he’s crying tears of laughter. “Dean Winchester. Your lines are cheesier than Doritos, I swear.”
“Yes. He’s taking the air with Ms. Cortese.”
“Cas, can I, uh.” He cradles his throbbing head in his hand, squeezing his eyes shut. He can't think straight. He just needs to be out, away from here, somewhere, anywhere else. “Can I come over? For a while? I just need…”
Then, deciding abruptly, he stands up and lunges for the doors, making it through just as they close. It's only a three-minute wait on the opposite platform, then he's on a train heading back into the sticky heat of the city, heading in the direction of Dean’s house. His brother can ignore calls from him, can ignore text messages from him, but he sure as hell won't close the door in Sam’s face. Not if he doesn't want that ass-kicking, anyway.
Gabriel’s voice can be heard from the opposite side of the hallway as Dean walks past the doorman, awkwardly adjusting his tie and wanting nothing more than to turn around and head straight back to the car and head in the general direction of home. Or The Roadhouse. Or anywhere really, anywhere that isn't here.
He licks her out until she comes, then she turns and impales herself on him, digging her nails into his chest and collarbone. His skin and eyes burn. It takes him a long time to come, his cock threatening to soften and slip from her as she berates him for his lack of stamina, for not arousing her enough, for not being as good in bed as he used to be. Every word is like a barb and he aches behind his ribs. It's over soon enough, but every moment seems too long. She showers, rinsing his release from her skin almost immediately. She can't stand the smell, she's told him before. It makes her gag.
“Dean?” Amara knocks softly on the bathroom door, making him start with shock. “Are you alright?”
“I love you too,” He parrots, marvelling at how easily the words leave his lips. They only sound a little bit mechanical as well. Not enough for her to notice. Within minutes she's asleep, breathing hotly against the back of his neck, twitching slightly as she succumbs to dreams.
“No. I’m not. And neither are you, though you seem determined to turn into him.” Sam straightens and takes a step back, adjusting his tie. “I’m going to change for dinner. I’ll meet you back here, don’t be late.” Or drunk, he thinks to himself as he strides away, glancing back once over his shoulder to see if Dean had decided to follow him.
“Sure you don’t.” Castiel sits back against Billie’s bed, stretching his legs out in front of him and rescuing his mug from the bedside table, a smirk at his lips. “It wasn’t obvious at all.”
Ah. Now things make a little more sense. Billie has been coming up with tall stories for a few weeks now, some of them funny and entertaining, and others not so much. And this sounds like one of the less amusing ones.
good at what he does. “You know what Dean’s like. Him and Amara, I don’t completely understand it either. But he loves her and we should probably respect that.”
Cas isn't well. Jimmy, above anyone else, knows that. And he's sat alone in his study night after night, wondering if he should call Dean and speak to him plainly about Cas’ mental state. It's clear to him that he’s depressed. He's pale, he’s lost some weight (although he's still solid muscle on his thighs and biceps), and he looks like he barely sleeps an hour a night. Frown lines have made their home between his brows and his fingernails are bitten down to the quick. But it doesn't appear to be visible to anyone else - Dean seems to carry on as though everything is fine, in spite of his shock on that awful night where it all went to hell. But the nightmares… Jimmy knows they're just a side effect from what's plaguing his brother, not the actual cause. Castiel is afraid. He's afraid of making a mistake in getting married, yet he's afraid of losing the man he loves if he speaks his mind. It all stems directly back to Cole, and Jimmy has wondered more than once if Castiel dealt with it all adequately at the time. It certainly doesn't seem like he did. Surely if he had, these old fears of being left alone with his children wouldn't be resurfacing during a time he's supposed to be so happy.
,” Sam hears her say, and looks back at the ship himself for clarification. In his opinion, it certainly does. He had never sailed on the RMS
Dean jumps. He doesn't mean to, but he's so lost in his own thoughts that he didn't hear Amara enter the room or walk up behind him. Her hands trail up his back to his shoulders and she presses her body into him. She's cold against his warm skin.
He gazes down vacantly at the beach outside. The weather has been almost unbearably hot even for this time of year, yet he's cold everywhere all the time. Dean has passed a couple of absent-minded comments about Cas being wrapped up in sweaters and cardigans while the rest of them are in summer clothing, but he dismisses it with a shrug and a smile. Castiel leans back against the counter and waits impatiently for the water to boil. The kids want to go to the beach tomorrow, he suddenly remembers. It's Saturday and they want to play in the water and build a sand castle. He can do that, they can all do that. He doesn't need to think about the day Lexie almost drowned yet again. He can relax and enjoy himself. He doesn't need to worry about the mounting pile of emails he needs to respond to either, or the fact that they still haven't settled on a date or location for their wedding. Or how the very thought of the wedding makes an anxious knot twist in his stomach. It's fine, it's all fine, he can worry about those things later... or never. That works too.
(See the end of the chapter for
“She got pulled into a double shift, two nurses called in sick. On Pride.” He shakes his head wryly. “They’re probably working up to their hangovers right now.”
“Well, Cassie, that isn’t what I was hoping to hear, but whatever floats your boat, I suppose.”
“His car is here.”
“Meg!” He groans, tipping his head back and covering his face with his hands. Her foot finds his, sans its stiletto heel, and moves slowly up his calf. “Not now.”
He replies to Gabe, telling him that they'll barbecue and that Castiel can stay over if he likes, that he can make up the guest room. After all, he wants to appear the gracious host - if only for an hour before he starts interrogating the older man for information, for anything he can work with to try and help his brother.
“The hell do you mean?”
“You pushed me through a glass door, Amara.” Even he's impressed by the coolness of his voice. It's in a sharp juxtaposition to the frantic hammering of his heart. “And then you just left.” It's then that his tone rises a little and a note of hysteria enters it. He has to clench his first to remind himself to stay quiet so he doesn't wake Cas. “You just
Dean feels pretty goddamn awkward. He’s pretty sure he’s going to be rejected - or worse, told to go fuck himself. Actually, that probably won’t happen. Cas doesn’t tend to swear much. But right now, he’s feeling uncertain of everything. He’s feeling skittish, unwelcome, and uncomfortable on every level.
. Even your brother offered you money. I'm tired of being with someone with no aspirations, no financial stability, no future. I want more than this!”
In a gesture that he hopes will seem gallant to onlookers, he offers his arm to Ruby who takes it with a saccharine smile, lowering her lashes in a faux display of coyness. She’s in a smartly tailored black suit, blouse buttoned up to the throat and adorned with a jewelled clasp. There’s a fascinator nestled in her dark hair which offers up a thin layer of black lace which covers one side of her face down to her jewel-red lips. Her dark hair is in ringlets and she’s wearing a very familiar scent. Jack averts his eyes. Behind them, Dean clears his throat. Sam lifts his chin in confident defiance of their judgements, staring up at the ship bound for New York, taking them back to the life he’s rapidly growing to love. He’s found his place in the world, he’s sure of it. He’s found the people he belongs with, and nothing is ever going to take that away.
