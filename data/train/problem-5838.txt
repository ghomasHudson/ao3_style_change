"What?" Peter said. "I saw you from up on the stairs, the way you were fumbling your way around each other as if you haven't saved each other's life a dozen times that I know of." He paused. "It's him, right?"
Richards gave him a speculative look. "Can you keep a secret? C'mon, I'll show you something if you promise not to try and reverse engineer it."
"I just don't understand you," Tony intercepted me before I could open my mouth, and that was the last spur I needed.
It was the sudden tension in his body, so close to my own, that clued me in: I'd actually been speaking aloud.
I closed my eyes and sighed. "I know you loved your Steve. Or, well – you loved each other. Me and my Tony... we just weren't like that."
Steve looked him full in the face. “No, I...” he stated earnestly, before his voice hitched to a halt. He took a deep shuddering breath. Gave Tony an intense, meaningful look, imploring him to understand. Tugged at Tony’s belt, almost helplessly. Then: “You too,” he managed.
living in your own muck, being fed through a tube and experimented on. That was what it felt like, being here, all of a sudden working as an engineering technician on the gunstar
Despite the distortion over the speakers, Nick Fury's voice was unmistakable, as it boomed over their heads, over the houses and fields, over horses and pigs and people alike; and then, as everyone around him started dropping to the ground, arms raised high in the air (because people can't follow simple instructions), hands protectively covering eyes and, in only a few cases, hands behind heads, Tony watched naked fear conquer the faces around him. He found himself on his feet, however, whooping and dancing, dancing and whooping in the dirt, because
I could cut my tethers and stay there, stretching on forever. But thinking about that was just a moment's indulgence.
incident warmed him through – with all that, his words are such a lie he almost expects to be struck down by lightning. Or at least for the lights in the elevator to short out.
, Steve thinks. It's not so much the thickness itself. If he bunched them together, they aren't that much thicker than a cock, maybe, coming to think about it. But it feels vastly different when it's hard and made of metal. And still,
, Tony was going to tell him, as another thud resounded, and this time the door almost gave way. Instead, he just leaned in and pressed his lips to Steve's briefly, sweetly, and it wasn't exactly Christmas, and the cobwebs hanging low above them weren't exactly mistletoe, but sometimes you have to make do. The fleeting touch of lips against lips was all he had the time for, and within it he tried to convey everything he thought or felt or wanted to say. The kiss was warm and tired and heartfelt, and he thought he felt Steve's lips pressing back against his, but it could have been just Steve trying to say
Which – if Steve had been in a fight (and Tony could hardly imagine Steve getting taken without a fight), it would be understandable. Still, it would take quite a beating. And then, after something like that, the man threw himself through a wooden door and a brick wall, because that made perfect sense. Right. Involuntarily, Tony shuddered.
Steve nodded, but still stole a worried look at his companion not two heartbeats later. Tony caught it. Grinned reassuringly. “Look, Cap. I’ve absolutely no wish to end up hurt. I’d...”
"But, we're pilots," Cap went on. "Like it or not, Stark, people look up to us. And the situation being as it is – it's actually important, right now. We need to present a united front. No shows of disrespect. No insubordination." Rogers paused. "I know you already know all this."
Steve snorted in irritation. "For your foot. They're not a compression wrap exactly, but if you put both of them on over your own sock, it would be firmer. Help the swelling go down." He was still whispering, and it made the conversation seem almost intimate. Of course, the fact that they were pressed against each other under the blankets probably also helped.
Tony: why don't you go talk to HER insead? maybe she can fix your fucking head so you don't have to bother ME any longer
Steve hesitates, bites his lower lip for a second. The sight is doing evil things to Tony's insides. "I'd..." the blond begins, stops.
Tony: did you think about how much you were going to miss me while your tiny disbalanced friend tried to crush me by piling literal TONS of cars on top of me
"Uh," Tony began, fighting all the while for his lips not to twitch into a probably-inappropriate smirk. "About last night. I'm...", he felt his lips stretch into a grin out of pure tension – and gave up. Suddenly he wondered why he cared this much, why he was being so anxious. He'd dealt with a lot worse in his time. With men much more powerful. Men who held fate of whole colonies in their hands. Tony'd be able to stare them down without a blink.
First he laughed out. It was a bit too explosive, and sounded almost painful. "Me? Nah."  I felt bad for being happy to hear that. What kind of person was I?
He must have read something in Tony’s face, though, because he stopped instantly. Gave Tony an almost scared look. A questioning grunt. He leaned on his elbow and tried to bend down, despite the awkward angle, caressing, stroking gently, crooning at him. But in what seemed to Tony no longer than an instant, the pain abated, leaving just a searing, desperate need inside, to feel Steve deeper, harder,
Steve has got the gauntlet, and the world stops. It keeps stopping for him a lot, lately. It barely even manages to move, honestly; it's got no reason to, now.
Tony shrugged. "I don't know. Not tomorrow, we have plans for tomorrow. If the weather lets up, that is." He snatched another strawberry Santa. "Tomorrow we are going to a theme park and out to eat – all three of us, that's going to be fun, yay –  and then she's going with Pepper to visit her family for a few days. Everything is arranged already, Morgan is looking forward to meeting her cousins and their numerous pets..." He shrugged, pretending he was cool with all that when he obviously wasn't too happy about it. He sounded as if he'd been trying to convince himself. "You don't change plans on kids."
Later that day, seemingly out of the blue, Tony said: "He loved you, by the way. In case you had any doubts. He
But no, the time didn't slow down. Some of the last guests lingered to watch – the two of them, always a spectacle, whether they were fighting or making up. Still, the people had mostly left, and now it was only their closest friends and teammates, waiting for them. There were cries of "Now, really? As if they didn't have the whole evening," and "Hush, Barnes," and "No, seriously, I can never figure out if they like or dislike each other," and "Let me quote facebook for you, Scott: It's complicated," and "They love each other, really," and "I'm telling you, it's Kyrumption!".
"That's Morgan," I said quietly when he finally raised his eyes to look at me. Calling them misty would have been an understatement. I had a stone in my chest and all I wanted was to go to him, hold him, but I didn't think it was me he wanted. "Morguna," I went on. "My Tony used to call her that. That's how she pronounced it when she first started talking..." My Tony had told me that  story during one of the short breaks in planning and plotting, after he finally came back to the Compound. At that point, I'd wished I could pack him up and just send him back to his family, everything else be damned. But we needed him and, in the end, he'd made his choice.
He didn't need to say it, though. Tony knew. He'd seen Steve come through the gate, with a stupid duffel bag slung over his shoulder, saw the way Steve looked around the Compound grounds with naked longing on his face. Heard it in his voice too, when Steve saw his old office, exactly the same as the day he left, the artwork and everything. At first, keeping it the way it had been was Tony's way of torturing himself, and then it was a conscious decision to preserve memories. And now, seeing the longing in Steve's eyes, he was glad he did, and decided he was going to fix everything again, make everything work or he'd be damned. Steve would have everything he loved back.
"I dress up in it every night," Tony said lightly. "That was the reason Pepper divorced me, actually."
"Yeah," he said sardonically, "you are right, because I'd absolutely sacrifice you in order to get myself out."
sounded a bit out of breath, which was... weird. For a moment Tony thought Steve was going to examine the masonry, but in the end he just leaned against it.
his feelings were ridiculous, coming to think of it. This was happening too fast. It would be over before it began. What business did he have, getting jealous?
But here it was now. An opening. Maybe they could try that uncanny talking-to-each-other thing again. They didn't have to even be on good
When it's finally their turn to check-in, they produce their IDs. With that beard and those glasses, Steve can actually – sort of – pass for a Stephán, but Tony is honestly going to murder Fury on account of his own ID. Stephán Deleon and Tino Stirling. Dentists extraordinaire.
Tony: See, even when you're depressed, you still know how to put a more positive spin on things than me!
The onset of drowsiness ambushed him and pummeled him down. All resistance was futile. He could barely hold his eyes open, and his thoughts were starting to wander uncontrollably. It was as bad as the last time he’d taken the stim, he’d have sworn it under oath, all the research funds down the drain, with the rain (pretty rain), all for nothing, the effect on him hadn’t improved at all, but here was Steve, and they should have gone to Malibu instead, Steve would have liked Malibu, with the warm sand and the sun and everything, not this time of year, though, obviously, but... And Tony knew he was drifting away, but he didn’t let go of Steve; that was the one thought he held firm in his mind.
He looks up sharply at that, and then suddenly he's at my side. "Darling, no," he says, and he sounds distressed, and also he's never ever called me anything but Steve or Cap or Big Man before. "That's not what I meant at all."
worrying about that? Another sweeping look around, this time more assessing than appreciative. "Can I help somehow?" Because it was Steve, ever helpful; and yes, obviously, you couldn't have top level corporate people in a place like this, that was painfully clear. Luckily:
Tony: Christ, Steve you have to tell me those things. I’m not best at reading cues. If you ever need me, just tell me. Even if we are at odds. Even if we're not speaking. I’ll come.
He limped and hopped over to his blanket, picked it up to protect his head, his face. Then he went over and stood in the left hand corner by the cell door, where the possible flying debris was least likely to get to him.
Tablecloth. Think about the tablecloth, the one with Christmassy puppies; Morgan adored it. It was, however, a ridiculous things for two adult people to be having dinner on. Thank god Steve was here, though. Look at all this food. Imagine if Tony'd been alone; it would have been so depressive. But right now... it wasn't. He felt as far from depressed as he could get, and not just because he had company, but because it was
Too many feelings at once always make me want to step up and issue a challenge – to someone, to anyone, to the universe at large.
He wants to wrap his arms around Steve, to help him up, whisper all sorts of soft nonsense into his ear. He wants to touch him, pet him, kiss him everywhere. Tell him how wonderful he's been, tell him how much he loves him.
“Some would say that’s not overly safe either.” And: “What do you want me to do, Cap, go down that beginners’ trail and run into all the people I’ve been avoiding for two days?”
Tony's laughter reverberated through Steve's stomach. "Old people problems, then," Tony concluded. The sweet warmth of hope that was spreading through Steve's face was probably, he thought, unwarranted.
Tony felt an unwelcome warmth start to rise in his stomach at the praise. It seemed like such a long time since Steve had said anything nice to him.
“It’s like... No.” Tony thought for a moment. “It’s like, I get scared that I’ll panic. Like, I know I tend to panic in situations like that and...”
What can I say about our marriage? It was my life, and how can you look back on your life and be objective in any way? I was 38 when I came to be with Tony. Our marriage lasted longer than all the rest of my life put together.
He stopped. (The song was drawing to a close anyway.) He took the ear-bud out, held it out to Peter. "I can't," he said simply.
"Oh, don't give away his bunk yet, Chief, he'll be back in no time," someone called out, and Tony didn't have to look back. It was Hammer, it was always Hammer. "He was kicked out of the pilot academy after only two months, did you know?" he informed the room at large. All around, the ears were pricking; a good piece of gossip was always appreciated.
"Look, Tony, it's not... I heal really fast. I'll be fine." Steve didn't sound annoyed, though. A bit stubborn, maybe. He was staring at his lap. And when he looked up at Tony, for just one bright second, his eyes were smiling warmly, even though his lips were controlled. Then he looked back down. Tony could live off that look for days, if he let himself be pathetic.
Peter shrugged. "Oh, you know, I didn't want to marry you or anything Just thought we could have a bit of fun before I go." And then, after a second's thought. "
Tony: That's comparably little. You need more firepower. But I do think not using Wanda is kind of the right idea.
Tony: You know, I can build a suit of armor in a fucking cave with like two pots, a pan, and a sharp stick, but I still have no idea how you can go and turn a piece of paper into art with just a pencil.
"No, but I'm fine," he said quickly – too quickly, apparently, if one could judge by the narrowing of the medic's eyes. "I wasn't even here. I wasn't
, he mused – and gave up. "I already did borrow one. I'll go get it." He hoped he didn't sound too eager, but in the end, there was no helping that, he supposed.
"Oh please," she says. "If you actually considered us family, you would avoid us like plague all year, but then you would show up around the holidays to get wasted and pick a fight with everyone."
“Skiing,” Tony repeated, tossing the word over his shoulder like a bone, forcing his most offhanded manner, “a nice day for it.” He waved towards Steve’s skis in the corner. He’d ventured another expedition into the kitchen, rescued two plates from an acute case of frostbite.
Tony: Listen, I'm looking into stuff right now. This IS being shut down, Steve, this story. Big time. I found a directive from the top level. Okay, this is infuriating. Okay, I'm so going to fuck with this, you've no idea.
him, and what he was finding out seemed to be a really mixed bag. Or an incomprehensible tangle. (A tangle was probably a better comparison.) Still, somehow, Steve wanted to know more.
(Tony wanted one too!). He looked super-awkward. "Thank you for breakfast, it smells wonderful." Steve murmured his own appreciation too; right at that moment, Tony had eyes only for him. Steve himself, however, seemed to divide his attention between the other two equally. Now that he was so close, Tony was getting little echoes off him all the time. Steve was drinking in both their presences, and while on one hand he seemed to be saying 'wow, you're really here, you're sitting next to me', he also seemed to be thinking: 'wow, you're not dead!' at the boy, and it was almost as intense. Steve had
“Not this fast.” It’d been only a few hours. The effects should last for at least 10 or 12. And yet, Tony couldn’t help but remember the one time he’d taken it before, when he’d crashed pretty badly afterwards. He was pretty sure Steve remembered that too. But that was an older generation of the substance, it’d been improved significantly since. Still: “The moment I feel anything weird, I’ll let you know, okay? I won’t act tough, Cap. I’ll let you bridal-carry me to the nearest patrol station if I have to.” He shot Steve a grin. ”I might even enjoy it.”
And there was a pang of regret again, at all the hurry, all the frantic grabbing and biting and digging nails into skin. He straightened, pulled out. Wondered why he didn't think to steal some tissues while he was about stealing lube. Pack it in, he told himself. Pack it in, and cut your heart out, and just walk away. Else, you fall apart. But he couldn't resist the one last look. Steve still hadn't moved, he just stood there, hands against the wall, breathing and dripping. The curve of his back was so near and somehow sad. And – just one last touch then, Tony thought, as he let his hand caress him softly, all the way up the spine, lingering, stroking with his thumb, softly, slowly. And he thought
Tony rolled his eyes. "You can't pull that thing out in my presence. It literally hurts to look at it."
It's getting undeniably obnoxious. Tony can see even Steve is getting annoyed at the woman. "Oh," Tony says placatingly, planning a decent excuse, but an unruly impulse stirs him in another direction, and the words that actually escape his mouth are: "You see, Hottie McNaughty here is a real crabapple. He dislikes public displays of affection." He even manages to sound whiny on top of everything. Just like he imagines a Tino Stirling would. Really, sometimes he surprises even himself.
She cocked her head and poured him his coffee without further ado. It usually took him longer to extract some. She seemed mildly disappointed that he was disinclined to play.
"Er..." Steve hesitated. Shrugged. "Found them in the kitchen. They're fresh." He had no idea what to do with himself now that he was here.
. Now, I posted it as a separate fic because it's E-rated, and I didn't want that one scene to raise the rating of the whole fic. Also, it's not in texts, just regular prose, so it wouldn't fit the format.
Tony is studying the picture without saying anything. Then he passes it back to me. "I'm not him," he says. "Sorry, Steve. Can't help you there. I can't be that for you." He sounds more guarded now, and it's difficult to believe I'm going through this whole thing again. I didn't come here so he could take the place of my dead husband. No one can do that, not in a million years, not even his alter ego from a different timeline.
On that one occasion, when everyone else had gone to bed, he and Tony had sat and talked about public appearances – it was one of the rare occasions they didn't bicker or tease. And – although it was hard to believe, now, that he had once had that kind of easy conversations with Tony – Steve had said how he had been nervous at first, when he went traveling with his show, way back when; but one of the dancers had taught him to look about half a foot above the heads of the audience, and no one could ever figure it out, no one would notice; and he could pretend none of them were there. Tony, on the other hand, had a trick to pick a series of random people in the audience, unknown people, to look them straight in the eye and smile, almost flirtingly, as if that person was the most important man or woman in the whole world. And then to switch to the next one, and so on.
Steve shrugged, a little belligerently. "I don't know," he said. "Together. I'm still working on the details."
Tony: Listen, yeah, a part of me was afraid you were going to think I was selling out for power or position or whatever.
"Yeah, but I mean, it takes time, and it's not just that. You made roast. You made tiny tacos and meatballs and dips and everything, and the cinnamon rolls dough, you..."
Steve was on the run, sure, but Tony could probably help him, get his hands on false IDs and things for him. Find him a better hiding place. At least he had plenty of resources. And – Tony knew with a sudden certainty, and his heart fell – Steve would probably never accept any of it. That was why he'd run away from SHIELD – to escape all the ties, to be free, to live his own life, anonymously, and make his own choices for once.
"I always miss you, Tony," Steve says, and there, see, that's how it's done; it's possible to put that into words. Steve's tongue certainly didn't fall off.
Steve had at least stopped shivering audibly. Tony hoped he was asleep at last. To be fair, the man probably needed his rest. For Steve to admit he was tired at all? He must be absolutely depleted.
A noncommittal huff. “You said: ‘You should come over to Malibu sometimes, Cap. Shoot some pool, go for a swim. How about the next weekend?” His Tony-voice wasn’t half so bad, actually.
Periods of panic now alternated with non-caring, almost zen-like existence: the second state was much scarier. He wondered if this was what quiet slippage into insanity felt like.
Tony: First of all, don't you compare me with Lang, dammit. I left no trail and I sure as hell haven't been caught in the act. The way I transferred the data to Christine also left no trail. I MYSELF couldn't find any trace of it, and I'm WAY better than the Feds at it, and you'll just have to trust me. If there was someone better, I'd KNOW of it.
"What do you mean?" Steve asks. He's staring forward again, but at least he's talking to Tony. He isn't showing any intention of getting up, and as much as Tony would like to get over the railing and sit next to him, he feels like he would be intruding.
He was acutely aware of Rogers, just inches away, holding onto his handle. He heard a tiny gasp as he turned the faux flyer to the right, then ninety degrees upwards, then overhead, performing a near perfect somersault – ending up on the virtual enemy's tale. He released a round of ammo. He knew these moves well, although they had yet to sink into his bones.
Tony'd always wanted children. I'm not sure if he even knew it, consciously, before we first visited Clint's farm, that long-ago day in 2015. But I still remember the fierce wistfulness in his eyes. They seemed to say:
"If you're going to fall apart, please do it in your spare time?" Darryl said impassively. "We have a lot of work to do."
I wanted to say, but in the end I said nothing. Wordlessly, I took a handful of photos from my wallet and passed them to her.
Peter seemed intent on this line of inquiry. "So, have you told him? No, of course you haven't, have you."
Steve's limbs had turned to stone, but now the life seemed to be trickling back. He took a step towards Tony. Tentatively, he reached up, touched Tony's unshaven cheek with his index finger, light as a feather.
Because it was true, all of it, insomuch that Tony had dreamed of Steve dreaming about it. Repeatedly. Sometimes it was Peter taking a bullet for Steve, but Tony had a feeling that wasn't the one that worried Steve so much. In that one Peter looked different, older, and Steve did go on blaming himself afterwards, but...
Coming to, with Tony's warm, taut limbs wrapped around him seemed like a dream, so much so that Steve kept thinking it
He apparently decided to drown his feelings with words. No one was surprised. "Steve? Do you believe all that bullshit, by the way – grief and doom? What's it supposed to mean anyway? It sounds like a couple of second-rate villains – Mr. Doom and Dr Grief." He was obviously babbling in order to hide his own Dr Grief, but I smiled nevertheless.
Casually, Steve had asked if it was okay to store the skis here, and Tony had agreed with an even more casual shrug. He could outcasual you any day. At this latest question, Tony looked at him as if he had no idea why in the world this was being discussed at all. “I’ll
made me wonder if, around here, perhaps it hadn't been such a big deal. maybe we were possibly just better at sorting it out. Maybe we even managed to talk about it once or twice.
Tony's voice was muffled over the comm. His constant companion. Steve didn't mind one bit. He was now helping clear the wreckage, carefully, so that the precarious balance wouldn't shift and possible survivors underneath end up crushed. For the tenth time that day, he regretted not bringing more people with him, not calling in the marines, anything. But – the time had been so scarce and they hadn't known what was going on.
He knew he wasn't really skilled with words. Braced for the likely outcome, he left the message. Already, he missed so many people in his life; he knew what to do with that, it was almost a special skill set. Loss was an old friend. He could wrap himself in it, keep it close to his heart and make it his armor. It wouldn't be the first time.
Tony: It's probably a good thing that you're going on a date. Get out of the house, see the world. Seriously. It's probably very healthy.
When Tony died, I'd stopped smiling, but yesterday and today I realized the necessary muscles were still in a working order.
sit down, and that came as a surprise, even to him. "Okay," he said. And: "Tony, what are you doing?"
to. You took some remedial classes. You worked harder. You tried again. That was that. The pool of possible cadets was very limited, and their own sad bunch was crème de la crème.
Steve sighed. "I'm fine." And then, before Tony had the time to start towards his mount again: "How come you're here?"
I didn't think I had the stomach to do it. So I happened to be talking with the Ancient One, and somehow she jumped on board of the
In his wicking pants and a fleece sweatshirt, Steve felt strangely naked. This was ridiculous, he realized; Tony had seen him in his undersuit a million times. And he sort of avoided looking at Steve too much anyway, as he pointed stuff out around the cottage from his blanket fortress on the couch.
Tony came to in a pile of warmth. He knew he’d been asleep, but it took him a moment to remember where he was, and
Tony couldn't say he exactly disliked Captain Rogers. The man didn't seem malicious or abusive or particularly ill-tempered, and he was certainly not a pain to look at. He was, Tony mused, kind of sour, though, uptight, maybe a little boring; none of these qualities were unforgivable, but Tony found the guy irksome all the same.
As a result of all this, as far as I could see, the universe had more lose ends than a sweater Wanda once tried to knit. (Don't ask.)
Tony's eyes had met hers over the distance, and she seemingly tried to tell him something with that look, although he had not the slightest idea what.
Steve didn't back down. "I mean why. Why do you need the serum suppressant?" He did the reproachful eyebrows thing. Tony hated the reproachful eyebrows thing.
Tony: But he's mainly angry because I didn't consult him on anything, said he coulda helped make this safer and less chaotic. Which, in retrospect, is probably true.
Emotions hit unexpectedly. Tony swallows them. "It counts," he concedes quietly. His voice is thick. He'd think it was a dead giveaway, but Steve just goes on, too fired up to notice, perhaps.
"Be silent," Tony tells him sharply instead, "when I want your opinion, I'll ask." Because it's all about the game, the performance, the attitude, and the other man is responding so nicely to verbal domination play. Steve inhales sharply and bites his lower lip. Gives Tony an incredibly hot look. His eyes are big, blown wide; impossibly pretty. (Tony would kiss both his eyelids. If he were allowed to.)
, some things are deemed probable to cause panic. Even before that, when I worked for SHIELD, this was taken care of by a whole another department, which, in a government agency is a whole another country, practically.
They stayed like that for a time, in silence, reading by the light of Tony's gauntlet, but Steve could barely concentrate.
"And a plain triple cheese omelet for my super-scientist son, because he doesn’t like cilantro," Tony said indulgently, before taking his place at the breakfast table.
Having apparently assured himself that Tony wasn't broken, he turned away abruptly. "We should hurry. I'm going to try to kick the door down."
, he thought, because it seemed so long ago, before he'd discovered even the faint trace of feelings for Steve. And now there was something brewing between them, and he wasn't sure he wanted it to brew to completion, whatever it was, but oh, he wanted to sneak a peek and see if Steve was
Peter put the mp3 player away, gave Tony a wry smile. "And here I thought it was going so well." He didn't sound particularly put out by this development, however. "You okay there?"
Captain caught onto him soon enough. He learned not to react, he learned to just look on – politely, inquisitively – intently listening to the explanations he already knew like the back of his hand.
“No, but you seemed...” Steve thought for a moment, as if every word mattered. (It did.) “You seemed so
"Why aren't you in the car already? Get in the car," Tony semi-snapped. You'll freeze to death, he didn't say, you'll freeze to death and it will be my fault. Asshole.
"Diverging timelines?" It's not even a real question. He's figured it out at once, he was just too shocked to say anything.
Tony: Also, I'm in a bit of a happy-ish place, I think. I want to send you a shitton of stuff right now. Don't dare, though. Might be tracked. So none of that for now.
He barely made it into the corridor. When he heard the footsteps behind him, it was already too late. Steve was catching up with him.
Staring at Steve from a distance, he found himself overcome with a strange reluctance. He didn't need to go over, talk to him, did he? The medic was busy; Tony'd just be in the way, wouldn't he? And what could he say to Steve?
. Tony'd seen him do it to other cadets on numerous occasions – hands on shoulders, even comforting pats on hands if someone couldn't complete an assignment or got panicky about the whole world-as-we-know-it-is-probably-dead-and-I'm-supposed-to-fight-the-scary-machines-that-did-it-??? issue. (Everyone got a bout of that from time to time, it was normal.)
Was it really possible that, after working with them for two months, he still didn't know their names? Steve was mildly appalled. Stark's mocking
Tony: And I'm wondering if you, you know, feel the effects of depression more intensely than an unenhanced person would. Your selective sensory enhancement and all that. What does it entail?
"All right then," Steve agreed. "I hope he tests out well." And he meant it too, for the first time since he entered Fury's office. Because the third thing in short supply in their ragtag, mish-mash band of survivors, was any real talent. In his mind, Steve ran through the test results of the cadets he'd already accepted into the program. Teachability was the best you could hope for in most cases.
Skiing was the first time Tony, as a kid, had experienced something akin to flying. He remembered it vividly – how he’d left the expensive instructor to glare after him open-mouthed, his sentence unfinished, as Tony took off downslope, in and out of the powdery snow like a dolphin.
of the hole she left when she went her own way, and it hurts, but even if the two of you can't figure things out, you are fond of that hole and that hurt she left behind because they tell you she's once been there, and that means to you more than you can say.
I spot Morgan first. The familiar face, two decades or so older, just jumps at me out of a hundred small scenes around me.
He wriggled out of Steve’s embrace, just a bit, so that he could look him in the face, see him nod once. The fragile, raw fondness there.
Okay, maybe I'm wrong. I was, after all, the one insisting we weren't the same people across the timelines. Maybe his Steve had been indifferent, like he seemed to think. Still, it would be easier to believe just about
In the end, Steve doesn't know what to think, he keeps going in circles. What he knows is, he has to talk to Tony. See what follows from there.
"Wait," Steve said. "I'm going to send you help. They'll bring the parts. The way is clear now. I'll try to lend a hand here."
and I choose to believe you've been given back to me, somehow, because otherwise..." He took a deep breath. I knew Tony's face. I knew it was about to crumple, and I knew he was not going to allow it, and if he couldn't stop it, he was going to resent me just a little for seeing it. I took too big a bite, then started fishing about for a napkin, to give him a chance to get himself together. He shot me a grateful look. "Otherwise," he went on after a second, "I could as well be in the corner, crying into my falafel all over again." He said it lightly, in that way he had when he wanted to tell the truth and also to pass it off as a joke. I didn't know what to say, so I didn't say anything. I just ran my fingers through my hair. I wanted to take his hand, but I wasn't sure if he would appreciate that.
"Do you feel this at all?" Tony asked quietly. And, he lay one hand against Steve's chest, and the other on his waist; and never looking away from Steve's eyes, Tony pushed all the warmth and kindness and joy and, yes, well, he had to say it at some point at least in the privacy of his head, love – he pushed it all towards Steve, he opened himself as much as he could and he
As they carried the trays of food to the small dining table in the living room, he could still feel Steve's big, warm hands on his waist, like the image of the sun superimposed on your closed eyelids.
Ten days, Tony thought. Ten days in captivity. It wasn't even that long. It felt like weeks. Months, almost. It felt like time stopped existing altogether.
Was he going to discover a way to go back to my timeline? I had no idea. I doubted it, but then again, he solved the last unsolvable problem too. Did I root for him to succeed? I wasn't sure. I thought it was courting disaster, but Tony and disaster had had a long and painful courtship, and sometimes one came out on top, and sometimes the other. I felt stretched thin and very old at that moment, like people in their 30s sometimes do, and I didn't know anything for sure any longer. No, scratch that. I knew
"I'm okay," he said tersely. Then he turned the extinguisher on and waded deeper into the area of dancing blue and green flames, flashing through the smoke like big, ghostly suns.
After they finally put an overexcited and overtired Morgan to bed, Tony is out of there like a lightning, before Pepper can offer him a cup of coffee out of politeness or habit, just because that's what they always used to do. Touch base at the end of the day. That used to be the highlight of his evening, the few moments when he finally relaxed and recharged his batteries, because having a child is an exhausting full-time job, but having Pepper there made it easier, at least at first. But gradually, invisibly, the ritual became something that would only drain him further, at best. They kept at it because Pepper thought it meant so much to him, and he thought it meant so much to Pepper.
Bruce is still not out of his green phase, and Tony sometimes misses his human face, but he at least talks to Bruce semi-regularly.
A muffled hubbub came from the outside –  from the other end of the corridor, most likely, where he and Steve had left a nasty surprise for the pursuers. The bad guys will find in a minute or so... almost there... it should be sometime around now...
The sudden nakedness didn't seem to perturb Steve in the least. He made half a step to the left, guiding a very willing Tony to lean back against the bricks next to the fireplace. "What I want is to get you to bed and keep you
Tony: After all of this dies down a tad, will you send me your blood and urine samples to tinker with?
it. He loved it far more than he should have, he thought. He'd stared at it for hours, knew every turn of the line by heart. Well, okay, maybe it was a form of self-torment, but he did what he needed to do, that was all. And every drawing, every sketch screamed at him with its unfulfilled potential. The fact that Steve might not get a chance to mature into his artistic potential now filled Tony with a rage so muted and frigid it could easily hold for years. Centuries. Self-sustainable anger. You never needed to renew it or recharge it, honest. It could just fuel you indefinitely. This was unforgivable. Someone was going to burn for it.
It took almost a minute for the song to actually start, and it took Tony a few more seconds to recognize it. It was one of the hits that you heard everywhere, and then, two or three years later, everyone forgot about them.
?" she asks the room at large, and this is getting very uncomfortable, very fast. All the eyes are plastered on them, just the way it's definitely not supposed to happen on a secret mission.
after the last refurbishment. He was looking at the somewhat familiar features in the file he had just been handed.
He squeezes the words out; they cost him a lot. That's why it's even more irritating when Steve cuts in.
Steve gives him a look that would have been hurt, if not for all the resignation that suffuses it. "Have it your way, Tony. I considered you a friend."
Was that a faint trace of hurt in his voice or was Tony imagining it? And Tony knew he wasn't being fair. Steve had been nothing if not, well, sweet to him this whole time. Perhaps that was what all the sadness after the snap did to Steve – made him less full of expectations, less uptight about it, and thus gentler. Tony himself had changed too. They all had. Or maybe Steve had always been like this; maybe it was just Tony that saw him with different eyes now. In any case, it was unfair to keep having these unfinished arguments with the old Steve in his head.
But, apart from a certain amused dryness in his response, nothing seemed out of order. “What, this time of year?” Steve asked.
Steve just shrugged: "I can manage for a few minutes." And: "Thank you for being honest, Tony, really. There's something I need to tell you as well. I was going to come back and tell you, actually. It just didn't feel right to leave without..."
couch, considerably more entangled and less dressed than ever before, "I never said it, but I love you too."
There were a hundred things he would have normally done in a situation like this. A scorching look through lowered lashes, a corner of his mouth dancing slightly, a slow, deliberate caress of thumb over Steve’s wrist, over his pulse. But all of that seemed inadequate, and almost like a betrayal.
He couldn't say he even liked Stark, as such. He definitely wasn't a one for whirlwind romances. He'd had two serious relationships in his life, both over for some time now. He had grown into both relationships steadily, gradually. He'd known both Peggy and Bucky well. No – an understatement, right there – he'd known Bucky all his life and he'd went to school with Peggy, been friends with her for – well – years, before anything happened for real. But – no. No thinking about Bucky and Peggy tonight. He'd do it some other night, when he felt a distinct, self-destructive urge to quietly disintegrate on the inside. For now, he had to keep it together by keeping hope alive– forcibly – and imagining that they were alive and well, somewhere out there, in the great expanse of space. That was it. The other options were unbearable.
Tony: Do you have a handler? I mean, who are you consulting with about the missions, who gets you information?
He stepped forward, and Tony didn't step back, didn't pull away. Steve reached up, shy and gentle, touching Tony's hips again, his back. Tony
what scenarios he was construing in his head. In that, we are similar. I needed to tell him the truth before this misunderstanding got even more out of hand.
Tony: I'll send you a memo next time. Anyway, the point is, I'm fucked up, is all. Long before this. So, not your fault. I'm sorry I said it. I was being an asshole.
The couple moved on, finding the topic decidedly uninteresting. The sound of violins, as well as the waves of laughter, were jarring to Tony, verging on unbearable. He needed to capture them and repurpose them and use them to his own advantage. The violins. The laughter. Everything.
Which was when Steve’s hand found its way into Tony’s hair again, his fingers moving slowly back and forth. His words were filled with an odd, stifled tenderness. “It mattered to
“I took a Cortolan shot this morning.” He shrugged defensively. “So that’s that, it’s done already. Hate to see it go to waste.”
The awkwardness was like a blazing physical pain. And while there was this one part of Tony that couldn't help but think that Steve simply didn't want to talk to him, another part of him had to notice, had to see how intensely Steve was looking at him, how his voice was a little strangled, how he seemed to be floundering for words too.
Yep. That's going to be the title of his second memoir. Fucking Walmart! It wouldn't be that noticeable if the cut of the jeans was better!
"It's going to be boring without you," he heard himself say, the ache and affection indelibly tangled inside him, and regretted it while the words were still ringing in the air.
with Tony and what was the matter with all the mixed signals? He needed his signals seriously straightened out.
A sigh. "Hi, Cap." In the two short words, he could hear arrant weariness that had been absent from Tony's earlier messages and especially from Tony's public appearances. There was something genuine about it now. Too tired to pretend. "How's it going?"
, Tony." God, he sounded as if they'd known each other in ages, and in a way that was true. At least Tony knew him. Even though he was nothing like Howard's stories or history book descriptions, so technically he didn't know him at all.
, although he claimed to have gained some minor knowledge of joint dislocation during the war. And yet, and
And there I was, already missing him even though he was right there, in front of me, his voice hoarse from all the yelling. Rapidly, the fight went out of me all at once, and I was left, just standing there, looking at him with sadness. Everything had just turned around, and all I wanted was to take him in my arms. I couldn't, he wouldn't want me to. So I just stood there and let him have it at me until he was done.
"You know," he said conversationally a moment later. "I'm going to tear this place to the ground. I don't know where exactly it is or what it is, but I'm going to fucking tear it apart stone for stone. Oh," he added lightly, "and if anything's left, I'm going to burn it to ashes."
Tony: Sry, I'm just really, really tired and I'm fed up with everything. The last straw and all that.
. And the way he bit his lower lip, holy hell. Tony knew he was supposed to say something, step back and try to
"Hey, I got some tools from a locker," Tony's voice said in his ear. And right, of course, the tools, why did Steve not even think of that? Of course he couldn't repair the damage with his bare hands.
different. It's really obvious only now. Of course he would be different after a lifetime spent with one person or another, even if there weren't for other variables we can't know anything about. We change each other. Thank god for that. Still, he is still Tony, my Tony,
I shook my head. No, I hadn't been tempted. Not because I'm a paragon of virtue or anything, but because...
First impressions weren't so important, though, were they? Tony could handle a flyer craft like a dream. He'd done his share of flying under bridges and slipping through canyons sideways and racing up and down the cliffs on Gamenon, and all the other stunts no one in their right mind would try. Rich and bored, newspapers had dubbed him, but although he'd grin brilliantly, and nod, and
Tony let the tablet fall beside him, propped himself up on one elbow. He blinked at Steve a few times, sighed, shook his head. "All right, Cap," he muttered. "All right."
?" He must have seen something in my face, then, because he leaned forward, touched my hand. "Hey." Even amidst all this, I relished the intimacy. This... just this could be enough for me, just an occasional touch and I could be happy. I wasn't going to pressure this Tony, or myself, for anything more. I just wanted to get to know him, if he let me, and maybe offer him something that I dubbed 'tender friendship' in my head. What I wished I'd thought to offer my own Tony earlier. "Hey, bug guy, you all right?"
The device was too big to carry around. Hope hurting in his chest, Tony pressed the series of buttons. The buzz of connection rumbled in his bones as he repeated the coordinates over and over again. For the first time in years, though, there was a chance that the signal might reach far enough.
Steve peered inside. He'd heard the guy finish his phone call as if nothing out of the ordinary was happening, and then – thanks to his night vision – he found himself face to face with Tony Stark.
His movements very precise and deliberate, he let go of the blanket, now wrapped warmly around Steve's shoulders, and took a step back. For a moment he allowed himself to admire his handiwork. Then he remembered he had more pressing business to attend to.
"I need to move on, in any case. Got a long way to drive tonight," Tony said with some relief, as it seemed to Steve. He probably can't wait to be out of here and get back to his life and his friends.
Then, never breaking the pace, Tony reaches out with his left hand and pinches Steve's nipple. It's like an electric shock that goes straight into his brain, filling it with shooting stars, but it's still
The fatigues would be next, sweet gods. How's he supposed to handle this? Was it really necessary to make people strip in the fucking landing bay? The medbay was small, true, and already full of wounded pilots, and they probably transported only serious cases over there. But
Or perhaps he should just let everyone be right; he could be an asshole and be out of here in a minute. Out of
He drummed his fingers on the tabletop for a moment, staring at them. "Some families celebrate together," he said slowly, "and they love it, and it's great. Or I suppose it is. A family holiday and all that. And some families are too broken for that, so they don't bother. But there are families that pretend they work, for one reason or another, and then they go through the motions, painfully, once a year, until the torture becomes unbearable; and you're a kid, and you know it's all fake, but you have to be there, you've got no choice, and you have to say all the correct words and, all the correct phrases, and you have to have the correct expression on your face, and you can't mess it up, otherwise you're unleashing hell. So, yeah. There you go.
"Only, we don't know that anyone's coming," Tony had argued, because the thought of cooping themselves up made him feel jittery and he'd almost rather have charged into the enemy with his guns blazing than sat on his ass and waited.
"Hold that thought," Tony said into his phone, as something slammed – quite soundly – into the side of his car, parked by the roadside. "I apparently just got hit by a hitchhiker."
still love the other Tony too, and I don't think that's really going to change, but... but whether you are him or not, I know
"Who?" Peter leaned against the railing beside him, for all the world as if he was preparing to hear a juicy piece of gossip.
Somewhat before 3 p.m. the signal briefly reappeared, and he got a text from Pepper. Apparently, they'd tried to get through to the lake house, but they promptly turned back. Since it was impossible to actually make a call, Tony texted Steve to tell him not to bother and apologized for wasting his time. Hopefully he wasn't on his way yet. He would hate the weather. The forecast was subpolar.
As he spoke he looked from face to face, staring hard into the cadets' eyes, trying to drill his words into their minds. But during the last few sentences, his eyes caught Tony's and wouldn't let go. Tony's reaction was his usual, semi-amused one: a wry grin, a cocked eyebrow, and too late Natasha's words came back to him, and he tried to go for super-serious, which probably looked even more mocking. A flash of anger would have been better in Tony's book, but Rogers just frowned and looked away.
"Yeah, and I love Happy, and he's my friend, and I know what he likes to eat, and I know all his favorite TV shows, and I never once thought he might be in love with someone, let alone with Pepper. It never even crossed my mind."
Everything happens somewhere. Maybe out there, in the multiverse, there is a Steve who went back and had his dance with Peggy instead. I'm not that Steve. I suppose I was him at some point, or he was me, but not any longer, not for a very long time. And if everything comes to pass somewhere, maybe there is a timeline in which the ever-spinning coin lands on its rim and stays upright; there is precisely a one in 6000 chance of that happening. And, so, over there, both Steve and Tony, perhaps, walk away alive from that battlefield, victorious; perhaps they are walking very close to each other. Together, as was meant to be. Hands almost touching, but not quite. Soon, perhaps. They are so very tired. They need their rest, but nevertheless, in that moment, for them, the world is just as it should be. They'll figure it all out, I'm sure. What they mean to each other. What they can be to each other. Today, with all my heart, I am rooting for them.
Steve tries to struggle up from his knees and sags to the ground instead. He doesn't remember ever feeling quite this week ever since the serum.
holding Steve by the hand and leaning towards him with his whole body. "We'll need to talk at some point," Steve says reluctantly into Tony's hair.
," he said, still not letting go of Steve's hands because they felt too good in his grip to leave alone. We all have our limits, he thought. And then Steve squeezed back, and for a moment Tony thought he'd lose his footing. He tried to concentrate on his words instead. "Yeah, I know, I had a lot of time to think about it and I know. I understand."
With an abrupt motion, he pushed Steve’s hand away from his cock. Which was when, with a barely audible “To hell with it,” Steve buried his fingers to the hilt. Tony could hear his patchy, loud breathing, could feel the hot breath scorch his knee.
There wasn't much in the way of packing for Tony to do, really. Shaving kit. A paperback he'd read three times already and figured he could probably trade off for booze. Being so far from the civilization – if a civilization still existed – made books a rare commodity. Half the clothes he'd had in his bags Tony'd donated for the rescued civilians – not that he was likely to have much use for business suits nowadays, anyway. The only business meeting he was likely to attend, he figured, would be with Hecate, and for that he wouldn't need to dress to impress.
"Among other things," Steve said serenely. For the first time in many months, he felt a pure wave of happiness wash over him as they walked side by side.
His blond eyelashes lowered over his eyes, his eyebrows dancing for a moment, Steve shoots him a covert amused look. That's just too much.
. "Let's say they never tell each other," Steve goes on, doggedly. "You think that doesn't count? You wouldn't say they love each other?"
If Tony actually felt the same as him, if that crazy idea was possible, the most important thing was to sort out the leaving bit. They could clear the rest later. If Tony had... had feelings for him, he had to stay. They could find a way to be together, even in Timely, even though the town likely wouldn't understand. They didn't have to be exactly public – but no, that was dishonest and it wasn't Steve's way. Well. Perhaps that was another battle they'd have to fight, but if they went at it together, it would be more than worth it. As long as Tony stayed. With him.
. Oh, they argue, and they sometimes drive each other up the wall, and Natasha occasionally threatens she'll throw them out, but they are blindly, insanely, guiltily happy with each other, all in all. They live together now at the Compound, with Dog. It's there that Scott finds them.
"Hey there." Tony didn't want to yell. He wasn't exactly whispering either, but his voice was quiet and even.
it seemed he could have strangled Steve, but instead he pushed his tongue into Steve's mouth, and ground his hips into Steve's, insolent, uncaring,
It's the lightest of flicks, aimed at his head, although a few tresses go astray. A sharp sensation that isn't exactly pleasure and isn't exactly pain rushes from Steve's contracting balls into the tip of his cock, and he closes his eyes and cries out.
the way Stark was with people. And yet something wouldn't let him look away. Those brown eyes were more alive than any Steve had seen lately. His energy was magnetic.
), and he saw him walk down at the head of his group, one hand on Peter's shoulder, one on Kamala's. Tony was wearing the best, fakest, most brilliant smile in his register. Behind them, Pepper was lovely as ever, and at her sides, Bruce seemed nervous, Thor all in his element, and at the tail end of the group, Carol and Rhodey walked hand in hand, like a bastion of normalcy, Steve thought. Rhodey seemed to be handling steps with no obvious problems, and Steve's heart contracted for a second. And the decorations on Carol's dress uniform gleamed like a dozen small suns.
Tony's worry, like his attentions earlier, had to be unwanted. He knew that. The two of them had chatted over the comms, yeah, but, in retrospect, it had to be Steve the superior officer helping the green cadet stay calm. Nothing more, nothing less. Tony had no business demanding answers about his condition, but
, Steve repeated to himself, and he had no idea why it made his cheeks a little hotter, but it did. He very much decided to keep that to himself.
And Steve nodded. "All right, Stark." Heat and cold mixed in his belly because this was most probably a goodbye, forever, and what if
Tony: Also, just as a point of interest, that TOO is strangely significant for such a small, shitty word. Might not want to omit it the next time.
, he wanted to say, because this wasn't okay, that kind of looks, of body language, and then nothing again, nothing. He hated himself for caring. He hated himself for dancing to it, like a fish on a string.
He said that. Not in so many words, but the essence was there, or at least he thought so, because right then he had trouble following what his mouth was spewing. His heart was thunder and his lips were dry as the Mojave Desert.
He even felt so gutsy he dared a long look at Steve. Seated on the gurney and leaning back on his left hand, Steve seemed strangely at peace.
And the flimsy memory of not-a-kiss, and the warmth of Steve’s shoulder pressed against his as they read by the fire – all of it was suddenly stronger than the desire to push back. Because, in a moment of complete honesty with himself, Tony knew that, even if he had something to prove here, it wasn’t going to happen this way.
And then, out of a corner of his eye, he saw Steve finally being released from Thor's grip. Tony half expected Thor to propel Steve towards Tony or something equally horrifying. All Thor did, however, was mouth something at Tony over Steve's shoulder. It looked suspiciously like
"What?" Steve echoed, and – yes, it was a prone human form on the floor. Moving the fire extinguisher to his left hand, he hauled the person up over his right shoulder and started back towards Darryl's group at a run. The air, at least, was more or less breathable near the entrance corridor; maybe they had spare oxygen masks too. He remembered seeing first aid kits somewhere. Maybe there was still hope. No matter how long it seemed, the whole thing – since he arrived on deck with Tony and Thor – had lasted perhaps twenty minutes.
Tony: Also, thanks for asking, and you are probably right, and I'm going to go to sleep now, catch a few hours if I can.
"And then I asked her to marry me, so that we would have something to tell the press when Peter refused to join up," he said. "It was a
And it hurt. It hurt that he doubted me. It hurt that he thought I would actually leave him. I know he had his reasons, and, having our history in mind, maybe I deserved what I was getting, but I somehow felt it wasn't fair. I'd cheated time and tricked death so that I could spend more time with him.
In this timeline, my age is finally starting to catch up with me. The joints creek and ache and tend to predict weather. The stairs are becoming an enemy. I finally remember how it feels to be breathless after a run. And while I try to run on, months stubbornly crawl by.
Steve imagines he can convey everything he thinks, he feels, with that one word. He's only fooling himself, of course, but that's all he got.
He'd thought that little, confused, warm feeling was gone forever from his life, but here it was again, a tiny pool of shy pleasure somewhere in his chest. He felt his eyes smile. "Thank you, Tony."
A light touch on his elbow made him trail off mid-sentence. Strokes of a thumb, gentle, repetitive, at the sensitive spot where his  forearm met his upper arm. Soothing waves spreading in concentric circles, from the spot of contact and outwards; and for a second all he wanted was to close his eyes and be at peace. But instead he glanced down, towards the elbow, towards Steve’s gentle hand, and of course Steve had to misinterpret the look and he removed his hand hurriedly.
," he starts again, sounding more like himself this time, more assertive, sharper. "What I meant is, I never got to forgive him. While he was alive. We never made up. We worked together in the end, obviously. I even made him a new shield because he needed it. But..." But he never gave him back this one, and they were never friends again.
Which was when he thought he felt someone's gaze on him. It prickled at the back of his scull like a mosquito. He glanced back.
"Improbable," he said, sounding more snappish than he meant to. "Unless something's gone really wrong, the sensors on other decks would have registered it and the alarms would be blaring their ass off."
it?), and a fog of sorts was coming over his senses, and his chest felt almost asthmatic all over again.
Thor sighed theatrically. "Kyrumption: When two great heroes come together on the field of battle..."
I compressed my lips in frustration with myself because I didn't know what to tell him without falling into trap of addressing my own Tony instead.
to come, to go over the top; he thinks he can't take a second longer. He collects his thought, forcibly distancing himself from all the sensations coursing through his overstrained body. Tries to remember what Tony said.
"Nope, but now I got you." Tony's mouth quirked. "Maybe you can't kick through these walls, exactly, but you can sure be useful."
– and at the same time he wanted to hold Tony close, as close as humanly possible, and bury his nose in Tony's neck.
Steve resigned himself to this, bit by bit. The work on the Accords was limping along somehow (Steve gave his – very thoughtful and careful – suggestions to Clint to pass along to Natasha, who gave them to Tony even before they started the so-called talking). He went for a hearing with the U.N. Some countries abjured his fugitive status, some didn't. Nothing was finished yet, but there was work being done in that department.
Tony: Got it all neatly written down for me. On these tiny cards. As if I couldn't memorize a fucking phonebook overnight. Christ.
"Oh no you don't," Tony said sharply. "Keep your eyes open." Steve complies, to find the slits of the helmet staring directly at his face for a second.
, Tony thought. The intensity of the feeling surprised him, even scared him a little bit. "Not the point here," he said instead.
Steve goes off to die. He may be telling himself it's something else entirely, but he hurls himself into the fray, uncaring; and he knows well what he's doing.
“Oh, I want to, trust me,” Steve said in a controlled, frustrated whisper. He sounded like he was near bursting. And he ran the fingers of his free hand lightly over Tony’s thigh, up and down, teasing, soothing, then up to his stomach, dancing up and down Tony’s cock as he pumped his finger in and out. Tony closed his eyes again.
Still, he couldn't keep track of all directions at once. As one goon raised his sidearm, aiming towards the back of his head, Tony swung the metal pipe they'd salvaged from the flush tank. The man went down. Tony dove for his gun, landed on his bad leg, swore savagely. The pain was shattering. Until then, it had been mostly a black, dull throbbing, sometimes nauseating but he was kind of used to it. Now it was like a red hot knife and for a moment Tony thought he'd throw up. He wasn't sure if he could get up without help at all. Still, from his vantage point on the floor, he took flawless aim and fired. Someone's kneecap shattered. That was the penultimate goon standing. Steve promptly took care of the last one and stopped for a moment to get his breath back.
Something in Tony's eyes stops me in my tracks. "This one's not mine, though," I say very gently.  I hold it for him to take back, but he just looks at me stubbornly.
It was a little chilly in here, Steve had to admit, and he could have sworn there was a draft. (If he mentioned it, Tony would say something on the lines of 'it must be something only old people can feel'.) (No, he probably wouldn't, not any more.)
(This was one of the reasons Steve would have preferred not to feel anything at all. Most of the time, it got from 'feeling' to 'unbearable' in ten easy seconds.)
In the din of the dying battlefield – the clanks and shouts and moans of the wounded – Tony didn't hear him approach, or otherwise pretended he didn't.
He still felt compelled to say, "I can't guarantee you that I'm emotionally ready for that kind of relationship."
. Cuddling. Together.  “In summer, though...” And what did it all mean? Was he mistaken, was this a weird friendship thing instead? PTSD buddies unite and all that. Was he just keeping Steve warm? Was Steve just... well, whatever he thought he was doing, taking care of Tony? “Early autumn’s also nice,” he heard himself say and was grateful for his autopilot. “Ever been to Malibu, Cap?” His mind was slanting towards swirly mists again, but he could manage a light conversation.
"Oh, I meant it," I told him, without raising my eyes, searching on. There was a two-year gap in my journals, and then, when they re-started, I saw entries and notebooks I didn't recognize. Reading them would have felt like an invasion of privacy; I wanted to do it so fiercely it hurt. To see the thoughts of that other Steve, the lucky bastard who'd had Tony to himself during those five years, who had some real history with him.
, blurred and dim, in the daylight; he could discern the silhouettes, the movement. And the silhouettes he was now straining to observe were that of Rhodey, in his War Machine gear, fretting over Tony on his newly acquired crutches, in the hospital parking lot. It was snowing, but the snow wouldn't stick. The trip in an out of the hospital was truly expedient. Tony had agreed to the x-rays and the cast only because Rhodey absolutely wouldn't back down.
Natasha placed a hand on her friend's shoulder-plate, silently telling him to calm down. It would do no one any good to have a hysteria-afflicted Avenger causing distress at this time.
Steve was making an honest-to-god speech to the masses, and when you are making a speech, you tend to get carried away. You don't exactly notice what's going on around you. Just one moment of inattention could be one too many.
"You've no reason to act pissed," he informed her quietly, as he regarded her expressionless face, her perfect eyebrows. She inclined her head noncommittally. Of course she would be angry with him, because he'd rushed headlong into danger without taking real backup – even Tony and Thor had been rather incidental. And she was probably right, in retrospect, but that was no way to gauge your decisions. When the situation was urgent and there was no time, you made the best call you could and you had to hope it would turn out okay. And you couldn't let your decisions be questioned by your troops, even if the said troops were your friends. Steve was always happy to consult with Nat and the others, but that was different. That was at his own discretion.
"How are the strength exercises going?" Cap enquired, and by now he was back to his normal stiff self, or at least he sounded it. Tony half expected him to call him 'son' one of these days, which was – everything considered – a bit too icky.
In and out, a few times, and then scissoring, unscissoring, and some fumbling on the inside, searching for the sweet spot that made Tony curse and arch his back all over again and dig his nails into Steve’s shoulder as hard as he could.
"Chatter," Steve interjected, cutting off Clint's next remark. The king's voice habitually carried over the battlefield, even though he did sound quite exhausted now. "Tony, I'm afraid I'll need a hand here."
Seeing him in person. Like being hit by a very warm, very soft truck. The tired eyes, the suppressed smile and a whole bunch of sheer presence that tended to outglow anything else around it, as far as Tony was concerned. He would have stopped and fought for breath, at least a little bit, at least for the dramatic effect, but hell, who cared about breath anyway. They just stood and looked at each other for a moment. Within touching distance, in a small, sheltered bubble of space-time that was effectively saying: screw you, multiverse. At the moment, we don't care. At the moment, you don't exist.
This is dangerous ground. No, screw that. It's quicksand inside a smoking volcano during an earthquake.
“I told you you would catch a bug if you stayed in that cabin,” he murmured. He knew his voice was choked up. “You always think you can’t catch anything. But you caught a case of feelings, so yeah.
"You can still fight," Tony said. "If you can kick your way through a brick wall, you can damn well fight. And if you grow tired, well, you're still stronger than an average guy." And the way Steve moved, you'd hardly guess he couldn't see unless you knew him. It weren't just the senses enhanced by the serum, either. "And you trained with a blindfold for so long." Endless hours of ruthless practice, with his teammates, with fighting machines Tony designed, his eyes tied all the while. At the time, Tony had thought it unnecessary, with his darkvision and all; once again, he was proven wrong.
Then it hit me – how tragic it was, then, because they could have had those five years, happy and together, and they didn't.
, he told himself firmly. He didn't need the praise,  didn't care about it, and especially not for something so trivial as this.
Tony: No, dummy. It's a game of chess. Come on, indulge me, I'm so bored I might spontaneously break into constituent particles.
He sounded so perfectly serious and matter-of-fact that Tony couldn't keep his smile to himself. That was Steve for you, apparently. One moment he was all sad and profound, the next moment it was eyeballs and hooves.
If he'd expected some kind of solicitous reaction, he should have known better. She just arched an eyebrow.
Instead of answering the non-question, Tony asked: "Do you really think things would have been so vastly different if we'd been in the same place, at the same time when Thanos came?" If he didn't know better, Steve could have sworn Tony was talking to himself instead. Trying to convince himself.
touching him there... Like he had pressed a button. Tony gasped and shuddered and his back jerked up and then down, and
"I wanted to be there for you, I swear," Steve went on. "But I didn't think you needed me. I thought... I didn't know what you wanted from me."
And when Steve went back to what had apparently been Tony's childhood bedroom, a little more at ease now, he set the candle down on the desk. And he noticed how tiny it was: a kids' desk, probably made for someone all of ten years old. He felt a muscle in his cheek twitch. Something in Steve shifted, then shifted again. Gently, he ran a hand over the surface, with all the dents and scratches and burn marks (from... welding?). And unsure why exactly, he covered his mouth with his hand and whispered:
Tony: Because what I want is to know whether I should be hacking into traffic cameras and running face recognition sw, running rescue or... (sorry, the puns aren't working for me today, but you get the gist). I want to be able to help if shit really hits the fan.
, he thought, as he hurried in the direction in which Tony had left. And it made no sense. It seemed to him all he did tonight was go after Tony, time and again, wanting to apologize, and then fucking up, over and over.
And in an instant they were inside, never letting go of one another. Steve half pushed, half carried him until the back of Tony's knees hit the wooden frame, and then Steve was on top of him, and Tony's hands were fumbling with Steve's belt, and then, for a while, the world went white.
Ever so slowly, Tony turned towards him, finally. The expression on his face was that of polite inquiry. It looked contrived. It looked like a thin veil over something much more interesting – and, Steve thought firmly, forbidden.
"How come I'm naked?" Steve repeated, but it somehow felt as if he'd only realized it for the first time, all over again; as if he'd already forgotten he'd mentioned it a minute ago.
This was not how people who didn't care about each other behaved. If only this gentleness, this companionship could be enough for Steve.
Yet, when Tony isn't looking, Steve drinks in his face – it looks a little older, a little more tired. Dearer than ever. He doesn't allow himself to stare, not too much, otherwise Tony might see, and know. And when he isn't quite looking, Steve has this vague impression that Tony's eyes are following him in turn, studying him, trying to decipher, to parse, to put together and pull apart, discern what's inside. He says nothing about it. Tony doesn't either.
, now. So he turned all the way to Steve (who had somehow managed to go from happy to worried and haunted in a matter of seconds). Kiss or words, kiss or words? No matter how much he longed to touch those lips with his own... And oh god, a hug like the one before, but with kissing;
“Look at me.” Tony's brown eyes snapped to her own. “We are going to find him," she enunciated very clearly. "Even if it takes us ten years, we are going to find him. There is not one place on this earth someone could hide him that we won't find. I refuse for any of us to lose any more family members. I'm not going through that again.” She narrowed her eyes. “Do you understand me?”
This part of the corridor wasn't in much use this time of day. Cap was standing a the end of it, fiddling with the elevator commands. At the sight of his back, his shoulders, Tony's breath hitched. It took him a second to remember what he was doing there and how important it was. There was no one else around.
"It's not very good," Steve said truthfully. "Purifiers, I think. The wall sprinklers won't reach this far, and the ones on the ceiling are..."
Rhodey, however, seemed so weird and fidgety and uncharacteristically distracted, that Tony almost forgot his own hurt for a moment. "What's with you tonight, baby?"
. Suddenly, forcibly, the increased gravity pushed him down into his seat, and he felt his heart rate speed up. A surprised, delighted laugh escaped his lips. This felt like the real thing, like real flying. He'd
All Steve said was: “Oh,” and there was that tiny, happy oblong his lips sometimes formed. Tony was learning to appreciate the hell out of it: the shape that emerged when something pleasant caught Steve unawares.
It dawned on Tony then, what it was, and he plonked down on the other end of the sofa, although it felt more like collapsing. His knees finally gave way. He leaned his head against the back cushion because suddenly he lacked the strength to hold it upright. Still, he turned  to the left and gave Steve a look that might have fried him all the way to his bones.
Stark's inappropriate quip was above all silly, and the man was clearly drunk. Steve was mildly annoyed, but that, at least he knew how to deal with. He put his 'captain' face on. Stark had even looked somewhat chastised at the end of the conversation.
"I want..." Steve began hoarsely, trailing off mid-sentence as if he couldn't be bothered to finish it, as if there was no point. And then his
So sincere, in fact, that Tony absolutely forgets where they are and why they are doing what they are doing. When they break apart, he is out of breath, and he spots the receptionist staring at them, her mouth hanging half-open.
"Carrying. I don't know, I was out of it, mostly. When I wasn't... No, I'm pretty sure I didn't see any light. Look, the serum may still regenerate whatever's damaged," Steve said. His voice was level. "We'll see, eventually. Tony, why are you dragging your foot?"
And they weren't, they couldn't, didn't know how to – not to each other, at any rate. When Tony tried to joke around, Steve would draw back or take it the wrong way. When Steve forced himself to try chatting, it sounded stiff and unnatural, and grated on Tony's nerves. Steve wasn't socially awkward otherwise. He had friends among the pilots. He was sometimes downright cordial with  other cadets. It was obviously just Tony he had a problem with.
"Oh, nothing," Tony says. "You're a natural born spy. Known for your discretion and circumspection."
Steve’s skiing style was all business, conserving energy and mostly avoiding unnecessary flourish Tony was prone to himself. The man kept a tight rein on his jumps, not letting the moguls steal his control from him even for a second, and despite his size, he always landed softly like a snowflake. Not for a moment was his balance compromised. He seemed well-trained, and Tony had suspected it had had something to do with the war. But at the same time, his technique was bold and fast, and just a bit too cheeky, the way he skied he zipper line. Tony liked watching him. Actually, he’d let himself get so consumed that at one point his skis shot out from under him and he landed on his side, and went spinning downslope until he came to an embarrassing stop.
His suit jacket felt so tight he couldn't breathe (although, rationally, he knew it was a perfect fit). Steve needed to move. Needed to not have the press of people around him. The muscles of his legs danced with suppressed claustrophobia.
"And that was that?" I was getting engrossed in the story, because there seemed to be something more to it.
," Tony said sharply, and the name felt weird on his tongue, angular, rough with disuse. At the sound of his name, Steve stopped, blinked, swallowed. And,
. The vibration was perceptible. The elevator was now moving. "I'm a mechanic." He turned to Steve triumphantly, for the moment forgetting both his state of undress and the sexual tension that was – he couldn't deny it – throbbing between them; so much so that you could eat it with a spoon.
"Well, he sure looks it." Something in that statement sat wrong with him, even though he couldn't quite put his finger on it. Steve considered for a moment. "The way he inspired the other cadets to run," he went on slowly. "To... work together, to actually do something, achieve something – I mean, I know it's just a silly game, but it's still very good exercise. And it got the old pilots and the cadets to do something together."
Tony's fingers now flew over the panel. He was finding his focus. The tip of his tongue protruded between his lips. "I'm trying to trick it into thinking there's still working
– just to tell him no, apparently; to flush the hope out just so he could squish it more thoroughly.
But it had been over a year since that night, and they'd been too busy or too awkward to do anything but text when they weren't organizing and coordinating. What Steve now wanted, what he craved, was some quiet time with Tony for a change, without a million other people around and a million things that needed doing the-day-before-yesterday-don't-we-have-a-time-machine-yet-dammit. A silly chat, about clothes, about movies, like when they texted, but in person, because to Steve it made a world of difference. Even if Tony didn't see him – he faltered, searching for an expression – in a romantic light, he supposed. Because of course Tony didn't, it was just Steve's wishful thinking. And yet... Did he imagine the hints? Because the what-ifs wouldn't leave him alone and hope was unavoidable. There was nothing he could do about that.
"Did he have feelings for her?" I asked, because I'd learned quite a lot about people and their reactions in that support group, as I mentioned.
I kissed him for a long time, then, against the wall, and against the closet door and against the kitchen counter, going from room to room again, exorcising the ghosts of the fight.
Tony: I'm sorry they were in the Raft. I'm sorry I parted with Natasha on such terms. I never wanted any of this either, Steve.
"Down." Tony said automatically, before he could fully register what Cap was saying. It was hard to exit the argumentative mode when his heart pounded so. Reluctantly, he recognized thrumming excitement building. He wasn't too proud of it, but at least
Steve breathed slowly. What seemed like a million different replies buzzed and flocked in Steve's mind. The musicians had finished their final waltz. The last of the guests were leaving now or seemed about to leave. Both groups of the Avengers, as well as Wolverine (no one could drink like Wolverine, especially if someone else was paying for it), were among the last ones present, as was generally their manner. The time seemed to be speeding around them, and all he could do was watch Tony, still in a good mood, lean over to Rhodey, saying something, grinning... He wasn't looking at Steve at all,
Tony frowned. "Did you just go for a run? It's nice to get a bit of fresh air first thing in the morning, eh?" It escaped his mouth before he could put a stop to it. "Sir," he added lamely, for good measure, and immediately wanted to kick himself in the teeth. It was remarks like this one that landed him in trouble. Suddenly, it all felt so unreal he half-expected himself to wake up, back in his old home on Virgon.
Without a word, Steve jumped in, lent his strength. He bowed his knees, put his shoulder under a protruding part of the tail and
, Tony thought ruefully, and for the umpteenth time he wondered what was so wrong with him that Steve persistently refused to take him into consideration, despite the fact the guy was obviously attracted to him...
By the clank of the cuffs he knows he's tugging at them, and makes himself stop. It's good that they are sturdy. And at the spot deep inside of him, a more intense burning, a want for a pleasure that is almost there, just a hairbreadth away, and still seems unreachable.
"Right," Tony said and made himself focus on the screens and the radars and the panels in front of him. His palm on the control stick felt clammy. "You ready?"
"...find somewhere private to talk..." Tony replied out of the corner of  his lips, even though no one was paying attention to them right now.
without you," Tony shot back. The abrupt intensity in his voice could burn through walls. He said it so quickly and so urgently that something inside Steve suddenly clicked. It left him startled. Like the world turning on its head in one sentence. Was it actually possible that he was so wrong? Yet, there was that look in Tony's eyes right now, sadness and longing, and there was the way Tony was always around, always happy to talk to Steve –
Tony: So, Everhart left WHIH some time ago. She was just about to launch a new network, she's got good connections and there are some really good journalists onboard with this; they are going to launch their network with your statement. Now, there WILL be critical commentary, but there would have been anyway, and this way I actually get heads up as to what's happening, and I'm getting them some exclusive info they wouldn't otherwise have. It's not going to go badly for us.
