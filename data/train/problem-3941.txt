When Castiel finally made his way down the stairs, most of the hunters had finished eating. The table was a scattered mess of bowls and pots once more, causing Castiel to jokingly roll his eyes. Three people were still sat at the table, the red head, shaggy hair and another girl who Castiel hadn’t noticed earlier. The three of them were huddled together. They were in deep conversation, talking intensely and signing to each other. He made his way over and perched himself on a chair nearby. He did it in an awkward manner in an attempt to not disturb them. He glanced over at the large pot sat in the middle of the table, still steaming, containing remnants of whatever the group had just eaten for what he assumed was breakfast.
“He’s jealous of you. He hates you.” Dean paused, trying to gather the words and admit what was happening, “He...he...told me to kill you.”
“Maybe,” he finally replied, “Now let's go catch ourselves a meal.”
It had been his marvellous idea that they went to this new trendy sports bar in town. Bar 365 where all the cool kids hung out, and no he hadn’t suggested it because of rumours his ex-girlfriend, Lisa Braeden, was going to be there. Well, okay, that was one of the reasons he suggested it. But he also mentioned it because he wanted to have a good night out with his friends as they hadn’t all hung out together in a while. His brother had joked that Dean was only organizing this because booze was involved and so what? Booze made the nights fun. Sam had later agreed to come because it was a ‘sports bar’, so it would most likely be playing the big hockey game that he’d been talking about for weeks. Their friend Eileen, who Sam had the most blatant crush on, also agreed to come along and Dean then instantly knew the ‘hockey’ story was a cover up.

“Please work,” he whispered under his breath.
Thank you for reading, I uploaded this chapter earlier than I planned so I'm not sure when I'm going to be posting the next chapter. Thanks for reading,

Dean was even more annoyed at himself because of the unspoken words between them, everything he had wanted to tell Castiel and now he couldn’t He’d never get the chance.
Song: 'Home'- Rhodes
“Who?” the mirror asked, but he already knew the answer, “Now, now Your Majesty, don’t you think this is all a bit drastic. I’m sure everyone loves you as much as they love Feathers.”
The two brothers laughed at each other for a second and Sam held his hand out to help pull his brother up. Dean was ready to take his hand and follow Sam on a trail when he heard an ear-piercing cry, startling him. Both brothers looked around bewildered and that’s when they saw a group of birds flying their way. They were chirping loud and incessantly, and they were venturing closer and closer to the brothers. Some landed on the boulder Sam and Dean had just been sat on, whilst others began to swarm around them. They were trying to get their attention, trying to tell them something important. Sam watched them, puzzled and was about to swat them away when Dean spoke up.
“He’s with me,” The voice said. Dean turned to see his best friend, Cas, stood beside him.
I hope you guys liked this chapter, and I'm excited to post the next one tomorrow. I'm nearly finished writing this story and I must warn the pining and the angst is strong.
This is just a rough introduction chapter to set everything up but I hope it's okay, aha!
“I’ll do better tomorrow, Your Highness.”
And yet, all he could think about was Dean.
Dean ran down the corridor, towards the main castle gates, tumbling past a confused Charlie and Sam.
Lucifer placed the box back down once more. The sound it made when it collided with the table echoed around the room. A sudden chill picked up in the air, and the moonlight started to creep through a hole in the roof. This glow reflected off of the side of Lucifer’s face, lighting up his eyes and allowing Crowley to finally see the sinister grin his master wore.
“King,” Dean scoffed, “You’re just a cowardly little man, who murdered his own brother because he was scared, he’d lose his power. And guess what, you’re still going to lose your power because we’re going to tell everyone. They deserve to know the truth, and they deserve better than you as their leader. Just like Cas deserves...deserved better than you as a brother. Deserved better than this whole world.”
The rain tumbled down from the sky, soaking Dean and his brother who was trying to keep up with him. Their clothes were beginning to stick to their bodies and their hair was falling in their faces. Sam was struggling to keep up with Dean and was trying to get through to him, trying to talk to him and calm him down but to no prevail. Thoughts raced around in Dean’s head; he wasn’t entirely sure himself where he was headed but he knew who he was looking for. He wasn’t entirely sure what he was going to do when he saw Lucifer either, but he knew he had to do something.  His rage was going to boil over any moment as it bubbled away inside. He was furious at Lucifer. He was mad at the world. But most importantly he was angry at himself. Dean knew he shouldn’t have left Castiel alone, that he should’ve stayed with him... but he didn’t and now it was too late.
“Well, I mean that’s what this is all about, isn't it? Making her jealous,” Cas replied, folding him arms across his chest and tilting his head slightly, “Come on, Dean. I know you.”
Crowley shuffled on his feet, like it was the first time he’d ever moved them.
Dean took a deep breath.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Wait...the other thing...I need your help,” Dean paused, “Can you be my boyfriend?”
Castiel did not expect to see six figures stood around the bed he had slept in. Each of them staring at him. They towered over the Prince, whispering between themselves. Castiel looked around slightly startled. He noticed they each were carrying weapons, a sword, a dagger, a bow. Castiel's internal alarm bells began to ring loudly, a heavy pulsating through his head. His heart started to pound and mind raced, for a split second he wondered if they were Lucifer's men. Had he been found already? Where was Dean? Why weren't they trying to kill him? He tried to wriggle under the blanket, to hide himself, but they'd already seen him so really his actions were pointless.
“Cas.”
“Oh, I’m awfully sorry to interrupt this little gathering,” Lucifer said, signalling between Dean, Castiel and the crowd of birds near them. Lucifer took another step forward and without hesitation some of the birds flew away, sensing something not quite right.
“If it’s a curse set by the king, why hasn’t he woken up?” Dean asked, “The King’s dead. Shouldn’t his curse have ended like yours?”
Lucifer comes up with a plan whilst Dean and Cas catch up, or try too.
Castiel nodded, still reaching for his boots. He would join them soon-he just needed a minute to himself. A minute to take in all this kindness and hospitality. A minute to gather his early morning thoughts.
Dean bundled down a flight of stairs, using a wall to help him keep his balance.
“Seems like your friends want some too,” the old man joked, a gruff chuckle escaping his lips.
Dean nodded understanding what his friend was saying. He flashed a sympathetic look in Castiel’s direction.
“Hello, Dean.”
“Yeah, but I wouldn’t have it any other way.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“The pleasure was all mine, Your Highness,” he replied, “See you tomorrow.”
It wasn’t too far in the distance, and Dean wasn’t fully sure it was Lucifer but he had nothing to lose. It was the figure of a man, arched over and wearing a black cloak, heading up a weird path. The person had clearly never been through this part of the woods before because Dean knew where they were heading instantly. Up the large rock. The path spiralled upwards to a peak that hung over the quarry and the only way back down would be where he first came from. The person was going to reach a dead end and Dean would be there to greet them. He decided to follow up the narrow path but made sure he was weary of his surroundings, the memory with his father fresh in his mind. Lose stones flung off the side as he climbed upwards and as more rain fell it became increasingly harder to see. Dean thought he could hear Sam behind him but didn’t check.
“Hey,” Charlie responded, “I was beginning to think you were ignoring me or something. Where’d you go last night? You were there one second and the next you were gone!”
“It must be nice to have these guys,” Castiel commented, pointing around at everyone. They were now all huddled near the fire. Talking, dancing, singing. “I’ve never really had anyone, well except the animals... but of course, that just sounds weird. And I thought if I loved the people in the kingdom and they loved me it’d fill the emptiness, but it’s not the same. To be loved and to have love, they're different feelings,” Castiel exhaled, “Besides, my brother’s taken that away from me now too anyway.”
“And we can pretend that I’ve always been deeply and madly in love with you but I never had the courage to say it, until I saw you with Lisa and got jealous,” Cas chuckled slightly and gave Dean a knowing eye whilst mentioning Lisa. “And then like every fairy tale story we got together, but this one won’t have a happy ever after...”
“Well then Novak,” he replied, “I think you play the part just fine.”
At his brother’s text Cas glanced back over to the bar to see if Dean had been served yet, but was stopped in his tracks. He had to do a double take.
“Okay, I will,” Dean replied, pushing himself up. He reattached his holster to his belt and smoothed down his shirt and trousers, before running a hand through his hair to push it back. He was about to set off when he placed a hand back on the table and leant a tad closer to Charlie.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m not going to; I hope you know that. I’m not going to do what he says,” Dean finally said, immediately looking to reassure Castiel, “I have a plan and you’re going to be fine; I promise. You’re my best friend, just know that I could nev...”
At that moment his phone began ringing. An upbeat remediation of 'Under Pressure' started playing and Dean’s photo was gazing at him through the screen. Cas sighed again, reluctantly answering the call.
“Isn’t that fun?”
He glanced around at the tables which were filled with a few customers and was surprised to see his brother, Gabe, sat amongst them. He was writing something on his laptop and taking a bite out of an apple. Over at the counter Anael had noticed Cas. She was serving a customer and signalled for him to go sit down somewhere, suggesting she’d come over and see him afterwards. He often arrived like this without warning and Anael would always know that Cas wanted a one on one. It was like she could read his mind.
Dean peered up at her out of one eye and winced. He placed his palms on the table to push himself up slightly but made sure his back remained arched and his was head still low down.
So, that happened!
The following days passed by quite quickly for Castiel. The hunters decided to stay home for a bit to help him settle in, to make sure he was safe for the first few days. Castiel appreciated how much all of them cared and looked out for him. Like Dean had said, they really started to feel like a family. He was learning practical skills from Bobby, cooking with Jody and Donna. He already had inside jokes with Charlie and felt like a third wheel when he was with Sam and Eileen. And then there was Dean, his best friend. They hadn’t spent as much time together and they hadn’t spoken about the incident the other night, where Castel thought for a second that something was going to happen, but they still spoke occasionally and sat together for meals.
Castiel was awoken by a loud knock at the door. He bolted up, startled, and was unsure who or what had caused the sound. He was certain that he hadn’t been asleep that long and therefore there was no way that Dean and the other hunters could be back so soon. Castiel sat up slowly, gripping the blanket tightly, hesitantly peering around. Then there was another knock at the door, louder than before and with significantly more force. Castiel gave it a few moments before deciding he’d go and see who was there. For all he knew it could be his imagination going into overdrive.
“Magic Mirror on the wall, who in this land is the most handsome of all?”
“Who says I wasn’t?” Dean instantly quipped back, a slight grin across his face.
They both looked around the space before their eyes landed on the bright red hair of Charlie. She was stood up and eagerly waved at them. Dean and Cas made their way over to the table and Cas sat himself down in a gap besides Sam and Eileen. Dean remained standing and put his hand on the table.
Cas nodded, “Well, you did actually manage to have foam all over your face, but normally I wouldn’t even tell you until we’re out in public. I’d let you try flirt with someone attractive and embarrass yourself,” Cas shrugged, nonchalantly, seeming proud of himself. “You were taking this whole thing seriously so I decided to up my game too.”
Crowley felt like he was waiting for an evil cackle that never came. Instead, Lucifer picked up one of his books. It was large and had a leather black cover. It was worn and old and seemed so mysterious.
“Sorry, I um...I didn’t mean to leave you...” Cas trailed off and noticed Sam and Eileen has stopped their conversation and were now watching himself and Charlie. Charlie was now stood with her arms folded, tapping her foot on the floor. She raised her eyebrow, seemingly waiting for more answers from Cas. Answers she was sure to get sooner or later. Charlie was about to speak up once more but was cut off by Sam.
“I know he can,” Dean heaved out, his voice cracking as he spoke, “I just feel helpless. I want to protect him from that son of a bitch and I know Cas is no damsel in distress but...I’d do anything for him...To keep him safe.”
“You ever seen something so beautiful?” Castiel asked, resting his head on Dean’s shoulder and pointing up at the star, as it shot across the night sky leaving a trail of sparkling silver in its wake.
Anyways I hope you enjoy this chapter as things are about to get tense...
“Seriously Dean?” he groaned. “What?”
Cas was slightly lost in his thoughts when he felt a firm hand on his shoulder. He quickly turned his head to see Dean hovering next to him. His deep green eyes staring into Cas’s own blue eyes. There was a mild stench of alcohol coming off of Dean, and Cas was unsure about how much his friend had drunk.
Dean and Cas share a few home truths, whilst Lucifer revels in his new situation.
This is the last update I'll post before Christmas, so I just want to say I hope that everyone who celebrates Christmas has a Merry Christmas! And if you don't I hope you have a great day!
“What--why?” Castiel asked, searching Dean’s face as though the answer would be written across it.
Charlie noticed Dean’s demeanour and to stop him spiralling, she went over and attempted to console him.
“You should go together,” Dean suddenly said in a blunt manner waving his finger between them both, before taking a sip of his coke. Sam and Eileen both turned to Dean, bewildered by his comment. Both of their cheeks started to turn rouge. Charlie also sharply turned her head to Dean, furious that he’d seemingly ruined her well thought out plan. Cas placed a hand on her arm to calm her down.
Cas surprisingly was yet to see Lisa tonight even though Anael, a friend of his, was certain that she would be there.  He wondered what Dean’s reaction would be when he saw her, if they’d make a scene or even end up leaving together. It wasn’t that he was jealous or anything- Cas just didn’t think they were a good match, none of their friends did. Dean was never happy when he and Lisa were together and they had rarely seen him. Nights like this were a regular occurrence before Lisa came along, and Cas was happy that they were back to how things use to be. His mind began to wonder if Dean would genuinely try get back with Lisa if he saw her again. Cas was unsure of the reasons behind their break up, but he still didn’t think Dean was over it.
“Yes, you seem to have caught on,” Lucifer cackled, “A curse so strong everyone will think he’s dead and then I shall be finally free of the wretched boy.”
Go back to Castiel.
“Mirror, Mirror on the wall...Who in this land is the most handsome of all?”
The King slouched back in his chair, a wry smile spreading across his lips as he took a sip of the wine.
Dean helps Cas escape
“It’s nice here. Feels like a proper home.”
Lucifer leant forward and picked up of a bottle of wine that was situated on the table in front of them. He carefully took the cork out and began to pour crimson liquid into a metallic golden goblet. Once had had finished filling up his cup, he turned his attention to Dean.
Anael ruffled Cas’s hair and flashed a smile back before walking back towards the counter. Cas looked down timidly before reaching into his pocket and carefully pulling out his phone. He unlocked it and went into his messages. Cas knew what he was going to say to Dean. He was following his head, like Anael had said. He just needed to set a few things straight.
“Now....”
Dean jolted his head down instantly. He knew that voice.
Anael’s chair scraped along the floor as she pushed it back to stand up, bringing Cas out of his trance.
Dean stayed silent for a minute, not really responding to Sam’s words of comfort or the hug- though he did appreciate both.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean’s eyes flickered to Charlie at her comment. He knew exactly where he would go and stay in the Castle, but he didn’t want anyone to follow or know. Dean just wanted to be alone.

Ahh I hope you enjoyed that, I really enjoyed writing this chapter. Especially basing Cas' journey into the forest off of the one from Disney's Snow White. Also the parallel of them sleeping in each others beds just came to me and I had to include it!
Crowely tried to hold back a laugh and instead scoffed upon his realisation that the huntsman had managed to trick the all-powerful King.
Dean gulped, choking back the truth.
“You know I’m not actively avoiding you,” he retorted, emphasising the word 'actively' by doing air quotations, “I just happen to have a lot more hunts to go on these days.”
“You’re going to tell the townspeople? As if they’d believe you, a known hunter, spreading rumours about their king!” Lucifer let out a laugh, “Besides, Winchester, you think I’m actually going to let you and your brother leave this mountain alive? I warned you if you didn’t carry my plan out what’d happen and you still betrayed me.”
“That’s no way to treat your king,” Lucifer replied, his smirk the only thing visible through the mist.
“Hey, this is your family now too,” Dean reassured him with the softest smile Castiel had ever seen, "You've got us."
Dean didn’t know how he managed to arrive where he did, but before he knew it, he was outside Castiel’s room. It was in an isolated part of the Castle, far away from any other company. A large ‘C’ was engraved on the door in a royal blue. Dean glanced around to make sure he was alone and once certain pushed open the door and entered the room. He carefully pulled the door shut behind him and then looked around. It was smaller than he’d assumed it would be and the only source of light came through a singular window. This wasn’t a room fit for a Prince.
“Seems you did too,” Castiel replied with a smirk.
“Just one thing,” Dean uttered into Castiel’s hair, pressing a kiss against the top of his head. “You.”
Dean closed his eyes and held the silver in his palm, squeezing it tightly. He took a second to gather his thoughts and project his wish before throwing his coin into the well and waited for the distinctive splash, as a signal to open his eyes again. Castiel did a similar routine, however he waited until he heard Dean’s coin land in the water before throwing his. After he had finished, he turned back towards Dean, who was already staring at him. Castiel pulled a face- eyebrows raised, cheesy grin, which Dean could already read.
Dean debated on whether he should reply to Charlie’s question but if they followed him, he could just show them. Besides, he didn’t have much time to spare-he wanted to see if he was right now. He couldn’t spend another moment without Castiel.
Castiel slumped back in his chair and chuckled, his eyes exploring the concern etched on Dean’s face.
Dean had started to take a drink out of his coffee but stopped at what Cas had said. Almost choking. He looked up.
“You’re safe, Cas. I promise.”
His optimistic thoughts should’ve made things better, taking the anxiety off his mind about the situation. But something still didn't feel quite right, he just couldn’t put his finger on it. The butterflies fluttered around in his stomach once more.
The title is inspired by The Fray's 'How to Save a Life,' which I recommend listening to a some point!
“Yeah, and.... I should finish cleaning up.”
Crowley swallowed a lump in his throat. He so badly wanted to lie. He wanted to protect the young Prince. But as part of his curse, the wretched curse of the magic mirror, he was unable to lie. Hesitantly, he shook his head in defeat.
“Dean, we need to clear some things up first,” he replied, leaning forward. His voice almost becoming a whisper, “I mean have you even considered the fact we’ll have to fake it in front of our friends? Your brother?”
Cas folded his arms across his chest and grunted, “Let me guess. You need me to cover for you when you leave with Lisa tonight. Instead of leaving with us,” he stated, scowling, “Yeah, well no, I’m not going to cover for you this time.”
There is definitely more angst to come in the coming chapters, but hopefully the pay off is worth it.
“You should go talk to him,” Charlie said, almost startling Dean who was in a haze, “You haven’t seen each other for a while and you definitely missed him on the hunt...” She trailed off as Dean turned back to face her, a small blush had crept across his cheeks which he tried to ignore.
Dean started to make his way over to the bed which was situated centrally. Trailing his fingers across the walls and a desk as he went. He almost fell onto Castiel’s bed when he reached it, his legs giving away from the stress that the day had brought him. He flopped back and gazed up at the ceiling that Castiel would’ve stared at so many times. A ray of sunlight peered through the window as the sun began to set upon the horizon. Dean was just going to lay here, and gather his thoughts together. Then he would find a way to sneak out of the castle so he could go back to his family.
Castiel lay in a glass coffin, in the centre of the village, where all his people could see and mourn him. The hunters had already brought him there, before Dean and Sam had arrived home from their encounter with Lucifer, so the two brothers had to trudge even further in their sodden clothes. Dean still didn’t really speak, no matter what Sam was saying to him. He was too shellshocked, too overwhelmed by everything. Dean just wanted to drink, just wanted to sleep and wake up to this whole week being a bad dream. But he knew it was real and there was nothing he could do.
And suddenly he was drawn back to reality by an impending feeling in his gut, that he was being watched. Cautiously he glanced around once more before catching the eyes of Lucifer who was stood at the window in his tower, glaring directly at him. A chill crept up the young prince’s spine and without any hesitation, he carefully placed the bird back onto the roof of the well. The gaggle that had crowded their all looked back at him confused but Castiel’s gaze was still firmly placed on his brother, who had now moved out of the window's main sightline as his presence had become known, but was still visible from behind a curtain.
Dean shook his head, and took another step away, down the stairs. He pulled the box from under his arm and squeezed it tightly, letting out his anger.
“I burnt it. Deep in the woods.”
Castiel found himself lost in his thoughts as Dean soon became a blurry figure on his mission. He’d become distracted when he definitely shouldn’t have.
“Go through the woods. Keep going. Past the river, over the tree stump until you find a clearing. There you’ll find a house. Go in and stay there,” Dean explained, pointing with an outstretched finger, his tone was firm and serious but he tried to soften his voice whilst giving Castiel clarity, “You should be safe in there and hopefully I’ll be there soon too.”
The disapproving expression that had spread across Cas’s face said it all. Cas had already been annoyed that he had left him to talk with Lisa in the first place and then he’d come over and told Cas something he probably never wanted to hear. Dean couldn't fully remember the rest but he wouldn't put it past himself to have then dug himself into an even deeper hole. In fact he had. Instead of waiting for Cas to reply to his first comment, he had blurted out that they could ‘flow with it’.
Love Leah <3
(See the end of the chapter for
“C’mon, I’ll help you find someone else.” Charlie’s lips curved up at Cas’s suggestion and she placed the shot glass down in front of herself.
Castiel tilted his head and rubbed a hand against his neck, “Uh, sure... I can try help you out.”
The apple tumbled out of his hand crashing to the floor and before long Castiel was there with it. He had collapsed into a heap in the doorway. His eyes fluttering closed. The last thing he heard before drifting off into his deep sleep was an evil, malicious laugh. It was one he seemed to recognise, that was so suspiciously familiar.
Castiel lie asleep on the floor. To anyone who came across him, the young Prince would appear dead. His brother, Lucifer, stood cackling over his body.
“I just want to...I want to see Lucifer and know what he did,” Dean heaved out almost exasperated, “I don’t even want to kill him myself... I... just need to know.”
“I know, I know. Just stay in the house and I’ll be safe,” he replied, “You’re like some doting mother hen.”
“I’m sure Cas will be fine, Dean,” he stated, a calming tone in his voice, “I know you worry about him, all the time. I do too, though I’m not sure it’s the same...but I am sure he can handle himself.”
“Mourn?” he questioned, before realising. “You do realise Castiel isn’t dead.”
“I’m sorry, you know I’m not good at apologising,” Dean replied and Cas could almost hear the puppy dog eyes he was certain Dean was pulling on the other end of the phone. Imagining that made Cas blush and he knew he couldn't stay mad at his best friend for a second longer.
So yeah sorry for all the angst but it will hopefully be worth it at the end!
Love Leah <3
“I didn’t say that...”
Thanks for reading the first chapter, I hope you enjoyed it and stick around for more.
Castiel rolled his eyes, faintly remembering their past conversations on this topic and decided to re hash the phrase he always responded with.
Dean wasn’t back after five minutes and he wasn’t back after ten either. Cas turned on his phone, assuming the queues for ordering must have been long and opened up a text conversation with his brother, Gabriel.
The begrudged face of Crowley suddenly appeared. He looked tired and his hair was ragged.
“My dear Crowley,” he said, reaching his hand out towards the glass, “Where would all the fun be in that?”
Castiel opened his mouth but before he could speak up the hunter had already disappeared, off into the distance. He had never seen Dean move so fast and Castiel found himself admiring the lean outline of the man. The way his shirt hung loosely off his back and how his...
“Can I not persuade you to drink anything exciting?” Dean asked, before lowering his head and grinning, “I hear they do a mean Sex on the Beach.”
“I should be seeing you soon, hopefully. Stay safe, Your Highness,” Dean said, taking one last look at Castiel. A sincere but almost self-indulgent glance. Taking it in, just in case it was the last time he would see him. Before Castiel could say anything else to keep him there, Dean turned and began to head off in the opposite direction.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Your Highness...you already know the answer...”
Charlie had said she could get them all some fake IDs sorted before the night, and Dean was certain she’d given them out already.
“If I ask you ‘the question’, will your answer have changed from this morning?”
Cas slowly glanced up at Dean and saw a mischievous smirk spread across his face.
“I won’t fall in love with you if every time you drink...” he trailed off before pointing to Dean’s upper lip, “...you do that.” There sat a line of frothy foam from his drink, which looked like a creamy moustache. It took a moment for Dean to realise what Cas meant but then his eyes lit up when it hit him sending Cas into laughter once more.
Dean glanced away for a second, tapping his foot on the ground.
“Ah, you see this specific apple boy, it is special,” he uttered, almost a purr to his voice, “It’s a wishing apple.”
A few days had passed since Castiel’s ‘death’ and Lucifer was revelling in the power and control he had. The peacefulness in the Castle had been a pleasure and his mind hadn’t run into over drive like it usually did, looking for ways Castiel maybe trying to bring about his downfall. He had also yet to tell the townspeople anything about his brother’s disappearance. He’d tell them soon, but they didn’t need to know anything yet. Especially as everyone would probably go into mourning once they found out and for the moment, he just wanted to forget that Castiel ever existed.
It was Sam.
Sorry that this chapter is a bit shorter than others, I was trying to categorise into chapters what I'd already written and felt like this ending was a good cut off point/cliff hanger.
“Do you not think I know that, Crowley? Do you think that low of me?” He exclaimed, “I have been planning this for so long and my dear brother said to me himself he will never have a true love. He will remain asleep forever.”
Gabe rolled his eyes and went back to typing on his laptop.
Castiel and Dean exchanged a look. A lingering look. Dean’s tongue wet the top of his lip whilst Castiel watched Dean’s evergreen eyes. Dean’s grip on Cas’s leg tightened as his eyes flickered down to Castiel’s mouth. Castiel tilted his head slightly and began to lean forward. They were mere inches apart.
As time passed by, the forest began to creep into even more darkness and Cas realised he’d preferably like to get to his destination before full nightfall. He rose up once more and brushed down his clothes. The squirrel jumped up onto his shoulder and Castiel chuckled as the bushy tail tickled his skin as it moved.
Dean shrugged.
“What are you doing, Dean?” Charlie asked, “We’ve been looking all over this Castle for you.”
“Nice to see you too, Charls,” Dean greeted in a playful manner, “Fly catching?”
Lucifer glared at his reflection in the mirror. He leant closer before pulling back his mouth to examine his yellow stained teeth. Then he licked his fingers and pushed back strands of his hair. After he had finished grooming himself, a shadowy face appeared in the mirror. It was the face of a man, full of disgust and dissatisfaction. The man’s hair was messy and he had a scruffy unkept beard. He let out a loud sigh before focusing his gaze on Lucifer.
Charlie extravagantly pointed at Sam and Eileen who both raised a hand in greeting, as she continued to chatter away.  Castiel raised his eyebrows and smiled back but was unable to speak due to the amount of food in his mouth. Castiel found it funny how he’d thought Sam looked so familiar earlier but had failed to put two and two together. Sam really did remind him of Dean, mannerisms and all. Castiel couldn’t remember if Dean had ever mentioned having a brother before, even just in passing. He felt like a bad friend for not knowing and was beginning to realise he really didn’t know much about his best friend at all. Well, other than the fact he was a hunter and he had the most beautiful green eyes Castiel had ever seen. Eyes which sometimes he could just get lost in, staring into a virescent sea. Or the fact Castiel could always tell when Dean was nervous, as he’d run his hand through his silky brown hair and let out a small chuckle. So, maybe he did know some things about Dean, just not the most important things. Or maybe he just found his best friend mildly attractive.
Cas nodded slowly, realising what Dean was talking about and instead of joking back, Cas decided it was time they spoke business about the whole situation.
Castiel looked to the floor.
Charlie had leant forward resting her elbows on the table the wide grin plastered on her face. She eyed up Sam and Eileen before turning a new attention to Dean and Cas. “I mean, I’d presume you two are going together,” she said with a glimmer in her eye.
“I mean we can, but not right now. I’ve got to get these back to the castle or Lucifer will not be pleased,” Castiel said and before he could continue Dean cut in.
“Uh...Hello Dean.”
Dean groaned even louder as the memories came back to him. He reached over to his bedside table and felt around for his phone almost knocking over a glass of water. He picked the phone up and turned it on and was slightly disappointed to see no new messages. His text conversation with Cas was still open, but the only recent activity had just been him spamming Cas’s name in a drunken state in hope that his friend would reply.
Castiel shook his head, placing his cup down in front of him. He made sure he flashed Dean a reassuring smile.
"Hey, don't worry," he called out in a friendly voice, “I’m not going to hurt you.”
It wasn’t long until they came across a clearing. An open meadow full of flowers, barley and long grass that swayed in the cool evening breeze. The sun peered over the horizon as it set, basking the distant hills in a golden glow. Castiel's lips perked up in awe and then he turned in the opposite direction. It was there where he noticed the house. The one Dean had told him about. It was bigger than he’d imagined, but it still looked homely and cosy. It had a straw thatched roof and there was smoking billowing out of the chimney. Castiel beamed after noticing it. He glanced over at the deer and nodded in a signal of thanks before barrelling towards the building.
“Lisa begs to differ.”
“Hi, I’m things.”
Lucifer’s hands began to tremble as he placed the ingredients into the pot. He raised his voice as he continued to repeat the spell. Slowly, things were starting to change. His hair began to turn grey, his skin wrinkled up and his voice started to croak. A cloak shrouded over his shoulders, hiding his face which Crowley was thankful for as he didn’t want to see the monstrosity that Lucifer was becoming. At least his looks would now match who he really was. Definitely not the most handsome in the land, but the perfect disguise.
“You don’t need to worry about me, I’m the best hunter in the land,” Dean said, his tone almost making it sound like a joke. He turned back towards Castiel, this time he was trying to catch his attention, “Hey, look I’m fine- you don’t need to worry, I promise.”
“Who are you?” Dean asked, his stance was still one of a protective nature despite not having anything to protect himself with.
Dean wakes up hungover, the night before slightly hazy.
It was early morning and the sun lay low in the sky. The breeze outside was cool and the flowers in the Palace gardens swayed. It may’ve been early but Castiel had already completed all his chores for the day. He’d started on them almost as soon as he had awoke and was now staring into the well once more, surrounded by his feathery friends. He was waiting for Dean.
Dean’s words were finally starting to sink in. He had to go for his safety, but he was having to leave his people behind. He was leaving them under his brother’s terrifying reign and without him being there to stop Lucifer, there were no limits to the harsh laws he could impose. It hurt Castiel to know he was leaving a town full of defenceless people under the rule of a tyrant and more so that they would be mourning him whilst he was still alive.
There was a silence for a few seconds that lingered in the air and Castiel daren't look at anyone in case the response was negative. But Sam eventually spoke up to clear the air. Sam who knew Dean better than anyone.
Dean was trying to sneak another glance at Castiel, to see if his attempt at a joke had amused the Prince but he didn’t want to seem too obvious. His heart didn’t use to pound like this around his best friend or if it did, he hadn’t noticed before.
Castiel gulped.
Just want to put a Trigger Warning for talks of plotted murder!
Dean shoved Castiel playfully in return.
“Sleeping. The Prince is sleeping, not dead,” Crowley explained, “He has been cursed like I was.”
“Good question. Perhaps they don’t have to know Castiel is dead quite yet...they can just know he has gone a way for a while,” Lucifer paused, “Question for you, Where’s the rest of the body?”
Lucifer shrugged, “I’m in a good mood.”
Dean looked away from Sam, attempting to hide the pink blush that had crept over his cheeks.
“My wish came true...from the well that day.... actually, it’s been the same wish for years,” Castiel admitted, to which Dean raised his eyebrows slightly puzzled. Cas exhaled before continuing, “I spend my days at the well-wishing I could be happy, that someone would love me... that you in particular would love me back and when I ate what I thought was a ‘magic apple’ all I could think about was you. I went to sleep dreaming of you.”
Castiel hung back near the window, still unable to see where the commotion was coming from.
Cas smiled and took a moment before typing his response.
Castiel still didn’t move.
“Yeah, I think I can,” Cas replied and without even thinking, “Is Dean invited too? Um...I mean can he be involved in this whole get-Sam-and-Eileen-together malarky?”
“You know the way?”
He lingered at the fence for a second when he saw his worst fear come to life. Castiel lay on the floor, motionless. He looked so pale. His arm was outstretched towards an apple which had rolled away. Dean instantly knew what had happened when he saw a bite had been taken out of it. He’d been poisoned. Dean cursed under his breath. He knew this was all Lucifer’s doing. Dean cautiously made his way over to Castiel’s body and before he even realised, he’d dropped to his knees beside him.
Castiel raised his eyebrows and pulled a face which read as ‘I know, I know,’ causing Dean to laugh even more. Dean stepped back and glanced at the birds on the roof, they were all staring at him attentively. Observing Dean from a distance to judge his character and make sure he was safe for Castiel to be hanging around with.
The group burst into hysterics once more, and even though he felt awkward and bit uncertain, Castiel smiled along with them before pushing himself up and reaching down for his boots. He was leaning so far over the side of the bed, that he was conscious about how careful he’d have to be so he didn’t fall off the edge. The awkwardness that had just disappeared would certainly come back if he ended up in a heap on the floor.
At that moment his phone began to ring, it startled him and he frantically reached towards it. He was only a little bit disappointed to find Charlie was the one calling him. Cas had assumed it’d be Dean.
Castiel reluctantly looked back at Dean and sighed, knowing his friend was right. Dean flashed him a playful smirk.
“We can moan at Cas for being late, but my brother isn’t here yet either,” he stated, Eileen nodding coherently. Charlie rolled her eyes before sliding back into the booth and patting the space next to her for Cas to sit down too. Cas followed and looked ahead out of the large diner windows; he was surprised none of them had noticed Dean’s impala which was clearly parked outside. Cas could feel Charlie’s eyes on him but she had yet to look in the same direction.
“You finally called me by my name,” he commented, his voice gruff.
Before Cas went to bed, he made sure to text Dean about the plans for the next day.
Cas didn’t feel like replying to Gabriel anymore so instead placed his phone into his pocket before pushing himself out of the booth. He turned to Eileen and Sam to tell them where he was going. They were sat as close to each other as they possibly could and it appeared that Eileen’s head was resting on Sam’s shoulder as they both intently gazed at something on Sam’s phone. It didn’t seem like they would notice his absence, so Cas decided to continue to where Charlie was without making a fuss. He made sure to avoid eye contact with where he presumed Dean and Lisa still were.
He wondered who else resided here and where they were now. On another hunt perhaps? Helping Dean out with his plan? Castiel wondered if they even knew about the situation Dean was in, or if Dean had even told them about their friendship.
“I’ve also heard it is one of the sweetest apples around. Divine,” The man continued, “So why don’t you take a bite?”
“You know, I thought maybe you were avoiding me today,” Castiel finally said, a bit later, to Dean.
Thank you for reading,
“He’s not going to hurt me, guys” Castiel said to them, tilting his head slightly, “He may look big and scary but really he’s a softie.”
It was too late when it dawned on him that he had been tricked. When he realised it wasn’t a lost, old beggar he had just helped out. The last thing Castiel’s mind went to was Dean. It always went back to Dean. And then everything went black.
“Are you back?”
"Hair as dark as ebony and lips like a pink rose. Eyes as blue as the ocean and a heart of angelic gold. Everybody in the land loves him, because he is the sweetest of all. The fairest. The most handsome in the land. It is Castiel...”
“So, are you ready to tell them, about ‘us’?” Dean said using air quotations just like Cas had done previously. He ran a hand through his hair, pushing it backwards whilst waiting for Cas’s response.
Sam trailed off, not wanting to push too much.
“Do you really think I am that interested in a hunting trip?” Lucifer asked, his tone bitter and stern, “Do you really think that’s what I want to talk to you about?”
“If I tell you, it doesn’t come true.”
Dean blinked trying his best to keep his gaze focused upon the Prince. There was so much he wanted to say, so much he couldn’t. The pain and confusion spread across Castiel’s face hurt Dean and he wanted more than anything to be able to tell him everything was going to be okay. But he didn’t even know if it ever would be.
“So, the school dance is coming up soon...” she stated with a smirk her gaze flickering around the table. Cas realised this was the starting motions of her plan. “Who is everyone going with?”
“Do tell.”
I'm sorry for the upcoming angst that is coming up....just be prepared.
“Maybe you’re just a bit impatient.”
He swallowed down his food, almost too eager to respond to Sam’s statement.
Love Leah <3
“Sorry about that, I spoke to Dean about something and then left.”
“I don’t think you’ve ever asked,” Castiel replied, before pausing and shifting his gaze back into the well. “I’m not quite sure. I just like it here and it makes me feel happy. Also, did you know it’s a wishing well? It's a cool well.”
“Hello? Is anyone home?” Came a voice. It was croaky and barely audible.
Dean clenched his fists together whilst telling the story, his nails digging into his palms. Castiel listened attentively, his jaw dropping, shocked by the lengths Dean had gone to prove this, to make his death seem legitimate. The lengths he was going to keep Castiel safe.
“Under no circumstances can we actually fall in love with each other.”
“How will you last a month without falling in love with me?” Dean teased once more with a wry grin, taking another mouthful of his coffee. Cas tilted his head but couldn’t hide the smile that had found its way to his lips.
“No?”
He wasn’t surprised to find the front door unlocked when he arrived. It was part of Dean’s plan to let him stay there and well it was Dean, he probably forgot to lock the door most days anyway. The fire still being lit was a nice surprise, it had warmed the house up and Castiel noticed a pot of soup still cooking, hanging over the flame pit. The aroma drew Castiel in and he closed his eyes with a grin, hoping it tasted as good as it smelt.
“I’ve just lost the person I love,” Dean replied, fairly blunt. His voice void of any emotion, “I don’t think I’ll ever be alright again.”
They began to chirp, to jump, to sing harmoniously to him. Castiel watched on bemused, letting out a small chuckle, before stepping slightly closer to them and carefully holding out his index finger. The birds didn’t seem to be scared of him, in fact they seemed comfortable in his presence. Safe.
“As a thank you gift,” the man stated, “And to apologise for taking up your time.”
Castiel rolled his eyes, “Was it not you who suggested we catch up later? I must've been mistaken..”
The grass waved in the wind. Birds were soaring through the sky above. Dean was there.
And before Sam even had time to react, Dean was darting through the forest. As fast as he could. As fast as he ever had before. Sam was following behind, but was struggling himself to keep up.
Cas carefully picked up a napkin, leant across the table and wiped off the remnants of drink from Dean’s face.
“We should try to find something, before it gets too dark and we have to go back,” he paused for a second, watching his brother contemplate his words, “And you should tell Cas.”
“You actually did it,” Lucifer commented, observing the organ, “I didn’t believe you had it in you.”
Charlie just laughed and winked at Dean, wishing him well.
Castiel almost dropped the bowl he was washing. He took a double take. Blinking hard and shaking his head, assuming his mind was playing a cruel trick on him. Castiel closed his eyes and slowly reopened them.
“A-are yo...are you sure?” Dean managed to say, though his words were barely audible.
Sam nodded, understanding Dean’s words.
The blanket smelt like Dean and Castiel smiled, gripping it tightly.
Dean tilted his head, trying to catch Castiel’s eye once more.
Love, Leah <3
“I mean...I could have...maybe...” Dean paused as he noticed the look of disapproval spread across Charlie’s face. In the end he just reluctantly shook his head.
Dean pulled his car into a bay at the parking lot. It was a large, black Chevrolet Impala, which he would label as his prized possession. A car he’d worked on with his father before the man had walked out on him and his brother’s lives. She meant a lot to Dean and there weren’t many things in the world he loved more than her.
Cas looked down into his own mug and began to stir his spoon.
Dean rolled his eyes.
Lucifer had been watching his brother’s endeavours from the day on the Magic Mirror. Crowley had told him his behaviour was weird and concerning. Lucifer then had threatened Crowley that he’d never give him a way to get out of the mirror if he didn't shut up. Crowley stayed silent from then on.
“I just want to say again how sorry I am...” Dean said, trailing off, “For leaving you to go talk to Lisa and for what I said to her, and probably for other things I can’t even remember.”
Castiel peered into the well and his reflection beamed back at him like a mirage in a desert. Glimmering in the midday sun. He lifted his head slowly and looked around at his surroundings in the Palace courtyard. The trees swayed gently in the cool breeze and the blooming flowers painted a pretty picture. The group of birds were focused on watching Castiel’s every move, almost in awe of him. Castiel carefully pushed himself up from the floor, shifting his attention to the audience he had in around him.
Castiel smiled at the man, who in turn tamely smiled back.
“Okay. Okay. You’re forgiven dumbass.”
“I’m not sure yet.”
“He does know you’re the Prince, right? You do know you don’t have to do this stuff for him."
Cas rolled his eyes. His brother had not shut up about how boring all of Cas’s plans had sounded. Going on about how wasting money on getting yourself intoxicated was not a fun way to spend a Friday night. Cas wondered where Gabriel had even gotten this impression from because it certainly wasn’t experience. He and Anael were Gabriel’s only friends and as Gabriel’s brother he probably didn’t really count. So, Gabe’s list of friends was really a mere one person.
Content warning for blood again.
I hope you enjoy it <3
“You could come to me, your brother, for advice one day, you know?” Gabe said as Cas and Anael moved to a nearby table. Cas just chuckled under his breath, remembering all the bad advice his brother had given him over the years. It always came in the form of some weird analogy or metaphor and then Gabe would try use the situation in his new book idea. Cas knew his brother meant well, but he felt much more comfortable getting advice from Anael.
His best friend Dean, with his ruffled brown hair and his striking green eyes. Dean was strong physique and his holster which he always had on his person, storing his dagger and wearing it with pride. Dean who, despite being a ruthless hunter was the kindest person Castiel had ever known.
Dean raised an eyebrow and looked over to see that, sure enough, Cas had hold of his ID. Dean took it off him and flashed Cas a smile. The bouncer sighed and lifted up the rope to let the two boys in.
Dean stood outside the gigantic wooden Castle doors. He peered up at them, intimidated by the magnitude of the place, which he’d rarely seen up close. All he could focus on was the pounding of his heart and the rush of blood in his ears. There was blood splashed over the top of Dean’s dagger and some dried on his sleeves. His hands which were shaking as he held onto the box Lucifer had given to him. A few guards appeared to escort him inside and Dean did his best to hide the splattered mess, to not raise any suspicions.
Lucifer continued, “It’s just I need to borrow Mr Winchester from you Castiel. We need to discuss the success of his recent trip.”
“That is a pig's heart, Your Highness,” he exclaimed/
“I was going to...eventually...I just forgot...”
“Oh, cool, cool,” she finally replied before changing the topic, “Right, so you know we spoke about getting Sam and Eileen together, well I have a plan.”
Crowley heaved out a heavy breath, causing the glass to steam up.
Writing Dean and Cas interactions makes me all happy, until I realise we could've had it all in the show and then they just silenced them :(
Dean kicked the floor in frustration when he arrived at Castiel’s coffin. It was his job to protect Castiel, to keep him safe, to keep him alive. Dean had promised Castiel he would be fine, yet here he lay. Dean had failed and he would never forgive himself for that. He took a deep breath and placed a hand on the top of the glass, right above Castiel’s heart.
“So, you woke me up huh?” Castiel stated, raising an eyebrow.
“No,” Dean cut in, “I’m doing it because I... cause you’re my best friend. It’s a given.”
“Nice song,” he stated, almost startling Castiel, who’s face turned from confusion to an embarrassed grin within seconds. Castiel glanced away in an attempt to hide the blush that was creeping onto his cheeks.
Dean was marching across the clearing towards the house. He looked out of breath and it was clear he’d rushed there. Castiel carefully placed the bowl he was cleaning in the wash basin and made his way to the door, which he pulled open but didn’t move far from. Instead, he decided to linger in the doorway. Castiel watched on as Dean’s family greeted him, they’d clearly been worried about Dean as well, maybe as much as Castiel himself had been. Bobby patted Dean on the back, whilst Jody and Donna pulled him into a tight hug. Castiel smiled and pulled his own arm across his torso. It was nice for him to see a group of people like this. A group who cared about each other so much, especially when it had been the opposite for him all of his life. It was refreshing to see a group of people that were like family.
“I know, Dean. But I enjoy helping out, doing my part and seeing the people of this wonderful village,” Castiel's eyes lit up as he spoke, and it made Dean about the encounter he’d witness between Castiel and the young girl earlier. Castiel would make a much better king than Lucifer and everyone in the town knew it. One brother cared about all of his people and loved to spend time with them, whilst the other acted like none of them existed and only appreciated the power that came along with his title.
Dean threw his head back and laughed at Castiel’s comments.
Lucifer impatiently prowled around his lair, walking back and forth and back and forth. The constant clicking of his heels against the marbled floor soon became too much for Crowley, who Lucifer had summoned for help.
“Wait what?”
At the word ‘wishing’ Castiel raised his eyebrows. He was intrigued. It made him think of his wishing well which he missed dearly. He twiddled the apple around in his hand once more, and smiled. His smile full of uncertainty but also awe.
“Woah,” Castiel whispered, “I didn’t realise they were real.”
He heaved out a heavy sigh and made his way over to a large and lonely boulder that wasn’t too far away from where he had been stood. Dean perched himself on the rock and was startled by his brother's appearance beside him, almost falling straight back off it. He glared at Sam, who let out a small chuckle.
“I think you’re a good actor,” Dean observed in relation to the situation. Cas looked back puzzled. “Which...is a good thing if we want to make this seem real.”
His screams echoed around the valley for a few moments before they stopped. Then there was silence.
Dean shot his head up and for the first time held eye contact with Lucifer.
Dean shrugged, “I guess so.”
Cas shook his head with a little laugh, “I mean we can’t pretend we’re dating forever. Besides once Lisa is jealous, you’ll win her back easily.”
Castiel kept his head down as he wandered aimlessly through the woods. The air was shrill and bitter, and the path ahead was dark and ominous. The leaves rustled in the trees and the wind would whistle and howl above. Water trickled down in a stream beside him, so there was never complete silence. Castiel appreciated this because nothing was as he’d pictured it would be. The forest was a lot more terrifying in person, nothing like the ideas he had created in his mind, and the situation he was in was scarier still. Nothing was as he assumed it would be. Never did he think he’d be on the run, with a target above his head. Never did he think his brother would order for him to be killed. Order his best friend to kill him.
“It was nice,” he stated bluntly, “I spent time with the birds and cleaned outside like you asked. Then I went to do the shopping and spent time with our people, who really are a lovely bunch...”
“Tell me.”
“I’m probably the only boring person you know,” came Cas’s response, he had to speak up a little to make himself heard.
The dark clouds continued to circulate above them and now small drops of rain had begun to fall. Dean clenched his fists and stepped forward, taking one last weary look at Cas, before marching forward. He wasn’t entirely sure where he was going, but he knew who he was looking for and was certain they couldn’t be too far away.
Dean came to a halt before he reached the edge. He looked out over it into the surrounding valleys and hills. He let out a shaky sigh. Castiel would have loved this view.
When he arrived in the courtyard, he slowed down once more. The place was ominous at night and empty. Everyone had gone home, Castiel was the only one left. He lay in his glass coffin, looking the same as he had before- the moon now glistening off the glass, reflecting back into the night sky. Dean approached cautiously, trailing his shaky hand over the coffin as he moved closer. Dean crouched down and unlocked the clasp to pull back the lid, carefully pushing it back, making sure he didn’t break it just in case....
(See the end of the chapter for
Also I hate Lucifer so so much, so I'm making him into the biggest ass in this.
“Yes, you do.”
“I’m sorry, we just needed to get a way,” Dean finally puffed, his breath shaky and his voice no louder than a whisper. Dean glanced around once more before turning back to Castiel. He found Castiel’s sapphire eyes already fixed on his face and instead of letting go of Castiel’s wrist, Dean reached out and latched onto the other one as well.
And Dean was still there.
Anael leant forward in her chair whilst taking a sip from her cup, “So, what’s playing on your mind today?”
What will Dean do now? And do wishes come true? (Lucifer's might..)
There were now more sounds coming from the surrounding area. Castiel smiled as he noticed the arrival of each creature and paid intricate attention to each specific sound. The flapping wings of birds who started to land in the trees nearby. The hoot of an owl, old and wise, peering down at Castiel from the safe realms of his nest. Then there was the scampering paws of a squirrel scurrying around on the tree trunk behind him. The final sound was the clicking of hooves from a deer, who looked on from a short distance away. Castiel spun around, noticing all the animals and grinned. He felt at ease once more.
Love Leah <3
“And what about you two?” Charlie asked, her hands moving to sign her words. Cas was thankful that Charlie’s attention was now solely towards Sam and Eileen, “Got any plans for the dance?”
I want to apologise for the fact I feel this fic gets worse with every chapter I write, but I've already written so much so it's too late to turn back. Also it's not beta read so if there is any grammar errors I apologise.
Dean pushed the door open to Anael’s café and glanced around. He'd arrived as soon as he could, running over as he still felt too tipsy to drive. His hair was still slightly wet from a shower he'd had and he'd thrown on the closest t-shirt he could find, which didn't seem to fit him properly. Dean noticed Cas sat on a table with two steaming cups placed in front of him. He was in deep conversation across the room with Anael who was stood at the nearby counter. Cas had seen Dean enter and gave him a polite wave, ducking his head whilst doing so. Dean made his way over to him and pulled out the chair. Cas promptly ended his conversation with Anael and turned to face Dean, either not noticing or deciding not to comment on the rugged state Dean was in. Cas's expression was bland and difficult to read, so Dean flashed him a grin in attempt to cheer him up. Instead it caused a light blush to creep over Cas’s cheeks which he tried to hide it with a frown, but Dean knew Cas too well and just wiggled his eyebrows in turn.
Dean nodded, and then watched as Castiel pushed himself up off the wall before picking up his basket, lacing his fingers around the handle. Castiel turned back to Dean, noticing his gaze and smiled.
Lucifer drummed his nails against the table top.
“Don’t worry, Mr Winchester. This is our secret,” he stated, nonchalantly, “I know how hard this must’ve been for you. You two were...close. Why don’t you go see yourself to a room in my Castle for tonight? It’s late and it’s the least I can do to repay you.”
“I bid you farewell, Master Winchester,” Castiel chuckled, as he jokingly rolled his wrist as though he was about to bow in front of Dean. At this Dean jumped up himself and bowed in jest to his friend.
Hey! I hope you guys are enjoying this so far, this chapter is a bit longer than others and I hope it isn't too much!
“Oh, yeah?” Dean asked, peering over the top of his mug, “What is it?”
“Are you not going to answer my question?” Lucifer asked, his back now turned to the mirror, but his impatience clearly growing.
Cas had been surprised to find Dean at his door when he was about to set off to Benny’s. They hadn’t planned on arriving together but Dean had leant against Cas’s porch and with a wink claimed he’d wanted to be ‘chivalrous.’ Cas was surprised Dean even knew what the word meant. But he had eventually agreed that Dean had the right idea. If they really wanted to make people believe that they’re together, they had to act like a couple. Plus, a lift to Benny’s with Dean was a much better prospect than having to walk there alone.  And secretly Cas always enjoyed rides in Dean’s impala. He likes how it smells.
Crowley felt helpless in his mirror. All he could do was watch Lucifer plot and conspire. It was worse than that, his curse meant he actively had to help. He could not lie to his master.
Lucifer raised his eyebrows slightly before letting out a cynical scoff.
Dean placed down his glass.
Dean pulled away from his hug with Donna and Jody, and whilst doing so he caught a glimpse of Castiel in the doorway. He smiled to himself, pleased that his plan had clearly worked and Castiel had managed to get here safely. The men held eye contact for a brief moment before Dean started moving again. Walking towards Castiel at speed. Once he reached the door, Dean let out a heavy breath which he had clearly been holding onto, before then wrapping his arms around Castiel, pulling him into an almighty embrace. Castiel was overwhelmed and it took a second to process everything before he grabbed hold of Dean in return, burying his head into Dean’s shoulder. They stayed there for a few minutes in silence, taking in the moment. Just the two of them.
Dean let out a disapproving hum under his breath.
Carefully Lucifer picked the object up off his desk. He rubbed the top of it carefully and grinned to himself. Then he turned back to the mirror and presented the item to Crowley. The room was desolate and dark, dimly lit by a single flame but Crowley could just about make out the object Lucifer was holding in his direction.
“One Coke coming up for the most boring person in the room. The most boring person I know,” Dean joked, quite loudly, stepping back from the table and almost tripping over his own feet.
Dean gestured up and down at his body to emphasise his point and highlight that he was absolutely fine. In one piece, as Castiel would often say to tease him. Castiel found his eyes lingering over Dean's body for longer than they should've and so he chuckled to cover it up. Castiel then nodded his head and awkwardly pointed behind them to the kitchen sink where he had spent most of his day.
“Shit,” he mouthed to Charlie and began to duck down, almost resting his head against the rather dirty table to make sure he was hidden. Charlie frowned at him, confused.
“A month.”
Castiel blushed slightly at the compliment but took it with a nod. He leant on the door frame, resting his hand on the door in preparation to bid the elder goodbye but instead of departing the man reached into his basket. It took him a while to fumble through it but eventually he pulled something out. A bright red apple which he held out in the palm of his hand in Cas’s direction.
Castiel reached out towards Dean’s arm to comfort him. Dean flinched away.
“Cas,” was all he said, not a ‘
A baby robin, with a bright red chest and a dainty black beak, made the jump from the roof of the well to Castiel’s outstretched finger.
And they all lived happily ever after :)
Dean perched himself on the edge of the booths seat, next to Cas. Cas shuffled over a bit to make space, before questioning if that was the right move. After all they were supposed to be dating, personal space was a myth for couples. And a myth for Sam and Eileen.
Charlie threw her arms up in exasperation and all Cas could do was smile apologetically.
Two plans are set in motion.
And he had helped save him.
“Something’s wrong....” it took a split second before clicking, but horror suddenly fell upon Dean’s face.
The man pivoted slightly, gesturing at the many pathways that could be taken in the forest. Castiel raised his eyebrows and nodded, understanding what was being asked and understanding how confusing the journey to the village could be.
Dean sighed and started to make his way over to Lucifer who stood there, pleased with himself. Dean raised a reluctant hand up to Castiel, to say bye, which he mimicked in response.
Castiel wasn’t certain but he thought he could see the man smile at his willingness to help him.
For the first time in a while, he felt safe.
Lucifer ignored him, of course. He was too deep in his own thoughts, plotting and planning. Over the years he had become increasingly jealous of his younger brother, Castiel. Envious of his brothers looks, worried about how the townspeople seemed to be more appreciative of him and anxious, that one day Castiel would steal his crown and his power. Lucifer could not have Castiel be ‘the fairest in the land’ for much longer. It was driving him insane.
Cas made sure he added quotation marks around us.
In some attempt to fix the situation. It didn't and Cas left the bar shortly after.
“Let’s...” Dean started, before pulling his gaze away from Castiel and looking into the well, “Let’s see if this wishing works.”
Cas was certain he heard Dean quietly cheer.
“That you’ll be safe there?" he shrugged. “It’s where I live.”
Dean nodded with a smile before turning away. Upon catching a glimpse of Lucifer, Dean frowned. He followed him across the courtyard, up a number of stairs and into the Castle. Every now and then he glanced back at Castiel who was still at the wishing well, singing to the birds.
Sam swallowed hard but took his brothers words in and turned back to go collect the others. Dean kept running, all he could hear was the sound of his heart pumping heavily in his chest. He hopped over tree roots and almost struggled to keep his balance over the slippery cobbled pathways throughout the woodland. He could see the clearing coming up ahead, but he was already struggling to breathe. There was a pain in his abdomen, but he pushed on-ignoring it. All he could focus on was getting to Castiel. Seeing that he was okay. Time felt like it was going slower the closer he got.
“Oh hello, young man,” he said upon Castiel’s presence. The man looked Castiel up and down before speaking once more, “I’m awfully sorry to bother you but I seem to have gotten lost, I was wondering if you could direct me on my way.”
The King ventured into his lair, speeding up the spiralled staircase, throwing open the door. He smiled to himself when he noticed the box was still sat on the table and then turned to face the mirror.
Everything suddenly seemed to stop for Dean. His ears were ringing. His heart was racing. His breathing unsteady. Dean gripped his own wrist tightly, pinching himself at though this could be a bad dream that he could simply wake up from.
