Dean rolls his eyes and tears the post-it off the fridge, throwing it in the trash. He sits down at the dining room table and opens the bottle, swigging a few gulps down before placing the iced vegetables on his stinging knuckles.
-homophobia (eli is a bitch. John Winchester is a bitch. Eli's dad is a bitch. Dean Winchester is internally a bitch, to himself.)
"Well," Castiel starts, looking down and smiling wider. "Did you know that bees have two stomachs? One of them is for storing nectar, or water, and the other is for eating."
After all, Enochian was a fragile language that didn’t always translate perfectly to English. This was even more present when the print was even sloppier than Cas could write on a bad day. But more than that, the contents of this note were, simply put, baffling.
Sam walks into the kitchen and takes leftovers out of the fridge. "I'm reheating casserole for dinner. How many plates?"
(When he was in High School, he dated a girl named Cassie. She was gorgeous, dark curly hair that flowed to her leather-jacket covered shoulders and deep brown eyes that were full of a certain spark all the time. She fought for what was right, always working for charities and such.
Sam leaves the room, and the crumpled paper is returned properly into the trash can. He keeps an eye on both of the other two for the next few days, hopefully trying to notice any positive developments in their dynamic.
He scribbles some equations down on the paper, messing around with things that he would unfortunately have to pay for due to the fact John wasn't around; groceries, rent, electrical, plumbing, gas... The number sits pitifully at the bottom of the page.
-detailed panic attacks (dean has a panic attack which details an event of John Winchester being violent and aggressive)
And finally, everything seemed to puzzle and knit itself together just right, and Castiel felt a sense of peace that he’s never known before. He would describe it as if he was meeting something he should have known for a long time but never got the chance to.
Dean finds it sadistically funny that the universe decided to knock out both known abusive dads in this small shitty town, like in this very moment of life is exactly when it needed to happen. Not when Dean was younger, or before Eli got angry, but now. What was so significant about now?
"I heard," Sam says with an expression Dean's never seen before. He then smiles. "I'll pay. Don't get into another fight."
While Sam goes red in the ears, Jess grins with the delight of knowing an embarrassing secret. She turns to him while failing to stifle her giggles. "I most certainly did not know."
Dean shakes his head again, cutting the sentence off. His voice breaks. "I'm just so sorry, Sam. Mom wouldn't have wanted this for you."
Charlie hums and then keeps walking to the drink table. "He is awfully dreamy. Those eyes have to be one of the World's Seven Wonders."
The door behind Dean cracks open, both of them going silent. Please, Dean prays; please go back to sleep, baby. Don't let him see this monster, this vulnerability of a boy standing in front of the tall shadow of everything he hates about himself.
"You hear me? You fuckin' weirdo." Malicious laughter followed by another familiar sound that had to be a punch to the face. "You're just like the rest of them, aren't you?"
Dean nods slowly, breathing in the words and letting them stack themselves as armour underneath his rib bones. He wonders what his weakest link really is, if not everything Cas just mentioned.
It wasn't what he meant. If he said what he meant, the words would have come out as: "Please don't leave me with Dad. I don't know if I would survive it."
(Sam was not around. They had endured another one their “boy band breakups” as Cas’s new friend Bobby had put it, and had not been speaking to each other for the past two days, so far. Castiel chose to follow Dean around instead, because he can’t seem to find the heart to leave him alone. This was another thing that Castiel did not understand. But that is not the current point of discussion.)
The seagulls fly overhead to their nests, and as the waves crash, Dean can see them in his head. The blue overlapping the green, dancing together in harmony with the seashells and the kelp—and like the melody, Dean can hear that same whispering voice in his head.
"Dean," Castiel's expression melts into a soft smile. There definitely is a blush on his cheeks, which sparks the flame even more.
"I'm having fun," Castiel defends, but Dean can see the warmth in his eyes. He looks back over to Charlie. "I was invited here. I decided to go with consent."
“You wrote a poem of some sorts, Dean,” Cas starts. “It revealed some rather, personal ideas, per say, about me.”
Dean finishes his coffee. "I'm fine, Sam. Stop worrying so much, okay? I'm older than you are, bitch. I can take care of myself."
The message sinks in. Money, floating to the bottom of the barrel that is Dean's mind. John's death left them enough money—which means Sam would be able to go to Stanford.
"Well, I heard this song on the radio yesterday. It reminded me of you," Castiel says with a casual smile.
Okay I know a lot of you will be upset me over Cas' actions, but he doesn't really know how to deal with emotions like we humans do especially a relationship as its new to him, and I don't think its too far off from the show.  I was thinking of the alley scene when I wrote this.
Dean tightened his arms around the vampire when he thought about how he almost watched Benny get his head chopped off.  Benny looked down in concern.
Out of water and out of energy Dean could only lie there, his body broken and bleeding.  The fight didn’t last much longer and Dean felt Benny gently lift his head into his lap as he called his name.  Dean struggled to open his eyes and moaned in relief when Benny tore the gag off him.  Crowley knelt down next to him.
“So fucking tight Winchester.  Gotta say I’m surprised considering how busy you’ve been, the angel, the so called King and oh yeah.”  Drake said right up against Dean’s ear that he licked and whispered.  “Daddy dearest.”
“Fuck!” Dean wasn’t going to lose his angel; he screamed to himself. Dean turned and saw John’s fingers tense on the triggers and screamed. “No please!” His cry anguished as his gaze swept the room looking for anything to help, and then he saw it - the handle of John’s gun sticking out from beneath the throw rug, flung there when John had used the shock collar on him for the first time.
“So we find ourselves in a bit of a conundrum.”  Dean opened his mouth but Death put a hand up to stop him from interrupting.  “Did you realize the consequences when taking on that Mark Dean?”
“The muppet?” Dean asked, trying to get the guy to talk about anything, if to just stop… this… from happening.
Sam flushed in discomfort at being called out on his truly stupid decision, and Dean was glad to see even Cas glare at Sam. “No, learned my lesson.” Sam said. “That was a pretty stupid thing to do.” Sam admitted.
Until then… Metatron snickered at the antics of soulless Sam as he read the next book. Really, the boy was so much more interesting without his soul, pity that Dean, of course, against all odds, had managed to figure out a way to put it back.
Drake picked up Dean’s belt from the floor and started to whip Dean’s ass with all his demon strength behind every whack.  Dean screams were muffled and his eyes were rolling.  On the verge of passing out Dean cursed the fact that Drake was such a hack.  He shouldn’t have let Dean lose this much blood if he intended on keeping him around and now Dean was afraid he wouldn’t be able to hold out.
Triggers include Dean thinking about John attacking him, and of course Dean angst and low self worth.
So this was a long time coming huh?  I went back and forth a lot on who would actually be the one to kill John.  I narrowed it down to Dean or Sam as I wanted Sam to save Dean but I also wanted Dean to finally stand up to his father and end all the abuse, so having them both shoot and kill John at the same time I think worked really well.  I hope you enjoyed it.
Hi everyone, I hope everyone is healthy and happy.  This is another rough chapter for Dean.  Things will be going downhill for Dean for a few chapters but there will be a happy ending and characters who do not act like themselves will realize it, some sooner than later, so please stick with it.
So yeah that happened.  I know this is a bad one and please notice the new tag.   I've been going back and forth on whether to give a spoiler so you all don't go crazy or leave you in suspense and since my compulsive need for cliff hangers has already done a number on you I will just say, please note the new tag and its not what your thinking.  Too cryptic, sorry I don't want to give too much away.
Dean grinned and shook his head.  The reaper was a hard ass, but Dean knew that she was secretly happy that Death was taking time for himself now even if it left her holding down the fort.
“Fuck you!”  Dean snarled as he pulled once again on his restraints to see if there was any give.  The chains around his wrists were heavy but only a thick rope was used to attach them to the ceiling so he kept trying to find some give.  And he hurt, he hurt everywhere but he was pissed too.  This second rate demon had him by the balls and Dean wanted to kill him.
“So if I go back and die trying to save my family, I will be stuck here in this storm cloud from hell forever?”  Dean asked with dread.
“Yes that would be very unfortunate.”  Death agreed.  The thing is Dean you haven’t yet been united with the blade so now you are kind of stuck in this limbo.”
Dean blushed at the reprimand.  “Sorry.”  He said, opening the bag and inhaling, his eyes rolling back in pleasure.  “Try one?”  He offered to Tessa who hesitated a minute and then grabbed the bag and pulled one out.  She took a bite and the angry looked melted as she moaned in delight.
Sam started to list the ingredients they would need and fed up Dean slammed his hand on the table causing everyone to jerk in surprise.  “I said it wasn’t him.” Dean growled.  “Let’s move on.”
Of course, Dean would know exactly what Sam was thinking, Sam thought with a warm feeling.  “It was dad’s and mine, because, man, I really fucked up a lot, but it was never your fault,”  Dean said, once again reverting back to taking the blame, and Sam had to hold in a sob because Dean saying it was his fault and
Triggers include references to abuse, but nothing graphic, angst, angst and angst and some violence, but only to things.
After a werewolf hunt gone wrong Dean is led to believe Sam was killed and he attacks a bunch of werewolves.  He lets the Mark take control and Sam eventually stops him.  Dean goes to hug Sam but Sam flinches scared at what he saw and the crazy look Dean still has.
“I imagine if you stayed in limbo you would eventually go insane but honestly Dean other than Cain who is still alive, albeit a demon, this is unprecedented.  I simply do not know.”  Death explained.
They headed back to the motel after eating.  They were trying to figure out who could have brought John back and why.  Sam got that look on his face that meant he had a good idea.
Metatron sighed loudly in disgust as he read through the pages. These two were unbelievable. Their hero complex was beyond pathetic, and Dean — Dean. His protective instincts and damaged psyche were too much to handle sometimes, but Metatron needed information. So he pushed through the very real concern that his eyes might freeze in the midst of a perpetual eye roll and focused back on the pages.
“—Wait a minute.” Metatron said aloud to himself as he flicked through the pages rapidly, going back and re-reading a section. “That doesn’t make sense, the timeline is all wrong… What could possibly have happened here?” Metatron wondered as he leaned back. A large smile crept across his face. Oh there was something here all right. And he just needed to find out what.
Dean snarled and pushed himself up. He grabbed the First Blade, and with one quick slice, he dug out the crystal, hissing in pain but resolutely avoiding the free and heavy flowing of his blood dripping thickly onto the already ruined carpet below.
Triggers include a lot of derogatory words from John toward Dean, and of course John being a manipulative ass.
Dean kept repeating to himself watching as if from afar as Sam pushed his dad into a chair and started firing questions at John about how he is alive, how he got here, who resurrected him.
The angels had found a way to block Dean's prayers and phone calls/texts to Cas and Dean thought Cas was done with him.
Drake pulled Dean into his bedroom.  He hung Dean up by his wrists with his feet barely touching the floor.  Dean tried and failed to squirm away from Drake’s wandering hands as he cut and tore the clothes off of Dean.
Dean’s eye widened but he kept his mouth shut for once. It didn’t matter though — Dream guy was clearly pissed now. “You always fight, and fight, and fight.” He growled, jerking Dean’s head back by his hair to crush their lips together.
Rubbing at his eyes Sam saw a large glass with his favorite smoothie plopped down in front of him and Sam looked up in surprise having not even realized Dean had left the room.
Dean shuddered because this was so familiar.  How many times had John said the same thing while Dean was growing up, always saying it was Dean’s fault.  “Fuck you.” Dean swore as he tried and failed to break John’s hold on him.
Dream guy must have picked up on a few of Dean’s thoughts because he grinned and stepped closer, right into Dean’s personal space.
Also in this timeline they have not heard of the MOL yet.  Abaddon succeeded in getting the key and has had access to the bunker, which is where she has been getting all her knowledge.
Beside him, Castiel is completely silent. It's unnerving, really. He doesn't say a word, yet Dean can almost feel that the man is always thinking, thoughts overturning in his head like an axe to a grind. While it was curious, Dean didn't feel like he was at any discretion to ask for what the words swirling in his head were.
"He left some money," Bobby speaks up. He looks at Dean knowingly. "From his—we'll say expeditions."
They begin their trek down the street, with neither of them speaking many words. The silence is something that goes hand-in-hand with Castiel, Dean has realized. Never the quiet that screams, but a type of practiced silence that was associated commonly with those who spoke the most in their brains.
The kid no longer looked as young, although still younger than Dean. He was probably around Sam's age, which made it even worse to look at him. He was sniffling up snot as well as the sticky red blood, tears running down swollen, tired eyes. Dean noticed that while he had bruises on his cheekbones, the most painful injury looked to be his lip, which was swollen in two places rather than one.
It isn't a question. Dean pulls his hand back, trying to ignore the flush that's making him look cherry red. Something in his eyes darkens as he remembers Eli again, with his nose bent in an unnatural direction and his blood-stained teeth, his sweat-matted hair and his sobs—
Castiel nods quickly and rushes over to the window, unlocking it and pushing it upwards. "You go first."
Dean slowly grins and then puts his hand on Castiel's shoulder. "Come on, I'll show you around while Sam and Jess go do cheesy lovebird date things."
There's a droplet of sweat running down the base of his neck from his hair, disappearing into the white dress shirt that he's wearing. The blue tie is still wrapped around his neck, albeit loose and untidy.
He slowly takes the note out of his pocket. “While blackout drunk, I believe you... wrote me something.”
"I understand the general idea from watching other people," Cas nods. "But to be candid, I've never done a sparkler before. My family never celebrated the Fourth of July, my father was too busy."
The confusion on Sam's face is obvious. It's clear that whatever he had been thinking this was before is gone from his head and replaced with puzzlement. "Sorry, I'm not following. What does Castiel have to do with burgers?"
This glass jar has a shadow bigger than itself. Looking at it makes Dean feel the very animalistic urge to punch a hole through the wall, to rip open the plaster with his teeth (He doesn't have enough fucking money), to shout into an empty void until his throat is raw (Everyone will leave him, he deserves it), to kick something until all he feels is a throbbing leg (He'll never complete this goal. The sand in the timer will run out, just like it did with Cas, just like it will do with Sam leaving, just like—)
The mason jar finally disappears, and Dean falls into a peaceful rest. He hears the waves in his dreams. He sees the ocean.
And all at once, there was the most surreal feeling dwelling in Dean's head, burning and searing like all the fire in the world. He needed to hear Castiel talk, to hear him be less of an enigma, to hear him share stories and laugh.
The sparkler is beginning to die down, the bursts of light growing smaller and closer to Castiel's hand, so Dean reaches over and grabs a bucket of water that was on the sand. It already has several burnt out roman candles sticking up from the bucket, meaning that the water was dirty and full of chemical residue already.
Dean furrows his eyebrows tightly. That incident seemed like it was months ago, when in reality it was only a few weeks. It was just yesterday when he broke the mason jar, and even that seemed like forever ago.
"Uh," Dean gives him a shrug. "It was just a jar that I accidentally dropped. It was in my room, so you won't step on any glass in here. I swept it up."
Dean smiles all over again, albeit softer than he would consciously want, and shrugs easily. "I'm sure that can be arranged."
The hand that was gently running circles on Dean's back stalls, but remains sitting still. He can feel the warmth of Castiel's hand still despite it not moving.
This was going to be the same beach experience—Except that he wasn't going to be the people on the beach, but rather the people watching over it.
It was eye opening in the worst way, to watch his friend genuinely act like himself for what may be the first time, and to have the result be just a hollow shell. Castiel was so tired, worn down, enervated and more burnt out than the candles they found when they first moved into the bunker.
When she pulled away, she looked up at him with worry in her big eyes. This is when Dean decided the interaction was too boring to watch, so he turned back to his crayon drawing.
"I get it, Cas," Dean says, sharper than he wants. "You're putting fires out everywhere. You shouldn't need to stay here. Don't make me keep you here. I'll burn you out."
When Dean was four; before he lost everything, before his mother left without a last breath, he remembers another fond conversation they had, the same kind that stuck to the brain like little paper scraps that were glued together haphazardly in the hasty panic of growing up.
Sticky sweet longing that clung to the inside of his ribcage, warmth of adoration and loyalty and desperation all working together to melt the ice shields he put up to keep his heart from pounding too fast, and they were now finally dripping down to nurture the blossoming of something new, like how Winter melts into Spring.
The door to the diner rings a bell as he walks in, and he sees Sam and Jess sitting in a booth on the far side of the place. Dean grins and slides in next to Jess. "Hey."
Dean, even now, can clearly recall sitting next to the crib that night and looking at Sam, who was fast asleep with his button nose and long eyelashes. Dean remembers looking at the door and then back at Sam, taking the courage to whisper to wherever his mother was.
Dean snorts and walks down the steps of the tower. This ought to be fun. He puts the coffee on one of the empty beachball stands and walks over to the two men.
He must remember blue eyes. Not a shade plucked from the sky, nor a drop from any ocean, more beautiful than each and all. Downturned and deepset, holding so much love for humanity, even the simplest sprinkle of dirt on the land.
The next morning, Dean was at Bobby's doorstep asking if he could join the lifeguarding team and earn a little money. Now he was here, sun beaming in his eyes as he looked on over the beach.
He must look so human, hunched over a library desk and furiously scratching a pen over a postit note with furrowed eyebrows and a deep glare. Although, he definitely wasn’t human, and the intense emotion and speed of which he acted made him resort to writing in hasty Enochian.
He has seen this place before. It's no secret on the beach, not to locals, despite what Dean almost believed. But Castiel looks so excited, his eyes are almost shining, so Dean gives him a smile and nods. "This place is pretty cool, Cas."
They fall into a silence for a long while, the same comfortable one as before, with the deepness of the sky swallowing them whole. Dean opens the bottle in his hands and drinks the bubbling drink, feeling the carbonation sweetly fizz on his tongue.
Sam looks up quickly, like a deer caught guiltily in the headlights. He puts a pamphlet down and almost looks as though he's about to be defensive, but he must recognize how exhausted Dean is and frowns. "Are you okay?"
He shakes his head and stands up as the ambulance parks on the street just outside the sand. And he feels good, proud of himself for saving somebody. He feels like a hero, with good feeling pumping through his veins and a smile working its way onto his face.
Dean stares at her until she finally turns and gives him a pointed look. Dean clears his throat. "Airway, breathing, circulation."
Out of all things he expected the note to be, a love poem was not one of them. He expected notes on the case. A grocery list, maybe. But not this.
Castiel shakes his head at Dean and drinks from the bottle. Dean watches as the smile doesn't leave his face. It doesn't leave his face when Dean holds his hand out, motioning to the group of people dancing to music. It doesn't leave his face when he takes Dean's hand.
"You can come over if you want." Dean holds back a flinch at the sound of his own voice cracking. He clears his throat and keeps talking, remaining as strong as he can be. "But Bobby won't let you take me or Sam."
Castiel just keeps sitting there, perfectly still and calm in the water, on Earth, like he deserves to be there and be human and real and HERE, and yet looking so incredibly ethereal that Dean couldn't begin to put words to describe it.
Jody rolls her eyes and shrugs him off. "Oh, hush. You're totally fine, Dean. I'm glad you took the day off; I would have sent you right home."
"I'm happy," Dean finds himself replying, he realizes that this is the first time in a long time where he's said that and meant it without a breath's hesitation. It feels lighter on his chest, so he gives a shy smile. "I really am."
"I'm not going far," John had shrugged her off. Dean heard him laugh quietly under his breath. "I'll be back in a couple days. It's just to the next town over."
(That's what it was like, with the waves crashing against the rocks and the sun shining through the palm leaves. He was just trying to hold on to the seconds, when he left. There were only so many moments he could have. Blue eyes. Eyes as blue as the sea.)
"Did you let a boy in here?" John sneers, low and venomous. "I didn't raise my ladies man of a son to be—"
Dean stood and the two of them walked, finding the package of sparklers. Castiel goes over to a more empty space on the beach, while Dean takes a lighter out of his pocket. "Do you know how to do this, Cas?"
Out of any possible thing to remember about her, Dean remembered for one that Mary always spoke with love. She spoke as if every meeting had a final goodbye; and that she was savouring the seconds between each moment with tightly knit fingers around the clock's ticking.
Castiel lets out a surprised laugh; a genuine one—and it's the first time that Dean has heard him laugh. It was soulful, he thinks. When Castiel laughed, he put his heart and soul into it.
Dean just lets the corner of his mouth rise. He tastes salt on his tongue, but not from the sea. His eyes are red rimmed. "He's the most holy thing I've ever known. He's gorgeous."
"Dean, you have always supported Sam," Castiel reminds softly. "He loves you. You're his brother, and you've always been there for him. That's why you're raising money for him to go to college, isn't it? Do you care about him?"
Dean guffaws and chokes on his laughter. He picks up a beer. "Alright. Fair enough. You can't blame me, though. He does have the damndest eyes."
He walks down the hallway of his bedroom, letting his breath catch once he makes it to his bedroom. Closing the door behind him, he starts thinking harder and harsher about the insecurities that have grown over the past few weeks. Mary is a faded picture in his head, and he gasps at the idea of Mary hating him, knowing that he's one of them. That he's the very thing people like Eli slurs at on the streets.
Dean laughs, shaking his head. His eye catches on somebody sitting at the bar, more specifically, a somebody wearing a trenchcoat, and his laughter fades. His gaze must stay there for a second too long because Sam notices.
Dean thought and looked at the time.  “Oh shit, it was almost 9 o’clock.” Dean swiftly got out of bed and saw a note on the table.  Sam had gone to meet with the sheriff as they had planned. He said he didn’t want to wake Dean or John and he would be back in a few hours.
Without all those allies around him, John knew he would get his perfect little soldier back and boy was he going to enjoy himself in the process.  Turning away from the nauseating display, John grimaced at the thought of the call he needed to make, and once again blamed Dean for having put him in this predicament.
The story crossed the 700 kudos mark and I'm thrilled.  To date this is my most popular story, and it's been amazing.  I have loved all the comments throughout the posting and I'm glad everyone seemed to enjoy it.  Thank you all so very much!
Dean felt someone stroking his face and opened his eyes to the Dream guy. Dean jerked away and looked around widely. It took a few seconds before Dean realized he was still sleeping.
Dean was having a hard time being here for even a minute or two before Death showed up and even now it was truly terrifying.  To be stuck here for eternity would be horrifying and so much worse than hell, but while the prospect of being a reaper was appealing, Dean would never not try to save his family.  Even if Sam never wanted to see him again, he had to do everything he could to save him.  And Crowley didn’t deserve to die because of Dean, and Cas, well Dean had to try to save his angel.
And another huge thank you for reading.  Please leave kudos or comments.  I would love to hear what you thought about the ending and also this little reveal.
A few hours later Sam squinted and his heart started to race and he had to wipe his palms on his jeans to get rid of the sweat because holy fuck he thinks he found something.
“Shhh. You will.” Dream guy said. He pressed his fingers against Dean’s hole, pushing in with two dry fingers. Dean arched his back and gasped in pain.
“Uh…”  Dean started to say getting a shifty expression on his face which Sam of course immediately picked up on.
“Will you still be participating in your bar hunting?”  Cas asked, his eyes narrowing at the thought.
Hi here is the next chapter, part 2 basically from the last one.  Again pretty triggering stuff here, see end for notes.
Hi here is the second chapter for tonight.  I will hopefully be on time next week but I have a chapter that just doesn't fit anywhere but is important so I need to figure that out.
Cas was confused, his gaze going from each of the Winchesters.  Why would John say something like that and why would Sam and Dean not dispute it?  Cas didn’t like the way Dean’s face fell and the fact that he seemed to agree with John.  Didn’t John realize how special Dean was?  Cas wondered.
Dream guy just laughed and stood up. He strolled around the stone room, his face twisted in distaste.
Sam bemused just stared unsure what to do or say when Death turned his dark gaze to him and smiled.  “It’s like he’s never tasted a vegetable in his life.”  Death groused and Sam couldn’t help but smile because that was so true.
“Wimpy delicious.”  Dean replied and Death chuckled again.  “Here try this one Dean.”  Death said sliding another one over to him and Dean looked at it suspiciously.
Dean looked up. The owner of the voice was big, so big that all six feet and 2 inches of Dean felt small and vulnerable.  His large hands smoothed over Dean’s skin, cooling the fire, erasing the pain.
Triggers include a flashback to underage forced prostitution, sexual slavery, incest.  Dean is around 16.
“Cas, I need to tell you about my dad, and, uh, what….”  Dean started but then the room lit up.  He gasped as he saw Cas face fill with terror right before he was sucked out of the room.
Hi everyone, I hope you all had a great holiday.  Sorry for posting late this week.  As a present I won't leave you with the cliff hanger I was intending to at the end of this chapter and will post the next one tonight too.
Note:  When writing this I pictured the scene where Dean fights Cole and says well come on ("Reichenbach") and after Dean fights the hunters, the scene from "The Things We Left Behind."
“Maybe you need something to focus on.” Crowley said.  “There have been a bunch of demons getting killed and I need you to look into it for me and take care of the problem.”
I'll try to post sooner than the week due to the cliffhanger but I still have to write part of it, its just a small part so I will try to get it done this weekend and maybe post Wednesday.
Hi everyone, I have a nice long chapter for you.  Its almost a part 1 with the next chapter but it was way too long leaving them together so I picked I think a good place to split it.
Dean's calls and prayers were blocked in an effort to separate him and Cas.  During that time Cas only kept in touch with Sam.
“Don’t sass me Dean.”  Death responded and Dean nodded quickly saying sorry sir to which Death snorted.  Dean stared a minute at hearing such a human sound from the Angel of Death and then he grinned and the heavy moment lightened somewhat.
Hi everyone I hope you all had a good week.  I actually got quite a bit of writing done so I pretty happy.  I still have a few more chapters to write and the rest to edit but I'm not so overwhelmed with what is left anymore.   I thank you once again for the kudos and comments as they really fuel my writing.
“Listen to me Dean because we don’t have much time.''  Death said and tapped his cane, his face somewhat foreboding and Dean’s spidey senses started to tingle.  “With the Mark on your arm and the blade in your possession upon your death you were destined to turn into a demon, a Knight of Hell in fact.”  Death explained and Dean paled and felt like ice had been poured down his body.
Dean squirmed against the supernatural hold. When it didn’t give, he forced himself to take a calming breath. Focusing on the Mark, it flared red, and with a
“But you must understand Dean, this place, it's surprising that I was even able to get to you here.”  Death confessed.
“You’re sick!” Sam snarled, but his eyes were wide and frightened at seeing this side of his father.
I am really not sure what happens when someones lung is punctured so I apologize if I completed missed the mark on that.
“Hey, Winchester bitch,” one demon drawled. Dean just looked at him coldly. “So is it true that you can't kill us?  Wasn't that part of the deal you made, no live meat suits in exchange for you not killing us?” The demon smirked, taking Dean's silence as an answer.
“Oh yeah that’s good Dean.  Your mouth is perfect.  I’m gonna keep you here for a long time.”  Drake said as he moaned in pleasure.  “Chained to my bed.  Gonna make you pay for taking the master away from me.”  Drake moaned again and Dean choked and gurgled as hot cum shot down his throat.
“It’s really not.”  Death said dropping his hand and standing in agitation.  “Your father is working with some powerful magick.”
Dean lectured himself. Taking a deep breath Dean stood up disengaging Cas’ hand. “Dad, this is Castiel. He said you were you so there was no need for tests.” Dean explained waving a hand at Cas.
Dean watched in horror as everything seemed to be in slow motion as the three demons fighting Benny got the upper hand and the angel blade Benny was fighting with was flung out of his hands and it landed a few feet from where Dean was hanging.  They were forcing Benny to his knees as one pulled out a large knife.
Dean glanced once again at Cas through his eyelashes to catch Cas staring at him, and Dean sighed and felt his eyes get wet when the angel turned away.
“Dean, I do not understand.  How could you know that without talking to him?”  Cas asked, confused at Dean’s reaction.
Cas just smiled and leaned forward and placed his lips against Dean’s gently at first and at the sound of Dean’s involuntary moan the lips became more rough and they both exploded, seeking to taste and nip and lick.  All those years of pent up feelings bursting out at the first touch of their lips to each other’s.
More lust coursed through his body at the feeling of Dream Guy’s cock, but Dean’s mind rebelled, the only part of him that was still himself.
“Let’s try this again,” Dream Guy said with a smile when he pulled away from Dean’s lips. With growing horror, Dean realized he could taste the sweetness that filled his mouth.
“Do you really want to try this?”  Dean asked his voice laden with hesitation and hope.  Geez he was such a chick sometimes Dean thought mentally rolling his eyes at himself.
Death huffed.  “Wimpy Skippy Dean.''  He said and Sam got the feeling he had corrected Dean a few times already.
Kate’s smirking face morphed into a beautiful red headed demon, smiling up at Dean as he thrust into her.  Dean smiled back, his mind screaming kill, kill, kill while his eyes and mouth smiled seductively. Keeping up the act was so hard when Dean was filled with hate as the pain from all the torture ran through his mind, even as he kissed her jaw. He bit gently at her nipple making her cry out in pleasure, the screams of the demons he tortured, the horror of his mind being manipulated flooding his body. Abby screamed as she came and Dean quickly followed, her clenching pushing him over the edge.
“Do you know how long — what I had to do in order to be King of Hell?” Crowley asked in a cold voice. The twins shook their head, wisely keeping their mouths shut. “And do you remember what I was before I became the King of Hell?”
Dean smiled as the guy hissed in pain and bent slightly over, releasing Dean, who quickly stepped away from him.
Dean started to back away again, but Sam stepped closer and grabbed Dean’s arm to stop him. Dean flinched at the unexpected touch, Sam’s large frame and hands bringing up visions of Dream Guy. Sorrow flashed across Sam’s face before he lifted his hands in supplication.
Sam walked behind his brother, just waiting for him to bolt, but thankfully, Dean, after pausing in front of the back door for a few seconds, walked in. He slowed down a bit and glanced at Sam nervously, and understanding his brother’s hesitance, Sam quickened his pace and walked into the kitchen first. Cas was seated at the table with some coffee in front of him. He looked up when Sam came in.
Dean was jerked back to consciousness by a vicious slap across his face.  His chest and back were in agony as were his wrists and shoulders.  “Stay with me Dean.”  Drake said with another slap.  “I remember you being tougher than this.”  Drake said with a laugh.
Not knowing how to respond, Dean just shrugged and stepped forward until the two of them were circling the room, watching each other with eagle sharp eyes.
After a few seconds of silence Dean went to ask another question his voice choked up, full with shock and awe at the enormity of what his friend was willing to do to help him.  “If I became a reaper, I would never turn into a demon, even with the Mark?” Dean asked his mind whirling.  Did he want to go back to all that pain and humiliation especially now that Sam knew everything?  To fighting for his life every minute of the day and never winning?  To dread being killed because of this damn Mark on his arm and turning into a demon if he was?  But then there was Cas, was it better for the angel for Dean to stay dead because Dean would only bring him down and continue to cause a rift with his family.  But could Dean give him up?  He was the love of his life.   Dean’s mind was awash with the pros and cons.
I am stoked that I have received so many kudos and comments (I apologize if it takes a while before I respond to the comments).  It has actually helped me finally push through the block I have had and I got the next chapter written.  So thank you all and please continue to send them my way.
Dean was harder than he had ever been in his entire life.  “No, ah, ah, no, wait, yes, yes, Cas!”  Dean quickly corrected with a gasp, blatantly lying with his last working brain cell.  Cas’ smirk widened.
Great news though, AnotherWorld3111 has taken time away from her amazing J2 fic "Ink, Blood and Bullets." and beta'd these chapters for me and is helping me organize my stuff and figure some things out cause I had no idea what order to put some of these chapters in - the downfall of writing stuff out of order.  She is an amazing beta and an even more amazing writer if you want to check out some of her stuff.
Hi everyone, I hope everyone had a good week.  We are back with Dean in this chapter and lots of triggers here.  Its a bad one.  You can skip the first part and start reading at the page break if don't want to read the more graphic stuff and I will put a summary at the bottom.
Sam portions out food onto two plates. "Right, right. A business trip. God, that's so ridiculous. He should just be honest. We all know that his business trips don't require him going to Vegas, and we've seen his credit card receipts."
"Right. Well, go run along back to daddy, okay? No need to scare off tourists," Dean grits out. "They're the people giving your dad money. Wouldn't wanna upset your dad, would you?"
-mentioned/implied child abuse (John Winchester is abrasive and emotionally manipulative, mentions and implications towards him physically hurting dean, as well as shouting and screaming and being very angry and aggressive)
Dean gets up and throws it into the recycling, and then retreats to his room. While the moon casts over the waves, he stares at how they reflect blue.
That's how it began, really. Months of training and Dean was now on his first day— the beginning of June came quick, and the cheap tourists came flooding in just as the heat did.
Castiel furrows his eyebrows in the same sort of intense concentration he usually has when he's confused. "But the sign says—"
The talk is long and the walk is longer, but Castiel is patient and despite Sam asking an abundance of angry questions directed toward John, they make it back to Bobby's place with little difficulty.
Dean stares at him quietly, breathing in the words and letting the stress in his tired brain fade away with every passing consonant that graces Castiel's tongue.
Charlie looks at him with the perfect picture of pity and understanding. "We've all been there, man."
"I'd want nothing more," Dean nudges his shoulder and internally cringes as an immediate effect. "Hold on, though."
This is where Castiel learns to understand a new human trait; one that has specifically and exclusively Dean Winchester written on it’s packaging.
"Oh," Charlie blinks with surprise. "Sorry. I guess I shouldn't have made assumptions. Are you bi, maybe?"
There's a beat of silence as they eat. Dean is too tired to think about anything more than cold chicken and colder gravy on his mashed potatoes.
Today felt like every step was taken in a jar of molasses, like his life was counted on a clock where each tick was delayed at varying amounts of seconds. Grief feels weird and heavy in his head. An hour has passed. Maybe three.
Castiel doesn't say anything for a moment, but then shrugs Dean's hand off of his shoulder. He's about to ask what the problem is when he sees Cas easily pull off the trenchcoat and hold it over his arm.
Dean was surprisingly calm, too. Despite the terror pumping through his veins mixed with something richly sweet, he was calm, settled with a neutral expression as he stared at Castiel across the fire.
Beside Bobby's house was a small windowed structure, on top of which flew brightly coloured flags. Ever since Dean could remember, Bobby was somewhat of a Head Lifeguard. He's been retired from going out in the water for a while, but Dean remembers sitting in the structure, having Bobby explain that his job was to direct other lifeguards on the radio, and that he saw all kinds of dangers from where he sat.
Dean opens his mouth, and bites it back when he realizes his first instinct is to lie. He glances over at his bedroom door, still open. He imagines the shattered glass and coins scattered on the floor. It's a good thing he was wearing shoes when he walked in and out, otherwise his feet would be scratched up beyond belief. He feels the impending failure pressing on his shoulders.
John steps closer, wavering as he does so. Dean steps back, only a few feet from his bedroom door. A whirlwind of confusion is being screamed at him from his internal defense system. His entire body is tensing up from his own words, awaiting a fight. "You have to go, Dad."
A quick look outside tells Dean that sure enough it had gotten dark, and they must have been talking for a lot longer than originally thought or had been noticed. A returned glimpse at Castiel and he suddenly remembers that the guy had asked for instructions earlier.
Not enough money for the hospital, Dean's mind supplies. Don't have health care. "I'm not dead because..."
Rather from shock, or the sudden realization he was outnumbered, the asshole runs down the alleyway, holding his most likely broken nose. Dean turns back to the kid, who he can see better now that closer to the lamppost.
"Dean," Cas picks Dean's hands up like they're delicate things, like they haven't done as much damage as John has done to him. It kills him. "Your hands are all scraped up. They're bleeding. Did you cut them on the windowsill by accident?"
"What's going on?" Dean speaks up, looking between the two. "Did you come to cause more trouble? Because you—" he pointed to the asshole. "—are sketchy as hell, even in broad daylight."
He slides into a booth and Castiel sits across from him. They each order a coffee and Dean watches as Castiel sips his greedily. Castiel's eyes light up as they reach Dean's. "This is really good. You should try it."
Dean glances at the man in question and realizes quietly that, maybe Dean isn't the only Icarus. Maybe the both of them are; just two souls learning to be hopeful again, and yearning towards the smallest sliver of light they can find. <
He opens his mouth, and he closes it, and opens it again, before just giving a forced smile that looks far too close to a grimace. "Well, it's... Um..."
"Yeah, yeah, go for it," Dean nods. "Take her to that one diner. The one that's totally ancient? She'd like that."
"Hello, Dean." Cas purses his lips and does his usual squinted eyes and furrowed eyebrows, giving him a funny expression that made him look incredibly awkward in the most endearing of ways. "I wasn't aware that you were in residence here."
"How does that work?" Dean speaks up dumbly, a confused frown on his face. "You being gay and a priest? Isn't that against the Bible?"
"Don't talk about my dad." Dean spits out, his tone laced with venom. "And I won't talk about yours."
"Let me guess, you're here because you're gonna beat me up again?" Eli spits out. His voice is hoarse. "Now that my Daddy ain't here to protect me? Is that right?"
"Eli will be okay," Castiel says firmly. "He's eighteen, that's legally an adult. As for chewing you out—You're already doing that yourself, aren't you? What would I say that you haven't already thought of yourself to a greater extent?"
Bobby huffs with faint amusement. "You're killing me, kid. You know you're always welcome here, if things go awry over at your place. You and Sam."
He had never understood the butterflies-in-the-stomach sort of feeling that came with asking some pretty girl out for a date. But then again, Castiel isn't some pretty girl that tosses his hair around and giggles at all of his jokes.
The statement is in bitter taste; Dean can tell. He inwardly cringes with the guilt that follows after the words leave his mouth. In all honesty, he was happy to see the man. He had after all saved his life, the least he could provide was a proclamation of gratitude.
Dean has met a variety of people. He's seen a plethora of faces. He's talked with an abundance of personalities. And no matter how much he will guilt himself later, meeting Castiel was the exact same as everybody else. Completely and utterly ordinary.
But then, the hopeful balloon in his head slowly deflates, as he begins to think of Sam. Bobby. The life he's created here. If he gives all of that up, abandoning his home and his friends and his family's dreams, just because John put him in danger—is he winning or losing? The line isn't as distinct as it was before.
Dean huffs. "It doesn't really matter, alright? Everyone knew Cas wasn't sticking around anyways. You shouldn't be sticking around either. I'm still going to try and work for more cash. I'll work weekends if I have to, I'll spend nights hustling pool for the rest of the summer. But you have to promise to look for scholarships every second you're not doing work, okay? I'm not doing this crap alone now that it isn't some big surprise."
If things aren't safe, if they still are walking on broken seashells when the sun rises tomorrow, and John is still pissed off even after making blood spill from his first son's punches, then maybe he'll consider going to live with Cas.
Dean stood frozen in his place. He didn't dare move. He didn't dare speak. He breathed, in and out, his food going cold on the plate in front of him. His stomach had turned and squeezed, and his chest had been strung tight like a brand new guitar that hadn't been broken in yet.
The papers range from half written Enochian characters to very childish and scribbled doodles of Castiel, Castiel’s eyes—Salad—?
Before Dean can put his seatbelt back on, Castiel puts his hand gently on Dean’s arm. (It’s an interesting gesture, as it mirrors the hand print on his other arm frighteningly well, but the context between both actions are so overwhelmingly different that it makes Cas’s head spin.)
He's fifteen, sporting a fresh black eye and huddled in the corner of his room as John thrusts his fists against the door, not so much knocking but not exactly punching either. The particular instance was after Sam had asked to go to a friend's house, in which Dean said yes. John came home, asked where Sam was, and was furious when he found the answer. ("What if he gets kidnapped over there?! It would be your fault! Your fault, Dean Winchester. And then I would have nothing, because your mom left me with nothing to watch him but you. Open this damn door before I break it down!")
(He continued to make sure they were doing alright after it happened. John was a shell of a man, just a walking corpse. Some days it seemed he was more dead than Mary was.)
Dean clears his throat awkwardly. "Anyways. I heard there was a bonfire going on tonight at the beach. You got plans?"
"I've got a way we can warm you up," Dean says, rubbing at Castiel's goosebump covered arms. "We should dance."
Maybe that's why Dean was standing here, feeling nervous about asking Castiel to go to the fair with him and two other people. They weren't even going alone, and that made him feel even more ridiculous about the feelings of nervousness. He shouldn't feel like this. It was just Cas. It was just some guy.
Dean turns his head to find a short-haired woman raising her eyebrow at him. She looked old enough to be his mom, and Dean recognizes her as Jody Mills, the recently joined lifeguard who will be monitoring him as a trainee for over the summer.
Dean volunteers to do the dishes that night, and as he scrubs each plate, he looks out the window. The ocean was midnight black, rolling over itself and flowing easily onto the shore. Low tide.
Dean goes still and then sighs. The drowsiness is making him want to talk, and sometimes he forgets that Sammy never knew Mom before she passed away. He keeps his gaze on the table and smiles something bittersweet.
Dean turns down the road and starts walking to the beach. The sun was just getting ready to rise, which meant it was cold and the water was even more so. People wouldn't be showing up until at least for another two hours, maybe three.
Kissing Castiel has proven itself to be one of his favourite things to do. Every time their lips met, it solidified against a tiny little doubt in Dean's head that he wasn't actually attracted to men, and since Dean has a lot of doubt, he must need to kiss Cas a whole lot.
Dean looks at him carefully for a moment and shrugs. “Alright. Well, I’m gonna head to bed. Just wanted to ask if you were going to stay up and research?”
Castiel hesitates, and he shifts on his feet. He has this funny expression on his face, as if he's trying to think of a lie but he's never heard of an alternative to being completely candor. Dean suppresses a smile.
He wonders if this is what Castiel sees, when he's gone silent. The couple dancing on the far off side of the beach, caught up in their own world. The teenager who definitely shouldn't be smoking is grinning with a cigarette hanging from his mouth. The group of friends arguing what time is best to start lighting fireworks. It's ambience, Dean realizes. This was society rotating just as Earth did, with people just being simply human. He isn't noticing the horrible things as easily anymore. More often than not, it's the past ugly things that are being dredged up to sit in his view.
"That's the least of my worries," Sam widens his eyes and puts his glass of water down on the table. "What the hell happened to you? You look half dead."
It's a weak joke, although Sam probably can't tell. He feels a sense of guilt from saying the words, as if he was saying a lie. The professional psychologists from earlier would say through a sympathetic smile as they scratched down another note that it was because Dean can't take care of himself, but he can take care of Sam.
"From—From biting into your—?" Dean blinks at him and then shakes his head. "You're freakin' weird, Cas. Never change."
Dean huffs a soft laugh and then flicks on the lighter, bringing it to the end of the paper. Instantaneously, it catches alight and begins to spark brightly yellow, flicking off the end of the metal in Castiel's hand.
"I'm just going through some serious crap, Sammy, leave it alone. Shit, you always have to be so nosy?"
But Castiel was here, and if Dean was being friendly, he knew he had to apologize if he had accidentally said something he shouldn't. Dean isn't purposefully an asshole. He'd like to think that should count for something.
Dean doesn't like becoming this, this dragon that will burn and leave people and things into splintered and scorched pieces. But it was all piling up. His dad wasn't home still. The jar sits barren on his desk. He sees blue eyes in his thoughts. His mom was dead, she was never coming back, he missed how things used to be.
"What?" Dean tears his eyes away from Castiel. He downs half of the beer in his hands. "We're not. What do you mean 'a vibe'? I don't have a vibe."
"Right," Dean narrows his eyes. "Either way. You may want to skedaddle off this beach. You going somewhere? Need directions?"
The compliment rattles Dean to his core, causing his breath to go cold and his mind to go blank. He supposes the proper response is a thank you, but his ears feel too warm and he just knows that his face is a vivid beet red. His thoughts are in blaring red alarms, steam coming from his ears but not the angry kind, more the shocked kind. Dean's mouth is ready to rattle off a million reasons why that isn't true, but Castiel's silence shuts him down further.
The first one, the asshole, looked even more like a dunce in the light of day. He was tall, a bit thinner when it comes to musculature, and you could tell his head was so full of poison that everything that came out of his mouth dripped in black goo as well. His nose was swollen, but healing.
Dean huffs, letting himself smile. He then remembers a previous promise that Castiel had made the night before and turns to him. "Hey, Cas, didn't you promise to show me your secret beach spot tonight?"
"Hey, Sam," Dean speaks up. "Does Jess know about the time that you peed your pants on picture day? What was it, like, fifth grade?"
Sam has already gone to sleep, as it's a school night. It gives them the privacy to talk alone in the living room. They sit close to each other on the couch, and Dean swears he isn't trying to lean into Castiel, but his body does so on instinct, like he knows that Cas is safe and warm and a good person to be next to.
"I've got you," Castiel says gruffly, just low enough for Dean to hear and sounding sweet enough that Dean digs his forehead more into his shoulder.
When he was in high school, it was girl after girl. They usually broke up with him rather than the other way around, but it was well deserved. Dean was an asshole, and he knows that. He couldn't focus on whatever girlfriend he had, because all he could ever be really worried about was himself. More specifically, his dad, or the bills, or his brother.
Dean stares at him blankly. Whatever words this guy just said, it went right through one ear and out the other. "I've never heard of that in my entire life."
Then, the night was over, because the sun rose and he passed out with sand in his hair with his shoes tossed across the beach. The bonfire had burnt out over the night's end, leaving nothing but a pile of blackened and charcoaled logs.
"Sometimes, yes." Castiel picks up a sunscreen bottle and turns it over in his hands. "They've been through a lot. Our father has had difficulties over the years with doing his basic diligence. If I'm being honest, it's one reason I was so easily convinced to leave."
"I'm glad you agree," Castiel grins back at him. He points to a small handful of tiny crabs that scuttle behind a rock. "Look, there are crabs!"
He looks up to study Castiel's face. He isn't sure what he's expecting. Disgust, possibly—the kind right before Dean is about to be kicked out. He's seen the same expression on John's face. Or perhaps he expects to see anger, just like the kind that he had when the fight took place. But he isn't sure that those flames would look right in Cas's eyes. Not in those baby blues.
"I think they'd be dumb not to hire you," Dean says with kind honestly. It makes Charlie smile a little brighter, so Dean counts it as a win. "Sorry about the girl."
As they walk down the street, Dean feels the sudden urge to show the deep appreciation burning in his chest for Castiel's patience, he ducks into an alleyway between the diner and a gas station and tugs Castiel in by his hand.
"What do you think it is?" Dean asks, still studying Sam for any sort of negative response. There isn't one, yet.
Dean places himself in between John and his bedroom door, leaning against the wall of the hallway. "He's out. He left about an hour ago, at eight."
He's staring up at the ceiling, watching the reflections of a lighthouse slowly turn on the dark of the ceiling. The window is open, he can feel a slight breeze through the air.
Dean yawns. "I'm lookin' after Sammy. Just like I promised you. Hope I'm makin' you proud. He certainly is, going to college and all that."
Dean looks away at the sound of a familiar voice, and turns around to see Charlie from across the beach. Charlie meets his eyes and grins wildly, waving at him with her usual exuberant energy. Dean notices that she has given herself bangs in the past few days that he hadn't seen her.
“I’m not going anywhere with you. I’m going to kill you.” Dean promised. This time, he made the advance himself and stepping forward. “You should leave and never come back.” Dean threatened.
“Drink up Sammy.”  Dean said with a pat on Sam’s shoulder and Sam didn’t miss the increased tremor that ran through Dean’s hands.
Thanks for all the comments regarding John's death.  I'm glad everyone seemed to like how he died and who killed him.  I wrote that chapter at the very beginning and I couldn't wait to get to the point where I could post it.  Again, I really appreciate the comments and kudos.
Once again thank you for the continued comments and kudos.  Another shout out to Anotherworld3111 for helping me with editing and answering questions about which direction to go in.
"Yes. I would have had it with me," Castiel says seriously, and he gestures to his clothes. "But I chose to wear this fun shirt with the bumblebees."
Bobby is behind his bedroom door. He's looking at Dean, and Dean is looking at him, and immediately Dean feels uneasiness creep in. He isn't any kind of psychic, but he knows body language. Bobby's too stiff, he's forcing his relaxed position and anybody could tell if they looked hard enough. His expression is half parts sorry and half parts serious—but overall he just looks tense.
Before he leaves, he buys a glass bottle of Coca Cola—for Castiel, of course. Then he's on his way back to the beach. He's starting to see the sun slowly lowering in the sky, with shades of purple clouding the top furthest from the star.
The next morning, Dean finds him at the library table, his cheek pressed against a book and quietly snoring. He’s woken up, they go back to work, and days continue like normal.
"Dean," Sam says quietly, in a tone that lets Dean know that he's trying to console him. "That's fine. It's fine. I already know I'm not going to Stanford, I already accepted that months ago when I asked Dad. You don't have to get upset over any of this."
It wasn't a total lie, as John hasn't been around for Sam's birthday since he was three or four. That part of the cake was true, too. The only lie was that Sam was seventeen— just one important year shy of what Dean had told him.
If things do turn out alright, and John gets his kicks and punches in and moves on, crawling back to Vegas for new bills a day later, then the original plan will resume as follows. Cas leaves alone in the next few days. Sam uses the money Dean saved to go to Stanford. Dean continues to work as a lifeguard, maybe. Dean continues to live dreadfully alone, waiting for John to come back the next time. Things go on.
Of course, Dean understands this, he has a habit of doing the same thing, but there was a very specific way that Castiel went about it.
"From what I've seen, you do it all for love. And you have no idea how good you are. You help people and fight for your friends, and all you see is the blood on your knuckles, and the mistakes that you've made." Castiel frowns deeper, tilting his head to the side. "You have this... this anger, and you think it controls you, but it doesn't. You're more than your anger. You always have been. You're not really an angry person, and yet you still hold it with such responsibility that you convinced yourself that you are. That doesn't make you a sinner, Dean, that makes you brave. You are so, so brave."
After Jody telling stories of what her daughters have been up to, Bobby talking about lifeguards on other shifts being goofy, Sam talking about school, promoting Castiel to light up and explain the intricacies of ancient irrigation systems, they finally decide to call it a night. Jody heads home; she tells Dean to keep the stoneware that the casserole was in, that she didn't like it anyways. She tells him how proud she is before she goes.
"I'm sorry it didn't work out tonight," Jess says sincerely. She stands up and kisses Sam's cheek. "I'll see you tomorrow, Sam."
Before Bobby or Castiel can defend themselves, the phone rings on the coffee table beside Dean. He reaches over and picks it up immediately when he recognizes the number.
Sam stands up and they walk back over to the stall. Sam glances back at the bench they were sitting on and grins. "Beautiful, right?"
He's walking down the street now, and his stomach is twisting and turning and he can feel acid in the back of his throat. This is how it was always supposed to end, right? From the moment he set his eyes on Cas, the timer started ticking. He was never supposed to stay.
"No," Dean says, feeling his heart race. This is what it feels like to fight a fire, he realizes. And suddenly it becomes clear to him that the flames in his chest were never his own. They were always John, they were always Dad, like a parasite that stuck itself under his skin. Now he's battling back on them with all the power in his will. "It's my room."
A week has passed since the fair, and there are a variety of thoughts and ideas that have decided to take permanent refuge in the storm of Dean's brain. Thoughts that seem like second nature, that one day were not there and the next they were, and it was perfectly normal because these thoughts made him feel more himself, he thinks.
At some point during the evening, Castiel kisses Dean's forehead softly, like he's a flower petal, like he's everything, like he's glass and he's beautiful because of it.
"Yeah, yeah," he nods. "I'm fine. It's all healing, it'll be fine. I've had worse," he grins crookedly.
“My dad buried me alive once,” Dean says. It is not said in any particular way, because it is such an unusual yet important phrase that the only thing that matters is that it was said at all. “Said it would help me in the future, if it ever happened for real.”
The walk to City Hall is slow, and there's not a word between the two of them. It's hard to think that just this morning they were asleep under the glow of sunlight coming from Dean's bedroom window. It's hard to think that this morning was this morning, and not centuries ago, minutes ago, or even yesterday. Time is skewed and all Dean can remember is a fuzzy haze patched with details that are too clear.
"Dean," Cas speaks up. He stops walking in front of a diner and points at a sign. "It says that this place has the best clam chowder."
Before Castiel can stutter out a half-baked lie to explain why he needs to switch hotels, a woman is running over to Dean with a panicked expression on her young face.
Perhaps it was the unfamiliar room, or the idea that his dad could be anywhere, planning anything to get to him right now. Maybe it was the impounding ticking in his head, with the day marker moving from 5 to a 4, or the neon red of the alarm clock beside the bed telling him when morning will arrive, telling him when to make his decision.
Dean suddenly stops in his spot, his hands freezing under the faucet. He left the money at the house. Thousands of dollars were left in his room, no doubt in a spot where John could take it and leave. Everything Dean has worked for, gone in an instant because he forgot to grab it when he was leaving in such a hurry.
"Dean, you're getting water all over the carpet," Sam points out. "And you look like hell. Jess was about to go home anyways. We can do this another day, alright?"
He had been young, maybe just between four or five. He remembers this, because Mary had walked with a watermelon belly, rosy cheeks, and a proud glow that could only belong to a soon-to-be mother of two. He had been using his time before dinner to draw at the kitchen table with crayons.
"You came prepared," Dean huffs in amusement, and begins writing his number down on the woman's arm. He winks at her when he gives the pen back.
This was a good idea; he had been driving with no breaks for over twenty four hours. With this particular detail, as paired with previous evidence, Castiel is starting to think that Dean liked to drive when under a great amount of stress.
Dean clears his throat and sits down on the motel's mattress. He gestures to the only duffel bag in the room. "Dude. You've been here for a few weeks now, this place is spotless. What the hell are you hiding in that bag?"
"I know people like that," Jody says softly with an underlying encouragement. "It's not cheesy at all. They're the best kind of people."
He lets a dream run itself over in his mind. Mornings every day with waking up beside Castiel, helping him begin to keep bees, make dinner in the evenings, and go to the Sunday market. The simple domesticity of sitting on the kitchen floor to fold laundry wouldn't be a rare occurrence.
The corner of Dean's mouth quirks up in his first smile of the day. "That's nice to hear, Cas Shurley— 'cuz you're all I need."
Dean stares at Sam, not saying a word and having his jaw clenched tightly. He watches Sam process the statement, watches the gears turn and shift in his head, watches as Sam mentally applies the metaphor to the situation-- It's too late to turn back now. Realization crosses and Sam's eyes become lighter, the focused lines on his forehead relaxing as he looks at Dean with a growing smile. "Are you--Is this what I think it is?"
Dean is not against punching senior kids in the face. That might put him on a one-way first-class train to perdition, but at this particular moment he couldn't give a shit. His right fist burns all over again, the bruises on his knuckles coming back more painful than before.
Dean tries not to burst out with a cacophony of disbelieving laughter. "Uh. Okay. I would not agree with that statement, but okay. I'm guessing you like crabs too?"
They're just smiling at each other now, letting the peace settle in between their words and soak into their skin. Dean tears his eyes away from Castiel. "Do you think Sam and Jess are still at the darts stall?"
When Dean usually thinks of himself, it's of the blood he has shed from fights that sits in a thick cape over his nightmares, or the fire that festers in the pit of his stomach, grown from the smoldering of heartbreak and injustice he's been dealt since he was just a baby. He thinks of ugliness, an angry gnarled mess of tight joints and clenched bloody teeth that not even a mother could love, nor a father, for that matter. He thinks of incessant whispers that kick him to the ground, asking him loudly if he truly believes he deserves to be treated like a human when he's so clearly a monster, and in contradictory, if he believes that Cas actually cares or if he's just faking.
Dean wakes up gradually, more of a morning person than Cas probably will ever be. This is the first time that he's slept over, but from the way Castiel snores softly and rests like a rock tells him that he usually tries to stretch as much sleep from the night as he can.
Obviously, this didn't sit well with Dean, and he was rushing forward immediately. He yanks the guy away from the kid and shoves him to the side. "I can't believe I'm saying this, considering you're the size of a fucking twig, but why don't you pick on someone your own size?"
"Dean," Sam speaks up. Dean's eyes shoot up in response, looking particularly guilty and caught with his hand in the cookie jar. Sam doesn't seem to notice though, and if he did, he doesn't show it. "Want to get some more napkins?"
A gentle knocking wakes Dean up from his sleep. He yawns and pulls away from where Cas was linked to him and sits up.
Whatever this stupid crush is, this ridiculous infatuation—Dean feels it growing stronger. Not worse; because that would imply the existence of a negative connotation to whatever was buzzing in his head. This thing, whatever it was, while confusing and sometimes frightening, was comforting and warm all the same.
Fourth day on the job, and he's thinking that he might finally take Bobby's advice about getting there early. He told him, "it'll wake you up, trust me." Of course, Dean has only ever trusted Bobby's advice, so it wasn't like he was opposed. He just wished that his shift didn't start so early to begin with.
He’s suddenly very aware of the fact that Castiel is just down the hallway, sitting in his room doing whatever ex-angel’s do in their free time. Sam had left to get groceries, which was lucky for him, because then he wouldn’t have to witness the clownery about to unfold.
After his shift ends, he promised Sam that he would go hang out at the new diner that opened up near the city center so that he could meet Jess properly. When the clock hits five and people have left the beach to most likely eat dinner, Dean heads to the locker room to wash the salt water off of his body, and then leaves with salt between his toes.
Castiel, wearing the same clothes as the time that he's seen him, and Dean can only imagine how hot he is with the sun starting to shine brighter as it rises. Nonetheless, the man is looking around with his squinty-eyed expression, so Dean sighs and takes it upon himself to walk up and talk to him.
Charlie is happy for him though, and Dean can see that. There haven't been many people in his life that ever show him the time to care. Dean sighs and looks up. "I technically owe it to you, I guess."
All Dean can really feel is adrenaline and fear and a fierce intensity to protect everything he's worked so hard to love this summer. Himself, his life, his family, and of course Cas—
The sun falls in what seems like a blink of an eye. Dean was told by Bobby the other day that this was probably due to the fact that he hasn't needed to brush off any of his first aid training yet. (Which was an absolute pain to try and study for while John was practically breathing down his neck. Seriously, that man cared too much and not at all about all of the wrong things.)
Dean can see Castiel's mouth moving, but something has taken over his head and he can't focus on anything other than making sure he apologizes for the terrible mistake he's made. He also sees Castiel's expression fall while his blue eyes trail down, and the concern in his eyes finally shuts Dean up. "What is it?"
Dean lets his gaze pass around the beach, which for once isn't littered with people. It makes his chest tighten with the beginning of rage. "Too freakin' quiet. Damn it."
With all of these words, all of these feelings, bubbling and stretching and twisting around like a messily knitted jumper, Castiel does the first thing he can think of. He grabs a nearby pen and starts scribbling madly on the first blank paper he finds.
And Castiel— He's looking all over the place. Dean watches his eyes as they dance back and forth from all sorts of things on the pier, from the ocean, to the people, to the rides. His gaze lingers on the Ferris Wheel, which was a little ways away in blazing white and red colour. The sun gleams a bright yellow over it.
Dean gets dressed and pulls on his shoes, and then walks outside his house. Like some sort of foreign routine, contradictory in of itself and yet somehow fitting nicely, Castiel happened to be passing by his house the moment he left the door.
"You know, you're allowed in here anytime. You don't have to knock," Dean says with amusement. He sits on the kitchen floor, setting the laundry basket down beside him.
Castiel, calm as always, turns his head and looks at Dean with the softest of looks, as if his hard expressions were melted over time by the California sun.
"I heard you were trouble," Jody says with slight amusement. She has a soft authoritative way about her, the way she spoke and carried herself. She was used to being in charge, it was clear to see—but she seemed kind enough. "Bobby told me a lot about you, huh?"
On the other hand, it's just as possible that this is just a painter's mess of extra paint on a canvas. Spills of a plan smeared without thought or reason, subjective to look like art or not. This could just as easily be nothing, or a hallucination in Dean's head, which he realizes as well.
This coastal town was small, but cheaper than the main one next to the interstate. Colourful houses in ranging sizes were placed beside each other in lines. People knew everyone here, they kept their circle large enough to reach the general community.
Listening to Cas talk to himself was like watching a puzzle build itself. Piece by piece, it knit itself together from nothing but a mental picture. Every word he says sounds practiced and well-thought out, which Dean finds exceptionally strange because Cas has this selfless quality that makes him seem like the type to never think about himself even in passing.
The sun has now risen to a point where it illuminates the sidewalk just behind where Dean is sitting. As he zones back into focus of his surroundings, he hears the annoying voice of the same asshole he hit a few nights before, as well as a leveler voice arguing back firmly.
Dean hasn't ever been any good at apologies. If a therapist or psychologist were to analyze why, they would probably say this was due to the fact that he didn't grow up with apologies in his household. To which Dean would explain tensely that, it was because when he said sorry, it didn't matter because the deed had already been done, and all that would follow would be punishment. Of course, therapists and psychologists would have a field day with that one, so he keeps his mouth shut.
Sam throws him a thumbs up as he walks away, calling out his goodnight as he goes. Dean sees his arm slide over Jess's shoulders in the dim shadows that pass over them as they get farther away.
Castiel does not understand, however, why the love of his life refuses to sleep with a blanket while they are on the road.
He pulls Castiel away and down the pier before he can hear Sam's quip. "Can I ask you something, Cas?"
Would he tell him that he really liked a particular man, more so than any woman he had ever dated? That the man was kind, carried his likeness by the gentle curve of his brow and strength of his heart, that he had saved Dean's life and turned it around because he unknowingly made Dean realize there was more to life than waiting for his father to come home and waiting for his father to leave again.
"Sam's birthday was the beginning of May," Dean explains. "Right before summer let out. I baked him a vegan cake, 'cuz that's what he asked for, and I put eighteen candles on it. Last year I put seventeen. The year before that I put sixteen, because I was there for every single birthday. You weren't."
"Castiel. It's nice to meet you too," Castiel says gruffly. "Although I wish it was in better circumstances."
Sam starts picking up the dirty dishes on the table and brings them to the kitchen. "It would be okay if you were, though. I've got gay friends, they're really nice. Dad is just an asshole, you know that."
Meanwhile, Dean slips the note under Castiel’s door and knocks heavily before quickly scurrying away. He watches from behind a corner, but Cas doesn’t open the door.
If John could see him now, practically begging for money just so his brother could fulfill a "pipe dream", then he would be so completely disappointed with Dean that he would go out on another bender and wouldn't show back up for weeks, maybe even a month or two.
Dean would mention it almost every day after that, saying that he found his person whenever he brought home a new friend from preschool that made him smile. Mary would entertain it, grinning widely and serving them both pre-packaged chocolate chip cookies and letting them play on the sand; and even John had played around with this childish idea for a while.
Dean forcibly shuts the voice off and pounds his fist on Bobby's door with a shaking hand. He can't quite breathe properly yet, and if he focuses enough he can feel Castiel's concerned stare on the back of his neck.
The sky is darkening in hues of purple, swirling around him and swallowing the light left from the day. As he's passing down an alley, he hears the struggling of somebody in a fight.
Dean bites his tongue to keep from crying. He was too tired for this. Too damn tired. He's cried enough today, really.
"We aren't exactly dating," Dean corrects, but the defense is weak and he knows it. Counting the carnival, the laundry--does folding laundry count as a date?-- the coffee shop, and now the July Fourth celebration, they've been on more than enough dates to be considered dating. "I also haven't seen you."
"Scared," Castiel finishes for him. Dean nods. "Your feelings are valid, Dean. Your fear--It's okay. Normal. You aren't alone."
"Dean, huh?" John scoffed and shook his head bitterly. "And how do you think he feels about you leaving? You ever tell him? Dean, what do you think about your little baby brother Samuel here leaving for college?"
Charlie hesitates, the smile on her face faltering into something more of an awkward grimace. "You could say we had a falling out, or something. It's cool though, we're still friends and all that."
The plate of food sits ignored as he goes over to the desk and takes out a sheet of paper and a pencil. Now, Dean was never one to really work with numbers, but he knew the bare minimum and he had to figure out if this goal was even going to be possible.
It then occurs to Dean that maybe Castiel has been through some shit, too. It makes sense, in retrospect, as nobody with any healthy no-trauma brain would ever fall in love with Dean. He shakes the thought off and enters the diner with Castiel by his side.
Jody also begins to grin and then steps forward, giving Castiel a tight hug. Dean watches as Cas flusters for a moment, not sure what to do with the sudden physical attention, but then sees how he melts into it with a soft smile. Adorable.
Dean looks back over at the entrance, just in time to see Castiel walk in. His breath catches with a smile at the sight.
They meet up with Sam and Jess after the ride on the Ferris Wheel, where by then the sky has gone a deep twilight. The glee in Jess's face as she's clutching a medium-sized stuffed bear under one arm is palpable from the streetlamp's light. Her other hand, Dean notices with a smirk, is still tightly linked with Sam's, who looks far too proud of himself.
His brother, the reason why he's taking this job to begin with. He was going to change the world someday; Dean could tell. Sam has always had these bright eyes, this drive in him to change the world. He told them, them being John and Dean, that he wanted to be a lawyer just last year, and while it was a disaster of a conversation, Dean had been secretly saving pennies ever since.
