If what Moriarty said was true, then at least they had the slimmest of chances to save both men. But if he continued to dither and didn't come to a decision, then both John and Lestrade would probably die.
"Still," John whispered right into Sherlock's ear, "I'm your first... the first one inside you, the first one to see you like this, aren't I?" He teased Sherlock's earlobe with his tongue, sucking it in between his teeth and nibbling on it. "Say it," John commanded, pressing his knot further inside Sherlock's narrow channel.
They stood there in silence until the water started bubbling and the kettle turned itself off. John brought the tray into the living room and set it down on the coffee table, poured the water, and sat down. Greg sat next to him, resting his elbows on his knees and interlacing his fingers as he struggled to find words.
Ever since Bill had left Afghanistan to be at Cilia's side for the birth of their child and spend the first few weeks together as a little family, John had been left completely to his own devices. Not that he was particularly unhappy about that. Bill's concerned looks, constant questions about his wellbeing, and permanent running off at the mouth about her omega turned John off and gave him a headache. He was downright relieved when Bill took off and he was finally left to wallow in silence.
As if a subconscious barrier akin to an iron cord which had been wrapped around John's heart suddenly broke loose, he felt more carefree and light than ever before. It was as if their talk that evening had set him irrevocably free and released him from the bonds of some unspoken fear: an apprehension that he hadn't even been aware was lurking somewhere inside him.
He lurched into the chancel and faltered for a fraction of a second. Windows towered above the panelled wall at the rear of the room, all the way up to the vaulted ceiling. They were decorated with colourful images of saints regarding the scene with mournful eyes.
Sherlock tore himself angrily out of the hug, tossed his hands in the air, and stomped into the living room, where he collapsed onto the couch with a dramatic sigh.
"As far as I'm aware, you were barely eighteen when he bonded with you. Were you his first omega?" Sherlock asked.
Sherlock pushed the door open and marched up to the desk, slapped his hands down on the desktop, and roared at his brother:
Following the practise session, Shari approached John. The rest of the class members cleaned up and went into the changing rooms.
Victor numbly leaned against the kitchen cupboard and stared into the coffee cup he'd intended to fill.
It was only now that John recognised the scent emanating from the man: he was obviously the alpha who owned the house, and therefore must be Sherlock's brother. John squared his shoulders and held out his hand.
Nearly two minutes passed before John heard grass rustling. Victor stood right next to him and touched John's shoulder with his. A friendly nudge.
"You're a bloody idiot!" John sighed and extricated himself from the other man. He rubbed his damp eyes, placed his hands on either side of Sherlock's face, and pressed a firm kiss onto his lips. "Never do that to me again!"
With a growl, John subjected the plates, glasses, and silverware to the same treatment as the cup until the sink was empty and the floor covered in shards and bits of food.
a voice shouted inside him. It reminded him in a little of his time in Afghanistan. Strict, military, demanding of respect. Hammered into him over many years. An automatic reaction to guarantee his survival.
Sherlock did as directed, although he felt fairly ridiculous. He tried to read from John's expression what his intentions were, but eventually decided to put his full focus and attention on the experiment. John's gaze rested patiently on his face as he repeatedly circled the puckered skin with two fingers, all the while lavishing Sherlock with one compliment after another.
Sherlock shakily inserted his hand between their perspiring bodies, grasping his twitching erection. It took barely a dozen pumping motions before his insides contracted and he curled up, moaning out loud. Sherlock's climax hit him like an electric shock, setting his nerve endings aflame; his brain simply switched off, leaving blessed silence behind. He collapsed onto his back, breathing hard.
Victor clasped Sherlock's face in both hands, leaned his forehead against Sherlock's, and panted against his raw lips.
Sherlock clung to John like a drowning man. His fingers dug so hard into John's arm and shoulder that it hurt, but John was happy to put up with it if the only thing he could offer Sherlock was to be there for him.
Her fingers dug painfully into his biceps when he undid the final button and gently swiped his thumb across her nipple, which stood to attention at his touch.
"So... last time you told me about your first kiss. That was... Christmas, right? At... Mark's place?"
"It does now. It's been refined further and doesn't make you high anymore. It has more of a numbing effect. You barely remember what happened for several hours after you take it."
Just a few minutes ago, he'd said good-bye to Sherlock, who had climbed aboard the train with his hand raised in farewell. He hadn't even turned around again. It was Saturday. They wouldn't see each other until Tuesday or Wednesday. They'd travelled to London together from the university to transfer at King's Cross. Sherlock was going on to Sussex, Victor to Manchester. The family gathering. But Victor's train was delayed. By about an hour, according to the departure board. He stuffed the scrap of paper with the train number and original departure time into his jacket pocket and ran both hands down his face. He was so tired he felt it all the way down to his bones, having barely slept the last couple of nights.
"Still! The fact that you even noticed someone was watching us... and how quickly you reacted! Plus, even if this bloke doesn't turn out to be the murderer, he attacked and gravely injured that beta female – he'll have to stand charges for that alone. He was acting so suspicious anyway, he must be involved in something," John surmised.
"Slow," Greg said, confirming John's assumption. "The files are stacking up on my desk and the solve rate on cases has fallen sharply. I think I learned a lot from Sherlock over the years, but... to be able to think like him..." Greg shrugged helplessly, crossed his arms and shook his head without finishing his sentence.
"On holiday? No wonder you're so upset," John jested, but when Sherlock stopped in his tracks and shot him an angry glare over his shoulder, he cleared his throat as if to drown out what he'd just said.
Sebastian pressed his lips together so hard that the blood was forced out of them completely. His eyes flitted across the floor of the tiny room as if seeking an anchor point. His scent took on a bitter, rotten note.
Sherlock's right hand darted back and dug into John's thigh, not sure whether to hold him back or pull him closer. The air froze in his lungs as if he'd been slugged in the solar plexus. He was so full, stretched to the limit, barely able to perceive anything other than the indescribable sensation that seemed to permeate every fibre of his being.
Seeing John emerge from his room that afternoon, all recovered and seemingly with no effects whatsoever from the last few days, had poured additional fuel on the fire of Sherlock's discontent. The alpha hadn't even offered to help when he'd seen Sherlock struggling with the soiled mattress. Sherlock had had to explicitly demand that he do his part. And then John had made himself breakfast without so much as considering whether to ask Sherlock if he wanted something too.
Sherlock's heart rate increased rapidly, his temperature started to rise, and a deep-seated sense of frustration forged a path through him. He instinctively held the flailing, whimpering boy closer and took a step backwards.
Moriarty chuckled softly and turned the camera onto himself again. "Very good, Sherlock. Of course I won't just let John go. No, no, no... I have a much more...
"What do you want from me?" Victor asked calmly, leaning his head back and letting his gaze wander slowly and provocatively down Sherlock's body. "Should I suck you? Make everything come true that I told you in the car?"
The taxi stopped in front of the station. They paid and got out, then went to buy tickets for the return trip to London. The next train was leaving in an hour, so they decided to get something to eat first. They ordered greasy fish and chips at a stand, then stood there listlessly eating and washing it down with sweet fizzy drinks while they watched the comings and goings in the station.
There was nothing he could do except wait and run his hand absently over his unbroken skin, hoping it might give John some measure of relief. Probably not. It was probably just an old wives' tale that the link worked in both directions.
"I haven't expressed my condolences on the loss of your alpha yet. How have you been handling it? I imagine it must be terrible."
John couldn't understand why the officer had returned at all, after an incident like that. And yet he had resumed his post less than half a year after the terrible accident, and in doing so had ended up rubbing John's nose daily and in a particularly graphic manner in a version of his own fate which he had only narrowly escaped.
John kissed him again. His fingers dug into the firm flesh of Sherlock's arse, kneading the muscle lasciviously. "Yes," John breathed out, the sound barely audible, and sucked Sherlock's lower lip in between his teeth. "Tell me what position you want to do it in."
Victor stared at the young man without batting an eye. John was still deeply irritated that this Nick fellow looked so bafflingly similar to James Moriarty. He would have liked nothing better than to grab Victor by the collar and ask him if he didn't see it. But what would be the point? Victor had probably never met Moriarty and would hardly understand the awful feeling that the sight of him triggered in John.
"Erm, my pleasure..." John replied as he handed the bouquet of pink and white lilies over to Anthea so she could put them in a vase.
John reluctantly pulled back and straightened up. His omega tasted exquisite, and he wanted nothing more than to drink the essence directly from the source... eventually. But right now, he needed to be inside Sherlock. John was painfully hard. His erection throbbed with every beat of his heart, producing a large bead of pre-cum as he shoved first two, then three fingers into Sherlock's arse.
"I wanted to say good-bye." The statement was made in his usual friendly-neutral tone. One of his many masks that John couldn't see through. Somewhat discombobulated, John met Mycroft's eye, the unspoken question of 'why' hovering between them. A moment later, however, John realised what this all meant.
"I just think we should... come to some sort of arrangement, considering – " John cut himself off and looked around the breakfast table as if he'd find the missing words there.
"Yeah..." John agreed curtly, collapsing a little more into himself. He was so terribly dizzy. His grip on the bottle tightened, as if it would help keep him upright. He drank some more of the amber-coloured liquid and wiped his mouth. He'd already drained over half of the bottle.
Growling, John sucked the heady mixture into his mouth again before finally withdrawing his teeth. He licked the wound greedily: an angry red oval ringed by the impressions of his teeth. He wrapped his arms around Sherlock's body and heaved him up out of the chair to press his rock-hard erection against his omega's backside. He was greatly relieved when Sherlock pushed his arse back into John and moaned out loud, rather than running away as John had feared he might.
He strode forcefully into the living room, where Sherlock lay curled up on the couch with his back turned to the world.
John grinned broadly when Bill appeared moments later with Henry balanced on her hip. The first thing Sherlock noticed was the nearly two-year-old boy's fair hair and blue eyes. He was mouthing at his fist, and when he swung it through the air, strings of spittle flew off it. He protested loudly when Bill caught his little arm and tried to restrain it. As soon as she'd set the youngster gently down on the floor, he ran to Cilia and flung his arms around her knees. From there, he peered curiously up at John and Sherlock.
"Oh, right..." When John had told him several days ago about his therapy session and Ella's idea, Victor had wanted to know whether a visit to Mr and Mrs Holmes was part of the plan. John still wasn't sure if he wanted to see Sherlock's parents. It was beyond his comprehension that they hadn't come to the funeral. It was true that Victor had also wanted to avoid the media circus, but John thought it was different for his parents. Wasn't it?
He watched as Victor took one of the notebooks and leafed through it, furrowing his brow in thought and returning repeatedly to the same page. After placing a pen between the pages, he picked up the other notebook and flipped through it too.
"Damn it, Sherlock..." John protested half-heartedly. Embarrassed at his misjudgement and the obvious signs of intimacy between himself and Sherlock, John averted his eyes.
John's eyes landed with interest on the woman's hand: she was tapping the keys on her Blackberry at a tremendous pace, switching between windows in next to no time, as if she were working on five different things at the same time. Presumably nothing less was expected of the personal assistant to the most powerful man in Great Britain.
But the knot wasn't inside yet. Neither John's nor that of the alpha dildo. The actual experiment he'd set out to perform wasn't completed yet. Not by a long shot. Impatient now, he forced himself down onto the silicon knot, feeling the way his muscle ring stretched a little more each time.
"Don't...!" The single word spilled out of Sherlock's mouth before he could even think about it. Panic bubbled just under the surface of his skin, making him flip back and forth between anger and despair.
It wasn't until Victor broke the kiss that Sherlock looked at him. His gaze was clouded, his pupils blown wide. Victor examined Sherlock's face. He gasped at the sight of the reddened lips, the unfocused eyes; his heart felt as if it had slid straight down into his stomach. A wave of desire washed over him, and he buried his face in the crook of Sherlock's neck, where he greedily inhaled his scent and licked the sensitive skin there. At the same time, he wrapped his arms around Sherlock's torso so hard it was almost painful, pulling him closer and digging his fingers into the layers of clothing.
John feels the vibration of his mobile and retrieves it from his pocket with knitted brows he opens the incoming message.
They ate dinner together, then watched a documentary on BBC and had an animated discussion over it. Afterwards, Sarah helped John to set up the sofa bed, and they said good-night. It was pleasant to spend time with her, and it all felt very natural.
Sherlock snorted in contempt. No, no: nothing had changed in that respect. It was just hormones gone wild in this extreme situation. There was no other explanation possible. Biology, as John always said. The uproar inside him would calm down as soon as the heat was over. They'd have to find a solution to their living situation at that point. There was no way he would be regularly spending any future heats with John.
Bill trailed off, nonplussed, when John froze in the middle of the room and gaped at her with his mouth hanging open.
Once Sherlock had finished blow-drying his hair, they took a stroll through the local streets. Sherlock didn't much care where they ate, but John seemed to have some vague idea where he wanted to go, so Sherlock let him take the lead. He'd lost his appetite anyway, and he couldn't promise he'd be able to get much down.
"Oy, Murray. Behave!" John laughed and took Sherlock's luggage. Sherlock followed the two alphas at a distance of two paces all the way to Bill's car.
Across from the sofa was an open passageway to the kitchen, in the middle of which stood a table – also covered with junk – and a single folding chair. More folded-up chairs leaned against the wall. Several articles of clothing lay randomly strewn across the floor.
idea. I was just trying to do you a favour! But you don't see that because you're so wrapped up in yourself you can't see anything other than your own problems." John headed for the door. "I'm going to have a shower and then go to work. I'll look for a new flat directly afterwards."
"Mycroft," Anthea hissed, which surprised Sherlock more than his brother's unfortunate choice of words. He looked back and forth between the two of them, but decided to simply answer the question for the sake of keeping the peace.
Sherlock stilled for a moment. He had rolled his head to one side, his eyes closed and his breath irregular, and was holding onto the pillow with both hands. His eyelids fluttered open, his gaze unsteady and confused. Adrenaline was rushing through his veins, fogging his mind. He watched as Victor grabbed Ryan's upper arm and held on hard. His skin white where the fingers dug into his flesh. Irritation flashed on Ryan's face.
"Yes. Yes, of course. I was just wondering how much progress Lestrade has made with the case. I'll send him a text," Sherlock replied and headed for his room. Once inside, he closed the door quietly behind himself.
Did he feel guilty? Responsible for the fact that his little brother had fallen victim to that villain? That he hadn't been able to act? Was he dealing with the consequences of his powerlessness? Was he able to sleep at night without drowning in his own guilt?
Of course his omega had made him do all the dishes himself, but that came as no surprise to John anymore, nor was it something that even bothered him.
"Well then," Sherlock said, walking past him into the hallway. "We'll be seeing each other, all right?"
Sherlock wanted to protest, but Victor shook his head. "It's all right. It doesn't change anything about how I feel. I'll always be there for you, Sherlock. Which doesn't mean I'm not still bloody angry with you!" Victor furrowed his brow and gave Sherlock a sober look. "Why are you here and not at the hospital with John?"
Victor stood up unhurriedly and strolled over to the desk at the front of the room. His eyes wandered over the lecturer, his friendly face, his attractive figure in its perfectly tailored grey suit... if things had been different, he would have done this a long time ago. But the way things stood... he swiftly swept the thought aside, focussing instead on his plan.
"I'm sure you can imagine how disappointed I was when I found it. Hidden in one of his little romance novels. As if I wouldn't notice when my omega tried to hide something from me."
"I offered him a tidy little sum at first to assist his family and leave the rest of the fortune untouched. But John wouldn't hear of it. These papers are just copies of course. He'll keep the originals in a safe deposit box if he's smart. That includes all of the account movements of the past six years along with the mandate to pay you a monthly amount covering your rent and basic cost of living; although that expired as soon as it was signed over to him. He has control over everything now, as you can see," Mycroft said, looking down at Sherlock with one eyebrow arched.
To John's great bewilderment, Bill didn't drive to the stately manor where he had visited her last time; instead, she pulled into the driveway of a two-storey, ivy-bedecked stone cottage.
"I'm sorry. It's not you; you're a wonderful person, and I'm sure I could have been very happy with you. But it just wouldn't be right."
Tom pushed his hand away, gently but firmly, and gave Victor a sidelong apologetic smile. Victor rolled his eyes and dug around for his cigarettes, slid one between his lips, and lit it. The blue haze between them couldn't hide his disgruntlement.
Sherlock shrugged with one shoulder. "Of course. I never wished for you to come to any harm… much less for you to die. Mycroft said I was crazy from the start, since bonding with a soldier on active duty can also be life-threatening for their omega."
be here when he does, isn't that obvious?!" Sherlock barked, watching with satisfaction as John flinched before swallowing and giving him a curt nod.
Sherlock frowned with concentration as he tried as hard as he could to read John's mind from his expression.
"What the hell, Victor?!" John barked once they'd climbed into the back seat and set off. "Where do you know that nutter from?"
"Eighteen months since our last appointment," she said, her hands resting on the arms of her chair, her legs crossed. She appeared sterner than she sounded.
John grabbed Sherlock's wrist roughly, twisted his arm back, and brought it down between their bodies.
In hindsight, it turned out that Cilia had never been one hundred percent behind the notion of a 'live-action' donor. Of course she did want a baby, but more than that, she didn't want to lose Bill. She'd been more afraid of that than ever in the wake of the ugly incident in the Afghan bordello, and as a consequence had given in to repeated pressure from Bill.
They weren't finished talking about the past and sketching out the future yet. It was clear they would need more time for that. It seemed impossible to lay out everything that had happened over the past few years on the table and dissect it without coming up against new hurdles and breaking out in an argument over some misunderstanding or another.
John performed something between a shrug and a nod, which earned him another smile. He followed Victor to the coat-check, which for some strange reason wasn't near the entrance to Deep Purple, but close to the bar. John dug his phone out of his jacket and stuffed it into his trouser pocket before dragging the heavy-duty article off his shoulders and passing it to Victor.
, and not as possessions that alphas trade back and forth! I can't stand the thought of someone… that that Lord expressed an interest in you, purely because he sees you as an object that can satisfy some fleeting desire."
Since John could also smell him over such a short distance, it didn't take long before he came down the stairs to greet his omega. He held a dark red knitted jumper in one hand. He still hadn't brought all of his clothes down to the bedroom, since Sherlock also kept various disguises in the wardrobe which he occasionally used during investigations, in addition to his own clothes.
Sherlock winced at the loud proclamation. His eyes darted to John to gauge his reaction to the almost-word which could mean so much more than he was comfortable with. But how high was the probability that a toddler who had never seen his biological father could recognise him by smell? Sherlock wasn't aware of any studies along those lines.
Bill laughed as she got out of the car and opened the boot so John could remove his meagre belongings.
He'd forgotten to bring his phone. And Anthea's labour had already been going on for three hours. Sherlock refused to go into the delivery room, preferring to sit in the waiting room in his state of half-dress, Anthea's bag between his feet and wringing his hands. There were only two other people there at such an ungodly hour: an alpha who was nervously pacing back and forth – probably a father-to-be – and a young beta who was disinterestedly leafing through yet another magazine and snapping their gum.
Sherlock nodded mutely, uncertain what was expected of him. He was surprised to see that John didn't open the lube right away, but instead kissed his way slowly down Sherlock's chest and stomach until his chin bumped against the tip of Sherlock's cock. He deposited one single kiss onto the reddened crown and lapped up some of the pre-come just as their eyes met.
Sherlock made an affirmative sound and clambered to his feet. He casually stepped out of his clothes, pulled on a pair of pyjama trousers, and held one hand out to John.
His hands still raised, Greg glanced quickly at Sherlock, then back to John when he made another threatening sound. "Sorry, mate! I had no idea that – I didn't want to bother you, just wanted to drop off the McKenzie file that Sherlock asked for."
Victor nodded once. "All right." He rubbed Sherlock's back again, enjoying the casual intimacy. Sherlock rested his head on Victor's shoulder, lazily traced his collarbone, and let his eyes wander around the room. Each man silently pursued his own train of thought, listening to the quiet sounds in the room. Breathing. Skin on cloth. The muted cacophony of the street.
"Oh God," Sherlock wheezed, crossing his arms behind John's neck and his legs around John's hips. At the same time, he arched his pelvis forward and squeezed his internal muscles together so that John's cock wouldn't fall out of him during the manoeuvre.
"Fuck, you're so hot." The words huffed out against his neck. Sweet pain where blood vessels burst beneath tender skin. Large, warm hands under the borrowed black shirt, on his bare stomach, in the sweat-damp groove of his backbone. A hand stumbling over the heavy-duty material of his jeans and grabbing his arse, eagerly drawing him closer to the other body.
John's heart rate increased for five or six beats as an invisible weight fell from his shoulders. He felt several kilograms lighter as he hurried up the steps after Sherlock.
John returned to London a few days before Christmas – for the first time since his foreign tour of duty had begun. It was only then that he noticed how much he'd missed this old hellhole. The maddening crowds, the overflowing tube cars, the bouquet of aromas that designated all of the different neighbourhoods. Pubs, green lawns, rain – even the surly denizens of the big city. London was where his omega was. London was home.
Abigail, who was driving, explained that there would be more than fifty guests from various years of study. "So we should definitely bring sleeping bags along, so we can sleep there. They're sure not to have enough on hand."
Victor grumbled softly. Four days had passed now, and he hadn't heard anything from Sherlock. He was most likely studying for his tests, Abigail kept telling him, but Victor's only comment on such statements was an indistinct grunt followed by the lighting of another cigarette.
John promptly scooted closer to him, rested his chin on Sherlock's chest, and watched him attentively.
And despite the fact that they shared a closeness and intimacy that was only possible between alphas and omegas; despite the fact that John had bound Sherlock to him with his knot more than once; despite the fact that they were bonded to each other for the rest of their lives, it was that delicate kiss that had touched him the most deep inside. The feeling had spread through him like a gentle light, illuminating his darkest corners and driving away his shadows.
John was happy these days – happier than he'd ever dreamt possible. Not back when he'd met an extraordinary omega in the lab at St Bart's six years ago, and not when he'd moved onto Baker Street twelve months ago and thrown a pile of dishware against the wall.
John eventually nodded his agreement, squeezed his hands into fists to release some of the tension, and went over to the bed. Before he scooted up to Cilia on the mattress, he hooked his fingers into his underpants and pulled them off. He couldn't help noticing the way that Cilia's eyes widened in surprise when her eye fell on his alpha cock. Although he was still flaccid, John knew that he presented an impressive sight. The genitals of male alphas, even unaroused, were larger than most beta penises when erect. And his was apparently the first one the omega had seen up close.
"You went to the Yard and played it up to him in order to get the file, didn't you? Did you flirt with him, Sherlock? Did he
"That must have been difficult for Sherlock..." John said, turning more pages. There were no more pictures with Redbeard. Instead, there were lots of individual portraits of Sherlock during his school years. There was rarely anything like a smile on any of the pictures, and when there was, it was more like a distortion at the corners of his mouth. No happiness was visible in the silver-blue eyes.
Sherlock flinched at the volume and sought out John's eyes. There, he found anger and worry reflected back at him. Fingers dug into Sherlock's hips and waist, holding him as still as possible.
It was the first time in a long while that John felt an urge to connect more closely with a beta. Of course, he'd had romantic partners before and had even fancied himself in love. But the feeling that Mary stirred up in him was something more intense. Something more than a simple case of mutual attraction and lust. Something that deserved to be handled with care and patience.
Following a restless night in which John hadn't been able to fall asleep until Sherlock had drawn him in close and nestled John's head into the crook of his neck, both men awoke too early, feeling as if they'd been run over by a lorry. The strange bed with its sagging mattress had only added to John's bad mood, such that his anguished concern from the previous day slowly but surely progressed into anger.
"It's... probably completely mad, but.... When Greg and Mrs Hudson were abducted, there was a book found in both of their flats, and I'm pretty sure it was the same one. Pretty odd coincidence, wouldn't you say?" John asked tentatively.
Once on board, John and Sherlock sat next to each other; they didn't speak, but their hands were clasped, resting on the armrest between them. Both were lost in their own thoughts, uncertain about what might be coming.
Lestrade took his time clearing his throat, then picked up the file folder and stood. "Never mind. I'll... need your signature on some papers. If you wouldn't mind coming with me? Your brother can –"
"I wanted to see how you were doing. Face to face. Text messages are so... impersonal. Hard to judge. And maybe I also had a small amount of hope that we... I mean, now that we've... now that the limits are clear, I thought maybe we could try to build up a friendship again. It would be nice if we could have a drink sometime, have a chat. Just as friends, of course."
John watched with a pensive expression as Sherlock absently rubbed the scar on his left shoulder before slipping into the shirt he'd laid out earlier.
"Ex- experiment." Sherlock tensed his thighs in preparation for another pistoning motion, but his alpha prevented him.
"Need you," Sherlock said breathily between heated kisses and a well-executed hip swivel that had precisely the effect he wanted on John. "Your knot. Want you inside me."
Feeling along the bed frame, he found another remote control in a holder, which was needed to work the various functions of the bed. There was a strange humming sound when he raised, then lowered, the head of the bed until he'd found a comfortable height.
"Well, Dr Watson. I feel certain that this sum should suffice to cover the costs for your sister's treatment and part of your parents' debts—"
John felt a rising sense of hope when he saw that Mycroft was giving the proposal serious consideration.
Before he realised what was happening, Sherlock's head was pushed back down into the pillow. Hands grabbed his hips, dragging him around and moving him into position, followed by the establishment of a merciless rhythm that made Sherlock moan mindlessly into the bedding. The slap of skin against skin echoed in his ears and John's guttural snarls made the hair on the back of his neck stand on end.
Sherlock, who had barely slowed his movement while devouring the scene in front of him, now bent down to John and kissed him, teasing John's tongue with his. He climaxed shortly thereafter. Pushing deep into John's body, he was only partially able to hold back a groan that sounded as if it were verging on pain. He threw his head back and gasped audibly for air, lazily rotating his hips in order to enjoy the last few drops of pleasure.
A wide, covered patio was visible at the back of the house, from which three stone steps descended into the garden. Colourful flowerbeds were scattered as if at random around the meticulously trimmed lawn, displaying the mark of a highly talented gardener. Small oases of calm could be found dotted about in the form of a stone bench or a shade-giving tree, a small pavilion or a garden swing beside a burbling water feature. To the right side of the fence stood a solidly built, stone masonry gardening shed.
"No," Mike objected. "Human. No alpha or beta would have fared any better than you in the same situation, Sherlock."
Instead, they cooked some food and ate together, then tidied up and, after a moment's hesitation, went together into Sherlock's room to share the bed. John offered to go upstairs if they didn't feel ready to take this step yet, but Sherlock insisted. He'd already spent too many nights without John; he knew how much he would miss having his alpha close by.
The two paramedics were betas, Sherlock was relieved to see. He led them up to the bedroom and watched fretfully as they helped Anthea to her feet and led her down the stairs. Sherlock carried her bag down and watched with mixed feelings as Anthea disappeared into the ambulance.
He thought of Molly Hooper, the young pathologist at St Bartholomew's Hospital, and the way she'd always watched him when she thought he wasn't looking. Sherlock had always attributed her obvious interest to the fact that he was an omega, assuming that she was fascinated by his unusual lifestyle. But would he have thought the same thing if she'd been an alpha?
Sherlock's earnestly spoken words should have placated John, but alarm bells started to clang at the back of his mind. Sherlock had already sounded pretty upset last night when he'd tried to talk to John. But John had been too caught up in his anger for his omega to be able to get through to him.
John leapt to his feet, spitting mad, and approached his uninvited guest with his index finger raised. "How dare you?! I can drink as much as I want to, got it? You've got no right to make rules for me!" John snapped. His head was pounding and he almost lost his balance. When Victor reached out to steady him, John tore himself away and shoved the other man away angrily.
Something tugged at the corner of Sherlock's mouth, but it disappeared again so quickly that it wasn't certain whether it had been there at all. "What am I supposed to say to that?" he said sourly and left the tiny office.
"I didn't intend to speak with my mother about it, or anyone else for that matter. I'm sorry if I've embarrassed you."
Before he knew what was happening, Victor had pulled him to his feet and was kissing him hard, pushing his tongue deep into Sherlock's mouth. Sherlock's knees protested painfully after having knelt on the hard floor for so long.
He'd never seen anything like that before. Was it even possible? An alpha with another alpha. It was... strange. It was wrong. Unnatural.
"It's better this way. More room for everyone," his flatmate announced and clapped her hands. Grinning broadly, she went back into the kitchen to work on dinner some more. She put on a pair of oven mitts and took a baking sheet with a batch of cupcakes out of the oven. There were more already cooling on the kitchen table.
Sherlock's clothes were strewn across the bathroom floor. John poked the carelessly discarded pile with his toes, making out a pair of suit trousers, a jacket, and a white shirt.
"But why did you have to make me deceased for that?" he asked, and his voice didn't sound half as angry as he'd wanted to make it. His left hand felt its way across the sheets as if of its own accord, searching for the small remote control device, and grasped it firmly, although without increasing the dose of the pain medication. He didn't want to show Mycroft even more of his weakness.
"Shouldn't be more than a couple of weeks, I reckon," John replied with a grin and gave Cilia's arm a gentle squeeze. "Take care."
Sherlock shrugged with one shoulder, giving no further response. It was clear he didn't want to discuss the topic any more just then.
John latched onto the frantic pulsing of Victor's carotid artery as warm hands wandered up his thighs. They seized John's backside and kneaded the firm flesh through the rough denim of his jeans. At the same time, Victor arched his pelvis up toward John, rubbing his constricted erection against him. The contact sent an erotic prickling sensation through John's groin. He sighed softly and lifted himself up. He looked down at Victor with a feverish gaze, noting how hard he was breathing and how wide his pupils were.
John slowly wrapped his arms around Sherlock's middle and drew the omega up against his chest. He dropped feather-light kisses on the oval scar that he was responsible for.
"It was the first time he had control over the fate of another human life. Even though he liked Mrs Hudson, it must have been difficult for him to make that final decision. In the end, his sense of justice won out, and made him to the world's only consulting detective. He assumed great responsibility even back then in order to protect people who couldn't do it themselves... Sherrinford recognised that."
It might be said, however, that John's life took a rather positive turn on the morning of the third day – a fact which his omega failed to notice. He got out of bed feeling as if he could uproot trees with his bare hands. He'd never felt better in his life. He hadn't even experienced such euphoria when he'd received his diploma from medical school or approval to join the military. He felt that his life had new meaning, and understood that the time for lamentation was finally past. He was an alpha, and the world was his oyster!
Victor had paused in his remarks and looked over at John, unwilling to continue discussing the matter. Resigned, Greg had slipped his notes into the breast pocket of his jacket and pulled out a calling card, which he'd handed to Victor. Then he'd turned to John.
While John rests next to Sherlock's hip, he thrusts relentlessly into his fist, chasing after his own climax, which gathers, tingling, in the middle of his body. Panting, he puts his forehead against Sherlock's groin, feels how the sharp hip bone pushes into his cheek. The muscles in his thighs and back are tense as the orgasm finally rolls over him and tears a hoarse moan out of him.
Sherlock thought about it for a moment, then shrugged. "It's difficult to describe. Sometimes we can feel or sense what the other one is feeling, either physically or emotionally. Even across great distances. It's... I don't know... as if I weren't alone anymore. John is always there, even when he's not physically present. He's a part of me, in the most literal sense. And I don't ever want to be without that again." Sherlock's gaze became unfocused as he thought of John. At any other time, he would have kicked himself for making such a pathetic statement. But he needed to make Mike understand how much John and the soul bond meant to him in order to explain the reason for this appointment.
All of these thoughts shot through John's head, eventually channelling into the rebuff he gave as his reply: "Forget it, Sherlock. You'll just have to handle it yourself!"
A couple of flicks of the wrist later and Mary had been relieved of her service pistol and placed in handcuffs. She acquiesced silently to the procedure, but her displeasure was clear.
Sherlock is kneeling naked on the bed with his back turned to John. His legs are spread wide. The view of his erect penis and tense testicles is unhindered, the entire area shaved smoothly and alarmingly intimate. To have his arms free Sherlock's upper body is resting on his chest and shoulders. Bracing his right wrist on his butt, tense fingers are clasping the wide end of a flexible object protruding from his arse. It’s a black dildo, shimmering wet in the lamplight. Stunned, John observes as the hand’s movements seamlessly transfer to the dildo; as it smoothly slides into his body and out again; as choppy breaths and wanton sounds writhe from the man’s throat.
John frowned in displeasure, glaring daggers at Mycroft. It took a concerted effort for him to hold back the cutting retort that burned on the tip of his tongue, but he was fairly certain he wouldn't get anywhere with an attack on this man.
Sherlock approached the bed obediently and let himself be pulled down onto the mattress on Victor's side. His body was a welcome weight pressing against Victor's chest. Terry-cloth under his fingers, damp where it had absorbed the water clinging to Sherlock's body. The scent of hotel soap combined with Sherlock's own personal smell. Victor wrapped his arm around Sherlock's waist and rubbed his back casually. Their eyes met. Quicksilver-blue. Fingers in wet hair, tracing the path of the drops down the back of Sherlock's neck.
Jean-Baptiste raised his eyebrows at Sherlock, returning the thin-lipped smile. John had the impression that the two omegas shared a secret he wasn't privy to. But then Jean-Baptiste shook his head and pointed at something behind John.
"Things are going well. The therapy sessions are fairly annoying, and I'm often bored to tears, but –"
A pleasant shiver ran through Sherlock, making his nipples harden and tickling his balls. He blinked frantically several times to rid himself of the feeling, but it lingered like a stubborn stain.
Sherlock sat on the edge of his seat, his eyes round, and stared at John in horror. He reached out one finger as if intending to touch John's scar, but stopped halfway there and pulled his hand back. He smeared his index and middle fingers across his lips and cleared his throat lightly.
Sherlock was a little surprised at how quietly the morning passed. The second day of his first heat had gone by in a similar manner. Feeling relaxed and in a state of equilibrium as long as John was nearby, he took advantage of the peace and quiet to hydrate and doze on the sofa in the sunlight that fell through the window.
Sherlock sprang to his feet and took one decisive step in John's direction, grasped the door with one hand and put the other on the jamb, and glared down at John threateningly. "Do you really think you can make me jealous? That I would be bothered if you go sniffing around someone else? And a beta at that?!" Sherlock all but spat the epithet at John's feet. "You've never interested me in the past, and you don't interest me now either!"
Later, once they were back at the flat and had wished each other good-night, John noticed Sherlock pick up the self-help book to take it with him to his room.
The knot throbbed in time with his and Sherlock's heartbeats. A shared staccato. A silent symphony played on invisible notes. Soundless except for rattling breaths and a soft sob
"He hasn't revealed anything yet. He simply lets the interrogations happen with a manic smile on his face, and..." Mycroft cut himself off and casually plucked a couple of invisible bits of fuzz off his trouser leg.
John would have liked to look around a little longer, but the omega hurried ahead of them to open a mahogany-coloured door at the end of the hall. She gave John a courteous nod and Sherlock a sympathetic look – or so it appeared to John – before she closed the door behind them.
The word echoed in John's mind. He wished for nothing more than to hear Sherlock's voice. Even if it were just his whinging, his complaints over the fact that there was no case for him to solve, that the world – and Mycroft in particular – had it out for him. Or his endless monologues about ash. Deducing chat-show guests.
"Bill..." John gasped with surprise as he tore open the envelope and withdrew a stiff card along with a letter.
They stopped outside the Diogenes Club. The driver got out with John and opened the black door of the gentlemen's club for him. At least Mycroft didn't seem to have woken up any other employees in order to arrange this meeting. After the driver had escorted John to Mycroft's office, knocked, and opened the door, he tapped the visor of his cap and left John standing there.
"Nothing special... he wasn't very talkative. I apologised for everything. You know, that we stirred up things that apparently still affect him so deeply. I also tried to explain why we had to do it. But he didn't really seem to be listening. I'm sure his wife will be able to cheer him up... I hope."
But James Moriarty had made a serious error in judgment if he thought the decision would be a difficult one for Sherlock to make. Without wasting a second glance at the other man, Sherlock closed the last few metres to the church and rushed into the building. He couldn't help hearing Moriarty close the car door, start the engine, and drive away.
Sherlock moaned when John dug his teeth harder into the skin around the scar. His cock twitched lasciviously and grew hard; clear ejaculate fluid welled up from the slit and oozed over the rim of the glans. He felt fresh slick collecting in his hole, enabling the knot to slide back and forth more easily.
Perplexed, Lestrade and Anderson gaze after the slowly retreating figure. John nods in the direction of both men and then catches up with Sherlock. "Okay?" He murmurs, studying his friend's profile carefully.
Sherlock had already slipped out of his silk dressing gown, and looked at John with surprise. "Of course I want to. Haven't we already discussed it enough?"
His left arm had lost almost all feeling and his hand was like ice. He finally gave in and shifted the duffle to the other side. He hissed in a breath when he shook his left arm, causing pain like a thousand needles to shoot through the extremity up to his shoulder.
Victor sat up as well and sighed as if bored. "What's your problem?" he asked coolly. For a moment, absolute silence reigned in the room.
Sherlock's entire focus narrowed to the few square centimetres of his most intimate area. His body already felt overfull, so he was hypersensitive to being opened even further by the knot until it finally surmounted the muscle ring – already stretched to the breaking point – and settled deep inside. Both Sherlock and John moaned in unison as the climax broke over them like a monstrous wave, virtually fusing them to each other.
Mycroft rolled his eyes in annoyance and set the porcelain cup down on its saucer with a light clink. John couldn't say why, but the elder Holmes had the air of having been caught red-handed.
She yanked her arm away, but took the card and put it into the breast pocket of her shirt before leaving the kitchen too.
fun part! Sherlock, would you be so kind as to open the box," Moriarty asked in an excruciatingly cordial tone of voice.
John angrily slammed his fist onto the floor. Pain flashed through his hand, but he welcomed it as it distracted him a bit from the tightness in his chest. Grinding his teeth, he took his phone out of his trouser pocket and selected Victor's number from the contact list.
"Yes, I took the day off seeing as I've barely had a wink of sleep for the past few days," John replied.
"I'm not so sure about that," John sighed. "The way I just showed up at my parents' as if I had every right to. My lack of compassion for Harry. And now? What have I left behind other than burnt bridges, pain, and a big mess? Without me, Harry would have never–"
John went down the stairs on wobbly legs to the first floor. He resisted his – now well established – instinct to protect himself by fleeing at the first sign of a confrontation with Sherlock. At a minimum, the fact that he was still wearing his pyjamas made any notion of running away impractical.
When the doorbell rang that evening, John struggled his way out of his chair. He staggered out of the flat and down the stairs on unsteady feet. He felt dizzy and his head was pounding. It wasn't until he was halfway down that he realised he was holding the bottle of whisky in his hand. He took a big sip and twisted the knob to open the door without giving it another thought.
Irritated, John watches as Sherlock piles up the empty plates and clears the table. He hadn't even realised that advertisements were running.
Beyond that, the upheaval which had been set in motion by the Never Again movement continued apace. The four Moran omegas were constantly being interviewed and invited to talk shows and events related to the new consciousness surrounding omegahood. As a result, they achieved a level of fame they weren't exactly comfortable with.
Later that afternoon, when John was helping his mother with the washing up and Sherlock was perusing the third photo album with John's father, Lorraine looked at her son with a fond expression.
"I know," John answered. He pressed his lips onto the oval mark which his teeth had left on Sherlock's flawless skin five years ago. "As soon as my knot's gone down, I'll go upstairs so you can rest."
"I'm curious, Mr Holmes, why you haven't seen an omega doctor? Don't you think a specialist would better be able to respond to your …
But sleep evaded him. Sherlock stared at the ceiling, restless and troubled, and thought about John lying in his bed as well, also reflecting on the day's events and wondering whether Sherlock had tried to erase John from his life with drugs.
The corners of Sherlock's mouth took on a stubborn edge, and he looked as if he were about to blurt out a snotty response. But a sidelong glance at the reference book and then at John's insecure smile caused his posture to relax, and he nodded in agreement.
"It's all right, Jeremy. I'll take care of Dr Watson." The familiar figure of Mycroft's assistant Anthea appeared behind the glass-and-chrome barrier and held out a laminated card over the card reader to open the turnstile. She didn't take her eyes off her Blackberry for so much as a second the entire time.
She glanced pointedly between his legs and reached for the belt of her kimono to loosen it. "You know..." The silky material gaped open, revealing her nude figure. "You don't have to sleep on the couch if you don't want to..."
"All right, fine," he grumbled and flung the blanket aside, swinging his legs out of bed. The rug was soft under his feet. The floorboards underneath creaked loudly when he stood up and glanced at his phone screen. 5:13. No messages. Some things simply never changed. At least he'd slept for a couple of hours. Maybe three. The strange dreams weren't enticing enough to keep John for long.
so good. Sherlock only vaguely registered the arms that had twined their way around his waist; hands crossing his slender back as if seeking something before finally grabbing hold. Sought and found. Chest to chest. Heartbeat to heartbeat. Eyes dark with desire. Sherlock paused, studying the other man's blissful expression. Frantic breaths on both their parts.
John murmured a half-hearted greeting to the room at large, which was ignored by two of the three other women occupying the room. He dragged a chair over to the narrow space beside Harry's bed.
"Just slow down a mo', yeah? He was my in with Tiger, who I met under slightly different circumstances than you – as you may recall. You and Sherlock, you're the ones who didn't let me in on the whole story. How in the world was I supposed to know that Tiger and Moran were the same person?!"
They didn't want to carry out the coupling in Bill and Cilia's bedroom or in the room where John was staying. Instead, they settled on another guest room in the back of the house, far from the areas Bill and Cilia frequented so that the scent of the conjugal act wouldn't linger where they could smell it. The situation was difficult enough for everyone concerned, even though the couple – especially Bill – continued to assure John that he had nothing to fear from her as a rival alpha, and that everything would happen with mutual consent.
"Of course you haven't," John huffed derisively, although it wasn't unexpected. "Why am I not surprised? You know how early our train leaves in the morning."
It was clear just from looking at Sherlock how difficult it was for him to made that admission. John knew how proud Sherlock was of his analytical mind. The fact that he couldn't recognise any patterns was akin to defeat for him. Which was complete nonsense, of course. But Sherlock was not only proud, he was also terribly stubborn. Both character traits which prevented him from accepting any comforting words from John. And yet it made John happy to be privy to this part of Sherlock's life – even if the reason for it was horrible. With that knowledge, he settled for giving Sherlock's thigh an encouraging pat.
Something buried deep down stirred inside him. Something dark that was just waiting to be released from its lead. The feeling both shocked and titillated him. But Ryan seemed to be speaking to whatever it was directly, as if he'd been waiting for it. Even just the way he looked at Victor, the way he leaned into him slightly, as if he were going to pounce any second – like a predator.
A small smile tugged at the corners of John's mouth as he watched Sherlock go down the hall. Maybe things would work out if the two of them just tried hard enough.
"No idea whether it's true, but I heard that Sherlock already had the project finished in the second week. After that, he was just using the lab for other experiments. Tom kept thinking he was going to get the results from Sherlock. You can imagine the look on his face when he found out Sherlock had turned his papers in to the prof a long time ago. Do you think he did it on purpose?" Abigail asked and picked up the next cupcake, turning it in her hand as she examined it.
John looked around the imposing entry hall, his curiosity piqued, and inhaled deeply. The house's smell was off-putting. The combination of so many omega scents plus that of the house's master blended to form a disharmonious mish-mosh. John rubbed his nose irritably. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw that Sherlock was also grimacing and appeared somewhat disorientated. He wondered how the residents could stand such a potpourri; the chaotic stench was doing weird things to his head after just a few seconds. Maybe one grew accustomed to it after a while.
"Sherlock..." Mycroft's tense gaze was burning on his neck, but Sherlock ignored it. He remembered all too vividly how stricken Mycroft had been by that overdose; how he'd sat at Sherlock's bedside day and night and spoken encouraging words to him. Even though that didn't mean the incident in the flop house had been forgotten, this wasn't the right moment to work through their past together.
"They have a couple of errands to run. For the christening. A meeting with the vicar and a couple of things to pick up. They should be back this afternoon." Bill speared a chunk of egg with her fork, popped it into her mouth, and took a bite of her toast.
"It was no accident..." Sherlock objected. "I was never able to prove it, but I'm absolutely certain that she was murdered. She was in the way... she wanted to protect me..."
Sherlock stopped in front of his room and whirled around. He gave John an imperious look, unable to completely conceal the hurt in his expression.
Straps around John's torso and hips held his arms pressed firmly against his sides. Sherlock registered with a sense of horror that there was a clear tube wrapped around John's right arm with a cannula on the end which was stuck into the crook of his arm and carefully held in place with tape. The bag of saline solution which it led to hung from an IV stand next to the coffin.
Donovan had also been sent away by the forensics technicians. She sat in the car, scrolling through various databanks on her laptop in order to try and identify the four omegas. The techs had only been able to confirm that all of the omegas that had been found were bonded, but not all of them had identification on them. One of the women had given them a fake ID, which had been confiscated. Charges would be filed against her in the next few days.
Sherlock's face was no more than a flat mask. Cold crept through his veins, clawed its way into his guts, and stole the breath from his lungs. He felt as if he were splintering into tiny pieces and falling apart; he had to look away in order not to allow any insights into what was going on inside him.
John arrived at the hospital before his parents and rushed to the front desk at A&E. Sherlock hung back in the visitors' area to await John's parents and give John the privacy he needed with his sister.
"You always are..." she replied with a vaguely doleful note. She apparently still held it against him that he hadn't returned to her and Mycroft's care after his hospital stay, choosing instead to live free of the social strictures of a bond – at least for a couple of months.
, Sherlock silently pleaded when he saw John's hand hesitate in mid-air. He whined pitifully when he felt the muscles in his lower abdomen contract again and squeeze out more omega essence a moment later. He turned bright red, well aware that every inch of his body was on display right there in front of John. Sherlock tried as hard as he could to push his fingers further inside to stop up the flow, but it was no use.
Sherlock struggled to suppress a helpless sob as he approached his climax. Images from his first heat flooded his mind, making him thrust into his own fist with lustful abandon. His breathing was shaky and the fear of being discovered drove him to rub his wet cockhead and sensitive frenulum even faster. He clenched his jaw until it hurt in order not to let any sounds escape his lips. When he finally came all over his hand and the inside of his pants, he collapsed against the wall, exhausted.
"I'm quite satisfied with the results," Sherlock said smugly. "Now that I know how to activate your knot, we can do that more often. Of course, we can't do it just anywhere and anytime, but as long as we're alone here..." Sherlock smiled mischievously. Would John still want to take his trip, knowing that they could have such fantastic sex here? Would he still want to see Cilia?
John was quivering with rage when he read the details. He remembered quite well finding Sherlock the morning after. Apathetic and barely coherent, his head cushioned on John's grey jumper, unwilling to speak about the events of the previous night. The broken cylinders and Petri dishes in the kitchen, shards of glass everywhere. It all made sense now.
John discarded his clothing as he hurried up the stairs. He stumbled when he tried to take off his trousers and shoes at the same time, then heard the
John let out a bit-off groan and inhaled sharply between his teeth. He wiped his wet mouth with his free hand, then promptly licked the moisture off the back of the same hand. He leaned his head back to seek out eye contact with Sherlock, giving him a rapacious look.
Sherlock bit down on his lip so hard that he flinched. His mind was racing. Of course he knew he couldn't –
"I don't know. In any case, he was very quick to pick up that piece of glass and knew how to use it. He didn't just randomly stab at that woman; he went straight for her neck."
When John turned onto Baker Street, he could already make out the figure sitting on the steps of 221B from a distance. Victor stood and lifted a hand in greeting. He had the sunglasses with blue lenses that they'd bought in Camden perched on his nose, and was wearing tight, dark blue jeans and a white shirt, open at the collar and hanging loosely over his trousers. He pushed his blond hair back out of his face with the sunglasses, and John saw the dark circles under his eyes. John must not be the only one losing sleep at night. The only thing was, he didn't know whether Victor was grieving or already out partying again.
John spread the pulsating ring of muscle with both thumbs, ran around the rim, and finally inserted the tip of one digit. The subsequent wail that came from Sherlock shot straight to John's heart. It almost sounded like a cry of pain, but he knew better.
John's hands held him up, supporting him even as they drew him closer and embraced him. Hot lips seared down on Sherlock's shoulder and nape. "Sherlock..."
John wasn't back by the next day, nor the day after that. Sherlock was on the verge of ringing him to make sure he was all right, but he managed to restrain himself. Even if he was practically being devoured from inside for want of his alpha's presence. If John had been in danger, he was sure he would have felt it.
"I'm not hungry," Sherlock mumbled, but he was interrupted by a disapproving tongue click. Well, at least the food here was a step above MI6, although Sherlock couldn't fathom getting so much as a single bite down. The mere thought that John and Victor would shortly be just a few scant metres away from him made his entire body buzz with excitement.
"See, that's how it's done, 'Three Continents'." Her voice was dripping with sarcasm, and once again John was reminded how little he liked the woman. "Bill said your omega's playing hard to get, and we thought it's about time for you to get some. That can't be healthy."
"That's horrible!" John whispered, aghast, dropping random kisses on Sherlock's head, hair, and forehead. "No wonder Jean-Baptiste didn't shed many tears over him. Although I'm still not convinced he actually had anything to do with the murder. That just seems too far-fetched."
He watched as John filled the kettle with water and turned it on, took teacups out of the tidied cupboard, and dropped teabags into the porcelain teapot.
"You are the absolute best!" Abigail squealed gleefully and dragged Sherlock after her by the wrist.
For several long seconds, Mycroft simply gave John a calculating look; John fancied he caught sight of the internal dispute on his face, which was unable to conjure up its usual icy facade again. This might have been the first and only honest conversation he'd ever had with Mycroft Holmes, John considered, biting down on the inside of his cheek as he waited expectantly for it to continue.
Sherlock fluffed up the pillow and turned down the covers, then went into the kitchen and took some dishes out of the cupboard. He saw that John had made a cup of tea for him which had cooled enough to drink by now.
John puts his hands on Sherlock's shoulders, stroking his cheek, his neck, weaving his fingers into the dark brown curls. When he feels Sherlock's shaky gasps in between kisses, he opens his eyes.
Victor nodded to indicate that he was aware of that. He placed one hand on John's shoulder and gave him a piercing look. "Can you wait here? I'll just have a quick word with him, and then... we can leave."
Victor's and Mrs Holmes's eyes met over the coffee table; searching; calculating. Without looking away, Victor continued:
"I like this..." John said in a low voice, his eyes closed as he deposited a kiss on Sherlock's neck. "How long...?"
They walked together across the school yard to a two-storey building with a flat roof. Inside, they were greeted by the usual smells of rubber and the potpourri of human effluvia.
The anger returned in a flash, making John whirl around. He was beside Sherlock in three strides, placing two fingers under his chin and lifting it so that he had to meet his eye.
"No problem. It would be a good idea to have them sent to me though. We'll draw some blood today as well for comparison."
"What the hell, Sherlock?! You can't simply invite some strange alpha into the flat when we're – " Nervous energy seemed to be coursing through John as he took an authoritative step in Sherlock's direction and forced him up against the nearest wall. His hands pushed through the opening of Sherlock's dressing gown, yanked it open, and wrapped around Sherlock's bare torso to pull the omega into a bone-crunching embrace. John pressed his nose into Sherlock's neck right over the scar and noisily inhaled Sherlock's scent.
On their way there, the two men wove their way through the people, stopping here and there to check out the displays, all the while chatting about all of the colourful wares that crossed their path.
He closed his eyes for a moment, focusing on his rapid heartbeat and the rush of blood in his head. When he opened his eyes again, he honed in on the phone in Moriarty's hand to catch a glimpse of Sherlock. But Moriarty barely stood still for longer than the blink of an eye, making it impossible for John to see the screen.
"No other alpha..." John whispered gruffly, leaning down so close to Sherlock that their faces were barely a couple of centimetres apart, "is going to touch you during your heat. Or look at you. Or smell that irresistible scent. No other alpha is going to know how incredible you taste. Like nectar. Like ambrosia." Each statement was punctuated by a slow, deep thrust that drove every last breath of air out of Sherlock's lungs, making him grunt softly each time. "You belong to me. No one else!"
John shrugged bashfully and scribbled his name on several papers on auto-pilot. "That's what friends are for."
"Please!" John cut in. "This way Sherlock will know right away how serious the situation is, given that you kept me in the dark for so long that he's alive! He'll know that I'm not in danger and that I'm fine."
Sherlock took a deep breath just outside the door to the study, then entered the room and immediately looked for John. He was still sitting in the same position on the couch: his shoulders a rigid line, the muscles in his thighs ready to jump up, and the tendons in his neck stretched taut.
Sherlock awoke in John's arms several hours later. Sunlight fell through the curtains, creeping up their bare legs minute by minute. The bedcover had slipped off to one side, plunging fearlessly over the edge of the bed and preserved from disaster only by Sherlock's hip and an arm flung carelessly outward.
"Right." John smiled as he got up, then leaned across the table to give Sherlock a kiss. "Sorry, I've got to get going," he said and went to the bathroom to clean his teeth.
Sherlock stepped away from him as one of the police officers placed handcuffs around his wrists. He looked around. Lestrade strode over.
He soon felt the glide become smoother, and John was able to move more easily. Perspiration beaded on his forehead and trickled down his temples as he finally managed to seat himself fully inside Sherlock. He let out a sound that was more growl than moan, and leaned down to unite their mouths in a heated kiss.
His shoulder still ached from time to time, but that was fine. The pain reminded him that he wasn't alone; that his alpha was alive and that he himself had narrowly escaped death once more. He'd learned how to deal with the emotions he received from John; how to master his life despite and especially
They drove back to Victor's dorm together, loaded the boxes and bags into the car, and set out for Abigail's. Fortunately, there wasn't too much baggage, so one trip was enough.
The short black hair, the nearly black eyes, the pale face... the similarity to James Moriarty was striking – if the latter had been ten years younger. And not dead. The longer John studied the man in his grip, the more dissimilarities he discovered. Not least of which were the various tattoos covering his bare arms.
As usual, Mycroft was wearing a bespoke three-piece suit with a silk tie and pocket square. The golden fob of his pocket watch flashed between the folds of the anthracite grey fabric.
John looked around the elegant room, his curiosity piqued. Two cognac-coloured armchairs stood facing each other in the middle of the floor. Neither was occupied. Instead, Mycroft Holmes sat enthroned behind a massive desk, with a painting of her majesty when she was younger hanging over his shoulder. John didn't let himself be intimidated by Mycroft's position, which was clearly intended to communicate a certain hierarchical order, and approached the desk. He spread both arms in invitation, his palms facing up, and tilted his head to one side.
John didn't waste any time licking Sherlock's pulsating ring of muscles, his testicles, and finally his cock, sucking the entire slender erection into his mouth.
Mary seemed to feel the same, as she kept trying to get close to John and apparently very much enjoyed the time they spent together. At the same time, she didn't treat him with the extreme respect that society might have demanded given his rank and alpha status, nor did she seem to be gasping for his alpha cock in order to fulfil some long-held fantasy like many of the other beta servicemen and -women who vied for John's interest. No, she approached John with a dose of guts and sarcasm, along with a charismatic charm.
The evening was a complete success compared to the previous night. The food was excellent, the red wine light and sweet, and the conversation pleasant. Even Sherlock participated in the small talk, as John was happy to note.
"What happened?" John asked so softly it was barely audible – as if he were trying not to open any old wounds with careless words.
Feeling the strain in his body, Sherlock exhaled the air from his lungs and closed his eyes for a moment. His exhaustion was bone-deep, and demanded ever more of his fragile attention. The pain was returning, slowly but surely: it had found itself a cosy spot in his body, and was only being held in check by the morphine.
"Wait!" John held Sherlock back by the arm before he started up the steps to the door. "Are you nervous?"
Mycroft huffed disapprovingly. "And so you leapt to your death in order to protect John Watson. How touching. Unfortunately, you didn't consider the consequences in the heat of the battle. If we hadn't had an agent stationed under the bridge, not only would James Moriarty most likely have drowned, but you as well. And how would I have explained that to Mummy?"
He could make out gloomy hallways through the glass pane in the door. It was dusk already, the sun was going down, and all of the children were long since at home. A few lamps on the brick walls flared to life, casting orange-tinged light onto the gravel between the buildings. John jerked in alarm when footsteps crunching behind him became louder against the background noise of the city.
Kissing his neck and clavicle, John strokes Sherlock's chest and side. He sits up, contemplating the outstretched body beneath him as his fingertips caress Sherlock's painfully hard erection. Sherlock gasps as a hand twists around it, rubbing it up and down, while the fingers of the other hand dig into his quivering hip. It doesn’t take long before Sherlock squirms and, with a groan, throws his head back and arches his back. Cum splashes over his stomach and under his chin.
Feeling on edge, he squeezed his hands into fists – an unconscious nervous habit – and glanced up at the smart house front in front of him. Even before he'd taken his finger off the golden bell on house number 59, the door was pulled open and he was drawn inside.
They eventually broke apart, and Sherlock slid down to sit beside Victor, rubbing his sore neck. Victor looked over at him, out of breath and his heart racing wildly, as he fumbled around with the flies of his trousers. He sighed in relief when his neglected erection was finally freed. Every fibre of his being was on fire with desire, buzzing and begging for deliverance.
"Are you on your way to visit your family?" Walters asked. He took a sip of his coffee and licked the milk froth from his lips with a swift flick of his tongue.
"Hold on." Victor jumped up again and went into the kitchen, digging around in various drawers only to slam them shut again just a little too hard. He casually tossed a small, black, soft-shelled case with a white cross printed on it in John's direction.
The two newcomers integrated themselves quickly into the group. It barely took three weeks before they had become regulars with those who got together after the sessions. John wasn't really interested. He didn't want to go out on weekdays, since he was still stuck working the early shifts at St. Bartholomew's Hospital and couldn't afford to show up anything less than well rested. After all, he wanted to resume his full schedule as soon as possible.
The image of John staring at the door, his fingers tracing the notches in the door frame, burned their way uninvited into Sherlock's mind. John, here in his old house, no more than thirty centimetres between them, as if they were fated to keep finding their way back to each other.
Sherlock didn't react, but Victor could see the frantic flickering of his eyes in the semi-darkness as they darted back and forth between the two men.
"Show me his corpse." The smug smile didn't disappear from Moriarty's lips. He knew he had the better cards in this game, if the British government wanted to get any information at all out of him.
John patted Sherlock's thigh indulgently and gave Moran a conspiratorial grin. Moran in turn regarded John with a watchful eye.
It took Sherlock several seconds to find a satisfactory rhythm, propped up on the heels of his hands. But as soon as he did, the twin stimulation was so overwhelming that he couldn't think straight anymore. He closed his eyes and focused on the incredible feeling which was building up in his lower abdomen, driving him to greater and greater heights of ecstasy.
It didn't take long before John felt the first muscle contraction with his tongue. Sherlock's moans had dissolved into disjointed babbling, and the omega's fingers were clenched around the headboard to steady himself.
John turned to his omega, seeking some assistance, but he had his back turned and was directing all of his attention toward his nephew.
"No," John rasped between Sherlock's fingers. "We're both to blame. We ran headlong into this bond without considering the consequences first. But we couldn't know that it wasn't just our bodies that would bond, but our souls as well."
But it wouldn't. John would never forget those eyes, where he'd lost himself in the scintillating sea of colours more than once. The intensity with which Sherlock had looked at him, making all doubts melt away regarding his ability to love. Their profound friendship. John had watched with a sense of gratification as Sherlock had slowly learned to understand and appreciate the value of that friendship. He'd felt a combination of pride and sadness at the same time. Pride because it was almost like teaching a child something wonderful. Sadness because the thought that Sherlock had had so few friends in his life was so unspeakably painful.
Sherlock noticed the small remote control device lying between his left hand and his hip. It had a black button with an arrow pointing upward, and a red button with an arrow pointing down. Morphine... Sherlock wasn't in any serious pain at the moment, however; there was just the heaviness like a lead weight pressing him down into the mattress. He reduced the dosage of the opiate and gave a heavy sigh.
"That's what I'd like to know too, but apparently it suffices to say that omegas do such things. We're probably too stupid to find the park." Sherlock brushed past John to get to the kitchen, grumbling the whole way.
"No, that's not it. I... never wanted any. A bond with a male omega would be... perfect, actually. But... we don't know anything about each other."
The air burnt his lungs and his heart was racing. He dug his fingers into his hair and crouched down to make himself small. The sensation of tugging on his follicles and the desperate grunts emerging from his throat didn't help.
There was a buzzing sound, and Sherlock pushed against the door to enter the building. He walked up to the fourth floor and waited. He almost thought they'd forgot about him on his way up, but then someone finally took pity and opened the door to the flat. A young woman with long brown hair and alert grey eyes stood in the doorway. She tugged at the cotton shift she'd just thrown on. One strap of her bra had slipped down her shoulder and rested in the crook of her elbow.
"I never would have thought Sherlock would be so good with kids," John said to redirect the conversation to another topic.
John twisted his mouth into a semblance of a smile and accepted the glass with a thank you. The whole atmosphere at the club was fairly overwhelming, and John realised without any real surprise that this milieu wasn't really what he needed on a day-to-day basis.
"Something's wrong with me, Mike. I've been having bouts of exhaustion for weeks now without any obvious reason..." Sherlock summarised briefly while Mike went over the results of the examination from the last doctor.
He stretched up to deposit a kiss on the mark on Sherlock's shoulder, and continued working on his back. John was pleased to hear the gulping sound that Sherlock made when John spread his buttocks and ran the sponge between them. He gently wiped away any remaining omega essence and semen from Sherlock's opening that he hadn't caught with his tongue. An insistent tightening curled through his groin at the memory of their previous lovemaking. He let one hand wander around to the front so he could clasp Sherlock's cock and balls, and gently massage them.
"Then... er... you should probably explain it better to Lestrade," John tries evasively. Glad to be able to put some distance between himself and his roommate, John gets up and goes into the living room while Sherlock fetches his cell phone. He sits down with his laptop and looks at several online newspapers, studying the headlines and obituaries in case something interesting for Sherlock pops up. He listens to Sherlock with one ear while he explains to Lestrade over the phone how the man on the banks of the Thames got killed and what an idiot his forensic is.
"Not at the moment, but I've set a meeting with her physician for this afternoon to take her statement. It would be helpful for them to see that we respect omegas, and are actively working with one. The whole thing will be monitored by a third-party observer, due to the investigation. Alphas aren't allowed in – not surprising given the circumstances."
He didn't want to put the thought into words; it was causing a wishful kind of tingling and tension in his groin that he couldn't use at the moment. Instead, images flashed in his mind's eye. Images of skin on skin, of long fingers gliding across his abdomen and hips.
Unsure, John stares at his roommate. His first impulse is to berate Sherlock and demand that he respect his privacy, but after all that has happened between them in the last few days, such a reaction seems hypocritical.
"Unbutton your shirt," Victor whispered, his voice dark with lust. Despite the trace of uncertainty in Sherlock's eyes, he did as he was told and started to release the small plastic buttons at his collar. His fingers trembled – and not from the cold, Victor was pleased to note. Once the shirt was open, Victor ran his free hand across the bare skin, caressing a hard nipple with his thumb, then over the angled collarbone and up Sherlock's neck to rub his quivering bottom lip. Sherlock's tongue darted out, moistening Victor's thumb, only to promptly disappear again as if it had done something naughty. The corners of Victor's mouth twitched in amusement.
When the green expanse in front of him blurred into a golden desert, John pressed the heels of his hands against his eyes and rested his elbows on his knees to drive away the images. Now that his vision was curtailed, he heard the whine of cruise missiles, the thunder of bombs, the shouts and cries around him. He smelled smoke and blood. And then he heard himself screaming, followed by an all-encompassing pain that made it impossible to breathe. He gasped and felt for his shoulder. He was surprised to find that it was dry, that he wasn't reaching into a mess of blood and bone shards.
"Did you... did you feel it when John was shot?" she probed cautiously, although her curiosity was evident.
"I've missed you," Sherlock rumbled back, rubbing his chin across the top of John's head and cuddling up to him. "You did all of that first thing this morning?"
No one would have noticed that Walters had slipped the folded-up note into his pocket with a casual gesture. No one but Sherlock. As intended.
"Oh... that's... I'm sorry." John pulled his lower lip in between his teeth pensively and chewed on it. He secretly wondered whether Mr and Mrs Holmes knew of the actual circumstances of their son's death, or whether the information had been withheld from them. He wasn't sure what the code of conduct of the British Secret Service proscribed in cases like that.
"Both deceased. Sherlock was very small when his father died. His mother apparently couldn't handle the loss and died of a broken heart not long afterwards. Sherlock grew up with a beta uncle until his brother – a strict alpha – became his guardian."
"I have a lot to catch up..." Sherlock replied, dipping back in again. He knew exactly how to create tension with his lips and tongue, how to make clever use of his teeth to drive John to the precipice of insanity. How much pressure he needed to exert on the sensitive bundle of nerves inside John in order to draw an involuntary sob from his throat. Almost despairing, on the cusp of begging for release.
"The case yesterday on the Thames. Anderson insisted it was a murder because of the head injury and scratch marks on the man's face, but of course he overlooked everything of importance. It was clearly a tragic accident. I would not have left that idiot off the hook so easily had it been a murder."
Mycroft's only comment on that remark was a twitch of his eyebrows. He leaned back in his chair and interlaced his fingers over his stomach.
John wrapped both arms around Sherlock and squeezed him so hard that Sherlock fancied he heard his bones grinding. "God… I want to undo everything that's happened. I want people to wake up and see what they've done. I want you to be able to walk down any street in this city without worrying that some random alpha's going to try to make you his…"
"There are still so many things I could do to you..." Victor whispered gruffly. He stuck his hand inside the waistband of Sherlock's jeans again, sliding his fingers into the cleft between Sherlock's arse cheeks. He carefully fingered the crinkled skin of Sherlock's hole with damp fingertips, lingering there and tracing lazy circles, titillating the nerve endings. Sherlock gasped softly and, on autopilot, started moving back and forth between the two hands stimulating him, or as much as his position allowed.
When Sherlock woke the next morning, he was sure that John must have already left for the clinic a while ago. He was therefore quite astonished to find him sitting in the kitchen.
John slept through until early the next afternoon, not waking until a loud crash followed by an abbreviated curse came from the floor beneath him.
Sherlock shrugged. "What for, it all ended well," he said, examining John's tense expression. The way his lips were pressed together and his eyes reflecting a mixture of worry and annoyance indicated that further opposition was in the offing. Sherlock prepared himself for the argument that was sure to ensue while stirring milk and sugar into his cup with outward calm.
I took a couple of steps back, giggling, and watched as she grabbed Sherlock's arm, draped it over her shoulder, and tried to heave his limp body onto its feet. The sight was simply too amusing! Although his emaciated form couldn't have been very heavy, she couldn't manage it even after several attempts.
"Maybe it's Moriarty's network? Moriarty also used the fairy tale pattern in his messages after all. But... but what do they want now with me?" John asked, thinking out loud as he looked down at where he was wringing his hands.
"Here!" Sherlock shouted, drew his arm back, and hurled something down at him like a spear-thrower. "Don't forget this. After all, you're in such dire need of it!"
He pounded furiously into the willing omega, but his knot couldn't get past that final natural barrier this time.
"Don't. Stay here. Please." He gave Sherlock a look that was practically pleading. "I need you... right here. Like always."
John refrained from a sarcastic reply along the lines of an abduction in broad daylight not exactly being 'finding the time.' Instead, he watched as Mycroft placed his signature on a document with a flourish and slid the lid back on the fountain pen he'd used for it.
They met once or twice a month, depending how critical Sherlock's needs were. And through those contacts, a sort of friendship developed between them. Well, friendship might not have been the right word for it, but they spent quite a bit of time together whenever Sherlock wasn't involved in a case. It was obvious that Wiggins was interested in more than Sherlock's company, but Sherlock always brushed off his advances.
John smirked as he watched Cilia grab an obviously confused Sherlock by the hand and drag him inside. Meanwhile, he lifted the luggage out of the boot of the car with an amused Bill and followed her into the house.
Sherlock listened patiently to the report, signalling his comprehension with a nod at the end. "What's her name?"
Sherlock had gone for the less involved bond – even without the foreknowledge of some metaphysical connection between himself and his potential mate. Of course, he'd seen how much his mother had suffered during his father's illness, but he'd always attributed it to her feelings for him, and not to the bond itself.
At any rate, there was nothing to be done about the situation at the moment. Lord Moran would be occupied with the heat, no matter whether one of his omegas had murdered a bunch of people or not. All they could do was wait and hope that the investigation resumed as soon as possible.
With a mixture of curiosity and concern, John goes downstairs to the first floor. The living room and kitchen are empty, Sherlock's door is closed. He might be asleep although it would be strange at this hour of the day. Frowning, John puts the kettle on and goes to the bathroom to have a quick wash. Over the noise of the kettle, he hears Mrs Hudson's cheerful voice and the clicking of her heels on the stairs. As he comes out of the bathroom, he sees that she is holding a baking dish covered with aluminium foil, which she puts on the kitchen table. John goes to her, greets her warmly and asks about her visit to her sister.
There was no doubt. Sherlock would have recognised that shirt anywhere. He swallowed past the lump in his throat and forced his expression into one of cool detachment.
"I could have used you here," John said eventually, stuffing his hands into his trouser pockets. "None of those people can even begin to understand what all of this is doing to me. Yes, they're all nice and they're trying, but..." John shook his head in resignation, squeezing his hands into fists in his pockets. "No one knew him the way you did. Not even me. That's... fuck." John turned away and pinched the bridge of his nose. Anger, disappointment, and grief oozed from every one of his pores, making him tremble. He clenched his teeth together so hard that it hurt; tried desperately to shove his emotions away, out of reach, in order not to be so bloody vulnerable.
John sat up and leaned back against the headboard; sleep was out of the question at the moment anyway. "What do you mean?"
The brief impression disappeared in the blink of an eye, but before he could collect himself and continue on his way to his seat, a loud bang shattered the peace in the common room. Sherlock stopped abruptly and looked down, only to see his hand, which had been holding the tea a moment before, now empty and trembling; to see shattered porcelain and tea spilled all over the floor and down his trouser legs. To see blood blooming across his shoulder like silk watercolour paint spreading through smooth, stretched fabric.
John had the opportunity to get to know Cilia better over the two weeks following Christmas. He still wasn't comfortable with the idea of inseminating the omega, but she and Bill came across as such a fairy tale couple with only one thing standing in the way of their happy ending: a baby. Given that John wasn't able to fulfil his own dream of a loving alpha-omega relationship, and this couple saw him as a suitable donor, he wanted to help.
John leapt to his feet and went over to him, asking if he'd hurt himself. Victor replied in the negative and crouched down next to the box to right it. Together, they put the papers back inside.
Sherlock looked down at his hand in disgust and played with the idea of squeezing so hard that Wiggins would never so much as consider asking anyone for a favour like this again. But... then he wouldn't get his dose, and he'd need to feel John getting off with his new partner. On balance, how bad would a couple of minutes be of begrudging contact with a stupid beta who was too short-sighted to ask anything more of him?
John nodded his understanding, tightened his grip on his bag, and dashed up the stairs – even if everything in him was screaming not to leave his omega alone.
But that was only one side of what had happened. John had a guilty conscience. He hadn't wanted to hit Victor. Alcohol, anger, and disappointment were one thing, but injuring someone on purpose went against everything John believed in. Yes, he'd hurt people before, even killed them, but never when acting on the basis of a selfish emotion like anger, vengeance, or jealousy.
John shook his head again. A frown line had developed between his eyebrows. "But if I understand correctly, you just sniff your family member's neck and … what's supposed to happen?"
When Mycroft finally discovered the lifeless fawn, I snuck after him to get an eyeful of their interaction.
"Go get changed, I can take care of this," Sherlock declares with a stony face and brings the first plate in the living room. John nods weakly and, cursing under his breath, he hurries up the stairs to the second floor. He takes off his wet clothes, slips into sweatpants and a T-shirt, puts his towel around his neck before rushing back downstairs.
John scratched the back of his head, feeling a vague sense of embarrassment. He truly wasn't used to talking about his feelings and it took a huge amount of effort on his part. Not quite sure what else to do next, he picked up the book and opened it to a random page.
