Sherlock stretched and yawned, rolling over in his bed, eyes popping open when he got a noseful of John’s scent.  He realised he was still in John’s bed, tutting to himself for not knowing immediately because of the feel of John’s inferior sheets.  He inhaled, drawing John’s scent deep inside his lungs, feeling the love he had for the other man – Shit, where had
Thursday afternoon saw John slowly and carefully climbing the stairs to flat B, with Mrs Hudson fluttering nervously above with baby Alex in her arms as Sherlock hovered behind him.  John was determined to get up the stairs under his own steam, but as it turned out, he only made it about halfway up before he had to give in and accept help from Sherlock.  With his nose buried in the crook of Sherlock's neck, his arm around Sherlock's shoulders and Sherlock's strong arm around John's waist, the pair made it safely up the rest of the stairs to the sofa.  John honestly didn't think he had it in him to make it any further into the flat, not even into their bedroom, despite it being on the same floor as the sofa.
“Then let's get together at 12, when everyone goes for lunch?”
Sixteen-hundred hours: It was three days after he had stood by John Watson’s head in his room in the middle of the night and released his orgasm over the man’s chest.  In the small, cramped and windowless office he’d been given to use, Sherlock Holmes was frustrated.  He shoved the chair back from the desk, stretched out his long legs and steepled his hands beneath his chin, sighing.  He regarded the piles of paperwork in front of him, stacks of enlisted men’s and women’s files that he had sorted earlier in the afternoon.  He had removed the files of those who could not possibly have committed the thefts because they had been off base at the time, those who had been seen by at least two different people in another part of the camp at the time of at least one of the thefts, and the women, who were not able to get into the men’s quarters.   Sherlock had started with nearly four hundred files, which he had reduced to just six, and there he had hit a problem.  Sherlock could not stop thinking about Captain John H Watson, and that meant he could not think about the problem.
“Thanks,” said John with a fixed grin, “I’m glad they enjoyed it.”
Forty-five pounds later, John lugged the jute bag full of jars along the street behind Sherlock.  The jars were all recycled from other products; jam jars, curry paste jars and pickled onion jars were among the ones Sherlock had spotted, and he was certain that the ghosts of their previous contents would make their presence known in the taste of the current ones.  The jars themselves had yellowed paper stuck to them with handwritten descriptions of the contents, whoever had written them had tried to make the descriptions cute and appealing, but had missed the mark by quite some way.  They came off as having been over-thought, and as a result, both condescending and slightly desperate.
The reader was giving John some trouble; he wasn’t blatantly defiant, but instead did what he was required to do with the absolute minimum of effort, and a terminally bored expression on his pale face.  What was worse, though, was that he seemed to have an inexhaustible supply of energy; where the other lads had dropped to the ground panting after their 20 laps round the parade ground, the reader had lounged lazily against the wall in the shade, waiting for the next instruction with a smirk on his rosebud lips.  John suspected the tried and tested methods employed by the boot-camp were not going to work well here; they were based on knocking down dodgy foundations of low self-esteem and lack of self-respect, then building each young man up into a stronger person, with skills he could be proud of, and a determination to do something good.  Unfortunately, the reader seemed to have enough self-esteem and self-confidence for the entire group, and John suspected he would not respond well to anyone trying to break that down and rebuild it.  Most of these lads had gotten in trouble, John knew, because they felt like they didn’t belong; getting into trouble gave them a gang of fellow troublemakers that to all intents and purposes became their family.  An incredibly dysfunctional family, one that was about as bad for them and their future as it was possible to be, but a feeling of family nevertheless.  The reader didn’t seem the type to need a sense of belonging, and John resolved to learn a bit more about him.
The place was an absolute tip, boxes of stuff everywhere, piles of papers, odd objets d'art - none of it mine - but it felt like home in a way the bedsit never ever had, and I'd been living there for four months.  The icing on the cake though was when he dragged me out on a case - the serial suicides that were all over the papers because of that MP - and cured me of a psychosomatic limp.  To go from hobbling around like an old man to chasing criminals all around London in the space of a couple of hours was incredible, and I was hooked on Sherlock Holmes from that moment on.
This time the man condescended to look at him.  “Which was it – Afghanistan or Iraq?”  John was struck with a wave of confusion; he was certain he hadn’t mentioned his military service to this man, yet he seemed to be carrying on a conversation John didn’t remember being part of.  How else would he know about the army?  Unless… Yes, Mike must have mentioned it, perhaps a text when John had popped into the loo on the way up to the lab?  John glanced over at Mike, and his grin seemed to confirm John’s suspicions.
The writing was extremely child-like – it had been written by a dog with a pen in her mouth, John thought, of course it was – and simultaneously, it was genius.  The handwriting (mouthwriting?) was messy, and the pen had run a little where Jilly had taken the paper in her mouth, but overall it was fairly legible.
John started to pant again, and buried his nose in one of Sherlock’s old scarves; luckily Mycroft had had one in his office from one of Sherlock’s visits, and had been able to grab it and bring it with him to the hospital.  Not nearly a substitute for the man himself, nonetheless John had been able to get some comfort from it, and it had helped a little with the dilation.  Still, he wished Sherlock would hurry up and get there soon.
After about ten minutes of this, John had tried every one of the samples, each of them tasting worse than the one before.  He was starting to feel decidedly ill, and his appetite had gone.  With a final triumphant grin, Sherlock turned to John and asked, “Are you going to buy some to take home?”  John grinned weakly and said, “yes…”
before, had not only fucked, but also
Twenty minutes later, and John was leaving the flat.  He started to walk to the Tube station, glancing at the reflections in the windows of the buildings he passed as he walked.  A few minutes later, he saw what he was looking for – Sherlock, skulking along behind him, trying his best to be unobtrusive but so anxious to stay with John that he was not doing a good job.  John smiled a little to himself; it was typical of Sherlock to try to manipulate the situation to his own ends.  John was so caught up in surreptitiously watching Sherlock that he almost missed what was happening right in front of him.  There was a short scuffle and suddenly a woman was shouting “stop him, he’s got my handbag!”
“I wasn’t, he was kissing me!” John replied, blushing.
“Oh for God’s sake!” he burst out, but the word kept swirling around and around in his head.  In the space between one second and the next, something fell into place.  Sherlock grabbed for the statements given by the six men whose files he had examined earlier in the day, scanning rapidly for the times they had last been seen before the thefts, and the times they were next seen after them.  None of the men had been out of the camp between the discovery of the thefts and the search of their lockers.  He was able to rule out five of the remaining seven, as the amount of time between those two sightings was not nearly enough time for them to have left the camp and disposed of the stolen items.  That left two, Westbury and Anderson.  In theory, there was enough time for either one of them to have left the camp and made it into town… but it would depend on a couple of factors, and Sherlock did not have that information yet.  He laid the files down on the desk, and left the office to have a hot shower, before heading to John’s office.
Sherlock took another step towards him, and John scooted round the desk, placing it between the two men.  “Look, just go, I’ll see what I can do to get you access to the files, okay, but we are not doing this.  It’s not right!”  He saw the momentary hurt in Sherlock’s eyes, before the emotional barriers came down again, and he turned and left the room without another word.  John sank into his chair and laid his head in his hands.  What the hell was he going to do? He couldn’t deny it any more, he was definitely attracted to this clever young man, and it seemed as if the attraction was mutual, but there were rules about this sort of thing! It was difficult enough trying to have a relationship with one of the other enlisted men, someone who was on an equal footing with John, but one of these troubled young men in a program John was in command of?  It was unthinkable, and to say morally questionable was an understatement.
The small blonde midwife, Mary, held his hand and blotted his forehead with a dampened flannel.  The room was almost uncomfortably warm, kept that way on purpose for the newborn infants.  “Come on John, you’re doing really well, that’s it!”  She didn’t understand why John’s Alpha was sitting outside in an office when he should be in the birthing suite, helping his Omega bring their child into the world, but John had been insistent, as had the besuited man currently scribbling away on some old scraps of paper Mary had managed to scrounge up for him.
When Sherlock pushed open the door to the birthing suite, he was greeted by the sight of John asleep in a hospital bed and looking smaller and paler than he had ever seen him look before.  There was a small plastic bassinet on wheels nestled up against the side of the bed, which Sherlock ignored for the time being.  His hands flew up to his mouth, and tears welled in his eyes at the overwhelming guilt he felt for not helping his Omega in his time of need.  Sherlock took a step or two closer to the bed, torn between wanting to check to make sure John was okay, and feeling that he had let him down so badly that he shouldn’t be in the room at all.
… and that month was up the day after that bloody kids party.  Everything I’ve done since then… everything we’ve done together today, I did it because I wanted to do it… because I want you!”  At his words, Sherlock’s mouth dropped open, and John could see that he was having difficulty processing what John had said.
Twenty-hundred hours: John sat back in his chair, taking a sip of whisky, and reflecting on the day.  Sherlock had been like a different person, he had managed to refrain from insulting anyone, and while his attitude hadn’t exactly been helpful, the disdainful hostility had almost gone.  John knew he couldn’t ask for much more, and was just congratulating himself on how well his idea seemed to be working when his door slammed open and Sherlock himself walked in, causing John to splutter on his whisky.  “I need the enlisted men’s files,” he said, with no preamble.
“Sorry, what was that?”
“Hey mate,” he said, adopting an Essex accent in the hopes of blending in, “I was chattin’ with some of the lads about gettin’ a car, and they said Anderson was the man to talk to, that right?”  The head waggled from side to side, then emerged from the depths of the engine.
John snapped the gloves on, trying and failing to be unobtrusive about it, proof being the sharp hiss of indrawn breath coming from Sherlock.  “I’m just going to take your blood pressure, I’ll need you to slip  your shirt off so I can put this cuff around your bicep, if that’s okay?” he said, moving quietly and confidently.  Sherlock unbuttoned the shirt, revealing his pale skin beneath.  John wondered whether that blood test was still a good idea, but to check for anaemia instead of drugs; surely nobody had such perfect alabaster skin in these days of tanning beds and fake bake?  Sherlock’s breathing was still rapid, but otherwise he seemed relatively calm, sitting with eyes shut and allowing John to manipulate his arm to get the cuff on.  The cuff was quickly inflated and the pressure taken with no further problems.  John moved through the rest of the examination quietly, explaining at every stage what he was doing and why.  He began to notice that each time he touched Sherlock’s bare skin with his gloved hands, Sherlock reacted.  “Sherlock,” he began, “are you okay with the medical procedures I’m doing?  I’ve noticed you seem a little… anxious… when I touch you?”  Sherlock seemed to take a moment to compose himself, then answered “I’m fine, Doctor, please… Carry on.”
Sherlock gets to meet his son.
“Carry on,” he said softly. Sherlock was mortified, he thought he might die of shame, but he couldn’t deny he was extremely aroused at the thought of the captain watching him.  He ducked his head, not sure what to do, when John spoke again.
“I’ll see you in my office at eight o’clock, to see how you’re getting on, okay?” he said gently, waiting for Sherlock’s nod of acquiescence before placing the file on the desk and leaving the room, closing the door quietly behind him.  Sherlock tried to catch his breath and put himself back in order, and a couple of minutes later was sitting back at his desk, going over the files again.  His mind began to drift as he looked at the names in front of him; Pugh, Davies, Westbury, Blake, Smith, Minchin and the new one, Anderson.  He tried to concentrate, but his mind kept drifting back, he kept hearing John saying, “faster.”  Sherlock shook his head, frustrated.
“Nah mate, we have a couple of these on the base, so it gives the newbies a bit of practice.  The bosses are fine with it, providing I pay for my spare parts, which suits me as it’s always the labour costs that kill you…  You can get a bargain on Ebay these days!”
Sherlock didn’t understand quite what had happened; he had brought John along to act as bait, and to be fair to him, that was exactly what John had done.  He’d kept an eye out, both on John and the crowd, and suddenly John was kissing another man and Sherlock had seen red.  Before he knew what he was doing, he was standing next to that ridiculous man and saving John from his clutches – protecting what was Sherlock’s. It suddenly hit him quite how important John was to him, and now he didn’t know what he should do next.  He went for his default position of fury and sarcasm.
“One chance to change your mind, Holmes,” he said softly, “just say the word and I’ll let you up, we’ll say no more about it.”  He softened his grip on Sherlock’s arms, giving him the opportunity to pull them from John’s grip, and pulled his hips back from Sherlock, who said something John didn’t catch.
Harry.
“I think we need to try this out, Sherlock, what do you say?” John looked over at Sherlock, who had been watching him intently.  Sherlock stood, the bath towel falling off his back once more.  “Why are you wearing a towel, Sherlock?  Is it because you’re naked?”
They left the shop after thanking Rob profusely for his time – “no, Sherlock, it was my pleasure, really, and your money’s no good here!” – and Sherlock magicked up another black cab.  They returned to the flat, where Sherlock changed into a pair of skinny jeans and a scarlet net t-shirt.  He fiddled with John’s hair, adding product to it and making it look like more of a youthful style; John knew there was no way he’d ever be able to reproduce it on his own.  When John looked again, he could see that Sherlock appeared to have pierced nipples – he didn’t remember seeing the piercings the last time he had patched Sherlock up, and that had only been a week or so ago.  It was obvious that they were fakes, somehow, but John couldn’t believe how realistic they looked, and he couldn’t stop himself from staring at them.
He took Sherlock’s had in his own, and steered him gently to the crossing, waiting patiently for the numbers that would count down to signify when the traffic would again have priority.
“Yes, well he’s the prime suspect right now.  I don’t think Westbury’s involved in this, but he’s certainly involved in something,” Sherlock steepled his fingers beneath his chin.
Sherlock turned back to John, his eyes brimming with tears.  “John, I… I know what you’ve been doing.”  John’s brow crinkled, he couldn’t think of anything Sherlock might possibly be referring to.  “I know about saying yes, John, and I know that’s the only reason you kissed me…” His eyes dropped from John’s and closed; the sparkling tear that had been threatening to fall dropped over the bottom lid, sliding slowly down his cheek.  John couldn’t help himself, he laughed, pulling Sherlock close to his body and wrapping his arms and legs around Sherlock’s body.
“John,” the man in question replied, shaking the proffered hand.  “So you like a military man, eh?”
Speak of the devil and he's sure to appear… and bring his violin along with him… Please, kill me now…
Sherlock spun around, his cheeks flushed red.  His stroking stopped as his jaw dropped open and he spluttered wordlessly.  John stood just inside the door, hands clasped behind his back, feet apart, spine straight.  He regarded Sherlock deliberately, his eyes sweeping slowly from their grip on Sherlock’s own, down over his chest, past his stomach to the achingly hard cock still gripped in his hand.  John walked slowly over and gripped Sherlock’s bicep under the short sleeve of his olive green t-shirt.  John sauntered past, eyes on Sherlock’s own, releasing his grip to drag his fingernails across Sherlock’s erect nipples, making him shiver with arousal.  He caught Sherlock’s other bicep in his grip and turned the younger man round so he was facing the chair.  John sat down, hips canted forwards and legs spread wide, his eyes never leaving Sherlock’s.
“Great, I need a magician for the girls’ birthday party, can you do kid’s magic?”
Sherlock ran his fingers gently over John’s bonding gland, feeling the almost imperceptible dents there.  “You
John’s mouth dropped, and he started to giggle.  Mrs Hudson looked over at him, a questioning look on her face.  “I’m just thinking about how Sherlock would look if he could see Jilly right now!”
The first time John Watson came home to hear the very enthusiastic slurping noises coming from the bedroom he had lately been sharing with Sherlock Holmes, he was convinced that his worst fear had come true.  He trudged dejectedly upstairs to what was still his bedroom – even if he hadn’t spent very much time there lately – and threw himself down on his bed, determinedly not crying as he heard the sounds of the love of his life participating in a very sloppy sounding blowjob.  Sherlock had recently discovered his sexuality and, apparently, also realised his Adonis-like form could win him so much more than a short, injured, former Army doctor with PTSD.
“John? Are you okay?” she asked in a concerned voice, putting her arm around his shoulders.  “Do you want me to call an ambulance?”  John sucked in a deep breath, his eyes watering, and shook his head.
“Work, Sherlock, where do you think?  I’ve been out for three days, Sarah texted me while you were in your mind palace.  Jason’s gone home ill so they’re short this afternoon and need my help.”  Sherlock leapt out of his seat, gripping John’s wrist, a look of anguish on his face.
As usual, Sherlock had seemed to be able to read his mind, reassuring him that it was probably nothing more than the fact that John was sharing a flat with an unbonded Alpha that had had an unexpected effect on his cycle.  John wasn’t so sure, but couldn’t think of anything else it could be, so he tried to put it out of his mind.
“Check out the sister of the first victim, she said she was at her life drawing class until six, but she can’t have been.  There was a flood two streets over from the college, and classes were all cancelled first thing in the morning because the college had no water.  It was fixed later that afternoon, and the college sent out text messages to all the students, but she said she didn’t get the brother’s message because her phone battery was dead.  If that was the case, how did she know the class was back on?”
John and Sherlock meet again, but neither realise he already knows the man Mike introduces him to...
Sherlock!” John wailed, and ripping the toy out of John’s hand, Sherlock buried himself deeply inside John’s slick channel.  It was as though a veil had come down between Sherlock and the rest of the world; the only thought in his head was of the Omega underneath him.
Then Mycroft had called in one of the top-secret-clearance favours Sherlock owed him, and sent him off to Derbyshire for three days, and when Sherlock returned, all hell had broken loose.  Partially caused by the stress of being away from Sherlock for so long, John’s next heat had come on unexpectedly early again, and he was in the throes when Sherlock had returned.  Sherlock had run himself ragged trying to get the case solved as quickly as possible so he could return home to John.  Being run down, he had caught a cold whilst in the close quarters of the offices he’d been working from, and had come home bunged up and full of aches.  Consequently, his powers of observation had been a little off, and he had not noticed anything was amiss until he had made it up the stairs, unlocked the door to the flat and entered.  He had vaguely registered the small heap of food and water on the kitchen table, and John’s jumper discarded halfway up the stairs to his room before the urge to be where John was
Twelve-hundred hours: As John’s watch beeped noon, he gathered the group together, and sent them for lunch in the canteen hall, with strict instructions to be back in the large classroom next to the parade ground at 1 pm sharp.  He turned on his heel and marched over to the Officer’s mess, deciding to grab some lunch and then spend half an hour or so reading up on his charges.  It always helped to know a little something about them, it gave him a chance to build a relationship if there was a little common ground, and John was still young enough that he could usually find some.  Sandwich in hand, he reached for his keys to unlock the door to his office, and paused, surprised and angry to see the door was already ajar.  He swung the door open, stepping through, and found one of his charges sitting in his chair, feet up on the desk, reading one of the files from his securely locked filing cabinet.
Greg threw his head back and laughed.  “Is that what all this is about? For a genius, Sherlock, you really are an idiot! John needs YOU, he’s been on his own apart from the Beta midwives the whole time, Mycroft says he’s in a bad way… Sherlock, he needs his Alpha, you have to get up there!”
“That’s it, Sherlock, take it, suck that cock,” John panted, and he yanked his jeans and boxers down around his knees, rubbing his cock against the smooth skin of Sherlock’s back.  He thrust faster and faster, pushing Sherlock’s cock into his mouth; Sherlock was moaning almost continually, his hands fisted in the bedsheets by his sides.  A sudden tensing of his muscles, and Sherlock was coming inside his own mouth.
“Okay, so what do you suggest?”
“Alexander Sigerson,” Sherlock answered the unspoken question.
Sherlock found the Skyline.  It was near the front of the car park, sleek and shining, clearly loved by its owner.  Despite this, Sherlock could see signs of engine work that had not been completed quite right; a repair to the bodywork that had paint bubbling over the top, signifying rust coming through underneath.  For all Anderson’s reputation as a top mechanic, it was clear that he didn’t deserve it.
“That’s a big name for a little boy,” she cooed, bustling about the room.  “Let me know if you need anything, John, won’t you?”
Okay, this is getting creepy now, since that odd day in Hart's last week, I've been seeing the same bloke around everywhere.  I was on the bus into work on Tuesday and he was sitting across the aisle from me, then on Tuesday night he was sitting outside the clinic when I finished work.  I thought he was going to follow me home, so I went to the pub instead, and luckily I know the bar staff quite well, and Angie allowed me to creep out of the back when I pretended I was going to the loo.  Angie's under the impression that it's my animal magnetism again, but Sherlock just laughed when I told him… I said it worked quite well on him and he couldn't come up with anything to refute that, so I think I won that argument…
“Really?” he responded, in a tone of voice that sounded surprised.  “I thought it was a big improvement. Your mouth’s too… small now.”  John watched as the man dismissed the petite brunette, sipping from the mug and making a face.  John made a mental note that although many things might have changed at Bart’s, the coffee hadn’t.  The woman, Molly, was it? left the room, muttering to herself.
Sherlock sat down next to John and picked up the box, removing the lid.  He brought it up to his face, eyes closing as he breathed in the scent that arose from the box.  “I kept all of them, you know,” he said quietly.  John wasn’t sure what he was talking about, but stilled with his arm still under the bed, where it had been groping for the book.  “Oh?” he said, not knowing anything else to say.
Sherlock pushed John back down into his chair, agitation joining the other emotions John was feeling.  “Sherlock?  What is it?  What’s wrong?”  By now, Sherlock was on his knees between John’s thighs, one hand cradling his back, the other splayed across his stomach.
bonded, although I don’t know how it’s happened, considering how long it’s been since we bit each other.”  He turned the laptop towards Sherlock, who glanced over the page briefly, then resumed staring off into space again.  John began to feel a little discomfited, but wasn’t sure if he was feeling it or if Sherlock was.  Eventually he shut the laptop down, tucking it out of the way under his chair.  He got up, clearing his throat, and said, “I’m just off to have a shower and get ready, okay, Sherlock?”  At this, Sherlock’s head whipped round, and he glared at John.
“It wasn’t working for me,” she replied, nervously.
This particular afternoon, John had decided to take Sherlock into the newer part of the city, so they had ordered a taxi to take them into the heart of the city where they had spent a lazy morning wandering around looking into shop windows, nibbling on pastries and generally enjoying being away from the hustle and bustle of London.  John knew that Sherlock would only be able to enjoy himself for a few days before he would be itching to find something to do again.  As they crossed the green in front of the shopping centre, John seemed to start a little, as he realised where they were.  His mind drifted back six months previously, to the night he had found the box under Sherlock’s bed.  He remembered the smell of the flower petals drifting from under the lid, the way they had floated down over him when Sherlock had startled him and he had dropped them, and he remembered the promise he had made to Sherlock that night – a promise he had kept ever day since then.
John makes and then implements a decision, which causes Greg to worry about him.  Sherlock gets bored, so goes poking about in John's room, and makes a bit-not-good decision of his own...
Sherlock and I went out on a double date with Molly and her ex-boyfriend Simon last night - he wasn't an ex-boyfriend when the date started, but after Sherlock verbally eviscerated the poor bloke, he made a run for it, and Molly has since texted me to say it's all over.
Lestrade cuffed Anderson, and he and Donovan marched him away, arranging to come to get Sherlock’s statement in the morning, when he’d had a chance to recover a little.  John looked at Sherlock, who was still sitting on the floor like a floppy rag doll.  He smiled as John looked over at him.
Sherlock was grinning.  He knew he was grinning, and he couldn’t help it; he’d have to get a handle on it soon or even John might work out something was going on.  They were currently walking down a street in a sleepy little Home Counties town they’d been to on a case; it had been solved in the early hours of the morning, after which they had crashed in the shared room of the one bed and breakfast in town.  John had awoken around one in the afternoon to the sound of Sherlock’s gentle snoring.  He had managed to shower, dress and make himself a mug of instant coffee before Sherlock had risen like Sleeping Beauty, demanding coffee of his own.  It was now half past three, and John had driven Sherlock out in search of food.
“No Sherlock, please, let me finish… After it all went tits up with Mary, I came back here, back to you, and I had no idea how you felt… You do feel something for me, don’t you? I’m not imagining things, am I?”
At ten thirty that evening, John and Greg were the only ones from the team still left in the pub.  Everyone else had left one by one; after long days in court they were all ready to sleep for a week.
“It looked very much as though you were kissing him back,” Sherlock responded, finally bringing his eyes up to meet John’s.
“How about Alexander, after your father?”  John’s eyes misted up a little, and he nodded, not trusting himself to speak.
“OWWW!” he whispered, screwing his eyes shut, the motion having set off the bodybuilder with the cannon once more.  Another snuffle, this one in his eye-line, made him open his eyes once more in an attempt to see what was going on.  Sherlock was sitting on his haunches at the side of the sofa, snuffling in John’s hair.  He was completely naked, as far as John could see, although he was making a concerted effort not to look too closely.
“But this is important!  You must have someone halfway competent that can see me and sign a piece of paper!”  John could hear the voice almost as soon as he stepped out of his office, deep, rich and extremely impatient.  “I’m sorry Mr Holmes, you’ll need to book an appointment, like the rest of our patients have ALREADY DONE!”  Liz had been a receptionist at the surgery for 15 years, and the battle was likely to be an interesting one.  John made his way past the two junior receptionists, cowering out of sight in the back of the office; they smiled sheepishly but made no move to go to Liz’s assistance.  “It’s Mr Holmes,” said Tracey, as though that explained everything.  “He has to have a medical for the Met, and he thinks we’re all just sitting here doing nothing!”
It was obvious to John that this was a typical kind of event, as Mike just smiled and nodded to John, saying, “yeah, he’s always like that.”  John wondered what was going to happen the next day, and he hadn’t even decided if he was going to go and meet the man yet.
John had received the text from Greg, and found himself automatically responding in the negative before he remembered his new vow.  He deleted the message and started over, sending a simple acceptance, and checking where and when.  There was no time like the present to start changing his life.
Sherlock’s eyebrows nearly disappeared straight off the top of his head, and without another word, he disappeared into the bathroom and started alternating between scrubbing his teeth with triple the amount of toothpaste he needed, and gargling with mouthwash.  John thought it was entirely possible this was the best day he had ever had…
“You’ve talked to Westbury?” John asked.
“In all the cases I’ve dealt with, the name that cropped up most often as the perpetrator is David.  We are not naming our son after criminals, John.”  John laughed at the affronted look on Sherlock’s face.
John unzipped his trousers, pulling his rock hard cock from inside his red pants.  He uncapped the bottle, drizzling some lube onto his palm, and slicked himself up.  John lined his cock up with Sherlock’s hole, and slid straight inside in one smooth thrust.  “God Sherlock…” he hissed, gritting his teeth and stilling his hips to prevent himself coming immediately.  Sherlock wailed, trying to thrust against John’s unmoving weight.
“What the hell do you think you’re doing?!” Sherlock yelled, and Simon backed off immediately, throwing his hands up in the air in a conciliatory gesture.
“Baby Xander, then, and he’ll have you around all the time so he can scent you whenever he needs to… Sherlock, now the danger’s passed, the best place for John to be is back in his home, surrounded by his family, with his Alpha.  Come on mate, I’ll give you a lift to the hospital, you can see him for yourself.”  Greg picked up Xander’s changing bag and Sherlock’s coat, looking around for Xander’s car seat.  Sherlock smiled wanly, and turned to tuck Xander safely in his car seat.  He grabbed his keys and his mobile, and followed Greg down the stairs, heading off across London to see his love.
“William…” John said, in the voice he used when he was trying to persuade his mum it would be fine if he didn’t have a bath tonight, or that he could eat the rest of the sweets in the bag without being sick, or that it would be perfectly safe for him to camp out in the woods overnight by himself.  It rarely worked on his mum, but William hadn’t had as much experience at resisting it as she had.
As Sherlock approached the door of the boutique, it opened, and a young man with a large bushy beard and neatly trimmed blonde hair opened the door and embraced Sherlock, who stepped back quickly.
“Please…” gasped Sherlock into John’s mouth, although if he’d been asked, Sherlock wouldn’t have been able to say what he was asking permission for.  John started to pull away, thinking that Sherlock wanted to stop, but Sherlock followed his movement, nipping desperately at John’s lips with his own.  “John! Don’t stop, please don’t stop, touch me,” he begged, his voice ragged with desire.
“We don’t know a thing about each other; I don’t know where we’re meeting; I don’t even know your name.”
“What did you have in mind, Doctor?” Sherlock replied, and he could hear the effect the excitement and anticipation was having on his voice.
“Sherlock!” he giggled, taking Sherlock’s face in his hands and trying to lift it so he could kiss the Cupid’s bow lips.  Sherlock huffed impatiently, and pulled out of John’s grasp, tucking his nose under John’s jaw again.  John decided it was easier just to let Sherlock scent him; obviously it was some kind of Alpha thing, re-establishing the connection or something of that ilk.  At last, Sherlock appeared to be finished, and slowly pulled back, away from John.  His eyes were wide, and John started to get a confusing combination of emotions coming through from him – fear, awe and elation.  What the hell was happening?
“Sherlock, you said you’ve never had a prostate exam before, so I’m going to go slowly, it can feel a little invasive.”  Sherlock closed his eyes to enjoy the stimulation without distraction, and found his hips moving involuntarily, following the push and release of the doctor’s finger as he pressed Sherlock's anus.  “Okay, deep breath,” the doctor said, and slowly slid his finger through the ring of tight muscle.  The feeling was exquisite.  Sherlock had, on occasion, been with partners who were too excited to prepare him properly, and while pain could be pleasurable under certain circumstances, this was better.  He let out a low moan, and felt the finger retreat, then push forward, deeper.  Sherlock slipped his hand between his thighs, taking his hard shaft in a firm grip, and starting to stroke in the same rhythm as the doctor’s finger moving in and out of him.  Some distant part of him was aware of the doctor adjusting his trousers; Sherlock knew he was enjoying the examination as much as his patient, but for Sherlock the only things registering on a conscious level were the pleasurable sensations centred around his arse and his cock.
He wondered how long it would be until Sherlock took him to one side and explained that it was awkward sharing a flat with his ex-boyfriend now that he was in a new relationship, and didn’t John think it was time he found somewhere else to live?  After all, he had a steady job in a surgery not far from Baker Street, so he could easily afford to rent somewhere by himself, and since he would no longer be going out on cases with Sherlock either, he would be much more likely to actually keep this job…
John swallowed hard at the images this question brought up in his mind, then stepped forward, hooking one finger under the bottom edge of those tight trunks, and tugged.  “These will have to come off,” he said quietly.  Sherlock stood and quickly stripped off the trunks, giving John a good look at his cock for the first time.  It was a beautiful sight, long and thick, with a neatly trimmed nest of dark hair at its base.  John glanced over to check the window blinds were closed, and tried the door handle to make sure it was locked – it was standard procedure during this type of examination, to ensure the patient wasn’t embarrassed by anyone randomly walking in, but you couldn’t be too careful, he decided.  Sure enough, the door was locked, a reflex action he didn’t even remember performing.
“I told you before, those files are private!” John yelled, breathing hard with anger.  For a short man, he had a surprising strength, and Sherlock found himself very effectively immobilised, with John’s weight pushing him down, and one of John’s thighs pushed between his own, meaning John’s crotch was pushed firmly up against Sherlock’s arse.  John’s desk was a little lower than standard, meaning Sherlock’s head was pushed down lower than his hips, which had the effect of arching his back and pushing his hips out, straight into John’s cock.  Sherlock rolled his hips and moaned, and rubbed his trapped hand along the inside of John’s thigh, brushing over his balls.  With the effect that Sherlock’s moan had, it might as well have been directly wired to John’s cock, he went from flaccid to hard in seconds, and couldn’t prevent himself snapping his hips into Sherlock’s arse, feeling the friction along his shaft.
“Any idiot can diagnose them,” he sneered.  “Take the blonde in the corner.”  Sherlock indicated the young woman sitting awkwardly, leaning to one side on the arm of her chair.  “Her problem is obviously centred on her groin, judging by the way she’s leaning in her seat with nobody next to her to talk to, she’s clearly too uncomfortable to sit normally, and the fidgeting tells its own tale.  Could be haemorrhoids, but the constant fiddling with her engagement ring and pained expression says STD, and not caught from her fiancé.”  Sherlock’s voice was loud enough to carry through to the waiting room, and the young woman had caught every word; she shot out of the seat and rushed from the waiting room, blushing furiously and mumbling to the dragon that she would come back another time.  Sherlock turned his attention to the spotty young man who had been watching both him and the young woman who had left, although he had turned away from her every time she glanced in his direction.  It was obvious they knew each other from their behaviour, and the fact that he had started to blush as quickly as she had told Sherlock all he needed to know about the nature of their relationship.  “As for him,” Sherlock continued, “from the way they were making a point of not looking at each other, he’s obviously the source of the problem.” The young man’s blush deepened and he hurried after his friend, glaring Sherlock as he went.  Sherlock turned to the only other patient in the waiting room – an elderly gentleman with high blood pressure, coming in for his routine checks to enable his repeat prescription to be renewed – and was about to open his mouth when Dr John Watson stepped up to the desk and asked, “Is there a problem?”
– and that was when the panic hit him.
enjoy spending time with John, and putting up with the strange men with a big blue box was a small price to pay.  He was willing to admit that he didn’t mind too much watching the little Scottish man pretending not to be Scottish, and he and John had many discussions about why
Once the compulsion had died down, they had both collapsed in John’s bed, and slept for eight hours straight; even Sherlock, whose sleeping habits could never be called anything as pedestrian as a pattern.  John had slept better than he ever had in his life, not even a sniff of the nightmares that had plagued him on a regular basis, and even sharing a bed for the first time had felt right.  John had awoken first, feeling hungry and thirsty.  He had started to get used to the strange doubling feeling of his emotions, and as Sherlock was currently radiating more exhaustion than hunger, John had decided to leave him asleep in
I confess, my ex-husband is a David... snigger snigger.... I'm saying nothing about his criminal tendencies, however....
“Sherlock, are you okay with the medical procedures I’m doing?  I’ve noticed you seem a little… anxious… when I touch you?”  Dr Watson’s voice was full of that caring concern, but despite that, the tone of his voice shot straight to Sherlock’s cock.  He took a moment to compose himself, then answered “I’m fine, Doctor, please… Carry on.”  Dr Watson moved round in front of Sherlock to check the glands in his neck, and Sherlock made a point of spreading his legs, rather than tucking them to one side, in order to increase the intimacy of the situation.  He leaned back on his hands, calculating how far back he could go before it just became weird, instead of a little unusual.  He observed the slight rise in colour on Dr Watson’s cheeks, the slight hitch in his breathing.  He knew it was a fine line he was walking, and the excitement only served to arouse him even more.
“How do you feel about the violin?”  It took a moment for John to realise that tall dark and handsome was talking to him, it was Mike’s smug smile that clued him in.
Sherlock skidded into the café, dropping immediately to his knees and scanning his body looking for injuries.  “John?! What happened?! Who took you? How did you get away?” he blurted out, grabbing at John and trying to pull him up out of his seat and out of the café.
John will be spending the foreseeable future in the Quentin Clinic.  For those of you who don't know, that's a secure psychiatric clinic.
Rob scurried over with an armful of clothes.  He shoved a pair of trousers and a top into John’s arms, then spun him around and pushed him towards the changing room – not so much a room as a small cubicle with a baggy curtain sagging from a rope strung across the front.  John sighed and went inside, pulling the curtain across after him.  It was a little too small, and he spent a moment or two trying to get it to fit all the way across, before giving it up as a bad job and starting to undo his jeans.  Sherlock could see a glimpse each time John moved; the cubicle was too small for him to turn easily in, and there was a lot of movement in the curtain.  Fairly soon, John declared in a loud voice, “I’m not wearing this!”
“You may find it more comfortable to fold your arms on the couch and rest your head on them; this position can cause backache if held for too long, neither bent not upright.”  Sherlock bent at the waist, crossing his arms on the surface of the couch, and resting his head on them.  The position tipped his hips so that his back arched and his buttocks spread; Sherlock could feel the cool air on his hole and knew he was revealed entirely to the doctor’s gaze.  He rolled his hips, as though trying to get a more comfortable position, and as he had hoped, Dr Watson grabbed the lube and squeezed a generous portion onto his fingers.
John could see as it slid out that it was one of the boxes Sherlock’s ridiculously expensive handmade Italian leather shoes came in.  At least, that was John’s assumption, he didn’t speak Italian, so couldn’t know for sure what the writing on the box said.  The box was the right sort of size and shape though, and there was an address in Via Montenapoleone, Milano.  John had travelled enough of the world to know that Milan was in Italy, and so he felt it was almost certain the box was a shoebox.  He felt quite pleased with the deduction, until he realised that by Sherlock’s standards it was child’s play.
John held his breath while Sherlock appeared to think this over.  “Well if you think that’s best, Doctor”, he said, that velvety voice seeming to deepen and the icy blue eyes becoming heavy-lidded.  John let out his breath, and attempted to calm himself, glad that he’d worn the looser fitting chino trousers today, rather than the snug fitting black ones that were almost able to show a man’s religion, in the right circumstances.
“Oh, it’s no problem,” Rob replied easily, “anything for Sherlock… And I live right upstairs, I won’t be getting ready to go out for another hour or so myself, so I have the time.”  He stood back, and examined John critically up and down for a moment.  He stepped closer again, undoing John’s jacket and tugging it down off his shoulders, then pulling his jumper over his head to reveal his slim fitting t-shirt.
“What do you need, John?” Sherlock dropped to his knees in the doorway, hands fisted in his curls, desperate to look after his Omega, but with the rational part of his mind reminding him that John wasn’t
“What about Anderson, what’s he driving?” interrupted Sherlock.
*****
“Um… yes?” John replied, uncertainly.
“It looks like it’s in good nick, was it expensive?” Sherlock offered, tilting his head to one side.
This is a bit of a long shot, but has anyone out there seen Sherlock?  He's gone missing, and doesn't seem to have his phone with him, and he's been working quite a nasty case.  I've tried tracing his steps, but, well… I'd have to be Sherlock to be able to track Sherlock…
“I’ll ask my mum to talk to her,” John said confidently, “she’ll get your mum to send you to my school.  Or maybe I can come to your school instead?”  William didn’t think John’s mum would even get to talk to his, she was always so busy with her writing and her charity work, but it was a nice idea, so he smiled happily at John, and they carried on with the fruitless task.
“What the…? Mycroft?”  Greg did what would have been a comical double take, had it appeared in a television program, before settling his gaze back on Mycroft.
John nodded, chewing slowly.  They finished their meal in companionable silence, neither feeling the need to fill it with small talk.  When they were finished eating, they sat together, drinking tea that John had made using the kettle in the corner of his office.
Anderson had been steadily growing angrier as Sherlock spoke. Suddenly he rushed at Sherlock, taking him by surprise and knocking him over the table to the floor. His hands pressed into Sherlock’s throat and squeezed. Sherlock had the height advantage, but was lean, whereas Anderson’s rage gave him strength. Sherlock instantly began to go red as Anderson crushed his windpipe, cutting off his air.
He was in quite a bad way once he was found, being Sherlock he'd not eaten or drunk anything for a day or so - apparently it's bad for brainwork.  Worse for stranded detectives, I'd say, maybe he'll listen to me in future!  Luckily for Sherlock, there had been some interest in renting out the shop, and the estate agent responsible for it had popped down to check it over before he showed the potential renter around.
“I’ve already eaten, you just fed me
Sherlock sat up abruptly.  “I said, will you answer a question?  Truthfully?”
Sherlock finishes his investigation and works out who the guilty party is... John is a BAMF....
Sherlock’s voice deepened a little, cracking as he replied.  “Every time you visited my grave, you brought flowers.  Every week.  Two or three times a week, in the beginning.  Did you never wonder what happened to the ones you left?”
Oh, doorbell - I'll post this and come back to it later…
“It changes every week,” the bartender answered, while grabbing a couple of bottles of flavoured cider for the next customer.  “The DJ announces when the next night will be at the end of his set, it’s a bit of a ploy to get people to stay drinking later then they might have otherwise.”
“Well I think we should consider a prostate check,” Dr Watson replied hurriedly, “Obviously if there are any issues, the sooner we catch them the better.  And I’d like to check for hernias too, you seem to have quite a physical job, judging by what the Met wanted me to check!”  Sherlock took a few moments before he replied, watching as Dr Watson held his breath.  “Well if you think that’s best, Doctor”, he said, allowing his voice to deepen and his blue eyes to become heavy-lidded.  The effect was immediate; Dr Watson let out an explosive breath, and Sherlock noticed as he subtly adjusted his chinos when he turned to fetch the lubricating jelly from a cupboard.
“Oh fuck…” he groaned, as he saw the disarray of his pyjamas and realised he must have climaxed in the night.  He was perversely impressed with the spread of semen; he reasoned it must have been a huge orgasm to have covered him so completely, and he was both surprised it hadn’t woken him and a little disappointed that he didn’t remember whatever had triggered it.  He showered efficiently and dressed, heading to the lads’ dormitory at oh-six-hundred as usual.  As the door banged open, heads and feet began appearing from under their blankets; all except Sherlock, who was sound asleep for the first morning since arriving.  As John called his usual reminder to the occupants of the dormitory, Sherlock roused and sat up, but would not look John in the eye, instead flushing pink and gazing down at the floor.  John thought it a little strange, but not as strange as his own desire to see those pale eyes looking back at him….
“This… “gentleman”… needs to have a medical for his work, Dr Watson, and I’m just explaining to him that he needs to book an appointment,” replied the dragon, through gritted teeth.  Sherlock waited to see if Dr Watson would react in the way he thought he should.  “Are there any more patients waiting to be seen?” Dr Watson enquired.  “Not any more,” the dragon muttered.  “I have some time free, why don’t I see… Mr Holmes, was it?  Make life easier for everyone,” the doctor smiled.  “Well if you’re sure, Doctor?”  The dragon turned back to the Sherlock and it seemed Dr Watson had upset her by taking Sherlock’s side; Sherlock didn’t know why, since it was obvious to anyone with any wits that Sherlock was in the right.  “If you’d like to follow the Doctor…” she said, hanging on to civility by the tiniest thread.
Sherlock’s nights consisted of catching some sleep on the bed with Xander tucked up closely beside him (instead of in his brand new cot, as agreed with John), and walking blearily round the kitchen jiggling a crying baby while waiting for his bottle to warm.  No more staying up for days at a time until the early hours and then crashing into bed; instead, Sherlock was continuously exhausted.  Days followed a similar routine, with the added stress of a trip across London to the hospital so John could see baby Alex and scent Sherlock’s pheromones.  Mycroft had offered to put Sherlock up in a hotel close to the hospital, but he had refused, on the basis that there were too many experiments that needed his attention.  In actuality, Sherlock was feeling more unsettled than he had ever felt; having a small infant to look after and no mate to help was a difficult situation for him and being in his own flat gave Sherlock a little feeling of comfort.  Mycroft had smiled privately at this, suspecting that Sherlock would have very little time to do anything with his experiments except watch Mrs Hudson as she disposed of their remains, but had simply offered his brother any help that Sherlock thought he might need.
“Get him back here, please Greg, John’s in a bad way, he needs his Alpha!”
“Your job is to sit at the bar and look pretty, you’re the right type, especially in such a stereotypical outfit – although the crop top and hot pants would have been better, I really don’t know what your objection was to them, John.  With any luck he’ll come and find you, and we can take him down before anyone else gets hurt.”
John made his way over to the Officer’s Club, there was a chance that Henderson might still be up.  Henderson was his opposite number, looking after the other group, and as luck would have it, he was just leaving as John arrived.  After a quick chat in the corridor, Henderson agreed to allow Sherlock to see what he could come up with, promising to speak to Lestrade and Donovan, the two MPs that had been investigating the thefts.  “Great,” thought John, “ all I have to do now is persuade Sherlock!”
John shoved his arm as far under Sherlock’s bed as he could, searching for the book he had been told was under there.  He stretched out his arm, fingertips grasping, and bumped up against a shoebox.  Curious, he tucked his fingers under the lid, arm stretched out to its limit, and for a moment thought he had only succeeded in pushing it further under.  Suddenly one of his nails caught, and he felt the box slide a little way towards him.
“I said I just don’t want to be away from you… Can I at least walk with you to work? And walk you home again after work?”  John laughed, shaking his head.
John chuckled.  "Nothing's wrong, Sherlock, Alex needs a bottle, that's all."  Sherlock rubbed his hand gently over Xander's head, and climbed up off of his knees, heading into the kitchen.  He efficiently made up a bottle, and set it in a pan of water on the hob to warm up.  John watched him, a warm feeling suffusing his body, as he saw how capable his flighty Alpha had become.  While the bottle warmed, Sherlock made a cup of tea and a plate of toast for John.  He set them all on a tray and brought them through; taking baby Xander from John and handing him the toast.  John and Alex both settled down to eat the food provided to them by their Alpha, John watching Sherlock as he fed and burped Alex.
“I don’t have a medical degree, and it’s Sherlock, Mr Holmes is my brother,” Sherlock scoffed.  It was funny how a particular turn of phrase could evoke the strangest of memories, he made it a point never to be referred to by anyone as ‘Mr Holmes’.  Mycroft had his uses, but wasn’t somebody Sherlock chose to spend time with if he could help it, nor with anyone who felt Mycroft was someone that THEY wanted to spend time with.  “Then if it’s all the same to you, Sherlock, I’ll use MY medical degree to continue your medical examination.  Could you remove your coat, scarf, jacket and shoes, please?  And just pop on the scales when you have, I need to record your height and weight,” the doctor replied.
Sherlock feigned interest, allowing him to chatter on until there was an appropriate moment to interrupt.
“Well…. No, I suppose not, unless he just came in every night..?” the girl replied, her head on one side.  Sherlock was already scanning the room again, so John grinned apologetically and raised his pint in a kind of salute, as the bartender was already moving off down to another customer at the other end of the bar.  She smiled and waved him off as she took the customer’s order.
,” he sneered the word out in a parody of Sherlock’s usual tone, “but I’ve had enough sex to recognise the sound of a blowjob when I hear one, and I’d like to think I can recognise the sounds you make when you’re… enjoying yourself…” John slumped to the bed as his steam ran out, and he looked up at Sherlock with his eyes wet.  “Look, I’m sorry, of course you can see anyone you want to… but I don’t think I can stay here if you’re bringing other people back, it’s too painful…”
“John, that’s not going to work, I won’t be able to get to you properly.  Come and lay down on the sofa, that’ll be easier.”  John groaned inwardly, but realised Sherlock was right, so he got up from the chair, hoping against hope that he wouldn’t embarrass himself.  The hope seemed to be enough to calm his arousal enough for him to make it to the sofa.  He lay face down; the graze covered right around the back of John’s thigh, and he thought the time laying on his stomach might be enough to give him time to cool off altogether.  Sherlock sat on the floor right next to the sofa, his head at the same height as John’s legs, and began to clean the wound.  He sat so close to John that he could feel Sherlock’s warm breath on the back of his legs, and to John’s dismay, his cooled arousal started to warm up again.  Sherlock leaned close, picking out the last of the gravel and cleaning the graze out.
“Have you ever had a prostate exam, Sherlock?” John asked as he fetched some lubricating jelly from the cupboard.  “No,” came the response.  “I thought they were usually done on men who are… older… than me, but I’m sure whatever you think will be… good.  What would you like me to do?”
Many thanks as always to Catherine, for being my lovely beta, and for pointing out John's feelings about Sherlock's misfortune....
“I’ll let Sherlock know it’s just your heat, I daresay he panicked because as far as I know, he’s never been in a relationship with an Omega before you.  I’m sure he’ll be back as soon as he can, but that’ll keep you going in the meantime, okay?  I’ll give you a call in a few days, see how you are,” and with that, Mike had left, securing the door behind him.  John had felt so weak and wretched he hadn’t even been able to put Mike right about the nature of his relationship with Sherlock.
“It’s not,” she replied, setting down Sherlock’s drink, “but we have an LGBT night every week, it’s pretty popular.”  John handed over a twenty-pound note and waited for his change.  Sherlock had already picked up his drink and was scanning the crowds.  “Oh, I see,” replied John.  “Is it the same night every week? I suppose it must be, or how would people know?”
Greg had tried to leave Sherlock alone while John was still in the hospital, but when the brutal triple murder he’d been working on had given him no further leads for the second week in a row, he gave in and visited Baker Street.  Mrs Hudson was out, picking up a few things John had asked Sherlock to bring in with him the next time he came, but Greg had a key, so let himself straight in.  He ran up the seventeen stairs to Flat B, knocking on the door even as he opened it and stepped inside.  The sight that greeted him was something he had never imagined he would ever see.  Sherlock was stretched out on the sofa in his dressing gown, fast asleep, with baby Xander snuggled up on his chest.  Sherlock’s arms were tucked around his infant son, cradling him safely even in his sleep.  Greg paused for a moment – he remembered how it had been when his daughter had first been born, feeling like he hadn’t had a proper night’s sleep for the first year – but just as he was about to turn and leave again, Xander wriggled a little, and Sherlock’s eyes fluttered open as he awoke.  He pressed a kiss to Xander’s wispy hair, and then noticed Greg.
there was something dodgy about her, I just couldn’t put my finger on it!”
-Please let me know if you need anything, those little Danish butter biscuits you’ve been craving, new clothes that fit over your bump, kidnapping…-
“Here you go, little one,” she said, looking down at the baby while handing the bottle to John.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Well Sherlock,” he said, “We’ve finished the medical, but I wonder if we shouldn’t just do a couple of extra tests while I have you here, to save you needing to come back another time?”
have a mark, John,” he said, rubbing gently at the gland, his sensitive fingertips mapping the shape of the indentations.  They were small, and not terribly deep, but they were there.  Something began to itch, deep in Sherlock’s mind palace; something about the shape of the indentations was familiar.  He began to rub absently at the marks, his eyes defocused, and flicking rapidly from side to side as he flicked through his mind palace.
Even with Lestrade’s lights and sirens, the ride to the hospital was interminable because of the volume of traffic on the roads, and Sherlock was more than ready to leap out of the car and run by the time they arrived.  He shoved his way past the crowds of people milling about in reception, scanning the signage for the maternity unit.  Having virtually abandoned the car, Greg followed Sherlock into the hospital, just catching sight of his long legs disappearing around a corner.  He ran after the anxious Alpha, pushing through the crowds of people as swiftly but gently as he could, and caught up with him outside the locked doors to the maternity unit.  Sherlock was repeatedly pushing on the buzzer, rattling the doors and demanding entrance to the unit, which was being denied by a rather stern looking maternity nurse.  He was on the verge of trying to break the door down, when Mycroft appeared, laying his hand gently on the nurse’s arm and speaking softly into her ear.  She glared at Sherlock one more time, and then activated the buzzer to release the door.
“Of course,” he thought wryly “if they weren’t misguided, they wouldn’t be here in the first place!”  He turned the corner, approaching the door, and stopped abruptly.  The door was already ajar.
“What, on my bondy land?” giggled John, bringing his hand up to rub at it too.  At his words, Sherlock froze, his mind racing.
His third heat was stronger still; he had broken down and begged Sherlock to please do something.  Sherlock’s response had been to flee the flat without a word and send Mike Stamford, red-faced and puffing, to John.
Mycroft had managed to secure Sherlock’s return to London by the judicious use of a video seemingly heralding Moriarty’s continued existence, a mystery that was still unsolved, even by the genius himself.  A month or so later, John had returned home unexpectedly one afternoon, after being vomited on by a small child in clinic and needing to change his clothes.  Mary and David hadn’t been able to move fast enough, and shortly after she had packed her suitcase and left their flat, Mycroft had subtly sent John incontrovertible proof that the baby she was carrying was David’s, and not John’s.  He had stopped trying to make things work at that point, packed up everything of value to him (which included precisely nothing that related to his life with Mary but every little thing that related to his life with Sherlock), and left immediately for Baker Street.
When John stepped back into the room, carrying a tray with tea, toast, and a couple of glasses of water, Sherlock was sitting up against the headboard, deep inside his mind palace, reviewing everything he knew about bonding.  John set the tray on the bedside table, and set the plate with Sherlock’s toast on in his lap.  He had found that if he left food close to Sherlock when his mind was occupied, he could usually get him to consume something without realising it.  John settled back into the bed, drawing the duvet up over his lap.  He turned to look at Sherlock, and found a bite-sized piece of toast in front of his mouth, Sherlock pushing it insistently towards him.  He had little choice but to open his mouth and take it for fear that Sherlock might accidentally shove it up his nose, so he did, his lips brushing Sherlock’s fingers.  “Mmff, Sherlock, I’ve got some,” John said when he’d swallowed and found Sherlock was holding another piece of toast under his nose, but even as he spoke, John realised it was pointless as Sherlock was on an entirely different plane.  He sighed, and sat back, resigned to being fed his breakfast.
“Ah, he’s got a classic, lovely motor.  The R33 GTR Nissan Skyline.  0 – 60 in 5 seconds flat, top speed limited to 155 miles an hour…” Westbury’s eyes turned a little misty as he described the car.
“Yes, but… how did you know?” John asked, part of the confusion clearing a little.
Oh-six-fifty-five:  John was observing the parade ground from the window of his office; he would be there exactly at oh-seven-hundred and not a minute before.  So far nine of the twelve were in place, dressed identically in shined black combat boots, camouflage trousers, and olive green t-shirts.  John continued to watch as number ten and eleven ran up, looking around nervously to make sure they weren’t late; he’d obviously made an impression on the group.  The only one missing was the reader.  John sighed, he hoped the lad wasn’t going to be trouble, but it was looking increasingly likely.  He gathered up his clipboard and pen, made his way out of the office towards the parade ground, locking the door securely behind him, and rounded the corner just as his watch beeped the hour.  There were twelve young men waiting for him.
“Yes John?”
“What did you do that for?” asked John as Sherlock stuck his arm out into the road to catch the attention of a passing taxi.
“Would you really want me to come back?” Sherlock asked quietly.
“I’m afraid I’m an ex-soldier,” he said, apologetically, “invalided out a few years ago.  So I wouldn’t quite do, would I?”
Again, Balthasar's and the Olde Hansa are real restaurants, and both come highly recommended, especially the Olde Hansa - the berry schnapps is lovely and caused me to get temporarily disowned by my friends - oops...  They do a wonderful bear - yes, bear - and the best filet mignon I have ever eaten.  Go there if you can, you won't regret it!
“I’ll look forward to it,” Sherlock growled, and John knew there would be more than lunch on the menu...
“I know that it’s possible that his eyes will change colour, but I really hope they don’t… they look so much like yours, Sherlock, they’re beautiful…” John smiled as he realised Sherlock hadn’t taken in a single word he had just said.  He activated the button that would raise the back of the bed, allowing him to sit up, and then touched his Alpha gently on the hand, saying, “Are you going to pick him up then?”
After a week or so of diligent searching, however, Sherlock had come across a rogue article that hadn't been taken very seriously due to the fact that it had been written by an Omega neuropsychologist, and published in a very new and very obscure journal, that seemed to be written only by Omegas.  It appeared to hint at the idea that some Omega-Alpha pairings were neurochemically much stronger than most, but what intrigued John about the article - other than the fact that it had been written and published by an Omega! - was that part of the study had involved interviewing the couples about their experiences.  Other 'standard' couples had been interviewed also, to provide a control, and when the statistics were considered, the 'enhanced' couples both reported feelings of instant attraction, a feeling almost like panic when they were separated from each other, and in two cases, bonding had occurred after a bite but before any sex had happened.  Admittedly the gap between the two events hadn't been very long in those cases, but Sherlock thought it sounded similar enough to his and John's situation that it warranted checking out.  He fired off a quick email to the neuropsychologist, Dr Beardshaw, asking for a meeting.
Sherlock and John wandered out of the shopping centre, heading back towards the Old Town.  John had just introduced Sherlock to the delights of cherry hot chocolate – a hot chocolate drink so thick it was as though a bar of chocolate had just been melted into a glass.  It was served in a martini glass, with a shot of green cherry syrup in the bottom, and it was the best thing Sherlock had ever tasted.
“I don’t know if he’ll be well enough, won’t he be better off staying in hospital, just in case?” Sherlock’s eyes were a little desperate as he looked to Greg for reassurance.
Sammy, the girl from the coffee shop, is pretty persistant… I had to tell her this morning that I'm already in a relationship, but she still insisted on walking back with me this evening when I bumped into her… I walked her back to her flat, but I'm pretty sure she followed me back here… I've got the curtains shut because she's lurking around outside, sitting at Speedy's with the same cup of tea now for over an hour….
“Please… Sir…” Sherlock said, his voice rough with arousal, and he rolled his hips, grinding his arse against John’s throbbing cock.  John sucked in a breath of air and hissed loudly.  He grabbed the bottom of Sherlock’s olive green t-shirt and pulled it from the camouflage trousers, pulling it up over his pinned arms.  Both men knew that Sherlock was more than capable of freeing himself if he should choose to, but the illusion of Sherlock’s helplessness ramped up both mens’ arousal…
Sherlock followed Lestrade into his office, took one look at Bateson sitting hunched over in the chair, and barked “No! He’s not your man, just look at his hair!”  Lestrade’s mouth fell open, his gaze swinging from Sherlock to Bateson and back again.  “His hair? What are you talking about?”
The two men took a few moments to get their breath back, and then John slowly and carefully slid himself out of Sherlock’s arse, watching, a little dribble of come slipping out before he closed up tightly.  John tucked himself away, zipping his trousers up again, and looked at Sherlock with a smile.  He was still draped over John’s desk, panting.
“Sh’lock… I’m gonna fuck you so hard, I’m gonna fill you…” With a sudden grunt, John was coming; moaning and gasping.  Sherlock watched transfixed, trying to stop his own moans escaping him by stuffing his free hand into his mouth and biting down on the knuckles.  He was suddenly aware of the danger; John’s orgasm might well awaken him, and Sherlock would be caught in the captain’s room in the middle of the night, cock in hand, wanking over him.  The thought pushed him over the edge, and there was nothing he could do to stop his own orgasm, Sherlock’s semen mixing with John’s on John’s bare chest.
texting Sherlock whenever he needed the detective’s input.  If John’s reply meant Greg would have to put up with Sherlock on his own, he made sure the case was at least an eight, or failing that, he just waited for John to be free.
For the first time, Sherlock looked John directly in the eye, a small smile on his face.  “John, I can’t tell you how happy I was when you came back to live here… I knew I loved you since the moment I started planning how things would go down on the rooftop… I couldn’t bear the idea that you would have to see me die, and that was when I realised how I felt… But I didn’t know I wanted you until that night at Mungo’s.”
“Well I think we should consider a prostate check,” John replied hurriedly, “Obviously if there are any issues, the sooner we catch them the better.  And I’d like to check for hernias too, you seem to have quite a physical job, judging by what the Met wanted me to check!”  John knew this would be the deciding point, Sherlock was obviously not a stupid man, he had diagnosed the two patients in the waiting room without the benefit of any medical training, and correctly too, if John’s experience was anything to go by.  Even ordinary everyday patients these days seemed to know that men should start having a prostate exam at about age 50, and Sherlock was not even close.  If he objected now, John could claim to have misread his age, make a joke about thinking he looked young for his age, and that would be the end of it.  If, however, as he suspected he would, Sherlock agreed the medical exam was necessary…

“But… Mycroft… his jacket…”
“I’m sorry, what?”  John wasn’t sure what the question had to do with the price of fish; it certainly didn’t seem to bear any relevance to any other conversation that had been going on, and now the man wasn’t even looking in his direction, but typing rapidly on a computer.  John couldn’t help feeling more than a little confused.
Sherlock was stretched out on the sofa, thinking about what he could do to resolve things with John.  He jumped a little when the door to the flat opened and John staggered in, Sherlock had assumed he was at work – John’s schedule had the day down as a work day, and Sherlock didn’t know he’d now got the day off as they hadn’t been speaking.  The moment Sherlock saw John’s face, he leapt up from the sofa, his face radiating concern.  “John! What happened, did you get attacked?”  John struggled to his chair and sat down with a thump, his face grimacing with pain as he landed on his scraped skin.  Sherlock knelt quickly between his thighs, gently taking John’s face between his hands and turning it to better catch the light.  He winced at the scrapes on John’s face, and without speaking, fetched a bowl of warm water from the kitchen, a glass of water and the first aid kit from under the bathroom sink.  He returned quickly to John, handing him two paracetamol and the glass of water, then began dabbing at the scrapes on his face with a piece of gauze that he’d dampened with warm water and antiseptic.  He worked quickly and quietly, cleaning the edges of the grazes, picking out small pieces of gravel and cleaning the rest of the dirt out of the wound and dressing it.
Since he had been back in the UK, John had tried to find an Alpha to help him out, even going so far as to try the online matching services.  It had gone well to start with; he’d found someone who seemed to all intents and purposes to be compatible with him.  They had shared a love of music, read many of the same books, and John had recommended some that Matt hadn’t read, but had instantly fallen in love with, buying the author’s complete works.  They laughed together too, over stupid re-runs of Top Gear, or the bad “dad jokes” Matt’s dad emailed to him, which he then told John.  All had been well until John had texted Matt that his heat was starting.  Matt had dropped everything and come running, as promised, and John had been looking forward to having someone to share his heat with at last. Matt had only taken two steps into John’s bedroom before his face twisted into a grimace, and he had covered his mouth and nose with the crook of his elbow and run.  John had received a text two days later, saying that Matt didn’t feel they were compatible after all, and any attempts to contact him had been fruitless.  John suspected Matt had blocked his number, but he couldn’t imagine why.  That had been the first day he had pulled the gun from the drawer, and tried to find a reason not to use it.  Since then, John’s heats had been sad and lonely affairs, conducted by himself in the privacy of his bedsit.  He didn’t even try to find someone to share his life with any more, the few days of fun wasn’t worth the crippling agony of rejection when another heat hit him.
“Oh Anderson,” Sherlock sneered, “no wonder you’ve been caught, I’m amazed you can manage to get dressed in the mornings without assistance!  I know your glasses are new because I can see the marks behind your ears from where you haven't got used to them yet.  The fact that your glasses are new means you must have only just bought them, so you must have got them locally, and I know that there’s only one optician in the local area you could have got them from.  Oh, and this particular design is £400 for the frames alone.  Where did you get the money from? I know you don’t have savings, because of the botch job you’ve been doing with your car.  It’s obvious from the polishing that it’s your pride and joy, so if you’d got the money you’d have had the rust sorted out and the paintwork done properly, but you can’t, can you?  Or people will ask where you got the money; everyone knows you’re broke.  Glasses are easy, nobody pays attention to those unless they wear them too, and nobody in the garage does.  You probably told them you got them from the value range at Tesco.”
“I missed you, John,” John could hear and feel the self-contempt in Sherlock’s voice; the great detective did not have feelings for other people, “and I couldn’t wait for you any longer.”
Two months later…
“Okay,” William said, shuffling closer along the branch.  John turned his head to the side, and William’s surprisingly sharp teeth bit down hard, releasing a squirt of fluid into his mouth.  It didn’t taste good like William’s favourite vanilla milkshake, but it wasn’t awful either.  “Now your turn,” he said, yanking at the collar of his shirt and pulling it down to expose the gland.  John bit down just as hard as William had; in truth he was a little annoyed, it had hurt more than he was expecting, and William’s little yelp as the skin broke made John feel a bit better.  As William yelped, he pulled himself sharply away from John, causing the older boy to wobble, overbalance, and finally tumble from the branch.  Luckily for John, it wasn’t a long fall, but there were enough sharp twigs to poke and scratch at him on the way down that he ended up covered in scratches and grazes by the time he thumped onto the soft ground under the tree.  William scrambled down quickly, worried for his friend, but after a moment or two it looked as though John was fine, if a little dazed and winded.
“Is that it?"
Tears leaked from John’s eyes, and it was all Sherlock could do to stay still, almost vibrating on the floor.  “There won’t be any risk, Sherlock, I’ve never had a proper heat!  If my friendship means anything to you at all, for God’s sake, please help me!”
“Oh no you don’t,” growled John, grabbing his other hand too, and holding both wrists firmly in the arch of Sherlock’s back.  John could see Sherlock’s eyes slam shut and his breathing deepen, and the moan he let out had John snapping his hips forward once more.  John bent forward, his lips to Sherlock’s ear.
Sherlock managed to placate Greg with promises to find out what had happened and a reminder that he had a taxi waiting outside, and shooed him out of the flat.  He sat with his hands steepled beneath his chin, and thought for a while.  He wasn’t aware of anything that had happened; he would have seen it on John, the man was ridiculously easy to read.  His thoughts drifted to the book he had seen on John’s bedside table.  It had been something about saying yes to everything, Sherlock remembered, and just like that the answer came to him.  John had decided to adopt the same tactic.  Sherlock smiled to himself; the next few weeks should be fun.
Sherlock and John had avoided each other for two days now, both dreading what the other might say.  Sherlock managed to stay in his room until after John had left for the surgery, then he went out, not returning until the early hours of the morning, well after John had retired to bed.  John knew this was when he returned, because he was still lying awake in his bed fretting, and he heard the squeak of the door to the flat.  John, in turn, stayed out late after work, choosing to eat in the pub, or join various friends for coffee, not returning until he was sure Sherlock would have left.
know,” he indicated Donovan and Anderson, standing a little way off and trying to work out if any of them were actually needed.  “Do you do other magic tricks too?”  His eyes twinkled as he asked John the question.
“This… “gentleman”… (John could almost hear the quotation marks falling into place) needs to have a medical for his work, Dr Watson, and I’m just explaining to him that he needs to book an appointment,” replied Liz through gritted teeth.  “Are there any more patients waiting to be seen?” John enquired.  “Not any more,” Liz muttered.  “I have some time free, why don’t I see… Mr Holmes, was it?  Make life easier for everyone,” John smiled.  “Well if you’re sure, Doctor?”  Liz turned back to the tall man who clearly felt he had won this round.  “If you’d like to follow the Doctor…” she said, hanging on to civility by the tiniest thread.
“What are you still doing here, Jilly?” John mumbled.  “I thought Mark would have been over to get you by now!”  Mark was one half of Mrs Turner’s married ones, and Jilly’s owner.  John and Sherlock had agreed to look after her for a few days while the couple had a long weekend break in Cornwall.  At John’s words, Sherlock cocked his head to one side and made an odd noise John had never heard him make before.  “Sherlock? Are you okay? You’re acting very strangely today…” At his words, Jilly closed her eyes and let out a huge snort.  She walked over, carefully picked up John’s mobile from the floor by the sofa and dropped it in his lap, where it bounced right into his testicles, causing him to fold in half with a wince.  The berserker in his head responded by pounding on his brain with a sledgehammer, just for a little variety.
John Watson had been crawling through the gap in the high stone wall at the bottom of his road for about two years now.  His friend William lived in the big house that the wall was boundary to, along with his Mummy and Daddy and his big brother Mike.  At seven, William wasn’t as old as John, who was ten, but where John had inherited his dad’s short stature, William was tall and willowy, so people might mistake them for being the same age.  Today, the boys were hiding down by the large pond, with a rather dirty jam jar that they were planning to use to catch tadpoles.  John didn’t quite believe William when he said the small black wriggly creatures would turn into frogs, so William had suggested they catch some and take them home where John could watch them and find out for himself.
Sherlock and John go to Mungo's so Sherlock can try and spot the killer... Things don't go quite the way either Sherlock or John are expecting...

There was a girl in the cafe with a rather distinctive haircut though, she was asking me about the best place to get lunch, said she'd just moved to the area because it means she won't have to travel so far to get to work… Not sure why she'd be asking if she works in the area though, surely she'd have worked out already where the best places are?  Anyway, she was asking where I live, turns out she's just around the corner from me… I didn't want to give her too many details, you can never be too sure whether someone's genuine or a bit of a nutter hiding in plain sight, besides, Sherlock wouldn't be too keen on the idea that I've been telling pretty girls all of my personal details…
“I am NOT wearing these!” John glared at Sherlock before stalking back off to the cubicle to undress.  Sherlock moved quickly around the room, grabbing a white crop top and tight pair of baby blue hot pants with numerous zips and ties on them.  He handed them to Rob with a wicked smile, and turned back to the clothes.  He knew there was no way on earth that John would agree to the outfit he had picked out, so he moved quickly to select the next one.
When he felt a little better, John picked up the mobile, and saw he had a message from Mark, stating that he and his husband had been delayed, but if it was okay with John and Sherlock, he’d collect Jilly the following morning.  John fired back a quick message saying that was fine, and collapsed back to the sofa once more.
Sherlock moved over to the table, nosing at the piles of letters. “O, B, V, I, okay, okay, Sherlock, I get the message… Well at least we know that’s going to work, I suppose, nice to know I’m still an idiot even when you’re not in the right body!”  Sherlock rolled his eyes again, and spelled out, “N O T A N I D I O T,” John laughed.
.  Well, if he wasn’t going to be appreciated, he wouldn’t bother any more, see how John felt about that.  A few moments later, Sherlock heard his phone ring, but when he saw John’s name on the lit screen, he tossed the phone across the room and ignored it.  He didn’t even look up when he heard the ping that signified a voicemail message had been left, he was sure it was just John phoning to tell him how
#sorrynotsorry
Sherlock sat back on his heels, a look of profound hurt on his face at John’s words.  He stood up stiffly, a mask dropping into place over his features, and he turned on his heel, sweeping out of the café.
“Come here.”  Sherlock stepped forwards, and as soon as he was within range, John reached out for Sherlock’s hips, pulling him forwards to straddle one of John’s thighs.
