Steve cleared his throat. “Yes. The ladies insisted. I figured it would be a nice way to celebrate the railway deal and also make it known to the public.”
Steve felt colour rush to his face and was glad no one was around to witness it. Of course it
Slowly, maddeningly, Steve started moving against Tony, his crotch dragging against Tony’s, both men moaning at the feeling of the other’s member against their own. Steve had his face buried in Tony’s neck the entire time, while Tony was left dazed, writhing in the pleasure Steve was giving him.
a small voice at the back of his head reminded.
Steve was reading a letter, Tony noticed, taking a moment to look up from his -futile- search. It was not a long one, that was obvious, since it was only a single page that had been folded on itself, and what seemed like a scarce few words written upon it.
Indeed, how could Steve forget that saving Stark Manor and the rest of the estate had meant so much to Tony, he had practically given his body for it.
certainly wouldn’t. Then again, I know perfectly well how irresistible Anthony can be, especially when
“Oh, I’m sure he does. Well... I should get going now, Tony. It’s getting late and both of us have to get up earlier than dawn.”
He loomed over the fallen form, ready for a fight at any sign of provocation. It didn’t matter anymore that the man before him was a lord, an earl, or even that he was his guest.
He could scarcely make sense of what he had seen. Instinctively, his heart told him that, whatever it was, it wasn’t good. But Steve’s heart had betrayed him in the past, especially where Tony Stark was concerned, so he had learned not to trust it that easily.
“We will join the others in taking a walk around the grounds. Come,” Steve stated with finality before heading outside, Tony rushing behind him.
not to feel jealous of a ghost. Whoever she might have been, Margaret Rogers was long gone, and to think ill of the dead was considered bad luck, even by sceptics like himself. But Tony had always been known for failing rather than succeeding at most of his endeavours, and, naturally, this one wasn’t an exception.
In a few to-the-point lines, Bucky informed Steve of his imminent arrival along with Lady Natalia and Mr Banner. He also indicated that during his stay in the capital, he had met with Fury and that the general had given him some new information on a matter Steve had recently inquired about.
Tony had a strong feeling he was being made fun off. It wasn’t a nice feeling, but he swallowed it down, wanting this conversation to be over.
Once upon a time he had thought the
“Lord Rogers was telling me this morning how pleased he’s been with your performance.”
“Oh,” Steve exclaimed, astonished. “You’ve actually been there?”
asking me that,
He managed to reach Steve at the top of the hill, where they both stopped and admired the tranquil scenery unfolding before them.
When he wanted, Steve could move really
?” he spat at Steve, lashing out like a wounded animal.
But then again this situation was as far from marriage as one could get. This was a business deal. It was carnal desire, it was a transaction.
As soon as he was up he made his excuses and left, dreading to meet Barnes’ eyes.
Steve excused himself soon after, doubting he would be good company if he remained.
It had been days since the letter first arrived, and still Tony couldn’t for the life of him figure out how to answer his dearest friend.
He can feel Steve’s panting breath on his face, he’s so close to him. His love. Steve, who’s still violently -but welcome, always welcome-, grasping his arm. Tony knows he’d never regret Steve’s touch. It may be the last time he’s touching Tony. Tony will treasure it, no matter its intention, he’s fucked up like that. Howard, Obie and many others have seen to it long before Steve ever walked in his life.
Perhaps his old friend was right, after all.
Steve’s eyes sparkled with amusement. A rare smile added to the man’s handsome features to the point of completely distracting Tony.
Please let me know if you liked it! Also, wish me good luck in my exams tomorrow! 🤞🏼
“Well?” Steve said, sounding smug, of all things. It made Tony huff in indignation. He was no lady, needing help to dismount. Then again, if that was how Steve had decided to treat him then fine. Tony was willing to accept the offer just out of spite.
“Yes, well. Thank you,” he said finally to Steve, clearing his throat, flustered.
Steve had just gotten out of his formal jacket and vest, his shirt hanging out of his breeches, when he heard a light knock from the door leading to the adjoining study, the room connected to the lady’s study.
Nothing lasted forever as Tony had painfully learned. And, as his father used to say, Stark men were made of iron. They endured.
“Natalia wishes to return to town before her cousin Lady Dimitrova leaves for the continent, and the rest of us have decided to head back with her. You should stay here and continue to work on the house,” he stated, somewhat calmer.
Bruce and Clint quickly got absorbed in a friendly debate about the morals of hunting for sport and soon fell behind, while Steve, Lady Natalia and Tony went on ahead, with Tony hovering near the pair of friends as if reluctant to be there. Steve resisted the urge to feel bad about excluding the man. Still, Tony, true to his ever-social nature, didn’t fail to speak up here and there, adding to his and Lady Natalia’s conversation.
Steve strolled down the winding path towards the church, following the rhythmic peal of the bells that called all parishioners to gather for Sunday service. He did his best not to pay any attention to the curious looks and whispers he attracted on the way there.
Steve made a conscious effort to keep his voice calm when he finally addressed Tony, afraid that the man would either close off entirely - or, even worse, flee again - if he felt pressed.
“What do you think Peggy would say if she were here, Steve?” he asked out of nowhere.
“No!”
A couple of times Steve had thought he'd caught Stark's eyes turning a bit too glassy or his smile a bit too fixed, but it had passed too quickly to be anything but his mind playing tricks on him. After all the lighting in the room wasn’t ideal, there being too few candles due to the meagre budget the manor had been forced to operate under these last few years. Not for long though. Steve was already planning a great deal of changes around the place.
Stone’s smile widened at Steve’s hesitation. “Are you willing to throw away the chance at a better livelihood for so many people, all for the sake of some misguided notion of preserving Anthony Stark’s ruined reputation?”
Steve wished he first discussed this with his secretary, but the man seemed to have simply disappeared. So, Steve would have to deal with the matter himself.
“Ah, Steve, Mr Stark!” Clint exclaimed, coming closer and looking grateful for Tony’s intervention.
Tony, unsurprisingly, didn’t show up for dinner that night.
“Yes, that is all.”
He was dressed in nothing but a loose pale grey nightshirt and Steve’s breath caught at the enticing sight of him, his treacherous heart skipping a beat. Tony Stark always had a handsome face and a striking figure, always gathering the looks and praise of his peers, but somehow seeing him brought down to this, barefoot before him and vulnerable in his almost naked state made something primal inside Steve -some wounded old part of him- roar in approval.
The thought of him being able to inspect Tony’s bruised buttock thoroughly at the end of the day made Steve’s laughter quiet down.
Jarvis still insisted on assisting Tony with getting dressed. Since Steve had brought his own footman along with him, the old butler had apparently decided he had nothing better to do in the mornings but tend to Tony.
He regarded the man before him. Sir James Buchanan Barnes was a difficult man to work out. For one, he had never seemed to warm up to Tony. One could have taken that as a sign of contempt for Tony’s now fallen position in the eyes of society. But Tony knew that Barnes, much like Steve, had actually come from a humble background.
At that moment he was so much like the guileless boy of Tony’s youth that Tony found himself in a daze. His legs moved as if on their own taking him closer to Steve. When he was finally in front of him he looked in his eyes, not uttering a word, fearing the spell might be broken and the cold, distant Steve will reappear. He fell to his knees.
Lust must have been evident on his face because he soon caught Stark hurriedly lowering his eyes, cheeks darkened. Steve paused. Surely the famous Anthony Stark who’s had more lovers than money these last few years, wasn’t one to shy away from their deal?
. They’d fought so many times Tony had long lost count.
gossip.
Losing his mother to consumption, losing his wife to fever, losing his love to money. Steve supposed he was born to be unlucky in love. Though that was unfair to his friends. He would have been lost to his grief if it hadn't been for Bucky, Clint and the others keeping him company and forcing him to carry on with his life. It was with their help that, like every other time he'd had his heart crushed, Steve had managed to move on.
“So… this is where you’ve been hiding all afternoon, Mr Stark,” Barnes asked, startling him out of his book. Tony must have lost time, if he’d been absent long enough for it to be noticed. Ever since he was a boy he had found refuge in the library and its vast collection of literature. Of course, back then the only thing Tony wanted to avoid was his father’s lectures.
How could one man be so tempting and yet so infuriating at the same time? Steve’s arms tightened around him, not willing to let go.
On their way back, Steve tried to engage Mr Hogan in small talk. He was eager to get to know the members of his new household better, now that he had no more guests to entertain. Mr Jarvis and his wife he already knew from his time in the Starks’ service, but the rest he was unfamiliar with.
He had said
Unsurprisingly, all Tony feels in this moment is fear. It’s almost blinding in its intensity, the fear he feels for Steve’s safety, for Steve’s
Bucky took a gulp of his drink. “No, nothing’s wrong,” he denied, not convincing Steve for a second.
“Just to sleep,” he said, bringing one of his hands up to cup at the back of Tony’s head and draw him close. Even in the dark, he could feel Tony’s questioning gaze burning his skin.
Boldly, Tony took a step forward, then another and finally he was at grasp length from Steve. From that close, Steve couldn’t help but marvel at their physical differences. He was shorter than Steve, slighter too. So different from what they'd been before. And yet he looked eerily like the same, almost delicate Tony from his past. Again, the wild thing inside Steve roared with approval. This, Tony, was his to have.
“I never said it was,” Bucky replied, fixing Steve with a penetrative stare. “You’re still in love with him, aren’t you?” he asked slowly, more of a rhetorical question than anything else. “Even after all these years...”
Then, the rest of Steve’s words registered and Tony frowned. What was Steve implying by asking if he only meant
It was barely half an hour’s ride to the place. Thankfully, Steve shared it with Bucky, Lady Natalia and Mister Banner, so it passed in a rather quiet manner.
Making a sound that could only be described as a growl, Steve prowled through the room to where Tony was still standing frozen, looking at Steve with wide, desperate eyes, his pupils completely blown.
Shaking his head, Steve forced on a smile. “I’m perfectly fine, Timothy. I just have a lot on my mind, that is all. You know me, all duty and no fun...”
That night they never made it to the master bedroom.
He picked a pen and began to write.
When he finally got to Tony’s member he found it already half swollen. Taking the first exploring lick, Steve moaned, tasting divinity for the first time.
. Perhaps once, years ago, he had. But nowadays what was he for Tony but an endless cause of stress, nothing more than a duty for this man whom Steve had come to cherish again, so much.
is where love has gotten him in the end.
“You, my lady, are a menace,” Tony said taking the lady’s delicate hand in his own and bringing it to his lips with a flourish.
Perhaps he was going about it the wrong way. If Steve couldn’t keep Lord Stone away from Tony for the rest of his visit, then he would just have to keep
He was dressed rather informally, just a pair of trousers and a half-tucked shirt, and was apparently in the middle of discussing business with one of the contractors for the house. Just by looking at him, it was evident Tony had spent the morning working along with the other men. Both his clothes and his face were smudged with paint.
“I see you came prepared,’ he noted, and if he sounded judgemental well, it was probably because he felt it too.
He yelped in surprise at the feel of hands grabbing under his armpits and then he was being lifted on the air, Steve getting both of them up in one smooth motion. Dazed, Tony held on to him for dear life as Steve used their momentum to turn and then unceremoniously drop Tony onto the writing desk. Objects went flying to the floor and Tony distantly thought someone must have heard the commotion, but couldn’t really find it in him to care. He ended up on his back, legs hanging over Steve’s shoulders, nightshirt drawn up, barely covering his sensitive nipples as Steve slowly fucked inside him.
“What on earth are you doing, Stark!” he said, crumpling the letter hastily into a ball. “Have you not heard of the concept of privacy?” he finished, irritated.
The party had moved from the dining room to the music room sometime after being served desert by an ever-diligent Jarvis and staff. Some things were as inevitable as time, Steve supposed. Jarvis being in the service of Stark Manor was one of them.
The kiss soon turned slow, leisurely, leaving Tony almost bereft at the loss of Steve’s previous bout of passion.
“I say, my friend. You are terribly distracted this evening. Is everything alright?” Dugan asked him finally, voice filled with genuine concern.
He cleared his throat, turning his attention to Peter to give the boy the reins and exchange them for a dry towel. He pretended he didn’t notice the unwavering interest with which Peter was watching his and Steve’s interactions.
Steve had always been strangely eager to learn news of Tony’s whereabouts. He was ashamed to remember how vindicated he’d felt when he first realised how far from honourable Tony Stark had proven to be. Steve recalled telling Bucky he was grateful to fate for not leaving him bound to a man like that, once again blaming his boyish foolishness for falling for Tony’s wiles in the first place.
He got up and unlocked the door that linked his office and Stone’s room, acutely aware of the difference of circumstances between the last time he had opened that door, and this one. He had to push aside the memory of Tony’s lovely naked form, writhing and begging for him. This wasn’t the time for it.
The warmth of Steve’s release inside him was what finally brought Tony over the edge. He came, softly whining around the still twitching cock in his mouth.
He’d been unwilling to part with it, even after the horrible way its maker had treated him.
“Tony, Tony…” Steve panted into Tony’s neck, his jaw, his gasping mouth, as he felt Tony’s heat enveloping his aching member. He bottomed out and stilled momentarily, basking at the glorious feeling of him, only moving when Tony clumsily tried to roll his hips, a desperate plea falling from his trembling lips.
He finished quickly, and entered the lord’s study ready to knock for entrance at the main bedroom, only to find to his surprise that Steve was there, in the study.
- prepared king-sized bed Steve considered once again how had they ended up at this point. Perhaps all this luxury had been bought with money from the enemy. It made Steve feel a little better for what’s about to take place. At least theirs was an honest exchange.
He never thought he could be so cruel, but then again he had never thought he would ever cross paths with Tony Stark again.
Others, like Bucky -who’d been his best friend in the army, and his most loyal companion ever since-, already were aware of why Anthony Stark hadn't left after the transaction was completed. Bucky had raised a judgemental eyebrow when he heard that as a term of agreement to the sale of the estate Stark had also been hired as the Lord’s new personal secretary. For a man born with a title to be forced to work for a living, it was as much of a scandal as the true nature of their agreement would be, if it ever came to light. Bucky, knowing all about Steve's old infatuation, definitely suspected there was more to the bargain.
On the floor there was a lidded jar, still rolling slowly to the nearest wall.
So what if Tony wanted to always look his best for Steve? Who would know?
day. Tony blushed deeply. “You spoke of things being even
“Right. I… Yes, of course, I can. I will talk to Miss Potts at once,” he replied, his tone business as usual. He got up, gathering his papers close to his chest, and prepared to leave. “Is that all, my lord?”
Natalia, no doubt picking up on Steve’s discomfort, tried to cover the awkward silence. “Do not for a moment forget it, Mr Stark,” she said playfully. “We womenfolk can be twice as cunning as a man, and far more dangerous too. I’m sure I don’t need to tell you about women using their special talents to accomplish nefarious goals. We shall soon rule the world!” she exclaimed happily, leaning on a nearby tree for rest.
Why would the man leave in such a hurry, Steve wondered. And where to? It was too convenient an escape, if that were actually the case. Was the man really gone? Was he even
He finally caught up with Tony inside Tony’s new room. He found him pacing, looking ruffled and distressed, but otherwise unharmed. A pang of guilt surged through him as he quickly inspected his surroundings, Tony’s newest lodgings. Unsurprisingly, this room lacked both size and decoration compared to his previous one, but, more importantly, it barely looked lived in. It seemed impersonal, pristine and tidy, just like any other guest room in the manor.
hands.
It was so easy for Tony to forget in the throes of ecstasy that for Steve, this was all just sating his carnal desires. Such struggle for him not to imagine there was more to Steve’s passion than pure lust.
Barnes shook his head, walking into the room, door silently closing behind him. “No need. I was just looking for a book,” he drawled, and Tony had to resist an eye roll at the obvious lie. “I didn’t expect to find you here. Do you have any suggestions for me?”
Bucky frowned, thinking it over. “Fury said that there’s a navy man looking for him. Rhodes, I think his name was. He says he’s a friend of Stark's. Ever heard of him?”
He wondered if those looks had to do with him being something out of the ordinary, a breath of fresh air to their dull, everyday lives, or if they were just curious to see a man who had been raised to nobility by his deeds and accomplishments rather than being born into it.
“Could anything be done to find Stane? Make him confess?” he wondered aloud.
Steve needed to take a step back and think everything through. He needed to strategize. No matter how hard he wished to, he knew he couldn’t afford to accuse an earl of assaulting a member of his staff - and Tony Stark of all people - without any evidence or witnesses.
“You are way out of line here, Bucky,” Steve told him, feeling numb. It wasn’t as if he hadn’t had those exact thoughts himself before. He had had reservations about this entire affair from the start but Steve had -in a rare display of the weaker side of his normally virtuous character- found himself unable to do the proper thing.
No, Tony had done the right thing in selling.
In one swift move Steve tagged the loose shirt off Tony’s shoulders, ignoring the surprised cry of protest and pulled down. With it finally on the floor, Steve was at last free to admire Tony’s glorious naked form.
It was close to dawn, sometime after they had both gotten too tired to continue when Tony finally got up, redressed and silently exited the room the same way he had entered, all under Steve’s half-asleep gaze.
'He brings out the worst in me', Steve thought bitterly.
What a show they're putting on.
. Honestly, how damaged was Tony, to have turned his wide eyed, open-hearted beautiful captain into
Jarvis knew he was sleeping with Steve. Oh, God. Tony had never felt more embarrassed in his entire life. Did Jarvis also know about the deal? Had he -god forbid- seen them together in bed? Tony was mortified.
Nevermind me, though. Let's get to the chapter. Please mind the tags, as usual.
, I get to enjoy it too’.
Cliffhanger, who would have thought? Yeah, yeah... I'm evil, I know.
“It has come to my notice that you are spending a lot of time with Lord Rogers, that is, aside from your working for the man. Now, I may be old, but I still seem to remember how fond you both were of each other as children. I always thought it was unfortunate how you grew apart.”
They found Lady Natalia, Mr Banner and Sir Barton nearby, playing catch with Tony’s -well,
If Jarvis was surprised, he didn’t show it. “Of course, my lord. May I ask when the guests will be arriving?”
But when Steve finally turns to him he is far from smiling.
Tony’s ears were ringing, his mind reeling to the point of barely being able to grasp the rest of what Steve had said.
The squick of the old door hinges was almost too loud in the deafening silence that filled the room. Steve supposed he should ask Jarvis to oil them as soon as possible, part of the house maintenance of course. Or better yet he would have his secretary see to it.
He supposed it was unavoidable that his first appearance amongst them would stir such excitement. As a lord, Steve knew he had several societal obligations, attending church being one of them. Though he had, he admitted, been a little neglectful in exercising his faith since he had moved to the estate.
Tony’s eyes were glistering in the candlelight. Steve kept his gaze fixed on them as he once again grabbed Tony’s hips and lifted him with little difficulty before lining himself with the oil dripping hole and slowly pushing in.
“Well, if it isn’t Steve Rogers, out of his gloomy tower at last!” Lady Natalia teased, hooking her delicate arm though his own. She looked lovely as always, in a rather simple -though never plain- white muslin dress. They all gathered around him, and soon went on with their stroll, admiring the gardens. It was clear that, even in the few weeks since they had arrived there, much work had been done in order to get them into a better state. Steve had approved of taking on another gardener and it definitely showed.
Steve’s eyes followed his retrieving form until he could no longer see him.
The silence is deafening.
There was an old carved wooden box hidden at the bottom of Steve’s old travelling chest. It had been one of the few things of his childhood Steve had kept with him in the army and through the years after.
“Giving patronage to St. Mary Magdalene’s? That would truly be wonderful of you, Steve! They could definitely use the money for better insulation and general repairs. That damp old building is practically uninhabitable through winter, especially the second floor…”
Steve’s heart quickened at the sight of him. How was this bright-eyed man in front of him possibly the same man that was the source of so much gossip and scandal?
It was there, amongst his most treasured and secret possessions, that Steve had hastily shoved the letter he received from Fury the other day. He had thankfully been quick enough to hide it from Tony’s curious eyes, though he’d reacted a bit too harshly to the man’s well-intentioned nosiness.
I'm back, baby! And this time with two betas now no less! So let me just thank my amazing betas EachPeachPearPlum and Lacrimula_Falsa for helping me out with this chapter. Love you guys ❤️
Steve had moments to think of how he should react, before Tony, free of Lord Stone’s grip, decided to excuse himself in a most hurried manner and headed - all but ran - upstairs.
Inside the house, Tony went straight to his rooms in order to change before he ended up coming down with a cold after all. He resurfaced in time for supper, which was served in one of the private dining rooms of the manor, since these days it was only himself and Steve at the table.
Steve had…he had called him
Steve’s heart would be safe from the man if it wasn’t at all there. So, Steve decided he would be heartless and try his best to hate the man Tony had become.
Steve frowned, finding the reference to the previous Lord Stark as odd.
, he loved to tease, back in the day, when he belonged to their ranks.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Steve…” Tony repeated, as if only now realising it wasn’t a dream, that Steve was actually in the room with him and then Steve was on him like a lion on its prey.
Far from it.
I'd also like to thank AvengersNewB for being an awesome cheerleader.
“It would have to be very short notice, you realize, my dear. I have to be back in town next week, so the only possible date for a ball would be on the eve of our departure, a mere six days from tonight. You can’t possibly be asking that of our host!” Dugan pleaded with his wife to see reason.
He leaned forward, swinging his right leg over the mare’s haunches and then used the momentum to push himself away with the left one. He felt Steve’s hands on his waist steadying him, helping carry his weight and absorb the shock of his landing. His face burned as Steve’s larger form pressed close to his back, almost touching, for the first time outside of a bedroom.
Newspaper clippings with Tony’s name printed upon them.
want his affair with Tony to be made public. Stone couldn’t actually walk away from this deal so far into negotiations without raising a lot of eyebrows and at least as many questions.
He followed Steve swiftly, and spilled in his clothes like a green, inexperienced boy.
Steve seemed more amused than irritated. Tony was secretly pleased with himself.
After all these years, after fighting - and winning - the damned war, after getting married and then being
I've been weirdly stressed about updating...  🤔
“Yes?”
After he first moved in his rooms, Steve had, more than once, caught himself staring absently at the closed doors of his new study, as if he were conditioned to listen for the slightest of sounds, the barest of noises, the signs of Tony’s presence coming from the room next door.
Looking down at the letter he had received earlier informing him of his guests’ arrival, he replied “Soon, very soon. This Friday, to be precise.”
These woods were some of the finest in the land, and had been one of the reasons Tony’s father had decided he would build the manor there in the first place.
Well. How was Tony supposed to do his work as Steve’s secretary if Steve didn’t pay any attention to him?
He had no patience to undress, just paused for a moment to get his cock out and then he was on the bed again, kneeling between Tony’s spread legs. He tugged at them, pulling the tempting body closer, bending those graceful knees so far back that Tony was almost folded in half. He aligned himself with the well-prepared hole and slowly pushed his cock inside, inch by inch.
“Watch it,” Steve warned.
“How dare you…” he started, his voice trembling with rage but before he could continue, Stone cut in once more.
Tony startled, wondering how long had Jarvis been in the room without him noticing. He raised a teasing brow at Jarvis’ address. “Better not let anyone else hear you calling me that, my friend.” He smiled accepting the cup, noticing it was one of his personal sets. A delicate porcelain with red and gold flowery details that had been a gift from Pepper for his last birthday. Nothing too extravagant, but very much suited to his tastes. A favourite, no doubt in an elaborate effort of the worried staff to lift his admittedly not stellar as of late mood.
And then…
To the rest of the world he supposed it would seem as a kind gesture, that he had just been considerate enough not to force Stark to reside with those who had once been his own staff. After all the Lady Rogers wasn’t alive anymore in order for her to occupy them.
Steve’s thoughts went back to the conversation he had overheard that morning at church, that gossiping group of friends. He couldn’t help but wonder if any of them ever spared a thought for the comfort of illegitimate children and their poor, damned mothers, beyond ones of contempt.
Take care, everyone ❤️
Steve forced himself to focus on Tony’s face, realising he must have addressed him more than once.
“Stay,” he invited, pressing Tony even further to him.
Tony’s eyes widened, not expecting that kind of reaction from the other man. He felt hurt at Steve’s harsh words while his curiosity only grew greater. What
Could Steve really go on like this? All the uncertainty, the guilt of living like

But advice? That, Tony could give him.
“Steve…” Tony whispered.
Before Steve could respond, he found himself the focus of Mrs Dugan’s enthusiastic attention. “Oh, but what a wonderful idea you had, Sharon! Isn’t it a great idea, Lord Rogers? It will be such a perfect way to end our trip!” she said, clapping her hands repeatedly as she turned towards Steve expecting an answer.
First I would like to apologize for taking so long to update. These past three weeks have been some of the most trying times of my life. I don't want to say too much, just that something happened to someone close to me and it took a while for me to get back to a semblance of normality.
it comfort Tony, or would it just comfort Steve? He, unfortunately, suspected the latter was the real answer and, well, he didn’t really deserve to be comforted, did he?
And then Tony Stark had walked back into his life.
He left the church after promising to Mr Coulson he would join him in a visit of St Mary Magdalene’s, the refuge, later that month.
“But we have barely begun!” Tony sputtered in protest.
Finally, Tony seemed to accept the offer, settling carefully over Steve’s willing body once more. It wasn’t long before his breathing slowed and he drifted off to sleep, leaving Steve helpless to resist placing a lingering kiss on his messy dark hair.
It had been easier to deal with at first. After seeing Tony again for the first time in years, the memories of their bitter parting had come to life, haunting Steve once again, but they had at least served in reigniting those feelings of hurt and anguish that had followed him for years. Steve had felt safe in his anger, his pain. Tony couldn’t hurt him any more than he already had.
The sounds grew distant as the gossiping group turned left down the main street, while Steve stayed rooted to the spot, his mind still reeling.
The days had started growing colder, and, now that Tony’s attention had been drawn to it, the familiar chill of autumn was creeping up his limbs. The sky above them looked ready to open up.
“I did some work on the property for Mr Coulson, a year or so ago. Unfortunately, by that time I no longer had resources to be of assistance in any other way. I fixed the pump to the well and some of the windows… Donated some old furniture, too,” he finished simply and happily went on with his tea.
Barnes smirked. “No. A book, Stark. After all, this used to be your collection. I would expect you are the best person to ask.”
Stark was touching Clint’s arm again in an effort to prompt the man to laugh at some joke or another. Shameless, Steve thought again, forcing his head to turn away.
“A lady never tells,” Natalia answered cryptically, lifting her eyebrows while throwing Tony a suggestive look that said a great deal all by itself. They both burst into giggles, and Steve’s mouth tightened in displeasure. This was far from proper.
“Glad I could be of assistance.”
When Steve saw Tony that morning, looking once again his perfectly poised self, with only the hint of dark circles rimming his eyes to betray the events of the previous evening, Steve could only admire how adept Tony was at masking his emotions.
At that, Tony’s strenght -his last bit of it- leaves him. He’s crying openly now, on his hands and knees at the center of the stage, surrounded by the rest of the actors and musicians. He knows he must present quite the spectacle, but he doesn’t care. Nothing matters anymore, only Steve, his safety.
“What, about Betty, the scullery maid?” he stumbled, cheeks flaming.
Steve blanked. “I beg your pardon? I don’t know what you mean…”
“No, don’t be like that, Tony. Please...” Steve interrupted him,  insisting, though still quiet and reluctant, to learn the truth. He tried to voice his gravest concern, the one that he had dared not to think about before: that Lord Stone had - heaven forbid - meant to
than what was already common knowledge, that was.
Tony nodded, happy to be done with the uncomfortable conversation. They turned around, starting a slow trot back towards home. They had nearly made it to the stables when the rain finally caught up with them and it started pouring hard enough to force them to make a run for it.
“It will be only a small one, you understand. Such short notice… But, I was wondering if you would be willing to offer your assistance to Miss Potts until the night of the ball? Perhaps you could go with her to distribute the invitations to our neighbours?” Steve added, trying to keep his manner casual, although probably failing miserably.
Tony cleared his throat, flushed.
“Please, my lord?” Sharon’s gentle voice brought him back from his musings. “It would be such a perfect way to end this wonderful trip,” she said, looking at him with wide eyes.
“But taking Tony’s titles? The Company, yes, I understand why it went bankrupt, but they took Tony’s titles months after everything happened.”
They fucked for hours. Tony, though uncharacteristically calm from the start, had been even more pliant after his first climax. It urged Steve to take control of him, own him, the always feisty Tony Stark being fucked to obedience by Steve Rogers, and so he ended up pushing the other man on his hands and knees to claim him once again from behind. He had lost himself to Tony’s silent sighs of pleasure, to his short gasps as he went over the edge and orgasmed, spoiling the sheets with his spent time and time again. They had ended up lying on their sides, back to chest, with Steve holding Tony in his arms and Steve’ spent cock still lingering inside Tony’s enticing warmth, unwilling to let him go, still chasing the illusion of being finally home.
“Right, right… have the others returned yet, Jarvis?” he inquired, more a formality than a real concern.
Peggy, of course, had been able to see right through him, even then. Her advice was to not pay too much attention to what people said of Lord Stark, because people were cruel more often than not, and to just be glad Tony was still around for Steve to hear news of him. Peggy’s great love, a man she had hesitated talking about with Steve, but would to her dying breath swear half her heart belonged to, had been parted from her too soon, not by circumstances but by death. To this day, the knowledge that Peggy, after her passing, was finally reunited with her Daniel gave Steve a great deal of comfort.
Steve, to this day, used the box to store the most forbidden of his possessions.
Not when Steve is here and in
It made Steve’s gut clench with terrible jealousy
Mr Coulson huffed. “No, I supposed you’d think that, my lord. But the late Lord Stark was a man of tradition. He detested the idea of giving shelter to women who had given birth out of wedlock, and I’m sorry to say that, had it not been for his passing, this place wouldn’t exist. While alive, he was avidly opposed to its creation. Yes, Lord Howard was… a difficult man.”
When they got to the stables, they were met by an ever-diligent Peter carrying fresh towels, no doubt having guessed they’d both need to be patted dry after getting caught in the rain.
“No, dear man, that part where you said something about Lord Howard’s old business partner? Stane, was it?”
Still, Steve supposed his friends had been -rightly- surprised by Stark’s presence among them. After all, most of them only knew Stark as the fallen from grace dandy aristocrat that had barely managed to escape treason charges, losing all his fortune and holdings in the process. All but this very estate which he had after some years ended up selling for scraps.
“Well, Miss Carter... I couldn’t possibly say no after such a heartfelt plea, now, could I? Alright then, we shall have a ball,” Steve stated, to the utter delight of both Miss Carter and Mrs Dugan and the surprise of everyone else at the table.
starving, though. What’s cook prepared for dinner, Jarvis?” Tony asked, as the butler removed the covers from the dishes and the strong aroma of well-cooked meat hit his nose.
“Perhaps you should be heading back to the house, Mr Stark. Notify Jarvis that we’ll likely be late for lunch. And see to it that Peter has my horse ready for this afternoon, will you? I think I want to go for a ride,” he all but ordered.
“You need to appoint a new architect for that pavilion you are obsessed with, my lord,” Tony exclaimed, having just finished reading through the day’s correspondence.
Suddenly, Tony’s eyes snapped open, finally alert to the other presence in his room. His gaze fell immediately on Steve, stunned.
Tony nodded his head eagerly. He scooped up one of Mrs Jarvis’ scones, munching on it as he continued.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I know, but it’s just not the same,” Peter insisted. Tony could only pat his shoulder in sympathy.
Steve wished he was allowed near him. He desperately needed to hold his delicate frame, to offer comfort with his touch. But
Peter hanged his head. “I’m sorry for bothering you with this, Mr Stark. I know I’m being a nuisance. Betsy says I need to be more of a man. She says that real men wouldn’t get sad over silly things like their best friends moving away. Life moves on, she says.”
“Watch out!” Steve exclaimed from the top of the stair, too late. Tony’s leg slipped, his hands flailing in the air comically as he landed on his backside.
Steve couldn’t blame him. After all, how much different had his own behaviour towards Tony been? Steve could never forget the unforgivable way he had behaved towards Tony those first weeks he’d returned to the manor. He had tried hard to seem as cold as he could, to make it clear to Tony that their relationship was nothing more than a transaction, a business deal.
As always, this is dedicated to the lovely sabrecmc.
He ignored his desperate pleas for more, the aimless thrashing of limbs as Tony tried to chase his pleasure and ride Steve’s fingers. He avoided hitting that spot inside Tony, where he knew that sparks would light up when he pressed. He had plans for that spot, later, when his own cock joined the activities.
Steve could only hang his head in shame. He could never lie to Bucky, and he was tired of denying his feelings for Tony.
He really couldn’t come up with anything. He and Steve rarely talked about anything other than their work during the day, and as for the nights…well, there wasn’t really room for talking then…
“What was that for, Steve?” she hissed. “I swear, you are such a child sometimes. Did you have to be so rude to him?”
While Tony felt strangely settled in his role as Steve’s secretary in the day, the same couldn't be said for his role as Steve’s mistress in the night.
“It’s only that, well…yes, I will miss Ned a great deal, but this is such a great opportunity for him, it’s all he’s talked about the last week and I know how tight things have been with money lately for him, but he’s…” Peter slowed, looking at Tony with pleading eyes as he finished saddling the mare. “He’s my best friend, Mr Stark! I’ll never see him if they move away,” he said, forlorn.
Steve shook his head. “I know that. I didn’t mean… Never mind,” he said, lost for words, but now was as good a time as any to inform Tony of their expecting company.
“Good god, sir! You certainly know how to sneak up on someone. I was just reading. Food for the mind as well as the soul, I’ve been told, although I’ve also been told I am soulless, so…” he replied, feigning levity. What business was it of Barnes what Tony did in his spare time?
Steve hated the feeling of impotence, of utter
Back then Tony used to be a hopeless romantic, dreaming of graduating from the university and following in Howard’s footsteps while Steve would gallantly make a name for himself in the army.
Tony had tried his hardest to pry as many details about the late Lady Rogers as he could when Steve’s party of friends had still been there, but he had ultimately failed to learn more than he’d already known. At times, even now, he caught Steve staring out into the empty space when he thought no one was looking, exuding an aura of longing, a heart-aching regret surrounding his beloved form. Tony suspected it had to do with his wife’s passing. He could never be sure, of course, but what else could it be, to be able to bring such melancholy to the other man.
Hogan was a simple man, kind but not overly smart, though very dedicated to his work. He had been a coachman first, but after the master got into heavy debt and had been forced to let some of the staff go, he’d had begun to work as a gardener and a gamekeeper too, in order to help with the upkeep of the estate. He was happy to prattle as they made their way up the hillside.
Oh, and please excuse any mistakes.
It was news to Steve that his friends were leaving him before the prearranged time. He swallowed stiffly, nodding at Bucky in agreement, all the while reeling at the thought of being left behind in Stark Manor, with only Tony and the rest of the staff for company.
All this worry had been, unfortunately, keeping Steve from getting a much needed good night’s sleep. After tossing and turning in his bed fruitlessly for what seemed like hours, he finally decided to give up.
Sorry for taking so long to update, real life had to come first. I should be picking up a better pace with this from now on.
The building itself was a simple but charming cottage. It was situated on top of a hill not five miles from the village and surrounded by green pastures and well-tended fields. Animals happily grazed on the grass while the laughter of children filled the air even from afar.
It had taken Steve almost two months of them being in each other’s company again -two months of them working together, of them
“Steve, please…” Tony moaned again, Steve’s very own siren. Their eyes met and slowly, purposefully, Tony spread his legs apart in an irresistible invitation.
In time, their boyish friendship had turned to adolescent infatuation and then swiftly young, tender and passionate love. A love that was as strong as any feeling Tony had ever felt. A love that unfortunately was never meant to be.
Even though he couldn’t really be sure of it, Steve knew then and there that the light was coming from Tony’s room. Steve moved as if he was in a trance, his feet taking him to his destination without a conscious thought from his part.
Now, Steve had truly grieved his wife’s passing. She had been his faithful companion for years, and his closest confidant for even longer. But to this day, he still felt a deep shame for the fact that her death hadn’t left him in the same helpless agony that losing Tony had. Steve would never admit it out loud, but when Tony had first offered to become his lover, a terrible, dark part of himself had been glad he was a widower and thus avoided committing adultery when he - perhaps inevitably - accepted.
Maybe Tony finally realized how low he had fallen and regretted some of his life choices. He was sure Tony regretted refusing his marriage proposal, but it was too late now and Steve was a different man than who he'd been all those years ago.
He looked so earnest at that moment, with his guard momentarily down enough for Steve to see the vulnerability in his eyes.
So... Please let me know what you thought of the chapter. Your comments not only make my day, they add a huge deal to my motivation for writing.
“Will you slow down for a second!” Tony cried, holding the reins tighter while he struggled to catch up with Steve. He swore when he heard the other man laugh and urged his mare to go even faster, though he knew she was no match for Steve’s stallion.
In the end, Steve’s worry for Tony won and he swiftly took off behind him.
Of course, Steve had conveniently chosen to ignore the fact that he was guilty of the same impropriety where Tony was concerned. He found comfort in the knowledge Tony Stark was anything but helpless. For God’s sake, Tony had been the one to propose this whole thing to Steve! Steve knew enough of society to not be foolish enough to think that this was Tony’s first time using his body as a means to an end. In the right hands, trading in desire was a weapon more powerful than any other on market. It had brought down empires and built kingdoms.
It went on for a while, Tony feeling in all his senses the presence of Steve. On him, around him, inside him. At some point, he reached down to his own neglected cock stroking it to the rhythm of his and Steve’s lovemaking.
“Ah, a new face!” he exclaimed, offering a hand. “There’s only one person this could be. Welcome to our parish, Lord Rogers! I am Reverend Phil Coulson. I was wondering when we would have the honour of meeting the new owner of Stark Manor.”
Steve could see Tony’s mouth twitching in mirth, his gaze following her body with rapt interest. It was the final straw for Steve.
“I’m not saying you shouldn’t be with the man you love, Tony. Just, maybe keep some things for the wedding night,” he finished, squeezing Tony’s shoulder in a rare physical gesture of fatherly comfort.
you reading, there, my lord?” he asked, curious, before he could check himself.
Steve let down the notebook and got up, walking up to him. “I happen to like the plans for the pavilion, Tony,” he stated, coming head to head with him, gaze burning into Tony’s. “End of story.”
“Tony… what happened down there?” he asked, cautiously.
“And you said he has made progress?”
Perhaps…no. Tony shifted uncomfortably. Tiberius wouldn’t dare say anything against him, not after everything that had happened the last time Tony had met him. But still, could it be that, somehow, the unfortunate affair with Lord Stone had become public knowledge?
Jarvis had said years ago, when he had been there to tend to Tony’s broken pride and bruised skin after his night with a patron. Tony had learned the hard way to keep his priorities in check. A courtesan cannot afford love. He dealt in money and ambition, traded in moans and lust, sold his body for a promise that maybe, one day, he’d become something more.
“What a marvellously convenient way to enter, Lord Rogers,” the man noted finally, while his gaze remained focused on the fireplace. “It must have been very useful when you had dear Anthony living here, was it not?”
He carefully backed away and made a quick return to his own rooms.
, had seemed familiar. It didn’t take long for Steve to connect the mystery man that Tony was planning to meet at the inn with the man Bucky had told him about.
Tony was by no means a blushing maiden, but each night with Steve felt like being touched for the very first time. It was both agony and elation being able to hold Steve in his arms, to be allowed to shower him with the passion he had held for so long, even though he fully realized that while this meant the world to Tony it meant nothing to Steve.
It was unfortunately a tough task to manage. All through the evening, during what was to be a welcoming dinner held on the night of his arrival in his newly purchased home, Steve found his gaze wandering to the man who had previously owned it. The disgraced former Lord Stark. He'd caught himself cataloguing the details of his looks, the expression in his still handsome face, his out of fashion worn on the edges formal wear, his overeager smiles and loud personality, still desperately trying to be the centre of attention, even after all that had come to pass.
Not this time, though.
It was true that back in the woods he may have over-reacted, just a
“When you came to me in town,” he said, his voice hesitating as if unsure whether he was allowed to mention
And so, Steve let himself go.
, that came with losing someone in battle. Each time a soldier in Steve’s regiment fell to enemy fire, it was like losing Tony and his imagined life all over again.
Hey, guys, I'm back!
Tony was lost as to how he should reply to that. He knew that Jarvis had an almost inhuman ability to always be aware of what took place inside the manor, but, somehow rather stupidly, come to think of it, Tony hadn’t realised until that moment that that could include his and Steve’s secret relationship.
!” he exclaimed, eyes widening in realisation.
But, alas, it was not the case. As Steve himself had said that first night, this was just him taking what he’d paid for.
But still Tony was denying anything wrong had happened and Steve knew that it could only mean one thing. That he didn’t trust Steve, at least not enough to confide in him and seek his help.
This chapter also has sort of a soundtrack? As in I listened to this song on repeat while writing it.
He could hear the distant voices of his friends coming from outside, the sound of their banter and laughter easily climbing up the high walls of the manor, and Steve, envious of their carefree merriment, wished that he could join them.
It was in those rooms, and those rooms only, under the frailest candlelight and the cover of darkness, that Steve touched Tony as anything more than an acquaintance.
Steve’s eyes shot up, as if only then realising that Tony had left his previous spot to come closer to him.
a helpless romantic,” in a fond voice, his heart suddenly speeding up.
Bucky shot him a concerned glance before he continued. “There’s more that Fury isn’t telling us, that much I can tell you for certain. That man’s secrets have secrets.”
He left Stone’s room still yearning for a fight but knowing he needed to cool his temper off somehow. As awful as that interaction with Stone had been, he was certain Tony had had it much worse.
Lord Stone wasn’t laughing anymore. He looked stunned, as if not actually believing what had happened. It probably was the first time he had got what he deserved, Steve mused with a dark sense of satisfaction.
“Uhm,” Tony spluttered.
. It’s a pity, really. He
“If I may, sir,” Jarvis spoke as Tony moved to button up his vest. Jarvis seemed, for lack of a better word, reluctant when he addressed him, still holding the jacket Tony had picked in his hand.
Steve wasn’t the only churchgoer who had stayed behind, and the vicar was happily engaging in small talk with an elderly gentleman when he finally took notice of Steve. He moved to greet him eagerly.
And then Steve walks away, down the steps and off the stage, towards the Duke, leaving Tony to stare at his retreating back, regret and acceptance battling inside his tired, broken heart.
“Oh, he has an eye, alright. An eye for making profit out of his unsuspecting clientele, that is!” Tony shot back.
Steve didn’t want to let Tony go, but he was beginning to understand that perhaps he just might have to, for both their sakes.
He just needed to keep Tiberius Stone away from Tony Stark for just a few more days.
,” he said, rubbing his thumb over his index and middle finger, clearly indicating that motivation to be monetary payment. “You’ll find no judgement here…”
“Of what sir? Places you should expect to find me?” Tony drawled. Two could play at this game.
“You’re so quiet when we’re like this,” Steve whispered. They were lying in bed, Tony in Steve’s arms, exhausted from their vigorous lovemaking, the soft warmth of the comforter surrounding their sweaty, bare bodies. The candles had long gone out and Steve could barely make out Tony’s delicate features in the almost complete darkness. It made him bolder, braver. Made him almost forget where they were, how they’d gotten there.
When Steve entered the billiard room, he half-expected to find Lord Stone where he’d left him, but instead, the room was empty of any presence whatsoever.
“.. At the state of their holdings in comparison. Does this satisfy, my lord? My lord?”
He got no reply.
Tony’s heart dropped. How long had Steve been standing there? Could he possibly have heard what Tony said?
“Utopia,” Tony whispered, tone tired. Today had been a tiring day and lately, sleep hadn’t consciously been a part of his schedule.
“Ouch!” he gasped, rubbing at his left arm where Lady Natalia had just landed a rather forceful slap. She looked quite irritated with him.
“I thought you were informed of my whereabouts, my lord. Miss Potts had asked me to…”
Tony’s eyebrows went up at Steve’s suggestion, but, after a moment of silent contemplation, he nodded, though somewhat reluctantly.
Up close, Steve could see that the door had been left ajar in what, not many weeks ago, would have seemed a clear invitation. Before Steve found the courage to reach for the doorknob, he heard Tony’s familiar voice and it made him freeze in his tracks.
Tony gathered his book, intent to finish it up in his own rooms, when found himself once again the focus Barnes’ attention.
Bucky accepted it silently, seeming deep in thought. Steve had noticed him being uncharacteristically quiet as of late. He frowned. “Is something wrong, Bucky? I swear I haven’t seen you smile since we arrived here.”
“I thought so,” Stone said, after a moment, smugly.
They fell on the rug, with Tony under Steve, his legs parted obscenely, making room for the man. His eyes ran over that beloved face. Steve’s pupils were blown with lust, his mouth swollen from kissing and his usually neat hair was dishevelled. He took Tony’s hands in his own and in one move he was pinning Tony to the floor, arms held bent above his head and completely at Steve’s mercy.
Tony - in the arms of Tiberius Stone, had looked afraid. Steve was certain of that
“Damnation! Peter, get his leash, boy! Why are you just looking at it?” Tony cursed, gesturing wildly at the rope that hung from the beast’s collar.
“Tony, there’s something I’ve been meaning to tell you,” he began but was cut off by a determined Miss Potts strutting towards the pair of them.
“I’ve paid my whore,” Steve spits, still not turning to face him and now it’s poison that runs through Tony’s veins , not blood.
They ate in relative silence, with Jarvis and the servants around them at a polite distance. Tony couldn’t help but steal glances at Steve as he ate, observing the precise moves and impeccable manners, a stark contrast to what he had known of the man in the past.
stay away from him,” he repeated.
He and Stone were playing a dangerous game. But seeing the man somewhat subdued after their earlier confrontation cemented Steve’s earlier assumption that, despite him claiming otherwise, Lord Stone really did
This wasn’t part of the play, their show. This was Steve denouncing him, just like Tony did, the night before, at the balcony. Never had the intent behind one same action been more different. Where Tony was lying to protect him, Steve is striking out in a fit of anger, wanting to hurt Tony as much as he has hurt
Two days before the ball, almost everyone in the manor was busy with preparations. Steve wished that the entire affair would be done already. Every day was more insufferable than the previous one. He was tired of it all, and most of all, he was tired of keeping up the pretence that nothing was amiss between himself and Lord Stone, and even worse, between himself and Tony. In the past three days, he had spent less than a total of half an hour in Tony’s presence. It hurt him more than he would ever admit, but it was necessary if he wanted to keep Tony safe from Stone’s unwanted advances.
“Erm, yes, of course,” he replied curtly, annoyed with himself. All morning he had been distracted by the most maddening strip of bare skin peeking through Tony’s elaborately tied cravat, and he’d barely been able to concentrate enough to get minimal work done. Tony looked at him curiously but clearly opted not to pry further.
“This man is yours now,” Steve’s voice, rough - either from crying or shouting, Tony doesn’t know- cuts in him, deeper than any knife ever could. Steve’s adressing the crowd -the Duke, who’s sitting front row- and Tony wishes with all his might that this really was all just a play, a role Steve portrayed, that he didn’t mean it. But Tony has always been a realist. And he’s too close to the end now to be fooling himself with silly wishfull thinking.
“More, Steve…please…” Tony exclaimed, his whole body shivering. His hands clenched Steve’s arms, hard enough to leave bruises.
Rhodey would undoubtedly be furious with him for behaving so foolishly. Hell, he’d be
He swallowed Tony’s moans of pleasure hungrily, pushing and pulling at his body until he had him spread on the bed, naked, panting and entirely at Steve’s mercy.
Steve was still looking at Tony in silent contemplation. After a moment, he asked, softer.
He pressed on. “My point is this: don’t let Betsy or anyone else tell you what you should feel. And don’t
? This he was sure he hadn’t misread. Steve recognized true fear when he saw it. One couldn’t live the life of a soldier and not be intimately acquainted with it. And Tony
So, Tony hadn’t let his lack of money stop him from helping out the shelter, St Mary Magdalene’s, in any way he could.
As per usual.
“Yes, Jarvis, finally. I need to speak to you,” Steve exclaimed hastily.
Steve too had added more than once to Tony’s silent suffering. How many times had he scoffed at the man, had he spoken words aimed at hurting him, making Tony suffer like he had made Steve suffer?
I know, it's been a while. I have no excuse, and I apologize for making you all wait this long.
Seeing Tony up close, his cheeks flushed in embarrassment, rubbing his hurt behind with one hand, Steve couldn’t help himself any longer.
Steve turns to Tony again. His fists are clentched, nose flaring and his eyes, God… he looks so accusing, so
“I like Mr Gibbins,” Steve protested. “He did a wonderful job with Admiral Johnson’s summer house. He has an eye for aesthetics and symmetry.”
Tony couldn’t help but feel hopeful for what it could mean.
It was a sobering statement, and it made Steve wonder. He had never really known Lord Howard. Whatever he’d learned about the man had been from the things the other servants - or Tony, sometimes - said about him. But he had always believed Howard to be a fair man. Hard, but fair.
“Don’t look so startled, my lord. You need to be more careful. Young love is a wonderful thing, but think of how it would seem if people were talking about you two sleeping together. The awful things people might say, I dare not think of them! That you lie with him for his money, that he’s using you for your body, after first taking the last of your fortune,” Jarvis admonished, shaking his head in abject horror at the thought.
A warm thank you to my beta EachPeachPearPlum and my cheerleader AvengersNewB.
“Am I, though?” Bucky asked. “And here I thought we’ve promised to stand by each other ‘till the end of the line.”
“You’re tired,” Steve stated when he felt Tony’s head once more droop against his shoulder. He felt him shake his head, letting out a sound that Steve supposed was meant to be in protest.
“A ball?” Tony repeated, perplexed.
If Lord Stone was at all surprised to see Steve in his rooms, he certainly didn’t show it.
Steve’s thoughts were already drifting to the latest letter he’d gotten from one of his associates when something Hogan mentioned caught his interest. “I’m sorry, would you repeat that?” he asked.
Barnes seemed to catch the change of tone. He cleared his throat. “Yes… well. The Age of Reason seems like a fine choice,” he said, closing the matter.
There had been a time when Steve would have promised the world to Tony in order to have this. A time when having Tony’s hand in marriage would mean making him the happiest man alive, not a laughing stock.
As soon as the rest of his company got wind of it, both Miss Carter and Lady Natalia wished to visit the place. In the end, it was decided that both the ladies and Mrs Dugan would accompany Lord Rogers on his visit, along with Bucky and Mister Banner. They even had to hire a second carriage in order for everyone to be comfortable enough for the duration of the ride.
a great fuck, as I’m sure you know very wel-”
Steve closed his eyes, willing the headache this inner turmoil had brought away. His mind drifted, thinking of better, happier times.
He sucked hard, moved his tongue around, exploring the veins on the side of Steve’s cock then drew back, bringing the tip of the cock almost to his lips and then swallowed it once more to the hilt. He buried his nose in Steve’s soft pubic hair, feeling divinely dirty, revelling in it. He couldn't stop this for the life of him.
No. This time, Steve recognised that he had behaved far from honourably.
“Splendid, yes. Oh, and Jarvis. If you please… I would like to inform Mr Stark of this myself,” he finished, looking at the old butler expectantly.
“I swear, you are begging for a beating,” Tony breathed out angrily and made to finally get the dog’s leash. As he moved, he failed to notice some of the fallen debris on the floor.
Outside was indeed infinitely better, Steve mused as he walked, satisfied. The fresh breeze was already lifting his sullen mood, nature doing its best to fill his senses with the sweet scents of flowers, the gentle rustling of trees and the warmth of sunbeams caressing his skin. It was a good enough distraction from the unending temptation that Tony in closed spaces -and even shorter distances- presented.
Then Steve shoves him, only once, but hard enough for Tony to fall clumsily on his hands and knees. The ache barely registers. Somewhere near him he hears gasps, a crowd shocked. Tony had almost forgotten they had an audience, that they were supposed to be in a play. This doesn’t feel real.
Suddenly feeling spontaneous, he turned to the room again. “That’s enough work for now, Stark,” he said, finding Tony looking at him, bewildered.
It had been an almost intimate scene. As if he’d caught two lovers just on the brink of a passionate kiss. In that moment, it dawned on Steve that not only was his fear that Tony and Lord Stone were old lovers most likely true, it was entirely possible they had once more rekindled their romance.
“Tony… you don't understand. He’s so much different from what I had made him to be in my mind. I think… Buck, this Tony, the one I’ve got to know these few months, he would never do that to me. He’s changed.”
“True. Let us see…” he looked around, his eyes landing on some of his favourites hoarded in a pile on a nearby sofa. He picked a couple up, offering them to the other man.
Steve was already there, waiting for him, and the meal had all but been served.
Steve found no reprieve from his troubling thoughts when he got back to the Manor.
“Still not a lord, but yes, that’ll do nicely, thank you, Jarvis,” Tony replied, amused.
Considering the life he has led so far, Tony thought he's learned all there was about agony and pain. But nothing could have ever prepared him for this. To hear those degrading words, that title Tony has longed to leave behind for all his adult life, coming out of the mouth that not that long ago was vowing eternal love to him between sweet, stolen kisses… This was a special kind of hell, one made just for Tony Stark.
They panted, breathing into each other’s mouths as they came down from the ecstasy of their intense coupling.
“To your left, Mr Stark!” Peter yelled as the dog let out a mournful howl and jumped over one of the occasional tables, knocking down a porcelain vase.
together- before he finally called Tony by his name again.
After all, Steve had to carry out a task of his own.
“My lord! Back just in time to help us settle the matter once and for all. We’re finally ready to finish the lobby restorations! Now, I told Smith here you’d be perfectly satisfied with oak flooring, but he insists on showing you the mahogany samples he told you about last week,” Tony grinned, greeting him jovially.
He was still reeling from the conversation he had with Barnes and the implications behind it when he realized the time had come for his nightly duties. He’d skipped dinner, feigning a headache, but didn’t expect Steve to be fooled by the feeble excuse for long. So, he got dressed down to his nightshirt and carefully prepped himself, just like he’d been doing every night since the first one.
“Oh you know exactly what I mean,” Bucky said evenly, eyes never leaving Steve’s face.
The faint sound of a bell tolling could be heard from the direction of the nearest village. It was noon then, Steve surmised. He looked back towards the other side of the river, where the elegant silhouette of Stark Manor could be seen at a distance. They should start heading back if they wanted to make it there by lunch.
The atmosphere during dinner was strange, to say the least. Steve tried to keep up with his duties as a host and act jovial, while his heart and mind were still in turmoil. Predictably, Lord Stone was uncharacteristically reserved tonight, a fact that hadn’t gone unobserved by Miss Hill and the Carruthers, who kept shooting curious glances at both him and Steve himself. Thankfully, Sharon and Mrs Dugan were happy to chatter away like they had done every evening, and thus kept at least some semblance of normalcy.
“Right...” Tony said, looking like he wanted to add more, but held himself back.
Steve found his mood darkening rather quickly.
For the first time since this had all began, Steve took his time preparing Tony, amazed at how erotic the act was proving to be for him.
Tony lifted a hand, cursing at it for shacking, and reverently touched the inside of Steve’s thighs. Steve was hot as fire under his fingertips. Carefully he grazed over Steve’s shaft, finding it already hard. He caressed the member over fabric and then tugged it out, mouth-watering at the sight, the proof of Steve’s desire of him. He closed his lips around the swollen head, hearing Steve’s startled cry above him. He rejoiced at tasting the bitter drops on his tongue before he swallowed deeper, hungry for more. Steve moaned, a sinful sound that had Tony struggling to look up to him once again. He was rewarded with the glorious sight of Steve looking down at him in wonder, eyes wide and mouth open in a silent o. What a spectacle they must present at that moment.
“Fury was adamant that Stark took the fall for crimes he did not commit, or even have knowledge of. It was a set-up. Only it was discovered too late. The damage to the Stark Company and to Lord Stark’s reputation couldn’t be undone, and Obadiah Stane and his associates had long disappeared without a trace,” Bucky said, shaking his head. They were in one of the smaller parlours, one of the most secluded places Steve had found in the manor. Tea had been served not long ago, and Steve had given specific instructions not to be disturbed.
Perhaps the fear of a scandal and of losing a beneficial match with a powerful family would be enough to convince Stone to keep his hands away from Tony.
His thoughts screamed ‘I get to have this,
Steve was on fire. He was lost in the taste of him, the smell of him, the smooth feeling of his skin, the small curves of his lower back, the light tremble of his breath. Somehow they ended up on the bed with Steve on top of him. He spared a moment to let himself admire Tony’s unfocused eyes and swollen mouth before he latched himself to Tony again, kissing and biting his way down Tony’s neck to his chest and navel. The wild thing in him roared with pleasure.
❤️❤️❤️
“Go feed them, you daft boy,” Tony shooed. The boy grinned back while picking up the youngest of the dogs. “Yes, Mr Stark! My lord,” he finished, bowing clumsily to Steve before walking away with the rest of his pack.
Steve couldn’t help the pang of disappointment at having this rare, if brief, moment alone with Tony come to an end.
, in front of the audience, the Duke and, oh God
“Mr Stark…” He said, looking at Tony, speculating.
to write something down, his lashes fluttering as he spilled himself inside Tony.
Anyway, enough of me rambling. On to the angst! (and porn... 😉)
“I would say well met, Mr Coulson, but, as I am sure you are well aware, this is far from our first meeting,” Steve responded, taking Coulson’s hand in a firm handshake.
The housekeeper, Miss Potts, was another example. No one could doubt her fondness for Tony if they caught the two of them bantering as they were prone to do. At first, Steve had been afraid Tony had been overly familiar with his teasing tone, that somehow he had been more involved with the young lady than was proper, her being a woman beautiful enough to rival even Lady Natalia in looks and manners. Very soon, though, he had realised their relationship was more akin to that of siblings than lovers.
“I thought you were unwell,” he stated, no accusation behind the words. He was unguarded maybe for the first time since this tumultuous affair of theirs had started, Tony realized.
It was a rather chilly evening and, while Tony was leaning on Steve’s desk, finishing with the lord’s paperwork, Steve had spent it seated on an armchair by the freshly lit fireplace, sketching idly in a notebook.
During Steve’s days on the war front, there were times, more than he cared to admit, that almost drove him to his limit.
Had he ever let anything slip about what had happened in his life these last few years? Well…
, with a man that he once thought he would spend the rest of his life with, it was becoming almost too much. He felt as if he had lost sense of his true self.
Thank you for reading!
After the service had finished, Steve lingered in order to meet with Mr Coulson, as he had originally intended.
Steve hesitated. “Yes... he mentioned something of the sort. He also told me he had made a few donations?”
To his credit, the boy, Peter, looked sheepish before he rushed to gather the offending animals up. Tony regarded the boy fondly, a rare true smile on his face. Something inside Steve panged at the sight.
It had been one of the many gifts Tony had given him, though perhaps the only one Steve had accepted, because it hadn’t been overly lush, or too expensive, but rather plain-looking, like most others. It had been a game of theirs, Steve refusing Tony’s extravagant gifts, usually clothes, simply because he could never be seen in them, while Tony insisted he accept them.
Steve’s throat closed up. Unable to resist, he slowly moved his hands up and down to gently caress at Tony’s side. His cock bravely stirred once again, pressing close to the heat of Tony’s body.
“What you do to me,” Steve whispered in his mouth. He nipped at Tony’s neck, while both of them struggled at each other’s clothes, searching for skin.
, disappearing but a week before all that fuss with the company started! Poor master Tony was fed to the wolves while Stane’s name was barely mentioned at all. Vultures…” he finished angrily.
He blinks when crumbled pieces of paper hit his face. Money, he notes, numbly. Though there was no real force behind it,  he still ends up reeling as if he’d been slapped.
“Yes, quite. I
He had almost forgotten about it, after having to deal with making the arrangements for the railway company’s executives to visit the estate, while making sure not to let anyone else know about them up to the last possible minute.
-, with a proposal Steve had ultimately found himself too weak to resist.
He had studiously ignored the sorrow that filled his heart at the news of his oldest friend being so deeply in trouble.
“I’ve known you all your life, my dear boy. I know you have strong feelings for him.”
“Must you leave already?” Tony whined, but Steve could already hear the lady’s light footsteps coming closer to the door.
?” he said, tone hurt and angry all at once. “Why are
Steve spent the entire ride back to the Manor in deep contemplation, greatly troubled by what he had just overheard.
The people who loved him, who cared for him, Jarvis, Pepper, Rhodey, they all knew who Tony really was. That was all that mattered where his reputation was concerned.
“I’m surprised…” Steve remarked, breaking the silence. “I seem to recall you were a better rider than me back then, Mr Stark,” he said, smirking.
“Oh, yes, my lord! Well, it’s only that he departed so suddenly that he left many of his belongings back in the house! After some time the master said we could take whatever we wanted. I got my finest shirt that day!” he exclaimed proudly. “I never trusted the man, I tell ya. How
It seemed that being threatened with exposure finally got through Stone’s thick skin enough for him to abandon his tea and finally stand up to face Steve directly for the first time that evening.
Everyone in his staff was a
Could it all be acting? Steve doubted that. Even Tony wasn’t as good an actor as to keep up the pretence at all times.
Tony turned in Steve’s arms in response, bringing his head up to answer Steve’s call with a tired, sloppy kiss. Steve took a deep breath through his nose, loving the gift of Tony’s enticing scent.
It was vastly different to the ancestral property of the Starks, which had ultimately become the grounds for his father’s weapons factory. Tony had only been there twice in his entire life. A land much further south, barren and grey, where the only thing growing was industry. Now, of course, it belonged to someone else.
Sooner than he’d anticipated, Tony felt Steve pick up his pace, losing rhythm as he moved faster and faster towards bliss. Then he faltered, a muffled “
On the story, I debated a bit about if it should stay only in Steve's POV but I honestly tend to write multiple POVs so... not sure if that will be the case with this story, but this chapter is written from Tony's POV.
At night, Tony would cling to Steve tightly, would tremble with passion in his arms and it was getting harder and harder for Steve to convince himself that the look in Tony’s eyes was only lust.
“My dear, Lord Rogers already showed us such generous hospitality, you should know better than to press him for such a thing…” Dugan tutted disapprovingly at his wife’s antics. “Please forgive her, my friend. You’ve provided so much for us already, there is no need for such frivolities.”
He had made his decision based on bitterness and anger, expecting to meet only the shallow man that he had convinced himself Tony had been all along, only to be met by a worn but still kind-hearted version of the Tony he remembered.
, but, in his defence, Tony had deliberately been a nuisance.
“Well, your army days are behind you, so you should at least take pride in your accomplishments, Steve. You’ve certainly saved this place from ruin, I’d say. It’s time you did something for yourself, my fellow. Relax a little. Have fun!”
How he had come to regret that.
Finally, Steve heard the familiar thump of a door closing.
No, it was something Tony arranged in secret, a meeting away from the house, - in an inn, of all places - with a man of whom the mere mention apparently made Tony bloom with happiness. He recalled something Tony said specifically:
“I must say, this place is very well kept, Mr Coulson,” he commented, noting the water well with interest. Its pulley system looked unlike anything Steve had ever seen before. He remembered Tony had said something about working around this place, and, under closer inspection, Steve recognized Tony’s unique touch.
This chapter was betaed by the wonderful EachPeachPearPlum, whom I thank from the bottom of my heart for her infinite patience with me.
The dog barked happily, quite possibly taking the entire show as a rather entertaining game. It stopped, as if finally satisfied to stay where it was. All around it lay pools of mud and broken pieces of porcelain.
Tony probably thought that Steve wouldn’t believe him, even if he dared to bring forth accusations against Lord Stone. Between Tony’s bad reputation, his company’s infamy, and his fallen status as a peer, the deck was definitely stacked in Lord Stone’s favor when it came to public opinion.
“You did agree to this,” Steve found himself saying, hating that it came out rough and on edge. He should not be affected so by this. This was just, it was right, it was what was agreed. It was just another aspect of their business deal, nothing more.
Steve wanted more.
(See the end of the chapter for
“It’s not his fault, my lord! My aunt May always says I’m too distracting!” Peter spluttered, hurrying to get to his work.
“This is what I paid for,” he reminded them both.
The one positive aspect of Steve’s insatiable desire of Tony’s body, was that each passing night it was getting easier for him to prepare himself for Steve’s use. His muscles had relaxed and his hole stretched wider every time. Tony had felt a burning shame the first time he’d realised it.
Yes, Tony had turned down Steve cruelly before, it was true, but that didn’t excuse Steve behaving so vengefully, not after so many years and most decidedly not under these circumstances.
Back in the safety of his rooms, Steve took the box out once again and regarded it, deep in thought, mindful of anyone -mainly Tony himself- coming in and seeing him holding it.
Steve couldn’t take the praise for this accomplishment without reflecting on his shameful behaviour, since both had the same ulterior motive.
“They have, my lord, and I’ve arranged warm baths for all of them. Peter is tending to the horses, all is well,” came the swift reply from the elderly butler and Steve nodded, gesturing at Jarvis to return to his task.
This behaviour... it wasn’t at all like him.
It was as if something was forming in his subconscious, something that he couldn’t yet see, but was there all the same. And now, this. Just what was the relationship between Tony and this Mr Rhodes?
Later that day, after they finished with Mr Smith’s surprisingly large collection of flooring samples, Jarvis served the both of them tea in one of the reading rooms. Making small talk, Tony asked Steve what news he’d brought from the village. After Steve mentioned Mr Coulson’s shelter for single mothers, he was once more surprised when he was met with Tony’s approving exclamations of gratitude.
“Just one of the ways Mr Stark has helped around here,” Mr Coulson said.

Tony Stark had spent half his life being in love with Steve Rogers. They’ve known each other since childhood. Steve’s mother had been a maid of the Starks before her untimely death. Left as an orphan,  Steve had soon been taken in by the family and given work at the stables. Before long, Steve had managed to be placed in charge of Lord Stark’s favourite stallions and mares, all due to his diligent nature and patient persistence. Tony, despite being the Lord’s only son and heir, had been allowed to spend time with him, seeing as he didn’t have anyone else near his age in the neighbourhood for him to play with. Of course, they’d been inseparable. Those long lazy summers in the countryside would always be counted amongst the happiest days of Tony’s life. What sorrow filled his heart every time he departed for the Town House where the Starks spent their winters and had to be parted from his dearest friend. What joy blossomed when he was returned to him.
He ignored Tony’s leaking cock, which was achingly hard and begging for some relief, even gently slapping away Tony’s hands when they tried to wrap around it.
Tony whined, unable to move, desperate in his failing attempt to rub himself against Steve. They were still almost fully clothed, except for Tony’s shirt which had been opened up at the top to grant Steve more access to Tony’s neck, and Tony’s cock ached in the confines of his breeches. He could feel that Steve was as affected as him, but was clearly set on taking his time to come to their mutual completion.
