“Don’t care, walking is quicker,” Sherlock replies, despite the fact that they’ve ended up against the connecting door fumbling with each other’s shirts and not much closer at all to their original goal.
John. They’ve switched places during the night. Now Sherlock is the one curled around John’s back, nose in his hair, a hand on his belly. He, too, is awake, judging by his breathing. John wiggles his hips, just so, and Sherlock gasps, eyes flying open.
“Until you know how things will pan out, there’s no way of knowing if you’ll be able to live with it,” Clara says.
“I believe this is where we let you out,” Mycroft says.
John can’t help but kiss him for that. “What gave me away?” he asks between kisses, now working his way along Sherlock's jawline.
“John,” Sherlock says, leaning against the door for support, “if you keep looking at me like that I’ll never make it to the shower.”
John carefully schools his expression to show only weary acceptance. “Yeah. Bye, Greg.” He closes the door.
told me that they were married to their work.”
“I’d offer you tea, but I don’t think your current taste buds would appreciate it,” John says.
So he will be clean. He’ll find a flat, something in central London, well located to get to any crime scene. He will let, no,
The basement, through an empty doorway at the bottom of the stairs, is dark. No, not just dark, pitch black. It’s unlikely there’s anyone here. He listens carefully, to confirm his suspicions, then heads back up the stairs and out the building.
John nudges him back towards the cottage. Have they really been out that long already? Sherlock hasn’t noticed the time passing quite so quickly. He decides that his unscientific experiment was a success. They run back to the cottage through the pouring rain and shake off once inside, spraying water droplets everywhere. John is pleased with him, he can feel it, and he likes it. It’s not quite as good as John’s praise, but it’s still a good feeling. John is his packmate, his praise-giver, his protection, as well as someone to protect.
“No, not exactly.”
It seems like John has made more progress by himself.
“What were you thinking?” he asks. “That pneumonia would be fun?”
It isn’t the first time John has said his name. Sherlock lifts his head and rolls onto his belly. He’d been dozing, daydreaming about running in open fields with John.
“Is this the piece you were composing?”
He considers. He feels much more settled with his wolf now.
“Yes,” Sherlock breathes. “But you just want to comfort me. You’re not gay.”
Sherlock drags him closer to the hives to tell him all about bees, how they live, how they make honey, and all sorts of other interesting facts. His rambling talk keeps them going as they continue to make their way through the trees and come up against the fence on the other side that marks the back perimeter of the cottage’s land. On their way back down the hill Sherlock tells John about the language of bees, their communicative dances, complex yet simple, sharing the direction and distance of pollen sources. He runs out of steam once they reach the cottage. John finds himself in the kitchen making sandwiches for their lunch with many fresh ideas of what to buy Sherlock for his birthday and Christmas.
“I… Refusing to do anything about what?”
John is more than happy to comply. Sherlock is, of course, a very quick learner, and already he’s mapped out all of the sensitive spots on John's neck and chest. He seems to also have set himself the challenge of covering each and every one of these sensitive spots with a lovebite. Soon, John is peppered.
“I don’t doubt that, but I’m reasonably sure you were outnumbered.”
Clever John. Sherlock is pleased.
Sherlock frowns.
“I’ve been experimenting with leaving my mind palace door ajar. Under careful watch.”
The kettle boils and clicks off. Sherlock stays standing in the doorway for a moment longer.
“I looked at the map,” John says, as he puts money and the cottage keys and his phone into a rucksack. “We can take the coast path and it’ll get us almost all the way into town.”
“I thought you said he wouldn’t be bothering you for another month,” John says, when Mycroft is gone.
The paramedic clears his throat. “Gentlemen, if you’re quite done, I can check you over and let you go home.”
“Agreed.”
, Sherlock realises he's been waiting for him.
“This will hurt, but don’t resist it,” John tells him.
There’s a long pause, long enough that John thinks he won’t get an answer, then, “Mm no. Too thlow.”
“It’s just light reflecting into your eyes in certain ways.”
It’s late, but it doesn’t feel like it’s late enough for the sort of sordid deal they’re striking. The cold and damp soak through Sherlock’s trousers, loose and ragged at the cuffs, as he kneels in the alleyway. He’d like to think that the wetness permeating the fabric is just rain water, but in this area of London he knows better. Can smell it, in fact, the nauseating mix of piss and vomit and other bodily fluids, making him feel sick, making his job that much more difficult. His gag reflex is having a hard time of it as it is.
Cautiously, he places a hand on Sherlock’s back. To his relief, Sherlock doesn’t react violently, and he gets to keep his fingers.
He blows onto Sherlock’s hands and keeps rubbing them. “Will you be okay with changing tonight?”
“When I retire that’s what I’ll do. I’ll keep bees and study them. And you can grow flowers for them, and we’ll do experiments on the effects of different kinds of flowers on the taste of honey.”
“Morning,” John says cheerily. “Just.”
“I’m not sleepy,” Sherlock insists, with a pout.
“You’re allowed to laugh,” John says, kissing that spot again.
Sherlock feels uneasy, like he always does upon changing back. He has memories coursing through his mind seen through a different scope, largely sense-based, strange and incongruent to his human perspective. But John’s praise helps.
When he returns, stripping off layers of clothes as he moves towards the bed, Sherlock is already curled up, facing the door. John slides into bed in his pants and curls around Sherlock’s back. It feels familiar, comforting. They did this before, at the cottage. He wraps an arm around Sherlock’s waist and Sherlock lets out a deep sigh.
Mycroft is an irritating buzz in Sherlock’s head. How many hours has Sherlock been in bed now? How many hours has he been sleeping? If he can’t go home soon — very soon — something is going to get broken. Probably Mycroft’s nose.
Sherlock smiles, a real, proper, rare Sherlock smile. He’s always pleased when John figures out his compositions.
John knows. He smiles. “I’ll get you a flannel.”
Sherlock nuzzles at John’s hair, soothes him.
“Big storm tonight. You’ll probably be hard hit out in the open there. It’s coming in from the sea.”
“Fine,” Sherlock huffs. “Now stop being so serious and get back up here to kiss me.”
“Did you make any decisions?” she asks.
His brain comes back online to their harsh panting, the soft whimpers that escape him as John slows his strokes. His arms feel too heavy to move, but he still wraps them around John’s back, and they both lie there, solid and heavy, catching their breath.
John leaves the bedroom and stalks through to the living room, where their uninvited guest is now sitting. Sherlock quietens and pads softly through the kitchen after him. He won’t reveal himself yet.
He follows the trail, nose to ground, to the end of the alley, and comes up against a gated chain link fence. One corner is turned up. John wriggles through and into a barren warehouse that leads through to a quiet back street. He waits for a van to pass, then follows the oil trail down the street. They’d stuck to back streets, private roads, keeping out of the public eye. It’s a twisting route, but it leads out of the city. Now he’s in a depot, vehicles lined up silently for the night. There the trail stops.
Sherlock feels a hand on his back and turns, stumbles slightly on four legs he’s not used to, and the wolf mind is in control.
“Go away and make him come back.”
“You ought to change at least once a month, at the full moon,” John says. “More regularly, if possible, but I haven’t read about anyone who tried to change less often. The first change is the hardest because you’ve never done it before, but every change after that gets easier and easier.”
John, his packmate. He pushes between John and his attacker, snarling. John’s yelp of pain echoes in his ears. Two against three. John is a good fighter, but he’s been injured. The tension rises again, the wait for the first pounce, but it’s not fun like it had been between him and John.
, but these wolves have hurt his packmate, and he wants them to hurt too. John swipes a paw at him — just hard enough to sting. John is bleeding. He wants to run. He can’t leave John alone. John takes off running and he follows. It’s over in seconds.
He’s right. They’re not very deep, and are already starting to heal at the edges.
John’s reply is a giggle.
“You’re exhausted. You haven’t slept since… Wednesday night. It is Friday, isn’t it? Or is it Saturday now?” Sherlock cranes his head to peer at the clock. “Anyway. You’re too tired to, uh, continue previous activities, which is perfect, because I am too. Which isn’t to say that I don’t want to continue them. I would. Don’t take this as—”
Soon the room is dark. Sherlock has pulled off his suit jacket and thrown it to the floor. John carefully hangs it over the back of his chair and then sits on the bed beside him, leaning back against the headboard. Sherlock rolls so that his head is resting in John’s lap — just like a few days before — and makes himself as comfy as he can.
Things are not better. Or they are, but they aren’t. They arrive at Baker Street with the dusk, in the early evening, and go up to the flat to find Mycroft waiting for them, looking as pompous as ever and as if he has every right to be there. Sherlock scowls at him and goes straight through to his bedroom with his things. He hears Mycroft congratulate John on evading him. He hears John saying it was easy. This will come around to the topic of Weres shortly. Maybe his presence will be necessary. Reluctantly he leaves his room.
He makes himself toast, but hardly registers eating it. Then he visits his mind palace to go over John’s letter. All the evidence says that he should accept his wolf. John is more of an expert in this field than Sherlock had thought, and he is also the only person Sherlock trusts to interpret that expertise in his own situation.
“The usual?” he asks, waving the menu at Sherlock.
I have a couple of little one-shots written and ready to post soon: a super fluffy piece and a PWP :)
John takes a delaying sip of his takeaway tea and grimaces at the quality.
As John predicts, the pattering of a light rain on the roof starts as soon as he sends the text. For the moment it’s just heavy drizzle, so he doesn’t worry about Sherlock getting too wet. He lights a fire so they can get Sherlock’s heavy woollen coat drying once he’s back. It still takes a good fifteen minutes for Sherlock to return.
He is so tied up in his thoughts that he doesn’t notice the piece of paper that’s been slipped under the door until he makes his way to the kitchen for a cup of tea. When he does see it, he stares at it, then stares at it some more, his sleep-deprived brain perplexed for a moment by how it even got there. Then he gets the gut feeling that this piece of paper is important, and abandons all thoughts of tea to pick it up.
Sherlock groans. “That’s a few days too many.”
He’s usually very careful not to think about Sherlock like this. There are so many reasons why it wouldn’t work, so many ways it could go wrong. He’d rather die than live without the friendship they have now. He almost did, before he met Sherlock. He doesn’t want to jeopardise it. Better not to think about it.
John grins and leans back to examine the mark he’s sucked on Sherlock's neck.
, and now they’re going to…
“Yeah,” John says. “It was about a week and a half after the full moon. I didn’t know that until later, though. It was an ambush. I can’t think why; territorial instinct, maybe, or they’d been bought out by the insurgents. But we were attacked. They had it planned. The wolves came at us, and then in the confusion we were shot at. Picked off.”
Ah. There. Now Sherlock — human Sherlock — has control of his wolf and it’s time to turn back. He looks up at John. It’s funny seeing him from this angle, from below. As if Sherlock were on his knees.
“On her way to the vet’s. A cat, or maybe a small dog, not hers. She’s not carrying it with much care; it’s an animal she’s not particularly fond of — maybe her boyfriend’s or her parents’. She’s been roped into the task.”
“What’s it like, John?”
They step out. For a moment they just stand, side by side. A gentle breeze ruffles their fur. Interesting smells tickle their noses. The smoke of a faraway bonfire, carried by the wind. The salty scent of the sea. Moisture in the air. The sweet breath of the grass.
Except.
Sherlock lifts up slightly and slides back down with a small throaty noise. John's hands slide up his thighs, knees to hips, and grip there. He doesn’t try to control (when could he ever control Sherlock?), he lets Sherlock set the pace, follow through with his intention to drive John crazy.
John’s typing stops as he realises Sherlock is watching him. He looks up and smiles softly. He never used to be so soft, so unguarded. Sherlock loves it. He can’t help but stare, even now. John looks away first. Sherlock glances at the time. Gone 11pm. He stands.
University is a welcome relief. He lives alone, so can spend all his free time with Nyx, and attends few lectures, having learnt most of it already by himself. He and Nyx go out walking and he quickly earns his reputation as the tall, cold-looking one with the terrifying dog. He buys a collar for Nyx, for appearance’s sake, but she just laughs at him and asks when they started caring about appearances.
Not long after the doctor leaves them, a person whom Sherlock is sure is in Mycroft’s employ appears at the door. He lets Lestrade deal with them and sections off a tiny part of his brain to hope that Mycroft doesn't turn up himself. He’s given himself up to illogical hopes and wishes and can’t find the space within to care about it.
John obliges him, sliding down over his cock again. After a few brushes of his prostate he is rocking onto John’s finger. “More,” he moans.
Together they walk into the water. John jumps around and splashes. There’s more sand underneath the water which doesn’t seem fair to Sherlock. He snaps at a moving bit of water. It’s salty, yuck. He tries to lick it away and ends up more salty. John jumps too close to him and soaks him. Sherlock leaps on him in retaliation. Now they’re both soaked. Much better.
“I see,” John says. It’s clear that music and violin playing are both deeply personal to Sherlock, a way for him to express his emotions. Sherlock playing is always the most emotional John has ever seen him.
“No one would be able to replace me without you realising instantly,” Sherlock scoffs. “I don’t have an identical twin, and you know me and my mannerisms better than anyone.”
“Take it from someone who knows, Sherlock does not need strange, unfamiliar people who don’t know him during his change. He needs what he knows. You being constantly on his back about this is helping absolutely nothing, so if you really want what’s best for him you will fuck the fuck off and let me handle it.”
“Give in,” John whispers with a smile. His hand drifts up Sherlock’s back to stroke gently through his hair.
“I told you,” he says.
“You sound like one of my girlfriends,” John replies.
Sherlock nods, mouth already busy on John’s neck, seeking out his sensitive spots. He manhandles John closer, kisses up his neck, along his jaw. John rolls them so that Sherlock is underneath him and Sherlock automatically spreads his legs. John kisses him deeply, trailing one hand over his chest, fingers rubbing at his nipples, then drifting lower. God, he could kiss John all day long. Future experiment, perhaps. He wants to crawl inside John’s mouth, be consumed by him even as he consumes John. But for now he settles for sliding his tongue into John’s mouth.
But John had a bad first change. That’s the very least he’s deduced. John is just trying to make Sherlock’s experience better than his own was.
“Was that a yes? If it’s someone we know then why are you— Oh.”
Sherlock thinks he understands why. He realised a long time ago that Nyx is his soul. He’s never understood these people talking about their souls on the inside, with their hearts, when his is so obviously on the outside. And now he realises that he and Nyx are in even deeper than he thought they were; he realises that his soul speaks to John.
John sighs. Sherlock can be absurdly stubborn, but John can see where he’s coming from. Sadly, he doesn’t have an empirical way to convince Sherlock that accepting his wolf is the best thing for him.
“And whose fault is that?” replies John.
The room is dark; no daylight filters through the closed curtains.
He ducks his head to suck a sharp mark onto Sherlock’s neck and that does it. Sherlock tips over the edge into his orgasm and his mind goes deliciously blank with the pleasure of it. Distantly he feels himself arching up, clinging onto John, then feels the wetness bloom on his belly as John’s come joins his own.
“I don’t know. I think he might have been upset.” He slumps in his armchair. “Look, how do we know he hasn’t just gone into hiding for a few days? Maybe he needs some time alone.”
“Text Lestrade,” John replies. “I’m sure he could use your help on something. Or check your emails. Last I saw there were over five hundred in your inbox.”
“John?” Sherlock stops his manic rush of energy and looks over at John, standing still and shocked.
And then it’s the first night of the change. John has warned him to allow his wolf more control, that his instincts will prove more important in London than at a cottage in the middle of nowhere. Sherlock will do his best to heed his advice, but he finds the skill of relinquishing control a tough one to master.
It’s everything all at once. Both Nyx and Sherlock instantly relax, and John too. It feels so intimate, it feels so vulnerable. It isn’t repulsion or disgust. It feels so good. Sherlock smiles, and Nyx’s eyes shine like they haven’t for years. They both know: never again will they experience the pain of boarding school or the lows of university. Now it isn’t just Sherlock and Nyx, struggling along together. Now it’s Sherlock and Nyx and John.
“My wolf had complete control. I could only watch. It was hurt and confused, but mostly angry. It ripped apart the bedsheets and destroyed the room, wasted all the supplies in there. A nurse somehow got me locked in, thank God. I’m sure that if she hadn’t, I would’ve gone on a rampage. They called in some tranquilisers, shot me down.
Sherlock wakes suddenly with a gasp. He knows.
“Stop thinking about my sexual history,” Sherlock says, staring up at John. “I assure you it’s varied enough to have a grasp on what to do.”
“Try to look less like a soldier charging into battle, would you?” Mycroft says. “You’re shockingly conspicuous.”
The wind rattles the windows. Sherlock shuts the door and slips into bed with him. Another flash of lightning lights up John’s face. He’s looking at Sherlock, sleep-rumpled, hair sticking up. The storm didn’t disturb him — he is adept at sleeping through loud noises when he needs to — which means he was woken when Sherlock opened the door.
, human Sherlock supplies.
“Bruises. Nothing you can treat.”
“Of course,” John agrees. “You’re the genius.”
His human side prompts him that he needs to treat Sherlock carefully. His wolf doesn’t care about careful; he just needs his packmate to not be sad. He moves over to Sherlock and leans down to nudge him with his nose. No response. He hardly flicks an ear. He whines at Sherlock,
Sherlock is shaking, eyes crazed, when John reaches him and lights are turned on them.
“I can’t believe… We are on the same page, aren’t we? You want this?”
They settle into an easy, undulating rhythm. Sherlock can feel it building inside him, coiling in his belly, making his legs tingle. He needs to hear John moan again, needs to make him feel good. He licks a stripe up John’s neck, tastes the tang of dried sweat there, kisses and sucks on his sensitive spot. John shivers. Sherlock can feel John’s balls drawing up. He’s close too.
His wolf is yipping for his attention. What does it want? Oh, of course. The moon. His wolf knows exactly where the moon is. He tries to ask it, to engage with it, but that doesn’t work. His wolf can instinctively
Sherlock’s laugh morphs into a groan as John’s hand curls around his cock. God, with pleasuring John he’d barely realised how hard he was. His hands drift, skating down John’s spine and ghosting over the curve of his arse, bumping up rib after rib and trailing along collarbones. He wants to touch everywhere. John’s hand is making it very hard to think.
“Mmn.” Sherlock comes back to centre and waggles the lube at him. “I’ve been practising.”
What? John said something and he missed it. Sherlock processes the audio memory.
Growling. Yellow eyes. Had there been a dog? Thomas Finchley didn’t own a dog. But, ah! The throbbing pain on his side is a bite. He remembers being bitten. But where did the dog come from?
“I’m getting breakfast. Want some?”
Sherlock is silent. Those are facts; he can’t dispute them.
“We’re going under the radar?” Sherlock asks.
. If wishes could come true, he’d be the one on that dance floor in John’s arms. It doesn’t take a great stretch of imagination. He knows how it feels to be waltzed by John. It feels warm and safe and heart breaking.
“Good morning,” John says.
“There are two ways someone can be a Were,” he says. “One is if both parents are Weres, and the other is if you get bitten by a Were. So yes, you are. But I’ll help you through it.”
“Fine, fine. I’m going.”
Although tonight the benefits aren’t outweighing the inconveniences. Not at the moment. Sherlock is cold, and his coat is damp, which isn’t helping, but he’s tied up, so he can’t remove it. Breathing is a little painful. Each inhale brings to mind the kicks he received to his ribs when the men he was looking for surprised him by finding him first. Predator becoming prey. In the privacy of his own head, he admits that he was an idiot. He should’ve taken John with him; the man really is fast becoming invaluable to Sherlock. Perhaps that should be worrying. Or perhaps it’s just a good way to avoid a beating and being tied up in a cold, damp basement.
. A few more deep, relaxed breaths and Sherlock is fast asleep, the stubborn fight gone from him. John isn’t tired, certainly not as tired as Sherlock, but the only way he’d move now is if the bed spontaneously burst into flames. And if that happened he’d scoop up his sleeping love and carry him to the safety of another bed where they could be quietly together.
“My wolf won’t stop whining.”
He lets John make his escape. He’ll understand eventually. Sherlock’s just glad he doesn’t regret last night.
“Too right I am. How are your hands?”
Sherlock chuckles and kisses him again. His hand still works slowly on John’s cock. “Do you ever think about anything but sex?” he asks against John’s lips.
do this.
“Your comparisons are heavy-handed, John.”
Sherlock grumbles and jabs at the second phone to get it to connect. John swear colourfully at a driver who cuts him up.
Sherlock looks from their joined hands up at him, confusion evident. “John?”
John clears his throat, looking away from Sherlock’s nakedness. “Yeah, uh. Good night, Sherlock. Or, good morning, I guess.”
Of course not. Never,
Sherlock is so responsive. John had no idea that he’d react like this to all the touching and attention. He’s arching up against John, keeping their bodies pressed together as much as physically possible. It honestly makes John feel a bit heady. He has the power to make Sherlock like this, and he thinks (hopes) that Sherlock wouldn’t let go like this for anyone else. Just how much of this has he done before anyway?
“I’ll shoot him. Then you’ll know! Then you’ll know my— my pain, and then I’ll kill you too.”
“There,” he points. “Behind and below that cliff.”
“A pleasure doin’ business with you,” the man leers, and then laughs, doing up his jeans.
Sherlock nods. John is watching.
Sherlock is staring through the darkness at him, visibly trying to figure him out.
“This will help,” John says. He hopes so, anyway.
“What?” Is this some obscure pop culture reference he’s missed?
“Be my guest,” Sherlock says, eyes darkening as he watches John slip further down his body.
Sherlock’s been an idiot.
Lestrade nods, but doesn’t seem convinced.
“It takes all sorts, John.”
“I still don’t want a wolf in my mind palace,” he says.
John goes to buy some candles after that, just in case the storm knocks the power out. The way the owner said ‘you and your friend’ had implied more. John is well used to that tone of voice being employed when it comes to him and Sherlock. He just lets it wash over him now. He’s stopped insisting that he’s not gay — people will assume what they want to anyway. He knows that he and Sherlock only bring it upon themselves. They’re inseparable; they live together, work together, spend their free time together. John knows married couples who spend less time around each other. It’s no wonder everyone assumes they’re a couple. He doesn’t think about how things would be if they were right. Sherlock is married to his work, so it’s an impossibility.
He drapes an arm over Sherlock's waist, mirroring Sherlock’s hold on John, and his other hand comes up to fist in the soft fabric of Sherlock's t-shirt.
“Little bee. Yeth. I like beeth.”
Human and wolf side consult and John decides that no, actually, he won’t change back just yet. He paces across the room to curl up by the embers of the fire.
But this time there will be no escape. Detective Inspector Lestrade has promised that Sherlock can help on cases. Real, genuine, interesting puzzles, something for his brain to gnaw on that isn’t itself. The only condition is that he has to be clean.
“Shit!” John curses, and runs to the kitchen.
“You’re irresistible,” John says. “I’ve wanted you for so long.”
Sherlock’s eyes flicker open. “I changed it back.”
And there’s the pout that comes when the puppy dog eyes don’t work quickly enough. Honestly, it’s like dealing with a four-year-old. Sometimes John just doesn’t have the patience to engage in a battle of wills against Sherlock.
He switches off the phone and puts it back in its hiding place. He’ll wait them out for a while, and hope that the agents watching the Baker Street flat lower their guard a little with time.
John is silent. So far, so easy. Now for the hard part.
Sometime before the first hour is up he realises the last time John spoke to him was during the chase. Their last communication was when John had grinned at him and shouted, "I'll get him!" then sped off ahead. It had all gone wrong. John hadn't spoken to him since he was injured, he hadn't brokenly said it hurt. He had just winced and started dimming.
It comes out croaky and hoarse thanks to his inner battle against the puppy dog eyes. But it makes Sherlock's pleading face drop and be replaced with a wide-eyed look of… something else. It’s gone within a second though, before John can place it.
John moves his slicked-up fingers down, down, and circles them around Sherlock's hole. Sherlock shudders, eyes dropping closed.
“I’ll see you in your wolf form eventually, John.”
“No.”
Sherlock needs to hear this. He doesn’t think that Sherlock has ever really had someone around to help him.
where the moon was via your wolf.”
“Go for a run. Mindless activity can keep your wolf calm.”
surprising was the strength of John’s reaction. Of course John would oppose the idea; as Sherlock’s doctor, he’s perfectly qualified to care for him, and he knows how much Sherlock would hate being locked up in a centre like that.
“Sherlock?” John calls out. He knows Sherlock wouldn’t wait as told. “Your choice.”
There it is! He’s not sure how he did it, but he slipped inside his wolf’s skin, just briefly, and now he knows.
When John’s noise reaches a certain pitch, takes on a certain note of begging, Sherlock removes hand and mouth from his cock. He glances up at John, smiles, then rubs his cheek up John’s cock like a cat. His barely-there evening stubble scratches lightly against John’s sensitive skin.
Sherlock shoots him a death glare that John doesn’t fully appreciate because he’s looking at the road. “I’m not a dog.”
Sherlock shrugs. “It’s growing on me. I want to experience this.”
“God, I wish I hadn’t.” John’s voice is breathy. “We could have had so much more sex by now.”
“John,” he says brokenly, as John pulls up to Sherlock’s fingernails, then slides his mouth back down. Their hips work together, slowly rubbing their cocks against each other.
“I need you,” Sherlock says. The ache is only getting stronger. “I want you inside of me.”
Sherlock gives up with a huff and sprawls his front half over John’s lap. Then he decides that’s not good enough and rolls onto his back, legs in the air.
“That might be preferable to being kidnapped by your brother and thrown in a
Fingers slide into his hair, clipped-short fingernails scrape against his scalp. Not tugging, not yet. But even so it makes all Sherlock’s nerves light up at once, like a whole road of street lamps flicking on when dusk approaches. He can hear the noises, grunts and soft whines, that he’s making in the back of his throat, and he knows that John likes them too. He would never imagine faking, but sometimes he lets his control go just a touch more, and John’s reaction to
John is pleased that his changes are coming with more ease now. That can only be a good sign. John changes after him and together they pace out of the door.
“Maybe it would,” Sherlock concedes. “But what it mostly wants is to go out.”
“Here now,” Sherlock states, as if that’s a whole argument in itself.
Sherlock looks like he’s about to argue the point.
John is not tense but warm and half sleepy and pliable under his arm and Sherlock wonders when he developed this infuriating inability to end his sentences.
“No. I won’t. I won’t!”
Sherlock levers himself up from John’s lap. John gets up before his lap feels too empty.
Too much vulnerability, for both of them. Time to move away from it.
Sherlock just turns his head on the pillow and gives John a look that says he knows exactly how much of a dick John can be. He’d be offended if it weren’t true.
Sherlock opens eyes he doesn’t remember closing. He lowers his violin and bow, looks to John and blinks in surprise. In the light of the fire John’s eyes are wet and glistening.
“I won’t miss next time!” the man shouts. He’s losing it. “I’ll kill you — both of you. You deserve to suffer after what you did to my pack!”
John is leaving the clinic a few days later when an anonymous black car pulls up beside him. Mycroft really needs to leave them alone. John has deleted more emails about this stupid centre than he can count. He ignores the car and keeps walking. He can feel his mood beginning to sink and just wants to be at home with Sherlock already. The car idles alongside him. John wonders whether he can get away with walking all the way home or whether they’ll bundle him into the car and take him hostage.
“Yep,” John replies. “I imagine that since you’re so much more observant than most people anyway it’ll be more obvious to you.”
Sherlock smiles a little private smile and tries out a few more notes.
“I want to taste more of you.”
“John,” Sherlock groans.
John pauses behind a concrete pillar. The sound of the radio is coming from the next room, but he can’t hear anything else. In one quick move he spins off the pillar and into the room, gun raised. Empty. Just some builders who forgot to turn their radio off. He heads back outside.
Sherlock’s head snaps up. “John! You are a genius!”
“Dr. Watson.”
“Are you hurt anywhere else?”
He wonders what it’ll be like to be in wolf form. John hasn’t said anything about it. Will he be in control? Or will it be the wolf in control? But he
“I’m fine,” Sherlock says, surprised to find himself a little breathless. “Just… Touch me, please.”
“Okay, close your eyes,” John says.
“How?” Thunder rumbles.
“Did I wear you out?” John asks softly.
John laughs. “Don’t hear that one often.” He rests a hand on Sherlock’s thigh. “Come on, love. Move.”
, his body says. Sherlock takes a step forwards, but does nothing else.
We’ll see about that,
Sherlock eats quietly, distracting himself with one of the journals. He doesn’t scoff at it like he usually does, which either means that it’s a very, very good article, or that Sherlock isn’t feeling at all himself. As much as John would like to think it’s the former, he knows it’s the latter. He knows just how much becoming a Were — especially the first real change — can fuck with your sense of self.
“I want to drive you mad with need,” Sherlock replies. “I want to see your face when you finally get release.”
Long minutes later then break apart to breathe, hips still slowly pushing against each other. Pleasure is coiling low and slow in John’s belly.
John quickly kneels next to the sofa. “Sherlock?”
“I’m sure you could.”
His torturer doesn’t know it, but his strikes are in time with the strikes of the church clock. Now that he has started counting he can’t stop.
Sherlock is tight and warm around his fingers. John can feel his internal muscles shifting and moving as he rolls his hips. And God, he has his fingers
Sherlock feels his cheeks heat. He licked John’s face. Which was probably not good. Does it matter to John that they were in wolf form?
John doesn’t ask what he means. This is the one bit they haven’t talked about in detail.
“John,” he gasps, and John leans down to kiss him deeply, messily.
“No.” He shoulders his bag.
“Yes, I’m tired of it too,” he says. This is what he’s been reduced to. He’s talking to himself, but not even the human side of himself.
“When we get home we’ll close the curtains in your room and make it nice and dark, okay? And if you want I’ll stroke your hair for you.”
He’s not as fit as he used to be perhaps, but Sherlock runs him around London often enough, so scooping six foot of lanky drama-queen-toddler up off the floor isn’t
Bacon, eggs and toast as a first course. He once didn’t have enough food in after a change and suffered all the way to the nearest café. But that was before he met Sherlock, of course. Things were harder then.
John is dressed for bed; he was only waiting up for Sherlock. He settles himself under the covers, facing out towards the room as he always does. Sherlock moves to sit at John’s desk. The only light in the room comes from the open skylight. John closes his eyes, then opens them to look at Sherlock, then closes them again. Sherlock feels his wolf calm as John calms. Why must his wolf be so in sync with these sticky emotions?
And there we have it. My eternal love and thanks to everyone who has read along, kudos'ed, commented - your support and compliments have meant so much to me!! And of course, again thanks to Emily for beta'ing, this story was drastically improved because of it!
Did John hear noise upstairs? He needs to see Sherlock, see if he heard it too, just
Eventually John pulls away. The room has darkened with the setting sun, now lit only by the orange flicker of the fire. Sherlock reaches out to brush the edges of John’s hair, glowing golden. John smiles and turns his head to kiss his hand.
and his
Mycroft tries to interrupt, but John talks right over him.
“You’re too far away,” Sherlock complains. “Come back to bed.”
Sherlock nods and stretches up to kiss John again. He’s almost certain that he knows what John wants to tell him. John sits on the floor and leans back against the sofa, addressing the room, but not Sherlock directly. Sherlock rolls onto his side. This way he can see the side of John’s face, can reach out to touch him.
“No,” Sherlock replies. “I want to go down to the cove too.”
Back inside, Sherlock picks up his clothes in his mouth and goes straight upstairs. John listens to him changing back into his human form. There are a few tense moments, sharp breaths, then Sherlock comes back downstairs, human and in pyjamas. He’s surprised to see John still in his wolf form.
Sherlock sees John begin to panic and decides distraction is necessary. “John, you’re injured.”
Patiently, he waits for John to fall asleep, then closes the skylight and tiptoes downstairs, but not to his room. He’s no longer tired after napping in the hideout, and if John wakes up to find Sherlock missing he’ll panic. He picks up his violin and begins to play.
“Come on, Sherlock.”
“Longer legs,” Sherlock quips. “But your situation was worse. Shot, invalided, in London, alone. Mine was alright. I had you.”
Oh, God, when did he fall in love with Sherlock Holmes?
They collect their tickets. Then John leads them over to another ticket window, where he buys tickets that will take them just outside London. This time he pays in cash. Sherlock understands now.
John, wonderful John, surprises him once again and does better than expected. Without moving his finger too much, he slides down Sherlock’s body, settles himself between his legs, and slides his lips down over Sherlock’s cock. Sherlock shudders as John starts sucking him slowly. Soon his hips are moving minutely, working John’s finger deeper with each movement. John’s mouth around his cock is a hot, wet thing of beauty, just the perfect amount of pressure, setting his nerves on fire. When John’s finger is in deep and Sherlock is moaning he twists it, probing, searching for—
John takes a gulp of his awful tea. “I took an interest in it at med school,” he says. “Did a lot of reading. Had some experience of it in Afghanistan too.”
You’re faster than me,
“One could argue that, following his recent attack, Sherlock is now an infant in some aspects of his life.”
“Other than the fact that I’m not leaving Baker Street? No.”
“I thought I’d be stopping you from destroying the furniture,” John says.
“You did well,” John says, as they quickly dress. The night is chilly. “That was good.”
. And now Sherlock is stripping.
Running through the woods is a new challenge. There are logs to jump, branches to dodge. Sodden leaves slip under his paws. They stop when they reach the fence. John slips under and sniffs carefully at the ground. Then he turns and leads Sherlock back the way they came. It smells too much of other humans over there. The human side of Sherlock’s brain realises that it must be the coast path.
Sherlock narrows his eyes, pulls an exaggerated face as he considers. “I’ll make you a deal,” he says.
John must see the way his thoughts are going.
“The change itself. How is it?”
John’s hand twists and Sherlock’s back arches and hips thrust up.
, just for one drag. This is what he has been reduced to.
“I want to stay close,” he says, hoping that will explain it.
And then ofc a dramatic climax with BAMF John for your enjoyment!
“Less talking, more listening. Mycroft’s men just attempted to catch me, probably to whisk me off to that centre, but I’m safe now. I’m not sure when I’ll be able to come home. They’re probably watching the flat. You know what to do, yes?”
Sherlock is pleased. It’s so simple to distract John with his wellbeing. He knows this fact and uses it, but doesn’t think too deeply about it. He tries not to make sticky emotions his area.
Suddenly Sherlock’s face drops. “They’re empty. I could bring the bees back.”
“Ah, I see,” says John, then, “Myc?” His amusement is audible.
“Come on, Sherlock. Time to change back.”
“I look forward to hearing the completed version.”
“Sherlock? You alright?”
“No, I’m not an addict.” John smiles and takes a sip. “Not to drink anyway.”
. Sherlock still doesn’t react. John keeps licking him, grooming him, petting him. He can feel his mood gradually improving.
John’s eyes flicker open, then half close again at the brightness of the light. Now Sherlock feels like jumping up and leaping around, singing, ridiculously out of character, but jubilantly happy. Lestrade steps out to make a phone call. John says his name.
“We saw the clouds at lunch,” John says.
“Woah, slow down,” John laughs.
Trembling, Sherlock comes over to push himself against John’s side.
He spends the day working on a blog post for a case from months ago that still hasn’t been written up. He’s in two minds about whether to write up the Finchley case. He’d have to gloss over a lot of things towards the end: Finchley being a Were, Sherlock getting bitten, John shooting Finchley.
Sherlock makes a muffled, desperate sound.
“You always play it at nighttime, when I’m already in bed.”
“Lube?” he asks.
“I didn’t say you were scared,” John says. “I said you don’t like them.”
“I can’t walk to the bathroom. My foot will
“I love you more than I thought was possible before.”
Sherlock didn’t let him have his fun tonight. John considers leaving to run by himself, properly, but his human steps in and stops that thought.
John leans in very slowly, his eyes flicking from Sherlock’s eyes to his lips and then back to his eyes, always checking. Sherlock knows exactly what’s about to happen, but at the same time, he doesn't have a clue.
“Sherlock,” he calls out, “are you okay?”
Sherlock stands, spins around to argue his point and immediately staggers.
“Idiot,” John says, too breathless to be insulting. “No, the swearing.”
John is bringing in their bags. “Let’s go into town and get some food.”
“John!” Sherlock hisses. John’s fingers have gone still in his hair. He lifts himself up from John’s lap and shakes his shoulder. The blanket slips down to his waist.
John follows after him. “That’s because you’re excited for tomorrow.”
“Of course you didn’t mean to get attacked and injured,” Sherlock replies.
Sherlock can’t help it then. He reaches out and rests a hand on John’s shoulder, grounds him in the here and now, in Baker Street. Alive. If John had died out in Afghanistan, Sherlock would never have met him. He can’t imagine a life without John now.
. They’ve reached them. This is the limit of their friendship. John, so naive, doesn’t realise yet. It’s as good as over. Just like Mrs. Hudson warned him. Sherlock imagines life without John: Baker Street always empty, emptier than it is now. Cases alone are boring, nowhere near as fun as with John. The hard ones are nowhere near as easy to crack without John there as his conductor of light. No more popping round. No more chases and takeaways and excitement. This is it. It’s time to go.
John steps forwards to him. Nudges him up. Licks his jaw.
He hasn’t been able to feel his hands for several hours now. He was keeping track of how long, until a hot brand applied to his back made him pass out and lose count. He thinks he’s cracked their favourite order of torture. They like to prove him wrong, though, psychopaths that they are. If he’s right, it’ll be the whip next.
“What splinter?” John asks, causing Sherlock to splutter in outrage before he realises that John is teasing and flushes a deeper shade of pink. John smirks and pointedly doesn’t think about other ways he could make Sherlock that pretty shade of pink.
Sherlock looks at him as if he’s got two heads. “But we only just got up.”
John is perplexed, having been wrapped up in his book for the past hour. Was Sherlock having a mental conversation without him again? But once he manages to think back to the conversation they were having before the silence fell, he realises what Sherlock meant. He smiles and pulls out his brick phone to text Sherlock.
) It is almost more painful than the whipping.
“How can you just sit there?” Sherlock finally snaps at John.
He pulls away from him then, allowing Sherlock to gather his scattered thoughts a little. Mostly he just wants John. Badly. He needs to feel more of John. He pulls his pyjama top off. John returns to the curve of Sherlock’s body, warming lube in his hand.
“Right, okay. Um.” It
“Except I didn’t protect you. We ran away.”
John smiles. Their meals arrive and John gestures at Sherlock’s. “Look, you have your own chips. You don’t have to nick mine.”
John bites his lip. He trusts Lestrade’s instinct. He’s seen how many times he’s been right about a gut feeling.
“You’ll keep your fingers. Not sure about your toes though.”
“I’m sorry, Sherlock. I wish there was an easier way to explain it.”
Then John looks over his shoulder at him. "If we're going to share a bed, you might as well make it worthwhile."
“I never cheat,” Sherlock says grandly.
John sighs. But maybe London is what Sherlock needs to accept his new normality. He’s had a rough time ever since he got bitten; no wonder he wants some familiarity and routine.
. Sherlock’s wolf copies the growl. His human side finds John growling very… interesting. The three wolves appear unconcerned. John steps forward, in front of Sherlock, rises up, makes himself look bigger.
Through the darkness he can see two men silhouetted against the light. They’re sitting at a fold-out table, making it hard for John to assess their size and strength. He edges closer to the wall, away from the pool of light. There’s a rustling noise farther off, beyond the table. A third man sitting apart has just turned a page of newspaper. Beyond him, barely perceptible in the darkness, huddled against a wall, Sherlock’s unmistakable silhouette. John’s on the wrong side, damn it!
Sherlock spends an evening trawling the internet for information about the Were packs of London, but finds nothing except people loudly proclaiming that they saw a wolf.
Chapter 13 was lovely, but only short, so here is some more loveliness in a quick update.
Sherlock shuts the door in his face.
He stands up. Mycroft is, shockingly, silent. After a few seconds of staring him down, John leaves, banging the door behind him.
Sherlock curls closer over John with a moan, fingers scraping against his chest. John can see the sheen of a light sweat spreading over him, can see the flush reddening his cheeks and chest, can see his full cock bobbing as he rides John slowly. Fuck.
“I’m ready,” he says.
Sherlock carries the tea through and sits down opposite John. “What did he want?”
“You might be surprised,” John says. “You’ll naturally take a back seat and let the wolf do its thing, but if it tries anything you don’t like, you can take over. You have the final say. But it can be fun just letting your wolf take off to do what it likes.”
John can see that these techniques are getting them nowhere without Sherlock’s genius for connecting the details. Even Mycroft’s power won’t help things progress any quicker. It seems like they’ll just have to wait for the kidnappers to reveal their hand or slip up. Unless…
Sherlock downs his painkillers.
Mycroft’s people move in then, surrounding them while John wraps Sherlock in his own coat. The only thing left to do now is take him to hospital.
Sherlock’s stomach growls and he looks at it, as if confused. John laughs and throws Sherlock’s clothes at him (as nice as he is without them) and heads to the kitchen to get breakfast going.
Mycroft would have run a background check on John when he came into Sherlock’s life. John’s attack must have already happened, in Afghanistan, or possibly very shortly after he arrived in London. He wasn’t born this way. Mycroft said that some people become suicidal once changed. Now that Sherlock knows what he knows, Mycroft’s look and John’s anger speak volumes. It may be better not to bring up John’s attack. Too many messy emotions.
“Sorry,” John whispers. “Is it a migraine?”
Three days after John broke Sherlock out of the clinic and took him home, the prescription painkillers have finally made progress on Sherlock’s headache. They’re able to go to Scotland Yard and give Lestrade their statements on the Finchley case. John appreciates that absolutely no mention is made of his gun (thanks to Mycroft, probably). He doesn’t fail to notice the new way Lestrade looks at Sherlock when Sherlock has his back turned, but thankfully he doesn’t say anything. Sherlock doesn’t need sympathy, just support.
“Wha’?”
“Okay, Marco. I’m John. I know how you feel. I’ve lost friends too.” Calm down, please calm down.
“That guy’s a druggie?” John asks. “Doesn’t look it.”
No. Sherlock told him the men he was looking for were dangerous, and John can’t stand the idea of Sherlock in danger for some reason, a fact that Sherlock regularly exploits. He gets saved, John gets his danger and excitement. It’s win-win, really.
Sherlock seems put out over breakfast. John wonders if it’s because he woke up alone, or if it’s because they’re back to normal life now and there are no cases. He can’t seem to process the idea that Sherlock
There are a few seconds of silence from Mycroft. John feels his blood boiling. The silence stretches just slightly too long.
“Ah,” John pants. “I’ll remember that one.”
“You never make tea,” John says distractedly.
John wakes softly in the morning, rising with the sun as it spills through the bedroom window. A quick glance into the other bedroom reveals Sherlock asleep at last, sprawled out over his pillow, shoved beneath him lengthways. John pads downstairs to make himself breakfast. Sherlock won’t be up for a few hours yet.
“Am I a Were now?” Sherlock asks. He only trusts John with this question. He would never have asked Mycroft.
John kisses him with all the sweetness and slow ooze of honey. “I love you too,” he says, when they part. “Sleep well, Sherlock.”
“John.” Sherlock tugs on his hand, pulling John in until they’re forehead to forehead. “You said… you said ‘I don’t want what you want’, but then you kissed me. I don’t understand.”
Barefoot, he paces across the cold concrete and through the doorway into the basement. He doesn’t know if these men are armed. Presumably they are, but they could also change into wolf form at any point. A bite won’t affect him beyond the pain, now, but it’s not something he needs. His gun is at the ready. He moves towards the light at the end of the large rectangular basement.
Sherlock is nervous, apprehensive, but not scared. John is promising to help him.
Sherlock drinks without answering. How alright he is depends on what happened, and he can’t remember that.
“I don’t think I’ve ever seen them before, but there’s something…” He grapples with the sensation of presque vu for a few more moments, but fails to grasp at it. With a sigh of frustration he hands the tablet back to Mycroft. “And the vehicle?” he asks. “Have you traced it?”
His packmate is lying on the floor, head between paws. He’s sad. But that’s not right, he shouldn’t be sad. They’re a pack. They’re going to run and hunt and enjoy the night.
He nods, making John giggle as his damp curls tickle him.
Hands steady, gun raised. John’s bullet slices through the third man’s newspaper. They all jump in surprise. Sherlock stirs and makes a muffled, groggy sound. Then the men are on their feet, at least two guns out, all shouting at once. Under the cover of their noise John dashes away from where he was standing, away from Sherlock. He doesn’t want to put him in the line of fire.
Enough. He gets out of bed. It’s cold; the residual heat from the fire has seeped away already. He doesn’t know where he’s going until he finds himself opening John’s door. The hinges squeal.
Sherlock has longer legs. He catches up quickly, leaps at John. They tumble over each other, tussle. John pins Sherlock. When he’s clearly won, he releases him. Sherlock gets up and shakes himself, the satisfaction of the race and the fight running through him, electric.
“He all but collapsed a mere week ago. I think he is far from fine.”
“I’m not an idiot, John.” Sherlock is trembling ever so slightly.
My chapter summary notes for this chapter were: 'just tooth-rotting fluffy sex'. Enjoy.
John looks uncomfortable at the reminder of last night.
This is a prime example of Sherlock's drama queen behaviour.
John looks at the note he wrote yesterday morning, still on the kitchen table. “Sort of. Not really argued. I think some things… changed.”
Sherlock nods, then winces. “Get me something for my head. Please.” Pleases make John more amenable.
“Yeah,” John says. His eyes are closed.
He doesn’t bother replying. He’s not a very careful person.
“Yes, but how did I do that?”
“A diversion,” he says.
A van pulls up to the depot. John glances at the timestamp: about right, allowing for their roundabout route. Two hooded men get out the cab of the van, go around to the back and open the doors. A subdued-looking Sherlock is led out by a third hooded man. These are definitely the same men. John has the same feeling that he recognises
Just the epilogue to go after this chapter :)
“I’ll make the tea then,” he says.
“I thought you’d want the sofa to sprawl out on,” John says, sitting at one end.
Sherlock just grumbles and sulks.
They don’t stop until they reach the gap in the railings. There’s no one — wolf or human — here. Outside the park is a world of caution before they can get home, but here, for the moment, is safe. John has blood on his face. He steps in to look more closely, then gently, carefully, licks the blood away, runs his tongue over the cuts, caring and healing. John leans against him for just a moment, energy spent.
(Sometimes he plans his escape anyway, just to give his mind something to do.)
Sherlock either doesn’t want to reply, or doesn’t have the energy to manage it.
John groans. “Sherlock, would you just touch me already?”
“Johnnn.”
Sherlock’s face is open and honest. “I want to hold you and kiss you. I want to finish what we started in the shower and I want that every day. I don’t want us to be just friends.”
John is no help. He needs to search deeper in his mind palace.
“Many concert level musicians do the same.”
“John, John.” Sherlock pushes at John's shoulder urgently and John slides off him again.
“Come here,” he says when John is finished.
“You are still human. You’re a human in wolf form. Not biologically a wolf. Just a human in a different shape.”
“I have a case for you,” he says. “Double murder. Lestrade couldn’t be more stuck. But you have to eat something before I tell you any more.”
Yes. Sherlock wants John to feel just as good as he does. He runs his hand down John’s stomach until it bumps against John’s dick, standing upright against his belly, straining towards Sherlock’s touch. Sherlock wraps his left hand around John’s cock, a little awkwardly. There’s a bead of moisture at the tip and Sherlock runs his thumb around the head of John’s cock, slides the wetness around. John moans and squeezes his thighs tighter around Sherlock’s dick.
Sherlock isn’t always a whirlwind. He will quite contentedly spend long hours monitoring a slow-progressing experiment. Sometimes he lies on the sofa and his brain doesn’t seem to be a hive of activity like it is when he’s visiting his mind palace. John thinks that very few people have ever seen him quiet and patient like this. John is a rare someone who is privileged to.
“Mmm,” Sherlock replies, sleepy and low.
John raises his gun in its direction. “Let him go or you will regret it,” he says, voice steely. “I will hunt you down and kill you and every person you care about.”
touch.
He looks peaceful. That’s how Sherlock had been feeling when he’d fallen asleep last night. Sherlock gently lays his fingers over John’s and John shifts a little, making a sleepy noise which instantly goes into his mind palace, though he’s not sure why. He wonders what time it is, tries to judge it without moving by looking at the angles of light in the room, but he doesn’t know the room or the area well enough. He doesn’t want to move to find a clock. Right here, this moment, is where he wants to stay. For as long as possible.
“Itchy? Sore? Any redness?”
“John,” Sherlock interrupts.
“How easy do you find it to change back now? Be honest.”
God. As soon as Sherlock is back John is going to sort that situation out. They can’t carry on in this awkward middle ground indefinitely. He will shower Sherlock with all the love he wants to give him, and Sherlock can give back exactly as much or as little as he likes. That will work, surely?
They go out into the field in front of the cottage, far enough that they feel out in the open, surrounded only by the complete darkness.
“I’m fine, John.”
“I want to tell you something,” John says. “It’s not easy, so please don’t interrupt me.”
centre.” Sherlock hears the condescension on ‘specialist’. John is angry. Very angry.
John grins. “Come on then.”
It was… good of John to realise that the beginning of the piece was the cottage. He’s less sure he’d write it the same way, now, after all that happened there. Maybe he should take the cottage theme and subvert it, and finish the piece that way. Or maybe he shouldn’t finish it at all. He doesn’t want things to stay in this state. Not the way his changes are, and not the way things are between John and himself. They’re an almost-something, but John blocked that path, and they can’t be what they were before. Which makes them what, now? Nothing? Sherlock is not very good at figuring out relationships which aren’t clear-cut. That had been the problem with Victor.
Carefully John works in a second finger alongside his first. He’s used to the stretch now, welcomes it, wants to feel John filling him up. Two fingers become three, then suddenly Sherlock has to tug on John’s hair, pull him off his cock.
(See the end of the chapter for
John will come to rescue him. It will take less than an hour, by Sherlock’s estimate. And when he arrives and unties him, Sherlock will treat him exactly the same as always.
“Me neither,” says Sherlock, then grabs his coat and leaves the cottage, swirling his coat on as he goes.
With his now clean hands he takes the one of John's which lies closest to him. John is unconscious so he doesn't waste time with words. His fingers lightly ghost over the nicks on John's hand from the knife, the grazes from where he fell on the concrete and the cuts on his knuckles that make Sherlock feel oddly proud. Then too soon his moment of almost-peace is over as the ambulance arrives at the hospital and the paramedics hand John over to the doctors, who wheel him straight into surgery.
“Once this is over he won’t care until the next full moon. We need to get back to London. To cases. Normality.”
Why would there be a wolf in London? “So I’m here for the bite. Tetanus?”
“Just because last night went well doesn’t mean you can lower your guard tonight,” John warns him in the shed.
“Making sure all is well with my dear brother.”
“Yeah, well you woke me up, it was the middle of the night, you were scared—”
John likes it. Sherlock whines at him. John is amused at him again. He snorts and runs away. Sherlock lifts one leg, then another, tries to shake the gritty stuff off his paws. John calls to him, a short yip, then another. The smell of salt is very strong down here. He hears water.
“I saw that, Sherlock. It’s not okay to contemplate attacking your brother, especially when he’s the British government.”
“That’s not where that goes,” John says without looking up.
John swallows around him and gently pulls off, his strong hands holding Sherlock up against the wall.
“What else is injured besides your neck?” he asks.
“What—?”
Sherlock considers this. “I take it your first change wasn’t a good experience.”
, but his eyes can’t adjust to utter blackness. How the fuck is he going to get Sherlock out of this unharmed?
John is waking up. He watches as his face gradually awakens, loses its sleepy laxness. Then his eyes open. Their blue goes perfectly with the sea and the sky and the walls. John blinks a few times, then smiles. He can almost hear John’s brain whirring into action.
Come back, you idiot. It’ll start raining soon.
Sherlock nods a little absently. His wolf is starting to perk up again. He takes all the necessary cares with his violin and bow and gently puts them away.
“Do you want to go out?”
It's the beginning of the end, and it's time to make good on all those sex and fluff tags! (with just a teeny bit of angst to answer some questions)
a Were. Until I put a bullet through his brain because he attacked you.”
I promise you that, mentally, I am the same person I was before I was bitten. My wolf has changed me physically, just like yours has changed you. You’ll notice more stamina, you’ll be more sensitive to smells. Mentally, you’ll become more observant when you accept your wolf. You’ve felt it happening already. You’ll recognise other Weres instinctively. You’ll be more in tune with emotions, yours and others’.
John takes him to a large, open plain of grass. Here they can relax their guard a little; anyone approaching them will be easily seen. Sherlock wags his tail. His wolf (and he himself) is pleased that John has brought them somewhere that they can play. John sees his excitement and offers him the wolfish version of a grin. This will be much better than prowling cautiously through dark alleys.
Wolf John doesn’t care. He’s getting sick of trying to tease Sherlock away from his human’s control. He nudges Sherlock back to the cottage. They didn’t get far, anyway.
Synthetic, sterile clothing, cleaning fluids that can remove blood. Sherlock has met some of the men who do Mycroft’s heavier legwork. He has no desire to meet them again.
He dislikes having to eat so much for a few days each month, but at this point he’s so hungry that his stomach is hard to ignore. John slides him a plate of toast.
Sherlock hates asking what happened to him almost as much as he hates people repeating themselves. He’ll work it out himself.
“And the night after?”
. He closes his eyes.
“John.”
John starts leading them back towards the clinic. “I think you might be underestimating it,” he says. “But let’s stay optimistic for the time being.”
Some physical exertion is in store, then. Sherlock packs sports clothes and trainers (originally from his boxing days, now kept for disguises). His violin is permitted, but John refuses to allow him his laptop. Their phones will be left behind too.
