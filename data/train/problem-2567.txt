Okay, yeah, no. Dean felt a blush fight its way onto his face and he was glad he probably already looked flushed from the sex. In a way he wanted to accept the offer but also no. Not so much because Dean minded people looking at his hole after or during sex, plenty of men had done that before, but because the act seemed intimate to him and he shouldn’t get too comfortable with someone who was just a prostitute, right?
Castiel whimpers and shifts, allows for space enough so that Dean can pull his dick out of his jeans. He does so with a deep groan and Castiel feels his own orgasm rushing through him when he shifts back and Dean’s hot, hard dick presses against his side. In contrast, Castiel’s own heated skin seems chilly, and he chases the heat by rubbing against Dean.
The man nodded. “Seeing as you got to know me in my true form, I don’t blame you. Would it make you more comfortable if I changed back?”
“I’ve grown up with her as… As an aunt,” Dean clears his throat, almost as if to get a bad taste out of his mouth. “She’s not related to my mom but they went to high school together with Ellen and they’ve been friends since forever and… That would be like asking me if I wanna bang
Cas didn’t say anything more and when he later came down, smelling amazing and wearing the shirt Dean liked the best, he smiled when he saw the sandwiches Dean had made for him.
“No, baby, none of that,” Dean shushes gently and gets to his feet, cradling Castiel to his wide chest, hugging him close. “There’s nothing wrong with wanting it, nothing at all. Some people wanna be called bad and be spanked as a punishment, some want to be called good and get it as a reward, and some want, well I dunno, other things out of it, okay?”
Sammy had been awfully quiet in the last week since Dean told Cas and his friend about him. About him taking Dean in and about him being dead. Dean tried to convince himself that that was because Sammy was mad, but he knew that wasn’t true.
Desire and arousal wash over him in waves and he’s hot in his uniform, hand flying over his dick as he feels his orgasm crest. He grunts out a strangled groan and barely has the wits about him to catch his spunk. Most of it goes in the wad of tissues though and he feels boneless with how hard he comes.
The water went down like balm on his soul and he was quick to have another. Just as he was on his third mug, a sound behind him alerted him and he turned around only to see another person there. And not Marvin the security guard.
. He clicks around for a while, reading the blurbs and looking at the pictures, but eventually settles on an amateur video with two men, since his mind is still set on Dean because of course it is. Stupid Meg.
,” he hissed but didn’t get further when the driver of a passing cart barked at them to get out of the way.
He spots Sam sitting on a bench on the other side of the festival grounds and starts weaving his way through the crowd. He makes it almost all the way and then nearly walks into a dude just as he’s reaching the bench.
“Or what?” Dean breathes. The air suddenly feels thick with things unsaid where it before had felt cold and drained of life. “Or you’ll jump my bones?”
“I always do, Missouri,” he winked and when he turned away from her, he noticed Lisa, the village’s most sought-after bachelorette, in the stand next to Missouri’s.
Cas had told Dean that he was free to come and go as he wished, though he had warned Dean about getting too close to other humans. All humans were well-aware of mythological creatures and cryptids — or theological creatures, which was what Cas had told Dean he was — and most humans had either had encounters or personally knew such creatures themselves, Cas had told Dean. But, and this apparently concerned the man, most if not all humans were either wary of or outright scared of demons and devils and would have no qualms attacking Dean if they felt threatened and Cas told Dean he didn’t want him to get hurt. Dean was all too familiar with what humans could do to him if they wanted to and didn’t need to be told twice to be careful, though he didn’t tell Cas that or he suspected the man would never let him out of his sight.
There was a brief silence and then Balthazar nudged Castiel’s leg with his foot. “What did you want to talk to me about? I assume Dean, since we escaped in here.”
“Could you take the Impala if you’re going out?” dad asked just as Dean was leaving. A few more steps and he would have been safe, damnit! “Our girl needs to be filled up, just take some money from my wallet.”
Then Cas put his large hand on Dean’s neck, squeezing him and making Dean’s body lock up in anticipation.
“Hey,” Sam looks serious when Dean lifts his head, the Alpha smiling slightly when their eyes meet. “You’re gonna do great.”
That made Dean pause. He looked at Bob’s earnest face and then down again, to what had sprung free from Bob’s underwear. And yeah, looking at it compared to Dean’s own, it was small, definitely below average. But it was rock hard and pointed straight at Dean, inviting as hell.
Cas had said that it would be okay for Button to be out of his cage for short periods of time but that Dean had to watch him carefully so no accidents happened. Cas had to clarify that he meant that he was afraid that Button would relieve himself somewhere other than the designated area in his cage, but Cas had also admitted that there was a chance Button would chew on some cords and electrify himself. That could kill him, Cas had explained, and Dean’s heart had thumped wildly.
He’d slept badly because of that thing with Cas yesterday and he had a two-hour lecture on Academic Writing coming up. Dean was a smart guy, that much was true, but he’d never been much of a writer. He was more of a hands-on kind of guy when it came to studying, so he knew he really needed to be alert for this lecture.
“Yeah,” Dean purrs, rolling dirtily against Cas’ definitely interested body. “And listen, I have something I kinda wanna ask but it’s fine if you say no. It’s
And he was, his hole was loose and wet and how was that possible? Was it a demon thing or a succubus thing? Castiel’s analytical side fought desperately for control for a valiant three seconds but his beastly side took over again as soon as he pushed two fingers inside Dean without resistance, nearly blinding him with arousal.
Come to think of it, Cas hadn’t smelled bad. Dean frowned at himself as he dismounted Creed, tying his horse outside the whorehouse. What the fuck did he care what Cas smelled like anyway? Nothing, except perhaps that the lack of odor was surprising.
Dean squeezed his eyes shut, hands clenching on Cas’ back because this revelation brought a lot of other things to light. Things buried deep within him and that he hadn’t had a thought to dig up.
All his blood is rushing south, and he has to really make an effort to not let his pheromones blow out but from the looks of it he’s failing. Dean’s looking at him with hooded eyes and Castiel feels the Omega’s foot move again his, Dean’s fingers stroking Cas’ almost rhythmically…
“Dean, good God,” he kneels beside the boy, grabbing his shoulder gently and giving him time to unfold from his curled position on his own.
Cas let out a growl and let his cock slide against Dean, all the way up to his chin, bumping his cheek when Dean turned his head, and then down again, never losing contact, too massive to do that in this position. Dean moaned again, clenching his thighs around Cas’ cock and moving with the angel’s motions.
“Oh please,” she snorted, tone superior. “I’ve known him for years and we’ve had sex regularly. How well do
Castiel was still reeling a bit from what Dean had said, the thought that someone could have planned to hit on him almost absurd. But Dean was right, he had to have followed Castiel home for a reason and they
Well that certainly explains how Dean and his friends could be so comfortable at the Roadhouse a couple of weeks back.
It took the angel considerably less time to wake up than Dean had thought it would, though it was out long enough for Dean to make a little camp, complete with a fire and his worn tent. He hadn’t exactly planned to stay out overnight, today merely being a routine checking of his traps, but he always came prepared for the possibility and he knew neither Sam nor dad would miss him for a couple of days, both accustomed to impromptu camping.
“He absolutely could,” Castiel smiled, readily imagining Dean in the tight spandex that came with the Prince Charming costume he’d gotten for his Omega. “And you could be Lily’s, if you want to. We could switch places, you and me.”
this time. “I heard ‘help’ and ‘hurt’ and…” he furrowed his brow, thinking hard, whole head throbbing. Unconsciously, he brought a hand up to his ear, thinking his fingers would come away bloody but just as with his nose, his ears were actually fine. “‘Sass’? ‘Ass’? ‘Cas’?”
They were both hard now, the water crashing against the rock with their movements, and Dean couldn’t find his mind, couldn’t think about anything else other than how Cas felt in his arms. The man was all hard lines and sharp angles and it felt like it should feel so wrong and yet Dean wanted more, wanted to explore and feel.
Cas licked his lips, seemingly having to tear his eyes away from Dean’s dick. “I have, in many different forms, and don’t worry, I have experienced both ends. I know how to take proper care of you.”
Well, Dean still had a few tricks up his sleeve, and it was soon time for the Midsummer festival, that would be a great chance to charm the socks off her, perhaps even literally.
That makes Dean moan and he presses his face against the pillow at the same time as his ass clenches around Castiel’s finger.
Cas tilted his head to the side. “I thought, this is harmless, this is fun, this is good enough for me. I thought, I can’t get better anyway.” He closed his eyes and shook his head again, though this time it seemed to be directed at himself. “But you turned out to be
“Yeah, you’re fine,” he grins and rises to sit on his knees, pulling on Dean’s legs so that he ends up with them on Cas’ shoulders.
“You dummy,” he mumbled, hands coming up to cradle Cas’ jowls, warm drool wetting his fingers, Cas’ breath hot on Dean’s face as the angel looked right at him with his glowing blue eyes. “Don’t do stuff that can kill you. I’m sorry I shamed you for eating the other angel.”
In the end they were all satisfied with this and when they started to pack up, Dean dawdled a little on purpose so that he could get some alone-time with Cas. Benny caught his eye and grinned, wriggling his eyebrows in a way that almost made Dean blush like a pubescent girl. Fuck he was unused to how jittery he got around Cas. There was just something about him that made Dean’s insides squirm and he thought that maybe he knew what that was about but absolutely refused to acknowledge it this early in their
Sam looks down and yeah, he looks real fucking sad now. Dean’s instincts kick in, he doesn’t want this for his little brother. He can live with the pain; he can deserve it for all the times he could’ve just
Really, he shouldn’t have told them because they only treat it as a joke and who wouldn’t? Grown 40-year-old men don’t have teenagers nosing after them, not unless they’re filthy rich and God knows Cas isn’t. Also, they don’t see the true danger here, namely that Cas has realized by now that
. But Cas didn’t laugh, or look at him with pity. He just blinked once and then walked around Dean to stand chest to back, arms around Dean’s neck as he took the tie from Dean’s slack grip.
Dean stumbled through the dark forest, one hand up to swath at low hanging branches, the other holding a bottle of rum. He was going by feel alone, having lost most sense of direction as he replaced wit with alcohol. It was stupid and dangerous going out into the forest at night in general, even more so when he was unequipped for it and drunk off his ass, but he didn’t
Dean rubs his hands down his face. “Yes, dad’s old army buddy. Look, I don’t fancy Pam or something, she’s my
Cas huffed out a smile, looking to the side almost as if he were shy, even though they were both sticky with Dean’s come and Cas’ dick was still hard and pressed against Dean’s softening one. Speaking of…
The notion was baffling to him, but Dean looked serious. And glorious, a light sheen of sweat making his skin glisten and his eyes still a tantalizingly dark color.
Too bad everything disintegrated the moment he entered the clearing and found not Cas in his camp, but a completely buck naked stranger.
“Like this?” he asked, breathless, as he sat down on the chair, legs slightly spread and hardening dick bobbing.
Cas only looked slightly amused, though, and fuck him for that. “You know, me and Crowley are actually good friends,” he said and crossed his arms over his chest. “Aside from him satisfying some of my needs.”
Not that females can’t be football players in Cas’ mind but unfortunately Lawrence High isn’t that progressive yet. Well, in a way they are because the female students are more than welcome to try out for the male football team but so far no one has (to Cas’ knowledge) and they sadly enough don’t have a wholly female team. Soccer, on the other hand, has much more diversity but that wasn’t the field they were close to when Dean was attacked.
Sam just nods, probably thinks Dean is being childish, but Dean doesn’t care. He walks off, finds the nearest booth and starts racking up some slices. He decides he wants one of every pie and pretty soon he finds himself running out of hands. A nice old lady standing in the booth for cherry pies asks him if he’s getting pie for his entire family and he almost tears up again. Because yes, he is, because Sam is it. Dean’s got no other family now and it’s so unfair.
Dean’s only staying in Dubai for barely two days, and that’s at the airport hotel. Meanwhile, McSquinty is probably here for a vacation, which means he’ll probably be here for at least a week, meaning he won’t be flying home with Dean. And Dean knows nothing about him and he’s such a fucking coward but he won’t ask.
Castiel’s texting is clunky and inexperienced but he loves what little he can learn of the Omega through these snippets and he can barely wait until Friday.
“I wish,” Cas mumbled but when Dean looked at him, it was Cas who was looking away. The moment stretched out again and Dean found himself studying Cas’ eyelashes, as if that were a thing he’d normally look at. “You’ve been away for a while.”
, though, it’s the week after 4th of July, hottest week of the year so far, and Cas has gone to a five-day conference two states over wearing only his suit jacket and being adorably grumpy about even having to wear that. Dean loves it when Cas is grumpy. He gets snarky and frowny and his brow pulls tight and down and Dean feels a pleasant tingle every time.
“I’ll do my best,” actually, Cas is starting to feel better and better about this. He loves how demanding and in charge Dean suddenly is. It makes everything easier for him.
“Not like that,” Cas’ voice floated somewhere above Dean’s consciousness, but he felt helpless to obey.
Dean leans over the bench to reach for the passenger door, clicking it open for Castiel and giving him a huge grin when the Alpha slides into the seat.
Cas’ text was as short and concise as usual when he wanted to have sex. After they’d started texting a little outside of hooking up, their texting had changed a little, Cas opening up. But when he wanted sex, Cas still just sent the customary “now?” and Dean kind of liked it.
Andrea sat on her hands, rocking forward a little, hunching in on herself. “I know I promised Lily, but…”
Because Dean was of course just as splendid the other time around. Time seemed to flow in slow-motion as Dean expertly rode the bull. He was either a natural or he had done this
He stopped when he reached the top, arms akimbo as he breathed evenly through his nose. He was generally in good shape, but the bag was heavy, and the slope was steeper here than where he’d gone up last time. Well, yesterday, in some ways it felt like longer ago, as if Dean had known Cas for a lifetime already.
“Well I mean,” Dean rubs the back of his head with his other hand, looking away. “I’m still not taking you on hunts, I’m never putting you in direct danger if I can help it. But,” he shrugs a little. “I guess maybe you’re one of those people who’s comforted by the knowledge?”
Cas jerked when Dean lifted the comforter, sneaking into the warm bed not twenty minutes later. Cleaning up hadn’t been as fun as making the mess but Dean hadn’t minded, not when he knew Cas liked things to be neat and clean.
The interrogation reveals that yes, it’s vampires they’re dealing with, and yes, the kids are alive. Apparently, they grab a couple of kids every few years to raise them, feed them, “juice them up” because this nest “don’t do fast food”. This makes Dean’s blood boil, and he welcomes the rage, anything not to feel like a robot going through the motions anymore.
“And Castiel!” came a somewhat drunken yell from the other side of the big room, interrupting Mrs. Novak. “Let’s not forget your
For the moment they were on Cas’ couch, Cas on his back smoking and with his feet in Dean’s lap, Dean rubbing them as he watched reruns of Dr. Sexy MD and he fucking loved how they didn’t have to use sex as an excuse to meet up anymore. Dean could just come over because he missed Cas and Cas could just call him for the same reason. Sure, they’d totally traded hand jobs as soon as Dean was inside the door but that was beside the point.
The words were out of his mouth before he could think about it and when Cas looked at him with hooded eyes, Dean felt unexpectedly shy.
Dean dares to smile and thinks that this, this is what they fought for. For people and community and the world. And it’s almost worth all the sacrifices when he sees smiling children and happy parents.
“You gonna knot me soon?” the pleasure and arousal is still there, raging, but Dean feels tranquil all of a sudden, his inner Omega at peace and almost drowsy with the knowledge that he’s going to claim Cas. “‘Cause I need to bite you now and you—fuck yeah—you should too.”
And as luck would have it, his hotel features a rather nice lounge bar that seems a favorite not only amongst hotel guests but the locals as well.
Just like he’d hoped, it was a herd of deer, from the tracks there seemed to be at least three, if not four. Well, Dean was happy if he could get even one without scaring any of them off, but the prospect of bagging more for Cas had him quickening his pace. In fact, he could take the catch back to camp and skin it, string the hide up and feed Cas the meat. Deerskin fetched a nice price in the village, after all.
Castiel fusses, hands fluttering over Dean’s chest and back, supporting him without even knowing what’s wrong, what’s hurting. He gets Dean to sit down on the couch and Dean seems appreciative, grunting happily when he lands, eyes closing and body relaxing against the soft pillows and cushions.
was different, and Cas could feel it. But he couldn’t help it, couldn’t force himself to pretend anymore because everything was different for him now.
Castiel, unprepared, stumbled against Dean, hands immediately going to grab the man tightly as Dean licked his way into Castiel’s mouth. His tongue was warm and clever, easily battling Castiel’s into submission as he pushed their lips together, the kiss anything but sweet. It was full of raw desire, an attraction that threatened to consume Castiel and he groaned into it when Dean pulled away a moment later, licking his lips as his eyes roved greedily over Castiel’s face.
There’s a stretch of silence and Cas frowns at the room at large while Meg fiddles with her own phone. Well, “silence” isn’t wholly correct, he hears a lot of sounds. People talking, music, and he’s almost starting to think someone pocket dialed him when the person on the other end speaks up.
“When’s daddy coming home?” Lily asked. Andrea went to check herself in the same mirror Castiel had occupied.
just hanging out,” the man rumbled and grabbed Dean’s short hair, almost tearing it out by the roots as he pulled Dean’s head back and exposed his throat. Dean’s dick lurched in his jeans and fuck, Dean wanted to cry. This
His cock felt huge, felt just as big as in his true form, and Dean clawed at his bedroll, body at war with itself, fighting the intrusion at the same time as pleasure radiated out from his groin, pooling in his stomach, and warming him from the core out.
Pam puts her hand to her mouth, clearly trying to hide a smile, and when Cas looks at her she meets his eyes and winks. He feels as if she knows something that he doesn’t and he would like very much to ask about it but can’t at this moment, or maybe ever.
“Well in that case,” Dean grabs him by the nape of his neck and pulls him down, growls against his ear. “Get inside me and finish what you started,
When it was finally Dean’s turn to mount the bull again Castiel was buzzing with anticipation, although he concealed it well enough. He saw Dean’s friends tossing him glances from where they were standing, up by the ring, but he paid them no heed. He was perfectly comfortable back here, where he could pull one leg up and rest the ankle against his other knee, to hide inappropriate body reactions.
“Fuck yeah,” Dean was off him in the next instant and Castiel was left feeling bereft for a moment before he realized Dean was emptying his pockets and opening his jeans.
Why though? Why not go to his parents? Cas’ stomach twists when he considers the possibility of Dean being abused at home, but he pushes the thought aside for now. He will pull the truth out of Dean, and he refuses to assume anything before the boy has had a chance to explain it himself. This time, though, with how hurt Dean looks right now, Cas won’t let the issue rest. He needs answers and he needs them as soon as possible.
He muttered something that sounded like “whatever” and turned to go back to the bull. It had been busy in the background, flinging people off it left and right, and the crowd around it had grown even more but Castiel easily found an empty seat where he could comfortably watch from afar.
Cas chuckled and pecked Dean on his lips, igniting Dean’s whole body. “I’m saying I don’t have to pretend with you,” he took a step back, regarding Dean. “You got attracted to me when I had on my Gas-N-Sip façade but when I fucked you in my car you saw the real me and yet you’re still coming back for more. It makes me comfortable.”
God, the truth burns like acid in his throat. Two months without Dean’s visits have really taken a toll on Cas’ psyche, no matter how much his closest friends and family have tried to cheer him up. Meg has been spending more nights but not even her presence is enough and they both know why. Cas had hoped the distance would make his feelings cool down but apparently it’s only making them even more unbearable.
The thought brought sudden clarity to his mind and he looked down at his handiwork. It was sloppy, the cut zigzagging and jagged, the string already covered in blood and held in place only by the grip Dean had on its ends. His hands started shaking but he forced himself to tie the string in place before he collapsed down on the ground, only then truly noticing how much blood there was, and how much of it covered him.
“Oh sure,” Dean’s face immediately twists with renewed anger. “Wouldn’t want the neighborhood to wonder why I’m walking around with soiled pants, right?”
“I…” Dean chuckled, suddenly nervous, and rubbed the back of his head. “I actually have stuff I wanted to tell you today too.”
Dean wanted this conversation to be over because not only was he wet and looking like a kid who couldn’t drink properly — in front of his boss! — but now Castiel had also pointed out how stupid Dean was for not simply taking his computer home with him and finishing the report comfortably in his jammies.
“No, but I gathered enough to understand that Cas is his name, at least. He can understand me perfectly, though.”
“Maybe if mom were here, she could do this better,” he told absolutely no one. The forest around them was alive with birdsong and the wind in the trees but Cas was silent, the dead body of Cas’ kin looming just off to their right. “But she died. On such a stupid thing,” Dean huffed, going over to the pot to refill the bowl. He was about halfway done and thought it was looking pretty good.
Sammy’s face instantly softened, and he got a far-away look in his eyes, staring off into the darkness on the other side of the sleepy river.
“But I didn’t…?” Dean felt torn. On the one hand, good for him since he needed the money anyway, on the other hand, it was basically stealing, wasn’t it? “Are you sure there hasn’t been a mistake? I couldn’t have made this payment.”
Cas rumbled, pushing harder, so hard that Dean would have fallen down if he hadn’t been holding onto the horns. As it was, he slipped and Cas more or less lowered him to the ground, nose still against Dean’s stomach and teeth nipping at his clothes now, tearing little holes.
“Cas,” when Dean eventually spoke, his voice was wobbly, and he looked like he was about to cry. “I’m a demon…”
, I’m gonna come,” he brushed his thumbs against Dean’s wet cheekbones, making Dean open his eyes so that they could lock gazes. “Marvelous,” he rumbled, grinning, and Dean felt his own orgasm tearing through him now. “Are you—
“Listen,” he said, turning to walk over to the angel. “I feel like we got off on the wrong foot, I…” he looked at the angel’s wolf-like head. “You scare the shit out of me.” Dean stopped himself when he saw the angel’s eyes cut to his washed off trousers on the rock. Dean went beet red in the face. “Not
So far, the little kit was mostly friendly with Castiel, and absolutely adoring with Dean, but largely ignored the rest of the world. Castiel had almost thought he would spontaneously combust from cuteness overload the first time he’d found Dean napping on the couch with Button sleeping on his chest. That picture was now the wallpaper on his phone.
His stomach knots itself. He can’t say it. But of course he doesn’t have to say it, Meg is his best friend and she immediately knows.
“Stop calling him that,” Castiel snaps, angry yet again. “His name is Dean and you’d do well to remember that.”
He put his hands on his hips, slowly sliding them up his stomach and chest, over sensitive nipples and up his neck. Closing his eyes and letting his head loll back he repeated the motion, all the way back down again to his hips. His groin already felt on fire and he keened lowly, sinking to the floor when his knees gave out as a wave of arousal hit him.
Dean made a choked off little sound at that. “Oh no,” he whined and Castiel noticed him trying to close his legs.
But as that seemed to be his only option aside from damaging the deer, he resigned himself to it and was just about to redistribute his quiver and bow when he sensed a presence. Honed hunter skills told him he was being watched, he was in danger. Told him he needed to
Rhubarb would have to do, considering the price for blackberry. Dean was rich for the day, but he was no fool.
Couldn’t be, when he looked down at Dean’s wide smile and saw the answering affection in the little demon’s human eyes.
“Good,” Castiel said briskly to try and hide how weirdly emotional he felt. “Here’s a plate for you, do you know how to use a knife and fork?”
Dean breathed in deeply. Jesus fuck that had been a lot to say in one go. But now, after it was out there, it felt better. Felt better not to lie to his parents, who were already scarily supportive, and felt super great to say out loud that Cas
He put his phone on her desk, leaned so that he could have a good look, and directed Lily to sit on the chair, facing the mirror.
The sight made Dean groan and he spread his legs as if that would make him come in contact with the bed but damnit, he was still too high up to be able to hump anything but air. Still felt good enough to fucking come, though. He gnashed his teeth against Cas’ skin for a moment longer, making Cas groan loudly and shit, Dean’s pleasure spiked almost painfully, and he wasn’t even sure what specifically made it so. Probably a combination of everything, he thought as he pulled away slowly, licking soothingly.
The bruises had all but disappeared now, though. Dean’s body no doubt utilizing the supernatural healing most (if not all) demons had. Those hadn’t troubled Castiel as much, to be honest. What scared him more was the disarray of cuts and scars that went over Dean’s body in zig zag patterns. Because those were old, and they had to be deep to leave scars on someone like Dean, on any demon. Deep or constant.
And now, without further ado, let's see what happens on day two of How to Train Your Angel—ahem, I mean, Caelestis Bestia 😆
He got up, rubbing his arm, still smiling. “Thank you for saving me, Cas,” he said kindly, easily acknowledging that that was what Cas had done for him, even if he hadn’t needed it.
Castiel’s eyes narrowed with suspicion at this point. Because she clearly wanted Dean dead, didn’t she? So why were they even having this conversation? She had stopped attacking after she saw him capable of angelic magic, but why?
“Are you like this with everyone?” he murmured, head lowered. “You invite anyone who can pay for it to your bed, you entice them, you—”
“She knows you come here?” Cas steps out of reach when Dean looks as if he wants to pull him closer. “She knows you have a…” he waves a hand at Dean. “A crush on me?” it feels presumptuous to call it that without Dean having specifically stated so himself but he doesn’t know what else to call it.
“I’ll take such good care of you,” Castiel huffed out, breathless now as the pleasure burned white-hot inside him. “Rim you, prep you, fuck you.”
His dick, already at half-mast just talking about this, hardened so impossibly fast that it actually hurt. He hastened to rid himself of his shorts while Cas walked over to sit in the armchair, knees spread wide to accommodate Dean in-between. He massaged his dick through his suit pants for a moment, eyes raking up and down Dean’s body as Dean did his best to get comfortable.
The angel held her hands out to the sides. “I’m just stating the obvious, human. This creature isn’t in symbiosis with itself and it’s impossible to know when he will turn and hurt you or—”
“Oh fuck,” Gabriel chuckles. Castiel ducks his head again, the f-word making him feel squirmy. He’s not against cussing but that word in particular always makes him so
Cas nearly doubled over when Dean crashed into him, hugging him tightly enough that Cas apparently had trouble breathing because he made a choked off sound and pulled on Dean’s arms until he loosened his embrace.
Cas feels everything that has happened between them, everything they are to each other, build like a balloon in his chest and he finds himself reaching for Dean’s hand. The young man immediately takes it, fingers lacing together, and Cas almost feels like weeping himself. It’s clear to him now that he really never has been in love before, not when this act feels so much more with Dean, so immense it’s threatening to swallow him whole.
Dean was actually unsure if Cas was just stating his own conclusion or asking Dean for the truth. Dean didn’t even know the truth himself, except for one thing.
“Do it now, Dylan,” the man suddenly says, the first actual words spoken since the video began, and Castiel jolts.
Cas hummed. “Sam, yes,” he looked up to meet Dean’s eyes when Dean turned from the window. “She’s mentioned him once or twice.”
The way he uses Castiel’s subgender, as some kind of insult, cuts deeper into Castiel than anything else Michael said, and he’s left standing there in the living room as Michael saunters away.
“Why didn’t the car stop?” Cas was murmuring, clearly upset. He was holding the backs of Dean’s thighs, face against Dean’s stomach, and though the position was arousing, Dean understood that there were different touches, and this wasn’t for sex. Although now he kind of wanted it to be.
There’s a brief pause and then Charlie is laughing again. Cas leans back in his chair, his imagination having failed him. Not that he doesn’t know about the “daddy kink”, so to speak, but he can’t imagine someone say that to him.
“Hey now,” Dean shushes, and it sounds like he cradles the phone closer so he can lower his voice. Castiel only now registers the din of other people and music in the background. “I swear everything is fine. Me and Benny are at The Cellar, do you know where that is?”
The dinner was good, Dean had to admit that. Best food he’d eaten in a long time and all for free. He wished he’d been alone with Cas, though, because he wanted to talk to the man but aunt Gladys kept the whole table entertained and Cas seemed very low. Dean wanted to do something about that and he kept trying to make the other man laugh or even smile but felt it was a lost cause. He thought Mrs. Novak was part of the reason for Cas’ slump and wanted to give her a piece of his mind but didn’t really know how without sounding juvenile or undermining Cas’ authority.
, though, and it makes up for everything. Cas is obviously still trying to figure out how to kiss with finesse, but Dean doesn’t even care that it’s sloppy. Kind of likes that too, to be honest.
Dean’s chest bloomed with affection. This was the most they’d talked about anything other than movies and sex and Dean loved it, soaked up every minute of it like a sponge.
Castiel immediately flushed hot, suddenly so aware of Dean’s presence behind him, the man’s warmth radiating against Castiel’s backside as he leaned on Castiel. In short, it was a wonder that Castiel managed to speak clearly at all.
Cas looked up, looking frustrated for a moment but it soon melted away when he saw that Dean was serious.
Yet again, Cas finds himself wishing Dean would utilize Cas’ phone number and only barely stops himself from looking up Dean’s in whatever roundabout way he can come up with. In the end he figures it’s for the best anyway, because he
The angel’s sharp fangs dug easily into the carcass of his kin, tearing out chunks of meat that he chewed with an open mouth, frothing blood and slabs of meat spilling down his chest, matting his fur with dark red splotches. His wings arched above his back, all four of them sprawling out, spasming as he tore at the body in front of him. His eyes were glowing blue, the dots along his whipping tail shining even brighter.
“It’s okay, Dean.” Cas interrupts and pulls out of the hug. “It’s okay, Jack got me almost immediately. I think. I was asleep in The Empty, it wasn’t bad.”
It was fortunate that he did, Castiel thought, because Dean was dripping wet and his hooves were tracking in mud and grass and Castiel wasn’t a neat freak but yuck.
Yet another week went by and Dean was fucking suffering but this weekend he blatantly refused when Charlie wanted to go out for a drink.
One change this night was that when he walked up to the bar there was a pretty young thing behind it instead of Ellen. She was blonde, wore it in a ponytail, and looked way too clean and innocent to be one of the whores. Although, he thought as he approached her, some men would perhaps find that to be more enticing. Dean wondered if he was one of those men as he shot her a grin, leaning on the bar.
“Why not?” Cas asks kindly, leading Dean into the house with a gentle hand on his elbow. “You’re welcome here any time.”
Of course Dean had recruited his little brother to help him build his cabin in the clearing. Sam not only knew about Cas, but he was also now a certified builder, if Bobby could be trusted and as far as Dean knew, he could. Also, Sam had more or less attacked Dean when he’d returned to the village, pestering him with questions about Cas like the world’s most relentless hailstorm.
“I’ve never been happier,” Cas admitted, easy as goddamn pie. “I never thought something like this would happen when I first came here.”
“Okay,” Dean answers cheerfully and decides to play the waiting game, scarfing down on his ice cream cone while steadfastly
Dean cradled Castiel’s head to his neck, arching his back and moaning high-pitched. His dick was impossibly hard, quivering and helplessly trapped between them but even though Castiel longed to help Dean to completion, the man didn’t seem bothered by that and instead just kept squirming against Castiel, clearly deriving pleasure from the closeness.
They talk as Cas prepares the dish, the atmosphere comfortable, and Cas ends up enjoying the meal much more than he thought he would. Dean is interesting and smart, he’s got a quick wit and a raw sense of humor that has Cas laughing out loud, genuine and carefree in a way he hasn’t felt with people other than Gabe and Meg before.
Dean squeezes his hand. “I’m sorry.” He looks truly remorseful. “I should, I dunno, share more. I just want you to be as far away from anything supernatural as possible but maybe that’s hurting you, and us. Maybe,” he hesitates and Castiel can see the fear of loss play in Dean’s eyes. “Maybe I should take you to Bobby’s? I’ve been wanting you two to meet anyway, and he’s a much better teacher than I would be.”
Dad makes a face. “It probably won’t be, dad’s an old crank ever since mom died, you know how he gets.”
There was a pause when Dean didn’t know how to continue and then he felt Cas lean closer, the man’s face next to Dean’s as he spoke in a hushed rumble.
Gordon doesn’t question it by now, just rushes out of the office. Dean usually leaves immediately too, ever since his comment about how he doesn’t view Cas as a father figure Dean has stormed out after Gordon, sometimes without even being dismissed.
Dean’s heart thudded dully, and he felt such fondness for Cas in that moment that he almost missed how they turned onto Cas’ street. Almost, but there was Cas’ house in the horizon and Dean felt his body thrum to life, despite the actually very important conversation they were having.
“I’m glad, little brother,” Gabriel chuckled, holding up a cookie, which Castiel greedily accepted. “You deserve it.”
She has a pleasant voice, but Dean doesn’t notice that. Little details like that have stopped mattering to him.
Castiel still doesn’t know what possessed him to reveal his deepest sins to the young priest to begin with but thinks that it had something to do with the way Dean had looked at him. It had felt like a knowing and understanding look, something that invoked confidence and comfort, but that Castiel now suspects had something more to do with Dean already “checking him out”, as Dean would have put it.
Getting all the groceries on the bus was a hassle like usual and not for the first time did Dean consider the possibility of taking an Uber to shop instead. He knew it wasn’t feasible, not with how much cheaper the bus was, but still. At least he’d managed to snag an empty seat in the back where he could spread out. He longed to get back to his apartment and put everything away and then maybe text Cas.
“That sounds good, Castiel,” Pam says, her smile charming and inviting and Cas wishes he could be drawn in by her blatant flirting. “I have to say, Mary has told me a lot about what Dean’s been through and we’re all very grateful for your help. With a Principal like you I’d almost be tempted to have kids of my own.”
They were definitely standing close enough. The question was so innocent that it made Castiel smile.
“You think so?” Dean mumbled, looking down at the notes. “Do you think he spells it with only one S?”
Sam’s words had left Dean with an idea, though, and when he’d asked Charlie if they couldn’t do something with the LGBTQ+ club, she had been delighted. It would only be a small gathering, and Dean thought that was perfect. He’d been very happy after joining the community, being immediately accepted by the rest of the members, and he was proud to have contributed to an idea of something they could all do together.
“Please do,” Castiel answered, voice equally hushed, and nosed closer so that Dean turned his head just as their hands found each other’s hard-ons. “My friends do.”
“Yeah,” Cas’ childish glee was infectious to say the least and Dean couldn’t help but grin widely when the man got to his feet. “I think I still have the menu. No, wait,” he stopped, looking thoughtful. “I haven’t eaten there for over six months, they might have changed their menu. Let’s go there instead.”
“You should go to the post office and send her a letter, if you remember her address. Or telegraph her, we have the coin for it.”
Balthazar drew a deep breath. “I did, I have every ingredient and every incantation at the ready. But be careful, Cassie. An exorcism would mean banishing all of Dean, I’ve never heard of one that would work on only the demon side of a Cambion.”
Castiel had never really been embarrassed about his sex life and despite approaching 40 and not having a steady relationship he was happy the way he was. But in that moment, he actually felt shame, as if allowing Dean to witness that was something bad. Which, thinking back to the incident, it had been.
He winced when he saw how little was left in his wallet. Sure, he had some more on his Visa but damn, he should have planned this better and not done the grocery haul on the same day. Then again, he did need the food…
Cas gave him a look, a questioning one if Dean ever saw one but he ignored it, just smiled as his hard cock jumped in Cas’ mouth. Yeah, he wanted to see it. Ruby hadn’t even bothered to give him a fake moan but here was Cas, all hard for him and that had to mean something didn’t it? Dean wanted to see what kind of effect he could have on his partner, even if it was a man.
she was possessive, even though it had never really been serious between them. In fact, Castiel sometimes regretted sleeping with her, because he knew she’d read more into the situation, and they had long since stopped because of that.
The barn itself is creepy, the ambiance set for an ambush, but Dean’s not impressed, not after all the shit he’s been through. In a way this feels cheap and he’s not even scared. He thinks he should be scared for the kids, but his heart has never been so calm.
“I suppose,” Dean mutters and shoves the wine in Michael’s chest so the Beta won’t get smart and try to offer to take Dean’s jacket for him or some shit like that.
Dad was at work but mom had a day off and had decided to treat her sons to pancakes for lunch so she was at the stove, cooking up a feast.
“First and most special,” he answered with a grin of his own. “What do you say we drive to the grocery store and buy something nice to eat tonight?” to celebrate, was on the tip of his tongue but that felt silly. Well, perhaps not so silly when he thought about what he (they) had just accomplished here, but he was loath so say it out loud.
“Yeah,” Dean grinned, lowering his eyes when memories of Cas’ grinning face swam to the surface of his mind. “You have no idea.”
“I have leftover apple pie,” Cas says and gestures Dean into the kitchen. “It’s two days old but I think it still holds.”
Yes, Castiel had certainly done it now, but as he stood there and enjoyed the feeling of Dean’s hand soothing in the wake of the scratchy loofa, he couldn’t find it in himself to regret it. Because the truth was that he while was experiencing bursts of succubus pheromones that made him want to do things to Dean that weren’t necessarily appropriate, he was also experiencing the liberating feeling of falling in love and for perhaps the first time in his life he wasn’t scared of the feeling.
“If you wanna stop just do so,” Cas turned to face the hallway outside his bedroom, arms up on the doorposts again. “Come on, give me one to see where we’re at.”
Dean saw how Sam was grasping at straws and how that conviction of his was sliding out of his grasp.
Balthazar hummed. “I don’t know much about it, but I do believe it’s rune based? Supposedly you draw a rune in the air and you speak it, activating the magic.”
“Really?” Dean doesn’t pull away, but he does loosen his grip a little, eyes flying over Castiel’s body. “A virgin?”
“You’re usually a thoughtful lover?” Balthazar ventured and Castiel thought that maybe it should be weird discussing this, like talking about sex with your brother, but he recognized the drive to learn new knowledge in Balthazar’s tone and focused on that. It
Cas’ cock jumps and he pulls out of Dean, adding more lube and another finger, quickly working the man open. Dean’s soon rolling into his touches and Cas pauses to put on the condom, giving himself a few well-needed strokes. Dean pulls up his legs and when Cas looks up, he sees Dean looking at him with hooded eyes.
The strength of his own voice surprised him, though it faded fast enough when the angel’s eyes narrowed in annoyance. He tightened his grip on Dean’s shoulder as the angel came closer, towering over the both of them.
"Hey, you must be Mr... uh. Shurley?" A short nod of affirmation. Dean steps aside his desk to crouch down to the child. "And
After a few moments Cas leans back, peering at Dean with tired blue eyes. Dean closes his own as Cas gently brushes a thumb against his skin, feeling the gentle scratch of the wounds knotting together with magic. When Cas moves his hand Dean opens his eyes, looking at the Auror. Didn’t seem like he had a scratch on him.
!” Dean shouts, trying to push Cas off by the chest, trying to fight his own robes from obscuring his view. His back presses against the sodden grass, and they roll around the floor, trying to press each other’s wrists back enough that the other will relent.
Both the Winchesters remain quiet as the voices of the other siblings echo across the pitch to them. Dean is secretly glad it wasn’t a windy day.
He clenches his fist, and pours the mix into a vial on the desk. While doing so he pretends to slip and most of the equipment on his desk go rolling onto the floor, and he kneels down to gather them up. Voices rise with a few of the students beginning to murmur, and he can hear the heavy soles of Crowley’s shoes click on the wood as he walks over.
The boys dutifully do as he says, though, and he thinks for a moment that they’re too trusting. Sure, he and Sam don’t have masks on but they’re still full-grown men that the boys don’t know, carrying weapons. And they just come along.
It was difficult to tell if he was angry for real or not but Castiel did detect a slight tremble to his voice and it was the kind of tremble he usually liked to hear from his clients so he surged ahead.
Cas groaned deeply when Dean licked him gently, Cas’ hand moving furiously to get his cock out and yes, yes, Dean wanted it inside him or on him or any which way he would get it.
“Dad, jeez,” Dean stopped the older man, rolling his eyes again but mom made a sound that made him look at her.
He needs to do this for himself, it’s not gonna get served to him on a platter, and he understands why but it’s still tough.
Cas, for his part, stayed mostly still on his back, one hand gripping the blankets that had been haphazardly thrown to the side and the other resting above his head. He was looking at Dean, studying him, Dean knew without even looking. He could feel Cas’ eyes on him like fire licking his skin and he enjoyed it very much. Cas seemed to like what he saw too, his breathing almost ragged without them barely touching. The flush on his chest was spreading too and Dean wanted to trace it with his lips, feel the scorching heat, but instead settled closer to Cas’ body to begin prepping him.
Sam walks up, puts his hand around Dean and fucking hell, the pain is white hot, searing through him. Is this really how he dies?
“So, what?” his blood was rushing faster, annoyance building along with his confusion. “So you thought I was a prostitute because Cas can’t get a date of his own?”
“No, no, no, no, no,” he grunts. “Don’t… don’t… don’t move me. Don’t move me.” A tiny gasp for air. “It feels like this thing’s holding me together right now.”
“Still,” Michael said, his tone a little assertive now. It made Cas frown disapprovingly and a thrill went through Dean’s body. “You registered Bela and you.”
Pleasure zinged up his spine and Dean felt frenzied in his need for Cas. He shuffled to get on his knees, at least a little, so that he could arch his back better, spread his legs so that his balls and dick hung freely, and Cas was quick to lick deeper,
Dean pull the dead goat from his claws only served to make Dean more aroused. Cas didn’t seem to get that, though. So far, he seemed mostly confused about what was going on, but that would change soon enough.
He arched his back, ass canting out, and Dean had to swallow hard before putting his hand on it. He groaned a little under his breath without meaning to when he felt Cas’ plump cheek in his hand again. The skin was just as soft as he remembered, and the give was fantastic, exactly what Dean wanted.
When he got out of the bathroom, Cas was waiting for him, instantly igniting the fire Dean had barely managed to control.
Then perhaps what he had seen in the shower with Dean all those weeks ago had been a mirage? Castiel hadn’t asked Dean about it and he felt a little stupid pursuing the thought with Balthazar now, even though he trusted his friend to take it seriously if he wanted him to. Well, Castiel hadn’t really been in his right mind during that shower, attention stolen by Dean’s supple body. If he saw those golden images again, when sober and in his right mind, he would consider the reality that Dean somehow had learnt the intricate angelic runes, but only then.
to bid because I don’t have that much money, by writing our name and a sum on a piece of paper. Bidding is on stuff like a boat or a trip or whatever bullshit mother has managed to come up with as incentive.”
The choked off sound made Castiel delirious with want, arousal burning so hot inside him that he couldn’t even think anymore, animalistic instincts taking over as he pushed against Dean, willing the man to spread out on the seat beneath them.
Well, I gotta say the ending of this fic lined up nicely with the sixth month anniversary of canon!Destiel (yesterday) and my birthday (today) 😄
Dean rips his mouth away, arching his neck and groaning. “Fuck me, Cas,” he presses out and Castiel is sorely tempted to do so when Dean’s hole clenches tight around him. “Fuck, did you just get bigger?”
This time, with only the fabric of their underwear between them, the pleasure was palpable, almost enough to choke Dean. He moaned loudly into the kisses, hips surging up to grind against Cas’ and Cas was quick to meet him, their bodies rolling in delicious waves that made Dean delirious with need.
Dean’s groin was on fire, his dick practically forced itself out of its sheath and he could feel his hole twitch, growing so wet it trickled out of him. He almost fell forward, jackknifing when a powerful wave of desire hit him. Something happened behind the shower wall that made Cas moan, louder than any noise he’d made so far, and Dean watched with greedy eyes how the shadow moved jerkily.
“I, uh, I guess I just…” now Dean looks almost mortified, which is an improvement from how beaten he had looked when Cas first opened the door.
“It’s super cool, he’s strong and badass but he’s also—damnit!” Dean bows his head, breathing deeply while Sam laughs out loud, obviously giving up on trying to be tactful. “What I’m
had he done that? Ultimately it had gotten him killed and Castiel had no doubts Sammy had known it would come to that end and yet he had brought Dean into his home and protected him as the demons attacked. Well, that was how Dean had told the tale, but assuming he was telling the truth, Sammy seemed strange for a demon indeed.
Castiel took a moment to wonder how the room got like this so quickly. It looked like a tornado had stopped by for coffee.
Principal Novak?” Pamela says, tone suggestive enough for Cas to know they have been talking about him at home. His neck prickles again and he resolutely does not glance at Dean as he shakes her hand when she offers it. “You didn’t tell me he was this handsome, Mary,” she looks appreciatively at him and Cas can easily concede that the look makes him interested as well.
The next rumble was much closer, almost close enough to rattle Dean’s ribcage and he stopped despite himself, looking up into the billowing clouds. It was almost as dark as nighttime, and Dean felt his throat close up a little. Was this really a natural storm? It felt threatening in a whole different way and there wasn’t a raindrop to be seen.
Tune in next week when I start one of the two fics I auctioned out through the FicFacer$ auction this year! For those of you who are curious, it’s a timestamp to an old fic of mine, one with an innocent human Cas and a very sneaky hunter Dean who impersonated a priest 👀
but Castiel had never cared so little about anything in his whole life. He wanted Dean, the Dean he knew, with horns and fangs and hooves and double-jointed legs with fur. He wanted all of the little demon and the clearer it got that Dean wanted him too, the more desperate Castiel felt to make it so. To claim him, to own him, to protect him, to
Dean and Sam Winchester rode into town on a sunny spring afternoon of 1871, less bluster and more blisters than either of them had hoped for, but then that was what you got, after living on horseback for several months.
. It’s sweet and slow and it has Castiel melting back against the door, body trembling when Dean swipes his tongue along the seam of Castiel’s mouth. He opens up but Dean pulls away, eyes smoldering as he considers Castiel.
But he wasn’t a demon, though, was he? He was a human soul sharing an underdeveloped vessel with a demon. He was a Cambion.
Castiel was taken aback with how accurate that was, though Lily had always had an acute sense of observation, when she put her mind to it.
Dean is quiet for a moment, but Castiel doesn’t reflect on that, too busy pouring in the rest of the ingredients. He makes a soft sound when Dean suddenly pulls him into a sideways hug, face against the crook of Castiel’s neck.
But Dean raises his hand mercilessly, landing yet another teeth-rattling blow and Castiel shouts out his innermost desires even as his balls draw up tight.
“One day, Button,” Balthazar mumbled and got to his feet to come over and perch on Castiel’s desk. Castiel grinned to himself, finding it funny how Balthazar vied for Button’s attention every time he came over, even though he was unsuccessful every time. “Well, at least I have Bones, don’t I boy—?”
“Alpha,” he whines, daring to let go of the wall to turn over his shoulder, grabbing Cas’ hair in one hand as he strains to kiss the Alpha. “Want you so fucking bad.”
had been the wrong choice of words for explaining this to the man but Dean had done it and it had sounded delicious.
“I don’t think we’ve been introduced,” Kali said then, her voice sultry and Dean offered up his best smile.
“You think I would poison you?” Castiel asked, saddened. Not so much to be suspected of such a thing but because he knew how true it would be in most instances. Creatures such as this were most often met with distrust and aggression, even though not all were deserving of it. “I’m not.”
A very bold thing to say but Castiel has the feeling Dean favors boldness, and so does fortune in his experience. Sure enough, Dean’s face breaks out in a grin and he ducks his head, chuckling.
It was so thick, thicker by far than anything Dean could have taken inside him and yet that was all he wanted. The head was wet, sticking to Dean’s chest as he rode the massive girth of Cas’ arousal, the angel using his powerful hindlegs to shove Dean down, humping him and the ground alike.
“Oh, well, um,” Dean felt small and stupid for a moment. “You told Michael I was in college, we can just keep saying that. Give it a few weeks and it won’t even be a lie.”
“Well, then,” Cas said after a long moment spent in silence. Dean only then realized he’d been staring straight at Cas’ face the whole time while the man smoked his cigarette and stared out into the forest. “Wanna fuck me in the backseat of your car?”
He flexed his hand on Cas’ chin, but the grip was loosening as his arousal peaked. One last look revealed that Cas was watching him intently, mouth slightly open as he panted, and Dean felt his own breathing stutter to a stop as he shot forcefully inside Cas.
Dean threw Castiel a glance over his shoulder, obviously trying to look as if he needed to be saved, as if Castiel would believe that. He knew Dean loved to play with their pups, so he just shook his head, smiling.
Cas just chuckled but Dean felt ineffective in that moment. He could only hope that he would get his shit together soon so that he could show Cas that he could be the man he deserved, and that Cas deserved to be fucking loved.
There are less bruises this time, although one is blooming on Dean’s jaw and Cas is liberal in his use of Arnica, just like last time. Neosporin is not supposed to sting like Iodine, but Dean makes hissing noises anyway. Cas just tuts at him and finishes off the wound on the boy’s arm by wrapping it in some gauze he finds in his cabinet.
Gabe blinks at him and then snorts out a laugh. “Seriously though, what the fuck’s been up with you?”
He felt choked up but didn’t want Dean to notice, so instead he put his arm around Dean and started walking them again.
tight; maybe Cas hadn’t taken enough time to stretch himself and hell, Dean didn’t want to hurt him.
Dean had never felt like this before. The tightness, the heat, the tension between them overwhelming him in ways that frightened him.
To be quite honest he only said that to draw attention away from the fact that Dean had called him Cas. Sure, the boy’s parents know that Dean has been over at Cas’ to help him out in the garden but still, the nickname seems too familiar to Cas in this case. Also, he
“I want you so fucking much,” Dean all but moans, hands cupping Castiel’s face and neck, groin rubbing against Castiel’s and oh my God, the Omega is smelling delicious and he’s already hardening.
“C’mere, baby,” he mumbles, knowing from experience that Dean responds well to little endearments like that in bed. That he had discovered on accident, so maybe the Daddy kink could be the same?
“I thought…” Cas’ hand on Dean’s neck flexed and yeah, there was no denying the arrow of desire that went through Dean. “I thought you looked good, you’re cute, your personality is too,” he added with a small smile. “And you seemed really into me. I thought good, here’s some distraction for me. International Business that you take only because your dad pay for your studies is pretty fucking boring.”
It’s not that he doesn’t want Dean to have friends, of all kinds, but Benny is just… he’s just too much. And in the way, Castiel realizes with a start. He’s angry that his precious time with Dean is being occupied by someone else. If they lived together, if Castiel was a more active part in Dean’s life, he wouldn’t be feeling quite so jealous, he thinks. It’s his own fault, then, for opting to live what Sam calls a “normal life”, instead of being with the brothers full time.
Mrs. Moseley hums in that way of hers and starts eating her chicken stew again. “And I suppose you just barreled ahead with your reasoning?”
Well, that bottle was gone now, filled with water instead because Sammy was anything but wasteful, and Dean’s cock was starting to crave attention again.
Dean panicked. He’d asked that because he thought that he should, that any normal person would ask that, and also because he was kind of dying to know. But now Cas looked like he was regretting asking Dean again and no, Dean would
Sam shut his mouth so fast Dean could actually hear his teeth clack. He stared at Dean for a long while, so long that Dean had time to flip the steak. Smelled delicious, by the way.
Castiel felt struck by the images of Dean’s beaten and battered body. “Like the angels fear the Nephilim,” he mumbled. “Demons too…”
“What do you mean why?” Dean chuckled and started stroking Cas’ thigh as he tore his eyes away from the man’s flustered expression, instead looking out the windshield. He thought he recognized himself somewhat and hoped that meant they were soon at Cas’ house. “Because I just spent some long awfully lonely fucking weeks and if you’d let me, I’d rather just call you whenever.”
“Well then I—” Dean said, almost vigorously, but then stopped himself, looking to the side. “No, Sammy…” he mumbled, cheeks heating.
Yeah, Castiel wouldn’t have to explain to Dean to tread carefully, Andrea’s nervous scent was telling enough.
He gave Cas a small wave, receiving a tail whip in return, and then he was off, dragging himself up the same slope Cas had carried the dead angel over. That direction led further north to the looming mountains and hopefully some deer, or at least a goat.
Dean licked and nipped, the taste of Cas filling every crevice in Dean’s damn stone heart. Cas made these little breathless sounds, small whines when Dean pulled away and deeper moans when he came back.
“Don’t take it the wrong way, Dean,” she’d said, all patronizingly and whatnot. “It’s just… well, Gordon has his
“The traps were mostly empty,” Dean shifted, still undecided about telling his father about Cas. “I’m thinking of going deeper, but I need more supplies.”
Yeah, Dean felt a bit bad about that, but he had his own shit to deal with, so Sam had to fend for himself. For one, basically the whole village knew what had gone down between him and Lisa and though Dean wasn’t much for caring about what other people thought about him, it still hurt when they threw him pitying glances.
When it’s finally time for Dean to retreat to their sleeping compartment he wastes no time getting out of his slacks. He’s more happy than usual that Benny’s with him on this trip now. When Dean flies with women pilots and get the urge to wack off he usually does it in the toilet, mainly because he doesn’t want them to have to smell his spunk because that’s just tacky. And some of Dean’s other male colleagues don’t like it either, Dean’s come to learn.
His dick jumped as he came untouched, his thick come hitting the wall and splattering on the floor between his feet. He melted in the man’s strong arms and felt his hole milking the man’s cock for all it was worth. It went on for much longer than Dean had ever come before and he hardly registered when the man pressed his face against Dean’s sweaty neck with a groan, stilling his movements as he came in Dean’s tight ass.
“Breakfast of champions, dad always says,” the excitement in Dean’s tone is palpable and makes Cas relax.
Dean raised his shot glass, remembered it was empty and put it down again with a sigh. He didn’t want to call her back, didn’t like the way she looked at him. Just like her mother, too knowing for Dean’s comfort. Hell, what was it even they thought they knew? More than him, that was for sure.
“I touched myself to thoughts of fucking you, right here on this bed, Dean,” Cas growled and that was all she wrote.
Dean whimpered and Castiel slid lower on the bed, mouth and fingers once again going to Dean’s nipples. The demon seemed to really like having them played with and Castiel always loved pleasuring his lovers. Licking earned him whiny gasps but when he bit down on one of the nipples, Dean’s dick slid free of its sheath again and Castiel smirked to himself.
The general consensus in the village seemed to be that as long as Dean was still around to bring them meat and other goodies from the forest they didn’t care where he lived and for that, Dean was grateful.
Dean watched the two of them carefully, while chewing on his cookies. Castiel knew this not because he met the demon’s eyes but because he felt the gaze on him like a living thing. Dean’s eyes were very electric, whether it was the demon or the human ones.
Fuck, that actually felt kinda great, to know that Cas would react like this if Dean ever was in real danger. Well, he
He stopped dead in his tracks. Nothing. That night had been about nothing, that was what he’d concluded to begin with and that was why he had felt so awkward about it,
“I bet, you’ve always been a bro,” Gabriel tried unsuccessfully to flag down one of the bartenders. “Son of a…” he sighed. “Honestly, I thought they’d let up on me when you went all gay during college.”
“Look at me,” he whispered, and Dean obeyed, just like he always did. So perfect for Castiel alone. “You’re incredible, absolutely stunning.”
Dean knew that, he could feel the power in her and knew he could squash her like a bug. Not that he wanted to, or ever would need to, he supposed. But there was something about her that made Dean feel challenged and he felt something dark come over him, eyes flicking to his demon sight as he leaned down over her.
Contrary to what Dean had thought, the impact hadn’t made a great hole in the earth but rather he noticed that whatever it was that had fallen had landed in the clearing where Dean usually went to have a swim or clean his catches.
Dean is a boy no more, after all. He’s still in high school, true, but he had his birthday last week and he’s eighteen now. Cas hates himself for looking up the date, hates himself for a lot of things but none more than how he’s making Dean feel.
been? Experience, he assumed, and he whipped around to lean against the bar, hiding his crotch and trying to catch his breath.
It’s a bleak Thursday when Dean decides to confront Cas. Conveniently enough for the boy, Cas is occupied with tacking up various posters on the announcement board and so he’s completely unaware of the ambush. He startles badly when Dean comes right up to him and leans against the board.
“Do you think you can? At this time, I mean?” Dean asked, feeling anxious to get home, as if Cas would change his mind. He groped for Cas’ hand and was pleased when Cas brought his hand up to his lips to kiss it once before he let go to tap away on his phone.
“Me too,” Dean grins, trailing his fingers lazily through the come that stains his stomach and chest. “So what do we do now?”
So yes, going to Eggsperience without Cas felt kind of hollow but whatever, he couldn’t let what may or may not have happened with
They’d eaten well, played music, and drinking games, and watched a scary movie where Dean definitely took the opportunity to cuddle with Cas. Not that he was scared but because the couch was small and he wanted to touch, damnit. He hadn’t been drinking enough to blame alcohol for his need for intimacy but somehow, with Cas, he didn’t think he needed to have an excuse. Cas just looked mightily pleased and let Dean press against him.
“D-Dean,” Cas almost bites the word out and Dean turns to him to push off the coat gently. “I should shower.”
, and grabbed his dick with one hand, the other holding the back of Castiel’s head. He stepped up but instead of thrusting directly inside like Castiel had thought, Dean took a moment to trace Castiel’s lips with the head of his dick, smearing precome all over.
“Before you what, sir?” Dean murmured and walked closer, slowly, to give Castiel time to flee. Didn’t want to
contemplated if he was hungry or not. Head bowed, eyes squinting in thought, tail thumping lightly, he was sitting on his rump like an animal, wings spread out behind him. He was an
“Dean,” this time the smile was genuine, and Dean returned a hesitant one. “I called you over because I
It’d taken Castiel longer than he had wanted to get a job and an appropriate apartment that was a nice distance to KU campus but still within his price range
Dean gives him a crooked smiled. “Didn’t think I would be the kind of Omega to sleep with someone on the first date? Well I’m not, normally. I—”
while, and when he eventually drags himself to his feet he sees that Cas has disappeared from his window. It’s closed and dark as usual after their sessions end and maybe Dean feels a little twinge to the heart that this time the end wasn’t different since the session so clearly was.
Despite Sammy’s protests, Dean walked a bit into the woods, searching for a moment before coming back with a broken off piece of bark. Cas glanced at it when Dean kneeled beside the grave and then he gave Dean a huge smile when he saw what Dean attempted, blinding Dean with its beauty.
The angel pulled out of the embrace to nose his way up Dean’s body, nose big and wet as he pressed it against Dean’s sensitive skin. Over ribs, nipples, up to breathe in against Dean’s neck. It made him gasp and turn into the touches.
“That’s very sweet of you, but I’m taken,” she teased, and Dean couldn’t help but chuckle. He liked banter like that, especially with people working customer service. “What can I help you with?”
“I dunno,” he said, pretending to think really hard. It was a commercial on the TV now, which kind of ruined the illusion a little. “I
“Oh shit, that’s right,” Dean laughs and slides the car into traffic as if he were born to maneuver something so big. It makes Castiel even more aroused for some reason and he forgets to feel ashamed that he still hasn’t moved into his own place. “My room it is, hang on.”
The panties, while probably the only size that can fit him, wrap snugly around his butt and package. Though his dick and balls are small in comparison to Cas’, he barely fits in the panties and the bulge makes him look bigger than he is. The sheer material is smooth against his skin and the pink color makes the whole thing look almost more demure than sexy and somehow Dean feels all the more ravishing for it.
Dean remained still as Cas walked over to him, hands gentle and soft as he examined Dean’s head, presumably for bumps. It was a bit redundant, considering it had been Dean’s horns that had hit the toilet,  but Dean didn’t say anything, mostly because he liked Cas’ hands on him. It made him warm inside and he felt squirmy, like he wanted to stand even closer to Cas. Maybe when the human was naked again, like he had been last night in this room. Dean wished that Cas had slept naked. Humans’ need for clothes was stupid, Dean thought now, for perhaps the first time.
Then in the next moment that movie with the actor who looked like Cas came on the TV but Cas just kept on flipping!
“Then I don’t see a problem, Dean. I’m happy he asked you to come to this event with him, it seems like a good first date.”
“But only for a little while, though. A few days.” He told the angel as he packed up his tent. Cas was floating in the pond, having a well-needed bath. “I just need to check in with dad and Sammy or they’ll send out a search party for me and we don’t want that.”
“Let’s listen to what these old farts won and then go grab a smoke,” Cas suggested when Dean couldn’t find his words. Couldn’t find
“You look like something straight out of an Armani ad,” Cas shut the door behind him, still eyeing Dean up and down and he would have to be careful about that or Dean’s dick would make them late.
She visibly balked but stayed silent for a moment, kind of just staring at Cas. Dean looked between them, uncomfortable with how close they seemed.
Cas just grunted and settled in, curling around Dean’s body as Dean relaxed against him, the birds still chirping merrily in the trees above them.
“This isn’t over,” the man who’d done the talking so far shouted, though his words seemed directed to the man still standing at the alley’s opening. “You tell your old man that.”
“I think because he’s a Cambion, he gets the best of both worlds,” Balthazar said then. “The demonic powers to entice anyone he likes and the human vulnerability that makes him attractive in a more approachable way. A true succubus would be able to pull in anyone but there’s still the sense of danger, isn’t it? And then it’s too late.”
“No Dean’s right,” Gabriel was looking at them when Dean and Cas turned to him, a big grin on his face. “Out of everything to come out of our broken family, you’re the best, Cassie.”
He stopped by the campfire and stirred the pot he had hanging over it. The green soup inside smelled much better than it ought to and had thickened just the way he wanted it. He got his porridge bowl and scooped up a ladle full of the green goop.
Instead, he turned to look at Cas’ face, trying and failing not to feel shame about so blatantly checking out the angel. “So I guess you really
dead,” she sniffed and got on the bus, effectively cutting off whatever Dean could have said in his defense.
Cas just gave Dean a smirk, licked his lips once with the pinkest fucking tongue Dean had ever seen, and bent down to take Dean’s cock in his mouth. Well, fuck. There was no last minute hesitation there, no sir. This wasn’t a fucking prank on the new guy in town, Cas had done this before, Dean was fucking sure of that now.
“Yeah, I’m not too keen on getting rid of your scent but,” he arches his back, rolling his hips, and Cas slides right out of him. “I wouldn’t mind fooling around in the shower either.”
But he needed to make Cas come first, right? Maybe he should try choking the man like he’d done during their first time? But shit, Dean’s body wasn’t complying, too far gone into his pleasure to be able to do much more than pump his hips like the desperate teenager he was.
Dean whips his head around, making Cas lose his grip on his ass. “You were serious about making me come again?”
“Yeah, so…” he flashed her a new smile, one more born from how good it felt to think about Cas than for her benefit.
gold and we can still get a hefty sum from Crowley. But also, what the fuck are we doing? We’re no prospectors.”
“Which could lead to knighthood,” Castiel nods when Dean’s scent blooms with how pleased he obviously is to hear that Castiel follows his logic.
Dean hummed and pulled back his left hand only to bring it down again, the slap sharp enough to sting even Dean’s hand. This angle was even worse than the last, but Dean couldn’t make himself pull back just yet. Felt like he had to stand there and press his painfully hard dick against Cas’ burning ass for a moment longer or he would go insane.
and he felt bad. Felt even worse about how proud he felt when he saw that the one on Cas’ neck was still very much visible even when he put on a t-shirt, but damn that really appeased his lizard brain.
“Did you like the food?” he asked and watched with fascination how Dean swayed forward in his seat but then seemed to reel himself in.
and refused to believe it was because Cas had bathed him in holy light or something stupid like that. Hell, he’d been trying to help the angel way before that, so his sanity was probably safe. Probably.
And then Cas smiles and it’s really him and the world crumbles a bit around Dean, a shuddering breath escaping him.
He kept licking and nipping at Cas’ neck, hips bucking into Cas’ hand like a wild animal in rut and maybe that was all he’d been reduced to. Hell, all he’d known was that putting marks on Cas would be like belonging to the man a little but now the feeling was almost overwhelming him.
But this guy wanted Castiel to come inside him and Castiel would be damned if he didn’t deliver. Brushing his dick he thought he might have overdone it, though, because shit, it felt as if he was about two seconds from blowing already.
Oh but Cas was skilled in touching Dean. He rubbed the slit on the sheath with his thumb, fingers gently cupping Dean’s balls and it made pleasure bloom in Dean’s abdomen.
“Fucking do it, Cas,” he growled and that made the man shudder before abruptly releasing all over Dean.
Dean is watching him with hooded, dark eyes as Castiel rights himself on the bed, and blurts another blob of lube on his fingers. He’s feeling generous tonight.
“Best Alpha I’ve ever seen,” he pokes his tongue out to wet his lips and good Lord… “Or smelled. Wanna go on a date?” Dean’s own scent is saturated with attraction and it makes Castiel’s head swim.
“Oh great!” Dean exclaims and starts walking, pulling Castiel along by his hand. “So you don’t mind having sex on the first date? Because I can’t wait a fucking
This über cool outfit for my character in World of Warcraft (not featured: my sexy as hell character, this is just an ad lol):
,” John says indignantly and adds oil to the pan. “And the second time wasn’t even because you let me.”
“Don’t say that,” Dean mumbles, thinking about those damn pink panties. Should he tell Cas he has a surprise for him? No, better not ruin it. “It’s about your inner Alpha. And ruts,” he breathes out the last word, aroused just talking about it.
How Dean has felt all these years, having Cas stand by his side, always choosing him, and how he felt these past few weeks without Cas. How he spiraled, how he hoped for more without being able to actually hope, or knowing how to achieve it alone.
“It’s not…” Dean looked down, picked at invisible dirt on his knee. “It’s not like that. I think he just said it because I happened to be there. And his brother was being such a douche, dad.”
“It’s just,” Sam shook his head, smiling to himself. Way too fucking smugly. “She seems possessive.”
To be honest, the bruising wasn’t that bad, and he hadn’t taken a lot of hits. His assessment was that he most likely would be more than fine. Cas, though…
Castiel climbs on the bed too, admiring Dean under him for a moment before reaching over and grabbing Dean’s left knee. To his delight, Dean is pliant as he moves him, putting his knees together and rolling the man to the side so that he has to crane his neck to look over his shoulder up at Castiel.
Cas makes a little hiccupping sound and it’s all warning Dean gets before the Alpha closes the gap, kissing Dean deeply. He licks over Dean’s lips and hell yeah, he’s Omega enough to admit that he wants Cas sooner rather than later. The sound the Alpha makes when their tongues tangle together is nothing short of divine and Dean shifts so that he can spread his legs and make more room for Cas.
But from the way Dean behaves and from the richness of the slick that’s spilling out of him it’s obvious that Castiel is more than enough and he marvels at the thought as much as he basks in it.
“No,” Dean mumbled, squirming against Castiel, trying to wriggle closer and in doing so, making Castiel’s heart explode with affection. “But the other demons…”
It’s so sudden and surprising that Cas doesn’t at first register what happened. He keeps thrusting for a moment, grunting as his pleasure mounts, crests, Dean’s hole spasming pleasurably around him. It’s only when he lowers Dean’s leg and reaches for his dick to help the man over the edge that he realizes that Dean already came. A lot.
“I dunno,” Jo says teasingly. “I seem to remember you mentioning something about Cas’ brother being interested in you? How’s that going?”
, Dean still hadn’t contacted Cas and hadn’t been to the Gas-N-Sip and Cas hadn’t contacted him either. Dean tried not to take it personally since his reason for not at least texting Cas wasn’t personal in the least but damn it was hard anyway.
No, Cas looks up just as the coffee maker beeps. No, just remembering Dean’s sweet sounds and desperate touches makes Cas certain that the boy at least hasn’t been faking his attraction. And now that he thinks about it, Dean basically admitted to it all the way back last year when he came to visit Cas after the Halloween party. But Cas had been too stubborn to listen, or to even dream it could be true. Or, for that matter, prepared to accept it if it had been true.
“And nothing,” Dean pulled out, sitting back so that they could look each other in the eye. “I wanna prep you. Missionary and let me do everything.”
Proud that his voice didn’t waver, he stopped just before he should’ve started up the slope and opened his pants. He was nervous, wasn’t about to lie about that, but it also felt good to do something about his jumbled thoughts. Of course, he thought as he pulled out his soft dick, if he got the response he wanted, it might still not mean what he hoped it would. But one step at a time.
The creature’s eyes widened when Castiel took a bite out of the apple, chewing excessively to show how okay the treat was to eat and to his amusement, the creature actually licked its lips. Unlike all demons Castiel had met so far, this creature’s tongue wasn’t forked, and it looked much pinker as it darted out to slide along the creature’s full lips.
“Hopefully an accurate one.” Cas mutters, expression unreadable. He raises his wand, high enough so that it parallels his face. Dean copies the action, and together they turn and march to the opposite ends of the stage.
Jack leans back with the air of an accomplished marathoner when he finishes, staring down at his handiwork as though by sheer effort of looking his work will be great. Dean shifts the paper round.
“The Owlery, actually. I was sending Jess a letter about what happened today. She’s been asking me to keep her updated.”
He finds Cas out by the lake. A silhouette stood against the careful outline of the water, drawn in from thousands of years of mother nature calling the shots. He’s using a
This time, Castiel is on board, laughing along with him. "Yeah. Gotta say, that was creative, babe."
"Excuse me?" Dean barks. He comes forward until he's in between Jimmy and the stranger. "You can leave now. Whoever this Castiel person is, it's not Jimmy."
“You have permission to come whenever you’re ready.” Castiel doesn’t acknowledge him, too focused on fucking back on the beads now. They’re thick enough to use mostly like a dildo, except these are probably rolling perfectly over Castiel’s prostate. Which he’s pretty damn sure is happening because Castiel has quickly gone from panting and moaning to squeaking and crying.
Dean finally releases the laugh he was holding, making sure it's soft and fond instead of mocking. He doesn't want to discourage Castiel from going out on a limb about things like this,  even if he is always adorably awkward about them.
The snorting-scoffing sound that comes from Castiel makes Dean’s heart sing. “I think that’s a little dramatic, but yes, we can eat first. The bedroom isn’t going anywhere.”
It’s like the holy grail, but with a catch - the catch being that it’s made of a delicate crystal that can shatter with one wrong move.
I nod in understanding, thinking of my own father binge drinking every 4th of July. Though, John Winchester takes almost any excuse to binge drink, so that's not saying too much.
The sub is being held with his back to his dom's front, secured in place by his dom's possessive hand wrapped around his throat. His face is turning red and no sound escapes from his wide-open, useless mouth.
“Yet?” Castiel tightens his grip on Dean’s body, fingers digging into his sides in a possessive but non-harmful way. “Promise it’s a yet?”
, ignoring his sobs and head shakes and slurred pleading. He hits him until all but the clamps on his nipples are free. Then he runs the tip of whatever it is he's been using along the curve of one of Castiel's pec. It's a threat. Castiel feels it in his
“Well, depends on what your definition of stuff is, but yes. I assume The Edlund Institute  would want you to be attending in person."
He accidentally says that. He says it’s not fair. He didn’t fucking mean to, but it falls from his mouth anyway.
“Will you let me step in and be your dominant for tonight? Will you surrender your control to me? Every other decision from this point forward belonging to me and only me?”
"Yeah. I know you do. Such a good boy for me. Remembers my pleasure is what matters. You're lucky I'm even letting you be here for this. Be a part of it. This is nice of me, isn't it?"
The man chuckles, then spits a glob of red spit at Dean. It doesn’t even make it halfway to him. Dean just looks at the drop on his floor in boredom before slowly dragging his gaze back to the man. “Seriously, asshole. Let’s just get this shit over with.”
“No talking.” Sir swats his ass hard enough to make Castiel yelp. “I wasn’t asking your opinion, boy. Merely musing. You’re just a toy right now. Something here for my entertainment. Do you think I talk to my toys, Castiel? Do you think I ask them their opinion?”
Panic wells up in my chest, making me tremble. I try to find the last thing I can remember. There was trying on clothes with Uncle Bobby. For… a date. A date with Cas. We went to a restaurant. He’s never seen
As Dean finishes drying his hair, he stands a few steps inside the room and takes it all in. It’s different than he imagined - though he shouldn’t be surprised. The whole house has been different than expected with its open concept and light colors and windows everywhere. Even the playroom was different than anything Dean ever saw at the compound. Castiel did a good job at carving out a place for them that was like a breath of fresh air. The bedroom is no different.
Castiel nods, yawning again. He thinks that they’ve been walking for a very long time. Forever. He can’t stay awake any longer. Dean will just have to deal with him falling asleep in his arms. It’s not like it’s Castiel’s fault. Dean’s the one walking like a damn sloth, after all.
at anything, Sammy." Sam just scoffs. "And I thought you hated him because of what he had done to me.”
Jumping over said door that’s now shattered on the floor, I howl to my pack to get their attention and begin to run in the direction of Dean. I’m going to find him. I know I am.
Feeling my cheeks go hot, I try to recover, stuttering through a response. “I - yes. Yeah. Photos. I take… photos.”
Before Castiel can argue - because he’s not, there’s no way he’s anywhere near good enough for sir - sir is talking again, dragging his hand up the right side of Castiel’s body. “I saw you just now. Saw the panic in your body. But you did so
“Yes, so omegas - it’s like puberty, kind of. When an omega becomes of age where they could bear children, they present. Until an omega is presented, you can’t tell they’re omega. So, my sister Anna for instance - there was a possibility that she was omega. We knew right away she wasn’t a shifter because shifter kids start shifting around 3 or 4 years old. But until she hit puberty, there was no telling if she would be a human or an omega.”
Sure enough, just a few seconds later, he’s leaning on my door frame and smirking. I glare at him. “I’m not going.”
Castiel makes it clear for him. “Yes, of course we love you, Benny. Who else will provide us with decades of future entertainment, right babe?”
Castiel scans the man, taking in the black suit with the black undershirt and the black tie. Dark. So irresistibly dark. Dangerous. Sexy as all hell. Dean doesn’t seem affected at all by Castiel, though. He almost looks bored as he leans against the railing and assesses him.
As he strolls back over to Castiel, he asks, “If you're so afraid then why are you still here, tied up and at my mercy?”
"What about the other clothes, sir?" Castiel asks when his sleepy eyes fall on the clothes the tailor had picked for him to try on.
Just as the judges on the cooking show Dean is watching are making a decision on who to eliminate, he’s attacked. Apparently, Dean is losing his touch, because he hadn’t even noticed that Castiel was coming at him. One second, he’s entranced by what Gordon Ramsay is saying. The next, Castiel Novak is dive-bombing him. Dean grunts when the boy hits, but then he realizes it's not a violent attack. It's a hug. Dean’s being hugged, arms tight around his neck and legs squeezing on the outside of Dean’s thighs.
"It's under control. He'll come around." When Sam says nothing to this, Dean looks at him again. Sam is giving Dean his classic bitch face. "I made the deal, Sam. I can't go back on it. Novak wouldn't allow it. This is
“Sir,” Castiel says quietly, hands coming down to rest on his hips. “Please, can you – I’d like you to call me sir, if you’re willing.”
“It wouldn’t be like that. You could pay me if you really wanted to be stubborn.” I smirk when he gives me a well-I-wouldn’t-go-that-far look. “I’m just saying, it’s not like I’m super busy here. I don’t mind helping.”
That dark, dangerous laugh returns again. “My men would strip you. Did I mention that? Strip you and douse you in freezing cold water.”
"Fuck no," Dean growls, getting up on his knees and slipping into his training."You're not going anywhere, Jimmy. You stay right here with me. Stay right here. Don’t you die on me you fucker. I’ll kill you, you hear me? Keep fucking breathing.”
The two of us fall into a silence for a while. Surprisingly, it’s my dad who speaks first. Even more surprisingly, it’s about Dean’s dad. “John liked sleeping with me as a wolf, though. I’m sure Dean will too. Apparently we’re like a fluffy, warm body pillow.”
He hurries out of the room and into the first bathroom he can reach, feeling on the edge of hyperventilating.
“Fuck. Look at you. Takin’ it so well, boy.” Castiel turns his face and hides it against his bicep. It’s adorable. Dean will let it slide for tonight, since the boy is so new, but pretty soon he’ll make damn sure his embarrassed little flustered sub keeps his face where his dom can appreciate it. “One more, I think. Hmmm?”
"Yeah. I mean, I was obviously going to ask to talk to you or see you, but he beat me to it. Said I'm the only one who seems to give a fuck, and that means I get to stay a part of your life."
When Castiel hears the soft buzzing, he begins. "You're lucky I'm not there, pet. Your ass would be red already."
Dean’s heart stops. He’d ask Castiel to repeat himself, convinced he didn’t hear right, but Dean’s hearing is phenomenal.
“We’ll go home now. I’ll bring you to our wing. I’ll walk you to the playroom. Strip you. Have you kneel. Explain everything I plan to do to you. Then do them.”
Legs shaking in anticipation, Dean hurries back into the living room to deliver sir’s drink. He almost stumbles to the ground when he sees what’s waiting for him. His sir’s cock is standing free and proud, sir gently stroking it as his eyes stay focused on the bee documentary. Dean’s so thrown off that he has to try twice to put the glass of scotch down without spilling.
He also didn't expect to care this much. Castiel is practically a stranger. Just a boy that now lives with him. A boy who is clearly hurting.
Castiel types Aleksandr Belov, Moscow. 9,280,000 results appear on the screen. Google informs them that it only took 0.66 seconds to find them all.
“Who?” Dean whispers as he leans forward. He’s convinced it’s the two people sitting in front of him that said this because it was too loud to have come from far away.
, sir." Castiel moans as he tosses his head back, slim hips frantic as they work his cock against Dean. "Wanna be good. Always wanna be good for you."
** Warning for some under-negotiated consensual non-con play that occurs between our boys. Also, Dean might torture a bad guy... using some unconventional methods...
Castiel follows his instructions to the T, refusing to be even slightly bratty or disobedient. Not when his orgasm is on the line. Ever since he was edged - or, more accurately, and humiliatingly, edged
Sirs laugh is fond but Castiel recognizes a hint of cruelty beneath it that doesn't bode well. "Oh no, no, no. You won't be doing that at all tonight. Best not to dwell on it. We don't want a grumpy boy at dinner, do we?"
"We are! We talked almost constantly the last 2 days about this. About going slow and starting fresh and building something different than what we had before. How do you expect to do that with you downtown, nearly an hour away from the house?"
Benny brings Castiel to the men’s bathroom off in the corner, rubbing circles on his back and whispering soft assurances about Dean coming soon and everything being okay. Every pass of his hand makes the ropes beneath Castiel’s tux shift against his skin. It’s good. Grounding. He closes his eyes once they’re alone and breathes deeply, letting himself sink into the safety of belonging to Dean Winchester.
Hooking my thumbs in his underwear, I begin to push them down until they’re around his ankles. He clings to my shoulders to steady himself as he steps out of them. Then I have a naked, dripping cock in front of me, and it’d be a fucking shame to waste it.
“I know, baby. I know exactly what you need.” Castiel presses his cock into the space between Dean’s thighs, grinding against him. His tip pokes at Dean’s ballsack, making the boy groan and throw his head back. With lazy thrusts forward, Castiel continues massaging Dean’s perineum and teasing his balls with his cock.
He knows it's wrong. Dirty. Weird. Perverted. But Castiel still finds himself sitting with his back to the wall of the hallway, just inches from the playroom door.
“Hurts, sir,” Castiel whispers, focusing on the way the teeth feel against his skin. “Sharp. Then - then kinda throbs.”
The man’s eyebrows pull in. “What do you mean?” he asks, slowly standing up from his chair. He strolls over to the desk/mini-bar.
“Are you gay?” Anna asks before making a grunting sound. I look up just as Charlie is pulling her hand away. She clearly just hit her friend. They stare at each other in silence for a moment, seeming to communicate somehow, before Anna turns to me with an apologetic smile. “That was rude. I didn’t mean to rip you out of the closet or anything. You totally don’t have to answer that.”
Dean smiles softly, feeling butterflies in his stomach. What a silly thing to get so worked up about. Not that he cares. He just cares that he’s finally with Castiel again. He can finally breathe. He has this possibility in his hands that he could be free but still be happy.
“You’re very welcome, pet.” Castiel retakes his seat and places a gentle hand on the crown of Dean’s head. He gently runs his fingers through his pet’s hair, smiling when the boy’s eyes slide closed in relief. “Is my pet overwhelmed tonight?”
“Hmmm, fingers or toy then, I suppose. Since my boy has been so good.” Goosebumps erupt along Castiel’s skin. Dean’s not sure he’ll ever get tired of seeing what just his praise alone can do to his beautiful boy. “Does my toy have an opinion?”
“I used to feel really itchy in the city. Like I didn’t belong. But here… I feel like I’m home.” He shakes his head, pure confusion in his eyes as he seemingly pleads with me for something. I wish I knew what. I’d give it to him in a heartbeat. “Isn’t that weird, Castiel? To feel like that?”
Castiel leaves the doors open, allowing the ocean breeze to fill the house as he hurries down the steps and across the sand. He must make too much noise because Dean turns to look at him about halfway through Castiel's relieved jog. His smile is brilliant. "Good morning, sleepyhead."
. We had been talking about it, and it just sort of happened because I was still thinking about it, and I’m sorry. It was weird or whatever. It clearly upset you, so I’m really sorry.”
Listening to Dean get pleasured by someone else hurts worse than Castiel could have imagined. It yanks him out of the blank, detached mindset he had been in all day and plunges him straight into a whirlwind of confusion, pain, and grief.
It suddenly occurs to Castiel that sir knows this information about the kidney death from personal experience. And, considering sir is not in fact dead, his personal experience was on the killer side of the knife. He doesn’t know why this strikes him so hard, it’s not worse than watching the man commit murder just a little while ago, but it gets to him differently. His heart begins to race. His palms go sweaty.
“I don’t know.” Dean rests his arms on the balcony railing and hangs his head. “I don’t know what happened. I don’t know what I did. Last night was - god, Char, it was everything. We scened, and he did so fucking good. He was amazing. And I - fuck, I think I love him, Char. I think I really fucking love him. He even asked if maybe we could do dom and sub 24/7. It was like a fucking dream it was so perfect.”
Dean lifts his head, blinking a few times before focusing on Ash and Charlie, his co-heads of security and tech. “Sorry, what was that?”
“Okay.” Dean sucks air through his teeth. “I’m so thankful you told me about your struggles with your depression and anxiety, and the fact that you opened up to me about your suicide attempt was amazing, but I was hoping to find out more about it.”
Trying to shake off the awkward silence that has fallen over them, he looks at the woman he’s been chatting with and points towards the security area. “Um, I’ll see you on - on the other side, okay?”
The shuddery breath that fills Castiel's ear makes him grin. He pulls himself free of his underwear and begins to casually stroke himself as he listens to the sounds of Dean obeying him.
It feels good to be confident again. Dean isn’t used to being so unsure of himself. Suffice to say, he hated it.
He doesn’t stop until Castiel is just hanging there, head limp between his shoulders, the only sounds coming from wheezing breaths.
strums through the pack threads. Every member of the pack starts sending things back, warming my chest with
Then he says something that knocks the breath out of Dean's chest because it's not teasing. It's genuine. Serious. "Yes, sir."
Castiel feels ready to burst by the time Dean’s bare feet come into his line of vision. He glances up just enough to see that his boyfriend is in a pair of soft, faded jeans that hang low on his hips, showing that he’s clearly not wearing underwear. He’s shirtless. He’s freshly showered, too, his hair damp and a little wild.
"I don't like being a burden," I accidentally admit. God, I need to get some sleep. Clearly I'm losing it. "I have no idea why I said that. Sorry."
Someone walks by and their elbow bumps into the back of Castiel’s head. Castiel gets pushed forward and rage flares in Dean’s mind. He whips around and stares at the asshole that did it, who doesn’t look sorry at all.
“Yeah. But not online classes, so don’t bother. Studying music without being in person is just stupid.”
Dean cups Tammy's chin and tilts his head back. Then he swipes his tongue over his cheeks, licking his tears. Castiel bites down on his bottom lip, swallowing a moan. Tammy doesn't swallow his. He lets it loose, the sound low and needy.
Seeing no reason why not, I agree and begin following her to her table. I'm only a few steps away when I see who is sitting there. Honestly, I probably should have seen it coming. She was at the football game with him. I had seen them talking in the halls. He gives her rides to school.
“Good boy.” Dean grabs one of Castiel’s ass cheeks and lifts, then pushes his weight forward so he’s hovering over him. The movement sends Dean in the final inch so he’s bottoming out. Dean hangs his head between his shoulders, trying to keep control of himself. Trying to remember this is a virgin beneath him. A nervous, innocent, beautiful virgin that he loves. That loves
Castiel shudders. He gags, tongue sticking out, but nothing comes up. It’s almost worse. The dry heaving hurts. His muscles ache. His body is shaking uncontrollably. Even though Dean is still whispering that he’s okay, apologies continue to pour from his mouth in between sobs.
He can’t fucking wait to be it with Castiel by his side. Or, ideally, naked and writhing beneath him.
“Probably. But I’m doing pretty okay in that department.” Castiel’s cheeks burn. “So… um… a thing happened last night.”
when it’s consensual though. Only when I’m paired with a masochist who fucking loves it. I don’t - I’m not the kind of sadist who wants a sub that hates pain. I don’t get off on them suffering for me, I get off on them suffering
Everyone looks at him, then each other, with wide eyes. It’s Garth that feels confident enough to speak. “A little lame, sir.”
He lifts a palm and sends Lucifer flying just as Lucifer had done to the love of his life. Then he's shattering through that invisible wall and cradling Dean's face, that familiar blue glow emanating from his skin and seeping into Dean's. It only takes a few seconds but to Castiel it feels like centuries.
“But,” Castiel stops himself, biting his bottom lip and shaking his head. His eyes fall closed and his shoulders sag.
Castiel holds perfectly still, staring wide eyed behind his blindfold. He holds his breath until his lungs threaten to burst. Then he releases it all in a gush of air and asks, “Sir?”
He walks away, still grinning at her before looking forward finally. Another agent is holding up a water bottle, just a few feet to his right. She’s yelling for all to hear, “Folks, please, don’t let me have to say this again, No liquids, pull out your laptops, cell phones, pocket change, shoes, please.”
Dean had mentioned earlier that he had wanted to cook them a meal for their first full day together in the house. Castiel’s shopper wouldn’t have known what Dean wanted to cook. Therefore, Castiel’s fridge isn’t adequately stocked.
“No, you’re right. Not nearly enough. But damn, you look good, Dean. Healthy.” Castiel pauses, his right hand ghosting over Dean’s rib cage that still slightly shows beneath his skin. “Healthier,” he corrects.
“I would have corrected you. Instead of saying ‘okay’, you would have had to say ‘yes, sir’. But you are not my sub. This is just for me to help you. No big deal, Castiel, I swear. It just felt natural for a second there.”
Hey all! I've been awful with replying to comments but I'm slowly getting to them (I love every one, they make my day so much brighter whenever I get the chance to read through them <3 Thank you so much!) I can't wait to read the comments from this chapter (;
They start walking away, the woman following. The same worker who cleaned up the flour earlier starts to clean up the mess they left behind.
Dean hides a smile behind his hand and reminds himself that Castiel is probably having a really hard time, even if it is funny from the outside, and he should be nice. Once he has himself under control, he guides Castiel to a cart like he’s introducing him to a dangerous wild animal. Once Castiel’s hands are curled around the metal bar of the cart, Dean steps back and encourages, “Go ahead and push it. Try to pay attention so you don’t run into people, okay?”
"I can't believe you knew I'd want something like this." Dean laughs softly and rolls his eyes. "That's a lie. I
- promise I'm going to be okay. Other things are said. The door closes, then opens, then closes again. I tune it all out and focus on the steady pressure of fingers against my nape. When they leave my skin, I whimper and try to chase them.
They quickly get to a desk off to the side and Dean smiles at the woman working behind it in an elegant black dress.
I want a partner. Someone to be there when I'm watching movies on a rainy night. Someone to listen when I talk about something funny that happened at work. Someone to cook dinner with as we laugh and dance to music on the radio. Someone to hold at night.
"Mmm." When he slowly blinks his eyes open, planning to say goodnight as he looks Castiel in the eye, Dean sees something else instead. The ocean, through the large glass doors of the bedroom, is in his line of sight, the moon reflecting off it.
Dean can’t help but smile just at the mention of his fiance, lover, and submissive's name. Well… hopefully submissive. “Actually, the boy is Castiel. We’ve been… trying things out.”
“I’m so sorry,” I say quietly. “It’s all my fault. I looked away. I knew other wolves were there and I looked away.”
“NO!” I scratch at his hand, trying to claw him off of me. He just holds tighter. “Let me go! I want to go home! I’m not doing this! I’m not gonna be some fucking - some breeding mare for you sick fucks!”
I frown at him, not sure how he can be so damn relaxed when we’re talking about our future together. “Do you want to be my mate?”
He feels Castiel’s eyes settle on him. They don’t leave when the waiter asks Castiel what he’d like. After a much longer pause than necessary, Castiel says, “I’ll have an iced tea with lemon.”
"Do you want me to just placate you, or do you want to know the gross reason why we know you aren't pregnant?"
"Then I suppose some convincing is in our future." Taking advantage of his private strip of beach, Castiel let's go of the blanket and rolls them over, so Dean is resting on it, staring up at Castiel hovering over him. "I'd love to fuck you next to the ocean."
Dean stands on the sidewalk outside the café, staring at the building like he’s never seen a place to eat before. To give himself some credit, though, this place isn’t exactly just a restaurant. It’s some sort of art gallery too. He let Castiel pick it out, figuring he’d know better since he spent most of the past two years in Seattle. Leave it to Castiel to pick some fancy place when all Dean would want is a damn burger.
“You were stroking me,” Dean finishes for him. He feels on the verge of either bursting into tears or laughing hysterically. “It was you, wasn’t it? The person who kept stroking me?”
“Maybe-” We get our answer before Jack finishes his thought when Dean stops at Benny Lafitte’s locker. The growl is vibrating inside my throat before I even realize what’s happening. Jack’s hand that’s suddenly squeezing my elbow is the only reason I don’t lunge down the hall, knock Benny out, and pin Dean against the nearest surface to claim him.
“I’m a good boy!” Dean shouts. “I’m - I’m a good boy because - because I - ummm… shit - I do my best to make you happy, sir!”
"No, it was yesterday! It happened right over there. You came in and we fought. I showed you the picture. You asked what I wanted from the store. I said more of my cereal, and then you left."
“Cas is the only person who matters.” He squeezes my knee. “And if anyone gave you a hard time about wearing whatever it is you end up wearing, I’m pretty sure your werewolf boyfriend will deal with them.”
Before Castiel can figure out what to do in such a high stakes crisis, Dean swoops in. He goes down on one knee, his arms flying in the air as his eyes widen. “Woah! You went KABOOM!”
“Yeah.” Dean releases another one of those airy laughs that’s not fully of humor in the least. “Right after hitting me and asking if I cried for you like I cried for him, or if it was different with you since you’d fuck me after.”
“Please, don’t finish that,” Dean says with a desperation in his voice that makes him sick. “It doesn’t matter what you do, anyway. None of it matters. If it’s not him that ruins us, it’s Sam. Or Bobby. Or anyone in this whole fucking town, since they all despise you from what they’ve heard in the rumor mill.”
His knees jerk, eyes brimming with immediate tears. "Gabe," he gasps, the breath very close to a relieved sob. "I miss you."
“I’d like you to go into the playroom, strip and place your clothes where I showed you - neatly - and kneel for me. Keep your eyes on the ground, mouth shut, until told otherwise. I’ll be there soon.”
kind of rich. The mansion is twice the size of Castiel's, and it doesn't just have an outdoor pool and garden, but a yard that goes further than Castiel can see as well.
“The nightmares are back,” Castiel finally says after sitting silent in the room for 21 minutes. He doesn’t raise his eyes. Doesn’t look at the man in front of him. He just continues to sit forward, elbows on his knees, staring at his favorite swirl in the paisley rug between them.
Someone touches my ass cheek again, stroking me. I try to buck away but I’m held down too well. The other man walks around to the front so I can see his face. It’s Alastair. The creep from the football game. He’s here. He has me. Naked. Tied down. He’s a wolf. I’m an omega.
No one on the app tonight is interesting. They're all taller than Castiel, or larger. No one has messy black curls that would feel like silk in his fingers. No one has wide blue eyes.
A hand grips his bicep tight enough for Dean to hiss through his teeth, yanking him back and forcing him to stop walking. When he makes eye contact with Sam, he wishes he hadn't. His brother is disgusted.
"You'd be a great father, Cas. I know it. But if you’re paranoid about it, the surrogate can use my sperm. Or we can adopt.” Dean finds himself smiling. “There are so many kids out there to adopt, Cas. It’s harder for couples like us but-”
. Dean starts to scramble to his feet before remembering to be slow and graceful. Just as he reaches for his shirt, Castiel changes his mind.
This makes Dean laugh. The sound is low and soft but full-bodied as well. It’s beautiful. “It’s okay not to know. What’s more important is that I can give you those two ways of grounding you in our playroom, plus give you the pleasure you need, all without you having to hurt yourself like that.”
“Fuck you,” Castiel growls. He can feel the slow trickle of precum as it slides down the slight curve of his hard, bobbing cock.
“Yes, please.” Dean bows his head so it can be secured at the back of his neck, holding perfectly still for him. When it’s fully locked into place, he lifts his head again to look at Castiel. His fingers start to come up to touch it, but Castiel catches his wrist and squeezes once.
Castiel can’t decide if he wants to turn the boy over, spank his ass raw, and then fuck him until he passes out, or if he wants Dean to do exactly what he’s threatening because it sounds fucking hot despite the fact that it fucking
“It would never work.” Castiel sniffles. “I had such a hard time because of mom and dad. Every time I looked at Dean, I heard their voices in my head. Every time I looked at his friends, every time I tried to kiss him. And then sometimes I’d forget and it’d be like it was before for a moment, and then boom, I’d remember. I’d remember that mom and dad told me I don’t get to keep him. They told me I can be with him until graduation and then it’s over. How do I let myself kiss him and be happy with him when I know that’s what’s coming for us? When I know it’s doomed?”
“I don’t want to be a burden.” Castiel looks down at Dean’s chin, unable to meet his gaze. “I don't want you to get sick of dealing with me.”
The two of them collapse against the bed, Castiel still buried inside of him so that they're turned on their sides spooning. When they've caught their breath, Castiel presses a tender kiss to the crook of Dean's neck and asks, "You okay, beautiful?"
“Yeah.” Castiel runs a hand along Dean’s bare ribcage, smiling when it makes him shiver. “Am I a masochist?”
But… that’s not a safeword, and Dean didn’t remove the lace from his mouth, but all Castiel can do is whine in frustration.
All of that freedom is fine and dandy, but now Dean feels frozen on the sidewalk, unable to take that first step. He could really use Castiel beside him right now. A strong hand on the small of his back to guide him. His soft voice whispering to Dean about this or that, taking his mind off the anxiety he feels as he watches all the people – So. Many. People. – swirl around in the chaos of the city.
This is perfect. Dean doesn’t want anything more tonight than stripping down to his boxers and t-shirt and sliding under the covers with Castiel to get a full night’s sleep. Nighttime has been his favorite lately. Ever since Castiel was sick, getting super clingy and cuddly, the boy gravitates to Dean in his sleep. The second he’s not awake to fight it, Castiel’s wrapped around Dean’s body in no time, clinging to him like his life depends on it. Dean’s obsessed. Just that alone is like his new favorite drug.
Castiel shakes his head, looking back at Dean as if he can see through his blindfold. Part of Dean wants to take it off him so he can fully take his boy’s beauty in, but Dean knows better. It’d be a distraction at this point. Something Castiel would have to take the time to adjust to. They’re already so close to the finish line, Dean doesn’t want to pull Castiel away from the edge like that.
"Sorry," Castiel gasps. His vision is blurring despite the blindfold. He hadn't known darkness could blur. "S-sorry, sir."
When they’re both clean, Dean leads Castiel into the bedroom. He doesn’t mention the idea of getting dressed. Neither does Castiel. He just remains quiet, allowing Dean to guide him to Castiel’s side of the bed, pushing down gently on his shoulder to make Castiel sit. Dean reaches for the burgundy throw that seems to be Castiel’s favorite, wrapping it around his shoulders and helping pile the extra fabric over his lap and legs. Bright blue eyes look up at him, glassy with a sleepy happiness.
Castiel lays back against Dean’s chest in the tub, allowing his eyes to close. He’s been hand-fed chocolate and given water through a bright pink bendy straw. He’s had his muscles massaged and his hair washed. The panic has begun to fade. It’s still there, the anxiety throbbing in the back of his mind with a steady
Castiel’s eyebrows pull in, making something on his forehead crinkle and pull at his skin. He slaps at it with a hand before yanking it off. The wrinkled sticky-note is bright yellow. Castiel grins like an idiot when he reads the words hastily scrawled across it.
“Promise me,” he says instead of responding. “Promise me you’ll stay away from them. I need you safe.”
Castiel hurries toward the other side of the kitchen, where there's a hall that leads to the personal wing. He's actually getting this place memorized, surprisingly. Castiel only got lost twice today.
"He's not listening," Dean assures. Castiel is way too out of it to care about them right now. The most Dean has gotten out of him is a mumbled, "No, comfy," when Dean forced him to get dressed, and a whiney, "Bun?" as he snuggled in closer after enduring the horrible torture of said dressing. Dean had promised that a blanket and his bunny were in the car waiting for them - an idea Dean is damn glad he had earlier. That had been enough for Castiel to sigh happily and sink into Dean's hold, eyes falling closed again.
, his fate at sir's mercy. "His cock, sir. With the - the pliers." Castiel shudders, but not in disgust. He's sick. He knows he is.
“It’s enough. It’s everything.” Dean looks at Castiel, shaking his head in disbelief. “You’re everything.”
"Stand up for me again, pet." Dean silently follows the order. Castiel walks around him so he's standing in front of Dean. Dean's eyes settle on Castiel's bare feet and remain there. He can tell by the way his freckled nose keeps twitching though that Dean's actively fighting the urge to look up at him.
"Because I wanted to know if I could really love someone who does the things you do!" Castiel yells frantically, the words sort of blurring together but clear enough for Dean to hear. "I told myself to be your husband, I - I have to be aware of the monstrous side of you. I won't be someone who is blind to the darker sides of their husband. I don't want a marriage like that. But I didn't- I didn't know if I could handle it. If I could still…
. I had liked that too. I could see myself in that clearing on a full moon, running around with him like a giant puppy, cuddling with him amongst the wildflowers when he needs to take a break. I think I could be happy here, if I did stay.
Dean keeps his hand there until Castiel finally gives in, sighing softly as he lets his eyes close for the final time. Then he pulls away, returning to his own side of the bed, and whispers, “Goodnight, Cas.”
“I’ve seen them, baby. There’s no reason to hide.” Castiel goes perfectly still, his breath catching. He stays tense as Dean removes both gloves. Dean hates it. The look of distress on his boy’s face won’t do at all. He needs to rectify it. Immediately.
“I’m sorry. That was rude.” I look out the window, studying the trees as we pass them. “I shouldn’t have said that.”
Castiel shrugs. “Possibly. As far as I know, Alek never told her, or brought the slaves around her, but she wouldn’t be the first wife to just look the other way and keep quiet.”
“I - but - “ Castiel’s right hand flutters up to his throat, his face once again filling with color. “Sir?”
“Done what?” Dean asks. When Castiel puts the mug down and turns around, drying his hands off with a dish towel, Dean realizes what he means. He gapes at Castiel. “Wait - you’re saying you’ve never gone grocery shopping?”
Dean starts Shrek 2, climbs onto the bed, and straddles Castiel's ass. His calloused fingers skim Castiel's bare back. Dean still can't believe Castiel took his shirt off. Dean said the reward was a movie and a massage. He never mentioned removing clothing. Not that he's complaining.
Castiel can hear Charlie ordering, but he feels like he's floating out of his body. He's pretty sure he's having a panic attack.
“Castiel,” Jack says in a low, controlled voice that’s so out of character for him it sends a pulse of fear to my core.
But the omega ducks his head and walks straight past us. I slowly turn, tracking his every step. They feel like they echo in my chest.
Dean laughs, shrugging. “We could. You’re more than welcome to. I’m just sayin’. This place has great burgers. And milkshakes. If you get pancakes, you gotta at least order a milkshake.”
“No. No wolf picture on my camera this morning.” I shrug despite the fact that my eyes are starting to burn. It almost feels like I’m grieving the wolf. It’s the most ridiculous thing, but I can’t help it.
“Sammy’s roommate, yeah.” Dean wipes his hand on the apron before offering it to me. His smile is dazzling. Bright white teeth. Soft pink lips. They’re glistening as if he just licked them. I wonder what they taste like. I bet they’re good. I bet they’re damn good. “It’s great to finally meet ya.”
"I guess that's okay, then. It was nice being him. At first I was afraid to let go like that, but once I did, you're right… I was weightless."
Castiel clears his throat twice before feeling steady enough to speak. His voice still comes out raw and scratchy. “Dean wants kids.”
and winks at him. Then he goes in for the kill “Third, any possible connection between us is now severed. You aren’t my ally. You aren’t my enemy. You. Are. Nothing. Stay that way.”
One of Dean's fingertips starts to trace the slightly raised outlines of the letters. Castiel holds his breath, unsure of what to say or do. Unsure if he should explain himself further, or apologize, or stay silent. Unsure if Dean likes it or hates it.
After a soft whimper, the boy obeys. "You just got off the phone. And - and you strip down and… uh - and you turn the ma - machine off and push it away and you - you-" his voice gives out. Dean can hear his hand as it moves impossibly fast. He must be close. So damn close.
The two best friends stare at each other. Then Benny arches an eyebrow and threatens, “If he doesn’t know by six tonight, I’ll tell him instead.”
He doesn’t even realize the pain has stopped until a slick finger is massaging his hole. Castiel jerks in surprise before pushing back against it. After all that pain, it feels good. So fucking good.
The submissive look the boy probably has no idea he even has inside himself. The look that exposes who he really is. What he really wants. A look that begs Dean to control him. To take care of him.
Sir moans in his ear, forehead resting on Castiel’s shoulder. “Fuck, that’s - that feels good. You fucking yourself on sir’s cock, making yourself feel good, that’s nice, sweetheart.”
"This here is the master bedroom." Dean removes his hand from Castiel's back. He opens the door and steps inside, waiting for Castiel to join him. The boy looks nervous again.
. “There was more than one reason for us to create the death certificate and new identity for you. It wasn't just your freedom from us being able to track you down ever again, but it was - well, it was proof. The death certificate was proof, not the identity."
When Castiel looks over at Dean, he finds him smiling. “Let’s not get boring here, babe. There’s plenty I plan on keeping. We just started off rough. Come here.”
Then, with a very cautious and skeptical glimpse at Castiel, the boy says quietly, “Sorry for hittin’ you, mister.”
“Yeah,” Jimmy whispers, grinning like an idiot as he sinks into the warm touch. Since he can’t ever remember being held like this in his life, it feels like the very first time. It’s enough to make him a little dizzy. “This is perfect.”
“Did I take advantage of you? Push things too far?” I close my eyes, my body beginning to tremble. “Did I hurt you, sweetheart?”
Just as he’s picking up the toaster - is that really practical at this moment? Nope, but Dean’s kind of sort of still in the middle of a mental fucking breakdown, so he gets a pass - the man in front of him drops to his own knees. The power between them flips. Suddenly, Dean is standing in the place of the master.
let me forget it - is laying on his bed in his bedroom, drawing in his sketchbook. He doesn’t even glance up at me as I enter, just continuing to draw as I plop down on the bean bag chair by his window.
"You're mine!" Castiel suddenly shouts. "There's no reason to be jealous of him. He has to go home now. You'll be in
And now here Castiel is, carefully holding it like it’s precious instead of four dollars. “Do you like it?”
He shakes his head, eyes pleading with Dean as if Dean would just drop the subject out of the goodness of his heart. Those eyes bulge comically when Dean grabs the man's flaccid cock with the pliers. "Do you like playing games, Tammy?"
Dean can’t help but think Castiel’s not really talking about the submissive at all. He has a feeling Castiel is thinking about his own orgasm and when he’ll get to come tonight.
He’s not good enough for someone like Castiel. Out of all the unfair things that Castiel has to endure because of this deal, that’s by far the worst. Castiel deserves so much better.
“Can you take a drink for me?” Castiel asks softly, helping Dean sit up before putting the bottle to his lips. Dean takes a gulp. Then another. “Good boy. Such a good boy for me.”
Then a sound comes from Castiel’s left. He startles, sucking in his breath and holding it as he waits. His ears buzz with the strain of trying to hear noise where there is none.
“I do too.” I take a chance and look at him again. “So, Bobby caught us this morning. Sort of. He didn’t
The reaction in Dean is instant as Castiel pulls him from reality back down to the mindset from before. His whole body shudders, his ass squeezing Castiel’s cock, as he groans the best he can without much air.
Without Castiel's permission, at least 5 layers of anxiety melt away the moment his mind registers the words. He quickly lowers his chin to look at the ground and says in a much steadier voice, "Good morning, sir."
. Then - then those guys showed up. One of them the same creep from the football game. Castiel got mad. So mad.
Apparently, Castiel doesn't have the same fear because when Dean glances over a few minutes later, he sees that Castiel's glass is already almost empty.
"I just enjoyed another gift of yours," Dean says casually, pulling Castiel in closer until the boy's head is tucked beneath his chin. He sways slightly under the pretense of still dancing. "Tamiel, I believe was his name."
“I - wha -” Castiel looks down at his tail, which is wiggling even more now. His face goes red. Then the rest of his body begins to turn the same color. He ducks his head and half-mumbles, half-whines, “Alpha, don’t laugh. It’s
“Maybe, if you’re a really good boy for me, I won’t make any of your pretty pale skin match the rest of you. Though, I’ll be honest with you, I’m sort of hoping I get the chance to do that. I think making you red all over would be quite satisfying.” Just in case, Castiel doesn’t understand exactly what Dean means by that, Dean muses out loud, “I wonder what you’ll end up liking better, the paddle or the whip.”
There's a small table full of instruments by the body. Dean hovers his hand over them, considering. There's a pack of cigarettes and a lighter in the corner, most likely Benny's. He always smokes when he's doing something dark or dirty. It's been a long time since Dean last smoked, but something feels right about it tonight. He places a cigarette between his lips and uses the lighter to ignite the tip, sucking poison into his lungs and holding it there for a few seconds before expelling it.
in some states if they don’t cooperate enough with the authorities on information regarding the operations involved in their cases? Even if they don’t know a damn thing. And it’s nearly impossible for them to be protected by the government. The cops ring them out for information, then leave them all alone out to dry. If Dean had been a normal survivor, if he had escaped on his own or something to that extent, the government wouldn’t have helped him hide from us. From Jimmy. No fake identities. No security. Even if he had given them information, it’d be hard for him to get any witness protection. He’d have to have had essential information. Isn’t that fucking ridiculous?”
He prods Castiel back awake and offers him the Gatorade with a bendy straw in it, praising him when he takes a drink. After getting Castiel to take three more sips, Dean offers him some dark chocolate, chuckling softly when Castiel just opens his mouth as an invitation for the food. They continue this for a few more minutes before Castiel pushes his hand away and grumbles against his bunny.
Not when sir hands him a shimmery white mask that reminds him of angel feathers and halos, only for sir to tell him he picked it out since Castiel is
“He’ll be here any minute, and I’m going to let him in no matter what you say or do, so you better get dressed.”
"So?" Dean prods. "You want me to spank you, Castiel? Would you like if I did that some time? Lay you over my lap and spank your cute little ass, then finger fuck you until your ready for my cock?"
"You're back to two hours, and to be extra nice to you, you may fuck yourself on my cock until the video is over." Sir grabs a fistful of Dean's hair and pulls him back just like the dom from the TV. He growls in his ear the same, too. "If you can come by the time the video is over
He double-checks that Castiel is still happy and floating, then quickly leaves the main area to get the things he bought his boy. He pulls a Gatorade and some dark chocolate from the fridge, then grabs the basket he made and heads back to the bed. He sets everything on the side table and sits on the mattress to check on Castiel again.
“So,” the man continues, his hands beginning to move along Dean’s back. They’re warm through his flannel. He presses down along his spine, soothing Dean’s sore muscles. “That must have been scary for you and your little brother.”
I arch my neck to the side to expose more of my throat for him, making that purring sound again when his lips skim over those freckles that are so damn sensitive for some reason. I sigh, sinking back against him.
The blue eyed werewolf grins wide before smashing his mouth against mine for a brutal, passionate, searing kiss. He doesn’t pull away until we’re both breathless, and even then it’s only for a second. Just long enough for him to pant, “I love you too.”
“It’s not,” Dean assures him. “It’s dangerous to be. The dominant will have made sure that nothing is being pinched or pulled. That nothing is tingling or going numb. And the submissive will immediately safeword if any of those things changes.”
The smoke comes again, making Castiel choke and sputter. He jerks in his cuffs and growls, “Fuck you!”
Dean frowns, then forces a smile. “You’re right. It’s the marriage thing. Just, ya know. It’s easier. No having to worry about hurting other people’s feelings or awkward explanations to whoever I’m sleeping with when I walk them past my husband as I lead them to my playroom.”
His brother grabs his laptop and brings it back to the bed. The two of them settle on their stomachs and look at the screen.
Castiel's gut twists painfully at the slip. Even if Dean had caught himself, it's proof that a part of Dean is still ingrained with the lessons he was taught at the compound. A part of his sweet, perfect boy is still living in fear of the master Castiel used to be. He knows it's wishful thinking to hope one day Dean can forget about the monster who held that title, but it doesn't make it any easier to hear the reminder of that.
Castiel doesn't say a word until Dean is done. As Dean reaches for the other washcloth, intending to clean himself, Castiel asks, "Can I?"
Castiel bites the inside of his cheek, trying to fight his amusement. He’s not amused at this information. He’s just amused at his best friend’s sudden passion. Sam Winchester seems to have given Gabriel quite the stir.
went to Denver. Even when he had to miss my birthday once. Even though he cried so hard, felt so guilty, as I promised him we’d just celebrate it when he got back. It was important for dad to go to Denver. He’d lose his job otherwise.
"Oh, yes. It is." Castiel takes a breath. He can talk about the campus. That's easy. "I loved all the trees. Lots of shade. I could totally see myself just sitting under one, playing my guitar."
Castiel doesn’t know how long he stays there alone, his mind drifting, his senses pinpointed to leather and skin. Then sir’s hand is on him again, starting at his left shoulder and slowly making its way down to his ass cheek. It’s soothing. Steady. Castiel hadn’t realized he was tense before but from the way he melts under sir’s touch, he must have been. “You’re so
“Just be safe. For me.” He takes a deep breath in through his nose and his eyes flutter shut for just a second. Then he gives me a tight smile and backs away. “See ya later, Dean.”
Castiel laughs softly and leans down, pressing his lips to Dean’s. It’s a soft kiss. A little tentative. A little off to the side of his mouth since it’s dark and they haven’t had a lot of practice yet. But it’s perfect.
“Good boy. So good for me.” Castiel feels Dean shift behind him and sucks on the lace in his mouth to… well, he doesn’t know why to be honest. But it seems to calm him so he doesn’t stop. “I’m going to tap you with the paddle first. Show you the texture of it. The weight of it. Okay?”
"You could - I mean, it wouldn't upset me if," he clears his throat, knowing his face is turning red. "If you wanted to bring someone here. For your - uh, your playroom. You could."
Dean says nothing. He won’t break. He refuses. He’s going to draw on every stubborn cell of his body and do so damn good that sir won’t be able to even make him wait another hour. That’ll teach sir to mess with him!
Clamping down on his lip to keep it from trembling, Castiel continues to fiddle with Dean’s sweatshirt strings. Dean gives him the time he needs, staying quiet, just watching him. Every second that tics by makes Dean fall for him even more. Castiel is doing crazy things to him.
He starts to cry as sir presses harder against him. The friction is delicious against his poor cock, but the pressure against his clipped nipples hurts so badly he can't catch his breath.
Castiel hesitates, but follows the order. He moves slowly, and usually, that would annoy the hell out of Dean, but at the moment he's grateful. By the time Castiel is sitting, looking up at Dean with a questioning frown, Dean feels like he's on solid ground again.
In response to Castiel’s warning - which is supposed to be at least a little threatening, considering he’s Dean’s goddamn dominant - Dean sticks his tongue out at him. It makes Castiel grin ear to ear. He stares at the man on the couch with so much admiration and love, his knees go a little weak.
The door creaks open as Castiel’s pants are shoved down to his ankles. It clicks shut as his panties join them. His jacket is tugged off next. Then his shirt is ripped free, buttons skittering across the porcelain sink and tiled floors. Castiel gasps, wondering how he’s going to leave the bathroom now, but then sir grabs the rope knots at his hips and uses them to tug him back so he’s bent even further, his back curving slightly, his ass presented at the perfect height for sir, and his mind is blanking. Sir will take care of everything. He doesn’t have to worry. He just has to be sir’s good boy, something he can totally do.
“I’m from New York. I just moved here a few weeks ago.” I shrug. “For some reason, moving out west in my mind meant deserts and the hot sun.”
Images of Castiel’s cuts and scars flash in Dean’s mind and his gut turns. “Will you tell me when you need to hurt yourself, Castiel?”
"I'm scared too," I admit. "I'm terrified that I'm losing you, Dean. Can you feel it? Is our thread fucked up for you too? I swear, I can feel you slipping right through my fingers."
Despite his cheeks burning red, Castiel keeps going. His breathing is erratic. His stomach muscles are rippling. He’s close to coming, which is hilarious. Dean wonders if the boy forgot the sound, or if he thinks the sound will magically let him come, or if he thinks Dean will take pity on him and take the sound out. He decides to wait and see. He even presses forward, giving the boy more friction. Castiel moans like a cheap fucking whore, his movements growing sloppy and desperate.
“Ummm, a couple? I had a few questions, though.” Castiel chews on his bottom lip as he flips to a page in his journal. His cheeks fill with color again, and Dean finds himself leaning slightly forward in anticipation for whatever Castiel is about to say that caused the reaction. “What is… mummification?”
Dean is sitting on the living room couch. He had changed into jeans and a sweatshirt, hoping to seem more comfortable and laid back for Castiel. Benny had suggested it. The suits can be a little intimidating, especially if it's all Castiel sees.
The words cause pain to twist in Dean's chest, leaving behind an achy burn. "Your life will be your own with me, Castiel. All I ask is you share it. As I plan to share mine."
"One overwhelmed pretty bunny coming right up then," Dean announces. He flashes his fangs at Castiel, his furry gray tail flicking behind him, and the bunny whimpers. He feels slick gush between his butt cheeks but he doesn't have time to be embarrassed. Not when his alpha is manhandling him into a new position that leaves the wolf's alarmingly large cock pressed right up against the bunny's soft cheek.
I start to stand up, but he grabs my wrist and tugs me back down, his laughter loud and booming in the air around us. “I’m sorry. I’ll stop. But you guys did get together, right?”
"Mmm." Sir repositions Castiel's head, then hooks a finger into his mouth and pulls at his bottom lip. "Then show me, slut. Prove it."
I smile at his adorable enthusiasm, nodding. “Sure. Disney movie about dogs eating in an Italian restaurant. Why not?”
. You know I’ve never had that. There’s something between them. You might not be able to see it yet, but you can often tell when a dominant and submissive are in a purely sexual relationship, or if they’re in love, and you can tell with them. The amount of love and trust - it’s… I want that, Cas. With you.”
Castiel doesn’t even know what he wants Dean to add to that. He just wants to make him degrade himself more.
Out of curiosity, Dean keeps his hand there. Even when they stop in the final hall. "My personal office is that door on the very end. It's the one place in this house I would like you to stay out of. The office downstairs is free to you, not that I think you'd find anything there very interesting, considering I'm usually bored myself."
The tools - instruments - that he doesn’t recognize. One looks like a cock cage, but it has extra metal and straps and Dean really hopes it’s not meant to go anywhere near his cock or balls. Another looks like the thing at the dentist’s office that squirts water into your mouth, but a much longer spout that curves slightly.
“I’ll go to the football game and if things get too much, I’ll just come home and skip the party,” I promise my mom, who is standing in the doorway of my bedroom, blocking my exit.
From golden hooks hang various lengths and shapes and types of what must be leather. Some look like a classic whip, though a few take on a weird shape near the ends. Others look almost like a mop, with handles that turn into multiple pieces of leather flaring out. One of them looks just like the others, except instead of strips of leather, it’s strings of beads going in all directions.
Dean just laughs harder, loving how adorable the bun is when he’s flustered and embarrassed. The boy whines and hides his face in the bed. “Alphaaaa.... Stop it.”
“You look freezing.” He frowns. “Let me get my jacket from my car. It’s just parked right here. You can borrow it.”
Dean’s head snaps, locking eyes with him. He opens his mouth twice before closing it and turning away. Castiel worries he messed up. His stomach twists painfully, and the smell of the chocolate just makes it turn worse. He takes the tiniest bite with the tips of his front teeth. It’s not terrible. He manages two more like that before needing a break.
He yelps when something hard comes down against his left ass cheek. There’s no time in between that and the next hit, the second one hitting his right ass cheek. When sir grabs a fistful of his hair to look at him, Castiel is struck with a white-hot surge of anger.
and he proved with excellent grace that he was more than capable of getting off a horse on his own. Dean pulled the bottle of whisky from the saddle bag instead, holding it out for Sam. “I got what I came for anyway.”
The chilly air from yesterday was as if blown away and the forest was filled with the scents of warm moss and dry leaves. Last season’s pine needles crunched under his feet and Dean felt a calm he suspected was less than deserved, considering he was on his way to meet the angel again.
“Holy fuck,” Dean mutters under his breath as he starts undressing with shaky hands. He left his bag out in the hall, just barely conscious enough to lock the door. “Holy
“I’ve wanted this for so long,” Dean says breathily, hands warm as they fish Cas’ hardening dick out of his underwear. “I ain’t gonna be good.”
Kudos to everyone who guessed Dean would befriend a bunny, which a special nod to Latter_Rose and rottentiger!
“Trust is important,” Balthazar nodded, of course realizing immediately where Castiel’s hesitation stemmed from. “Did something change?”
“Wait, yesterday?” Cas turned to Dean, seemed to reach for him without actually physically doing so. Dean shifted on his feet but felt as if they were too heavy for him to step away from Cas’ sudden closeness. “You returned here yesterday? So you hadn’t just kept away from Boldcreek, you went… somewhere entirely?”
There’s a beat of silence and then he feels Dean’s arm around his waist, the man’s warmth seeping in and comforting him.
He exited on that, pie in one hand and a wink thrown at a chortling Missouri in the stand next to Lisa’s.
He leaned closer, even squinted, as if he had bad eyesight. Yes, those were all of his books, that was his name, and student ID, and there, at the bottom in big letters, the date of when the payment had been issued. It was a few days ago but the only thing the date managed was to make him even more confused. He’d been in Lawrence then.
. But they’re both too close now, Dean’s orgasm rushing through him at the feel of Cas’ dick expanding, straining in Dean’s mouth.
and then backhanded Dean straight across the face. Dean’s head snapped back against the wall as new pain bloomed, mixing with the old, and fucking hell this couldn’t be happening.
Suspicious but also curious about Cas’ cryptic tone, Dean went to put on his jacket and boots while Cas changed into the red robin form again and flittered out the chimney.
His whole body heated up and yeah, Castiel had never really been one of those guys who had trouble getting hard when he was drunk. Instead, his body seemed more amped up and if anything, he would be in danger of coming too fast. Except that was usually the case with Dean, wasn’t it?
Dean had shaken his head again, this time to dismiss foolish thoughts, and had left not much later, the hide rolled up to be taken home since he didn’t have a proper saline solution to soak it in. He left the skinned deer along with some of his camping equipment and Cas promised to both eat properly and watch Dean’s stuff.
The force of it makes his knees buckle and he barely has time to turn around to sit on the bed, still in the midst of his orgasm. His body shakes and when he squeezes his dick a little more comes out, pulling out a shiver along with it.
He was about half-finished with his own food when Dean was done almost inhaling the rest and the creature started squirming, eyeing Castiel’s plate as well. His demon eyes flicked in and he licked his lips, that sensual tongue sneaking out and drawing Castiel’s attention.
“I… Yeah.” Dean wobbles when he stands on one foot and he puts his hands on Cas’ shoulders to steady himself.
Sam’s eyes widened and then immediately swept over Dean’s body, as if he was going to spot a life threatening wound he somehow had managed to miss before.
It was easy to find the main hall, not only because there was a humongous sign with the name again but also because of the dazzling lights and soft music coming from it. Dean didn’t know much but he knew that was classical music, like Mozart or that other dude who went deaf, and though he didn’t particularly enjoy it he could admit that it fitted with the theme of the evening.
He eats his lunch alone in the staff cafeteria not because he particularly wants to or because his colleagues don’t want to eat with him but because his phone call with Mrs. Walker dragged on. It’s fine, though, he spends the time on his phone chatting with Meg, his best friend.
Well of course it’s not as simple as that but still, Dean’s always excited when he sits down to do the start-up procedure for another long flight. And he likes it even more since he started flying the big Boeing 777 because those sleeping compartments are
This man was going to fuck Dean’s tight hole and there was nothing Dean found in himself to stop him from doing so.
“What?” the first woman asked, her voice suggestive for some fucked up reason. “That anyone would catch the lie? It’s kinda obvious.”
