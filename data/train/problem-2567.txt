<< You are right. There is absolutely no history >> John says and a twinge pierces his stomach.
He hears noises coming from beyond the door. Steps. Heavy. Affaticati. A continuous muttering, which becomes more and more a chatter as this person reaches the room. Two floors of stairs. He was transported over two floors. As thin as he is, an unconscious body is much heavier than a conscious one.
'I saved her'. This short sentence pronounced by George's immature voice has the power to take John's breath away. Disconnected images of a distant past come overbearing to him. John tries to chase them away, but he can't. His gaze fixed on George, who dried the embarrassed tears that streaked his face. This kid experienced something very similar to what he experienced at his own age. John is very sorry for this. He coughs to swallow the lump that has formed in his throat and tries to ignore Sherlock's gaze on him.
<< A 16 year old girl took her own life, God only knows why, Sherlock. Any human being with a minimum of empathy would be emotionally involved >>.
That was how Mycroft, Hataway and everyone else had found him. John had barely noticed their presence. Di Mycroft, who had approached him, trying in turn to warm his brother's still cold body with his own coat.
<< Leave me! >> Sherlock screams, pushing him away. He begins to hyperventilate and looks up to seek the help of his doctor.
<< It is not >> retorts Sherlock. << Margaret O'Hara has a degree in modern literature >> he says pointing to the degree hanging on the wall. << She  wrote a best seller with a successful publishing house and she won a lot of literary competitions >> Sherlock says, pointing to the awards scattered almost everywhere and some copies of her novels over the desk. << Mr Ford manages a literary circle, where she teaches creative writing. The kidnapper has also took away some handwritten stories from her students. In this drawer we found the registration forms for the creative writing course. I am sure that our kidnapper is one of Mr Ford's students >>.
<< Why shouldn't I have? >> Sherlock retorts, finally showing a reaction.
<< Then Sherlock returned here >>, Greg continues, << and after a while he calls me asking me to join him and who do I find with him? >> he says, turning to his son with an expression between the angry and the worried. << When will you two decide to tell me what is happening? >> asks the detective and Sherlock turns his gaze to John again. He wants that John inform Greg. John, who is much more prepared to give bad news. If had it been anyone else,  Sherlock would have briefed him
<< Sense of guilt. Sense of duty. Another adrenaline-charged mission. This is John doing. It is not me who he seeks. Himself, perhaps, but now I don't care anymore >>.
John does not know what is going inside his partner's belly, but he feels that this case has gone to touch old and out of tune strings. What Sherlock said to William, after Milton's arrest, confirmed John's hypothesis. He would like to ask Sherlock many questions, but he knows he won't ask for anything. John'll wait for him to want to talk, if he'll ever wants to do it, and if he doesn't, it will be fine.
<< Fear of him >> repeats Greg amazed. << That he wanted something more? A recognized relationship? >>.
<< Because London is not my city. I only work there. I am from Manchester, as well as my fiancée >>.
<< You did it big this time. Big big, oooooh yes! >> she exclaims and opens the door of the storage room. Mary grabs Sherlock by the broken leg and throws him inside. << You will stay here to reflect on your sins, ungrateful without god >> she says, kicking the drip that Sherlock promptly grabs and draws to himself a moment before she closes the door, leaving him in the narrow, dusty and dark space of that small room .
John felt the ground collapse under his feet after those words. Sherlock deprived of the opportunity to move to carry on his work does not even want to imagine it. Sherlock life would be characterized by long days of boredom, depression, black mood. He may return to cocaine use and the propensity to suicide that would result.
<< Forget it! >> she retorts, immediately returning serious. << The percentage is the possibility of entering late, exiting early, leave patients in the queue and troubles to colleagues. I would say that is enough, don't you think? >>.
<< Yes, Molly, his fiancée! Edward understood that 'the other' wanted to kill him. He understands everything, looks like a magician! >> informs him amazed. << Edward had said that Molly would find someone else capable of loving her more than he did, but I didn't find him right. Molly would have cried a lot and I didn't want her to cry. Women cry a lot, I always see them on television. So I tried to save him for Molly >>.
<< As always, Greg >> smiles the man, thanking him, bowing his head slightly.
<< Lizzy, stop it >> Greg try to stem her.
<< What? >> asks John, that squints in the direction indicated.
<< I can't believe you don't have even the slightest idea. Three or four always come straight to your minde! >>.
<< Fortunately then you met Molly >> Mary told him at the end of these stories about dreams about John. Sherlock noticed a sadness on Mary's face so deep as to soften him.
<< Good morning, Mary, I'm John Watson. We met in front of Jo's shop a few days ago, I don't know if you remember me >>.
<< Did you realize what you just said, John? >> he asks, his eyes wide that shine in the dark like those of a cat.
<< Ok, ok, I guess I had a bad idea, sorry >> John says hearteningly.
<< You managed to save her. You prevented such a thing from happening to her too. The only thing I don't understand right now is the reason for all this anger >>.
Especially how it can be continued.
"What the fuck is wrong with me?" he asks himself, while, without saying a word, as he usually does since John knows him, Sherlock leaves the apartment quickly descending the stairs. The closing door hits John like a slap in the face.
<< No, nobody >> he says, trying a heart dive for that question and above all for his answer.
<< What do you owe it to? >> asks John amazed. << Shouldn't you already know of it, as everything about your brother and anyone else is under your strict control? >> growls nervously, shifting the weight from one foot to the other.
<< I didn't want to frighten you >>.
<< I do not call social assistance to led the boy to a temporary reception facility, but to protect him. A psychologist will speak with him and the social workers will contact the other family members ... >>.
John thinks about all the times he wanted to punch him. For the parts of the corpse in the fridge, for the continuous leaving him behind, for his silences and the whole days spent on the sofa pouting, for the violin played at the most absurd hours and all the times when he stopped his appointments. John feels guilty for those thoughts, for the curses, for the hatred, sometimes, that he felt towards him, while Sherlock, now, is showing him how sweetly he trusts his hands and entrusts himself to them.
life, sweetness,
William turns to indicate them at his mother. The woman stands up and, hand in hand, they head towards them. Without half measures the woman throws her arms around Sherlock's neck and squeezes him tightly, inundating him with new tears.
<< I understand! Now that even from the coroner's findings on those corpses came out a lot of evidence on how totally crazy she is, why are we still here instead of being already on the way to her house? It has stopped snowing for some time now >>.
<< Then it would be better if I remove this urgency immediately. I may not be so available anymore. I have a diplomatic meeting soon >> says Mycroft, looking at the clock. << Want a ride, detective? >> Mycroft asks Greg, who hesitates about what to do for a few moments before accepting.
John is distraught by Sherlock's silence.  He expected that Sherlock says one of his tipical judgment about the Yards' agents almost with theatrical timing, but nothing. Sherlock looks at him and shakes his head. So John realizes that Sherlock hasn't told Greg yet about the Fenix and all that story.
"You could hit her in the head with something and get rid of her," James suggests him.
<< Why? >>.
John lets himself fall on the mattress, that creaks loudly. Plant his elbows on his knees and take his head in his hands.
<< Don't lie to me, bastard! >> she says, grabbing Sherlock's neck with her free hand. << You, pervert without god! How dare you perform such acts of disgusting lust in my house >>.
<< I imagine that these attentions had to your liking, instead >> the master whispers with a cynical grin. Sherlock chuckles just as cynically and his glance doesn't announce anything good.
<< Captain, I'm afraid you went down heavy with her. If her explodes furiously, all the men present here will not be enough to keep her calm >> whispers Hataway, his worried gaze fixed on the woman.
<< Because I am responsible for everything that happens inside the Spa, including the behavior of my staff. I didn't want you to think I was involved in his crimes I fired Martin immediatly. I would have talk  to you tomorrow, Paul >> says to the chief of the hotel.
"I do not want to. I prefer to take risks. I prefer pain. It was tiring to stop. So tiring ”a silent cry marks Sherlock's face. In tears, he sees Mary's expression change and recognizes the arrival of the little girl.
<< How? >>.
<< Always all the fault of your damned job! >>.
<< I wasn't expecting anything like this when I left Morgan with William >> Sherlock whispers, looking at the road.
Here is Hurricane Margaret. John sees Mycroft slowly close his eyes, sighing before turning his gaze to his brother and his desperate resignation towards mankind.
"Of course you could have warned me," he thinks, going back to the living room. John stops beside his armchair and looks up at the sofa. He must admit to himself that at this time Sherlock has a valid reason for not giving news of himself.
<< Good morning >> greets the boy, by closing the door behind him.
"No. I don't want to steal anything else from you". Without looking back, John reaches the door and leaves the room.
<< If you listened to your intuition, instead of silencing it as always, and if you observing rather than looking, you would understand the reason for what I just said, John >> he replies, addressing him in an unusual way in the presence of a client. << Since my colleague has not understood who you are, can you please introduce yourself? >> he asks the boy, who witnessed that scene incredulously.
"When was this?" asks John, still feeling guilty about misplacing her last letter.
"It seems Mr James was alive to eat breakfast," says Sherlock.
. He can’t say that.
to smoke."
It's overwhelming and still annoyingly unspecific.  Sherlock can't help but long for the easy intimacy they shared in the night: one point of contact, grounding them.  Can't help inviting more.  "You did a good job."  He smiles a little.
Sherlock catches himself staring at John's hand on his arm. John sees it too. But he doesn't remove his hand, doesn't lessen the grip. Instead he lets his thumb massage the muscle, carefully watching Sherlock's reaction.
"You miss him,” she had said, and it was like a blow, but when the air had gone out of him, he could breathe in again, deep.
A long time ago he’d been so sure about what John had wanted from him - cases and casual sex, nothing more. But he could also clearly see the suppression. He soon determined it would have been very unwise to initiate anything sexual. It would have poisoned their relationship. John would want to hide it. And Sherlock couldn’t do that, not with John. He’d grown too attached to him, become sentimental. And they led a dangerous life. This sort of sentiment would have been a serious liability. Better to keep his distance.
“I know that and it’s fucking breaking my heart!” he snaps, catches himself, tries to rein in his temper only to have his breath catch on a sob.
But he seems to have forgotten it, and it can’t stay on the floor, because Rosie will find it and possibly eat it. If Rosie didn’t live in the flat, Sherlock would most likely just have kicked the ring under John’s chair. That’s sadly not an option.
John's slightly changed breathing pattern reveals his barely contained excitement.
John purses his lips.  "Figured you'd want to get rid of the stubble, get out of the depressed look."
But he’d come to know how it felt to be held by him, know the scent where his collar opened up, know the feeling of Sherlock’s warm breath ghosting over his hair.
“Harry?”
"What are you doing with them?  Why did you keep them?"
Sherlock blinks and blinks, willing any tears away.
Sherlock regards John with scepticism.  "Are you serious about this?"
to him.
as the days go on.  His thoughts lull him into a light drowse, and much later, when the train rolls into Brighton train station, Sherlock finds that he must have, remarkably enough, fallen asleep before John.
Sherlock shifts his feet, stumping out his cigarette.  He puts his hand in his trouser pocket, no doubt to find that shell of his.
John huffs.
“No, I’m sure it won’t. Why bother with permissions. But, please, can you just check that Mrs Turner’s tenants aren't allergic. Wouldn’t be good to see one of them in anaphylactic shock with no Epi pen available. I bet you can do some sneaky detective work to figure that out.”
"Oh, clammy hands, too" John smiles, winks and rises.
It seems impossible for him to become the man Mary had thought he was, the kind of man who he wants to be. What he does for his daughter isn’t enough.
John rings the door and a guard appears in the porthole, glares at him and opens the door.
<< Nobody, however, told you about a foreigner man visiting here >> John asks to the owner of the shop of yet another village, that he has diligently noted in his notebook.
<< Exactly, and from June to December of last year the roads that connect this area with those two cities have been closed for works. The newspapers have spoken for months about the protests of the local hoteliers for the bad season that this inconvenience caused them. There are no other beaten roads that connect the pit with those cities and this leads us to exclude them with a 98% probability. We could always deal with a serial killer so self-confident to go around Bassenthwaite to reach Penrith and from there go down. I don't want to limit human madness >>.
<< In your opinion, Lizzy, why did Daisy and Rosaline commit suicide? They looked like two senior tutors, as you described them >> asks Sherlock to the girl, diverting John from his thoughts.
The woman screams again, a louder and more desperate scream this time.
The Ford's house is large and too perfect. Morgan precedes John and Sherlock, running free. He smell the bushes of red roses in the garden, chasing insects among the decorative rocks and staring at anyone who smiles or acts like an idiot towards him.
<< I was drugged. Before entering the sauna. It wasn't just a drop in pressure. It took me away. He took me to the locker room. There was no one at that time, they were all in the Aufguss. A perfect plan >>.
<< For what? For a quick and painless death? >> the man laughs. << I don't think so, kid! >> retorts serious, his face turned expressionless and therefore even more terrifying. << You are the dishonor of this family, damn bastard. A junkie, pederast devoid of any honor. You are not worthy to bear my name! >>.
<< My brother puts so much sugar to make it undrinkable. I see that you, on the other hand, appreciate its natural aroma, like me >> he says, taking a seat in the free chair beside him. << You didn't kill him, John >>.
<< That stuff had to be badly cut >> Sherlock mumbles, passing a hand that feels very heavy on the face.
<< I think it can happen there as in other places where you allow yourself to lose control, Sherlock. Maybe nudity helps >> gets out of the bathroom and slowly rotates on itself. << So how am I? >>.
The Sherlock's scarf. The beautiful blue scarf that John many times has seen him tie and remove from his pale long neck. The neck on which he sank his teeth several times that Saturday night, leaving signs that Sherlock is likely to still have now. Because Sherlock is alive. He is not there, where John was more than sure they would have found him, but he feels that Sherlock is still alive.
"You are his doctor, what should you do otherwise?".
<< Peter advised me to come and talk to him >> she says, pointing to Sherlock. << Peter told me he knows him >>.
<< Let's go there, let's take a look and see what happens >>.
John shakes hands in one another. Curl his nose several times, while shifting weight from one foot to the other. They did not expect anything like this. Indeed, things seemed to be taking a positive turn for Mary. In particular, John did not expect to witness what is happening and that leaves him stone, unable to say and do anything.
<< Do you have a mirror, so that I can see what I do? >>.
<< It's a long story >> sighs Sherlock. << And we don't have much time >>.
<< I'm glad to see you again, Dr. Watson. I thought this time you had decided not to take part in the investigation >> Mycroft teases John, focusing his eyes clearly on Fox.
<< So… Byron did not die following a heart attack >>.
<< Why did she beat you? >> he asks, stunned by her wrong way of telling these things. She should cry, be sad or at most toneless and expressionless and instead she laugh, smile and embarrass herself.
Also the kitchen is like the day Greg ran over to them with a folder full of clues about the train crash that driven him crazy.
<< Why, what have I done? >> asks Sherlock pulling up the zipper. John hurries out of the lift followed by him still fastening his belt. The two girls chuckle talking to each other and Sherlock turns to look at them without understanding what happened.
"I don't see why you too must suffer the consequences," Sherlock thinks, before returning to stare at the door. "I knew it would happen," he sighs, running a hand through his hair. The regrowth is now more than visible and in the village Mary will surely have heard of the missing Londoner. Paddington and Hataway have not heard from him for days and, now that communications have been reconstituted, they will have been able to talk to each other and realize that he never came to the police station. Sherlock should have prevented Mary from going into town to shop, but what would he be for? Only to delay the inevitable.
<< I'm used to doing my own business, John. I don't care who goes to bed with whom and why, unless someone dead. So go slow, okay? >>.
<< Your hands are always cold >> whispers John. Sherlock's eyes shine even more.
<< It means that the kidnapper brought them with him! >> the child concludes enthusiastically.
<< I saw your flatmate >> she says, pronouncing that last word with disgust. << He looks for you, together with the inspector. He wants to bring his lover home and I don't want a perverted pig under my roof! The devil in the house, that's what I brought, damn me! >> she shouts, throwing herself over Sherlock, her fists closed like two hammers that she drops fiercely on his poor limbs.
Dublin hymn of the 18th century
<< Your father is an idiot. The dangerous thing is that he is in good company, unfortunately. Lestrade >>, Sherlock calls the detective, << these footprints are the same ones that are in the entrance. Tell your men to compare both, just to get technical feedback for the pleasure of the chief commissioner. We will also have to exhume the dog and perform an autopsy that confirms that someone poisoned him >>.
<< Yes >> nods, leaving him speechless. Although he has never openly woven the praises of his father, Mycroft has always take care about the Holmes' good name. Sherlock doesn't expected that admission.
<< Sorry, it's ... you says me that you and Sherlock had an argue ... >>.
<< Yes >> Mary agrees. Bring her other hand close to Sherlock's face and lightly wipe away his tears. << Even my dad was bad. And my brothers too. Also my mom, to be honest >> adds Mary, as if she realized it now.
<<  I think you should stay out, John >> Sherlock interrupts him.
<< It's still snowing and doesn't seem to want to stop >> Mary says, her gaze now turned to the window. At the base of the eight boxes that make it up, the layer of snow that has accumulated has increased considerably.
Rough, violent images invade John's mind, who is breathlessly. Sherlock looks at him amazed by his gesture and squeezes his eyes just a little from the pain of that grip that becomes stronger and stronger. This is enough to cool the doctor.
<< To tell the truth I don't know >>.
<< Dad says that he is never wrong, but look what a mess happened because of him! He says that everything must always be perfect. Mom, however, says that only robots are perfect. I'm not a robot and neither are you, so we can also make mistakes and it's not our fault. Kelly always tells me it's a good thing to ask what I need. I need to ask you if I can help you, Mr. Holmes >>.
<< It is not a woman >>.
<< But it is so, Dad >> she says, holding on to his arms. << She was with him when ... she was not here when ... we were alone George and I and if he had not been here ... >> the sobs have the upper hand, while Greg looks at her terrified by what she has not told him.
<< I did not want you to suffer because of me >> sobs the girl, sinking her face in his hand that gently caresses her. The dark hand of Greg against the pale make-up skin of his daughter creates a marked contrast.
<< I hope this is really going on, Greg >> John whispers, serious. << I hope that Sherlock is there, to risk being strangled by a crowd of tourists and club staff. I prefere this, instead that to know he is dead frozen >>.
Mary leaves the room closing the door behind her.  Sherlock puts his head over the pillow, realizing only now how tense and immobile he has remained. His stomach is in turmoil for the large amount of anxiety and food that has introduced. Sherlock feels it ready to exploding. Sherlock closes his eyes and forces himself to breathe slowly. He inflates and deflates the abdomen and diaphragm to quell the panic that feels under his skin and soothe the stomach.
<< But in this way we would never have met >> she notes sad.
From the moment John grabbed the Sherlock's phone number reports, just sent by Mycroft, that investigation passed to him ex officio, one might say. John was investigating the disappearance of the consulting detective and now he inherited the case he was working on. Mary Abbott is linked to this case and Sherlock seems to have her at heart, for a reason that is not known and that, at this moment, is not even important.
<< It should wane tomorrow night. Until then no one goes out! >> Hataway underlines, pointing the warning finger on them. << The dormitory is free. You can stay there >> he concludes, giving them to intend to get out of the way.
<< Nothing >>.
<< Oh my God, what's going on? >>.
He  hands  the   recipe   to  him  with  a  smile,  patiently explaining   the  dosage  of  the   drugs.  John accompanies him to the door, but the old man stops on his feet and looks at him seriously. He must have been a handsome man as a boy. Those eyes of a now opaque blue are intense, penetrating and capable of awe, now that the old man has assumed this almost martial posture.
<< Your parents knew who took them away. They opened the door for him and I think they stayed talking for a while before he led them to the car. Have you heard anything? >>.
<< It is possible, but ... there is nothing we can do. When the storm ends, my life will end with it >>.
<< Yes >> Mycroft answers tiredly, while the nurses leave the room. << I hoped not to see him reduced in this way again. Instead ... >> he dabs the lips with the handkerchief, without ended the sentence, something completely unusual for someone like him.
Sherlock observes the director and he maintains his gaze. He is sincere and the decision he made is commendable.
<< Yes, but of his suffering ... who takes care of it? >> asks Lizzy, crying silently.
<< Stop it! >> shouts, beating his head.
<< Do you think that man was the one who drugged you? >>.
<< Absolutely yes. Undisputed governor >> says John, approaching them followed by Greg.
Sherlock stops breathing. He bites the lip, a gesture that makes the heart and the flap of the soldier's trousers flicker. Without saying anything, remaining in apnea, Sherlock's right hand long fingers  approaches to touch John's lips.
<< So take me >> he whispers, abandoning himself totally to his mercy.
<< I ... >> stammers Sherlock and the nausea closes his throat.
Anger boils up again and John makes an effort not to go back to giving his worst. John first boasts countless one-night adventures with subjects whose name he doesn't even remember.
<< Take care of you and for whatever you need, you knows where to find me >>.
<< She will kill me, I know >> he says, bored.
<< It is true. You are right. Sorry, is that ... I didn't expect you ... >>.
November 23th
"It's not for me," he says, while the huge woman gets up from the bed, making him sway like a boat in the throes of the rough sea. “Rather, I struggle and die in an attempt to defend myself. I'm not like you, Mycroft! ".
Sherlock is speechless. He hears John's voice far away and cannot grasp the meaning of what he is saying to him. A drug was the only possible explanation for his being dazed and strained. This was what happened to him when he made morphine. Sherlock cannot believe that his body has betrayed him, that it was a malaise caused by excessive heat that made him a helpless victim in the attacker's hands. There hasn't no external cause of chemical origin. The only external cause can be attributed to his stubbornness in not taking care of himself. Maybe John is not wrong and he has really a food problem. Sherlock has always been uninterested in food since childhood and even then said that digestion slowed him down.
<< Can you imagine Sherlock at the Overlook Hotel? >> asks Greg and both laugh.
<< Grandpa tried to teach me, but my fingers are too big >> she says embarrassed, hiding her hands behind her back. << He was always laughing saying that it seemed that I using a saw rather than a bow. He had learned on his own. He could only play a few songs, but it sounded really good and I sang it. I think you know a lot >>.
John brings his hand to his disconsolate face. Three hours. Other  three fucking hours. John nods helplessly and walks away from the group without saying a word. He sits in one of the armchairs placed in front of the fireplace in the waiting room of the police station.
<< Why did he tell you to come here? >> Greg asks her. Lizzy rubs the toes of her heavy  amphibians against each other, her face completely hidden by her hair. It seems that the chair she sits on has suddenly become uncomfortable.
<< It also seems to you that something has been dragged on this carpet, Myc? >> John asks, keeping his gaze fixed on the different tracks which cross each other clearly on the carpet and which seem to have been caused by the dragging of something heavy.
<< I don't want you to smoke during a case. We was agreed, Sherlock: never during a case >>.
<< You are not able. You would make a big mess and I don't want to clean any more blood >>.
<< I don't doubt it. However, I am obliged to notify social assistance when there are minors involved in a case >>.
<< Thank you, Mr. Holmes. This is an advance on his compensation >> he says, taking away a check that he offers him. John intercepts the check and his breath breaks as soon as he reads the amount. << And I will reserve you a suite here in the hotel >>.
The wind whistles loudly and the creaking of the glass frozen by the snow becomes almost perceptible.
Sherlock had feared that the bleeding would not stop and that he would die like this, bled due to a bad laceration to the urethra caused by the abrupt extraction of a catheter. He had to call all his strength and many voices from his Mind Palace to stay calm and he must have even dozed off, because he hadn't heard her come in when he realized that Mary was tucking in his blankets.
<< Do you think that in a predisposed subject it can trigger madness? >> Greg asks.
John laughs, shaking his head at such a staging
<< You are not staying in the house? >> John asks.
<< Thank you for your kindness >> Sherlock says, sketching a smile and in response she plants another piece of chicken in his mouth. << Are you a doctor? >> he asks and obviously already knows that a woman like this can be anything but educated. However, he needs to know where all the hospital equipment was procured.
<< Rosaline showed us so many ... >>.
"Evidently because love is not the eternal thing that is said to be, Johnny" replies Harriet in his head.
You missed the times. As with John. As with your father.
<< You don't know? >> Greg asks him in amazement. << John Watson who has no idea where Sherlock Holmes ended up? >> he exclaims loudly and then runs his hands through his hair.
<< What? >>.
Sherlock leans over the edge of the hole and observes carefully what the excavator has brought to light.
<< They are learning >> Sherlock says, satisfied.
John laughs and the puppy mutters annoyed. The doctor brings his hand to his mouth, continuing to chuckle in silence.
<< Oh, if it bothers you I can ... >>.
<< I'm also afraid of losing you, Sherlock >> John whispers, looking at those big hands. << I had it when I saw you here with that boy. When I saw you by chance in that alley with what I believe to be Peter and now ... I'm afraid that for fear of something happening to me because of Moriarty you can decide to go away from me >> John says, raising his eyes to meet those of Sherlock, full of emotion. << You didn't save only Lizzy from suicide, you know? >>.
<< Is it ... is it really necessary? >> asks the woman.
<< An ex-servant gave an interview to 'The Sun' after she was wrongfully fired, she said. It seems that  Ford is not properly a good husband, much less a good family man. According to the woman, Ford subjects family members and anyone who has to deal with him to constant psychological violence, made up of devaluations, recriminations and psychological blackmail. He tried in every way to hinder his wife's literary career. This woman who must be tenacious, because she managed to publish her best seller anyway. You know her, John. You read her book last year: 'Mather misericordiae' >>.
John doesn't want to leaving him alone, not in these conditions, but he realizes how important those tests really are.
<< How the hell did you come up with the idea of 'relieving John from case'? >> Greg, yell.
<< Did you often do something that didn't go well? >>.
Mycroft leafs through the documents, seraphic, and John would like to tear them from his hands and move about his business. The only thing that interested him was being able to count on Mycroft's ability to obtain any information.
Sherlock takes his pencil case from the inside pocket of his coat and kneels in front of the desk. He looks at the drawer lock and pulls out the burglary tools, followed by the curious gaze of the child. William lets out an 'oh' of amazement when, after a few attempts, the lock snap. Sherlock brings his finger in front of his mouth, letting him understand not to tell around what he has seen. William nods, bringing his finger to his lips too.
That now you accusing him of never being here I find it absurd >> she says, putting on the same expression of contempt that John has seen so many times in the face of Greg.
I want to thank all of you who have read this ff, who have left a comment or a kudos.
<< I take the car keys >> Kelly says, running into the kitchen. William watches Morgan barking at full lungs. The dog moves from the door and runs around the perimeter of the living room, barking at the large windows from which the child sees a shadow.
<< So do it >> encourages Sherlock him, chuckling.
<< Doctor Watson! I read your blog! I like it very much. Will you write a story about me? >>.
"And can you also control pee and poo?" Moriarty asks him, amuses. "You will have to do here on the floor and your benefactress will get pissed and freak out and then ...".
<< I know, but what alternative do we have? Outside I would freeze to death and you can't taking me to Hataway. What else can we do? >>.
<< You would be an excellent father, Mr Holmes? >> Kelly steals him from his thoughts. << Thank you for leaving the dog to him. Billy needs a friend so much. I said to Ulrika to go to home. She  has experienced too many emotions for today. I will stay with William and Morgan. You can feel comfortable >> Kelly says, going toward the child and the dog. Sherlock takes a moment to move from there. He shakes his head to restart the system and calls a cab.
"You need to distract yourself," John thinks and knows Sherlock won't tell him. His friend hates when the obvious is underline.
<< This doesn't make sense >> John mumbles.
<< It is not a good thing! It is too imprecise! >> Sherlock shouts, punching the desk.
<< Sherlock! >> says Lestrade. << You said he didn't die of heat stroke >>.
As Sherlock expected, nobody are there. Sherlock's stomach closes when he arrive at the wall against which  Martin abused of him . The white wall opens and McNeel enters the retractable door. Sherlock must admit that he does not like to find himself alone with this big man, a little younger than him. Martin looks at Sherlock with an ugly smile full of desire.
<< I didn't bring it! >> she exclaims, planting huge hands on the table. << No, I never would have. It was her. She is so much stronger than me, and she closes me in the storage room for a long time >>.
<< No. It is a crazy thing! >>.
The sarcastic grin of his brother can very well imagine it.
<< Whatever danger there is, I don't care >>.
<< You asked a question and I gave you an answer >>.
<< Oh, you are one of those idiots who teaches idiots to jump down from the mountains with toothpicks on their feet. It takes a lot of courage to call them skis! >>.
John frees one hand from his grasp and leads his to stroke Sherlock’s pale cheek. Sherlock's eyes grow large in amazement. Then he close to listen to that caress. He presses John’s hand against his cheek and, moved, John realizes that he is relaxing at the touch of his fingers. Sherlock places his hand over John’s hand and slowly turns his face slightly to place a kiss on John’s palm and then better accommodate his cheek.
<< That's what I just told you, yes >> says John, acid.
<< The doctor is just waiting for you to fully recover from the morphine to operate and to fix the fracture >>.
The sweat that comes from their hot bodies in contact.
<< Seven different types of soil >> he says, returning to open the 'Laboratory' folder. << As you can see from the last press, 4 of these are typical of the locality of Milton Keynes. From the findings, I deduce that Sharon brought the Fords in a place near Willen Lake >>.
<< I think he's just a very strange man >> minimize the woman, by swallowing a sip of wine. John is dumbfounded. This woman is irritating. It's irritating the way she speaks, it is irritating the things she says and how she says it and her superficiality. Her  judgment about Sherlock is completely out of place, since she does not know him. She cannot even say to knows John, on balance. The doctor chuckles, shaking his head.
<< And what do you think I had time to take its? >> she blurts out, irritated. << Thanks god, I managed to take you. The car fell down as soon as I took you off. I had to cut off your clothes to be able to medicate you >>.
<< You are right. Is it really true what they say about you, then? >> chuckles, wiping the bald again. << That two men decide to give vent to the passion in the changing rooms, although it is not an adequate thing, it can also be there. We are in a Spa: they relax, they walk wear a bathrobe and similar episodes can happen. The members know this and turn a blind eye. If there was, however, a maniac on the loose ... >>.
"Bingo!" James exclaims amused. "And, look a little bit, now you are naked too. You also have this thing in common with them, ”he says, invading Sherlock's personal space. "Was it Johnny-boy who undressed you, Sherlock? He ripped your shirt off you, blew the buttons all over the place, that naughty boy, and you laughed. Oh, if you laughed. I still have your laugh in my head. You were excited. So excited that your penis hurt you the way he pressed against the flap of his pants, admit it" Moriarty says with a mischievous wink. "When John pulled your pants off you, it was a sweet relief, as well as the beginning of the best part."
<< And the case? >> asks John, without even knowing why.
"Feelings are a chemical defect of the losing part," says Moriarty. “You shouldn't allow the heart to guide your head. I have always maintained that love was a dangerous disadvantage. "
<< The same thing he did to Byron and who knows how many others. He took advantage of the malaise caused by the excessive heat of that sauna to lead me here and ... well, I'll let you deduce the rest >>.
<< Oh, yes, maybe you weren't still there when Johanna was there. She treated Edward sooo badly >>. Mary approaches him, looking sideways at the guard, and brings hier hand close to her mouth. << She used him only for sex >> she whispers, confiding a very important secret.
"Only for this?" his sister's voice mischievously asks. No, obviously it's not just for this. John invited at home the first woman he had wooed in the first weeks spent on Baker Street. John remembers all too well the way she looked at Sherlock. The smiles she gave him and her flirting with Sherlock with impunity, despite his presence.
John smiles at him, with that expression that seems to mean 'you're totally crazy, but I love you' that Sherlock often finds on his face. He looking away to hide the embarrassment behind one of the maps he pretends is still examining. Although Sherlock is mad at John, he cannot hide how much pleasure his attentions do to him.
<< Greg! >> exclaims Lestrade. << Try not to get killed. I would be sorry to see you load onto a black sack heading to the Bart's morgue >> he says returning to his men.
<< Er, Mister Holmes? >> asks to Sherlock in an uncertain voice.
<< If I want it? Oh, Lord, you can't even imagine >> Sherlock says, barely holding back the tears. John lets go of laughter, one of those laden with satisfaction and pure joy. A laugh that has the effect of warming his now lighter belly. John brings his hand to caress the pale cheek of his consulting detective. With the same fluid gesture of Fox he brings Sherlock's amezed face closer to his. But it is not on Sherlock's forehead that he wants to put a kiss. John brushes Sherlock's lips, parted with surprise. He caresses them with his, feeling Sherlock gradually respond to the kiss.
<< Have you been away? You too? >> John asks incredulously, collapsing on the armchair in front of the desk. << Jesus, I can't believe it. We all left him alone for a few days ... >>.
John laughs excited by the memory and the choice of words that proved to be very useful.
<< We would not have sung 'Molly Malone' together >>.
John thinks, shaking his head. But he  smile happily in front of that scene. Sherlock's face, appears relaxed, rejuvenated. Maybe it's the puppy's reassuring closeness. John takes another step inside Sherlock's room and the dog pricks up its ears. Sherlock shakes without waking up.
<< I'm sorry, Mary. I could not do otherwise. I am not well. Forgive me >> Sherlock realizes that he is crying without any restraint. He reaches out to touch the huge slippers Mary wear, in a desperate plea for help.
<< What will you do? >> asks him, already knowing the answer.
<< That woman would have killed you too, if John had not been with the breath on that absurd inspector's neck first and then determined to reach the pit after that woman said she threw you inside >>.
<< Is it true, then, what he says about you? >>.
<< Oh, shut up, please >>.
<< I can also give you the benefit of the doubt, but this is what seems to be happening >> Greg looks at Fox annoyed. << John, I will allow you to participate in the investigation. I expect to find you in front of Mycroft. I have no desire to deal with that other phenomenon alone! >> Greg exclaims and descends the steps leaving the 221B.
<< So why didn't she say anything, when he met the inspector, John and Greg at the store? >> asks Mycroft, who doesn't seem to want to know to give up his ideas.
The little man  frightens at the way John look at him. The director's gaze travels from John’s bloody knuckles to Martin's face and visibly swallows, telling himself that it is better not to anger the quiet colleague of the famous Sherlock Holmes.
<< I would have something to complain about, but I don't think you will take me into account >>.
<< I find it a good starting point to structure an investigation >> Mycroft smiles and seems also relieved of John's words. << You know Sherlock's methods. I think it's time to use them to solve the case, John >>.
"She'll end up throw down the door, sooner or later," James snorts annoyed. "Well, you know what she wants from you. What are you waiting to please her?" Moriarty spurs him, by pressing his hands over his ears.
The doctor does not know whether to feel relieved unless he found out that the two boys with whom he caught his flatmate correspond to the same person. A person who seems to know Sherlock well anyway. Even too well. A pang hits John again in the stomach.
John looks up from the flyer and turns to the beautiful woman who looks at him smiling from the table behind him.
<< Where the event took place >>.
<< I think he wants to know your name >> Sherlock whispers and the dog barks. The boy's eyes widen in amazement.
<< I thought that in these days I have moved seas and mountains to save the woman who tried to kill me and I totally ignored the man who saved me >>.
<< If there is something I can do for you, gentlemen >> he mumbles.
<< Hey, what's going on? >> asks her, blinking her long false eyelashes. She tries to put her hand on John's again, which, however, quickly pushes her away.
<< Oh, Doctor Watson! My compliments for your blog. I asked Inspector Lestrade to contact you because I want the best to resolve this regrettable fact >>.
<< Because I'm distracted and clumsy! >> Mary says, surely reporting what her mother was saying constantly. << If I dropped a cup by mistake, a slap would fly. If I hung badly, even only a clothes of the freshly made laundry, she would kick me. If I didn't finish in time the commissions she assigned me and if they weren't the way she wanted them, mom were hit me with the belt. I worked hard to do everything well, but the straps arrived the same. I'm really a landslide >> Mary laughs amused and it's not a hysterical laugh. No. It's a laugh of real fun.
"Why?".
A female voice takes him by surprise. Sherlock turns and finds it coming from a woman he hasn't seen for a long time.
<< I have to fix a few things, before Gray kills me >> says Fox as they leave the silent club. << I will leave for Madrid tomorrow morning. Let me know if you join me or if you will join me later. And remember what I said, Billy >> Fox says, pointing his finger at him. The consultant nods embarrassed and the reporter chuckles shaking his head. Fox brings his hand to caress Sherlock's pale cheek and, with a tried and tested gesture that must be normal to each other, brings the consultant closer to him, by placing a kiss on his forehead.
<< Of course, there is no need to talk about it: it's decided! >>.
<< No, I'm not leaving! >> John blurts out resolutely.
<< This is not a nice thing to say >> Lizzy replies, taking the defensive.
<< Completely wrong >> retorts John. << Greg is not a pusher of investigations for Sherlock, but a friend >>.
<< I am, yes. Our father was ... was ... >>.
<< Well, O'Hara didn't reject her works. On the contrary, she also made herself available to help her >>.
John lets his hand slide along the bare back of his partner, who sleeps exhausted leaning against his chest. He feels he has a happy and satisfied smile on his lips, of what his mother would have called a fool.
<< Oh, of course you're sorry >> nods the woman, satisfied. << And to make up for it, now you will eat everything, like a good boy. It's not true? >>.
They both laugh until one cramp in the stomach louder than the others tears Sherlock out.
<< Well, come on, somehow he will have done before getting to know me >> John coughs. Greg looks at him with big eyes and shakes his disconsolate head.
<< It won't be a serious loss. No more blogs or porn films to cheer you up the evening >> Sherlock mocks him, trying to get up back.
“My dear, I'm not saying you shouldn't have been. You missed the times, as always” James points out. "In short, you know who we are talking about, come on! Jesus, you told him to love him! Someone like John runs away from such statements because he doesn't feel up to it. Johnny-boy knows he's just the comic shoulder of the great consulting detective! His task is to write about you, your deeds. The narrator is hardly considered, you know? All the attention is concentrated on the protagonist and you are the type of person who wallows in similar attentions".
“What would it do? This woman could go on beating me for hours. She has a lot of free time” Sherlock sighs apathetically, in front of the situation in which he finds himself. With a grunt Mary comes to himself and stamps her feet firmly on the ground.
<< Sir, it doesn't seem appropriate to talk about these things… >>,
<< The weight of culture! >> chuckles, noting how much lighter the trolley is now. John's laughter echoes in the room, creating a strange effect. He has never been so alone in this apartment. When Sherlock was out for who knows which of his cases, was Mrs. Hudson downstairs. The noises coming from the landlady's house kept John company. When, however, there was no Mrs. Hudson, the apartment was prey to Sherlock's chaos, capable of making his presence felt even when he was lying on the sofa, immersed in his Mind Palace.
<< Flatmate? >> question the woman, ignoring what it means.
<< Which characteristic? >> Molly asks.
<< It is admirable that you do not want to give your father further concerns >> John starts groping.
<< You prevented me from doing it >> Sherlock retorts, intent on reading a message just arrived on his phone. A smile curves his lips, and then immediately disappears.
<< You should go to the staff changing rooms. These are connected to the male changing room, to allow the men of the staff to use the showers >>.
<< Sherlock >> sighs John, bringing a hand to his eyes. He shakes his head in resignation, as his partner stands up ready to break the rules.
<< You are not here for a murder. It wouldn't make sense to run here if it were. You are here for a kidnapping >> notes Sherlock and Greg nods, wiping the sweat from his forehead.
Chapter 4
<< I was five years old. It was a horrible dream >> he says in tears.
<< You do not think Silver died of old age >> Sherlock asks him and the boy shakes his head becoming serious.
<< Morgan, let's run away! >>.
John does not like the veiled accusation that prods his sens of guilt.
<< I won't dye my hair gray >> reply John.
Once again Sherlock is speechless. A hot flash feels exploding in his face. Imagines that he is blushing like a schoolgirl, which irritates him even more.
<< Two years >>.
Lestrade gave him a summary report of the interrogations made to the staff and patrons present at the time when Howard Byron died. Apparently nobody saw or heard anything.
<< What's the use of knowing it? >>.
He stares at the sofa again and the memory of what happened there just two days before his departure invades his mind.
<< Where did you take him? >> he asks her, trying to overcome the instinct to grab her by the collar of the flannel shirt that pops out from under the shawl.
<< Do you really don't want to resign yourself, huh? >>.
<< I live here, have you forgotten? >> John replies, displaced by his welcome, putting perhaps a little too much acidity in the tone. Yes, it is possible that he'll start immediately with the 'big voice and threats' option tonight.
<< Last month was also thanks to Morgan if we caught those diamond thieves. Two weeks ago, Morgan gave me a remarkable hand, finding the right track that allowed the blasters to defuse the bomb carried by the kamikaze . If the chief commissioner wants my help, he must accept  you, John, and Morgan >> Sherlock says and the puppy snorts, confirmating his words.
<< You are right. We are not together >>.
<< How do you feel? Are you sick? >> asks to him John, worried.
<< I understand >> the director mumbles, wiping the bald with his handkerchief.
<< Mycroft, I believe that the situation is so delicate as to be lucky to have good professionals ready to collaborate with us >> says Sherlock, who is certainly not lavish with compliments towards others who are not himself.
"He passed out," Sherlcok says. "The man threw him against the wall," he notes, from the number of kitchen utensils, pots and pans that fell on the floor from the shelves against which the small body hit.
Sherlock left the Ski Club at three in the afternoon on November 10th. The storm began half an hour later, with an hour ahead of the forecasts. It takes an hour to reach the police command from the Club and therefore, taking into account the road conditions, the car Sherlock was driving and his driving style, John deduced (thanks to Mycroft's infallible mathematical calculations) that Sherlock's car accident occurred around 3.40 pm. The streets were already whitewashed, but not yet completely impassable. John tried to understand who could have gone there, assuming that, given the season, they could have been only locals. That track, however, was a hole in the water. All the people whom John and Mycroft asked if they passed by that road, sayed that they was there but either long before or long after the time found.
<< Sure >> Sherlock whispers, smiling. << Did you need a dog to understand it? >>.
The woman enters Ford's room and checks under the bed and behind the curtains. She opens the closet doors, but does not find the child and angrily destroys the large decorated mirror. Some splinters hit her face, but the long trail of blood that runs down her cheek does not stop her hunt.
he realizes, while the man's body rub faster and faster against his.
<< I soap you and you shave >>  happily says the little girl Mary, pulling out of her pocket a jar of shaving cream and an old brush. She start preparing the cream carefully, mixing it with the brush. The beautiful cheerful smile lights up her face.
<< Molly told me that the victim had a cardiac anomaly. He would not even have to stay in a sauna. That bastard must have approached him as he did with you, taking advantage of his malaise. If instead of abusing Byron he really helped him, maybe we wouldn't have a body in the Bart's morgue >>.
George shivers and Greg renews the caress on his hairless cheek.
The doctor lets his gaze run from the consultant to the boy with the beautiful deep voice. He plays a guitar that must have seen many adventures, given the amount of scratches and dents. A bright red sticker draws attention to the body of the instrument. It appears to be the stylized muzzle of a fox surrounded by the tail, red as a living flame.
<< Sure! >> exclaims the detective. << The colleague at the head of Threlkeld's command is a dickhead of the best! You need someone to hold your arm to avoid a conviction for assaulting a public official >>.
<< I don't give a damn, Fox. She is a young girl and she takes a moment to be enchanted by one of your smiles. And I takes me two to destroy you, even if you only do it for work. Lord, what do I have to say! >> he adds, rolling his eyes. << You, Sherlock, other quiet friends like John don't, huh? >> he says to Sherlock, giving him a sever look.
<< I'm not hungry >>.
The latest case kept them busy for a whole week. This week John didn't sleep, he ate badly, screamed a lot and ran like crazy to stay behind his flatmate's long tireless legs. He used his faithful gun many times, and he just wanted to be able to go back to 221B, take a hot shower and jump into bed.
>> says confidently. The noise in the wardrobe increases and one of the doors slowly opens. The curious face of a pale boy with thick, disheveled black hair emerges from it. With a perfect O of amazement drawn on his lips, the boy looks at Sherlock, blinking several times.
<< But ... are you sure? I thought he was not only your dog but also an important collaborator during the investigation >>.
<< As I always do, John >> Sherlock replies, reading a message just received. << This is the difference between you and me: I can control my emotions, you don't >> Sherlock says and the look of superiority that he dedicates to him does not like the ex-soldier at all.
<< How's Edward doing? >> asks him, leaning towards him, a note of tears in her voice.
<< No, in fact, it is the crude reality, my dear. Sorry, but I can no longer keep my eyes open >> John says, intertwining his fingers with Sherlock's fingers. Morgan moves just under their hands.
John remembers well the detailed explanation Sherlock gave him one evening, while changing the strings on the violin. After a while John got lost and started nodding without following him much. John also behaved like everyone else, bored with Sherlock's too many words. However, he could not keep up with him. He would never be able to keep up with him.
“Hey, wazzup Hamish?" he mumbles.
“Oh, sure,
Majida comes to their table with tea.  All the other customers have left, the music ended.
John leaves her to it.
“I wasn’t thinking about alcoholism.”
“Why are you saying this?”
Sherlock raises an eyebrow.
She scoffs.
She regards him quietly, a hint of sadness in her gaze.
“No I’m not, but…”
He’d been retaliating, not correcting… or?
Every other experience he’s had with other men was hidden, secretly or anonymously, covered by darkness and intoxication. Snogging, hand-jobs. He’s received a few blowjobs, but only given one when he was thoroughly smashed.
It’s true. And now Sherlock knows. It’s relieving
"Miss Cushing, the receipts?" Sherlock prompts, his growing impatience evident.
A message.
Sherlock reluctantly sorts through a bag of hand-me-down baby clothes that John got from a colleague. Why aren’t there any trousers? Why are there only dresses? The societal pressure to conform, maybe especially to gender roles,
Sherlock huffs. "I hope so."
"That would be a too generous interpretation, I'm afraid.  John!"  Sherlock dangles a vinyl glove.  "Just look at this!"  he muses, indicating the charred pile, while John helps him to pull the glove on.  "This is
John is uncomfortable.
In the early morning, they eat their breakfast in the garden. Harry’s brought the hifi to life in the lounge, and now some raging anti-war metal song is blaring from the speakers in there, loud enough to be heard outside. She really is annoyingly spiteful, but mostly in good humour.
Sherlock regards him in silence. He looks positively kissable. Stupid, stupid wine.
They follow Lestrade towards the house, Sherlock and Anderson glowering at each other when they pass.
John huffs.
Flood lights are set up to light up the garden and the small shed, as the darkness is creeping in.  There's a screen in front of the open door, to obscure the view of the body.  Lestrade finally notices their arrival and strides up to Sherlock's side.
Sherlock's eyes go wide.  That is insulting, promising and worrying in equal measures.
“If you’re still concerned about Sherlock’s drug use or see signs of relapse, there is this method which builds on creating a community around-“
"I know it's a bother, but as long as you manage to be careful, and do some exercises if needed, you'll be fine," John reassures.  "I assume you're able to text and scroll with either hand?"
"You said I needed to 'air out my lungs', so... "  He shrugs.
He’s right in the middle of one of the fears he’s trying to overcome. Even if no-one can see what’s going on, there’s people close by, the lights are on, they’re undressed and touching, and John is awfully sober. Only a bit lightheaded from feeling weightless and warmed up by the bubbling water.
someone has removed these bricks.” He waggles his eyebrows.
Only one thing breaks his resolve, going through Mary’s few pieces of jewellery on the shelves in the bathroom.
What had he wanted from Sherlock at that point? Had he truly wanted a fight? It’s all a blur of hot anger and blinding pain, fear. In light of recent events - had he wanted a physical confrontation? To crash into Sherlock, feel his body under his hands, wrestle and hold him. It makes John’s head spin. If Sherlock’s reasoning is correct, then John would have had the opportunity to hold him without a mindless violent attack.
"Yeah, that became a little bit of an adventure considering the stormy weather, huh?
John can't believe it.  Days of inertia and now finally something more than smoke and tension.
"She also had a nervous tick going on.  Did you notice?"
That's a bit worrying.
“Not never ever, but enough to... draw conclusions. Never got it properly checked though.”
"Oh."  Sherlock doesn't care for Sally Donovan, but John is
The only good thing about John keeping the ring on was the offputting effect it had on potential girlfriends. If there’s one thing Sherlock doesn’t wish to repeat, from their previous period of flat-sharing, it’s the never-ending stream of boring girlfriends.
John gives to Molly the bathrobe that Sherlock has carefully closed in a sterile plastic bag.
<< No! >> John exclaims interrupting him, his hand open towards the man and the sketch of a forced smile on his face. << I apologise me, rather. I didn't want to interrupt you. I go to my room. Have a nice evening >> John wishes them, striding to the door.
William shudders, feeling her so close and realizes that he has trapped himself.
<< Silver >> Sherlock replies in his place. The boy looks at him with big, amazed eyes.
<< How did you learn to understand everything so early? >>.
<< Do you think I'm not capable, John? >>.
<< William told me that the telephon rang at any time of day or night >> says Kelly.
<< No, you've been right. I have not behaved well and I have no excuses. Sherlock gave me an opportunity and I'm doing everything possible not to throw it away. I already consider myself more than lucky >>.
<< I did not know you smoke >> John says, sincerely amazed at the thing.
<< Usually my other lovers run away and never come back in the Spa again. One of them even died of a heart attack >> laughs with a sadic laughter . << You, on the other hand ... what are you, a kind of sadomasochist? >>
he was conscious when she simply grabbed the tube and tore it away.
Sherlock nods satisfied and smiles at Morgan, who wags his tail even more.
<< I'm not a cop, Mary. I am only a person who can observe and deduce. It is my sentence >> Sherlock notes, now leaning against the door, that in these long hours of pain has often been struck by the big hands of the evil-mary.
The cry of a woman takes him by surprise and turns in the direction from which he comes. Sherlock sees a gate in the distance and a car a few meters from it. A lifeless body equidistant from both.
Sherlock also says nothing. What could there be to say? There is no trace of the child-Mary in that rough statue that looks at him sternly.
<< Luckily I'm the one who exaggerated with the words >> retorts the chief commissioner, turning his scornful look to John.
<< Do you mean that Morgan can stay here with me? >> the child shouts enthusiastically.
<< I thanked God for putting you on my way, Mary, and for allowing me to be here today, alive >> he says, putting on his face the sad and devoted expression and the smile embarrassed, which Mary's likes so much. In fact, the woman nods contentedly and the corners of her mouth lean slightly upwards.
<< More beautiful than Aufguss >> John whispers on his lips, making Sherlock laugh. A free laugh, which resounds throughout the room and that John never heard before. << Now it's me who feels faint >> John chuckles in turn, placing his forehead in the hollow of Sherlock’s bare shoulder.
<< How can you say that? >>.
<< She could not, even she want it >> John mumbles, who still watches at the woman while she jovial talk with the old man.
Sherlock sees a tall, imposing man with broad shoulders and powerful arms emerges from a retractable door in the wall. He exchanges a few jokes with his colleague and, just by chance, meets Sherlock's gaze. The man looks at him amazed and nervous passes his left hand through his hair. Sherlock sees the stain on the wrist of this man, that smiles at him. A bad smile, full of malice and low instincts, which lights up further when Sherlock returns the attentions. The man is called by the sauna master and the contact is cut off.
<< I like it >> he says nodding.
<< I don't care about this >>.
<< Have you never dealt with a furious woman, Sherlock? >> John asks him. The consultant thinks about it for a few moments. More than once he seems to be about to respond and then falls again into reflective silence.
<< What effects does it have on the human body? >> Sherlock asks John, looking at the room from the doorway.
<< Yes >> Sherlock nods, looking away. << He told me that it could gave me the opportunity to experiment with my method, but only if I had stopped using drugs >>.
<< Because she risks suffering yet another injustice >> he replies seriously. << Mary ended the life of five killers. They should give her a medal >>.
<< Also, under a piece of furniture placed near the fireplace, I found this >> Mycroft says, showing him a piece of scorched cobalt blue fabric.
<< Yes, I recovered it and kept it here >> says William, opening the first drawer of the desk. He rummages in it and pulls out a sealed pouch with the piece of cloth inside. << I saw it done in the movies. The sachet was new. I hope it did not contaminate the test >>.
<< Not in the best way, unfortunately. She is very violent in writing and also in actions, I fear.
<< Sherlock, I love dogs. I have nothing against them. I just say that with the life we lead I find difficult for us to take care of a dog as he deserves >>.
<< I would say from the moment Mike Stenford introduced us at the Bart's >>.
<< I don't know who the fault is anymore, Mycroft. I only see what is happening. Lizzy is desperate enough to think about ending her life and George fought for her, taking the place that should be mine. That's no good. It is not at all good >> Greg sighs and collapses a little more under the weight of his sorrows.
<< Yes. They love each other so much. Since two years. But you're Edward's flatmate so you know it. Molly is not like Johanna's shit >>.
<< I don't care about the danger, Sherlock >> says John seriously, pulling his head up.
<< Sure >> he says, keeping calm. << Then let's wait and hope for the best. Are you planning to let Greg know about this story? >>.
The plans for the new ski resort include the construction of a 5-star hotel, a restaurant and an equipped area near the station from which the chairlifts will depart. Hugh Paddington is an ambitious man who has done his counts well and does not want that in any way those bodies found during the excavations could hinder his plans. He contacted Sherlock precisely to entrust him with the case, since the local authorities gave orders that nothing was touched until the investigation was resolved. The consultant accepted the case, finding it fascinating from the first words spoken by that arrogant and careerist man.
John rolls his eyes at that strange admission of fallibility.
<< No. No I can't, John >> growls furiously between sobs. << If it were only this I could do it, but there is also that woman, that abominable woman >> and the crying explodes. For too long Sherlock had stood still between tension and forced relaxation.
<< They didn't react like you when I made them this reasoning >>.
<< Because the most recent corpse dates back to 14 months ago >>.
"A little emphasis would be welcome," the criminal reproaches him.
Greg rolls his eyes and doesn't know if Mycroft Holmes want to do a compliment or a mockery to him. He decides to wait for the rest before figuring out whether to thank him or get his hands on him.
<< Where do you think to go with your leg in those conditions >> she attacks him, pointing with a gesture of the head the plaster that wraps Sherlock's leg. << You have it for a good month, listen to me. The roads to Keswick are all blocked and I was unable to take you to the hospital. I had only two choise: leave you there to die from freezing or bring you here. I thought it was better to bring you here >>.
<< Oh >> she exclaims in amazement. Mary squeezes her hands against each other and the leather gloves she wears rub against each other, creating an unpleasant crunch. John notices how tight they are for her.
John grabs Sherlock's elbow, trying to steer him away from Miss Badu to prevent further escalation.  "Yeah, and one of the people living here is dead.  Now, cut the shite and go pick up your coat--we're leaving."
When there had been two parents in the house, with Rosie so very small and squealing, it had all been a haze of too little sleep, and what felt like a million ways of trying to ease her cranky tum. They’d had two weeks of relative peace, where she mostly slept and slowly looked less like a scrunched up monkey and more like a tiny hairless human.
He flinches at her words.
"I'm gonna have a shower," says John. "You need the bathroom?"
They find the stairs leading down to the beach.  The constant lapping of the waves on the Channel has carved out the lower part of the beach, so they sit down, elbow to elbow, right at the crest, stretching their legs out down the slope.  The sun is rising high in the blue sky, shining on a sea of teal and on the light-brown, black and rust shades of the pebble beach.  Even now, when the sun's been up for hours, the temperature doesn't reach the past days' heat of London.
Entering the steam room feels like walking into a wall of hot moisture. The steam is thick in John’s lungs, but he notices the effect of the eucalyptus opening up his airways within a minute.
They put on their bathrobes again and head back to the relaxation room. Sherlock staggers and sniggers. He looks feverish.
It was relaxing in a way Sherlock's scrutiny never was. Sherlock had been picking him apart, like a specimen under his microscope. It had been a bit disconcerting. Because John had felt as if he had something to hide.
"Modest as ever."
John's not particularly keen on Brighton, specifically.  It was just a desperate idea that popped up in his mind.  He is not
, John?"  Sherlock can't help the disdain creeping into his voice.  This is a much too vulnerable situation.
"Oh, he's eager to please."  John looks back towards the swaying foliage.  "And ready to trim down that overgrown hedge."
All the air goes out of him.
"Yeah, well, not her fault!" John snaps at Sherlock.  He then turns and smiles at the teacher.  "I'm very sorry about this.  It was my idea and apparently I have a faulty perception of time, since I realise just now that it's ten to midnight.  I'm terribly sorry.  We'll leave you alone now.  If there's anything that comes to mind, talk to the officers."
Inspiration from this
"So he grew asparagus, lilies and roses.  Was he meaning to threaten and eventually kill off Miss Cushing by, say maybe sabotaging a batch of pickles and giving them to her?  At her age food-poisoning is more risky."
"Oh, so that's how to get your attention?  Pretend to not know the great Sherlock Holmes," John teases.  "Too bad I can't pull that trick.  For real, though, I bet Donovan and Lestrade are still puttering about in that garden, mopping up after Anderson tried to move the body before bagging it."  John sniggers to himself.  "Now we're all waiting for Molly's report.  Until then, cheers!"  John raises the remaining stump of his ice-cream in a toast.
"This is very confusing to me, Sherlock," John says, feeling a growing unease.  "I'm not sure I understand you correctly.  Be frank with me.  What are we facing?"
He looks to Ella.
“I invaded Afghanistan.”
"John, I know you sometimes doubted me, when Moriarty first made himself known.  Maybe you thought I had a flippant attitude to his crimes.  And you might have been right about that, to a degree.  I didn't fully understand how dangerous he was, until he took you and dressed you in explosives."
"The sea?"
Only this grief is different. It’s not as piercing and heart-ripping as last time.
"Huh."  He tries not to think too hard on how he almost fell into that trap.
"You can't let it go, can you?"  says John.  "Consulting Moriarty?  Christ, Sherlock.  You're seeing ghosts."
"No, and you two are not allowed to go back in there.  I don't want you anywhere near Miss Badu.  There was a complaint."  Greg glares at Sherlock.
This is filthier and dirtier than any same sex activities John’s been involved in, and yet those felt numbingly shameful. This is not. This is the hottest, most beautiful, most
John’s phone rings.
“Come, Watson! Let’s find something to build us a bee hotel,” he prompts, winking at John and standing up in a flurry. Sherlock’s still wearing his coat. It should be too hot in this weather, but John can’t deny it’s very practical in these situations.
“I’ll actually wait one year.”
It's too hot for September.
The door to the room at the end of the hallway is open, but Sherlock stops on the threshold.  He should have figured; it's not really surprising, but he hadn't really imagined it this way.  So, this is what John's been paving the way for during the whole day.
He’s still trying to follow Ella’s advice on learning more about himself. To let himself talk, to ramble, to say out loud what he already knows.
By the end of fifth form, Harry had trimmed her waist long hair down to 3 millimeters.
be scared when a loved one is in danger. Keeping oneself detached in such situations, that’s a pretty tall order.”
“Oh, sorry.”
It really was. It still hurts.
"Yet you're different in every way," John adds. He comes closer, then leans in to tenderly kiss Sherlock's neck.  "If I were to experiment on
Sherlock scoffs at the nonsense.
“Oh, John,” murmurs Harry, her voice pained.
John and Rosie’s constant presence leaves him nearly exhausted at some point every day. John readily accepts him fleeing upstairs to their bedroom, or locking himself up in the small lab, when everything becomes too overwhelming. Or, like today, leaving the flat for a couple of hours to recalibrate. He does the same for John, when Rosie drives him to his wits’ end.
John finally manages to slide the glass door open.  The cold sea breeze and the constant sound of crashing waves fill the room.  It's still raining, but the storm has subsided.
"Look, a geode!"  He tilts it, and the sunlight reveals a sparkling core.  "A flint nodule with quartz crystals inside.  Beautiful."
"Indeed."
They begin to stroll the length of the pier.  Music flows from sub-par speakers with an overabundance of treble.  The promenade is split in two by arcades and stalls in the middle, and people flock to the sunny side.
“Look at me, Sherlock. I want to- I want to
He turns to Harry.
They wander off, scanning the ground. One tall, one small, both having made themselves a home in John’s heart. He knows this, and sometimes he says it out loud.
"Come back in an hour and the lab is yours," says Molly, resolutely setting down her coffee mug on the table.
John goes to find the letter and soon they're in the back of a cab on their way to Croydon.  The sun is setting, and John hopes for some lower temperatures in the hours to come.  Sometimes, when the sweltering heat is at its worst, he doesn't know what made him go back to Afghanistan for several tours.  Or rather, he kind of knows, but it all seems so distant from the life he has now.
"John," he starts.  "There's something I should say.  Something I've been meaning to say for some time, but irrational fear has kept me from it.  I might as well say it now."
John carry on that cuddle even when Mycroft returns to the room. He no longer cares about absurd concepts such as decorum, reputation, decency, adequate attitudes and so on.
<< I fear that he will be >> Mycroft replies. He keeps his brother and the journalist under his icy gaze for a long time. They, inscrutable, support his analysis. << I would say that it is better to talk about it in my office >> Mycroft adds, underlining with his voice how much that is not a proposal but rather an order. << Are you joining us, Lestrade? >> he asks the detective, amazed at having been pulled in the middle.
The detective then approaches the consultant and holds him tightly in an embrace, catching him completely off guard.
<< Why do you want to help that woman, Sherlock? >> Mycroft asks him, who is really struggling to understand it.
<< And this would be luxurious? >> Sherlock wonders, looking around in disgust.
<< You must be accustomed to making substantial stocks of food, wood and everything you need to cope with these harsh winters >> investigates Sherlock, scrutinizing her face to test the effect of the question that has asked her. She nodding and an expression of profound sadness marks her face. Sherlock noted that the appearance, on that impassive face, of emotions indicates the arrival of the child's personality.
<< I'm fine, John. I'm just tired >> sighs tired. John decides not to insist further.
<< He is Morgan. He found you >> Sherlock says and the dog barks satisfied. The boy smiles and Sherlock, with a gesture of his head, authorizes the puppy to go to the boy. Morgan immediately jumps on the child, licking his happy face. The boy laughs cheerfully opposing a mild defense.
<< Oh come on, don't be the cold and emotionless consultant detective >> John says, pinching Sherlock's thin thigh. << I don't believe it anymore. You read some pages of her novel... >>.
Mary hands that delicate battered object to him and Sherlock takes it with the same delicacy. He places the custody on his belly and snaps the hooks. A puff of dust rises as he slowly opens the lid, discovering a violin as beautiful and precious as his own.
Contrary to what happens to anyone who is experiencing great physical pain, Sherlock perfectly remembers every single moment of his past abstinence crisis. He tried twice before finally succeeding with his third detox to get rid of addiction to cocaine and all the other things he injected or swallowing to overcome his sense of unhappiness. He doesen't acept to start again and with a sneaky drug like morphine.
<< But what kind of position do you have for sleeping? With those hands joined under the chin I thought you were dead >> growls badly, placing the tray under Sherlock nose. << Eat! >> she order, giving him the fork.
<< Yes, it's you. The usual, old and asshole Johnny >> she laughs and brings him back to the games that they usually did when they was children. When the dark times were still far away and it was not so important to love a boy or a girl. << What do I owe the honor? >>.
<< Johanna? >> John repeats, confused by that salad of words without sense.
“So now you judge him because he brings beautiful strangers to bed? It doesn't seem to me that you are doing anything different, Johnny! ”.
<< Absolutely not. It is not about empathy towards a family caught by such a misfortune >>.
<< Forgive me ... I lost my mind >> John mumbles, keeping his eyes down.
<< Jesus, enough! I am out of this case >> he says between his teeth and the old woman sitting next to him moves slightly away from him, alarmed.
<< Sure. Pirate and governor of Jamaica. Our Morgan is just 221B Baker Street's Governor. Isn't he, John? >>.
<< Yes. Mrs. Hudson's apple pie >>.
<< I didn't know that Captain Watson was a quiet person >> Fox replies, looking at John seriously. He absently takes his left hand to grab his right wrist and John quickly understands the reason for the discussion between Sherlock and the punk in the alley. The consultant mentions a gesture of refusal with his head to Fox, which, in response, look at John even more hard.
Sara looks at him worried and he smiles to her. Everything he wants except having to entertain himself to talk about his gastric problems with a pseudo ex.
Sherlock glances at Greg, who lights up immensely.
<< Coming to your discussion ... >>.
<< Of course, John, how could I not hear you, you whisper so loud! >> he blurts out, without opening his eyes to the sound of 'Child in time' by Deep Purple. However, Sherlock does not answer his question. John is about to point it out to him when the boy intones Nirvana's 'Rape me' and Sherlock opens his eyes suddenly.
No. John is not homophobic. Indeed, that is a mentality that he repudiates and doesn't tolerates. As a civilian, he never went into action with a man. That was the prerogative of his life as a soldier. There has been no lack of opportunities to him even in these months, but he has given up.
<< Okay, I don't insist but please be careful. The man in the video was shocked by the assault and suffered a cardiac arrest. Try not to go the same way >>.
One of the fictitious names of Sherlock Holmes. This is what he assumes at the end of the book 'Seven percent solution' by Nycholas Meyer
"Bad idea, Sherlock!" John says. “Try to resist. Maybe the good thing is that you will put on a few pounds. She doesn't cook that bad. "
<< Well, Greg, what can I say? It is the most beautiful declaration of esteem I have ever received >> John says and both explode into a laugh, capable of dissipating the tension and allowing the doctor to catch his breath.
<< Yes >> answers dryly.
Peter. He also has a name to send curses on, now.
<< What? >> asks him trying to respond to his desire with malice.
<< Really? >> asks John. He grabs Sherlock by the hips, bringing his knees under Sherlock's buttocks, just to create the right space to grip his back (and have Sherlock's pelvis even closer to his, of course). It is enough for John to creep just under Sherlock's shirt, shelled out of his pants, to hear him explode in a broadside of laughter graceless. Sherlock is light years away from his usual aplomb as a perfect man, all head and emotionless.
<< Jawn >> he whispers, taking breath. The hiss of air entering him draws John to those lips. There are only them now. The lips that kisses, that bites and that smiles at him. Sherlock's fingernails that sink into the flesh. Sherlock's tapered fingers that ruffle his hair. Sherlock's long legs that squeeze his hips and John's desire to undress him and make him his. John want to do it right away, before that magic fades and they wake up from the dream.
John nods. He is amazed by these constant proof of how Sherlock is able to take care of a living being, but, he is also speechless to became a 'permissive dad'. John has breakfast in silence (although it would be more correct to say lunch, given the time), mulling over this thing, while the puppy attracts the attention of all the patrons of the bar.
<< I know, Greg. We all know it >> John continues, pointing at himself and the Holmes with a gesture of the hand. << But you were a boy too and you know how difficult it was to talk to your parents. Especially when you saw them already tried and shaken >>.
With the other hand, the killer kept the victim's head pressed against a surface.
Greg's gaze leaves no possibility for replies and even John must agree that the situation is so desperate that any form of help is needed. He can always be proud of himself as he was right to be alarmed.
Sherlock sits down again and a dizziness catches him unprepared. He squeezes his eyes tightly and bites his tongue so as not to lose consciousness. All this heat is sending pressure under his heels. Sherlock goes to the bar and orders the sweetest drink they have.
<< A rather unusual modus operandi for a kidnapper >> says Sherlock, his hands clasped under his chin. << And also for someone like Ford. I can't see him being subjected to the blackmail of a stranger, just because he keeps his wife under fire >>.
"What would you think to do?".
<< Edward ... hey, Eddy, what's going on? >>.
<< It is a help and self-help site for teenagers >>.
<< I think you are still in time to enter to school at the second hour >> Sherlock says to the boy, standing up. George imitates him and so does John.
<< Tom, keep on digging. We have to find the corps >> Hataway tells them.
<< Give me a couple of days and I'll get you all the evidence against those two bastards. Now I need to rest >> says Sherlock.
The more her hands went down to the pelvis the, more discomfort had increased in Sherlock. The real panic had taken hold of him when he heard she say << Now that you are awake we can remove the catheter. You are perfectly capable of doing it in the 'parrot' >>.
"What should I do? Do I say to this stupid woman: 'Yes, we are lovers?' She wouldn't understand me! " he think, though there is nothing  stupid now in this woman, who has come even closer to the photo she observes attentively.
"The ideal set for a horror movie!" John says and Sherlock nods agreeing fully. As soon as he realizes it, however, he snorts again.
<< Don't you like silence? >>.
<< Mr. Holmes! >>.
<< What's the problem? You know that when I investigate I don't sleep. And anyway, there is the sofa >> retorts, going back to reading.
"Why did I end up here?" he asks himself clenching his fists.
<< What did you see? >> Sherlock asks and John's stomach sends another pang.
Sherlock nods, still dazed by the beatings and that furious version of John. He calls Lestrade and tells him that he has solved the criminal investigation and grabbed the killer. Sherlock made the next call to the chief of the hotel, who run into the locker room where the consultant, doctor and attacker are still sitting on the floor, while the deep and deep notes of Tibetan bells come from the large swimming pool. The little man looks horrified at the blood mask that has become the face of an unknown member of staff.
<< I'm sorry >> Sherlock says, realizing how much better it is for him to keep her good. She could kill him with one hand in the condition he is in. It seems that Sherlock have done the right thing, since what may seem like a smile appears on the woman's hitherto expressionless face. The pale lips curve to the sides, slightly changing the expression of the square face with a broad forehead.
<< I have my share of responsibility, John >>.
<< Enough now! >> Sherlock shouts, jumping to the neck of the criminal consultant. Moriarty laughs amused, while Sherlock hits him with punches and kicks that seem, however, not to cause him any harm.
<< If you had told me such a thing before Morgan entered our lives, I would have laughed a lot >> sighs John. << Now, however, I agree with her >>.
<< Lawyer? But what the hell are you talking about? >> the man chuckles. << Do you really think you can stay without me? >>.
<< Why? >> John asks, raising his head to look him in the eye.
Bad choice of words. The woman takes his justification as an admission of guilt and begins to shake him and slamming him several times against the mattress.
<< One in two is already a success >> Sherlock says, placing a kiss on the sweaty forehead of the child. William throws his arms around Sherlock's neck.
They return to Baker Street to pack and prepare their avatars. With the speed and the typical method of the soldier, John prepared the suitcase in a few minutes. John hears Sherlock to go from the room to the bathroom. When the bedroom door finally opens, the doctor remains open-mouthed before the man who sees come out.
<< Yes, exactly. When I got home I received a message from Mark telling me that I couldn't go on >>.
<< Billy, you are too young. What can you do? >>.
<< We had a… pretty heated discussion before my departure >> he says embarrassed. << I just haven't seen him before leaving, actually. You know what him is like when he decides to go crazy >>.
Greg seems to calm down at those words. He puts his hands on his neck and sigh deeply.
<< Yes. You are everything for her, William, and you know how much she loves you >>.
<< Just to do this >> John replies. He quickly leaves Sherlock's wrists and starts to run with his fingers along the consultant's hips and abdomen in search of a sensitive point.
<< Fantastic! >> exclaims John, who for the first time see the skill's Sherlock in disguising himself by changing his physiognomy completely. John swallows several times, embarrassed by the half-erection he feels pressing against the flap of his trousers .
<< Obviously >> echoes John. << I don't have a photo with me, but we can retrieve it from my blog >>.
<< For your information I won the 'Best Halloween mask' award for all the high school years >>.
<< Oh my God ... I feel I'm going to explode >> John mumbles, trying to stop himself.
"Stop that!" exclaims the captain's voice. This is enough for him to shake himself and start shaving.
"I'm sorry to tell you, but I think that Mary only managed to get this blanket from your tormentor" Moriarty tells him, appearing sitting against the hatch. Sherlock ignores his irony and, with movements made less secure and slower by the tremor, wraps himself in that knitted wool rectangle. It has the scent of burnt wood and a lavender aftertaste, just like that of the fireplace. The slight warmth helps Sherlock to quell the chills, although at almost regular intervals they return to shake him from head to toe. He crouches in a fetal position just as he had done that Sunday morning, when he felt the sweet weight of the blanket resting on him by John.
<< How can you not be mad at me? Greg turned his back on me when I told him what had happened, taking his part. You, instead, bring me tea. We are talking about your brother! >>.
<< Those are nice side effects >> he admits, doing shrugs. << I am not pissed because since you moved with Sherlock to 221 B you have removed a significant amount of stress from over my shoulders. I no longer have to worry about chasing Sherlock to get answers to my messages or to know where he ended up and where he is with the investigations, because I just have to ask you. And you promptly answer me. I no longer have to worry about him being too cold and direct with the witnesses or relatives of the victims or with my men, because you just have to glance at him and he gets in line. I no longer have to fight to make Sherlock accept a case, because, in order not to see him fall prey to boredom, you persuade him to give me a hand and within an hour everything is done. I owe you the well-being of my liver and my coronaries, John, and for this reason I cannot be pissed off for the loss of commendations, promotions and economic bonuses >>.
<< I don't allow you to speak! >> the man shouts interrupting John. << I don't know who you are and why you are here. I feel directly involved in this case and I will not tolerate further wasting time. Lestrade, I consider you responsible for the presence of these strange characters on the scene... >>.
<< Yes >> the detective nods. Greg looks at him unconvinced. << This discussion must have been pretty important >>.
<< I accept the case >> Sherlock says and the manager's relax.
<< Damn bastard! >> se shouts, trying to take him off, but the puppy does not let go. William comes quickly out of the closet and, scared, observes the scene. The baseball bat that fell from Sharon's hand rolls towards him, like an invitation. The child frowns, grabs the bat and, with a real pirate cry, begins to hit the woman.
<< An expert? In what? >>.
<< The thought of the cake will keep me company >> Sherlock realizes to say, feeling so distant to those words, as if they were pronounced by someone else. Someone extremely kind and condescending.
December 5th
<< Before Amina was fired yes, but then Mr. Ford preferred that we settle on our behalf, coming to work from 7 am to 9 pm >> replies Kelly.
<< That woman threw my brother into that pit as if it were garbage, Inspector! I demand justice for what my brother had to suffer at the hands of that woman! >> John heard him say in a peremptory tone a few steps from the closed door of the room. Maybe John would also have to fight for justice. The thing that interests him, however, at the moment, is to see Sherlock's eyes open again, his lips to move and his voice to begin to deduce all that his gaze encounters. He wants to make sure that his friend's mean of transport and his brilliant mind are working. Only then John will calm down.
<< No, stay here >> John whispers, putting the puppy back down. He jumps back onto the bed and John, tired from the walk they've done, brings his hand to his eyes, just like he usually does in front of Sherlock's follies.
One of the guys from the forensic department team, checks the three copies and shakes his head in amazement at the accuracy of the consultant's description. John proudly observes the scene and, possessively, lays his hand on the shoulder of his man, who analyzing the contents of the PC.
<< Now the vegetables >> insists her, by pinching a piece of carrot which she puts in his mouth without much compliments.
"It's a shame, though, that it ends up like this, don't you think?" he asks and Sherlock imagines the expression of a beaten puppy on his face.
<< Well ... we are four, I think we will capable to manage the anger of a single woman, right? >> says Sherlock and the others look at him in amazement.
<< No >> Sherlock says and it's up to him, this time, to quell yet another silly explosion of the chief, placing his open hand in front of him. << I am not, because Mr Ford is not the object of the kidnapper's aims >>.
<< Experience has taught me that with Sherlock even a few minutes can be crucial >> Mycroft says and his lips curl up to form that fake and mocking smile that from the first time John saw him he found it annoying.
<< It is useless to hope for a miracle, Greg: that is the car that Sherlock has rented. He has been too long under it to hope that he is alive >> says John coldly. Greg looks at him in amazement, but he can't help nodding. << If I haven't called him yet, it's because I don't want Mycroft Holmes here. I would be too tempted to throw him off a cliff and I don't feel like finishing the rest of my days in jall because of him >>.
<< Who is Silver? >> asks the doctor.
<< You should better choose your employees, sir >> John says to the chief of the hotel.
<< You are a regular customer >>.
"It was nice, wasn't it?" James asks him without any modesty.
<< He remained at your side from the moment he rescued you until yesterday >> Mycroft informs him. << After you woke up and invoked the name of your jailer, citing the will to run to her aid, John left this room, saying he had to conclude the investigation that you had opened concerning the pit. He kept saying that if you said you wanted to help her there must be a more than valid reason >>.
<< What? >>.
<< All really excellent, thank you… you didn't tell me your name, madame >>.
<< Come on, Sherlock, it can't be bastard up to this point >>.
John ends the conversation with his sister's cheerful laughter and feels he has put everything right. In his head, in his belly and in his heart. He go back to bed and find Sherlock turned on his side. John sinks his face into Sherlock's hair and surrounds his man's hips.
"You're back, Mr Sexy ”applauds Moriarty, looking at him with far too brazen interest. "I deduce you solved the case."
<< In fact that's what we're going to do >> John intrudes. Sherlock glares at him.
<< Margaret O’Hara is a successful writer, not just a  teacher >> specify Sherlock.
The man becomes purple and sprints towards her determined to silence her, but Morgan reacts before anyone else, by returning to growl and bark. Although instinct would lead Mr Ford to detach the dog's head with one hand, when he sees the unkind eyes of all those present, he takes a step back.
"Not yet, but you're almost there" Moriarty chuckles, standing on the edge of the pit. His hands in his pockets, his dark glasses covering his empty eyes and his mocking smile on his lips. "It's nice to die, Sherlock" Moriarty says, jumping into the pit. "Nobody comes to bother you," he adds shrugging. "Look at all these corpses," he says, pointing with his finger at the corpses around them. “They have remained quiet and safe here for sooooo much years. Then, yes, people came to disturb them, in fact, but their situation is also unusual, don't you think? ”.
<< Do I have to? >> he asks, putting on his best puppy eyes.
<< Are you sure? >> asks Sherlock, while John biting his beautiful pale neck.
"It will be better if I doesn't make you anger" Sherlock thinks, preparing to meet his unknown benefactor.
<< Rosaline has always shown us of her creations, proudly. Every evening before dinner it is a real parade of sheets of paper >> the father smiles.
<< And I understod how it ended after the second paragraph >>.
The boy lights up and splashes on his feet followed by Morgan. William hop on the desk chair and turn on the PC. The consultant stands up and observe him, intent on recovering the precious finds.
<< Do you find it admirable? >> acid question John, annoyed by the ecstasy he feels in Sherlock's voice.
<< You have finally arrived >> he says.
<< Oh. That's the problem? >>.
Hearing Mycroft put into words the justification he gave himself to take courage and give voice to that absurd speech, leaves John speechless. He never thought about the future of a relationship. He always just threw himself headlong, taking what there was. John's relationships ended because women are lefted him, every time. He is not in accord with Mycroft, because he would have written the ending of a possible relationship with Sherlock differently: also this time he would have been left. Sherlock would left him out of boredom, for lack of stimuli, for lack of interest, once he has become an obvious routine. Yes, John is convinced of this, he just cannot put it into words. What would be the use of replying at Mycroft's question, if not to make the figure of the one who wants to play the victim after having wanted at all costs to play the role of the executioner?
<< The rooms are equipped with air conditioning and all comforts. And I will ask the sauna master to keep the temperature of the common areas of the Spa low >> says the chief of the hotel.
<< To fatherhood, you say? No. I never cared to sign that irrevocable and indefinite contract >> he says, looking sideways at his man. << You? >>.
Sherlock would like to tell her to stop talking about her family of sadistic madmen, but Mary seems to have removed the cap. Sherlock is afraid that by now she will consider him as one of her dolls, forced to stay there to listen to her tell her nightmares. Except that those are not dreams, the result of a tormented unconscious, but the cruel reality.
<< No. I hate him. It's like being deaf. The points of reference are lost and it always seems that something must happen at any moment. I am never in the silence, never >>.
He stands up and offers him his hand, but Sherlock puffs ignores it, determined to do it himself. The doctor lets him do it, aware of how this also serves to encourage him to take care of himself.
Sherlock's irises are of an intense blue in which John feels like drowning. The hyperactive  consulting detective is showing him the slow side of himself. He is teaching John to savor every single moment, taking the time to collect all the sensory information that this produces.
<< You risk being late in the clinic, John >> says Sherlock, typing frantically on his cell phone. John looks at the clock on the clock and mutters a curse. He should already be washed, dressed and on the street by this time. He finds out that he doesn't give a damn.
<< Why can't you stop it? >>.
They remain silent for a long moment, each lost in his own thoughts related to that little great absence.
<< Sure! You pass through the door whose entrance is reserved for employees >>.
<< I don't want to cause any damage to the clinic >> he adds docile.
Sherlock’s hand is cold and light, like a distant but reassuring presence. The touch touches John’s skin and he realizes too late that he has wet his lips with his tongue. Sherlock draws john’s lips outline with his fingers and the thrill that arises from this light touch brings John to approach Sherlock, his gaze fixed on his  lips.
<< The impact must have broken that large branch that destroied the windshield >> continues Hataway, indicating the huge branch that slipped a little further and held back by another tree.
<< You found the place where Sharon brought the Fords thanks to the remains of dirt under a sole, Sherlock. You have also circumscribe it thanks to excerpts of stories >> John tries to calm him down.
<< Stop, the two of you! >> Greg shouts, getting up in turn. << If you shout we won't get anywhere >> he says to Lizzy, trying to keep calm. The girl returns to her seat, however, glaring at her brother, who supports her attack, undaunted.
<< We are stuck here, Greg. We too >> mutters, heartbroken. << I was an idiot to get you involved, but I really hoped to get some more information by coming here >>.
<< They are not things that concern you! >> John immediately stops him, peremptory.
John did not expect to see Mary jump for joy at the idea of being pulled out of there. In fact, he had expected that she would not react, as she is not reacting now. John doesn't even know what that woman could have understood about the situation that has emerged around her and to her detriment.
<< He knew him! >> says him confidently. Sherlock nods.
<< As your doctor, given your conditions I should make you give up taking any type of physical activity >> John says distancing himself from Sherlock.
Greg sits beside him and claps his hand on John's  shoulder blades.
<< No? >> the manager asks in amazement. << I thought to be important for you  Investigate here in the hotel >>.
John stretches and calmly gets out of the bed. It is normal for him to have a dog who can recognize an interesting case simply by sensing the high levels of adrenaline and fear in those who ring at their door.
<< Thanks, Mary >> he whispers to her and she with a smile applies the vial to the IV. Slowly the drops descend along the tube. Sherlock watches them enter his body through the needle planted in the hollow of his arm. It only takes a few minutes to feel the pain subside. The leg no longer exists and the abdomen relaxes satisfied.
<< It was my mom's >> says the little girl Mary proudly. << I kept it for her when she making braids. Her hair was veeeeeery long >> she says chuckling cheerfully. << To my dad, however, I liked so much to put on his shaving cream, as I did to you, and then to watch him while he took it off. It is a magic to see how the face changes without all those hairs >>.
<< Your brother has just bought points in my eyes >> John whispers to Sherlock, discreetly approaching his ear.
<< Kind of him >> he smiles. << But it also happens to me, sometimes, very rarely, to make mistakes >>.
<< What was the magic word? >> asks Greg.
The woman falters in front of John's fury and seems to be about to say something, but stops completely, as had happened to her in front of Jo's shop.
<< Especially in kidnapping of wealthy people. Very interesting >> Sherlock mutters to himself, impressed by this detail, as by many others that increasingly catch his eye.
<< Three years. He's 16 and doesn't know I'm here. I don't think she would approve, but ... I don't care! I do not ... I can no longer silently witness the series of disasters around me >>.
<< Do you want to tell me that's why he didn't answer me on the phone these days? >> asks the detective, holding out his hand to the puppy's muzzle, which grants him a little sniff.
<< Billy, Sherlock and John have a proposal for you and Morgan >> says Margaret, attracting the attention of her son, who emerges from the gigantic backpack. William runs to sit next to the consultant and the doctor and Morgan also sits down next to him. Sherlock turns his gaze to John that nods, encouraging him.
<< Magnificently, Mr. Holmes! > Fox answers with a big and false smile. << My colleague literally tore the portal to pieces. Currently, Polish law enforcement agencies are going to retrieve the 26-year-old Dimitrj Vadlila, the evil genius who put all this mess up! It will be a real pleasure for me to ask him why his crazy plan and obviously I will keep you updated >> Fox says, getting up from his chair.
<< Too many undigested things >> John says, realizing too late that he has spoken out loud. The patient nods and curves himself even more.
<< Five brothers? Are you the only female? >>.
Sherlock joins the stream of people who head towards the largest sauna, the octagonal one with the stove placed in the center. Among these he sees John whit a woman.
The consultant closes his eyes with his hands clasped to his chin, while the guitarist intones an excerpt of The Buggles' 'Video killed the radio star'. He listens to it absorbed in contemplation and it is absurd, since, outside of classical music, everything else for Sherlock is only garbage unknown to his Mind Palace.
That smile, so unusual to be found on his brother's face, captures Sherlock attention. Almost by chance he realizes how the scene has changed around them. They are in a room now. A room that Sherlock knows all too well.
<< Why is he captain if he is a doctor? >> she asks this curious question with a little girl's voice. John exchanges a quick glance with the inspector.
<< Are he a policeman? >> asks the woman, coming out of her silence. She approaches at the photo and looks it again.
John brings his hand close to cover his eyes and tries to breathe slowly. Very slowly. So slowly it seems almost an apnea.
<< Oh, don't even imagine how many >> Sherlock chuckles, while his hands go further and further down John’s back.
John is visibly against it, but he keeps his thoughts to himself.Greg arrives with his entourage, just as the stream of people leaves the pool. The magic session must not had so relaxing after all, given the less civilized way in which many of the men react to not being able to access the locker room.
<< As far as I'm concerned, this is what I feel >> John remarks with conviction, supporting the inquisitive gaze of the English government. << I feel Sherlock is alive, Mycroft. Tattered, perhaps. In danger, even, but alive. I feel miself impotent becouse I can't go there and get him to safety >>. John runs his hand over his face and leaves it on his suddenly stretched lips. << Although he may not want to have anything more to do with me. It does not matter. As long as he's safe, then ... the rest doesn't count >>.
<< You've got it beaten, as far as I can see >>.
<< We are a couple >> concludes the doctor for him.
<< Of course, it isn't. However, there is nothing we can do. Have you seen how it is snowing? I do not put anyone's safety at risk, even on board the best of snowmobiles >>.
<< Poor thing >> sighs the inspector.
<< I'm sorry I can't help you this time, Greg >> whispers and the detective deflates in front of his strategically submissive tone.
In this two days it was possible for him to make a map of the place where he is thanks to the noises he heard. He is in an old farmhouse, full of drafts and crunches of rotten and time-worn boards. He is located on the second floor, just above there is the attic, under the bedrooms and on the ground floor the living area. Involving Mary in a conversation made of targeted questions and the right amount of contrite expressions, Sherlock has managed to make her tell about the hectares of land placed all around the house and the stables immediately beyond the farmyard. A boundary wall surrounds the property bounded to the outside world by a large gate with Abbott's A cleverly forged in the center.
Sherlock sniffs the air and behind the intense scent of lavender and wood he perceives those of an ongoing culinary preparation. Chicken broth, it would seem. Boiled vegetables too. Potatoes and carrots. Even peas.
John laughs first slowly then louder. He gives him an amused look, involving him in his laughter. They both abandon themselves tired of laughter against the backs of their respective armchairs. The heads leaned back and the breath excited.
<< ... ok >> Greg says uncertainly straightening his back. << Nothing violent, I hope >>.
<< William, what do you think about? >> John asks him.
<< No, Captain. Neither this man nor anyone else. As I said, the town is small and the voices are running fast >> the man replies, shrugging.
<< I'm done >> he whispers, feignedly embarrassed and the woman reaches out her hand protected by a latex glove. She
John searches the staff cards of these three names and places them next to each other.
<< Morgan is smarter than you, Anderson >> the consultant shouts loudly, walking beyond the main door.
<< Behind the Fenix portal there are Moriarty's hands >> replies John without going around much.
"Survive, Sherlock" replies these and the tone is not detached, quite the contrary. "I'm looking for you. You know that I worry about you constantly. You have to be patient and do your best to stay alive. "
The boy finishes the piece and announces that he will perform a medley of covers by different authors. Start the first of these, The Cure's 'Boy don’t cry', and sketch a smile in the direction of the consultant, he reciprocates.
<< None >>.
<< It seems to me an aggression >>.
"Come on, don't keep everything inside! We solve our final problem ".
John receives a message that distracts him from the abdominal pain that is coming to him by ruminating anger.
Greg thinks about it for a moment.
<< Exactly >> John nods, examining a 'parrot' and the basins from which the stench of disinfectant intensely spreads. << It comes, however, only from two rooms. This and that >> says, pointing to the other closed door. << And, coincidentally, the grooves on the carpet lead to these rooms >> he adds, leaving the bathroom to go to the closed door. John grab the handle, but the door is locked. The wood is very damaged, as if it had suffered violent attacks. John's heart beats strongly at the idea that Sherlock may be in there and, without thinking twice, opens it with a shoulder (which although he used his right side, does not like much to his left shoulder, but they are negligible details, at the moment).
<< Or maybe I decided I don't care anymore, Sherlock. What people think. What my mother thinks >>.
Sherlock runs his hand through the hair he has cut, smoothed and dyed blond to put on Edward Nolton's clothes. A shiver runs through his back at the thought of when his hair will start to grow, revealing their natural color.
<< Do you love your parents, Mary? >> asks her without even knowing why he's doing it.
<< Hey, why don't you take it? >> William asks him in amazement. The puppy starts to growl. A deep, guttural sound that is barely audible. The child approaches him, looking around.
"You actually squeezed he hard on the wrist, Johnny," Harriet says, making him snort.
<< Oh, it's difficult, I know. But that's okay. I'm not leaving anyone. I'm ready >>.
<< What the hell happened on Saturday night, John? >>.
"Myc" sobs now against Mary's chest.
<< Why on earth? >> John asks, frowning. Fox exchanges a glance with Sherlock and John does not need the Holmes acumen to understand who made the decision to make that omission.
<< Oh. Yes, what it is >>.
John brings his hands to cover his face. He lets them drop to his mouth and shakes his head hard. Sherlock accidentally notices that crying and wiping his tears.
William Kidd, Scottish corsar and pirate who lived in 1796 ... or so.
<< To save you, Mary >> tries to explain John, but the woman looks at him confused. << They want to accuse you for killing all those people >>.
"Bravo, Sherlock! Keep her in good mood and you will see that she won't hurt you any more”John says in Sherlock's head. Sherlock snorts in front of that umpteenth intrusion.
<< What is the meaning of the drawing? >> Lestrade asks, stopped a few steps from the corps. John recognizes on the detective's face his own attempt at detachment and self-control.
<< Human bones >> he mutters to himself and a spark of euphoria lights his eyes. << It has all the air of being a mass grave >> he adds and the idea of finding out who created it reddens his cheeks more than the frost of this morning, which promises a good snowfall .
<< Undoubtedly remarkable >> he replies, looking at what remains of a young life as an admirer who observes a beautiful picture. << Especially if, as you hypothesized, she didn't take drugs or anything else to take courage. This girl wanted to died and did it without hesitation and wanted to leave this message >>.
<< No, Jason. I haven't seen this man. You know how small the country is and how much people murmur here. A foreigner ... this foreigner would have caught the eye and I would have known, in one way or another >>.
"Because are you going to die, Sherlock," Moriarty tells him, appearing behind him. “It is said that each of us relives his life before dying. You came back here, where your problem started. "
<< Yes, the smallest. Freddie always told me that I was born by mistake. Mom was fed up with having children and when she found out about me she tried to have an abortion but she couldn't. This is why I was born stupid >>.
<< Willen Lake ... it is an ideal setting for this horror tale >> says John.
The woman remains silent for a long moment. Then her gaze changes. The eyes seem to veil and remain motionless, totally motionless, as if not even breathing. Finally Mary shakes herself and John sees the eyes of the little girl, who revealed where 'the other' had brought Sherlock.
<< She would have killed you immediately >>.
<< It's something we do without realizing it, Sherlock. Perhaps our way of understanding each other perfectly without the need to speak. Maybe because I call you back and you listen to me in your own way. Maybe because people see something that we are not yet able to see >>.
<< How many cookies did you give him to make him so friend? >> John asks with amusement.
<< The leg… it hurts >> he mumbles, trying to justify his conditions.
John feels his stomach ache of the same twinge so well described by the old man in front of him. He should do some tests, but he is already afraid of the response. As it is known, the doctors are the worst patients, so it saves the effort. John knows what he needs. That innocent kiss kept him awake most of the night. He pushed him to sneak into his house like a thief, prepare quickly and run away, despite the fact that his flatmate was not there. Indeed, perhaps for that very reason.
"Anyone who has been bring me here must be remarkably strong," he thinks, by pinning the information.
Greg laughs and slaps him on the shoulder.
<< You didn't been druged! >> exclaims the doctor even before he can say 'Hallo'. The news upsets Sherlock.
Sherlock finally turns to John. He holds his gaze and John has the annoying sensation of feeling him far away. A lot has changed in the past month. John thought that the adventure lived because of Moriarty, would allow them to come closer. Instead the consultant became colder and more reserved. They are practically elbow to elbow, yet many kilometers seem to separate them.
<< Oh, I wasn't expecting it >> whispers the girl, tilting her head to the side. << It will mean that I will beat another home run >> she says, by twirling the baseball bat.
<< Jesus >> says the detective, who asked them for information on the case every day. << Just now that you had found the structure willing to welcome her. She didn't make it, poor woman >> he says, passing his hand over his unkempt beard. << I ... I came to present to you a case, but ... I think it is better that I go >>.
<< Yes, really >> he says with a whisper. << I ... I'm engaged >> increases the dose, ashamed of how much this situation is making him fall down.
<< It is absurd, Sherlock >> chuckles the doctor. << This makes us understand how Moriarty doesn't knows nothing about human nature! A daughter who kills herself destroys her father much more than discovering her stuck in a round of pedoprostitution and seeing her compromising photos online. It is certainly not pleasant, but at least one does not cry over a lifeless corps >>.
He walks away ready to respond with a kick, but, moving with unexpected agility, Martin grabs him by the hair and violently slams his healthy cheek against the wall.
<< This does not mean that there hasn't been >> John replies, finding this man's comment really idiotic. << The smell of ammonia here is even stronger. This place has been cleaned recently, and with care >>.
<< Sherlock, I also live in this house, don't you think he has the right to have my idea about it? >>.
<< What is it that you don't digest? >> he asks and those words are enough to make John understand what his malaise comes from.
<< No, stop it, listen to me >> Sherlock says, placing his hands on John's chest to support himself better. << I risked dying. I got damned close this time and I only realized it by reading Mary's letter. It was very cold in that pit. God, I don't think I've ever suffered from the cold as much as that night. I still feel cold, despite now being warm. I don't know if it's normal. I know, however, that when you squeezed me this morning the cold went away. Even now, the cold is going away >> whispers and John feels his skin crawl. He tries to contain the effect of Sherlock's words, his closeness. John is afraid of making a bad impression, leading Sherlock to move away from him. << I thought that you have always warmed me with your presence, with your words, with the laughter that we always had at the least appropriate moments and places >> they both chuckle without needing to bring examples. << And above all, I thought about how much heat I felt that night. I thought about it while I was shaking in the cold. I thought how much I would have liked to go back there, in your arms. It doesn't matter what happened the next day. It was the last thing I thought of before slipping into my Mind Palace. A warm and beautiful memory >> Sherlock smiles, caressing John's amazed cheek. << I cried for Mary today. For the loneliness that woman must have suffered. I know what it's like to be alone. I've been alone for a long time. Since you are here with me this loneliness is gone. It would be foolish to continue ignoring what I feel for you, to let pride and honor take away the warmth I need. I have a desperate desire for you, John >> Sherlock says, putting his lips against John's amazed ones.
"To hide something, presumably.  The ones in the shed hadn't been used in ages.  If he's used his tools anywhere but in the garden, a soil analysis might tell me where.  We'll see if there's enough mud on them.  We'll pick up the gardening tools in Croydon, then head straight to Barts."
"I will never keep anything important from you, ever again, if I can possibly help it," Sherlock declares. John looks about to protest, so he barrels on, "I can't promise I'll always get it right and know what's important. But I swear, I will do my best to be completely, utterly, eternally transparent with you."
Sherlock sleeps in.  John would rather like to as well, but they're still back to back, and he doesn't want to push his luck by giving in to the longing to be near.
“Uhm. Not exactly.”
“I guess it’s payback time,” says John as Rosie begins to bang on it, squealing when discordant sounds fill the air.
John’s jaw is rigid. He squares his shoulders, nods and leaves without a word.
“It’s really none of my business.”
In the end, neither of them had managed the charade. They’d failed spectacularly in their own ways. He had found himself not being the slightest bit surprised when she left. He’d been anticipating it since Sherlock told him of the man from A.G.R.A. John didn’t buy Mary’s fancy words about moving the target away from her family. She’d been on a mission, albeit with her life at stake. She never would have come back for good, to him and Rosie, whatever she’d tried to tell herself.
Sherlock is trying hard to make this important point come across, but he's struggling to keep his voice from wobbling.  "If there's one thing Moriarty did that I'm grateful for, it's that realisation."
"When you said Brian used to spend time in the shed, I was terrified you'd find something there.  I've never been inside, and I knew he used to muck about
Now the crawling has suddenly turned into speed racing. At a mere 72 centimetres height, she throws herself into sudden spurts of crawling, pulls herself to standing, and starts grabbing everything within reach that’s potentially accident inducing.
"The officers told me this pile wasn't here when they did the initial search of the garden.  Admittedly, it was dark, and a messy tangle of greenery back here, but they've assured me they did a thorough search."
They hear a sudden thump and the stems towards the garden starts to sway.  "Bloody hell... feckin' weed," says a familiar voice.  Then the young innkeeper steps into the pathway and startles as he sees them.
Sherlock stubs out his cigarette and rises.  "John!  We're leaving for Croydon in five."
Sherlock pulls the bagged pickle jar out of his coat pocket.  "When you're done, analyse the contents of this jar.  It's some kind of pickles."
"You needn't worry about that.  I have all the keys in my flat, except when I give mine to Brian, as I said."
They spend the last dark hour of the morning on a bench beneath the station's wide span of cast iron, waiting for the sun to rise, and the first coffee shop to open.
John’s hand feels limp. Sherlock pulls it close to his chest.
Sherlock tilts his head, considering.  "Ah, interesting.  Very generous of you.  Though we didn't actually say, we didn't plan to stay the night.  Or, at least I didn't."
There's a discrete knocking from inside the restaurant window.  It's Majida. Their dinner is served.
Sherlock flops down on the bench caddy-corner to John.
Sherlock gives her a magnifying glass.
Greg, Molly, Mrs Hudson, Stella and Ted gather in their living room for tea and cake. Mycroft is actually invited, to Sherlock’s irritation, but he never shows up, though there is a conspicuous, neatly wrapped package by the fireplace. John will have to write a thank you note to Mycroft later, when Sherlock isn’t in the flat.
It’s strange how some things can grow from just a little. Harry has told him how other plants popped up near the compost, from seeds she didn't even know were there, in conditions that she would have thought too harsh to allow it, taking nourishment from discarded and rotten leftovers. How those tomato plants grew relentlessly from just a little soil and sun. Just as he and Harry grew at Catherine’s, the haven of their childhood, only offering a place free of judgement. As John grew after meeting Sherlock, weird in his own way, getting off on the macabre and dangerous. As Rosie, unwished for, an inconvenience, still has grown rapidly, capturing his heart.
John turns to the glass door, pulling aside the curtains to reveal nothing but the narrow back end of an overgrown garden.  The wind is whipping the high bamboo-like stems of a hedge grown wild, and the rain has finally started to fall.
"I'll be careful," Sherlock promises.
Sherlock huffs and throws a pile of bakery receipts at John. Some of them float and scatter to the floor.  John gives him an admonishing look, but there's a hint of a smile beneath as he bends low to pick them up.
John winces at one of the rider's shrill, high-pitched screams from within the attraction.  "None of Miss Cushing's residents are well off.  I can't see how their position would improve by trying to scare their landlady in her home, as it's their home too."
Those dancing lessons had messed with John’s mind, making him panic. He’d dreaded the dancing lessons for what they evoked in him, but didn’t want to call them off, couldn’t give up those intimate moments alone with Sherlock. He also didn’t have the courage to call the wedding off. Because the alternative to getting married would have meant exposing himself to the man who made him watch his suicide and let him live in the hell of grief for two years. He’d trust him with his life, but he didn’t dare to trust him with his darkest secret after that blatant display of indifference. He’d been stuck in limbo, until his stag night, when he successfully got himself drunk enough to stop giving fucks. The night when he, inebriated and randy, tried to push for a reaction that never came.
It’s so very easy to lie by omission. He’s done it for ages. It’s easy to never delve into deeper thoughts about his own sexuality. Disregarding the occasional drunken hookups with men. It doesn’t really count, right?
“Oh.”
“We’ll figure it out.”
“Yes Watson, it's a bird,” says Sherlock. She has already set her eyes on something different, equally interesting.
do the shaving yourself.  Doctor's orders."  John winks.
”Even so, you should be familiar with the concept. The level of risk is the product of probability and consequence severity. The consequence severity of harm is categorised between negligible and catastrophic, while the probability of harm occurring is categorised between rare and certain.”
"What did he say?  Tell me," John demands.
"I need to see the shoelaces," Sherlock says abruptly.
“Take Sherlock out to a quiet place. Don’t do anything that would provoke you to panic.”
“You thought it was Catherine’s?” Harry is astounded. “It was only us who slept there, stupid. When we stayed over. She always slept upstairs, with Dorothy.”
John needs a moment to regain his breath.  He's never been a sprinter, more of a marathon runner.  Now, he's probably far from the stamina of his youth, but at least living with Sherlock keeps him on his feet with a certain regularity.
Lestrade gives him a measuring look.  "There's something I want to show you," he says.
"Maybe he'd had enough of the constant banging on pipes.  Tired of running errands like an unpaid servant?"
on hold? The agony! The horror!
It really is a crap strategy.  "Right."
“Christ John!”
Wendy Badu considers this.  "Well, I guess I shouldn't be the one who sets fire to this patch."
John is trying to keep up with the note-taking. "They're all from Greggs?  The bread receipts?"
The hot room is sweltering. It has marbled walls, benches and floors, and they start to sweat profusely within minutes.
Sherlock quickly sneaks into the bathroom, turning the lock.
bloody begged me to ask you to come in if there was '
John ghosts a kiss over Sherlock's bulge.  Then presses in, openmouthed.  Sherlock can't breathe.  He can feel the heat and moisture of John's breath through the fabric of his trousers.  John looks up again, their eyes meet.  He licks his lips.
The bittersweet wedding with the shocking news that he’ll become a father.
“So. Why her? Why marry if your heart belongs to someone else? Not fair on her.”
They talk about Catherine and their mother, about all the things that were wrong with their family and how their Mum had ended up as a mental punching bag that had unknowingly passed the trait to her children.
Sherlock feels magnificent.
“Do you know why you did that?”
John doesn’t know what to say, what to do with this earth-shattering information.
"Just like you did before.  This case had nothing to do with Moriarty.  What if the next case does?  What if he starts dropping hints that you're able to follow?"  John takes Sherlock's hand in his.  "Sherlock, it's obvious--code or no code, riddles or bombs--either way, he wants
“Yellow semolina sponge cake steeped in lemon and rosewater syrup,” Sherlock says.
"Oi, leave off," John grumbles goodnaturedly.  "You're not that much younger than me, you poncy twat."
"Oh, please don't."  Sherlock sighs and rolls his eyes so hard he nearly throws his head back.
“Right.”
"So does he want the power, or just the feeling of being powerful?"  John ponders.  "He's got both, unless he's bluffing about that computer code.  So why would he need you?  He got your attention, he even got you to testify in his own trial, and he walked free from it.  He got the upper hand, he's got the ultimate power.  What now?  Why did he give you impossible riddles?  To play games with him?  What does he want from you, at this point?"
"Your idea about a treasure under the floor in the shed wasn't too far off the mark.  Only, it wouldn't be a treasure, but a curse.  We'd find its shoots, growing strong and already penetrating the floor, finding the tiniest cracks, eventually widening them.  Now, imagine this happening, not to your shed, but to your main house."
"Sherlock."  John clears his throat again, purses his lips.  "Against absolutely no opposition whatsoever, I am your closest friend."  He nudges Sherlock's brow to tilt his head back, and continues to shave beneath his jaw.
He nods. Why does it have to hurt so much? To see the truth and once again feel like a
“So, what do we do?”
John clicks his torch on to light up the pathway to their right.  He directs the light downward, holding the torch low to the ground to not give away their presence, and that's when he sees it: small ruddy sprouts peeking out through the gravel, in a very dense formation.  He lets his torch follow the direction of their growth, and sees that the stretch of grass alongside the path is infested too, the stalks higher.  The very foliage surrounding them is the same plant.  It looks like someone has been trying to cut the stems down, and now a new generation of sprouts are taking over.  The hedge-like form they're hiding behind is man-high.  John is starting to grasp the extent of the problem.  He clicks off his torchlight.
Sherlock blinks again, annoyed.
"Oh."
Harry reads the answer on his face.
John is crying. Sherlock can hear his sobs from the other side of the bathroom door, enhanced, and sounding heartbreakingly lonely, by the eco off the tiled room. He puts his forearm against the doorframe, leaning into it, willing John to come out, to stop putting barriers between them.
He sits up, hearing Rosie crying in her room. He glances at the clock and barely sees the numbers through the tears clouding his vision - only 3:37 AM. He must have been screaming loud enough to disturb Rosie. His breath shudders in his chest and he wipes at the moisture on his cheeks.
They’re alone with the palm trees again. They find fresh drinks in a stylish designer fridge, and they lay down in their chairs, gulping them down.
The painful questioning of life choices. The inevitable submission to the state of things and the numbing feeling of being stuck.
Sara Louise’s from the seventies. With messy hair,” she huffs. “At least they were the same size.”
The pebbles and shells are all warm on top, but when John digs his fingers deeper, mimicking Sherlock, they're cooler and moist.
'.  Should I disregard it?  Am I to make a wrongful assumption?  Tell me, John.  You know I don't like to make guesses."
"You tosser,” grumbles John, though he smiles.
"Indeed."
"You whispered in my ear, you wanted my perspective on the case," John offers, a bit of desperation in his voice.  "You wanted me to show off my shooting skills, you wanted me to be in on the hunt of a criminal, even if he never existed--you wanted me
John makes a fuss anyway. He’s clearly having a hard time accepting anything from Sherlock, except his company. Their argument may also be affected by the fact that Sherlock made this decision without informing John beforehand. Not that they had discussed the particulars, aside from setting a moving date.
As it happens, John does within minutes.
“Yes, I think you have a cold.”
He empties his next glass and finally dares to ask:  "Was that what you picked up earlier?"  He indicates Sherlock's lefthand trouser pocket.  "The shells?"
"I don't want it elsewhere."
“I like women too much to stay away for long. I just think it’s good with some peace of mind. Really settling into this new sober life. Besides, I’ve got friends. Lots. I’m not isolating myself, though I understand it may look like it since I’m always by myself when you visit.”
"That fits," says John, then startles when Sally Donovan enters the room.
”Is there more?”
Besides, he’s of the private opinion that it’s far better that she play with household items than risking the flat being flooded with garish playthings of questionable quality.
risk level.”
Now they’re having a rest. Harry is smoking in the sun chair. John is lying flat on his stomach in the grass, watching the garden from the ground up. It reminds him of something.
"Mr Holmes. This has nothing to do with my hair," Wendy Badu says levelly.  "I'm here to stop the insanity.  To give the allotments a chance.  The cost of hiring a professional removal firm would do a lot of damage to this community.  Since Brian won't be around to fight it anymore, I need to do my part.  It was my bloody stupid idea, and I want to try to make things right."
, I made a mistake.  I took her pulse and was convinced that she was in over her head.  I thought I'd seen through her.  But, as you well know, as a doctor, an elevated pulse isn't merely indicative of attraction.  It could be attraction, but it could also be an adrenaline response to danger, or non-sexual excitement over facing an opponent and feeling that victory is within reach."
"Oh, come on!  Give me a break," Molly blurts out.  "Why do you have to be so bloody cryptic?"
Harry puts a tentative hand on his knee. Patting it awkwardly.
He doesn't want to panic like he did the other day, even if it was briefly. The rest of what happened was an exception that proves the rule. It was pure adrenaline pushing him forward. It won't always be like that. If there's ever going to be another time for him and Sherlock.
"Oh, it was just an ordinary box," Miss Cushing says, waving her hand dismissively. "Small enough to go through the slot."
“Not until Mary died, and I blamed him for her death. And then I abandoned him, twice. Like I’ve abandoned my sister. It just- it just hurts too much to watch. To see the most beautiful person destroy themselves. I can’t- I can’t do that, not again, not with
Stanley Schachter’s
The all male close quarters of the army had messed with John’s mind. He had to hide a few erections, terrified of being found out. As time progressed and the squaddies became a squad, being there for each other, eventually a bunch of them developed some very secret, very straight, circle jerks with regular intervals.
Only happenstance interrupted the situation before it became awkward, thanks to Molly calling to say she was late.
The room is smaller, a little more than half the size of the kitchen downstairs, and it seems to shrink a bit more when the wide bed takes up more of the space. He can still fit in a chair and a chest of drawers without the room feeling overcrowded. There’s no need to bring up his wardrobe since there’s a large one built in by the door. When all his clothes are in place, there’s actually room for more, and his heart skips a beat when his mind spontaneously presents a picture of John’s clothes hanging beside his own. Feeling foolish, he shuts the doors with a bang and shakes his head, to shoo the picture away.
Harry sighs and shakes her head.
It doesn’t stop, and Rosie is at the sitter so he needs to answer, snogging be damned.
She’s suddenly on the step below him, gripping his shoulders with both hands, so he worries ash will burn his arm. She stares intently into his eyes.
They're both panting hard from exertion.
“Oh, Sherlock, I’ve loved you since- I don’t know - since almost forever!”
--why would he give a crap about some old lady having issues with the tenants of her even older sister in bloody Croydon, and decide to steal her jewellery?"
John could cry from that admission.
As it happens, they all three sit down on that wooden bench, now covered in dew.  John is in the middle, as a physical manifestation of the bumper role he often takes upon himself when Sherlock is dealing with clients.  They listen as Wendy Badu tells her story.
He opens his eyes, looks directly at Ella.
"I don't know what he was up to, except mowing the lawn from time to time, but he was a good man."  She drinks the last of her tea and sets the cup and saucer on the coffee table.  "I trusted him, and I'm terribly sad he's gone.  He just sat there and I could tell there was no life left in him, so I called the police, what with the funeral flowers and all."
”Even so. It is what it is.”
Majida takes them in her car, even though they're not far from the station, and drops them off with plenty of time left before departure.
“You didn’t want to watch when she drilled a hole in the back, so I assisted, holding the poor doll down,” he chuckles. “First surgery of my life, I guess.”
He’s always loved Harry fiercely. She’s rude and sharp, witty, never afraid to be inappropriate. Has the annoying habit of being right about most things. A bit like Sherlock, that. People who’d never met Harry while sober didn’t understand that that was who she was. It was too easy to reduce her to the rude, despicable alcoholic.
Harry looks at him as if he’s said something very strange.
“Listen.” His voice seems loud in the mostly quiet lounge. He tries to relax his hand, that is somehow gripping the fork hard, even though he’s not eating. “I need to apologise for what I did to you in Culverton Smith’s mortuary.”
John has heard enough; this isn't going well. He quickly runs up the remaining stairs.
They go through the usual. Sleeping patterns, eating habits, drinking habits. He’s got these things under control nowadays. Feels like an A+ student - done his homework, become mostly functional.
“What’s the worst place you can think of? What’s your greatest fear?” Harry’s eyes flashes conspiratorially. “The Pride parade?”
John laughs.
"Yes. I'd really try to avoid that if I was in charge."
"Still none of your business."  She crosses her arms and glares at Sherlock.  "I need to see those letters."
It haunts him, after.
boxes.  She included the leaflets too."  He turns the phone over to show Sherlock.  "Apparently, he had a whole stock."
"Cheers."  John's eyes are incandescent as he regards Sherlock over the brim of his glass.
John is calm, searching his eyes.
Picking katkins from the willow tree, to give them furry pets, finding an acorn cap to use as a bowl. In the spring they dug up small root bulbs, from the yellow spring flowers scattered on the lawn, that looked just like doll sized potatoes.
Now he’ll have to face the consequences.
She points to the words between Dorothy and Catherine's names -
"But there doesn't seem to be any clear motive or perpetrator.  I realise we need to tick off the residents of the house first, as there's no clear indication of an intruder yet.  But, if it's someone external, who would it be?"
Sherlock can't help the rage that suddenly ignites him like a dry forest catching fire from a thunderstorm.
“Okay coffee, tea and cigarettes,” she admits. “I know you doctors don’t approve of the smoking, but don’t tell me you don’t drink coffee.”
"She's not dead, is she?"
John takes off his ring and drops it to the floor. Sherlock’s eyes go wide.
Harry is busy completing her PT training, but has sent an envelope addressed to John.
' becomes something more--becomes a target.
“He’s a meddling pain in the arse.”
"I think it will burn tonight," he posits.
"Not enough curtain twitchers around here."
“You manage.”
That was a blessing in a way. She poked at him, and giggled at his grumpy reactions. It could have been infuriating, but it wasn’t really. It was more of a comfortable, though not always enjoyable, companionable tease. He could relax, knowing she could read the most important things.
John figures Sherlock wants to have an undisturbed quick look around, so he follows Miss Cushing out into the hallway, ready to delay their return to the sitting room if needed.  She withdraws a set of keys and opens a cupboard beneath the stairs, picking out a rather full plastic bag.
"Yes?"
“Well, you’re not.”
Sherlock huffs.
And when he’d slowly worked up the courage to expose himself - ceased dating and committed himself for ever without even being sure of reciprocity - the promise of a new way of life ended with Sherlock smashing into the pavement.
"Her partner, Kate, who we met in Belgravia, later told me that Irene is fond of Scrabble and silly word games."
He sighs.
"I'm not talking about some bloody metaphors!"
“Conditioner. The spa kit. All natural ingredients. And silicone. Checked it.”
A lovely bush of roses, lavender-blue asters (a bee favourite) and, even though the flowers have long since wilted, clearly a patch of calla lilies.  Sherlock has an ominous feeling.  He stands up.
John quirks an eyebrow. "I mean, if someone wants to drive her 'round the bend, they're about to succeed, with you, at least."
"Well, first I took the fire poker and banged on the heating pipes behind that curtain over there."  She points.  "They go straight up to his room."
John finds Sherlock's eyes.  He's equally amused, biting his lip to keep from smiling.
”Yeah.”
"She did."
"Very neat, indeed," Sherlock agrees.  "However inadequate, I'm afraid.  Japanese knotweed is hard and time-consuming to get rid of.  It's a growing problem, no pun intended."
“But the entrepreneur is
"John, I never told you what happened on the day of the verdict, before you came back home," he begins, and it's enough.  He sees the dawning understanding on John's face.
Always assuming the worst about him. Always thinking he’s a righteous, small-minded bigot, looking down on her and her shady acquaintances. He reminds himself to breathe. This is an exercise as good as any of those Ella has recommended. He relaxes his grip on the steering wheel and schools his mind before speaking, calmly.
"You're not slow.  Remember, you are unfailing as a brilliant conductor of light,"  Sherlock says, matter-of-factly.
She doesn’t say anything to that, just discreetly makes a note.
“Who knows.”
“At ease, Watson,” he murmurs.
"She just confirmed it.  She's already on her way there to have a look."
"I can take care of that fuel container for you, just in case," John offers.  "It'd be best to avoid any unnecessary questions."
John shrugs. “I was a clever kid. I liked protocols and regulations, routine and purpose. I wanted to succeed. What I really wanted was to best my dad.”
He presses the heels of his hands to his eyes, drags them down his cheeks. He grips the armrests and fixes his eyes on his knees.
