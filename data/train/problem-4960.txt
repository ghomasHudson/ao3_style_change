“Dean, be respectful.” Sam grunted, motioning to Castiel with his thumb. He made a little motion around his neck which Castiel could only assume meant that Castiel was ‘of the collar’. “He’s got a name.” He hissed before he pulled out a large roll of duct tape from his pocket. How he fit it in there he has no idea, but he went in search of the ladder. There was a storage closet not far from where the broken window was and there was a five foot ladder there for changing the lights under the gallery. He could still hear Sam and Dean bickering while his back was turned. He returned to the other men with the ladder in his hands, leaning it against the wall. Sam and Dean both gave it a quick glance before they pulled their fists out. After a few shakes and Sam designated the loser, Sam got up on the ladder. Dean grabbed the tarp from where it was unraveled on the ground as Sam climbed up on the smaller ladder. Thankfully Sam was rather tall and thus the missing height wasn’t a significant obstacle. Castiel watched as Sam climbed the ladder and Dean followed down below with the tarp. Castiel walked over to stabilize the ladder as Dean set about pulling long strips of tape off the roll and attaching them to Sam’s calves. Castiel heard a grunt from above him and saw Sam looking down at the long strips of tape with a roll of his eyes.
“You could say that.” Castiel crossed his legs over the counter.
“Dean.” Cas piped up. He ignored him as well. Cas stood up. Dean went the for-door handle, but Sam smacked his hand away. Dean dropped his stuff and swung at Sam. Sam blocked and held Dean’s arm in the air. Dean tried to yank his hand out of Sam’s grip, but he couldn’t get his arm free. He lashed out and swung his other arm at Sam’s stomach. Sam let go of Dean’s arm and blocked the other punch. Dean hooked his leg around Sam’s and pulled down until Sam’s knees gave out and he hit the ground. Sam rocked back on his heels and launched himself at Dean. Dean fell back with Sam They wrestled on the ground for five minutes before Bobby got between them and pulled them off of each other.
“Good Morning, Father Freely. Do you mind if I have my breakfast?” Father Freely waved a hand at him and sat in the only other seat available at the small table within the kitchen. Castiel set his plate down, sitting next to Father Freely. Castiel clasped his hands, resting his head on his thumbs, saying a quick blessing before he opened his eyes to start eating.
“Yeah, sorry Father Novak.” Sam piped up. Dean looked uncomfortable explaining their process to him. “Like Dean said, this is probably a vengeful spirit and will only escalate their harm if left alone.” Castiel scowled. The only spirit he was willing to hold a candle to was the Holy one. But he also didn’t like the idea that he was going to be subjected to worse injuries in the future.
“No,” Dean got up and turned on a light. Sam groaned, but stayed asleep. Bobby poked an eye open but stayed on the couch. “No no no no.” Dean looked around, running his hands through his hair. Cas stood up and stood in front of Dean, holding his hands out to calm the hunter. Dean began to take rushed breaths and spin around looking for something.
There was a knock at the door.
.” Cas felt his stomach clench. Sam’s voice was filled with sadness. “
Since Cas had explained to him that they had a ‘profound bond’ Dean had noticed that proximity to the angel had left him profoundly perturbed. He had snuck away Sam’s laptop a few times while he was sleeping to scour the internet for something to explain why Cas was having such an effect on him. The things he had found were otherwise useless. Forum sites talking about their experiences with a term Dean hadn’t even heard of before until he had started his searches, but he had been hesitant to dive further once he had discovered the lingo. He couldn’t think about the way the angel made him want to press a heavy book into his lap whenever he miracled his ass into Dean’s personal space when things like Sammy’s soul were on the line.
“The hell are you lookin’ at?” Dean’s voice is rough, his stance defensive. Benny doesn’t say anything. “Sorry I woke you. I’ve still got a couple hours left on my watch.”
,” Cas informs him. “I’m sober.”
“Jo,” Cas says, taking pity on her restlessness, “when was the last time you actually did something fun? Something that someone your age is supposed to do?”
Cas takes a sip of the beer that they can’t even taste. It would take far more of it to actually give them any sort of buzz, anyways. They only drink them to feel less out of place in the bunker. To seem, from the outside at least, like they fit in there.
“Sure,” Jo allows, shrugging. Cas knows that she’s thinking of Dean, and his strict rules they’re all supposed to follow.
“Oh,” Dean echoes. Cas tries to decipher his tone as he studies his shoelaces with great interest.
“I don’t want hospital food, come on. There’s a McDonald’s like two miles back.”
“Dean, where’s Cas?”
“Turn it off, Cas.” He doesn’t move.
The first time that Benny wakes up during Dean’s watch, he thinks that Dean is talking to himself. There’s obviously no one around, but he keeps pausing as though he expects someone to answer. Maybe he’s really lost it now. Benny is about to sit up and ask Dean if he hears someone responding to him and send him to bed, but then Dean turns and Benny can see him wipe at his face. He goes still, shutting his eyes and pretending to still be asleep.
“But now he-“ Castiel likes his lips and tries again. “He loves you?” Something passes over Cas’ face, but he just tilts his head to the side.
“I’ll take a look at it,” Sam mutters, pushing his chair back. Dean stares at Cas, expression unreadable.
“He’s alive. I know that much. I’d be able to feel it if he wasn’t.”
“It doesn’t look ‘sore.’ It’s at an angle.” he grabs the papers again to the first page, squinting at something. He looks back up at him and sets the papers down for good. “Dean. I’m Castiel, by the way.” I know, Dean wants to say. Castiel seems to know that without Dean needing to say it. “But maybe you already knew that. You were staring at me before.”
Sobriety inches it’s way back toward them, but they’re still a long way out from being able to handle a gun.
“God, I’m sorry about all of it. Sorry we were stupid for so long. A decades worth of bad timing and doubt just because we were a couple of dumbasses the whole time.”
“Yeah, whatever. Y’all were making a scene. What happened to your friend?” Dean changes the subject, half-worried that Castiel will call him out for it. He’s off-puttingly straight forward, and Dean wouldn’t put it past him to call out a stranger. Mercifully, he just raises a single eyebrow and moves on.
“Can I see?”
Maybe there’s a little bit of angel still in them, or they’re on hyper alert after being sober for longer than they have been in a long time, or it’s just a coincidence, but Cas sees the movement first. They gasp his name, gesturing wildly at the road. Dean slams on the brakes, cranking the wheel hard to the left to avoid the woman in the road.
“Dude, this is ridiculous. I’m telling you, you can patch me up at home--” Sam silences him with a look, already writing on the papers.
“That’s not what I mean,” Dean cuts him off again.
The next time Benny overhears it, it’s because Dean wakes him up by throwing something into a tree on the other side of the clearing they’re camped in. Benny jerks awake, eyes wide and searching for the threat, but all he sees is Dean yanking the blade out of the tree and slamming the palm of his hand against the bark.
He waits for Castiel to return. He doesn’t. He watches the door, willing it to open. It doesn’t. Sammy falls asleep, his head tipped back and his mouth opens. Dean doesn’t even have enough energy to screw with him. When the nurse finally looks down at her paper and calls his name, Cas has not come back. He stands up, careful to keep his arm locked in place, and kicks his brother’s shoe. Sam jerks awake, his arm coming up defensively. When he looks up at Dean with a very annoyed glare, Dean makes a face at him.
“He’s gonna be pissed if you accidentally shoot me,” Cas informs her, still watching out the window as the outskirts of camp pass in a blur. One of the guards at the gate, a man that has been in their room once or twice, recognizes Cas in the back and waves. They raise their fingers in a salute and sink back down in their seat.
gun loaded,” Cas points out. They sound petulant and immature. Dean shakes his head. “And I know you’re lying. It’s a raid, and I want to come with you.”
“I want to get married someday anyway,” he tells him. Spurred on by some invisible force, Cas grips Dean’s hand tighter. “No matter what. No matter what they decide, it doesn’t change that I’m in love with you. We still love each other. No matter what. We’ll just go somewhere else and do it.” Dean frowns slightly, eyes searching his face.
“I’m sorry,” Castiel says, frowning deeper when he brushes him off again. “Mark, please. Just let me—”
Cas grins at her.
It’s going to take almost the same amount of time to get used to the fact that he’s allowed to hold Castiel’s hand. And Cas is allowed to smile when Dean catches him staring, instead of looking away with a dark blush. These are good things, he knows.
Castiel ponders the certainty that he would die in the raid. It’s a suicide mission, and both of them know it. He looks at Cas, but there’s nothing in his gaze that suggests he won’t be following Dean to the ends of the Earth.
He leaves the loaded gun on the bed when he goes. Cas rolls a new joint, but their hands are shaking so badly that it’s a sloppy roll and the lighter won’t catch. They snarl and shove it to the side.
“Delta 7 requesting an explanation on the shots fired,” Cas says into the radio. “Over,” they add as an afterthought. They haven’t really been on the radio that much before. There’s no response, so Cas presses the button again. “Delta 7 requesting an explanation on the shots fired, over.”
They manage to get it reloaded and cocked in a fairly respectable amount of time, but it’s nothing compared to Dean’s speed earlier. They fully unload it again and start over. Outside, they hear the engines on the cars begin to start up.
“No,” Cas lies pointlessly. Jo snorts. They imagine the people in the other cars waiting to hear what Dean says about Cas directly disobeying an order that came from Dean himself. If he told Chuck and Jo not to let Cas tag along, surely he told everyone else. “Requesting an explanation, over.”
And he deserves good things.
“So, there wasn’t anything to correct? We are…boyfriends?”
The woman standing in the road looks like she would’ve been middle aged, if Cas had to venture a guess, but the scabs over her skin make it hard to tell.
He was barely this nervous to actually ask Castiel to marry him.
“Mark,” he whispers. Dean rubs his face with his hand and turns away.
“Stop calling him that. Like y’all are golfing buddies.” Dean scoots closer to Cas so Charlie can sit on the end of the couch with them. “And no.”
“You call this peace?” Dean asks, eyes flashing dangerously as he gestures at the ruined joint. Cas guesses that if they could smell it anymore, it would reek. “This isn’t peace, Cas. It’s sedation.”
“It’s not like I did it on purpose.”
“You can watch Earth?” Dean says after a long while. Cas nods. “Is that what you were doing when I walked up?” Cas nods again.
“No, it isn’t—”
“Huh.” They are quiet for a moment and in the silence Cas can practically hear Dean’s mind racing. “Is that because you have faith in me, or because you don’t?”
“I came to tell you I’m leaving. In case you went looking for me.” There’s an implication there that Cas wants to deny, that they want to mock. But they know they can’t. “I’ll be back later,” Dean tells them when they still don’t say anything.
“Do you want to practice this in the mirror first?” he interjects, an eyebrow raised. Dean socks him in the shoulder so hard that he almost feels it.
The tension snaps. Cas stumbles away and presses a hand to his mouth, eyes wide. The phone continues to ring as they stare at each other. After a moment, Dean pulls his phone out of his pocket. It’s not ringing.
One month after Benny and Dean link up.
“You got me back,” Castiel says intelligently. Dean smiles a little.
“Did you just speak Enochian?” Dean glares at him, eyes narrowing, and damn-if looks could kill. But they can’t, so Cas just bites his tongue.
Outside, Cas can hear people shouting to each other. Their voices aren’t urgent, just loud. Orders being given, most of the camp rolling out to join the raid. Most of the camp probably wasn’t told that they’re a liability on the field. Cas grabs the gun and unloads it, setting each part on the bed. They take a breath, count down from three, and then launch into action.
Alone at last, Cas heads straight to their drawer, ignoring the shit roll from earlier and rolling a new one. They have it between their teeth, flicking their lighter, when they notice the man lounging on their bed. What’s his name? Eryel? Something like that. He was in the raid today, so he must’ve jumped out of his car and made his way here immediately. Cas wonders if he got Croat blood on their sheets.
Cas watches Dean trudge by them without sparing either of them a glance, and sighs as the sound of his bedroom door slamming is audible from the kitchen.
to make a show of it, didn’t you? It’s important that these people trust me, Cas. They’re not going to listen to me when it counts if they see you refuse to follow a simple order and then
The spell breaks and Cas is muttering something about his sister. Before Dean can respond, he’s standing up and answering the call.
“I’m glad you called, Cas.”
“Hey! Dude,” Sam complains, gesturing at where his phone is laying on the ground.
To: Cas
Oh. Cas feels his vessel begin to heat up around his face. He looks away from Dean. It only takes him a moment to place the emotion that is festering in the pit of his stomach.
“I said
Cas can’t move. He knows that he is crying, Charlie and Dean becoming blurred masses in front of him, but he can’t feel the tears go down his cheeks. There’s an elation in his stomach that rises to his chest but gets stuck there. He can’t move. He only catches bits and pieces of what the news anchor is saying.
Cas nods shortly. There’s a rush of air and suddenly Dean is being offered a seat in a second chair that hadn’t been there before. Cas is already sitting, staring at the water. Dean looks too, and for a moment is disoriented.
“Cas,” Sam says as though Cas is some great tragedy. “You don’t disappoint him.”
Dean let’s his foot off the gas, like he didn’t realize he was accelerating until Cas snapped at him. Behind them, the other cars catch up. Cas is sure they are all talking about what they and Dean could be saying right now.
“Hm. Close acquaintances, then,” Cas compromises. Dean sits in stubborn silence for a moment before forgetting that Cas can’t see him and shrugging.
He feels his legs moving on their own and he lets them take him to the kitchen. He can hear Sam and Dean talking loudly, so he walks faster. When he pushes the door open, his phone clenched in his still-shaking hand, they both look up at him. Sam just glances at him, but Dean half-rises from his seat and raises his eyebrows concernedly.
“I’m staying in the car the whole time,” they promise. Still, Chuck doesn’t drive. Someone honks. On the radio, Dean’s voice crackles to life, sounding agitated already.
He pulls Cas’s face towards him and kisses him, softer than he’s allowed himself to before.
“Dean?” He considers pretending to be asleep. “Dean, are you awake?” Cas doesn’t sleep anyways. He’ll be nervous all night, tossing turning until Dean talks to him. He might as well get it over with.
“You have food all over your face, Dean.” Before he can use his sleeve to wipe it off, Cas has grabbed a napkin from the bag and is wiping at his cheek as though it’s the most normal thing in the world. Dean stares at him, his mouth half open and his food forgotten. Cas hesitates, the napkin hovering over Dean’s face, and another moment passes that makes it so hard to not kiss him.
Cas looks away from him, something ugly twisting in their gut, and doesn’t reply.
“It’s alright,” Cas assures him. “We’ll be here when you get back.” Dean leaves, the door slamming shut behind him.
“We don’t know,” Chuck mutters, “we’re all sitting in the same car.”
“Thank you,” he says, so quietly they almost don’t hear him.
room for fun.”
“--and fries,” Cas finishes, pushing the contents aside as he lists them. Dean makes a satisfied noise and nods. “Can you eat the burger with one hand?” That is a good question. He considers the burger as Cas holds it up. Eating with one hand is no different than eating while driving, right?
“Cas?”
Even after all these years of feeling, Cas struggles to forget the eons he faced with indifference. He’s gotten better at dealing with and portraying his emotions, sure, but recognizing exactly what he is feeling still frustrated him.
“Do—um, do you want to sleep in mine tonight?” Dean offers. Cas has half a mind to say no. They keep thinking about Chuck and Jo’s slightly condescending agreement that they and Dean aren’t in a relationship. Is that what the rest of the camp thinks, too? But who cares what anyone else thinks?
Heaven can wait. He wants to see Cas.
It takes them much longer to get to the bunker than it took Dean to get to the Gas-N-Sip after Cas called him. He must’ve sped the whole way, Cas realizes as the garage door creaks shut behind them and blocks out the last of the winter sunlight. The car is off, but Dean doesn’t make to get out.
He steps in on Sam’s room on his way back to his room.
Cas closes his eyes. He feels the minimal grace he has left in him swirling and gathering like a storm cloud, looking for somewhere to go. He pushes it down.
“You kept talking and saying all of this...profound shit. Shit about me, and about Sam and Jack, and about us. You ‘n me. And I just froze.”
“I sat in the car. You wouldn’t have even known I was there if I didn’t get on the radio!”
Dean goes back and forth between giving Cas pointless, empty updates about their days, hating him, and begging him to show himself. Benny sleeps through most of the prayers, but he has no doubt now that they happen every night. Sometimes Dean starts while he knows Benny is still awake. There’s no point hiding it anymore anyways. Tonight, though, Benny has to pull himself from a deep sleep at the sound of wrecked sobs from Dean’s post. He stirs, ready to calm his friend down, before he hears the words Dean is trying to manage through the crying.
“Don’t call me that. You don’t know me! You don’t know anything about my life. You don’t get to call my boyfriend a dick or listen in on my phone calls or call me a nickname. You don’t get to have any opinions about my life. You don’t know me.” With that, Cas storms back towards the doors, making a frustrated noise when he sees that they’ve started to close.
“‘s yours,” he says softly. Cas, still staring at him dazedly, doesn’t seem to understand. “Your phone, Cas,” he repeats. Cas shakes his head and digs in his pockets, finally pulling out his phone and staring at the screen.
Cas seems to realize what he’s doing and remembers himself, straightening his back and snapping his gaze up to Dean’s. Dean raises an eyebrow, and he can feel the charm working its way back into his system. He’s falling into what Sam refers to as ‘bar Dean,’ someone he hasn’t been since Benny. He feels the smile growing lazily, without much effort on his part, and he blinks slowly at Cas. Cas’s face scrunches up and he lets out a small laugh.
“Really?” Cas says distractedly into the phone, still staring at Dean. “That’s awesome, baby.” Dean’s stomach churns. “Listen, I was actually about to hop in the shower. Can I call you back? ...Okay. Yep. I love you too, talk to you later.”
“He’s not actually mad at you,” Sam tells them quietly. “He was just scared. You can’t go radio silent like that on a hunt, Cas.”
“What?” Castiel frowns at him, setting the papers down on his knees.
“Hello, Dean. This is Castiel. We met at the hospital. I just want to apologize for snapping at you before. I was stretched pretty thin, and I was stressed out. That doesn’t make it alright to yell at someone, I know that…” He fades away, and Dean’s insides glow. Cas called. He really, actually called. He grabs the phone again. “I guess I’m just touchy about my relationship. My boyfriend...I shouldn’t have called. I’m sorry, this is so stupid. Just ignore this. Okay. Okay. Goodbye. Sorry.” The phone beeps to signal the end of the voicemail. Dean laughs, relief flooding through him.
“Well—what did you think?” Jo looks at them like they’re crazy. “He’s got a bit of a soft spot for you, Cas. If the whole relationship thing didn’t make that obvious—”
The day that they find him, Dean is glowing. He crashes through the trees with abandon and grabs the angel so tight Benny worries they’re both going to keel over. That’s why he interrupts their reunion.
“Don’t say that,” Cas says sharply, the hand that still rests on Dean’s shoulder tightens. “You deserved to be happy, Dean. You—“ Cas breaks off, looking frustrated. “I am sorry that you didn’t get the chance to write your story.”
“I asked if you’re taking any meds right now.” Sam gestures at the paper, looking a little apprehensive. Dean looks down at his hands and then back at Castiel, who has pulled out his phone. He doesn’t want to answer that. Sam seems to pick up on that. “Or you could just fill it out, I don’t have to--”
“...but I still do. I still love you, you stupid son of a bitch. So you can’t be gone. You can’t keep being gone. I need you here more than I’ve ever needed anything. Please. Please, Cas. I miss you. I miss you and I have no idea how big this fucking place is and I have no idea where to look.” Benny aches. Dean’s voice is torn up and his hands are behind his head. “I’m sorry. I’m so sorry I lost you. I don’t know what happened--I turned my back and you were gone and I couldn’t find you anywhere. It wasn’t on purpose, Cas, I didn’t mean to lose you.”
On top of all of this physical sensation is the emotions swirling around inside of him. Emotions he’s read before on humans but only ever felt himself with a dulled perception. He thought he’d hurt when he killed his brothers and sisters, hurt when Dean would hang up on him and leave him standing beside a highway. But he didn’t know what it was to be hurt until he truly fell. Until the last of his dwindling grace was ripped away from him.
“It was a Croat,” they say quietly, even though it’s unlikely that anyone could’ve missed the view. “He shot a Croat.”
Dean’s head snaps up immediately and Bobby raises his eyebrows knowingly. Clearing his throat, Dean looks back down at his hands and smiles.
“They have to decide whether we deserve basic rights or not. It’s a headscratcher,” Charlie, Castiel’s roommate, pipes up, appearing behind the couch, her eyes already fixed on the television. “Has Barack said anything?”
Dean shifts moodily, unable to eat anymore without taking a bite of the wrapper. He keeps forgetting that Cas is already spoken for, and then something happens to remind him. Sam steps around Cas to sit back down and says something, but Dean is too busy trying to listen to what Cas is saying. He shushes his little brother.
“They’re bluffing,” Jo mutters, but they watch her click off the safety on her own gun and tighten her grip.
One, Cas doesn’t belong here. The rest of them, even Jack, are a family. Cas has always been an extra, a necessity to defeat the big bads. They know this, and they accepted it a long time ago. If it means that he gets to stay close to them, he doesn’t care.
“Get on the radio then,” Cas demands, still pointlessly straining to see where the noise came from. Nobody moves at first, Chuck and Jo looking at each other hesitantly, so Cas makes a noise of impatience, reaching to the front to grab it themself.
The night before they find him.
“Yeah. He was drunk enough to throw the first punch but too drunk to make it count. The other guy knocked him out with one swing.” Castiel sounds bitter, and he glares down at the questions, the pen gripped tightly in his hand.
“Yes, she’s bringing my grandson and her husband to go Christmas shopping for the rest of the family.” As they passed Deacon Neil, he gave them a nod and he even gave Mrs. Hanson a genuine smile as she passed. Castiel couldn’t see her face to see her response, but she turned a little towards the Deacon. “Father, could you get me one of those flyers. I want to know what to bring for the potluck.” Castiel moved her to the side as she reached her hand out and he was quick to take long strides to ask the Deacon for a flier before returning to Mrs. Hanson’s side. She latched onto the flier and placed it with the bookmark in her bible. “You’ve got a warmth about you, Father Novak. You have the makings of a saint.” Castiel gave a small smile. His heart broke a little at the thought that his common decency was likened to saint hood in this woman’s eyes. The lack of kindness she must experience had him in turmoil.
“Hey, we don’t play like that, what are you talking about?” Dean’s voice sounded earnest and something about it made him calm down enough to explain.
Morning came too quickly for Castiel as his eyes could barely open up to the early morning light streaming into his room. He lay looking up at the ceiling for a long moment before the urge to use the bathroom was much too pressing. His head felt groggier than usual as he dragged himself to the bathroom. He looked in the mirror and took stock of the dark circles under his eyes. He groaned before using the rest room. It was while he was standing over the toilet relieving himself that he saw marks running from his wrist to his elbow on the back of his forearm. He squinted his eyes, finishing using the restroom before he washed his hands and looked closer at the marks. He had three distinct lines running in long, jagged gashes on his tanned flesh. The cuts weren’t deep, but they stung a bit when he washed his hands and the soap got into the open wounds. He must have scratched himself in his sleep. He was more disturbed at the fact he would have to wear a long sleeved shirt, lest he get the prying eyes of his parish. Castiel decided to wash his arms up the full length of the scratches before he dried off and started his morning routine.
“Cas! Please! I’m gonna – fuck!” Cas felt him tense underneath before he moved so that he could swallow down Dean’s orgasm. Dean gripped Castiel’s hair as he come almost to the point that it was painful, but Cas didn’t mind. Seeing Dean cum had been worth it. Dean took a moment to catch his breath before he was pulling at Castiel to move up from his knees. Dean pulled him in for a searing kiss, not bothered by the salty taste of himself on Cas’ tongue. “God damn, Cas where did you learn to do that?” Instead of answering, Cas pulled him in for another kiss. Cas could feel Dean’s still rigid erection against his stomach.
“It’s hot outside.” Castiel could feel the sun beating down on the back of his neck as he watched Dean wiggle his fingers in his pockets. He knew he would have a sun burn there and he was mentally kicking himself for not bringing any sunscreen.
“What have you got in there?” Dean looked forward a bit to gaze into the basket at Castiel’s feet. After getting a good look he sat back in his seat.
“Now, we do research. Then if that little boy is the one we’ll be looking for then we’ll have to salt and burn the body.” Dean cringed as the words came out as if he didn’t realize the current company before he said them. “Sorry, Father.” Dean rubbed the back of his neck as he looked away from Cas. “It’s the only  way to make sure it leaves you alone, especially since it has taken to scratching you.” Dean jerked his head towards Cas and he adjusted the flashlights grip in response.
“In nomine patris et filii et spiritus sancti.” Castiel murmured under his breath.
“Someone should have told my dad.” Dean didn’t sound sad or melancholic in his response, if anything he seemed almost resigned. Castiel decided to prod a little while he had the chance.
It was a long drive from Kansas to Nevada, but they made it within a reasonable amount of time, given that Dean didn’t sleep the whole ride. Sam was reading a map then he switched with Cas to sleep for the rest of the ride. Cas was handed a map and Dean gave him a brief overview of how to read a map. They managed to get there in one piece minus the occasional stop when Dean had to lean over and look at the map in Cas’ lap because they had taken the wrong turn. Cas stared at Dean with squinty eyes as the hunter showed him the correct path to take. Dean was leaning on Cas’ shoulder; if he noticed the contact, he didn’t say anything. Dean noticed that Cas hadn’t responded to his question, so he tilted his head to look at the angel. They were a breath’s distance away and Dean’s eyes flicked down to Cas’ lips. Cas thought of no other reply than to return the gesture. Dean’s beautiful green eyes darkened, and his pupils dilated. He took a deep breath and leaned away from the angel. Dean pulled out and Sam groaned, but continued to sleep. Cas looked at the map and then at Dean.
Night in the church was usually full of Castiel writing at his desk while the moon continued to rise in the sky. The light shining through the windows behind him. The summer had made every part of the church nearly as hot inside as it was outside, but more so once he was in his office. Normally. Today he felt like throwing on a coat while he sat writing away at his desk. He was in the middle of writing up his speech for Mass when he heard noises coming from the nave. He looked at the clock on the wall before getting up to open the door down the long hallway. He waited a moment, listening for anything else before he walked into the main building. Typically Deacon Neil stayed until the sun started to set, and then he was off to his own home. Castiel took a step out into the hallway before he heard another clatter further down the hall. Castiel was quick to head down the hallway towards the other closed door.
“So, what, do you want a cookie?” Dean shoved his toothbrush in his mouth and began to vigorously clean his teeth. He soon regretted that decision as it would leave Sam available to say whatever he wants without him being able to respond.
didn’t even think anyone was going to call it.” Suddenly the phone got fuzzy and Cas thought he heard muffled voices bickering over the line.
“He’s a mechanic and kind of a scrap yard, but mostly he’s a mechanic.” Castiel nodded his head as Dean explained. “He taught me everything I know about fixing up cars.” Castiel narrowed his eyes a little as his eyes moved down to look at Dean’s arms which were pressed firmly to his sides, as if he was afraid to spread out next to Castiel.
Sam and Dean leaned in as Castiel showed off the fading lines of scratches on his arms. Dean reached out and skimmed his fingers over the back of the pinkish flesh. It was faint, just enough to get the hair on his arms to stand on end, but it made Castiel dart his eyes up to look at Dean who was still looking down at Castiel with a twisted countenance. Dean pulled his hand back quickly as if he realized where his hand was. Castiel covered his arms again with his sleeves and grabbed the flashlight from his shoulder.
They towel dry their hair but leave it wet. Dean has already been waiting for long enough and an invitation to his room like this is few and far between these days.
Cas stops him with a hand on his arm, thinking about the tiny body from the morning, about the dried blood that he pretends doesn’t bother him, about the long showers where he scrubs his skin until it’s raw.
Cas turns his head as Dean approaches and makes a gesture with his hand. Dean swears he sees something shimmer in the water, but when he gets closer there’s nothing there.
“Come on, Sammy!”
“I got it,” Cas says. Dean hands them his gun silently, closing his eyes and letting his head fall against the headrest.
“No, Sammy, get in the back.” Sam looked affronted as Dean snapped at him and pointed to the back seat.
Castiel was in and out of the shower in record time and had changed in a hasty fashion. He had a little bit of time to spare. He decided he would see what it was the boys had done. Castiel walked out into the early summer morning. He knew that the brothers had said something about salt and burn, but he had no idea what that was explicitly. Part of him definitely didn’t want to know. But another part of him was always intrigued to know some facet of hidden knowledge that it seemed the brothers were privy to. He walked to the graveyard and navigated his way through the many plaques and headstones. Finally, he came up to Timothy’s grave and stopped dead in his tracks. Sticking out of the freshly disturbed dirt was the spatula he had lost weeks ago. Castiel felt his heart stop in his chest and his throat seized as he stared at the wary utensil. He didn’t know if the brother’s had set that there or what, but the sight had him panting as he turned right around and headed back into the church. He barely remembered making his way to the back of the church, blowing through his office to the kitchen landline. He picked up the phone only to stare at it, unable to think of Dean’s number. He hurried to his office, pulling out the number from his bible, saying the numbers under his breath as he punched them into the phone and listened as it rang.
“Two weeks ago one of my summer camp kids wandered into the graveyard because he told me that a little boy had led him down there. Then he was grabbed either by the little boy or someone else, I don’t know, but he has been terrified to go on that side of the property since then. That’s the biggest thing that’s happened besides the scratches on my arms.” Castiel took a deep breath before he sat back in the pew. Sam returned shortly after with a shake of his head.
“Tell me what you would do.” Castiel could feel his half hard cock pressing against his pants. He uncrossed his legs and bit his lip. The man on the other line took a breath that was audible through the speaker.
“I think I can arrange that.” The man chuckled and Castiel could hear the man’s faint smile again. “Name’s Dean Winchester.” Castiel turned his head back to look at the top of the booth door.
“No, but I did hear something last night. It must have been rats or mice.” Deacon Neil raised an eyebrow to him, but seemed otherwise satisfied with that answer. Castiel and Deacon Neil left the chapel, but Castiel couldn’t help the strange feeling that settled in his gut. He thought maybe he had eaten too fast and pushed the feeling to the back of his mind when he heard the first voices of kids at the entrance.
“Do you have any other sins to confess?” Castiel wrestled with the idea that Dean’s first confession was less about sin and more about internal qualms plaguing the man. There was the sound of fabric against fabric, but the door to the other side of the confessional stayed closed.
“I’m not going to smite you, Dean Winchester.” The ridges of fear seemed to ease out of Dean’s shoulders. Castiel was focused on his chest for a long time, staring at the light emitting from there.
“Hello, what can I do for you boys today?” She had a cheery voice, but her eyes were glazed over with an unreadable emotion.  Dean cleared his throat and gave a fake smile.
“Yeah, I have drank, stole, lied, dishonored my parents, said the Lord’s name in vain, given into temptations of the flesh, laid with man as I lay with women – sometimes at the same time – worn polyblend material, I have coveted thy neighbor, and I have made deals with demons, killed monsters, I have worked on the sabbath, really there isn’t anything I haven’t done.” Dean let out a humorless laugh. It was Castiel’s turn to let the silence linger. He had heard a lot in his time as a priest, but it was the way Dean said the things he said. Something in his tone had him shaken to the core. Castiel turned fully and tried desperately to see the face of the man on the other side of the screen. He was met with only a profile image of the Winchester. He could see the faint hue of his green eyes, but otherwise he couldn’t see any intricate details of Dean’s face. He had never wanted to gaze upon the face of another man than he did in this moment. If Dean felt the weight of his stare, he didn’t acknowledge it. Before Castiel could even think of something to retort with, Dean was speaking once more,
“Cas.” He whispered. Cas nodded and Dean hung his head. He looked over at the other bed and shivered. He rubbed his eyes and looked around in the blackness.
“Yeah, Cas?” Castiel couldn’t put a finger on the emotion that overcame him when Dean called him by the shortened version of his name.
They were all soaking wet. Sam yelled behind him as they ran. “If you are willing to talk, we’ll be at the inn.” They filed into the Impala. Dean looked in the mirror and groaned.
“Dean.” Was all Castiel could get out of his mouth. He wanted to reach out and touch the man who had shaken his faith. Would he feel human or would he simply pass right through his fingers?
“Please, fuck your hunter, Cas. Fuck, please. I’m so close.” Castiel reached over and grabbed Dean’s face, making him look Cas in the eye.
“That or the bus.” Castiel said flatly. Dean made a sound in the back of his throat as he acknowledged Castiel’s comment.
Sam looked back with a nod and they made their way out of the abandoned mall. Dean held Cas close to him as he worked his way out of the building. Sam fought their way out, looking around corners, checking rooms, protecting his brother. The longer Dean held Cas the warmer his body became. Eventually it felt like he was a kettle and Dean could feel his hands being burned. The pain helped ground Dean in the present. Dean began to notice not only warmth, but light radiating from Cas. Dean couldn’t take the burning anymore and he fell to his knees, setting Cas on the ground. Sam looked back and tried to urge Dean to keep going, but before he could get Dean off the ground a brilliant light exploded from Cas’ body. Dean covered his face with his jacket to keep from getting hurt. Sam hit the ground and there was a horrid keening noise coming from somewhere in the mall. Dean dared move the jacket and the light was gone and there was the skull of a dog lying on the ground next to Sam. Its black orbital sockets staring at nothing. Dean looked at Cas’ lifeless body and he lifted him up. Sam heard movement from behind him and he looked back at Dean. He jumped back when he saw the dog skull next to him. Sam got up and stepped out of Dean’s way. They continued to look for a way out. Finally, they came across two sets of double doors. They were chained up, but nothing Sam couldn’t throw some rubble at. The chains fell in a heap and Sam shoved the rusted doors open.
“For a priest you sure have a filthy mouth.” Dean gasped.
“Yeah, I mean. That’s not why my dad got into the business, but when I got old enough I was more interested in helping people than vengeance.” Castiel gave a brief drag of his eyes from Dean’s face, to the amulet at his neck, taking in all the finer details of the man in the driver’s seat. Castiel turned to look out the windshield as to keep his words from being too pointed.
“I prayed for you. All the time.” Castiel looked down as Dean tilted his head back to take in Castiel’s face. There was a dusting of pink that spread across Dean’s face at Castiel’s words.
They were silent for a while as each man gathered their thoughts. Finally Castiel spoke, “Thanks?” The man on the other line chortled as response.
“You still adamant to leave?” Michael had his own wings flared out as he spoke. He was angry that Castiel was leaving, but something was holding him back from issuing the order to make Castiel stay stationed here.
“Fuck, Cas! I – “He had a hard time articulating as he could only focus on the lewd noise of Castiel moving his tongue and lips around Dean’s straining cock. Castiel used his other hand to hold him at the base as he began to work his head up and down in fluid motions. Dean was unable to keep watching as he tossed his head back and felt the wood bite into his skin as he gripped harder at the deck. Sounds began to flood his senses and he realized that he was the one making them. He snapped his mouth shut with a hard click and as soon as he did Cas pulled his mouth of his cock abruptly.
“No, I came to tell you to leave.” Dean tilted his head and stood. She didn’t flinch or even blink. She stood, showing no emotion at all. Dean was going to speak again when Sam opened the door. He was sweating and panting heavily. He opened his mouth to say something but stopped. He looked at the sister. “This small town can take care of its own.” Without anything else she turned and left. Sam dodged her as she pushed past and shut the door on her way out. Sam looked between Dean and the door.
didn’t calm the malaise in his stomach as he looked at the spatula. He crumpled up the note and promptly threw the spatula in the nearest garbage. Winter had managed to somehow be even harsher than last year. He was thankful that the window had been replaced because the snow was piling almost midway to all the windows. He would often be out shoveling snow until some of the kids on their winter break would help to clear the pathway to the front doors while some of their parents had come by to clear the parking lot with their modified snow removal trucks. Castiel hadn’t seen either Sam or Dean Winchester since that night. At least he hadn’t seen either one of them, but he had been left a large bundle of cash in the offer plate one Sunday morning. By the time it came around to him and he had addressed his clergy, no one had confessed to giving the priest the large sum of cash. Castiel wanted to run out the doors and see if he could catch a glimpse of the black chevy, but he instead put the money in the new parish chest and let the urge to run out the doors fade from his veins.
“Don’t!” Dean yelled. He was barely awake, but he knew one thing and that was to protect Cas. He couldn’t let Bobby or Sam destroy the last thing he had of his angel. Sam and Bobby looked at Dean, bewildered. Sam rushed forward and hugged his brother.
“Why would I be excited about somebody’s death?” Cas opened the file, and she was in worse condition than the first victim. Cas shut the file and handed it back to Sam. The shower turned on and Cas stood up, looking for something to eat.
“Rats?” Dean shoved his hands in his pockets, having set the roll of duct tape on one of the pews. Castiel turned his eyes back to him and gave a slight nod.
“Just six more hours until we cross state lines.” Cas looked at the map in the passenger seat. Dean had warned him several times that if he wasn’t careful he would blind him and they would both be taken out in the wreck. Castiel merely rolled his eyes saying it would take more than a car crash to get rid of an angel.
“I am more than happy to assist you, if you’d like.” Castiel could almost hear the hesitancy in the other man’s movements. Cas closed his eyes as he leant his head back to listen more fully to the man next to him.
He found himself bobbing his head softly to the tune of the music. Sam had some taste at least; he could credit him that. He watched as the signs on the side of the road started to indicate there would be a rest stop coming up shortly. Dean noticed that under one of the signs there was a small hand made sign that had a single word printed on it.
“What are you talking about?” Dean continued to hum quietly under his breath as he scratched the back of his head. He didn’t care that Sam might know he wasn’t with a woman, but he didn’t want him to know that he was with Castiel. He was already a little bent that Cas always showed up when he called rather than Sam.
“Who steals from a church?” The man asked softly as he looked away from the parish chest and shoved his hands in his jacket pockets.
“Hey, Caleb, you wanna tell me what happened?” Castiel got up to refill the water and get Caleb some tissues. Caleb took the tissues this time and started wiping at his face randomly. He was silent while he did so. Castiel put the glass of water on the table and resumed his kneeling position in front of Caleb. Caleb was taking deep breaths now, but still hadn’t said anything. “You aren’t in trouble, I just want to make sure you’re alright.” It would take a little while longer before Caleb felt comfortable speaking. Castiel sat on one knee, waiting patiently for Caleb to speak. His hands clasped in his lap to show he would wait for Caleb until he was ready and that there was no anger in his request.
“And a happy new year to you as well, Dean.” Dean gave a small smile in return before he gave a small wave of his hand and walked down the long hallway out to the rest of the church. Castiel sat there watching him as he went until he closed the other door behind him. Castiel closed his office door and stopped in his sink, staring at the two empty cups in his sink.
“But we won’t hurt you, we’re here to keep you safe.” The little boy beamed and opened the door wide. He ran inside and sat on the couch. Cas shut the door behind him, and they followed the little boy into the living room.
“Now, now boys.” Danny said, walking forward. He tsked his tongue and shook his head. “That’s not how you play the game.” Carey put his drink down and came at Cas while another demon turned the corner and shot at Dean. Dean ducked and stabbed Carey. Carey looked down but didn’t back down from attacking Cas. Cas disappeared and left Dean to fight the demons. Cas would reappear and take fight the demons that got too close to Dean, but he stayed hidden. Cas quickly dug into Dean’s pocket and called Sam. Sam picked up on the first ring.
“No, but it seems oddly quiet.” Dean looked back in the rearview mirror. He gave a shrug and turned back to the road. Cas was always curious what Dean thought when he saw Cas in the back of his baby. Cas was normally exceptionally good at reading the older Winchester, but lately he’s become more guarded, more absorbed in himself and his alcohol. Cas was worried for the day when he wouldn’t be able to get through to the hunter. When his eyes no longer lit up when he was given a pie, or a hamburger was placed in front of him. That’s the day Cas would lose his hell-bent hunter. Cas looked out the window as they drove to Nevada.
“Who’s the kitten?” Dean and Sam looked back at Cas. They looked at each other before answering.
“Father, I have sinned.” Dean said again. The sadness was still lingering in his voice. “I have killed. I have been envious of my fellow man. I have lusted over people I shouldn’t have. I have been greedy. I have been too proud.” His voice started to break a little. “I have been wrathful, gluttonous, overly languid.” Castiel listened as Dean took a deep breath. The words rang in Castiel’s mind like a mantra. “And I have lost. I have lost my brother and I have paid for my sins dearly.” He heard Dean grunt as if he was holding back a sob. “Does it ever end?” Castiel felt his hand shoot out to touch the edge of the partition between them as he heard the grief in Dean’s voice. He closed his eyes, halting his hand, before he spoke.
“Let me know if you get too warm. I don’t mind taking over while you cool off.” Father Freely gave him a sideways glance as they settled with their backs to the road as kids started to run around in the grass, their energy seemingly unbounding. Castiel already had sweat starting to drip down the back of his neck, but he ignored it. The most irritating part of being outside was the desire to roll up his sleeves, but couldn’t as he stood standing in the sun.
. They breathe in deeply, letting the smoke curl, filling their lungs and almost blackening the edge of their vision before they let it out and shake their head at him.
“The cafeteria is literally on this floor, Dean. Your arm is screwed up, not your legs. Get something yourself. I’ve got to fill this out.” Dean clicks his tongue, whistling through his teeth and staring moodily at the floor.
“Hey, I’ve got ya. Easy.” As soon as he straightens up, Dean drops his hand back to his side.
“You aren’t the man I fell for either,” Dean tells them.
Benny closes his eyes against the raw guilt in Dean’s voice.
“No, it’s good that you reminded me. I’d totally forgotten,” he pokes again, leaning back in his chair and setting his book on the table.
They go back and forth, snapping childishly at each other until Dean is steadily increasing the speed of the car. When they start to lose the rest of the convoy, Cas can’t take it anymore.
The line goes quiet. Cas almost checks whether or not Dean had hung up, but then he continues.
Once the words are out, the dam breaks. He curls in on himself, leaving the prayer unfinished. The tears force their way out of him and it’s all he can do to gasp enough oxygen in between each sob.
Dean swallows thickly.
“Yeah,” Dean mutters again. Cas’s hand reaches out and skids over Dean’s side almost absentmindedly. As though his body was seeking comfort and automatically reached for Dean.
“I love you,” Cas breathes the second they pull away. “I love you. I love you. I’m coming with you.”
“Just because nobody else ever ignores him doesn’t mean you couldn’t get away with it,” Cas insists stubbornly.
“I don’t understand--”
Before he gets the guts to chance another look, Sam has dropped heavily into the chair next to him, a pile of paperwork in his hands.
“Thanks, Bobby.”
“Is everything okay?” Dean asks at the same time that Cas says, “Dean, can I talk to you?”
Cas blinks, throws a glance at the curtain again to make sure there will be no more unexpected visitors, and then digs around in their bags for what they’re looking for. The pills rattle in their respective bottles, orange and labeled by pharmaceutical companies that don’t exist anymore. In the end, they wrap their fingers around the first one that sounds full and dump two pills into their palm. One glance at the label to make sure they won’t put them to sleep and they swallow them dry.
Dean turns away from the tree before Benny can lay back down, and their eyes meet through the hazy darkness.
Sam just nodded and Cas quickly left the room.
"Alpha, please take me, take me…"
“But you also didn’t stop me!”
"No problem, Mr Winchester. I am glad to help. " Cas replied with a smile.
“I would kiss your belly and your hips. Then I would spread your legs and suck a bruise on your inner tights.”
He reached for a pillow and shoved it under Cas's ass.
“Since the age of thirteen. He was at my house when his allergy started. It was kind of an emergency.”
But fortunately, Dean's father came running down the stairs at that moment.
But he didn't care. With Cas, chick flick moments were no longer embarrassing for him. On the contrary!
Dean told his brother the whole story. Even the part with Cassie Andrews.
When he came back to the kitchen the Omega immediately took care of Dean’s injured finger.
"I hope so," Dean replied and winked at him. “But I'm gonna bite you anyway before the doctor gets here. Because if we're really true mates, they can't kick me out. On the contrary, I will no longer have to sit in this uncomfortable chair, but will get my own bed next to you. And I’ll get to shower here. Besides, you'd heal faster. So it would only bring benefits."
He decided to start with the news from his Dad. Somehow that seemed to be safe.
Oh god! It felt so good to touch the Alphas skin. He wanted to feel every inch of his mate. He wanted the other man to take him. Jesus, why didn’t Dean just take him?
Cas was his friend nothing more. He had no right to begrudge Cas what he wanted. Cas had confessed his love to him, but Dean had rejected him. So there was no reason to be jealous. Was he jealous?
When they arrived at the Winchester house they found Jo, Cas and also Sam in the kitchen.
“Okay, I'll take a different medicine then."
"Hey, where have you been this morning? I haven't seen you in chemistry." She welcomed him right away.
Here is the last chapter! I hope you like all the tooth-rotting fluff!   ^.^
All he knew was that Dean could either become the scapegoat in this whole affair or that he might accidentally tell his friends that Jody was on Dick's trail. Or, and this was the most likely option, Dean would try to investigate on his own. And that would be very dangerous. Dick Roman was a man who would stop at nothing to get what he wanted. Just the idea that something could happen to Dean made Cas feeling nauseous. He had to protect Dean at all costs. Jody had installed cameras all over Castiel's farm. She was convinced that his farm would be the next one to burn ablaze, especially because it was one of the last properties around that didn't belong to Dick Roman.
“Yeah.”
Dean is smiling. Ear to ear. An absolute shit eating grin. His stomach stops tying itself in a knot. His chest, which he hadn’t even realized was hurting him, loosens considerably.
“You did not. That was not a proposal. And I’m not marrying you just because the government said we could,” Cas reaches up and runs his hand through Dean’s hand briefly, laughing again at the pout on Dean’s face. “Dean Winchester, we’re not getting married.”
“I wanted to apologize too,” he blurts out. Which...no. He doesn’t feel sorry about what he said at all because it was the truth.
“Wouldn’t you like to know,” she teases.
“You think he would’ve let me get away with that?” Jo asks pointedly. Cas stares out the window, digging their nails into the seam of their jeans.
He can’t breathe. It’s hard enough already, Jimmy’s body had grown so used to not needing oxygen that it rarely ever moves on autopilot, but now he’s sucking air into his lungs and it feels as though he’s achieving nothing. His head whirls. Car doors slam too loud and too suddenly. There is a loose string inside of the arm of his jacket that is tickling him and he wants it off but it’s far too cold. He can’t breathe. His hands fumble with his phone and before he can think better of it he’s tripping over his useless feet to slump down on the curb and calling the first person that comes to mind.
“How?”
Cas has never thought of it like that. Every inch of it is covered in the dirt that gets kicked up from the gravel roads, and sometimes there’s a smell like something is rotting, but they can never find the source. Maybe it’s the place they return to, but it’s not home. Surely that can’t be home.
“Very, very close acquaintances.” He catches Cas’s laugh with a kiss, finally, finally slotting their lips together. “Tell me to stop,” he offers, breaking away for a moment. The second between him pulling back and Cas shaking his head feels like torture.
“Definitely not,” Jo agrees, mercifully ignoring the rest of their speech. “He doesn’t go easy on anybody.”
Maybe: Castiel
“Did he?” Cas grabs the top of the jeep and pulls themself into the back seat, stuck between a box of ammo and an unmarked wooden box that makes them a little nervous. “That’s weird. He came in and woke me up. Told me to join you two.”
them anything would be laughable, and now Cas is waiting at home in his room like a trained pet.
“It was a while ago. My husband passed--”
“I do. I disappointed him when I worked with Crowley, and when I broke the wall in your head, and when Jack—when Mary died.” Castiel’s throat is thick. “And a million little times in between.”
“No. I think we earned the title of friends. We’ve even had our first big fight.”
“The left side of the wardrobe is yours. I occupied the desk at the window. I hope this is okay.”
"No, thank you, Benny. That'll be all." Dean turned to his breakfast and the newspaper the servant had provided for him on the small table in his room.
The next months would certainly not be easy, but they would be much better than the last weeks. At least Cas was sure of that.
"What do you mean, Cas. "
No of course not. No man ever expects to be an Omega. Cas shuddered at the thought of the Male Omega Care Organisation. He collected his books with determination.
"What about him?"
„But I wasn’t joking, Sam. I really don’t want a true mate.“
He noticed Dean didn't look happy at all. He also avoided looking directly at Castiel. Was it possible that Dean was really his soulmate? Okay, maybe the idea was a little far-fetched since there was no evidence for his theory. It was just a feeling, but he felt new hope sprouting in him. If it really was Dean, he might have a chance to talk to him. Maybe it was all just a misunderstanding. Dean was only eighteen. It might be possible that he just overreacted. If the boy really was his soulmate, the fact that Cas was married must have hurt him. Gabriel might have been right. Maybe it wasn't the best idea to marry Meg. But he had never thought of the possibility that his soulmate wouldn't talk to him, that he would act so drastic. He had expected to be confronted by them about the fact that he was married and he thought that there would be a chance to explain.  It was almost funny. Cas was always an A grade student, but he wasn't smart enough to imagine that his soulmate could be so hurt that he wouldn't even give him a chance to explain. Why had he never considered this possibility?
"Wait a minute. Your father gives them to you? Why?"
He never felt so impatient to get someone naked. Jesus, he had to calm down or he would embarrass himself. But it seemed as if Cas felt the same, so they both hastily slipped out of their T-shirts and pants.
Cas knew that the heat of the younger Omega wasn't quite over yet. He should rest, eat or shower. Surely there would be another wave or two.
“And I love wearing them.” Cas slipped into Dean’s grey AC/DC t-shirt and came back to the bed afterwards to kiss Dean.
„Dean! What happened?“
Jesus fucking Christ! What The Actual Fuck? How could he be so stupid? Of course! They were both Alphas. Two Alphas, so two bites! It would have been so easy! All this time they were just too stupid to complete the bond?
"Okay. If I'm really not disturbing your family birthday." Cas said.
Cas looked down at his hands. Dean could see his cheeks blushing.
“But…”
“Okay.  I let you sleep then. I’ll be back tomorrow.”
Cas: “Much worse! Everyone hates me.”
"What you should have done from the beginning. Talk to him for fuck's sake. "
This was odd. Usually, at this time Dean would still be in the kitchen having breakfast. Maybe he overslept and was having a shower right now. Cas made his way to the bathroom.
An awkward nerd who enjoyed hanging out alone in a library more than to socialize with others. Someone who didn't mind that sometimes he just preferred the silence. And now this reassurance was gone. Not even a scar reminded of the pretty wings. Like they had never been there. There wouldn’t be anyone who really belonged to him. He would be one of those poor souls who had to go through life without a soulmate.  Since his eighteenth birthday, the hope of a life with his soulmate had helped him through many things. Even if he would have met his soulmate at the age of eighty, there had always been hope that someone was out there who wanted him, because of the tattoo. But now he had the certainty that no one wanted him. Not even the man who was destined for him. He knew it was ridiculous. Somehow he should have expected it. Nobody was meant for Castiel Novak! His mother had already prophesied this to him when he was only fourteen.
“No! Sam is really a Beta. There was no need to…”
“That’s not funny. You knew Cas is an Omega, didn’t you?”
Ever since Cas and he moved in together, he'd practically lived like a monk. Only without all the prayers. This couldn't be healthy.
"Oh, you are leaving today?"
“Dean…! I….”
So Dean was alone with Cas and his brother, although Sam didn't really count. Dean guessed he wouldn't see him until after his heat. But at least Jo would come later. That was good! He loved her like a little sister. Jo was already seventeen and had not yet presented. So it was to be assumed that she was a beta. Somehow Dean was surprised. He always thought she was an alpha. In any case, her presence would hopefully keep him from jumping Cas like a few weeks ago. The very thought of it made him blush. Even if Sam said they had Scent bonded or were even true mates, Dean knew that Cas would never want to be his mate  He had made it clear enough and Dean knew how out of his league the Omega was.
Dean was standing opposite him, tears ran down his cheeks, his hands were clenched into fists and his eyes looked at him so desperately that Cas almost couldn’t breathe anymore. The Omega didn' t feel love for the Alpha anymore, but he wasn't made of stone completely. Of course, he was sorry, incredibly sorry. But pity certainly wasn't what Dean wanted. But what could he do?
The Omega looked up.
Cas: “No, I can’t go around and tell everybody that I married you to help you. It’s illegal to marry someone to get them the citizenship, Meg. I could go to jail for it and you would get banished from the US.”
He himself was an alpha just like Dean, but Mary Winchester was an omega. Dean could still remember his mother. She was beautiful, with blond long hair, a wonderful scent and a beautiful voice. Every evening she sang to him and later also to Sam. When Sam was one year old, a fire broke out in her house and she was killed. Sam's cot was already in the common children's room at this time. When Dean woke up to the shrill sound of the smoke alarm in the lobby, the bedroom was already on fire.
“Let me guess, he did it to prevent you from losing your true mate.”
"Yes, I did. And I have a new tattoo." He proudly tugged at the neckline of his T-shirt to show her his self-created tattoo.
“Hey boys, I hope you are hungry. I made Lasagne.” John said with a smile on his lips.
The fact that he was actually Dean's boss didn't make things any easier.
“Come in.”
"Good! I have thought about buying something like that myself, but I didn't dare to leave Sam alone. So thank you!"
“No.”
“No,” he whispers to himself. His thumb doesn’t listen. It stays put, and he sees the cap begin to tilt up under the pressure. “No.” He turns to the fridge and sets the bottle down before slamming it shut. He presses against it, as though the tighter the door is shut, the farther he will be from the temptation. He rests his forehead against the cold surface of the fridge and closes his eyes. Why is this still so hard?
This isn’t the first time they’ve missed a raid; after they broke their leg, they were out for months. Sometimes information comes too last minute and they’re too high to register that the sirens are going off. Those days, all Dean does is poke his head through the beaded curtain before disappearing without saying a word. This
“And Dean?”
Dean looks at them like he always does nowadays, like he can’t decide whether he feels pitiful or disgusted. And then, to Castiel’s surprise, he steps forward and holds out his hand for the joint. They pass it to him, too high to remember that Dean doesn’t smoke during the day, that he can’t risk being unfocused unless it’s three in the morning and there’s no threat within a hundred square miles.
“It’s alright,” Dean reassures him, doing his best to turn the charm up to an eleven. Sam vocalizes his disbelief this time, sighing sharply. “You heard the man, Sammy. He’s got me covered. I want a Big Mac. You want anything?” Dean points to Castiel, who shakes his head politely.
“Did I? I don’t--I must’ve been drunk or something,” Dean mutters. Cas huffs. It’s enough to pull Dean’s gaze from the roof to look at Cas.
“Sorry. We’re moving. Over,” he says. They roll forward and Cas relaxes into their seat, uncocking the gun and staring down at it. They’re pretty sure they were bluffing. Mostly sure, anyway. They wouldn’t have killed him, but a shot to the shoulder? A leg?
They entertain themselves by covering up their left ear and listening to the way the sound is garbled. They lost most of their hearing in their right ear in a particularly ugly raid, and nobody really knows how it happened. Cas is just glad it doesn’t hurt.
The Impala runs smoother than she has in a long time. On Earth, Dean did his best to take care of her, but at a certain point there was nothing he could do about it. Now she purrs like he hasn’t heard in years.
Dean let’s his head thunk against the wall and keeps his eyes tightly shut.
At least ten seconds of silence pass where Cas holds their breath. He could rip into them with everyone listening, make an example out of someone who doesn’t know how to be a good soldier. There’s a crackle as the radio comes back to life, and Chuck covers his face as they await Castiel’s fate.
“I’m getting some air.” He goes to leave again, and Dean calls his name, again.
“This isn’t some cut, Dean. The thing is fucked,” Sam says without looking up. Dean huffs, glancing back over at Castiel again. He is handing a similar stack of papers to the woman at the front desk and smiling kindly at her. Dean shifts again, tracking Castiel’s path back to his seat. Sam taps the pen against the papers before turning the page. Dean ignores him, scowling as Castiel says something to Mark and gets completely ignored. What a jackass. “Dean, hello?” Sam stabs the pen into his good arm to get his attention.
“We are not—”
“I’ve already been using Winchester,” he admits.
He flops on top of the covers, wincing when his arm bumps his hip bone and runs his hand over the comforter until he finds his walkman and headphones. Led Zeppelin pours into his ears until he slips into a half state of consciousness. Not quite asleep, but definitely not awake either. He is just starting to drift into a real sleep when the sound of his phone buzzing is just audible over the music. He jerks awake, knocking the headphones off of his ears blearily. By the time his fumbling hand picks up his phone, it has stopped buzzing and he has two notifications. One missed call--and one voicemail--from a random number. The area code is from Kansas. He unlocks his phone and lifts it to his ear. For the first few seconds, the voicemail is silent.
“You’re an asshole. Just let me say what I’m trying to say here.” Dean completely takes the ring off and begins to roll it back and forth along his knuckles without effort. It’s distracting, but Cas spreads his hands in a ‘go ahead’ gesture. “I know that you don’t technically have one. So this shouldn’t be so damn hard for me,” he breaks off, letting out a sharp breath. “And we’re already getting married anyway. It’s not that big of a deal, I guess. I dunno.” Cas stares at him as he talks in a circle, feeling almost as though Dean has forgotten he is there. “I wasn’t going to say anything but then Sam mentioned it and I just hadn’t thought about it all that much…” Dean slips the ring onto his finger again and rubs at the back of his neck.
“Naomi sent me here,” Castiel explains. “She wants me to see what the world will become if I continue down the path of rebellion.” Dean and Cas share a look and a silent conversation passes between them. Castiel can’t help but feel envious of the natural intimacy. He’s only seen glimpses of it in his own time, lingering hands and wandering eyes, before Dean shuts down again.
“Dean, slow down.”
Sam is smiling, albeit shakily, at the picture he’s holding delicately in his hand. Cas is squinting at the camera, looking a mixture of exasperated and fond in his cowboy hat. Dean took no less than fifteen pictures that day; most of them he gave to Cas, but not this one. The way that Cas was looking at him...he wanted to keep it for himself.
Dean pulls Castiel from his thoughts by resurfacing from his hands and considering him for a long moment.
Chuck glances at them in the rear view mirror, looking amused.
“According to Harvelle, I’m bluffing right now,” Cas says instead of answering directly.
Castiel feels his lips part in surprise at the certainty in his voice. Of course. His Dean barely lets him hang around now, with his grace fully intact.
