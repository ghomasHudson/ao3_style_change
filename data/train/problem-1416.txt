“Yes, but you barely knew him.”
“You could just fuck me properly,” Sherlock replied. “I know you’re perfectly capable.”
"But you're obviously left handed," the dark-haired man said.
Sherlock tore his eyes away from the window only long enough to give John a look that told him he'd had no such luck. The other man would not even humor such an observation with an audible response.
My right hand slips up from his elbow, curls over his shoulder and around to the nape of his neck, where the starched collar of his dove-grey dress shirt ends with the neck of the suit jacket, and then there’s just a flash of skin before his hair begins. It’s gotten a bit long in recent weeks, but I like it as my fingers brush through it and take in the many textures—cotton, wool blend, skin, silver-gold hair—and then I pull him toward me, giving him a moment to back a way (but also knowing that he won’t).
"Or would you like to come back to my flat and give me a good seeing to?"
Sherlock had walked out. John had halted his pursuit of heat-of-the-moment affection at the grimace and had stared at Sherlock, studying his face and wondering if he had misread something and then there had been a long moment where the dark-haired man had seemed to be waiting for something.
doing it.
“I’m going to make tea,” John said once he deemed Sherlock more stable than before. Tea seemed like the sensible thing to do, if not the British thing to do. Warm tea, the kind that would calm Sherlock further. No sugar; no need for the crash that would come from the sweet.
He spent several long minutes pacing back and forth, trying to remember every face in the park, every stranger who walked by. A woman with a small dog pulling on its lead; a man in a long coat with a paper tucked under his arm; a female Alpha and Omega couple pushing a pram. No one had caught his attention, even in his mind palace. No Alphas looking predatory, not a single person paying them any mind. Whoever the man was, he was just as ignorant to Sherlock and Annabelle as Sherlock was to him.
He looked down at her as she pulled on his finger. “Wha’s wrong?” she asked. But the scent wasn’t coming from her--it was on the air, coming from... where?
Sherlock arrived a few minutes after John and found him tucked into a table by the window, already perusing the menu. When he approached, the Alpha moved to stand, but Sherlock waved him down, pulling off his scarf and shrugging off his coat.
But now’s not the time for that.
John brought his head back up to find his lover leaning forward once more, lips instinctively latching onto the side of his neck, letting his hot, panting breaths slip along the moist skin of John's throat. Fingers tangled in curls, holding him in place as John tried to work out the specifics of the way their bodies were situated. Either Sherlock was much more flexible than usual, or John had been too blissed by sensation to notice some important shifting.
"And why am I going with you?"
On the fifty-third page of a forum thread for Alpha-Omega couples, Sherlock found something that had potential. A female omega with a male alpha didn’t want to be bred and had bad reactions to birth control solutions. Multiple people were recommending a product called an O-Masturbator, which sounded positively childish, but the reviews made him want to research it a bit further. Apparently the omega could slot it between her thighs and the alpha could penetrate it in her place. It was a slightly off angle, but it would simulate the feeling of a true coupling. That was, in essence, what he was hoping to find.
“John.” Sherlock’s brow furrowed agitatedly and he stared at the Healer, blinking twice as if he expected the man to disappear.
"I'll implant it in your hand if that's what it takes to keep you from doing something like that again," John said. He picked up a dish with a damp flannel in it and gently pressed against the other man's hairline, carefully wiping away the blood that had caked against his skin. "You knew I'd be right behind you--"
"You don't want to, so I won't ask you to go."
A rustle of fabric and a strong, musky scent that was unmistakably sex--and then Sherlock got his prize.
I hum contentedly once I’ve sufficiently memorized every second of the last 36 minutes, shifting just enough that he’s clued in that he needs to extricate himself. With a huff, he slowly pulls out, taking care. I can feel his come slowly dripping out of me—he must see it too, because he clears his throat in a way that makes me think he wishes he could go again.
Each professor was assigned different wings and floors to patrol, though it was generally closer to the professor's own quarters, so that when their shift ended, they would be free to retire. Not to mention that the castle was so large, there were still parts of it John hadn't had chances to explore.
He took a deep breath and pulled his hips from the wall, watching as his softening cock reappeared in his own booth. He wondered if is hip bones would be bruised in the morning from his vicious pounding into the wall. His body was exhausted from the unexpected exertion and he pulled up his pants and jeans in a drowsy haze, completely ready to go home and go to bed, to put it all behind him and pretend it hadn't happened and that it hadn't been the hottest blow job he'd ever had in his fucking
"Now, Mr. Watson, have there been any complications thus far? Cramping, spotting, et cetera?" The technician turned on her little swiveling stool, emerging from behind the curtain so John could see her.
Soon, they'd worked into a rhythm, a soft panting of John's name into his ear when the other man thrust against his backside and simultaneously squeezed John's cock. It was going to be over soon, John was sure of it.
My right hand, which would normally curl against his cock and golden pubic hair to keep everything steady, is instead pressed into the groin of his suit trousers, occasionally meeting the bottom hem of his jacket. The trousers can’t contain the smell of him, the smell of his sex clouding my head and making me want to pull him even closer.
How had that happened?
The way the Headmaster said it made it sound like he was reading it from an official Ministry statement, and for a moment, John wondered if he was.
"Ah, well, no rest for the wicked, John." He smirked and reached into his robes. John noted the small satchel as Sherlock approached the fire. Oh, it was going to be one of those nights. One where John was expected to follow without question--or even to ask
The potion was gone. He'd never know.
It wasn't a good snog by any definition. It was violent, harsh, and unpracticed.
--and read his texts as he walked toward the bathroom. He didn’t bother to turn on the light, and the faucet ran briefly before Sherlock walked back into the room. Still gazing at his phone in one hand, Sherlock wiped at his stomach absentmindedly with a damp flannel before passing it to John.
He watched the midnight-blue-black of Sherlock's robes swirl behind him as he hurried away. He wondered if is own flared about as dramatically. And then he wondered:
He’s been fully hard, but now I can taste a steady stream of pre-come seeping from the tip when I run my tongue over his head. Stabilizing it with my hand once more, I lick my way from base to tip, curling my tongue around the glans before dipping my tongue into the bead of moisture waiting at the crown.
John saw himself out.
John chose to ignore that. “You pick three names that start with J. Two girls and a boy. I’ll pick three names that start with S--two boys and a girl. We’ll meet in the middle and combine them into the pairs.”
wouldn’t have been entirely out of the question at this point.
“It’s becoming more obvious,” John offered. At thirteen weeks, Sherlock’s bump was a bit more pronounced than it would’ve been if they were having a solitary child. It was still easily hidden under Sherlock’s coat, and with the weather, it was perfectly normal for him to wear the great coat at all times. But the bump would eventually start to show even through the thick wool.
"Lestrade called," Jonn said. Maybe talking about a new case would distract Sherlock for a moment. "I think he thought we were shagging from the way you were groaning."
I’m so high above him like this, looking down at where he’s slowly sinking deeper into the couch. It makes me feel powerful to be in control of his pleasure like this, even when he’s the one who is fully clothed and buried to the hilt inside me.
"Mmm, a quill. Writing implement, generally of the feathered sort," Sherlock replied, looking almost bored. "I snapped the nib on mine a moment after sending the elf." He leaned back in the low chair he'd been crouched in and stretched out his legs in front of him. His face faded back into the shadows behind his desk, gone from the flickering candles on his tabletop.
"Donovan, please leave Professor Watson alone. He's here as my guest." His voice was thick with something not unlike venom. John wondered if there were many people Sherlock Holmes
“Oh, that’s simple,” Sherlock said, leaning forward to set his hands next to John’s head. “You’re too reserved in the beginning to do much of anything. So you let me lead.”
As it was, the detective should have been in the proverbial dog house for filling their flat with pink smoke that hadn’t yet been deemed non-toxic. But John could forgive him. By this point in their relationship, most destruction was fair game as long as Sherlock didn’t sever any limbs or leave them homeless for longer than 72 hours.
“You picked me up from an escort service, obviously.” Sherlock stood, stepped away from the bed. John upped himself onto his elbows and scooted back to watch as his husband started to unbutton his shirt slowly, spreading the shirt open as he went. “The website would have had pictures, of course. Maybe some of the men were too young for you, others too breakable, some too posh.” John scoffed at the idea that
As John drew away, he saw a splashy header of pink and blue on the website.
” John flashed a glint of gold on his primary hand. “We’ve had a very hard day, including nearly suffocating to death in our own sitting room and--”
Not to mention that John had never exactly found the proper partner to settle down and have children with, though it wasn't for lack of trying. He'd dated nearly every nurse at St. Mungo's, save for a few who were a bit too old (not that they hadn't offered) to catch his eye.
Sherlock followed the scent down the hall, maintaining a safe distance as he inspected each passerby with a subtle sniff. The scent was strongest at the end of a hallway--and he knew, without a doubt, that the Alpha was around the corner from where he stood.
John reached for the condom, but the fingers were withdrawn slowly, still inviting him to replace them.
But it’s real. It has to be. It’s never been like this before.
“And what do I want?” John asked breathlessly, though they both already knew the answer.
“You don’t have to talk about it, Sherlock.” His hand hovered hesitantly before resting on Sherlock’s lower back above the blankets. “You can calm down and drink tea and talk about it when you’re ready. Or never. Whatever is best for
“I’m actually wondering if you’re going to eat that or just keep poking it.”
John found that he was having a hard time keeping the awestruck look off his face as the curly-haired man seemed to preen about the lab. There was something about Stamford’s smirk that made John feel like there was a joke being played on him--how could he be expected to keep up with this bloke?
“How long?”
He was rewarded with two sharp thrusts that almost knocked him into the bed with their force, finally getting the depth he needed.
" and no howling of John's name, just the almost obscene sound of warm flesh sliding against sweat-dampened skin and breathy sighs that sounded more dreamy than someone in the throes of passion.
Seconds was all it took to decide he needed better leverage, and Jon sacrificed a brief moment to stall their lovemaking in order to awkwardly shift sideways and place one foot on the floor. His guess had been correct--it was much easier to support Sherlock's weight, and when he wrapped both arms around his lover once more, they sighed into each other's lips at the closeness of their bodies, pressed flesh to flushing flesh from groin to forehead.
“If you tickle me, John Watson, I will disembowel you where you sit.”
“Oi,” the Alpha said, stabilizing himself and Sherlock at the same time. “Maybe watch where you’re going there, mate--”
Not to mention the regular influx of Howlers the man received in the Owl Post. No wonder Sherlock never wanted to attend meals. As soon as the owls came, it was like a bombardment of red envelopes that would all start shrieking parental gripes at the same time.
They were heading toward the bath.
Sherlock smiled and pressed his lips to John's again, humming softly and moaning contentedly when John responded to his kiss. They kept on like that, with John rutting slightly against Sherlock's thigh while the other man pressed against his stomach, fingers in each other's hair, until John finally broke the kiss again and waited for an answer.
John smiled. “If you like.”
But Sherlock isn’t ready to go that far just yet, and he prompts another slew of frustrated words when he quickly disengages and kneels on the bed next to his partner. His long fingers trail up John’s heaving stomach and chest, light-haired skin stained red from exertion and nearly identical to his own current coloring.
Sherlock's mouth quirked upwards on the right side. "I'll see that you get a new one."
Mike chuckled, and John licked his lips again, looking back and forth between the two of them.
If they lost her down in emergency, his wrist would bear the scar of her lost soul. He’d know it the second she stopped breathing--it would burn and blister to sear away the dissolved connection until he was left with the blatant reminder that his soulmate had been lost before she’d been found.
Sherlock’s brows knit together. “Why would you want to do that?”
"My brother has taken leave for the rest of term. As there are only two weeks until winter holiday, my brother asked that he be excused from his responsibilities in light of recent events." The older man leaned forward onto his desk, staring down his bird-like nose at the confused man in front of him.  He looked concerned, and John assumed it was right to be so. Sherlock? Willingly asking a favor of his brother? "My younger brother is rarely so out of sorts, Professor Watson. I'm sure you can understand why his leave has me wondering exactly what happened in the Room of Requirement."
Something clenched hard in Sherlock’s stomach. Mrs. Hudson grabbed him by the elbow and steered him toward the kitchen, pulling the sliding door partially closed behind her.
John remembered Sherlock's words and nearly shivered with the implication.
Angelo perked up and, after setting down a plate at a table where the woman was wearing a gigantic, pointed hat, approached them with clasped hands.
The consulting detective had been right all those months ago: There weren't words enough for this.
John’s hand settles on the back of my neck, curving protectively but also in a way that reminds me of the last time he held me in place while he took his pleasure. I still, inspired by the flash memory, and look up at him expectantly.
His hands spread fully across my arse as I reach the bottom of his cock, and as soon as he’s fully inside me, he grasps both cheeks and spreads them, allowing me to sink down just a fraction farther. It burns fantastically, and I lean forward to release just the smallest bit of him before sinking back down again.
The head of John's cock pressed insistently against his body and Sherlock held his breath. He hadn't known he'd wanted this so much until four days ago. Now he doubted he'd ever avoid sleep again if John regularly had dreams such as this.
"Who are you?" John panted, suddenly feeling light-headed as the other man's fingers trailed over his hardening cock through his jeans. And then the hands on him were gone--too far, too gone--and the man was stepping in front of John, all long coat and devastating cheekbones and black curls--such dark, lovely, pullable curls--that John instantly wanted to fist his hands in.
“Short-stay reservations with late-night check-ins are suspect, Mr. Watson, as well as the fact that your husband isn’t properly dressed for the weather. Again, I apologize that the assumption was incorrectly made, and I assure you that you will not pay a penny for your stay with us. Should you need longer accommodations, I’d be willing to upgrade your room to another of our suites for the full weekend.”
“I haven’t seen a bit of your skin since the day you had me take those photos for you,” John said, staring into that squinty blue eye. “I think you decided that you didn’t like the way your body was changing and you decided for me that I didn’t like it either--which is rubbish, Sherlock. And I’ve figured out what you’re doing.”
As if in punishment, those hands drew away and he panted for a moment, fearing that it was over, he'd ruined it, he'd wake up aching between his own sheets.
At that point, Sherlock had still believed himself to be a normal child.
John had a niggling feeling in his stomach that Mycroft Holmes was not a man whose debt he wished to be in. He didn't say as much, but it must've painted itself across his face because Mycroft drew back the parcel and tucked it away into his robes. There was no offense in his sharp features, but he took a step back.
John’s tongue traced a path down the skin of Sherlock’s chest as it was bared to him. He groaned at the cool slickness where the air touched his skin in John’s wake, carded his fingers through John’s hair in encouragement, and amended his plan:
There was something alight in Sherlock’s eyes--a challenge, an experiment to be had.
It was large and, by John’s standards, impersonal. He supposed for a guest bedroom, it was suitable. The walls were dark grey, the bed was a four-poster with black curtains and a dark duvet. Everything was grey-washed.
"Oh, John," Sherlock said as he undid John's belt. "We're going to get along so well."
John’s legs shook as he tried to thrust through his orgasm, determined to leave his seed as deep inside as possible. When Sherlock caught on to his efforts, he arched his back, allowing John just that much deeper for the final spasms.
!" The final word bounced back at them off the walls.
“Is this okay?” he asked. He’d never assume again; he didn’t think he could handle seeing Sherlock like this twice and knowing he’d been the cause.
“Angelo would be in prison on a rather long sentence if it weren’t for me,” Sherlock replied, settling into his seat opposite John. He shook off the tale of Angelo’s unfortunate robbery as it prepared itself on his tongue. “I’m sure you don’t want to hear about more of my cases--”
get into a row with your brother on Christmas for a change?” John teases.
"I don't know," John said. "Could be that's why I became a Healer rather than an Auror. Not much into the mysteries, me."
Repeatedly.
1. Shannon
The girl beamed up at her professor until the end of the block, when Sherlock announced that their assignment was to go and find him three other closely-regulated potions that affected the mind in favor of the person administering the potion.
Sherlock wrenched free and gave John a good shove, nearly tumbling the other alpha from the bed. In the time it took John to prepare to come back at him in a lunge, Sherlock had already half divested his trousers and uncapped the bottle of O-brand lubricant, releasing the pheromones into the air that immediately diluted the overwhelming scent of the dominant alphas.
, by some miracle this man was John’s and took great pride in John being
Since their quiet,
And there was so much to enjoy. There was the way Sherlock's skin seemed to burn against John, the soft jump of muscle and unbidden twitches of limbs when John touched a new expanse of skin with his lips and tongue. The soft sounds from both of them (once Sherlock stopped trying to boss John around), sighs and breath and little queues that said "Yes, more of that, do that again" without needing to speak.
Two days after that, he found it left out on the sink for him to inspect.
There was a rustling behind him and the sound helped Sherlock place himself in the sitting room. They weren't far from the fire place, perhaps between their two chairs, pushed out of the way.
He didn't say a thing, not even when they'd gotten back to Baker Street and he stripped out of his coat and suit with precise, measured movements, only letting go of his walled-up demeanor when he pulled John into the bed and wrapped himself around him, letting John touch him, caress him, love him until they were both warm and sticky and John couldn't help it, couldn't help whispering how beautiful he thought his younger lover was, because he could see, too; he could see the toll it was all taking.
“Father Christmas! I asked him--” Hamish takes a deep breath, finding his indoor voice the way his primary school teacher would tell him to. “I asked Father Christmas for a brother or sister,” he states matter-of-factly, as if John and Sherlock have known all along what the little boy wanted. “You just told Father I was getting one. Where is it?”
The Potions master turned suddenly and brushed his hands together. Long, narrow fingers sent small bits of whatever they'd been chopping to the floor.  "Head of the Infirmary, yes, clearly." He eyed John up and down for a moment, taking him in. Blue eyes found his own green ones and held him for a moment, sending a short flutter through him.
“The sooner you go to bed, the sooner you get to open your presents in the morning.” John reaches for the footed pyjamas. “But first, let’s get you dressed and those curls brushed. Then maybe your father will read you a Christmas story.”
“Could I read them before you post them?”
Maybe.
Locked.
John Watson will readily admit that he has always rated his performance in bed based on the sounds of his partner.
In and out, in and out. Each inhale and exhale seeming more forced and desperate than the one before.
However, in John’s world, the awkward silence was of course leading to an awkward conversation with none other than Mycroft Holmes, who was standing in a slightly-warmer locale than the empty warehouse (though John wasn’t entirely sure where they were, just that it was nicer while being just as vacant) and tapping his umbrella against his right shoe. John wondered if the man had ever actually been out in real weather.
And then they realized that they could.
And perhaps a quick wank.
Again with those eyes. It’s hard to convince himself that he’s looking at dead air. He stops wanting to. Gives up; lets his body take control, logic be damned. Presses upwards with a searching mouth, ready to find himself in a heap on the floor. He deserves it. Expects it.
"Was there something you needed, Mycroft, or were you just feeling the need to assert your omniscience?" John asked, tucking his phone against his shoulder while he unlocked the door to Baker Street.
"He kept getting the pronunciation wrong--" The nervous, young professor was picking at her plait while John surveyed the damage to the groaning young man in front of him. The boy was swelling rapidly, his robes expanding as though his entire body was inflating with water.
John’s breath left him in one great, heaving exhalation, only to be replenished by a desperate gasp. He couldn’t remember the last time Sherlock had looked quite so
John furrowed his brow. "How could you possibly know that?"
unplanned.
“There you are,” the technician said. She sounded as if she’d just won a game of hide and seek.
The only tradition at Baker Street that precedes the birth of Hamish is Christmas pyjamas, and it continues now, though with slightly more feet, and a little white lie.
And that Sherlock was going to let him do it.
But he wasn't the sole focus of all of John's dreams. He hadn't expected to be, but on the days when he found himself wandering through London after losing John on a mundane Tesco trip or when he'd had to leave the scene of a sibling argument, it made Sherlock wonder how
“I’ve got a mouthguard.”
John covered his face with his hands. Now he was the one who felt grimy.
I am instantly
“God, Sherlock,” he gasped. He moved his hips only slightly, not yet ready to move much more than a tantalizing wiggle that held so much promise. The hands on his hips were gripping him hard, almost bruisingly so. Somehow, he didn’t care. Let Sherlock mark him. Wouldn’t be the first time.
His fingers settled on John’s hip, and he let his lips tease at the back of his neck. He wondered idly, if their roles were reversed, if he’d be able to avoid sinking his teeth into that delicate skin, tying John to him permanently.
He was carrying Sherlock’s coat and scarf draped over one arm, silently musing at how heavy the damned thing was when a sleek, black town car pulled up beside him. John barely had time to watch his sigh evaporate into the air before the door was opened for him and he was ushered inside by Anthea, who never even bothered to look up from her phone. She could've been picking up a John Watson doppelgänger and she'd never know.
“Has he written his list yet?” Sherlock asks, deflecting. He’s certain that whatever Hamish asks for will be wrapped and waiting under their theoretical little tree on Christmas, but last year all he’d wanted was a toy train. All his other (more expensive, mind) gifts had gone ignored once he’d torn away the glinting green paper from his wooden train set.
If I don’t stop, he’s going to come.
“Now that’s insulting,” Sherlock huffed. “Everyone knows the Queen.”
John took his head in both hands and guided Sherlock forward blindly. His parted lips found John's ample arousal standing straight up against his jumper. The dreamer's hips helped him get a proper angle for penetration, and there Sherlock was, suckling the head of that perfect cock like an infant on a tit.
“You’re not.” John’s voice breaks at the admission. His body is warring with his mind. Physical pain, a bodily reaction to the anticipation of loss. Always loss. But pleasure--points of contact over his skin, through his clothes. A battle of hormones and chemicals in his brain; fight or flight or surrender.
"I need a few things for the infirmary," John said, pulling out the short list he'd made on a spare bit of parchment. "I was hoping to have them by the end of the day, since Molly's got her rowdy bunch later and I'm expecting boils."
, John thought, curling one arm up and holding Sherlock in place. He couldn’t promise he’d never shout or be cross with him, but he knew he could promise this, even if it’s to himself and never spoken out loud. All it took was thinking about Sherlock’s mind--ripe and flurrying with numbers, facts, and priceless data--and he knew that he was protecting something precious, something one of a kind.
He let John lead the withdrawal of his fingers, but he didn’t expect him to lean forward and suck those fingers between his lips with such relish. It set off a sympathetic resonance both in his cock and deep inside, making him clench around the emptiness, and he moaned in sync with the groan vibrating around his fingers.
John’s fingers were gentle, and Annabelle didn’t stir at his touch. A lump rose in Sherlock’s throat at the quiet heaviness of this moment
Sherlock took the invitation, sucking John’s testicles through cotton, one after the other and then back again, making John release him and fist his hands in the white down bedding. The base of his cock was next to receive his lover’s attentions, and John arched his back as the tip of Sherlock’s tongue snaked out to trail from base to crown.
John’s fingers rap on the table for a moment, considering. “I think about you, you know. Every time I hear sirens.” Doesn’t say they moved here because of the quiet streets. Minimal noise. Very low crime. Just outside London. Mundane little town. Private clinic. Happily married, small-town doctor. No one remembers John Watson: Blogger. A life long gone; a flare in the background like a John-shaped light this average man has to block out. “I weep for London’s crime rate. Must be through the roof without you getting underfoot at the Yard.” Jokes. Joking makes everything feel better, even when it hurts. Voice doesn’t crack, but feels rough around the edges.
His pyjamas were sticky, his arse was sore, and it was exactly what he wanted.
Sherlock nodded and looked back down at his computer.
All the tension in his shoulders, all the anger--everything faded away in the span of that moment. Sherlock was staring up at him from where he was kneeling on the other side of a fresh corpse, the Yarders were standing still as if they knew John would shoot them where they stood if they moved--and that was the moment.
Everything was fine. Yes, Sherlock had had a close call, but he'd had several in the time that John had known him. There were bound to be more.
And he had no idea who the man was.
It was their latest row that had them shouting at new decibels--John angry that Sherlock had nearly gotten himself killed and maybe a little miffed by the sheer lack of responsibility shown by the other man when it came down to his own well-being. Sherlock gave as good as he got, reprimanding John for in turn risking his life to follow his--companion? Lover? Was there even a word for what they were?--into an empty underground station.
Sarah considered those words to be the theme of John's life, and he knew it, but she let him go anyway. He figured it was for the best that he didn't mention his reasons.
"I can't just let you in. We've been over this. There are forms and approval has to be given--"
That. Oh,
He turned back, facing John with clear eyes that reflected the steady watercolor of the fire behind him, slowly surrounding him as he stepped back into the fireplace.
“And then we’ll carry them around together,” Sherlock said. He tipped his head back onto a cushion and closed his eyes. “The closer we get, John, the more I think I’m ready.”
John breathed heavily through his nose, trying to keep from crying out whenever Sherlock's body clenched around him forcefully enough to make him see stars. It was fully intentional, and he knew it, but the detective had always been good at setting a pace that would keep John
The porn had ended and the video screen was back to the beginning, offering him various choices, but none of them were as appealing as the one he'd just tucked away in his coat pocket.
"He does seem a bit like that sort. How is he with students, if you don't mind my asking?" The Headmaster raised an eyebrow, making John feel out of line, so he quickly added, "I just meant that when I was a student, we were all terrified of Professor Snape. He was brilliant, but commanding."
"I wouldn't mind having you right here," John whispered in his ear, hiking up the dressing gown and reaching around to tug at the drawstring on Sherlock's pajama bottoms.
“I’d give you the grand tour of the new amenities, but I’m sure you’ve already deduced everything you need to know.” John was standing at his side now, and even though Sherlock had never done
"Pinky has a message for Professor Watson," the elf said, holding out a piece of folded parchment in her hand.
Mycroft Holmes leaned back in his chair for a moment. "He expects a lot from his students. Doesn't suffer anything less than brilliance. Rose Weasley, for example, is one of his most prized students. You'll surely meet her--her brother Hugo is a mischief maker and spends quite a bit of time in the infirmary. She'll be a prefect this year for Gryffindor."
But silence had always been one of John's unspoken rules in the dreams. Sherlock was merely obliging him.
He was just starting to fall asleep--even though it was far too early and he was damned sure he was going to wake up with the worst neck strain ever--when Sherlock shifted, near silently, and moved his arm so that John’s head tipped back onto the cushion instead, making room for Sherlock’s arm to wrap around John’s upper body the way a child cuddles a teddy.
There were no scoffs about Sherlock’s ability to parent a child, no admonishments to John’s sanity about knocking the detective up with twins (though the twin part had, of course, been far beyond his control), and not a word was said about the fact that there was still a real, human skull sitting on the mantlepiece when there was a small silver rattle placed directly next to it (their first baby gift, a token of Mrs. Hudson’s).
He let the dreams begin to flitter into his every day life.
The sensation behind him was mesmerizing. He couldn't see or feel any part of John except those fingers slipping in and out of his eager arse. The breath seemed to be pushed out of him on each inward stroke of the doctor's knowing fingers, and Sherlock had never gotten so hard with such a singular source of stimulation. The head of his cock was bobbing, occasionally touching his naval or curving sideways to his hip, and every time it made contact with his skin, he could feel the wet residue of his impending desire.
Apparently sometimes I update on days that aren't Saturday?
“Sorry,” John said.
, Sherlock thought as John worked his agile surgeon’s fingers through the buttons on his shirt.
The professor settled himself into his high-backed chair the same way he always did: feet on the cushion, knees under his chin, fingers steepled. He was off in his own little world in the span of a breath.
John couldn’t look at him just yet if he wanted to maintain control, so he focused on the ceiling. That is, until the great hovering detective climbed back into his view, sitting atop his hips, cocks just barely resting parallel to each other, hot and heavy.
He felt appalled with himself after, of course. While it was realistic to want to justify a friendly fantasy, it was unacceptable for him to bring himself off with the thought of his best friend's mouth around him. Or hands. Or... Other.
The pause he received in answer made him slide his hand along a fine-tailored suit-clad arm, meeting Sherlock’s eyes below a fringe of inky black curls plastered to his forehead.
Mycroft's face had paled, but he had believed his brother was actually dreaming rather than invading the privacy of their father's mind.
“You’re going to be the death of me,” he declares as I push myself to standing. I ignore the creakiness in my knees from my two stints on the floor this afternoon, and crawl back into his lap, letting his cock settle between my still-wet arse cheeks. His hands do a synchronized once-over up and down my flank before he curves them around my hips to grip my buttocks, spreading the cheeks and giving them a deep massage. “Thankfully,” he adds, looking down at where he is completely clothed and I’m bare to the world, “I’m already dressed for my funeral.”
No texts, and there wasn't a case on. He was probably just bored.
He started walking toward the detective, going around the body rather than over it.
He watched the kettle and kept an eye on Sherlock, but he felt helpless in regards to both. The kettle was ridiculous; there was nothing he could do to boil water faster or, when it did, to steep the tea more quickly. And with Sherlock, there was nothing he could do to drag him out of whichever room of his mind palace the genius had retreated into.
There had even been a very memorable experience with a riding crop that had fueled fantasies for Sherlock every time he'd run his fingers along his arse and felt the fading welts; every time he sat down without thinking about it and had to readjust his weight.
The fingers wrapped around his cock stroked him once, twice, three times and then simply rested against the right side, curved around him so the doctor's mouth could press a series of open-mouthed kisses along the other side. Before Sherlock had the chance to enjoy this slower pace, John drew away completely, leaving him hard and wanting and
“There’s a twist, though.” Isn’t there always with Sherlock Holmes. “The receptionist knows I’m a prostitute. Perhaps he’s deduced it from the way I hold myself, can see that I’ve got a love-bite from an enthusiastic client. Maybe he’s even used my services himself.” John was flooded by a special rage at the unbidden mental image of Sherlock in bed with the young man from downstairs, and he frowned before Sherlock continued: “Either way, he knows. And he’s not letting you into his fine, upscale hotel with your rent-boy.”
Still, I’m not one to deny him when he has a rare good idea, so instead of bolting the door and returning, I simply turn and present myself for his voyeuristic pleasure. Shameless.
Sherlock shook his head. “It’s not enough.”
"John," he said, a twinge of desperation in the single syllable.
“Fuck, Sherlock,
John was on his back, half propped up against the arm of the sofa. It wasn't the most comfortable position to maintain while Sherlock was resting all of his weight on his hips and torso, but the dig of the sofa into his back was a small price to pay for the warmth wrapped around him, for the closeness of his lover's slick skin.
“Harry turned out to be a rebellious teen and a drunken mess when she--”
When John pushed down his trousers, Sherlock turned his head on the pillow and scowled.
“Mr. Watson, my name is Evan and I’m the night manager here.” The manager offered his hand, which John refused with a small shake of his head. Wouldn’t want to
"Jim," John said, keeping his wand up. He hadn't ever had a good experience being startled. "What are you doing up here? Molly's quarters are--"
and the scent in the room had amplified into a mixture of their natural pheromones. It had been nearly eight years since Sherlock had last let himself have this.
And the man had to have questions. He was a doctor. Even without being a specialist in Omega obstetrics, he had to know that the odds of having a successful pregnancy outside of a bonded pair were negligible. It was obvious from Sherlock’s scent that he had never been bound--which would’ve been why John assumed Sherlock had found a way to get around the Mandate rather than jumping to the conclusion that he was a single parent.
Sherlock’s mouth had twitched a little at that. John’s mouth formed a thin line.
“Mm.” John was laid out across Sherlock’s back, tracing his hands up and down his sides. After a moment, he removed his mouthguard and tossed it to the other side of the bed. “Quite good, I’d say.” John pressed his lips to the side of Sherlock’s neck. When he flexed his hips unexpectedly, both of them groaned at the renewed depth, at the reminder of the connection. “Exceptional.”
Sherlock Holmes would come up with a solution. That ceiling couldn’t separate him from his desired partner forever.
"I require your flare for the dramatics," Sherlock said simply.
John's hips jerked at the promise.
As he felt John’s knot begin to swell, slowing his desperate rutting, Sherlock had no doubt in his mind that if John hadn’t had the presence of mind to wear the guard, they’d both have given in. He couldn’t admit that he wanted it--he wanted to feel the blunt pressure of John’s teeth breaking his skin, the flood of adrenaline that would course through him to blend pleasure and pain. Just the thought of it was--
John laughed quietly, breath huffing against Sherlock’s lips. “Shy, am I?”
* * *
John rolls over so that he’s facing the detective, hands wandering up Sherlock’s chest and right arm at the same time. “To you as wel--” A cat-like yawn interrupts him and he follows it with a quiet bout of giggles. “To you as well,” he repeats, smiling his just-for-Hamish-and-Sherlock smile. “I thought for sure Hamish would be up before us.”
How could he be
There had to be some class to this.
powerful, and he needed to strip off his jumper at the very least. Thankfully, he’d married a man who could read him expertly, and the fingers under his jumper began to inch it upwards until John had to sit up to let it be pulled over his head.
John positioned himself  behind Sherlock and the younger man straightened a bit on his knees, hoping he'd be perfectly aligned for the doctor's penetration.
. John could temporarily override his most basic instinct to fight if it meant he could get closer to the tantalizing flesh of the other alpha. He nipped at Sherlock’s nose and arched his back, thrusting into the other man and letting his eyes close against the sensation of being pressed together.
Every Thursday night, John showered at Bart's and then headed to the porn shop, where he'd have maybe two minutes in his regular booth before he was invited into the talented mouth of his stranger--the ever impatient SH--until he was worked to a fantastic orgasm that would leave him shivery for hours, always anticipating the following week. It wasn't quite the relationship John had been looking for, but it was a regular occurrence in his life and he was enjoying it.
Spreading his knees a bit for better leverage was not meant as an invitation, but John took it as one, crowding in closer and thrusting just a bit harder, out of their slowly setting rhythm. The hand on Sherlock’s shoulder pressed him backwards, the mouth against his own was more forceful. This was not how it was supposed to go, but go he did.
will be getting into me forthwith.
.” John leaned back a bit. His palms momentarily supported his weight on Sherlock’s thighs for a bit of leverage so he could rearrange the position of his knees. He wanted to lean forward and kiss that slightly dazed expression on Sherlock’s face; wanted to taste the sweet victory of making the great detective’s brain short circuit like this.
He was late. He cursed himself the whole way to the shop, because he'd let one of the nurses ask him for a favor and he'd checked up on a "family friend" and had realized the fellow needed emergency care.
He wraps his arms around him, tugs him closer.
about any of the items; some are merely things that need to be replaced due to his own experimentation and carelessness (duvet, pants, blender, kettle, and mugs in that exact order). The others are just...
“I haven’t heard a peep from him yet, though I don’t give it long,” Sherlock says. “Maybe eight minutes.”
John pressed his cock against the moistened opening. Sherlock wasn't completely there yet, but almost. A few more strokes to the other man's cock and John could feel the wet heat surrounding the head and began to push forward, up into that warmth while Sherlock arched his back, taking him deeper.
"James Moriarty cast the Dark Mark before disappearing that night."
That was another thing he still wasn’t used to. It was brilliant, of course--this recent development that he could feel one or both of the babies moving while Sherlock felt it internally. Life--that was what was under the pale, lined flesh of Sherlock’s stomach--life that they’d created together.
And there was just too much paperwork in all that.
"Could be dangerous." One corner of his mouth twisted up in a smile before he said "Hogsmeade" and disappeared in a blaze of green flames.
The little grunt that followed told John all he needed to know.
For the next few days, John checked Sherlock's birth control package first thing each morning.
have bad blood with. He'd already learned that Sherlock was at odds with the Head of Slytherin (a bloke called Anderson that John hadn't interacted with much just yet) and especially with Professor Binns, who taught History of Magic.
"Why?" John asked. He felt quite suddenly like he was ready to puff out his chest and defend Sherlock's honor at a moment's notice. Yes, Sherlock had gained nearly eleven pounds, but it wasn't as if he was getting fat. He'd just filled out a bit in the face and shoulders. And thighs and arse, but John was certain he was the only one who got to appreciate those plumping particulars.
* * *
The afternoon is stifling in a musty, boring sort of way—not necessarily hot, but it’s certainly stuffier in here than I’d normally prefer. Nothing seems destined to satisfy me today as I volley between my experiments, sulking on the sofa, and back again. I’ve shut the windows to drown out the sounds of the city outside, the bustling hum of London reminding me that people are going on with their day-to-day minutiae rather than committing interesting crimes.
Now, at 26, he was rushing through the hall toward where they’d just called him down to the A&E. He’d been having a nap (if he could call it that--it’d barely been 20 minutes  since he’d relocated some bloke’s shoulder), but apparently there had been a bad car accident and they were borderline overwhelmed.
“Sherlock,” John said, tossing the magazine back to the table. “You are thirty-two weeks pregnant with twins. The cramping you’ve been experiencing could be considered preterm labor. If she puts you on bed rest, you will adhere to it or I will tie you to the bedposts.”
"Bet you never saw this coming." John's mouth was forming the words, but there was no emotion behind them. His emotions were too jumbled together, trying to fight down the sudden adoration he felt for the man he addressed.
“That was... good,” Sherlock said. The panting and full-body shivers gave away that this was a massive understatement.
before raking his hands through Sherlock’s hair, pulling him closer and opening his mouth to allow them both further exploration. His own hands were quick to slide up the back of John’s jumper, skimming along the skin. The muscles there moved under his fingers, and he pulled John closer, pressing their hips together. He had to make himself a bit shorter to bring their erections into alignment, but it was worth it for the way John responded by sucking on his tongue obscenely.
Sherlock would know the Healer's dirty secret the moment he saw him.
There still weren't enough words to explain it to himself; how he'd let this happen.
He hated thinking about such things--the what ifs, data that couldn't be proven or disproven by science. They took up too much space; haunted him in the daytime when he couldn't force them to delete. Everything was there, reminding him day in and day out that the people in his life had worlds of their own when he wasn't there--and when he wasn't
"I think I'd like you to take care of me here so I'm not uncomfortable on the way to your flat," the doctor said, watching as Sherlock slid to his knees. "And that way I'll be able to take it slow when I'm fucking you."
And maybe they had to choose one daughter to wear the cute little white jumper dress and matching cap for the photos just before the girls were sent home with their doting fathers.
"Sherlock, this is John Watson," the Headmaster said after a few more strange, silent moments. There was no loss of patience in his tone. John wasn't sure there had been patience to begin with. "He's going to be--"
He let Moriarty go and backed away. When he did, Sherlock's eyes came back into focus and the man looked at him with an expression torn between frustration and humiliation. How had they come to this? How had they fallen into this trap?
He was down at least six pounds.
Ever since Hamish was born, he’s been much more... present than he’d been before. His trips into his mind palace are fewer, and when he does have to go in deep, he’s there for shorter periods of time--and he’s even built a mind nursery to store facts about raising children and trivial bits about Hamish. He can honestly say that he loves John and Hamish, something he never would have thought possible prior to meeting John Watson seven years ago. If you told him he’d be a father in three years back then, he’d likely have asked you to share your secret stash of special drugs, because
He didn’t know what time it was. Last he remembered, he’d helped Annabelle with her puzzle, fed her dinner, and then settled in to watch some of the mindless telly that was apparently educational for growing minds.
Sherlock’s tailor knew because the man had never sewn an elastic waistband into such expensive trousers. Various other people knew, but only because they didn’t matter. The people who
“John,” Sherlock whinged, ignoring where John was unbuttoning the top buttons and starting from the bottom himself. Their fingers could meet in the middle and fight over the rest. “Please.”
It was too small, too cramped to hold them both comfortably, but they weren't going for comfort just then, only proximity and the intimacy of the ever-short-lived afterglow.
Sherlock turned so that his right side was facing John. “I want to document external growth,” he said. “I’ve missed the first few months because I didn’t think of it until now, but I believe I can backtrack and make accurate estimates.” Another flash, another photo. Sherlock turned so that John could see his other side. “And most of the growth will be in the next few months, so those are the most crucial.”
"I'd dropped my wand, I didn't have much of a choice." Sherlock, for his part, wasn't complaining about the stinging sensation the Healer knew he was experiencing. There had been a lot of blood after the fall, and John didn't think he'd ever felt his heart stop the way it stuttered to a halt when he watched his genius friend dive after a criminal off a building.
"Miss Weasley, what potion is this?" Sherlock asked without looking at her. John found her again and saw that she had opened her book and, somehow, managed to find the page with the potion they were studying.
The other man was bent slightly at the neck and shoulders in the effort to keep his forehead pressed against John's as they rode out the continuous waves of pleasure while quickly approaching their joint peak. The little puffs of air that passed across his lips from his partner's told John exactly how close the other man was; exactly what he needed to do to bring them both to the culmination of their pleasure.
On the first stroke, Sherlock's entire body tensed under the onslaught of sensation, clenching around John's cock invitingly. The other man made a soft sound in his ear, almost a gasp, almost a moan, but unquestionably John.
Sherlock bore down then, his knee knocking against John's ribcage, and the soldier's wandering hands immediately slid back down to spread and cup and
The thing about John Watson, Lover of Sherlock Holmes, is that he has the mouth of a sailor who has been denied his most carnal needs. That sailor is always there, simmering just below the surface, ready to make even
"Amortentia, Professor Holmes," she replied readily.
But there’s so much more that I want right now.
How had he not noticed a six-foot-tall human being sprawled about on his couch when he'd come in the door? Or even in the moments after?
"That's not what people usually say."
“I woke up and now I can’t sleep,” that deep voice rumbled against his neck, licking up to John’s ear with a pointed tongue. “I tried masturbating, but I can’t do it comfortably.”
How he’d always longed for that band himself. He’d come so close now--moments more and the band could have formed, numbers fading. If he’d been willing to take the chance; to take his stranger’s hand in that dire moment and let the connection form completely.
Something stabbed at the base of John’s throat; a searing realization of exactly what it meant for Sherlock Holmes to be uncomfortable with a topic. Sherlock, who had no filter between his brain and his mouth, had managed to keep this secret for two decades. He had lived alone with it in the back of his mind; taking up valuable space in his mind palace for
Lips closed around his left nipple and John's hips stuttered upwards, his feet digging down into the cushion, which seemed desperate to inch away from him bit by bit. Both of his hands were around Sherlock now, milking him prematurely and lubricating his palms generously with his need.
John watched Sherlock's fingers with a fair bit of anxiety balling up in his throat. How off had they been? Were they that far along? If anything, he had to be farther along than they expected. Anything less than ten weeks wouldn’t already be starting to show. How long had they wasted, stressing over those tests while Sherlock's body had already been working away toward their gift?
“Still seems a bit inappropriate.”
He was about ready to pull out of the wall and sit back in shame, to wait for the other man to leave and then hurry out himself, never to return. Maybe the bloke was married and had just gotten a call from an angry wife; maybe he had a girlfriend out there banging on his door.
“Oh fu—” I curl in on myself as I start to come in his loose fist, and he drops onto my back behind me, giving a few more powerful thrusts before he follows me over the edge. My skin tingles from head to toe, downloading every sensation of his now-rumpled suit pressed against me as John shudders through his orgasm, hips twitching feebly where he’s buried deep.
But they didn’t.
This gave Sherlock pause. He took a moment to replay the words.
“I know you’re an army doctor and you’ve been invalided home from Afghanistan. I know you’ve got a brother who’s worried about you, but you won’t go to him for help because you don’t approve of him. Possibly because he’s an alcoholic, more likely because he recently walked out on his wife. And I know that your therapist thinks your limp’s psychosomatic--quite correctly, I’m afraid. Not to mention the fact that you’re currently unmatched. That’s enough to be going on with, don’t you think?”
John is the one who comes up with the creative fib, and they both agree that it will likely come back to bite them in their respective arses eventually. On Christmas Eve, he wraps his son in a towel after his bath and leads him into the living room, where three parcels are wrapped in shining green paper under their little tree.
The Healer caught it in his fingers, cringing at the awkward texture of fuzz and thick membrane that seemed to cling to his fingers. Bats had never been one of his creatures of choice. They weren't that interesting--they were all over the Muggle world--and they had such a bad reputation in most cases that John avoided them.
Leave it to Sherlock to want to get to the bad news.
would come with an answer John didn’t think he wanted to know just yet. He settled for shedding his bathrobe and wrapping it around his lover. The thin material clung to pale, wet skin on contact. It wouldn’t do much good at all, but the effort made John feel like he wasn’t useless.
John climbed onto the bed after shucking his pants. "Sherlock," he said quietly, draping himself over the pale, skinny form of his partner. "I can't just get it up on command. Just because we're trying for a baby doesn't make it a different kind of sex." He nuzzled his nose against Sherlock's neck and put his hands on the taller man's hips, fingers dipping down until they were between Sherlock and the comforter. "We still have to enjoy each other."
to get what we wanted and we’ve been hiding it for
Sherlock probably should’ve been impressed that he had successfully avoided this conversation until now. But they’d just shared the most intimate act two people could do together, short of bonding, and he couldn’t exactly pretend that he didn’t want John Watson in his life for as long as the other man would have him.
“Christ, that looks a right bit more than twenty-three weeks,”
My own cock is throbbing where it rests on my thighs, weighed down by my arousal. As John replaces my hand with his own and taps his prick twice against my flushed cheeks, I think once more about what a wanton picture I must paint—Sherlock Holmes, naked and on his knees for his blogger, leaking cock hanging hard and completely ignored.
He gave it a subtle whiff as his closed lips touched the rim.
It’s positively hateful how predictable murders are these days.
A Healer. A
John let his head tip back further on the thick blankets. Sherlock was usually more about the “main course” of sex than the foreplay. That he was sucking a wet spot into John’s pants and humming in quiet enjoyment was certainly an unexpected turn for the night. Well,
“Can I?” John’s hand tenderly wrapped around Sherlock’s wrist, stilling his movement. There was an ache deep within the Omega, a burning pleasure that was waiting to engulf him. He just needed--something. And John wanted to give it to him.
If he went in, what would he find? How would he feel about meeting his match and knowing she was a junkie? But maybe she wasn’t--maybe it was accidental? His head was swimming in the rush from the fact that all that separated him from her was a set of doors. His heart pounded with an adrenaline and hormone rush that had come on so suddenly that it was making his head light. It was too big a choice to make in the time he had. When would he find her again if he didn’t go in now? And what if it was up to him to save her?
John trailed sleep-slow fingers along Sherlock’s spine over the t-shirt, finding skin at the hemline and slipping his index finger between his lover’s arse cheeks. He had obviously gotten started before he woke John to assist him; John’s finger slipped in easily, and he thrust in a few times, slowly, before deciding he’d had enough of teasing both of them.
"Catch... You... Later."
John smiled and pressed his cheek against the consulting detective’s cushion of a stomach. Every day that went by, he felt the same way.
Of course, he was being completely daft and he knew it. There was a huge baby boom after the war and the immediate years that followed were prime for people who had been a few years ahead of him.
“John.” Whispered repetition of his name, ghosting across his cheeks, his eyelids, his jaw. John’s hands drop to the lapels on the other man’s coat and he wheezes each breath with a heave of his chest. Can’t be. Any minute now. Waking up. That tugging in his stomach is the sensation of waking. Has to be. Only explanation of all the facts. Still, there is something in his arms. A selfish urge to keep; to protect his mind’s projection forever, no matter the cost. His reputation, his sanity, his life. All worth it for this.
Another text, both phones.
and he imagined this was the sort of thing two sexual partners should talk about first, but since he didn't even know what color SH's eyes were--or, for that matter, the fellow's real name--he guessed they weren't going to talk about it.
The one time they’d allowed themselves to indulge in the wants of the flesh, John had pinned Sherlock against the wall by the door to 221B in a post-case adrenaline rush. This had in turn flared up the alpha instincts in the detective and he’d shoved John against the opposite wall, nearly overturning a table in his efforts to pin his flatmate by the arms. They’d bitten and sucked at each other’s lips and tongues, carnal and passionate, until it threatened to get violent.
And then they--John and Sherlock, a team again rather than two men living in separate wings of a mansion--were going to destroy him.
Sherlock collapsed onto his back after carefully extricating himself. The emptiness was quick to settle in in John’s wake. It would only be a matter of time before his body was ready to demand more.
"Wait two minutes and then leave."
It’s almost always a jilted lover. Why doesn’t anyone ever seem to understand?
John closes his eyes and rolls onto his back, flopping his head on the pillow. He trusts Sherlock’s judgement enough to know that he’s probably accurate down to the second.
Forceful. Interesting.
and take him in return. With some monumental effort, he lifted his tingling and exhausted limbs to cocoon himself around his alpha.
His eyes were open and scanning the flat for danger in an instant--but all that greeted him was John Watson. He blinked away sleep, unsure if he was truly awake or simply having a pleasant dream, but John raised a finger to his lips, motioning to the sleeping toddler on Sherlock’s chest.
The room was blurry, lit only by the light from the bath, which Sherlock was quickly crowding out of John's view as he clambered on top of him like a child at Christmas.
So he did.
Cases missed, meetings put on hold, biscuits and breakfasts lost. They reasoned it was a small price to pay, and John reminded Sherlock regularly that morning sickness tended to be a response by the body almost exclusively in the first trimester. They'd be out of the woods soon.
“This evening, my brother believed you were going to strike him.” Mycroft’s words were delivered with such nonchalance that John nearly balked at him.
“John, I--” Sherlock started as he pushed himself up onto his elbows, ready to explain. John slid his hand up Sherlock’s chest to keep him from rising all the way, but he sat back himself, resting on his calves.
.” John’s neck arches as he tosses his head back on the pillow, groaning and thrusting his hips off the bed only to be pressed right back down. His fingernails dig into the flesh of Sherlock’s thighs, leaving small crescents in their stead. “I’m going to come,
It didn’t take a detective to see that Sherlock’s insemination date had overlapped with John Watson’s injury. Of course, at the time, the Alpha had somehow been listed as deceased in the system, so his swimmers had been called to action for Queen and country.
“I can do that,” he says, pressing one last kiss to my shoulder before turning and walking into the kitchen.
John reaches out, offering the tea. When Sherlock accepts it, the doctor settles onto the couch, wiggling his toes so they’re warm under his lover’s thighs. “You know how excited Hamish will be to see Father Christmas again. This is the first year he really understands it. He's got the holiday spirit.”
They’d been across from each other for most of the argument. It was when John moved toward his partner with the intention of drawing him into a fierce embrace that Sherlock had--and there was really only one word for it--flinched. His body had had an involuntary reaction to John’s approach, and while John knew that he had probably been red-faced and menacing, surely Sherlock’s deductive abilities would’ve told him that in that moment, there was one thing John needed. John Watson, who Sherlock himself chided on being
He was pulled back by John's dry hand, hips held firmly in place. It didn't take a genius (though Sherlock was one, of course) to know that John's other hand was busy with preparatory business.
When John got Sherlock to sleep an hour and a half later, he watched his lover's long fingers curl into the covers just above his naval and clutch for a long moment before relaxing.
So I’m sat waiting for him to come back to Baker Street like some idle teen sitting by a stubbornly silent phone. Not that I think his return will make this Tuesday afternoon any less trite, but having him to moan at certainly improves my day by degrees.
"Thank you, Miffy," he said, his voice gravelly with sleep. The elf disappeared a moment later and John rolled out of bed. His head was throbbing and he felt like he hadn't slept in days. He didn't remember going to sleep the night before, so it was possible that he had barely caught a wink.
“That’s absurd.” John directed it more at the manager and receptionist than at Sherlock, since of course Sherlock was always right. But. “A prostitute?

that John heard through the wall.
He needed his memories back, memories that had been stolen from him by James Moriarty.
The only reason he hadn't come yet was sheer force of will to see if John had more to give him.
“You’re wrong, of course,” Sherlock said a moment later. Before John could admonish him for his doubts, Sherlock added, “I’m certain they’ll be brilliant, but I doubt our children will be quite at the level of such rhymes from birth. We’re at least a year from fingerplay.”
“You’ve said those words a dozen times in relation to the name game and they have never once preceded good ideas.”
Before John could argue with the woman--or even ask her for some kind of credentials--Sherlock had come up behind her, looming large over her like an oversized bat. He hadn't seen the other man since arriving at the Ministry. He was relieved he'd made the right choice in choosing to navigate himself toward the law enforcement offices.
. Lowering my face to the base of his cock, I stroke the head with one hand and look up to meet his half-lidded eyes. It’s easy to give in to the urge to snake my tongue along the base where he’s still slightly contained by his trousers.
to his guest and tapped the front page twice when John looked down. "A series of what appear to be suicides, but I believe them to be murders."
John swallowed and ran a hand through his hair before looking toward the windows. It was starting to snow.
"Piss off."
. The last thing he needed was a pneumonia-ridden detective on his hands. He tried the knob.
As further invitation, Sherlock parted his lips and licked them slowly, knowing that if John's attention hadn't been on his face before, it was now.
Even though he had resolved himself not to think about the extent of the abuse Sherlock had suffered, John found that he was hesitant to reach out and touch Sherlock now that he had the other man within his reach. It was ridiculous to look at the lithe frame stretched out in front of him and wonder how small he had been when a fully-grown man had taken to shoving him around. It was hard not to wonder if his own lips had passed over pale skin that had once blushed purple with bruises inflicted by a father’s hand. And it pained John to think it had been his own temper that had triggered those memories in Sherlock--that it had been his own hands Sherlock had expected to strike out.
It took a few minutes to maneuver his stiff limbs into fresh robes, and there was a painful jolt through his neck whenever he moved too quickly. It felt like he'd had a few too many drinks down at the pub, as unlikely as he knew it was. Then again, he couldn't remember the previous night in the slightest, so he supposed maybe it was possible. When Sherlock was on a stakeout, it wasn't uncommon for John to have a brew or two....
"No, you won't," Moriarty countered quickly. He sounded amused, confident.
“You came back.”
And John was offering to wear it without request.
“Speak for yourself.” He grabs my arm and pulls me none-too-gently onto his lap, letting me straddle his suited thighs and hips. I imagine the way the trail of lube dripping down my thighs must leave patches on the fabric of his suit, staining the trousers irreparably.
“That makes no sense, Sherlock,” John protested.
“We’re keeping from telling people because as soon as we do, it will become a question of ‘
When it was too much for his softening member, John gently disengaged. He sat back on Sherlock's stomach, moving away carefully. Sherlock heard and felt the other man zipping himself back into his trousers before John moved again on the bed.
"Quite right, Miss Weasley. You may return to your seat."
Sherlock's arms wrapped around him tighter and John knew the other man was close. Torn between wanting to help him along with a hand and gripping that arse to hold them together during their orgasm, John let Sherlock's body choose.
Sherlock, being both unbound and uninterested, had been intent to ignore the Mandate and risk being caught out, until Mycroft had intervened.
As that body worked him, John gave a few feeble thrusts, reaching down and holding the condom on with two fingers until the other man pulled away.
The O-brand was still present in the air, but it was becoming less and less effective with every moment. Their bodies were giving off more and more of their own pheromones as the peak grew closer. Sherlock could sense that John’s self-control was dwindling, and he took advantage of it in the only way he knew how.
John took a deep breath and fought the urge to get up and punch a wall. Now was not the time to defend Sherlock’s honor. “It’s not just this, Sherlock. If you hadn’t... if--” He stopped himself. He didn’t want to bring back the memories of hours past. “What if that hadn’t happened, Sherlock? What if we went through with it and started doing that regularly? How would I ever know you weren’t enjoying it if you just lay back and think of England?”
When he saw the brief hesitation that Sherlock couldn’t hide at the idea of being in such a vulnerable position, he raised the small case in his hand.
“I fail to see how that’s relevant--”
The sensation was certainly more than he'd dared to anticipate. Tight, wet heat intensified by the pulse of John's cock against his own as they both shifted further inside. What would be like when their knots--
John started pacing again for a moment, just a quick back and forth. “I’m not saying I’m never coming back, Sherlock, I just... I can’t to meet her right now, not with my head like this. I need to... I don’t know. Take a walk. Will you be--can I come back later?”
, the other man had to have planned this in advance because it was slick and tight and
“I’ve a reservation under Watson,” John said, tapping his credit card against the granite countertop. The young man at the computer smiled politely and started clicking through reservations.
“Sherlock, no, please,” John said, squeezing both of his hands and resting his head on Sherlock’s shoulder. “Sherlock, if you told me right now that you were completely put off sex for the rest of your life, I’d be fine. It doesn’t matter to me like you do.” It’d be a loss, he wouldn’t deny that under any circumstances. Sex with Sherlock was never short of extraordinary. He looked up into Sherlock’s eyes and found that they’d gotten most of the blue coloring back. Sherlock was there now; the Sherlock John knew. Loved.
A warm swarm of butterflies took off in his stomach at the thought, not completely unwelcome. He could only hope John couldn’t feel them fluttering away beneath his fingers.
The point of his tie touches my cheek, but he pushes it away, leaving his hand there in its wake.
Sherlock nodded and watched John press the guard into his mouth before slowly dragging himself up on lazy limbs. His entire world was slowly condensing into this room, and all he consciously wanted was for this man to mount him and give him the sweet release he needed. He leaned down on his elbows, enjoying the muffled gasp that came from behind him as his arse was presented fully, completely on display for his Alpha.
It’s something he’ll have to think about.
Breathing was boring, except when it wasn't. When Sherlock Holmes was breathing, gasping, riding you with a slow, intimate roll of his hips in the middle of a Sunday afternoon, nothing could be further from boring.
He was pushed back onto the pillows and Sherlock would have mourned the loss if he hadn't known that John's fingers were necessary to unbutton his jeans.
His hand was about to continue its work on his now-disappointed-to-not-be-in-a-mouth cock, but the fingers reappeared, holding a foil packet--strawberry flavored, John noticed--as if to say "I'm ready for your next excuse."
This time, they'd both leave satisfied.
He took his chance with a mind-cast silencing charm aimed at the staircase. He wasn't sure it would work, but his first step onto the rickety wood was silent save for the pounding of his own heart, and John breathed quietly with a sharp rasp as he moved slowly from one broken piece of ply to the next.
And maybe even a desire for children
for the situation was turning him on so thoroughly without even being touched by the dreamer.
John looked down at his wrist once more. It was one thing to have your match not be the blonde-haired, blue-eyed beauty you expected her to be. Fantasies were aptly named for a reason, after all.
When you’ve eliminated the impossible... But,
“Shhhhhh,” John said, tightening his grip on Sherlock’s wrists.
“Oh!” Mrs. Hudson clutched the back of the chair she was standing by for a moment, looking back into the sitting room at where Annabelle was flipping over the maze to clear it and start again. “Oh, that sweet dear. But I thought her Alpha was dead?”
John reached for the Floo powder. When he set the jar back down, he raised his fistful of silver dust to the skull. "Wish me luck, then."
John’s nerves told Sherlock he was about to ask about Annabelle, about her improbable existence.
He wanted John to be jealous of himself without knowing it.
They were in Regent’s Park on a rare, sunny afternoon. It was a case-free Tuesday; Annabelle had awakened at first light and demanded to go outside. Her father, who had barely slept in the preceding 72 hours, somehow convinced her to tuck up next to him for another two hours. His sleep was restless while the three-year-old colored in a coloring book that was propped up against his side, but it had been enough. As expected, he eventually opened his eyes again and found that his sheets and torso had been scribbled on.
John’s only hope was that they not scar. With Sherlock’s stubborn refusal to stop itching at the hives, this was practically a given.
That simply won’t do.
“My brother’s position within the government had him well-placed to find me an array of potential suitors, but I couldn’t be persuaded. I was determined not to be bound. So he went through some back channels to procure me a donor sample from a deceased serviceman.” The pause was pointed, and Sherlock narrowed his eyes, knowing that John would put the pieces together. He may not have possessed Sherlock’s massive intellect, but he was no imbecile.
But the man crawled up Sherlock’s body and let their cocks align for a moment, pressed together and leaking. Sherlock’s was significantly smaller--as was normal with male Omegas--but when the sensitive head rubbed up against the smoldering knot at John’s base, he thought he might die from the anticipation.
Stuart
"Good day, Mycroft." John ended the call and trudged up the stairs, feeling heavy, like the little shopping bag in his hand held a possibility so close to being a reality that he wasn't sure he could think of it without soaring. He didn't know if Sherlock recognized the symptoms, or if he had and was just ignoring them because he was slowly losing hope after their four months of effort had borne no fruit.
He'd felt mortified when he was witness to Mycroft's first wet dream a year and a half later. He could never look at his French tutor the same way.
Maybe he'd get quickies in the supply closet like he used to when he was in his residency.
dreams made John feel when he woke up. Did he wonder why he hadn't dreamed of his flatmate or did he just curse his sister and carry on?
Probably should’ve figured that out, yeah.
"Good morning, Molly," John said when he was closer, nodding politely.
* * *
His hands splay across my arse cheeks (further proving to no one but me that John Watson is an arse man) giving me an appreciative squeeze. And then he withdraws one hand to help guide his cock home.
“Mm-nnn,” I respond, shaking my head against his lips. “It was exactly what I wanted.”
John watched as Sherlock spoke with an Auror just at the end of the path. The silver-haired man was offering Sherlock a heavy golden cloak to keep him warm, but the younger man kept trying to shrug it off. Finally, the Auror gave up and Sherlock walked away from him, ignoring the man's calls for him to return. Instead, his eyes focused on John's through the dark of the night and he approached his new colleague, stopping a step closer than personal boundaries normally allowed.
John nodded agreement, but he was having a hard time processing. Was Sherlock telling him he didn’t want to see him for the next four weeks?
The Potions master waved his hand, waking the fire to a clear light, and reached for an uncapped jar that was resting below a--yes, that was a real, actual human skull. He took a handful of glittering powder and tossed it into the fire, turning it a bright emerald that danced on his dark robes and pale skin.
He gestured over his shoulder back the way he’d come from and she nodded in understanding. When he turned, the clock stalled for a moment on 19 before resetting itself to ten years--the longest gap John had ever seen since it first reset eight years prior. But, as he knew, that could change at any time.
"And of course you wouldn't be able to cherish it for very long." He paused, giving Sherlock a moment to consider the implications of his words. When he was still alive after five seconds, he simple said "
“I wouldn’t trade any of this for anything, John,” Sherlock said. His voice was quiet, almost grumbly as he began to drift to sleep. Before John could think of a suitable reply, he could feel Sherlock’s belly rising and falling with each sleepy breath beneath his fingers.
Sherlock's case.
it was beautiful. The sensation of Sherlock’s cock pulsing against his stomach and the rhythmic contractions of his body around him and
John hooked one leg around Sherlock's waist, hoping to get a bit more leverage, and before he knew it he was being pressed back into one of the columns that decorated the room, lifted against it high enough that he could wrap both legs around Sherlock's waist. The ornate carvings imprinted in his back as he was molded against the wall, caught between bronze and body.
And how had he gotten flatmate’s from a glance?
John Watson was left to wonder if he’d be eaten out of house and home before the twins were born.
Somehow, it was an easy friendship to fall into. Most of the time, he didn't even feel like his privacy was being invaded.
“Can I go to bed right now?” Hamish asks. He stands, holding his new jim-jams like a security blanket and Sherlock wonders if he’ll ever hear the boy ask that question again.
“Stay,” he said quietly before adding a childshly broken, “Please.”
“I need you again.”
The other man didn’t humor him with a reply, simply lowered his mouth to John’s navel, just above the button on his jeans, licking a teasing trail to his belly button. John sucked in a gulp of air as practiced fingers undid the button and slowly slid down his zip. With his jeans open, Sherlock was free to press his lips against the cotton pants that housed the growing erection presented to him.
“He is my best friend,” John said, his voice softer now. “He is incredible and infuriating and sometimes I think he has the attention span of a twelve year old and the limbs of an octopus, but that’s what makes him Sherlock, and I--I wouldn’t want him any other way.” His eyes met Sherlock’s and he reached into his pocket. He hadn’t kept it in a box (too obvious an outline), but he’d been sure to take it everywhere.
"Come now, John, you can't tell dear Mrs. Hudson not to do her job just because you can't come up with a creative password. What if I was an enemy?" Sherlock cocked his head and smiled almost alarmingly. "I'm truly doing you a favor by forcing you to be more careful."
John’s hands settled on the rounds of Sherlock’s arse, gently parting them, and one of his thumbs traced the wet rim, making Sherlock’s entire body flutter and shiver in anticipation. He couldn’t help thinking that if John hadn’t put the guard in already, he’d be running his tongue up and down and in and--
He was rewarded for his self control with a hot breath ghosting along the head of his cock. The resultant twitch found Sherlock's hips bearing down against the bed to keep from pushing up.
“John, I,” Sherlock stutters, “I--John, I’m so sor--”
“Lestrade,” Sherlock said, beginning to turn down the very blanket John was lazing on top of. When John didn’t move, Sherlock gave it another impatient tug. “The flat is no longer pink and has been cleared for human occupancy once more. I told you it was nothing to be concerned about. We’re invited to go home in the morning.”
John stayed still, not reaching for the offered wand box. "Thank you, Headmaster, but I already planned to go to Diagon Alley tomorrow and fetch one myself."
“Well, of course you weren’t
“We’ll trade them in for sleepless nights and dirty nappies. Worth it, surely,” John said quietly against the back of Sherlock’s neck. He gently ran his nose along the curve there, kissing softly just to one side of his lover’s throat.
, John wanted to ask, but he didn't.
Sherlock, ignoring John's sarcasm, seemed to consider it, but said, "Just this once, since it's already here."
Rose stepped back, just a moment short of standing in a stream that would've flooded her Mary Janes.
John swallowed, shaking his head once more as the other man put both hands back on his hips and began to turn them toward a secluded corner. He was nudged a few feet further down the hall until they were mostly hidden by the shadows.
His head was hazy with arousal and he was sure he was practically leaking through his jeans at this point, but he didn't understand the point of the corner until a pair of steady hands were pulling at his zip.
“Well, if you ask me, he’s lucky you’re letting him into that little girl’s life--and yours. You’ve always been so lonely, Sherlock, I worried--but he’s been good to you, I think?”
He was still dressed in his robes from the day before, so he supposed he was right in thinking he'd been out wandering about with Sherlock until Merlin knew when.
The strangest by far, though, was meeting the Weasley children, which brought him to his second point of anxiety: his first emergency as Hogwarts's Healer.
"Alright."
Sherlock scooped her up in one arm effortlessly, pressing his face into her curls. The suppressants he took to minimise his cycles dulled her natural scent just slightly, but it was still there. But Annabelle smelled like him, like Baker Street and tea, and a bit like the earth she’d been sitting on. Yet there was an underlying touch of the Alpha who fathered her--warm cedar and cinnamon. The notes he was catching in the air were stronger, more developed.
John Watson, who seemed to look at Sherlock and see a partner instead of a prize.
As soon as John's nose pressed into his pubic hair, Sherlock lost it. He moaned a belated warning and came down his lover's throat, hips spamming in his attempt not to thrust violently into that perfect mouth.
“I think it’s one of those parental worries. I know how our childhoods were with older siblings and I worry that Hamish will
There was nothing wrong with wanking to the thought of a friend, John reasoned as he slowly stroked himself. As long as he had no delusions about anything happening between them, it was harmless. He wouldn't be throwing himself at Sherlock anytime soon. He couldn't help it if his mind was wandering toward the infuriating professor.
While John was having a bit of a dizzy spell over his lack of preparedness for this news, Sherlock simply said “Identical twins. Fascinating.”
Still... something nagged at John. He couldn’t place it.
And Sherlock had immediately felt so dirty, so
One of the key factors in the experiment was the O-brand lubricant that had shipped with the device. It was a synthetic, water-based lubricant with a distinct omega scent. While Sherlock had never been lured by omega pheromones, he knew that it would work to distill the air and allow them to focus more closely on each other. It would also keep them from attempting a permanent bond. While that was something Sherlock hoped would happen in the long-term, it likely wasn’t a good idea to force themselves into it without knowing whether they would be able to be intimate safely.
It was strange to think that it had been almost three months since he’d last done much more than kiss Sherlock. They still went to bed together, fell asleep together, and often woke curled together, but--how had they not once tried to take their nightly kiss and turn it into something more?
Right now, it was just a crushing distraction to have Sherlock so close and in such peril.
What had John been asking him? He stroked the man distractedly for a long moment before remembering.
"Is that a unicorn-core sycamore tucked away in those robes, or are you just pleased to see me?" Jim spoke in a richer, slower cadence than when John had interacted with the man as Molly's supposed boyfriend. Now he just seems dark.
“No one,” Sherlock said, fidgeting. “I’ve not--I’ve never--I couldn’t--” There was a level of frustration that Sherlock Holmes rarely reached, the one where he could tangle himself in the inability to formulate his lightning-paced articulations. He was reaching that point and John, who had only seen it happen once before, didn’t know how to react.
John sat down at their table and unpacked the bag. "How much weight did he tell you you need to gain, then?" That was the only reason Sherlock would bother to do the shopping.
He closed his eyes, put three fingers in his mouth and the other hand in his pyjama bottoms.
His silk dressing gown was open and half of it was falling off of him, revealing a plain, light-colored t-shirt that had ridden up on his left hip and dark pajama bottoms that were, somehow, too long for Sherlock’s legs, overshadowing his feet by several inches.
, just give me a moment.”
It was the only time in his life Sherlock could recall wishing he’d previously taken a lover. And then he’d realize his thoughts, correcting himself with the reminder that when it did happen, he and John would only have belonged to each other. Yes, John had had romantic relationships and was quite far from pure, but he’d never made a true bond with anyone the way he would eventually with Sherlock. And he would--Sherlock was certain he’d find a way.
But there was no kiss. Sherlock sat back, straddling his husband, trailing his hands down a jumper-clad chest to stomach, where he slipped cool hands underneath to caress the warm skin he found there.
His brain was swimming in the imagined pheromones, conjuring a body pressed warmly against his own, ready to enter a days-long coupling, a lifelong partnership.
“Is this another one of those
"But, oops!" the other man cried with a sudden jerk forward. "You've rather shown your hand there, Healer Watson."
“Mycroft said you might need company during the holiday.” The lie didn’t sound even a little bit backed up, but Sherlock rolled his eyes and muttered something under his breath about his brother meddling unnecessarily. “I was also hoping you might tell me what happened in the Room of Requirement,” John added, taking his own slow step forward.
But John’s mouth surged upwards and the other man nearly knocked him off his feet. The only thing keeping Sherlock grounded was the hand that immediately cupped the back of his head and pulled him forward, lips crushing against his own.
When she turned the corner a few moments later, the little boy turned and caught Sherlock's eye. The consulting detective sat down on the steps to 221B and waited for his landlady to wake.
when John Watson smelled like that. They’d been having semi-regular intercourse for more than a month, and he knew the scent of the man in his arms the way he knew the whorls of his fingerprints. But it had never been so strong, so tempting.
The lack of control was exciting, a possibility Sherlock had never considered.
Without protest, John settled into the bed next to his flatemate.
, how--”
before embarking on their four-month shag fest. Nothing was going to change this, though. In seven months, there would be two little people who would need their love and attention.
Sherlock crouched down in front of his daughter, who immediately reached for the lapels of his coat and latched on.
He spent the rest of the day looking at every man who walked by him in the hospital, wondering if he'd be willing to fuck any of them, staring at everyone who was tall and thin, wondering if it was his SH.
“We’ve only just met and we’re gonna go and look at a flat?”
Warmth surged in Sherlock’s stomach and at the base of his spine as the knot inflated completely, filling him and satisfying in a way that nothing ever had before. He tried to gasp out a warning, but it ended up just being a shattered “
"Sherlock...!"
The door bursts open and instantly there is a bundle of reindeer-patterned limbs bouncing about on the bed. “He knew!” Hamish cries out, grabbing at the blankets, unwrapping his parents like gifts. “He brought it? Where is it?”
"What the hell--"
The file Sherlock received a few days later was detailed, but none of the information it contained gave Sherlock any sense of peace. There was no photo; Mycroft was still working on that. What Sherlock knew so far was that the man was 36, a former army doctor, and he’d been invalided home from the war after a gunshot wound to the shoulder nearly four years ago. He’d contributed sperm as part of the Population Regulation Program when he’d enlisted. It was a rather sick contract, in all actuality--the government could use his sample in the event of his untimely demise.
The fear Sherlock had--and this was a legitimate, encompassing fear made all the more troubling by James Moriarty's kidnapping of one John Watson--was of seeing the good doctor lying in a pool of his own blood in Afghanistan, begging for his own life while trying to dig a bullet from his own shoulder.
John's mind was a bit too cloudy to remember what the offer was.
"Ta," John replied, dipping the flannel in the dish again. The once clear water was stained with pink and the occasional spot of blue from the salve. "That's exactly what I was going for. It's the right side of 'Like I nearly died chasing a bloke who has been evading me for three weeks so I was in a mind to show him who's boss.'"
Sherlock swallowed hard. He wasn’t sure what he was meant to do. Should he wake her? Introduce her to her Alpha? How would he explain who the man was to a three-year-old?
At least, that was how nature and the rest of the outside world looked at it.
John obliged, imagining that he wasn't standing in a seedy porn shop fucking a stranger's palm but instead laid out on an elaborate bed of silken sheets, thrusting upwards into a gorgeous, pale, thin man whose name he knew.
It took a few tries before they managed to figure out a proper angle, and when John finally slid home, his thighs were straining. He knew just how much his body could handle. The heated stretch was uncomfortable, yes, but as he adjusted to the sensation, he knew it would get better. And then there was the sheer knowledge of it--of Sherlock inside him, moving with him, filling him--which seemed to be enough to bring his wilting erection back to life.
And maybe Lestrade was holding a gun to his entire team, but by God, they all clapped.
The students filed out past John and he entered the classroom while Sherlock cleared away the potion, disposing of it properly to keep any students from getting the wrong idea. It was smart. The last thing the school needed was a bunch of randy teenagers administering love potions to their fancy of the week.
"I suspect you won't have any trouble finding your chambers. You'll be down by the Hufflepuff common room, just a bit down the hall. Your fire place has a direct connection to the Infirmary. Should you require anything else, the house elves will be happy to oblige you." The Headmaster picked up a quill on his desk, making John sure that the conversation was over.
5. New duvet
He looked at booth 17, SH's usual booth, and noted that it was also occupied.
John's head fell forward against the back of Sherlock's and he groaned, pursing his lips on the tail of it, trying to reach skin in a desperate moment but failing. A tilt let him nibble at his lover's hairline, moaning softly into the short curls there as the faster pace resumed, taking them both closer and closer and then--
Sherlock had fired off a text to Mrs. Hudson to let her know he was delayed while simultaneously hailing a cab.
They sat in a resoundingly absolute silence and John let his tea sit on the coffee table next to Sherlock’s untouched cup and saucer. He didn’t know how long it was before Sherlock’s sharp intake of breath startled him, sounding entirely like the man was coming back to life with all the air the room had to offer.
be content with breathy sighs during and not so much as a kitten's mewl at climax?
Fantastic.
“Let me just get something to clean you up,” he says, ever the caretaker, clearing his throat once more, determined. I look over my shoulder and grin—he doesn’t take his eyes off of my arsehole until he has to physically turn to leave the room.
"And what does this wardrobe have to do with me?" John looked at the vast, large rooms and curving corridors of the manor and could easily imagine himself getting lost. It had taken him four months to remember where the Hufflepuff common room was when he was 11, he doubted his sense of direction had improved much.
Sherlock thought. This had to be John. He couldn't imagine anyone else's hands would be able to take him apart so thoroughly, even if he'd never imagined this in the first place.
The start of term actually went much more smoothly than John suspected it would. His nerves about seeing all the students, about his first emergency in the infirmary, about balancing his work and befriending the intolerable Sherlock Holmes--all were unfounded in actuality.
There was just one problem.
"You knew you were coming home to have sex with me and you're not even ready?" he complained. "You could have at least tried. It would have sped things up exponentially."
That had been nearly three weeks ago and Sherlock’s mind was still buzzing from the desire it had lit inside of him. Where once the two men had been comfortable around each other, now the sexual tension had driven an almost physical wedge between them. Sherlock knew when John fantasized about him (most mornings in the shower, sometimes in the evening after he’d gone to bed), but he didn’t know if those fantasies matched his own. His inability to read John’s fantasies on his features was driving Sherlock semi-mad with want.
“He wasn’t,” Sherlock responded, then cleared his throat. “I--there was something he needed to know before meeting her.”
To Hamish Holmes, there is no such thing as an eraser.
“If you’re sure. You’ll let me know if the situation changes?”
“No,” Sherlock said, shortly. “Now, I had planned to spend quite a bit of time on my own. I had explained this to my brother in great detail, so I apologize that he thought to send you here for your holiday. If I were you, I’d head back there on the first train.” Sherlock turned toward a door and John was sure the other man was going to close the door in his face, but Sherlock turned in the threshold in a slight cascade of blue silk. “I’ll ask that you please keep yourself to the West Wing. I have several delicate experiments running down here, some that would be volatile if interrupted by an unskilled observer.”
There were no signs in either direction. If John had a secret control kink, he hid it well.
Yes. That happened. But it may as well not have. They agreed to never tell January that the picture of her on the mantelpiece next to her sister was actually, well... Shiloh. Posed twice, differently.
"I'm very vocal during sex, John," he said. "I'll bet if I had you on your back while I rode this sweet, big cock, you'd have me screaming your name. You know how to use it, don't you, John?" The fist stopped moving on his cock and John groaned low in his throat at the tight grip that held him firm. A moment later, he was fished out of his pants and pulled out into the cool, open air of the hallway. The fist was firm.
“I’m sorry, sir, I don’t have a room available for you.”
“Let’s go to bed.”
He hadn’t even been asked to take the weekly growth photo since the first week.
“Problem?” the taller man asked.
With a sigh, John passed the plate back. One bite for Sherlock, one bite for Shiloh, and one bite for January.
A fist-sized hole that now had two long, pale, unmistakably
Brushing the damp hair away from his eyes, John asked, “And what sort of fee would one incur for such a rare exception?”
John's forehead was pressed against the wall and his hands were still clenching and unclenching on the smooth surface when he felt the condom being slipped off. The stranger took him in hand and John jumped a bit at the assault on his oversensitive flesh, but then he realized he was being cleaned off with a tissue.
"Have you got a quill?" Sherlock asked, fingers moving out in front of him as though he were ready to take up a quill and start writing. Both he and his brother seemed to be adept at wandless magic in a way that John had never had a talent for--a roll of parchment unfolded itself in front of the professor without so much as a flick of his wrist.
The sound was low when the porn picked up partway through a video of a very enthusiastic blonde head bobbing up and down on a thick, veiny member, shot in a lovely point-of-view range. He could hear the slick slide of her mouth on that cock, her moans of pleasure as if she could actually come from the sole pleasure of having a cock down her throat, but he could also hear the steps outside his booth, the occasional orgasmic cries of a man down the hall.
The soft teddy in his hands, Sherlock realized, had a yellow and black striped belly--like a bee--and a white bow on its head. Annabelle would love it. As he opened the door, he pressed it to his face, breathing in the scent of the Alpha, which he’d found could calm him down when he was agitated. It’d be good for Annabelle, once John came around, for the soft toy to have his scent. It would help her adjust to his presence in her life, and likely help with the abandonment she could potentially feel from his initial absence.
John wasn’t willing to take that risk. He’d told Sherlock rather explicitly of everything that could go wrong.
“I was thinking,” John said, and he punctuated the sentence by letting his tongue peek out between his lips. “I thought I might write up one or two of the cases you’ve told me about. Just--a quick thing, on my blog. Sort of a writing experiment.” He looked pleased with himself for using the word “experiment” in relation to Sherlock.
He stretched out for a moment before the night’s events came back to him. Their failed encounter hit him like a punch in the chest. Had Sherlock ever even come to bed or had he gone off to perform some kind of feral experiment in his agitated state? Bit not good. Their rent had doubled the last time they had a row. This was by no means a legitimate quarrel, but if Sherlock lost his temper, the walls might end up covered in jam-flavored brain matter.
God, how he wanted to see him, to know what he'd come so close to having. It was like a stalkerish obsession, the way he wanted to know how those slim hips curved so he could imagine what they would've felt like if he gripped them while fucking the man from behind.
"How's your chart coming?" John rested his towel over a chair and went to the fridge. He'd been successful in getting Sherlock to eat breakfast on three out of the last five days and was hoping he could get the detective to eat some eggs.
10. New mugs
"So what will it be, John?" Lips played along the side of his neck. "Would you like me to wank you in an alleyway and then you can go home, continuing to hear me when I'm so close to you at Bart's?"
Sherlock’s eyes met John’s and they held for a long moment. They were both focusing on the pulse between their fingers, and John could almost see that brilliant mind working behind clear eyes.
He didn't remember a thing.
They had to be realistic. Neither of them were in their prime anymore, and while it was still true that one time was all it could take for them to conceive, it was also possible that it could take months, and John wasn't sure Sherlock had the patience for that kind of commitment, or that they wouldn't get bored of the sex right out of the gate.
“It’ll be fun.” John reaches for the remote and flicks the telly back to life, settling onto the couch and letting his feet burrow further under Sherlock’s bottom. “And now,
But then there were hands on his left hip and right shoulder respectively, holding him firmly in place.
John didn’t doubt that.
John smiled fondly to himself, briefly wondering how he’d gotten lucky enough to be here, able to think about the fact that in a little while, he’d be engaging in post-coital
It had been nearly forty minutes. The peak was certainly within view; the point of no return where they stopped being Sherlock and John and simply became a jumble of pleasured cells merging together and whispers of carbon dioxide on skin.
Sherlock woke with a sore jaw and the taste of John on his tongue.
“Daddy, ma’nifyin’lens!”
He didn’t even bother to push down his pyjama bottoms, just unbuttoned the fly with one hand and fished himself out, giving a few slow strokes. John was treated to a lovely, full-body shiver when the head of his cock kissed Sherlock’s opening, pressing in slowly until he was fully sheathed, his stomach against Sherlock’s back.
John peeled himself away from his hands and dared to look down at the tattoo-like numbers ticking away on his wrist.
“It would be unprofessional of you to leave this bed and answer that when I’m paying you,” John mumbled against the side of Sherlock’s neck.
It wasn’t quite as instantaneous as it probably would’ve been if they’d been in some kind of romantic comedy, but it was a near thing. John’s hand moved on Sherlock’s cock with the confidence of a practiced lover--though it was ultimately the knot expanding completely that drove Sherlock over the edge, filling him and providing perfect pressure in all the places he needed it most.
“Harder, John,” I gasp, desperately pushing my hips back to meet him where he’s slowly starting to lose his pace. I simultaneously want him to come in his funeral suit and drag this out for hours.
"I'm so sorry, John." Sherlock reached out and touched John's lips with a gentle finger, just a ghost of a touch. And then he gave his wand a small twist and whispered a spell John had never knowingly had cast on him.
“Your growth is equivalent to that of a carrying parent who is about twelve to thirteen weeks along, but the persistence of your morning sickness and other early symptoms suggested that you weren’t quite so far into the pregnancy,” the woman said. “Dr. McDonnel suspected that a multiple birth may be a possibility, but didn’t want to worry you in case it was something more serious. And here we are--” She pointed to the screen, at one of the small figures. “Baby A.” A French-tipped nail directed their sight toward the second. “And Baby B. I’d say you’re likely about nine weeks along, judging by their sizes. Baby B looks to be just slightly larger, but that tends to happen.”
“So good,” John said quietly, carefully guiding Sherlock back down. He knew, of course, that Sherlock didn’t need the affirmation.
"Freshly brewed tea," Sherlock said slowly. "Old library books." Sherlock looked at the door murderously. John just felt more confusion. Eyes met his for the briefest lock before Sherlock finished his nonsensical list with: "Wooly jumpers."
Because Annabelle’s father was supposed to be dead.
For now, Sherlock’s arm around him was firm and all the comfort either of them needed was contained in a single room, a bubble inside 221B Baker Street, as the blemishes of London were overlain with a white blanket.
He wanted to tell himself it was friendly concern, but there was something else pulling at his stomach, telling him that he wouldn't care this much about anyone else in his acquaintance. It had been coming on for a while, and he supposed he had known it without admitting it to himself, but it didn't make it any better.
Sherlock nodded as he twisted the cap off the toothpaste.
“Oh, fuck me,” he says, and then he licks his lips and peers at me through half-shut eyes. His pupils have almost overtaken the irises, and I fold myself down to kiss him again, pressing our open mouths together, barely coordinated and loudly breathy. The folds of his trousers where the fabric has bunched up around his cock rubs against my arse, reminding me of his state of dress (as if I could ever forget).
he chastised himself as he tried to lift Sherlock from the floor. He was strong, but there was very little friction to help him and the consulting detective was practically dead weight. While it could’ve been worse (Sherlock could’ve been forcibly resisting), John tried to use his increased deductive reasoning to make an educated diagnosis.
John had never understood why it was so hard for Sherlock to carry his phone from room to room with him. His trousers had pockets, his suit jacket always had an interior pocket. Why was it so difficult to keep track of the damned 4-by-2 inch rectangle?
But no, John would have heard that.
“One day,” John said, stopping only two words in to nip at Sherlock’s ear, “One day I’m going to fuck you.” He punctuated the promise by grinding down slowly before resuming his pace. “I’m going to take you in this very bed and--” For a moment, his lips hovered just over where the bond scar would someday present itself. “Oh, God, I’m going to have you, Sherlock. Every inch of you.”
Rather than rubbing the water away from Sherlock, John began to cocoon the other man in all the towels and blankets he had on hand. By the time Sherlock began to look like himself again--still pale, but less of the pallor kind and more of the “my skin rarely sees the light of day” kind--John was about ready to fret himself into a state.
at my flat, only to arrive here and be told that there’s no room for me. When I asked for a reason, I couldn’t be given one other than a very
John closed his eyes. If he couldn't see, maybe he could focus himself to hear what was going on inside the bubble.
Sherlock wondered.
. Reaches out. Face cupped in palm. More warm sparks under his fingers. His knees are threatening to crumble under him as those eyes--ethereal, like an angel--bore into him. Searching. Permission? For what.
who had the gall to invite an
He rubbed at his shoulder for a moment and put out the fire with a wave of his wand.
“Patience, love,” John said, pushing the fabric of Sherlock’s aubergine shirt aside. His hands skittered down the over sensitized skin on his ribs, stopping at the curve of his hips. “I promise it’ll be so much better if we can just wait a few more minutes for your heat to come on completely. I can smell it--it’s almost here. I promise.”
John Watson had never so much as given a bloke a second glance. He barely tolerated porn that featured too much of the male partner. Sure, he’d spent time in the army, but he hadn’t even resorted to friendly shags the way some of the other soldiers did.
If Sherlock was happy to see him, he didn't show it, though that could've been the woman's presence.
But for a man to be on the other end of John’s numbers?
Now, John was feeling the other man's responsiveness to his ministrations a little bit at a time, in the form of fingers gripping his hair, sliding down his neck to his shoulders, pulling him closer, holding his head in place in open invitation.
Unfortunately, he wasn’t yet willing to take the risk of introducing him to Annabelle. And it was a given that the longer he waited, the more delicate the situation would become. Even if Sherlock could pretend he hadn’t known just whose semen had been used in his fertilization, he’d now spent a not-insignificant amount of time with his mouth on John’s skin, with his nose pressed into the man’s hair, wrapped in his amorous embrace. The scent was clear--even if he hadn’t noticed it the first time, there was no way he could pretend that their mingled pheromones didn’t remind him of the daughter he left behind for his tryst.
“Shall we begin?”
I throw my head back as his cuff link accidentally grazes the tip of my prick, and when he gets his fingers around me, it takes almost nothing before I’m shaking apart beneath him.
He turned his head slightly and looked up at Sherlock’s angular face, pale eyelids closed, lips relaxed and slightly parted, and remembered kissing sleepily on a slow Sunday morning four months ago. It had seemed like a counterattack to the inevitable awkward conversations that would arise from their impromptu intimacies the night before, but it had instead become routine.
How was John still seemingly in his rightful mind?
glance at my husband. And I find it absolutely ridiculous that--”
It was a ridiculous sight, and both of them knew it. Sherlock, kneeling on the bed with his cock hanging from trousers that were barely shoved down his thighs while John knelt opposite, palming himself with the heel of his hand as he breathed the mixed scents in the air.
I have no excuse for the amount of time this took me.
was the instinctual question, but it was useless at this point. And
"An engorgement charm--but I think he may have--" Her voice broke off with a small cry and she covered her mouth with her hand.
Sherlock had lied, of course. He'd worked out the final variable while John had made his way up the stairs.
He bit down on the balled-up jumper as he came, panting through teeth and wool to taste John’s unique scent as he gripped the base of his cock to please the engorged knot. Moments passed, but he didn’t release his hold, instead choosing to let his breathing regulate, only gasping with the occasional surge of pleasure from his knotted fist.
I have to lower my gaze and adjust the angle in order to accommodate the length of him, but when he starts to slowly thrust into my mouth, my mind goes blissfully silent except for the intake of physical sensation. I groan around the slick slide of him, taking care to breathe when he retreats and to give a concurrent sweep of my tongue. When he pulls nearly all the way out, leaving only the tip inside, I revel in the fact that there’s a wet spot near his flies where my mouth has been making contact on every small thrust. I’m slowly but surely defiling his lovely suit whether he realizes it or not.
“When I was 28 years old, the Mandate required that I have a child--”
Mrs. Hudson had had this dream before.
The hand that wasn’t stroking Sherlock off reached to tangle their fingers together.
There wasn't much of a question there; no hint that Sherlock was looking for his partner to agree or disagree.
“Might be worth it to open that at the start next time." John was panting slightly. He had a purpling bite mark on his right shoulder that mirrored the placement of the scar on his left. His lips were swollen and wet, cheeks and chest flushed, but Sherlock noted that he was visibly calmer. It was almost disconcerting to have the presence of an omega suddenly interloping on their mating, but John was right. For now.
, there he was again, pushing back until his arse was against the wall and John was buried deep.
Not that he'd thought about it, but there really wouldn't be a more blindingly obvious opportunity.
John raised his eyebrows and looked at Headmaster Holmes, about to question if he had already announced his intention to hire the healer, but the Potions master interrupted him.
"I believe we may have been incorrect about our estimations." The middle-aged man motioned for his patient to lay on the exam table, and Sherlock stripped off his coat and suit jacket before doing so. "If you could just unbutton your shirt for me, Mr. Holmes. The bottom few will do fine."
Sherlock froze then, staring at John with eyes just a bit too wide. “Nothing of importance. I’ve already explained this to both my insufferable brother and his friends at the Ministry.” He was defensive about it; that was John’s first red flag. Sherlock rarely got emotional about things quite so tedious.
Someone called to Angelo from the kitchen before John could protest against the knowing twinkle in the keeper's eye.
A long, black quill transformed between his fingers and he held it out. Pale fingers brushed his own as they took the ebony feather. John whetted his lips and held his breath when the Potions master stepped away, running the end of the feather along his knuckles as he turned back to his desk.
“Hey.” He grabbed Sherlock’s arm as the taller man made to walk around him. “Is everything okay?”
1. Shiloh -
“No, she’ll love it. She’ll... adore you.” Sherlock took a deep breath. He’d vacillated between being blunt and to the point, but John would likely dub that a bit not good. So instead, he started with a disclaimer: “What I’m going to tell you may very well make you walk away and never return, but I ask that you keep in mind that I did what I did out of a sense of protectiveness for both you, and for my daughter.”
"You're late," said a deep voice in his left ear.
Sherlock’s mind was starting to swim in a chemical bath of heat and hormones and the smell of John, but he couldn’t help thinking that even outside of this moment and this room, he might just love John Watson.
A pair of hands--sturdy hands, careful hands, surgeon's hands--slipping from his shoulders to his elbows, from his elbows to his wrists and just
John swallowed, shrugged in something like defeat. “Sure that she’s... mine. If this kind of mix up happened with my sample, it might not’ve been the first time--she could be anyone’s. Are you absolutely certain that she’s--”
He wanted to ask when--
So caught up in the terror he’d face sixteen years down the road, he paid no mind to the fact that Sherlock had chosen the name “January” based on the fact that he could call her
"I picked the right potion." Sherlock shrugged.
“Do you want to put bottoms on?” John whispered. “You don’t like sleeping in the--” The voice of reason, John was. Always. Sherlock hated the texture of the duvet on his calves. No other part of his body, just his calves, so he always had to wear bottoms. Now was probably the most ridiculous time to be paying any attention to the textural needs of the backs of Sherlock’s legs, but John wanted to take care of him. All of him, calves and shins and kneecaps included.
But also how
“Approximately four weeks, yes.”
John's fingers gingerly released him from the leather cuffs.
Like Annabelle. Alphaless Anabelle.
"Oh," came a soft cry from the other side of the wall. It was deep and surprised and followed by several quick grunts, all of which John could feel in the spasms around him as the other man stroked himself to climax, setting off a chain reaction with his arse that took John right to the peak of pleasure.
John was smiling openly now. “Sherlock, it’s all fine. I should’ve asked.” He moved forward, climbing a bit to settle himself straddling Sherlock’s hips. “We don’t have to talk about it right now.” His shirt joined his jumper on the floor, and Sherlock’s eyes were immediately drawn to the scar on his left shoulder, the one that was the reason for everything. The reason he was invalided home, which meant it was part of the reason Sherlock was currently in his bed. It was the injury that had briefly killed him, a nasty surgery followed by infection and incorrect reporting of facts; the reason for Annabelle.
Sherlock moaned, swallowing down what was given to him before opening his mouth again and arching forward. John gave him what he wanted, pushing his over-sensitive cock back into that mouth, letting Sherlock suck him dry with lips that knew just how to work him.
But then he held his breath, because the flickering glow of his porn hadn't let him see what was now glaringly obvious.
Part of him was reviewing everything he knew about poisons: would any of them smell damp, like a bit of mould? But there was an undercurrent of... buttered toast?... in the mix, along with an unrecognizable spice like something from the Muggle takeaway curry his parents had always favored.
decorations."
"Do you need me to help you with getting to bed?" John asked, though he wasn't sure what help he could be. He didn't think the other man would be keen on being helped out of his robes and into the sheets.
“Any reason why?” John asked, finding the camera application on the phone. When he had it open, he aimed and pressed the button on the bottom of the screen. The flash went off and the photo saved itself to the phone.
Sherlock's smile faded quickly, a small shadow passing over his features. "We've gone over this before, John. I've not done any mind reading here."
,” John replied. They’d stashed the lube and a condom under one of Sherlock’s pillows so it wouldn’t be thrown off the bed or kicked away with the sheets. He retrieved them now, pressing another open-mouthed kiss to Sherlock’s jaw as he leaned forward. “It’ll feel amazing, I promise.”
Sherlock nodded, then reached for the teddy. The least he could do was take it inside so John wouldn’t be wandering the streets with a pastel bright bear the size of a small dog. “I’m sure you don’t want to wander through Regent’s Park with that all afternoon, so why don’t I take it inside? I’ll give it to Mrs. Hudson to hold until you come back.”
"Is that such a good idea?" John had countered. "To taunt someone who has killed four people by basically becoming the mouse and saying 'Here, kitty kitty'?"
He tried to fight back.
A common thread. A stranger people allowed into their houses. The faked ailment.
"He'll be all right in a few hours," John said.
“I think it mostly depends on the childhood relationship, parents picking favorites, all that.” He sets himself up on his elbow, mirroring Sherlock. “What’s brought this on, then? Psychoanalyzing so that you can
“If he comes back.”
. But even when the hormones had induced a certain level of randiness, he’d wanted nothing to do with himself. Of course, he’d been single at the time, so there was no one to be sexy
Neither of them expect him to tuck his letter away and bound up the stairs to his bedroom declaring it a secret between himself and Father Christmas.
“I will come back, Sherlock. I need some time to process this. You’ve had... a lot more time than me to wrap your head around this.” He was clenching his fist at his side, but Sherlock wasn’t sure if it was on purpose, or if it was the intermittent tremor making itself known.
John closed his laptop and fetched Sherlock’s phone from the mantelpiece, where it had somehow become lodged between the Cluedo board and the wall.
On the next slide in, I hold him close, fingers digging into his arse through his trousers, and groan deeply at the feeling of his cock in my throat and his silk tie on my forehead. I can just barely feel the hint of his metal zipper.
John smiled at his daughter’s name. “I’d love to.”
John nearly choked on his chicken. "Pardon?"
Maybe Sherlock’s hormones had addled him a bit, making him more prone to caring about what people said about him where he’d previously paid no mind. He’d been avoiding taking on cases, and John suspected that it had something to do with public reactions to his newly acquired girth. But the Yard had been stumped and Lestrade had all but gotten down on his knees and begged Sherlock to come to the scene.
“Mrs. Hudson let me up,” John said, his voice low. He hadn’t taken his eyes off of Annabelle.
Warmth through a thin layer of cotton.
Curious.
His name echoed off the walls, solitary in the late hour. The last time someone had said his name in that tone, he'd been sneaking out with Sarah Sawyer in his seventh year.
"Sherlock?" Molly asked, ever eager to bring up her favorite subject. Jim must not have been too serious a boyfriend, then.
Sherlock frowned and buttoned up his coat quickly despite the heat in the room and motioned his head for John to follow. He didn't explain his findings, he didn't chide the detectives on their inability to see what was right in front of them.
This felt... simple.
Then again, that's exactly what both of them had done when they'd come to Hogsmeade.
“No, John, listen to me.” Sherlock stood then, holding it out to the doctor and stepping toward him with calculated steps, keeping himself from pouncing as he wished. “It’s large enough internally that it will fit two fully erect alphas, including the knot at orgasm. Its inner workings are textured to mimic an omega’s channel. I’ve had it engineered specifically for the two of us--and I think you understand exactly why I’d like to try it as soon as possible.”
John squeezed his eyes shut tight, because no matter what universe they were in, that was pretty much always true. His fingers curled in Sherlock’s hair, still just a light grip. He was almost fully erect now and there was little in the world that he wanted more than the feeling of Sherlock’s lips against his naked flesh.
“Obvious, John. One for each of us.”
“I’ll get the phone,” Sherlock said, “and then come back.”
John furrowed his brow, wondering how it could be relevant enough to end their snogging. His mind flitted back to their kiss, momentarily reveling in it until Sherlock shook him again.
Doesn’t expect to feel warm lips against his own, just as desperate. No dream prepared him for this. Heat. More warmth. Need. Flesh and bone and breath, all here. Present. Not in the past, not in a dream.
And that was when John dared to look down and meet the clear eyes that were gazing up at him, holding contact as Sherlock slid his mouth all the way up, letting the head rest on his tongue for a moment before taking him right back down.
John nodded slowly. He tried not to think about the fact that they were in a hallway, however dimly lit, and his brain was still telling him to bend the man over and claim him.
John smiled. "Come along, then," he said. "We're going back to the Three Broomsticks and you're having a proper meal, uninterrupted by murderous Healers."
John cuts him off by nibbling on his bottom lip, sucking a moan from that heart-shaped mouth. “No deductions in bed,” John warns. Sherlock quirks an eyebrow--a challenge John isn’t sure about--and when the doctor squints back, Sherlock’s body grips him tight. “Oh,
The words bounced around in his mind, echoing in a deep cadence. Could he let Sherlock go off on his own in search of someone who had already killed three people?
And then there was a blindingly gorgeous burst of pleasure from the left side of his neck, just a few inches below his ear, spreading quickly to the rest of his body. Before he even had time to cry out, the knot at the base of his cock was swelling in tandem with his new mate’s. It was nearly impossible to continue moving as their bodies worked together to coat the inner walls of the cylinder between them with their seed.
He positioned half a dozen more thrusts upwards into his lover's warmth before heated pulses splashed across his stomach, before that body began to close in on him, dragging him deeper and trying to milk him.
Various plates, mail, and other (non-toxic) detritus are in my immediate line of view as I set one elbow down to steady myself. John’s delighted little moan from behind me tells me that he’s not thinking about the mess (for a change), so I ignore the fact that he asked me a dozen times to pay the heating bill, and instead I flip the cap from the bottle and turn it, liberally coating my right hand in the slick.
The previously empty space on the monitor came to life and John watched, praying for something--a little bean-shaped person who might take a minute to locate, but as long as the baby was there, they’d be okay.
John cried his friend’s name and slid the glass door to the side, momentarily getting rained on by an icy spray before he managed to turn it off. The space wasn’t made to hold two people who weren’t paying close attention to the way their bodies were angled and John was sure he’d have a bruise on his left hip in the morning, but his first priority was to get the trembling detective to warmth.
“I’m aware.” Sherlock was sorting his sleeves, still standing shirtless. “I’m beginning to notice stretching on the underside. Will those marks be permanent?”
Sherlock was sitting on the edge, untying his shoes silently.
Muffled words started to spill from John’s mouth, impeded by the guard and the fact that he was pressing his face into the space between Sherlock’s shoulders. Arching back and raising his head, Sherlock pressed farther, giving John direct access to his neck that he couldn’t reach a moment ago.
“Are you implying that my olfactory receptors are anything less than impeccable? I know what I--”
I probably could—all the Watsons have the same nose.
He looked pleased with himself, but of course John had his reservations.
“You haven’t even met him. How do you know?”
John had his hand wrapped around something, and he leaned forward to take Sherlock’s mouth once more, his tongue probing deep and dirty. Sherlock was momentarily surprised to taste himself, until he remembered that John had been rather enthusiastic in his worship of Sherlock’s fingers only a few moments ago.
with their reservation.” After a moment of stunned silence, the young man practically dove back to the computer to finalize details. “And Mr. Watson, please forgive us for the inconvenience--”
All leading up to this.
John’s eyes somehow stayed open through the crashing climax, and Sherlock wondered if they were both documenting it for the future. Something to look back on when the nights grew cold and lonely. Or was he simply living in the moment, unabashedly admiring the way his Omega looked in the throes of passion the same way Sherlock was storing the moment away in his mind palace.
John reached out a hand. "John Watson, head of the infirmary and Hufflepuff House."
," the other man said coolly.
“John, I need you to--” Another breath. He seemed to be fighting with himself. John appreciated the effort, but he didn’t understand how this reaction was so warranted quite so soon. “God, John, I’m sorry.” Sherlock’s hands slipped from their vise grip on his hips to clench in the sheets and John expected to feel the tell-tale pulsing inside, but there was nothing, just Sherlock, laying with his eyes squeezed shut, fingers flexing almost confusedly in the bedclothes.
