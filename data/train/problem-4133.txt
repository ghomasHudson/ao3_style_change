“That is not what they said,” Cas frowns. “Dean, your owning who you are allows me to be who I am without labeling it. You are, so I am. Those girls would not know to thank me without you. It is why we work. We are real.”
“Yeah, it’s tradition.”
Cas follows him over to Bobby in order to stand across from Dean, and Dean raises an eyebrow, tapping Cas’ stick with his own. “You sure you can take a face off, Cas? Because we can call Jess over if you’re not sure and she can try it out.”
Dean’s knee jerk reaction is panic, because what the
The anxiousness pisses him off, only adding to the pounding in his brain. What does he care that Cas hasn’t spoken to him in a week but called Sam? It’s not like Cas has never called Sam over him before.
Dean and Sam find Lily Sunder, Cas travels to Heaven. It takes some convincing to get Lily to help them, and hell knows what Cas has to promise Naomi, but they make it happen in the end. They always do. Jack is back, and as long as the kid doesn’t use his powers, he’ll have his soul. He’ll be alive.
Luckily none of their fans had figured it out yet. Dean wouldn’t exactly put the Roadhouse on the same level as a shitty roadside bar, but it was a little rundown, in a sketchier part of the city, and catered to the type of men who could give a fuck if some of the biggest athletes in the city were getting drunk and shooting pool around them. Not exactly the type of place you’d find someone begging for an autograph and a picture.
“Dude, I want to have dinner with Mama Tran,” Ash says, looking put out.
Working with the British Men of Letters is not something Dean enjoys. In fact, he hates it. But he does it for Sam, because Sam so desperately wants a relationship with Mary. Dean gave up on having his mother back a long time ago, but he tells her he forgives her. For Sam.
They set the cup down on the little table provided and Dean goes to stand by the mic, Cas beside him. All the reporters in here are in suits, and Dean recognizes a lot of them. His team is in the back, along with Bobby.
“I think that defeats the purpose, Dean.”
Cas looks down and frowns deeply. “I’m sorry, Dean, I didn’t realize—”
, and Dean doesn’t remember what the fuck he thought was so important to interrupt with when Cas’ thick, calloused fingers are wrapped around his dick.
Jacob narrows his eyes suspiciously. “I don’t know a boy who likes another boy.”
Basically, he and Cas are America’s new sweethearts. Not something Dean really appreciates when he’s trying to get a brand new relationship off the ground. Especially since Dean’s never been good with relationships to begin with, and to top that off, he’s pretty new to the whole guy with guy thing they’re trying out.
“No,” Bobby says gruffly. “Never even been here before. Arrived last night. I expect all you idiots to play nice and make him feel welcome, or there’ll be hell to pay, you hear me?”
Dean stares at him wordlessly for a minute. “You saying you worried about pulling something?”
“Now watch this play right here at the net. For all you young hockey players out there, pay attention, because—,”
Castiel finally pulls himself away from Dean and turns to look at him. “What are we doing?” he frowns. “I have two hours left in my shift.”
“I know I’m taking him,” the Empty snaps, sudden and cold fury rushing through the room. “Do you know what it’s like to be awake, waiting, waiting, waiting, for some miserable excuse for an angel to be happy? You’re what he wanted,” it points at Dean, “I
“Wait,” Dean says, unwilling to let this go because he’s finally getting somewhere with something. “So say you wanted to do sex stuff with a guy, just get it out of your system or...you know. That’s fine? It’s not gay.”
“Just watch out for him, Dean,” Victor tells him. “You know we’re all looking out for you.”
Dean’s hand is still gripped in Cas’ hair but it’s more a lifeline than anything else, a way to keep hold of him while Cas methodically works his way down Dean’s dick and begins deepthroating, his pace picking up speed to match the rhythm of Dean’s shallow breathing. Dean thinks he’s gonna get there just like this, holding onto Cas for dear life with no plans of ever letting go, but then Cas’ other hand finally releases his hip and Dean feels a dry finger circle his asshole, and it’s over folks, that’s all she wrote.
“Come on,” Dean mutters, heading towards the door. The crowd of people blocking it part like the Red Sea, and Dean can’t tell if it’s because of him or Cas, because he keeps his head down. They make it outside just as it begins to rain.
Dean pushes a heavy looking door marked with a ‘maintenance’ sign open, dropping Castiel’s hand to usher him inside. “Alright, so, most of the year my job is kind of lame, you know? Going around the city fixing random shit that breaks down in office buildings and occasionally building some random shit the bigwigs decide they need for something but can’t figure out how to make happen.” He flips the light switch and rows and rows of unremarkable looking metal shelves are revealed. “Not that important, if we’re speaking honestly.”
The first period ends scoreless, and Bobby spends the intermission going over plays with them, from that playbook they all hate so damn much but which is probably going to save their asses now. Rufus cuts in occasionally to help, and that’s when it really sinks in for Dean how important this game is. The Scorpions are the toughest team they’re going to play. If they beat them, they have a very good chance of beating Tampa. They could be champions, part of history.
Dean knows it’s all a learning curve. He was only dead for four months in earth time, and it still took so much adjusting when he got back, punching his way through a lack of acceptance over the way Sam’s life had gone on without him. Mary had been dead for more than 30 years. He knows this can’t be easy for her.
Dean’s sure he’s done much worse.
“Gabriel,” Dean growls threateningly. He’s got no patience for this, not with the dried come stiffening his boxers.
Benny gives him a look Dean can recognize even from behind his sunglasses. Goddamn bastard didn’t want to leave him alone. Kevin, obviously and cheerfully, says, “I thought it’d be cool to hang with you guys.”
“Is that a school bus?” Sam asks, and for the second time in the morning Dean almost jumps. He’d picked Sam up, and Sam, the bastard, had promptly fallen asleep, so Dean had forgotten he was even here.
“S’fine.” Dean rubs his arm and turns away from him again. He figures that’s probably ended the conversation, and he’s right. Castiel doesn’t speak up again, so Dean is left to continue his silent freak out as they get closer and closer to boarding one of the middle cars on the coaster.
It’d been tracking them for a mile or so now, had caught on to their scent as they took down a couple of vampires just past a stream that trickled into an open clearing. Roman had crowed with pleasure when it’d sent word of what it had found, had ordered it to capture the angel.
“Hey,” he says suddenly. “What were you like as a kid? I can’t imagine it.”
Cas takes a step back, his eyes flashing. “I’m going to go walk the dog,” he says stiffly, leaving the room.
“Huh,” Jo huffs. “You think maybe you’re just projecting your hurt feelings over Victor leaving?”
“At the very least I found that Marlowe had some humanity,” Cas is saying, and Dean grunts in acknowledgement. Marlowe was the philosophical one, he remembers, and he smiles slightly that he probably could have guessed Cas would be drawn to him.
“I’m not mad at Cas,” Dean says sharply. “I was just in a bad mood earlier.”
“Where are Sam and Jack?”
“S’ticklish,” Dean says, trying to buck him off (which just presents a whole new set of problems). “Don’t do it.”
“You’re just a basket full o’ sunshine tonight, aren’t ya?” Benny snorts, tossing a small KitKat at him. “What’s been going on with you, brother?”
Dean pauses in the act of pulling off his hockey pants. “Honestly Cas?” he says. “I don’t know. I’m still not sure I’m comfortable with guys knowing we…” he gestures between them. “Hockey players already use that kind of shit as an insult on straight people. Imagine when they know you’re gay. They’ll fuck it up, make it dirty. I don’t know if I could handle it.”
“I don’t expect anything less.”
“Please Dean. It’s not that hard to read up on hockey or watch a couple of games to figure it out. No offense, but you guys aren’t exactly playing D&D out there.” She sighs. “It is, however, harder for me to understand the strides hockey has been making towards LGBTQ acceptance from a league perspective without someone in the league.”
“Great,” he mutters. “Benny?”
Dean thinks he
After that, Cas goes to town. His hand jerks swiftly over their cock as he thrusts down, Dean coming up to meet him. The car is rocking beneath them and Dean is sure they’re killing the suspension, but it doesn’t really matter with Cas’ bright blue eyes looking down at him and his hair falling in his face. The pleasure is building rapidly again, heat pooling low in his stomach, and he’s left with nothing else to do but kiss Cas fiercely as he finally comes.
He sees how quietly terrified Cas is when it turns out Naomi isn’t dead. How he begins flinching at small, sudden sounds, how he sometimes stares at Dean, not in the usual way, but like he’s not quite sure he’s actually there. Dean has always been the tactile initiator between the two of them, and even that has been dampened by the voice in his head that warns
Icy cold doubt slides up Dean’s spine and wraps around his chest. “He doesn’t know, does he?” he asks Cas helplessly. Cas frowns and gives Dean’s hand a reassuring squeeze. It’s not really an answer.
The phone in his hand buzzes violently and he almost throws it at the wall, it startles him so much. At least he avoided that particular embarrassment. Raising the thing to his ear, he answers gruffly. “Yeah?”
“What do you mean, the culture?” Charlie pushes. “Do you experience hockey differently?”
Castiel is not used to Dean being unsure of himself, and it is this, and this alone, that has him considering apologizing, before his considerations are interrupted.
“What’s it doing?” another of them asks.
Cas turns away from the window to stare at Dean again. His eyes are a little wider than usual, and Dean wonders if he’s…holy shit, he’s freaked out. Dean’s not totally sure what to do, so he just stares back. He’s never seen Cas freaked out by anything, even when the two hundred a fifty pound winger from Ohio had threatened to sit on him last week.
“Go get ‘im,’ Dean tells him. “Rest of you, on the ice, c’mon.”
“Well,” Dean shoots him a sardonic grin. “I’m sittin’ on a couch, and the mental straining was never a factor to begin with."
Cas kisses him. His mouth is soft and warm and Dean feels everything melt away the second their lips touch, his shoulders loosening and the sick feeling in his stomach being overwhelmed by the heat building there instead.
If he could ignore the interested twitch of his dick before, he definitely can’t after that thought. For a brief second he forgets that they’re in a closet, with his brother right outside. Forgets about the stupid prank and that he doesn’t really want this. Instead he curses the fucking books still clutched in Cas’ hand between them, preventing them from making full contact.
Dean stares straight ahead at the stretch of highway and doesn’t ask another question.
He can do this.
“What?” Dean swallows, “I don’t – it’s to get back at you for all the staring, asshole. I can’t help it if you think I’m gorgeous.”
“She called me Peeping Tom,” Cas continues, his tone of voice going suspicious. “I was not aware stealing unsolicited looks at naked women was a common characteristic in Toms.”
“Wait, wait, wait, hold up,” Dean holds his hand up, his mind having already screeched to a halt. “Cas called? When did Cas call?”
Dean’s not really sure how to explain it. Cas is regarding him curiously too, but he’s kind of at loss for words. He could try telling them what he had been repeating to himself the past few weeks – hockey players just aren’t gay. Hockey players were real men, real men had sex with women. Sex with another man was emasculating, weak, your opponents could sense it on the ice and suddenly when they called you a faggot, the worst insult you could throw at a guy, it would be true and they would
Sam’s lecture face is beginning to form, and Dean
Bobby rolls his eyes. “Go see Frank, you damn idjit. I ain’t having you brain dead at forty.” Dean scowls and gets off the bench, but Bobby stops him with a hand on his shoulder. “You get bit?” he asks, staring at his neck.
you fight?” Dean counters, rubbing angrily at the stinging knuckles of his right hand. The dried blood washes away easily in the rain and he glares sideways at Cas. “Half of that was directed at you, you know.”
“I understand,” Cas’ lips thin. “I respect your decision. I just had a question.”
Actually, Dean wouldn’t be surprised if that higher power happened to be John Winchester, who would have probably administered some form of alcohol, women, guns and a beating if he’d ever heard Dean voice the thoughts running through his head right now.
Dean nods hesitantly, because yeah actually, the Cavalry have more Americans on the team than any other in the league, but why should that matter? “So?”
“Ah, so you would suggest that I look into the mystery genre?”
After a brief moment of consideration, Cas stands up too.
He needs something to distract himself, anything, and, noticing that Sam left his fucking dish on the table again, he grabs it, walking it over to the sink with his unopened beer and picking up a sponge.
Dean’s mouth snaps shut and Tracy’s eyes widen. They both stare at Cas, while Dean can feel Sam burning a hole into the side of his head with his eyes.
Cas’ eyes are boring right into him, shadowed under his hat as they are, and Dean wonders what his hair would be like if he took it off. If it would be back to the ruffled, messed up look that Cas used to constantly sport when he could still fly. He’s almost curious enough to see, except he really doesn’t want the hat to come off, because Cas currently looks like every fantasy he’d never allowed himself to have. He’s so distracted he almost doesn’t register what Cas said, and he definitely didn’t notice him stepping closer.
“Yeah,” Sam sighs heavily, like Dean is the biggest burden in the world. Dean resists the urge to try and trip him.
“Who says I did?” Castiel asks stiffly, stuffing his hand into his glove with more force than is strictly needed.
“I was unsure if your invitation last week was sincere. I don’t want to intrude.”
“Hey!” he says, hitting Cas, “Didja see that, Cas? That was awesome, man. So fucking awesome. How’d you do that? It was like,” he mimes holding a stick and moving it quickly back and forth, “And then gooooooal!”
“Well yeah, of course I do,” Dean laughs. “Charlie, my dad and a bunch of his hockey buddies bought me sex from a stripper on my sixteenth birthday. I grew up with a bunch of guys who fought to solve their problems, and if you didn’t wanna fight, you were a skirt wearing cocksucker. It’s just a mentality that sticks around. Jo and the other girls don’t have any of that.”
“Thanks Tracey. We all know a position was left open on the Cavalry when Henrickson was traded in June for two draft picks, a position that has the possibility of being filled by Krushnic. Krushnic went forty two, twenty six, thirteen with his Russian team last year, earning a total of thirty four goals and forty assists. But while it seems he matches Henrickson in skill, there’s still the question of chemistry. Cavalry Captain Dean Winchester, who was in the running for the Selke Trophy last year, spent a large amount of his ice time with Henrickson – will the chemistry be the same? That remains to be seen. The season starts October 9, check your local listings.”
He feels kind of weird prying the old ones out and installing the new ones with both Cas and the taxi driver watching, kind of like he’s on exhibition or something, and that leads to the thought that if the taxi driver weren’t here he might be sticking his ass out a little more, putting on more of a show.
Dean just smiles at him. “Only on certain special, magical days, if the kids believe in me enough.”
“Fight me, you stupid son of a bitch.”
Someone must have grabbed Krushnic and brought him down too, but he’d opted out of the game. He’s sitting on a railing along the wall, headphones in his ear as he watches them play intently. Dean can’t tell if he’s one of those boring players that needs to imagine the game before he can play, or if he’s actually interested in two touch and just doesn’t know how the game works yet.
“A shame too, the zoo might have been helpful in explaining which one of them is the female,” Zach says in response, and wow, aren’t they lucky to get both Zach and Gordon. Dean doesn’t see any sign of Michael or Lucifer though, so at least there’s that.
Dean spares Jack a second thought when he sees him stabbed in the chest with an angel blade and nothing happens. The demon-of-the-week ferrets his hope out instantly and crushes it under her high heel just as fast. “Think the Nephilim can bring your angel back?” she asks, her meatsuit’s pretty face turned up in a mocking sneer. “He can’t.”
“You know how it was between him and Benny?” And that is definitely Sam’s ‘so get this’ voice. “Benny is pretty great, and he’s a good leader, but Dean…he was born to be captain of this team, y’know? He doesn’t show it much, or anything, but he really cares about everybody and is always the first one to help.”
“Aidan would like that.”
“Fucking first goal of the season!” Benny yells. “That’s ten dollars you owe me, Winchester!”
Montero grounds out to third, leaving Rizzo high and dry halfway between second and first for the third out, and Dean groans, dropping his head to Cas’ shoulder.
Maybe slinking away isn’t the best idea. But he’s not really slinking, is he? He’s just…he’s pretty sure Cas doesn’t want him around. And he doesn’t really feel like being around Cas right now either.
be covering Cas, he just really…doesn’t want to. Because even if this is a pickup game of pond hockey there’s inevitably going to be touching, and if Dean wants to get over this crush his body has decided to go with, he really should try not to indulge whatever fantasies are lurking in the back of his brain.
Krushnic says it matter-of-factly, like just wanting to should be reason enough for Dean to let him come with. Which leaves him stumped, actually, because what the hell do you say to that? Meanwhile Sam’s decided this is as good a chance as any for him to fuck off and force some one-on-one time with Krushnic on Dean. He wonders if the water ride is even something Krushnic wanted to do, or if Sam somehow convinced him it’d be good times.
, Dean thinks hollowly, but even the preliminary thought doesn’t stop the other, more corrosive ones from scraping across his thoughts.
“Yeah. Yeah, alright,” he mumbles. “See you later.”
Dean jerks away from Cas as much as he can, turning to scowl at Kevin. “Try explaining that to Sam’s stats.”
He swears he’s actually getting harder, which what the fuck. He obviously needs to get laid.
Dean instantly notices the wallet and shakes his head. “No way man. I bought the tree.”
Cas yanks him around by his left shoulder, and Dean is in Hell all over again.
Cas finally pulls away from Dean’s neck, his eyes glinting. Dean can see his erection, the dark gray slacks he’s wearing hiding nothing, and he wonders briefly if he’s being selfish about wanting Cas’ mouth on him, wrapped around him, when Cas drops to his knees in front of him.
Dean almost thinks that was too harsh, but Krushnic seems unbothered, proving he really is heartless. “Even if you don’t want me, you do need me,” he points out, taking a careful sip of water.
“What would you like to talk about, Dean?”
“Shut up, Benny,” he finally replies.
runs through his head.
“You know the call girls here aren’t gonna be all that different from the ones in America, right Benny?”
After wandering around the market they find themselves in front of a stall full of wooden goods. The man who runs it is towards the back, actually carving something as people peer over his counter to watch. Dean, a little taller than everyone else there, laughs when he sees what it is.
He takes a running start and falls to a belly slide on the ice, poking the puck in with his stick like he’s playing pool, right between Gabriel’s legs.
“Are you sure?” She’s still squinting.
“Hey Cas!” Sam calls as soon as they walk in the door. He’s sitting in front of the tree with his book, the dog lying nearby. Dean shoots him a suspicious look.
“Usually he’d have taken yesterday off, but he was really adamant about coming for some reason.” Cas feels a pang of guilt as Sam continues. “But like I said, he was being weird, and it wasn’t much better this morning, so I made him promise to stay home.”
“That’s not true,” Cas counters immediately. “Dean is very smart, and quick. He listens very closely when I speak.”
“Well,” he glances at her nametag, “Alex, we’re in kind of a jam here. See, both of us managed to come down to dinner without our room keys, and now we’re locked out.” He glances back at Cas, who catches him looking and manages to pull his stoic face into an expression Dean thinks is supposed to be sad.
He doesn’t deserve this.
Cas is carefully setting the flowers down on his desk, like he’s worried they’re gonna break if he handles them the wrong way. “I don’t have anything for you.”
“Is Santa really here?” a small high pitched voice asks from nearby. Castiel would ignore it – he’s been hearing variations of the same question all day, had even had to explain to a little boy that Santa was on a ‘milk and cookies break’ with a completely straight face – if not for the voice that answered her.
“I believe that was the point,” Cas tells him, poking at Dean’s stomach. He can only assume there’s glitter there too.
Obviously she was seeing what she wanted to see though, because no way did he and Cas look anything like a couple, nor did Dean look like he’d be into guys. It was harmless.
“Not really,” Sam hastens to add at the look on Krushnic’s face.
“Gabriel,” Castiel growls lowly, more horrified than anything else.
It’s unheard of but, press week goes flawlessly. Gabriel doesn’t slip in any innuendos (at least none Bobby catches), Balthazar doesn’t hit on any of the reporters, Chuck manages to keep the stammer at a minimum and Dean didn’t repeat his embarrassing Freudian slip of last year (the reporter kept rubbing his hand up and down the mic, he can’t be blamed).
“Nothing.” Dean grabs a water bottle and a towel and inserts himself between Cas and Kevin despite the lack of room. Cas gives him a sullen glare and reluctantly scoots over. “Where have you been?” Dean asks accusingly.
“Gabriel,” Balthazar says suddenly. “Darling, are we queer?”
“It’s a no-contact sport man. He’d be kicked out faster than that time Benny went after the linesman with his water bottle.”
“I dunno what kind of operation you were running over there in the Motherland, but here in America we tend to want to like the guys we play with. Grab a beer, shoot the shit, make fun of football players,” Dean tells him, pointing at the bumblebee and handing it over to Cas once it’s in his hands. “Here.”
Daphne, Dean can tell, is one of those floaty pure faith religious types, so whoever this is in Cas’ body, he’s lucked out there. She praises Emmanuel’s healing like he’s Jesus walking on water, and looks at him with such adoration that Dean has a hard time focusing on her face.
If Dean is being completely honest with himself, it’s the friendship he misses more than anything else. Sure Cas is six feet of dark Russian sex with ridiculous eyes and stubble Dean should really not find attractive, but he’s also Dean’s friend. His best friend, probably. Just this dorky guy with an accent, a guileless tendency to say whatever pops into his head and a stubborn streak a mile wide.
“You never know, Gabriel could be on his Dirty Laundry List,” Balthazar’s saying.
“Pirates of the Caribbean didn’t have any Russians in it anyway.”
“Nothing he doesn’t deserve,” Dean assures him. Actually, Sam probably deserves a lot more for trying to make Dean’s friends for him (and halfway succeeding, dammit) but he’s a generous soul.
As far as Castiel knows, there’s no one else here, as the door had been closed with a sign hanging on it claiming Santa was out feeding his reindeer. However it’d been unlocked, and Castiel was loath to miss out on whatever Dean wanted with him here.
The phone rings again.
“I’m proud of you for not staying the night, Cassie. Don’t want Dean to think you’re easy, do we?”
?” Winchester asks derisively, and the leviathan smiles to itself.
“I found it in the bathroom,” Cas says, squinting at the paper. “What is Boystown?”
“Cas,” he starts, “why are we -”
Cas blinks. “Yes you are.”
“Seduction implies reciprocation,” Castiel tells her.
He’s not sure which one of them is really dragging the other as they climb off the ice, and he hears someone say something about Cas being ejected from the game, Bobby talking over them to repeat, “Damn it, you dumb fuck idjits, get to the trainer. So help me boy, if you don’t get checked for a concussion I’ll give you one myself, you morons…”
“What does enjoying your company have to do with Dean?”
Jo gestures vaguely to the other end of the ice, where Dean can make out Sam skating hand in hand with Jess. “I told you he didn’t like his birthday,” she says in a loud stage whisper to Charlie.
Sam squints a little. “You call him Cas.”
“I was a little unhappy because I knew I would have to speak with you,” Cas says seriously. There’s a loud round of laughter, and Dean knows they think Cas is joking.
In a fit of frustration, Castiel throws his phone across the room, letting it hit the wall with a satisfying smack and fall onto the armchair below. He’ll worry about the damage later. Right now, he doesn’t care.
The guys cheer, and Ash somehow manages to get up on a bench and launch himself at Gabriel, wrapping his hands around his neck and hanging off his back. “Doctor Badass in the house!” he whoops. Gabriel passes the bottle off to Balthazar, who drinks a worrying amount like he’s sucking down water before dumping the rest over Sam’s crotch.
“Is it attraction?” Cas asks quietly. “Oh, Dean…”
“Wha’?” Dean’s stomach jolts again. “Fuck you. I’m drunk.”
He doesn’t hear the clanging of the front door open, all the way down here. He doesn’t hear the thumping of footsteps or Sam’s calls, growing more frantic by the minute. Not until Sam’s right outside the door, and then he’s found him anyway.
“Like, really hate them,” Dean persists, following. He’s not sure why he’s pushing this. It’s not like he doesn’t want Cas to come. He doesn’t want him to hurt himself either though. “Scared of them, actually.”
“Yeah sure,” Dean dismisses. “Get on the ice and start passing drills, guys. Hey Bobby, can I talk to you for a minute?”
Suddenly Dean looks up, and somehow his eyes immediately find Castiel’s. “Cas!” he calls out, and though it’s not very loud over the noise all the diners are making, Castiel still blushes, making his way over to Dean as quickly as possible so that he won’t call out again.
“She reminded me a little of the women in Russia.”
“What about your family?”
The guy gestures for another beer and smiles wryly at Dean. “I’m Aaron.”
“I want you to feel good,” he says sternly, eyes boring into Dean like he knows exactly what Dean is thinking. And fuck, he probably does. There are some times even Sam can’t read him as well as Cas can, and Dean’s not entirely sure that’s just due to him having an angelic advantage anymore.
Krushnic shrugs. “You were practicing. I was told to join.”
“Yeah, I gotcha,” Sam says quickly, turning to Jess. “Hey, I’ve got to talk to Cas about something. Are we still, uh…still good for dinner tonight?”
“Hmm,” Cas says, almost sounding disappointed. “Doesn’t compare.” And then he’s kissing Dean, and it’s kind of hard to focus on anything else.
“Oh no!” Alex says, pulling the perfect face of polite disappointment. “What is your room number?”
“At the bar.” Cas hiccups a little, Dean can feel his stomach jump under his arm, and he has to close his eyes to stop a stupid smile from forming. He’s not sure he manages.
“Just follow my lead, alright? I do stuff like this all the time.”
Their gazes hold for what seems like an eternity, the air between them thick with tension. Castiel feels as if he’s going to drown in that pine and cinnamon smell, a scent that holds no good memories for him. He feels like he could choke.
“Practice?”
The shoot of disappointment Dean feels must show on his face, because Cas says, “I would rather have you in a bed,” and no other sentence could have gotten Dean going faster.
Of course Sam’s sitting in the back by Krushnic, the little traitor.
He feels Cas shudder beneath him and barely suppresses a grin, turning his attention to the skin just beyond the bolt of Cas’ jaw.
It was a hell of a week and a half.
Without warning, Cas is caressing his cheek, this look in his eyes that Dean really isn’t ready to analyze yet. His booze soaked brain dutifully files it away for later, and maybe he’ll look back on it. “You were hurt.”
says, “We don’t enjoy wasting time ma’am. Allow us to ask you some questions and then we can be on our way.”
The bottle is almost gone, and he can barely form a coherent thought anymore other than he wants to touch that ass. He needs to get up and go hit on her, he really does, but his legs aren’t listening to him. He’s beginning to get frustrated when the perfect ass straightens up, and the head turns, and Dean catches a glimpse of strong stubbled jaw and a flat, muscular chest.
“It’s a fucking goal!” Ed is yelling indignantly.
“Hockey players are hot,” Cas growls, pushing the jersey aside. “You are hot. And ridiculous. You play dress up and it’s…the word’s like a deer.”
Cas looks like he’s heading in the direction of a souvenir shop, and Dean guesses consumerism isn’t really that far off from anything “American” Cas thinks he’s learned on his own. Though Cas doesn’t really care about things, that bee from Six Flags that Dean had won him months and months ago does have a place of honor in their bedroom, and the only time Dean’d ever heard Cas raise his voice at Chekov was the one time he’d decided to use it as a chew toy.
“Relax man, the market isn’t going anywhere,” Dean assures him, gently pushing his way past Cas. “The kitchen sink, right?”
“Dean!” Cas says it like the air has been punched out of him, and before he knows it he’s being pulled off Cas. Before he can complain, before he can beg to go back, to finish, to taste him, Cas’ lips are on his, messily working his own open and entangling their tongues. Cas seems to love the taste of himself, and Dean can’t believe how turned on he is by Cas’ frenzied movements. He feels Cas take his own dick in his hand and pushes against him, nudges against Cas’ wet warm cock until Cas is forced to take it in his hand too. They’re pushing together, pulling, kissing, creating a friction that’s better than anything Dean has ever felt in his life before Cas is coming, and Dean isn’t too far behind, spurts of come shooting onto Cas’ hand again and their legs.
“Maybe. You seemed like you needed the distraction,” Cas replies, nodding at one of the computer screens above the booth. “I think that’s us.”
His hand is cradling the back of Cas’ head, his lips pressed to his, before the cheers have died down, and it’s lucky Sam is there to clear his throat when it’s time to sit down again.
“Okay,” Charlie says simply, “Who’s Alan J. Corbett?”
Dean shrugs and glances out the window. “I don’t do much of anything with Krushnic.”
Castiel swings himself back inside and closes the door behind him. He’s not totally sure what just happened, but he thinks it’s good.
Thinks because he’s got blue eyes and a fucking deep voice he’s suddenly in charge.
“Hi,” Dean clears his throat, and the silence in the room is almost deafening. “So uh, I’m Dean Winchester. I’m the Captain of the Chicago Cavalry, 2015 Stanley cup Champions.” Someone cheers and he smiles slightly. He can do this.
“You just suggested you were,” he bursts out in frustration. “How is that any different?”
“Relax, I’m gettin’ him a drink,” Dean says, nudging at Cas’ arm. “Go into the TV room. Gabriel will explain the rules while I get you something.”
Dean gives the book of South Mediterranean herbs (half of them boasting healing properties to ‘cleanse the devil within’) another two minutes before slamming it shut. Sam looks up from his laptop in surprise. “You find something?”
“I’ll show you,” Sam volunteers, leading her away and leaving Dean with Jo and, he’s just noticing, a slightly wide eyed Charlie.
“Squirrel!”
“Come sit by me,” Charlie pipes up. “Then I won’t have to feel so awkward about being the only redhead in the room.”
“Dude,” Dean finally pauses the movie. “Have you even kissed her yet?”
“You sat here first,” Dean says defensively, and he waits for Cas to jump up in disgust. But he doesn’t, just seems to relax more.
“Yes,” Cas frowns and his eyebrows scrunch. Dean looks away. “Why are we signing so many things?”
“Actually, many other children who are staying in the ward and some parents have showed up,” she says sheepishly, not at all apologetic. Dean can respect that. He did offer. He just hadn’t expected this to turn into a full on session. “So I have you on this side of the room and Mr. Krushnic over there.”
“Man,” Sam laughs, shaking his head. “It’s not a bad thing to love a dog, Dean.”
“Why would he do that?” Krushnic asks suddenly. He’s staring at the rag in Sam’s hands, which he must have managed to read upside down, or at least get the gist of. Actually kind of impressive. Dean can barely read English upside down, and it’s the only language he speaks.
“Back off man, we ain’t got no problem with you.”
“No kidding.” Dean remembers, faintly, spending three months in Fryeburg, Maine when he was ten. Dad had left him with Sam to go take care of some giant dog monster he’d caught wind of, and with nothing else to do in a town that small, Dean had been forced to resort to the library. He’d spent hours devouring the
“Uh,” Dean’s dick is still out, and his hips are still rocking, but somehow that seems less important now. “Why American Pie?”
“To study law enforcement in pop culture,” Cas reminds him. “I finished Chandler the other day. I enjoyed him much more than Hammet.”
“Krushnic?”
It’s not even a big deal. Somehow their games don’t even suffer, although Dean’s finding it hard to be excited about the fact that the Cavs are currently ranked second in their division. He wonders if somebody’s told Cas, or if he even knows what that means.
Dean finds himself, once again, standing when he shouldn’t be, whole when he should be broken and bloody.
The league must have dropped him, after the shit he pulled. The punches he threw because of Dean, the mess Dean caused. And now Cas was going to have to leave, go back to a country where nobody cared about him and Dean would never see him again.
, you fucking close minded asshole. Don’t call me again.”
“Sure you do! It’s a thing of beauty,” Gabriel says, gesturing towards the escalators. “Come on, let’s go upstairs.”
Not that any of his family was very good at it either, when the piety of the holiday was only used as a thinly veiled attempt to gather everyone together, to control them, pit them against one another and make passive aggressive jabs. Still Castiel had been treated like a pariah, for reasons he hadn't even begin to comprehend until he was eighteen and had his first sexual encounter with a man.
“Or maybe he’s just making sure he’s getting all the coal to the right place,” Dean returns, pushing his chair back.
Cas’ eyes flick briefly to Dean before directing back to Sam and Jess, and then to Dean again, longer this time.
Gabriel laughs at him and leans against the wall. Dean’s been parked on a chair down some random hallway for a while now, ever since the doctor kicked him out and he went wandering. He has no idea how long it’s been, or why Gabriel is here or how the hell he found him. “The entire team is here, Deano. You didn’t think you were Cassie’s only friend, did ya?”
“So uh,” the kid says. “Woah. Are you ready for the season?”
“I’m Charlie,” she smiles brightly and holds out her hand, which Dean shakes only after taking a while to realize what she wants. He’ll admit, this is the most unique pick up he’s ever experienced. “How are you?”
“HOMERUN!” he yells, grinning wildly at Cas, and Cas, clearly having no idea what’s going on, gives him one of his crinkly eyed, gummy smiles.
Dean snorts. Figures Sammy is gonna plan out his whole first kiss with a chick in some elaborate arrangement. “It’s not a proposal, Sam.”
Cas is curled up on his pillow by the time Dean’s got his pajamas on, hair ruffled and mouth slightly open. Dean climbs in next to him, wrapping an arm around Cas and fitting easily around him. Cas shifts and burrows into him like he’s been doing it his whole life, and something catches in Dean’s throat.
Alex’s face melts into that sappy look people get whenever weddings are mentioned and she nods. “Of course, of course, I’d love to help. Here you are.”
“Yeah, well, gimme a minute.”
“Castiel.”
The You Can Play Program is the real deal, as is the story of the founders. Unfortunately, the NHL still has not had any known LBGTQ members, despite the league's insistence that they are more than ready for them.
“Oh, I’d totally petition for that,” Charlie says solemnly. Cas glances at her like it was an odd thing to say, and Dean realizes he hadn’t actually mentioned Jo and Charlie were dating, or whatever.
He never thought he’d have this. He loves Cas.
Dean gets on last to make sure nobody skips out, which means the only spot left on the bus is up front near the eighty year old bus driver, next to Ed.
“What the fuck is that supposed to mean?” He’s gonna kill Sam later. If he threw him out back Ellen’s seagulls would probably eat him, no one would ever know.
Besides, most of this is still Krushnic’s fault.
He barely realizes that’s he’s leaning forward, practically halfway over the bar, when there’s a hand on his shoulder so familiar to him he almost hates himself for knowing the shape and weight of that hand. Almost.
Dean’s never walked to the damn trainer so fast.
Turns out instead of the typical Brunswick Zone shit Dean was expecting, Cas had managed to find probably the only bowling alley in Chicago that Dean could fall in love with. Hell, Cas was lucky Dean wasn’t dropping to his knees and proposing right now. The place is all old school American, with wooden panels and scorecards you fill out by hand. He’s pretty sure he audibly whimpers when he sees the burgers on the menu.
Of course this launches Sam’s smart guy explanation of labor and class distinction, which eventually turns into a rant that grows increasingly heated. When Sam had been little and in his rebellious phase, he’d always warned Dad he was going to run off and become a lawyer. Dean thinks he’d have made a good one, but it just wasn’t possible for Sam to get away. Hockey was in their blood.
He’s still dizzy, but the dull ache in his head is bearable enough, even with his eyes open, so he sits up, swearing as the blood rushes and shifts and his head pounds, feeling heavy. He considers lying down and just going back to sleep, but he’s fucking hungry, so he slowly steps out of bed.
“Dean, what,” Cas says when Dean lifts his hips and flips back over, but Dean shushes him. Cas’ mouth is an absolute wreck, lips puffy and smeared with gold glitter, and Dean grins at him.
“I haven’t fallen for anything,” Castiel scowls. “I actually find him rather annoying.”
“Yeah,” he mumbles. “She doesn’t like me.”
“It would be the book of John,” Krushnic corrects, “Dean, why is there a bus here?”
“That was good Cas. Way better than last time. It was an, ah, interesting method.”
Dean stares up at him, breathing heavily . He can feel Cas’ heart beating in time with his own, his knee brushing lightly against the crotch of his pants, and has to shut his eyes quickly in order to get some control over himself.
Sam’s not gonna take shit, Dean can tell right away. His brow furrows and his nose scrunches up the way it used to when dad would tell him hockey players didn’t need to learn math, and he could take the less advanced class and be thankful for the extra practice time having easy homework got him. “Doesn’t really matter, Dean, since it has to be talked about sooner or later. Bobby’s really pissed at you. You’re supposed to set an example for the team.”
Hey guys, I'm really sorry about this being late. You have no idea how bad I feel. I got back late from my trip last night and I just didn't have the energy to do anything. I'm hoping to get December 9 up later today so we're back on track.
“You doing okay?” he asks Cas as they had off down the corridor.
He thinks Cas says something, but it doesn’t register, and then he’s preoccupied with the absolute shit storm that is autograph sessions. The way their table is set up means that Cas doesn’t get anybody until Dean finishes with them, so he tries to power through as quickly as possible so Cas isn’t just sitting there. But what can he say? The people love him. It’s always the dudes that try to stick around the longest, he thinks because the chicks just want to stare. The guys have questions, ones he tries his best to answer before Hannah clears her throat loudly and passes them on to Cas.
The pleased eye crinkles are worth it.
“Yeah, you cockblocked your own boyfriend,” Gabriel says cheerfully.
“I’m Sarah,” she replies, and Dean is glad that the name at least sounds familiar. “I was just leaving,” she shifts awkwardly, looking at Dean, but Dean can’t even begin to guess what she wants, and his mouth is still full of beef, so he nods and tries to swallow it down as quickly as possible (no doubt looking incredibly attractive in the process).
Cas does it one more time, somehow with more friction, and Dean’s hands shoot up to clamp around his upper arms. “Woah, stop,” he says in a strangled voice, and Cas does immediately, looking curiously down at him. “Just…hang on a minute.”
“Make the baby smile,” Cas orders.
“Cas!”
The garland and candycanes are added through another cup of hot chocolate, and suddenly Castiel finds himself settled on to his couch next to Dean, the only light to see by the lights in the tree, since Dean had insisted that the view was better in the dark.
“What?” Dean asks again. Sam snatches the paper before he does, and from the front cover he sees with a slight bit of relief that it’s a gossip rag, not a major paper.
Dean rolls his eyes. “Sure. Were you fine before too? Or the hospital go wasting drugs on you?”
Call him a fucking sap, but something doesn’t sit right with him and not fully sharing this whole experience with Cas, not on Valentine’s Day.
Instead he empties the cutlery drawer into the sink and starts scrubbing that too.
“You’re so pessimistic,” Sam huffs, like it personally offends him. Probably does, optimism practically pours out of his ears.
Except Dean and Cas don’t talk, especially not about how they’re feeling. They’re fucking soldiers, of course they’re not okay, and there’s no point in asking, in dragging the stuff deep inside them out into the open until you’re laid out bleeding, your heart completely held in someone else’s hands.
“Jesus!” Sam yelps, jumping up and almost knocking over Kevin. Dean laughs loudly, taking in the scene before him. Everyone is so fucking happy. It’s not like they’ve never made it to playoffs before – they did just last year. But they’d had a second round exit, had promised to do better. This year feels different. There’s something in the air.
“Sorry,” he says suddenly. “You know, about the whole tree thing. I know how you feel about Christmas. I dunno why I asked.”
He manages to rip his mouth away long enough to stupidly gasp, “what movie is this?”
“The league is investigating Gordon,” Sam speaks up suddenly.
Dean brings him outside and downstairs, where his large black car is parked and waiting on the curb. He explains as he opens the door for Castiel that he usually keeps her stored away from the winter because of all the salt on the roads, but, “she comes out for special occasions, and I thought you two should meet.” Castiel is very careful in the car after that, trying hard not to move too much or mess anything up.
“Victor, it’s bullshit,” he says angrily, yanking his skates out of the bag.
Yeah, Dean does know. He’d never deny that he was good looking, because he knows he is, but some guys have commented on it before. Especially when he was younger. Calling him pretty and fairy and light on his skates. They learned real quickly how full of bullshit they were after Dean had delivered a solid punch, but yeah. He gets it.
“Over the line, over the fucking line,” Benny growls.
“What, arguing about your stupid cool guy hang ups? No, that’s pretty on par for the course with your idiocy.”
“That’s Sammy’s polite way of asking if you two love each other now,” Dean informs them. Sam kicks him under the table.
The guy rummages in a rack close to him and hands Dean a jersey with his name and number on the back. He lifts his hand in an awkward half kind of acknowledgement before heading off to find Sam. He has no idea what he’s going to do with either one of these, but whatever. He can probably pass them off to Jo and Charlie if worse comes to worse.
“So a lot of the people this time of year don’t actually know what they’ve come in here for,” Charlie grins. “They’ll come in and tell us their kid loves music, or that their daughter really wants that doll that does the snow thing, and our job is to help them find the perfect gift.”
Sam called him ridiculous. Cas looked at him with those stupid, sad eyes. But Dean knew even what they weren’t willing to admit.
“Whine all ya want about it, princess. You and the boys don’t deserve the day off.”
“Did you have a good time?” Cas asks, pulling Dean from his thoughts, and Dean glances over at him.
“Stuff it up your ass, Crowley,” Dean snaps without breaking stride.
Somehow Gabriel has found them, and he drags them back into the main room while managing to shove shots at them at the same time. “Drink, assholes!” he encourages. “It’s 2015!”
Castiel’s hand flies to his black and yellow hat, fingers absentmindedly running over the bumps and ridges of the embroidered bee on the front. “I like bees.”
Well fuck. Dean’s gonna hate this. Rookies suck.
“Get off, you perv,” Sam says, voice muffed from Dean’s palm smashed into his mouth. “Don’t you have sex in these things?”
“You’re interested in bees?” he asks incredulously. “C’mon Cas. Dr. Sexy is on.”
“Sure,” he says over his shoulder. He’s already out the door. No more alcohol for him tonight, looks like he’s fucked his head up enough for the weekend.
“So you are dating.”
It’s not smart bringing up to dad to Sam. They’d always fought, constantly, using Dean as the mediator who always tried to please them both. If Sammy had started noticing guys, he’d have said something about it and gone out and found a boyfriend out of spite. Dean had gone the exact opposite direction, throwing himself at multiple girls in order to fit into his father’s expectations.
This time Dean does spit out his beer. “When the fuck was I flirting?”
“Cas!” Dean rushes towards him, plunges his hands into the Empty to wrap around Cas’ waist in an attempt to haul him out. “Cas, what do I do? Should I call Jack? JACK!”
Meg finds him there, on the floor, just as he’s placing the last Barbie on the shelf, and she raises an eyebrow at him. How was your first day?” she asks.
“Gross,” Dean chuckles, and to Castiel’s relief his hand falls from Castiel’s wrist to clasp at his hand. “But I’ll remember him if I need a midget for anything. Maybe to get into a small space.”
“I thought you should know,” he mutters, turning his face into Dean’s neck, where it’s even warmer and he can feel the reassuring beat of his heart. “You’re my favorite part of Christmas this year.”
Cas is not in his trenchcoat. Not that Dean’s never seen him without it before. He did, after all, spend a year stubbornly transferring it from the trunk of one stolen car to the next, and he remembers with no small amount of pain the red hoodie Cas had been in when Dean had kicked him out of the bunker. Hell, there are even times that he’s been able to convince the guy to take it off if he’s been in the bunker for more than a few hours, so yeah, Dean knows what Cas looks like without the trenchcoat; he’s seen Cas in his shortsleeves and a hoodie and even a Gas N’ Sip vest.
Perched on the table in the library of the bunker, Dean silently urges Cas to figure it out. For him to realize that this wasn’t Dean’s choice, and that he’d never turn him away if it weren’t for Sam. Always for Sam, that was Dean’s job. Surely Cas could see that.
Dean doesn’t know what to make of the whole thing. He introduces himself as Emmanuel, and he has a wife named Daphne. He’s wearing khakis, and a blue knitted sweater, and Dean stands in their pristine living room with its china cabinet in his grubby boots and unwashed jeans and stares, and stares.
Cas doesn’t move from Hannah’s seat, which makes it even more difficult to concentrate, because Cas is a lefty. Every time he signs something his arm brushes Dean’s, and he’s pretty sure that it’s happened enough that he has to be doing it on purpose. Right? Dean can’t be imagining this.
“That was only once!”
“This is very good,” Cas says in awe, way too exaggerated to be fake.
In all seriousness, it didn’t look like Krushnic enjoyed having to talk to the reporters at all. Dean would sympathize, because except for a few they’re only there to dumpster dive for any possible gossip. But it’s Krushnic, so he manages not to feel too bad.
Dean grins. “I’m pretty good with my hands.”
“That sounds very boring,” he says, looking slightly confused.
“CASTIEL,” Billie’s voice is louder this time, and there’s pounding on the dungeon door. “Open up Castiel!” it sings.
Dean pulls back and Castiel superstitiously runs his gloved hand over his mouth, trying not to feel too disappointed. He’s sure Dean was going to kiss him.
“Not like you’re really one to talk anyway,” Dean says, gesturing to Castiel’s hat with his elbow.
“Thank you,” he says solemnly, walking away without another word. His path to the escalator takes him through the fragrances section, and he ducks easily out of the path of well meaning saleswoman who believe his one purpose here is to buy a present for his girlfriend. Riding the five sets of escalators is even a less desirable experience, since the lack of noise means his journey is accompanied by a pop version of ‘White Christmas’. By the time Castiel has made it to the fifth floor, he is in a thoroughly bad mood.
Because she’s an asshole, not because she’s flirting with Cas.
And then it doesn’t matter, because Cas is sticking his tongue out, and Dean is instantly riveted. He watches as the tongue twists, folds into a flower shape, then rolls back on itself. It should be fucking weird, but he’s distracted by what that flexible tongue would feel like in his mouth, working over his body, dipping into other places Dean’s not totally sure he’s even comfortable expressing in his head.
“Well, yeah!” Dean says, straightening up indignantly, “Because I take them every game and you don’t take—“
So Dean hadn’t stuck around to ogle at the new guy. At the end of practice he’d skated calmly off the ice (“More like stormed off,” the snide Sam voice that lives in his head says), handed all his gear off to Jerry, the equipment manager, and had gone off to his car to wait for Sam so they could finally get to the bar.
He needs to get his god damn life together.
“I dunno, Cas, Jesus, go ask Sam.”
“How?” he insists, because he really does need an explanation for how this doesn’t change his entire world. Yeah, he fucking wanted to have sex with Cas, but that hadn’t happened, had it? Worse than that, they’d finally done something, they’d kissed, and Dean
He needed to get a grip.
“Oh,” Sam’s expression clears and he takes a bite of his food. “Yeah, they kiss sometimes. In greeting or to say thanks, or whatever. And no, it’s not weird and it’s not gay.” He wrinkles his nose. “Why’re you asking?”
She’s fucking right too, which pisses Dean off enough to quit puzzling over how the hell she’d figured out who he was so fast. Scowling slightly, he opens the door and is immediately greeted by the white sterility only hospital rooms can achieve. The league’s health insurance at least gets a private room, something Dean can’t help but be grateful for when Cas calls, “Dean!” the second he appears and heat rises to his cheeks.
Dean knows he’s fucked up, but he sure as hell doesn’t want to be the one to speak first.
Dean does not have the brainpower left to be offended on behalf of his Ernie Banks jersey. “Baseball players are cool,” he says, trying to thrust forward and whimpering when Cas’ hand on his hip holds him back with no effort at all. “And hot.”
“I’m not attracted to him,” he complains, frustrated. “He’s just a friend I happen to want to have sex with.”
“Such as?”
“Your dirty laundry list?” Balthazar raises an eyebrow. “It’s your same sex exceptions, dear innocent captain.”
“He’s not as good as me,” Krissy says, pursing her lips. “I want to skate so I can kick Dean’s ass.”
“Oh people can come up with all kinds of things.” Edlund almost sounds cheerfully amused by it. “Morality issues, for one. Is it fair for you to be on the same team, to play together when you know one another so intimately. It might put you a step ahead of everyone else. Fairness, of course, none of your teammates travel to games with their wives, and you two room together every night. Which leads to distraction, which is a legitimate concern – can you concentrate fully when you’re around one another? What if you have a nasty break up? On top of all that you’ll have to deal with all the typical ramifications of coming out as a homosexual male athlete.”
Dean turns on his stool to face the speaker, a stocky man with hard eyes and a beard flanked by two other men. He can tell they’re already a couple of drinks in, in addition to the beers in each of their hands. “Sorry man. We need it.”
“Easy, Gabriel’s the most annoying, Andy’s usually late, and everyone on the team is gonna say Sam has the nicest hair, but only because he wants it so badly.”
“It’s fine,” Dean says quickly to Cas’ look of alarm. “I’ll just beat a guy up at the game tomorrow and it’ll be fixed.”
Relief, probably.
“Alright,” Dean agrees easily. “Where do you want me?”
“I would never nap on the job, Meg.”
Dean’s got him sideways on the seat now, legs dangling out of the truck. The wind is biting and cold, but Dean’s hands are warm pressed against his cheeks. All he does is stand there, one thumb gently brushing back and forth, until Castiel begins to calm down. He can hear the rush of cars on the highway behind them, and he avoids Dean’s eyes.
“No, Dean – please.” Cas clutches his hand around Dean’s wrist. It’s not a restraining grip. It’s gentle. He won’t stop him.
“Not in the mood, Jo.”
Later, when they are finished and Dean is lying in the dark, unable to sleep with Cas pressed against his side, he will think about how he doesn’t deserve this. About how he’s spent his whole life denying himself happiness like this in order to save others from himself. About how Cas deserves better than this.
Dean remains silent. This really, really isn’t something he wants to get into, and he doesn’t understand why Cas is pushing so hard for it. It’s not a big deal, anyway – John died a couple of years ago, and before that was just Dean’s childhood. Nothing special.
Even if he was constantly waiting for the holiday to make his life miserable, like it always did.
He carefully avoids looking at Sam as he stomps around the Impala and yanks the driver’s side door open. What the fuck was that?
“Uh huh,” Sam says slowly. “Did you get home okay last night?”
“You’re hurt,” Cas says, and Dean’s surprised to hear that he sounds fucking angry about it. “Why did you fight?”
Sam cracks a grin. “Yeah. I got you an Italian beef with peppers.”
Of course, it hadn’t had the pleasure of meeting the Winchester brothers, or Castiel, while it pretended to be a workman tending to just one of the many assembly lines producing the modified foodstuffs the Leviathan needed to make humans tasty and compliant. Not important enough. Just one of many. But now…
“Get the fuck out of him.”
“You’re too early,” Cas tells it, still standing. “It’s not time.”
“Great. You can go now, just be here at ten tomorrow morning. And remember, black shirt!”
He just hadn’t thought that his coming out would be so…out there.
“Dirty, Cas.”
Sam huffs off into the kitchen and Dean hauls himself off the couch the second he hears a pan clang on the stove top, a mixture of fear and guilt forcing him to shoulder Sam out of the way and continue the process of making omelets on his own. Sam is uncharacteristically quiet while Dean cooks, seemingly content to give the dog all of his attention instead.
“You said you had issues.”
“Yeah, Cas said you were sleeping it off. You want me to come over?”
“I want to buy that,” Cas is insisting, trying to push a wad of money at the guy.
It’s one of those baseball type games, the ones where you’re meant to throw the ball at weighted pins that look like cats. Cas is obviously sulking at being forced to do menial labor for whatever fucking stuffed animal he’s decided he has to have, but he takes one of the balls at Dean and throws it at the pins.
“I got a date with Lola Bunny!” Gabriel whoops as soon as he comes into view. He holds out a hand to high five Cas, and ends up slapping his ass when Cas doesn’t respond.
It takes them three overtimes to finally win the game. Practically sixty more minutes of hockey. They drag themselves to the airport and sleep the entire way home, too exhausted to celebrate.
“Hey Cas,” he hears Jo say. “Is that Dean’s jersey?”
“Dean,” he says quietly, hesitantly, and Dean feels his nose nudging just behind his ear, the whisper of breath along his skin.
“Castiel,” he replies, and Dean nods and drops his hand in order to retrieve his fork and begin digging enthusiastically into his pie. He seems unbothered by the slight.
Cas purses his lips like Dean knew he would, ‘cause he’s a prude and Dean still thinks that face is funny as fuck, which is why he likes to leer at Cas whenever he can. “Hockey is your job,” he says, not for the first time. “Do you read?”
Sam looks surprised. “That’s not what I think at all,” he assures him. “I just thought…with Dean so overly happy this time of year and you so bummed, maybe you guys could hold off until the New Year, when things have calmed down a bit.”
, Sam. No. Absolutely not.”
“After reviewing the play, the goal is inconclusive,” the suddenly loud voice of the ref on the TV says. “No goal.”
The mermaid smiles cheerfully up at him from the cup. Castiel frowns. “This is Starbucks.”
“Can I tell you,” Cas says, placing a kiss on Dean’s collarbone as he undoes his zipper, “I cannot believe that you wore a sports uniform when you spend your life in them.”
“Fuck, Cas,” Dean bites out, and he can feel the familiar heat building in his belly as his dick is thrust into the mattress, can tell Cas is getting close as the rhythm he’s worked up becomes more erratic. “C’mon baby, you got it, c’mon.”
“Sorry about my brother’s lack of manners. He’s a bit moody today.”
“But what did you do for fun?” Sam asks, and Dean shoots him a warning look. He still doesn’t know much about Cas’ life in Russia, not really for lack of trying. Anna won’t say much about it either, though in typical fashion she seems much more outwardly angry about it than Cas ever is. Cas just seems…resigned. But he always gets moody when it’s brought up, and Dean is still too emotionally stupid to figure out how to broach it.
‘Course, that friendship is pushed to the very back of his mind the second they set foot on the ice for warm ups twenty minutes before the game the next night.
“Because he mentioned my mom!” Dean cuts in, almost yelling. A pedestrian pushes roughly past him, swearing, and he doesn’t even notice. “Because my dad would be fucking disappointed if he could see me now, Cas, if he knew what the fuck was going on with me, just like he always fucking was!”
“What, no beef?”
“Oh, right.” He awkwardly slides out of the booth and lets Cas pass, feeling the uncomfortably cool spot on his leg where his hand had been.
“What’d he do?”
Either Sam will block it or Gabe will.
“Why are you always putting yourself down like that?” Sam asks, annoyed, like Dean is acting any different than he has the past twenty four years. “Cas and I were talking the other day—“
Sam can’t know what Dean’s thinking because Dean doesn’t even know what the hell he’s thinking.
“Fucker knocked my glove!” Gabriel spits, as mad as Dean’s ever seen him. “I couldn’t make the damn save!”
“You like it?”
“I mean, he really likes you, don’t get me wrong,” Sam is quick to say. “He talks about you all the time, and I seriously have never seen him so excited for a date. It just kind of sucks that it has to be Christmas time.”
Dean has never told Cas he loves him.
“I know, he’s adorable, right?”
Krushnic scrutinizes him suspiciously, which weirdly makes Dean respect him a little more. At least he’s not gullible. Inviting him up for coffee two days after he tried to beat him up is kind of weird, but that’s Sam’s fault. This is only a one time deal. The more on guard Krushnic stays, the faster he can get through this and prove Sam wrong.
Tessa’s hand, which has been wandering dangerously close to his hardening dick, pulls back suddenly, and he stifles a whimper of disappointment. But she stands up and grabs his hand, pulling him up as well and gesturing to the blonde.
“I’m sure,” Cas murmurs. “But what was he like as a man?”
As a kid who’d grown up at Bobby’s and had spent his limited free time out on the backyard pond practicing his wrist shot, Dean’d never really thought of the place as anything special. He can tell though, as soon as he sees the look on Cas’ face, that it must be.
Cas starts to lean towards Dean, close enough that Dean’s heart begins to beat faster before Cas seems to think better of whatever the hell he was going for and he places a hand on Dean’s arm. “Thank you, Dean,” he says quietly.
“I was talking about Jack,” the angel bites out before the leviathan can ask what the angel did to the Winchester’s mother.
“Yeah, yeah, you’re hot shit.”
And now here they were in this place again, separated. Cas came here with him even though Dean told him he was dead to him. That everything bad that has ever happened to him is because of Cas. That he will never, ever forgive him.
“So,” he finally says. Dean has brought him to the edge of the park, where flat concrete bleeds once again into tall skyscrapers, signs warning of potentially hazardous falling icicles and advertisements for the polar bear at Lincoln Park zoo.
Castiel purses his lips and reaches to the counter next to the sink for the wrench he’d been using earlier, handing it down to Dean. Dean pokes hi head out as soon as he’s got it in his hand, looking skeptical. “Cas,” he asks, “your pipes leaking got anything to do with you taking a wrench to them?”
“He manipulated him, he made him promises, said ‘paradise on earth’ and Cas bought it and you know what it got him? It got him dead! Now you might be able to forget about that but I CAN’T.”
He’s back on the bench, frowning up at the replay on the big screen – seriously, he couldn’t do this shit again if he tried – when Cas shoves in next to him and leans close. “That was amazing, Dean,” he says quietly.
It becomes harder to ignore Jack. Kid is earnest as all hell and promises that he can get Mary back from Apocalypse World. Sam is eager for Dean to embrace him as well and Dean is…tired. He’s just tired. If all that’s left is the hope that mom is still alive, then that’s what he’ll have to cling to.
Sam shrugs him off and Dean is forced to suffer the most awkward thing he’s ever witnessed as Sam moves his hands first to his lap, then to the bench beside him, then to his knee.
“Or when the announcer says ‘Winchester brothers’.”
“Dunno, it’s nice looking,” he answers. “Plus, kind of nice that it makes you feel so good without needing anything in return. Just give it some water, it’ll last for weeks.”
“No,” he says. “I do not like Christmas.”
When he learns Cas was just running from him again, didn’t want to be found, he ignores the feelings that threaten to take over his body. This is Purgatory after all, and things are uncomplicated here. He’s found Cas, so only one objective remains – get back home to Sam.
“Red line’s backed to hell, and I’ve got a reputation on Addison,” Gabriel says cheerfully.
“Don’t look so smug,” Dean tells his brother sourly, making a face at him.
Well that’s it. Dean is determined to hate him.
A rush of warm air caresses his ear. “They’re watching you,” Cas says softly.
Eli raises an eyebrow at his still half full glass, and Dean quickly gulps it down, the burn barely even registering. “C’mon, man. Gotta ring in the New Year right.”
He doesn’t ask maliciously, or sarcastically, or even as a challenge. The words are dripping with genuine innocence, and somehow that pisses Dean off more than anything else would. Because this guy thinks he’s not afraid, and now he really is some kind of pansy if he can’t prove that he isn’t. “’Course I’m not afraid.”
Cas pauses and regards him carefully. He losts his helmet somewhere along the way, Dean as well, and his hair’s fucked six ways to Sunday, with a bruise forming along his jaw bone. Dean knows he must look just as shit, if the dull pain shooting through his eye is anything to go by. He almost misses it when Cas, eyes still locked on Dean, slowly, deliberately licks his lips.
Dean teases his baby bro about his inability to ask out a girl until Sam gets mad enough to slam his locker, prompting Bobby to stomp out of the office and yell at them all to quit being idjits. Then he announces the practice for the day is a contact practice, and Dean’s so damn excited he’s out on the ice before anyone else.
He could do this though. He was a public figure. He signed up for this.
It doesn’t get much better from there.
“What, you were enjoying yourself?” Dean jokes, but he swears Cas nods as he continues to dig into his food. “Sam just came down. We gotta get going.”
“Top,” Cas informs him.
“This is why you don’t have a lot of friends,” Sam muttered.
Dean’s eyes soften as Sam happily pulls out his phone and taps the screen before passing it to Castiel. The picture is of a large, boxy looking car wrapped in red and white striped wrapping paper with a huge green bow on top. The whole thing looks meticulously done, with everything covered but the wheels. Sam reaches over to swipe the screen again, the next picture of a now unwrapped sleek looking black car, wrapping paper strewn about and Dean with a very annoyed expression on his face.
“Did you learn that from Sam? Never do it again. You won’t ever get laid,” Dean says. “And I dunno man. Vonnegut was a pretty boss old guy.”
“Why aren’t you two going on roller coasters and fucking around with the other guys?” Dean asks, shoving his hands into his pockets. It’s fairly warm for October, and the park is already filling up. Dean had forgotten that it’s Fright Fest time, meaning the park is full of assholes dressed up in costumes. Dean hopes someone gets Sam’s reaction when they wander into the Mardi Gras area. Even he was wary of the weird ass clowns walking around there.
“I can also make shapes with my tongue.”
“Alright,” Dean says. “But you didn’t have to watch the movies at all man. It was just a suggestion.”
“No,” Dean says.)
“Yeah,” Dean nods firmly.
They end up in the TV room watching A Christmas Story with Bobby, Sam and Dean laughing before the jokes are even said, Dean explaining patiently that, “Yeah Cas, fragile
He doesn’t know why he keeps doing that.
“My semen is appropriately decorated,” Cas tells him solemnly.
“I hadn’t realized you and Dean were being paid to swear everyone in Chicago off of Christmas songs.”
“We’re finally doing this, and I don’t even get to see you naked,” he says. “At least take your coat off man.”
“And the bottle of Johnnie Walker Blue in the cupboard.”
“What? I’m not.”
“Perhaps not fully,” Castiel amends, but I see why you wanted me to meet Mrs. Mosley.”
) scowls darkly in response.
“Can someone please inform me why it’s alright for Dean to flirt with Cassie, but my flirting with Gabriel is practically cause for a third World War?”
“Oh yeah,” Dean squints at him and waves a vague hand. “You got…you got nice eyes. But Cas has got blue eyes.” He frowns. “You’re bigger ‘an Cas, though. I gotta be the big one.”
Castiel fumbles his glove off with clumsy fingers and shoves his hand into the pocket of his peacoat, pulling out a crumpled and worn scrap of paper. “I’m looking for Meg Masters,” he says, reading it. “She works in…” he squints at Gabriel’s messy handwriting, reads the word ‘butt’ and shoves the paper back into his pocket. “With toys, I think,” he finishes awkwardly.
“Like me?” Castiel asks.
,” the angel snaps, in a tone that clearly reads
“I don’t have all day, Ms. Contrarez,” Cas says quietly, voice low. “I don’t believe you’re an unintelligent young woman. So tell me again. Did you start that fire yourself?”
“Hey stranger. Don’t think I’ve seen you since the last time you came over to terrorize my kid.”
“Why?”
Dean scowls deeply and drops onto the bed, ripping open the packet of trading cards in his hand. Anything to get his brain to calm the fuck down so he can sleep. Boring stats of guys in the league he hasn’t even heard of yet should do that.
Tessa and the blonde are giggling about something, all Dean can hear are their higher voices as the lobby blurs by him in a mess of colors and lights until suddenly, he’s pressed up against a mirror, staring at himself. Tessa is between his arms and the blonde is pressed in behind him. It takes him a moment to get over the confusion of staring at himself, until the floor starts moving, and he trips a little, and there’s skin, so he begins kissing.
“Ah,” Dean’s beginning to see why she’s got such an attitude. “He your brother?”
“Yes,” Cas agrees. “But at least you admit it.”
“All the time,” Cas says solemnly.
,” he says, and Dean’s not sure if it’s a prayer or a curse.
And he leaves.
He finds himself as quite as Dean by the time Charlie returns.
“I know what you need,” Dean agrees, sliding his hands into Cas’ shorts and cupping his ass briefly before sliding them down. “I got ya, Cas.”
“Cas,” he’s saying over and over, and it sounds like he’s speaking underwater.
The little girl giggles and toes the piano again, the soft note ringing through the store, barely heard over the chatter of shoppers and the Christmas music blaring over the loud speakers.
“That ain’t flirtin’,” Benny snorts. “It’s sexual harassment.”
Dean swears and presses the off button on the remote much harder than he intended, tossing it aside. He’d gotten to Crowley’s early to have his own skating time, and instead he ended up watching early morning sports talk and listening to reporters rave about Krushnic and how good he was for the team.
“If it makes you feel better, I don’t know either.”
When Dean and Sam return from Alaska, Cas is standing in the bunker next to Jack. Dean waits only long enough to spare Cas a glance and get a nod before he’s hugging the kid.
“Cas,” he groans, burying his face in Cas’ neck, and Cas shifts, his hand slipping further.
“Oh, I’ll start on an easy one!” Jess says. “Never have I ever been arrested.”
There’s something warm pressed against his back, and even though this isn’t his mattress he figures it must be the dog. But Chekov is squirmy and has some kind of weird, ‘Dean doesn’t want to be woken up radar,’ which is definitely the case at the moment, and whatever’s in bed with him ain’t moving.
“I was under the impression that was the point of a Christmas tree.”
“Sure you did,” he says, squinting at the blurry picture. “Why does every pap photo of you make you look like you’re posing to be a GQ cover model?”
“You guys suck,” Dean complains.
Castiel feels an irrational jolt of annoyance at his response. His dislike of all things Christmas isn’t something he yells from the rooftops, but he’s used to a little more than indifference whenever the truth does come out. Usually he’s bombarded with reasons to feel holiday cheer and suggestions on how to accomplish such a feeling until he wants nothing to do with anybody until the new year has arrived. For some reason, Dean’s completely opposite reaction is irritating.
“Stop squirmin’.”
“You assholes are the only people I talk to anyway,” Dean counters in a grumble, glancing at their finished cookies. “You wanna get those in the fridge before they melt, Sam? Unless you’re gonna eat them now.”
“You told Ben to punch me!”
Dean doesn’t reply. He may be acting childish, but he’s finding it hard to care. He does not lift his foot like a fucking ballerina. And Sam pulls left because he’s never gotten used to being so freakishly huge, not for lack of skill.
“Dean Winchester,” suddenly Charlie is leaning around Castiel, and she must be on her tip toes, because she’s almost managed to make it up to his shoulder. “Are you seducing my co-workers?”
The driver gives a loud snort Dean takes as a wave off, so he quirks an eyebrow and calls out a thanks again. Surprisingly Cas didn’t wait for him and is heading for the long line at the door, so Dean quickly catches up to him, grabbing his bicep. “Dude. We don’t have to wait in line.”
“If I’d known you were gonna kiss me like that, I probably would have remembered it was Valentine’s Day yesterday.”
“You,” Gabriel says fiercely, immediately turning on him. “Cas was fine until you started all this cheery, ‘tis the season bull crap. Why can’t you leave him alone Winchester, huh? The kid doesn’t like Christmas, he doesn’t want you to stick mistletoe up his ass or whatever the hell it is you’re aiming for!”
“Is it true you set a pot of water on fire, Sam?” Charlie asks.
Bobby scowls at the both of them and chooses to completely ignore then in favor of skating off with Ellen, leaving Jess to pat Sam on the arm. “I like your hair, Sam,” she says soothingly.
Yeah, that sounds good. Dean’s blaming this whole thing on Crowley.
“Dean.”
Why was he so attracted to Cas, god dammit, he is
“Why is there a line if we don’t have to wait?”
“Why are you pouting?” Sam asks.
“Doesn’t make you less of a man, brother,” Benny says nicely. “Or any more likely that you’d be able to beat me in a fight.”
Dean snorts, “yeah, or she’s not stupid enough to risk the loony bin.” He spots Cas’ ass ugly Lincoln Continental down the block and pretends he doesn’t tap down a little harder on the gas. Cas is standing outside of it, leaning against the side and staring with a look of abject concentration at his phone when they pull up behind him.
Times like this are when Castiel is reminded of how much Gabriel had wanted to be a chef when they were growing up. In their family, food was something that just appeared before you, not something lovingly created by people, and culinary school had been the big joke between their older brothers for a few years. Gabriel hadn’t gone, out of a lingering sense of duty to the family or just from sheer lack of money, Castiel didn’t know. Sometimes he wishes his brother could have done it – he’d have no doubt been amazing. But he seemed happy in his candy shop, and in true Novak fashion, Castiel has never tried to talk to him about it.
The plane from San Jose had landed at O’Hare at about two in the morning, and by four Dean was dragging his ass through the door of his apartment, ignoring how his taxi reached the apartment the same time as Krushnic’s, and how stupid it was that he’d decided he couldn’t ride in the same one as the guy even though they were going to the same place.
“Yeah it’s fucking bothering me!” Dean cries, all semblance of whatever he was holding together shattering. “You come into my apartment, you stay here, and now you’re folding my clothes and you think just any way you do it means they’re gonna fit?”
Perhaps if he put Dean in a batter mood, he’d forget whatever it was he was thinking of and want to kiss him again.
Sam manages to fix his fuck up by making it to the puck before anybody else and successfully sending it out of their zone, where Benny picks it up. He passes it to Cas, who shoots quickly, and Dean has enough sense left in him to follow the puck all the way to the net, forcing the goalie to hold onto it and creating another puck drop.
“Guess it’s a good thing he’s in a hospital then, huh?” Benny drawls, appearing beside him.
Gabriel throws the other pillow at him.
Cas is mad at him, he’s pretty sure. That or he’s finally decided he doesn’t want to deal with Dean anymore, which, you know. Dean’s surprised he lasted that long. ‘Course, not like he can tell one way or another, because he’d decided to avoid Cas until things had calmed down a little.
“We don’t want to,” Edlund tells him kindly. “You’re a wonderful addition to our team, Castiel—," Edlund continues to tell Cas about how awesome he’s been all season and how much they’ll need him next year but since Dean’s had his dick up his ass that’s probably not possible. Who knows. Dean isn’t really listening anymore, it’s all background noise to him.
“Awwww, c’mon Cassie. I want to spend time with my ittiest, bittiest brother. Don’t you love me anymore?”
Sam pulls the toothbrush from his mouth. “How the hell should I know? You invited him.”
Dean opens his mouth, closes it. Opens it again, points at his brother. “You have a crush,” he says intelligently.
“I can cook you know,” Cas grumbles. “Your ovens are different here.”
What’s worse is nobody seems to care as much as Dean. Krushnic continues to arrogantly show them all up and to directly point out every single flaw he sees, but it’s like they’ve all become used to it. That or they all lost their hearing. Dean wishes he had the same luxury. Bobby’s constant glaring and the reminder of his threat is the only thing that keeps Dean from speaking up, so he’s taken the opposite route and has avoided talking to Krushnic at all.
“Dude,” Sam says, peering closer, “You’re really drunk, aren’t you? You’re so grumpy you’re almost back at sober.”
“Dean,” he thinks he hears Cas say. “We need to sleep.”
“When I was a kid my mom made me play a lot of sports,” Dean nods. “So, you know. I can touch my toes and all that shit.”
“No,” Dean lies, glancing back at Krissy.
Dean screws up his face. “Gross.”
The silence stretches on.
Cas doesn’t really sleep in his room, ever, but Dean figured it was important to give him his own space. Cas seemed confused by the concept at first, not really surprising since the room Dean had “given” him when he was an angel was only occasionally used to store Cas’ trench coat the few times he took it off, but he caught on quickly enough. Much to Dean’s relief he’d started lining his shelves with interesting looking rocks, books from the bunker library he’d taken a liking to, and a plastic toy Olaf from
“C’mon, Jo,” he prompts. “You already got the hormones going, might as well get me while I’m feeling all warm and fuzzy.”
“Now the receptionist thinks you are.”
This is Jebb's chapter.
Sam shrugs. “I just wanted to say,” he says nonchalantly. “If you do get your head out of your ass and let whatever it is you’re doing with Cas play out, I’m not gonna think of you any differently. Well,” his face screws up and he amends, “I might like you better with a boyfriend. Wouldn’t know yet.”
“Way to make me stand out here for an hour,” Victor says grumpily, though his eyes are cheerful. “You think I got all day to wait for you, Winchester?”
“Listen up, boys!” Rufus barks from the front of the plane, and it’s a credit to him that even Andy manages to stop shouting the lyrics to ‘Pinball Wizard’ to listen. “Pilot says we’re ready to take off. Now we got three hours of being shoved into this tiny space together, so I can tell you right now, if any of you piss me or Bobby off, we’re shipping your ass to Detroit.” The team boos and Rufus waves his hand. “Yeah, yeah. None of you bug us, we don’t want to hear it.” He sits back down next to Bobby and the plane immediately explodes into noise again.
Not to mention at practice he’d found
“Fantastic, isn’t it?” a voice asks from beside him, and Castiel turns to find a woman dressed in a smart black pantsuit with a red blouse. “Tiffany actually put that design together himself!”
“No,” Dean snaps, twisting and pushing Cas away.
Dean though, is looking at him hopefully, with steady eyes and a calm face. Surely Dean, with all his goodness, can counteract anything bad Castiel puts into the chair.
“LAST CHRISTMAS, I GAVE YOU MY HEART, BUT THE VERY NEXT DAY, YOU GAVE IT AWAY.”
books are ridiculously good at symbolism. And the subtext, you would not believe some of the stuff that’s being implied…”
Besides, the result of that little experiment was Pamela losing her fucking eyes. Cas’d always purse his lips when he or Sam stumbled upon that part of their story. “Guy doesn’t even know his own strength,” Dean would joke, and that would make it a little better, comfortable enough for them to mourn their friend in peace.
“No peeking.”
“He always does that when he thinks the game depended on him,” he hears Sam quietly, and he has to be answering a question from Krushnic, because Krushnic’s the only one who doesn’t know, and for some reason that drives Dean fucking insane, because Sam’s penalty was his fault, his inability to get the puck for a shot was his fault,
“Doing what?” Cas asks, eyes fixed intently on the screen. “I still do not understand the point of this game, Dean.”
Dean’s not a stranger to eating women out. It was one of his favorite things to do, once upon a time. To have someone beneath you, falling apart over nothing but the skill of your tongue, to lose it himself over nothing but their enjoyment in him – it was a feedback loop of pleasure that couldn’t really be replicated anywhere else.
Are these drinks
, I guess, it’s like this buzzing,” he wiggles his fingers, “tingly feeling.”
Dean thinks about the old rickety wooden coaster that takes turns so sharp the wheels sometimes lift off the track and immediately says, “No.”
But then Cas slams him into and through a stall door with the giant iconic white “C” painted on it, and Dean can no longer think because there’s a metal bar digging into his hip and a tongue stuck halfway down his throat.
“Pardon-vous,” Gabriel tells him, elbowing away as he leans over the plastic of their seats, inserting his face right between Dean and Cas. “Listen Cassie, this is all you need to know about America – sex, drugs, rock n’ roll.”
“I did, I just hadn’t thought of…I mean objectively…” Castiel can’t put it into words, his sudden realization that Dean
The apocalypse was no picnic either. Sam didn’t like how blasé Dean got about it at the end. “Me or Michael, doesn’t matter so long as the world doesn’t miss out on this face,” he’d grin at Sam, shoving fries in his mouth because what the heck, the world was ending.
“So I’ve heard,” Castiel nods, shifting awkwardly. Where is Dean? “So you’re… Santa.”
Cas is back on his lips, hand fisted in his hair, before he can fully register the taste.
“Uh, Dean?”
“I’m sorry,” Cas speaks up suddenly. Dean pauses and doesn’t turn around. He thought he’d made it through fairly ambivalent, that maybe Cas hadn’t noticed…but then, Cas had shit too. Maybe they both had stories they were pretending not to share with one another.
Usually Gabriel is able to inflict his special brand of humor on Castiel at least once an hour, and that’s with him living halfway across the city. Castiel thinks he should probably be more suspicious that they’ve been working in the same place for two days now and Gabriel hasn’t come to bother him once.
“I swear to God, you have the emotional range of a teaspoon.”
“If I come sit with you, I will never get up, and eventually we’ll be having sex on that couch,” Cas says, squinting at his newspaper.
The message doesn’t really get sent when Cas has the same idea as him though, so now Dean’s just not bothering because if Cas doesn’t want to talk to him, he ain’t trying.
Searing pain shoots through his left shoulder, and sound comes flooding back into his brain just in time for him to hear the loud smack of his own body against the boards.
Sam, jesus.”
“Ha, sure,” Dean agrees. “I’ll take something I’d never admit to anybody for five hundred, Alex.”
Dean stiffens and straightens up, not wanting to turn around. Talking to Krushnic is really the last thing he wants to do right now, but ignoring him with Bobby somewhere in the bar to hear about it isn’t going to end well for him either.
“What about that boy at the hospital?” Cas speaks up.
Dean doesn’t care. He’s not doing it. “Are you trading Cas away next season?”
“Nah,” Dean says confidently. “Everybody loves me. Besides, I’ve seen you staring at me.”
“Crowley had gathered some very compelling evidence that pointed to her as Lucifer’s next—“
kind of fucking way.
“No problem, man,” Dean accepts the offered high five and gives him time to leave, staring at the door to Cas’ room even after he knows the nurse is out of sight.
“You ready, babe?”
“There’s not even a picture,” Sam says with disapproval, setting the paper back down. “Just reports that you were then and then a bunch of shit about what it means.”
“Listen carefully,” Cas tells her, his creepy soul staring gaze for once directed at someone else. “I need some shokoladnaya kalbasa.”
The breakfast bar in his kitchen is strewn with bottles of alcohol, some a lot emptier than others, and he’s busy trying to figure out if he wants to fill his glass with rum again or just go straight for the whiskey when there’s a knock on the door.
It’s almost mid-morning now, a small trickle of tourists here to visit their families beginning to wander into the park in order to look at the massive sculpture against the backdrop of the city. Castiel has always been fond of the bean. He has no idea why, but then again, the sculpture makes no sense either. A giant, reflective bean. People only visit to take warped pictures of themselves in its surface. It’s completely nonsensical. Castiel loves it.
He tries not to think about that kiss and how much he wants to do it again. He definitely stops short of trying to figure out what it means. Sure Cas had said it was a normal thing, and so had Sam but Dean’s not stupid. Cas kissed him.
“I wasn’t planning on being late, Sammy,” Dean says, smiling sheepishly at Castiel. “So, uh, guess you met my Uncle Bobby and my brother Sam. Were they behaving?”
Sam calls Dean back to the nursing home at that point, and Dean leaves Cas at the bunker, feeling off-kilter.
“No,” Cas agrees, watching as the man gets the tree down. Dean goes to help, and soon they’ve got the branches ties up and the tree loaded and secured in the back of the truck. Castiel waits by the two trees he rejected, managing almost to feel slightly bad about not choosing them before the tree farmer interrupts his thoughts. “Your friend’s in the bathroom. Here’s his receipt.”
“Dean sees me as a responsibility,” Castiel tells it in a clipped tone. “The responsibility ends when the burden of my involvement in his life does.”
“Oh,” Cas says blankly, looking half apologetically, half uncomfortably towards Sam. Sam doesn’t notice. He’s got his thinking face on, the one that means he thinks he’s just figured something out that didn’t need fucking figuring out in the first place.
“Hey Cas,” Dean says, eyes dropping to the towel still clenched loosely in his fist. “Not interrupting anything, am I?”
“I’m a very fast learner,” he agrees, and Dean believes it, but that doesn’t mean he has to be happy about it.
“Fine,” Dean says shortly. He can do that. Krushnic didn’t say they had to be nice talks, or even that Dean had to talk at all.
“Oh, yes,” Cas answers. “I took your advice. I thought this name sounded more believable.”
“Didn’t know it was time for my Cosmo subscription to arrive.”
Dean had forgiven him a long time ago, and Sam seems to feel better after he lets it all out.
“Dean, there is nothing different in the physical make-up of this lube as opposed to what we usually use, other than,” he flexes his hand, and the glitter catches the light on Dean’s nightstand and winks at Dean, “it looks extremely pleasing.”
“It’s improbable that so many people could exist in such a small living space,” Cas agrees, stepping back from the door. His eyes scans over Dean and catches on the flowers dangling from his hand. “Are those lilacs?”
“The voice,” Cas repeats, regarding him closely.
Dean ended up at the bar again that night, because he was an adult and he could get drunk if he wanted to. Maybe round two was all he needed to feel shitty enough physically so the mental stuff could finally take a goddamned break.
“Yeah Sammy, how is Jess?”
Stupid
“You’re a good guy,” the driver announces. “Hell of a hawkey playa.”
“Correct,” Cas replies shortly before heading confidently into the house. Dean and Sam follow after some hesitation, sitting on the couch Tracy indicates to them. There’s an armchair across from the couch that she takes a seat in. Cas, weirdly enough, is striding the perimeter of the room, twisting the shades closed until the light is dimmed.
Dean probably should’ve said something to Cas when he finally caught sight of the bottle of lube they had used, white unicorn with a rainbow overhead proudly displayed on the front. If he’d said something, he probably could have saved some face in the John Winchester School of Manliness. But if he’d said something, he also wouldn’t have been able to use it all up in the shower in a week without Cas making a point of it.
“Amateur,” Gabriel snorts. “I get objectified by the guys too.”
Cas lasts maybe two more strokes before he’s coming as well, his body slumping heavily onto Dean’s as Dean continues to kiss him and pushes a hand through his sweaty, messy hair.
Or something.
That doesn’t count, his brain works frantically to reason through the alcohol and the hot press of Tessa against his hand. It doesn’t count, because it was a hockey game, heat of the moment type thing. He’s not Cas, he’s Krushnic.
“That was one time!” Sam protests.
Dean watches them in disbelief. “You were taking bets on this?”
Dean wonders about that too.
Dean doesn’t think Cas has said more than ten words to him. He’s not used to the angel not being constantly over his shoulder, reassuringly in sight. He doesn’t know what to think about it, what to do.
“You asshole,” he mutters. “You get the idea. It was John Winchester. He was a legend.”
“You sure you’d like that?” Sam asks, brandishing a familiar looking small silver tube. “I’m not wearing any Unicorn Spit.”
“Yeah, well, that’s it then, isn’t it?” Sam says bitterly. “He didn’t tell you why we went to live with Bobby though, did he?”
“I got it,” Dean says loudly, shoving his hand roughly into his pocket and pulling his phone out. Sam gives him a look, but he ignores it as he stands up and jabs at the screen. “What is it?”
“All the time, or only at Christmas time?” Castiel asks, and alright, that was intentionally rude.
“I do like it,” he whispers into his ear, his breath brushing across skin once again and causing Castiel to shiver. Dean takes a healthy step back and cocks an eyebrow at him. “You’re right, we do need hot chocolate.”
“So I’ve heard,” Bobby parrots. “Not too hard. I get to sit all day. Kids bring me cookies.”
“Dean,” Cas repeats again, leaning closer, and suddenly Dean is hit with the smell of Cas, and the ache throbs with something different this time, excitement, and he must look like a wide eyed idiot. “I wanted to apologize.”
Only problem with this arrangement is, Dean doesn’t like dogs. Sam keeps encouraging him to name the damn thing and take it on walks. Dean refused, but he’s occasionally slipped up and called it Chekov, because saying, “get off the couch you stupid mutt,” got old real fast.
Dean frowns, because the words sound different, somehow. They sound heavier, careful, like they’re dragging Cas down, maybe, and he continues to frown until he realizes how fucking insane his own brain sounds and he shakes his head. “So, uh,” he says, trying to gather his thoughts, figure out how to say what he wants to say, “everything alright?”
So yeah. Kissing photos. Pretty bad when you were a guy deep in the closet, but Dean was currently finding his way out of Narnia.. He’d managed to get through it, and the distraction of the cup finals had helped a lot. He’d had it backwards, when he’d been arguing with Cas – the media didn’t distract from the finals, the finals had distracted from the media.
“Your fake FBI education?” Dean asks, cracking a small smile. “Uh, I’m not sure man, Sam and I kind of just copy what we see on procedural cop shows, things like that. It’s not like civilians have a lot of experience with the police, they only know what books and TV tell ‘em.”
“My mouth is usually kind of full,” Dean answers truthfully.
“That why you’re here?” Dean asks, raising an eyebrow. “I promise sweetheart, I could never be mad at you.”
“Six,” Dean says quickly. Cas looks disgruntles, so he adds, “Add a Jack and Coke and a White Russian, will ya?” he quickly pulls out his card and hands it over. Might as well start a tab.
“Castiel. Trust you to still be asleep at this hour,” Naomi Novak’s cool voice floats over the line, causing Castiel to instinctively squeeze his eyes shut tighter, like that could block out the sound somehow. Blearily blinking them open, he manages to find the red digital numbers of his clock flashing up at him from the floor. It reads 7:30.
Now Dean’s beyond confused. And fuck Victor for handing his number out. “Thank me?”
Dean thinks he’s going to die with Cas touching his face. And he thinks that might be okay. But Cas heals him instead, a caress that is somehow aggressive, fierce.
“What?” Dean sighs and pulls his skates off.
“No,” Cas says with a weird look on his face. “Why would I mind?”
Dean doesn’t talk on the bench after that, and Sam knows not to try, instead sitting next to him in companionable silence. On his other side, Cas is leaning forward intently, elbows on his knees, and every time the puck gets too close, his finger twitches, like he’s itching to go after it. Dean works to actively ignore him after he catches himself with a smile on his face one too many times.
“Aye, aye, Captain,” Balthazar mutters under his breath, but the room quiets down again.
Carver doesn’t look like anyone special. Brown hair, brown eyes, glasses. Kind of short. You’d never guess he was a multimillionare and the owner of one of the best hockey teams in the NHL. Edlund is almost exactly the opposite, with his long gray hair and lanky body. They make an interesting looking pair, with Carver seated in Bobby’s chair and Edlund standing beside him.
“Dean?” Sam sounds alarmed. “Dean, what happened?”
“You excited for your first hotdog?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yeah,” he says, shooting to his feet, and the nurse, who made it to them pretty quickly after calling his name, replies. “You can see Mr. Krushnic now. He’s been asking for you.”
“Where were you?” he murmurs lowly, turning his head again and bumping Dean’s nose with his cheek. Stubble rasps along his face and his grip involuntarily tightens again.
“What, the very generous offer of an interview for a job I’m sure involves sorting mail or getting coffee?” Castiel asks. “Yes, thank you Michael, but I’ll pass. Even if I wanted to accept your offer, I have my own job.”
Dean feels his eyebrows jump incredulously. “Dandruff?”
Dean won’t talk. He refuses. If he opens his mouth he’ll ruin it. But Cas is slowly driving him insane. Their hotel rooms seemed filled with sexual tension now, Dean unable to relax as Cas goes about his nightly routines around him, brushes against him, smiles at him. He feels like a spring wound tight, feels only slightly better after games where he’s able to slam around and skate fast, escaping everything before it all comes crashing down on him once again.
He doesn’t have any of his other gear out here, only the stick he’d been wrapping and a puck he finds stuffed at the bottom of the duffle, but he doesn’t fucking care. When his skates are on, he heads out onto the ice in his jeans and Henley, handling the puck back and forth in tight, angry movements.
It’s hard to get back to the car, with him and Cas kissing all the way there. Cas has got him pressed up against the impala, stubble scraping along his exposed neck, when Dean suddenly has a thought. “Shit. We gotta grow playoff beards.”
) and giving Charlie a strained smile. “Thanks for showing up. You seen Sammy?”
“Hey, your bags missin’?” Dean asks, sounding surprised. “Ours are too. Hey Cas,” he cranes his head back and catches sight of Cas’ bare chest once again. It’s a fucking good chest too, and Dean wonders if Cas had to work for any of that definition or if it just comes naturally.
“Yeah, and you’re a Sox fan,” Dean makes a face.
Cas seems to be considering the question very seriously, and in the meantime Gabriel pushes him another shot. “I like freckles,” he says finally.
So Dean flips on the safety and drops the gun, and does what he wishes he’d been strong enough to keep doing in Hell.
Dean seems to need no clarification, since he just shrugs and says, “Nah. I’m still working on you, aren’t I?”
Like those women who are always going on about how they experimented in college. If they’re allowed, why shouldn’t he be? Doing it once will probably get whatever the fuck this is out of his system, right? And then he can comfort himself with the fact that no, he’s not even a
Doesn’t matter how good at hockey you are though, if you don’t click with the rest of the team, it’s not gonna work, and Dean can’t see Krushnic allowing anybody to click with him. He hadn’t spoken the rest of practice.
Bobby’s got land in Wisconsin, an old farm house with a giant yard that’s at least a two hour drive from Chicago. Weirdly enough, Sammy opts out of driving up with them in the Impala, mumbling something about letting Dean have his time with Cas before hanging up the phone. Dean’s suspicious, because what the hell, but Sam’s acting way too weird for this to actually be about him and Cas, so Dean figures he’s probably bringing Jess up and thinks this is gonna be a surprise to anybody.
“I want to come in with you,” Cas answers immediately, and Dean didn’t really expect anything less. He’s not happy about letting Cas torture himself, but he’s sure as shit not going to tell the guy what he can and can’t do.
Gabriel’s getting into net, and the kid is following with Benny, so Dean guesses they’re doing some kind of pass and shoot drill. He’s still hanging back on the far end of the ice, reluctant to head over when he can see number 18 hovering around number 2, when he catches sight of a girl climbing over the bleachers behind him.
“Dude, you wanna get better at all this American crap, you better start talking,” Dean informs him.
“Besides which, what five year olds are you speaking to that enjoy drawing penises?” Balthazar asks with interest.
They manage to clean up a few minutes later, and when they collapse back into bed Cas drags Dean to his chest like it’s the most natural thing in the world.
He leads him to the elevator, something Castiel has never been in since the escalator is much quicker. Dean seems determined to wait though, tapping his foot until the door dings and open, customers spilling out. Dean rushes in before everyone else who is waiting, turning abruptly. “Can you guys take the next one?” he asks. “I just need this for a second.”
They send St. Louis packing with a score of three to nothing.
They’ve opened the doors to the store and are already letting the first hundred people in, shuffling them through the long line of players and letting them talk excitedly to each one. Ash is already sitting cross legged and barefooted on top of his table, and Dean decides he doesn’t care, even if he is the one that’ll get shit for it.
“You say all that like it’s a bad thing.”
This corner of the store, miraculously, seems unpopular at the moment, and he takes a deep breath, leaning his head against the wall. If it weren’t for his unfortunate unemployment, he’d never in a million years have taken this job. Come to think of it, if it weren’t for Gabriel insisting Castiel come work with him, he never even would have considered Macy’s.
“Team meeting,” Bobby grimaces, like the words leave a bad taste in his mouth. “We need one. Call it.”
Dean picks up the plate and heads back to the couch, nudging none too gently at Cas’ legs. “Move over,” he says roughly, his throat still scratchy from disuse.
Dean stares at his brother. “How the hell do you know that?”
“Are you alright?” Krushnic questions.
“Yes,” Cas says softly. “I could see souls. More than the physical aspects of a person, sometimes. They were like light, but the absence of light as well. They were bright and…” he purses his lips, “they sparkled.”
“I got no idea,” Dean shakes his head and looks at the mug jealously. “Bobby just told me to get you all here at nine.”
of dirty hotdog water and chomping down on a bun soaked through by the Bud Light of the guy behind you who’d jumped up to scream at the ump when he notices the two girls who had gotten in line behind him out of the corner of his eye. They’re fidgeting and whispering, eying his and Cas’ clasped hands. One of them seems more adamant than the other and keeps elbowing the girl at her side as punctuation to her whispers.
“Break,” she says.
“Dean,” Cas nudges him, a note of panic in his voice. “Dean, I think one of those baseballs is coming towards us.”
“Thank god you’re here, man. I could really use the help.”
“What?” Dean snaps back. “Hey Cas, Sam’s bag’s missing, isn’t that weird? ‘Cause ours are too?”
The truth his fucked-up mind is trying to hide from him is more painful. Cas just didn’t want to go with him.
The table they’re sitting at isn’t too big, and Dean’s leaning forward has caused him to come almost face to face with Castiel. With Dean so close, Castiel is violently reminded of the kiss he had given him yesterday. It had been chaste and quick, not at all what he had expected from Dean, and he’d spent a lot of time last night wondering why. From the three seconds their lips had been pressed together, he could have sworn he felt something, and he desperately wants to try it again, for longer this time, to see if his memory was correct.
“You coming?” Dean asks Chekov, but the dog just stares at him, so he shrugs and heads off into his bedroom.
He sighs and pulls back, looking so much like a petulant child that Dean laughs.
“You hate Christmas almost as much as I do,” Castiel feels the need to point out.
Cas squints at Gabriel. “Dean can have sex whenever he asks.”
“No they’re not,” Cas says blankly, focusing on him. Great, now he’s got Sam’s fucking book open. That thing needed to go back to his brother, no other book had ever given Dean weird and completely fictional, never gonna happen wet dreams like that.
Sam is frowning at his plate with a concentrated look on his face as he chews, and maybe it’s only a few seconds, but to Dean the silence stretches on for hours. “You gonna say something?”
He’s definitely never done that before.
“Sure, we’ll go get lunch, and on the way you can tell me about your new strapping young suitor,” Gabriel agrees, pulling Castiel towards the door. “We’re gonna have to play up your looks with pretty dresses, Cas. You don’t have much of a dowry to offer.”
It’s four on four now, with thirty seconds left in the game. Cas hasn’t gotten off the ice, which means Bobby thinks he’s good or he doesn’t and Cas is ignoring Bobby anyway. Benny’s taking the face off since Dean can’t, and someone must’ve sacrificed a goat or something to the fucking Hockey Gods, because he wins it. Sam gets it and passes it to Chuck, who gets it back to Benny who skates it around behind the net. Dean’s gotten to his feet without noticing, swearing as Benny almost loses it before regaining control, and Cas is at center ice…Dean thinks he’s out of the penalty box before the goal horn even blares, but then it does and the stadium is erupting into cheers so loud Dean can’t even hear himself screaming at Cas as he tackles him, arm tight around his neck and visor pressed closed to his.
“Are you two looking into vouyerism already?” Balthazar leers. Surprisingly it’s Gabriel who throws a pillow at him.
Maybe Cas doesn’t feel all that strongly about it.
“I remember that game,” Jo grins delightedly. “You were bleeding all over the ice.”
Dean’s loud laughter cuts him off, and Cas gets a very irritated scowl on his face before stomping off into the kitchen.
“We’re not dating,” Dean repeats, teeth clenched. “We’re just…Cas n’me…,” he sighs, running a hand over his face. “We’ve done stuff,” he says hesitantly. “And I’m allowed to kiss him whenever I want, I guess. But that’s it.”
“Asshole,” Dean says, pushing him off the side of the bleachers. Gabriel lands with a loud “oomph,” scowling at Balthazar and Ash, who are both grinning down at him.
“I’m tryin’!”
“That’s the spirit!” Gabriel laughs, clapping Cas on the back. “First the midnight kiss, then a New Years’ bang, Cassie. What’re ya looking for?” he pushes a shot towards Castiel. “Drink this.”
Dean’s head jerks up and he glares at Jo, because Jo is a horrible cock blocking, person. Actually another surrogate sibling he never wanted. “Since when are you callin’ me babe?”
“Even you haven’t had my ass,” Dean points out. “Why the fuck would that bother you?” He pauses to take stock for a moment before grinning brightly. “Oh my god, are you jealous?”
“My dick is flattered,” he grins, but when he opens his eyes to wink, Cas is staring at his face with a look Dean doesn’t really have the capacity to identify on his own.
Ah. Cas’ shoulder. Whatever.
“Merry Christmas Charlie, Joanna Beth.”
Good luck with that.
“Yeah?” Dean asks with barely concealed interest. “What about dating me?”
Dean closes his eyes as Cas leans over him to get at the nightstand, his newly gun-calloused palm running up Dean’s thigh and his dick dragging across his stomach.  “Fuck, Cas,” he bites out, and he can practically hear Cas’ smirk as the small sound of a cap snapping open echoes through the room. “Gonna stretch me open? Gonna get me nice and wet and open for you?”
Sam gives him an exasperated look. “Did you not wonder where I was at all last night?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean shoots him a look and grabs the remote, turning the volume up on the TV. What a load of crap. He could totally be a better person than Krushnic. Sam was gonna eat his friggin’ words.
It’s almost like the beginning of the season again, when Dean and Cas couldn’t make a connecting pass to save their lives. Dean knows Bobby’s ready to tear what little hair he has left on his head out, and he’d probably be feeling that way too if he weren’t so numb. The Scorpions score pretty easily in the first period, and the only reason they don’t score more is due to Gabriel.
Carver bites his lip and reaches under the desk. “There’s also the problem of this,” he explains, throwing a brightly colored magazine on top of it.
Gabriel grabs it from Victor before Zeke can, then sticks his tongue out at him because Gabriel is still five. “Next time you mess with my goaltending, I’ll mess with your face,” he says completely cheerfully, wiggling his fingers in a goodbye to Dean before sauntering away, whistling. Zeke shoots Victor an incredibly exasperated look before heading in the opposite direction.
“It moves,” Cas tells him, like he’s still trying to sell it. “It is very common in Russia. Many people like them.”
“I don’t care,” it hisses.
“I think I do want a hotdog,” Cas nods, and when Dean tries to drop his hand, Cas doesn’t let him.
“We’ll figure it out,” Carver says. “For now, just focus on bringing Stanley home, you got it?” he grins at the pair of them like he hasn’t just ripped Dean’s heart out of his chest and stomped on it.
Cas is beating him five shots to three when Dean decides he’s had enough of this shit. Cameras are here, so Bobby can’t get too mad, and they’re supposed to be having fun, right?
“I’m not upset with you,” Castiel says quietly. “I’m sorry I snapped. I…” he pauses. “I would enjoy picking a tree out with you, I think.”
The words drop like stones to the floor, heavy with the weight of the truth behind them. It’s been a long established pattern that anyone he holds close – Bobby, Charlie, Benny – will die because of him, because of his constant fucking up. If he really cared about Cas he’d let him go without any argument, would even be relieved that Cas had finally come to his senses. Except Dean has always been a selfish bastard, and somewhere along the way he’d stopped trying to push Cas away, had started pulling him in even closer.
They’ve barely sat down before Dean’s babbling, words tripping over his tongue as all the shit that’s been piling up with Cas since November comes spilling out without his permission. He tells Sam about how weird he feels whenever Cas is around, and how when he fucks around with him it feels more vivid and electric than it does when he fucks around with the other guys. He tells Sam about how protective he gets when Cas is threatened, possessive in a way he doesn’t understand, how he can’t stop thinking of Cas in the fucking clothes Dean can’t seem to stop giving him. He stops short of telling Sam about the jerk off session he had imagining Cas blowing him, or the countless ones since, because some shit your brother does not need to know unless the opportunity to mentally scar him appears. “- and then I figured maybe I should have sex with him, because I’m
That snaps Cas out of wherever he was, and then he’s helping Dean lift himself up and slam back down, until they’ve got a good rhythm going. Dean’s desperately trying to find that place Cas got with his fingers before, chasing his orgasm, muttering, “Cas, Cas, faster Cas, you can do it,” as Cas says a couple of words in Russian that Dean doesn’t understand. Then Cas lifts him up again, and this time when Dean comes back down he feels a jolt, like an electrical current, running through his body, and he thinks he yells, “fucking
“There’s no picture because I wasn’t there,” Dean snaps. “I’m not a fucking idiot. If I had the urge to pick up a dude I wouldn’t go
Dean doesn’t answer right away, and when Castiel turns around from hanging his coat he sees why. Dean’s attention is caught by the tree in the corner, with his lone wooden carved angel on top.
“Of course!” Jess says brightly. “I never knew hockey was so much fun.”
Cas is forming a small shit eating grin before Dean can even think to take it back. “I can assure you, Dean,” he says, and Dean swears his voice is getting deeper as his accent grows more prominent, “As long as I am distracted I cannot do so well.”
Benny’s holding back at least two guys at once, using that intimidating tough guy look Dean always got weirdly excited to see on one while he holds back another, delivering the occasional punch. And Cas…
“Well maybe I’ve been doing a shitty job, so good thing Sammy with his big brain and Gabe and Balthazar with…well, whatever, good thing they’re here to help.”
They don’t talk about it being game seven. They don’t talk about how, if they win this one, they’re going to the finals. They can’t talk like that. Dean likes to think he’s not annoyingly superstitious, but this. This is important.
Dean barely has time to register what she said before Hannah is clearing her throat disapprovingly. “You spent way too much time with them,” she admonishes Dean. “That was totally unacceptable. Look at the line!”
“I’m gonna use his face to write my name on the boards is what I’m gonna do,” Dean mutters, throwing his arm around Cas’ shoulder. Cas leans into him minutely and Dean grins. “Whaddya want for dinner?”
He hadn’t slept well last night, his sleep hampered by troubling dreams filled with feelings of loneliness and unhappiness. He felt empty, like there was something he desperately wanted. He just had no idea what the hell it was.
“You can come around this side of the table,” Cas says suddenly.
He opens the lube bottle and squirts some over his fingers. “Are you gonna help, or am I going to have to do it by myself?”
Bobby and Rufus, as per usual along with the rest of the management team, have gone off to their own table, and left them at what Rufus calls the kiddie seats.
There are two minutes left in the second period when Alastair manages to get the puck around Chuck and within shooting distance. He lobs a shot that Gabriel catches under his pad easily, and Dean expecting the whistle, heads towards the dot. Instead, three Scorpions players rush Gabriel and begin hacking away it him with their sticks, forcing Benny and Dean to shoulder their way in with their sticks as well. Somehow the puck spurts out into the back of the net, and the stadium erupts into cheers as the goal horn goes off.
“C’mon man,” he protests half-heartedly, ignoring the stupid jump his heart makes. Maybe Cas has noticed they haven’t been doing much together lately.
“In short our pal is—“ Dean elbows him in the stomach, which probably hurts him more than it hurts Gabriel, but Gabriel gives a loud ‘oof’ and shuts up anyway, so goal achieved.
It’s not totally unusual for no one to have heard about a replacement by now. Victor had been traded for future draft picks, so at least Dean could comfort himself with the fact that he was traded because they needed the money, and not because there was someone better out there they wanted. It’s possible Edlund hadn’t even found anyone yet, although he and Carver, the owner of the team, spend so much time together Dean kind of doubts they haven’t been talking about it. Victor was a first line winger, that’s not exactly something you can go without if you want to make playoffs. Which also makes it an important decision – you want to find someone good, someone who will fit with the team and who has the experience to come in and play with a group of guys that have been together for years and have never missed the playoffs.
Two keychains are fifteen dollars. Dean buys them without a second thought, shoving one at Cas. “This doesn’t seem…cool,” Cas says, like he’s not totally sure he’s using the word correctly.
Dean responds by licking into Cas’ mouth, because why the hell not at this point, and Cas makes a noise deep in his chest again, the vibrations running through Dean’s body. Cas tastes like cold open air, and when Dean clenches tighter at his coat and tries to draw him closer so he can taste more, Cas nips at his lip.
Dean leans forward until he’s hanging almost completely over the counter, toning the smile down so it’s softer. “I get you’re doing your job,” he says, “and you’re doing awesome, you really are. But it’s our one year anniversary and we’d really like to get back upstairs, you know?”
“Me?” Dean asks, wondering what the hell he did. “Kind of not looking my best here, Bobby,” he says, gesturing. His hair is damp with sweat and he’s pretty sure he smells.
When Jo continues to not say something, he begins to grow suspicious. Jo’s not annoyingly chatty like some women he’s known, but she’s never passed up the opportunity to be nosy or pushy, and ignoring a situation in which she could be both is more than a little strange to him. For a second, he’s able to pull his head away from his own problems. “What’s up with you?”
“Did I hear correctly?” he asks with interest. “Are we finally going to learn about dear Cassie’s sex life?”
. But it has been trapped here again for what feels like centuries, and there are only so many creatures it can kill for the sport of it. The buzzing, raw electricity of the angel’s grace had called to it the moment the pair had stepped through the rift – riling him up should at least be fun.
“What the fuck is this, an all star party in the hallway?”
Dean hears Krushnic make a small noise in his throat and glances at him. He looks almost happy. “I could have guessed all of those,” he says proudly, his voice quieter now that he’s standing shoulder to shoulder with Dean.
“Really?” Sam asks skeptically. “It’s only a couple of weeks.”
The last home game of the week is tomorrow, Saturday night, and they actually manage to get all the laundry done at a reasonable time. Despite their awkward as fuck feelings moment, he’s ready to invite Cas up to his apartment to watch TV or something, but the guy’s shaking his head almost as soon as he brings it up. “I need to sleep sometime tonight Dean, and you prove to be distracting.”
“What if you were some kind of bad guy?” he asks Emmanuel, driving once again through the pitch black, Cas at his shoulder.
Dean meets Michael at the center of the ice for faceoff, making sure not to spend too much time looking at the guy. Michael’s got this weird charismatic way about him that can distract you if you’re not careful. It’s no coincidence that Dean’s faceoff stats are worse when playing the Scorpions than against any other team.
“-brought along his teammates, Sam Winchester and Castiel Krushnic!”
They get a couple more invitations to follow everyone to the Roadhouse, and while Dean really wants to go with them and catch a moment with Charlie and Jo, Cas clearly has something planned, and Dean doesn’t want to ruin that.
It’s easy to make a deal with Billie.
He’s cut off as Bobby drops the puck and Cas swipes it quickly behind him to Sam without looking away from Dean. “One hundred percent,” he says calmly.
Sam comes over to watch college basketball one night and Dean pretends his brother isn’t paying more attention to him than the game. When Cas pads out of his bedroom, barefooted and hair ruffled, to plop down next to Dean and steal his beer, Dean pretends Sam doesn’t raise his eyebrow. But when Cas heads back into his room, exasperated because every time he asks why a foul is called Dean answers, “Sexual misconduct,” Dean doesn’t ignore Sam’s snort.
“Give you what?” he murmurs against his lips. “Use your words, Dean.”
“You’re thinking this is your fault,” Lucifer murmurs. “You’re right. If only you’d told Castiel how you feel, he wouldn’t have felt the need to pull this self-sacrificing bullshit.” The devil sighs dramatically. “But he learned from the best, didn’t he? Or the worst. Poor Castiel. He can’t seem to look at his memories of you quite like I can. Guess that makes me special.”
“Didn’t know people in Lebanon even used lube,” Dean joked, desperately trying to make this conversation anything near comfortable. Then what Angela actually said registers, and he pauses. “Wait, it’s almost Valentine’s Day?”
Dean gently grabs Cas’ elbow to lead him away, allowing Castiel to wave goodbye to Missouri before he turns to follow Dean. “I think I see now.”
“Sam Winchester is the next Wayne Gretzky and the Stanley Cup should be named after him,” Dean says loudly, scowling.
So now they’re losing and Gabriel’s pissed off enough to be throwing sticks.
“Straight to the point, aren’t ya?” The man, surprisingly, laughs. “Name’s Benny. And you’re Castiel, ain’t ya?”
“I know, I know,” he says, shoving his own jersey up so his cock is free as well. He spits quickly into his hand, and Cas pulls him closer by the hip as Dean takes both their cocks in his hand, grinding his hips in an effort to get closer to Cas. “Fuck,” he swears as they slide together, and Cas makes a noise of agreement before he begins kissing Dean again. Dean tries to concentrate on the kissing, but there’s too much going on, their dicks sliding together as that familiar warm feeling builds low in his belly and he moves faster to create more friction.
“Anybody tells on Sam, I’ll cut off his balls,” Dean warns, just in time for Kate to arrive and hand over his beer. “Besides, the girls are cool. We all get to be buddies and as long as no one narcs and there isn’t a huge sex scandal, the league isn’t bothered. So no knocking up Hannah or anything, got it?”
Dean barely had time to glance down, to comprehend that the hand is there, before he’s yanked himself away, the gun that’s always tucked into his waistband out and pointing steadily at Cas’ heart. Because this was wrong. Because Cas hadn’t touched the right shoulder.
“Dean!” Bobby barks. “Take a fucking walk!”
He can’t forgive Cas for dying.
Castiel hears the metal legs of the chair next to him scraping along the tile floor, and finally he can’t help but turn his head.
He tells himself it’s not a big deal. He’s not totally sure when he became such a crappy liar.
Dean falls on top of his comforter and attempts to go back to sleep, jeans be damned.
He likes the kissing. He really does. But he wants to touch more of Cas, something that for some reason isn’t on the table.
Dean looks up at them. The dried tears feel disgusting on his face. But they’re still coming. There’s a hole in his heart that he cannot process, cool and numb at the edges.
Bobby snorts out a laugh and starts the engine. “You think I’m going to Six Flags with you?”
“Dunno, he just seemed weird when he told me about it. I didn’t get any details.”
“Cas,” Dean says quietly into his neck. “I want you to fuck me.”
Castiel looks at the trees. Life has taught him to be a diplomat out of necessity. He’s not really sure what Dean wants from him. “That one?” he says, pointing.
“Yeah, I do,” he says, scratching behind Chekov’s ears when he jumped up on his legs again. The universe has to be conspiring against him. Dean’s never gotten this lucky with a chick he was into, yet here Krushnic is, turning up wherever Dean happens to be when Dean definitely doesn’t want him here. He’s about to tell Krushnic he’ll see him around and then do his best never to run into him again, when he remembers what Sam had said last night.
“A show tree.”
“You’re really going to ask Fangface if he has a
It’s over in a second. Dean’s hand slips, and Cas disappears into the giant, gaping maw of
Benny raises an eyebrow and rubs his scruff in response. Dean does pretty much the same thing (hey, it’s November, his cheeks are getting cold) and Sam, who probably couldn’t grow a good beard to save his life, makes a face.
“Chekov is Sam’s dog anyway, so the thing’s lucky. If Lisa didn’t take him it’d be all Sammy’s problem.”
Cas smiles slightly at him. “Yes, you were.”
Dean knows Jo is acting weird, way outside the range of having an off day. If he were a good friend, a good person even, he’d try to figure it out, but Dean’s a fuck up who can’t even figure out his own problems, and he’s never understood how he’s kept the friends he does have, so he grabs the whiskey bottle and fills his glass again.
“I’m not doing anything different with my face, Dean.”
Dean skates it in, intending to go for Gabriel’s glove side, low. All he has to do is shoot, and pointedly
“Hello Mr. Winchester, Mr. Krushnic,” a female voice says, causing Dean to jump and shove the hand that had been about to reach for Cas to the back of his neck. A dark haired woman in a professional suit-type outfit is standing in front of them, looking expectant as she takes them in. “I’m Hannah. I’ll be your handler today.”
“Yeah, Dean,” he hears Sam say, and Dean feels like they’re speaking to each other from opposite ends of a tunnel.
She never ends with a goodbye.
“Yeah, which is why you’re so worked up about me teasing you, Mr. Stoic,” Gabriel snorts. “Man, can I hang out with you all the time? I might die of happiness if I get to witness your constipated look in the face of his ‘Christmas is great’ jerk off sessions.”
Dean knows the door isn’t going to hold back the Empty, that it’s just toying with them now, so all he can do is stand there, gun drawn, and wait for the inevitable dam to burst.
So rather than do any of that, or think about Cas, he’s ripping a vintage ‘65 Mustang apart.
When they get home Dean makes them frozen pizza they eat on the couch, and Cas goes to sleep at nine because he’s an old man and Dean’s suggestion that he get less than eight hours of sleep for once makes his face go all funny and pinched.
“We’re going into the second round of the playoffs, Dean –“
The girl shoots him a suspicious look. “Why are you sitting with me?”
“It’s yours,” Cas informs him dryly.
“Hey, you’re Castiel Krushnic.”
“Well why should we?” Dean says. “All the people I care about know. What fucking right does the media have?”
Krushnic climbs into the roller coaster and pulls the harness down. Dean follows without really thinking about it. “If he’s a billionaire, why does he have to be a superhero?”
“You Americans have strange expressions,” Cas observes, taking a sip of his beer and making a horrified face. Dean grins at him and is so amused he realizes too late Cas is changing the subject before he can ask why the question about Lisa, of all things. “Earlier Sam said your father was often three sheets to the wind, and that makes no sense to me.”
The talk quickly turns to hockey, because Krissy insists, and she makes him promise to say boobs on camera if they win the next round of the playoffs, which Dean might have tried in his earlier years if he wasn’t so certain Bobby’d have tanned his hide and sent him off to the Carolinas. He offers up tickets to a game again too, which Krissy accepts on Aiden’s behalf, even if she’s not sure she’ll be able to go herself.
Sometimes Dean makes a decision he almost immediately regrets.
“And the team,” Dean emphasizes. “They’re all my family, and I don’t want you hurting them.”
Fucking embarrassing as hell. The guy’s asleep on him. Dean would push him off, except he doesn’t want to bring attention to it, to Krushnic or anybody else. He’d get shit until the end of time, and Dean doesn’t need this ending up in a gossip mag if Gordon catches wind of it either. He’s also not really eager to hear the kind of taunts the rest of the guys will come up with, or to see whatever look Sam chooses to give him.
Cas makes some kind of weird noise next to Dean that has both of them turning to look at him, but the weirdo just stares back like he has no idea what they’re doing.
"See ya tomorrow, Cas."
“When your brother came to us a few months ago about the issues Gordon was causing on the team and in the media, we agreed it was best to send him somewhere else,” Carver explains, looking at Dean. “We did give him a chance to meet with us, especially since Edlund was the one dealing with his trade. Gordon brought the possibility to our attention.”
“Yeah, you wish I cared that much.” Victor rubs at his chin and regards Dean thoughtfully, so much so that Dean finds it difficult not to squirm. Victor couldn’t read him like Sam, and he didn’t hit straight at the core of Dean’s shit like Benny did, but he was always good at sniffing out the stuff he did want to know. “So. Guess this Castiel Krushnic character isn’t so bad after all.”
“Oh, yeah,” Dean thrusts them at Cas and moves inside, closing the door behind him. “They’re for you,” he adds.
No one’s ever done anything like that for Dean before.
“They were actually questioning him about those,” Sam continues. “But they found drugs in his system.”
Dean licks into her mouth, tearing his hand away from her nipple to move his way back down to the front of her panties, stroking his fingers against the fabric before pushing it to the side to feel how wet she is for him. Her legs part, and his hand cups her, his fingers brushing against her clit as the blonde tries to unzip his fly so she can reach inside and stroke him.
He hears a filthy pop as Cas pulls completely off his cock, and Dean swears he doesn’t whine when cool air hits his exposed skin. “Dean,” Cas growls, hint of accent stronger than it’s been in months, “Stop screwing around and fuck my mouth.”
Cas is quietly amused, and then Bobby isn’t dead anymore, and the distraction of explaining what happened while he was out, convincing him that Dean’ll be just fine and sending him on his way makes it easy to ignore the fact that the hollowness in his chest is eating him alive.
“Good flight?” Sam asks with concern. “I was hoping you’d fallen asleep, you didn’t say anything when I told you we were leaving.”
Cas shrugs and tosses the silver Sharpie (probably not too hard to find with the amount Gabriel has stashed around here) aside. “I like Sam’s books. And,” he adds. “You haven’t been scoring as much lately. Perhaps you need a guardian.”
Again, this is extremely unedited. You have been warned.
“What do you want?” Dean demands, but he’s thrown against the wall before he can say much else, his head snapping back against the wall.
“Is something wrong?” Cas asks, finally tearing his gaze away from the riveting mascot race taking place on the field.
Baseball fucking sucks. And Dean’s not just saying that because he’s a Cubs fan.
“Dean, no,” Cas sounds pained. “Of course I do. But you can’t. I can’t know, not for sure.”
Dean scores his first goal of the season, a slap shot high and to the glove side, and Cas is the first one on top of him after he does his victory fist pump, arm wrapped tightly and briefly around his shoulder before he gets out of the way for Sam to tackle him. Dean wishes he could ask what Cas thought of that goal, but Balthazar is waiting for him to get off the ice so the line can change, and he does.
Cas’ breath hitches, the only indication he gives of not being totally calm. “Are you offering?” he asks roughly.
“Yearning?”
“See, I don’t think you do,” the guy says, his eyes narrowing. “I think you can find somewhere else to practice your filthy gay flirting.”
He hears the front door open and watches Cas come into the apartment with his stupid trench coat on. Hair all ruffled from the wind Chicago starts kicking up in March. “Hey, Cas!” he says, throwing his arms wide. The magazine goes flying. Luckily the bottle of burbon does not.
told me about that. Not my fault.”
With Cas, it’d be easy. A brush of the arm, an easy smile, a “hey, want to get out of here?” spoken lowly enough so only Cas would hear.
Kelly becomes Cas’ responsibility when Dean and Sam get arrested by the FBI, which is a speedbump more than anything else. Dean sleeps better than he has in weeks, knowing that Cas is looking for them, but starts getting anxious the more time passes.
Cas frowns at the thing like it’s personally offended him. “I’ll go inform the front desk.”
Sam glances at his brother, smiling. “Don’t call it that, Dean might get upset.”
Gabriel chokes on the Cracker Jacks he’d swiped from the box shoved in between Dean’s seat and the one next to him. “Tell us more, Cassie.”
“So what do you want to do?” Kevin looks excited, and Dean’s not really sure why the kid didn’t head for the roller coaster with everyone else.
“That Dark Knight Rises ride looks cool,” Kevin says hopefully.
Dean had wanted to say.
“I saw her.”
He slams the puck at the net so hard the rebound comes bouncing back. Gathering it, he skates around the back of the net and back to center ice.
Cas tells him about the Rit Zien, some kind of freaky angel that vaporizes you if you so much as get a papercut. “To them, pain is pain,” Cas explains, always ready to explain his weird family’s murderous tendencies. Dean thinks it can’t be too long until the damn thing comes after him, so maybe it’s a good time to ditch Cas.
Dean feels Cas physically start under his arm and he clenches it around his neck, continuing to pull Cas with him. “Leave it,” he barks. He’s probably not too gentle. Now that the initial adrenaline from the fight has worn off, his head is really aching, and he finds himself pissed beyond belief at Cas.
“Thank you Chuck,” Cas said, because he’s the polite one in the relationship, and steers Dean away.
Bobby loved hockey arguably as much, if not more, than John, the only difference being that he’d realized when it was time to hang up his skates. He just hadn’t hung them up permanently. Every year when it’d gotten cold enough for the pound to freeze over, Bobby would be out on the ice, painting the blue lines and the face off dots. And when Dean was young and Sam was still young enough to be in peewee, he’d tromp outside while Dean was shooting at the make-shift net they’d made out of scrap pieces of plywood and fishing net, put on his skates, and insist that Dean join him in, “playing the damn game for fun, boy. Your daddy ain’t watching.”
“One of those European things, yeah,” Dean says as evenly as possible. “For the New Year, I guess.” He looks up and eyes his brother. “Don’t get any stupid ideas, Sam. You just said it was normal.”
