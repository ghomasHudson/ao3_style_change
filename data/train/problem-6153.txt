“That’s alright, I can fill it in right now,” Peter says, continuing his quick scrambling on the paper. After that he gives it to Tony and starts standing up. In his haste, his bag tips over, and a big brown envelope falls out of it, right in front of Tony’s feet. A few papers slid out of it in the fall.
Peter tries to smile as well, just so he’s not too much of an ass against his good friend. “Sounds great,” he says to him. “Oh, and Felicia wanted to hang out with us again, soon.”
“I need to do this,” he says. He pulls out of May’s arms and smiles at her. Then he leans forward, kissing her on the cheek. “I love you, May.”
After they hung up, Yaël fell asleep quickly and finally saw that what she had been hoping to see passed weeks: the dream.
“I drew Francis!” Wade sounded proud, so Yaël looked down at his paper. It was very quickly drawn and colored man, some sort of stick-figure, like a kid’s drawing. That man, Francis apparently, got shot by another figure that he colored red. Yaël turned her head a bit. Oh, crap, it clearly was Wade shooting this Francis in his head.
“Mr. Stark, is there something wrong?” Peter asks after fifteen minutes of silent driving. They’re slowly nearing Peter’s house, but so far Tony hasn’t managed to get anything out. There’s so much to talk about, but Tony can’t figure out where to begin.
“Dad? You’re back already?!” Peter calls back, trying to get out from his own trap on the ground. Tony just stands there, holding the two mugs into his hands and frowning down at his son, who is looking like somebody has been using him as a personal punching bag.
call away. I know, Dad, you already told me,” Peter assures him, giving him a smile. Tony, too, smiles back, though only slightly.
“Interdimensional travel? That sounds extremely dangerous, as in shit we have to clean up afterwards-dangerous,” Steve mutters. Tony smirks.
“I need to find Kitty Pryde!” he shouts as he opens the door, startling everybody inside except for Charles, who has his eyebrows raised. In the room stands Mystique along with Yaël and Scott.
“Oh, well, after getting you here, he’s surely welcome!” Flash says, still wrapping one arm around Peter’s shoulder, holding up his bottle of beer in the air and facing everybody else. “LONG LIVE PENIS PARKER!”
“Just… thought about doing what you did – with Dum-E? I thought he would like a little cousin.” Peter shrugs as he draws out the first design for his own bot. He doesn’t know how long it’ll take for him to finish this one, but it’s a nice project.
Steve still has his arms crossed. “Well, I can’t let you into SHIELD just like that. Everybody pretty much hates you in there.”
Steve stays quiet for a moment. Peter swears that he hears a sniff on the other side of the line; is Steve crying?
“Soul and Time, I know. But where is Soul?” Rhodey curses out. His suit has taken damage, but he’s still good to go. He has a large wound on his forehead, which will surely leave a scar. Tony would have wanted him to stay out of the action for at least a little while longer. They don’t have the luxury of wanting things.
“But what if he did?” Tony counters. Steve sighs, shuffling closer until Tony’s face is safely against Steve’s neck. “What if he doesn’t want me in his life?”
“No, that’s a mop,” Steve points out. Tony curses, putting it back where he found it. When he turns back around, there’s suddenly a tall man standing behind him, grabbing a hold on his arms. “Tony, stop raiding the cleaner’s stuff and come join me in the kitchen. If you want to make yourself useful, prepare the table.”
Yaël stomped through the street while slamming on the touch screen of her phone. Wait a bloody minute. Steve’s number wasn’t in her phone… what?! She still didn’t have his number! Suddenly Yaël discovered she walked too far, which didn’t light up her mood.
The two take the quick elevator upstairs. Once they’re in the penthouse, Peter drops his bag on the ground and takes off his coat and gloves. Ned does the same, putting his stuff on one of the hangers. Then the two boys get into the couch and start up the TV.
Peter doesn’t complain. He guides her to the apartment. It’s empty as far as he knows, since Johnny’s probably still with the others of his team. The lights are out when he gets in. With a loud sigh, he takes the first few steps, throwing his bag on the couch and taking in the environment around him.
Peter holds up a thumb before getting out onto the balcony. Just some quiet crime-fighting for the weekend, it sounds relaxing. Peter lets out a happy sigh when he swings through the streets. If he’d been wearing no mask, the wind would have been chilling the skin of his face.
“Your mother loved you with every fiber in her being,” Tony assures him. “Everything she’s ever done is to keep you safe from any harm. And that includes keeping me away from you when I wasn’t that good in my head.”
“Yeah, or at least I was, until you suddenly came to stand in front of me! If I’m late, it’s your fault,” she mutters. Peter’s mouth falls open, and he tries to answer but can’t manage to get anything passed his lips. He wouldn’t know what to say anyway. He comes to stand up instead once all the books are from the ground, and then ends up staring right into the dark greenish-brown eyes of the girl.
“I know, it’s just…” Tony pulls his hands back, turning around and looking up at the wall. He shakes his head while rubbing his forehead. “I suppose I just don’t want him to end up like me.”
Peter hangs on. For an hour, he bites his tongue and pretends to enjoy himself. But after that, he decides he needs a moment. Just a bit of fresh air. So he quickly tells Ned he’s going out for a little while, and then gets to the garden. Walking past a few couples that are making out, Peter hurries into a secluded spot where he, then, starts to climb up the wall.
Was that a good character trait, though? Yaël’s heart raced. What did she actually want from him? One second she wants to leave him as soon as possible because he reminded her of Loki, the other second, she wants to talk to him again as she found him intriguing. Or maybe she just wanted to sleep with him, which wouldn’t shock her either, as he was damn hot.
Peter cocked his eyebrow at her, but kept his mouth shut. But it was Vision who started speaking with disapproval. “You shouldn’t make a decision based on what others do.”
Peter wakes up in the morning, only to be greeted by his father, who is looking way too excited for being barely awake. The guy made him breakfast, and even as Peter is eating, the guy is still jumping around excitedly. Before Peter can even ask where Steve is, the guy starts explaining what he’s planned for today.
"J-JARVIS?" Peter gasped, glancing over at his clock. It was already almost midnight, and he knew his dads were really tired, but maybe there was still a chance—
"Oh," Steve said on a gasp as Tony kicked off his shoes and carefully climbed onto the narrow bed, laying his head down on top of Steve's chest as Steve's heavy left arm settled across his waist. As soon as he was in place, it was like the weight of the world was suddenly lifted from Steve's back, and he found himself so overwhelmed that he could barely breathe.
"Yeah, that's actually a good point," Bruce said with a nod as he turned back to the monitor, the gibberish Russian text reflected in his glasses. Natasha shot Tony another questioning look, to which Tony replied with a shrug as he tugged Steve over to their spot against the wall and pulled out his phone.
And who just happened to be the daughter of Hank Pym, who, while not officially reported missing, had not been seen by anyone since Thanos' snap.
Grunting, Peter grabbed onto the back of the couch and pulled himself up, peeking over the top to find Papa and Dad on the pullout bed in the very back of the jet. Papa had a book in one hand, some dog-eared novel from the small library he kept in the jet, and Dad's tablet was lying face down off to the side, with his glasses neatly folded on top. Peter couldn't help but smile at how they were cuddled up together, with Dad's head resting on Papa's chest and Papa's arm tight around him.
"Well…" Steve stammered, unsure quite what to say. "Sharon mentioned something about your father having to go to work, so maybe she just thought that you might like some company?"
"I know you do." Peter brought Gwen's hand to his lips, kissing the back of it. "It's just… right now I really don't wanna think about it. I'd—I'd rather just watch the movie with you and forget about everything else." Peter knew Uncle Sam would be shaking his head in frustration if he'd heard him just now, but since Uncle Sam wasn't there, then he didn't need to know.
Stepping into the hallway, Tony didn't even bother to make eye contact with the Safety Officers as he informed them that he needed to stop by the house to pick up his notes before returning to the base. Howard was nowhere to be found, likely either sleeping it off in his room or out wandering the neighbourhood as he'd been known to do during the day, which suited Tony just fine. He was in absolutely no mood to see him again anytime soon.
"Peter," said Sharon. She tucked the chart to her chest and leaned forward, lowering her voice. "He's got a pretty bad heart, poor little guy. The night nurse said that she'd never seen a kid's face that blue before."
He catches a quick look from Steve, finding the man pressing a hand against his face, barely daring to look up. Good, take that, you punk.
And sure, Peter’s had sex before. With Gwen, they’d gone all the way, one particular evening, and sure it had been fun for a little bit, but… Peter doesn’t
Of course, the principal will know there’s no father to speak of. He’ll figure out that, whoever will appear in Mr. Stark’s stead will not be in any relation to him. Who would it even be? Peter can almost imagine Mr. Stark sending Steve here – or Steve offering to come instead.
“That’s the problem now, isn’t it?” Tony asks. Then, at last, he looks up. He gently removes Steve’s hands from his shoulders. Then he puts some distance between the two of them.
Someone passed her in the hallway and Yaël could’ve sworn the man was staring at her strangely. But when she looked up, he had already turned his head and was walking away from her. What was that about?
“Well, it seems like your guy get his chance to prove himself right now,” Fury mutters out. “Suit up, Cap, and we’ll check out the situation.”
“I got you a citytrip to Prague?” Tony asks in confusion, suddenly thinking back to Johnny and Wade who told him they were going to take care of it. “Fucking brats…”
“Well, any friend of yours can be a friend of ours. She should hang out with us, maybe? I could use another girl in this group filled with testosterone,” Yaël laughs, and Peter laughs along with her. Then suddenly her eyes go wide and she turns towards Wade, shouting out something disturbing from that show of hers. Peter decides to stay out of it, instead looking a bit to the side and taking in the calm currently going around in the park.
“Well, you could’ve told me that back then, so I knew I didn’t have to wear this shit today!” Were they fighting over this? It didn’t really feel like a fight, well, it kind off was a fun fight. Was that weird? A fun fight?
Instead of being put off by it, Steve does the same thing Pepper used to do; he admires it. He’s not disturbed by the obvious amount of scar tissue he’s got, not afraid to put his lips onto it and kiss him there where once the arc reactor used to be to keep him alive.
“I’m peachy,” Tony returns dryly. “Though I figure you would be tired, after all that patrolling the entire night.”
And when he receives a text from that all-too-annoying Wade, telling him that he should go to that girl’s apartment – Yaël, Peter reminds himself – and that they should meet up with him in the park, Peter only hesitates for a few seconds before turning into action and grabbing his bag.
“I, uh… I pushed his chair up to his room,” he explained. “And then I kind of threw him in the bed.”
With a grunt, Peter pulls himself up again. It’s time to get changed and get ready for work. While he’s been deep into his thoughts, the time has flown by. It won’t do him good to be late
Yaël discovered that he had a high-functioning brain, as he started talking about making a choice between electrical engineering or biochemistry. As Yaël didn’t really know what these two words even meant, she started asking herself if she wasn’t just dumb. Maybe she never even went to school and maybe Peter was just a mainstream boy. But it didn’t matter, she told herself. Even if Peter was just a mainstream teenager, he’d always be the smartest geek to her.
They never leave Peter alone. Not sure how low exactly he is, they rather avoid any unneeded problems. At night, somebody stays with him. During the day, he has company. He’s never on his own, but so far he hasn’t complained about it.
Brunnhilde stared at the escaping ship. “The people are safe, that’s all that matters,” she said to Thor while walking towards Yaël who was still stuck by Hela’s spears. The both stopped next to her. Thor smoothly tilted Yaël out of the spears. She didn’t even have the energy anymore to hiss or to thank him.
“Steve,” Tony whispers out. He’s sweaty, his face red. Steve hesitates for a moment, afraid he’s going to give the guy a heart attack. While they usually go two rounds before going to sleep, Steve also realizes that Tony isn’t the youngest man around anymore, and it’s not always evident that they could do this the way they’re going doing it now for a very long time.
“Oh Captain, my captain, is there something you wanted to ask humble little old me?” Tony asks the moment he’s through the door. He probably doesn’t even notice letting go of Pepper’s hand while he approaches Steve.
“I think you heard what I said. Or are you hard of hearing? I mean, I could try shouting it if you want?”
Tony jokes. Peter snorts in response. It’s good, having Bruce with them again. It lightens the mood a little bit at home, and Bruce is also good in keeping Tony in line whenever he’s neglecting his health. Whenever Tony starts a discussion, Bruce just warns him about feeling green again. After that, Tony always listens.
Tony leaves for Wakanda the next night. The flight takes about eleven hours, and Tony’s feeling like he’s not at all mentally prepared to go and visit the King of Wakanda to look over the accords. It’s not that he can’t see eye to eye with T’Challa. In fact, they’ve been talking to each other once in a while to arrange this meeting.
Yaël jumped and turned around, she felt her heart beat fast in her chest. It was a tall, blonde man. It wasn’t the first time she saw him in this dream, he had been there the previous two times too, but it was the first time he spoke.
“Actually, Dad said Asgard’s been destroyed. Its survivors are somewhere in Norway, he said,” he admits. Bruce looks up after that, mouth fallen open.
Peter lets out a sigh, once again wondering how Harry’s doing right now. What time is it in Paris? Is it day? Probably not, right? Maybe it’s night? But Harry’s surely not sleeping yet, obviously out with friends, maybe a few girls. Peter knows Harry isn’t one to shy away from the pleasures of the flesh.
It’s safe to say that Peter has never drunk alcohol before. Even later, he wouldn’t really be able to explain what made him drink right now, but as it is, he finishes his glass in one go, immediately going for the next one. It could be the sudden realization that the school year is almost over, or maybe the fact that Flash is actually being kind of non-violent towards him.
“Well, no, I’m the wrong person to teach you about being responsible. They just discovered that you were doing dumb shit by being lonely and they needed to get rid of me. Or give me some kind of useful purpose, I guess. Well, they paid me better than the other dudes who wanted me to help them rob a bank.”
“Right. And what about Johnny? When is he moving in?” he asks, starting to distribute the meat May prepared. If Peter wouldn’t know better, he would have thought Steve would be the father of the house here.
“And the worst part about it all is to find out that FRIDAY can’t even track you anymore! What if something would have happened, and we couldn’t find you? I didn’t put in that tracker to stalk you, Peter! I would only use it for emergencies!”
“You like it?” the girl says, and it’s the first thing Peter’s ever heard her saying. Now he doesn’t know what he expected her voice to be like; serene and soft, strong and loud… In any way, it’s everything except for this hoarse voice that sounds like a teenager that just came back from a rock-concert where she sung her lungs out. Maybe she’s a smoker?
“I’ve never really done a car chase before! Only careful driving! This is insane!” Peter shouts. With all the movements, he accidentally pressed the red button on the flip phone. The call never got through. “Have you gotten through to Happy yet?”
“Yeah, he, uh… He’s not doing too well, though he’s trying not to show it,” Peter admits. “He’s in India somewhere, now. I don’t know where, though.”
Peter counters, clearly agitated about it. Steve puts a hand on Tony’s shoulder, but doesn’t say anything. He just gives him a long, calm look. Enough for Tony to know what he means.
“Hero, villain, all just titles that don’t really matter. I think you’re a living being who, just like me, lives upon making mistakes and fixing those.” This time, Yaël raised her eyebrows.
Yaël thought she saw something move to her left this time. She immediately knew who it was: the read-haired woman. She had seen her in the memory of Steve she had during the session with X. The professor also had shown Yaël a picture of the redhead. The woman looked at her nails for a moment and then crossed her arms. She shone out arrogance, but it made her look kind of badass.
When the fifth robber pulls out a device that brings over a massive shock wave over them, everything seems to break around them. Glass shatters, cars fly off the ground and actually crush a couple of agents to death. Peter is thrown back against a wall, quickly followed by Wanda. By the surprise, Vision, too, is blown away before he can protect Wanda.
“Come back here, you little-“  Steve mutters out while he pulls Tony towards him. Before he can finish the sentence, the two have their lips smashed together. Tony’s hand go for Steve’s waist, while Steve’s reach for Tony’s face. They kiss for a lifetime, holding on to each other like it’s the only thing keeping them alive.
Tony winks at his reflection, seeing the white-haired man do the same back. Then, quickly, he puts back a few wild hairs of his goatee and clicks his teeth together – his
Tony can tell that her mind is already made up pretty much. She nods at him and gets onto her feet. He watches her grab her shoes off the ground, which is indication enough for him to get up as well. Once she’s wearing her coat she nods towards the door for him to follow.
“Please, just… let us hold you for a little while longer, Peter,” Steve mumbles out. Peter opens his mouth to speak, but then he closes it again.
Shit, what happened yesterday? Tony raises his hand to his head and scratches through his hair. Gently, he shuffles out of the bed without waking the girls. He’s good at that, having had practice for years. Carefully, he picks up what looks like his clothes (though they’re pieces he’s never really worn before) and hurries into the bathroom.
“Yes, it was the logical thing to do,” he responds. Then he turns his head, and shares another deep look with Wanda, something they’ve been doing for a while now. It freaks Peter out a little bit; what is happening between these two?
Only at the end of the hallway, a room is occupied. It’s a slightly bigger room than the other one. The person inside of it looks sick in every way. His skin looks almost green, with weird scars all over his skin. His hair is messy, going almost every way. His eyes, once blue and happy, now look empty and hollow, almost devoid of all colors.
“South Park, huh? That’s cool,” Peter remarks, making the two men look up. Tony’s head is resting against Steve’s shoulder, who has an arm resting on the head of the couch, another on Tony’s leg.
“To put it crudely, who of the two takes it up the ass,” Sam explains with his eyes closed and a hand covering his eyebrows. Natasha stops her movements, giving Sam a shocked look. Blinking a few times, she then tugs on James’ hair.
Too bad the others don’t seem to agree. The door opens again all of the sudden. There’s light footsteps, and then a hand on his shoulder.
Johnny moves so fast at one point, Peter has to close his eyes from the light. He can’t see Venom being destroyed, can’t see if it works. But when he opens his eyes again, once he feels the heat disappear from his face, there’s no trace of Venom left anymore.
“How are you? I’ve been worried as hell! You can’t just disappear like that!” she ranted against him.
Suddenly, after ten minutes of covering for the story of the explosion, instead comes up a different footage. There’s some sort of web, it seems. Black web. In it, there’s a girl. With dark, reddish hair, and familiar dark skin. Peter’s heart skips a beat when he sees her from even that distance.
“Dr. Cho has a few blood-samples of every Avengers right here, just in case she would ever be needing it,” Wanda explains as they pass by a few refrigerators with little tubes. Not all of them are filled with blood, but probably plasma as well. Peter’s also sure he saw a few tubes with antidotes for things. He takes his time as he passes them by, honestly a bit impressed at how big her stash is. Hopefully the other Avengers are aware of this?
“Dude, I mean, sir… X, is that you?” Yaël muttered. X nodded. “But, I mean, no offense, sir, but you look so young!”
The report comes in through mail, and once Peter opens it he sees almost everything that’s been written down on Harry Osborn’s recovery. At first, he wonders if he should be allowed to see this, but the first thing he comes across is a written note from Harry himself saying that he consents on letting Peter see these things.
The Avengers are still weary of Loki. Peter can’t blame him; the guy’s more like Deadpool. He can sometimes act like the hero, but he could just as easily stab you in the back. It’s just the way the guy is, and seemingly, Yaël seems to be okay with that.
Things have been weird since then. And at first Peter was too glad for surviving that he never thought to question it. After that, there was graduation, moving out, the Compound being struck by a meteor, college… No, he never really took the time to get everything straight. He can barely even remember what’s been happening in the past few weeks since college started. It’s all… vague.
“That’s a surprise for you, son,” he says back. Peter frowns, focusing back on the two at the door. At last, Natasha gets in, and she’s quickly followed by the figure behind her.
Due to the hell the Russo brothers put us through with Infinity War, were going to change some certain points in our stories, so we're able to fix all of it.
,” Steve said shortly right before he hung up, leaving Yaël with tears of guilt in her eyes. She had just forsaken the man that always took care of her, helped her out, by declining to help him.
“I was there, that day the Goblin took you. I saw everything happen,” Flash says. Peter straightens his hoodie and untangles his earbuds, but still waits for further explanation. “I heard Iron Man call out after you – call out your name.”
“He’s going to Siberia to find the other Winter Soldiers,” Wilson says. Tony shivers, remembering how Steve vaguely mentioned something about more of them back in Leipzig. But they were a bit too pre-occupied to talk it out, of course.
That must have been because he had been admitted again. He did say something about someone sending him back to the place to get him better once more. They must have shut off all his contact with the outside world.
“What are you-?” Tony finds himself asking, but he can’t find it in himself to finish that sentence.
That thought, in turn, made him realize that he hasn’t only forgotten the box at home, but the pills in general as well. For the past week, none of the white pearls have been taken. And Peter feels the effect immediately.
“Come on, Raido, you know the queen brainwashed your generation into believing in Gods who will punish or reward you for your behavior and deeds,” Yaël wasn’t afraid to discuss this matter with her friend. she had been doing that for ages, and it annoyed the crap out of him. “
“Well, yeah, I’ve been awake most of the night talking to the government, trying to keep your ass out of the fire.”
His browser history lately only contains the latest news about Captain America; if he’s been found yet, what the latest update on him is. People are describing him as a criminal now, but Peter knows that’s not who he is. Steve
“Daddy, you’re back!” a high-pitched voice calls out. There are little footsteps, and suddenly small arms wrapped around him. Tony looks down, finding a nine-year-old-looking girl hugging him with a happy smile on her face.
But with Peter lashing out against that robber, the way he acted out of control in his rage… Seeing him like that scared Tony in every possible way. Especially when he looked down at his son, and the first thing he could see was his elevated heartrate inside his head.
There’s only one bed in here, so it’s not too difficult to spot Mr. Stark. He’s already sitting up, an IV still attached to his arm but otherwise nothing else medical-wise connected to him. He’s pale, and a bit sweaty, but there’s a smile on his face as he’s swinging around a spoon full of what seems like pudding.
“Mr. Osborn hasn’t addressed it publicly yet?” he tries. Peter’s eyes go back up to him before shaking his head.
“So, if it isn’t the gauntlet, maybe it’s the power source?” Peter mutters again to himself, looking back at the round thing on the table that Peter suspects is what brought the power. It reminds him a bit of the round thing Iron Man has in the middle of his chest. It doesn’t take long for him to put two and two together, then.
There’s a moment of silence on the other side of the line, then some mumbled speaking, May telling something to the others, probably. There’s some shifting noises, cracking as if her phone is passed along to somebody else, and then there’s another voice.
But in the tower there’s Steve. And Peter. And all the other Avengers. And, right now, he doesn’t think he can handle them. Steve because of his damn confession yesterday. Peter because of everything that happened to him. The Avengers are just too… loud. He doesn’t want to deal with this right now.
Right, so much for their couple of steps back. Ah, well, they didn’t say they would go back to the complete beginning, right?
“If you please, I would be very grateful,” Steve adds. Tony rolls his eyes but lets out a small chuckle nonetheless. “Now, Peter’s headed to his apartment. Will you finally sleep?”
“You heard from Steve?” Peter asks when the credits start playing. Tony, who has been reading stuff on his tablet in silence, just hums and curls some more of Peter’s hair around his fingers. The head massage feels kind of good, and Peter closes his eyes appreciatingly.
“Tony, for the last time, I’m not asking Betty out, and I’m most certainly not taking her to an arcade!” Bruce counters. Rhodey then once again leans forward.
“Yeah, wait, I’ll fix that,” she said and as she checked herself for injuries, the water ran back out of Peter’s clothes and hair. The stream ran out of the room as Yaël mentally steered it to the sink in the kitchen. Well, maybe she should start training again, since she just almost drowned Peter in his sleep.
“Nope,” Tony returns, trying not to react too much to Steve’s hand on his stomach, drawing small patterns on it. When he gets to Tony’s scar, he follows it, head looking down to take a look at it. Then, suddenly, he crawls down for a bit, putting his head on the same level as Tony’s belly.
she explains. Peter groans, shutting the drawer again when all he can find is the first few versions of the gauntlets and the mask. Instead he moves on to the following years. Once he gets to 2012, there’s a surprising lack of
Peter jumped up to defend himself energetically. “I swear, I don’t have hidden feelings for you. I mean, sure, you look great and all; very exotic with that Latino vibe and then the hair. But to be honest, and I don’t mean to be rude, the combination of my meds and the alcohol…” Yaël took the compliment easily and let it pass.
Peter’s problem obviously was that he needed someone to give him a clear answer. It was kind of cute actually and it proved once more that he was just a normal person.  He couldn’t choose between the two fields, he liked the both of them but… if he’d chose electrical engineering, he’d be able to do a scholarship in Stark Tower. Peter already talked to Mr Stark for an internship, so Yaël didn’t really get what was holding him back. With some luck, he’d somewhat get to know his dad.
“I-“ Tony starts, but the words seem to come short. Having brought Tony speechless, Peter feels at least a little sense of pride inside of him. That pride is quickly replaced by warmth when he suddenly feels himself being pulled into a strong hug by the man in front of him.
tinkering around in the workshop. So he surprises everybody and their mother when he asks Liz as his date.
Suddenly someone in the crowd shouted: “JUST KISS ALREADY!” And for some unknown reason, Yaël and Peter crashed into each other’s arms and started kissing sensationally. Well, this was the phenomenon that Yaël knew as ‘the heat of the moment’. Peter squeaked and ripped the phone out of Yaël’s hands.
Steve doesn’t sit down. Instead he walks up to Tony, takes the engineer’s hand and kneels down. Even just for a moment, Peter startles. Is he-? Don’t say he’s going to propose?!
Tony grits his teeth together upon seeing Norman Osborn walking up to Mary, who turns to look at Tony and finds that he’s no longer here.
Steve’s smile disappears only slightly before he puts it up again. It’s true that he had been extremely unhappy the last time he had been in New Asgard. The last time he spoke to Thor, he had been talking about ending the relationship. Thor had tried to persuade him not to do it, but… Yeah, Thor might be stubborn, but so is Steve.
It looks like even the sky is burning. What used to always be blue and bright is now red, yellow, burning into everybody’s eyes. The blood of all their fallen comrades, a reminder of what they’ve all lost.
“I’ll handle Tony,” Steve whispers against his lips with a light smile. Tony grins before kissing him one more time, this time more out of reflex. Then he pulls away. He doesn’t say goodbye to the others, doesn’t even think about saying goodbye to the kids, or Mary. That’s the other Tony’s life, not his.
going through him. He remembers last time a girl took his hand to put down her address, a little more than two years ago now.
“I do drive sometimes, you know,” he states. In one swift motion, he turns the car around and heads away from the compound, back towards the city. As always, traffic is a nightmare, but that’s why Tony had calculated that he should make the reservations at eight instead of seven. That gives them a full hour to get there, and if they’re early, Tony will just take him out for a walk through Brooklyn.
“Yeah, and you’re Peter, right?” Ned asks in return. When Peter raises an eyebrow, Ned just shrugs. “People talk around here, you know,” he adds. Peter knows he’s talking about Gwen, and the fact that he’s failing his classes. He wants to say something, but suddenly the teacher looks at him with a stern expression.
“Amongst things, yeah,” Tony returns. “Listen, son, I’m tired and I just need to go to bed. You’re still here tomorrow?”
Peter doesn’t comment on it. He watches Johnny on the ground, rolling on his back while he lets the full force of the impact of what happened earlier wash over him. He shifts his head a bit, giving Peter a wide smile.
“Mr. Stark, it’s good to see you awake again,” Dr. Cho says, though sounding anything but happy. She gives him a soft glare. “We weren’t too sure we were going to get you to wake up again.”
It’s simple. They were given a challenge. A damn hard one, too. The rules were clear; he and Steve were to have at least a whole month without being caught having sex. It sounded so easy, too. Just make FRIDAY warn them up when somebody would come near, not doing it in special places in public, and just to be safe, only do it when there’s nobody home or when everybody’s sleeping.
“That ice-cream probably looks like a cold soup right now,” Peter said as he walked to the living room.
The two leave the room. The case stays inside; Tony will get it later, or T’Challa will have it brought to the room he’s staying at. That’s the good thing about being able to stay at the Palace for the coming few days. He only wishes he could have taken Peter along. He might have been able to relax a bit on a holiday.
So, he learns that he and Mary got indeed married by the time she turned out pregnant with Peter. They hadn’t even dated, just decided to get hitched to avoid bad press. In the eye of the public, they appear like the perfect, loving couple with three adorable children: Peter Howard Stark, Thomas Patrick Stark and Natalee Maria Stark. Natalee… of course he would name his only daughter after Natasha’s alter-ego from his childhood.
“Tony, are you still with me?” Steve asks after a few long seconds. But even when Tony opens up his mouth to confirm his question, nothing comes out. Steve’s voice sounds weird, as if it’s distant. The other noises around him start getting louder. His eyes sting, his chest hurts. He sees Peter fall down again, unmoving…
Yaël put another scoop of pasta in her mouth and said: “No…” Faking her unknowingness while there were strips of spaghetti still hanging out of her mouth. The plastic box next to her on the cabinet with Tony’s name on it didn’t really help her fake-innocence. But she had an excuse: Stark was never in the compound and she had found this box in the freezer. God knows how long it had been in there, it needed to get rescued.
“Hello?” he asks casually, shooting a few more webs to make sure the guys stays stuck. No human being is strong enough to break out of this – at least he hopes so. With a small bow he picks up the suitcase the guy has been carrying along.
“I- I wasn’t?” Peter can’t even find it in himself to react to the sudden snap he’s getting from Tony. Sure, the guy’s clearly pissed off and ready to start throwing insults all around the place, but Peter doesn’t care. Because his father’s not making any sense at all.
He avoids bell-towers, or places where he can hear the seconds ticking by. Luckily, there aren’t too many places like that in New York.
necessary. And now I’ve used two of them already,” Peter whispers, a little bit ashamed that he’s been using Mr. Stark’s codes that freely. Of course, they were both urgent matters, but it doesn’t make him feel less horrible about himself.
But Peter wouldn’t really know what else to offer them. Bucky and Natasha have already revealed that they’ll be moving out soon enough, taking back Natasha’s old floor in Stark Tower. That way, they’re still close to a part of the team, but separated enough from them to have time to themselves. In the end, all that’s left are Clint, Sam, Wanda and Vision; that means a couple and two guys who can’t always fully stand each other.
Steve then shrugs. “I personally never had any trouble with him, but if I need to believe what the others tell me, you should better be a bit careful around him,” he jokes. Yaël wanted to say that he wasn’t her father so he shouldn’t judge her friends so badly based on what he’s heard, but she kept her mouth shut.
For the past few days, he’s been on quite a roll. Now using the self-defense techniques Nat taught him, he finds that the hits he’s been getting are becoming less often. He moves more efficiently, ends up with less holes in his suit, and finds himself chasing crime after crime. Even now, he’s on a streak, stopping one crime after the other without taking a break. Yesterday he did ten in a row. Today, he’s already close to eight, and it’s not even ten in the evening. He’ll probably break his own record again.
“Yeah, about that, Natasha is quite pissed that you stole her mask. She wants it back,” Steve adds in between. Peter kicks off his shoes as he listens in on what is said here.
“Come, let’s let the lovebirds make peace on their own,” he says. Peter couldn’t be happier for the release of this ever-lasting… well, not
Everything started flashing, colors were mixing and then everything turned black. It took a few seconds for Yaël to adjust to the darkness of her own bedroom. She was soaked. Her breathing became difficult and she started coughing through it. Moving felt like she was a boat in a storm. After finally getting out of bed, she fainted. When she woke up again everything was even worse. She tried crawling towards the bathroom, but fainted again. Somehow she finally reached a bin, which she clenched onto.
So Tony gets dressed. He puts on a simple band-shirt and a black jacket on top of that. Then he puts on some sunglasses and heads towards the garage, his hands in the pockets of his black jeans. Whatever Peter just managed to do, Tony’s not sure he won’t just give him house-arrest because of how annoyed he’s feeling.
“What? No way, how?” Peter almost jumps up from his seat as she speaks. “Rhodey, do you know anything about this?”
“Just… let’s just sleep, alright?” Steve asks once he’s regained his breath. Tony lets out another heavy breath before nodding against Steve’s chest.
Taking out his phone again, he looks over Johnny’s text again. It says the party is at eight, which means he still has about an hour to get there. If he goes to the apartment after this, he might still catch him on his way there.
“Yeah, sure,” Yaël grunted sarcastically, hoping that someone would find her in this alley and fix her. She felt dizzy, but refused to close her eyes again. This woman in front of her killed Raido. If Yaël could, she’d drink Nilla’s blood.
“It grew back together…” Tony returns. Peter tries to feel at the spot Tony cut not five seconds ago, realizing that, indeed, the neck is intact again.
Steve had assured him. Everybody hates it, of course, but sentence is sentence. And while it’s not a long one, it’s still one they’ll all have to see through.
got back yesterday. You really think he’ll let you go again?” Bucky rubs his shoulder, as if it’s hurting him. The lack of an arm doesn’t seem to bother him as much as they would have expected.
“What, did she eat it as a baby or something?” Lopt smirked, pulling her out of her thoughts. But the king wasn’t laughing.
He hears Steve before he sees him. The man is calling out some more instructions to some of the workers. Things about bringing weapons away for inspection and whatever else. Tony doesn’t listen, instead hurrying to the source of the voice.
The argument is cut short, eventually, when both Steve and Tony’s phone start ringing. Having gotten a message from George Souza.
“Look, I’m a doctor, not a magician,” the random person, doctor apparently, said. “I did the best I can do, I gave her a probe and an IV. But even I can’t find what’s wrong with her. You had to take her to the hospital as soon as you found her, but-“
Steve is much like Rhodey, but there’s something different about it. He’s much more tactile, Peter notices early on. There’s always a hand on the shoulder, on the back. Sometimes Steve even pulls him into an embrace and starts stroking through Mr. Stark’s hair. It’s weird to see it like that.
But Christmas-time, she and Tony decided to spend at the mansion in Malibu. That never happened, of course, as she ended up with a literal smoking-hot body, using one of Tony’s suits to finally put an end to Aldrich Killian. Tony got rid of the Arc Reactor, decided to get some help for his panic attacks. Things went better. When they came back to New York, they learned Thor had some mission of his own in Greenwich, and then Natasha left again, joining Steve in Washington where they were doing their own SHIELD-mission.
“Exactly!” Tony says, pointing towards Barnes. But then he realizes their situations are not at all the same, given that, while Natasha pretty much
Peter gets ready to put away his plate. He grabs it from the table, stands up, and takes his first few steps before knocking in against somebody and dropping it all to fall. His reflexes are quick enough that he reaches back to it to keep it from breaking on the ground, though only afterwards he realizes that the very few people in the room are watching him.
as healed as he thought – Peter starts to slowly make his way back to Queens. Once home, he takes a shower, a light painkiller Dr. Cho prescribed him, and then he heads to bed.
Tony looks through the pictures. There’s another few aliens that don’t seem to fit in with the Asgardians. The last page he comes by is a familiar face. His eyes open wide.
He falls down on the ground, throwing Eddie off his feet and making him fly slightly into the air before he, too, hits the ground. He makes a painful sound.
rebellious years. He remembers driving it all around town, picking up girls and impressing his friends. He wonders what became of that bike, not even remembering if he ever sold it or anything. Probably his father got rid of it while Tony was partying all night long.
“Hi, Tony. You alright?” Natasha asks, pretending to be curious. Tony holds up a thumb while heading for the coffee machine.
It goes on and on, explaining that they’ll need to have their powers analyzed to categorize their threat level. They can’t cross international boundaries at any time they wish, they need clearance. Every bit counters what Sue is feeling on the matter. It had taken her a while to accept the role she has in this world, but now they’re throwing it all overboard once again, making it something completely worse.
“I’m glad to be back,” he returns. “But can we just- can we not talk about this anymore? I don’t really want to-“
Pepper laughs. Rhodey gives her a greeting hug when he finally turns to her. She kisses his cheek. Tony never minds; the guy is part of the family, after all.
“Next time you’re not allowed to play,” she shouts back to him. The four of them then throw their guns on the ground as an indication that the game is officially over. With a nod to the left, Wanda indicates that they should get back to the living room. Peter agrees, following her out of the hallway.
enjoy it with Gwen, that time. He had loved her, and as they slept together, Peter can’t say that he regrets it.
“It’s alright, Tony. I knew it would happen if I would come here,” he admits. “They’re only doing their job, after all.”
Peter’s head shoots up in alarm upon that. Has anybody figured out that Steve might possibly but very surely have a crush on a certain super-intelligent billionaire? A crush that even Peter shouldn’t know about but does because he’s seen the guy stare and pine for the past two months? A crush that may or may not be returned but it’s not easy to say since said super-intelligent billionaire is master in keeping his thoughts of that quiet?
Oh, he’s playing with fire already by staying away for this long, but the idea of getting back to Stark Tower and hear the words he’s so afraid to hear… nothing that he’ll do will make the burn less, so he might as well just postpone it for a few more hours.
“WHAT?!” Peter waved his hand, he shifted on his place. “Calm down, that’s what I’m trying to tell you… I went to visit him in his cell.” To make sure Yaël didn’t have the chance to yell again, he just kept talking. “I just needed to see him with my own two eyes, you know? They’re trying to find a cure for him, but I think they’re not trying hard enough!”
“Hey Petey, are you alright?” he asks, reaching out for Peter. In a jump, Peter is out of his seat. The whole class is now looking at him, wondering why he’s reacting so weird. But Peter can’t speak, because he only sees Harry there and he isn’t sure if it’s Harry or the Goblin.
“C’mon, son, let’s get you changed,” Tony says carefully. Peter groans against the pillow, shaking his head.
But this girl had a little problem with impulses. In her anger, because she wasn’t finished with raging just yet, she called another number. As soon as someone picked up without saying anything, Yaël calmed down. Rage made place for shame as she didn’t dare to say a word anymore. She almost hung up again, but X started talking.
After a nod to nobody in particular, Tony heads to the closet in question and opens it. Much like Steve’s text suggested there’s a brown, worn briefcase on the bottom. When Tony takes it out, he finds only a few trinkets. A newspaper picture of Richard with Curt Connors, two coins, a broken calculator, an ID for Oscorp on Richard’s name, an USB stick and a case with used glasses inside of them. The last thing he finds is a loose folder, the logo on it being nothing more than two circles with diagonal lines through them.
He can’t say that he’s been thinking about the same thing, but he can’t help but admit that he likes this. Steve feels amazing, so close to him, and for a moment all his worries about Peter are gone.
Yaël couldn’t help it as she chuckled and dug her face into his T-shirt. So this was how it felt again…  Yaël had a secret love for hugs. They felt way warmer than a kiss or anything, but she felt too awkward to hug someone herself. By the way, there hadn’t been many hug-able people around her lately.
“Understood, we’ll be there,” he says with a shaky voice. Then he sniffs his nose and clears his throat. “Tony, we need to move, Strange found a place we can regroup for a moment and think of a new plan.”
Peter nods, taking place behind the table, next to MJ. For somebody who just broke up with her boyfriend, she doesn’t seem all that conflicted at all. Maybe Harry was right and they’re both happy to be free again.
A sigh escapes Tony’s lips before he shakes his head. He needs to continue, finish this job. With careful steps he goes up the stairs, slightly hesitating before he raises up his hand towards the wooden door in front of him.
Once Steve has reached Tony, the engineer can clearly see Steve’s cheeks redden from the admission. Tony tries to wave it off while chuckling.
“Uh, because I got to follow these guys to their boss before they’re moving him, and… I don’t really want my Dad to find out,” Peter admits. Ned gives him a confused stare.
But it is. Because how can Tony pretend everything is alright when he knows how Steve grunts when Tony is punching him right in the face? How can Tony think it’s okay when he clearly remembers the blood dripping out of Steve’s nose, him begging for Tony to stop.
“Tony,” the Captain gets out, clearly surprised at the sudden presence of the engineer in the room. Tony rolls his eyes, walks up to Steve and throws an arm around his middle.
Johnny shouts from the living room. Peter chuckles after that and MJ shakes her head in amusement. Then she holds up her camera once more.
“At least I tried. I hope you can forgive yourself one day for making this bad decision.” Yaël quickly pulled the door shut behind her when another blow of fire smacked against the wall next to her. She could hear her sister yell and scream through the hallway.
Harry Osborn doesn’t look anything like how he used to be. He’d been falling apart before he took in the Spider-Vendom, but now… It’s almost like he’s undergone a complete transformation. His arms are stuck inside a suit, much like they’re wearing in all those cheap movies. He looks every bit like the psychiatric patiënt, only with less security around him.
“Yes, well, a water would be great, thank you.” Steve must be thirsty after that fight in the park, so Yaël searched for the biggest glass she had, opened the tap and let the water flow into the glass. “Yaël, do you even know how long you were gone?”
He continues the game without explaining anything to Johnny, who walks to the couch to grab the phone.
Peter lets out a shaky breath. “Yes, please,” he says. He needs Steve’s guidance for a bit. Steve’s always calm and rational (in most occasions, at least), he’ll surely talk Peter through this internal panic attack he’s been having for the past hour or so.
Oh, yeah, he’d forgotten the thrill that came with appearing in front of a large audience. Tony shakes hands with LL once again before walking further ahead, high-fiving a few of the people at the front. To the people in the back, he blows them a kiss just to make them feel included.
.” She shoves the phone in their direction, and puts the device on Peter’s lap. On it, a video starts playing. Though it’s shaky and pixelated, obviously recorded by a phone that zoomed in a lot, Peter recognizes what happens immediately.
The child’s dark eyes look up towards Tony, noticing him looking. As if on instinct, he reaches out his hands, trying to touch Tony in his curiosity. Tony finds himself smiling before realizing it, reaching down in the crib and taking the kid out. For just a moment, he tries to remember what the boy is called…
“How about that? Penis Parker?” Flash asks. His friends agree in laughter, and Flash is smiling that ugly smile of his. Peter wonders what he ever did to Flash to make him hate him so much, but he figures Flash just picks out his favorite victims and works from there on out.
“The Tesseract must be here!” shouts Thor.  “This Strucker fellow couldn't mount such a defence like this without it!  At long last!”
“You just tried to hide it from me.  Again,” Peter finished.  He swiped at his nose as he sat up, his brown eyes still glassy.  “I just worry about you, Dad.  It’s not healthy for you to stay up like that all the time, and drink so much coffee, and—”
Tony grinned, lighting up his entire face, and Steve couldn't help but grin back. He could never resist one of Tony's smiles.
“Ugh,” Peter groaned, rolling his eyes as Papa’s cheeks flushed like he’d just been sunburned.  “Can you guys please not?  It’s not even lunchtime yet.”
Clint's throat bobbed as he swallowed. "I've already spoken to Fury about it, Cap, and his opinion was the exact same as yours."
"Base, please confirm receipt of transmission?" he barked into his comm. "The damn thing's getting really close!"
"He's on the roof," he said, his hands as steady as a surgeon's as he squinted through the rifle's scope and fired, jumping up as soon as the enemy soldier thudded to the ground. "That's one."
Bucky frowned, grabbing a bag of chips while he watched Steve eat. "So, you gonna tell me what's got you all messed up? It's not like you to forget to eat."
Peter slumped back against his pillows, his fingernails digging into his palms and cringing at the gross rattling sounds that he made with every single inhale. Papa had told him after the trial mission that the only part of being in space that he hadn't liked was how cold it was, and the thought of his poor papa up there all alone… slowly freezing to death…
"1938, Buck," Steve said fondly. He could remember that incredible baseball game like it was yesterday. "It was the Dodgers against the Giants. And against all odds, the Dodgers won."
"I have!" Bucky said, speaking up for the first time since they all sat down. He smiled in Sam's direction, obviously very proud of himself. "I understood that reference."
"No, you're not." Steve lifted his head, kissing Tony on the forehead. "But we will be again, sweetheart. I promise."
"Yeah, he's told me that a few times." Steve bit down on his bottom lip, still fiddling with Tony's fingers. "Tony, Phillips told me not too long ago that he thinks there's still some serum left. He didn't say any more than that, and he also doesn't know where it is or how much, but… I was thinking…"
“I’m…afraid…I’m…not…that…good… at dying.” By that time, Yaël had collected enough warmth from Hela’s body to shoot fire at her. Hela flew back and immediately climbed up again with a murderous look on her face.
“What’s this?” he asks, curiously. Tony smiles once more before pressing a button. Then the project on the screen gets projected in the air, showing what seems like some sort of gauntlet.
never repeat what I’m about to tell you now,” Peter begs of him. He doesn’t know Ned all that well, but he knows he can trust him about this. They’re both friendless ‘losers’ who don’t stand out in school. He can share this.
“Oh, my, someone’s a bit sensitive,” then comes out, and Peter lets out another breath before he tries again, once more failing. “C’mon, aren’t you happy to see an old friend?”
Bruce sighs, giving Tony an apologetic look before lowering his head. “All signs lead to it, yeah,” he admits. “Though we still don’t know for certain, and there’s still many more tests we should do before we can get to any form of conclusion.”
“Then why are you here?” Steve asks, curiously, still with his shield up. Tony shrugs, leaning himself against the wall and crossing his arms.
“You’ve been crying,” she states dryly, closing the door behind her. Peter sniffs his nose again, and then puts his hands on his hips.
“Come on, Tony, I don’t really need to know all that!” Natasha complains, giving him a slap on the shoulder. Tony then gives her a smug look, fishing something out of his inner pocket of the jacket and holding it up in the air. Natasha can see immediately what it is.
“I did. He was most grateful for the warning and is trying to look through his security footage. I also made him aware of the role Spider-Man had in this.”
Steve is back because of the Tesseract. With it still on Asgard, Thor used it to help Steve travel from New Asgard to New York. I don't want his return to make you wonder how that's even possible, so I thought I should explain it quickly! Of course, Steve is going to shed light on the subject soon enough!
“Yes, well, the nurse will come and take some blood samples, and after that we’ll plan a few more diagnostic tests if that’s alright?” he asks. One quick look at the nurse, and the woman nods and hurries out of the room to fetch her materials. Then, to the other doctors, she starts naming up a few medications that she’s prescribing Tony, but he isn’t listening. The only thing he’s thinking about is the possibility of what could be wrong with him.
The corners of Steve’s lips curl up, giving Tony a small smile. His eyes look at him fondly, his hand coming to rest on Tony’s against his cheek.
Oh, if only he could run away, put as much distance from this creep as he can. But, he’s still at work, and ignoring a call for him – no matter how personally – could get him in serious trouble. Especially when his boss is giving him a watchful look with an eyebrow raised.
“We saw you approach because of the cameras in the trees. Wanda wanted to greet you personally when you arrived,” the… robot (?) says. Wanda only smiles a little bit, and then pulls on his arm to cross hers with his, doing the same thing with Vision.
And the Asgardians start losing it as they begin to applaud and scream, each and everyone of them happy that, finally, somebody seems to be worthy to possess the power of Thor.
Neither man sees Peter opening his eyes for a few seconds, but then closing them again with a smile on his face.
to drop a building on Peter’s head? Oh, I know, just imagine if you would have done it on purpose,” Steve hisses out, turning his wrists even more than before. He can’t describe the anger he’s feeling. He’s never done something like this before. “The way you feel about your daughter? That’s the way I feel about Peter. Because he’s my
Right at that moment, her mother, with two different eye colours, braided long, dark hair and a white gown, looked a bit like an elf. When Yaël heard some sort of scraping noise, she searched where it was coming from. There, under a tree with branches and leaves looking like those from a Weeping Willow, sat Cem, carving into a piece of wood.
“Time travel,” Strange concludes. He closes the journal, throws it back Tony’s way and then crosses his arms over his chest. “And now you’re about to asks me to send you back in time to warn her?”
“We’ve both lost so many people in life. If somebody could help me find a long lost family member, I’d want them to help me, too,” she says. After opening the door, Peter follows her out. In front of Dr. Cho’s office they stop, and Peter frowns as he looks down. Won’t it be too suspicious if he’d come back that quickly? Surely, there’s no way she’d know the blood sample is from here, but still, he’s barely been gone for half an hour, and they’re far enough away from the city to know that Peter couldn’t have swung his way there and back in that small amount of time. That, and there are no freaking buildings nearby to swing from.
Tony then throws his legs on the desk, accepting the smoothie U hands him. Trusting his bot (stupid decision) he takes a large gulp, making a disgusted face but deciding not to comment on it.
“What exactly happened?” T’Challa suddenly asks, confused about the whole ordeal. Tony just keeps on staring at Rhodey while the latter starts explaining.
comes through the comm link. It’s Steve! Peter sags in relief, feeling the tears flow over his face again. Steve must have heard him crying. “
Peter turns to look back at his Dad, seeing him laugh with the King and Natasha. He looks happy, for a change. It’s really good to see him like this.
So he shoots his webs, perfectly hitting Eddie on the back. Despite feeling the blood running out of his ears, he pushes through. He pulls on the webs, feeling a lot of resistance but not giving up. His muscles complains, his head complains. Tears run through his cheeks, but he doesn’t stop.
Steve hadn’t even realized that, during this mission, he’d started to call the tower just that. ‘Home’… It was where they came after chasing down another bust. Every lead they followed ends up with them arriving too late. There were only small indications that proved somebody had been there before, but never enough clues.
Captain. No fight could be fought without him. “Where do you live?” he asked as he put his helmet back on.
“Oh,” Peter answered “she’s one of the new Avengers, telepathic and telekinetic and all, helped me getting Mr. Stark’s blood for the DNA-test a while back…I guess she’s a friend.” Peter shrugged, like having a telepathic/telekinetic friend is as normal as eating cereals for breakfast. But, it was a girl…Yaël had an idea.
“I’m fine. I just wanted to know if you are, Dad?” he tries. Tony’s eyes widen, mouth falls open. It’s as if Peter’s question comes out as the biggest shock in his life.
towards her. It had mostly been the side-effects of the meds, amplified by the alcohol… That combination really didn’t do anything good to him.
In just a matter of minutes he finishes the dishes, and then he takes a shower, glad that he doesn’t have to work today. He might as well just swing around New York for a while, take the journal with him and read a bit on a high rooftop. Could he even risk it reading on top of Avengers Tower?
Now, don’t get me wrong, I want you to see your friend again. I’d be a shame if we’d keep you separated, but I want to talk to Nick first. So that he has a chance to prepare Steve and the others, if he wants to.
And that’s when the portal re-appears. It’s the same bright white light, the same force pulling him back inside, but seemingly only him. Gwen seems unaffected by it.
Out of the blue, the environment changed. It went darker and darker until Yaël noticed she was suddenly standing in a cave, which lead to the lake.
“That’s barely anything,” he says, grabbing Steve by the arm. “Ah, well, I guess you’ll never know. Come, honey.”
, the poor Peter Parker who can’t even afford new clothes, managed to get an apartment? You really think I’m believing you?” Flash hisses at him with dark eyes. Peter grabs on to Flash’ hands, trying to pry himself loose, but not trying too hard.
“Harry Lyman, yes,” he says proudly. “I just came over from… Seattle. Didn’t like the rain, parents split up, what else can you do?” He shrugs it away as if it’s not a big deal. Peter doesn’t really know what to think of it. His senses don’t give him any warnings, but he’s still not feeling quiet easy about it.
"Okay… um… would you mind doing it again, JARVIS? And go the other way this time?" As a scientist, Peter knew that an experiment couldn't be counted as a success or a failure unless it was repeatable, and he wanted to make absolutely sure that he hadn't just missed something.
"Two days from now should work, sir. That'll give me enough time to get all of them programmed and run through for troubleshooting purposes."
"Thank you," Papa said, so sincerely that a knot rose in Peter's throat. As much as he often disliked how overprotective his dads were, at least he never had to wonder whether or not they loved him.
"But is it really okay to punish a son for his father's mistakes?" Steve asked. "I mean, Anthony was only a little kid when my papa was killed so it's not like he was even involved, and yet he's still had to suffer for it."
"Oh, sure," Gwen answered as her mother stepped over to the foot of the stairs, cupping her hands around her mouth.
Steve glanced over at Tony, his expression tentative. "As soon as our son gets his heart fixed and we can take him home," he said. "Then I'll be happy to."
“I can’t help but have noticed that you’ve fixed your relationship issues,” Loki states rather than asks. Steve just nods.
“The people who stay,” she says with a smile on her face. “People leave. It’s what happens in life. What matters are the people who decide to stay by your side through it all.”
Peter’s not stupid; he knows Tony’s suffering from Steve being gone. He’s seen how badly Tony had taken it the first few days after returning from Siberia with no Captain by his side. The few nights that he does spend in his bed are plagues with nightmares, and every small mention of Steve just gets him to shut down completely. It’s probably why the man wants to distance his life from the Avengers now.
Thor’s smile is so contagious. His hands are squeezing Steve’s arms, his gaze strongly holding on to Steve’s eyes.
The doctors all seem to think transplantation will be necessary. The only problem with that is that Tony isn’t a candidate given his alcoholic tendencies.
“Well, things just weren’t going that well. Nothing dramatic happened, but do we really need something really bad to happen before we help out our friends?” Charles said while opening the door.
“Well, he’s Spider-Man, of course!” Wade said it like it was an obvious fact, like those words would justify his actions. Well, Wade could go screw himself.
“You thought you could make it more of a game for him? Right there, that was you thinking as a parent instead of a teacher,” Natasha counters. “That boy? He’s the closest thing I have to a nephew. And I’m going to do
“Hey, fuckface. Let go of him,” somebody suddenly says behind him. The hold on Peter’s shirt loosens a bit as Flash turns around. When Peter tries to catch a glimpse over Flash’ shoulder, he finds a young girl standing there. She looks slightly familiar. She has red, full lips that are put into a wide grin, and brown, neat hair with straight bangs that cover her forehead. Her eyes are playful, blue. She looks pale, but has reddened cheeks from her make-up.
MJ turns back to him, her dark, greenish-brown eyes looking right into his. Just, for a small moment, Peter almost expects her to lean forward for a kiss. But there’s still a slight disappointment when she doesn’t. Instead, she just studies him, suddenly reaching her hand towards his hair and passing her fingers through them.
Peter groans when he stands back up. He needs something to drink, to clear his throat a little bit. He slowly limps towards the kitchenette. There he takes out a glass, which he fills with some water. Leaning against the counter, Peter slowly drinks it up, eyes rested on his cellphone in his hands.
“Oh, like old times!” Peter calls out, walking out of his Dad’s reach to join Steve at the table, where he takes the box with his preferable pizza and carries it to the couch. Steve sits down next to him, grabbing the remote control and pointing it at the screen.
“I don’t care,” Tony returns. “If I have to give the people what they want all the time, I should better just go back to making weapons. Some things are just not supposed to be made, especially things that require an actual AI to function.”
“I’m coming!” Tony then calls out. He wishes his reflection luck before heading towards the living room, where he finds Steve seated on the couch with one spot left for him. Tony doesn’t hesitate, sitting down on the couch and leaning his head against Steve’s shoulder. Steve, in turn, rests his head on top of Tony’s, and together the two watch the happenings of the world. Of course, it never gets better. Every day there’s another drama out there. But, finally, Tony’s able to say that he officially can no longer do anything about it. Retired and resting, that’s what he’s supposed to be. There’s a new Iron Man around there (though it’s actually a girl and she goes with the name
He brings it up during dinner, a few hours after school ended. Peter is sitting in front of Vision, who is once again devouring his third portion of dinner. Bruce is calmer, taking small bites and making sure not to burn his tongue. Tony, though, is barely eating, instead just poking around on his tablet and making notes in a book.
“Boys, would you maybe mind fetching another table from downstairs? You can ask a few of the others if they could help with some chairs.”
“You know what?” Harry starts. “You got some kick-ass weapons. How about you head towards MJ and make sure she doesn’t get herself killed?”
to do it this way, but it’s mostly because he’s never done it any differently. He doesn’t want to change into one of those guys that get everything handed to him on a silver platter.
“I’m just glad you’re alright,” Peter answers truthfully. He can’t lose his father before the man even knows they’re related. And he would rather not lose him afterwards, either.
He’s aware there’s music playing, aware that he’s dancing and that everybody’s watching and screaming in excitement. There’s a flash of purple somewhere in the crowd – is that Yaël? She came!
“I guess he doesn’t really want to share things like that,” Felicia returns. Then she makes an abrupt turn towards a door, leading Peter inside. “Here we are.”
“For crying out loud, Strange, lift the spell or he’s going to keep up this tantrum!” the other man finally shouts at him. Strange gives him an annoyed look, but eventually
“U-huh,” Peter hums out as he looks over the last few math-exercises. They don’t look too hard, really.
“You need to identify yourself, genius,” Gwen jokes, walking forward and pressing her wrist against some sort of screen. Then there’s a beeping sound, and the door finally open.
“Wrong answer, Parker,” she tells him. Then she blocks his way, crossing her arms as she stares him down. Peter sighs and throws his arms up in the air.
“This, uh…” Steve starts, but he seems speechless. Tony, too, doesn’t really know how to get himself out of this one. The Avengers hate him, there’s nothing much he can change about that.
The suit kicks out. It’s a surprise to both Steve and Peter. And as Peter kicks Steve right in the groin, the super soldier releases his hold on him, instead falling on his knees with a red face, looking pained.
“I, uh… I said something I shouldn’t have said to Tony, and he took it badly,” Peter says quietly. With a nod, he knows that she will listen to him. So, without any hesitation, he starts talking.
Slowly, he gets dressed into loose clothing and gets out of the bathroom. With a heavy heart, he heads to the living room. One short look at his dad standing in front of the window is enough to tell Peter that the guy is about ready to flip out on him.
“Sharon, if you think that this is the right thing to do, then you should do it. If you say SHIELD’s back, I believe you. Of course, I’m going to keep tabs on them, obviously.”
His hands are stuffed in his pockets, and his hair is slowly getting wet from the drops falling into it. He’s only aware that there’s a tear rolling out of his eyes when his eyes actually start to sting.
Looking at the yellow, happy flowers, Tony can’t help but smile. He can recognize Steve’s style in there immediately. It’s in the perfect, neat lines, the little attention to detail. Tony loves everything about this artwork, even if it’s public property.
“Tony?” Steve asks, obviously worried at his partner’s silence. Tony lets out a loud sigh, turning back towards Steve with dark, expressive eyes.
,” a voice says through some sort of intercom. Steve, who is now walking in the front, stands still. Tony keeps his hand raised, ready to shoot. Barnes is doing the same thing, looking into the capsule next to him. The person inside has been shot in the head. “
“I missed you, Steve,” Peter admits. “I know I might not say it like that, but… you’re my dad, too. You know that, right?”
Though they both had hoped that Peter wouldn’t betray them like that. Sadly, it seemed like he came home one day without warning them. And just as FRIDAY was warning them about his arrival, he’d already heard it. He’d already seen it, too. It’s not that hard if you’re trying to be risky and are going for some good make-out in the kitchen.
“I just want to know how you figured it out?” Peter asks in confusion one he found his voice again. This had not been his plan at all; he should have just delivered the pizza and get out of there. It’s already past ten and he wants nothing more than to get back home and go to sleep. It’s already going to be a difficult weekend for him; he’s not sure if he can really handle this, too.
Peter jumps up from the couch. He hurries after her, ignoring the shoe-stain he already made on the leather by doing so.
Tony agreed on Peter keeping it if he continued his training, but that possibility also disappeared as soon as they realized Natasha has gone under as well. Leaving only small messages that say she’s doing fine, there’s not much else they hear about it. Peter just sticks to training against a dummy for the few times he joins Tony at the compound.
“You like them?” Wade asked. “I promised I’d get you some beautiful plates and these fit with your dark soul.”
After she asks him for all the news on his current situation, he brings her up to date, firstly by confirming that the test came in positive. Since she’s the person he’s going to ask for help for, he figures he should give her the whole story. With that, he doesn’t keep secret that his father is in fact Tony Stark himself.
Tony snorts a bit. “Yeah, well… I was… discontent when the Avengers were back together and I gave myself a time-out. But, after Thanos… the things that have happened back there… Slowly I’d rather have nothing to do with it anymore, really.”
! You really couldn’t convince Harry to move in with you?” Tony continues, taking one of Peter’s sweaters out of the closet and adding it to the pile.
He goes to the kitchen, still finding nobody. Right, maybe Johnny’s in his room. He carefully goes to the door that leads to Johnny’s room. With just a second of hesitation, he knocks on the door and waits for an answer.
He keeps on being surprised at how awesome Tony’s cars are. He hopes that one day, he’ll get to have one like this, too. Maybe a bit smaller, though. He doesn’t need something too big.
“I prefer Politically Correct Queen of the Universe,” Felicia adds to it jokingly. MJ gives her a short look before winking.
“I’ll take care of it,” Tony assures her. Natasha gives him a worried look, but she nods to agree. Then she returns to the others, probably to tell them to get back to their respective floors. Tony isn’t staying long enough to listen to it. He gets to the door of Peter’s bedroom, remembering enough how he walked inside this room almost every day in the past two weeks, missing his boy’s presence.
But Tony put a hand on his forehead dramatically, making a faint noise. “Oh, no, I’m too weak. I can’t stand on my feet! It’s too much!” he joked. Steve rolled his eyes, but rather than pushing on, he just picked Tony up, causing for the genius to start shaking his legs.
The only bad thing about Liz’ neighborhood? The lack of tall buildings. With absolutely nowhere to shoot his webs at, he finds himself stranded on the ground, meaning that his journey to the blue explosions has just become a whole lot harder.
And Steve does understand, though in the extend that is possible. There’s no way for him to get what exactly is going on in Bucky’s mind, but he can try and get it, right?
Then, suddenly, Steve moves up, grabbing Tony’s face in his hands and turning him back until they’re looking at each other. Their eyes meet, Steve shakes his head.
Reed reaches for the book again, his eyes reading through the pages once more while he pulls up his pensive face. Ben just… stares for a bit.
“Two men, they introduced themselves as Professor X and Nick Fury,” Yaël explains, as if that’s the most boring thing in the world. Instead, Peter’s mouth falls open in surprise upon hearing those names.
“Of course, I’ll see you later, Spider-Man,” Captain America says, saluting Peter before jogging away from him in the direction Hawkeye took. Peter casts one short look at where Yaël had been standing, only to find she’s no longer there. She must have taken off, gotten away from the battle. It’s too bad, her powers would have been helpful. Wade, on the other hand, seems to have been especially
exhausting. It’s always been, trying to keep up that front, that image he built up. Right now, he could just use an entire week of just being Tony. Tony the greasemonkey who needs his Steve by his side. Tony the engineer who likes to tinker along with his son.
That makes Tony frown; he thought Peter was here? Or does that mean that he’s still asleep? Why would he still be sleeping? It’s almost past noon, Peter’s usually awake around nine?
Eventually, Tony comes shuffling into the room. He’s wearing an old bathrobe, his feet stuffed into slippers Peter recognizes as Steve’s (since Tony doesn’t wear that). His face looks pale, and his eyes seem tired. To be honest, he looks horrible.
“I would say that’s more Strange’s area of expertise, Miss Stacey,” Tony says. That’s when he notices Peter standing there as well. He doesn’t startle, but he does frown. “I see Venom is back?”
“Fine, then we don’t go in at the same time. I figure if we’re going to make the flight, we might as well do it together?” Tony asks, facing Steve again. The super soldier just sighs, shakes his head and rubs his hand over his brow. One lick of his lips is indication enough of his indecisiveness. “What is it, Steve? You’re ashamed of telling her about it? Then we just don’t say it, simple. Though it’s not like she’s going to remember afterwards if we tell her anyway.”
Suddenly, he’s pulled into an extremely strong hug. He shouldn’t even be surprised by Steve’s reaction, though the breath is still stolen out of his lungs. After a small moment of shock, Tony manages to put up another smile and gently taps Steve on the back.
“Aaaah! Why are all the hot ones always taken?” she asks in frustration. Steve just finds himself glaring at Tony.
“Who said it was me?” Wade yelled back, not sounding sincere at all “It could’ve been Yaël or Scott too!”
“If I see a situation pointed south… I can’t ignore it,” Steve then says. He’s still sitting on his chair, unmoved. “Sometimes I wish I could.”
“No, I was only dropping off my backpack. I’m going swinging for a little moment,” he says, pointing his thumb towards the city underneath them. Bruce nods, giving him a light smile. When he holds out his hand, Peter gives him the bag, quickly taking out his badge to make sure he’ll get inside.
“Of course,” he says. Nakia, too, comes to shake his hand. Okoye, ever the warrior she is, only nods from where she’s standing. Just for one short second, her attention is gone from the king to him, only to revert back to its normal settings right after that. Tony doesn’t take insult.
“Peter flipped out and almost beat a guy to death,” Clint says shortly. Everybody glares at him for his crude way of describing it. “What, that’s what happened, isn’t it?”
“No-nothing, really. It’s just… I would have expected you here? Aren’t you, like, extremely mad at me or something?”
Peter’s first instinct is to say ‘no’. It’s probably not a good idea for Tony to know about this, since he’ll just get worried even more than before. But… Peter also realizes all his problems have started because he never really tells anybody anything.
,” FRIDAY clarifies, and Tony clears his voice once more before nodding, waiting for the screen on the desk to light up. Then Mary’s familiar face suddenly fills the glass. She looks a little bit older than how he remembers her, but not much.
“Yes, sir,” he then says, figuring he should at least try to talk a little. He notices Mr. Stark look straight at him, seeming worried. When Peter tries to look away, he suddenly notices something on the man’s right hand.
“No, you see? Mary wrote here that, somehow, she knew Peter would be bitten when he’s older. Now there’s no possible way for her to know that other than-“
“Fair enough. What do you want, though? For me to create complete bullshit like a toaster? Don’t you guys remember the reaction we got when the Starkbucks came out?”
Now, he knows it’s Ned. Because Ned has selected his own personal ringtone on Peter’s phone. While everybody has the tone Gwen chose all that time back, Ned has his own little tune that would warn Peter immediately that it’s him. It was
They don’t stop. Instead, they even involve the biggest man-child of them all; Barton. Natasha catches them talking about it during breakfast (great conversation material…), during training, and during simple relax-time.
Sometimes Steve was confused and tried looking for answers, so Yaël put on documentaries about same-sex marriages or about people coming out for their love. At these moments, Steve was so indulged by all of it, Yaël just did chores while he stared at the screen, frowning, his hands put together in front of his mouth so his thumbs unwittingly scratched his lips and his elbows leaned on his knees.
“An Avengers-call isn’t something you just put on mute, FRI!” Tony complains, rubbing his eyebrows while leaning on his elbows. He’s aware of Steve looking at him, but he tries to ignore it as much as he can. “What’s the emergency?”
“Thor has requested the Avengers’ presence. I thought I’d get you personally,” Steve explains. Tony crosses his arms, gazing at Steve unbelievingly.
“I’m not sure, I woke up somewhere in an alleyway and I’m trying to get out,” Eddie responds. He slowly gets back up, shaking his aching shoulders loose before turning back towards Peter. His blue eyes meet his (behind the mask) and he gives him a light smile. “You’re the Spider-Man, aren’t you? The real one?”
So Steve leans forward a bit, holding out his hand towards the people on the front row and shaking theirs.
“Not now, FRI. U and Id-Jit, you two get the camera ready and start up a new log. Day twenty-five, bleeding edge armor ready for injection, test one.”
“Well, this was surely the start of something…” he answered, not finishing his sentence as he scratched his head, like he was hesitant to say it.
The Captain didn’t move or say anything for a second, completely flabbergasted, like he was staring at a ghost. So… Fury nor X had talked to him already. Did Yaël just accidentally mess up Fury’s plans?
“Blood would be the most convenient, but I suppose hair would do as well,” Mrs. Cho explains. Of course, I would rather have your father consenting to this, as well, though I suppose you’re wanting to keep this quiet, if I’m correct?”
They’re only fifteen minutes in, and Peter already feels like the entire back of his head is soaked from Flash’ nasty spit all over his hair. What he would do right now to take a shower. He hasn’t felt so uncomfortable as right now.
Yeah, no, afraid that Yaël would accidentally convert them as well and accidentally start a Norse cult, they all stay clear, and she doesn’t have to bother with the drama.
No, he knows that, if he wants to find anything, he needs to go to Wilson. And he knows just how he’s going to do that.
“Sure, no more big bad guys for me. I’m sticking to the creeps of New York,” Peter assures him. Steve ruffles Peter’s hair and takes his fist step away.
“It’s not just that, Peter,” Tony stops him, sounding like he’s giving up his act of being alright. He looks miserable, ready to start crying or something like that.
Arriving at an empty house, Peter finds a note on the table from Aunt May, telling him she’s got another series of night shifts for the next five days. Peter sighs, dropping the piece of paper back on the table and trying to think back of the last time he actually spent time with her. He thought that the internship would at least help out a bit on the working-part, but seeing as Peter has not been accepted by any college yet, Stark Industries can’t release the sum for now. Their bills stay the same, as much as their income – though Peter earns a tad bit more at Stark Industries in comparison to the Pizza place.
And to make it worse, Mr. Toomes insists on driving them, apparently going out of town anyway. If that isn’t enough indication that something is wrong, Peter doesn’t know.
“I’m plenty interested in it if means saving my son,” Tony admits. Rhodey nods, giving him a small smile before squeezing his shoulder gently.
go through the balcony? He can easily jump down from the roof, get inside through there. It would just be written off as a very daring and risky move?
“Yeah?” Steve agrees, realization only dawning on him then. “Oh, I get it. You’re afraid she’s going to try and steal your stuff and sell it afterwards?”
“Live to be a rebel, my man,” Johnny returns. “That’s how I got my powers, after all. Sis went on a space trip, and I just followed her.”
Peter rolls his eyes. “Sure, whatever,” Peter mutters out. “Listen, I’m already having a pretty shitty week, so unless you have some actual good news, I’d rather just head back to bed if that’s alright?”
“Uh, wanted to hang, I suppose. Got a bit nervous,” Peter answers. She would know why he would be nervous, but he hopes she won’t bring the issue up. It’s not time for even Steve Rogers to know that Tony Stark has a son.
“Oh my God, Peter, are you alright?” she asks. Peter leans his head forward until it’s resting against her shoulder. It’s a moment of respite before he realizes it’s not over.
“Good, I need to show this to Peter later on.” Tony gets himself another glass of water before dropping back down on the couch. He doesn’t take his eyes off his guests that are currently making way too much noise. “Say, how is he doing back there?”
“What the…?” Tony asks. He doesn’t think more after that. Doesn’t even wait for Steve to give his permission to pick up. He just does, pressing the phone against his ear. “Peter?! How did you get this number?”
“Did I tell you that I love you?” Steve asks. Tony takes in the face in front of him; that once so smooth skin now decorated with wrinkles, that chin now having a permanent stubble that he’s since long given up to constantly shave. His once fair, light hair now grey, almost white. Tony doesn’t know how he’s ever gotten this lucky.
Peter tries to focus on the person standing there, but he can’t see who it is. “Yeah, I bet. Should I go and say hi?”
that Tony is Peter’s father, but somehow the shock doesn’t seem as big to him as he thinks she would have expected.
Steve’s angry. Everybody’s angry. More often than not they’ve yelled at him that he needed to get out of there, that he should listen to Steve or Tony. But Peter’s just tired of the way they’re treating him; like he can’t handle himself. He’s faced Thanos along with them! Why wouldn’t he be able to handle a stupid gigantic robot?
“Steven Grant Rogers, I am so very much in love with you,” Tony whispers against his mouth. Steve’s not really used to him being so affectionate, but he can surely get used to this.
Tony stays quiet for a moment. Then Peter hears him sigh. In the background, there’s a second voice. Is that Steve?
Tony then finally turns around again, feeling like he’s glaring right at Steve, but not caring about it.
Tony starts, but then he’s suddenly slammed to the side. The crazy dude has returned, looking annoyed at being disturbed like that. Peter freezes on the spot when the man starts walking back his way, hands ready to throw whatever spell he can think of at him.
by the Goblin. Our point to this mission was to start giving him the first feel of self-defense.” At that, she points at Peter, who feels his mouth drop open. He wants to say something in return, but after Wanda puts her hand on his wrist, he stops himself from speaking up.
The reading slows down a bit after school picks up again. He takes them to classes, and spends most of his time just reading through them, missing whatever the teacher’s trying to teach him. About a week after receiving the journals, they have passed five years give or take. Peter knows he’s getting close to the end, because this is about the time that they disappeared. Up until now, nothing more has been said about Mr. Stark – it’s like his mother just completely banished him from her life. Meanwhile, their study with the spiders with Dr. Connors seems to have advanced, even though his mother has taken a little step back from it to take care of Peter. Somehow, once again, Peter finds a few pages missing, and by then he wonders what his mother would probably not have wanted in written evidence.
“Last time I tried this, it was only a few minutes,” Strange admits. “I can’t take us all to where the Asgardians find Thanos in space. That’s too far. But I can go a few days. Enough for us to face him before he gets to the Aether and the Orb.”
“Peter, are you feeling any pain?” Tony asks. He’s reaching his hand forward, feeling Peter’s forehead for a few seconds. Peter shakes his head.
Of course Yaël did know who it was. She quickly threw the sponge back into the sink and walked to the door. There was no time for awkwardness, anger or disappointment, as soon as Yaël opened the door, Steve took her in his arms and hugged her tightly.
“Oh, uhm, I’ve been having a lot of training with Widow in the past few months,” he offers. It’s lame, but it’s something, right? MJ just nods but doesn’t say anything in return. Instead, she gets up from her spot, grabbing Peter’s hand and pulling him back up again.
“Okay, why are you stealing radioactive material,” Peter calls out, immediately alarmed after receiving Karen’s information. The girl gives him a confused look at that.
“Holy crap, that’s intense,” she admits. “It sucks that SHIELD keeps these things hidden from us.” Tony just shrugs in response and takes the tablet back from her.
I'm pretty sure scholarships don't really work this way; I have absolutely no idea how the American school-system works, no matter how much research I do on it. It's probably even still too early for Peter to try and get the scholarship, but after watching Homecoming we changed the story to fit Tom Holland's version into it. The first version of the story picked up after Amazing Spider-Man 2, where Peter graduated but DIDN'T go to college.
FRIDAY says, and Peter hears the dialing tone coming up in his ear. He pulls his hood over his head and leans his elbows on his desk as he waits for the man to pick up.
“I’ll try and stay away,” Peter returns. Then he kisses Tony on the cheek and runs into his room. He needs to let Ned know, immediately! But before he disappears, he turns back towards the table. “Oh, and by the way, Ned and Harry are coming over tomorrow evening, are you home then?”
Peter shrugs. He can’t really explain; it’s been like this since the funeral. Tony and Steve just… don’t seem to speak to each other anymore. Whatever happened, it almost feels like they’re getting close to just end it between them. Peter really thinks that’s the worst thing that could happen, given how different Tony has been with Steve around…
Then he stops, eyes meeting Sharon’s, who is trying to act like the name doesn’t bother her. Tony hasn’t heard from the kissing experience on her side, but then again, she wouldn’t exactly go to
The team is nearly nothing like it used to be. There’s Clint having taken in a young girl Peter’s age (Tony thinks her name is Kate) who appears to be just as skilled at archery as him (he calls her his ward, which is just ridiculous but at the same time
“Peter, get out of here!” Tony shouts when he catches Peter pulling off a few stones from somebody’s trapped leg. The boy shakes his head, pulling off his clothes and revealing his black suit underneath the moment the guy limps away. Before Tony can stop him, he’s already heading towards Otto’s invention.
“Oh, crap! I knew I shouldn’t have partied with Wade last night,” she mutters. Steve chuckles, then. “How long have you been here, by the way?” she then asks the other man, who in turn shrugs in response.
“Uh, bitten by a radioactive spider at Oscorp is all I can give about my superhero origin-story,” Peter shrugs. “But if it’s alright with you, I need to head back towards the workshop; still need to work, even if my boss is my father.”
They’re in an open field when the phone starts vibrating against his leg. Steve tries to ignore it, running as fast as he can behind Natasha who keeps up a surprising speed that matches his own. He would never have thought her to be so fast.
“You don’t know that!” Peter shouts out, slapping the hands on his shoulders away angrily. His throat hurts from raising his voice. His eyes sting, though he’s sure that’s probably an after-effect from almost being choked to death by his former best friend. “It’s the reason he’s here, isn’t it? To get him BACK?!”
“Everything’s pretty much sealed off at Oscorp. Even I don’t have full access to it,” she warns him.
Training with Peter is good distraction. He talks about school, about senior prom being planned too much ahead of time. Natasha listens, sometimes uses his distractedness for her advantage. Peter takes the blows, avoiding most of them. Training has changed much now that they all know he’s actually Spider-Man. And
Hanging out with Natasha was easier. She was this sort of woman that wouldn’t take his crap. She would kick his ass at any given moment, and she would die to keep your secrets. Granted, Natasha Romanoff was easily the most secretive person in the world, and it was pretty hard to get a read on her. While Steve knew pretty much every member of the Avengers’ backgrounds, Natasha remained pretty vague, still.
“Oh come on, you again?” he asks Michelle, who just glares at him with her greenish-brown eyes. Then she drops her food at the seat next to him, and drops down without saying a word. Ned and Peter observe her with a confused stare as she starts to mix her sauces together until she gets one nasty looking brown goo.
enjoy having sex. Terrence here, for instance. Or Mathilda, too.” At that, Heather points towards two people who wave up their hand to remind Peter of who she’s talking about.
There’s no other explanation! The dude wasn’t there when Peter came in from work, and the girl that actually had to take the man’s order passed along to Peter that the dude’s crazy. Still, Peter’s hungry, and he figures that he might as well just bring a pizza along to eat after this delivery. His shift has almost ended anyway, and he can just park the damn Vespa when he returns home, because it’s about time that he learns what this guy’s deal with him really is so it’s possible that it’s indeed going to take a while..
“And Stark?” If Yaël’s previous question had already been a bad one, this one seemed to be even worse.
It’s been only a week, but it felt like much longer. With school and the internship combined, he already had so little time to just do this, but he has a free day, today, so he’s going to make the best of it. So Peter does his usual patrol, swinging above New York and dropping down whenever he sees something that isn’t alright.
“Steve Rogers, I love you so fucking much,” Peter hears Tony mutters against Steve’s lips. George protests jokingly that he needs to watch his language around the kids, but nobody listens to it as the pair kisses again and again. The bags with presents is now on the ground, Tony’s arms thrown over Steve’s shoulders while the Super Soldier holds Tony on the hips. Peter decides that it’s enough for now. He runs towards the couple and clears his throat.
excited the moment Peter shared the news. Harry and Johnny are coming, and so are Yaël and Wade. Wanda and Vision already live at the compound, so it’s obvious they’ll be there as well.
She saw the teenager stare at her hair while mumbling something to Wade about bringing his own pizza so he’d have something to eat if Wade started to probe him.
“People of Asgard, and our beloved guests,” Thor then starts, facing the audience. “I present to you; the new Queen of Asgard, and the new keeper of Mjölnir.”
“Okay, Peter, I know that what you’re seeing seems real, but it’s not. It’s me, Tony Stark. You know I won’t hurt you, Peter.”
“You, mister Stark, are an idiot,” she says. Peter then does clear his throat before pulling Natasha’s feet up and making his escape from the couch. They don’t comment on it, luckily, and allow him to make his escape to his room.
But he’s also in love with her boyfriend. Which is why it’s difficult not to hate him at least a little bit.
“No, no, nothing happened. I was just… messing around in the workshop and lost track of time,” he admits. Clint chuckles at that.
“Hey, man! We’re about to jump on that ginormous spaceship, you wanna come?” Korg explained shortly, immediately trusting the Trickster.
They mourned together, but while Aunt May managed to pick up work at the hospital again, Peter found an anger inside himself that he couldn’t contain. He started training on his powers, tried to get to know them. He built his web-shooters, put together a suit with the limited knowledge he had, and set off to search for any criminal that fit the description of his uncle’s murderer.
Three days left until Infinity War here in Belgium. I'm all kinds of nervous! Anyway, another update, because that damn deadline is getting closer and closer!
“Right,” Steve sighs, putting his hand on his forehead. “God, I’m so useless, it’s so embarrassing.”
When he hears his dad’s footsteps coming closer in a fast rate, Peter decides it’s best to just start running, despite the pain in his side. He leaves Stark Tower behind him, running into a street and practically throwing himself into the first taxi he sees.
Peter stays quiet and looks down to the ground. There’s an uneasy feeling going through his chest and he starts shaking his head, not wanting to think back to Gwen’s lifeless body in his arms.
Peter gets to what looks like a working desk. Gently, he picks up a few papers with notes on them, reading through the formulas and explanations of what seems to be Dr. Octavius’ latest project. In the corner of his eyes, he can read Oscorp’s name written on most of the papers, meaning that they must be sponsoring the man.
“Okay, open your eyes,” X whispered. “I adjusted the language so I’m able to understand what’s happening here.”
“Well, well, look who decided to finally show up!” she says. Then she turns towards the other woman, patting her on the shoulder. “I told you they’d beat the Guardians, Sif. Pay up.”
“JEZUS FUCKING CHRIST!” Yaël suddenly screamed, way louder than the other men. “ARE YOU ALL IDIOTS?! I TALK TO YOU GUYS AND YOU ALL SUDDENLY THINK WE HAVE A ROMANCE?!” Wade looked at her, picked her up, threw her over his shoulder and carried her outside while she kept screaming. “I HOPE ALL OF YOU WILL END ALONE! BURN IN HELL! ANY OF YOU FUCKING PRICKS MOVE AND I’LL EXCECUTE EVERY MOTHERFUCKING LAST ONE OF YA-”
Peter gives him a glare. Tony just sticks out his tongue while pressing the phone to his ear. Not long after that, the other person on the line picks up.
Finally, when his vision is back to the way it’s supposed to be, Tony reaches for the fridge to get out the bottle of water. It’s too late for coffee, and they don’t really have much else in the house anymore. So Tony gets himself a glass of water, walks towards their bedroom and sits down on the bed while he searches trough his nightstand.
JARVIS explains. Tony sighs. He should have known, there’s nothing in the workshop indicating anything related to the Avengers, after all.
Next to the compliments, she understood the med-thing. She had forgotten her sleeping-pills that night too and that had given her even more complications than just waking up next to her friend. Not that she was minimalizing his reaction, though.  His pills-flaw just gave him a totally different error than hers, though they both ended very emotional after that situation.
“You couldn’t wait a few minutes longer?! I know you’re worried but damn, Steve, if they catch us now you can forget about getting to New York!”
He’s just tired, beat. Ready to head for the land of the dreams for a few hours. Away from consciousness.
When Peter realizes that he’s having a bit of difficulty at stopping with the sudden crying, Mr. Morita offers him a tissue. Fully ashamed, Peter dabs his eyes dry, head pointed down to avoid eye-contact with anybody.
It lasts for too long. Even with the small toilet breaks X requested (probably after having read too many thoughts), Peter feels like he’s about ready to climb up the walls. Literally, with the next break he’s running towards the side of the room and climbs up until he’s hanging over the ceiling.
“Thanks,” he says, though still out of breath. “Are you two over there already agreeing that you’re not going to win against me?”
“But you love being an Avenger?” Peter asks, sitting up at last to give Tony a long look. The man simply sighs and shakes his head.
"Well, then we shouldn't keep the lady waiting," Steve said as he headed for the door, breathing in an extra deep breath once they were back outside on the sidewalk. He kept his hand on Peter's shoulder as they crossed the street, finding Gwen waiting for them with her father just inside the lobby of the station. Steve had to hide his grin at the look on Gwen's face when she saw Peter, and realised what he was carrying, something that didn't escape Chief Stacy's notice either.
Tony inhaled a deep breath through his nose before responding, trying to keep his blood pressure steady enough to finish the call without popping a vessel or something. They had been going round and round for over an hour, which was well past Tony's limit of being diplomatic with government idiots. Especially Senator Davis.
If they hadn't been in Wakanda, and had access to the best medical technology in the entire world, then—
"Looks good to me, Uncle Bucky!" Peter said, squinting as he examined the new hologram. "I don't see anymore dust in there. Dad?"
Tony gasps in surprise, and so do the other Avengers. Everybody seems confused about what’s happening. Is Steve seriously kissing him in front of the entire world to see? There are reporters nearby, after all!
Tony clears his throat. He tries to shift in the bed, but accidentally bumps his arm against the nightstand. He lets out a curse.
FRIDAY asks. Peter hums in thought, looking down at his shoes as he tries to come up with some things.
much. Believe it or not, I might have looked stuff up on the internet about… uh, ‘relationship troubles’. I found this thing on ‘how much do you know your partner’-crap, and realized I couldn’t even fill in half of these questions.”
The perfect example is at the dinner table. May and Rhodey are there as well, giving each other quick smiles and awkward glances that make Peter want to roll his eyes. On the other side of the table, there's Natasha and Bucky, the two of them looking a bit out of place as they observe the happenings around them.
“Is that Peter’s other dad?” Bruce asks. Tony feels something uneasy in his stomach as Bruce says the words, but he can’t deny that it’s the truth. Despite not being related by blood, the man still partially raised Peter up to a point.
“But you’re right. I’ve never been there for you before,” Tony says lowly, a soft shiver in his voice. “Who am I to tell you what to do?” Behind Peter, Steve takes a deep breath, clearly preparing himself for the rest of their evening together.
“C’mon, Cap, it’s not because Stark’s not here that you have to take over that overprotective behavior of his? The kid says he’s fine, he’s fine and that’s that.”
“Dad is in medical? Is he okay?” Peter asks, surprised by the news. He hadn’t even noticed that Tony was injured! How much of a horrible son can he even be to have missed that?
“Not really, she seems somewhat in shock.” Then Sharon’s phone goes off again. A sigh comes from both of them as Tony closes the file again and locks the tablet once more. “Carter here.”
“HOW DO YOU EVEN DARE, I NEED WARM WATER, I KNOW I CAN WARM IT MYSELF BUT WHY DO I NEED TO DO THAT?! THAT’S WHAT BOILERS AND SHIT ARE FOR! I DIDN’T EVEN DO ANYTHING LAST NIGHT, WADE WENT CRAZY, NOT ME!” she left the flying tiles-part out, of course.
Peter doesn’t listen to what Mr. Stark is saying to the person on the other line. All he can see is Flash. While the guy is usually being all tough and ‘Mr. Strong’, right now he looks vulnerable, actually
Of course, Steve’s friends will always be the same. Even during their free time, combat seems to be their top priority, especially being prepared for it.
Not that he would have; Steve’s adoration for the Spider-Man almost equals his love for Peter; he wants to look out for him and teach him stuff. Steve would never intentionally hurt the boy.
Even now, he can only give her a light smile before heading out of the gym the moment the bell rings. Rolling his eyes towards Ned, he decides it’s best not to cause too much of a scene right here. It’s not like many of the students
“I’m about three years sober now, so…” he explains curtly. Realizing that she’s about to make a comment on it he quickly stops her. “Okay listen, your husband is working on genetically modified spiders, right?”
It’s going to be a mission to find Johnny in all this, somehow. Peter inspects every single person around him, but there’s only faces he doesn’t recognize other than maybe a few people from his class. Still, he doesn’t know them enough to just ask them if they’ve seen Johnny.
It’s when they’re off guard that they’re caught in the last explosion. It’s loud thundering, and Tony’s instinct kicks in immediately, jumping to the side and pushing Steve out of the way. With a grunt, they fall on the ground, Tony lying on top of Steve to protect him from the falling rubble. Before they know it, all that surrounds them is darkness, the only light around them being the reactor on the chestplate.
“You just wait here, I’ll be home as soon as I can,” Steve counters. He puts his hand on Tony’s hips as he pulls him closer. “And then we can have lots and lots of hot and steamy sex, okay?”
Tony groans and lifts up his hand to rub his brow, shaking his head a little bit. Taking a step back into the hallway, he points a finger towards Peter, and then Ned.
The one girl turns into another one. Until he’s dancing with another guy, instead. After that, it’s a whole group of teens. It’s never anything special, just two people turned towards each other, drinking and moving their bodies in the rhythm of the music. Peter barely even realizes it when his ‘dance partner’ disappears again and another one has taken their place.
“So…where the freaking freck on earth are we? And why can I steer all four elements if nobody else can do that?” The guy smirked at her.
“I don’t need advice,” Peter assures her. “I don’t even need anybody to listen. I’ve been telling about my problems for days now… I just- I want it to be over…”
“Is there a particular reason for this phone call?” Peter asks, taking a seat at a bench underneath a tree and taking out the few pages of his homework there. As he continues the call, he starts tapping his pen against the paper.
“Yeah, possessing that guy you mentioned that wanted to kick my ass,” Peter clarifies. Harry hisses.
Tony’s surprised by his own reaction. In the past, he would never have reacted that way to her, too in love to speak against her wishes. Now that he’s no longer head over heels for her he finds it’s kind of easy. A bit like talking to Pepper now.
“-we even thought him dead for long until he showed himself again during that Ultron-disaster! But Professor X! Man what’s it like, having him in your head?”
While she was still keeping her wall of tiles up with her hand, she simply stared at Wade, more specifically at the hand that was shooting around and aimed with her other hand.
Raido turned back to Yaël with fire in his eyes. “I will guide him towards a forgotten entrance into the city walls, but you’re not going with him!” Yaël looked back calmly, as she already made up her mind. “Dear, you know he won’t reach the king or queen without me.”
Peter scoffs. As if… For a moment he just wishes he could tell her, but the only three persons who know are Harry, who is still in Paris, Ned who is in MIT, and Johnny who is currently still pissing Peter off. Having a roommate was never supposed to be easy, everybody told him, but Peter’s just about ready to just buy a place of his own and stay there alone.
Steve isn’t really joining into the actual dancing like the others. Instead he just walks around, pretending to smell on his flower while he steps between the dancing couples. They all swirl around him, making it look even more like it’s a musical number.
.” Sure, Yaël didn’t like the accords either, but this wasn’t completely her problem, was it? She’d never be an Avenger, she just got locked up during the process, but they’d free her again afterwards, right?
“I would love to,” Steve says with a smile. He takes the glass from Tony, and the two clink it together before taking a swing. When Tony realizes just how much sugar must have been poured into this sweet drink, he squeezes his eyes shut. Steve, too, looks like he’s just sucked on a lemon.
Maybe he should just bail today, right? Stark didn’t look all that well today, either? Maybe they’re both just not… ready for it. Maybe they won’t ever be ready for it? Maybe it’s better if Peter just keeps this to himself, right?
“In the New York Sanctorum,” the other man says. He has a strong accent, so he mustn’t be from around here. “Where did you come from?”
There’s ringing in his ears, and a pressure in his eyes. Tony’s teeth are clattering as he looks at the scene before him. Is it him, or is he shaking?
“Umpf,” Tony complains, leaning his head forward until it’s resting on the counter, right next to his still-full plate of scrambled eggs and bacon. Steve gives him a poke in the arm to get him back up, but Tony slaps his hand away automatically. After that, he decides to just ignore him.
“Andrew,” the little red-haired boy says, grey eyes giving him a sad look. Peter lets out a short breath before squeezing his shoulder shortly.
“That’s a good way to go; trying to stand your own in this world. I can admire that, Peter,” Steve tells him, and Peter feels a little bit of shame at the praise. It’s not because he
“Does the signal need to be continuous? Or is just one ‘beep’ of it enough?” Peter asks, holding in a giggle when the marker travels over his stomach.
Peter sighs, a bit tired of the secrets his dad seems to be having. Whatever really happened during the war, it seems like nobody really wants to include the ones that weren’t involved. It’s sad that even Bruce isn’t included in this.
All of which meant that by the time they finally got back to the repaired car, it was not only almost dark outside, but none of them had eaten anything since breakfast. After stopping to buy just enough food to tide Peter and Steve over until they could get home, Steve had insisted that Tony and Peter rest while he made them a dinner big enough for the entire team, complete with appetisers and dessert.
“Oh, don't give me that diversifying crap!” Obie snapped!  “Tony, we’re weapons manufacturers!  It’s what we do best!  Anything else is just… gratuitous, and—!”
"Steve, Pete is fine, I asked JARVIS to check on him on my way up here," Tony assured him. "And just because Beck was using this drug doesn't mean that—"
Another sentiment that Steve could now understand. The weeks that he and Tony had spent in uncertainty that Peter would ever recover from his injuries sustained during the Miami battle had been even more tortuous than his captivity in the HYDRA bunker, and something that Steve absolutely never wanted to go through again. Like Tony, Peter was a part of Steve's very soul, and to lose him would be to lose one of the best parts of himself.
"Very well," said T'Challa. He pressed his finger to his ear, contacting his security people. "At my signal, open northwest section seventeen."

“I solemnly swear that I am up to no good,” Peter whispered as he flipped his pencil around his thumb, his eyes trained on the progress bar at the bottom of his screen.  After finding Dad conked out at his workstation in the lab when he woke up that morning, and then watching as he spent the entire day holed up in the lab and getting more and more frustrated over not finding what he apparently needed to find, Peter had finally convinced him that he needed to take a nap for a bit.
"I'm fine, sweetheart," Steve said. "And for God's sake, you don't need to be worrying about me." He gave Tony's hand a gentle squeeze, the hand he'd barely let go of in the three or so days since the battle. "I'm not the one who's—who—"
Before, Steve could only watch his life as it passed him by, stuck in the shadows of mistakes he knew he’d never be able to fix.  Until one day, a boy just happened to wander into his store, and set Steve’s life on a completely new course.  One that in all of the thousands of books he had read over the years, he still never would’ve thought possible.  In about a year and a half, he went from a man who had been slowly dying inside, going out of his mind with the madness that would’ve eventually consumed him, into a man who, despite being so broken and faded, knew he was loved beyond reason.
Tony scoffed, rolling his eyes. "Move on," he said, practically spitting the words. "Funny of you to believe that there even exists such a thing. 'Cause there doesn't. Steve, I lost—I
"I see." Mr Stacy gave Peter a rather ominous smile. "And therein lies the problem, I think. With no oversight, what's to stop the Avengers from adding enough members to their roster until they have their very own army, hmm? And then what? Us laypeople are just supposed to accept it while they go about their merry avenging business? You may think that the Avengers are like rock stars, that everybody out there just adores them, but son, I assure you that that's not the case. Captain Rogers, Dr Banner, and that Thor guy who shows up from time to time, they're all enhanced individuals, and who's to say there aren't more of 'em out there who would just as soon snap someone's neck like a twig than protect us from invading aliens. Don't you think we should be able to know who those people are?"
As soon as Bruce and Scott were gone, Tony turned to Steve, tipping his forehead against his chest as Steve's arms curled around him, gathering him into his solid warmth.
Tony let out a heavy sigh that turned into another coughing fit, one that had Steve gritting his teeth by its end.
"On your left!" Steve called as he passed the cadets yet again, their awed murmurs spurring him on as he continued his punishing pace. Normally he would've been already done and headed for the showers, but he had built just enough of a buffer into his plan for that morning for one more lap.
"Body heat is a good thing at this point as well, Tony," Bruce said, now assisting Helen as she carefully wrapped Peter's right hand in the splint. "In a few minutes I'll increase the temperature of the water; we don't want to bring their body temps up too quickly or they can go into shock."
"You feel so good, Tony," he murmured as he trailed soft kisses all over Tony's cheeks and jaw, each sending bolts of pleasure throughout his body. "So hard to keep my eyes off you, so hard to keep my hands away. I don't—I don't want to let you go, I don't—"
Papa shook his head, his throat bobbing as he attempted a smile. He reached for Peter's hands, clasping them in his own.
But as soon as they sat down in the nearly-empty theatre, Gwen took Peter's popcorn and Dr Pepper from him and set them on the seat next to her, her green eyes blazing as she held Peter's hands between her own.
Which, if what he'd figured out a few minutes ago was correct, was actually impossible. He just hadn't worked up the courage to tell Dad yet.
"Am I to assume that you are not interested in replacing the drones, but rather upgrading them?" JARVIS asked.
And while it was still a bit unnerving to Steve to have two aliens—actually three, if he counted Thor's friend Rocket, the raccoon-like creature who for some reason insisted that he wasn't a raccoon—staying with them at the Compound, he was so grateful to them for convincing Tony to try and repair their ship that Steve gladly pushed all of his unease aside.
But Ned had barely made a turning-like move before he whipped back around, resting his chin on the back of his seat.
The thought of someone like Obie or that asshole Army general getting their grubby hands on something like the BARF glasses almost made Peter want to puke.
“Yes.  One of the HYDRA moles took it from the Triskelion before the helicarriers went down,” Steve says, a bit impatiently.
But Peter realising just how much of a coward he truly was was definitely on that list.  Probably one of the top three.
"Well, we'll just have to deal with that once we're there," Steve said. "And like Fury said, the Avengers will be there as diplomatic liaisons, so too much of a show of force might send the wrong message. But I won't hesitate to call for backup if I think it becomes necessary."
"Uhh," Tony muttered. He was well-used to going hours—even days—without food, but he had to admit in his current state he would likely be able to think a bit better if he had something to nibble on.
"Well, I'm sure it'll be a hard sell, but I don't see why we can't at least try," Tony said, winking. "You know how much Pete hates exploring new places."
More specifically, Schmidt’s right hand as he slaps it onto the water.  Which means that not only is Steve still with the charismatic German champion, he’s actually slightly ahead of him.
The room went silent for a moment, with Steve’s jaw sharp enough to cut glass and his hand trembling in Tony’s.
"It is, Peter, and they're called HYDRA," said Papa. "And everything that's happened since Project Insight has convinced me this was their backup plan all along. It's a lot slower and more involved than those giant helicarriers, but I think their objective is the same. They want to control people through fear."
"Oh, just another prank that Pietro and Wanda pulled on Uncle Clint while he was napping yesterday afternoon," answered Peter. "This time Wanda tried to film it, but Pietro's moving so fast all you can see is Uncle Clint's hair blowing in the breeze." He swallowed his mouthful, popping a stray marshmallow into his mouth. "Uncle Clint's face is pretty funny though. See?"
"Yeah, okay," he murmured as he followed Sam over to one of the public water fountains. He tried to stretch while they waited in line for their turn, shaking out his arms and stretching out his quads as he attempted to come up with yet another excuse for not wanting to buy season tickets to the Mets.
Peter studied the chessboard, contemplating if it was time to bring out his queen. "Thanks, Uncle Bucky," he said as he moved the queen, taking Uncle Bucky's other knight in the process. "I… needed to hear that."
"Approximately three, sir," answered JARVIS. "But be advised, the suit would only be able to withstand that amount of weight for exactly one hundred and twenty seconds, after which the legs would begin to buckle."
"Oh," Peter said, feeling like he'd just been punched in the gut. The last thing Papa needed was more fodder for his nightmares.
"Here, baby, let me," Tony murmured as he stilled Steve's hands, undoing both his belt and the button on his pants. He gasped as Steve quickly slid his hands down Tony's waistband to his ass, squeezing both cheeks before hoisting him up and onto the bed.
“No, it does not!” Peter said.  “It only means that you're completely innocent in this whole mess, and that you're also the only one who can put a stop to it!”
At least the physical therapy is working, even if his progress seems slower than molasses in January.  Unable to raise his hand above the level of his chin right before the surgery, at almost a month post-op Steve can now at least wash his own hair again.  He has to tip his head over to the left, but it still counts as a met goal in his PT regimen, and something both he and his hair appreciates.  His next goal of taking a quick jaunt around the block on his bike is still a few weeks away, but if Sharon’s praise after his session that morning is any indication, Steve is making steady enough progress that hopefully he’ll be able to meet that goal without too many issues.
"Here we go," Steve said under his breath as T'Challa took off running. A heartbeat later Steve took off as well, matching T'Challa stride for stride as the entire plain filled with the sound of thundering footsteps, drowning out the hair-raising snarl of the war dogs.
"Well, of course it's gonna work!" Phillips shot back. "When has anything of yours ever not worked?"
"They don't know how to see it," grumbled Uncle James. "No one knows how to goddamn see it, that's the problem. And I can't get anyone who'd actually know anything off of their goddamn golf courses long enough to come to the phone!"
Steve sniffed as Tony guided him back down onto the bed, sliding his leg across Steve’s waist to hold him as closely as possible.  Tony was right, it was still very dark outside.  But now that he was awake, he was suddenly very much aware of Tony’s half-naked body pressed up against him.
The custom-made box was the last gift his ma ever gave him, several months after she was diagnosed with the cancer that eventually killed her, and is easily one of Steve’s most cherished possessions.  Steve can remember the day she gave it to him like it was yesterday, the way she beamed with pride when she told him she had commissioned it from her wood-carver friend the morning after Steve won his individual medal.
"I'm trying!" Steve said through clenched teeth. He swiped his hand across his eyes, mentally kicking himself for his lack of concentration.
A second later the door to Bucky's simulator popped open and he poked his head out, eyeing Steve and Tony with an air of barely-concealed suspicious mirth as he climbed out.
"Yes, I'm sure that must've been difficult," Davis said, so incredibly patronising and with such false sincerity that Tony hands clenched into fists.
"No!" he said in the best rendition of his Captain's voice that he could muster. "I won't—I won't do it! I won't fight him, so you may as well let him go!"
"I have become rather adept at using this stone, Stark," Dr Strange said, rather arrogantly. "I highly doubt that would happen."
"Well, that's good," said Peter. "'Cause if we're gonna win this, then we've all gotta work together. Papa always says that a team can never win if the players are only thinking about themselves."
"All right, Cindy," Liz said, shuffling the stack of index cards in her hands. Peter had noticed that she hardly ever went anywhere without those index cards. "Give me three minutes on… the difference between a fastball and a curveball, describing the physics involved."
“See?” says Mags.  She places her hand on Tony’s shoulder, leaning closer.  “You know, my dear Lorenzo and I were married for fifty-five years before he passed, and every day I come in here I still expect to see him there in the back, yelling out orders just like he used to.  It’s been almost ten years now, and still not a single day goes by where my very bones don’t ache for missing him.  He was the love of my life, and everyone good deserves a love like that, Anthony.
And if he could build an arc reactor in a cave with nothing but a box of scraps, then he and Peter could certainly figure out the formula that produced this silly little particle. And while he still had no idea what he was actually going to use them for, if anything, Tony had always enjoyed a challenge. Especially one that allowed him to wipe the smirk off the face of a man he'd always despised.
"No, no, I don't think you're joking," said Steve. "I'm just really glad I wasn't one of those people."
"All right, now for your back," said Grandma, gently pushing him forward. She slid her stethoscope bell under his shirt, moving it four separate times as she listened to his lung sounds.
“Think I’m gonna duck out for a bit too, I need to check in with my superiors,” Rhodey said as Sam and Bucky made a beeline for the door.  “I have a feeling there’s gonna be a few questions for me to answer.”
And then on Monday, Steve was going back to his store.  Despite his realisation that he’d needed the break from it to focus on beginning his recovery, Steve had missed it terribly, and was very much looking forward to getting back to it.
"Yeah, that’d be nice," agreed Steve. "But if something were to happen again, then… it would kill me if some evil or corrupt government decided to go after Peter just because they knew he was so much smarter and stronger than the average person."
And now, after his colossal—and way too dramatic, thank you very much—washouts from both tennis and soccer, and with baseball out of the question for pretty much the same reason, the Emergency Room doctor’s suggestion of swimming is just about the only thing Peter has left.
"What's all this?" Tony asked as Steve's left arm slipped around his waist, pulling him close as he tucked Tony's left hand against his chest.
If he had been thinking more clearly when he got to the truck stop, he would've tried to find a truck whose doors were unlocked so he could've hidden in the back of the cab or something. But instead he had just jumped onto the first truck that he saw leaving in the right direction, and therefore was now stuck—both literally and figuratively—in the small space between the cab and the crate.
With an effort that could only be described as monumental, Steve pulled himself up to his feet, favouring his injured foot as he tried to stand as straight as possible. It was then that he happened to notice that he was dressed in some sort of uniform, complete with boots, fingerless gloves, and a cowl resting on the floor against the wall. Obviously modelled after his own Captain America uniforms, it was dark blue, battered and battle-worn, with a massive HYDRA crest across the chestplate and smaller crests on the outside of his arms, where his Avengers 'A' should've been.
If he was honest he probably should've figured it out a long time ago, given the fact that Steve was a pilot and all. Steve hadn't ever told him specifically what aircraft he flew, only that he flew patrols, which was pretty much what most of the pilots in the Air Corps did anyway, and since Peter hadn't been at all interested in hearing about Steve's work as a pilot they hadn't talked much about it since.

He trailed off, looking up at Tony. "You were right though. Based on what my source was able to find we've got over twice the amount of vibranium that's currently reported in the official records."
"Oh, and I have just received an incoming text message from Master Peter," added JARVIS. "He is very politely requesting that you feed his fish for him."
"And I've already told him the same thing," said Dad. He pressed his fingers to his lips, blowing Peter a kiss just like he always used to when he was little. "I love you, bud. I'll see you soon."
"Ah huh," whispered Tony as he aimed his repulsor, targeting one of his monitors. He felt the suit power up and the targeting system take aim, waiting for his command.
"Yes, sir," Steve said firmly. After almost ten years in the Air Corps Steve was well-used to Colonel Phillips's warnings. And his tendency towards hyperbole.
"What?" exclaimed the brooding, dark-haired pilot sitting next to Rogers in the front row. "What do you mean, 'exit the planet's atmosphere'?"
"Yeah!" Peter grabbed his notebook, flipping past a bunch of pages filled with line after line of what looked like gibberish—random letters, numbers, and symbols—until he came to an unfinished drawing of a bird's nest containing three eggs.
"Bring me Thanos!" he yelled as he suddenly shot up into the air, surrounded by blinding bolts of lightning. It seemed as though the entire country shook when he landed, the head of his axe slamming down onto the plain and sending most of the rest of the war dogs flying.
"So," Gwen said breathlessly once they broke apart. "Do you think we should see if we can find Aquarius too? It's not quite the right time of year for maximum visibility, but since your telescope is so nice, we just might—"
"He's my commanding officer, Tony," Steve cut in. "I can't ask him a direct question like that. It's insubordination."
Peter pursed his lips as he sighed, finally nodding. "Fine. I'm sure dinner's ready by now, so we should probably get into the kitchen before Uncle Thor eats it all."
"Now wait just a damn minute here!" retorted Sam. "I'm pretty sure that I never said anything about paying for all of—"
Stepping inside the room, Steve was greeted by a young boy, maybe ten or eleven years old, with probably the biggest and sweetest brown eyes that he had ever seen partially hidden by a mop of brown curls that hung across his forehead. The boy's skin was ghostly pale, nearly as white as the various bandages covering the three separate intravenous tubes attached to his skinny arms and neck, but he smiled politely as Steve approached him, letting out a weak, wet cough as he raised his hand to wave hello.
"Then let's move on to the building," Steve said. He clapped his hand on Bucky's shoulder. "Nice job, Buck."
"Yeah, I got that impression," said Steve. "I'd barely stepped inside his room and he was already wrinkling his nose at my uniform."
"No, I'm fine," Peter said. He swiped at his nose, rolling his eyes as he accidentally dislodged his nasal tubes. "Just talking to my dad."
But… that was impossible, wasn't it? Tony and Peter had both told Steve numerous times that despite everything that he'd seen in Star Trek, not even the greatest scientific minds in the world had managed to figure out how to safely teleport people yet.
"I thought you were supposed to go to a safehouse or something when your dads were out on missions," said Gwen. "Isn't that what you usually do?"
"Ma?" Steve whispered, gasping as none other than Sarah Rogers herself stepped out onto the street along with a small, young boy. The boy was dressed in a blue button-down shirt that was patched at both elbows and a pair of trousers that were both too large in the waist and too short in the legs, held up by a pair of dark brown suspenders.
With a final kiss, Steve grabbed one of the spare pillows, sliding it under Tony's hips before reaching for the lube. Tony bit his lip in anticipation as Steve warmed it between his fingers, nearly coming off the bed as Steve's index finger slowly slipped inside him.
And also the hundreds—if not thousands—of photographs he had taken since then. Steve absolutely loved the fact that even at age sixteen—and a half, as Peter liked to remind him—Peter never shied away from cuddling with his father.

"Well, I suppose that we can always work on your manners later," Hammer finally said. "Because you see, today is a very important day. The latest prototype of our new design is finally ready for testing, and I'm so excited that I can hardly contain myself! To see one of my own prototypes going up against the legendary Steven Grant Rogers, well, let me just say, I had to take a moment to collect myself before coming in here."
Not so Super: Tony tries to get used to being part super-soldier with the help of two other super soldiers.
The doctor’s not really here, Tony just made it up. He sighs, stretches his arms a bit and decides to just head for the toilet for a moment. But before he sits up, his eyes drop on the massive bruise that is now on his arm, where he just bumped it against the nightstand.
“You can take that whichever way you want,” he mutters out. He closes his eyes and takes a few deep breaths. “Listen, everything’s pretty much shit right now, and all the Avengers have been tip-toeing around me for the past few days…”
“Come on, Cap, we’re curious beings, you know!” Clint counters. Steve’s hand comes up to cover his eyes.
Everybody nods, and people start scattering around. Natasha and Sam go to join Sif, Hilde and Okoye, while Bucky goes to talk with T’Challa. He’s not always being a brat with the other Avengers, he can be serious sometimes, too.
Two hands cupped her face, thumbs softly caress her cheeks. She remembered those hands for every time she started stressing out over whatever the heck it was them two had. She remembered what it felt like to feel his chilly hugs, the fierce fights, but always crawling back to each other. They had never been what people would call a ‘
“Come on, Steve. Let’s leave these idiots with their stupid questions, shall we?” she asks. Steve nods lightly, finally taking his first step back towards the door. Without saying anything to Sam and James, the two leave the common room and head back to the gym instead. Steve could use some sparring as a distraction, after all.
“Because he’s just a rich bastard. Besides, the suit can just be remade, no matter who is flying it. See War Machine, practically the same, just a better hero inside,” she explains. And Peter then stands up angrily, causing his chair to scrape over the floor and make a painful sound that could make ears bleed.
“Keep it down,” Loki whispered. He thought for a little moment before he answered Yaël. “It started off as a naive, selfish action, fed by revenge,” Loki looked her in the eyes “But once our situation got too... intense, I only had two choices left: sending you to Thanos, who would’ve killed you to get the stone out of your body or using you in the fight instead. One way or another, I still think I made the right decision. You should be thankful I spared your life,” he said cockily. Yaël’s mouth fell open
“I’ve been forgetting my meds,” Peter admits. Mr. Stark stays quiet as Peter clears his throat again. “In June, my girlfriend died. The Goblin took her, I was there, but I couldn’t save her.”
!” Steve asks with a loud voice. Tony holds up his hands, shushing him, trying to keep him quiet. Steve takes a deep breath before sitting back down.
“Whazz-“ he starts, but the words slur out. It feels like he’s not in control of his mouth. His throat is dry, and he could really use some water. He looks around a bit, reaching for his face to scratch an itch at his nose. Then he realizes he’s got another tube shoved through it.
“Honey, if not for these, you wouldn’t be here,” Tony counters. “I’m trying to… what do you call it? That’s an olive branch. Is that what you call it?” He sits down on a chair, a good distance away from Steve, but still close enough to be able to touch him if he would just reach out. He forces a smile on his lips, but he doesn’t really mean it, feeling his chest ache from everywhere just by looking at Steve.
“Yeah, I know what you mean…” Gladly, Charles felt there was something off about the man in her dreams. The subject made her think of something else she had been wanting to ask him.”Do you actually know what the whole buzz is with that infinity stone I absorbed?”
Nothing’s going the way it should. He has no idea when it started, but he figures it must be since the Infinity War. Though, what exactly happened there, he has no idea. The way he remembers it, it was like nobody was really meeting each other for the first time. Peter can’t remember ever coming across the Guardians of the Galaxy before, nor does he remember meeting Thor before then. Still, when they came down to Earth, they seemed to know exactly who he was.
But in his defense, it’s mostly because that damn number is put on a piece of paper that held all the details on his appointment with Mr. Stark.
“I don’t want you to leave the team,” Tony admits. “I was just trying to make you feel guilty for bailing on me. I don’t hold the fact that you were on a mission against you.”
“Hey, don’t ignore me! What does the Goblin want with you, and has it anything to do with the destruction of our hallway?”
By the time he’s near Stark Tower, Peter jumps off the car. He must have surprised the diver, since he stops with shrieking tires, leaving black marks on the road. Peter waves him off in a thanks, jumping up towards the wall of the tower and then starting his climb up.
“I’m breaking the door,” Peter then says, wondering if it’s to prepare himself or to warn Tony. After taking a deep breath, Peter runs forward, banging his shoulder against the wood and feeling it come along. The door stays in one piece, falling down on the ground, pulled out of its hinges. Peter rubs his shoulder for a bit, looking around and finding a body on the ground.
“I’m fine,” he admits. “At the most, I have a small bruise here on my arm from when the eye of the robot flew off.”
“I know,” Yaël leaned against the back of her chair, rubbing her eyes. “Does Stark actually already know you’re his son?”
“JARVIS?” he asks, not remembering if he’s gotten an answer yet. He moves forward for a bit, somehow knowing how to do that. He somehow feels that he’s moving forward, but there’s no surface, nothing else indicating that he’s moving again. He keeps on going, it’s probably just an illusion. He goes on, and on, until suddenly the light disappears and he’s hovering in a starry sky.
part of the team! They treat me like I’m just a child and I’m sick of it!” Peter complains angrily. He heads to his bedroom to grab a shirt and some loose pants before getting to the couch. “I mean, c’mon, after Thanos, one would think they would at least trust me with a stupid giant slow-ass robot, no?”
FRIDAY answers. Peter throws his head back and groans. Then he grabs his papers together and throws them into his bag along with the arc reactor. He’ll take care of that the next time he sees Mr. Stark at the Facility.
It’s raining, of course. It had been raining when Tony flew all the way back to the compound. It’s rather typical in November.
"It was alright, Mr. Collins gave us back our Chemistry test, and I aced it," he says, as if it's not that big of a deal. To be honest, it's not really. It's not like it's hard for him to get an A+. "What are you making?"
Iron Man suddenly shouts from above him. Peter looks up, suddenly distracted. That seems to be enough for the man, as Peter’s suddenly pushed back by an impressive force. Landing on the car right next to Strange, Peter groans in pain. He doesn’t really appreciate the impact.
“Which planet is this?” Yaël asked as she looked through the window. It surely was a planet filled with trees.
from, thinking of how he actually forgot his pills back at home for the past few days. He’s such an idiot.
Sitting at detention, Peter has his arms crossed in front of him and his head resting on the desk as he waits for the hour to pass. His homework is already finished, and his newspaper is read through completely.
Yaël expected to be smacked by a pile of falling glass so she bowed and put her arm in front of her face, but it never came. When she looked up, there was no glass, not even a splinter. It looked like there had never been a glass cage in the middle of the woods.
“Not really,” Peter admits in all honesty. When prom sucked so hard, he almost came to think that it was just a sign from the universe telling him that it was not meant to be. Besides, after all that crap with Thanos, it also feels kind of stupid to be worrying about getting a girlfriend.
“He’s going to be out of school for a while,” May suddenly says as Tony is starting to nod off. The man looks up, seeing May still staring down at Peter in concern. In agreement, he nods.
“Listen, whatever I did, I’m pretty sure I can explain?” Tony tries to defend himself. While his brain is processing all the changes that are happening today, he can only come to one conclusion; the battle against that Mordo-guy brought him somewhere he shouldn’t be. It’s pretty much a miracle that Tony didn’t have a full-out panic attack the moment he came here. He’s not at all keen of interdimensional travel.
Upon the first mention of Steve joining SHIELD on the field, along with Natasha and Clint, he had grabbed the opportunity. He took it as an excuse not to have to live at Stark Tower, making it seem less like he was rejecting Tony but more like he just couldn’t be there. And besides, Tony hadn’t taken it personally, but just said that the tower was open for any of them at any time.
Suddenly, Yaël saw a little kid appear, running playfully after her mom. The girl was also wearing a white dress and had flowers braided in her hair. The dark-brown, wavy hair of her mom and the kid looked exactly the same. Of course, the girl was toddler-Yaël herself. Agostina turned around and smiled at her daughter. Little Yaël fiddled a bit with the flowy skirt of her mother as her mom crouched to get to her daughter’s eye-level.
“Nice to meet you,” he says calmly. “So you’ve been caring for this brat in the time that I’ve been gone?”
“Sweet child, come in!” Mrs. Thompson yelled. Yaël looked up confusedly. “Come on, before you get sick!”
She figured it out one day when Peter was asleep. She had heard him sneak back into the house and was curious as to what exactly he was doing up so late. When she came into his room, he had fallen asleep on his bed instantly, the old suit thrown on the ground without much thought.
“Alright, let’s do this, Parker,” he tells himself. He walks out of the restroom, hurries to his locker to take the books to the next class, and makes his way to the place he needs to be. But, before he gets there, he makes a stop at his previous class. The students are currently walking outside since the class is over. They give him a weird look when he gets back in. He waves at Ned and Harry when they give him questioning glances.
Steve arrives before Cho does. The Super Soldier greets Peter by kissing him on the forehead before taking place next to Tony. There’s a silence in the room, none of them planning on talking about anything. It’s just nervous waiting for Helen to come back with any kind of news.
“Pretty impressive, Mr. Parker,” Mr. Stark says, pulling the bracelet off again before handing it back to Peter. “How long did it take you to make these?”
“Ah, well,” Clint mutters, sitting down on the seat where Steve had been earlier. “I didn’t really hate living in the tower. I don’t mind being here all that much.” He shrugs, turning towards Sam who shrugs as well.
Without even thinking about it, Yaël steered the rain and hail away from her, so it seemed she had some sort of waterproof shield around her. She picked up the leaves and started putting them into big bags. When she looked up, she saw Mrs. Thompson staring at her from her kitchen window, with her mouth fallen open.
“Uh, do you have Sprite?” he asks nervously. Strange raises his eyebrow and then suddenly there’s a full glass in his hand. Peter’s mouth falls open. “Whoa, that’s just awesome!”
“’llo?” Peter asks curtly, knowing that his discomfort might be obvious through the line of the phone. He doesn’t care.
He doesn’t want to lie to him. He’s his father; in any normal circumstances, Peter would have spilled the beans a long time ago.
Peter’s familiar voice suddenly says. Steve’s heart speeds up after that, especially when he hears some people talking in the background. They haven’t found them yet, but they know there’s somebody here.
With the headset in place, he focuses his mind, telling the nanites to move under the lens. Just like he’s imagined, it moves the way he wants it.
And when Peter feels relaxed again, at least as much as possible, he opens up the door and gets out of the stall.
“You want to know how he slowly comes up to me, pulls my shirt back over my head again while subtly letting his fingers travel all over my chest? How he lies down on the bed, pulling me along? Giving me that smile with those perfect lips of his? Telling me he loves me? Me telling him I love him? How I slowly go down with my hand on his stomach, getting lower and lower until I grab his di-“
