“Experimenting? For what?”
“What?” I ask.
Dean smirks, amused. “You don’t think they should…what?”
I nod slowly, sighing. “I’ll try. I love you, Cas.”
“Then why are you freaking out about it so much?” I ask.
The knot in my chest loosens a little, and I slump forward in his hold. “No…”
“Okay. Good.” He nods again, stepping back a little and walking past me towards the living room. He lies face down on the couch, sighing softly. I watch him for a minute, then grin, coming up behind him and pressing my hands against his shoulder blades again. He gasps, a shudder running through him.

“Hmm?” he answers sleepily.
I nod slowly. “What about me?”
Sam chuckles. “What do you want me to say, Dean? You’re dating an angel. We met God. The weird stuff doesn’t really faze me anymore. So you grew some wings. As long as Cas says you’re okay, that’s good enough for me. I’m sure he can take care of you.”
“I’m not sure it’s quite that simple,” Cas responds. “I know you have questions. I’m here to answer for my part in this.”

Dean chuckles, leaning in to kiss him softly. “No, of course not. I’ll keep that in mind. How do you feel?”
Dean swallows back his own panic, letting one of his hands settle at the back of Cas’ neck, the other drifting low on his waist, below the bloody streaks. “Shhh, okay, it’s okay, I got you,” he murmurs, gently stroking through his sweaty hair. “We’re going to take care of it, alright? Just calm down. Take a breath for me. I’m here.” Cas quiets a little, sniffing and whimpering softly. “That’s it. Take it easy. Come on, let’s sit you down before you pass out on me.” He kisses Cas’ forehead softly as he slowly walks him back towards the couch, sinking down on it and pulling Cas into his lap, careful not to let his back touch anything. Cas shivers a little, pressing closer and resting his head under Dean’s chin, listening to his steady heartbeat. “There we go. Can you tell me what happened?”
“What the hell was that?!”
“Of course I know,” Dean scoffed. “I mean, I haven’t really looked into it or anything, but...wait, wait, you think Cas wants to go because he thinks he might, like...be one of the letters or something?”
“Normal for who?” I shout to the empty room, exasperated by how calm he seems. “What the hell is going on?”
“What hurts?” I ask, puzzled. “Your leg?”
Sam snorts. “Speak for yourself, grandpa.”
He grins, shrugging. “Guess I got them back. It’s not very often we get those two girls out of the way, and I intend to take full advantage.”
Cas looks at him like he’s crazy. “No. I want to do this. I have to. I can’t let it rule my life anymore.”
He shrugs, looking away. “I thought we were done with this part.”
I think about it for a minute, glancing back at Dean. “I don’t know. Not really. I mean, they seem to know who we are, generally speaking. Dean recognized the handprint on his arm. And I think he had some form of a hell dream last night. But it seems to only be bits and pieces.”
Cas gives him a moment to himself before speaking up. “Were you going to kiss me?”
He chuckles softly, sitting up. “If you’ll come into the kitchen you’ll find out.” I grin, slowly climbing out of bed and hissing as my muscles protest. Cas glances down, try and failing to hide his satisfied smirk. “Sore?”
So sorry this one took so long, it's been a busy month! Enjoy!
I nod, flipping the pancakes. “So I take it stuff is...good with you two?”
Castiel looks up at me, and the pain is apparent in his eyes. “If it works,” he murmurs, “I think it’s the greatest plan you’ve ever had.”
Dean nodded. “Yeah, I think I have, actually. She’s still beautiful, I just... I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to drive it around the same way, after knowing what he did...but Ben had a blast working on that Firebird. And it was nice, getting to teach him the way you taught me. So I think that’s what I’m gonna use it for. Teach him to work on it, make some better memories that aren’t about dad. And maybe when he starts driving, he’ll want to use it. I can use Cas’ car until I get another one. I hardly ever go anywhere alone these days, anyway.”
“I’ve invited two for today, but we’re going to start with one and see how that goes.”
Cas shook his head quickly. “No, not at all. He’s just been really cuddly lately. Like Dean said, we don’t mind, we just want to make sure that we’re not muddying any boundaries he might not be sure of yet.”
Dean glances back at me, puzzled. Sam frowns. “Why, what happened?”
“Everything okay?” I ask curiously.
“Yeah,” Dean murmurs. “I really do. I am happy.”
“Sam gave it to me,” he answers, as if this should be obvious. I groan, and he chuckles. “Don’t worry. He won’t mention it again.”
“January twelfth,” Cas answered. “Today is Saturday.”
Dean sounded almost embarrassed, but the knot in Cas’ chest only clenched tighter. “I’m busy.”
Cas sighs softly, his eyes fluttering closed as I gingerly run the cloth down his chest, careful not to press too hard over the cuts and bruises littering his skin, and relief rushes through me at the slight response. He may not be speaking, but it’s at least better than the staring, and the distressed noises start to quiet. The cleaner he gets the more injuries I uncover, and I wince at the red skin around his wrists and throat, rubbed raw by his restraints. He starts a soft whimpering as I scoop water up and let it run gently over his neck, but it’s far less frightened. “I know,” I murmur soothingly. “I’m sorry. Almost done with this part.” I move on to thoroughly clean his back, being gentle around the apparent lash marks. Cas mewls softly, and I pause. “You okay?” He nods. “Good. You think you can uncurl a little bit for me?”
When the pleasant, warm feeling fades a little I pry my eyes open, finding Cas smiling at me as he runs a damp washcloth over my skin. I blink at him for a moment, trying to process what happened, but everything is still slightly too fuzzy. Instead I curl up against him, humming softly at the gentle hand moving through my hair. "Feel okay? Nothing hurts?" he asks quietly. I nod, smiling a little as his grip on me tightens. "Good. I've got you. Deep breaths."
I chuckle. “And they say you have no sense of humor. Come on, let’s dry you off. We’ll wash your hair in the sink so we don’t mess up the bandages. I don’t think either of us wants to go through that again.”
“Well, now I have to do it,” Dean snorted. “Can’t let Sammy win that one.” He paused, glancing up at her. “Hey...Look, I know I’ve been kind of an asshole lately, but...I really am glad you’re here. Thanks.”
I nod to the papers curiously. “Did you also draft up your tell-all memoir while I was out?”
He shrugs. “All things considered? I’m…not dead, thanks to you.”
In the morning, I wake up to find Dean already awake, frowning at the ceiling. I press closer to him, frowning as he tenses and sits up, getting out of bed. “Dean? Are you alright?”
That night, the nightmares return with a vengeance. But instead of claws, fangs, guns and blades, Cas sees only stark-white hospital rooms, the incessant beep and mechanical whirr of machines, and Dean slipping away from him forever.
I nod slowly. “Yeah, it is. I love you, Cas. I don’t know what I’d do without you.”
“You won’t,” I say quietly. “This is something I’m asking you to help me with. I know it’s a big thing, but I also know you’d never do this for fun.”
Sam glances back in the rearview mirror. “He okay?”
He nods. “I figured as much. We don’t have to, if it makes you uncomfortable.”
They sat in comfortable silence for a few minutes before Bobby spoke up again. “So, you figure out what you’re gonna do with your old man’s car yet?”
Cas frowns, puzzled for a moment before it dawns on him. “Oh. There was an incident.” Gabriel only looks even more furious, and Cas steps between him and Dean before he can do anything. “Woah, hey. Gabe, it wasn’t him, I promise. I’ve been here for the last two days because Dean’s been taking care of me. Look, why don’t you just go sit down and we’ll talk. I’ll tell you the whole story, I promise.”
Dean nodded, rubbing at the back of his neck for a moment. “Yeah, about that...I, uh...I kinda wanted to tell you something.”
Before I can reach the bed, he wakes with a gasp, looking around wildly. He whimpers again when he catches sight of me, reaching out. I gently pull him into my lap, and he grabs on tightly, a sob escaping him. “Shhh, it’s alright Dean,” I murmur. “It was just a dream. I’m here. You’re safe.” He shivers in my arms, and I hug him tighter, continuing to murmur softly until his crying slows and he looks up. I wipe his tears gently, kissing his forehead. “Had a bad dream, huh?” I ask. He nods, sniffing softly. “Want to tell me what it was about?”
He looks up at me, blue eyes narrowed. “I was. But they’re a part of my body, Dean. I can feel them like you feel your arms. Why were you touching them?”
He shrugs. “Some very important…science things.” He closes his eyes for a moment before jumping up. “Oh no! I completely forgot about…taking care of you!”
“You…you would do that?” Dean asks softly. “Like…forever?”
Dean hesitates. “It’s more of a play party really. It’s invitation only, and everyone is screened at the door to make sure that everyone is safe. Group play is encouraged. But it’s not mandatory by any means.”
“But what do you want?” I ask.
“Above the door frame,” he answers. “Why?”
He trailed off, and Cas smiled, nodding. “It’s nice to have a physical reminder that someone else thinks you’re worthy of love?” he guesses. Dean felt his cheeks go red again, nodding. “Well, I’m glad that it’s helping. And it’s nice to see you so happy, especially after how rough the last few months has been.”
After dinner they sit on the couch, sipping from wine glasses as they trade stories about work and family. Dean tells Cas more about his father, including what Bobby, who owns the garage Dean works in, did to him when Dean showed up at his house with a black eye. “Bobby was livid,” he chuckles. “I remember he opened the door, and I was just standing there in the snow, and he asked me if I was going to come inside or just stare at him all night. I said he probably wanted to know why I was there before he invited me inside. I was preparing myself for him to just slam the door in my face, and I couldn’t even say anything for a minute. And finally I just blurted it out and told him I’m gay.”
Cas’ eyes widen slightly. “You love him…” he says softly.
“Well,” Cas answered slowly. “We could go to the police. Maybe they could find these people, and make sure they never hurt anyone again.”
“Yeah, I guess it does,” Dean laughed, sniffling softly. “Can...Can I kiss you?”
Cas chuckles, nodding and slipping an arm around his waist. They talk while they eat, and Dean tells Cas about his day at the garage. Cas doesn’t follow most of it, but he likes hearing him talk about it anyway; likes how excited he gets and how his features light up. After a while he realizes that Dean is waving a hand in front of his face, and he blinks, jerking back to attention. “Sorry. What were you saying?”
“And how is that going?” he asks, raising an eyebrow.
“Cas! Don’t touch him! Stop it!” So many instincts run through me at once, and I try my hardest to break through the barrier, to stop watching, to do anything, but it’s hopeless. “It’s not real,” I mutter to myself, wincing at Cas’ cries.
“Why would you do that?” Dean asks. “You don’t even like me!”
Cas snuggles closer, his grip tightening slightly. “Love you, Dean,” he murmurs, opening one eye and glancing up at him.
Puzzled, I try to imagine how a mix up is possible. Clearly, the only thing happening was two people enjoying a particularly strong bond. I don’t see how that could possibly…unless…my thoughts drift back to Dean’s question. “Is it, like, a sexual thing?”
“Love you too.”
He frowns. “Dean, you didn’t do anything.”
“This is really what you want?” Dean asked cautiously.
I feel myself flush. “You’re a good teacher. I haven’t been able to let things out like that in…years. I’d almost forgotten how.”
I hesitate. “I…I don’t think I remember that.”
He yelps at the sharp slap that comes down on his ass. “I didn’t quite catch that. What did you say?”
He frowns. “Fine. Why?”
Yay! So the next chapter is almost finished. If you wanna see it, leave me a review to let me know you liked it!
“An experiment,” he answers. “What if you could just explore and try the things you’re curious about with no pressure to make anything happen? Like today, when I was asleep. You could take a couple of hours to get used to things and try what you want to without having to worry about me. And in return I could do the same to you, and you’d get a better sense of your own reactions.”
“Good. Come on, let’s go get you a glass of water.” He nods, sticking close beside Sam and I, sitting between us on the couch and finally relaxing. “Feeling better?” I ask.
I nod slowly, thinking about this. “I guess that makes sense. When I was in trouble, my soul grabbed onto you. Now that you’ve been hurt, your Grace wants to hang onto me.”
Cas rolled over, groaning softly. “Don’t wanna...”
I shut the bedroom door behind us, sinking down against it. “Holy shit...”
It isn’t long before Dean is fast asleep against Cas’ chest, snoring softly. Rather than try to move them to the bed, Cas gently shifts him into the most comfortable position possible, stroking his hair lightly.
“Well you don’t have to act so surprised,” she says, flashing him a smile. “We all have to pay the bills somehow.”
I look up at him for a moment, watching as his gaze flicks anxiously between me and the collar, and I realize that he wants this. But do I?
After Ben fell asleep, Dean was still too jittery to settle down, so he told Cas he was going to get some fresh air. Out on the porch he spotted Bobby, beer in hand as he rocked slowly in one of the chairs. “Mind if I join you?” The older man grunted in response, motioning to the empty chair beside him. Dean sat in silence for a few minutes, rocking his chair absently. “Dad always thought I was weak, and useless, and stupid,” he blurted out suddenly. “He used to tell me all the time. And then, after he found out I was gay, he added ‘whore’ to the list. But some part of me always thought I might prove myself worthy to him, if I was just a little bit better...and now it just keeps playing over and over again in my head...”
He frowns for a moment, puzzled. “What? Oh. I was speaking in Enochian again, wasn’t I? I was just asking for forgiveness.”
"But you don't want to freak out," Dean finishes, nodding. "I understand. Why don't we work up to it? We can have the whole group over one night, and then if you enjoy that, we can perform at the club on Saturday. That way if the audience thing freaks you out, it'll just be in front of our friends, and not in front of a whole crowd."
I chuckle, kissing him softly again. “Well don’t stop on my account.”
“That’s alright. You don’t have to tell me unless you want to. Did you sleep at least?” I ask. He nods. “Good. I’m gonna go take a quick shower, alright? I’ll be right back.” When I finish washing up, I take an extra minute to let the hot water relax my muscles before my worry about Cas starts eating at me. I quickly throw on sweatpants, and when I return the sketch pad is at the opposite side of the bed, and Cas is staring at the wall, breathing harshly. “Everything alright?” I ask cautiously. His head snaps up, and he shakes it once. “Well…what’s wrong?” I notice his white knuckled grip on the blanket, frowning. “Your memories trying to suck you back in?” I guess.
“Sorry,” he mutters, flushing.
“Oh…”
He glances through the list for a moment. “Like…scatplay,” he says evenly.
Slowly, Cas reached out, eyeing the animal carefully as she watched his hand. He sucked in a breath when he finally made contact, petting her gently. “Oh...she’s soft...” he murmured. Dean smiled, nodding.
Claire’s face lit up. “You do?! I knew it! Kaia owes me five bucks.”
“S’okay,” he pants. “Just give it a minute.” He seems to relax a little at that, his head dipping to wrap his lips around Dean’s shaft, moaning softly as he sucks while he waits. Dean groans, one hand finding its way into his hair as he gradually relaxes.
He trails off as I walk back over to him, kissing him softly. “Thank you.”
I consider it carefully. “Well, I suppose my grace has known since I pulled you out of hell. Maybe even before that, depending on if you believe in destiny or not. But it wasn’t until I was human that I really understood what I felt and how much I need you. The worst event of my existence was exactly what I needed to make my life complete.”
“Yeah. Well…while we were there, I, uh…we saw our mother. I mean she wasn’t…she was a trick. She started talking about how…I was a burden, and that the one good thing that came out of her death was getting away from me.” Cas frowns, but stays quiet. “I was dreaming about what she said. She talked about how everyone leaves me, and how it’s my fault, and then…then I saw Sammy and Bobby and just…everyone, and whenever I tried to get close to them they disappeared, and I…God, Cas, I just panicked. I didn’t want to be alone. And then you were there, and she was saying…that you would leave too, because you couldn’t love me. That I was never worthy of you, and it was only a matter of time, and I tried to grab onto you but you were just gone…”
I’m not sure what I expected when I opened the door, but it certainly wasn’t a shirtless Sam pacing the floor with a nervous-looking Gabriel trailing after him. Sprouting from Sam’s back is a large set of wings, which are twitching anxiously. He stops mid-step when he sees me, his eyes widening. “D-Dean...I...w-wasn’t expecting you back so soon...”
The cloud writhed for a moment, and Dean could feel its rage before it launched itself through the darkness at them. Quickly, Dean pressed his bloody hand to Cas’ chest, the blinding white light drowning out everything else. When he opened his eyes again he was kneeling on the floor in the bunker, the former angel clutched tightly to his chest.
anything.” His voice broke, but he pressed on anyway. “I was so shocked, I just...froze. Everything happened so fast, and...I didn’t say anything, and then he was just
Cas blushed, looking sheepish as he brushed Dean’s hair back lightly. “I, uh...sorry about that. I may have gotten a little carried away at the end there. I should have had better control over myself. I apologize. Did I hurt you?”
“Good. I think you’re all clean. Let’s get you dried off.” Dean makes a sad noise, starting to look upset, and Cas shushes him softly. “It’s okay, I’m not leaving,” he murmurs, stroking a hand through his wet hair until he settles down. “I’m here. Just relax.”
Dean feels his face heat up, ducking his head. “Yeah, of course. I know it’s kind of early, but…you needed a reason to hold on to, to convince you I wasn’t leaving. Why not the truth?”
Cas nods. “You know, Dean, I haven’t been human very long, but I have learned some things. And from an outsider’s perspective, let me tell you, human emotions are complicated, and often contradictory. You have an expression about loving and hating something at the same time. It’s confusing, but normal. You are certainly allowed to both love and be angry with your father.”
Cas nods. “It is. I’ve always wanted to do it. But I never actually got up the courage to try.”
They eat in comfortable silence for a few minutes until Dean returns, hair still wet from the shower but refreshingly clean of bloodstains. “There you are, brother,” Benny teases him. “I told you I could take care of your pup. Look, I even fed him.”
Remember to review! I love reading your opinions and comments. Expect more chapters up later this week, sooner if more of you review :D
Dean gives a soft moan, unable to resist leaning in to kiss him. “You’re so good to me, you know that?”
The angel smiles fondly. "Of course, Dean. Don't worry, we have time."
Cas nods, stroking his hair lightly. “Yeah, it did actually. I wasn’t expecting that, but I feel a lot better about trying it. Are you sure you’re okay?”
“I always want you to stay, but you have to go home sometime, Dean,” Cas smiles. “I’ll be okay. And if I’m not I know what to do, and I promise I’ll call you. I learned my lesson. I can handle it.”
“I’m…I’m not…” he starts mumbling in protest.
Cas laughs, nodding. “I could tell. They seem nice, though. They all do. Honestly, I wasn’t really sure what I expected, but…I was happily surprised. Do you think they liked me?”
He smiles, shaking his head. “I’m not. Though I wouldn’t mind another kiss…”
“Okay,” I murmur. His hands move lower again, starting at the base of my spine and searching carefully for the stiff spots. The fingers dig in gently when they find one, the pressure light at first and slowly increasing. There’s a dull ache for a moment before a sense of warmth spreads as the muscles release, and the relief is so sweet that I don’t even care about letting the weakness show.
“I’m s-sorry,” he stutters, his voice muffled by my skin. “I’m so sorry…”
I smile, nodding. “Alright then. I love you, Castiel. I always will. And I guess now I can give you this.”
“Not yet, but he’s come pretty close,” Cas grins.
me, Sammy, and I...I didn’t fucking
He glances back again. “You seem to be doing okay so far. You got him to relax a little. He’s just scared. We’ll figure it out. The sooner we get him fixed up, the better.”
He nods. “We don’t have to. I just figured, with Sam gone for a while…”
“I don’t know yet,” I sigh. “I mean, I know what I want to do, but Cas has reservations about that particular plan. How are you holding him down there, anyway?”
“Good boy. Deep breaths.” There’s a soft clinking sound, and then a cold drop falls onto my chest. I flinch at it, and at the next one, gasping when the object is swiped across my skin. “Guesses?” he asks.
He nods slowly. “Yeah, you are different. And…you’re sure this is what you want?”
I nod, shrugging sheepishly. “Yeah, I’m good. Sorry about this morning.”
Cas nods, carefully pulling me up from the floor. He takes my hand as he leads me downstairs to one of the rooms in the basement. “Just so you know, we only have to use it if you want to,” he says, looking suddenly nervous. “I just…thought you might like to.”
He hesitates. “It just…surprised me. I didn’t realize it would still happen after I was healed.”
He makes a thoughtful noise, and his weight shifts higher as he nuzzles between my shoulder blades. “Talk to me. Why does it make you so nervous? It’s only natural.”
Cas has to consider it for a minute. On the one hand, Dean is a total stranger who showed up in his apartment and started ordering him around. On the other hand, he’d also been gentle and patient, making sure he ate and managing to put him at ease even in the most vulnerable positions. And maybe Gabriel is right. Maybe it is time to take a risk and go after what he wants. “Yes Sir,” he murmurs finally. “I trust you.”
He frowns a little, sighing. “You scared me, you know,” he says quietly.
Dean relaxed slightly, nodding. “Oh...well...thank you. I was...sort of afraid you wouldn’t want me around anymore...And that would really suck.”
“Good. And I promise you when we find him, he’ll pay for what he did to you.”
“Really.” I smile, watching as his eyes slowly close. “Are you…tired?”
Cas’ breaths start to deepen, a combined reaction to the pain relief and fatigue, and I carefully pull the blankets back for him. He frowns at me, shaking his head. “What?” He gives me a pointed look, then looks back at the bed. “Yeah, I know it’s my bed,” I chuckle. “You need to sleep. It’s okay. Just lie down.” He hesitates for a moment, but the invitation is too much to resist, and he slowly lays back, burying his face in the pillow as I carefully tuck the blankets in around him. “Want me to turn out the light?” He shakes his head hard. “Yeah, I guess you’ve been in the dark long enough, huh? Okay. Sweet dreams, Cas.” I turn to leave, but he whimpers loudly. “You…want me to stay?” He flushes red, but nods. “Um…alright then…” I drag over a chair, setting it down by the side of the bed. “This okay?” he nods, biting his lip for a moment before cautiously reaching his hand out. “You...want me to hold your hand?” I ask, puzzled. He shrinks back a little, unsure, and I mentally kick myself for making him feel bad when he finally wants me near him. “Okay, I can do that,” I say quickly, reaching out and taking it lightly. Cas burrows farther under his blanket, gripping my hand tightly. “Alright. I won’t go anywhere. Get some sleep.” I rub my thumb over the back of his hand gently until he relaxes, slipping into unconsciousness. I watch him quietly for a few minutes before Sam knocks softly.
Slowly, the boy smiles at the praise. “Better for now,” he answers. “Thanks to your…” he freezes, looking back over his shoulder at me. “He’s…human,” he mutters, incredulous.
Cas makes a small noise, his feathers rustling. “Yeah, I think it would. But right now he’s just so lost. He wants to know what happened to him. And we can’t just let him suffer. We have to figure this out, and it looks like he’s the best lead we’ve got. We’ll just have to pick up the pieces. We’ve done it before.”
Dean whimpers loudly, knowing Cas wants him to beg for it but unable to make his mouth form coherent words. Finally he manages to take a breath. “Fuck me, Cas!” he chokes out finally. “Please baby…’m gonna explode…need you to fuck me hard…”
“It’s not even really that early,” Dean chuckles. “I promised you a good time, and that’s what you’ll have. Just be patient.”
Blue eyes flew open, and Cas stroked his cheek lightly, curious. “Really?”
“Shut up, Sammy. Go tell the little bastards it’s time for breakfast.”
Cas chuckled, kissing him softly as a second finger presses in beside the first. “I’m happy to help any time.” His wrist twisted slightly, and Dean shuddered, a low moan escaping him. Cas smiled, stroking over the spot again and kissing across Dean’s chest. Dean would never say it out loud, but he was proud of himself. When he’d first escaped, he’d thought he might never let anyone touch him ever again. And now he was here not just tolerating, but enjoying something he thought had been taken from him forever. As nervous as he sometimes was, Cas had been nothing but patient with him, and now he could honestly say he felt good with Cas’ hands on him, or in him, as they were now.
Castiel frowned at the carpet. “I think you were pretty clear when you said you’d rather be implicated in an incestuous relationship than in a relationship with me.”
I rub my eyes groggily, blinking at him. “What’s the good news?”
Love,
“It’s alright,” he shrugs. “I still have a long way to go, but I’ve gotten a lot done so far. How was breakfast with Sam?”
The angel just chuckles, claiming his mouth in a kiss that makes Dean’s head spin. “I won’t move,” he promises. “Just trying to solve your problem. Besides,” he murmurs close to Dean’s ear, “I think I’d like to feel you tighten up around me.”
“That sounds fair,” Cas agrees. “But…do I have to be naked the first time?”
He sets his plate down, pressing in close, one hand travelling to the side of my jaw to draw me closer, the other curling into the hair at the back of my head. The kiss is slow but deep, and when my lips part under the pressure he promptly gets to work exploring. When we break apart Dean has a dangerous glint in his eye. “Something tells me neither of us is going to be needing clothes any time soon. Come on, Cas. Let’s see if we can make you repent.”
Love,
“Cas, please!” He nods, slowly pulling back before thrusting in hard. I shout, my head thrown back, and he takes advantage, sucking and biting up my throat as he picks up speed until he’s slamming into me. Everything becomes a blur of heat and pleasure, and I moan loudly as something in me tightens. “Sir…Please…May I cum?” I manage to choke out.
Dean huffs, throwing a napkin at him. “Then why do we keep you around?”
I gently work the gag out of his mouth, and it’s followed closely by a sob as he turns to press his face against my neck. I shush him softly, rubbing gently along his spine as his grip on me tightens. “Shh, you’re okay,” I murmur, kissing his temple. “Dean, you’re okay. It’s all over. I’m so proud of you. Just relax now. I’ve got you. Breathe.”
Instead, he laughs. “Perhaps. But mostly because I think you need to learn to let go. And that is what I’m going to try to teach you. Because if you never learn to relax, one day you’re going to go nuclear, and I’m not about to let that happen.” He strikes out halfway up my inner thigh, not hard, but enough to feel the sting. I jolt, more out of surprise than pain, and clamp down around a sound threatening to escape me. Cas frowns. “Relax, Dean. It’s only me here. Who are you trying to impress? You need to give yourself a longer leash. Or maybe I’ll have to give you one.” I nod, taking a breath. He strikes out again on the opposite side, and this time a little gasp escapes me. “Better,” he appraises, lightly tapping against my knees until I spread them again, obeying the silent command. “Though, if you can’t stay still, I have no qualms about tying you down.” My cock twitches at that, and I try to will it down, knowing he won’t let me get off that easy. He notices and smirks before lashing out again, harder. I grunt with the effort of keeping my position, but manage to fight the urge to bring my knees together, which seems to please him. He strokes through my hair lightly; a reward. “Good boy. You have nothing to hide from me.”
It takes a minute to get my voice back under my control, the sensations making it hard to concentrate. “I…
“The dude actually
He smiles, nodding. "Okay. It's kind of nice, being able to feel you again. Almost like being an angel again."
I hesitate for a moment, staring down at the table. “Well, I...I guess it...helps me too...I mean, at first it was just...you know, kinda fun. Cas got into exploring this stuff, when he was working through the whole being human thing, and I sure as hell wasn't going to say no to his enthusiastic sex phase...we switched back and forth for a while, just trying stuff out, but...I’m not really...good at relaxing...sometimes the stuff in my head gets out of control, and...this is the only thing I’ve found so far that seems to help, besides, you know, getting drunk off my ass. There’s just some part of me that...needs this. And as much as I hate that part, and try to bury it, I...it does help. And Cas says he doesn’t mind, so...”
He glances at Sam, who frowns. “Right. I’m gonna go to the bathroom. Don’t kill each other while I’m gone.” He pauses in the hallway. “And don’t pop in on me again!”
She chuckled, accepting his enthusiastic hug. “Wow, that’s awesome! I take it you’re excited?”
Love,
Dean hissed softly as a third finger pressed in alongside the first two, wincing slightly, and Cas stilled for a minute to let him adjust. He took a deep breath, letting it out slowly as he willed himself to relax, and after a moment the discomfort eased. He looked up, finding Cas watching him carefully. “‘M fine,” he murmured, rocking back against his fingers slightly. “Go ‘head.” Slowly, Cas started to move again, and Dean moaned, fumbling in their laps for a moment before getting a grip on their cocks, stroking them together lazily. Cas’ breath hitched, and he claimed Dean’s mouth again with a bit more passion, his free hand squeezing Dean’s thigh lightly. Once Dean relaxed, the quick fingers opened him up easily, and he whined when they tugged at his rim teasingly before returning to drag over his prostate. It was hard to think through the sensation, but there was still one more thing he had to do. “F-Fuck,” he breathed, hips rocking in time with Cas’ fingers. “Shit, Cas, s-stop...” The contact disappeared so fast it made Dean a little dizzy, an involuntary whine escaping him, and when he looked up Cas was worried. Dean grinned, shaking his head and stroking the other man’s cheek lightly, trying to put him at ease while he caught his breath enough to speak. “Relax, I’m fine...I’m great, just...Don’t want it to end this way. There’s something else I want to do...”
He could’ve gone on ignoring this behavior, as he had with many behaviors of humans over the years, were it not for one small detail: that Castiel had come to realize that he very much desired a different sort of relationship with the human. Many humans entered these relationships to fulfill their more base desires, but Castiel didn’t think his own interest was entirely rooted in the need for physical stimulation. He wanted something deeper than that, though he’d never quite been able to explain it, even to himself, and Dean was the only human he’d ever had such desires with. In moments of madness, he’d even considered if maybe Dean would be more at ease if Cas found a new vessel, a female one; if maybe the change might cause him to reciprocate. But some part of him worried that maybe it was just the angel himself that made Dean so uncomfortable. He supposed that was why Dean’s reaction to even the insinuation of something more between them had started to hurt so much, even though he’d long since given up the idea of telling the human of his affection. It was a nagging, burning kind of pain, but one he’d grown used to, and resolved never to reveal.
The angel shrugs. “I’d planned on watching over you silently, like I have for the past several months.”
Dean smiles, humming thoughtfully. "I never really thought about it much...I'd like to go somewhere with a nice beach...and it might be fun to see all those tourist-y things people talk about. The closest thing we ever saw was the time we drove past the world's largest ball of twine... Maybe you can choose some place you like."

“Yeah, I guess you could say that,” I answer.
“So are we,” Dean murmured. “Ben was right last night, you know. It takes a special kind of person to do what you did. To look at someone so beaten-down and broken, and see something worth saving in them. And it takes a very special person to see what they could become, and stick around long enough to help them get there. That’s why we trust you the way we do. Because you saw us at our absolute lowest, and you believed in us. We might’ve had to do the work ourselves, but you were right there beside us, every step of the way. Even the really shitty steps. And it’s not over, for either of us, but...we know that you’ll still be here, no matter how long it takes. We couldn’t have come this far if you hadn’t been exactly who you are. I love you, Cas. I know I might not always say it as much as I should, but...I love you so much.”
I turn my head slowly, trying to limit the amount of pain I put myself through. “My back has been getting stiffer the longer it’s bandaged, and it started to hurt a few days ago. It’s getting worse. I keep getting spasms and I don’t know how to fix them. They’re bad.”
Dean smiles, carefully rinsing the shampoo from his hair. “Good. I think so too. And we don’t have to decide immediately.”
Dean nodded, letting out a breath. “Okay. Okay, good.”
I smile up at him, pressing a soft kiss to the palm that falls to my cheek. “Yes Sir.”
He sighs. “You’ve expressed interest in continuing to explore our…earlier activities. But if we’re going to do that, we need to set boundaries. This is a list of sexual acts commonly associated with BDSM, and we have to go through it and see what we actually want to do.”
Cas chuckles. “Really? One of his secretaries or something?”
“And he’s…alright with them?” Cas asks.
I smile, leaning up to kiss him softly. “Thank you. And thanks for keeping an eye on him. How’s he doing?”
Ezekiel chuckles. “I don’t see why it should. It’s not all that unusual for us. We’re happy that we could help.”
Dean smiles, kissing the back of his neck softly. “Are you sure you haven’t had years of experience subbing?”
“Yes Sir,” he nods, letting himself sink back against Dean’s chest. The new hand starts to move, skimming lightly over his skin, and it’s strange, but not unpleasant. Dean kisses his neck as another hand joins in, a different person, judging from the smaller size. It grips his shoulder gently for a moment before starting on its own path, and it’s definitely weird, but surprisingly, Cas finds it sort of comforting too, all of the hands on him confident in their movements, overseen by someone who wouldn’t let him get hurt. It takes a minute before he realizes he’s lost track of which hands belong to which person, and they keep switching from right to left and sometimes using both hands, which makes it confusing. He can still feel Dean at his back, but he can’t tell which of the hands belongs to him anymore. It should scare him, but he supposes, technically speaking, all of the hands belong to Dean. He knows that it’s Dean giving silent instructions, Dean who chose these people, and it doesn’t really matter which hands are physically his, because they’re all his doing.
I consider it. “I guess we’ll just have to talk to him and see what he thinks the best options are. At the very least, with his Grace damaged, we’ll have to clean his wounds and probably set the bones in his wings.”
I grumble, but get started on the chores, and it actually does help. By the time I’m putting away the laundry, I’m feeling mostly normal. I stop in Sam’s room to drop off his clothes, cursing under my breath as the laundry basket knocks something off the nightstand. I don’t get to see exactly what it is before it rolls under the bed, but I reach under it, groping around until I find something that feels about the right size. I pull it out, frowning down at the object, certain now that it isn’t what I knocked over. Instead, it’s a small wrist cuff, brown leather on the outside with soft padding inside and a small metal buckle. What catches my attention, though, is the sigil burned into the leather. I know enough to know it’s enochian, but it’s not one I’ve ever seen before. I frown at it for a minute before grabbing a post-it from the nightstand and copying the symbol carefully before replacing the cuff under the bed.
he said instead.
Sam smiles. “Well then, good luck. I don’t know how you’ll do it. I know he’s been opening up about stuff, but his issues with dad are guarded more closely than Fort Knox. I don’t know why, but it’s the touchiest subject he has.”
He chuckles. “Dean, what’s the big deal? It’s cute. Don’t be a jerk about it.”
I sniff a little, suddenly feeling ashamed. “It was just…a bad dream,” I mumble.
“It’s as comfortable as anyplace else,” Dean counters halfheartedly.
“Yes Sir. That’s why I submit to you,” I admit. “The walls don’t just keep people out. They keep me in. I need help. You’re the only one who’s gotten anywhere close.”
“I don’t think I’ve ever felt this way before,” he admits quietly.
I swallow hard, taking a deep breath and forcing myself to stop thinking. It helps, and as I focus on the pleasant feeling I find myself relaxing into the sensation, moaning softly. Cas grins, pleased, and continues his task for a few more minutes before slowly increasing the pressure. A low groan escapes me as the sensation changes. “God…Cas…”
But it was too late.
“Good, Sir,” I breathe, feeling my hips start to move up towards him. “Really good.” His free hand traces patterns up my spine, and a loud, unintelligible noise escapes me as he adds a second finger. It’s tight, but in the best way possible, and I can’t even be ashamed for rocking my hips back against him, because for the first time in forever the buzz in my head is quiet. I whine loudly as his fingers spread inside me, my body just as obedient to him as the rest of me. It opens willingly for him as he adds a third, watching me curiously. “What?” I ask, feeling his eyes on me.
The angel smiles. “I thought you might be more agreeable to it that way. Why, did you enjoy it?”
Cas sits up so fast he winces at the movement. “Are you saying he used the belt on you?”
I think about it for a moment before nodding. Since I’ve been here, Sam has had plenty of opportunity to hurt me, and he hasn’t, excluding that first night when he set my wings, which, to be fair, had to be done, and which he felt guilty about. “Yes, I know you wouldn’t hurt me.”
Cas laughs, considering it. “I don’t know where I’d want to go, but as long as you’re there, I’d love to go. You’re right, we do deserve it. It would be nice.”
I wake up to a scream in the middle of the night. When I look over, I see that Sam has jolted awake too, and that the sound is coming from Cas, who’s sitting with his knees pulled up to his chest, clutching his head and hyperventilating. I move to one side of him, and Sam takes the other. “Cas, can you hear us?” I ask. He nods, but it doesn’t seem to make a difference.
“Angel,” he murmurs, almost smiling at the familiarity of the question.
“I am…very fond of our life here. But it is…not always easy to accept the way I am now,” he admits quietly.
“Why is this Christmas thing so important to you all of a sudden?” I ask. “You’ve never wanted to celebrate it before.”
Cas nods, smiling. "Of course. I'd love to go with you if you want me to. Are there any places in particular you'd like to go? Airplanes wouldn't be necessary if I am accompanying you."
He frowns a little. “I…suppose we could buy new ones,” he says.
When he woke his chest was far too tight, each gasped breath clawing its way in and out but not taking in any oxygen. His first instinct was to pull away from the man beside him, but then he remembered it was Cas. Cas was here. Cas was safe. He let himself be pulled closer, gripping onto the man for dear life and trying to hear his voice over the too-loud pounding of his heart. “You’re okay,” Cas murmured. “You’re safe. I’ve got you.” But Dean couldn’t get his body to listen, to comprehend, and he shook his head, hoping Cas would understand. Cas’ grip on him tightened, and Dean was fairly sure he felt a kiss at his temple, though he could have been imagining it. “I’m here. Dean, look at me.” This, at least, he managed, slowly looking up into Cas’ worried gaze. “You’re not there, okay? You’re right here with me. They can’t hurt you. It was just a dream. You’re okay. You just gotta breathe.”
“Cas, where did you…
He nods. “Not as young as your children, but young for an angel. I was going to have him stay in heaven with the other young ones, but he begged for the chance to come along. He finds humans fascinating. A promising student.”
Cas considers it. “Yes, I believe so. I…wasn’t aware I could do that.” His wings flutter uncertainly for a moment before folding back and disappearing again.
I huff, nudging him off. “Yeah, yeah, whatever...just don’t blame me when you get diabetes...”
Cas nodded, relaxing slightly and kissing him softly. “No flashbacks?”
After he downs his coffee Cas’ mood is lifted slightly, and he manages to enjoy himself as he watches Dean fix cars, occasionally stopping to explain different parts under the hood. They’re eating lunch when they see Bobby carrying a plastic box out to his truck. “Closing early,” he says as he passes. “Rufus called, wants to go fishing. Besides, I figured you wouldn’t mind some time off.”
“Not exactly. It’s more like those smaller spaces on the floor. Multiple things go on at once, and people come in and out. It’s more relaxed than a formal exhibition, but for the most part, people are invited to do more than watch.” Dean pauses, stroking Cas’ cheek lightly. “But we can still go if you don’t want to do that. It’s not unusual to have people who just go to socialize.”
“Sam! What am I supposed to do?” I ask.
While I take a break from NaNoWriMo writing, here's a nice long one for ya!
I raise an eyebrow at him. "Why don't I like the sound of that?"
He frowns. “I don’t know.”
I swallow, leaning my head back against his chest. “It’s never been that strong. I’ve always been able to figure it out before…”
I think about it. “So, you’re saying he does want an actual relationship, but he doesn’t know how?”
“Well, you don’t have to worry about that,” Cas murmured, hugging him closer. “I definitely still want you around.”
Benny glances up at him, grinning. “So Dean didn’t tell you, eh? I’ve been an EMT for damn near twenty years now, and before that I worked in emergency rooms. You’re in good hands.”
“I was able to heal you a bit while you slept,” Cas admits. “But not completely. I didn’t want to risk hurting you. To that end, I think we should get breakfast.”
Dean nods, watching him thoughtfully. “If you were watching me this whole time, why didn’t you step in before?”
Dean grins. “I may have. The old man needs some time off. And I could use the space.”
Dean sighs, pressing closer. “I’m not sure there’s a lot of options...”
He laughs. “Hey, I get it. It’s not easy to gain the trust of the angel brigade. You’re happy, he looks pretty happy, so I’m happy. Did you find out anything else about Karael?”
Dean nods, his hands starting to move again, rubbing soothingly along his sides. “Alright. You okay to continue?”
Cas smiles, nodding slowly. “I’ll think about it. Honestly, the offer kind of helps. It can’t be that bad if you’d volunteer. But I definitely think we can start working on the first part. Especially if it’s as much fun as the spanking.”
“Not so bad?” he asks, pulling back a little.
“This isn’t a hallucination, is it?” I ask after a moment. “I’ve...I’ve wished for an apology my whole life, I...”
“But…you’re not going to?” Dean guesses.
The angel searches his face curiously for a moment. “Was that…sarcasm?”
“Dean!” he whimpers loudly.
“Get a room you two.”
Love,
I laugh, pulling him close. “I love it, Cas. It’s…probably the weirdest gift I’ve ever gotten, but it’s great. I can’t wait to try it out with you.”
"That's kinder than I would have been," I murmur, pulling him closer.
Back with another chapter! Some more progress in the bedroom down at the end of this one. You know how the boys are when they get some alone time! <3
“I’m proud of you,” Dean murmurs against his temple. “Is there anything you need me to do for you?”
…fuck, I’m gonna cum, Sir, please, please may I cum, pleaseplease…”
I cum suddenly, without warning, nearly stumbling to my knees with the force of it, Cas’ name tumbling from my mouth. When I manage to catch my breath again, I sigh. That’s it. Got it all out of my system. Now I can finally focus on normal things.
“Good boy. I’m going to give you everything you need, I promise. But first I have to make sure we’re on the same page here.
“Not bad. I thought it’d be worse. For a while there I didn’t think anyone would ever be able to touch it again.”
It’s easy to answer this time, and Cas smiles. “Because I wanted to.”
It takes Cas’ sharp intake of breath for me to realize what I’ve said, and I can feel the blush returning, but Cas smiles, leaning closer to kiss me softly. “Don’t ever be too embarrassed to tell me what you want,” he murmurs against my lips. “Especially not when it’s something so fucking hot.”
Cas shakes his head hard. “Don’t you dare!”
“And…you don’t need permission to mate with someone?”
“Do I just…stay here?”
“Mine,” he agrees. “Thank you.” He leans down, kissing me softly. “Just one more thing. Open your eyes, pet.”
Dean chuckles, relaxing. “There’s the Sammy I know.”
One of the hands moves down to play with the waistband of his shorts, and he can’t help but press into the touch a little. There’s a soft chuckle, and the hand pauses for a moment before slipping down to cup him through the fabric. It squeezes lightly, and Cas moans, blushing furiously. Something brushes his jaw before a soft kiss is pressed to his neck, just underneath his collar. Cas tilts his head further, and he can feel the lips smile before continuing their movement.
“Of course,” Cas answered, sitting down beside him. “Sorry, I should have realized you probably have a lot of questions. I’ll answer whatever I can.”
“You don’t have to be sorry,” I assure him. “I understand.”
“Then he’s crazy, Dean,” Cas murmurs. “I don’t know how anyone could see the things you’ve gone through and think anything other than how strong you are.”
“So I’ve noticed,” I mumble into the pillow. “You know, I’ve been with a lot of girls, but I’ve never met anyone like you.”
“Good,” Dean nods, biting his lip. “Listen, I...Cas and I were talking, and...I think I know how I want to handle this. But this is your life too, so I figured we should all talk about it.”
Cas sighs. “Yes, it’s going to be as bad as you think it will be. Compared to the resilience of an angel, their wings are relatively fragile. And the connection to Grace makes them particularly sensitive to all kinds of stimuli. Even the smallest injury is beyond painful. I don’t know how much damage has been done, but I can tell you it is agony.” The angel’s voice, usually even and measured, breaks with his last sentence, and I realize how desperately he’s clinging to this calm visage.
“You asshole,” Dean laughed, tugging him into a kiss. “You don’t play fair. Come on, shower time. And behave yourself.”
Cas nods, taking a deep breath to calm the anxiety in his chest. “Okay.” Dean nods, slowly feeding the rod into his body, and Cas groans when it hits the bottom, struggling not to squirm at the cold and the odd stretch. Dean raises an eyebrow at him, and he manages a small smile. “Okay. Good.”
“For what?” I ask, puzzled.
“Deal.”
“Okay. Worst case scenario he passes out from under-oxygenation. Not terrible, but not pleasant either, so let’s try to get him under control before that happens. I want you to sit down next to him. Keep some space between you and move slowly. You don’t want to scare him worse. Tell me if he reacts at all to that.”
The angel nods. “When my Grace is fixed, shall I return as well?”
“Well, the good thing about first class is you get alcohol. The first thing that stewardess is going to do once we’re in the air is bring you whiskey. Lots of it.”
“You, stupid. Just trust me.” He reaches over to the remote, turning the TV on before wrapping an arm around my shoulders, pulling me closer. He tosses the remote into my lap. “Find something interesting to watch.” I raise an eyebrow at him, but he doesn’t say anything else, so I turn my attention to the TV, flipping channels. Slowly, his fingers move along my wings again, and I freeze. “Don’t mind me,” he says casually. I turn my attention back to the TV, trying not to pay attention. Slowly, the contact increases, and another shudder runs through me. “You don’t have to fight it so much, Cas,” Dean murmurs. “Just try relaxing for a minute. I doubt it’ll be as horrible as you think.”
I frown, taking a moment to process his words. “Yes…”
Cas nods, relaxing slightly. “What do you think Benny is going to do about that?”
. “No. Not…I mean, it’s a different kind of exposed.”
Dean nodded, but grabbed his hand as he stood. “Wait! Can I…try something?”
“Okay then.” He disappears out the door, and Cas listens to the sounds of water running for a while before he returns. “Alright, nice and easy,” he murmurs as he carefully helps Cas out of bed.
I shrug, relieved. "A little. We'll have to be gentle with it for a little while. But I thought it was important."
Dean hesitates. “Well…there were challenges. After that many years, I wasn’t really used to affection. It made me edgy, and you’ve seen Benny. He’s an affectionate guy. Knowing where I came from, Benny was careful with me. He insisted on praising me all the time, and even when I acted out he was really careful about my punishments. He was more gentle with me than I thought I deserved, and I was just waiting for the rug to be pulled out from under me. I was convinced he would turn on me one day. So yeah, it took me a long time to learn to trust him.”
Dean takes my hand, tugging me down the hall and knocking on Sam’s door lightly. The door open cautiously, and Sam relaxes as soon as he sees who it is, letting us in and quickly shutting the door behind us. “Hey...how are you holding up?” he asks cautiously.
I shake my head. “No…I’m fine,” I mumble, even as my head finds his shoulder.
I nod, closing my eyes and slowly relaxing into the light pressure of Cas’ hold. “Green,” I say after a few minutes.
He shakes his head. “No, it’s just very fast. And I’m…damp.”
He nods. “My thoughts exactly. It looks like this is something no one’s seen before. Or written about, at least. I mean, Cas is hardly a typical angel. It looks like this is a sort of new territory for everyone.”
Rather than respond (And Dean is fairly sure that Cas couldn’t string the words together to answer the question at the moment anyway), Cas bucks back against his hand as much as he can, moaning lewdly to show his approval. Dean laughs, biting possessively at the still-red flesh of his ass, drawing a pleased sound out of him as he carefully tucks his thumb in under his other fingers, slowly applying pressure. Despite Cas’ loose-limbed stance, Dean takes it slow, gradually pushing further a few centimeters at a time before pulling back. Cas cums twice more during the process, though the last one is weak and leaves him shaking, barely anything spurting out of his tired cock to join the small puddle forming under his hips. Dean murmurs soft praises into his skin, and Cas stays relaxed until Dean’s knuckles are just on the cusp of his rim, when the muscles in his back tense as he draws in a strained breath. Dean backs off, murmuring soothingly.
I wail as he drags his tongue along my shaft slowly, my head thrown back against the pillows. He apparently can’t resist, because he moves up, sinking his teeth into the soft flesh of my neck, a claim. “Yours?” I whisper hesitantly, too afraid to say it louder.
“You don’t mind being woken up,” Cas finishes. “I know. Why are you so worried?”
Dean shrugs. “It’s not my favorite. But I don’t mind it. I know for the most part we don’t switch in the playroom, but if you think it would help you relax, I’m okay with making an exception.”
Castiel hesitates. “Um…not so well, I think,” he answers. “I believe this is the longest I’ve ever experienced what you call pain. Does it always get worse the longer it goes on?”
I chuckle, nipping at the dark bruises starting to form at his throat. “Tell me what happens at the end of the story, Dean.”
“I…really?” I manage. “Why didn’t you ever tell me?”
Dean nods. “I can do that. Are you similarly opposed to penetration with toys by other people?”
He chuckles softly. “What, that? That was nothing. I trust you.”
“I…guess I don’t have much of a choice,” Cas answers uneasily.
Gabriel chuckles. “I sincerely hope so, since I took care of it too. No offense, little brother, but I’m still a little scarier than you.”
I feel a hint of amusement that isn’t mine.
I tug him in by the wrist of his waterlogged coat and close the door against the rain before turning to look at him. He looks down sheepishly. “I’m sorry.”
Slowly, one eye opens, then the other, and he hesitantly looks down at his chest. “Oh.” He runs his fingers lightly over the red mark left over from the wound. “I thought it would be worse. You really did know what you were doing?”
“You are. Does it really make you that uncomfortable?”
“I am,” I murmur, pressing closer. “Or at least...I’m working on it. And I wouldn’t be, if it wasn’t for you.”
“Not to you two, at least,” Gabriel mutters. “Haven’t decided about him yet...”
Summoning his strength, Cas slowly looks up at him. “Dean, that was…it was…I can’t even…” he struggles for words, and Dean chuckles.
It seems like forever before Dean has one, and then two fingers working in beside his tongue, and Cas is reduced to a quivering puddle beneath him, soft sounds of pleasure falling from his open mouth. To his credit, Dean does do a careful check, then goes back to slowly breaking him apart. “Did I pass inspection?” Cas mumbles cheekily.
Cas nods slowly. “Okay…What did you have in mind?”
Dean frowned again, puzzled. “You…really?”
“Okay, okay,” Dean laughed. “It was a group effort. Eileen came up with the idea of separating your grace so the Empty couldn’t hold you, and Sam found the sigil and called Rowena, and Rowena found the spell we needed to get in there. And we didn’t do all that because we needed something from you. We did it because we care about you.”
There was something that Cas wasn’t telling him, but that didn’t really surprise Dean. After all, he hadn’t told Cas anything either. He made a mental note of it, but didn't press the subject. He hesitated for a moment, wondering if he was asking too much, but the picture of the little boy wouldn’t stop nagging the back of his mind.
“Cas…” I murmur, waiting until he looks at me. “Being human doesn’t make you useless. And of course I still wanted you around. I didn’t keep you around because I could use you for what I wanted. I kept you around because I like having you around, angel or not. Whatever happens, I’ll still want you around. You know that, right?”
Cas is quiet for a minute, seemingly frozen. I nudge him lightly. “I…thank you, Father,” he manages. “But I don’t understand what I’ve done to earn such praise. It seems to me that I’ve caused more trouble than anything else. The apocalypse, the Leviathans…I even tried to take your place.”
“Yeah, I kinda didn’t realize until right now.” Cas leans to the other side to speak with a stewardess, but the blood is pounding too hard in Dean’s ears to hear what he says. “What was that?” he asks when he turns back.
Cas nods. “The rules were…somewhat stricter back then than they are now. Ramiel and some of the others defied our father and took human mates. Many of them reproduced, resulting in a new and terrible half-breed of wild beasts. They were cast out. Upon returning to earth, they found that their animalistic offspring had destroyed everything they held dear, including their mates. The beasts were destroyed, but without their connection to heaven, nothing could be done for their mates.”
“No, I’m not mad,” Dean says quickly. He leaves out the part about being relieved. “I just…you saw, what it’s like in there. It’s not a good place. And you still want to tie yourself to me forever? I just don’t get it.”
Dean groans softly, sucking harder around his fingers in answer, and Cas laughs. “We’re in agreement, then. You gonna behave for me?” Dean nods eagerly, licking at his fingers as they move away. Cas hums, planting kisses down his chest, his fingers moving to toy with Dean’s nipple, hearing his sharp gasp. He grins, teasing the other one with his mouth while he pinches and pulls, making him shudder. “You know,” he says conversationally, “I think I could do this all day.” He laughs at Dean’s wary expression. “I won’t though. Not now, anyway. But still, I think I owe you something after yesterday.”
Cas raises an eyebrow at me. “He’s joking, right?” he asks Sam.
The woman huffed, swatting his shoulder gently. “Oh, hush. We’re family. That’s what we do. I’ll take you up on that offer, though. I’ll even drag the old man with me if I can.”
Cas looks at him anxiously. “I…It’s just…different. I don’t like that I put you in danger.”
He smiles, kissing me again. “So?” he says when he pulls back. “Are we doing this or not?”
I tug his hand in the direction of the bunker, but he stops. “Woah, wait a minute. Right now? We can’t just up and leave. I have to at least…pack or something.”
He shrugs. “Something like that. It was the only way to ensure that they’d truly learn to understand humans. They had to live like humans for a few days. And I wouldn’t be a very respectable teacher if I didn’t do it with them.”
Cas hesitates. “I…I don’t understand. I think perhaps you’ve confused me with someone else. I’ve never been a good angel.” I roll my eyes at Dean. Cas would be the only person in the universe to argue with God when he tried complimenting him.
He hesitates, biting his lip for a moment. “Benny says I won’t be able to enjoy it if I’m worried about it affecting our relationship.”
He shrugs. “Proud of you.”

“And you don’t have to worry,” Kevin adds. “We’re not going to tell anyone.”
Gabriel laughs. “I knew it! You’re just using me for my snacks!”
Sam shrugs. “I’m not a professional or anything, but I’ve always thought so. He…doesn’t believe that he’s worthy of things like positive attention or love or happiness anymore. He used to talk about it in his sleep. He’d just beg and argue with dad in his dreams, and I’d have to pretend I was asleep when he woke up crying.”
The man in the chair watches him warily. "What are you doing?"
Love,
Dean turns a little to bury his face against my chest, shuddering as I hold him tighter, partly to give him comfort and partly to keep him still. He cries out as Sam starts digging the point of his knife into the wound, searching for the bullet, and the sound hurts. One of his hands starts to reach out, and I grab it, squeezing it hard. “Almost there, Dean, you’re doing good,” I murmur over his cries. “Sam, hurry.”
Sam chuckles softly. “Well, you’ll have around six weeks to figure it out. Don’t worry, we’ll teach you. The first lesson on being human is that humans need to sleep when they get tired. You’ve been through a lot. You should rest.” No sooner has the word left his mouth than soft snores start coming up from the angel, slightly muffled by my shirt. “Well that was fast.” He turns to leave.
Cas hummed softly, taking a moment to sort out his thoughts. “You humans have these romanticized thoughts about...growing old with someone. It seems that almost all of you want that at some point, and I never really understood why. But I...I think I understand, now. It’s about...building a life, with someone you love more than anything.” He looked up, eyes brimming with tears as he focused on the hunter. “I want to grow old with you, Dean. I want to...figure out how to make breakfast, so I can surprise you. I want to steal french fries off your plate. I want to get frustrated while we try to build swedish furniture together. I want to fall asleep by your side, every night. I want to...what is it called, when you go somewhere and sing badly in front of people?”
“That’s alright Cas, I think I’m just gonna take a nap in my own room. But thanks for helping us out.”
Cas nodded slowly, turning to consider him. “Yes, I’m fine, Dean. Are you okay?”
“Yeah. He asked me to stay in case you needed anything. He should be back in a couple of hours. Did you need something?”
Cas followed his gaze down to the box, then shrugged. “I found a package.”
Sam smiles weakly, nodding. “Yeah, I guess I was just...caught off guard a little. Thanks, De...you too, Gabe. Sorry I freaked out on you.”
Aww, cuddles. Please remember to review if you like it! I love hearing from you!
“Yes,” Cas answers quickly. “Meg, this is my brother Gabriel. He and Dean’s brother were in a car accident. Sam is still in surgery, and we were hoping you could make sure Gabriel is okay.”
“The only case I have is yours, and I still haven’t found anything yet.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Of course, kiddo. You know where to find me.” He ruffles Cas’ hair lightly before gathering his things.
“Good. Now, you and I are going to breathe for a minute.” He presses up against Cas’ back, wrapping his arms around him and feeling Cas relax into the hold. He waits patiently until Cas’ breathing evens out before kissing his neck lightly. “Let’s talk about what’s going to happen, okay? First things first, we’re going to use your color words today. But just in case, I’m going to give you this.”
“Good boy, Dean.”
Cas raises his chin, a little bit defiant. “This is Dean. He’s my boyfriend.” He smirks, seeing a few of the press covering the wedding gathering around them. “That isn’t going to be a problem, is it?”
Dean just laughs, stepping further into the room. “Nothing wrong with being curious. So what do you think?”
“For angels,” I answer, “It’s a melding of two graces. An even exchange. I assume that with us, it would be the same, only with my grace and your soul.”
"If that's what you want."
“I wouldn’t worry about it. You had a busy day. Do you want to go lie down?”
He nods, following me into Dean’s room, where Dean is sitting on one of three beds in the center of the room. The angel looks around for a moment. “I…don’t understand,” he murmurs.
I nod. “Got it. And?”
“Well, the good thing about being the boss,” he smirks, “is making your own rules. So no. I’m staying right here.”
“That was kind of you, si…Dean,” the boy says slowly, testing the name out. “I am indebted to you.”
Cas pants softly against his chest. “Dean? What…I…
Cas whimpers at the hand that finds its way into his hair, tugging lightly. “Dean…”
He laughs. “Yes. Physical contact is a large part of many human rituals and behaviors, but it is not something that most angels experience. If we want them to understand humans better, they have to understand and be able to deal with the contact. As you can imagine, many of them are not thrilled with it yet, but it’s a work in progress.”
I hold it out to him, and he smirks. “I think you’re supposed to put it on.” I roll my eyes at him, but slip it into his finger. He grins, looking at it for a minute before kissing me hard again. “Gabriel is going to be mad he missed this,” he murmurs.
He sighs softly. “I suppose that was a foolish thing to do, then.”
“Help yourself,” Benny chuckles. “I stopped at a bakery on the way over.”
“Shhh, none of that,” he murmurs. “I’m here to stay. Just relax, Dean.” His fingers gently knead at my shoulders, and a soft groan escapes me as the muscles slowly release under his touch. “There you go. Why don’t you lie down for me?” I whine softly, and he smiles, reaching over to turn on the light. “It’s okay, you don’t have to go back to sleep. Just lie down. Let me help you relax.”
Cas is considering him from the chair in front of him, close enough that Dean is just about between his knees, and the angel smiles fondly as he takes in his calm expression, absently running a hand through Dean’s hair. “There are so many things I could do with you today,” he muses. “I haven’t quite settled on one. Any requests?”
When he looks up I realize he’s crying again, and I try to laugh, but it comes out like a strangled sob as I wipe his face gently. He gives a violent shiver, having left in a panic and thus without a coat, and I smile, shrugging my jacket off and draping it over his shoulders. “Come on, let’s go home before you freeze to death.” He sticks close to my side on the way back, pausing just inside the bunker to look at me. “What?” I ask. He smiles, shaking his head and pulling me towards the bathroom. “Cas? What are you doing?”
Slowly, Cas looks up at Dean’s worried expression, pulling him closer. “You’re back…”
“No, I...Cas, I just...let me explain...”
I shake my head. “No, I don’t think so. The thing is, when I think back about all that stuff, and all the girls and everything…I don’t know why I even wanted to. I couldn’t even tell you why I started to begin with.”
When he stirs awake, the room is brighter, and Dean blinks slowly, sitting up. “Morning,” he mumbles, rubbing his eyes. “I miss anything?”
Gabriel laughs. “There’s the Dean I know and love...better run along now kiddo, think your boy toy is looking for you.”
He feels Dean shift, and his hold tightens a little, then relaxes at the reassuring hand through his hair. “Not just yet. I need you to drink this first okay? It’ll help.” Cas is too exhausted to open his eyes long enough to see what this is, but he’s sure, after everything Dean has done so far, that it’s not going to harm him. Feeling the rim of a glass at his lips, he opens a little, grateful for the gentle hand at the back of his neck as Dean carefully tips the glass up. The sharp tang of citrus rushes over his tongue. Orange juice. He swallows when the glass lowers, sighing and nuzzling into Dean’s chest. “Think you can drink a little more for me?” he asks gently. Instead of answering he parts his lips again, and Dean repeats the process until the glass is empty. A pleasant tingle runs through him at the murmured “Good boy,” and the tightening of Dean’s secure hold.
John slowly takes a seat in the open chair, eyeing Gabriel cautiously and waiting for everyone else to take a burger before grabbing one. He takes a bite, humming in surprise. “This is...really good, Dean...”
I nod, glancing back at John. “There was an...unfortunate incident, where a demon tried to take advantage of my lack of powers...Dean was kind enough to save me, and help me get back on my feet. And Gabriel started coming around not long after that.”
“Good,” he mumbles, rubbing his eyes and yawning. “Really good.” He pauses for a minute, thinking. “Did I fall asleep on you?”
“So if Cas was human...it wouldn’t have any claim over him?”
Dean cringes at the word, pulling him back down to the bed. “Cas, I’m okay. I want to stay. Maybe this will be good for both of us, you know? Facing our demons and all that?”
I nod, forming a plan of action. “The sooner we get you fixed up, the sooner the pain will stop. We can either start with your wings, or with…everything else. It’s your choice.”
I frown. “Hey, I thought this was a no-judgment zone!”
“It was interesting. I don’t usually get to see it from that perspective. And Benny had a lot of insight about things.” Dean makes an interested sound, taking another bite of his sandwich. “So, I talked to Benny about his party,” Cas says slowly.
I look back at him in the rearview mirror. “Are you sure you want to be a part of this?” I ask. “You don’t have to be.”
“Well you did that. And I really think he’s going to be okay. We can get him through this.”
Cas hums, reaching over and gently untangling my hand from the wheel, squeezing it lightly. “I’m so sorry, Dean...I can’t imagine how much that must have hurt you...”
Dean turns first, relieved, and reaches out for his hand. Gabriel’s eyes flick over to him, and he sighs. “Goddammit Cas! Don’t scare me like that! I was about to take out a missing persons report on you. Where the hell have you been?” He pauses, glancing back. “Let go of me, Sam. I’m not going to kill your brother. Yet.”
I smile, looking down at the angel in my lap. “Nope. Nothing at all.”
Cas chuckles softly, and I feel the vibration of it against my cheek. “Go to sleep, Dean. I’ll be right here. I promise.”
Surprised, Dean glances up at him. “Do you?”
“I love you too, Cas,” I whisper back.
He nods. “Exactly. Losing your mother was a great tragedy for all of you. And while it certainly doesn’t excuse or justify his behavior in any way, it does make me think that his withholding of affection from you was just a coping mechanism. What he did was wrong, but I’d like to believe that he loved you very much, and that he was proud of the man you became. Maybe he just didn’t know how to tell you that.”
****Quick shout-out to Why_do_you_want_to_know, who reviews literally every chapter of this thing. I look forward to it every time I post a new chapter, and it really motivates me to keep going! So thank you, you lovely person <3****
He shakes his head. “Not your fault,” he sighs. “I’m sorry for snapping at you. I just…it caught me so off guard. I was just going to take a shower, and I turned around and saw this in the mirror.” His wings twitch, irritated by his disdain for them, and my own instinctively move across them in a display of affection. Dean gasps, but it works at appeasing them, and they push back lightly, almost shyly returning the gesture. “More wing talk?” he grumbles. “I feel so left out when you do that.”
I shrug. “I guess. I never really had a choice. When we were kids, Dad was always off hunting, and I had to be in charge. We kept most of the monster stuff from Sammy, so I was the only one who knew how to protect us. He was my little brother. I had to step up for him.”
He’s saved from having to answer by the soft knock on the door. Gabriel peeks in anxiously. “Hey. Can I come in?” Dean nods, propping himself up on one elbow as Gabriel closes the door behind him. “So…you feeling okay?”
He laughs softly at that, nodding. “Okay. What about Sammy?”
“Just watching you...thought I’d give it a try, since you seem to like it so much.”
The kitchen is empty when we arrive, and Cas tells me to sit down while he makes breakfast. I watch him curiously until he looks over his shoulder at me, grinning. He sets down two plates, handing me a fork. “I was just thinking…I’m so glad I have you,” I murmur, smiling.
He laughs roughly. “I know you love it,” he answers, yelping when I smack his ass. “Cas, please!” he moans again.
“Nothing!” Sam says quickly. “Don’t worry about it. You don’t need to know.”
“Oh?”
I nod, my eyes closing for a moment as his nails scratch lightly along my scalp. “Impala, Sir.”
He heard Dean sigh, and the sound of the knob jiggling, before the bathroom door opened, Dean’s silhouette appearing behind the shower curtain. “Look, I know you’re mad...can we talk?”
I’m sitting with Hadriel, going over the finer points of today’s lesson when I hear it. Dean shouts my name. There’s nothing else to determine what the situation is, but he’s frightened, and that’s good enough for me. “I’m sorry, Hadriel. We’ll have to pick up later. Dean is in trouble.”
Cas hums in agreement, kissing his forehead lightly. “Alright then. First things first, let’s sort out your reward. Since you did so well talking to me, I want you to go in the closet and pick a vibrator. Any one you want.”
Woohoo! Please remember to review if you enjoy! It makes me happy :D
I snort, shaking my head. “You wish...I’ll probably be the one saving your feathery ass...”
He gasps out a “
Dean laughs, kissing him softly. “Actually, yes. Not a lot of people, but it works for some.”
“Of course not!” Sam answers. “I’ve been waiting for this for years! I mean, I kind of knew this morning, but I appreciate you guys letting me know.”
He blushes, and I chuckle. “I’ll kick his ass for you next time I see him.” He reaches back to take it off, but something in me makes me reach out and stop him. He looks at me questioningly. “I kind of like it,” I murmur. “But it can’t be very comfortable all twisted like that. Here, let me fix it.” He sits back on his elbows, tipping his head down while I reach for the buckle, and I have to take a deep breath to calm myself enough to remove it. I press a soft kiss to his neck where I pull the leather away, feeling his breath hitch. “You don’t have to wear it if you don’t want to,” I say carefully.
One corner of Cas’ mouth twitched up. “There’s nothing wrong with crying, Dean. You were traumatized every day for ten years. I think you’re allowed to be a little upset.”
“No,” Cas answers. “I’m having a good time. He shouldn’t get to ruin it. I’m okay.”
He frowns for a moment. “Well now I feel bad. You got me two presents and I didn’t give you any yet.”
Dean nodded, reaching out slowly to take his hand and pressing it over his own pounding heart. “I’m real...we’re real.”
Cas nods, stretching out on the bed. “Great. But I don’t think we’re getting out of bed anytime soon.”
Hey guys! Just a quick warning, some descriptions of where Dean came from in this chapter. No graphic depictions of specific non-con experiences, more just descriptions of the environment and what his life was like there.
Sam nods, hugging him closer. “Thank you...and you too, Cas, I...doubt we’d be doing this well without you two.”
Woohoo! So for the exciting news...I decided to make my very own author tumblr which I've never done before. The only thing is I'm kinda lonely over there! Sooo if you're bored or you wanna chat check it out! I'm accepting prompts and asks and whatever else, so we can talk about my life, or your life, or my stories, or basically anything. You can find it at thesongsmithtumbles.tumblr.com. Stop in and say hi! I'll also be posting updates up there for all my stories as I write.
“Just curious.”
. “You mean what we did earlier?” He nods sheepishly, trapping his bottom lip between his teeth. I smile, carefully pulling it free before leaning in, hearing his soft gasp as I gently imprison it between my own, then slowly running my tongue over the imprints left behind. “No honey, I’m not upset at all. In case you couldn’t tell by all the moaning or the raging hard-on, I loved it. I haven’t felt that good in…God, I don’t even know how long. Relax, baby. I’m fine.” He breathes a sigh of relief into the short space between us, and I pull him down for another soft kiss. When he pulls away again he seems to have calmed. “Now, what is this surprise you’re talking about?”
“I love it,” he laughs, putting it carefully back in the box. “And I think it will help. Thank you.”
Cas gives a half-hearted shrug, looking away. “I don’t know. Maybe because I was rude to Benny, or because I got drunk, or because I was dumb enough to go home with some stranger. I’ve messed up a lot in the last twenty-four hours. Take your pick.”
“Well…no, not technically,” he answers. “But my vessel…I suppose I could get a new one…” he mumbles to himself.
Gabriel nods, tugging Sam toward the hallway. “That sounds like a great plan. I’ll keep an eye on things, make sure dear old dad doesn’t get into any trouble.”
I walk over to the door, opening it a crack and picking up the stack of clothes set outside. I help him out of the tub, gently drying him off and tending to the smaller injuries on his legs. The sheer number of injuries is shocking. He flinches, shuddering violently when I try to examine the odd markings on the insides of his thighs. The reaction puts a sick feeling in my stomach, and I cover them quickly, turning away to let him pull underwear and sweatpants on. “Let’s go somewhere more comfortable and fix the rest of you up, okay?” He nods, getting to his feet, and though he still limps it looks like less of a struggle. To my surprise he heads towards my room, freezing in the doorway when he realizes what he’s doing and looking back at me. “That’s fine,” I answer his silent question. “You can stay in here if you want. I don’t mind.” He takes another breath before going inside, sitting down gingerly on the bed. “Alright. Would it be okay with you if I got Sammy to take a look at you? He’s a little better with the medical stuff than I am.”
“And now?” I ask softly.
Cas nodded, smiling softly. “We have time,” he agreed. “So...you really didn’t kill Chuck? You were out for blood.”
He had a brief memory of Cas saying something about a toothbrush, and he checked the bathroom attached to the guest room, happy when he found it waiting for him on the counter, still sealed in plastic. When was the last time he’d had a toothbrush? He couldn’t say for sure, but he couldn’t help but smile as he went through the routine, feeling slightly more human than he had in a while. He rinsed and spit before catching sight of himself in the mirror, freezing in place as he examined this stranger. He hadn’t expected to look great, but the difference between the man in the mirror and what he remembered  looking like was so shocking that he didn’t notice Cas in the doorway.
Love,
He chuckles. “I bet it is. If it starts getting stiff again, let me know before it gets bad and we’ll take care of it.”
Dean smiles. “I know. But I know you were kinda worried about it too.”
It takes a few minutes, but slowly, Sam’s eyes crack open, and he blinks blearily. “D’n…?”
I stare at him for a moment. “Okay, you’re going to have to explain that to me. What do you mean they ‘remember’ me?” Instead of explaining, he spreads his good wing farther, and I see a small imperfection. Upon closer inspection, they look like fingerprints burned into the feathers. “What…”
Dean has to stifle a chuckle at that, and Raphael turns to eye him critically. He refuses to cow under the harsh gaze, meeting it challengingly. “Who is your…friend?” he asks finally.
He nods. “They don’t. But I can still tell that something bad happened. The fact that I can’t remember it is…distressing.”
He follows my gaze, going red and tearing his hand away from his crotch. “Sorry, sorry, I didn’t realize…”
“You took care of him too,” Benny points out. “You did really well. I’m proud of you, kid. I know it ain’t easy to face your fears. You want me to stick around until he wakes up, or you think you got it from here?”
He yawns. “Alright, well we can discuss it in the morning. But you can’t just not sleep. Especially not now with all the healing you have to do. Let’s get you back to bed.” Cas frowns, but doesn’t resist as I help him off the couch and back into his room. “Do you want me to stay with you?” I offer.
I frown at him. “How will that make anything better?”
He frowns at that.
Cas nodded understandingly. “That’s okay. We’re figuring that out. And I know it’s frustrating. Ten years is a long time, and it’s going to take a while to get past that. But we’re getting there. You’re saving yourself, you know. And you’re doing a good job of it.”
Claire laughed, clapping him on the shoulder lightly. “Whoa, easy there old man, you’re gonna give yourself a stroke. Dean, it’s 2021, no one who’s worth anything gives a shit about that. I’m just happy you finally figured it out. Congrats. But more importantly, what are you gonna do about Cas?”
Cas laughs, kissing his nose. "I know, I'm the boring one. If you hurry up I'll let you in the shower with me. And you can have your way with me tomorrow."
I chuckle softly, kissing his forehead. “I’m looking forward to it.”
I pick him up, pulling him into my lap and smiling as he pulls the elephant along with him. “I see. That’s a very fuzzy elephant.”
He frowns for a moment, then seems to remember. “Oh, yes. Gabriel gave it to me. He said it was very important, and that you’d understand. He wouldn’t tell me why.”
“I can imagine,” Sam replies, grabbing something from the closet. “Here,” he says, holding the angel’s coat out to him. “I got the bloodstains out.”
There’s a hint of worry in his voice, a note he usually reserves only for Sam. The sound of it makes me uncomfortable. How is Karael here? Why would he turn on his own kind, join forces with the ones he was supposed to protect against?
He nods, and suddenly we’re back in the bunker. “Car’s in the garage, before you ask.” He looks over to where I still hold Dean, holding a hand out. “May I?” I nod, and suddenly Dean is wiped clean of the dirt and sweat, his wound healed over. “There. At least now he won’t be in pain when he wakes up.”
porn. I glance over at him, but he’s focused on the video, so I turn back to it. It’s not very long, but imagining Cas watching this, thinking about doing it, has me more excited than I want to admit. I shift uncomfortably as the video ends, hoping he doesn’t notice. “Well, that’s…certainly interesting…”
The connection cuts off suddenly, and I have to fight to keep from throwing the phone across the room. I dress quickly, pounding on Sam’s door. “Sammy!”
Gabriel blushes again, fidgeting slightly. “Well, I...you know how it goes, I just...it started just for fun, but...it helps me, I guess, I...I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but I can be a bit...impulsive, and...I get myself into trouble sometimes...that kind of relationship, it...it’s a lot of fun, but it also...Look, I was surprised too, I thought I’d hate having someone tell me what to do, but...it helps, to have him there to keep me in line. But sometimes I don’t think, and I mojo my way out of stuff. I made the cuffs to stop that from happening.”
John smiles, slowly taking a step in. “Hey son. Long time no see.”
I nod, kissing him softly. “Of course…glad I could help.”
“I guess that’s true,” I concede.
The emotion rising in his throat surprised him, and Dean had to swallow it back hard. He took a moment to look at the two women across from him. “I think I’m...starting to see that,” he said finally. “And I, uh...I actually wanted to thank you both. You two...you’ve always been there for me, even when I didn’t think I wanted the help. And you always accepted me, even the bad parts...even when I was angry and bitter and pushed you away. I can’t, uh...I can’t say that about a lot of people, but...I really appreciate having you.”
“I think I understand,” I say when he seems to be done.
Cas chuckles. “It would be my honor.” He sighs. “Is Anna coming at least?”
Cas sleeps soundly for a few hours before Sam slips in to check on him. “How’s he been?” he asks softly.
“What can I say? Cas shrugs. "It’s fun to try stuff with you.”
The paint itched slightly as the heart dried on his cheek, but it was quickly forgotten when Cas tugged him into a kiss. “Feeling better?”
I nod slowly, considering the sleeping boy in my lap. “I know. I have to say, it surprised me as well. I’m glad, though. I owe him that, and so much more.”
Sam nods, letting out a breath. “Yeah, fair enough. Still, it...it was kinda nice, seeing him nervous. I can’t remember ever seeing that.”
I raise an eyebrow at him. “What does that mean? What did you do?”
He shakes his head slowly. “I...no, I don’t...Dean, I...”
I take a shallow breath. “Yes.”
Sam snorts. “When did you watch “Lilo and Stitch”?” he asks.
Dean shrugged, examining it carefully. “No, I guess not. Usually the memories are the worst part, but…it helps, having you all here.” He glanced over at Cas. “One of these days you’re going to have to stab me with one of these and see what happens.”
I smile slightly, squeezing his hand. “I told him that we’re together, and that you love me...that you’ve been helping put me back together after what he did...that I never feel ashamed when I’m with you...”
Love,
Dean raises an eyebrow at him. “Cas, we’re fine. You fixed us up. It’s okay.”
He chuckles, and I feel the vibration in my chest. “Sure thing, buddy,” he murmurs, carefully hugging me back. “And I’m glad you’re embracing your feelings and stuff, but maybe warn someone before you do that next time.”
Dean sighs softly. “Me too...I guess we’ll see soon enough.”
Eileen smiled, squeezing Dean’s shoulder, her other hand coming up to rest lightly against his chest. “Breathe,” the hunter reminded him gently. “You did it. You saved him.”
With most of his wounds almost healed, Cas has made a lot of progress. Though still stiff, he seems to be doing much better physically. He still has nightmares and occasionally has a hard time separating them from reality, but the drawing seems to help, and sometimes he shows them to me. He’s started talking out loud a little more often, and has been far less jumpy. But when I wake in the middle of the night cold I know something is wrong. Cas is possibly the most insistent sleep cuddler I’ve ever known, so if I’m cold he’s not here. I frown, getting up and searching the bunker for him, finding nothing. When I double back to my room to see if he came back, I notice a pile of ripped up pieces of paper on the floor. Putting it together, I realize that it’s one of Cas’ nightmare drawings, and after a staring at it for a minute I reel back in shock, seeing myself as one of his torturers. Suddenly, every time he’s spontaneously flinched away from me makes perfect sense. It isn’t too hard to piece together what happened, and I curse as I grab my coat, shoving my shoes on and running out the front door, wondering how far a delusional, panicking, human angel on foot could get. I thank whoever might be listening that there’s snow on the ground for him to leave footprints in, following his trail into the woods outside the bunker. I listen closely, relieved to hear short, gasped breaths that tell me he isn’t far. I approach cautiously, watching his frame tremble where it’s curled in the snow.
He comes down slowly, realizing belatedly that he’s sticky, though he isn’t sure when exactly he came. His arms have been released, and Cas is holding him close, murmuring softly. “So good for me, sweetheart, so beautiful...”
“They just brought him out of surgery,” she explains. “They’re getting him settled in the ICU. His injuries are pretty extensive, and they’re keeping him knocked out and on a ventilator for at least tonight. But he has been surprisingly stable so far, and if he stays that way they might try to wean him off the drugs tomorrow or the next day.”
Cas blinked at him for a moment while he processed this, and Dean watched him cautiously. “Jack...is God?” he repeated finally. “He...he’s just a kid...”
Soooo yeah I thought we all needed fluffs. Sorry for the wait on this guys, I'm doing my best and I promise I'm writing whennnn I'm not busy smooching my girlfriend :D
I smile, using my free hand to stroke lightly through his hair in rhythm with the hand in his feathers. He lets out a soft moan, and I can’t help but chuckle at the idea that his wings are trying to make up for causing him so much pain and fear earlier; trying to show him that they’re on his side. I probe lightly around the link, searching carefully for any pain or hesitation, but don’t find any. “How are they feeling now?” I ask.
“I don’t think you’re going to find him, Dean,” I say. “I think we’re going to have to let him find us. Or me.”
Dean laughed, shaking his head. “You’re taking bets on me now?”
“Have you been holding out on me? Sneaky bastard,” he laughs.
“I woke up feeling weird. I think I had a nightmare, but I don’t remember it,” Cas starts, taking a sip of water. Dean nods encouragingly, hugging him close. “And then I just felt so…embarrassed about what I’d done, and I started thinking that there was no way you could possibly care about me, and then I got scared that I’d do something wrong and you’d leave. And from there it kind of…got away from me.”
Cas goes red, and Sam frowns in confusion. “Gabriel,” I warn, but he gets up, walking closer. Cocking his head to the side, he reaches out, touching Cas’ forehead lightly before gasping and jumping back. “What?” I ask cautiously.
So as it turns out, I had 23 chapters of this floating around my google docs...and since I have an abundance of time at the moment, I finally edited them and got them ready to post! Woo! I hope some of you who followed this back in the day are still around, I really love this story and can't wait to share it with you again!
Dean smiles, his hold tightening. “Fuck yes. You thought I was just saying that? I wish you could have seen yourself the way I saw you. It was amazing, Castiel. I’ve never seen anything like it. You have to believe me. You should be proud of yourself. I’m proud of you.”
Dean lets a growl slip through his teeth. “Will you shut up with the ‘boyfriend’ thing? You know it’s not like that. I’m just…worried about him. He’s our friend, and he hasn’t been answering our calls for days. That isn’t usually a sign of anything good, Sam.”
“Don’t you dare,” I interrupt. “It wouldn’t be you.”
I smile, kissing him softly and sending the feeling back as I hold him against me. I continue the gentle conditioning of his wings even when he falls asleep, exhausted by the morning’s excitement.
Sam opened the door cautiously, followed by Rowena and Eileen. He grinned when he saw Cas, walking over and tugging him into a hug. “Cas! Hey, it’s good to have you back. How do you feel?”
He considers it for a moment before nodding, letting me drag his sweatpants down, watching as his hard cock springs free. Kinky bastard. I look at up him, waiting for a command, and he grins. “Well it’s not going to suck itself, is it pet?”
I return to my book until Cas begins to stir again. He blinks up at me, puzzled. “Sam?” he murmurs.
Sam frowned slightly, looking him over. “Dean, do you...do you love him?” he asked softly.
I pause in my rinsing. “I’m not sure I’m following here. What danger are we talking about?”
“The wards prevent anything with malicious intent from entering,” Gabriel answers. “I only dropped in to check on my two favorite hunters.”
He smiles. “I think it’s time I give Earth another chance. I can’t thank you enough. You’ve been very kind.”
, he writes.
“Thank you, Castiel,” the hunter mumbled into the bedspread.
He nods thoughtfully, taking the tray out to the kitchen, and I drift off to the sound of running water. When I wake up again I’m cold, and I look around for a moment, confused. Cas is sitting at the end of the bed, chewing on his bottom lip as he draws furiously. “Hey, you alright?” I murmur. He glances up, nodding. “Sam brought you that, huh? What are you drawing?” He frowns, clutching the pad against his chest. “Okay, I won’t look. As long as it makes you feel better.”
He nods reluctantly. “I know, I know. I’m sorry. So what do we do?”
“You don’t have to apologize, Cas,” Sam assures him.
He shrugs. “It could. But don’t you think it’d hurt him if one of his brothers is behind this?”
“Yeah, that makes two of us,” I answer. “I thought you didn’t have your grace.”

“Huh? Oh, yes, I, uh...I can definitely see the appeal of this place. And the water pressure’s not half bad...”
Dean nodded, biting his lip. “Yeah. I...kind of have for a long time. At first I thought it was just that you were nice to me, you know, but…I’ve never felt like this before. And it’s fucking terrifying, and I didn’t want to tell you because I didn’t want to make things weird or hurt you. And I know you don’t feel like that, and that’s okay, really. I get it. I just...wanted you to know because it’s…not going away. So if you want me to leave, I’ll...figure something out, it’s fine...”
“What for?” he asks, grinning. “I don’t have a problem with it.”
Cas grins, leaning forward to hug him tightly. “So, are we just going to sit at the kitchen table all day?”
I nod. “So much better,” I breathe. He moves over to the other side, repeating the process, and this time it’s much easier to relax. His hands continue upwards, relieving the pain in my shoulder and neck, before moving back down again, going over the work he just did and checking for any spots he missed. “Does it still hurt anywhere?” he asks.
I look away from him, taking a breath. “You…you’re always doing that. You’re always focusing on my pleasure, even if I haven’t earned it, and…it’s good. It’s really good. But I did this because…I mean, I want…”
“Bitch,” I mutter back.
“Oh. Um, I’ll just go find some clothes for you,” he says quickly. “You might want to use the baby soap so it won’t burn him,” he murmurs to me, nodding towards the cabinet. I nod, and he closes the door behind him, which seems to make Cas feel better. He looks at me and gives a short nod.
Cas nods, shrugging. “I’m glad you got to tell him how much he hurt you. Whether he remembers or not, you deserve to get that off your chest. How did it feel?”
He hangs up, and Cas looks up at him. “Well?”
Dean rubs at the back of his neck sheepishly. “Yeah. Well, you know how you were telling me a couple of weeks ago about how your landlord is a self-righteous dick? You said your lease is up soon, so I was kinda thinking it would be nice if you didn’t have to deal with him anymore. Maybe you could…I don’t know. Come here, or something, instead…”
I laugh, kissing his nose. "You're insatiable, aren't you? Aren't you tired?"
“I-I can’t...Cas, I can’t, it was nice while it lasted, but h-he’s here and I...I can’t be this way, if he ever found out...fuck, this can’t happen, I can’t...”
“Empty,” I growl out, shifting a little.
“My pleasure.” He can hear the smirk in it, but can’t bring himself to care as the angel’s hands run smoothly over him, spreading him wider. He jolts away at the warm, wet feeling around his hole, though the fingers at his hips hold him steadily in place. “Dean? Talk to me.”
Dean snorts. “I’ve created a monster, haven’t I?”
“And you trust me?”
“How are you feeling?” Sam asks.
I shrug. “I think he’s okay. He hasn’t stirred in a while. Poor guy’s just exhausted.”
He can feel Dean grin against his skin, and he knows something is up, but Dean just continues his leisurely movements. “Yeah? What’s it feel like?”
Hey guys! Before you start reading, just know that I have EXCITING NEWS at the bottom! Okay, now that you know that, enjoy!
Cas frowned, but nodded, watching him carefully. “I’m listening.”
I sigh, turning halfway and pulling him down for a long, slow kiss. He returns it gently, his thumb stroking along my jaw as he opens to the light prodding of my tongue, sighing softly into my mouth as I pull him closer. It’s more tender than urgent, and I suckle at his bottom lip lightly before pulling away a few inches, smiling at the flush in his cheeks. “Okay, I’m up.” He smiles, but there’s something hesitant in his expression. “What’s wrong? You look scared.”
“D-Dean?” he repeats cautiously, almost a whisper. “Are you…okay?”
“No,” I answer. “It’s not my story to tell. That’s up to you, and if you’d rather not I understand. But I am glad you told me. Thank you.”
“It’s also not killing a lot of people,” Sam interjected calmly, glaring at Dean for a moment. “There’s lots and lots of people who get it and recover. But it is still dangerous. We don’t want to scare you, but being that you’re human now, this is something that could affect you too.”
“Are you sure?” Dean asks. “I completely understand if you want to keep that relationship between you and her. That’s okay.”
All day, Cas remains entrenched in his books, sitting still and silent in a chair while Sam and I watch TV, as if he didn’t just come for the first time in his life. Actually, it seems too harsh to think of it that way. It hadn’t just been about coming. It was probably the first intimate moment Cas had ever had, and certainly a new one for me, and there he was, cool as a cucumber reading his books while I sweated like a pig, everything suddenly too warm as I run the memory over in my head, trying not to let Sam know anything is up. Occasionally, Cas would glance up, staring at me and cocking his head to the side in thought before returning to the book. I mentally curse myself for being such a girl about this. Why should I be expecting him to want to talk about it? Why do I want to talk about it? Maybe casual sex is all angels do. Hell, it’s one of my favorite pastimes. But then, why does it hurt so much to think about it that way? It doesn’t make any sense, and the longer I sit here the worse it gets. Get it together, Dean! I order myself silently. It doesn’t work, so instead I plan a quick getaway. “Gonna take a walk…be back,” I mumble, jumping up and out the door before either of them can respond. The fresh air is a nice reprieve from the stares and silence, and my head starts to clear as I walk slowly down the road away from the bunker. There’s a sudden rustle behind me, and I’m already drawing my blade when I turn around to find the one person who could possibly make this worse.
