Of this disorder Molly could give no explanation, and Moriarty, having attempted, for some time, to persuade Sherlock to talk, retired, after ordering Molly to remain during the night, and to inform him, in the morning, of Sherlock’s condition.
After a long pause, 'It is now about eighteen years since I first heard that music,' said La Voisin; 'I remember it was on a fine summer's night, much like this, but later, that I was walking in the woods, and alone. I remember, too, that my spirits were very low, for one of my boys was ill, and we feared we should lose him. I had been watching at his bed-side all the evening, and went out for a little fresh air, the day had been very sultry. As I walked under the shades, I heard music at a distance, and thought it was Claude playing upon his lute, as he often did of a fine evening, at the cottage door. But, when I came to a place where the trees opened, (I shall never forget it!) and stood looking up at the north-lights, which shot up the heaven to a great height, I heard all of a sudden such sounds!—they came so as I cannot describe. It was like the music of angels, and I looked up again almost expecting to see them in the sky. When I came home, I told what I had heard, but they laughed at me, and said it must be some of the shepherds playing on their pipes, and I could not persuade them to the contrary. A few nights after, however, my wife herself heard the same sounds, and was as much surprised as I was, and Father Denis frightened her sadly by saying, that it was music come to warn her of her child's death, and that music often came to houses where there was a dying person.'
But Count Wilkes did not long confine himself to silent assiduities; Sebastian declared his passion to Sherlock, and made proposals to Moriarty, who encouraged, though Sherlock rejected, him: with Moriarty for his friend, and an abundance of vanity to delude him, he did not despair of success. Sherlock was astonished and highly disgusted at this perseverance, after he had explained his sentiments with a frankness that would not allow the Count to misunderstand them, especially when they were accompanied by some rather mortifying deductions.
Sherlock leaned back against the wall; slowly he descended to the floor, facing the body of his father.  Eventually he fell into a kind of slumber, but the images of his waking mind still haunted his reason. He thought he saw his father approaching him with a benign countenance; then, smiling mournfully and pointing upwards, his lips moved, but, instead of words, Sherlock heard sweet music borne on the distant air. The strain seemed to swell louder, and he awoke. The vision was gone, but music yet came to his ear in strains such as angels might breathe.
While he mused, two sentinels walked up the rampart in earnest conversation, of which he caught a few words, and learned from these, that one of their comrades had fallen down senseless. Soon after, three other soldiers appeared slowly advancing from the bottom of the terrace, but he heard only a low voice, that came at intervals. As they drew near, he perceived this to be the voice of him, who walked in the middle, apparently supported by his comrades; and he again called to them, enquiring what had happened. At the sound of his voice, they stopped, and looked up, while he repeated her question, and was told, that Roberto, their fellow of the watch, had been seized with a fit, and that his cry, as he fell, had caused a false alarm.
'What reasons were there to suppose she destroyed herself, then?' said Bertolini.—'Aye, what reasons?' said Verezzi.—'How happened it, that her remains were never found? Although she killed herself, she could not bury herself.' Moriarty looked indignantly at Verezzi, who began to apologize. 'Your pardon, Signor,' said he: 'I did not consider, that the lady was your relative, when I spoke of her so lightly.'
'I say, I could give you other instances of my power and of my character, which it seems you do not understand, or you would not defy me.—I could tell you, that, when once my resolution is taken— not you but also your countrymen will suffer - but I am talking to a baby. Let me, however, repeat, that terrible as are the examples I could recite, the recital could not now benefit you; for, though your repentance would put an immediate end to opposition, it would not now appease me.—I will have vengeance as well as justice.'
'No, they dined long ago, in an apartment at the north end of the castle, but I know not when they are to go, for the Signor told old Carlo to see them provided with every thing necessary. They have been walking all about the castle, and asking questions of the workmen on the ramparts. I never saw such strange-looking men in my life; I am frightened whenever I see them.'
He had discovered in his son’s early years an uncommon genius of mind; his powers of observation were considerable; and moreover he applied these observations with the purpose of explaining the world around him, both natural and social.  These ‘deductions’, however, were not always well received by those who were the subject; and Sherlock, being a boy of warm affections; was hurt by this reaction and knew not how to reconcile it with what had been declarations of truth, and fact. It had the effect of making him reserved; and many thought him unfriendly; but no-one who saw him in the bosom of his home could doubt of his warm and tender heart.
He then thought of his unfortunate brother, and, shuddering with grief and horror, the suggestions of imagination seized his mind with all the force of truth, and he believed, that the form he had seen was supernatural. He trembled, breathed with difficulty, an icy coldness touched his cheeks, and fears for a while overcame his judgment for a time, before he with difficulty calmed himself.
Having waited in silent expectation for a few minutes, with his eyes fixed on the door, it was again opened, and the same person appeared, whom he now knew to be Moriarty. He looked cautiously round, without perceiving Sherlock, then, stepping forward, closed the door, and left the corridor. Soon after, Sherlock heard the door fastened on the inside, and he withdrew to his chamber, wondering at what he had witnessed.
“Oh, shit,” says John, who grabs him by the shoulder and rolls him into the recovery position, rubbing Sherlock’s back as he sucks down lungfuls of air and coughs.  “It’s OK,” John says, at least half to himself, “you’re just winded,” and then more businesslike: “did you lose consciousness?”
Moriarty, in a long conversation with M. Anderson, arranged the plan to be pursued respecting Sherlock, and M. Anderson proposed to be at Venice, as soon as he should be informed, that the nuptials were concluded.
Sherlock looked again from the window, and saw a young man spring from the bushes into the road, followed by a couple of dogs. The stranger was in a hunter's dress. His gun was slung across his shoulders, the hunter's horn hung from his belt, and in his hand was a small staff, which, as he held it, added to the manly grace of his figure, and assisted the agility of his steps.
Holmes proceeded: 'I know you too well, my Sherlock, to believe, that you would pass over the opportunity to acquire knowledge, but the observance of this is of the utmost importance to your tranquillity. Hear, then, what I am going to tell you. The closet, which adjoins my chamber at Bakersfield, has a sliding board in the floor. You will know it by a remarkable knot in the wood, and by its being the next board, except one, to the wainscot, which fronts the door. At the distance of about a yard from that end, nearer the window, you will perceive a line across it, as if the plank had been joined;—the way to open it is this:—Press your foot upon the line; the end of the board will then sink, and you may slide it with ease beneath the other. Below, you will see a hollow place.' Holmes paused for breath, and Sherlock sat fixed in deep attention. 'Do you understand these directions, my dear?' said he. Sherlock assured him that he did.
Connie looks expectantly at John. “Yes,” he agrees. And then feeling like he should say something else: “It should be very exciting.”
In the cool of the evening the party embarked in Moriarty's gondola, and rowed out upon the sea. The red glow of sun-set still touched the waves, and lingered in the west, where the melancholy gleam seemed slowly expiring, while the dark blue of the upper aether began to twinkle with stars. Sherlock sat, given up to pensive and sweet emotions. As he listened to the measured sound of the oars, and to the remote warblings that came in the breeze, his softened mind returned to the memory of his departed parents and to John, and tears stole to his eyes.
'Nor has he done so, I hope, sir,' said Sherlock sharply, 'The affairs of M. de Motteville may, I trust, yet be settled without deeply injuring his creditors, and in the meantime I should be very happy to remain at Bakersfield.'
“Anyway, later on, the young lovers get intercepted by the father and the rejected suitor and Basilio announces that he will kill himself if he cannot be with his beloved, stabs himself right there on the stage in front of poor old Kitri, very dramatic. As he lays there dying he asks Kitri’s father for permission to marry her which he of course gives, knowing Basilio’s about to die, but you see, John, he’s faked it! He hasn’t really committed suicide at all! With that impediment removed, up pops Basilio, alive as anything, and off they go to get married and be happy ever after. It’s a bit over-wrought,” Violet reflects slowly, “but it’s terrific fun. And cracking dancing, too, of course.”
“What, no, I didn’t say anything?” John twitters as he desperately casts around for something innocuous to look at. Like that nice chair, there. Plastic. Beige. Nice.
“Of course rhythmic gymnastics all in uproar after the attack on Sarah Sawyer a few days ago, she’s a friend of yours, John? How’s she holding up?”
As Sherlock approached the shores of Italy he began to discriminate the rich features and varied colouring of the landscape—the purple hills, groves of orange pine and cypress, shading magnificent villas, and towns rising among vineyards and plantations. The noble Brenta, pouring its broad waves into the sea, now appeared, and, when he reached its mouth, the barge stopped, that the horses might be fastened which were now to tow it up the stream. This done, Sherlock gave a last look to the Adriatic, and the barge began to slowly glide between the green and luxuriant slopes of the river. The grandeur of the Palladian villas, that adorn these shores, was considerably heightened by the setting rays, which threw strong contrasts of light and shade upon the porticos and long arcades, and beamed a mellow lustre upon the orangeries and the tall groves of pine and cypress, that overhung the buildings. The scent of oranges, of flowering myrtles, and other scented plants was diffused upon the air, and often, from these embowered retreats, a strain of music stole on the calm, and 'softened into silence.'
“Like a motherfucker,” Sarah replied brutally. “Nothing stronger than panadeine either – still under the doping regs.”
for difficulty of movements as well as artistic interpretation (music, how the apparatus is moved, etc).  They really do have a kiss n' cry area where they have to wait to get the scores (like figure skating in the winter olympics). It looks awful.
As he crossed the hall, a person entered it by the great door, whom, as his eyes hastily glanced that way, he imagined to be Moriarty, and he was passing on with quicker steps, when he heard the well-known voice of John.
The last strain of distant music now died in air, for the gondola was far upon the waves, and the party determined to have music of their own. The Count Wilkes, who sat next to Sherlock, and who had been observing him for some time in silence, snatched up a violin, and played with the finger of harmony herself, then later his voice, a fine tenor, sang in a rondeau full of tender sadness.
Towards his chamber he now hastened, as fast as his steps would bear him, for he still perceived the sounds of confusion at a distance, and he endeavoured, by taking his way through some obscure rooms, to avoid encountering the persons, whose looks had terrified him before, as well as those parts of the castle, where the tumult might still rage.
His calculations concerning fortune in this alliance were guided rather by his wishes, than by any hint of John’s, or strong appearance of probability; and, when he rested her expectation on the wealth of Madame Petitbois, he seemed totally to have forgotten, that the latter had a daughter. John, however, had not forgotten this circumstance, and the consideration of it had made him so modest in his expectations from Madame Petitbois, that he had not even named the relationship in his first conversation with Monsieur Mycroft. But, whatever might be the future fortune of Sherlock, the present distinction, which the connection would afford for himself, was certain, since the splendour of Madame Petitbois's establishment was such as to excite the general envy and partial imitation of the neighbourhood. Thus had he consented to involve his younger brother in an engagement, to which he saw only a distant and uncertain conclusion, with as little consideration of his happiness, as when he had so precipitately forbade it: for though he himself possessed the means of rendering this union not only certain, but prudent, to do so was no part of his present intention.
I am having dinner with my parents and brother. There are no chips on the menu. This does not qualify as ‘celebrating’. SH
This man, with another, whose face betrayed either the consciousness of guilt, or the fear of punishment, Moriarty ordered to be chained instantly, and confined in a strong room, which had formerly been used as a prison. Thither, likewise, he would have sent all his guests, had he not foreseen the consequence of so bold and unjustifiable a proceeding. As to those, therefore, he contented himself with swearing, that no man should pass the gates, till this extraordinary affair had been investigated, and then sternly bade his husband retire to his apartment, whither he sent Sherlock also.
“Oh- ah, it’s the boys! Wooo-hooo!!” There was a small gale of applause and cheers from the women in the room.
Sherlock would have been astonished at the assertions of this eloquent speech, had not his mind been so overwhelmed by the sudden shock it had received, that he scarcely heard a word of what was latterly addressed to him. Whatever were Mycroft’s weaknesses, he might have avoided to accuse himself with those of compassion and tenderness to the feelings of others, and especially to those of Sherlock.
Winking at Sarah as she shook her head at him, John trotted over to grab his gear. Pulling on sweat pants over his shorts, he thought he saw Mary Morstan look him up and down. Perhaps not totally wasted, then. Turning around to yank a t-shirt over his bare chest, he suddenly noticed Sherlock Holmes, regarding John with a focused expression, ducking his eyes away when he became conscious of John’s returning his gaze. Catching up the rest of his stuff, John crossed over to him, snaking his way around the women’s team: some still stripping their shoes and tracksuits off, some already warming up on the floor.
'You should have been there to have done that,' replied Sebastian. 'You would have been bold enough to have taken it by the throat, though it had been the devil himself; we could not take such a liberty, perhaps, because we are not so well acquainted with him, as you are! But, as I was saying, it stole by us so quickly, that we had not time to get rid of our surprise, before it was gone. We kept constant watch all that night, but we saw it no more.'
In a half-daze he stumbles on a waitress with a tray of canape-sized beef wellingtons. He crams two in his mouth and grabs another in each hand, wondering if he can position himself to stop the waitress from moving without being too obvious. He settles for hovering a hand possessively over the wellingtons (
wants,” Sherlock sneered, looming over John as he rose from the table. “If you’ll excuse me, I have a training session,” he said, dropping the phone on the table and striding away.
To his own solitary chamber he once more returned, and there thought again of the late conversation with Moriarty, and of the evil he might expect from opposition to his will. But his power did not appear so terrible to Sherlock’s imagination, as it had formerly: a sacred pride was in his heart, that taught it to swell against the pressure of injustice, and almost to glory in the quiet sufferance of ills, in a cause, which had also the interest of John for its object. For the first time, Sherlock felt the full extent of his own superiority to Moriarty, and despised the authority, which, till now, he had only feared.
After giving his son a familiar lecture on the opportune times to give well-meaning advice, Holmes was silent till he reached the chateau, where his wife had retired to her chamber. The languor and dejection, that had lately oppressed her, now returned with increased effect. On the following day, symptoms of fever appeared, and Holmes, having sent for medical advice, learned, that her disorder was a fever of the same nature as that, from which he had lately recovered. She had, indeed, taken the infection, during her attendance upon him, and, her constitution being too weak to throw out the disease immediately, it had lurked in her veins, and occasioned the heavy languor of which she had complained. Holmes, whose anxiety for his wife overcame every other consideration, detained the physician in his house. He remembered the feelings and the reflections that had called a momentary gloom upon his mind, on the day when he had last visited the fishing-house, in company with Madame Holmes, and he now admitted a presentiment, that this illness would be a fatal one. But he effectually concealed this from her, and from his son. The physician, when asked by Holmes for his opinion of the disorder, replied, that the event of it depended upon circumstances which he could not ascertain. Madame Holmes seemed to have formed a more decided one; but her eyes only gave hints of this. She frequently fixed them upon her anxious friends with an expression of pity, and of tenderness, as if she anticipated the sorrow that awaited them.
“Ooh, we shall have to watch that on the TV tomorrow evening. Simone Biles is tipped to just wipe the floor with everyone, I heard. The American, you know.”
There’s no response but a small flash of movement from the stadium’s roof, amongst the air conditioning units and piping. “Sherlock!” John screams again.
Molly was all amazement.  'Yes, Signora Morstan, herself, who caused that Venetian gentleman to be killed, and has been popping about from place to place, ever since, as I hear.'
“What have we got?” John said, walking up to Sherlock’s side. Sherlock scrolls through the phone and begins to play John the footage. In some of them he can clearly be seen, darting across the bottom of the frame. Some appear to just be seconds of the scenery (or whatever you want to call pathways of an Olympic village), John only partly in frame and only the occasional huff of breath from Sherlock audible as takes the shot. He looks up at Sherlock, whose expression is typically inscrutable. He will wait for John to get the answer himself, he realises. John takes the phone and swipes back and forth between the videos, brow furrowed. He looks at the last ones shot, each angle slightly different as Sherlock hung from the balcony, each with a different amount of John visible – sometimes his whole body, or just the top of his head. John scurrying, running, commando crawling across the ground; but he’s always in the shot, even if just partially.
In a few moments, their soft melody was accompanied by a voice so full of pathos, that it evidently sang not of imaginary sorrows. Its sweet and peculiar tones he thought he had somewhere heard before; yet, if this was not fancy, it was, at most, a very faint recollection. His emotion can scarcely be imagined, when he heard sung, with the taste and simplicity of true feeling, one of the popular airs of his native province, to which he had so often listened with delight, when a child, and which he had so often heard his father repeat! To this well-known song, never, till now, heard but in his native country, his heart melted, while the memory of past times returned. The pleasant, peaceful scenes of Gascony, the tenderness and goodness of his parents, the taste and simplicity of his former life—all rose to his fancy, and formed a picture, so sweet and glowing, so strikingly contrasted with the scenes, the characters and the dangers, which now surrounded him—that his mind could not bear to pause upon the retrospect, and shrunk at the acuteness of its own sufferings.
Thus circumstanced, he tried to banish reflection, but his busy mind would still hover over the subjects of his interest, and he heard the clock of the castle strike two, before he closed his eyes.
Matt (?) held him lightly by the elbow and pivoted him 180 degrees, without any apparent effort at all. “Off in a world of your own mate. Here, John wants you.”  With the kind of smile that was obviously meant to be helpful, he pointed out over the surface of the water to where a blond head was bobbing, arm just dropping down to the surface of the water now he was sure Sherlock had seen him.
With abrupt candour, that endeared Sherlock to John, if possible, more than ever, John was told that he was an idiot; and reminded that Sherlock, who at nineteen was some time from achieving the age of his majority at twenty-one, could not be married without the consent of a guardian.  John was confident they could lie to the friar and so be married; but was crestfallen when Sherlock then pointed out this would certainly invalidate the marriage in the eyes of the law.
After some deliberation, Sherlock determined that Moriarty should not be informed of this event till the morning. With Molly alone, therefore, he performed some of the last solemn offices for the dead, and compelled himself to watch during the night, by the body of his deceased brother. The tremendous storm raged around the castle as Sherlock performed this mournful duty for his brother, as he had so recently for his mother and father.
Could Sherlock be heading ‘round the front, to meet his family as they come out? No, surely not, he’d be annoyed by the crowds. Maybe he’d go ‘round to the buses, go straight back to the village?   He wouldn’t go back without his coach, though, surely – that’d be astronomically rude, even for Sherlock.
John continued to expound upon this subject, while Sherlock remained leaning on the balustrade in deep thought. He had never liked Moriarty, though he was as fascinating as the viper. From his observations Sherlock was the more inclined to believe, that it was this Moriarty, of whom the Italian had uttered his suspicious hints.
Every where, as he passed, he heard, from a distance, the uproar of contention, and the figures and faces, which he met, hurrying along the passages, struck his mind with dismay. At length, he reached the lesser hall, which was silent and deserted. The total stillness of this place was as awful as the tumult, from which he had escaped: but he had now time to recall his scattered thoughts, to remember his personal danger, and to consider of some means of safety. He perceived, that it was useless to seek Mycroft, through the wide extent and intricacies of the castle, now, too, when every avenue seemed to be beset by ruffians; in this hall he could not resolve to stay, for he knew not how soon it might become their place of rendezvous; and, though he wished to go to his chamber, he dreaded again to encounter them on the way.
He of course tried to ascertain from what quarter the sounds proceeded, and thought they came from below; but whether from a room of the castle, or from the terrace, he could not with certainty judge. Fear and surprise now yielded to the enchantment of a strain, that floated on the silent night, with the most soft and melancholy sweetness. Suddenly, it seemed removed to a distance, trembled faintly, and then entirely ceased.
'Ah! it is a desolate place now,' continued La Voisin, 'and such a grand, fine place, as I remember it!' Sherlock enquired what had occasioned this lamentable change; but the old man was silent, and Sherlock, whose interest was awakened by the fear he had expressed, and above all by a recollection of his father's agitation, repeated the question, and added, 'If you are neither afraid of the inhabitants, my good friend, nor are superstitious, how happens it, that you dread to pass near that chateau in the dark?'
The conduct of Monsieur Mycroft in this affair had been entirely governed by selfish vanity. John, in his first interview, had with great candour laid open the true state of his present circumstances, and his future expectancies, and Mycroft, with more prudence than humanity, had absolutely and abruptly rejected his suit. He wished his brother to marry ambitiously, not because he desired to see Sherlock in possession of the happiness, which rank and wealth are usually believed to bestow, but because he desired to partake the importance, which such an alliance would give. When, therefore, he discovered that John was the nephew of a person of so much consequence as Madame Petitbois, he became anxious for the connection, since the prospect it promised the exaltation Mycroft coveted for himself.
At length they reached the village, where they staid only to change horses, without alighting, and it was not till they stopped to dine, that Sherlock had an opportunity of reading the letter. Though he had never doubted the sincerity of John's affection, the fresh assurances he now received of it revived his spirits; he looked over his letter in tenderness, laid it by to be referred to when he should be particularly saddened, and then thought of John with much less anguish than he had done since they parted. Among some other requests, which were expressive of John’s tenderness, John entreated Sherlock would always think of him at sunset. 'You will then meet me in thought,' said he; 'I shall constantly watch the sun-set, and I shall be happy in the belief, that your eyes are fixed upon the same object with mine, and that our minds are conversing. You know not, Sherlock, the comfort I promise myself from these moments; but I trust you will experience it.'
'Count Wilkes,' said Sherlock, ‘though you are a fool, pray listen to reason. You have equally misplaced your love, and your hatred.—I never could have returned your affection, and certainly have never encouraged it; neither has Signor Moriarty injured you, for you must have known, that he had no right to dispose of my hand, had he even possessed the power to do so. Leave, then, leave the castle, while you may with safety. Spare yourself the dreadful consequences of Moriarty’s revenge, and the remorse of having prolonged to me these moments of suffering.'
'O holy Sebastian!' exclaimed Molly, 'am I to stay here by myself all night! I shall be frightened out of my senses, and I shall die of hunger; I have had nothing to eat since dinner!'
The image of his brother murdered—murdered, perhaps, by the hand of Moriarty, rose to his mind; he trembled, gasped for breath, clutched at the wound on his head. But, after he had paused a few minutes, the consciousness of duty returned, and he went on. Still all was silent. At length a track of blood, upon a stair, caught his eye; and instantly he perceived, that the wall and several other steps were stained. He paused, again struggled to support himself, and the lamp almost fell from his trembling hand. Still no sound was heard, no living being seemed to inhabit the turret; a thousand times he wished herself again in his chamber; dreaded to enquire farther—dreaded to encounter some horrible spectacle, and yet could not resolve, now that he was so near the termination of his efforts, to desist from them. Having again collected courage to proceed, after ascending about half way up the turret, he came to another door, but here again he stopped in hesitation; listened for sounds within, and then, summoning all his resolution, unclosed it, and entered a chamber, which, as the lamp shot its feeble rays through the darkness, seemed to exhibit only dew-stained and deserted walls. As he stood examining it, in fearful expectation of discovering Mycroft’s mortal remains, he perceived something lying in an obscure corner of the room, and, struck with an horrible conviction, he became, for an instant, motionless and nearly insensible. Then, with a kind of desperate resolution, he hurried towards the object that excited his terror, when, perceiving the clothes of some person, on the floor, he caught hold of them, and found in his grasp the old uniform of a soldier, beneath which appeared a heap of pikes and other arms! Scarcely daring to trust his sight, he continued, for some moments, to gaze on the object of her late alarm, and then left the chamber, so giddy from this incident, that he was going to descend the turret, without enquiring farther; when, on turning to do so, he observed upon some steps on the second flight an appearance of blood, and remembering, that there was yet another chamber to be explored, he again followed the windings of the ascent. Still, as he ascended, the track of blood glared upon the stairs.
'That look, those words confirm it,' exclaimed Wilkes, furiously. 'No, no, no, Moriarty had a richer prize in view, than gold. But he shall not live to triumph over me!—This very instant—-'
'You have nothing to fear from my indiscretion,' replied Sherlock, 'and let me advise you, be discreet yourself, and never mention what you have just told me to any other person. Signor Moriarty, as you say, may be angry if he hears of it. But what inquiries were made concerning the lady?'
John smiled a goodbye at the girls, feeling as if it must be a rictus grin. He stabbed at some green beans as they depart, Mikes’ jovial “Goodnight, Molly” doing nothing to ease the tension.
John feels a clap on his shoulder. “Sorry for interrupting” Lestrade’s voice says above him “but John here has a big day tomorrow.”
Thus passed the time in vain conjecture, and alternate hopes and fears, till the day arrived when Moriarty was to set out for the villa of Miarenti, which, like the preceding ones, neither brought the Count, or the mention of him.
On the following day Count Wilkes dined again at Moriarty's. He was in an uncommon flow of spirits, and Sherlock thought there was somewhat of exultation in his manner of addressing him, which he had never observed before. He endeavoured to repress this by more than usual reserve, but the cold civility of his air now seemed rather to encourage than to depress the Count. He appeared watchful of an opportunity of speaking with Sherlock alone, and more than once solicited this; but Sherlock always replied, that he could hear nothing from the Count which he would be unwilling to repeat before the whole company.
Sherlock’s lip curled. “I compete in an individual event, John. Seeing as how your ‘cheering’ experiment has failed to make a noticeable improvement in your team’s scores, I fail to see the benefit of belonging to a ‘team,’.”
some insights into the marriage of Moriarty and Mycroft; and a ghostly echo interrupts Moriarty's tale of how he came into the possession of Musgrovio.
'This caprice is intolerable,' said he, 'and shall not be indulged: there is no impropriety in the case' and with a flick of his wrist, pushed Sherlock into the Counts’ boat.
'Our notions are somewhat enlarged since those days,' said M. Anderson;—'what was then thought a decent style of living would not now be endured.' Sherlock was incensed at this insult to his father, but his anger soon yielded to contempt. 'The ground about the chateau is encumbered with trees; I mean to cut some of them down.'
Another object soon caught his attention. He had scarcely looked at a person who walked along the bank, with his hat, in which was the military feather, drawn over his eyes, before, at the sound of wheels, he suddenly turned, and he perceived that it was John himself, who waved his hand, sprung into the road, and through the window of the carriage put a letter into Sherlock’s hand. He endeavoured to smile through the despair that overspread his countenance as the carriage passed on. The remembrance of that smile seemed impressed on Sherlock's mind for ever. He leaned from the window, and saw him on a knoll of the broken bank, leaning against the high trees that waved over him, and pursuing the carriage with his eyes. He waved his hand, and Sherlock continued to gaze till distance confused John’s figure, and at length another turn of the road entirely separated John from his sight.
As his thoughts were so occupied, the barge stopped at a flight of marble steps, which led up the bank to a lawn. Lights appeared between some pillars beyond the portico. Moriarty sent forward his servant, and then disembarked with his family. They found Mons. and Madame Anderson, with a few friends, seated on sofas in the portico, enjoying the cool breeze of the night, and eating fruits and ices, while some of their servants at a little distance, on the river's bank, were performing a simple serenade. Sherlock was now accustomed to the way of living in this warm country, and was not surprised to find Mons. and Madame Anderson in their portico, two hours after midnight.
Sherlock holds his robe around him and strives for haughty, detached, above it all. The competitors are all together one backstage holding area: stretching, getting changed (there’s a lot of dance belt and buttock on display), staring at the one TV showing the other competitors, or like Sherlock, trying hard to look inscrutable and intimidating.
Michael proceeded with reluctance, and the extreme slowness of his pace made Holmes look again from the window to hasten him, when again he saw the same figure. He was somewhat startled: probably the gloominess of the spot made him more liable to alarm than usual; however this might be, he now stopped Michael, and bade him call to the person in the avenue.
Molly having made her report to Moriarty of Sherlock's health and of his request to see him, Moriarty replied, that Sherlock might attend him in the cedar room, in about an hour. It was on the subject, that pressed so heavily on his mind, that Sherlock wished to speak to him, yet he did not distinctly know what good purpose this could answer, and sometimes he even recoiled in horror from the expectation of his presence. He wished, also, to petition, though he scarcely dared to believe the request would be granted, that he would permit him, since his brother was no more, to return to his native country.
Sherlock blinks. John stands in the entrance to the room, boxer briefs low on his hips, small beads of water still gleaming on his skin. He is towelling his hair;
Snorting, John reaches down, grabs a hold of Lestrade’s elbows and hauls him unceremoniously vertical. Lestrade staggers, braces himself on the wall and lets out a ‘
Thus he sat, wiping the blood from his eyes, dript there from the wound on his forehead, when a distant murmur broke on the silence, and grew louder and louder, till he distinguished voices and steps approaching. Sherlock then rose to go, but the sounds came along the only passage, by which he could depart, and he was compelled to await in the hall, the arrival of the persons, whose steps he heard. As these advanced, he distinguished groans, and then saw a man borne slowly along by four others. The bearers, being too busily occupied to detain, or even notice Sherlock, so he made his escape.
With a mighty leap Sherlock sprung free and made for the nearest door, which was the one by which Wilkes had entered.  Wilkes caught his hand, but not before Sherlock had discovered, by the gleam of a lamp, another man half-way down the steps.  He now choked back a sob of despair, and, believing himself given up by Moriarty, saw, indeed, no possibility of escape.
'Aye, those rowing matches,' said Molly, 'and the fine moon-light nights, are all that are worth seeing in Venice. To be sure the moon is brighter than any I ever saw; and then to hear such sweet music, too, as Hopkins has often and often sung under the lattice by the west portico! Monsieur, it was Hopkins, that told me about that picture, which you wanted so to look at last night, and—-'
While he waited for the appointed hour, a message was brought, importing, that Moriarty could not see him, till the next day. Molly said, she fancied the Chevaliers were going out to the wars again, for the court-yard was filled with horses, and she heard, that the rest of the party, who went out before, were expected at the castle. 'And I heard one of the soldiers, too,' added she, 'say to his comrade, that he would warrant they'd bring home a rare deal of booty.—So, thinks I, if the Signor can, with a safe conscience, send his people out a-robbing—why it is no business of mine. I only wish I was once safe out of this castle; and, if it had not been for poor Hopkins's sake, I would have let Count Wilkes's people run away with us both!'  Sherlock was silent, inattentive, absorbed in thought, and passed the whole of this day in a kind of solemn tranquillity, such as is often the result of faculties overstrained by suffering.
“Funny doesn’t suit you. I’d stick to ice,” John says as he pulls viciously on his shoelaces.  “So you’ve got competition this afternoon, then? Good luck with that,” he continues.
The baggage being at length adjusted, the travellers entered their carriages, and Sherlock would have left the chateau without one sigh of regret, had it not been situated in the neighbourhood of John's residence.
Sherlock looks at it a moment and John can practically feel them both holding their breath before Sherlock reaches out and clasps his brother’s hand.
'Am I then to be of the party?' said Sherlock, with extreme surprise and emotion. 'Most certainly,' replied his brother, 'how could you imagine we should leave you behind? But I see you are thinking of the Chevalier Watson; he is not yet, I believe, informed of the journey, but he very soon will be so. Signor Moriarty is gone to acquaint Madame Petitbois of our journey, and to say, that the proposed connection between the families must from this time be thought of no more.'
The Team GB contingent was out in good force, at least. A host of coaches and support staff and athletes from other sports, easily identifiable in their team kit, plus assorted people he assumed were parents and friends of the British team members. Union Jack flags hung down over the tier barrier, occasionally floating up if there was a gust from the air conditioning system. John clutched the corner of one flag himself, absently clenching his fist around the fabric. Next to him, Mike leaned forward, face eager, periodically waving his corner of the flag if something particularly exciting happened down on the floor.
Moriarty, meanwhile, had made strict enquiry concerning the strange circumstance of his alarm, without obtaining information; and was, at length, obliged to account for it by the reasonable supposition, that it was a mischievous trick played off by one of his domestics. His disagreements with Mycroft, on the subject of his settlements, were now more frequent than ever; he even confined Mycroft entirely to his own apartment, and did not scruple to threaten him with much greater severity, should he persevere in a refusal.
“What’s wrong with him?” is Mary’s next line, looking down on Lestrade, who’s still trying to achieve a state of oneness with the carpet.
Exhale. Rock back, breath in, rock up; bounce, bounce, bounce. Exhale. Rock down. Inhale, rock up; bounce, bounce, bounce.
'Suspend your judgment, my man,' replied Moriarty, 'the wiles of this boy’s heart are unsearchable. Now, young man, your EXPLANATION.'
'Now he would compel me to sign away my settlement (it was well I had the chief of my property settled on myself!) that he may lose this also, or throw it away in wild schemes, which nobody can understand but himself? And so he has treated me with neglect, with cruelty, because I refused to relinquish my settlements, and, instead of being frightened by his menaces, resolutely defied him, and upbraided him with his shameful conduct? But I bore all meekly,—you know, brother, I never uttered a word of complaint, till now; no! That such a disposition as mine should be so imposed upon! That I, whose only faults are too much kindness, too much generosity, should be chained for life to such a vile, deceitful, cruel monster!'
Monsieur Mycroft, to whom these remarks were sometimes addressed, because they supported topics for trivial conversation, seemed indefatigable in his attempts to depreciate John, towards whom he felt all the petty resentment of a narrow pride. 'I admire the lady,' said he, 'but I must condemn her choice of a partner.' 'Oh, the Chevalier Watson is one of the most accomplished young men we have,' replied the lady, to whom this remark was addressed: 'it is whispered, that Mademoiselle D'Emery, and her large fortune, are to be his.'
'Well! my good Molly, the people who tell such stories, are happy in having you for an auditor, for I perceive you believe them all.'
John pushes himself up onto his knees, watching them swim in front of his eyes. He is swaying, staggering to Sherlock; but the man in black is pushing up onto the aircon unit, head catching Sherlock in the stomach and they go over the side and out of John’s line of sight.
“What?! Oh, yes, yes John. Exciting isn’t it!” Sieger looks wild-eyed as he pokes his wife in the ribs. “John wants to know if you’re all right, dear. Are you all right?”
With John, whose imagination was now awake to the suggestion of every passion; whose apprehensions for Sherlock had acquired strength by the mere mention of them, and became every instant more powerful; there could be no further consideration. He thought he saw in the clearest light, and love assisted the fear, that this journey to Italy would involve Sherlock in misery; he determined, therefore, to persevere in opposing it, and in conjuring Sherlock to bestow upon him the title of lawful husband and protector: ‘O Sherlock! let my tenderness, my arms withhold you from these evils—give me the right to defend you!'
Sherlock now lost his patience, and his fear of being overheard increasing, he was even nearly about to leave the door, when he considered, that Molly might, possibly, know something of the situation of Mycroft, or direct him to the turret. At length, he obtained a reply, though little satisfactory, to his questions, for Molly knew nothing of his brother, and only conjured Sherlock to tell her what was become of Hopkins. Of Hopkins he had no information to give, and again asked who had shut Molly up.
'O! you are not going, sir,' said Molly, 'for Heaven's sake, do not go, and leave me here by myself.'
This explanation was by no means satisfactory to Sherlock, who had observed, that the bolts were rusted, and consequently could not be thus easily moved; but this deduction was not well received.
This discourse was, however, interrupted by the entrance of Moriarty, and Mycroft’s countenance immediately assumed a mingled expression of fear and resentment as Moriarty seated himself at the breakfast-table, as if unconscious of there being any person but himself in the room.
'This light, sir,' said the soldier, 'has appeared to-night as you see it, on the point of my lance, ever since I have been on watch; but what it means I cannot tell.'
“No basketballer, it was Sally,” Sherlock says, to horrified stares. “Saw her last night.  She’s wearing his deodorant.”
Another suggestion represented, that this might be some person, who had designs upon the castle; but the mournful sounds destroyed, also, that probability. Thus, enquiry only perplexed him. Who, or what, it could be that haunted this lonely hour, complaining in such doleful accents and in such sweet music (for he was still inclined to believe, that the former strains and the late appearance were connected,) he had no means of ascertaining.
'None, Monsieur, unless you have a mind to try your luck yonder,' replied the peasant, pointing to the woods, 'but I would not advise you to go there.'
'When did you see the figure, then, before?' said Sherlock half smiling, who, though he thought the conversation somewhat inane, felt an interest, which would not permit him to conclude it.
Late as it was, however, Holmes was obliged to go out with the landlord to buy meat for supper; and Sherlock, who, during this interval, had been looking to their rooms, which he found rather better than he had initially deduced, found himself returning to converse with John alone. They talked of the character of the scenes they had passed, of the natural history of the country, of developments in science, of poetry, and Sherlock amused John by deducing the inn’s other guests.
“Don’t pretend like you don’t like it” John says lazily, very close to Sherlock’s ear, one hand curling through Sherlock’s hair.
While he leaned on the wall of the rampart, some peasants, at a little distance, were seen examining a breach, before which lay a heap of stones, as if to repair it, and a rusty old cannon, that appeared to have fallen from its station above. Mycroft stopped to speak to the men, and enquired what they were going to do. 'To repair the fortifications, sir,' said one of them; a labour which he was somewhat surprised, that Moriarty should think necessary, particularly since he had never spoken of the castle, as of a place, at which he meant to reside for any considerable time.  Sherlock looked out across the deep valley below, to see winding along the woody descent of a distant mountain, a long troop of horse and foot, whom he deduced to be soldiers, only by the glitter of their pikes and other arms. As he gazed, the vanguard issued from the woods into the valley, but the train still continued to pour over the remote summit of the mountain, in endless succession; while, in the front, the military uniform became distinguishable, and the commanders, riding first, and seeming, by their gestures, to direct the march of those that followed, at length, approached very near to the castle.
'Never, sir!' replied Sherlock; 'that request would have proved to me the injustice of your claim, had I even been ignorant of my right.'
“Cup,” said Sherlock, popping the ‘p.’ “Anyway, get up. Things to do!” he said before striding into the small hall, where John could hear him unzipping the collapsible wardrobe and poking around inside it.
'I have just heard of a circumstance, which entirely destroys all my fairy paradise of ideal delight, and which will reconcile me to the necessity of returning to my regiment, for I must no longer wander beneath the beloved shades, where I have been accustomed to meet you in thought.—Bakersfield is let! I have reason to believe this is without your knowledge, from what Mrs. Hudson told me this morning, and, therefore, I mention the circumstance. She shed tears, while she related, that she was going to leave the service of her dear master, and the chateau where she had lived so many happy years; and all this, added she, without even a letter from you to soften the news; but it is all Mons. Anderson's doings!'
Sherlock opened his mouth, frowning. “Shhh, they’re starting” said John, enjoying the grimace on Sherlock’s face and turning to focus his attention to the floor, where Team GB had assumed their starting position.
Hope you've still got your reading shoes handy, because tomorrow marks the qualification day of the men's and women's rhythmic gymnastics competition.
, in case of an emergency that couldn't be handled there.  That's where Sarah has been taken in this story.
They stopped suddenly outside one of the hallway’s many olive green doors, as next to him Mike narrowly avoiding head-butting Lestrade’s back. “Righto,” said the coach gruffly, “you go in, we’ll wait outside.”
Monsieur Mycroft received with a very ill grace, the compliments of the Signors. He disliked them, because they were the friends of his husband; hated them, because he believed they had contributed to detain him abroad till so late an hour of the preceding morning; and envied them, since, conscious of his own want of influence, he was convinced, that Moriarty preferred their society to his own. The rank of Count Wilkes procured him that attention which Mycroft refused to the rest of the company. The haughty sullenness of Mycroft’s countenance and manner, and the ostentatious extravagance of his dress, were strikingly contrasted by the beauty, elegance and simplicity of Sherlock, who observed, with more interest than pleasure, the party around him.
“Nah,” replies Mike, “From Beijing I mostly remember John’s boxer. I was sleeping on the couch for the last three days of the games, bastard. Cuban, I think.”
'Why, little better, sir; the old housekeeper, and her husband the steward, have the care of it, but they live generally in a cottage hard by.'
They returned pensively to the chateau, Sherlock musing on the incident which had just occurred. As they drew near the house, they observed an unusual bustle about it; the sound of voices was distinctly heard, servants and horses were seen passing between the trees, and, at length, the wheels of a carriage rolled along. Holmes perceived the liveries of his brother-in-law, and in the parlour he found Monsieur and Madame Anderson already entered. This gentleman was the only brother of Madame Holmes; but the ties of relationship having never been strengthened by similarity of mind or character, the intercourse between them had not been frequent.
But John was moving again, pushing up off his hands and out of the water, rivulets of water streaming from his chest.
“He’ll be wanting a different outcome this time, and with that score he’s certainly on track for the final in this apparatus and for the individual all-around competition, too. He’ll have everyone at home watching eagerly over the next two weeks of competition.”
Sherlock’s eyes jerked back up to rest on John’s smiling face, grinning at Sherlock as he ran a hand through his wet hair, eyes impossibly blue and improbably bright, sparkling in the shimmering reflection from the surface of the water.
John nodded, feeling slightly ashamed about the bright yellow bottle he’d picked up at Asda for £3 before he’d flown out.  Still, needs must. “Here, can you do my back?” he said, holding it out to Sherlock and turning around.
“Oh look, the gang’s all back together,” said Sherlock from behind him, low and dark. John makes a vaguely affirmative sound as he marches off to the table, sliding his tray next to Molly’s, which is by happy coincidence about as far from Bill as he can get.
Sherlock turned hastily from the scene, and attempted to draw away Monsieur Mycroft, who was conversing with Signor Douglas and the Count Bauvillers, and neither perceived John, or was willing to be interrupted. When Count Bauvillers, made some observations upon the scene to Sherlock, to which he answered almost unconsciously, for his mind was still occupied with the idea of John. Some remarks, however, which the Count made upon the dance obliged Sherlock to turn his eyes towards it, and, at that moment, John's met his. Sherlock felt a moment’s faintness, and instantly averted his looks, but not before he had observed the altered countenance of John, on perceiving him.
'It is indeed,' said Sherlock, who was confirmed in his first conjecture, for he now distinguished John’s countenance, lighted up with still more than its usual animation. A thousand anxious feelings crowded to his mind, and the effort, which he made to appear himself, only served to increase his agitation. John, meanwhile, having enquired anxiously after Sherlock’s health, and expressed his hopes, that M. Holmes had found benefit from travelling, learned from the expression of grief on Sherlock’s countenance, which he could not repress, the fatal truth. John led him to a seat, and sat down by him, while Sherlock blinked rapidly to conceal his struggles, and John to hold the hand, which he was unconscious he had taken.
'Why, no, ma'am,' replied Molly; 'I never heard any music here, I must say, but the drums and the trumpet; and, as for last night, I did nothing but dream I saw my late master's ghost.'
'I thank you for your pity, Molly,' said Sherlock, interrupting her; 'You may take away, Molly, I have done.'
On reaching the great gallery, he heard voices seemingly in dispute, and, pausing, soon distinguished some words of Douglas and Moran, and hid himself behind the doorframe. They were alone. Moran, still flushed with rage, was protesting, that he would instantly inform Moriarty of the insult, which Wilkes had thrown out against him, and above all, that, wherein he had accused him of murder.
Sherlock's troubles continue with an unsatisfactory conversation with M. Anderson and threats from M. Moriarty.
John swallows. “No, Sherlock always replies – to everything. He’s Mr. Punchline. He will outlive God trying to have the last word.”
Sherlock remained at the casement, watching as the vivid lightning, that now, every instant, revealed the wide horizon and the landscape below.  The tremendous sounds of the thunder seemed to shake the castle to its foundation; and the wind and rain lashed his skin as he stood gazing.
all the way to the end - I hope I managed to convey the excitement of the event.  Here's Briton Max Whitlock competing and look at the expression on his face! He finished in the bronze medal position, like another Briton we all know and love.
Moriarty, on the following morning, appeared as usual, except that he wore his wounded arm in a sling; he went out upon the ramparts; overlooked the men employed in repairing them; gave orders for additional workmen, and then came into the castle to give audience to several persons, who were just arrived, and who were shewn into a private apartment, where he communicated with them, for near an hour.
The physician was affected; he promised to obey her, and told Holmes, somewhat abruptly, that there was nothing to expect. The latter was not philosopher enough to restrain his feelings when he received this information. Sherlock was at first overwhelmed with the intelligence; then, deluded by the strength of his wishes, a hope sprung up in his mind that his mother would yet recover, and to this he adhered almost to the last hour.
Like a ballet dancer’s, John mused. “Is that what you wear in competition, too?  Like a ballet outfit?”
'I commend your prudence,' said Sherlock, while feeling the opposite; and then closing the casement to put an end to the discourse.
At parting he pressed him and his half-brother to make an early visit. 'Change of place will amuse you,' said he, 'and it is wrong to give way to grief.' Holmes acknowledged the truth of these words of course; but, at the same time, felt more reluctant than ever to quit the spot which his past happiness had consecrated.
been looking forward to seeing that Frenchman, Victor Trevor, in action, quite raving about him really, pity none of the British fencers are up to scratch this time. Oh do wait, dear, no need to go stomping off in a huff, not a personal jibe at you…”
Sherlock runs his hand through his hair in frustration, causing it to stand up practically on end, stiff with salt. John is captivated; instantly delighted out of his irritation with Sherlock’s dismissing his (eminently credible) sports-equipment-as-assault-weapon theory, baseball bat or no. Sherlock marched off, muttering vehemently to himself about discuses.
He imagined Sherlock’s tall body vaulting across the floor, lean muscles flexing as he looked up to pluck something out of the air. Would his hair get in his eyes?  Or would he slick it back for competition?  John wondered how Sherlock would look without his curls – aquiline features drawn into greater prominence, cheekbones thrown into relief….
“Are you ever going to contribute to these conversations?” asked John, watching Anthea make her way into the distance.
“Yes, great job!” chirps in Mary, just behind him. “Hopefully we can go three from three, eh?” she said, smiling at the little group of Team GB jerseys.
“Here,” he continued, digging into his jacket pocket again and depositing the proceeds into Sieger’s hand, “take a few more. Go on, you can swap them.”
Having reached a landing-place, 'You may wait here, sir,' said he, applying a key to the door of a chamber, 'while I go up, and tell the Monsieur you are coming.'
“C’mon,” says John, toeing his coach’s leg. “If you’re quick, the Holmes’s will still be outside,” says John, who, though a sportsman, is not above the occasional dirty trick.  Lestrade cracks an eye open, eyeballs John for a moment before making vague efforts at movement.
Mycroft grabbed at the cloak of his husband, bewailing his cruelty. Moriarty, however, soon interrupted these entreaties with a horrible oath; and, as he burst from his husband, leaving his cloak, in his hand, he struck Sherlock, who fell to the floor, with a force, that occasioned him a severe blow on the forehead. Sherlock’s attention was called from himself, by a deep groan from Monsieur Mycroft, who continued otherwise unmoved in his chair, and Sherlock saw his eyes rolling, and his features convulsed.
'Assertion,' replied Wilkes, 'at such a moment, is not to be depended upon. How could I suffer myself to doubt, even for an instant, that he could see you, and not love?—But my first care shall be to convey you from the castle. Cesario! ho,—Cesario!'
On the following morning, as Sherlock sat at breakfast with his brother, a letter was brought to him, of which he knew the handwriting upon the cover; and, as he received it with a trembling hand, Monsieur Mycroft hastily snatched it from his grasp. As his brother looked it over, Sherlock endeavoured to read on his countenance its contents.
Douglas turned away his face for a moment, and then said with a studied air, 'Whom then are we to compliment, madam? for it would be absurd to compliment a man of refined understanding; HE is above all praise.' As he finished the sentence he gave Sherlock a sly look, and the smile, that had lurked in his eye, stole forth. Sherlock perfectly understood it, and felt the sting for Monsieur Mycroft, who replied, 'You are perfectly right, signor, no man of understanding can endure compliment.'
“Because you’re not a wealthy man, and I doubt that you can dance, so that rules out Strictly Come Dancing for you, unlike your friend Miss Morstan.”
Sherlock bent his head and attended to his business, fingers flying over the phone’s screen in a prepared sequence. Looking up, John was close, leaning against the room’s high countertop, arms and ankles crossed, looking directly at Sherlock. Shockingly close.
With a sudden twist of the flag, he flips it behind himself and holds one corner out behind Sherlock’s head, “Go on, take it, you idiot.” Sherlock does so, mutely, and they walk along a little farther, flag billowing out behind their heads.
He was awakened from musing by the sound of horses' feet along a road, that wound under the windows of the pavilion, and a gentleman passed on horseback, whose resemblance to John, in air and figure, for the twilight did not permit a view of his features, immediately struck him. He retired hastily from the lattice, fearing to be seen, yet wishing to observe further, while the stranger passed on without looking up, and, when he returned to the lattice, he saw him faintly through the twilight, winding under the high trees, that led to Tholouse. This little incident so much disturbed Sherlock’s spirits, that unable to concentrate on his violin, he returned to the chateau.
'Yes, monsieur, any of them would be hard enough for that matter; but they do say, that something has been seen in the dead of night, standing beside the great cannon, as if to guard it.'
'Yes, let him come,' cried Wilkes furiously, 'and brave MY resentment! Let him dare to face once more the man he has injured; danger shall teach him morality, and vengeance justice—let him come, and receive my sword in his heart!'  His darkened countenance expressed all the rage of jealousy and revenge; and a person, who had seen his features under the smile of overwhelming tenderness, which he so lately assumed, would now scarcely have believed them to be the same.
In the surrounding ground, Holmes had made very tasteful improvements; yet, such was his attachment to objects he had remembered from his boyish days, that he had in some instances sacrificed taste to sentiment. There were two old larches that shaded the building, and interrupted the prospect; Holmes had sometimes declared that he believed he should have been weak enough to have wept at their fall. In addition to these larches he planted a little grove of beech, pine, and mountain-ash. On a lofty terrace, formed by the swelling bank of the river, rose a plantation of orange, lemon, and palm-trees, whose fruit, in the coolness of evening, breathed delicious fragrance. With these were mingled a few trees of other species. Here, under the ample shade of a plane-tree, that spread its majestic canopy towards the river, Holmes loved to sit in the fine evenings of summer, with his wife and children, watching, beneath its foliage, the setting sun, the mild splendour of its light fading from the distant landscape, till the shadows of twilight melted its various features into one tint of sober grey. Here, too, he loved to read, and to converse with Madame Holmes; or to play with his children, resigning himself to the influence of those sweet affections, which are ever attendant on simplicity and nature. He has often said, while tears of pleasure trembled in his eyes, that these were moments infinitely more delightful than any passed amid the brilliant and tumultuous scenes that are courted by the world. His heart was occupied; it had, what can be so rarely said, no wish for a happiness beyond what it experienced. The consciousness of acting right diffused a serenity over his manners, which nothing else could impart to a man of moral perceptions like his, and which refined his sense of every surrounding blessing.
