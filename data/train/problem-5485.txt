“It will,” Tony says kindly, a sad smile on his face belaying his words. He stands there, almost awkwardly like he has no place watching there for the first time that Steve has ever seen him. “Maybe not now, but it will. Somewhere in you probably doesn’t regret hitting submit on the submissions page.”
Steve was kind and polite and so honest in a world where nothing was black and white that it was refreshing. He definitely had a few things he wasn't telling and like everyone, he did lie, but Tony didn't mean that kind of honest. Steve was a breath of fresh air and a light in all of their darkened lives, though he was stumbling through life himself. He was trying, trying, trying, and never giving up, but he was helping as he helped himself. He did not deserve the horrible time displacement deal he had gotten, even if everyone here now were all the better for it.
On that list, there are Rhodey, Mama Rhodes (and literally any member of the Rhodes clan), Pepper, and his therapist. That list used to hold Edwin Jarvis, Ana Jarvis, Yinsen, and O-
to have. I’ve also heard people disagree with Jennifer Walters as the detective who takes my character down. It’s funny, because the first time that she interrogated me in the movie, my character pretends to be cowed and in a state of fear, but I was just a little intimidated. Jen did study law, so.” He shrugs.
“I’m sorry,” he says quietly, so that no one can hear his words. They may plaster his slumped form on every tabloid, but they will never get his words if he can’t help it. “I haven’t come here in a while; I haven’t talked to you in a while. It hurts, ma, I wish you were here with me right now. I’m sorry. I don’t know know how you did it when Dad died, and you loved him just as much as I do you. It hurts, ever since you died and it’s never gone away. How did you do it? How did you deal with losing everyone, because I can’t even handle missing you for a day. It’s been four years and it hurts.”
That was an answer in itself for how telling it was. "Nineteen forty-something? Thirty-something? It can't be twenty-something, you would have been eleven at best." He pauses.
to be gay?” There it is again; Rogers spitting out Cap like its always left a bad taste in his mouth.
Nineteen days ago, his timer had told him he had three years to go. Eight days ago, it had told him that he had three months left. Five minutes ago, it had told him he had three weeks left. And now? Three days, one hour, twenty-nine minutes and forty-seven seconds. He wonders what it will say in the next few days, and he wonders what it'll jump to this time. Tony's timer has never decreased three times in a row like this, and he wonders what's going to happen next. Will it jump to three decades? Three years again? What now?
“Is Steve Rogers,” Tony reads off, and sure enough there are six questions on the board that all start with the same thing. Tony pulls the first little sticker off and continues with, “Dead.” He bursts into laughter, almost dropping the card.
“That fluff ball has already been adopted,” Tony laughs, leading them to a prime photography spot. Although he doesn’t say anything, Steve knows that Tony’s been waiting for him so that they could make the pictures together, especially since they couldn’t do the same thing last year.
Tony gasps dramatically. "Has Steve been holding out on science days with Bruce and I? And just because Bruce is my science boyfriend doesn't mean we're fucking. At least I think we aren't. I would know, right? Yeah, I would."
No one registers who he is here, and if they do, they don’t care. At all. It’s pretty refreshing, actually, and today’s been the kind of day he’d love to drink here, but unfortunately, he’s on a  mission, no matter how self-imposed. The bartender takes one good look at him and probably jumps to the conclusion that like a few of the non-regulars here, he’s a higher middle class, middle-aged man with a midlife crisis that brought him here. He already starts prepping a drink for Tony, something stereotypical, but Tony keeps walking ahead, trying to find Rogers while ignoring all the stares he’s getting. It’s obvious that none of the other middle-aged patrons—ah he suddenly realizes he’s wearing a goddamn suit—venture this far in, where inhibitions are lowered and there’s no such thing as dancing, just sex upright.
“It wasn’t weird,” Steve says, even though the first one had been weird because he had wished it was real and not for a movie in front of people, “It’s your best friend and it’s just for a movie. We’ve done weirder things for each other or a role.”
“Um,” Steve says, subtly scooting away from Tony who is clutching his stomach with how hard he is laughing. “No, no I am not. No matter what I look like in the morning, I am not. Tony, stop that!” He pulls the card away from him and swats him with it, trying to get Tony to stop.
Tony smirks from beside him, all too eager to hear what people think of him. “Thirst tweets are not a mission to conquer,” he says, making grabby hands at the bucket. “Although if you really do want to conquer...”
Where the hell did these thoughts about Steve come from? Why the fuck does he want to fuck Steve until he couldn't walk right, super soldier or no? What even happened to disliking Steve and taking their glacier-like friendship and actually turning into a friendship? Why does Tony even care? Oh fuck, he cannot be lusting over Steve.
Steping onto the relatively clean floors of the entrance—that he knows get dirtier the farther in the bar someone goes—Tony is instantly caught by the smell of cheap, watered-down beer and sex. He glances at the musty wooden walls that enclose the bar, save for the chipped stone and metal one behind the bartenders, and then the unflattering golden lights that everyone knows used to be white. There’s something on the edges of the only two free stools that he isn’t sure is blood or not. Sometimes, he wonders how this place still manages to escape health safety, and then the owner of this place always pops into his mind. Talk about a manipulative, charming bastard.
Not even when the three of them wake up the next day in the same bed, fully clothed (thank god this wasn’t like Nice, or Milan in 2003 and 2005, or Jakarta, or Toronto, or even Detroit, where they didn’t even have sex that time but were still mostly naked) but also heavily cuddling, with Tony in the middle. No one cares; this doesn’t even rank on the scale of weirdness between the three of them.
Just as he finishes his drink and plans to talk to Steve, he notices Steve chatting up some brunette (who he really can't see) near the billiards table. Both of them are talking and laughing at the players, and Clint's drunken determination. Tony really doesn't know how Clint's gotten better with a few drinks, but then again, it's also Clint. No one knows. Well, maybe Natasha. Natasha knows everything.
“I don’t know who they are,” Steve says calmly, like he’s tried to accept it and move on. And for Steve, who thought he was a blank for all of his old life, maybe it was an easy thing to forget about it. “And there’s just five people alive who know that I have a timer. There’s only four people who know what the numbers are.”
Tony suddenly has a flashback to Pepper telling him that he has a soulmate. He groans; she’ll never let this go. Next to him, it seems that Steve is thinking of someone (Sam or Natasha) who’ll rag on him. Tony thinks that he has the shorter end of the stick though. Because Pepper will never let this go. He can already hear her in his mind.
Steve gives him an apologetic look that’s angelic enough that Tony throws up his hands. “You absolute troll.”
And with that, Steve closes out of the livestream, knowing that it’ll still stay up for the next 24 hours. He closes the laptop, and his phone. When he’s certain everything has been turned off, he sinks back into the sofa and laughs. And laughs, tapering off into a soft chuckle that he tries to hide by covering his face with his hands, as if that would muffle the sound.
Tony spends the next few hours doing just that, going around but popping in on Steve whenever both of them have a spare minute. He's never realized how much fun this is, and how much time he spends on Steve's Q&A. The mini stories that come with some of the answers are endearing, or laughable, and he tries to ask questions so he'll get an answer and a story. Unfortunately, he exhausts his questions (though he finds that he wasn't really trying somewhere around Question #14) and Steve merely shakes his head with the mischievous, knowing smirk.
But since he isn't Thor and he doesn't have another real choice, he finds himself mingling around and talking to various governors and senators and representatives and lawmakers who he hasn't even heard of before, most of them. Well, then and many influential people, most of whom were at the charity gala. Tony's starting to realize why Fury really sent them all here as the titles all fly through his head. Looking around at Natasha, Steve, and Bruce, he sees that they're all realizing the same thing.
Yeah, Tony went there. He’s tried everything he can think of to get Steve to stay, and nothing is just working. Tony can’t understand why on earth Steve would want to stay in his lonely, small, cramped, probably bugged, SHIELD-assigned apartment instead of Tony’s populous, large, sprawling, not bugged, SHIELD-free Tower. It doesn’t make any sense, and Tony knows that logically, there has to be something he isn’t hitting yet that he soon will.
The joke is also slightly on SHIELD. He has his own trackers on Rogers's devices, because he's not ever going to be responsible for losing America's favorite golden man. All he has to do is open up a locating app and he knows where Steve is. So he does just that while Fury is yelling, passing it off as playing a game on his phone. The locator takes just under a minute to find him, and Tony almost drops his phone in surprise. According to his phone, Rogers is at a bar that Tony is familiar with. A gay bar, to be much more exact, and not even the most reputable of places. Tony knows it because it's the last place anyone would expect him, a playboy billionaire, to be when he wants a causal drink.
Which is why less than a minute later, both of them end up storming down the bar stairs that clearly are marked for employees only, with Rogers fuming and Tony curious. This place is surprisingly clean, albeit a little dark.
“Can I kiss you?” Tony asks abruptly. He's already come this far with impulse decisions, and fuck, this must be what it feels like to be Steve. There's such an adrenaline rush that comes with impulses.
"Can we play 20 questions on who it is, then?" Tony asks, because Steve is indulging him this when he's
He never sees the note fallen onto the floor, written in flowing blue cursive explaining to him that Steve has to go, but that he will drop by as soon as he can to talk if Tony doesn't want a phone call.
Steve eyes the camera and deadpans, “If you think I can wear a sports bra underneath the tight shirts they give me, you’re wrong. Besides. Free the nipple.” He winks. Tony sits up a little straighter in his chair, his laughter fading into a smirk.
But Tony looks like Christmas came early with the chance to tease Steve. “He’s been on the show before, and I haven’t, as you know. He liked it well enough last time that he actually now religiously watches it, and all but begged me to come here.”
The next time Tony steps foot in Steve’s hospital room, Steve’s awake, propped up in his hospital bed, and staring at the ceiling like it has something written on it. He looks mostly healed, though his face still has a little bit of purpling and bruising that’s concerning, and his arms and everything else that’s visible out of the covers look a little beat up. Mostly healed. There are still some of Bruce’s elephant-rhinoceros-horse painkillers hooked up to Steve, but just enough that Tony wonders if they’re actually taking the edge off for Steve, or not even that.
This is a conversation Tony does not want to be having. This is a conversation Tony’s had with himself, with Pepper, and with his therapist several times over. He thought it wouldn’t hurt with the amount of times he’s said it and thought about it, but with Steve, it’s just... it still hurts. It does.
“Natasha and Sam are the others,” Steve continues, "but they doesn’t know where it zeroed. Happened just a short while after I woke up. During Loki.”
He realizes he hasn't exactly left Natasha at the bar yet, so she follows his gaze to Steve and rolls her eyes. "And to think everyone says he's awful at flirting." She sounds a little pissed off, and he immediately can tell that Steve's thwarted all of her matchmaking plans for him just by virtue of being his unique self. He grins and wonders if she knows she's probably been looking at the wrong gender.
“Close enough,” Tony says, shrugging. “I’m been accused of heresy more times than I can remember, so. Good for you.” He tosses the card, and someone hands Steve the next card, which he takes with pleasure.
Loki was a son of a bitch, and it was a good thing he was adopted, since Thor’s mom sounded like she was the exact opposite of a petty bitch. The fight against him was easy (at least to Tony, even if Cap had been struggling) and subduing him was even easier. Of course, Thor had to come and put a dent in things, but it was still straightened out. Everything was okay.
"Both of them are married to their jobs. And Hill's the type to hook up and dump anyway." This, Tony did not need to know.
Almost perfectly on the nose, but Steve’s not getting why that made Tony so scared, and he doesn’t want him to.
He was so fucked. This was a movie, a job, a role, a professional setting and here he was breaking every single acting rule of his life. Fuck, fuck, fuck, this was beyond method acting for him to claim. Fuck. Why did he take the role again? Fuck.
He never sees the note fallen onto the floor, written in flowing blue cursive explaining to him that Steve has to go, but that he will drop by as soon as he can to talk if Tony doesn't want a phone call.
It was a miracle he remembered his line, but to buy himself some time, Steve swallowed hard and mustered up a cocky smirk he knew didn’t belong to him. “As if you don’t know,” he responded, and sue him if his voice didn’t waver with how badly he wanted to forget all his lines and kiss Tony right there, and feel Tony everywhere.
Tony shrugs. There are worse press incidents and issues than the conservatives coming after Rogers. "Why not? And back then, anyway, you had Carter, right? So you're what, bisexual? Pansexual? Polysexual? Preferring not to put labels? You like women, so I mean, you'll only get yelled at half the—”
“And it’s not,” Steve says, plain and simple. He knows where she’s going to rightfully take the line of questioning, and he wants to prolong it as much as possible. “We’ve always said that it’s a genre-less story of a man. The movie toes all kind of lines, and honestly, the one distinction it has is that it’s rated R.” Tony quietly laughs from next to him.
“I don’t know why he does it when he knows Natasha’s going to yell at him. And Laura, I suppose,” Steve sighs, shaking his head. “The constant fear alone make up for how uncomfortable they can be sometimes. Then again, I don’t think he has much to fear this time around.”
“It’s just—the question makes it seem like something inherently scandalous and taboo. Is Steve Rogers... a Christian?” Steve does his best imitation of someone clutching their pearls in horror at the end of the question. “Someone’s making it out to seem like I’m a cannibal or something. And by the way, is Steve Rogers a cannibal? No. Dear god, no.”
come true, that a guy like me from Brooklyn could stand on this stage coming from nowhere and nothing. I should be on top of the world right now, but all I can think about is the fact she’s not here.”
“Should I feel honoured?” he asks, putting two and two together. He slides the drink over expertly, deft hands having put it together seconds before.
Steve laughs at him, and shoes him out and out onto the stage. Tony smiles and goes, happy smile radiating from his entire body. Despite what Peggy on his other side says, he does not have stars in his eyes at the sunshine coming from Tony right now, even if it is nighttime right now. She’s teasing him. Again.
"Yes," Natasha says, somehow in a mood to acknowledge all of his stupid antics. He's not going to ask about that either. "Yes, that is."
His hand drops down from his face again when he says, “I didn’t mean for that to happen, I’ll take the floor next time if there is a next time and...”
"You should dance with me," Steve suggests, a smirk on his face and a very flirtatious look in his eyes that's all but challenging Tony. "As a thank-you, you know. Heard it's the polite thing to do."
“Told you one bed and one room was a good idea,” Laura says as she rolls her eyes affectionately towards Clint. Their soulmate status makes much more sense now.
“It looked like it had been planned,” Kat says in amazement. “Normally in movies I know they have choreographers to block movements out, especially ones as high-energy and charged as yours. It takes planning and extreme coordination to make everything look good, so that you did it without any such preparation is astonishing. My next question, I guess, was how much of that was faked? If you had had to make it real, how of it
“You're not going to—” Tony starts to say, before Rogers stops him with an impatient hand and shakes his head bitterly, already knowing what he's about to say.
Characters: Steve Rogers, Tony Stark, Natasha Romanoff, minor Maria Hill, minor Peggy Carter, mentions of Bucky Barnes and Sam Wilson, cameo characters
In fact, with the way Steve looks incredibly confident in that stupid suit, he knows he's probably in the large majority that wants to fuck Steve. The fucker doesn't even have qualms about dancing anymore, even though he did before. As he dances, everyone can't help but notice how his moves are incredibly fluid and precise, just like how he fights. And no, Tony isn't projecting for once; if he looks around, all eyes are quite literally on Steve. Every single time Steve's talks to someone, there's almost always a new check donated. It's incredible, really.
He wants to believe it, but he knows that he will always see his Oscar somewhere and think of his ma. Steve smiles weakly, and gently lets go of her, realizing that he’s clinging onto her just as she is letting him, but still.
The press and absolutely no one has a word against Captain America. Well, besides neo-Nazis, but they're also neo-Nazis. Tony's not about to go and get himself called that by calling Rogers a dick. Hell no. Even, strangely enough, villains have no actual bad things to say about Rogers. They just want to defeat him and brag. Tony's not going to be the one tells them that Steve's like a spring; he'll never not pop back up. Even if it's annoying, and even if it's seven decades later.
That stupid, stupid joke he always made around Rogers. And now it was coming to bite him back. Of course. Tony doesn't know how much of this he can take before he snaps himself and they walk away with more bruises than necessary, and perhaps a broken bone or ten on Tony's part. “Homosexuality isn't a perversion or a crime, Rogers, I think it's time to get up to speed.”
Steve sits down on one of the stools at the kitchen counter the wrong way, so that his back is to the counter and he sips.
"Not half-bad, huh?" Steve counters with a smirk that says he doesn't believe Tony. Leaning in a little closer, he whispers, "You're going to have to try a lot harder if you want answers with compliments like that."
Steve looks at the camera conspiratorially. “Rule number three of publicity: nothing in the internet ever goes away. Guess I’ll just have to see possibly adorable gifs of Tony floating around on Tumblr and Twitter that you guys should definitely not be making right this very moment and after.”
to live here, in this century, Tony can say that Steve’s doing better. His smiles are more real, he’s less likely to hunch into himself, he’s less likely to tense and retreat.
Steve is stunned that he’s won. He knows there have to be cameras in him that are showing the country how dumb he looks, but he can’t bring himself to actually process it. He just won a Golden Globe. A Golden Globe for the best Drama Actor in a Leasing Role. Steve’s mind is shutting down, and he can’t even register that he’s walking into the stage until someone hands him the physical award. He blinks and smiles.
Steve laughs and shakes his head at Tony, despite knowing that the cameras must be panning to him even as everyone in the crowd laughs.
Steven Grant Rogers, unlike everyone else on the list, has earned his spot not because Tony likes/respects/cares about him, per se, but because he's fucking Captain America and a guy who is very, very hard to impress—and Tony wants to impress him just once. He's not proud of the reasoning behind it. He doesn't mention this to his therapist, either, because she'd go into a round of daddy issues and self-worth issues. And probably everything else that's wrong with him. But whatever. Tony doesn't
Sooner or later, Clint and Natasha drift up to him and he's too used to it to even jump up in surprise.
“Like I said, congratulations. Stupid me of being careless, but I really had thought that you had better things to do than track my life. Was this what you wanted, Stark? My dark scandal?”
"Both of them are married to their jobs. And Hill's the type to hook up and dump anyway." This, Tony did not need to know.
spend the time wondering about his sexuality. Or the fact that Steve had showed up to the mandatory team meeting late and a little disheveled, promptly ending any and all debates about his virginity, but sparking new ones about
Tomy gracefully takes his award from Selina Kyle and Margaret Smith and grins at the crowd. “Thank you,” he warmly says. “You know what? I’d like to start off thanking Steve Rogers, who just laughed in my face when I said I didn’t have anything planned to say. He was also the one who told me that the chances of either him or I winning were slim.”
But at the end of the gala, when all has been said and done, Steve leaves alone, and Tony hasn't really seen him in the company of an unattached man for too long. More so than anyone else, he’s the center of this gala, this world of the famous and influential.
Tony spends the next weeks hiding from Steve every time Steve wears tight clothing, but he definitely does
The joke is also slightly on SHIELD. He has his own trackers on Rogers's devices, because he's not ever going to be responsible for losing America's favorite golden man. All he has to do is open up a locating app and he knows where Steve is. So he does just that while Fury is yelling, passing it off as playing a game on his phone. The locator takes just under a minute to find him, and Tony almost drops his phone in surprise. According to his phone, Rogers is at a bar that Tony is familiar with. A gay bar, to be much more exact, and not even the most reputable of places. Tony knows it because it's the last place anyone would expect him, a playboy billionaire, to be when he wants a causal drink.
"Things like visiting hospitals, talking to kids at schools, raising awareness for things like the VA and other causes. I mean, those are the good parts of the job, but they are part of the job. Just as much as talking to the WSO and worldwide governments on how the Avengers are not a threat. Or on how someone's needs to take responsibility for allowing the Mandarin's influence to spread and the nuke on Manhattan." When Tony stares at Steve like Steve has grown a second head, because wow, what the
"Maria," Natasha responds without missing a beat. When Tony doesn't say anything in frozen shock, she says, "
“Uh huh,” Rogers says with such amused disbelief that it's hard to even picture what the expression on his face is. “And my
Tony bursts into laughter, yanking the paper from Steve’s hands and reading it for himself, laughing again. “I love this! I don’t know who you are, but I love you for making Rogers read this with his own voice.”
But thanks to Steve, his work wife Pepper, his science husband Bruce,  his best friend Rhodey, and even Happy (because Steve pulled out all the stops, even after Tony tweaked JARVIS to stop Steve just for tonight) Tony was forced to go to sleep last night. And worst of all, tonight, Tony's kind of thankful he did. Even if Tony spent the first half an hour lying in bed wondering what kind of a relationship name Happy should have. Security bro? Hmm, he is going to have to ask Happy about that.
“Of course you only remember the speedo,” Steve huffs, rolling his eyes and swatting Tony’s hand from the bucket when Tony tries to reach the third tweet. “You’re shameless. But the only reason my chest was waxed—and I’m surprised that people paid close enough attention to differentiate between fine blond hair and no hair at all—was because of the shirtless scene for the Cap movie.”
Steve turns away sadly from the adorable little dog, whose name is Pippa, but not before giving her one last head pat and pet. “You think I can adopt another dog?” Steve asks Tony as they walk away from the fans and onto the actual carpet for press interviews.
Tony looks around as discretely as he can and finds that no one meets the criteria that he already knows of. "Are you sure that you're not lying to me? Because there's no one here that I can see."
"That's Hill? Hardass Hill? Like, Deputy Director Maria Hill?" He probably looks like a fish with all of his gaping, but it's fine. What's not fine is that Maria Hill is laughing and grinning with Steve Rogers of all people.
Steve laughs, a soft huff of air that brings a slightly relieved look on Natasha’s face, even if she will try to deny it. “You and Peggy submitted for me,” he reminds Tony. “I didn’t do anything.”
Does he want to risk her being wrong for the first time? Just how much does he trust Natasha Romanoff and his own instincts? Will he regret it for the rest of his life? Is it worth it?
"That's Hill? Hardass Hill? Like, Deputy Director Maria Hill?" He probably looks like a fish with all of his gaping, but it's fine. What's not fine is that Maria Hill is laughing and grinning with Steve Rogers of all people.
Tony wants to ask why Natasha’s sharing, and what that even means, before he remembers the Red Room and all the horrors of brainwashing. So he attempts for levity. “It’s a fucked up world when
"Yeah, and male?" Tony bluffs again, because Natasha had said that no one else knew and not to give it away. So he can't say anything.
At least, this is what Tony tells himself when he's sitting in a mission briefing room with everyone else while Fury is yelling at the man about where Rogers is. Apparently he's not responding to his phone, and someone (Tony) has removed all of SHEILD's trackers so they can't even place him. For the first time, Rogers isn't here with a call to fight. Tony would be smirking and cracking jokes if it weren't for the fact that Fury had just ordered them to go find Rogers and bring him here to HQ. Though, picturing the dressing down Rogers was going to get after it was worth the yelling.
“We could have done this a lot longer ago if I knew,” Tony says, though his eyes are wide like something has just occurred to him. Good Steve thinks, he better be thinking about that.
Steve didn’t even realize he was shaking while his voice broke, as if stricken by the words that his character hadn’t meant to say. Vaguely, he was thinking of what Liam would do, but it also was frightening to realize that Liam was doing what Steve would do if he was ever in this situation. He didn’t have to act any of it out, not when he knew deep down that if it were really him and Tony having this conversation, he would try every trick in the book to get Tony back. Just not with really cheesy words.
had gotten laid, and that was that. Hill showed up fifteen minutes later than Steve, but she looked perfectly put together while holding a cup of SHIELD café coffee, which he knew took a minimum of twenty minutes to receive. Huh. She was good.
Steve manages another painfully honest smile at the crowd and picks up his award as the music starts to play him off; the timing could not have been any better. He slips into the corridor that takes him backstage and cries, letting out a shuddering wrack that shakes his entire body for a second. It’s a nightmare. Out there had been a nightmare disguised as a victory. There had been no salvation, no amount of psyching himself up for the Oscars that could have prevented the meltdown, and he doesn’t know whether to be comforted or tired at the information or revelation.
Steve jerked his head up and looked back at Tony, at the false emotions warring across the other actor’s face. Then, like a switch had been flipped, Tony took another step forwards, then two, and three, and four. Steve let the moment of realization settle over his face—Liam was realizing he had a chance yet still—and fell into a natural rhythm of moving backwards one step, then two, and three, and four.
Steve scrolls. “Oh my god,” he says in the midst of reading through the comments, trying to find a question, period. “There are so many hearts. I don’t understand. Why are there so many hearts? I’m one step away from crying and everyone’s sending me hearts. Send me tissues, guys. Really need them. Okay. Wow. I haven’t found a single word in a minute. And... here!”
Everheart laughs when he mentions Peggy’s casting. “Really? I’m glad you feel that way,” she saye, leading into a question Steve can tell will be a heavier one. “There have been quite a number of people—”
He has to hide his laughter with a hand, and then resorts to covering his face with both hands to hide his red expression. He’s laughing too hard, he knows it, goddamn. At least everyone knows he’s an absolute idiot already.
Kat considers this. “Fair,” she says. “But I think that a reason why people view it as a good relationship, and a stunning romance was because of the chemistry that the two of you have together. Every single scene that the two of you had together were scenes that all but rippled tension to viewers from the screens. I mean, how was it for you guys, shooting scenes that were dark and intense?”
up,” Tony—as Dominic—growled at him, rising up from the piano bench with a still grace that belied the feral nature of his voice and eyes. His back was still to Steve—as Liam—but Steve could imagine Tony’s face saying that to him, in real life, and he immediately tride to shut down those thoughts. Steve failed, and instead involuntarily shuddered, closing his eyes sensually as he did so. When he opened them, Steve started to remember every single time in his life when he was drunk on lust so that he could properly be eye-fucking Tony for the sake of the scene. This scene would be one of the only times Steve could ever act on any repressed feeling he had for Tony, and selfish and creepy or not, Steve at least wanted it out his system. Not that it would work, but he could try. With the impression people had of him, they would just say he was a committed actor and no one would have to know the difference.
"That's bullshit," Tony says, because what else is he going to respond to that? "Can you just give me a straight answer? Come on."
”You called it a vision,” Steve quietly says, standing up in realization slowly. “She showed Natasha, Bruce, Thor and I our worst nightmares, not our futures. Not
"Straight as my hair," she bluntly says, and he realizes she knows, she's known this entire time about Steve and the fact that Tony knew. Her hair is in ruby red ringlets. "And no one else knows, so don't you dare share it."
“Steve,” a soft, familiar voice says in surprise, and he jerks his head up to see the owner of the voice.
Somehow Steve has gotten it in his head that Tony is incapable of functioning past 36 hours of no sleep. Bastard. What an absolute bastard. Doesn't he know who Tony is? 36 hours is absolutely nothing, and besides, he has things he needs to be doing. And not just because he's trying to avoid Steve. He's on the verge of finalizing the design for Clint's collapsible bow to work with the explosive arrows correctly.
Tony walked around the bench, movements still imbued with both Tony’s natural elegance and a controlled madness that set Steve on edge. “What does it take you to
SoulFirst. God, he had forgotten about that. Pepper hadn’t, this was why Pepper was CEO. She was good at thinking logically. And life. “Stuttgart, Germany, fancy place where a guy named Heinrich Schaefer’s guest speaking?”
Tony makes a noise of dissent next to him, and the interviewer seizes upon that quickly, holding the mic underneath him and waiting expectantly. Tony takes the hint and says, “That’s not what happened,” he says, slinging an arm on top of Steve’s shoulder. “Rogers pretends like Peggy was the one that pushed the role, but I don’t think he had even an ounce of hesitation in him when he took the role. Listen, the actual things that Rogers has hesitation for are things where it will take the force of a small nation to try and shove him.”
Pepper doesn’t answer with anything but consoling motions, and that’s pretty much how the rest of the night goes.
He doesn’t even notice that the movie has paused, or that Steve is staring at him with those big, blue eyes and a look of concern that god, Tony thinks is endearing. He’s in love with Steve, a grown man built like a truck, enough to call him endearing and cute.
”It was for the suit, but I...” Tony trails off the sentence, letting Steve fill in the blanks that he blew them all up.
“We’ve always had good chemistry,” Steve says, before he realizes he’s talked himself into a hole. “At this point, it would be kind of pathetic if we
Steve's eyes darken with a challenge, and the smirk (only this time it knows something, but what?) returns like it never disappeared into a light smile. He glances in the direction of the clock again, but doesn't seem to lay any attention to it as he looks at Tony again. "You're the genius billionaire playboy philanthropist, you tell
Tony is in a board meeting when his timer suddenly tells him he has a few days left. He stares at it for a second, wondering if that feeling in his chest is hope that the timer will finally be right, or annoyance that it would do this to him. Either way, Tony discretely hides his wrist and pretends to pay attention again. It doesn't really matter. But by judging the look on Pepper's face, he can tell that she knows his timer has decreased again and that she knows that he isn't paying attention. He loves Pepper all the more for that knowing smile on her face as she rattles off a polished and prepared business plan to the board. If she didn't have her own timer, and he wasn't such a mess and a drain to her sanity, he would have asked Pepper out a long time ago. A
He also did not deserve one of the most well-known facts about him. Steve Rogers was a blank, one of those few that weren't born with a timer. Every single history book and every single book on timers never failed to mention that tidbit. He was always used as a point to show everyone that people without timers could live happy lives and romantic ones too. Steve Rogers and Peggy Carter, of course, are one of history's famous couples, and the reason that much of the stigma behind the timerless and  timer-ignoring romances was removed. Though she went on to marry another man, Daniel Sousa, who had lost his soulmate early on, that relationship as well proved that other love still existed.
Because Steve’s now dropped his tea—empty, how the hell did he sip so fast?—on the ground, and his cuff has fallen. No one knows why Steve wears a cuff since everyone knows he’s a blank, but Tony now knows.
“I think it’s a little more weird kissing an actor who you met pretty recently,” Tony slowly says, since Steve says absolutely nothing trying to come up with a different answer that is appropriate, “Because you have to establish some kind of chemistry or people will see right through that. And, you know, Steve and I have won awards for that, so.” He laughs.
When he looks back at the livestream, Steve shrugs, not denying it. “What was I talking about before?” he asks, wondering if he actually finished answering the question suddenly.
Not only are there mixed results, people throw in other breeds of dogs, almost like they’ve thought about this before. Steve doesn’t know whether to be concerned or not, or to think too hard about the fact that this is a divisive question people have opinions on. It’s like a Buzzfeed quiz, the ones where you pick out the subjects you liked in high school and the ones who hated in college and they told you what dog you were.
“I know,” Tony says, trying to alleviate Steve’s guilt, and god, is this what’s eating at Steve? “I found a video when I was pulling files out about the Avengers. And a file.”
“And with the way we shot them,” Tony adds on, with a funny look Steve’s direction, “It was generally different. Peggy made us do a lot of our scenes in one continuous take. The first scene where we’re actually together onscreen, the scene where Rogers seduces me again, that one was our first take, first shot. Sure, I think they used different cameras on us to catch everything, but that was one take, one shot. It was also the first scene we shot together, funny enough. There wasn’t room to be awkward, and I feel like with Steve, it could have never been awkward.” Steve has to remind himself that he is on national television before his mind starts telling him just what had happened during that scene and how hot it had been.
"Tony. Wha–Tony, oh my god!" Steve's relieved yet panicked voice sighed—why did Steve sound like he was running a marathon in an asthmatic body?—on the other end of the call. "Tony, god, you're alive, the news said the mansion... and there was a bomb and you weren't found and the Mandarin was... oh my god, Tony, are you okay?"
Tony spends the next weeks hiding from Steve every time Steve wears tight clothing, but he definitely does
So Tony sheds off his armor, pulls off the undersuit he had actually managed to put on, and then prepares himself to meet Dr. Bruce Banner, world-renowned scientist who had dropped off the grid a few years ago, last known (at least as far as Tony had dug) as researching the supersoldier serum. Tony wanted to know why, and then pick the 7-PhD-holding scientist’s brain. He smelled the start of an amazing bromance.
“Of course you didn’t Steve,” Natasha says placidly. Steve knows he’s being played and placated. “The submission just qualified by itself.” She scoffs, but there is still no heat behind it, thank god. But just as he’s about to say something, Natasha catches sight of something, maybe a clock or a sign, and frowns. “Shit. I gotta go read out a name.”
"Who are you showing off to?" Tony asks slyly, starting his eyes around to try and see if Steve will blush at the insinuation. "Is there someone you're trying to impress?"
“Not that I think you should ask anyone this,” Steve says, looking down so the camera can’t catch his eyes while he’s still thinking of what to say, “but it’s slightly true. Apparently there’s a rumor going around that I was checked into rehab. Um, no. I don’t even know if there’s a rehab facility for someone who cries too much. I’m not even talking about Bambi.” Steve laughs. “But I’ve been seeing a grief counselor for two and a half months. All I can say is that I should have been doing it for the past four years.”
"What is it now?" Pepper curiously asks, gesturing to her wrist with a discreet motion. Even though he had taken his cuff off during the meeting when he felt it change and then hidden his wrist so no one could see, he never hid it from Pepper or Rhodey, who knew. And even still, she never looked, never breached that trust, and never tried to glance at it, even though he had let her. And even though she could see it right now if she wanted to, she didn't.
Tony gapes for what must be the fifth or sixth time that night. "You did what?" He wasn't even aware that Steve knew about the list, let alone was helping Tony with the list. "She did what?"
No one registers who he is here, and if they do, they don’t care. At all. It’s pretty refreshing, actually, and today’s been the kind of day he’d love to drink here, but unfortunately, he’s on a  mission, no matter how self-imposed. The bartender takes one good look at him and probably jumps to the conclusion that like a few of the non-regulars here, he’s a higher middle class, middle-aged man with a midlife crisis that brought him here. He already starts prepping a drink for Tony, something stereotypical, but Tony keeps walking ahead, trying to find Rogers while ignoring all the stares he’s getting. It’s obvious that none of the other middle-aged patrons—ah he suddenly realizes he’s wearing a goddamn suit—venture this far in, where inhibitions are lowered and there’s no such thing as dancing, just sex upright.
"Modern dance? Are you caught up there?" he asks. "Or is are the worlds of hip-hop and contemporary confusing?"
"Straight as my hair," she bluntly says, and he realizes she knows, she's known this entire time about Steve and the fact that Tony knew. Her hair is in ruby red ringlets and the farthest thing from being straight. "And no one else knows, so don't you dare share it."
He didn't know what to say. He couldn't say anything, not when Steve was there and so pale like a ghost and straddling the line of death and—
Uh huh, like it was only Steve. Tony heard Steve call out Natasha's name defensively and let himself weakly smile.
She bores a hole right through him. “You’ve talked about everyone else this interview, besides one very noticeable exception.”
That someone happens to be Steve, wearing light wash jeans that are almost even tighter than anything Tony's seen before and a red button-up that could be anywhere from ruby red to maroon with how the light is hitting it. It is also tight-fitting, but it isn't completely ridiculous, and looks just perfect between showing off those muscles and not. Tony wonders just who is in charge of Steve's wardrobe and his outfit choices, and if he wants to send them a thank you basket for helping him move on from khakis and old man plaid. Then again, maybe
And then Steve does the same, except that Tony can’t take pictures for shit so it’s more selfie-type stuff. He gets to take a picture of him petting a dog though, which is very, very nice. Especially when he sees Tony recording him pet the dog. He is never leaving this down; the time he pet a Pomeranian on the red carpet for a solid ten minutes instead of doing anything else. It’s just... the Pomeranian is so cute and adorable. He misses Dodger a lot.
"Fella done you wrong?" Natasha teases huskily as she slides over his drink. She glances over to Steve, who's chatting with Thor about something involving the little cube in his hand. Thor's, not Steve's.
He puts his phone away just as the car does, in fact, stop. And because Luis’s cousin—his chauffeur for whenever Steve has these events—is a human being who lives for the dramatics just as much as Steve does sometimes, Steve doesn’t reach for his door and waits barely a second before Ricardo opens the door for him with a grand flourish. Steve steps out, and whatever screaming there had been before increases at least tenfold, and same with the camera flashes. He’s glad he has tinted sunglasses on.
Before Natasha can say something, and her face is in a carefully blank expression right now, Steve says, “They’re out there somewhere.”
“It’s a beautiful day in the neighborhood, a beautiful day for a neighbor. Would you be mine; could you be mine?” Steve sings on cue, doing his best imitation of Fred Rogers that he possibly can. He’s actually really proud of it because he has spent years trying to imitate the opening theme. Reverting back to his normal voice, he sighs and says, “No. No trace of relation either. I’ve looked.”
Something her face shifts, but Tony can't see the quick emotion that races across her face, disappearing just as quickly. Natasha carefully sets down her tea, picks up the cup he’s dropped, carefully places it next to hers, and then hugs him.
He was alive. Pepper was alive. Rhodey was alive. Happy was alive. The Mandarin was not. His mansion was not.
Steve doesn’t even realize that they’ve come for him until he feels Natasha's arms around him, holding him as best as she can when his back his firmly against the wall and acting as support for his leg. Instinctually, he leans off the wall and into her embrace—and Natasha is not know for giving away affection freely. She whispers something in Russian to him, soft enough that even if he knew Russian, he doesn’t think he would have picked up what she had said. But he can make a good guess.
"You're not denying it," Tony observes. "So there is someone. You know, you've been dancing a long time with me. Are you trying to play for jealousy? Doesn't work too often, you know. Especially when you're with me; because then they'll think you're mine for the night."
“He’s 6’2”, blond, blue eyes, muscles on muscles, uptight personality with a great ass, and probably not here,” Tony describes as the other man’s smirk deepens, somehow recognizing the description and knowing full well who is being described.
“And remind me, did I end up in a hospital bed for this long? Did I end up in a hospital bed, period? No,” Tony says, earning himself a dirty look from Steve.
Steve takes another step, not too intimidatingly and then stops. He closes his eyes and visibly suppresses another comment. When he opens them, he says, “Ultron. Ending the fight. Going h-home.” It isn’t lost to Tony on how Steve stumbles over the word, and has a faroff look in his eye. It isn’t lost to Tony on how everyone else on the team has people and a place to go to, except for Steve minus the Tower. Even Natasha, and even Bruce, whether they’ve realized it or not.
Steve looks at the camera again and smirks confidently. “Nope,” he says, popping the p. “I think I’ll be okay without your help. You tend to try and ‘help’ by going around and telling everyone that I’m woefully inexperienced. Or that I just need a hand and I most certainly do not need a hand.”
Clint blinks. "Buddy," the archer slowly says. "You're really not going to tell me that you haven't noticed that Steve swings the other way, right?" Tony gapes, because since when does Clint know? But Clint takes it the wrong way and frowns. "Oh man, did I just—Tasha! You said that he fucking knew! Jesus fuck, outing someone isn't... that's—”
“But in all seriousness, I probably should thank the idiot for being the reason I took the role. Thanks Stevie,” Tony says, smirking. “I also have to thank the entire cast and crew of Centre of the World for being absolute gems of human beings and for supporting the movie and I this entire process of awards season. This couldn’t that been possible without any of you, least of all Director Peggy Carter and our lovely producers and writing team, the Howlies. The six of you deserve this award just as much as I do, you know. I’d like to also thank the two lovely ladies in my life, my mother and the fabulous Pepper Potts, for being ever so supportive and helpful. Thank you so much.” He winks, running a hand through his hair and walking off the stage as the music plays him out.
"Okay," Natasha says, considering it in her mind. "Fair." They talk a little bit more, but break off when Natasha's suddenly busy with her actual role of today.
Tony flickers his attention over to Natasha, not wanting to be any more obvious, and sends her a seductive smile that both of them know means nothing. "Why don't you do me wrong? I bet it'll feel right." With that stupidly cheesy line, he stifles the urge to grin at himself and break the game Natasha's playing.
They think he's wrapped up in his own world. They think he doesn't notice things as much as the rest of them, because he's always thinking in his own head. They think he doesn't care. They think that he can't put two and two together when it comes to people and small, hidden details. They aren't entirely wrong, but they aren't entirely right, either. Half the time, he's all dulled senses and enhanced engineering functions but the other half, he's all alert senses and enhanced thinking. With a few people, he's pays attention all the time, because they deserve him at his best, and so much more than he can give them. He tries to pay attention, and he, he hasn't really messed it up much yet, so something must be going right, right?
“Aright Buzzfeed, let’s do this,” Steve says seriously, eyeing the bucket of thirst tweets with apprehension. Last time, Bucky had done it with Sam and they had been pretty normal. But Bucky and Sam had also done a segment with M’Baku, and those had been on a wilder side. The ones that Bruce received... well, people still teased him about it to this day and that was putting it very, very nicely.
“Alright, we’ve got bellabellavilla asking why I hadn’t prepared a speech for the Oscars after I won the Golden Globe. Actually the worst part was that I did. I had a memorized speech, and just in case I forgot it, I wrote it down on a piece of paper and... I wasn’t joking when I said I, you know, had one ready since I was young.” Steve flicks his hand into the air, as if to dismiss his words in mock annoyance at himself. “And...”
Steve winces a little, like he didn’t want to bring it up and make Tony relive those memories on account of him. “Okay,” Steve just nods, restarting the movie.
"Alright, so he doesn't stand out too much, then, in this crowd." Tony realizes that's not a question, so he tacks on, "Right?"
"Caltain America is a day job," Steve says when he comes to pick Tony up from his lab because Tony has apparently spent too many hours in here without real food and sleep. "It's not my priority in the sense that it's yours, but it is a priority and a day job."
questions,” Steve says, making a suggestive face at the cameras. He peels back the first one and reads, “Is Tony Stark adopted?”
Steve turns around in surprise and stares at Tony with hope in his eyes. A smile curves his pink lips. “I think that was the shortest talk we’ve had.”
They both quickly pull away from each other, hands retracting from where they were. It’s akin to teenagers being caught, though as Tony sneaks a glance towards Steve, he doesn't seem to be ashamed. Steve doesn’t even seem fazed. Tony
"You know, I like manhandling as much as the next kinky person, but if it happens, I really want some sex to go with it," Tony says.
“I’m sorry; I shouldn’t be crying right now,” he apologizes, trying to force a smile on his mouth. It wavers, and he tries to force all images and memories of his ma out of his mind. But Steve’s never been good at trying to forget her, not even for a minute, and so the memories plague him still. “It’s just—when I was 5, I watched the Oscars for the first time and told my mother I wanted to be on that stage. When I was 6, 7, 8, 15, 18... same story, same picture. Spent long nights and confidence-low moments practicing and perfecting a hypothetical Oscar speech. You know, so I wouldn’t forget to thank everybody. And as the years went on, the list of people grew and shrank, changing once over and then twice fold. There’s only ever been one person who’s made ever single iteration of that list; one person who I’d thank every last lucky star to and—”
He was cut off by Tony experimentally rolling his hips against Steve’s, and Steve let out a moan that he would have been embarrassed by in any other case, had Tony not covered it by kissing him again. He knew that his back was starting to arch a little, so that his body was pressing more and more into Tony’s providing friction for a problem he was avoiding until now.
“I miss your name on my lips,” Steve amended with a gracious tilt of his head, still looking Tony in the eye as he delivered the lines that snapped Tony’s character and got Steve’s character what he wanted. Right now, he was a man who was betting his very soul for the gamble of his time, exposing trust and utter weakness that a murderer wouldn’t show to anyone else. “I miss   your hands in my hair. I miss losing control to the way you called me yours, the way you made me scream and
“I’m hurt,” Tony says, “I’m so incredibly hurt. See if I ever wingman you again, Mr. Straight-Laced. I’ll just laugh at your failure.”
The question remains on why Rogers would be at it, since nothing about a gay bar would go along with his old constitution.
he had lost it. Fury was basically not at all amused, but then Tony had made a remark about the last time
“It’s pretty clear that you’ve loved the experience,” she says with an amused smile on her face, probably unused to enthuasitic idiots like himself gushing about their jobs like he is right now, even though he should be a seasoned professional. “What about the people you worked with? How did they kind of shape your time on the movie?”
"Nope," Clint says, popping the p and somehow managing to grin over a glass of champagne. Classy, and so much unlike Clint. "We all know your favorites are Bruce and Steve. Because of sex and science."
“Laura’s already chewed me out,” Clint mutters just as Natasha’s tearing him a new one in frantic hand gestures and glaring looks.
Tony can feel his face crumple. He doesn’t cry. He doesn’t; Stark men do not cry. They are made of iron and steel will and they do not cry.
“No,” Tony says very slowly, staring at the question very carefully. “I am not. Why do you ask, random Google user?”
Two months, and nothing. Not a single person has said anything, and Tony/JARVIS have checked everywhere.
Steve and Tony nod, though Steve shrugs nonchalantly. “Yeah,” he says, “With the exception of the two of us, everyone else is breaking their blackout silence tomorrow. The two of us can’t keep our mouths shut though, so we’re tonight.” He glances at Tony and catches the shameless grin on Tony’s face.
“You’re not denying the puppy part,” Tony retorts. Much louder, he asks, “What do you think? Is he more like a golden retriever or a lab?”
Tony tries to hide his shock at the information that has been revealed to him and instead looks at Rogers. Rogers, who’s in jeans that look like they’ve been stitched onto him for how tight and ass-flattering they are, and a green-gray Henley that shows off every flexing muscle while leaving nothing to the imagination. His hair is messy and tousled in a way that Tony’s never seen in. He can’t make much out, but he can tell that the shirt is buttoned, for hoe the light doesn’t reflect off of them right.
Tony wants to backtrack, backtrack, backtrack faster than he can think or even handle right now. “Fury—”
“No, I wasn’t um... Peggy had a timer,” he shakes his head, weakly trying to explain. “And Daniel was her soulmate. History liked its own story.”
But as the party winds down somewhere near midnight, somewhere near one, and he's gliding across the room, checking up and socializing seamlessly, he notices something strange. When he looks at Natasha, who's subtly staring at the same thing with a hint of curiosity, he goes over to her again. Seems like they were wrong, or Steve wasn't telling the full truth.
Sam—new guy, codename: Falcon, as in those wings he had designed years ago—finishes telling the story and Tony leans back on the door more, blown away in horror. It just doesn't make any sense, and yet it completely does. Vague bits and pieces, things that seemed off now had explanations. None of it was something Tony wanted to accept.
“Steve,” the bartender yells over, which means Tony has to stop staring like a lunatic, “You have a friend looking for you!”
had gotten laid, and that was that. Hill showed up fifteen minutes later than Steve, but she looked perfectly put together while holding a cup of SHIELD café coffee, which he knew took a minimum of twenty minutes to receive. Huh. She was good.
So Tony invites Steve to a party he's throwing at the Tower out of good spirit, and Steve accepts it surprisingly, also in good spirit. He didn't even have to say anything to convince Steve to say yes, which really threw him for a loop, considering he had a few things up his sleeve to try and persuade him. Tony'll take it as a win.
“Hey Mrs. Rogers,” he hears Tony say, placing something down. “Sorry I’m late, I wanted to get you flowers, but Mamá started crying and then I started crying at the flower shop. The florists spent half an hour trying to calm the two us down. All of us miss you, you know. I bought lilies for you; the plain white ones you loved so much even if everyone else teased you for it. Found the shop and everything, no thanks to Steve.”
Steve holds his hands up, showing the lack of a ring around any of them. “Actually,” he dryly says, “I’ve been married to Peggy Carter since we were eighteen and you just can’t see our rings because they’re clear. Our anniversary was last week. It was our tenth anniversary.”
Steve takes the out and walks over to Tony, an incredulous look creeping over his face. “No, I hadn’t noticed,” he comments, gesturing to the boards behind them that declare the movie they’re here for. Cameras still continue to go off, but someone shouts for them to keep on going. A brief look at his watch tells him that they’ve been photographed for nearly fifteen minutes straight. Horrible.
Natasha and Clint have a priority as SHIELD agents, and this Tony knows. He has a priority to Stark Industries. Bruce has one to his science. Thor has one to Asgard. They all have day jobs. So what does Steve have? Captain America isn't a day job.
Steve chooses that moment to step out of Bruce and Natasha’s room with his old man pajamas and thin shirt, Bruce bright pink behind him. That’s a story, Tony thinks. Steve’s also holding what seem to be Clint’s hearing aids. Steve tries to sign something, but horribly fails on account of Clint’s hearing aids still in his hand. Steve looks Clint in the eye—with nowhere near as intensity as he does Tony all the time—and clearly asks, “Did you take these out again?”
"Are you sure you aren't deliberately fucking with me? Because I refuse to believe you've thought of everyone and come up blank."
Does Steve really need to drag Tony out of his workshop every single time he comes to the Tower? No. Does Steve really need to bodily life Tony out of said workshop when Tony doesn’t come voluntarily? No. Does Steve really need to call Pepper every single time the armor fights him off? Does Steve really need to have JARVIS on his side after Pepper bans Tony from using the armor to fight Steve off? No. Does it all happen anyway? Yes. Unfortunately.
"You're already tired, and JARVIS won't let you out of your suite or in the reach if anything vaguely interesting until you go to bed."
Steve’s about to find a new question, a happier one, when he hears the door open and close. Tony. On reflex, he leans back against the sofa and leans against it hard enough that it moves back, so he can see Tony walk in. Granted, Steve’s head is also tipped back like crazy, like he’s baring his throat to the camera, but he’s also been told it’s a flattering angle—it’s fine.
He hadn’t believed in soulmates, because he thought he didn’t have one. And now it turned out he has one, he has one that he let slip through and he doesn’t know whether to laugh or cry or not feel anything at all. Lucky soulmate, for avoiding him and his mess, but he feels sorry for the person out there who’ll live with the knowledge that they have lost theirs. And really, he didn’t care and he doesn’t know why he’s caring right now, but he knew it was just going to have to pass.
Tony can hear Rogers scoff before he turns around and comes face to face with Tony. The casual, friendly asshole vibe from Rogers completely dissolves into one of a practiced neutrality. He stiffens and tenses so much that Tony realizes how relaxed he was just seconds prior. Because this abrupt transformation, this posture that Rogers is sporting? It isn't anything new to Tony. This is what Tony sees when he looks at Rogers everytime. This is, apparently, a complete lie.
"I think I'll let go of you for now," Steve says as Tony realizes that this song, whatever it is, is winding down. "Come find me if you've got another question. Promise I'll answer." He winks at Tony lavishly, and then they part ways, with Steve going to find a new dance partner, and Tony finding someone new to schmooze. Though really, they're both doing the same thing. "You have eleven questions left."
