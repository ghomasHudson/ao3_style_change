He woke up before everybody else. He had been sitting in the living room for more than an hour when the others came down, their faces still sleepy, yet their eyes filled with happy anticipation, knowing what was coming.
« I promised you could but not now, Pumpkin » he said, dropping a kiss on her forehead. « Finish your plate. You’ve got danse class today. »
« Exactly, but in small doses… Bryan refuses to host more than 10 guests at a time… The ranch has proposed horseback tourism for the last four years… It regularly happens we welcome the same clients every year… At first, we weren’t very excited about this idea. But this ranch has been a family business for so many years that we couldn’t let it disappear… Besides, I have to admit I like it » he was smiling. « Bryan is somewhat not as fond of this as I am.... Therefore, I’m the one taking care of this part of the ranch » he drank the rest of his beer.
He had postponed for so many days, spending the night elsewhere made him feel gutless and lacking conviction.
Castiel bursted out laughing. Dean couldn’t help laughing as well, although she felt a bit uncomfortable .
« Gimme a break and don’t you look at me as if I put some poison in there… It shouldn’t taste any worse than Jo’s pudding » he felt a bit offended as he put the pie on the coffee table.
For his family. This precious family: Chadwick, Jewel, Jo, Bobby and even Balty. But especially Castiel…
Dean had never really liked this period of the year that much and if not for the children, Christmas would have been an ordinary day.
« Are you thinking the same thing as your sister? » Jo suddenly needed to know... The kids were living with them 24/7. They had been sharing everything for the last three years... They were sitting in the front seat.
Dean smiled: his kids always needed Castiel’s approval even if they always asked their father first.
He walked out of the room without another word. Castiel stared at the pillow on which Dean had slept. When he heard Dean close the door, he grabbed his clothes and headed for the bathroom.
Surprised by the violence of the other’s reaction, Dean fell back on his butt, his face frozen by Castiel’s sudden burst of anger.
Ten minutes later, the person they had been waiting for long finally showed up, making quite an entrance, to say the least.
Dean kept his eyes on him until he was out of sight and remained still for a moment, staring at the door.
« Did it ever cross your mind that you might be wrong ? That Castiel loves Dean but that he also learned to cope with Lisa’s arrival and that Zeke could be the opportunity he was looking for to move on ? Maybe you helped him after all… Isn’t it what you wanted ? For him to be happy? »
« Of course I will... Where else should I be?» he smiled and brushed a lock of hair from her forehead.
« Do you wanna talk to the kids ? Yeah, you too… Good night » he smiled.« I wouldn’t dare… OK, bye… I put you through to Jewel » the impatient little girl was pulling his pants leg.
Just a few kisses and your firm hand that takes our two dicks on this bed with mattress springs that hurt my back.
He doesn't answer. The hunter sees the angel's face fade and this sadness which is so familiar to him, veiling his blue gaze.
"And I kept my... promise, son," he answers, pushing Bobby away, and this time he's keeping it. "Happy... birthday," he babbles, literally collapsing at his feet. "I have... I have something for you. ", as he reached into his pocket again.
" SHUT UP... I'm not a fagot, man.. I loved women... I love Cassie and Lisa... I ..." Dean screams, stubbornly, between anger and despair. Not knowing how to let go after twenty years of silence.
Castiel was doing this to make the pain vanish when she was hurt ; it was his way to deal with the kids’ bruises.
« What are you looking at ? At least this one isn’t fuchsia » Balty replied looking down at his shorts.
« Is it that hard to say ?» Balty smiled a sad smile. « Because your silence is more eloquent than words, you know»
« No way ! » Dean snapped back, standing up. « I hate this. It’s full of bugs and the only time I have been on a camping trip, there were thunderstorms and organized mosquitoes raids. THERE IS NO WAY I AM GOING THROUGH THIS AGAIN !»
« No... I’d prefer that shirt over there » Chadwick replied showing the one he had selected : a black shirt with white shoulder patch.
There were laughters and giggles ; because they first had to catch the calf, master it and then tie the hind legs. Each adult was assigned to a child who was in charge of tying the legs.
« Dream on... » Dean said, grabbing the bowl, putting it on his lap and getting comfortable with his back against the couch. He didn’t notice that he was in fact leaning on Castiel’s leg, who smiled but didn’t say a word.
" Wait ! " the other walked to him. " I’m gonna take a quick shower. Just give me five minutes, so that I can get rid of that dirt "
She looked at her brother drinking his coffee. She was dying to tell him about her feelings but she knew him too well and felt he would surely close the subject before the conversation had a chance to develop.
"Nothing's changed," miffed "You wanted to know how he was, so you did... You can put your conscience back in your head and get on with your shitty little life. "
Weeks went by and Apache settled in the family. Every Saturday, after their swimming and dancing classes, the kids and Dean – as well as Castiel when he was free - would go to the canine education center. Apache was learning to obey… when it pleased him !
« Leave me alone» Castiel whispered with contempt, pushing him away. « What did you expect ? That I would be broken after you loathed your resentment and jealousy, huh? » he said with disdain. « I’ve learned to live with it ; this pain has been a part of me, not for a short week, but for the last TEN years» he now pushed Zeke away violently. « So don’t you piss me off with your qualms. Indeed, he doesn’t love me ; indeed this is killing me, but I don’t care. Because I live with him. Because he likes me in his own way and that’s more than enough for me. Do you understand? He’ll always be the only one that matters. He needs me as much as I need him »
« You look like a real cow-boy... Suits you real nice » He took upon himself to smile, although he felt a twinge of regret.
« I thought you had finally understood after all these years of turmoil that you can’t go on alone »
« I love you too, more than anyone. I hope you’ll find the strength to love him, whatever the obstacles»
There would be so much to say, but they don't talk emotion in the Winchester house, not more than they did in the Novak house. That's the hard lesson Castiel just learned.
" Everything’s fine... But don’t count on me for the next ride… I’m not into sliding sports " he confessed, brushing the snow from his coat.
As Jo had told him, Dean wouldn’t have been the same at all if it had been about Balty ... She even assured him that Dean would never have moved in with him under the same roof ...
"Go upstairs and sober up in your room... you'll give it to him when you're well enough to do so. ", the old man says, indicating the stairway to the first floor.
He would then let them run freely during a little less than an hour before walking them all back to their respective owners.
Once at the top of the small hill, they watched Castiel waving his arms down the hill. Jewel waved her little arms as well.
« Of course, Pumpkin. So, what about that desert ? ‘Cause I’m a little hungry now » he announced, looking at the children and rubbing his belly.
He had to speak with him, and the sooner the better. The more he was postponing their conversation, the harder it would be, and silence was the worst thing that could grow between them. That would surely destroy their precious bond with bitterness and regrets.
« I’m not asking for anything, Dean. Just let me love you… And if you want to stop right here afterwards, just tell me… I’ll never force you to go any further »
« Of course not, but I can hear your thoughts loud and clear! » Castiel snapped back, grabbing the reins and saddling up.
She pushed her chair and ran behind her brother who had already left the room under the protective supervision of Apache.
« You should get some rest from time to time, you know » she said, grabbing the bowl and putting it on the table. « You look terrible »
« Would you please set the table while I start cooking ? » he grabbed the eggs, the butter and the cheese.
" Because you keep offering me you neck every morning and your lips every night " Castiel said with a light smile on his lips, stretched between tenderness and fatalism.
It was a fast conclusion. She had smiled at him and dragged him to the bathroom. There were very clients during the day. The staff showed a bit more indulgence on misdemeanors during the day.
He had spent a long time with her in the kitchen the day before… taking advantage of Dean’s absence in the afternoon.
Late in the evening, she pretended to have a headache and went home, politely turning down Dean’s invitation to sleep over.
The reproaches, the forgiveness... All these words for speaking without saying anything and his silences that reveal without letting anything appear.
« Aren’t you supposed to be asleep ? » he was obviously ashamed to have been caught talking to himself again.
« If they had, I’d have hunted them across the Earth and made them eat their own balls. I swear on my life »
He felt the tears coming out of his eyes and his composure collapsing. He buried his face in his hands.
He went there on foot, just to take his mind off things... Hands in his trench coat’s pockets, he walked with his eyes fixed on the ground, lucky enough to avoid the passers-by who stepped aside.
He thought about the first years, the first encounter, the first laughters, the first tears as well.
« I don’t wanna play with him. If I finally understand we’re no match, what’s gonna happen to us? To him? »
« C’mon Sweetie, don’t cry now... it’s only two weeks. You’re gonna have so much fun at Bobby’s. Besides you need to take care of Tessa now, huh ?» he kneeled down in front of her and gave her a big smile.
« I guess this makes us an official couple now ? » Dean laughed, mocking a bit, but most of all afraid of what this entailed.
" I never imagined I’d have this kind of discussion with you, let alone anyone else, for that matter... ".
« Yes, here » Dean snapped in a low voice, kneeling before Castiel. « Here and now...Because I may not have the courage and because… I want it, Cass ». Still staring at him in the eye, he detached his belt buckle and let his fingers slide along the zipper.
« You’re mad at me, aren’t you ? I know I tricked you in front of the kids… I should have talked to you before, but when Byron made me that offer this morning, I admit I got a bit carried away»
A young man was in charge of the barbecue. Dean started an endless discussion with Mark about horses of a different kind. The mechanic in him had taken over.
« What happened yesterday… » he took a deep breath « Lisa... Zeke... I know it looks pretty disturbing to you… to us all » he couldn’t resolve to look at Castiel.
And sometimes, like today, he would let go all together and kiss him with passion, greeting Castiel’s hand on his hips and his fingers on his skin. He felt ready to lose himself and Castiel was then starting to hope again.
« Hi, Deanie, sweetheart » he tapped his shoulder, still wearing his winter gloves. « It’s freezing out there » he said, stamping on the entrance mat.
“Soon, you’ll no longer have an angel at your side.” The child whispered as she was brought into the ambulance, faking a pained look.
« It’s been a while since I had so much fun » he tapped Castiel’s arm without even realizing, just because he wanted to. He took him by the shoulder and pulled him in a brief embrace.
« Yeah, why don’t you do that?» Castiel was really angry. Dean had never seen that kind of reaction and just stood there, open-mouthed.
Dean's face decomposed. Chadwick turned around, Castiel saw him searching for the anonymous molester in the crowd.
Dean felt it before he actually heard it… The music coming from the living room. He put his towel away, intrigued and headed to the living room door.
« It would change a lot of things » she stood up too. « You liked it. Admit it. And that’s what scares you. You’d have preferred to find it disgusting or repulsive, to find the answer to your question, to your doubts » She gave a wry smile. « Bad luck! ».
He put his phone back in his pocket, breathed in deeply to hold back the pain twisting his guts and caught up with the kids...
Dean hesitated... Why not, after all? He had a crap private life so far... Helen was right, he had to think a little more of himself and at that moment, he was just lusting after that guy with his angelic smile and his eyes that burnt more brightly than the flames of Hell.
Dean checks his fake FBI badge, slips it into the inside pocket of his suit which he adjusts as well as his tie.
Castiel smiled. Dean let go of his hand. It went further south, brushed against his side and made Dean shiver even more and brace himself a little.
Lisa was fighting a ghost of flesh and blood in addition to another one from the past… The fight had been lopsided truncated… From the very beginning. Yet she wanted to believe she could make it, despite Dean’s doubts, because these doubts were also what she loved in Dean.
He pressed the shovel in with his boot and flung aside the first mound of dirt… He dug without thinking, like an automaton, sweat ran done his back… He straightened up… Everything was going too fast… He slowed down, he was now below ground level, hip deep in this hole and only a few centimeters from him.
« I don’t know… I’m lost. All I know is I’m waiting for his calls with a knot in my heart. I’m counting the days because I need to hear his voice, to hear him grumble because I borrowed his shirts, to hear him laugh at my silly jokes even if he didn’t get half of them… I need him by my side»
Lisa hadn’t heard from Dean since Monday… He said he was busy as the holidays approached and the garage activities were taking most of his time… At the end of the week, he would close it for fifteen days, as he did every year…
The hunter approaches while keeping their hands trapped seeking this contact which has become vital to him. He doesn't care if it's cliché or if it tarnishes this macho image that stucks him. He spits his happiness in the face of all his rednecks who judge them without even knowing them. These same rednecks who owe them their lives and who condemn them because they are men.
"Nice about-turn, Dean" he empties his coffee. "I was just trying to tell you that we had the bunker, friends and acquaintances...That we're still together.... But that he had nothing left... No paradise, no roof, no friends except us... He is hunted by his own people, he has lost all his bearings and... "
Filled with hesitation and clumsiness, his lips met Castiel’s and soon he let him guide him from a delicate chaste kiss.
« Balty » Castiel’s voice cracked like a whiplash. « That’s enough » he added, looking at him. « Please » his voice became more gentle.
Dean explains his father's unfortunate mating attempts. Castiel's laughter turns his guts upside down. Castiel calms down, his eyes catch Dean's.
« Don’t even think I’m gonna walk in the streets dressed in this ridiculous outfit ! » Dean snapped, pointing at the living room.
And so they went on, occasionally making a pause in front of a work that raised concern... Balty came back a few minutes later ... He was all smiles, obviously pleased with himself.
« No, I’m not... If I wasn’t interested in your opinion, I wouldn’t have talked about it » he said, pushing away his empty plate. « It’s just that it’s… » he took a deep breath in « ...complicated »
« If she refuses that you attend the festival, nobody will. As of tomorrow, I’ll look for another dance class for Jewel. Who does she think she is…that bitch ? She perfectly knows how much you mean to us. »
They all turned around and observed the man standing in front of them: he was wearing a complete Buffalo Bill outfit.
« It’s perfect » Dean jumped on the other side of the fence, adjusted his Stetson and proudly walked towards the animal....
Dean glanced at the fireplace mantle and at the table in the entrance, where Balty had exposed the car, safe from further incident.
Castiel was allocated the room downstairs ; it used to be Jo’s room, and sometimes Dean’s ; the kids were allocated the one in the attic and Dean was to occupy the spare room on the first floor…
It took them quite a while to say their final goodbyes. Jewel hugged each of the four men, Chadwick thanked them again and again.
Balty had left in the morning and Dean almost regretted his inconvenient remarks. He had never felt so uncomfortable among his family members. Castiel’s silence, even more than his children’s, was the hardest to cope with. He had thought about Balty’s words and come to the conclusion that Castiel was simply afraid of being ejected from their lives for the benefit of Lisa.
« That kiss… that damned kiss… I loved it, Cass... » he finally said, looking him in the eyes. Cass didn’t react.
"One more game and we’re done ... And tell Chadwick your drinks are here ... I thought he was thirsty "
« NO! » Dean said loudly. « Get out of here… you’re blocking the view » he gently pushed the dog away.
Jewel jumped from Balty’s arms to go kiss her father while Chadwick took off his coat, starting a conversation with Bryan, fascinated by his belt buckle.
« From that moment, I haven’t stopped asking myself so many questions… Shit, I’m a straight guy. I’ve never been attracted by men. But then again, you’re not any man. You’re my best friend, a member of my family » Dean felt a wave of panic grow inside him, he was speaking too fast, too loud. Castel hadn’t moved an inch.
The crowd started to laugh as a man from the security service ran to help a drunk Santa who had most certainly tested every single bar on the way.
« Of course… and… Castiel ?» He called his friend before he left. « Thanks. I owe you one… If you hadn’t been there, I would have died of boredom.»
« I am, in your eyes, but… » he sighed. « Don’t worry. We’re not going to ruin any of it. The little one has been waiting for this for so long. You will record it on tape and we’ll watch it later in the evening, with pizza for everyone, OK?»
However, he had never enjoyed this festival as much as when he celebrated it for the first time with Tessa and her little ordinary family.
« And the young man over there with his eyes stuck on his PSP screen is Chadwick » Dean looked at his son with angry eyes.
« Don’t push yourself if you don’t like it » Bobby indicated as Dean was serving himself a third plate.
« Yes, Cass, alone… » He looked away. « I need some time… Just a little bit more time» he added with a little smirk.
« Boy, I don’t know what’s got into you but you seem to travel a lot lately » Bobby said, drawing circles on his temple with his forefinger.
" It felt strange at first, but I’m OK with it now… sort of " Chadwick smiled. " He loves you, you know..." he whispered, as his father hadn’t said a word.
Baby Jesus was installed in the crib and, in a few days, the Christmas tree would travel back in the garden again, hopefully surviving until the next festivities.
The fact that he had slapped her in the face was an obvious evidence pain was eating him from inside and he was unable to cope with what had fallen on him.
Dean looked at Castiel and pointed at a picture next to the big one, on the right. Jewel had glued with little heart-shaped stickers what the family currently represented for her.
Dean and Castiel joined Balty who was in a big discussion with a graying man ... Jewel and Chadwick were standing by his side, sipping their soda.
They remained in each other’s embrace for a while and the children exchange a look of complicity, the dog sitting at their feet.
Madison was a different matter, although he intended to take measures for the rest of them in a short while. She has been a part of his life since their very first encounter.
« As you know, in three weeks, you’re gonna have several days off and you’ve deserved them for sure… » he started with a wink. « How would you like to spend a few days in a real ranch? »
« Does… Does Castiel have someone in his life... The point is, each time I try to raise the subject, he … eludes it »
He's already lost his bloodline family. Castiel refuses to lose his adopted one because of his sexual orientation.
While Balty was playing in the garden with Apache that tagged along since his arrival, Bryan helped Dean with the preparation of the corn. They got to know each other better, talking about this and that. When Balty came back with the dog on his heels, they were laughing out loud.
John notes by the glow of the wall light that her eyes are reddened, but what makes him take a step back is Castiel's swollen face.
He was in love with Jo and what she brought him even though he was reluctant to plan for the future of their relationship... He had told Jo on the very first day of their encounter, painting would always come first. She had accepted it; she had acknowledged that part she was attracted to… The artist.
Lost in his memories of Tessa and spending the holidays at Bobby’, Dean had never thought that the kids would miss this tradition, they had never spoken about it to their father and the latter had never tried to raise the subject.
“No, I’m not.” Dean looked up and met the old man’s eyes. “Franck... Do you believe in love at first sight?”
« There was ; for him, it was a sin, the ultimate sin, the worst of them all. His son, whom he was so proud of, the son he claimed to love, was nothing but an abomination in God’s eyes and his own. »
Dean and Jo had bought a new winter coat for Bobby, as the old one was far too worn out. He tried it on immediately, it fit perfectly.
He pushed her away with tenderness and tried to contain the emotion building up inside. It was useless though.
"If you want to , I could go and pick them up ... I just have to take care of some paperwork at the garage, it shouldn’t take too long"
"It’s OK. He drank water from the tap in the bathroom" she smiled as she closed her hand on the coin Castiel put in her palm.
" Sorry " Dean whispered, kissing his wrist moving close to his lips, brushing against Chadwick’s bracelet.
Castiel was holding Mrs Willard’s two English bulldogs, the librarian’s Dalmatian and their neighbor’s couple of Westies.
Tessa had kept it safe for years, this crib had been passed from one generation to the next for almost a century… It represented a little wooden barn with porcelains figurines...
« Because you’re my friend and I worry for you... Because I need to know what you’ve been through to be able to help when you need me, without acting like a jerk and say silly things »
« You may put all this on the table, I’ll take care of the rest. And go home » he said, patting the young boy’s back.
« So what ?» Dean repeated, his voice getting louder, as he almost threw the piece of bread in Balty’s plate. « I can’t do it » he finished, throwing the pan in the sink. « I can’t do it » he whispered, running his hand through his hair.
« On the contrary, you should be happy… Perfect opportunity to gather all the family. I’m pretty sure Bobby’s looking forward to it »
Dean eventually sat on the trunk with a big sigh, looking miserable. Hands on his knees. Bundled up on himself.
« Gotta go, I’m late» she stood up and struggled with her coat. She turned around and raised Castiel’s chin with her index finger. « You’ve never been a complete stranger to me. From the moment I saw those two magnificent blue ponds, I knew you were a good man. I don’t know if that guy will love you one day as you deserve, but I’m a hopeless optimistic. So, don’t give up hope: this kiss meant something for sure, Castiel. Give him some time to understand what he feels for you and what’s involved» she smiled with genuine tenderness.
« Yes, I’m Dean Winchester… My friend, Castiel Novak, is in recovery room. I need to go out and make a phone call… If in the meantime, something…. »
Castiel suspected Balty had planned everything in advance even though the latter denied, claiming it was Bryan’s idea and that he had nothing to do with it.
« Never mind. Just watch out... I wouldn’t hesitate to kick your ass if you let anything bad happen to him…Capice ? » Dean leaned back and watched the news again.
Castiel walked away from Cheyenne and saw a splendid American white and brown pony that didn’t exceed 24 inches at the withers.
“I suppose that’s what it’s called, yes... Lusting so badly after someone you don’t even know,” he smiled, his eyes fixed on the table.
Putting his cup on the coffee table, he sat with his legs to his chest on the small sofa, grey marl pyjamas and bare feet... His eyes fell on a photograph on the television...
He had brought a pecan nut pie, Jewel’s favorite, and an apple pie, to satisfy Dean and Chadwick’s preferences.
" No he’s not, Pumpkin " Dean straightened, looking so tired now, staring at nothing in particular. " It’s my fault, not yours."
He kept on digging and suddenly a smell turned his stomach, he pressed himself on the side of dirt wall. The smell of death, of putrefaction…
"How's he doing? ", Dean askes leaned over the sink so he didn't have to read into the old man's eyes.
« I’d like to remind you that YOU were to one who introduced them to each other. So don’t you start blaming me. I don’t wanna play the scapegoat and be the one to blame for your frustrated matchmaker tricks » Bryan sounded a bit irritated too now.
Furious, she threatened his son to go in the depths of the earth, to burn in hell. To disgrace his family, to shame his father.
Castiel had gone to pick up the children. Jewel had resumed her dance class with less enthusiasm than before, because in the meantime Marissa had introduced her to tennis. Chadwick had started to go swimming again.
"So my Darlings, do you enjoy this exhibition? " he asked as he put his hands on the children’s shoulders .
He got lost in his thoughts for a while. Dean remained silent, he wanted to allow Castiel to confess at his own rhythm. He didn’t want to ruin the magic of the moment.
« Cass... You need to move outa here because I’m gonna prepare supper. » His voice sounded a bit irritated.
They paused when dinner was finally being served. Jo was exhausted after only two dances and gave her place to Jewel who was a lot more performant than her at this. The dog was watching them all with a puzzled expression, wondering why they had to jump like they did, like fools. He let out a long discouraged sigh.
« Well, I do. I will NOT speak about my sex life with my sister or anyone else for that matter » Dean was starting to be angry.
« Are you sure ? Because the shop is pretty big. You can’t take everything you like, you know that. »
Balty had multitudes of conquests, with as many females as males… He loved sex and was rather vocal on the matter.
Dean had been waiting in this bloody corridor for about an hour. There he was, staring at his hands. Elbows resting on his knees. Fingers twisting in anxiety. He was looking up, in anticipation, each time a nurse came by; but none of them would talk to him, overwhelmed by the emergencies coming in endlessly.
Castiel curled up on himself like a child. Dean took off his boots and pulled a blanket up to his waist.
"I've... " Dean goes on, rubbing his face with both hands. "I have something to... Fuck... You have to know that ...", the voice breaking, the words stuck ...
His son didn’t reply and went on searching in the files, Jo was watching over his shoulder. Jewel got hooked up by the explanations running on the TV screen.
" ‘Cause it’s what Dean’s probably gonna cook for you on Saturday. It’s his specialty. Honey cornbread chicken. " he said with an almost nervous smile.
In the middle of the afternoon, Castiel got a call from Gaby asking him to meet him at TJ’s after work… It was a tavern where they enjoyed having a drink when their schedules matched.
So, « Attack of the Killer Tomatoes » left them puzzled. On the other hand, they were all unanimous about « Arac attack ». Jewel startled once in a while, which made Castiel startled in turn. But all in all they enjoyed the horror movie parody.
Dean remained on his chair, invert, unable to move an inch. He probably has lost everything meanwhile they had accepted it all, simply because they loved him.
"You saw !" Castiels stands up, with naive pride. "I succeed to tie my tie" , with that so unique smile.
He felt somebody was watching him… Chadwick was standing there, leaning on the door frame, observing his father...
Once the children had overcome their initial apprehension, they found it all easy as pie. It was a different story for Dean. Wink was the affectionate kind all right but, obviously, it was acting its own way.
« Cass...Can you hear me ? It’s me, Dean.» He remained still, holding his hand, careful not to touch the drain.
« What are you talking about? Of course not. As a matter of fact, I’ll die when I’m old and grouchy. But not now. »
« I’ve asked myself many times how I would react if one of the kids told me one day they were … gay »
« And I’m supposed to be the one giving in to their whims » Castiel whispered as he tucked his shirt in.
Because he had lost Lisa, but most of all, because of the hurtful evidence. Perhaps he was about to lose Castiel as well. This simple thought tore his heart apart and he collapsed in his hands, elbows on his knees.
« If you were straight, I’d have dragged you in my bed for a long time and ask you to marry me, while I’m at it... You’re so damn cute »
« I love you too, Dad, I love you a thousand times more » Jewel said, putting her arms around his neck and kissing him.
« You know what ? I’m going to bed. You should go home. We’ll call each other tomorrow, ‘cause right now, I’m exhausted and I don’t understand where you’re getting at... And I don’t even understand how we started this conversation in the first place».
Dean's 19. He's pursuing his dream, but he's already warned his father that he won't take over the family business. He's doing an internship at Frank Deveraux's garage. A lout, paranoid and moody man, but an
Castiel had his back at the kitchens... Ash was sitting in front of him, trying to spot the said waiter.
Dean couldn’t help but laugh. The guy would never change. They actually missed him since he had moved in with Bryan, earlier that year.
« Which one? You mean the one folded and stuck to the wall that you never use? » He peeked at the kitchen door. « That being said, you don’t have that many guests, right? » he poured himself a cup of coffee.
« We had it redecorated two years ago… Bryan supervized the transformation of the attic into guests rooms and tore down the rest to create a large living room space... You need to know that we welcome no more than ten guests at a time in this ranch… It’s currently seasonal break… three weeks without tourists… Except you of course: you are invited guests, it’s not the same » he looked at Jewel who stared at him the whole time.
« All right, it’s settled then… You now need to tell me how much this is gonna cost us » Dean sighed.
Castiel no longer knows what to think or be. As always, he accepts punishment. Hopes it will set him straight.
« Oh that’s really nice... Of course, I’d love to resume our little drunk conversation… with less alcohol.»
Sam knows but says nothing when him, Dean, doesn't know what he really feels. He stifles a disappointed laugh.
"Nothing." Sam looks down, tired of talking in a vacuum." Never mind... That's what we do best " as he walks out of the kitchen.
« Do you have pancakes ? » she asked, resting her chin in the palm of her hand, her elbow leaning on the armrest, which seemed to be a typical posture of hers.
He approached the central aisle… At the base of the wall, a Christ but surprisingly, this one wasn’t crucified… It was a Christ seated to listened to sinners where a man would sit at his feet to confess.
They stayed near the border for a few days, Sam said nothing, he let Dean slowly accept that Castiel was never coming back and that he would have to live with the guilt which would eat away at him and eventually kill him.
"We don't care" Dean replies. "He's perfect like that " He tappes his brother's arm as he passed by his side. "Show us the way instead, Mister
Castiel had taken all the initiatives although never crossing a certain limit… He somehow knew Dean wasn’t totally ready for it yet.
He wasn’t at ease with words and had no idea how to talk about this subject with Castiel. As a matter of fact, he was lying to himself, he knew perfectly well that Castiel would agree to it. He was scared and unable to understand why.
« I know now why he felt in love with you at first sight » she extended a hand. « I’m so pleased to meet you at last»
"We won’t go to a museum every week, don’t worry ... at least you could try to make a little effort " he said taking a bite.
Sometimes he got entangled in all the leashes but he held on until they reached the field in the park reserved for dogs.
He doesn't know how Frank found out, but when he arrives at the workshop this afternoon in January, the man is waiting for him with an apple pie in the middle of the table.
They had left each other as they had found each other ... A look, some unspoken words and that answer that the fallen angel had waited for and that Dean had refused to give it to him.
« Holy mackerel, kids, I missed you so much» he grabbed Chadwick’s shoulder as the boy walked closer.
Castiel found it hard to sleep well. His night was filled with nightmares of past and present days… Him… them… Blaze … Dean… a shadow… a woman…an aching heart… a weird apprehension.
« Dammit ! 7 a.m. This is not my idea of a relaxation week-end » He mumbled as he attached his safety belt.
He then sat by Dean’s side, far enough to respect his personal space which was so precious to him, - except when he was with his kids – yet close enough to feel his warmth.
But he couldn’t cope with it… Despite the pain he felt, despite this pressure which suffocated him with each night, nights which grew shorter in an attempt to avoid the nightmares haunting his slumber… Even haunting his waking hours, persistent hallucinations of what was which he refused to see.
« Wow…Classy ! » the boy claimed when he saw Castiel, dressed in a skin-tight jean and a black sweater that brought out the color of his eyes.
« Balty...No » he said, raising his chin. « Not tonight... All I want right now is to be in your arms» Castiel’s eyes were pleading.
And Dean, pressed against his bedside table, doesn't know what to say. He stares at Castiel, a little haggard, arms outstretched.
To say the sensation was likeable would be a lie. At first, he felt a mixture of panic and nausea. Then, he gradually let Castiel’s moaning guide him and closed his eyes to avoid seeing what he was doing, what he was holding in his hand, between his lips
In face of his brother's silence, he insists: "Go ahead and spit it out," scratching his cheek, lazily.
Tonight, Lisa was coming over for supper... She had slowly begun to take her place among them, despite the fact that the children were keeping their distance and Castiel was often absent when she came over. However, he was never rude to her and Lisa seemed to like him. But that was the extent of their interaction, no more. The feeling was cordial, because that was in their nature and they both loved Dean beyond reason.
"Yes, Dean... We all knew that Kevin was just waiting for one thing, to finish decrypting the tablets and try to get back to a normal life... Just like Charlie, who wanted to move around and discover the world and its mysteries... She wouldn't have stayed, she never did... "
« Well, what about setting the table, huh? The other guests should arrive any time now » Dean proposed, clapping his hands.
Dean crushes his knuckles while playing with his tongue. It's everything Castiel ever dreamed of, It's everything Dean ever feared.
« So… I’m glad we stopped beating around the bush... » she said, biting in her sandwich « ...tell me what happened last night? » she couldn’t help spluttering. « And I want all the details... » she added, indicating she wanted to hear about that kiss of reconciliation.
"Yes, I know that, Cass ... You've already explained this a thousand times in every detail and, even if I have trouble understanding your relationship, I respect it... .But I have the right not to have appreciated his attitude with this Jonas guy tonight "
Dean developed a deep friendship with Castiel, she had even had moments of jealousy over their bond.
He had hesitated a while, than had taken the plunge. He had climbed the stairs and knocked on the door, after waiting for what seemed ages. He had looked at this shaking hands, unable to refrain the shaking. Castiel had opened, dressed with nothing but his jean. He saw the smile on his face before stepping aside to invite him in.
He had two weeks to prepare for the inevitable... Knowing he was attracted to his best friend who happened to be gay was already quite a shock; he now had to summon up the courage that seemed to melt away. The evening phone calls were making things even worse.
" I never judged Charlie for his orientation... Do you really think I could have done it with you? My own brother!", he's getting closer.
« He still needs to learn some manners, but I’m properly equipped » he went on with a large smile, taking the whip from his belt.
Castiel flailed for a little while, trying to regain his balance at the surface. The Winchesters were laughing out loud.
« Now you can watch your crappy old DVDs and your brand new blu-ray disks » she claimed with a big smile.
The crowd was laughing as hard as the parade participants themselves… Angels, elves, goblins and fake deers.
« Which ? The one involving sexual intercourse » she raised the tone of her voice, which Castiel found extremely embarrassing.
" If I wasn’t sure, I wouldn’t be here " He kissed him down his shoulder, feeling both apprehension and desire in his guts.
Jewel had no problem keeping up with the rhythm right from the start ... Dean was mistaken every other step. He swore to himself each time there was a BIIIIIIIIIP when he made a mistake, it made him silently swear to himself.
« Balty, you can skip the details » Dean corrected. « You could have at least talked to me about this before spreading the news. » he went on, unable to hide a slight irritation.
« Pretty cool, huh ? » Garth exclaimed as he joined them... « It was Bryan’s idea… The guy has brains.» he added hitting his temple with his index. « One more reason he’s running the «Black Horse» and not me »
He sighed... Dean... That was ridiculous and hopeless but it had allowed Castiel to take a step he had never dared to cross... He had coped with the loss... His heart had opened again...
« OK, kids, we’ll talk about this later… For now, go pack your things, you’re gonna be late for your dance class »
« I’m aware of that, Cass... But that doesn’t mean you gotta take it with you everywhere you go. » Dean whispered in a sweet voice as he walked closer to Castiel.
" And also, when Castiel came back home " His daughter added, looking for a confirmation in her brother’s eyes.
He looked at his mother and she looked back at him. He smiled with tenderness: for a moment, something special occurred.
Castiel felt uncomfortable hearing Dean keep on using the word “faggot” yet he was touched to hear him defend his family no matter what... Dean had never actually managed to see Castiel as he was, sexually speaking. Even when Balty was there, even when he caught them.
« I’m not mixing in! ‘Told you not to leave them alone » Castiel shouted, safely entrenched in the kitchen.
There were no other sounds aside from this cry of pain which killed all other traces of life in the area… Once it stopped, there was only silence, heavy, weighed, culpable…
Chadwick took his PSP and played a few games with John. Neither Dean nor Castiel knew how to play well… John did.
"Come on, Dean ... It doesn’t matter ... Let’s not spoil the afternoon for so little” Castiel smiled.
« Sorry, but when conversation revolves around sex, I find it exhilarating » she whispered, leaning towards him.
« It’ll only take a few minutes, Dean... Go and take the dog for a walk or else he’ll turn the entrance into Yellowstone Lake » he said, pointing at Apache sitting in front of the door.
« Yeah, and if wishes were horses… ya know » she raised her eyes. « Anyway, the damage is done, sort of »
Dean remained there for a long while, feeling skeptical, in front of what looked like a statue ... A woman with a man's sex ... At least that’s what the label said: " Androginasia ".
« This is where you belong… This will always be your home » Castiel said, lying against him. He slowly raised his hand, wiping it discreetly on the sheets and put it on Dean’s chest.
They sat on the ground, each one leaning against a tree, and remained silent, admiring the landscape in front of them.
Dean was taking his time to get dressed in his bedroom which gave Castiel plenty of time to put on some make up on Jewel’s face.
« You’re right. It didn’t upset me, now, there, you’re happy? Yet it surprised me, in an unpleasant way, I must admit, so I ran away like a coward to avoid a … not to have to… » he was unable to finish his sentence and looked down.
« Apache…Apache... Dad said yes. We are going to sleep in the woods! » she claimed as she rushed out of the kitchen with the dog on her heels.
« I’ll never do anything to make you doubt, Dean. Nothing that a woman wouldn’t do… Do you understand ? » he put a hand on Dean’s cheek.
If he had stared at Dean right now, he would have fallen apart, the pain in his heart was way too sharp.
Dean watched him sip his coffee. Since the aggression, Castiel’s eyes were often out of focus and Dean didn’t like it. He wanted his friend start talking, expressing what he was felt inside, but Castiel was inevitably responding that he was fine. And the more he said it, the more Dean was convinced otherwise.
« I always knew how to pronounce his name… I was just pissing you off » and with one slap, he got Cheyenne moving again.
His tent resembled a swimming pool, but the dog seemed so panicked that Castiel was reluctant to scold him. He petted him instead, took his sleeping bag out to dry in the sun.
« C’mon… Let’s get inside… or we’re gonna catch some nasty cold » he said, heading to the house without a look at the man behind him.
Dean met his gaze and his smile faded to mingle with his. They got lost in their own bubble. He startled when his daughter shook his arm. "Dad .... Dad ....can I be excused? .... I’d like to show my room to Madi"
He smiled as he watched him play with Apache while the kids were dragging their sled up the first slope.
Dean only asked that he avoid divulging the details of his sexual life in front of the kids, even if they did understand the sort of relationship he had with Castiel… For them, it was simple and normal as could be, for Dean, an adult, there was much more to it than that and it could be rather complicated.
« Jo » he tried to call her as she was leaving the kitchen. His voice almost sounded like a cry for help. She stopped but didn’t come back. She knew that Dean wouldn’t talk to her face to face.
He was much more patient than Dean in that respect… He couldn’t quite remember how they had settled into such a strange weekly routine.
Castiel grabbed his wrist and slowly guided him to the next floor. Dean was watching his back as they went upstairs. Then he saw the bed… This bed… His !
« Stay back, Sweetie. » he gently pushed Jewel away and she turned a worried face towards her brother.
« Why do I fear the worst all of a sudden? » he raised his eyes to the ceiling and looked down again.
« You don’t seem to mind talking about Balty for that matter » she replied, crossing her arms, on the defensive.
Please note that you can try to cook the pie the way they did, « Dean version ». The recipe is totally accurate. Just one piece of advice : don’t do as our two experts ; try to get the proportions right, LOL
« No, Sweetie, you’ll be given a smaller one. This one is for Daddy » he gave her a half-smile, as he imagined Dean riding a big horse...
Chadwick joined them, followed by Apache…He pulled out a chair and sat down, grabbed an apple from the fruit basket at the center of the kitchen table.
Castiel had rarely attended a theater play or even a concert; therefore it was an opportunity he was too happy not to miss.
Dean never brought his conquests home… It had been close to a year now that resumed his sexual life but not his love life… He didn’t want to expose his children to the women from his one night stands.
He peeked at his watch… 9.30 AM… He heaved a profound sigh… He needed to clear his mind… He turned to Apache.
In spite of his friends's insistence, Castiel always refused to press charges against his parents. He simply cut all ties with them.
« Give me a hand here, dude » he said as he grabbed his shoulders and dragged him towards the bedhead.
« So what ? Can you imagine the hell I’m going through ? She can’t help putting her hands on me all the time » he made a face.
« That’s a good idea, Dean. I’m sure he would accept. Should be nice. It’s a beautiful day… Let’s sit at a terrace, among friends and have a drink. » Jo insisted.
« If I may, you look younger. Anyway, this doesn’t make you any less stupid, considering your age» she added, licking her lips. « I can’t believe he just kissed you because he didn’t wanna lose you. A simple man embrace would have been more than enough. And I don’t think he wanted to please you after your more-than-explicit declaration of love »
He drove home, went to his room and tried to focus on a pending project, but he couldn’t concentrate.
She had finally told him she loved him. He had felt overwhelmed as well as scared because he was unable to tell her the same… Only Tessa had heard these words from him.
« You’re glowing when you talk about them… I find it touching » she took a sip from her cocktail straw.
"It's...", Dean rubs his neck nervously." It's just that I've never seen things like that. Even though I knew he wasn't really in great shape, I thought it was Cass, you know ? Angel and all the stuff."
She started to laugh and walked away, disappearing in the distance… Dean felt her divine hold fade, freeing him to move.
« That’s why you’re so upset ? You’re jealous of Cass ? » he ran his hand through his hair and laughed.
" It feels weird for me too, actually " he pulled his son and sat him on his lap. The boy didn’t try to escape.
« C’mon… Let’s go inside. I’ll take you to a tour around the house. We’ll take care of your luggage later » he said as Dean had already opened the trunk.
"I... I want to see my... son... I have a gift for him... ", he mumbles, rummaging, clumsy, through his leather jacket pocket. " Get out of my way! First, I'm at... at home here. ", he tries to push Bobby away, in vain.
They enjoyed a hearty breakfast and listened to Garth, more talkative than ever. The children were so fascinated by his babbling...
"And incidentally, also our friend, I'd like to point out," Sam emphasizes with a touch of irritation.
Dean resumed his caresses and kissed the base of his neck and shoulder, completely intoxicated by his fragrance.
Castiel smiled and shook his head... He felt a persistent gaze on him and turned around. Chadwick was staring at him. The latter winked, pointing at his mobile phone.
« I don’t know whether he’ll take the plunge one day, I don’t know the guy and I’m not gay nor bi : therefore I can’t judge this kind of situation... So, maybe he’s unable to love you that way because he’s stuck with physical principles dating back to the Middle Ages – and I’m sure that back then… well, whatever» she pulled a face and resumed «...but I just can’t believe this kiss didn’t mean anything for him… He’s afraid to lose you because he loves you, it’s as simple as that... And this kiss, however chaste it was, came from him, not you... It wasn’t a cry of despair, Castiel, it was a cry from the heart »
“I live with my brother. His name is Sammy, he’s twenty-eight...” He wanted things to be clear from the start.
« Follow me... I’ll show you to your rooms" he said walking in front of them. « One more thing… I hope you don’t mind sharing » he said as he looked at Dean.
They all gathered for breakfast the morning after. The mood was happy, the tension was gone, and they had said what they had to say, nothing more to hide. In the end, nothing seemed to have changed in the view of the children, Now that they had said the words, routine was back again, as if nothing had happened.
For the first time in weeks, there were laughters in the house. Even Castiel couldn’t resist smiling at his lover’s ramblings.
Losing Lisa for one, the ambiguous situation as he felt attracted to a man, his best friend above all, and here he was, diving into tortuous doubts and challenging. He could look for answers leading to denial, but in the end, he would sink into the obvious fact he was refusing to admit... It was a strange mixture of desire and gut aversion.
« Trust me » he finally said as he put down the cup and walked out of the kitchen under his uncle’s worried gaze.
This shirt personified him, in a way… When he’d put it on, he would feel Cass… the one he would find in this piece of cloth which anyone but him would find insignificant ; the shirt of a man he loved but to whom he couldn’t confess.. he cursed himself for being so coward and full of prejudice.
« I’ll go first…. We’ll start easy… Do you trust me ? » he asked, leaning towards her, holding the pommel.
" You’re feeling ill-at-ease.... especially with me " his tone was now soft. " You’re always sure of yourself, the most balanced one between us, at least" he said, rubbing the back of his neck.
They spent the whole afternoon playing a game of « Sorry »; Chadwick won the game, Jewel came last. Dean had let out a thousand sighs during the whole game. Then they played a game of “Chutes and Ladders” ; this time, Dean won the game and exhibited his piece for a while. Chadwick and Jewel sighed, shaking their head. Their father had so rarely won that they let him enjoy his victory for hours.
« Thanks... We spent a fabulous week here! » he pulled Garth towards him and patted him in the back.
"You're never in the mood to talk about your private life, and i'm not talking here about your lustful exploits that you're so quick to share," Sam adds.
Overcome by his sadness, he forgot about Castiel’s who took care of the children with help from Jo, Dean half-sister… A young woman full of life and unending loyalty to her older brother…
But the sacrifice had its reward, outside, not a single angel walked the Earth… Metatron now ruled the heavens, trapped in his kingdom of ice.
"Hey," Dean cuts him off, raising the angel's chin with a fingertip." Give me some time ", with a soft faded smile.
He didn’t know to which part of the quarrel or the discussion Chadwick was referring to yet he couldn’t help but smile...
He hesitates to open it. He finds himself pathetic with his vacuum cleaner and his feather duster under his arm.
Bryan had stepped aside, sipping his beer and petting Apache’s head. He met his lover’s eyes and winked. The latter winked back.
He was angry at himself for feeling a bit of jealousy that wasn’t justified anymore... He had come here to focus on something else and not keep turning over what had been eating him since that last bloody Thursday.
" You’re so cute and your Dean doesn’t know the hell of a luck he has to be blessed with such an angel to watch over him" she smiled with genuine tenderness.
« No.... Jo asked me to come over, we haven’t seen each other in a long while. Did you know she has a new boyfriend ?» Bobby asked, his face now sullen.
" CASS " Dean broke with both feet and fell on the side." CASS...LET GO OF THE ROPE " and he did immediately.
Dean helped Bobby set the table in the living room in front of the fireplace. He had pushed aside the few pieces of furniture for them to have more space as there were no actual dining room at his Uncle’s. They were used to moving the kitchen table in the living room for special occasions.
« Well, to be honest, I’m speechless » Franck confessed, feeling a bit perlexed. « It sounds rather… weird» he scratched his head.
« What am I supposed to do with this ? » he said, showing the tiny spoon. « Even Jewel’s dolls one are bigger » he claimed, swallowing the content of the spoon, as everyone was waiting for his reaction.
« Why am I not surprised ? » she sipped her drink. « Your friendship is rather special, well, at least from what I’ve heard from you »
« I haven’t found a gun under my pillow so, desperate times desperate measures » he was smiling his heart out.
« He deserves someone better than me…I’m not the faithful type, I’m addicted to sex and all the fun with different types of pleasures and partners... I guess that’s me, right ? »
Castiel was working as a computer specialist. Thus, he managed to reorganize his working time and work from home on minor projects... Greg came every other day, or set up video conferences. No matter what, since the aggression, he was feeling guilty.
During breaks, Castiel must stay in his classroom to study his lessons. This was a requirement of Naomi's that the headteacher had complied with, as a fervent churchgoer and faithful parishioner of Pastor Novak's services.
« Well… you’ve done the worst… You met the kids and I’d say it didn’t turn out that bad.» he said, taking a sip of his beer.
« At least, he seems to care for him.... So, it’s their third date in a week, isn’t it ? It’s almost a record » Bryan said with a smile.
In response, Bryan captured Balty’s lips, kissed them greedily, tasting his lover’s smile against his own lips.
« So, as I said before, I’ve been doing a lot of thinking lately and this dance lesson episode brought me to talk to the kids about it all. »
Castiel Novak, Tessa’s best friend, becoming by happenstance, his. No… He smiled… By faith… By choice…
" You know, Dad, even if it feels weird to see you with a… man, I know I’ll get used to it, because it’s him. It’s just that… you’re my father " the boy said, twisting his father’s shirt, the way he did when he was little.
Dean was trying to hold the head of the deer still as Castiel did the best he could to free the antlers stuck in the knot. The deer struggled, threatening to collapse the tent.
« It was only him and it will always be him and only him. You were the man of one woman. You’ll be the man of one man» Balty went on.
« Dean, would you stop doing this, please ?» Castiel’s tone was filled with anger as he was staring at the wall in front of him.
« Cass, the kids love you. Besides, you’re their new God; thanks to you, they’re gonna have a dog. »
« For real? » Chadwick couldn’t contain his joy. « Great! » He jumped from his seat and rushed into his father’s arms who just sit there, speechless. He hadn’t expected such enthusiasm from his kid and it moved him more than he had thought possible.
Right from the start, Dean waved his arms to keep his balance but refused to let go. Mark put his horse right after him.
« I rode a little when I was a kid and then… » He sighed. « I attended a riding school close to Lake Placid for two years »
“Or you hope he has left, more like! If you want to know what has just happened to you, then find him and follow your instinct.”
« We’ll leave the crib until Epiphany... You’ll have enough time to place Baby Jesus, ok ? » he gently stroked her cheek.
Dean spent all morning at the garage, dealing with administrative paperwork. He hated this but somehow he had to take care of it as his accountant was to visit him at the end of the week and everything had to be clean.
Chadwick stretched his lips in a big smile. Dean popped the bottle cork and the sound startled the dog that hit his head under the table.
The main door opened and Chadwick interrupted the kiss. Dean looked at him, a bit troubled, yet his son only had eyes for Castiel.
Castiel had never done anything similar in his youth, only vicariously, as his own parents considered this tradition a pagan one, thus forbidden in their house.
«So that it doesn’t stick to the bottom… I saw this in a TV program » he said as he tried to brush away the dough stuck on his fingers.
It took several weeks for him to recover from his injuries, his father beat him violently. when his son confessed his homosexuality.
The silences and unspoken words, the understatements and the smiles hidden in their written words, were leaving no doubts whatsoever. And if Castiel had opened up his heart, Dean started to cogitate again.
Castiel laughed as he pulled his mobile from his pocket. They exchanged their numbers and promised to meet again.
Cass had promised he wouldn’t ever tell him he loved him again, yet this was the most beautiful love declaration of all.
"Go back to your friends, kid," he says, taking John with him as he jabbered inaudible words. "They're waiting for you to open them," pointing the coffee table in the living room full of presents.
« I believe Castiel isn’t the only one who needs to talk... » He looked at Chadwick who was playing with Apache.
They ordered pizzas as Dean was too tired after a hard week’s work and wanted to keep meals preparation as simple as possible.
" That he loved you?", Sam repeats, eyes to eyes. "Yes, Dean... Every choice he makes, every gesture, every look he makes at you... Man, really ? ", kindly.
Dean took too long to vanquish Hell. Crowley had become too human, too weak now to pretend to lead them.
« Empty your mind… Let me take care of you. » his fingers softly running down his bare chest, making his skin shiver all over. He tenderly kissed his lips while unbuckling his belt. Dean tensed up when he felt Castiel’s fingers.
« Dammit ! I don’t believe this » he put his forearm on his eyes and let out a long sigh out of spite. He couldn’t get back to sleep after that.
" Yes, Dean... That's the crux of the problem and I strongly advice you to care of that if you don't want me to do it myself."
« You still got plenty of time. She’ll give birth at the end of the week and you’ll have to wait until the babies are weaned for another two months. »
« Jewel told me that I couldn’t attend the dance festival next Sunday. Is that correct? » He was trying to be polite but somehow there was a trace of anger in his voice.
« He will never love you. Do you hear me? NEVER. He doesn’t give a damn about you, you’re nothing but his best friend, the one who takes care of his kids. He’s got Lisa now. It’s only a matter of time before she moves in one day. And on that day, you’ll be sorry »
Dean applied to several junior colleges in Kansas. He wants to take up the family business and specialize in vintage cars, a more lucrative market, but above all a real challenge for him.
Dean raised his sack as he looked pitifully at Castiel who was already set in his own. Chadwick and Jewel were standing between them...
" This ain’t funny, Cass " he clenched his fists. He felt Castiel come closer and cling to him. He felt a sudden shiver and cursed himself for it.
Nevertheless, Dean allowed to be himself again for the last few months, to live with more intensity. He still thought of his wife but life had taken over.
He was his father’s son all right, Jo thought as she watched him taking care of the little girl. He wouldn’t say anything but she has observed his expression when she had asked Jewel; the answer was painted on his face. The children were well aware, way before their father.
That revelation brought a smile on his face ; realizing that absence was painful, that being with him was good, that nobody else but him was important.
Sam opens the door, he needs fresh air. That of the bunker is flawed. The evil has been overcome but the monsters remain ... A hunt yes but ...
After Tessa’s death, he had long thought all would come to a stop, but he’d been wrong, the proof was right there in front of him. It’d just taken him three years to realize it. She’d been right, destiny was always putting you back on the right track, you just had to accept it and acknowledge a helping hand.
There was a bit of cowardice trying to overcome the will to dare and start an adventure with this man who had brushed away all his principles like nothing.
« Don’t tell me you wanna go to the city parade? The one with the ugliest Santa of all times! » He frowned.
« You’ll manage, don’t worry...C’mon, or Bobby will go hysterical» she put her arm around his waist and dragged him along.
« Don’t get on your high horse, ok ? This had nothing to do and please, let me finish. It’s already complicated enough as it is and I sure don’t need you to interfere as always.» Dean was a bit irritated.
Castiel is his only exception. Anyway, since the notion was completely abstract to his friend, Dean didn't really have a choice.
They were all smiling. Back then, nothing had prepared them for what was about to happen. It was the time of ephemeral happiness.
"Not sleepy", placing the empty beer on the table before letting his fingers slide over the manuscript.
Chadwick was holding his hand, in silence, avoiding to look at him… only staring at their hands joined together.
They spend the rest of the evening, drinking coffee. At some point, Dean stood up. Time to tuck up his kids.
« Bloody dog !... I’m gonna kill him » he said, raising on his knees, spitting the snow that had filled his mouth.
Castiel is there, bedhair, bundled up in a black suit, an immaculate white shirt and his waxed leather shoes ... and his tie ...
Leaning on the cooker, with Castiel by his side, he watched the children sorting and devoring the treats, fighting over them in a gentle way.
« Let’s stick together, so we won’t lose one another. So, no window-shopping without warning the others, is that clear ? »
"And may I ask what is the reason for your sudden renewed interest in the cherub ? " Dean looks casual sinking into his chair.
" It’s OK if it’s a man, you know " he walked closer to his father. " It’s just that… it feels weird"
Leaning on the sink, he was talking about this and that, for a longer while than usual, because he was missing his voice, his laughers and the smiles he could perceive behind the words.
“Oh shit.” He threw himself on Castiel, squeezed him tightly in his arms, wanting to melt in him. “It isn’t a dream, I’m begging you… Tell me it isn’t a dream.”
The angel smiles and this smile breaks the hunter's heart because it lights up the impossible blue of this fucking eyes.
They had sat at the bar in the back of the conference room… And, as always, the conversation had diverted on his ordinary family… Madison, leaning on the counter, head resting on her palm, was all ears… while staring at Castiel’s eyes which she found extraordinary and more expressful than his words. She was all smiles.
« I can guarantee you this : your kids don’t love me, they never will. And they’ll never love Zeke. You know why, Dean? » she asked in a bitter tone.
She had called and left several messages on his voice mail. Nevertheless, as she hadn’t got any response by Thursday, she decided to go to his place uninvited.
You could say the he had a lot to keep him busy… She had left him two beautiful children. A girl, Jewel, now 6 years old and a boy, Chadwick who was nearing 10… The treasures of his life… For them, he had endured, for them, he had survived, for them, he had gotten through it.
« It’s an interactive robot dog I offered her for Christmas» Dean explained, looking at the ceiling.
Castiel wasn’t very fond of this kind of music in general, probably an inheritance from his narrow education. Yet he had started to adapt to modern music, thanks to the kids who made him discover a brand new world, beyond classical music or country ballads. Even if, most of the time, he didn’t really comprehend it all.
« Dunno.... I feel like a kid again in here and I don’t give a damn » He disappeared in the back shop.
They talked about this and that for a long while. He smiled after Dean had almost hung up on him, looking at the phone, but he was happy. Words are magical; they can kill you but they can also restore life.
“Everything’s always ok with my Sammy... It’s about you I’m worrying right now... You look knackered... You won’t be able to keep going much longer at that rate...”
« Oh, yeah, great. We now need to find all what’s necessary. I don’t know what kind of equipment we’re gonna need» he said, feeling nervous and rubbing his cheek.
“The scent of death… You still smell it… It chases you… It will always be there… You abandoned him?”
Dean put Jewel back on her feet next to Castiel who granted the girl a gentle smile as he shuffled through her hair.
« What Dean ?... To know that I love you, is that it? » his eyes were shining. « Anyway, it won’t make any difference in your life or in mine, right ? »
He paused for a little while: words were not his strongest point, especially on an occasion like this one.
"Shut up," John stops him. "I owe you an apology... I was selfish and unworthy of the admiration I saw in your eyes... I never told you this, but I was proud of you then and I'm proud of you now. "...as John laid his hand on his cheek's son. "You have become a good man despite my mistakes, and that's only because of you...and thanks to them too", he adds, offering them a smile of gratitude to which they all respond. "Your mother would be so proud of you, son," he whispers with tears in his eyes. "And so mad at me, ", he inspires to give himself courage."I've denied the best part of you... I made you believe,i don't even know how, that you don't deserve to be happy... That only your brother and i mattered to you... And you sacrificed everything for us because of this stupid idea that only your family matters... An old man I know once told me that family is more than just blood. "
He smiled and left a message to Dean to tell him he’d pick up the kids on his way home, after some shopping.
« I can’t see what it is » Dean said, slumping back in the couch, one hand on the head rest and the other on the armrest.
Castiel's almost 13. Although socially awkward, he's made a place for himself among Dean's friends. It's a tighter circle than it was in elementary school, but their loyalty is unfailing. At least with regard to these young teenagers who are still looking for a place in the adult world.
« As a matter of fact, I wanted to tell you about it… » He sat down and tried to make eye contact with Castiel but the latter was putting butter on a toast and focusing on this task and nothing else.
Dean introduced him to Madison, Jared and Bryan. Bobby took Balty in his arms in a strong male embrace, a way to show he meant a lot without showing too much.
« In February » Dean stated. « Sometimes, I feel like it was yesterday or long ago, as if I had lost track of time » he went one.
« This means they accept us for who we are » he walked away then turned around. « And you, Dean, do you accept it as well? » his hand on the door frame, with a hard expression on his face.
He rested on his heels, facing the nudity of his lover, with a hand on the warm and comforting skin of his lower abdomen, feeling his erratic breathing under his fingers. He didn’t dare look at him.
Dean was aware it had been there before but since that special night, it had become more tangible and he felt unable to face it.
He was sitting there, with his hands joined on the table, totally lost. He didn’t even have the strength to cry or shout… His heart was numb.
" Why not ? I wouldn’t mind " he stood up, exposing his bare buttocks to Dean who suddenly stared at the ceiling.
They went on pickering just like they had before at lunch… None would deny it, it was the only way for them to avoid talking about the physical tension that was slowly growing between them...
Dean let go of his son and smiled. Castiel came closer ; Jewel sat on the bed. She was dressed in a white shirt and blue sweater. She was swinging her feet, admiring her fringe boots.
After five years of living together, they had split up… He had taken the road back to his home town after his father’s death… Father who had, since he had come out, refused to see him, to talk to him, or even to write him…
Castiel felt it would be wise to take it to his place, to avoid Dean finding it. They opened all the windows and the back door to ventilate the house.
« Why are you being so aggressive ? » Balty pretended to be offended. “ I just wanted to offer you the opportunity to have the time of your life… to help you… » He sighed
He was speaking openly about his children and his family, the same way he was mentioning Balty and his work. Yet when the conversation came to Castiel – and it often did – the tone in his voice was changing… as well as his attitude. He seemed more nervous, less self-assured.
Jewel felt very proud and walked carefully to the fridge. Castiel opened the door for her and she put the mold between the mix salad and the jar of mayonnaise.
« Is this pie? And nobody invited me? » He complained with a fake outraged expression, ruffling through his son’s hair.
« Don’t mention it… Just put on a bit of perfume to mask the mothballs smell and that should do it » Dean laughed.
« Mom didn’t want to go away either » Chadwick said, staring at his father with such a cold expression on his face that Dean felt a chill down his spine.
"Dean," Castiel started, watching around him ... Dean had raised the tone of his voice without realizing it.
« Dean... Why don’t we first go to the ranch… You’ll have plenty of time to admire them later » Castiel said. He hadn’t said much since the day before.
The kids were too, especially when their father or Castiel were picking them up at school with Apache who was the main attraction. 6 months old and he was already quite something!
His band doesn't care that Dean doesn't want to celebrate his birthday. They made him promise to be at the Roadhouse at 8 p.m.
His wounds are still bleeding and Dean bites his lip, thinking that all this is probably the result of his weakening grace. Perhaps it is also the repercussion of his somewhat clumsy statement that seems to have paralyzed the angel.
« We’ll walk Apache for a little while and then we’re treat ourselves with an ice cream at the Park. Then we’ll come back and go on with our little poem? How’s that sound? »
« Sure » Castiel whispered and let himself down on the couch as Dean looked at him and felt bit sorry for him meanwhile Bobby was squinting his eyes at Dean who shrugged his shoulders as if to say:
He was afraid of feeling a similar pain in his heart to the one he felt when he crossed her eyes… Jo was right; Tessa wouldn’t have wanted to be the only love in his life… He was in love with a man, so what?
He gave Castiel a quick kiss on the cheek as he always did. Like his father. Soon enough, he would simply nod to salute him.
"Come ... Put it there," Dean indicates the small console at the entrance. "We'll open them when my father arrives. ", grabbing his friend by the sleeve of his trench coat.
For the first time since that particular Thursday, Dean dreamed of the kiss between him and Castiel, but, unlike what had actually happened, what he dreamed of wasn’t chaste at all anymore.
It took just one second. Yet for Castiel it seemed like an eternity... Dean slowly moved away and opened his eyes.
At the lack of the reaction, Dean ends up raising his head. A rustle of a wing, Castiel has disappeared and the emptiness that Dean feels at this very moment is infinite ...
He lowered his head and let it rest on Dean’s shoulder. He tightened his embrace, leaning on the tree behind him. No more personal space.
« You... » Dean let go of his wrist. Castiel’s heart skipped a beat. « I care about you, Cass, a lot. I don’t have a gift for words but.. I wanted you to know this... »
Chadwick and Jewel were already at the table when Dean joined them in the kitchen. One kid was feeding Apache while the other one was setting the table.
Dean put on a pair of jeans and a T-shirt... Just before getting out of his room, he looked at himself in the wardrobe’s mirror, thinking of what had happened the day before and which hadn’t left his mind.
« Tessa my beloved… I need you right now… Please help… I’m lost… completely lost… everything was so simple when you were there… I miss you » he pressed his forehead against the fridge.
He was carving the chicken when he heard the mixed sounds of their voices come nearer as they came in the kitchen. He put down the knife and wiped his hands, without taking the first step.
The crowd eventually dispersed ... Dean searched in vain for the one who’d insulted them... But he was gone.
He wanted Castiel to let go of the remaining obstacles… regain full control of his life as it was before the aggression… What better way than to face what had put an end to five years of a relationship that never really existed?
There was no hot kiss… Just an old Math teacher, languishingly leaning against a blackboard… Dean started to laugh in his sleep...
Castiel came back at that exact moment. He remained frozen, with his mouth open, unable to ask Dean where he had put the bottle of red wine.
Dean refused to look up, though, feeling ashamed, embarrassed, and most of all scared... He was afraid of the judgment, the end, an end to their relationship.
« Oh no, you ain’t gonna wear that old piece of rags, are you ? » he looked offended, put down his pizza, cleaned his hands on a napkin and stood up.
“Then my boy... Welcome to your new reality... You’re gay now... And you’re gonna be a good boy and move your ass, and go back there.”
The six of them took place at the table the restaurant owner had shown them at the back of the room. He gave them menus and suggested the plat du jour.
Castiel ends up playing in turn at the Pyramid of cans, encouraged to do by the brothers. He pulverizes all them and receives a bottle of wine which he looks doubtful.
Chadwick was pointing at trendy shops ... They went on in a noisy atmosphere, a mixture of very loud background music and endless hubbub.
« There’s nothing to say, Dean. It happened then years ago… It belongs in the past now. I got over it all, but Blaze… She… she’s the only thing I truly regret »
« Don’t get me wrong, Cass… But as far as I can tell, this man wasn’t behaving like a father. How can one deny his own flesh, his own blood ? I can’t figure it out.»
Castiel could have said something back but, considering the attitude of the man standing in front of him, he thought it would be wiser to remain silent. He had said too much already.
A Castiel who was shouting through this kiss, made it more intense, forcing his teeth and tongue without tenderness. Dean searched under his shirt and touched his skin, he felt Castiel shiver before he pulled away and dropped his forehead in his neck. Dean let him recover and gently squeezed him against him.
His hand travelled up and brushed the other’s hair. He kissed him again, but this time, with more passion and desire. He pushed Castiel towards the armchair; he lost his balance and ended up sitting with a laughter.
« Few of our men sleep here… Many use this place as a refuge in case of dispute or when they get plastered.»
He looked at his reflection in the mirror, wearing a simple short, and imagined Castiel’s silhouette looking back at him.
He stopped short at the living room. There he was, sitting on the couch, Jewel cuddling against him and Chadwick sitting across the coffee table.
Castiel remained still for a moment. Jo walked towards him and hugged him. But it didn’t make him feel more comfortable.
« Because he’s labelled as hetero, is that it ? » she looked at him, her eyes filled with lots of tenderness.
He had no more fights, walls or excuses behind hide his fear. Just a bunker, a brother and a few bottles of whiskey
After classes, he was going out with him and Jewel to walk Apache and about ten other dogs. Jewel was leading the Old Grey, an almost centenarian poodle, and Patch, a young yorkshire.
« Would you happen to have a model with a side opening? » . Dean’s face was all red with shame and anger. The seller was smiling.
In the meantime, Dean trotted throughout the paddock, his boots scraping on the ground..... He took off his hat and hit the back of the animal to make it trot faster.
Chadwick climbed on the bed and cuddled against his father who put an arm around his shoulders and kissing him on the forehead.
He felt Castiel slowly getting back on his feet and when he took his lips, he felt his own taste in the other’s mouth.
« No... That must be Zeke » he replied in a tone which made her understand Dean didn’t appreciate the visitor.
« It always freaks you out a little the very first time » he said with a smile, resting his hands on Deans knees.
They had spent a week-end in the open, just the three of them. Jewel had remained with Jo as she was too young at the time.
« Oh I’m sorry. Only Mr. Winchester has got the right to call you that, I forgot » he swore bitterly.
« He told me he didn’t love him… that it was purely physical… I bursted out… The next day, he… »There was a sudden flame in his eyes. « He sold Blaze »
« Jewel... Go and tell Cass we’re gonna eat soon... He’s probably lost in his programming stuff again » he said to Lisa, pretending to look more comfortable than he actually was.
« If anyone had told me something like this would fall on my lap, I’d have laughed. I was married, happy. I got two wonderful children with the most extraordinary woman and then everything tumbles down on me and I end up in the arms of a man… My best friend, one of the pillars of my family, a genuine part of my past. This is completely crazy, it scares me» he rubbed the top of his head.
« You’re welcome, son » he finally said, hugging him tight, closing his eyes, tenderly patting him on the back.
She had opened her door, even if she had never shown any compassion regarding his sorrow. According to her, it was a punishment from God.
« No.... I’m all right… Don’t worry » Dean grabbed the bowl, indicating he didn’t want her assistance.
« What? » he looked horrified. « Are you mad? Besides, I AM NOT GAY » he claimed, hiding his face in his hands.
« Tell who ? The future ex-official boyfriend or the future ex-unofficial one ? » he started to laugh alone.
« What? Did he forget to wipe his feet again? » Dean stated, winking at Bobby, probably the author of the crime.
