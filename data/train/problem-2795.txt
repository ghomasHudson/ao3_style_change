“For Chuck.”
“God is never wrong. Everything he does is for a reason. The right reason.”
“Okay,” they almost whisper. Their tone is similar to a parent whose baby has kept them up for a week.
“That would be great Jack.”
“Plan?”
“I have hurt Dean. And I’ve hurt a lot of other people too,” he turns to look at Dean. “But, like you, I’ve also been able to help a lot of people. And even though I can’t anymore, I-,”
“Jack, what the hell happened?” Cass stands. “No one but us even knew that he was here. And he’s human. Why would anyone want him?”
“Oh yes, I heard that that’s what you think. But what you don’t understand is that that is kind of what I hoped would happen.”
“And it’s going to stay that way, demon spawn.”
Gabe nods, “deal.”
“I will. I’m Dr. Lynn,” She hands him her card. “I will be your physical therapist for the next few weeks. Just come two times per week for five weeks and you should be fully back to normal. When you get the chance, call the number on the card and schedule your appointments.”
Jack collapses in front of Dean, sobbing over the loss of his father, the only person who has always believed in him.
“Probably because it’s already warded against demons and monsters.”
“But does that mean he will be healed or die?”
“What would they even plot? There’s nothing they can do now that they’re human,” Eileen says.
“And we chose these people, that’s why they’re our family. The ones we lost, Bobby, Charlie, Kevin, Jo, Ellen, Rufus, Crowley, Rowena, Benny, Adam, Meg, Pamala, Jessica. And the ones we still have, Cass, Eileen, Jack, Jodi, Donna, Claire, Alex, Patience, Kaia, Jesse, Garth, even Gabe and Balthazar… I mean we’re Team Free Will 3.0.”
“Does that mean he could get my Fergus out?”
The wedding is set up in a beautiful field full of wildflowers and tall green grass. The seats are all made of natural wood and the arches are crafted from tree branches and decorated with colorful flowers.
“You were already trained and almost better than me. You didn’t need me, I needed you. To stand by my side and stand up against our father. I trusted you to follow me, to fight alongside me. But I guess you didn’t want that.”
They approach their childhood home and the door flies open“Dean! Sam!”
“Cool, can I get a slice of cherry pie from that place in Indiana I like?”
Everyone begins to make their way out of the silo. Everyone chattering in relief that the battle is over. People share hugs as they file into their individual cars and drive away. Donna stays behind with Sam and Eileen. “Let me know the second that Dean gets back. I’ve never met Cass but I can tell by the way that Dean talks about him that he’s pretty special to him. And Dean deserves that specialness in his life.”
They are all sitting in Bobby’s house, Mary and John came to wait with them.
“Okay,” Dean defends himself, “I’m sorry for not fully thinking things through when my possessed car was about to run us over. Hey, at least I didn’t cry about losing my shoe.”
“No. He was just being the giant douche that he always is. Said that he didn’t actually lose, tried to mess with our heads, the normal bullshit.”
“Ok now that you’re filled in, can you tell us who locked you up and what exactly they had you do.”
“Ya, it’ll give me a chance to get to know him better. You just be careful.”
“She is locked up and I have some of my most trusted guarding her cell and questioning her about Chuck.”
“Ahh yes. I did not expect to find my Aunt in here but-,” they shrug.
“Now that’s just cruel.”
“No. That’s why I never left Heaven to go see him. I thought he was disgusted by me.”
“Jo,” Dean says sadly.
“Congrats Bob,” Sam stands and pats Dean on the back. “Let’s get ya home.”
Dean takes the paper from Jack. “Anyone up for a road trip?”
“We’ll make sure Kelly is safe, Jack,” Cass says. “I promise.”
“There are some humans on Earth that will be helping but everyone here will not be joining us. They have no bodies to return to Earth to.”
“What are you talking about?”
“Hm.”
“Happy New Year Dean.”
“We figured that out too.”
“Hi, Father Jackson. I’m doing well. You?”
~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~
“One moment,” she clicks the mouse on her computer a few times. “Ah yes. Umm, did he tell you what he was in for?”
“Three of you cannot possess one body, it’s not safe.”
Jesse shakes his hand awkwardly. “Jesse.”
“Ya think that’s bad. Say hello to God. Capitol “G”.”
“I’m not saying put the mark back on me, I don’t even think that would be possible being dead and all but, the cage wasn’t destroyed or anything, just opened. If we can figure out how to open it on Earth, then maybe all of you guys,” Dean gestures at Cass, Jack, and Gabe, “can help Amara get them both in there, and then we can lock it behind ‘em.”
“Well you were a lot like I was. I guess we both proved everyone wrong.” They shake hands. “I hope you find your parents Jesse.”
~~~~~~~~~~
“Shut up.” He grabs Dean’s face and pulls him in for a kiss.
“All four of you?”
“This is Gabriel and Balthazar,” Sam says. “They’re some of the few angels that we don’t entirely hate.”
“You need to wake up, Dean,” Lisa says forcefully.
“Why?”
“Eileen.” Sam sighs and says. “I have loved you from the moment you tried to kill me. Then you saved my brother’s life and I loved you even more. You are by far the most beautiful, wonderful, and most badass human being that I have ever had the privilege to know. You make me laugh more than anyone ever has and you are always there to let me cry on your shoulder. Not only are you my soulmate, but you are my best friend and there is no one I would rather spend eternity with than you. You have given me a son and an ever-expanding family. And for that, I will be eternally grateful. I love you.”
“I’m not God, I just absorbed his power.”
Team Free Will 3.0 takes a hit
“So everyone’s okay?” Cass asks.
“Ya ya ya, can I at least shoot him now?”
“Ummm, no. It was more of the classic ‘life flashes before your eyes’ trope. Why d’ya ask?”
Gabe groans before nodding, “deal.”
“Ya pretty much,” Cass says.
They hear a noise coming from inside the house and turn to see Miracle jump through the doggy door. “Hey boy!” Sam gasps and gets down to pet him. Miracle had lived with him and Eileen for about 10 years until he died in his sleep. “Dean is going to be so excited to see you!”
“Hopefully about to be better. I’m Dean, this is my brother Sam and his wife Eileen and this is Jack.” He gestures over at the couch.
“Dean, Cass is-.”
“If he’s anything like you two, he’s going to be fine,” Bobby says.
~~~~~~~~~~
“And I can’t believe that you of all people are getting married. Never thought this day would come.”
“No problem.”
“I love you, Cass. I’ve always loved you.”
Jack stands in front of Dean and his family in the bunker.
He hands them a piece of paper with a phone number on it. “I need to talk to you. I get off in about an hour.”
“I can’t believe that, even in Heaven, you guys still have to go through this shit,” Charlie says to break the tension.
~~~~~~~~~~
“Charlie,” Dean says. “You’re the best.”
“Dean!” Comes a familiar voice from behind him. “Wow! Long time no see!"
“I know. But he does. So we need to do everything we can to help him, even if it’s not enough.”
“Why?” Jack asks.
“God Sammy, you really are corny.”
“Both.” Cass nods at the guard stationed at the top of the staircase and leads Dean down them, stopping Dean in front of the doorway at the bottom. “Dean you have to promise me that you’re not going to let Chuck get under your skin. You can’t touch him or get too close to him.”
Martin’s face gets darker. “How dare you.” He raises his knife up, about to stab Micah. Eileen takes advantage of his movement to take a well-aimed shot. The bullet hits him in the shoulder, forcing him to drop the knife and stumble to the side, away from Micah.
Sam smiles. “Okay, let’s get this thing set up.”
TFW 3.0 celebrate New Year's
“Well, that would just be boring.”
“Party doesn’t have to end at midnight, old man.”
“I know.”
~~~~~~~~~~
“My husband’s Eric Sanders- Leahy and my daughter’s Cassandra Sanders- Leahy.”
Eileen and Sam rush forward to the kids. “Is everyone okay?” Sam asks.
“Fuck.” Dean collapses into the chair next to Cass, guilt washing over him. “That wasn’t his fault, he didn’t have a soul.”
“Thank you,” Dean smiles.
“Then no deal.”
Atara reluctantly reaches into her pocket and takes out a key. “You will still lose. God will return to his rightful place on the throne of Heaven.”
“Anything Rowena, please…”
“Ya, no shit Gabe.”
“Okay,” Dean says hesitantly.
Jack smiles bashfully. “Chuck has died after becoming human and we didn’t exactly plan for where to put him when he did. We were hoping to lock him in the cage. With your permission of course.”
“No, they are in another part of Heaven.”
“Cassiel, please,” Jack says. “He’s dangerous and needs to be taken care of.”
“Thank you for everything, Jack. And that included saving the world and stuff.”
“No idea,” Jesse responds. “But there’s no one for miles around their location so no humans should get hurt and there are no wardings on the house so we shouldn’t have any problems getting close.
“You don’t have to do this Lucifer,” he says as he walks over to his favorite son, kneeling over him. “You can join me once again.”
“Do you have Martin’s address?” Eileen asks, handing her a silver pen and a notepad.
At this point, Alex is the only one without a partner so Jody and Donna grab her and pull her into their slow dance.
“Why Texas?”
~~~~~~~~~~
Sam and Eileen are sitting together at the table in the bunker when Dean and Cass suddenly appear at the top of the stairs, hand in hand.
“Wow. Why didn’t he ever come find us on Earth?”
“Whatever. It was like 15 years ago.”
Jack steps back and releases her from the wall.
“Or he just wanted to get as many of the angels who received his power killed as possible so all he needed to do was sit back and absorb the power,” Gabe adds.
“Ok Death you don’t know me yet but I’m Dean and in the future we’re pals. I know you love pizza and pie and all the food that you would find at a fair. I know that you aren’t a bad guy and you are actually reasonable even though you get a bad rep. I know you are about to give that ring of yours to younger me in order to stop Lucifer. And you can still do that but right now I need that ring to save my best friend and tell him something pretty damn important. I’ll bring it right back and you won’t even notice it’s missing in this timeline, I promise.”
“Me too,” Jesse responds.
“So, dungeon?”
“Full retirement or just from hunting?”
“Yes but smaller. It just looked like mine with some carvings on it.”
“Somewhere safe.”
“Sorry but I think I need to go home. Once everyone is back on Earth I’m gonna find my parents, set things right with them. It’s time I stop hiding.”
“I dunno, maybe she’s trying to take over control of his body or something. To get him to separate with her again.”
~~~~~~~~~~
“You better fucking stay stubborn, Cass. You can’t let this be the end,” Dean whispers in Cass’ ear as they hold onto each other, knowing that no matter what they say, it very likely could be.
~~~~~~~~~~
Dean spins around and immediately tackles Cass. “Don’t you ever fucking scare me like that again.”
“Well don’t tell me Dean. Tell Castiel.”
“Jack,” Sam turns and pulls him in for a bear hug, “I’m so proud of you.”
“Bitch.”
“I’m not God. I observed his power, but I’m not him. If I was I could save her with a snap of my fingers. I can’t write a story and just make it real. I’m not omniscient or omnipotent or any of the things he was.”
“They’re in the room next to ours. Security camera’s right outside so no one's getting near without being on film. I also set up an alarm that will go off if anyone opens the door from the outside.”
“I didn’t think you wanted to see me. That it would be too awkward for you for me to come back. I was just trying to do what you would want.”
——————————————————
“If not, we can get someone on Earth to break them so you can get in.”
~~~~~~~~~~
“I guess. Ok, Dean. Let's go.”
They all sit in awkward silence for a minute. Looking around at everyone in the room. Dean and Sam lock eyes and suddenly start laughing at the same time. Everyone else looks at them confused and Jack stops his search to stare at Sam and Dean. Cass and Eileen try to keep a straight face but they can’t help but start laughing too, understanding where they are coming from which only makes Sam and Dean laugh harder.
“You’re both officially Winchesters whether you like it or not.” Dean adds.
“Well as soon as you know everyone is good, get your asses back here so we can celebrate New Years',” Dean says jokingly serious.
“I hate him more and more every second.”
~~~~~~~~~~
“Ya,” Dean says chuckling. “We have a lot to fill you in on.”
“Not my fault you got killed by a freaking nail in the wall.”
“Well um, I was born in Ireland but after my parents were killed by a banshee I was taken in by a hunter named Lillian O'Grady, and we kind of traveled around until I was 16 and she died of cancer. After that, I kept hunting banshees on my own for a while. Then I met Sam and Dean on a hunt. I tried to kill Sam but eventually, I started to like him.”
“No.”
“No.” They turn back to the group.
“Hey,” Sam says standing up. “Where’d you guys go?”
“No don’t worry he’s alive. Eileen’s here though.”
“Ok good,” Sam says. “How do you do that?”
“Reaper.”
“Shit,” Sam sighs. “That’s rough.”
“I didn’t agree with them. I loved humanity. I tried to get them to see the beauty in it but they couldn’t. All they saw were the flaws. Obviously, they were furious with me and thought I betrayed them. They reached out to God and tried to come back to Heaven but, the damage had been done. They even tried calling out to me for decades but, I never responded. I knew they still couldn’t see what I saw, no matter what they said. They stopped after a while and I thought they had been killed or, you know.”
“Sure. He’s been out for about an hour now.”
“Jack? Are you healing or is it getting worse?” Cass asks.
“I’ll get back to research.” Bobby groans.
“Well, hopefully, I’m human enough to be able to get past the wardings.”
“We’re not actually buying into this are we?” Sam whispers.
Dean’s phone rang one last time then it was silent but Dean didn’t really notice. He had no idea how long he sat there for, it could have been days and he wouldn’t have even cared or noticed. He was too entrenched in his own thoughts and guilt to have any sense of time.
“They deserve that. When I first saw them together I thought they were a couple but no one ever mentioned it so I thought I was just reading into things.”
“I don’t know any songs.”
“I’m sure they’re fine, Dean,” Mary says.
“I didn’t know that.”
“I’m not going to let anything bad happen Dean. We won before, we’re not going loose now” Jack says.
Dean looks down at his feet nervously, about to say something he has never said to a person and actually meant it before. “I love you, Cass, but it’s more than that. I’m in love with you. I have been for years. But I’m a coward and was terrified of how I felt because of how I was raised and how my dad felt about…this. And I didn’t want to wake up because I knew that there was no one else that could make me feel the way I feel about you. Basically, if I couldn’t be with you, I didn’t want to be with anyone.” Dean looks up at Cass, whose face was representative of a large mix of emotions. He moves closer to Dean and pulls him in for a hug.
“Then why leave the Winchesters? They are more flawed than most. Impulsive, violent, defiant.”
“De- Death brought her back to life just so they can use her as leverage. They um… the witch who wrote the book of the damned put a spell on her. If I don’t do what they say it’s going to torture her an- and they took Hell, they have Rowena.”
“I think so,” Sam says in awe, looking over at Dean who is staring off into space, his mind elsewhere. Like he didn’t even notice the 7.1 magnitude Earthquake that just shook heaven. “Dean?”
"Cause your freezing,"
Sam and Baal shared a look as Abel glanced back at Chamuel. Feeling a thorn in his heart as he noticed how close Cain had gotten to the blonde.
"Shut up, I didn't say that," Sam replied, clearing his throat.
Danjal helped a few people set up gates as the morning went on, he enjoyed chatting with a few of them before getting himself something to eat. The innocent around him were growing in numbers as the day moved towards the afternoon, the first event was going to start soon and Danjal wasn't sure where Robin even was. He silently debated on getting the man something to eat as he made for the food trucks, this thought died down as he watched Robin and Gretchen sitting at a table with half eaten food. She was waving her arms in the air dramatically, Robin watching with his elbow on the table and his cheek rested against his open palm. He eyed the two for a few heartbeats, his heart felt heavy and he couldn't place why as a soft note of jealousy flooded his system.
"Hahasiah, calm down," Bailey said, holding up a hand,
His eyes flickered open a half hour later, he had dozed off but Robin wasn't back. The lionheart felt something was wrong, deep in his gut. It rolled through him like a wave as the large demon pulled himself up from the warmth of the blankets and hopped to the floor. His bare feet landed on the pavement, the rocks under foot didn't bother the man who grew up walking around barefoot most of his life.
"Hey, you okay?" The angel whispered, Abel nodded numbly.
"Yes! I was--"
"I think she fell off the roof," another added,
"Protective much?" She murmured, he felt his face turn red as he got to his feet. What was happening? What's going on? Since he met her he couldn't seem to think straight. A group of kids raced past the two as he stared blankly at the woman before him.
"You know, I'm in your world now," he whispered, "I can make you feel something,"
The rabbit blinked at him, twitched its nose and scrambled back to the doctor. Sliding easily under the thorns, Cain laughed as the rabbit pulled itself out and dropped the herbs. The doctor sat down beside the rabbit.
“No,” Abel popped open the glove compartment, “It’s missing your signature!” he pulled out a permanent marker, handing it to Chamuel who blinked at him in confusion.
"We need to get to our hotel,"
She still looked completely shocked at him, his hands moved to her face as he inspected her which sent a wave of warmth into his body. What was he doing? He pulled away and stepped back,
Cain nodded slowly, his eyes traced her features as if he were sizing her up.
Her blunt words caused him to flinch, they've had this fight a few times about Robin. He couldn't wrap his head around why she didn't seem to like him, or maybe Robin didn't like her? It was confusing to him.
"What...is it?" He whispered.
"Hell yeah! Alpha! Look at you! you're strong, your taller than this dope," He laughed, nudging Paul who huffed, pouting at the others words.
“Abel,” Chamuel whispered, brushing the blood from his lip.
"You're...right," Israfil said, rubbing the back of his neck awkwardly, "I'm sorry, I guess I'm still learning,"
He leaned over the, now empty, passenger seat and rolled the window down.
"Yeah?"
Chamuel continued to clench and unclench his fists,
"Sleep time," Danjal replied,
"Abel" A woman's voice sang out,
"I just needed to escape a while," He hunter continued, "They're just mushrooms,"
"Abel you packed four shirts and a pair of pants, at the thrift shop you bought one shirt and a CD,"
“Lets go kill this thing,” Chamuel agreed, grinning at the other.
"Aww, you're jealous,"
They stepped inside, Abel felt the hunger rock him nearly making him feel sick as they were sat down in a booth with plastic red cushions, the waitress dressed as though she had walked out of the fifties.
"Hey, man." He murmured, wrapping his arm around his friend in a slight hug, "Are you okay?" His voice was soft, worried.
"Oh God, I'm in deep," He whispered to himself, Fran laughed beside him. He didn't pay the man any mind
"No," he whispered.
A man sprawled out on the tile, screaming loudly into the air. Everyone froze as if they were watching a movie, black sludge was falling in waves from the larger man's throat. His eyes flooded from normal to black, skin shuttering with every painful movement. Sam put a hand on Bailey's shoulder, feeling the intense desire to protect her as the human continued to scream and shift on the pure white floor turning it to a deep, dark red. The darkness continued to drip from the man's swollen body, pooling around his head.
Lucifer tilted his head to the side until a sickening crack broke the air around them, “Are you...calling me a liar, Ancitif?” he hissed. Ancitif coward away from the others gaze, as if he would implode from the look alone.
Abel blinked a few times, his pupils starting to return to normal. The drugs wearing off now, how long had he been asleep?
Abel chuckled at the others analogy, The angel's hand went to the hunter's neck. Playing with the man's hair absentmindedly.
“You do use a bat,” Donnie mused,
"No, it's like, someone was shooting a movie." He said with a groan, he sounded tired as if he hadn't slept in the past few days.
The man nodded, looking through his computer with a small sigh. The angel pulled out his vessel's ID, though Donnie warned them about using their personal things for checking in and out of motels; they hadn't had a chance to make fake ID's so they decided using Chamuel's vessel's cards would work for a short time.
"No, it's on you!" Abel spat
"Well, I think we have gasoline in the trunk with the weapons, maybe some lighters too." Sam continued, Abel groaned in frustration. He had hoped Sam could give them more than 'burn the body' but maybe there wasn't much else that could be done.
"This foods great, Issy, what's your favorite?"
"Whoo, born again!" Israfil sang out
"Hey uh, I think we gotta talk about something," Abel murmured, glancing down at the messages on his phone. He didn't even want to open the other screen shots, every single text made him wince now.
"I was able to get Arphaxat's connection with Abel broken, unfortunately, I couldn't save his soul."
"Abel,"
"Did you know you can make fake texts?" She asked, arching an eyebrow. The demon perked up,
"Aww, you guys sound like an old married couple,"
“Lets watch this fuckin’ movie!” Abel chuckled, grinning now as the memories faded into the back of his mind. The two settled in for the night, the movie took longer than Chamuel had anticipated as Abel stopped the film often to tell him facts, information or just to rewind it in case Chamuel had missed it. Yet the Angel didn’t mind, enjoying the bursting energy that shone in the man's green gaze.
"Even if Sam had God himself take that video down I'm pretty sure everyone will still remember it and talk about it. It's out there and all we can do is...roll with the punches," Abel glanced to the other, hoping for the man's approval. They had spoken about it the night before but Chamuel could see a lot of thought had been put into since then.
Her head shot up to look at him, she knew a lot about Dean, the pair had become nearly inseparable since she joined the team and she understood how badly he missed his brother. Was this real?
"He...made me an archangel. Now I'm not just an angel of love...but of war…" his words falling quiet "how can I be an angel of love and war,"
"My eyes are up here," she said, he snapped his head up feeling heat roll over his face.
The tips of the arrows are all different, bright blues and yellows of different shades. Collecting them quickly in his bag as he made for the door. Pausing, his eyes danced over a few of the papers on the wall before looking down at a pair of boots, swallowing hard. All of these things he was grabbing were experimental but the sounds of Mammon calling his name and pushing in bedroom doors caused his brain not to settle on this. With a few quick movements he tossed his shoes to the floor, pulling on the boots. They were a little large on him, the top of the shoes had a large buckle that hummed and snapped closed around Robin's leg. Holding it tight into position to prevent the boot from falling. The bottom's made of bright metal, large circular holes on the underside and a couple wires reached to the back of the shoe, connecting to a metal cylinder hooked into the back.
Now as they drove towards the thrift store Chamuel couldn’t help himself looking through the tapes, completely surprised at how well taken care of they are.
“I’m a hunter,” He lied, “Your boys posted about your disappearance on twitter,” It wasn’t a complete lie, he thought to himself as he stood up and attempted to pull the thorn crown off Sam’s head. The two had, just today, posted that they were looking for Sam.
"Something's not right," he murmured to himself, shaking his head and starting up his motorcycle once more. The world racing past the man, his mind swirling with thought as the loud noises of New York surrounded him. His jaw clenched as he pulled up to the motel, a feeling of deep dread burned into his skin as he parked his bike, getting off quickly and making his way into the room. He and Sam had been hoping from motel to motel attempting to keep themselves from being discovered but finally deciding to wait in this one until Abel and Chamuel made it up to them.
He turned his head slowly, usually, he'd say he was an angel of the Lord. But this was no longer the case,
"And one Campbell!" Israfil said as he dropped back down to his feet, his halo glimmered in the light. He gestured to Donnie who looked shocked and shook his head, Israfil nodded at him.
The shadow under him shuttered, moving lightly under the other's feet before it flew at the ceiling. The black shadow covered over the large circular camera, cutting the view of the doctor. He sucked in a few breaths, closing his eyes his hand glowed against her skin. Gulping in air as the blackness slowly seeped from her skin and ran into the palm of his open hand racing up his arm vanishing in his Carmel skin. his shadow returned to him only a heartbeat later.
"Guess...just stressed about everything," Chamuel whispered, before Cain could say anything the angel jumped back in shock. The doctor glanced down in confusion at what the other saw, a large spider raced across the wooden deck causing the Angel to shuffle away from it. Groaning inward, he shot the man an embarrassed look.
Bailey got to her feet, flipping the canvas over and snapping a picture before doing the same on the other side.
"Blood will roll down the wings of war," he shouted against the racing, rolling winds. "Bodies will stack high as mountains," he gasped as the darkness tore into his flesh. "The earth will be swallowed by the dragon with many heads!"
"I saw someone else in there, he's gotta be in trouble hes--"
"What was that about?" Bailey asked, causing everyone to silently look over at her.
"You know," Abel stopped again, turning on his heels "come on, I'm gonna grab you something for your eye,"
"Abe, is Sam around?" Donnie croaked, "I...I need to talk to him."
"Yes, they're on a mission to track down an important piece of history that had been lost in New York. Is there an issue?"
“Chamuel, make sure Abel doesn’t shoot himself, I’ll be right back,”
"Oh, I've heard so much about you boys," She laughed, wrapping her arms around Abel who chuckled uncomfortably. She let him go and hugged Chamuel who awkwardly returned it, shrugging at Abel when she pulled away.
"How'd he get up there?"
'This isn't a gay rights thing, he's an angel, Paul! Besides, he's been in love with Faith forever. Literally.'
He glanced back to the mirror and jumped out of his skin, Cherm stood behind him. His shadow-like figure looming over the doctor, his smile wicked, twisted upwards to a grin.
"Alright Romeo," She stopped beside Danjal "If you're gonna help us tomorrow you're gonna have to get ready. Put Danjal on Arrow's back with ya', meet me in the far field." She said with a devilish grin.
"I had a feeling you were different," Abel chuckled as he pulled away, placing both hands on the man's shoulders and looking down at the Adinkra.
"Hm?"
He practically wailed this out at her, she rolled her eyes at him and ruffled the man's hair.
"You...don't think she's bribing us?" He asked, completely shocked, Mishka shrugged.
“Veggie burger, please,” Chamuel said in a light voice, the woman nodded at them before making her way towards the back. For the first time since he and Chamuel were forced together he felt like a normal human being. As if all this wasn’t happening and he was just out with a friend to grab a bite to eat,
"Let's do this! Abel's not feeling good, so I don't think he'll want to go,"
“Why did they want the Chamulet?” Abel asked, stopping to look up at Chamuel who also shrugged. They continued onward, neither speaking as they made for the entrance. They stripped out of their clothes, knowing the police would be doing DNA tests, and scattered them among different trash cans. The two men getting in the Impala in their underwear, Abel turned the key till the car roared to life. This time, he turned the radio on to one of his fathers cassette tapes.
"Yeah I figured that out pretty fast," Sam said with a soft chuckle as he leaned against the desk beside her.
"Abel?" Chamuel whispered, looking at his friend with half lidded eyes, he hadn't heard Cain. Abel looked from Chamuel to Cain, deciding not to push it as he helped his friend up the stairs. Feeling a hole in his heart from the others words, you don't deserve him. He didn't deserve Chamuel, in fact, half of him wished this all happened to someone else.
"Alright, I'll tell you,"
"What...are you going to do?" Sam whispered.
Chamuel smiled at Abel, "I'm not going anywhere, if a wall kills me Uriel will be pissed"
"It's cause his widdle heart is broken!" Obizuth laughed as she sauntered into the building with her phone out.
"That's actually a good idea!" Donnie laughed
"You really are new to this," Donnie replied bluntly, "it might be a trap,"
“Cham! Come on!” Abel shouted from another room,
Chamuel raced a hand over the bat with wide eyes.
Cain's jaw tightened but he didn't respond to this, "Let's see if we can find an exit," the doctor whispered.
"Do you know what you're going to say?" Chamuel asked,
"Hey, it's okay," she whispered, pulling her leather jacket off and tossing it to the floor. He looked at anxiety in his eyes,
"Hello?" He called down, he swore he saw a flash of white fur in the blackness but his thoughts were cut short as weight fell against his back. He scrambled to find a grip only to lose all footing, he fell into the darkness with a yowl of surprise.
"What is Jacob even doing in this picture?" Sam asked, pointing to the son with the curly hair. His arms up at the camera, cake frosting smudged all over his face.
"My grandad was a mysterious man," she shook her head, playing with the page she looked down on. The page before this had been torn out, only a few scraps of paper remained of it; the page she read from was also torn, everything aside from the words seemed to have been ripped out.
"Eso podrá ser cierto," ("That might be true,") the man added
He scrolled, a picture of Cain and Abel sat under that, standing in front of the Impala. Abel leaned against the black car. A grin plastered on his face, while Cain leaned against the car with arms crossed and a puzzled expression.
Sam hesitated, unsure if he should even mention possibly giving the car to the other. After all, it was his car, right? Though if Dean was alive he knew that his brother wouldn't have given it a second thought. That is, when Abel was old enough.
"It's as real as you want it to be," he replied smoothly, not wanting to fully admit to it all as the sun died out behind the trees.
"So…" Abel started, looking around him, Sam sighed and rolled his eyes.
"Sammy! There you are!" He frowned when he spotted Bailey, glancing at Sam and back to Bailey.
“The bible says, that through Jesus, we are born again,”
Hearing Abel say his full name made him feel as if someone punched him in the chest knocking the wind from him, but in a good way. It was a warmth he couldn't begin to understand, something that in thousands of years he never felt in his life
"It's called...the Cameron Village sewer blob," Israfil read, the bright blue of the phone turned his usual cheerful demeanor to a colder one. Having logged into the wifi of a coffee shop that sat above them the two did some quick research. They could hear some sort of commotion happening above but neither gave it much thought, the sound of laughing, screaming and police fell from the above world but the tunnels seemed to prevent them from fully making out what was happening.
"Awww, sad boy," Chamuel chuckled, ruffling Abel's hair.
"You play?" Bailey asked with a surprised glance,
"How can we hear that?" Bailey asked,
"Mother let you in?" He whispered, she could see his brain working overtime attempting to understand everything that happened.
"Abel...you can…"
Chamuel breathed deep, pulling inwardly for more power, feeling it being forced out. His eyes snapped open, they glowed against the night sky. He stood up despite Abels attempt to stop him
The angel blinked a few more times, war fell from his gaze leaving Chamuel feeling exhausted.
"It's my Adinkra," Israfil said, "like how Abel has one, that one was Faiths. It holds our grace, I mean, it use too. Back in the day when the human body couldn't fully handle our power. So we had to use them or risk the death of our host and back then...we...didn't change hosts much. I've been using the same vessel for almost three hundred years. But now? Humans seemed to have evolved to hold us better. I still use mine though, my vessel...it's important, the Adinkra helps keep it from overpowering my vessel,"
"Well," he frowned at Chamuel, "You're not supposed to keep your other grace. Love? War should be eating that away,"
Rubbing his hands together as if attempting to comfort himself from the war that waged inside the depths of his mind, “So I had to answer a lot of prayers for couples, I’m wondering if this place had a family I’d watch over in it.”
All three looked at him in complete shock and awe, Convel had his phone held up. Having live tweeted the entire encounter which made Israfils face turn a shade of red, he smiled bright.
The car held a sign that read "for sale" in the window. Pulling out his phone,
"Dean the demon cast something over the puddle, you can't get past it,"
"Aw, you got a soft side, sugar Cain,"
"Y'all as sick as rats in a lab!" Gretchen snorted, crossing her arms over her chest. Glaring at the woman with the darker skin and narrowed gaze. "You should be stayin' home! We ain't never made our pact this extreme, what is goin' on in your stupid heads, Jasira!"
"Don't be afraid," Abel murmured, "we just want your little trinket there,"
"Sam's probably having a heart attack," Bailey shouted over her shoulder with a laugh.
The room was large with a king sized bed, a small flat screen television, a fridge and a bathroom with a small shower. It was on the cheaper side, a few stains on the covers and walls but the demon couldn't afford to be picky. He pulled off his hoodie, his mind raced with questions he wasn't sure he'd get answers to.
"So if your real angel self didn't have big wings but had--"
"Man, you do that grudge noise way too perfect!"
“Well, why not do that today?” Donnie asked, “I got an awesome video camera! We can take videos of you guys just doing what you normally do. We can also take some fake shots too, make it look like Chamuel’s glow is fake or whatever,”
"As of right now, I'm gonna help ya even harder to get with em,"
"Well yes! I'm more than working out and beer,"
Baal had enough playing nice, he was a demon, even if he turned a new leaf he didn't think his team would want him or Bailey being carted off to jail. Besides, the cuffs were probably intensely dirty, which Baal didn't like. Theo turned to talk to his partner as he took the thermometer from her, grabbing a second item from the woman as well but Baal didn't have time to think about it.
"Of course," Abel snapped his finger, turning to the man.
"What're ya gonna do? I ain't afraid of ya, yer a coward. You ain't nothing like yur father,"
"What is it son?" The man asked, turning from his son and snatching the gun up. He held it up and shot again at the Target, causing the child to wince at the blasting noise.
Though the men got a few odd looks no one really paid them much mind. The pair chatting to one another, Chamuel letting Abel play with his hand. The hunter's small hands could be almost completely covered by his own, his smile dreamy as he looked down at the brunette.
"Even poisoning this fucker wasn't enough! Why won't you just give up?" Cherm hissed into Cains ear.
Fran looked at Baal now, his rich golden gaze locked with Baal's pale blue.
"Are we here?" He asked, she nodded. He sat up, rubbing his eye, his sweater had been torn apart in multiple areas, blood dotted his face and collected on the fabric. He looked outside, groaning.
“That's something that's been botherin, me.”
"Ya can't punch, Abel," Butch laughed, "I aint 'fraid of you,"
“So...How’s about them Royals?” Abel said to break the silence.
*Please keep in mind that every trans person is different. Make sure to talk with your partner before using any terms shown here.*
He could see Robin's sleeping form as he entered the room, the man let out a soft gasp and groaned as he rolled a few times in the bed. Danjal placed the cat on the mattress, sitting down beside the other.
"What are you doing?" Cain asked, making his way to his brother.
"One angel, one idiot,"
"I don't know, from what I saw he kept something pretty big from you,"
"Well, I did hear that a pure soul can use an angel's Adinkra if the angel isn't dead, but...most of the time adults don't have pure souls. Just children," Chamuel said, he sounded tired. The noise of a radio being fiddled with could be heard, Sam shuffled in the background.
Baal nodded at her though she didn't need to look at him to know he'd do as she asked without question. The demon pulled his phone from his pocket despite his trembling hands and started to snap pictures of the pews. His eyes narrowed when he noticed something had been carved into the wood of one of the many, long, wooden benches.
Mammon gagged, spitting blood as death fell over his system again. Lucifer leaned down, his feet snapping through the other's body.
"Bodies are sacred, you can't just get a new one," Uriel looked at the other in shock as his voice continued to rise, "Your mind will be far too focused on him if his feelings are returned!" Uriel yowled, "you'll get him killed, you'll get yourself killed. War...is powerful, he will not stop until he's satisfied, War isn't a toy." The angel seemed to relax, adjusting his tie as he spoke.
"To party!" Donnie and Abel shouted at the same time, exploding in laughter. Shoving each other playfully, Cain laughed as well. Despite the jealousy he felt, for the first time in his life, he felt honestly happy. For the first time, he didn't think of death.
They stood in a large workout room that was attached to Norma's home, though he appreciates the woman's kindness he found himself growing cautious of her. He couldn't place why but she seemed too perfect. The hunter landed a few more punches to the heavy bag, he swayed after as if he were unable to stand up straight.
“What do you mean?”
“My name is Uriel, I’m an Angel of the Lord, this next to you is Chamuel,”
"How? Why?"
"Oh, an that arrow trick? Using an angel in your mix, it ain't fair, that's cheatin'" Jasira snorted, Robin looked at the other in shock. Did she call him an angel?
"What's up?" He grumbled,
"I can do that ten times over," he roared, smoke flew from his nose. She nodded as the bike continued to climb until she came to the last floor. They were up high now as she drove, sucking in air and praying that everyone was right, that Baal wasn't evil, that he would help save them, save her.
"We can't wait for that though," Baal interrupted,
"Man, they're callin' you Jesus! A sign from God! But even so, most of the comments say it's fake,"
"That'd be my ride," Sam said with a smile towards the man. "It was nice to meet you,"
"Why not get a stuffed animal? I usually sleep with one!"
"It's okay," Robin said, keeping his voice calm as he kept his hands up, "I can help you,"
"Rooster should be coming back soon," Dave called over his shoulder. Bodhi turned towards the small group, "follow us," He said with a nod to Tater.
"If anything happens to me, to Bailey, anyone. You stay with that angel," his eyes turned serious now, he placed a hand on Abel's shoulder and squeezed.
"Is he with Mishka?" Cain asked, causing the angel to cough as if he was choking on something.
“Wake up, we’re going to go to that strip club,”
“Do you think he’d have been mayor?” The woman behind the camera asked, her voice filled with sorrow.
"No free ice," Chamuel and Abel said at the same time before laughing again.
"Damn," Cain whispered, blinking at the glove then towards his brothers hand.
Abel scoffed, exploding towards her now with his vision doubled. His feet not touching the ground as he swung towards her, she jumped from his path and leapt onto the stage. Eyes narrowed, Abel took off after her, grabbing the pole to swing away from her knife like fingers, turning back around to land a blow on her back with his boots. She growled in pain, kicking the pole so hard it broke under his hands.
"Look man, I don't know what's going on with you and her but stop taking her emotions!"
“You missed,”
"My name's Robin, I-I'm a reformed demon, I was black mailed into helping Obizuth and now I want to help you," he vomited out the words so quickly it took Abel a second to run them through his head.
"Stop it," the smaller man whispered, Donnie could smell sulfur on the pair.
"Uh, martini?" He said with a laugh, she smiled wide and nodded, vanishing back into the kitchen.
"If you had a bulge I'd be all over it right now," The blonde mused, the backhanded comment made the hunter flinch but he didn't say anything about it.
"I'm swoonin' over here!" He laughed,
"Sorry, he uh, I'm just…"
"Sorry," Chamuel breathed, "I should have pulled out," He whispered, Abel didn't care as he wrapped his arms around the angel. Kissing him over and over,
Cain opened his eyes, looking over at his brother. Swinging his legs lightly as they sat in the darkness.
"Sam winchester," She murmured into his ear, grinding lightly against him as she did so.
Abel practically pushed people aside as he raced after it, Chamuel attempting to keep up with the other. Apologizing to people as he ran past,
"You sure you're on the right channel, Sam?" Abel asked eventually, pulling up the app on his phone.
"Hey!" Sam called, Cain nodded. Something about the other gave Sam a chill but he chalked this up to his own anxieties.
“Here ya go!” Abel said, placing a large cup of beer in front of the man who looked at it with a confused expression, “Thanks, I uh, don’t really have any money right now,” Chamuel confessed, feeling his face heat up with embarrassment.
The older hunter pointed to the baseball bat, "take that, take some guns, go practice! Grab a Latin book on your way too, you'll need to learn it." Abel rolled his eyes but didn't argue, grabbing his bat he turned to the other and back to Sam.
"Hey Chammy!" He grinned at the man, running his fingers through his hair in an attempt to keep it pushed back and out of his face. The small big in the front stuck out regardless of his constant teasing.
Before Israfil could reply, starting to float back towards the ledge, the monster exploded from the depths of the darkness. Except it now stood huge, as if it were a giant squid with long, thick tentacles that wrapped around the angel. He screamed in shock as they were tugged down, the guitar let out a whine as the strings snapped from the sudden pressure.
Abel continued to push Chamuel back to his room,
Abel glanced at the Twitter page with his eyes narrowed down, before he could ask Sam cut in.
"We don't have a choice,"
"No no no no!" Mishka shouted as Donnie reached past Cain and attempted to mess her up with his hand. She laughed, leaning away from him as his hand slapped at the remote. Cain froze for a second but the hand motion was playful, causing him to relax once more.
“I...don’t honestly know,”
"Or a gift from that Adinkra," Baal snorted,
"Better return the couch," he said with a small glint of humor in his gaze, "it's got a lot of were and tear on it,"
The inside smelled like a mix of smoke and body odor, the air was thick with the breaths of handfuls of people packed close together. The inside of the bar was small, with a long table that was attached to a backroom. The bartenders were going in and out of the double doors to get more alcohol, cups and napkins. A few people littered the stools that were pushed against the table, drinks in hand, smiles on their lips as they chatted with one another. In the middle of the room was a large open space with a few scattered tables, a band played on a stage that was set against the wall. The beat from their drum could be felt in the ground below his feet.
"Baby," Arphaxat murmured, placing a hand on Abel's chin and turning him so they were staring into each other's gaze. The demon leaned forward, planting a soft kiss on the others lips.
"N-not a lot," Baal stammered, the man nodded, pulling his phone out and sitting beside Baal.
"Naw we can just fake it all,"
"No," Theo whistled, "but we can arrest you if you don't tell us where Abel is hiding."
"The sigil!" They both gasped at the same time, she pelted up the steps past him and yanked out her phone. Jumping up onto the side where they had just been standing and snapping a few quick, blurry pictures and leaping down. Sam practically caught her before they raced down the steps. The police officer ran into the room,
"Hey, come on, let's check the car lot," Cham stood up, tugging at Abel as he went, "if we sit around feeling sorry for ourselves we won't get anything done,"
“Mr. Vess, good to see you!” Abel said attempting to sound cheerful as if this entire thing wasn’t one giant red flag.
"Abel, are...you not telling me something?"
"Let go!" He shouted,
With that the hunter couldn't keep his eyes open any longer. Turning the screen of his phone off he curled himself closer to Chamuel, laying his head next to the others. Feeling safe with the angel beside him he fell into the deep, blackness of sleep.
"What is it?" Baal asked, cranking his head to get a look at the paperwork. She tore open the fancy envelope, letting the paper scatter to the floor,
Holding her upside down in front of him, she spat in his face causing anger to flood his vision.
Chamuel groaned as he woke up, his head was shoved against Abel’s back. His head still throbbed from the day before, his eyesight was no longer blurred from the black eyes as he sat up in bed. The sun splashed it’s soft light into the room, bathing him in its warmth. Turning to look down at the hunter, he had a scar on his cheek that he never noticed before, standing up he stretched into the air. Then it hit him what happened the night before, he had to tell Sam!
"Ah shut up Haha," She snorted, "I'm deaf and I can still hear your voice,"
"Why would he think that? That's...really specific, dont'cha think?" Bailey murmured.
"Well," Abel could tell Sam was glaring at the phone, probably making some sort of over dramatic face, "salt and burn the body, do you know where the body is? Or whatever the ghosts attached too?"
"We're so dead," someone whispered as the TV showed clips of the group fighting against the creatures and monsters. As it showed the clip of War blasting off the building, nearly leveling a few floors under the weight of his power, the talking in the bar got louder as a few panicked.
Both men stopped and glanced towards Baal who had just entered the home, he was missing one of his brass knuckles and the other was covered in black blood.
“Like....May the force be with you, but...may the apocalypse be with you!” Donnie gave a playful evil grin, putting his hands like he was attempting to mimic the scene.
Parking in the front, Donnie rolled his eyes as he spotted his large family all collected in the front of the house. A few kids ran around, his oldest brother stood with his wife who had a hand on her large belly. A couple of his other brothers waved him down, his only Sister towered over Paul with her arms out waving them in excitement.
He felt Israfil tense only for the man to lean into the kiss, pulling himself closer to Donnie. One hand behind the Wolf's neck and the other gripping his arm, Donnie pulled away only for the angel to close the distance again. Joy sparked into him as they kissed in the light of the fireflies, it wasn't until the sound of leaves crunching caused the men to pull away and move attention to the sound of laughing.
Below the etchings was a large altar with a body laying on it. Bailey gasped as she spotted the corpse, the smell of rotting flesh rolled through the air. The straw haired boy walked to the altar, pointing to the body before he vanished. The two raced through the shallow water that surrounded the stone and hopped up a few steps towards the moss covered altar.
"For what? Cryin?"
"A party invite?"
"Thanks! I was getting a little cold," The man cackled
"Ouch! What the he--" He started but Hahasiah shushed him, rolling her fingers over his palms hard making him wince.
"Trust me, he forgives ya,"
"Unfortunately,"
Chamuel cut Bailey's words off, "what was it?" War flashed in the angel's voice as he turned to look at her. His eyes red from crying but the anger inside them caused Bailey to flinch.
“Ya, know, I keep the utilities on, clean out the weeds sometimes, try to keep the junkyard-- kind of clean," He chuckled,
Abel let out a sigh, "come on, man!"
The wall swirled under his touch before it opened up to show a secret, large room. It was as if one was on stage in front of thousands of demons, humans, monsters and cryptids. They laughed, shoving one another, shouting into the air.
Sam frowned at this, it was the last picture in the pile with a few red marks and a large question mark on the front. He folded it up, shoving it into his pocket. His hand brushed the watch, he had nearly forgotten about it in all the chaos!
He looked at Abel in shock, "I'm not doing that," he retorted, though he felt his face flush.
"Boom!"
"Abel," Chamuel shouted. Theo shot his gun a few times. The bullets whizzed through the dark arms, a few of them exploding and showering the city below with its blood. A bullet whizzed by Abel's head causing him to yelp in shock.
"He's one of them," they hissed out, slithering towards the pair. Spitting venom to the floor beside the men causing the hell hound known as Mark to growl at the snake-like person.
"Out," She replied simply, making her way back to the open door, "If you ever get stuck in here again," She placed a hand on a small wooden picture frame beside the door, her uncle and aunt smiled at the camera holding up a few glasses of expensive looking alcohol. She twisted the picture frame to the side, the door clicked open creaking into the dead air of the hidden room below.
Theo stared at him deadpanned for a few heartbeats before writing something down, Israfil shuffled uncomfortably.
"Now you try it," She said, motioning to Danjal. He watched his friend trot out and back, rolling his eyes as she praised him.
"I didn't love you?" He whispered, his voice cracking as she spoke. Somewhere in him, he always felt something was off about her advances. Pain rolled through his chest, stronger than anything he'd ever felt. Tears now flowing, only seconds ago he was on top of the world and now he felt like he'd been crushed.
He put his finger to his lips causing Chamuel to fall silent, pointing upwards to the ceiling, he moved towards the Angel with wide eyes.
"Oh, this isn't my place, but it's closer to where we need to go. Plus, it has a lot of stuff we can use,"
“Who was it?” Eileen asks as she sits up and turns on the lamp.
“Good ‘cause we got nothin’.”
“Sometimes easy sounds nice. We’ve never had easy.”
~~~~~~~~~~
Lucifer only partially listens, entering the house on his own
Beside them, Sam and Eileen are slow dancing as well. Eileen is resting her head on Sam’s chest as he holds her close. They’re done losing each other. They’re going to hold on for as long as they can until they can go peacefully in their sleep after a long life together.
“You sure you’re okay.”
~~~~~~~~~~
“Ya. If that doesn’t pan out we’ll go to the abusive dad who basically said the same thing.”
“I’m so glad you were able to make it.”
“What makes you think I want to talk to you?”
“And you actually killed me. I think we’re even.”
“I doubt that,” Sam laughs. “He’s been chillin’ in Heaven for too long. He’s out of practice.”
“Cass,” Dean says.
Eileen looks over at Sam’s tense glare at his father and grabs his hand. “So what can we be doing in the meantime?”
Father Jackson walks out onto the porch where everyone else is sitting in silence. “I don’t think there’s much else I can do. He confessed but I don’t think he’s going to heal until he forgives himself.”
“It isn’t your fault, it’s Chuck’s.”
Cass just shrugs, “If you think that is weird you should know that he’s also the son of Lucifer.”
“I should probably say here,” Eileen says before they get out. “He doesn’t know me so it could freak him out.”
“I’ve never really been able to afford much food.”
“I’m very sorry,” Sam says.
“So a lot like my dream then,” Dean mutters.
“That's probably a good idea.”
“You better not.” Dean places his hand on Cass’ cheek and pulls him in for a kiss.
“You mean someone who is caring and kind? And someone who wants to do good in the world?” Sam says.
“Is that good or bad?”
He purses his lips before speaking. “I was here. Prepping for Sunday’s service. Which, if you don’t mind, I am in the middle of doing now.”
“You’re done when we say you’re done, abomination. Once this is over, you can go back to your miserable life.”
“Yep. We should probably get back. See if they found anything in the books.”
“When I went to get Cass back all of the angels, demons and reapers were awake with the Empty. Which I’m assuming was my doing. So I was able to put them all back to sleep and therefore the Empty was able to go back to sleep as well. I’m in the process of rebuilding an afterlife for those who deserve it that isn’t so cruel.”
Martin goes in for a handshake, flinching as his palm touches Sam’s silver ring.
“I don’t know but if Jesse can mess with Jack's mind when he’s more powerful than we ever thought he could be. Who knows what he’s capable of.”
“I don’t even know where to start with this.” Sam sighs.
“Seriously, did everyone know?”
Dean collapses onto a chair and puts his face in his hands. “God, I’m so done with all this shit. What happened to retirement and relaxation?”
“Well, I proposed after a rough hunt and asked her to retire with me. Obviously, she said yes.” Sam nudged Eileen playfully. “It was really small and informal. Just some hunters and Jodi, Donna, and the girls. Held it in a park near Jodi’s house. A few years later Eileen got pregnant and we had a son. Named him Dean.” Sam looks over at his brother who smiles and looks down at his feet.
“Then where.”
“Always.”
“You have to say it.”
Cass nods and smiles sadly before responding. “Okay. Let’s get started.”
“This cut’s pretty damn deep and in bad need of a deep cleaning to prevent infection but other than that there isn't much I can do. Can’t one of y’all just heal him?”
“What’s goin’ on?”
“Shit.” Dean turns around. “Hiya Zach! Haven’t seen you since I stabbed you in the face.”
WOOSH
Sam smiles and runs up the steps to the porch. Immediately picking her up and kissing her. It had been five years since she passed. The doctors said it was a heart attack. For Eileen, it had only been a day since she entered heaven, but that was long enough to go without seeing Sam.
“I love you too. Just wanted to lighten the mood a bit.”
The real Sam’s voice echoes in his mind. “Jack? Please Dean really needs you. He’s dying? I need you to come help him. I know you said you were going to be hands-off but, Dean doesn’t deserve to die like this. Cass doesn’t deserve Dean dying like this. Not after Cass gave his life to save him. Please, Jack. Please be hearing this.”
“Come on,” he grabs Cass’ hand and drags him towards the karaoke machine, “we’ll do a duet.”
“Okay, we’re pulling into the Church so we gotta go.”
“I’m sorry?”
“If it was just a normal human injury then I could treat it like I would anyone else, but this definitely isn’t normal or human.”
Dean sits down with him and wraps his arms around the angel, Cass leaning into him. “It was Gabe’s choice, Cass. He would have done it with or without your consent.”
“Great.”
“So just another day for us,” Sam says.
“You feelin’ any better Jack?” Sam asks.
“Well she’s already dead so what’s your play here?”
“I am a centuries-old angel. I am in no sense ‘adorable’.”
“Of course. It’ll give me a chance to catch up on some Netflix and the goings-on in the world.”
“Yes. I was never able to have children myself so I enjoyed mentoring the young kids in our community.”
Jack smiles. “I’m glad you came to that conclusion. This world needs more people like you.”
Jebediah scowls and turns away from them, nodding at the angels behind him. He turns back with even more anger showing. “You haven’t won. We will find a way.”
Dean gets wide-eyed and looks over at Cass, who looks just as terrified as Dean.
“Keep talking to him. Help him see that he is a good person, and is worthy of happiness and peace.”
“Apparently.”
“Gabriel. What. The. Fuck.”
It’s 13 minutes to midnight when they hear a ‘woosh’ from the outside of the door. Alex and Jody were in the process of choosing a song before they stop and turn towards the sound. Before anyone can go investigate, Jack walks in, followed by Gabe and Balthazar.
“It means you and me lookin’ gorgeous as hell in some perfectly tailored suits declaring our love for each other in front of the people we care about most, then eat pie.”
~~~~~~~~~~
“It’s not like I made it easy,” Jesse jokes.
“It started with just us. All Dean and I had was each other. Our dad may have “done his best” in his mind but he was still never truly a father to us. Dean was the one who raised me. That’s why family has never been about blood to us, because John, John was never really our family, family is something you choose.”
“So it sounds like we are hunting a werewolf or a pack of them which would rule out the Preacher since he didn’t react to the silver,” Sam sighs.
“Hello Jack.”
“For fuck sake Cassie,” Balthazar interjects. “You’ve saved the world like a hundred times. If anyone deserves a giant ego it’s you.”
“Fuck that. There is no fate but what we make for ourselves.”
Jack closes his eyes as more tears stream out. His lower lip trembles, unable to form words.
“And I know you aren’t either.”
“Well what do you suggest? We go up against God with a shotgun and a can do attitude? Jack doesn’t have the power to take God on in a one on one battle. And everyone that could help him is dead.”
“You guys are so cute I just want to throw up,” Dean says, interrupting their teasing.
“I think I still have you all beat in that category,” Cass responds.
Chuck sighs dramatically. “Fine. Whatever gets this party started. Let's finish this where it all started last time. You know, that cemetery where I killed you?”
“And I you. Your parents are amazing people.”
“Hey, we just got a call about a possible werewolf to kill about 45 minutes away in Beloit so Sam and Eileen are checking it out. Looks like it’s just us and Cass for lunch whenever you’re hungry.”
“So you punched him,” Sam says.
“What if we got everyone else. Mom, Dad, Jody, Donna, Kevin, Charlie, Ash, Ellen, Jo…everyone. We may not be enough but if everyone got together, we may be able to come up with something.”
“Hmmm. What about seeing your angel? Is that better than stabbing me?”
“Dean,” Sam says. “We let him loose on the world. He’s kind of our responsibility.”
“Sadly.”
“No, I am helping Jack finish up the remodeling of Heaven, the Empty, and Purgatory then I am retiring. But you do have someone else you know in charge here.”
“But God, er Chuck, is human now,” Hannah says, “why is he even a concern?”
Sam looks sadly at Dean and Cass, grateful that they have each other but being angry that they can’t just be happy. He then glances over to his parents. Mary looks almost as worried as Cass is but he has a feeling that the worry is mostly for what will happen if they were wrong about the power-sharing preventing Chuck from just killing Jack and getting his powers back. John on the other hand is glancing around the room, avoiding looking at Dean and Cass. Sam obviously knows why and it just angers him further. John still isn’t okay with Dean being with Cass but at least he isn’t saying anything insensitive or rude.
“Is there any angel that is missing or one that would want Chuck to be back in power?” Sam asks.
“Basically Jack would just have to confess his sins.”
“I killed your mom, Sam.”
“We’re going to save him,” Cass states, looking between Sam and Eileen. “And in the meantime, if he’s anything like his parents, he’s tough enough to handle this.
“Hi Jesse.”
“But you should know. Atara was telling me about this group of angels that want God to be back in charge. As far as I know, they aren’t planning anything though. She didn’t tell me anything more once I said that I was supportive of Jack.”
“I love you too,” Claire responds.
“We all did. Hey, you guys need any help while I’m here?”
“Amara’s trying to take back over Chuck’s body. She’s still in him.”
“Ya… shit.”
“I don’t know. I’m thinking I may just join the rest of the Angels in renovating Heaven. Someone else can take charge.”
“I’ve never heard of a god power-sharing with more than one person. And it’s normally a demigod that gets the power.”
“Chuck created it and then tried to destroy it because he couldn’t control the people living in it.”
“I’ll be fine, just get some rest, you deserve it after having to deal with Chuck.”
“They miss you. They were freaking out about not being able to come to save you themselves.”
“Hmm?”
“We have one more card that we can play. Jesse Turner, the 'antichrist' as Heaven called him. We met him about 10 years ago but he disappeared and we haven’t seen him since, but he’s powerful. At least as powerful as you are. Even more if he’s been practicing controlling his powers all these years.”
“No, they’re not.”
“If you haven’t used them in a long time, that means you are in control.”
Rowena smiles at him and turns to Sam once more, “Goodbye Samuel.” Then she was gone.
Sam, Dean, Cass, Eileen, Jack, and Jesse all sit at the dining room table with plates of various breakfast foods in front of them. They’re all laughing and exchanging stories.
~~~~~~~~~~
“Either way, my birth has brought nothing but pain. Just after my mom died I got afraid and attacked Sam and Dean. I hurt others too. After Sam, Dean, and Cass took me in I killed an innocent man on a hunt. I put my trust in Lucifer and he took my powers which led to Dean having to sacrifice his body for Michael to defeat him, which led to Dean being used and hurt for months. After I got my grace back I burned off my soul using my powers to kill Michael and I-” his voice cracks, “I killed Sam and Dean’s mom, Mary after I killed Nick for trying to resurrect Lucifer. Which drove Cass and Dean apart and caused them and Sam pain. Then God killed me and my death only brought more pain to the people I love. When I came back, I failed to kill God and that resulted in the entire world being wiped out and Cass dying, which destroyed Dean. After we won and I became God I failed to control things how I should have and a group of angels broke Chuck out to try and restore him as God which led to hundreds of deaths that could have been avoided if I had just been smarter. On top of all of that pain that I have caused, I’ve lied to and deceived people. I’ve been selfish. I’ve been-”
“Very true. Where’s Kaya?”
A guy that looks like the failed lead of an emo band turns away from a messy desk to look at Gabe, Cass, and Jack.“Loki. What are you doing here?”
“It’s the only plan we got.”
“Did she mention anyone else that she was working with?”
“Something has to have happened.” Dean paces around the room.
Dean cuts him off. “Hey hey hey. It’s all going to be alright.” He puts his hand on Cass’. “He’s gonna be fine. I promise.”
“Of course I did. Who knew you get arrested for punching an asshole.”
Jack and Cass return with old friends and all is well until Jack won't heal. Lots of crying in this episode (from both the characters and me).
“Because I promised myself that never do anything to hurt you ever again.”
“Agent Halen and Hoth,” Sam says.
“Well technically I will still be an angel but Jack said I deserve to rest. I was hesitant at first and I hadn’t made my decision regarding it until now. If it’s okay with you, Dean, I’d like to spend my time here, with you. All of you.”
“What was that for?!”
“And yet you never responded.”
“Maybe, but not those details.”
“I always hated that guy. And why would you not want to be God?”
Jack is laid out on the couch unconscious with Bobby sitting in the chair next to him.
“Heaven,” Jack responds.
He hesitates, would Cass want to be human? It would be better than being here for eternity right? “Fine.” Dean turns and thinks. How the hell is he supposed to bring thousands of angels, demons, and reapers back to life and then immediately kill them? “Can you bring them all here?”
“Umm, I died and, well the new ‘God’, who is the son of Lucifer that we took in, he brought me back and I asked him to remove my grace so I could be human. So I don’t have any powers anymore.”
“What?” Dean asks chuckling in response.
“What? And Jack does?” He asks sarcastically.
WOOSH
Gabe and Balthazar laugh and walk over the others.
“What do you mean?”
“So this is the actual Book of the Damned?” John says holding the old book up to the light. “The one made of human skin and blood.”
“I’m not sure I want to. It’ll just enable Dean.”
“Ya, I’m… I’m feeling ‘me’ again.”
“Lebanon, Kansas.”
“Dean?” Rowena interjected “I think I may know a way for you to get your angel back, but it’s a bit dangerous.”
“I guess. I just don’t get why Chuck is insisting that he won, he’s literally in a cell.”
“What?! The universe’s best hunters went out like that?”
“Cass!” Dean tackles the angel.
“Remember when the angels fell and there were those suicide bombers?
“And how do you suggest we do that huh? Just have me ask dad to retire in the countryside? You think he’ll just put everything back to normal just cause I asked him to? He doesn’t care about me or anything that he created for that matter.”
“Thanks.”
“I will. Thank you for everything.”
Sam and Eileen glance at each other.
“Jack, nice of you to come,” says the angel possessing the tall woman standing in the middle of the falling-apart house.
“They had to choose a place that we couldn’t just smite.”
Cass looks up to see Garth holding a bloody knife.
“What? You can’t fault me for assuming.”
“Hello,” Sam says to the woman at the front desk, “does there happen to be a Chuck Shurley in lock-up?”
“Anything’s possible at this point.”
“So they finally got together huh Samsquach?”
“So what do we do now?” Sam looks over at his brother on the porch bench next to him. “There’s no hunt, no one to fight, no jobs, nothing.”
The rest of the table chuckles. “Ya, maybe,” Sam responds. “Either way, I don’t think he’s much of a threat. Besides, I’m sure Jack is keeping tabs on him.”
~~~~~~~~~~
It’s just past 9:30 when they pull into the parking lot of Jesse’s apartment complex. It’s a little dodgy but not as bad as some of the places they’ve stayed in the past. Sam looks down at the address Jack gave them. It reads Appt. #56, which for this building is on the third floor.
“Ok. Let’s keep going. Hades said I could do about 10 shares total so I gotta transfer to 8 more angels.”
“Well I knew that but I just thought that maybe this time would be okay since Jack was God and… I don’t know. I was too optimistic I guess.”
Dean pulls Cass close and closes his eyes. Ready to awaken and start the new year as the happiest he’s ever been.
“I think it’s time we cross the bridge.” Cass looks at the brothers.
“Okay, let’s go,” Dean says standing up.
“Well it’s kinda been a crazy ten tears and now that things have calmed down we just wanted to check in on you. Our, um, well adopted son helped us find you. Long story,” Sam rambles. “Anyway, after you disappeared we never really go the chance to look for you but ya. It’s really good to see you, Jesse.”
Chuck suddenly stands up straight and his eyes flash black. Not like a Demon, but more of a glowing black. He almost doesn’t even look like Chuck anymore. “Hello, Jack.”
Sam sighs. “Okay. We’ll be home in a bit.”
Dean finally gets what he’s always wanted. Him and his family, sitting on a beach, toes in the sand, living as normal a life as possible for 3 hunters, an ex angel and the son of Lucifer. Of course he makes Sam and Cass wear Hawaiian shirts that matched his. They pretend to hate it but on the inside they both love to see Dean so happy.
————————————————————————
“You idiots have literally done this a million times. If I die, the empty wakes up and I can communicate with them. They hate Chuck as much as we do and they owe Jack a favor for him putting everyone in the Empty back to sleep.”
~~~~~~~~~~
“After twelve years of hiding it, yes.”
“Me too,” Sam responds.
Jack grabs Dean and disappears, followed by Jesse.
“I’m sorry to drag you two into this.”
“Something funny?”
Thousands of thoughts and previously undelt with emotions raced through Dean’s mind. "Why didn’t I say it back?" "Maybe if Cass knew that I was something that he COULD have had then he wouldn’t have done what he did and we could have gone out fighting Billie together." "Why didn’t Cass tell me about his deal with the empty earlier? I could have helped him. We could have fixed it, made another deal with the Empty. But no, Cass always has to be 100% selfless and deal with everything on his own." "Why does Cass always have to do the leaving, always have to do the sacrificing? Why didn't he just let me help him?"
Sam snorts, “What?”
Just as Jebediah swings his knife at Jack, Cass appears and takes the blade to his shoulder, yelling in pain and falling to his knees as it pierces all the way through him and comes out the other side.
After a minute, Jesse speaks up. “Maybe we start by talking to Rowena?”
A small group of angels stands around Jack. The group includes Balthazar, Samandriel, Hannah, and Gabriel. Cass is standing at Jack’s side. “Ready?”
“You two ever…?”
“Okay. Never met them. What questions you got?”
“Oh shit.”
“What?” Cass responds.
“Okay, we’re changing location.”
“No, nothing luckily.”
“Or you could let us kill you again. It would save even more lives.” Jack snaps back.
“And why is that?”
“Well, Chuck’s a dick so it fits.”
“Not the kind you are thinking of.”
“Christ, way to sugarcoat it,” Dean mutters.
“Am I missing something here guys?” Dean asks in confusion.
“Or he’s just doing it himself,” Bobby adds.
“I’ve had a long time to practice with my powers. With the right incentive, I can do a lot.”
~~~~~~~~~~
“I should probably get back,” Jack says.
“You remember when the sun started going out and everyone freaked out?”
Jack, Jesse, and Cass fight their way through the crowd toward the house to join the idiotic Lucifer inside. As soon as they enter they find him floating in the air, Chuck’s arm raised towards him. His limbs stretching out in all directions.
“It’s Heaven. I can do whatever I want.”
“She’s still in there.”
“Let’s just go with ‘the odds are not really in our favor but we’re goin’ for it anyway'.”
“So,” Jack says to Jesse, “what led to this decision?”
Dean just shrugs.
“I do.” She slides a matching ring on Sam’s finger.
“Remember, the minute you enter the Empty it’s going to try and put you to sleep but you have to fight it long enough for the Shadow to wake up so you can talk to them.”
“We’ll see about that,” Sam says.
“Right,” Mary says. “So Eileen, tell us more about yourself. Where did you grow up? How did you and Sam meet? I want to hear it all. I know very little since we kind of just missed each other back on earth.”
“Sam!” Jody yells. “You’re techy, come help us set this up.”
“Well I’m all good so you made the trip for no reason.”
“Cain was able to transfer it to Dean, you should be able to pass it on as he did.”
~~~~~~~~~~
WOOSH
“I dunno, maybe I’ll go back to law school. That way I can keep helping people, just in a different way. All I know is that I am done with any job that involves the supernatural.”
“Uh uh uh. Sorry Winchester. We still haven’t made a deal.”
“Actually I’m three. Well in Earth years I would be around fifty I believe.”
“No, no, no! Send me back, I want to go back! Please,” Dean wails, his face buried in his hands.
“Sam’s dead and his body was cremated. It’s literally not even an option.”
“Sorry?”
“Hey!”
“You know that’s not true. This was the only way.”
“Because you let Cass die without telling him how you felt. You told him, well the fake him that’s alive, that you didn’t get the chance to. But in reality, you were just a coward.”
“Then do it for you. Sleep for eternity or stay awake in agony, your choice. I’m really annoying, if you send me out, I’ll just come back again and again and tell you detailed stories about my long career in porn.”
“Will. You. Marry. Me.” Dean over pronounces.
Dean interrupts Cass with a desperate kiss. Dean’s hand on Cass’ cheek, like he isn’t sure what is real anymore. After a moment he pulls away slightly, “Cass? Are you real?” he whispers. Cass just looks at him and nods, eyes wide with shock.
“Believe me, God doesn’t give a fuck about someone being gay or transgender.”
Jesse approaches them slowly as he holds his hand out and Amara lifts theirs up in response. Amara’s eyes close as their arms interlock. The mark on their collarbone glows red as a trail burns down their arm. Jesse gasps as the trail continues onto his hand and up his wrist. He grits his teeth and stumbles back as the mark forms on his forearm.
“The cage. The one I was trapped in. Open it. I can get us in.”
“You don’t understand. All they have to do is…”
“I don’t know.” Cass answers. “I guess he ran away.”
~~~~~~~~~~
“Okay,” Mary breaks the silence, “if the mark was created as a lock and key, could it be used to reveal the cage? Like a locator type thing?”
“I don’t think it’s actually her. I think my baby’s just a part of my heaven.”
“Sounds accurate to his personality.”
“Ya, let him stay here.”
“Boys!” Rowena yells as Sam, Dean, Cass, Jack, and Jesse walk into Hell’s throne room.
“Okay!” Jodi yells. “One minute to midnight!”
“We’re on our way. Get everyone in the bathroom and lock the door.”
“Kelly? How? She’s supposed to be here in heaven.”
“He’s in the bunker.”
They are all talking and laughing, momentarily forgetting about the fight ahead of them, when Jesse appears next to them.
“Then I would say your plan has backfired because here you are in a cell in a new and improved heaven run by Jack, who is about to have you transferred to Hell where you belong, talking to two of the people whose lives you tried to control but failed to.”
“Ya but they’re all assholes. You two met some of them. They tried to eat you.” Gabe gestures at Sam and Dean.
“Is that bad?” Sam asks.
“For how long?”
“Well I don’t sleep so I can just do it,” Jack suggests. “You guys can get some rest.”
“Chuck isn’t the priority right now. You are.”
Cass helps him back onto the bed. “You’ve been in a medically induced coma for two weeks, you need to give yourself time to recover. With the sedatives you have in you, you shouldn’t be able to be awake right now.”
Cass laughs.
“What Angel?”
WOOSH
“I am,” comes a familiar voice from behind them.
~~~~~~~~~~
“Rude,” Lucifer mumbles in response.
“Sammy!” Dean yells, walking in from the kitchen in a ‘Kiss the Cook’ apron.
Lucifer closes his eyes as he stretches out his arm, pulling up his sleeve. The mark burns brightly in the dimly lit room. The ground below them begins to shake violently as a gaping black hole opens up on the ceiling. Not like the one to Lucifer’s cage. This is more like a black hole in space, ready to eat up anything and everything that gets near its entrance, which, in their case, will hopefully be God and his sister.
“How are you feeling, you drank a lot last night.”
~~~~~~~~~~
“What do you mean?”
“We’ve seen what the mark can do,” Charlie says. “Are you sure you want to take that burden?”
“I’m so happy for you, Samuel.”
“Jerk,” Sam pauses. “Wait, what did you mean when you woke up said Cass was there and you needed to go back? Cass has been here this whole time.”
“No.” Dean grabs Cass’ hand. “I’m not letting you out of my sight for the foreseeable future.”
“Ya, Kai and Paige are getting checked out now but they all seem to have gotten by unscathed.”
“Children,” Rowena interrupts, “I believe we have more important things to be thinking about at this moment.”
As everyone celebrates, Cass and Dean just look at each other. “Happy New Year Cass.”
“You were always the smart one.” Dean pauses for a moment, maybe his emery of Bobby will be enough to give him some insight. “Hey Bobby?”
“Well, Jack absorbed the power from Chuck right?”
“I’ll do my best Sam.” Jack says with his classic childlike innocence. As if he didn’t just battle God himself. In reality though, Jack was just a child. He was only born three years ago.
“Yes you do. We’ll do one from that mixtape I gave you.”
Dean and Cass roll their eyes as Eileen and Mary laugh.
“Ha! That means nothing to me. I wouldn’t keep my word on that so why would you?”
“Well his heart was missing and no bones were broken,” Eileen explains. “Doesn’t exactly match the injuries a person would get if they were hit by a car.”
“Still. He was human, so I know it feels different.”
“He’s gonna be okay Dean,” Eileen says, placing her hand on Dean's shoulder. “They all are.”
WOOSH
“I think it might be time I tell you what little Gabriel and my’s deal was. My conditions for, you know, saving the world.”
“It’s been like 3 minutes.”
“But not smite him because we don’t want to kill the people in the surrounding area since they have moved to the middle of Los Angelos. Probably so we can’t do that unless we are willing to kill millions.”
“I don’t think there’s anything we can do,” Sam says sighing. “We just wait I guess.”
“Yes?” Dean responds to his fake name.
“So… that’s the plan,” Jack says awkwardly, looking around the room at all of the angels of Heaven. Everyone is looking at each other, waiting for someone to say something.
“I’m only going to kiss you as long as you promise not to die this year.”
“I love this man,” Charlie says as she turns to join him.
“I can’t let you suffer anymore.” Jack smiles tearfully at his mom before he disappears.
A tear runs out the corner of Jack’s eye and down his temple. “I heard you guys talking. I know what it is. I deserve it, Cass. I’ve lied to everyone. I’ve hurt people. I hurt you and Sam and Dean. I- I killed Mary. I deserve this, Cass. Because that sword was created to punish people like me. It’s doing exactly what it’s meant to.”
“I’m coming.”
“I’m sorry, I had prayers kinda turned off while I was working on things in Heaven.” Jack looks around. “Why are we in a hospital?”
“What?” Jesse asks.
“Well, the spell was originally supposed to turn Jack into a cosmic bomb to kill Chuck and Amara. He had to go through a bunch of trials to do it. But right after he lit the fuse, Chuck absorbed Amara and escaped, leaving Jack about to blow. So Billie, or Death, sent him to the Empty to blow up in there. After that, he became a power vacuum but we don’t exactly know how.”
“Who’s going to stop us?”
Dean makes a fake sad face.
“Of course.”
Just when they were starting to think he wasn’t home, they hear multiple locks click and the door swings open. The boy they knew all those years ago is standing there, a neutral but tired expression across his face. He hasn’t lost his baby face but has grown taller, although he’s still significantly shorter than the three of them. His baggy white t-shirt and worn jeans show off his thin frame.
“Hi, Sam. Hey Dean. Long time.”
Sam, Dean, Gabe, Eileen, and Bobby are all sitting at the table surrounded by books when Cass walks in followed by Jack and Jesse.
“So what if you become Death? Michael can send you back in time, you can get the ring from the original death, he can bring you back to this time, then you can put on the ring, retrieve Cass from the empty, then return the ring back to the past so the timeline remains in tact.”
Jack smiles, not even having to ask, they have always been really obvious. He’s just happy to see them finally happy, together. “No. You guys were the ones who did all the hard work and took all the hits, literally.”
“Oh ya. It killed a gay dude and healed you.”
Cass is on top of Dean on the couch, when Gabe bursts in. Luckily they are still partially clothed. “Whoa! Get a room you two.”
“We’ll keep you updated on the case,” Sam adds.
Donna whistles and Dean flips her off as he pulls Cass in to look at the list on the back of the tape to chose a song. Cass points to a song on the list and Dean smiles and nods, turning to the machine to load up the song. Cass hesitantly picks up a mic.
“What?”
“Of course I do. I lost the only person left in this world that I cared about.”
“I think it sounds too good and important for someone like me.”
“You okay there?”
“He’s not a bad guy. Cassie.”
“I do.” He slips a gold ring embedded with a part of his grace on Dean’s finger.
“You’re disgusting.”
“Do you want me to take you somewhere?” Jack asks.
Dean takes a seat next to Cass and picks up a book from the ‘unread’ pile. “Well, what if we removed his grace and then he did it. Would that prevent his from being split like that?”
“What do I do?” Jack whispers to Cass.
“So I die and Chuck gets his power back right? That’s what you think’ll happen?” Jebediah looks at him emotionlessly. “Cause that’s not going to work anymore.”
“You ran youth group?” Sam asks.
“When you said you lived in a bunker I expected one of those end-time bunkers, not a vacation home for billionaires.”
“Long time Brother.”
~~~~~~~~~~
“I was at work until 5 then I came straight home and ate the dinner my lovely wife made.”
She nods. “Now go. He’s breaking through.”
“Well you clearly don’t like him and we’ve heard that you’ve been threatening and aggressive towards him in the past,” Eileen explains.
Whoosh
“Okay well let me know what I can do to help.”
Sam nods.
“I promise that I will come back to you.”
“So what’s the end goal here?” Jesse says after a moment.
“Hi, thanks for calling,” he says hesitantly. “Um, could we meet in person? There’s a park a few blocks from the church.”
The next second Dean is in Chicago. “Fuck,” he says to himself. Its May 6, 2010, when he first met Death, during the time that they were trying to re-cage Lucifer.
“Well, I’m just too important for that aren’t I.”
“Dick move.”
“I’ll let you know if I hear anything else.”
Balthazar rolls his eyes and snaps his fingers. The pie appears in Dean’s hand. I really don’t wanna wake up Dean thinks, only partially joking.
“Pretty much.”
“No matter. At least you’re here now.” She turns to Sam. “Samuel, good to see you again.”
Dean jumps up, “Where have you been? We never heard anything from you in like ten years? What the hell happened to you?”
“Jack…”
“How do you know about that?”
“The world needed help. And you boys were the only ones that stepped up to the plate.”
“Sometimes you must do a small wrong to fix a big one.”
“Haha,” Dean says sarcastically. “No, we’re getting married and you guys are too.”
Dean sighs and places his hand on Jack’s arm.
Cass and Billie were gone. The status of the rest of the world unknown to Dean. He sits, alone, on the floor of the dungeon, staring numbly into space, while his phone rings over and over again, Sam panicking more and more with every unanswered call to Dean.
“Jack!” Cass yells, running up to his son and giving him a hug.
“Castiel,” comes a slow gruff voice from behind him.
“Yep, Empty’s back to sleep, I just got back from returning the ring, saw my younger self, really weird, Death says hi by the way.”
“I’m right here.”
After a few hours of catching up a doctor approaches their table. “Robert Bowie?” She asks.
“Ya but we don’t have to do that now,” Sam says. “We won, and that’s all that matters. Let’s call Jack. He’ll be anxious to see you.”
“No, you’re right. This is why you’re the smart one.”
“They gave me that name. It was an alternative translation for ‘the Angel of Thursday,” which was their title. After they fell it was the title I took on.”
Everyone is getting restless and worried. Jack and Cass have been gone for hours. And since time is weird as hell in Heaven, no one has any idea how long it’s been on Earth.
Cass returns the smile as she turns to head back to her wife.
“Oh hon, you’re not going anywhere.”
“It was my pleasure.”
“Ya. So let’s get started.” Jack says.
“So, what is it that you need from me?”
“I think he forgave himself or something. This blue light just started coming out of the cut.”
“I don’t know. Maybe he wanted to break his spirit or something. I- something just doesn’t add up.”
“Amara?” Jack asks.
“Release him.” Jack commands.
“Yes. I can sense them inside. But there’s no wardings or spells or anything on the building.”
“I can come too,” Jack says.
“Pastor. He told the guy when he was 16 that he deserved the wrath of God just for coming out as trans. Maybe when God didn’t act, he did.”
“Thank you Sam.” He turns to Michael. “Okay, I’m ready.” And with that they both were gone.
“Whatever happened Dean, it’s not your fault, none of this is anyone’s fault but Chucks.” Sam voices, trying to stay strong for Dean’s sake. Dean was always the strong one, but now it was his turn to grieve. They all lost people they loved today, but he’s never seen him like this before, he knows why of course, he’s always known.
“I wish I had your mindset.”
“You didn’t kill me last time. What makes you think you have the guts to do it now?”
Gabe nods and gestures for Cass to get on with it. Cass slowly tilts the blade up at Gabe’s stomach, his eyes full of hesitation and fear for his brother. Sensing this hesitation, Gabe steps forward and smiles, placing his hand up on top of Cass’ shoulder.
“Jack, is Cass-”
“So what are you doing now? What else needs to be done in Heaven?” Eileen asks after a moment.
“Oh no! I’m so scared!” Chuck says sarcastically. “I’ve died once before, I’ll just come back again. And have you met the Winchesters? You would sacrifice the world for family, they would never forgive you for letting this Dean die. And you just got their forgiveness, didn’t you, Jack?”
The blows against him stop as Chuck’s eyes darken, turning towards his confused foes, “Do it now! I’ve got him but not for long.”
Cass straightens up as Jack stumbles back, Dean catching him before he falls.
“Ya. I got married, kinda, we were both legally dead so it wasn’t official, but her name’s Eileen. You have to meet her she’s amazing. She was a hunter too but we were able to retire and have a son. You’re a Grandma.”
“Chuck has been broken out of his cell by a reaper and a rogue group of angels. Have you heard anything regarding Chuck or not wanting Jack to be in power?”
Sam, Dean, Jack, and Cass all stand in the main room of the bunker, each of them holding a bag or two. Sam and Dean look at each other and nod. They both pull out a knife. Sam handing his to Jack and Dean to Cass. “Before we go it’s your turns.” Sam says.
“It appears that they’re still at your house, Sam,” Jack says after reappearing. “I’m not sure why.”
“How ‘bout you guys talk for a bit then you can decide whether or not you really want to bail him out.”
Sam gives Cass an amused look. “Good luck man.”
“Trade what.”
“I could help you out I guess.”
“Demons and Angels are one thing but God? Way above my pay grade. I don’t even know where to start.” Rufus says gruffly.
“Jebediah. What are you doing?”
“We can’t just stand here. You’ll go insane.”
“Then, by the power vested in me by Jack, I now pronounce you spouses for eternity, you may now kiss your partner!
Jack looks to Cass and nods.“Ol gift yls oi lansh.” Jack places his hand on Hades’. Both of their eyes glow orange and a stream of energy exits Jack’s mouth and enters Hades’. Jack stumbles back.
“Oh awesome. Ya got any Advil or something.” Dean takes another drink.
“I’m pathetic,” he groans to himself.
“No, you’re not. But we’re going to fix you up. You’ll be healed in no time.” Jack doesn’t respond, he just stares up at the ceiling. “Listen, Jack. Cass told me what said. About you deserving this for hurting us, an- and killing our mom.” Dean sighs and closes his eyes. “I need you to know that I forgive you. Actually, no, there’s no need for me to forgive you because it wasn’t your fault, Jack because you didn’t have a soul. And it wasn’t your fault that you didn’t have a soul. You lost it because you saved us. Then even though I was terrible to you, you saved us again and again. Then you saved the entire world and took on another huge burden. And now you’re dying and in pain again because you were trying to protect the world that you sacrificed so much to save and you think you deserve it. And that’s bullshit. That’s absolute bullshit, Jack. You deserve nothing but a peaceful, happy life, but we don’t always get what we deserve and that’s why you’re in pain and Chuck is free. And I can’t explain why this is happening to you but I can tell you that it is not what you deserve. You understand me?”
“Well, there’s a first time for everything.”
~~~~~~~~~~
Sam nods, “he deserves a normal life. He shouldn’t have to be worried about his Grandpa murdering him for his powers.”
“I was at my hunting cabin so I was up near Inavale. Left Sunday got back Wednesday. I guess that was yesterday.”
~~~~~~~~~~
“We don’t even know what he did yet,” Cass reasons.
“Sammy!” Dean yells, bursting into Sam and Eileen’s house, dragging Cass behind him.
“That’s nice that it appears like I have a life. I move cities every few months.”
Dean sighs. “I dunno man. Jack’s just a kid. He shouldn’t even have to be making these decisions.”
I squealed so many times writing this. Couldn't stop smiling and/or crying.
~~~~~~~~~~
“It better.” He grabs Cass and pulls him in for a hug. Both of them with their eyes closed, clinging to each other like it’s the last time because both of them know that there’s always a chance that it could be. Cass buries his head in Dean’s shoulder, not wanting to let go, ever. “I love you,” Dean whispers in Cass’ ear.
After a few minutes of congratulations and hugs, Lisa and Cassie approach Dean and Cass.
“What do you mean ‘forgive’s himself'?” Sam asks.
“I found them. The countryside of Ireland.”
Dean reappeared in front of Sam, Jesse, Jack, Rowena and Michael. To them it had only been a second. “I got the ring,” Dean said smiling. “Now time for the actual hard part.”
“And thank you for finally being the one with enough balls to confess how you felt.” She shoots Dean an eye-roll.
Jesse nods and releases Lucifer, then pulling up his sleeve to reveal the Mark, glowing brightly in the presence of its true owner. Jesse’s hand grasps Lucifer’s forearm. Without having to do anything, a glowing trail makes its way down Jesse’s arm towards Lucifer, desperate to return to its master. Jesse grits his teeth in as the Mark leaves his body.
“True,” Sam responds, “We should probably figure out a way to keep tabs on him. Make sure he isn’t causing any trouble or anything.”
“Jack are you okay? What happened?” Cass says when Jack appears in the room, face covered in tears and nearly hyperventilating.
The battle starts
“By killing demons?”
“You,” Cass and Dean say in unison.
“Not much longer. The final pieces are all falling into place. I just need to finish up some individual heavens for the angels, demons, and monsters.”
“What? Like Sam did with Lucifer?”
“When’s this happening?” Sam asks.
“So, what finally got ya?”
“Yes, it is possible. If anyone can do it it’s Jack.”
“That’s where he is at this moment but it’s dangerous for him to even be in Heaven. Some of the angels have expressed some loyalty to Chuck and may try and communicate with him. Which can’t happen. He could convince them to do something to disrupt the Heaven that we’ve created.”
“That beeping.”
“God my hair.” Sam laughs.
“Gotta trust your gut, Sammy.”
“I second that,” Sam says, switching the TV over to Netflix.
“Okay. I hope he can fill in some blanks.”
“And Eva.” Sam adds.
“Amara broke through and talked to us.”
Sam walks up and snaps the warded handcuffs on the archangel’s wrists, “Fuck off, Lucifer.”
“I’m not sure if I’m ever gonna get used to this.” Cass looks at Dean quizzically. “I’ve been in denial for so long that repression has just become second nature. But now that I can just outright tell you how I feel whenever I want to… I dunno… it kinda just feels like I’m dreaming and am about to wake up.”
“Okay. Forgive me Father for I have sinned. My birth was a sin in itself. My mother was a human and my father was the archangel, Lucifer. The first thing I did when I was born was kill my mother, not intentionally but still, she would have lived a long life if I hadn’t been born.”
“Thanks.”
“It’s kinda a mix of both. Like an end-time bunker for billionaires but with a paranormal twist.”
Dean releases the door handle and turns back to Chuck.
“Is that a glimmer of optimism I sense?” Dean drapes his arm across Cass’ shoulders and pulls him close.
“You guys are so gross.”
“We’ll see about that,” Jack says as he walks over to undo the locks on the handcuffs tethering Jesse to the ceiling, he looks no older than twenty, even though he should be pushing seventy. “Cass, watch Jesse while I take her back to Heaven’s prison.” Cass nods as Jack and Atara disappear.
“I’m not sure I do deserve it.”
“I love you too.”
“Good right now. Bad for later on,” Dean mumbles.
Sam, Dean, Cass, Jack, Eileen, John, Mary, Gabe, Bobby, Rufus, Charlie, Ash, Kevin, Jesse, and Rowena all sit at a large table covered in books. Sam, Ash, Kevin and Charlie are on their laptops.
“I have… I do. I… I love him.”
“Look.”
Cass looks over at the others and they all nod. “Can you kill him but not Amara?”
“Yes?”
I had so much fun writing this fic!! I hope everyone enjoyed it as much as me :) I feel like it helped me get more closure for the show. I never wrote anything until after the finale and I'm pretty proud of both of the fics I've written just because of how they made me feel.
Okay someone please let me know if I'm the only one who loves these types of plot twists. If y'all hate it, I'll rewrite it :) The only way I can justify the finale is if it wasn't real so that's why I went this route.
“Well if she is keeping him in check then being with him is a good thing. But if she was out, she could tell us what they are trying to do. And she’s as old as Chuck is so she pretty much knows everything and could tell us how to stop it.”
“Well you don’t have to lie to yourself or anyone else ever again.”
“Wait you were here in the bunker?” Sam says.
“What sins has Jack committed? He saved the fucking world. And he’s like the most innocent person in the universe. He’s never done anything wro-” Dean stops mid-word, a sudden realization draining all the color from his face. “Mom,” he whispers.
“We do too.”
Sam sticks his tongue out at her.
“What would you do if you accidentally hurt Dean? Huh?”
“Do you need us to help you forward?!” Jesse yells over the howling wind.
“Thank you, Bobby,” Cass says.
“Who you visiting first?” Dean asks.
“It was part of the deal.” Cass says
“That’s the best idea that you have ever had.” Dean leans over and gives Cass a kiss. Dean pulls away and smiles, looking into Cass’ eyes. Cass smiles back and grabs Dean’s hand. When they look back at Sam and Eileen after a moment Sam is smiling at them like an overly enthusiastic puppy dog. “Way to be subtle Sammy.”
~~~~~~~~~~
Dean, Cass, Sam, and Eileen sit in the hospital cafeteria eating shitty food. Dean is free to go once the doctors get the results back from the final test. They say Dean is lucky to be alive, let alone be able to walk. The nail was millimeters away from severing his spinal cord, which would have meant lifelong paralysis.
“Promise me.”
“And I’m not sure what I’m going to tell Dad.” Dean mumbles.
“I know that. But it will prevent me from harming others.”
“Ya, it’s like-”
“Dean-,”
“I was in a coma for a few weeks but I’m pretty much all good now.”
~~~~~~~~~~
The room is calm and quiet, like the two most powerful beings in the universe didn’t just get locked away.
Sam wakes up to his phone ringing at around 4 AM. He groans and rolls over, the movement waking up Eileen as well.
“It shouldn’t be an issue. If anything they will eventually complement each other.”
“When was that in regard to Cara and Maggie’s deaths?”
“But God eliminated everyone. He’s gone.”
“No, I mean, the local church wasn’t very fond of him.”
Jack swallows and shakes his head. “That’s not going to happen. Now release my Mom and Rowena and leave us alone.”
“What the fuck?” Sam presses the green button. “Hello?”
“Shit. I gotta go. Go say hi to Bobby while I’m gone, he’ll be happy to see you.”
“I’m sorry, Cass.”
They move closer. “Did you get a new vessel?”
“It is not our place to question his decisions.”
“No, I get it, you need me. Not surprising, I’m amazing. But if you think I’ll help you dipshits just to get the hell out of this place then you’re sorely mistaken.”
“All of us have either tried or succeeded at killing at least one person in this room, so let’s just call all of us even,” Gabriel says.
“Yes,” Mary answers taking the pen and writing the address, not reacting to the silver.
“And the Shadow?” Eileen asks.
Dean can’t help but laugh to himself watching Cass and Gabe walk together due to the height difference. But that thought is quickly pushed aside by how handsome Cass looks. His eyes almost glow in the sunlight. He quickly glances over at Sam, who is clearly unable to contain how much love he has for Eileen. He is looking at her like she’s the only person in the world. Dean has to admit, she looks absolutely gorgeous, but to him, nothing compares to Cass right now.
“Because you don’t know anything different. But you do know that you don’t really deserve peace.”
“Wait, what?”
“That was an entirely different case! And I was cursed.”
“Dean! Dean what happened? I’ve been calling you for hours? Why did you answer your phone? I thought you were dead.” Dean didn’t respond. “Where’s Cass? What heppened with Billie?" No response. "Everyone’s gone, Dean. Billie killed everyone. Dean? What happened?”
“I can’t tell if that team-up is going to be genius or destructive,” Sam says to Dean.
“I got past that a long time ago. No sense getting pissed over things I can’t do anything about, right?”
“Ok, you can lie about some things.”
“Okay human,” Cass jokes.
“But I’m your Daddy.”
Dean doesn’t say or do anything.
“What about Jesse?” Sam asks. “He has more power than you now. He could protect you and Kelly.”
“One second he was here, the next second was gone.”
“So if we’re gonna transfer power from Jack, we probably need to do some variation of the spell he used to take the power from Chuck in the first place. So what exactly was the spell?”
~~~~~~~~~~
By the time that Cass strikes down the last angel and Leviathan, another two of the angels had been killed. He looks across the cemetery in despair. The dead lie everywhere. He can’t even tell who is on which side anymore. It’s just a mass of bodies. The only individual he can make out is Jack, who is stumbling back as Jebediah stands over him, knife raised.
“I don’t think so. But I don’t know what happens when they share their power with as many people as you guys are talking about.”
“I’m here for Cass. Where is he.”
“You were supposed to be my mentor. Train me to fight for heaven and humanity. But instead, you left.”
“I’m sure our parents, Rufus, and Bobby would be willing too,” Sam adds.
“Not a chance,” Dean says sternly.
“No, you thought what we all did, that Chuck was the problem. But maybe we’re just even more flawed than humanity is.”
“Wait! Please.”
“Just by a couple hundred million years,” Dean says.
~~~~~~~~~~
“What do you think? Punish my father for abandoning me.”
Jack cracks a small smile and nods.
“Good luck. Let me know if you want me to come up and help tomorrow.”
“I- nothing I guess. They have no power anymore so they are human but are like conjoined twins.”
“Nothing.” Dean answers.
“Where. Is. He?” Dean says through his teeth.
“Me too.” Jesse says as they pull away. “But since when is the world ever fair.”
“Me too. It’s nice to take a break.”
“And why not?”
“Hello, Dean.”
“I’m already half Demon, how much worse could it get?”
~~~~~~~~~~
“Well right now I guess we might need to fight chaos with chaos.”
“We have some questions about the spell that you used to get the Mark off of Dean,” Cass responds.
“I’m already dead. What’s the worst that could happen?”
“I guess I have more daddy issues than I thought I did,” Dean says, messing with Sam further.
“You two danced around your feelings for each other for 12 freaking years! I can put up with the obvious sexual tension, eye fucking, and pathetic pining but this is where I draw the line! So you go find him right now and tell him you love him you emotionally constipated mess of a human being!”
“Fine.”
Sam clears his throat. “Um a bit more specific of instructions. We need to figure out a way to keep them from hurting Kelly while also keeping them from killing Jack and getting Chuck back his powers. Maybe a way to remove the spell from Kelly? Or some way to make the power unable to leave Jack. Anything.”
~~~~~~~~~~
“I can’t do that.”
“This is weird. You guys look younger than us.”
“Battle’s over. Chuck’s really gone. Are ya gonna get bored without having some crisis to deal with?”
“Doesn’t matter. Once he’s in the cage we’ll never have to see or think about him ever again. Anyway, how’s Rowena doing? Anything new?”
“You betcha,” says Donna, walking up and hugging Sam. “What happened?”	“It wasn’t Billie, it was Chuck. He killed every human and animal except Dean, Jack and I. But he missed some of the others. Long story short, he’s gone and Michael and Jack got everyone back. They’re gonna alter the memories of the people who don’t know about any of this stuff so they won’t remember what happened.”
“Because this isn’t when you die. When it is, we’ll let you know.”
“It was my pleasure.”
“Jack,” Father Jackson interrupts. “None of that was your fault. All of that happened because you were trusting and selfless and kind. Have you made mistakes? Yes, but we all have. I don’t think you needed to confess your sins as much as you need to forgive yourself. You believe you deserve the pain and that is why the sword’s curse is affecting you. You are cleansed of your sins and are forgiven in my eyes, so all you need to do is forgive yourself, Jack.”
My favorite chapter yet! Had so much fun writing this. Hope you all enjoy it!!!
“If you got hurt, I swear…”
~~~~~~~~~~
“We already knew about Atara but thank you. We will go search for Moriah.”
“Sorry?”
~~~~~~~~~~
“Do you think they’ll actually kill Chuck?” Dean asks Cass who is looking at the floor, not paying attention. “Cass,” Dean nudges him.
“I’m sorry?”
“It isn’t that stupid,” Jack jumps in.
“Yes, I am too weak at this moment but give me some time to recover and it will be done. I’ll need Jack’s help of course. ”
“Stay on the phone, we’ll be right there.”
“I don’t know, Sam. It doesn’t make any sense. I can’t think of anyone with that type of power.”
“Then is there a way for us to see who wasn’t reaping at the time that Chuck was broken out.”
The song ends and everyone cheers at their performance. Dean pecks Cass on the cheek and they walk away from the machine. “I need a break, it’s someone else’s turn,” Dean says before he takes a drink from his glass of beer.
“Sam, Dean, Jack”
“They were teenagers that went to your church. Maggie and Cara were killed a year ago and Edward was killed on Monday.”
Tears run down Dean's face. “I’m sorry Sammy,” he whispers, standing up and walking away.
“One was never created. I don’t think it was intended to have a cure.” Cass leans against the wall in hopelessness.
“Now?” Cass asks.
“Just give up Amara, you’re not going to win this.” Chuck’s vessel sits on the floor of the small cabin. A dozen or more Angels stand around him with confused and concerned facial expressions.
“No one’s that good at acting. And he took his brother in after he was kicked out, he cared about him too much to hurt him. I guess it’s mostly just intuition.”
“Who are you and why did you rescue Chuck.”
“I’ve killed people.”
Jesse and Jack reappear in the apartment where Sam, Dean, Cass, and Eileen are sitting in silence. Lucy is laying on Dean’s lap, asleep.
“I like being King. And I want Heaven and Hell. No more battles or fighting, one King for both.”
“It’s okay. Jack came to see me. He filled me in. I’m so proud of you.” She turns to Sam and gives him a hug. “Both of you”
“I suspected it at first but then he died so soon after so how could it have been him?”
“Cass. He’s going to kill you.”
“You mean beside our Dad? Umm the pastor mostly. He told us both we were going to Hell and deserved the wrath of God.”
“Okay,” Cass says sadly, giving Jack one more hug.
“Let us know if you need a break or some company or anything,” Dean says standing up and pulling Cass with him.
“Ya. Just a crazy dude that happened to be a werewolf.”
“Benny. Hello.”
“I just need some rest and I’ll be fine.”
“Yes, we heard about that, we’re sorry for your loss. Is there any other way that we can confirm your location? Did you stop anywhere like a gas station or grocery store?” Sam asks.
“Maybe. How’s Jack doing?”
“Gabriel, are you listening?”
“Well, those times are over. Eat.”
Jesse nods.
“So… what do we do?”
“I think so.” Jack breaths heavily. He stands and pulls up his shirt to reveal that his chest is fully healed. Not even a scar remains.
Patience pecks Jesse on the cheek and says, “I hope I get to know you better this year.”
“But who knows how many angels they actually have. They could have an army. They could have hundreds of other beings for all we know.”
“What are you talking about Jack? You matter to me, and Dean, and Sam, and everyone else on this planet. You’re a hero Jack. And you’re my son. So you are not dying and you are not going back to the empty. Because I am not going to let that happen. You hear me?”
“No, but I’m guessing that it has something to do with reversing the spell that allowed me to drain the power from Chuck.”
Cass looks down at the table reminiscing about the last time he was here. Glancing over at the Winchesters' initials he realizes that there is more there. Looking closer he starts to tear up. “Jack.”
“Jack,” comes a voice from behind him.
Cass and Gabriel walk into Bobby's house. Sam, Dean, Bobby, Eileen, and Jesse are standing around a large, leather-bound book. “Did you guys find anything?”
“And this dumbass decided it would be a brilliant idea to run and jump off the bridge and jump into the mud instead of just holding onto the side.”
“It was my decision. I just want to live out life like a normal person and when I die, not go to the Empty.”
~~~~~~~~~~
“Rowena!”
Sam hesitated, “I’m sorry, I really am. But that means you know why Chuck needs to be stopped.”
Dean turns to see Bobby. He manages a smile. “No reason.” Why am I lying to myself? He thinks.
“Long story. Involves Abbadon, the Mark of Cain and dying.”
“That’s not going to happen. Chuck needs to be either fully contained or killed. It’s the only way everything will end.”
Dean laughs quietly and plants a kiss on the angel's lips before leaning their foreheads together. “Come back to me.”
“Okay old man,” Dean teases.
“Man you are so much like Lucifer,” Sam mutters.
~~~~~~~~~~
“You too.”
“When is anything ever that easy in our lives?”
“Yes. I’m so sorry. This is all my fault. I gave into him, I was weak. But not anymore. My brother is a monster and he needs to be stopped again. And this time I will help you.”
“What am I a messenger boy?”
“But what if something happens to you? Jack can’t get you from the Empty anymore. I can’t lose you again.”
“Ya,” Sam says sadly. “Me too.”
“Because he has an unknown number of angels, reapers, Death, and a very powerful witch fighting on his behalf.” The group is silent.
“Rowena, we have a problem.” Jack looks around the empty throne room. “Rowena? Rowena?” Jack makes his way into the next room. Bodies with burnt-out eyes surround Rowena chained to a chair, her face bloodied and bruised.”
John holds out his hand hesitantly. “Good to meet ya, Cass. I’m John.”
“Wait!” Jack steps forward. “Just tell us. What are you going to do to him?”
“We appreciate that. Our questions relate to your late husband. Are you comfortable discussing that?”
Jesse nods. “So is anyone going to come with me or is this a solo mission?”
“Yes you do,” everyone says in unison.
Gabriel stumbles around the dark void yelling weakly, fighting to stay awake. “Hey!!! Yo Shadow thingy! Wake up! We need to talk.”
“Ok sounds good.”
“Cassiel.”
“Can you tell who’s in control right now?” Cass asks.
Dean chuckles, “I have a sugar daddy.”
“I don’t need your sass Lover Boy. I want Daddy locked up just as much as the next Angel.”
The pastor’s eyes get wide with surprise at Sam’s outright insult. “I’m not sure I should even answer you while you’re being so disrespectful.”
“Sorry, I appeared on the porch right as you bolted off.”
“That's why they deserve to live the rest of their lives on a lifeless, empty planet. Slowly dying alone. The perfect end to their rebellious and pathetic story. To live for years knowing that they failed in the fight that mattered most. It’s… poetic.”
“Why would I do that? This was my plan.”
“Are you sure?” Cass asks.
“Are Micah and the others in a safe place at least?” Dean asks.
“She’s over there,” Claire points to a group of hunters, “filling some people in on what’s happening.”
Some kids are killed in a nearby town so Eileen and Sam go to check it out while Cass and Dean get Jesse settled in.
“Setting things right.”
“Do you have a better idea?”
“Dean,” comes a gruff voice from behind him.
Dean is able to collect himself enough to finally respond. “That only applies to brides. Besides, I wanted to be the first one to see you.”
“No idea,” Sam responds. “But I think I’ll go get Eileen and fill her in.”
Cass smiles as he presses his face into Dean’s neck. “Not as much optimism as pure stubbornness. We’ve been through too much for us to lose now. I’m not going to let this be the end,” he stops them and looks at Dean. “Because we’re just beginning.”
He makes a sour face, realizing she’s deaf. He turns back to Sam like he’s too good to talk to her, causing Eileen to roll her eyes.
“Either way, I can handle it.”
Jesse appears at his side. “What’s happening?”
“He’s not worth it Dean. He’s just bitter.”
“Whatever. It doesn’t matter. Everything turned out well in the end.”
“I was never the bad guy, you all just had no sense of humor.”
“You were supposed to come alone.”
Finally, someone speaks up, “That’s it? We’re going to rely on the Darkness and Lucifer to save the world?”
“No way, I want to punch them.”
“We could bail him out and keep him in the dungeon until his court date?” Sam suggests.
“I think it’s 'cause we’re both dumb-asses.”
John finally looks at Dean before turning to Sam. “Is there any way for us to see what’s happening on Earth?”
“Dean, you know what I’m talking about because, in reality, I’m you. The only real Sammy is the one whose voice is echoing in your mind, trying to bring you back to the land of the living.”
Cass shakes his head. “Bullshit.”
The Winchesters walk into Bobby’s house to find everyone had beat them there. Jody, Donna, Charlie, Ash, Ellen, Jo, Kevin, Ms. Tran, Rufus, Missouri, Mick, and a bunch more people that they didn’t even recognize. Eileen is standing with a younger couple and an older woman that Sam recognizes as her parents and the woman who raised her. Jesse is sitting in the back looking through a book. Before they can say anything Charlie runs up and tackles them both.
“I’m fine. It was just a little stab wound. Jack took the worst of it.”
“So is that a yes…?”
“This isn’t real.”
“Poor kid,” Cass says.
“We’re going to figure this out Cass,” Dean says placing his hand on Cass’ shoulder. “I promise. He’s going to be okay.”
“Some hunters found them a few years ago.”
“She’s still in there.”
“I promise. But you’re not allowed to die either.”
It’s just past 10:45 by the time they get everything set up. Everyone is standing around the room as Dean and Claire sing “Eye of the Tiger” surprisingly well. Meanwhile, Sam and Alex are discussing her work at the hospital on the other side of the room and Cass is laughing with Eileen at Dean and Claire’s performance. Kaia is watching from the chair in the corner, smiling while Jesse, Patience, Donna, and Jody are dancing.
“I’m not having this conversation with you.”
Jesse puts his arm on the table, leans back in the chair, and closes his eyes.
Charlie pulls back, “No. Stop. It wasn’t your fault.” Sam smiles. “Besides, we got bigger problems now. Let’s go save the world!”
They get to the top of the third flight of stairs before they say anything to each other. “Who should be in front?” Sam asks.
“Yes?”
“Na, whatever you got goin’ on in there I don’t want it.”
“Well mostly just Sam, Cass, and I,” Dean walks up to Cass and wraps his arm around his shoulders. “Eileen was dead for the first part of his life.”
Dean turns to face it, holding back tears of desperation. “Do we have a deal or not?”
“Because I don’t want them to hate me, you guys already do.”
“I’ll leave you alone to talk,” Cass says, turning towards the door.
“What!” Charlie interjects. “And no one told me!”
Dean wakes up the next day on the floor of his bedroom. He has no idea how he got there but he knows he’s hungover as hell. Unwanted emotions start flooding back into his mind so, of course, he takes another gulp from the whiskey bottle that’s on the floor next to him to push them back down.
“Hmmm I think I’ll leave you hanging for now,” Dean leans over and whispers in his ear. “Then after this is all over I can show you.”
Jesse smiles and takes a big bite of the burger, he clearly hasn’t eaten much recently.
“Maybe he’s turned off prayers or something? He did say he was gonna be hands-off.”
“Thanks. I’m glad I wasn’t able to kill you.”
~~~~~~~~~~
“Where were you Monday, December 28th from 4 PM to 8 PM?”
“Just wanted to see how pathetic you are and tell you once again that you lost.”
“Chuck is contained. And I’m not going to let you ruin things for me again, Castiel.” They drop their blade into their hand
Patience nods and they share a quick kiss like awkward middle-schoolers.
Jack disappears and Sam and Rowena are left alone. “So, how did the rest of your life unfold?”
“Okay, we should probably head back to the others then.”
“Dead I know but not there he wasn’t dead there. You-you can’t understand, the person you love is alive, mine isn’t. But he- he was there, we were happy, I need to go back. Sammy, I need him, I-”
“I don’t recognize you.”
“Well, we’re in Kansas now. You might not want to go home for a while, we can let know when it’s safe.”
“I should have just let him kill me.”
“I’m Agent Halen, this is my partner Agent Hoth, we’re investigating the death of your brother, Edward.”
“And why would I do that?”
“You don’t deserve to be God. You didn’t create the Earth, he did. We’re just trying to set Heaven right.”
Dean and Eric nod.
“I don’t know. He didn’t exactly tell me of his plans at the time. But the archangels, they helped him. One of them might know.”
“Thank you. I WILL bring it back, I promise.”
“Ready?” He asks.
~~~~~~~~~~
“I love you too Dean Winchester.”
“Texas. He has a whole other army. Much bigger than the one we just faced”
~~~~~~~~~~
“Thank you, Moriah.”
“Why?”
“Do-,” Bobby’s voice cracks when he attempts to finish. He takes a deep breath.  “Samuel, do you take Eileen to be your lawfully wedded wife? I’m not even going to say the rest since you’re already dead.”
“Dean.”
“Dean, do you take Castiel to be your lawfully wedded husband?”
“We don’t know for sure. It’s entirely possible that it could rip him apart. His human soul dying and remaining here while his angelic half remains intact in his body. We could end up with another soulless Jack but this time without any human qualities or thought processes.”
~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~
“But that doesn’t mean you can’t celebrate,” Jo adds.
Cass smiles. “Okay.”
“I wouldn’t wish that douchebag on any of the monsters in Purgatory,” Dean mutters.
“So back to Charlie’s original plan. We find a god.”
“I don’t know. I’ve been human the whole time I’ve been back and haven’t heard anything from Jack since he delivered me back to Earth.”
“I like your old trench coat better.”
“Charlie!” Dean almost yells. His smile turns to tears.
“Wow. You’ve done more in a few years than Chuck has done in centuries. I really am proud of you. Dean would agree but he and Cass are busy catching up.”
“But what if they hurt you? Jack can’t protect you the whole time.”
Eileen glances at her watch, “twenty minutes.”
After Dean releases Jack he turns to Michael, and holds out his hand for a handshake. “It couldn’t have happened without you. The world will be eternally grateful for what you have done here.”
Dean pulls the blanket off of Jack and placed his hand on his forehead. “Ya, you definitely have a fever. How is that even possible? We’re in freaking Heaven for God’s sake.”
“Or Amara is getting stronger and Chuck is getting weaker.”
“Jack has been through so much. He didn’t need to deal with that on top of everything.”
“Would her being separate be good or bad?”
“No. They are in Jerusalem, Israel at this moment. But they have been moving around.”
Cass, Jesse, and Sam laugh. “If you need help being a better feminist I’ll help you out when we get back,” Eileen says.
“Eileen, do you take Samuel to be your lawfully wedded husband?”
Fuck this is gonna sound pathetic. “Um,” he glances at Cass, “I was in this kinda dream world and I didn’t know it was fake until very recently. It was like I was living it but was also watching it when I wasn’t there in the scene if that makes sense. But uh, long story short, I was dead and in heaven, you and Eileen lived out the rest of your lives and had a son then you two came to heaven. I told Cass how I felt and everything. Um, everyone we ever knew and loved was there too. Chuck died and was put in Heaven’s jail, then he was broken out by some rogue angels who threatened and controlled Jesse, that half-demon kid, to do it. A few battles with Chuck’s army later, we broke Lucifer out of the Empty and used him and the mark to lock Chuck and Amara away in the cage that held the Darkness. Then um,” Dean’s voice gets really quiet, “we got married.”
“Ya. I just need to rest.”
Bobby looks up pretending not to be tearing up. “Now Dean,” he croaks out.
Sam is jumping up and down in the background, “yes!!! Finally!”
“We wait for them to call on me I guess. Then when they realize I no longer have the power they need, it’ll be their play.”
“No they weren’t. They were your creations. Beautiful, unique. If you slowed down and just watched them you would know that.”
“Dean, let’s go.”
“How did you forgive yourself?”
Dean smiles. “So, Jesse, I know you have a life here but would you like to come back to Kansas with us? At least while you make a decision. We have plenty of room in the bunker.”
“No.”
“Ya, um that was kinda our fault. Accidentally released God’s sister,” Dean explains.
“Dean!” Sam says shooting up from his chair. “You’re not supposed to be awake yet, the doctors said you haven’t healed enough.”
“I think that just proves that you are a genuinely good person. People like you are the ones that should have power.”
“But entirely possible,” Cass utters and looks at Jack and Kelly. “The president’s been possessed before obviously.”
“It’s great to meet you. I mean we’re kind of relatives. Your demonic parent is my father’s creation so I guess I’m sort of like your uncle.”
“No! What did you do to him?”
“Jesse, we should never have let you disappear like that,” Dean interjects. “You were just a kid, we should have taken care of you.”
“They probably don’t even go anywhere. Just stay and take out the people they hate,” Dean says over the phone.
Cass can’t help but smile. “So you got jealous of Jack being more loved by Christians than you were.”
~~~~~~~~~~
“No. If they want a fight, we’re going to give it to them.”
“Mary Styl?” Eileen asks.
“Wait, it says here that if the person confesses and is ‘cleansed’ of their sins then the ‘pain will cease’,” Sam says after an hour of scouring the books.
It is silent. Dark and ominous, as it should be. “Dean” comes a familiar gruff voice from behind him.
“You sap,” he leans in and presses a kiss on Cass’ lips.
I’m sorry for killing Gabe again. It hurt me a lot to do but I felt it necessary. I have something big planned for a few episodes in the future 😈

“We’re not going to fight you in the middle of a heavily populated area.”
~~~~~~~~~~
“We can’t always control that. What we can control is the good we do in the world. You have done so much good, Jesse. Don’t give that up for one mistake that wasn’t your fault in the slightest.”
“I don’t see it that way.”
Cass pats him on the back. “Me too. And I’m sorry you had to kill Chuck.”
After a few hours of swapping stories, joking around, and John and Mary getting to know their new extended family, Jack suddenly stands and inhales sharply. “Jebediah wants me to meet with them.”
The Pastor is looking angry at this point. “What does her death have to do with me?”
Dean returns the smile and turns back to Sam, “so is everyone back? I see Eileen is.” He waves and smiles at her.
“Well before all this happened I was planning on redoing Purgatory and the Empty but I’m not sure now.”
“I don’t know. But someone definitely did. The door was blasted in, so it wasn’t Chuck.”
The black hole reopens, this time on the wall. Jack, Cass, and Jesse push Chuck backward as he tries to stand.
"On the house," she said with a wink and walked away.
"Isn't iron Man supposed to be tall?" Chamuel asked, waving a hand over the other's head causing Abel to slap it away, playfully bumping into the other as they ducked into the next building.
"Please answer!! Quickly!"
"I got it, you'll be okay!" She said, feeling tears in her eyes as she handed the Adinkra to him. He shook his head at her,
"We only got one more hour till your event, think you're ready?" She asked, leaning against her friend as the horses stopped running.
"No, but you'd slap him," Chamuel spat back.
"It was all recorded," Abel murmured, Donnie's heart sank. Did everyone and their mother watch Israfil die?
"Yeah, of course I'm comin'." He called back,  giving the others  a lopsided grin as he strolled up to them. A prickle of anxiety bit at his stomach, but he blamed it on the lack of sleep. His mind clouded with thoughts as he watched Sam fiddle with a few keys.
"Guys," Abel pleaded, "I didn't tell you because I knew you'd freak out,"
"Don't thank me yet." She chuckled as the hair dryer roared to life.
"What was it." His eyes flickered white as she stumbled over her words before Sam shoved his phone into Chamuel's face. Chamuel blinked at it a few times, taking it from the other and looking at the picture with horror.
"Cain,"
"Yeah, but they never brought me with," there was a hint of sadness in his voice but Chamuel decided not to push it. "Team Born again!" Cham said enthusiastically to the other, holding out a fist.
