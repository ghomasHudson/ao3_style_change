It did; I hobbled through the crowds with my cane, not attracting as much attention as I had expected (or feared). The address was a home, someone’s home, I figured as I came upon it. There was a flowerbox under the single window, dug out and bare, and a dying wreath on the door. I knocked, not finding the bell, and waited. The elder Holmes had said there would be a man to answer the door who would know of me and my purpose, who spoke elegant English and would accompany as necessary on the mystery. I could only trust him now, finding myself in a very foreign country.
He set the kettle on a rickety-looking stove and motioned for us to sit at a very small table, which had been pushed against the opposite wall and was covered with papers and cigarette ashes. There was but a single chair at the table, an indubitable sign of his life alone; I glanced casually at a few papers on the table, careful not to express this sad thought even mutely, not wanting him to deduce my pity when it wasn’t that at all. I busied myself glancing blindly at the papers as he brought in the chair which I had collapsed upon earlier, and then we were sat across from each other.
He nodded at me, or rather in the direction of my fingers, and I took the movement as the goad it was. I withdrew my fingers just to the tip and then thrust them back in. My hips moved with them, following the movement, and my prick ended up pressed to the side of his thigh. His spine bowed, his head thrown back, and he let out the most gorgeous, heartfelt whimper that I hurriedly repeated the movement again, and again, to the same effect.
Confused, I looked over to the woman singing. Who was not… Oh. I noticed the…  tightness of the dress in certain places and a particular bulge in the middle of the throat.
‘Oh,’ Holmes gasped, and it was the same tone of voice he used when a clue had surprised him and led him to solve the mystery. I blushed — then wondered how I could have any modesty to
The papers do not help matters, either. Two years on from the worst of it, from the headlines blaspheming his name, shouting twisted claims which I know are not and cannot be true, as I lived with the man and felt I knew him. It was a dreadful business and painful too, and even two years on, his name is merely hushed in high society, and I find strangers who recognise me or otherwise know of my identity skirt along my edges as though I were a contagion of their horrid claims.
‘I do not wish to know any details of the… involvement of the pair of you,’ he said clearly but quietly, holding my gaze and standing just a bit too close. ‘I can only trust that you both are capable and will not bring about your own destruction because of … passionate … carelessness.’
Without looking back at Holmes, I took his comment as the invitation it was and wordlessly carried my suitcase into the single bedroom, the same room Holmes had disappeared into earlier to shave. The room was small and as dusty and damp as the rest of the place. There was barely room for a bed and a lamp; a mirror lay on the wall by the door, cracked and nearly opaque. Across from the bed was a small wardrobe, which I noticed upon opening was nearly empty. I filled it with my few garments, my heart bursting at the mere sight of our nightshirts hanging together. It was a miracle, wasn’t it? I didn’t let myself have a moment, though, and turned to look at the bed.
One lazy hand comes up to hold the back of my head while the other pets my arm.
We were even farther back this time, but better still, Holmes had managed to procure a small box for us. A private box to see this orchestra: only the two of us, with no one else able to see us. My mind spun at the implications, even though I knew that we were gentlemen and would not get up to anything unsavoury. But I also knew that if I had the option to hold Holmes’s hand in public, even wrap an arm around his shoulders if I were feeling particularly risqué, I would do so, provided he allowed it. And to be able to touch Holmes — if he did indeed allow it, and I could not imagine he would not, given our hand-holding this afternoon — to be able to touch him during one of his highly-esteemed concerts, when he was so immersed in the music that he seemed aethereal and untouchable — well, the mere thought filled my blood with liquid fire.
I run my hand over his cock a few times, my fist tight, and stretch my neck, for I know he is watching me, and I know he loves my neck. He grunts and his hands fall to my hips, another one of his favourite features, I believe (and once or twice, he has remarked how ‘feminine’ they appear to him, although I do not quite see it). When he starts to buck into my hand, I withdraw it and wipe the remaining salve on my thigh, for I have learned that to wipe it anywhere else meant a huff from my partner and a curse of annoyance after our coupling. This way, when we bathe later, it is easily cleaned with little hassle.
‘And you, too.’ He turned to me and we looked at each other. ‘There’s a café not far that serves cheap day old bread.’
My stomach rumbled at the promise that couldn’t come soon enough.
I let my hands brush his neck, cupped the back of it, still keeping him close. ‘You do not seem very grateful for a home in France, my fellow.’
A quick nod. ‘My own good luck.’
I chuckled and let myself kiss the top of his spine, which in the night had miraculously been exposed. ‘Holmes,’ I tried again.
I felt that the air between us had cleared, it seemed, and I knew surely — or otherwise assuredly hoped — that he would answer my question now.
The years have only made him more attractive. Or: as my love for him has grown, have I only grown fonder? This is another conundrum which I do not wish to entertain at the moment.
‘When I saw that dreadful man, it was then,’ he said, far quieter than I remember him speaking, unless we were hidden in a client’s house, planning an attack, and that memory made my heart ache all over again; he continued, ‘It was at that moment that I had to make a decision.’ His pale grey eyes found mine then skittered away just as soon. ‘And it is one I fear I have regretted every day since.’
He rotates my hips sinfully slowly, making sure to drag his erect member against my prostate at each go. I tremble and clutch the hair on one side of his head and whimper.
Instead of a response, he bent over and kissed the top of my head. I inhaled shakily, overcome with emotion. His mere nearness was enough to send me flying, even still.
‘The fight?’
The reunion continues.
He tilts my hips up and pounds into me, holding me still so I can only take it -- and I feel my eyes roll back and my cock start to spurt between us. I clutch his other shoulder with a death grip as I come, my entire body feeling like it is shaking apart. I hear him curse and cry out, and he grinds into me dirty, just the way I like, and I spurt for longer than I ever have, his cock rubbing the orgasm out of me. His own release spreads within me, I feel it rush in, feel him tense then relax into me. His arms wrap around me and hold me close, his cock only just beginning to soften, and I let myself be held as I catch my breath. Unbelievable, is always what goes through my mind in these moments. That and -- love. Pure, unquestionable, real, undeniable love.
I had to refrain from touching him for several minutes so that I could calm down. Once I got my heart back within reasonable beating speed, I stretched my arm behind him to rest on his shoulders, hoping I wasn’t pushing my luck and watching him for any signs of distaste. There were none; he smiled, eyes closed, and leaned back into my arm, his head thrown back and his fingers tapping on his knee. I watched him like that for the remainder of the concert with no further incident, but with such passion and — yes, I daresay — lust coursing through my veins I could not focus on anything, not the music, but him.
‘I believe you will meet him soon enough, Watson,’ he answered, and the finality in his tone bid me to leave it. It was a mysterious answer, but Holmes had always had an ear for mystery. I would have to trust him to be safe — I would not allow myself to overpower him. It was not and never had been my role.
He looked down, sheepish, and I watched him attempt in vain to straighten the papers on the table until the kettle whistled. He poured us tea, moving about not as well as I remember him, a slight wince and limp he wasn’t even trying to hide indicating that he was favouring his right side. As he sat across me once more, tea in front of each of us, he told me the story of our time apart.
‘Oh, Watson,’ he murmured. The anguish on his face was apparent, but I was thankful that at least there were no tears. ‘Only I won’t be here when you return.’
He nodded, eyes still closed, and when I stood from the couch (masking a grimace), I watched him turn himself to his good side and stretch the length of the couch. As it was, it was far too short for him, but he didn’t seem to mind terribly; he snuffled into the back of the couch and exhaled loudly. I pet his shoulder once more and meandered to the poor excuse of a kitchen to make tea. I was quite accustomed to wasting tea at Holmes’s expense, I mused as I drank my newly cold cuppa and poured his out. How nice it was to have his tea to waste at all — for so long now I hadn’t had the chance.
Holmes had mentioned French in his blood before. I admit it was easier to imagine him in France than in Berlin, but then again, I must admit to myself that I still did not know Holmes as well as I would like to believe. Still, no case in Berlin? Perhaps I had been correct: it seemed more and more likely now that Holmes had come to Berlin not only for the research being undertaken here for those of … his own kind, but also for the city’s exquisite, world-renowned concerts.
The address was to a club, not totally unlike that of Mycroft’s Diogenes Club, which both surprised me and didn’t at all. I could not guess the histories of either club, whether they be related or not, but knew that Mycroft Holmes would be able to sniff out such a club in another city for such a peculiar meeting as this one might be.
‘Holmes,’ I said, not moving from my spot. My voice came out gruffer than I meant it to, even in my emotional state, and I lifted my chin when his eyes finally rose to mine.
We walked side by side, Holmes steering us as needed, down streets unfamiliar to me but presumably increasingly familiar to Holmes, until we stopped at what looked like the entrance to a pub. It was: Holmes led me into it, speaking a few foreign (to my ears) words to the gentleman just inside the door.
Holmes got into the bed first. It was a rather nasty looking thing, with a sheet upon it that wasn’t quite white but not grey either and a matching sheet nearly too thin to count as cover. But as Holmes got between them, head on one half of the pillow and at the very edge of the bed, it suddenly looked like the most inviting spectacle I had ever seen.
I'm nearly a chapter ahead of this -- still not abandoned (wow!). Casually going to take off the Granada Holmes fandom marker on this, because I'm beginning to morph them into B.C. and M.F. mostly accidentally. (To the commenter who mentioned this very thing last chapter: Yep.) Finally, don't mind the plot; mind the love & touching.
A knock at the door startled me out of my dark thoughts. I looked at Holmes, watched him straighten and pale. He didn’t move, his spine frighteningly stiff, his eyes on mine. He clearly was not expecting anyone; in fact, I don’t think I had ever seen him so panicked. I nodded wordlessly and stood and went to the door, preparing myself for I don’t know what.
‘You’re a devilish man,’ he whispered, eyes glistening. I smirked.
Holmes was speaking to a young lady at the bar, a drink in his hand. I presumed she was indeed a young lady: her appearance, her hair, even her clothes and posture, rather pointed in the direction of a young chap. It was only her eyes and voice which I think gave her away. She was pretty, if not manly looking, and I forced my thoughts to stop there before I made a fool of myself.
Holmes grunted and stood, balancing carefully on his cane. ‘I believe I promised you luncheon, my dear fellow.’
‘And if some person of authority were to walk in and see… I mean to say, Holmes—’
He smiled demurely. I said nothing, still eating, and pointedly looked at the bread before him. After a moment, he picked it up and took a modest bite. I nodded in praise and affirmation, and he chewed and swallowed and continued. ‘We shall see. You need to send telegrams, I imagine?’
It was awkward. Two men in a bed meant for one — it was tight. Because of my shoulder and my leg, I was limited to lying on one side, maybe my back if necessary. It seemed Holmes was limited as well. It took a few movements, both of us situating ourselves to the best of our abilities, but when we found a position, it clicked.
Before I realised what was happening, Holmes was letting go of my hand and standing to applaud the company. I stood with him to applaud the actors who did not for a second hold my attention; I felt a bit guilty for not paying attention to a play Holmes had clearly enjoyed and to which he had indeed provided me tickets. But as he turned to me, the last rounds of applause dying down, he fixed me with such a grin, an expression on his face that could only be described as transcendent; any bad feeling I was holding onto dissipated instantly.
I had reason to believe it was quite welcome, for as soon as he took in a breath and let it out, he became a puddle on top of me. I kissed his hair and wrapped my arms around his back.
‘I broke a rib or two fighting off the last of Moriarty’s henchmen. And…’
‘I must find something to eat, Holmes,’ I admonished after we passed yet another vendor trying to sell me meat.
I fell asleep on the train thinking of this and woke up in Germany the next morning with a stiff neck and heavy heart. The train stopped and I disembarked, hoping my rudimentary knowledge of German would carry me at least to the address Holmes’s relation had provided me.
This is, as I see it, the end of Part One. I do have plans for a next part, but whether I will write it in a timely fashion is yet to be seen, and also will feature a shift into Holmes’s perspective as well. As it is, I am marking this as completed; if it is to be continued, it will be in another story altogether. I thank you, Dear Readers, for staying this far. You mean more than I ever realised.
He splashed water on his face and dried it with a shirt. ‘Yes, just a small errand.’
He laughed, and I could not keep myself from drawing him nearer and kissing the side of his head. ‘If I return—’ A pained expression overtook Holmes’s face, and I immediately corrected myself in a stern voice, ‘
Interested, I let him lead me down the street, his limp more pronounced when we weren’t arm in arm. He wasn’t wincing, at least from what I could tell from my viewpoint at his side, and it wasn’t so debilitating that I ought to admonish him, as doctor, to take a rest. I let it be and simply observed him, committing to memory his exact gait now, so that I could compare it to a worse one later if need be.
I awoke then properly, afraid he would deduce something minute which would reveal me totally, but nothing seemed to particularly bother him. He seemed, as ever his nature, more curious about every speck than astonished at some telling find.
He heaved a sigh. ‘Is that not a question for my brother? Which he will undoubtedly answer when—’
However, my leg was starting to give me real trouble, and as if on cue, Holmes led me into another venue, this time for his Wagner concert. By that time I was quite tired from all the walking and thankful to once again take a seat.
When I looked up again, Holmes was in the bedroom, getting dressed.
I was not to let anyone else be privy to the knowledge that not only Holmes was alive, but also that he was currently in Germany, or that he planned to go to France. While with Holmes in public, I was to abide by Holmes’s own alias, which I was told to be ‘Sigerson’, and further, I was to be quite careful of outing him here. Mycroft warned me that even one slip-up, one hushed ‘Holmes’ in the man’s ear, could mean the worst, especially when he, in his words, ‘had no ears and eyes on this blasted city’.
‘A case?’
As if in a daze, I allowed Holmes to lead me back onto the streets of Berlin, where the sun was a shock to my system, having spent the past three hours in an internal night.
Once again I was stirred from my inward reverie by thunderous applause. Holmes didn’t stand up this time to clap; instead, he whistled a few times, then turned to me, and to my utter astonishment, held my face in his hands and kissed me full on the lips.
Holmes got under the covers, lifting them as he did the night before, and I happily followed him in. I held him close, and he wrapped one loose arm around my bad shoulder and looked at me. I blinked and decided to take the lead he was yielding: I kissed him.
Once in London, I was to tell everyone that I was offered an opportunity to go back home to my ancestral Scotland, to assist with a family practise, and indeed, I was told, the elder Holmes had set up a practise there with some distant cousin of mine whom I hadn’t seen since I was a wee child. My cousin was informed only that I needed an alibi (Lord knows what he would think of it all; knowing him, if offered a running tab in his pub, he would agree to anything), and Mycroft had an agent willing to sit in the community and watch it the next few months to see if any trouble would come of it. I was to tell Mrs Hudson this and nothing more; Mycroft would not budge, even when I implored him that she would love to know that Holmes was alive.
This flower, for instance, which I keep in my book on the stand by my bed. Holmes brought it home once, a single daffodil, from one of his thinking walks (from the days when I would often not be invited; how times have changed now), and with no hidden meaning whatsoever, purely in a moment of absent deep thought, he set it down on my desk, picked up the book that was sitting there, and settled on the settee to browse it, all wordless in thought.
I nodded again. ‘We must.’ I wanted to say his name, but could not even force myself to use his alias.
He kept his mouth shut and his head turned. Very well, I thought; I would hear about it later. Setting it aside, I shook my head and gingerly felt around the bruises, checking. He winced every time, which was so unlike him I nearly began to panic. But this was a different Holmes now than the one I had known, for many reasons. I should be glad that he did not hide the depth of his pain from me.
. He had agreed to wait for me outside the club, as there happened to be a bench across the street on which he could sit and rest his leg (he had assured me that his meeting with the mysterious researcher would not last long).
A winded voice echoed through the place, ‘The bedroom has a wardrobe.’
I nodded, not knowing how else to react, and thought about what all of this meant for him. A Sherlock Holmes unable to return to his country, to his city, barely even able to walk. Next to me sat a broken man, one might say half a man compared to the one I once knew.
'Watson, what did you find?' I asked in the gentlest voice I could muster. I had learned that there are times my Watson prefers me to set my detective skills aside, and I was only too happy to please him on this; it was the least I could do, after everything.
‘I’ll always limp, Watson.’ His eyes searched mine. Our hands met at his knee. ‘I don’t think I’ll be able to run again.’
‘Do you wish to stay in Berlin?’
‘Live with me.’ He held my gaze and continued after another shaky exhale, ‘Be with me. My companion. Like you were before all of this mess.’
‘Thank you,’ is all he said, and he stood and stretched, that delightful smile never leaving his face. ‘Oh, I feel
His face transformed slowly into the loveliest, most pleasant and thankful face I have ever seen on him. If I kissed him again in that moment, I couldn’t be faulted in that heavy moment for my inability to restrain myself.
Not wanting to ‘hover’ over Holmes, I cleared some room on the sofa next to him, a good distance between us, and grabbed one of the papers. It was all in German — of course it was. I closed it and placed it in my lap and sipped the tea. It wasn’t bad.
He fixed me a curious stare, his brows furrowed. I felt myself soften; being so gruff would not do either of us any good. ‘Watson, what is it?’
It was a warm August Sunday that my Watson found the letter in one of his folders. I was long since busy cataloguing some Chinese tobacco ash when I felt the comfortable silence shift into something tender and heavy. When I looked up, Watson was covering his mouth with his hand and was leaning back in his desk chair. His shirtsleeves were rolled up, displaying his tantalising (at least in my humble opinion) arm hair, long and manly and perfect texture for gripping in times of need. I made sure to be in need often.
The newspaper in Holmes’s hands fluttered down loudly. Without turning around, he said in what might have been an amused tone, ‘Whatever precipice you're dangling over, Watson, jump off it or back down. You're making the hairs on my neck stand on end just hovering there.’
After several moments, I heard footsteps approach. The door opened, my gaze on the doormat, which I just noticed had a strange stain on it which looked of dried blood. I knew, because living with Holmes, accompanying him on his cases, I’d seen quite a bit of dried blood on myriad surfaces and feel with some confidence that I can recognise blood a mile off. The door opened and I looked up, about to warn the fellow that something had happened on his doorstep, and felt all the blood leave my face. Before me, having opened the door, standing in front of me in the flesh, was a gaunt, older, but still — undoubtedly — Sherlock Holmes.
The kettle whistled, and I took it off the heat so as not to wake him. If Holmes must adapt, so I would along with him. I knew that now: wherever he went was precisely where I needed to be. I would follow him anywhere, to the ends of the earth, if needs must. Even to Berlin, this most foreign of cities, it seemed.
I didn’t hear the rest of it as I headed in the direction he had vaguely pointed to. I found some gauze and ointments, but that was it. I brought them both back to the sitting room, where Holmes was struggling to undress.
‘Sit down again.’ My voice was softer this time, of course it was, and when Holmes sat, I sat down next to him. He looked an odd sight, his shirt unbuttoned completely, his vest rucked up, his trousers undone and hanging off his hips. But when he looked at me, his eyes were fearful, and I thought nothing of his dress at all.
‘I’ll walk you there. I have an errand to make.’
I looked down at the address again. The address was for here in Berlin. Without a map, I would have no way of finding it…
Holmes instinctively wrapped both legs around my waist and tilted himself even better as I began to move in earnest. He was whimpering with every breath now, every exhale, and I straightened out my sore legs as best I could and ducked my head against his shoulder and rode him with all I had.
Holmes turned towards me and laid his head on my good shoulder. I turned and kissed what I could reach of his head and contented myself to just sit with him for a few more moments, before anything could separate us again.
. I would have to trust that Mycroft would do the right thing and tell Mrs Hudson.
I turned to Holmes, who was once again radiating a sort of bliss, a lightness, which in turn lightened my own chest. I smiled, and feeling brave, asked, ‘Care to dance again?’
At the sight of the envelope in my hand, he visibly relaxed a bit and made a motion towards it. Understanding his cue, I opened it.
If I could have bent down comfortably to kiss him then, I would have. I opted instead to take his hand and press it to my lips, which earned me a radiant, surprisingly sentimental smile; then I pressed one hand to his arse and the other to my prick. I rubbed it against his rim and felt it twitch; gasping, and looking not down to where I was about to press inside, but at Holmes directly, our eyes connected, I pushed forward and aimed true.
The sitting room door was locked, as it ever was these days, and the window to the rest of the world was open for a breeze. Still, I had the courage to say, looking into his eyes, 'I love you.'
‘Have you been with a man before, Watson?’ Holmes hushed against my mouth a second later.
To live with Holmes here. To move my life away from London. I had in my modest suitcase only enough clothes for less than a week and exactly one novel. The rest of my belongings — clothes, books, medical journals, trinkets collected through the years, that ship still not fully put together — remained in London. Not to mention all of Holmes’s belongings, which I had lived alongside in his absence. Some things I could certainly live without, but a few items I would prefer to see again. And my practise, abandoned at a moment’s notice for what I had thought would be a short jaunt to Germany, still lay waiting for me to return. And Mrs Hudson, our poor housekeeper left alone — what would she think? She would have no trouble letting our rooms, but I could not imagine the emotional toil it would cost her to lose me after she’d lost Holmes. She had told me on more than one lonely night that we were like sons to her. Could we really abandon her to live in this fashioned Elysium thousands of miles away?
‘Oh!’ A single cry, followed by a keening sound, and I groaned a matching noise and bit just a little. He moaned outright when I released his hip and felt upwards with my hand to squeeze at his other nipple. ‘
He arched again below me and let out a loud moan. I continued marking him, determined not to go any further and not to move my hips until he answered my question.
He handed it back to me, and this time I took it.
‘You see, Watson, and I’m sure you might have guessed by now — Moriarty knew things about me which were dangerous, just as I knew things about him which, given I had gone to the police, would have imprisoned him. Or worse. If they could have caught him, at least…’ Holmes exhaled a near sigh and put his hand over his face, looking at his lap. ‘In some circles, what he knew about me — and he noticed it almost immediately, I am ashamed to say — was far worse than any crimes he ever committed. In the eyes of England.’
‘How long have you been here, Holmes?’
He dithered. I paused, my hand stilled from its stroking of his hair.
‘Watson,’ he sighed against my neck. I shivered.
The telegrams sent, my fate in the air for the night, Holmes and I hobbled back together to his meagre lodgings. It was growing dark, and on the last block, Holmes nearly tripped and immediately caught himself on my arm. I stopped briefly, silent, and put my hand on his, perched still on my arm. He faked a quick smile at me, a swift upturning of his lips without any emotion, then continued looking straight ahead. There was a flare of pain in my chest at the sight of him not at his best, but I steadfastly carried on.
‘Bien sûr,’ was her reply, a mystified tone in her voice I more than recognised from myself and others exposed to Holmes’s deducing prowess. The man was indeed a marvel when on the hunt, and was even more astounding when he explained his solution to a case. She continued in language I could not understand, but which left Holmes preening in satisfaction. I squeezed around his waist then stepped forward to shake her hand.
When we finally arrived back at his digs and were once more inside, he sat swiftly on the chair I myself had awoken upon, and now I understood the purpose of its placement. As I let him rest and catch his breath, my only comment a light hand briefly on his shoulder, I brought my suitcase into the sitting room and placed it on the sofa.
With Holmes’s death, I thought that, at some point, my bone-deep love for him would diminish or at the very least, if not disappear, lessen its weight upon my chest. Yet six months, eight months, a year and a half on, nearly everything reminded me of him, every day, and my chest aches still at the thought of him.
I shook my head and interrupted him, ‘No, I think you know.’
, the heat slowly overtaking all of my senses, until I was fully inside.
I looked over to Holmes beside me, my suspicions clarified in his face. He looked excited, but doubtful, his brow creased; his countenance screamed tense and timid, as if he were nervous how I would react to such a spectacle.
(See the end of the chapter for
I quiver at this and kiss his shoulder as I spread my legs wide. I have no wish to speak, nor do I need to: he knows my body better than his own, and I his. So I continue my slow movements silently, and with no barriers between us, and start to shudder. This was not the plan at all when I woke up, but I am more than willing to float away on this escapade, in the safety of our home and in my lover’s arms.
But that is another matter, a philosophical debacle I have tired of over the years. Now, years into our companionship, I can only admire him, gaze agape at him, at my whole-bodied love for him. I think of this now, watching him sleep next to me as the sun streams in.
I willed my pulse to calm and let the silence stretch out for several moments before breaking it once more with my own query. ‘Why Berlin?’
‘I need to move my arm.’
I knew I had done something very right when he let out a startled yell — it shocked me at first, but his body moved into the pressure, not away from it, and I wondered not for the first time at the miracle of that gland inside him that made him feel such intense pleasure. He cursed and lifted his leg to wrap high around my middle; I held it there, moving closer on my knees, and rested a third finger just at the rim of him.
‘Sherlock—’
, I wanted to say,
Dressed, and looking as good as he ever did before all this mess, his hair slicked back and armed in a suit which slimmed him even more and gave him his usual untouchable air, he returned to the sitting room. ‘Ready?’ he asked, looking around for something and notedly avoiding my gaze. He finally found it, a newspaper it seemed, one out of the myriad mess of papers in the room.
Holmes drew in a long inhale and closed his eyes, shook his head. ‘I was bleeding too much.’
My face reddened. He knew, the devil, he knew and by gods in heaven, it was reciprocated. A shared love between us; if only I had not been ill, I would have kissed him then. The 'flu had the decency to end mere days afterward, and I did find my chance then, finally.
I took a step towards Holmes, unable to keep myself from him, for his eyes had fallen, his face hardened to keep emotion in. He looked miserable, utterly miserable, and my heart sank in my chest. I placed a hand on his shoulder, startled to find him trembling ever so slightly, and cupped his cheek. ‘Not today,’ I whispered. ‘I will not leave you today. I have to see Hamlet with you, right?’
Holmes was dead; Sherlock Holmes is dead, I told myself. I slapped my mouth open and shut several times before I managed, ‘My sincere apologies, I thought you were — I thought you might be —’
Passion overtook me; I felt it rise up from deep within my chest, where it had sat forlorn for years and years, bubble up through me, into my fingers which were on either side of his head, threading through his hair, as I pressed myself forward and pulled him closer simultaneously, in the vain attempt that we become one. As a result of my shoving and pulling, Holmes ended up in my lap in the chair, his head tilting this way and that before he found the best (of course he would find it quicker than anyone else) angle and kissed me with what could only be described as desperate, passionate,
I let the silence spin out, the implication of what he was saying surrounding us. Then, softly: ‘The answer is yes, Holmes.’
But his eyes were teary, pulling me from my explicit reminiscences, and I was in front of him in moments. I didn't bother speaking: he knows I can deduce what I need to. But he was hiding something this time, out of shame or modesty I was not sure. I knelt on the rug and placed my hand on his knee.
,” I start to chant, “oh, John, John, please…”
He shook his head, then added, ‘In Paris, yes. My leg was already a bit messed up, I am afraid, and my ribs, too. But after the fight with the ruffian here…’ He looked sheepish. ‘It’s not serious, Watson? I thought it was only normal bruising from a good fight.’
He shook his head. ‘There was no case. Mycroft is not pleased to have me in this city, and as I depend on him for the time being for any livelihood…’ He shook his head again; his hands fell from my side. ‘There is… something for me in the south of France.’
‘Holmes,’ I began. He turned his head and I kissed down his neck, intent on marking him. His legs spread so that I was between them, a movement which pressed our erections even closer together. I wanted to rub off on him, to rub our pricks together, but I had to ask. ‘Holmes, is this alright?’
‘Watson—’ he panted, keening as I moved my attention to his neck. ‘John. Is that a yes?’
‘Yes.’
I shook my head, my breath coming out harshly in the silence. No, of course I hadn’t been with another man. Had he?
His eyes bore into mine until he finally nodded once, his jaw set. I nodded mutely back at him.
He didn’t have to elaborate further on the sentiment, for I understood: He had chosen to leave me behind to think the worst, as he ridded London of this villain.
‘Swear to me.’
, Watson!’ He turned to me and offered his hand. ‘But our day is not over — I have plans for you yet.’
Holmes took me to a nicer restaurant this time, where he ordered us wine and fish. The wine was better than the fish, and better than anything else was the blush that spread on Holmes’s cheeks after his first glass. We were splurging in the middle of the day, in a foreign city, in which no one knew us (I hoped) and in which we knew no one (or only very few people, on Holmes’s side). A city which was renowned not only for its music, which we were about to partake in, but also for its somewhat unsavoury reputation, which we had also partook in the night before. I felt like a different person, in some aspects. But before me was Holmes, beside me was Holmes, and therefore I could be Watson. His Watson.
‘And will you let me know what it is, Holmes?’ I wanted to add,
He hummed and turned his head to look at me.
He nodded.
He gasped and moved his head to the side and pulled the collar of his nightgown down and over, opening up more of his skin, down to his collarbone. ‘There,’ he rasped, and I understood and latched on, sucking and nibbling until I was sure a mark would be left. He lay there gasping and whimpering, twitching his hips upwards against mine; I pressed one hand to his good hip and held him there, moving further down to latch onto his exposed nipple.
The entire play continued for quite some inestimable time, but even from the start, the voices floated by me, over me, as I instead became hyper-focussed on Holmes beside me, on our hands in my lap, on his pulse which I could feel thrum against my skin. I wanted more, my cheeks burning at the thought, and worse still when I remembered the events of the previous night. Would there possibly be a repeat tonight? Or perhaps even more? Something different? The words of Shakespeare fell on my deaf ears as I contemplated all the possibilities. I landed on my favourite possibility, almost too explicit to write, and ran that idea into the ground, over and over, my cheeks most probably a permanent shade of red.
‘You are not joining me?’ I asked Holmes under my breath.
‘Disbelieving?’
,” he hushes against my lips, and when he plants his feet on the bed and brackets my hips, the new angle pushes me forward and I kiss him, gasping into his mouth.
Holmes hummed, not an answer to my question at any rate, and continued on his speed-reading run. He didn’t even look up at me, just emitted that one grunt to my question. It was too much like the Holmes I knew for it to sit comfortably with me: I wondered how long it would take for me to be left in the dark again, for Holmes to leave again without giving me anything to go on.
‘That man,’ he whispered, folding the envelope and putting it in his coat pocket hastily. He drew a quick breath. ‘That’s enough for a week’s rent at a nicer flat, and he wishes me to go to France.’
‘Holmes,’ I repeated, this time recalling the steel I used to add to my voice in the army.
‘I am not sure the best action to take either, Watson,’ he said quietly. My heart dropped; surely he would not expect me to leave? ‘But we should first consult my elder brother. I daresay he has something in mind for me anyway.’
‘Why did your brother reply to my telegram with an address?’
‘I suppose there is something in it for you. If I am what they say I am.’ He kissed my chin, still looking at me with those pale eyes.
I groaned and shifted myself. His arms came up around me as I pressed into him; he shook as our erect members met with only our nightshirts between us.
‘Holmes?’
I return with my savings, and the sum you gifted me by proxy, we ought to buy better digs.’
s of our canes. There was hardly a breeze, and the air felt stuffy, almost oppressive, but I reckoned that was more of a reflection of my mind than anything: For I felt, walking side by side with Holmes on his way back, that I was walking into something bigger than myself. I had just witnessed something unbelievable, on several different levels; Holmes had just shown me a side of human nature I did not fully know existed, as well as a side to himself which, in doing so, put himself in danger should I be less of a man than he thinks me. As it was, and quite obviously, I would die before I would betray Holmes or give him up. That he allowed me to see that sacred part of his soul showed me more than anything else the level of trust Holmes bestowed in me. It was more than an honour and a privilege; I felt I held Holmes’s fragile yet strong heart in my hands, and I wanted only to cup my own doctor’s hands around it and protect it from all the evil in the world.
‘Surely one of your own government officials would be better suited,’ I said.
‘You are everything to me, Holmes,’ I whispered moments later. The swarm of hormones had invaded my brain, and I felt warm all over and full of love for the man in my arms. Holmes’s head was pillowed on my arm, and I kissed the back of his neck sweetly. He didn’t seem to want me to move, nor had I any inclination to do so, and so I stayed there, my softening prick still inside him. It was the most intimate encounter of which I had ever been a part, including any semi-truthful trysts which had unfortunately and embarrassingly earned me my army nickname. Holmes was different, obviously so, and I spent not a single second or thought wasted on the reality of what we had just done, for to me, it was and could only ever be an act of the utmost love and devotion.
Just as I was pouring the tea, I heard Holmes enter the kitchen, fully buttoned up and dressed once more, and sit primly in his chair from before.
Could I do this? For Holmes, I think I could.
He pulled out a train ticket. ‘For tomorrow morning,’ he said, in awe, and handed it to me. I stared it down, disbelieving. Holmes and I still had the day together.
happen.
‘Of course.’ I couldn’t stop my fingers from roaming through his hair if I tried.
I nearly begged
“Sherlock,” he whispers, then tries to sit up a bit. I shake my head and press his shoulders against the mattress, not hard, just enough to prove my point. I can see a glint in his eyes and a smirk on his lips as I move above him, straddling his hips. His hands fall there, on my bony hips, immediately, and I kiss him like I know he likes: slow, deep, with enough tongue to tease but not be overwhelming. He hums in appreciation and I roll my hips to find his desire evident.
Mycroft was still staring at me, as though waiting for a response. I did not really have one, for any promise to him to be careful seemed trite, and any promise that such carefulness would not alter what Holmes and I shared seemed distasteful. So all I could manage was a nod and a rough, ‘Thank you, Mycroft.’
‘I don’t know his name,’ Holmes said several moments later, his tea half gone. His fingers were twitching; did he not have any cigarettes?
,’ I gushed, then chastised myself from saying his Christian name so loud; but he did not seem perturbed in the slightest. In fact, he blushed further and smirked, looking almost smug. I would have to be careful next time, I told myself, unable to keep up the façade of practicality when faced with this pleased version of Holmes.
‘Am I hurting you?’ I asked, my mouth at his ear.
‘I love you so,’ I rasped harshly against his lips, shocking myself as the sentiment poured out of me without my expecting it to. But it was true, and real.
Needless to say, it was a sight for sore eyes. I had a feeling then that Holmes was back in his element. The sight of papers strewn all about inspired in me a feeling of familiar exasperation, for it was not the first time I had seen such a mess created by Holmes himself. The difference here was time: now I welcomed such a mess, because it meant that Holmes was on the hunt again. Even if it would fall to me to clean it up, as our dear landlady was not here (a thought I did not allow myself to sit on).
‘John,’ he whimpered, and I grunted in response, my entire body lighting up with that one word, as marvelously uttered as it was. ‘Oh, John, I love you.’
I wondered where his pipe was, or if he even had a pipe. The Holmes I knew consumed tobacco like a fiend. It was admittedly bizarre to see him have to put so much work in just for cigarettes. And as he set to work rolling his first one, I confess I found it impossible to take my eyes off his hands, even as he continued his story.
Holmes was always a character on trains. He was a character everywhere, of course, but on trains especially. He was often antsy, especially when our travels were taking us to a new mystery, and too often spent it fretting about. I spent such journeys remaining as still as I could manage, knowing eventually he would sense me and still himself, and by the last thirty minutes of each of these longer journeys, he always calmed enough to sit next to me, lean his head back against the wall of the carriage, steeple his fingers in his lap, and sigh. I do not know if he sensed my smugness each of these times; he never spoke to it. But it was a beauty to see,
‘Help you?’ I couldn’t keep the grin from growing on my face.
sounded too cold to me, too unfamiliar.
‘Mr Holmes,’ I replied warmly, shaking his hand. We two had rarely been alone together, so the familiarity was rather stiff. Just as well, as I did not quite understand the man before me, and wasn’t sure I would ever be allowed to do. I felt a great debt to him, though, for pointing me in the direction of his still-alive brother, and tried to let that warmth not consume my businesslike composition. I did not want to embarrass the man with any unwelcome overfamiliarity.
My chest constricted with emotion. Holmes was alive. I reached for him, but the bed was empty save me. The sheet was bunched up around my waist, the pillow fallen off the bed altogether. It was then that I remembered what we had done the night before. I felt my cheeks warm and my prick stir at the explicit images that came to mind, the intensity and weightiness of such an interaction with Holmes, the man I had yearned for for years, but chief in my mind was worry, for Holmes had not stayed.
The telegram to Mycroft was much more difficult. Not sure what I should even ask, I simply wrote,
Satisfied with my observation on his side, I said sternly, ‘Show me your leg now.’
. I must kiss him.
‘Not on the street. This meat is dreadful. After your date with Mycroft, we will luncheon.’
I looked at the table, not sure what to say to such a statement. ‘And if we were to be recognised?’
‘Sit down, let me,’ I said sharply. He nodded, and without fully realising what I was doing, only concerned that Holmes was hurt, and had been for God knows how long, I unbuttoned his shirt and pushed it and his vest aside to reveal a mass of bruises on his left side. I barely restrained a gasp, and admonished, ‘
‘Is this for a case?’ I asked after I’d finished a second cup of tea. The mess of papers around Holmes seemed to have grown; it didn’t seem possible, but it looked as if there were more newspapers now.
He nodded, almost manic with it. I reapplied more of the ointment, during which time I watched him, eyes closed, one hand by his head, clutching the poor pillow, his other hand moving slowly up and down his prick, as if comforting it. I felt hot watching him and hastened to return my fingers there.
After a minute’s walking, I broke the companionable silence. ‘What errand have you to run?’
Holmes looked at me and looked at me, his thumb just brushing the joint between my neck and shoulder. Then he kissed me, his lips soft but quivering upon mine, just for a moment, just enough for me to get used to it, then hid his face in my neck again.
Both his hands run down the length of my back, making me shudder, and grip my arse to bring me faster onto his cock. I cry out at the feeling -- harder is good, faster is even better, and this is ending up like most of our other couplings now. Passionate, heart-wrenchingly passionate and all-consuming, just like my love for the man.
‘John, you will have to go back to London,’ he said all at once on an exhale. I closed my mouth. He still was staring a hole in my sleeve. ‘My cousin is buying your practise, but you will still have to pack up 221B and tell Mrs Hudson and anyone else who would suspect your sudden disappearance to another country. Mycroft will order you to leave again. He has probably already bought a ticket for you.’
‘Have you read anything on inversion, Watson?’
Holmes’s raven-coloured hair, grown longer than I’d remembered, fanned out on the pillow. His nightshirt was quite too big on him, and white, which resulted in his pale neck and shoulder and collarbone laid bare for my eyes to feast upon. He looked up at me, his eyes a pale blue-green, a hunger in them that I recognised in myself. He waited patiently for me; I wondered how long he had waited for this very moment. The weight of all that this meant on my shoulders, I climbed into bed with him.
A rumble bubbled up from his chest and he barked out a laugh. ‘Look again, dear fellow.’
I hope reading Holmes&Watson dancing freely in public soothed & balmed your soul as much as it soothed mine writing it.
The concerts (Hamlet at Luisen Theater and Wagner’s Lohengrin at Königliches Opernhaus) Holmes & Watson attended really did occur on Sunday, March 2, 1901, per an archived Berlin newspaper I read. Here also is the mention of the great Magnus Hirschfeld, and what Holmes said is true: Berlin had several homosexual, marvelously extravagant balls, which the police did indeed attend. See Robert Beachy’s Gay Berlin for more delicious details. Dancing and smut planned for next chapter — this is now all but planned out and am doing my best not to lose steam.
‘There might be a case.’
before I remembered that Holmes couldn’t return with me. That he was not allowed back to England. That, in order to stay with him later, I would have to leave him behind now.
I attempted tidying up some papers — merely straightening them, trying to avoid looking too closely at them for fear of what I might find, although I am not sure if pressed I could give a reason for this hesitancy — while Holmes made himself presentable. He shaved, I am sure, although I did not understand why. I knew Holmes was always fastidious about his personal cleanliness to an extreme, but I couldn’t imagine the café we were going to would expect pristine clientèle like the gentlemen’s clubs in London. I myself was past due for a shave — would he expect me to shave as well? He had never said anything on the matter of my personal grooming before, other than a comment once when we attended an opera before which he specified which particular suit I must wear. Still, I would hate for him to be embarrassed about my own appearance. It wouldn’t do for me to be unsavoury next to a man with as much grace as Holmes had.
‘Merely thinking.’
Once again alone in Holmes’s squalid rooms, I leaned against the wall, watching Holmes. It was dark and quiet, and he lit a candle in the sitting room and carried it straight to the bedroom, without looking my direction. The flame flickered wildly as he limped. I followed him, and when I saw him begin to undress to change into his sleep things, I matched his movements.
‘Is it good?’ I asked and rocked again, deeper this time, and knew the thrust had rung true when he cried out sharply.
The bread was a bit hard but nothing to sneeze at, but the beer was the best I’d had in all my days. I was rarely given to enjoy beer, as I much preferred brandy and the wines which Holmes likewise preferred, but this beer was deserving. I drank half of it in the first gulp, surprised, and when I looked up, Holmes was smirking.
‘Have you seen anyone at all? A nurse?’
But as I set his tea down in front of him, he merely glanced at me, then focussed on the tea. I felt wrong-footed. Still, we were the both of us Englishmen, so I sat across from him with my own cuppa and waited a bit.
‘You know, Watson,’ he said under his breath, turning to me once we took our seats, ‘I was very nearly an actor.’
Trivialities?
We lay like that for some indeterminable amount of time, long enough that I was about to fall asleep, before Holmes stiffened suddenly and sat up, clutching his side with a nearly silent gasp.
‘Oh Watson, your first observation was quite correct,’ the voice said, and it was Holmes’s own, could not be any other’s. ‘I am indeed your Sherlock Holmes, and I believe I owe you a thousand apologies.’
, but he waved my hand away. I reckoned he needed to be alone, the shame of his pain too much for him at the moment, so I let him go and watched him weave awkwardly but still somewhat gracefully through the crowd to the other side, to the bar. After a moment, uncertain that I should hold the table in wait, I followed him, my journey much less graceful. I ran smack into two lads, dressed in sailor uniforms (were they truly sailors? I now knew could not trust any outward appearances), apologised briskly in first English then, correcting myself, broken German, and continued on briskly after their smiles turned appreciative, their eyebrows coyly raised.
‘Holmes.’ I was surprised to find tears in my eyes as I looked up at him. His hands were on either side of my head, threading through my hair, his eyes on mine. ‘Holmes, have you seen a doctor here?’
Sometimes I wish fictions could be true: that I had indeed found a wife, a companion to distract me from my grief, as I led my readership to believe, but that is not the case. I am alone as I ever have been, and certainly lonelier than I was before I ever met Holmes, for now I know what loneliness’s opposite is. In the night, as I sleep poorly, it seems one half of me is always still yearning for him, for some portion of him, even his presence or the mere knowledge that he was lying downstairs as I was upstairs, our positions matched, perhaps even thinking of each other as we each couldn’t find sleep. But the sure knowledge of his death is no companion, and neither is grief. I feel myself become half a man as each day goes by, and there is nothing I have found to salve my own poor soul.
‘Are you… aware… of what men do together?’
He shook his head. It was strange, to me, that Holmes would not be interested in seeing his relation after said relation had travelled to another country for him, but I also understood that the Holmes brothers were in no way typical relations. Perhaps Holmes was not interested in letting his brother see his condition (he had rather visibly limped at my side on our walk to the place); or perhaps they had seen each other enough; or perhaps the two of them in the same room would raise some question from someone. I did not ask, for it was not truly my business, and so I bid Holmes farewell with a simple, curt nod and a glance that he matched which communicated
‘I trust your stay in Berlin is going well?’ The tone was too airy for what lay under the words, and I immediately understood from it that we were to keep this interaction entirely void of my Holmes, his present, living condition, and especially the events of the past day.
Am still working diligently on this piece with few inklings about where to take it. Any thoughts? Anything you want to see our boys do in turn of the century Berlin?
This is still in the works. I've got a bit more of a plan now. You commenters might notice reflections in the story -- that's because you're commenting exactly what I need to continue. I don't think this would be continued without you, so thank you.
Holmes paused here and looked at me through his eyelashes, and I caught on. The papers. All the articles, everything, everyone, blaspheming Holmes’s good name with such a disreputable … reputation.
The reunion continues.
Holmes whimpered then and rocked his hips downward at some blessed angle which left me seeing stars. My eyes closed and I leaned forward, over Holmes a little, and rocked my hips deeper inside him.
I nodded, not sure I completely understood, but silently willing him to go on. He did.
‘You know what to do, just—’ He reached over to the little table and handed me a jar of some ointment. ‘Use this, and…’
‘Holmes, are you hurt?’
‘Here?’ I asked, swirled my finger then pressed inside. He jerked, nearly kicked me, and nodded.
Holmes’s fingers stilled. He took another drag of his cigarette as though delaying his response. ‘I wasn’t sure you would be interested in seeing me again,’ he murmured, a confession.
Holmes nodded. ‘It was all finished and — I felt it was worth the risk.’
Holmes stared at me and stared at me, something happening on his face, as though he were thinking through some process. There was some emotion in his eyes that he was letting me see, and I was nearly taken aback by it, whatever it was, surprised at its vulnerability. He looked as if he were in pain when he replied,  ‘Mycroft has a plan, I am sure of it. I daresay I’ve an inkling.’
He swallowed and gathered a breath. 'A letter.' He tried to hand it to me, but I pushed it away.
Professor Moriarty was indeed dead, that much Holmes personally knew, he said as he had shoved him down the Falls himself. But Holmes had survived, and did not go down with him, and was on his way back to me when he saw one of Moriarty’s henchmen. It was a sign, he said, that Moriarty had not been working alone. He had had an inkling, but this sealed it for him. Moriarty had several criminals under his thumb, and Holmes would have to — get rid of them.
) and paid with a handful of coins. I followed him to a table outside, where a few Berliners were sitting at other tables, some quiet, reading newspapers, others chattering animatedly in German.
When I awoke again, it must have been dawn. I heard birds and the city beginning to wake. It sounded familiar but different than what I was used to; then I remembered where I was.
‘Whose name?’ I figured he was speaking of the ruffian with whom he’d gotten into a ‘good fight’, but that was the part I played with Holmes: the curious, mostly ignorant companion, who knew (or pretended to know) what questions to ask to stir Holmes’s genius.
His face is flush, a faint red from exertion, and he stares up at me with brow furrowed in concentration, sweat beginning to bead on his forehead. He is a masterpiece of arousal, and I have to still my hips before I reach my crisis too soon.
My heart broke to see the best man I have ever known break down into tears. I held onto his forearms, not sure what else to do. Our teas sat forgotten between us, gathering dust.
‘Slowly at first, just, ah, one…’ he whispered then gasped as I pressed a finger just there, against his fundament, feeling him. He was hot and clearly enjoyed just feeling my finger there; I looked up from watching it to see his face. He was biting his lip, a sheen of sweat and a look of pure, exquisite anticipation on his face.
which was currently coursing through me, making me almost dizzy. The mere thought of — of what he asked of me — of putting my prick
We spent several moments catching our breath and still partly entwined, otherwise one of us might fall off the bed. I looked at his chest and could make out, in the shadows, our seed intermixed on his stomach; I looked down to find the same remnants on my own nightshirt. I began to laugh, a low rumble beginning at what felt like the innermost part of my chest and spiralling outwards.
