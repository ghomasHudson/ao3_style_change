“Hold on,” she says, pulling him back down, “I just poured my heart out to you, told you my deepest and darkest secret. So, now it’s your turn.”
And the prince is there.
The guilt, shame and frustration that had been simmering for weeks, finally made their way to the forefront of his mind. His stomach churned, his breath became uneven. He gulped down what could have either been a sob or his day’s lunch threatening to arise.
“I mean, sure it has a ‘happy ending’ but what about the poor dude that got turned to stone? I mean one minute he’s intent on marrying this girl and the next, he’s become a fucking statue.”
Cas stared at the pie.
“It’s about time we each got our own sandwich,” he said.
He thinks to himself.
Cas sighed, but agreed.
“Did… did it hurt when you died?”
Dean looked over at his friend confused. Cas had studied far more than Dean had. He had his syllabus all prepared before they even started at UChicago. He had organised notes galore, labels and sticky notes, every transcription of the lectures printed out. Dean studied, of course. But as well as Cas?
She practically growls.
“Prince Castiel, I am so honoured to have you here. I have been wanting to speak to you for quite some time now, so I feel fortunate that you have decided to come visit my village.”
Though Cas stared at him with wide eyes and nodded softly, urging him to continue. Dean had no idea why, but he decided to take Cas’ word for it. He moved his hand further and further in, feeling the convulsing as it spread up his arm until all of a sudden… it just stopped.
The words are spoken with such reverence, such emotion, such love. To Dean, they sound like a prayer.
“Dean’s story is not mine to tell, Mary.” Castiel said. “However, I know the love that Dean possesses for you. I saw it as a child and I still see it now. When he is ready, someday, he will talk to you once again. This I am sure of.”
The realisation had led to them breaking up over one of the previous weekends. The following week, Dean spent his time trying to process it and the feelings he had. Yet in the same time, Lisa had already found a new partner. Dean was hurt and mad and angry. His life became almost suffocating. He hated school and hated all his classmates, his dad was always working, and his mom paid most of her attention to Sam. Dean was unhappy; plain and simple.
Dean had demanded.). Before Claire left, she stared Dean down intensely.
happy for him. He can’t deny the warmth he feels when he sees his brother grinning at his new husband as they dance together.
“I am fine, I promise,” he said, hating that he was lying to his friend. Yet, he could not have Dean knowing what he heard in there. He could not have Dean worrying and carrying an even bigger burden than the one he already had.
But that smile always told Cas that he was okay, that everything was going to be alright. And even then, with Dean being five hundred miles away, just the thought of that smile brought Cas to ease.
seared into his brain. Just as the person answered, Dean turned to look at Cas and immediately froze. His friend had his back turned to him… his
First of all, he loved the beauty that the city held. He knew most people wouldn’t think of the college town as something picturesque, but to him, it had its own strange charm. It wasn’t like he had much to compare it to, considering when he stared out the window of his bedroom in Chicago, all he saw was the grey walls of the apartment building across the road and the occasional neighbour hanging out their laundry. Here in Lawrence, when he looked out the window, he saw the big green oak trees that lined his street and the red and white roofs of the neighbouring houses. Sometimes, when the weather was just right, he saw how blue the sky in Kansas really could get. He loved the fresh breeze, and the way the sun trickled through his window every morning, and how the dust that gathered on the sill would dance in its rays.
They grab their horses from the stable and Dean is obviously quick to saddle up Baby, whereas Charlie goes for a reddish-brown horse called Hermione.
She stopped signing as she saw Cas immediately go rigid, freezing up. She furrowed her eyebrows in confusion.
He signed to diffuse the tension.
loved to ask.
“Really,” Dean replied, “honestly, I’ve been dreaming of this exact scenario since high school. I just can’t believe it’s really happening.”
Dean’s home village was only a two hour horseback ride from Purgatory Village. It was just within the Grasslands region, situated below Mount Lazarus, near where the entrance to the mountain’s path was. The Grasslands region also had its own town, where most of Castiel’s extended family resided. However, most people who lived in the Grasslands town were healers, their faint magic allowing them to cure and take care of those who were injured or sick. In Vale Village, only humans lived there, all without any magical abilities.
Dean just stared at Cas, not knowing what to reply.
Benny smiles.
“Want to share?” Cas stated meekly, a knowing gaze in his eyes.
Dean blushed and not having that realisation sooner, but continued to ask questions.
“I can’t believe this day is actually happening,” Gilda states with wide eyes. “Hannah first recruited me for this task six years ago. I’ve been beginning to think that it would never happen.”
Neither boy questioned it though and instead became excited about the prospect of going to a Halloween party together. They planned their costumes weeks in advance and spent the whole car ride to Cassie’s house signing excitedly between themselves. They stared out the window with awe as they drove into Cassie’s neighbourhood, cooing at the houses with the uphill driveways and the magnificent fountains that took up most of the front yards. Cassie’s house was just as spectacular as all of the others. Dark green hedges lined the front fence, shielding the marble columns and large eight paned windows of the front porch. Mary dropped the boys off, giving both Dean and Cas kisses on their cheeks, telling them to be good.
He feels a sensation in the pit of his stomach, a small pang of familiarity. While the place seems foreign to him, he knows that it is far from the truth. He guesses that Grace Island was either once his home, or it is somehow the place he’s now found himself in. He finds himself running his hand over the table top, his fingers dancing over the different regions of the island. At one point, his touch lingers on the centre of the map, where presumably, the island’s kingdom is.
The last thing he remembered from that time was fading into the darkness. He awoke again a hundred years later, in the bath, his memory of that night buried beneath the surface.
“Tell me, Miss. Do you see the glowing?”
“How is your training at the fortress going?” Castiel asked, wanting to direct the conversation away from his friend.
She looks over at him.
The next day, the travel takes up most of their day, so they only get to the Aether at nightfall. As they walk into the village, Dean is enchanted by the faeries who flutter around them. Considering he’s never met a faery, well, he doesn’t
In the distance, the sound of footsteps alerted them to the fact that someone was approaching.
When college ended and both Dean and Charlie moved back home, it was safe to say that everyone thought Cas would stay and work in Lawrence. Being an accountant, there were a multitude of places he could work. He’d even seen countless advertisements at the time, all looking for a full-time or part-time accountant within the Lawrence district. Yet, he surprised everyone when he announced that he had taken a job in Denver, a good five-hundred miles from home.
beginning to remember. And yet, it also confuses him. Missouri had also said that he and the prince were once close, and yet, that memory proved otherwise. The prince hated him, despised him and his royal duties. Did something change? What was he missing?
Relief sags through him and he grins, “I won’t, I promise. Thank you.”
There’s a long silence before Pamela speaks. “...You’re kidding.”
Dean grinned.
He aims towards the target, his hands positioning the bow before he even thinks about it. The position seems natural, easy, as if it’s something that Dean has done everyday.
“Well today is your lucky day,” Charlie says with a grin.
Dean’s story was interrupted by a familiar face entering the bakery.
“Mama will be pleased.” She says.
She signed.
“I may own a pair… or two.” Cas replies with a sly look in his eye.
one of her favourite movies of all time, when she bumped into my dad so hard that she knocked him flat on his ass.”
“It’s not that simple! I just… look, I like Cas. And he’s the only good friend I’ve had, even after just two weeks together. I trusted him, because… he saw this side of me that I’ve never really shown anyone before. He… got me. You know? We just clicked. And that scared me, so I spent two weeks pretending I didn’t think he was hot, or that I had this attraction to him… all up until that last night. And then when I left him, even though we both knew I had to leave for work, I
Dean watched the two adults talk animatedly before Michael indicated over to behind where Dean was sitting. The six-year-old turned to come face to face with blue eyes staring back at him. It was Michael’s brother, the boy from across the street. He sat at a table by himself, looking in the direction of Dean and his friends, a small longingness present in his eyes. Dean hadn’t noticed that at first, especially since the older woman who was sitting beside the boy began to sign to him. The boy directed his attention towards her and Dean faced his friends once again, despite the curious side of him wanting nothing more than to turn back to the boy behind him.
“Dean?” A voice groans.
He watches below as the markets and festivities are beginning to be set-up in the kingdom’s village. He is sure that he spots the red hair of Charlie somewhere down below, most likely ordering people around. She handles most of this stuff nowadays, her natural born leadership suits her role as the royal advisor. She is one of their closest companions, in fact, she is family. Castiel has only seen bits of pieces of what Charlie had done for Dean during his journey retrieving the fortresses, but after Dean told him the full extent, he knows that he will forever be in Charlie’s debt.
“Yep… let’s just say, Meg has a mean right hook.”
She only just got through making Dean’s name sign when Michael went to shut the door. Claire shot her foot out and stopped the door, sending a nasty glare towards him.
Dean nods.
“So, do I get an answer?” Dean asks with a grin. Cas is up in a heartbeat, racing towards him and connecting their lips. Dean immediately leans into the kiss, pulling Cas as close to his body as he can. The kiss isn’t heated or fast-paced, it’s slow and soft. Dean doesn’t think he will ever get tired of kissing Cas, no matter how many years they share together.
“I do hope you enjoy peppermint tea, Your Highness.”
He grabbed Castiel’s hand—to which his friend gave him a confused look—and led him over to his desk. He grabbed out a blank piece of paper and one of his pencils, pushing it into Castiel’s hand. This is how they communicated on a regular basis and if there was any way for Castiel to communicate what was troubling him… this was it.
Charlie doesn’t seem to be having the same thought pattern. Instead a smile spreads across her cheeks and her eyes twinkle with mischief.
THE DEAR DEAN PLAYLIST
Alastair pauses for a moment.
As both Missouri and Dean drank the lemonade and ate homemade biscuits, Dean filled her in on everything in detail. He talked about Kevin, about Moby and Mrs. Winnigan. He explained Kevin’s theory about how it may be linked to the veil, that all the spirits are stuck there. By the time their glasses were empty and there were only crumbs on their plate, Missouri was all caught up.
Mary had begun talking about her job when John Winchester got home from work. Being a teacher assistant for special needs children, she was talking about how she worked with a deaf boy who was also mute. Claire was absorbed in the conversation that she didn’t even notice the presence behind her until they spoke.
” She whimpers.
“There’s the birthday girl!” he cheers, walking over to Grace. Dean watches as Jimmy picks Grace up out of her playpen, while Cas enters the room with a woman and little girl in tow.
“I love you.” He blurts out before he can even stop himself.
Castiel sat down at the desk, the pencil poised above the piece of paper. Dean stared at the paper intensely, waiting to see what Castiel would draw. Instead of any explanation, as soon as Castiel’s pencil touched the paper, violent scribbles were spread all over the blank space. Dean watched with wide eyes as Castiel vented his frustrations through drawing, pushing the pencil in all different directions until the paper was covered in black. Castiel did this until there was no white left to cover. He then threw the pencil onto the desk and with a large sigh, he broke down again.
Of sorrow. He may not remember much of Hester, but he knows that he has never seen her make that face before.
Sam laughed and patted Jack on the back.
Dean first described Aaron as weird after meeting him. He remembered being alone in his dorm room with Cas, unpacking his shit while Aaron went to go get food in the cafeteria. He remembered looking around the room, pointing out the eccentric crap his new roommate had. From the books about Nazi history, the weird model statue on his desk and the bong by his bed. Cas didn’t seem fazed, but he wasn’t usually fazed by much. Dean remembered him sitting by the window as per usual, eyes closed as if he were sleeping.
“It also seems that your observational skills are also intact,” she says, “this is quite fascinating.”
“Don’t worry, I’ve got it,” she tells him, smiling smugly.
“Why?” Cas asks, tilting his head.
was the only one who could see them.
Michael stopped his sentence short as his little brother began to frantically tug on the hem of his pants. The boy seemed frightened and… almost confused. Dean looked on with worry as the boy began to whine, the sound high and soft in the back of his throat. Michael excused himself and knelt down so he could face the boy. He then began to sign.
Anyone who has ever had the fortune (or misfortune) of meeting Dean Winchester and his best-friend Charlie Bradbury, would know that Tuesdays were reserved for their weekly friend date.
“I don’t remember what I was like before, the knight I used to be. But for some reason, my body remembers how to fight. I know things without even thinking about them. And Charlie has navigational skills that I don’t possess, I’m bound to get lost if I were to travel alone. I… I don’t know what to expect with this journey or really, what my duty is meant to be. But I do know that I will protect Charlie with my life. I swear it.”
Castiel felt as if he was taking advantage of Dean, despite that Dean was willingly offering hugs and comfort. Maybe it was the guilt that he was hiding this secret about himself from Dean. That Dean was offering to share the bed with him, not knowing that Castiel actually appreciated the comfort provided in a different way than intended. Yet with the fear still an everlasting presence in his mind, he could not turn down such an offer.
Dean stands frozen in awe for a moment. While he knows Pamela loves him and cares about him, he had no idea she cared for him in this way. He feels a lump form in his throat.
And part of him worried that Dean’s voicemail wasn’t truthful, that he drove all the way here, just for Dean to tell him that they were better off as friends, or to cut him out of his life. He knew that was the most unlikely of options, yet he couldn’t help but feel like there was still a chance it could happen.
Dean nodded. “It’s a similar recipe but there are a lot of variations to it. Plus, the cheese cream icing is definitely a unique taste in comparison to the buttermilk.”
“So… why did you come along on this journey?” Dean asks.
He decided at that point that he wasn’t going to attempt to make introductions again and instead just co-exist with his unfriendly neighbour.
“It appears that my suspicions are confirmed.” Bobby states. “Dean, please step forward and grab the sword.”
“But duty calls, you know how it is,” Pam continues, “The big men upstairs wanted to run the numbers with me. Let’s just say, they were—
Dean blinks twice before sighing and nodding, sitting up slightly.
“Thank you,” Cas says in a breath of relief.
“I’m not particular. I’ll have whatever you are having.” he states.
His mother had never liked his interests in exploration and academia, although they were traits that he developed from his father. When he was younger, his mother did not complain as much. Mainly, because his father was King and from the royal bloodline, she could not command him nor her son to stop perusing in such hobbies. However, once his father died, his mother was crowned as Queen, on the agreement that when Castiel turned twenty-five, the throne was his. Now, especially during a time of such stress and turmoil, she held every bit of power over him. The thought made him reach for his father’s amulet, twirling it with his fingertips in an attempt to calm himself.
Cas is silent for a moment, still staring at Dean with the most despairing gaze. He puts his calculator and papers down on the side table and sits up straighter.
thoughts?
Dean nodded and the two boys headed towards the bus station, leaving their street behind.
He reassured Dean, causing the man’s shoulders to sag in relief. He turned back to the photo of Dean, looking out and pride in the photo, and decided to take a leap of faith.
He tried for a long time to ignore it, push it down into the deep pit of his stomach, just so that he could spend a few carefree minutes with Dean. But after a while, it began to eat away at him, the secret practically burning a hole inside of him. Soon, Dean began to cloud his mind and his dreams, as if he were a constant buzzing in the back of his head. It began to drive him crazy, making it hard for him to even be around Dean.
It was better if everyone thought that he was just focusing on his duties and that his personal hobbies and interests were kept in secret.
Cas inaudibly laughed at that.
Castiel wanted to ask,
Dean gave Cas a quick glance, who looked about as clueless as he was.
He grabbed his iPod from his side drawer, chucking on his headphones and finding his Metallica playlist. He closed his eyes as the heavy riffs and drum solos played heavily in his ears, attempting to drown out the sound of his own thoughts.
Cas said nothing but he seemed to be taking in and reflecting on everything Claire was saying.
Dean chews on his lip. Pam huffs.

but I’m not really in a partying mood.”
He’d said, hoping Dean could see the narrowing of his eyes in the dark.
“So what? Yes, not all people from the LGBT community you will come across will be so openly gay. Or, at least they won’t be so expressive. But there will be some that do come across, as you put it, flamboyant. They are allowed and proud to be. The community spent so many years being discriminated and repressed. While it isn’t all gone now, society as a whole has become more accepting.”
“Yeah I guess you could say that.” He admits, rubbing the sleep from his eyes.
They are led to her building, a quaint little house made from dark spruce wood and a white tiled roof. As soon as they step inside, they are met by an old woman, sitting comfortably in the corner of the room. She has faded blue eyes and soft grey hair on top of her head. She is small and frail, but seems to possess a lot of warmth and wisdom. She smiles at them.
The monster is in the corner of the room when Dean approaches, lazing against the wall. He looks over at Dean, disinterested.
On the way to the station, they passed their local park—the park they spent most of their childhood playing at. It looked creepily deserted in the dark, almost as if it was abandoned. The light Fall breeze pushed the swings back and forth, the rusty chains making a screeching sound every time they did. Dean went to avoid it, to continue on their journey to inner Lawrence—but Cas stopped him.
“Oh, I’m sorry. I’m so embarrassed.”
“I can’t make any promises,” Sam says. Dylan’s expression is pleading. “But I’ll try.”
"Before I would have said neither," Cas says. "But considering it now, I suppose I would prefer the zebra survive. Why should being weak or slow condemn a creature to death?"
Jason waves with two fingers.
Sam notices them as soon as they enter. Dean gives Sam two thumbs up, and Cas waves. Sam suppresses a smile.
“I’m almost at the bunker - meet me outside?”
“Where are we going?”
“Of course,” Hannah says. She looks concerned, but she just picks up the baby and exits to the kitchen.
“Or he’ll try to talk you out of it.”
“Dean move,” Cas demands.
“Told you it was hot,” Dean retorts with a smirk. “This, well this sounds like a real case.” He’s beginning to get excited.
“Sammy, check it out - They turned your old room into a gym,” Dean calls out. Sam looks around.
“I can give you an address,” she says, typing in her computer. “They’re at the Sigma Ta Delta house, just around the corner and down the block. One of them big yellow houses. Here.”
“That’s amazing,” Sam says breathlessly.
“I don’t know,” Sam says. “We don’t even know what’s doing this.”
“No way, man, he’s way dead.”
“I heard your prayers but I couldn’t come right away. It was too dangerous. Believe me, every second in there, every second away from you, it was agony.” Dean takes another step.
Dean is jolted awake by the sound of applause. Cas nudges him, and Dean joins in - clapping enthusiastically with a few “woop”s thrown in. Cas gives him a judgmental side-eye glance.
“Well, I’ll go wherever Dean goes,” Cas says.
“So, I’ll check out the sorority house, you check out the fraternity,” Sam says.
“Are you kidding me? Again?” comes a woman’s voice. The boys jolt in surprise. There’s a woman standing in the middle of the kitchen. She has sleek red hair, and a gaunt face.
“Hi Sam,” she says. “Hand it over.”
“We need to do an MRI scan to be sure,” she says. “I’ll get you a wheelchair.”
Sam is woken up by Dean, vigorously shaking him.
“Then... what’s missing?”
“I am quite tired,” Cas mutters. His breath is hot against Dean’s skin.
“He had brown hair,” she says. “And he wore a tie. And a long coat.”
“Do you think I can help it? Wanting you to be safe?”
“What? Why?” The feeling of respite that had been settling in Dean’s chest dissolves.
“You mean Angela?”
They head back outside. As they leave, a tall blonde college girl passes by. She slows, and looks Dean up and down. Dean smirks, to which her expression falls. She fast-walks away. Sam chuckles, and grabs the post-it note from Dean. They follow the receptionist’s directions.
“FBI,” Sam calls out. No answer. He strides through the house, gun in hand. It’s neater than the fraternity house - all white furniture and polished wood. Floorboards creak beneath him. It smells of candles.
“You got caught,” Sam replies. “If I hadn’t been there in time, who knows what would’ve happened.”
Deans face drops. It’s not that Cas is stuck in the Empty. It’s not even that he can’t hear Dean’s prayers. He just doesn’t want to see him.
“Research. What are you doing?”
“You’re crazy, Bill,” drawls the older man.
“Physical therapy? Are we really doing that?”
Jason says goodbye to a few of his colleagues, and he and Dean round the corner to the side of the building.
Footsteps. Dean looks up. Sam walks towards them.
“I’ll make the announcement.”
And eventually, Dean dies. Not too young, but the cheeseburgers were to blame. He still got further than he ever thought he would. Sam is there, and it’s agony. Cas wants to heal Dean, but it’s okay. Dean stops him. He’ll just get older anyway, and he’ll never look this pretty again. It hurts. Cas knows Dean will be okay, but it still hurts. He grips him tight. And Dean fades.
“Sure, okay,” Sam says. “I’ll take Miracle out. Need anything before I go?”
Dean goes to heaven, and Cas meets him there.
“Sure.”
“Things have been good,” she says. Miracle leaps ahead of her, tugging at the leash. “I get to spend a lot of time with my girlfriend.”
They squint at each other.
“What kind of stuff?” Sam pries, leaning forward.
Jason scrambles backwards, scraping his feet and elbows against the ground. Before he gets the chance to stand, Cas places a foot on his chest, pinning him there like a butterfly on display. Jason clasps his hand around Cas’ ankle and struggles to break free - Cas doesn’t budge an inch. Cas grips the angel blade tight in his fist. His knuckles are white.
“And what about you? I can’t stand seeing you miserable like this.”
“Come in,” she says.
“What? Why?” Sam asks. Jack sighs.
“Both of them,” Sam says.
Dean’s eyes bulge in horror. He can’t move. He can’t speak. A venomous pain spreads through his body. It starts dull, then crescendos into unimaginable agony. Dean wheezes, and blood spills from his mouth. It spills from his eyes, streaking down his face.
“You do?” Dean asks.
“I’m sorry,” she says.
“Hey!” Jason interjects, offended.
“Keep your voice down,” Dean hisses.
"It'll be quick," the angel says, noticing Cas' reluctance. "There is a couple who just arrived - A man and a woman who died together in a car crash. I would allocate them together, but the man has a late wife who is waiting for him here."
Dean is back in his hospital bed. Doctor Khan is explaining something to him, but he can barely pay attention. He keeps playing the fight over in his head. He could have reacted sooner. He could have stepped to the side. He hears the doctor say the words “lucky” and “incomplete,” but the latter feels more accurate. She says that it’s a good sign that he has some movement in his legs, and that there’s reason to be hopeful. She prescribes pills. Sam is polite and understanding and it pisses Dean off. This whole thing pisses him off. He wishes he could stand up and march out of there.
“The last time I was human, the experience was colored by confusion and dejection. However, food,” Cas says, looking lovingly at the burger. “Food provided me with great joy.”
“To tell you the truth I’m getting a little sick of people asking that,” Dean replies. As soon as he says this, he feels guilty for being unfriendly. Something about this guy makes him want to make a good impression.
“I still feel like you are.”
Dean’s heart is racing. Tears well in Olivia’s eyes. Her face is childlike - she can’t be older than 18. But she’s scared. The color is drained from her face, and she’s shivering. The gun is shaking. It’s as though the barrel is a coal-black eye - staring Dean down, taunting him. The eye of an old friend with a grudge.
“Good,” Dean says. He gives the car a once-over, and points at the scratch. “Billy, you’re gonna have to buff that out.”
“Is Dean okay?”
“I went over to the sorority house a few days before she officially went missing. It was… weird. The vibe was off. I think Katie was bleeding? Angela had stopped talking to me since the animal thing started happening. I didn’t know why. Katie told me that Angela wasn’t home, but I went in and she was there. Just… standing. I couldn’t see her face. Everyone was crowded around her. Like, all of the girls in the house were there. I called her name but she wouldn’t answer. She wouldn’t even look at me. Katie was just like, ‘she doesn’t want to see you,’ and pushed me out. And then a few days later I hear that she’s missing.”
“I don’t see the connection.”
A few days later, Dean and Sam are sitting in the bunker, scouring the news like they normally do, looking for potential cases. Fast food wrappers and a couple empty beer bottles are scattered across the table. Sam finds a couple weird news stories - a two headed snake, some lady claiming to have birthed an alien baby - nothing up their alley. He tries to do research for his book instead, but he gets distracted by Dean’s furious typing.
“I’m happy to see you too,” Cas says.
“Dean,” Sam says. “After you got back from the hospital - Patience called me. She told me she had a vision that you died at the barn.”
“It doesn’t feel real,” Dean says. “Sometimes I tell him I love him just to hear him say it back. Just to make sure.”
“What about you,” Dean stammers. “What have you been up to?”
“Okay, liven up, Eeyore,” Dean says.
“…Sure,” Dean says, eyeing her. “What’s for dessert?”
“It’s good to be back.” Dean turns the key in the ignition, the engine revs.
Dean and Sam take a seat on the couch. Hannah comes out of the kitchen with a plate of cookies. A fat baby sits in a high chair in the corner. It looks at Dean in judgement. Dean is taken aback, offended. Hannah sets the plate down and takes a seat across from them.
There’s a knock on the door, which causes Dean to jolt awake. Still coming to his senses, he bounds up the stairs, skipping steps on the way. He swings the door open. On the other side stands Castiel.
“I know, I’m just joking,” he says. Dean laughs in relief. “But I’m not going to heal you.”
“He can come back,” she whispers. “He can bring her back.”
“Yeah, for now. But if you get better, or if Cas can heal you -”
"I want to create a world that is free of suffering. How can I do this when pain is already ingrained into the world we have? Humans hurt each other, but that hurt helps them grow. Does that then justify the pain?"
Dean picks up his phone and passes it between his hands. Sam said Charlie would be in town today. He wonders if she’s still nearby. He considers it for a moment, then gives her a call. After a few rings, she answers.
“Cas, it’s me again,” Dean mutters, almost whispers.
“Do you know who this guy was?” Sam asks, hoping to draw attention away from Dean.
“Her name is Angela Chalmers - she went to school here,” Sam says.
“Are you seriously hoping that that’s what we’re dealing with here? Azazel?”
“Why would I lie?”
And then the waves pull back again, to reveal a man splayed out, face buried in the sand.
“I figure since hunting’s off the table, I should look for other options.”
Sam waits for them to leave. Once they do, he turns back to Dylan.
Dean’s skin splits under the pressure of the blade.
“I… can’t.”
“Sure,” Dean says. “Open it.” Sam gulps, grips the handle, and opens the door.
“Do you teach as well?” Cas asks.
“Thanks,” Sam says sarcastically.
“Yes, that’s correct.”
“5 slices is nothing - I can do triple that if you give me more time.”
Dean goes to his room and shuts the door behind him. With a huff, he places the rattling pill bottles on his bedside table. Bottles of beer litter the floor. Dean picks one up, and pops it open with a knife, and takes a swig. The bubbles fizzing against his lips comfort him. He takes a few more gulps, then sets the empty bottle down on the floor. It topples over and rolls under the bed. Dean sniffles and rubs his face in his hands, then lets out a deep sigh.
“You ladies working or gossiping?” comes the voice of authority.
He pauses.
Jack stands below, raising a hand in greeting.
“I suppose, in that case, it would be foolish for me to continue in this line of work as well,” Cas adds.
“Hands off, remember?” Jack says, wiggling his fingers.
“Cas,” Dean grunts. It’s deep into the night, he’s sitting at the edge of his bed, and he’s surrounded by empty bottles. His hands are clasped in front of his bowed head - snug in their grasp is a jacket, a handprint seared on its shoulder.
He sets down his notes and gives Dean a hug.
“No, man, but look. I’m happy to be out here again. Saving things, hunting people, you know.”
“The game is almost over,” Sam says. “Dean, how’s your stomach?”
“Could be,” Roger says.
“I like it,” Cas says, smiling.
“What can I do you for?”
Dean gestures with his head, and rolls towards the street. Charlie tries to push him, but he shoos her away and hands her Miracle’s leash.
“What are you talking about?”
“I didn’t think the rumors were true,” Jason says. “Dean Winchester, destined to certain death. Written in stone, until it wasn’t.”
“You have room for dessert?”
“Dean?”
“I lost,” Sam says.
“Good,” Jack says. He takes a deep breath, and places two fingers on Dean’s forehead. Jack’s eyes flash gold. Dean collapses to the floor.
“Does anyone else live here,” Dean asks.
“Sorry Sammy,” Dean says, and punches the black mass. It shudders, and melts away. Sam gasps for breath.
“Yeah, I get you. Are you in much pain these days?” Jason asks. Dean assumes that Jason is obligated to ask this question, but it comes across as sincere.
“Hey Eileen!” Dean says, signing as he speaks. Eileen puts a finger to her lips.
The woods neighboring the bunker are perfect for a dog, but the desolate quiet is perfect for Sam. He’s still uneasy from the car ride back from the hospital, from Dean’s anger. Sam knows that Dean feels hopeless, and since Dean tends to let his emotions burn hot, that hopelessness necessarily turns into frustration. It’s no wonder Dean lashed out - that frustration needs somewhere to go. Sam reminds himself that Dean is probably just as angry at himself as he is at Sam, if not more. Sam, on the other hand, is still in the problem-solving phase of adversity. Maybe it’s out of relief that his brother is still alive, and by such a narrow margin, but hopelessness has not yet managed to sink its claws into him.
“I’m sure,” Cas says, nodding along incredulously.
Dean pointedly jerks himself away from Sam and makes his way to the back door.
“Sam, I fucked up,” Dean says. “He did it to save me. Billie was gonna get us and he - well he bit the bullet. I have to be honest with you, but I’ve felt like crap this whole time.”
Sam looks up at his student. He points at her inquisitively, and a smile grows on his face, and transforms into a wide grin.
“Informative.”
“That's what it's like, when you get something you never thought you could have.”
“Well it looks like something did,” Sam says. “But… what? And why the scar?”
“Did you feed the cat this morning?” Dean asks.
“Heaven. For now,” Cas says, wading desperately to keep himself afloat. “I’ll come to you in due time.”
Dean sighs.
“You’re on your own kid,” Dean tells Jack. In the blink of an eye, the top box is flipped open and Dean is munching on a slice.
“Dean, come play poker with us!” Claire says. Alex rattles the poker chips in her hand while Patience fans herself with a hand of cards.
“I didn’t come to ask for help,” Cas replies. “I came to say goodbye.” Dean looks at him in disbelief. It feels like a cruel joke, to be losing Cas again.
Sam is confused. He squints back.
“Take care,” Sam says.
“Dean,” Cas says. “I can’t stay.”
“Well it was built to have more people in it,” Sam says. “I sometimes wish it was still like the old Men of Letters days.”
“Yeah, I… guess….”
“I hope not.”
“Awesome.”
“Yeah, like I said.”
“You can?”
“Oh, Castiel! He talks about you constantly,” Jack replies cheerfully.
Dean thinks for a moment.
“Let me guess, the ‘67 impala out front is yours?” Jason says. He repeats the same movements on Dean’s other leg.
“So hunting’s lost its magic?”
“Oh, shut up. Hannah?” Dean calls out. Hannah shuffles back in.
With a sigh, he clasps his hands together.
“Right,” Sam says, nodding along incredulously. “How do you feel about eggs and bacon?”
“You do?” Dean says incredulously.
“So what do you want from me?” Dean asks.
“Anything to recite?” Dean asks. “It’s been a while since I’ve flexed my latin.”
“Dude, stop, just-” Dean protests, swatting Sam away.
“Jack!” Claire interrupts.
“‘On Earth as it is in Heaven’,” Cas recites, looking off at Dean. “How are you?”
“Likewise,” Jack says. “In due time.”
“I should help Sam pack up. Meet you in a bit?” Eileen says.
“Cas,” he says, softly. “I hope you can hear me. I hope I’m not too late.”
“This isn’t an argument, Dean. You almost died.”
“You had me worried there,” Sam says.
Sam isn’t so sure, but he decides it’d be fruitless to try to argue.
“I know,” Jack says with a smile. “Dean was a victim of his own heroism. The hero of a story that demanded a tragic end. I had to circumvent that.”
“If Patience didn’t cheat…” Kaia says.
“Look, my brother and I know your little secret,” Dean says, sticking a finger in Jason’s face.
“I’m Dr. Khan. How are you feeling?”
“Jumanji.”
“This is serious,” Jason says. “Something rewrote time. Something powerful. And whatever it is, it needs you alive.”
“So Cas is gonna lock himself in Heaven?” Sam asks.
“No! Well, yes. It was an accident,” Jack says.
“Yes. The renegade angel suddenly wants us all to follow orders and come back home,” Jason replies. “Obviously I’m not going.”
“You don’t think it’s Azazel again, do you?”
“What, why?”
“Those fraternity boys, always getting into trouble,” she says.
Dean looks at him with suspicion. Something’s off about this guy.
“Wha- I - that’s not the point.”
“And then? What’s your plan after that?”
“I’m… still not sure I understand the rules of the game,” Cas says.
Sam goes and picks up lunch from a local deli. He brings back a sandwich for Dean, who is still sitting in the same spot when he comes back. Sam offers him the sandwich, but he refuses, saying he isn’t hungry. The day goes on. Dean passes some time reading, then getting bored of reading. He paces around the room. He does push-ups, He bounces a tennis ball against the brick wall. Every so often, the thought creeps into his head - maybe Castiel isn’t coming back. Maybe he’s back in Heaven already. Dean brushes those thoughts aside. Eventually it becomes night, and eventually Sam goes to sleep, but Dean stays awake. He stays awake until his eyes become heavy, and blinking feels like a relief. His blinks become longer, until eventually he blinks for too long, and he’s asleep - face down on the desk, resting on crossed arms.
“Sorry about that earlier, Sammy,” Dean says coolly. “Cas just needed a change of clothes and he dropped by to pick some up.”
“Oh, do I? No, I was just thinking,” Sam replies.
“You must understand that if you make this decision, it will be permanent,” Cas says. “You’ll be human. You’ll age like a human, and you’ll spend the rest of your days here on Earth.”
“Different how?”
“Yeah, you see? Being human isn’t so bad,” Dean says wistfully.
“Maybe we can heal you some other way.”
But Jack isn’t alone. At the far end of the room, Charlie leans on a bookcase, next to Jodie and Donna. At the table, Claire, Patience, Alex, Kaia, and Jack sit around a smattering of playing cards. And of course, Miracle is there, barking like mad.
“Cas! Look at me,” Dean says, cradling Cas’ face. They are struck by another wave. It submerges Cas and seeps through Dean’s clothes. Dean drags Cas, limp, further up shore. Cas comes to his senses, coughing up water. He’s disorientated and frantic, until he locks eyes with Dean.
Jack stands, and as he does, he holds the computer with two hands, slowly raising it over his head. He hesitates, and looks at the others. Jessica, lounging apathetically in her chair. Dean, limp and lifeless, cradled in his brother’s arms. Sam, doing the cradling, looking at Jack in tortured distress. And Cas, standing upright, looking at Jack with absolute faith.
“Nah, I can take this - Jack’s gotta learn from the master,” Dean says.
Sam sighs.
“So no pain in your legs.”
“I know, Dean.”
The brothers are taken aback.
“What kind of changes?” Sam asks.
“I want you to give yourself a break, for once,” Sam says. “And let me do this.”
"Jack, why are you telling me this?"
“Honey, don’t worry. He’s one of my patients,” Jason tells his husband. “Go back inside. This won’t take long.” Jason’s husband reluctantly closes the door.
“You sure you don’t want to stay?” he asks.
“I know. And I’m trying.”
“Hey…” Dean coos. “C’mon.”
“Choking,” Dean wheezes, banging his palm against the table. His face turns red. Sam’s annoyance turns to panic.
“Who also happens to be a man,” Charlie adds.
“Yeah, we got that. Why is it writing everything we do?” Dean shouts.
"But then how can I be certain my choices are the right ones?"
“I’ll know what to do,” Dean finishes.
“It’s just - the stitches are gone. I can barely even see the scar.”
“We decided to bake - “ Jack starts.
“Yes, that is accurate,” Cas replies.
“I haven’t got much time,” Cas says.
“Cas. Buddy, listen to me, I have an idea,” Dean says. Cas is breathing heavily through his bloodied nose, jaw clenched, beautiful. Looking at Dean, his expression softens. Behind Dean, Jason lifts himself to his feet and lunges forward.
Castiel’s eyes snap open. They are blinding white.
“Just me and my husband,” Hannah replies.
“No!”
“Even without dying, you could be tortured, mutilated-” Cas says grimly.
“I have an excellent poker face,” Cas says, striding forward. “I will avenge you, Jack.”
“That’s pretty forward, even coming from you,” Dean replies. He continues looking through the drawer, trying to conceal his rush of adrenaline elicited by the question.
“So, the file got corrupted, which made all that… not happen,” Sam clarifies.
Jack hands Jessica the bag of chips. He takes a step towards Dean. He looks determined. For the first time, looking at Jack, Dean doesn’t see a powerful monster or a tortured kid. He sees someone aware of his responsibilities. He sees an adult.
“He asked about you,” Jack says.
“To escape his former life of crime!” Bill says.
“Uh, anything else?” Sam asks, already standing up.
“Like what?”
“Oh, right. Angela,” the young man says, his demeanor becoming more solemn.
Cas walks up to Dean.
“You don’t need to prove yourself to me, man. You’ve already done enough. I don’t need your help or your loyalty or your sacrifice. I don’t even need you here with me. But I want you, dammit, and that should be enough.”
“What do you remember?” Sam asks, leaning in.
“No need,” Cas says, smiling softly. “I heard your prayer.”
“Yeah,” she says, eyeing Dean. “We live together, and hunt together. It… it feels good to settle down, and with someone who understands, y’know?”
“He’ll want to help. He’ll put himself at risk,” Cas says.
“Are we gonna talk about what happened back there?” Sam asks.
They arrive at the bunker. Sam turns the keys, and the impala’s engine shudders to a stop. He gets out of the car. Dean doesn’t. He sits there, with his arms across his chest. Sam opens the passenger seat door and helps Dean into his wheelchair. Sam helps a lot, and it’s irritating. They take the elevator down.
“Is that how you got -” Charlie swirls her hand in a gesture at his face.
“We had apples, so I thought… Anyway, Jack, how are you?” Sam asks, gesturing for him to sit down. Jack doesn’t.
“Well, how do you feel?’ Dean asks. Cas thinks for a moment.
“Do what, send Jason back to Heaven?” Cas asks, squinting.
“Can you tell us the address of this house? We’d like to do an interview. Cover our bases.”
“Research for a hunt?” Dean asks.
“This whole time,” Dean mutters. He paws at Cas’ coat, at his hair, as if feeling to make sure he’s really there.
“It’s dangerous!”
“Do I what?”
Any other day, Dean would know that he would be asking too much of an Alpha without providing anything in return, but in his worried state, he couldn’t think about consequences. He just needed to make his father happy. Castiel nods and kisses Dean’s forehead once more.
Sam chuckles and strips to his underwear before climbing in and swimming over to Gabriel.
Cas snores on, completely oblivious to his husband.
He climbs aboard his Royal Carriage, heading for the eighth Kingdom and potential Alpha in the week. He had just heard of one, Prince Gabriel Shurley, willing to take him as an Omega and to rule the Kingdom.
Dean clings onto Castiel’s suit, nuzzling into his shoulder and allowing himself to cry. Castiel rubs small circles into his back, scenting him gently. Dean drifts in and out of uneasy sleep; his dreams filled with night terrors and his waking hours filled with anxiety and dread.
Dean nods and swallows, licking his lips nervously, before entering the room. King Winchester was not looking well, his skin far too pale and stretched far too thin over his gaunt, boney face. The pillows and blankets that envelope him, seem to swamp his thin figure. It is hard to believe that this man had once led armies into battle. Dean kneels down beside his father and takes his fragile hand in his. Even though he is sleeping Dean doesn’t know what else to do. He looks up as a nurse approaches.
As the King arrives, Dean carefully stands holding Cas in his hands as he bows.
Dean nods and looks over his father. “I’ve found an Alpha father. You would like him. He treats me kindly, gently, like I’m precious. It reminds me of how you were to Mother. I’ve only just met him but he’s here to look after me. To look after us. He is so kind. And so beautiful. He looks more like an angel. His soft blue eyes that are so, so deep. His deep voice that sounds like a thick warm blanket. His warm skin that feels like a cocoon. Father, I think he’s the one. He is the one. I knew as soon as I saw him, that he was the Alpha for me. Already, I’m thinking about giving him a family. He’s the one that I want to settle down with. No more sparring with the knights. No more hunts. He makes me want to be domestic, like a true Omega.”
“Oh one last thing if you’re so inclined.” Dean says quickly. “We have trouble saying your names, I don’t know if you’d like to each choose a human name. The other Kingdoms may see you as less threatening if they can pronounce your names.”
“Wha- who are you?”
They lead Dean into his suite, in silence for the rest of the trip, and sit him down on the long, plush sofa. The two Alphas sitting either side of him. Dean automatically leans into Castiel, he is much warmer than Gabriel, and has an aura of love and kindness surrounding him. Castiel’s arm wraps around Dean’s shoulders, not seeming to mind the broadness of them or the goosebumps that rise as Castiel touches him.
“And this is Prince Castiel. My second Alpha son. He is much more of a scholar than Prince Gabriel, preferring to spend his time in the library, learning and gaining wisdom from the books of old. Though don’t be deterred, he is just the leader Prince Gabriel is.”
“Thank you, for being you. I- I’m starting to think that maybe- you’re the one I should bring back to meet father.” He blushes softly.
“I’ll be your Alpha, Dean. I’ll be whatever you want me to be.” Cas promises.
“More important than helping Cas and Dean to integrate dragons?”
Dean smirks and leaves a lingering kiss to Cas’ lips as he sits up. He takes the base of Cas’ cock in his hand and, without prepping or any more lube than what his body had already produced, sits carefully onto Cas’ cock. He inches his way down the long, thick shaft, letting out moans and grunts until he is fully seated on Cas’ member. He moans loudly, squirming to try and get comfortable.
Dean smiles warmly up at Prince Castiel, his warm blue eyes inviting him into his Palace.
“He has been given the message also. I’m so sorry, if there was a way to cure him, we would tell you.” The King says, sincerely.
“My little Omega, already so excited for the rest of our lives together.” Cas chuckles, helping Dean undress.
“You do know how to pleasure an Alpha.” Cas chuckles, after they had both come down from their highs.
“Take Castiel and return home. Your father has taken a turn for the worse and wishes to speak to you. If you do not wish for Castiel to be your Alpha, send him back.” The King says softly.
Dean freezes, suddenly feeling incredibly nauseous and dizzy. “M- my brother.” He stammers.
“Stop it Gabe. You’re supposed to be welcoming.” Castiel scolds.
King Shurley nods, “Of course your Highness. We actually have two Alphas hoping to win your heart.” He chuckles as he motions to the two Alphas standing behind him.
The King smiles softly, “and I’m sure he feels the same way about you. If you may extend the courtesy, may we stay one more night? I wish to speak with Cas before we leave.”
“Filling. And something I want more of.” Dean moans and almost comes, as he leans down to kiss Cas; Cas’ cock hitting his prostate. “I don’t know if I can live without it, now I’ve tried it.”
Dean frowns and nods, “how did you know?”
Dean gently picks Cas up and lays his back down on his pillow, pressing a soft kiss to the top of his head. He dresses and orders breakfast for them both before starting to organise his office, getting everything he needed for his meeting with the King of the Dragons. He collects his breakfast from his guard and sits on the bed with it beside Cas.
“We were once a part of your Alliance, you know. Many, many generations ago, you’re ancestors feared us, thought we were getting too powerful, too strong so they drove us out. Made us fear for our lives when all we did was invest wisely.”
Sam blinks as he looks at the dragon sitting beside him. He has blue undertones to his skin, and is wearing a light tunic and trousers.
“If we may speak, informally for a moment.”
Gabriel nods and smiles. They both stand and Sam offers his elbow to Gabriel, who clings onto it excitedly.
“Isn’t that what I just said?”
“Well that’s a good start, how could you tell? My beauty? My grace?”
Dean carries his case behind and opens up the divider before starting to change. He changes in a dark green dress, his shoulders still bare and a thin cape, wrapping around his neck, to protect his scent glands, before flowing out behind him. He steps out from behind the screen and looks down to the floor, twirling slowly for Castiel to see.
“And you’re water?”
Castiel chuckles and picks Dean up in his arms, “you tell me where to go and I’ll stay with you. How does that sound?”
Sam nods. “It’s out of the castle walls, but I think you’ll love it.”
“We will give you as much money as you need.”
“My aides will bring your travel trunk. They will follow us home. Let’s just get you home.” Castiel says, gently steering Dean down the grand stairs and into the waiting carriage.
“A Prince?”
Sam smiles and leans back as he looks at Gabriel. “How are you finding the Kingdom so far?”
Castiel seems to have the same idea, his hand reaching down to cup Dean’s cheek as he looks into Dean’s green eyes. He leans forward and gently presses his lips to Dean’s, barely a brush before he leans back. Dean flushes and quickly looks away. Castiel likes him. Likes him enough to kiss him already.
“Need some help there?” A voice calls as they step around a bookshelf to face Sam.
Sam smiles. “Would you like a tour?”
Sam nods, “I don’t like thinking of you as Prince Water Dragon.”
“Hey Cas, are we waking up today?” Dean coos as he strokes his head. “Come on sleepyhead.”
Dean bows his head as the King leaves.
He steps up the shorter Alpha and bows and takes his hands, kissing it. His hand feels callous and cold, Dean can feel the strength and muscles there.
“No, no. I’m the best in general.”
“I need to go in first. I- if he is…” Dean swallows hard, unable to bring himself to say it. “Then I need to make his final hours happy. Will you pretend, pretend to be my Alpha. Even if I do send you home.”
“I- will you be okay on your own? I don’t want to leave you if you’re just going to cry again.” Castiel smiles warmly, cupping Dean’s cheek.
Sam nods. “I’ll come with you.”
“You are the most beautiful Omega I’ve met, I would do anything for you. To be your Alpha, even just to pretend, is all I want to be.” Castiel whispers.
They walk together arm in arm. Gabriel points out pictures and doorways and Sam tells him the history of the castle, who the people are in the pictures and where the doorways lead to. They head out of the castle and walk upstream until they get to a small lake surrounded by soft grass and tall trees. At one end, a tall waterfall fills the lake with foamy water. Gabriel beams and goes onto his tiptoes kisses Sam’s cheek before undressing and diving into the water.
After hours of riding and fear, they arrived in the Winchester Kingdom. Dean clings to Castiel, as they climb out, needing his scent and his warmth. He leads Castiel to the King’s bed chambers and holds up a hand.
Dean smiles softly. “So he’s not ill?”
Castiel pulls Dean into a tight hug and kisses his forehead. “You would make me the happiest man alive. Come along. I’ll show you to the dinning hall.”
“Are you sure?” Cas asks, gently pushing on Dean’s shoulders to break the kiss. “After everything that you’ve been through, are you sure?”
“5. 5 different breath types. Fire, ice, acid, lightening, and water, which is clearly the best.”
Cas nods, “of course. Just pretend?”
“We’re going to have a baby Cas.” Dean beams. “We’re going to be a family.”
“What are you doing here, this is restricted.”
“Okay gorgeous, well I’ll be speaking with your father when you do decide to join us.”
Dean hums and once naked, leans back down to kiss Cas. He grinds his wet hole against Cas’ clothed cock, showing him how much he wants this.
“Your Majesty, I sincerely appreciate my invitation to come here.”
“Then stay. Dean and your father have been discussing trade.”
“The fire is the most common. My father, my mother, Cas. Most of my siblings.”
“You’re wearing clothes.”
“You chose your breath?”
“I’m a Prince.”
Sam shakes his head and watches as Gabriel shifts into his medium sized dragon form, his royal blue scales, glistening with water. Sam reaches out and gently strokes a hand over his scales. Gabriel butts into his hand before diving into the water, splashing Sam as he goes down. Sam laughs and rubs the water from his face as he spins, looking for the dragon. Gabriel pops back up the other side of the waterfall. Sam swims over to him and splashes him with water from the waterfall.
Dean nods before they start to discuss deals and trade, money and opportunities. Dean learns that the King wishes for his dragons to be a part of their Alliance of Kingdoms, and that they don’t wish to be ostracised any longer.
“An Omega Winchester, huh. I bet your father doesn’t like that much.” Gabriel teases.
“No, no. It’s better I do it alone.”
“Do you want to lead? Let me see how you like it.” Cas smirks.
“No, no, quite the opposite. He is content and right now, in the perfect place on your lap. He needs to know you’re close. That connection between him and you and your children.”
Dean smiles as he takes his seat after the Dragon King, and places Cas back in his lap. “Your welcome, your majesty. Where would you like to begin?”
“This was my favourite place as a child.” Sam beams.
Cas grumbles and nips Dean’s finger. Dean chuckles as he picks the tiny dragon up, he places him on his shoulder, as Cas snuggles into his neck and goes back to sleep. Dean orders for the King of the Dragons to be brought up to his office as sits at his desk, and places Cas on his knee. He puts the tray of food on the table, in case Cas wakes up hungry.
“You should change, travel-wear is uncomfortable to relax in.” Cas states, as if nothing had happened.
Castiel cups Dean’s cheek again, who leans heavily into the Alpha’s hand. Castiel gently rubs his thumb over Dean’s lips, before looking up into Dean’s eyes. Dean knows what the Alpha wants, so when Dean nods, he’s not at all surprised when Castiel pushes his thumb into the Omega’s mouth. Dean sucks on it softly, unable to break eye contact with Castiel. No Alpha had ever been this soft with him before. No Alpha had ever shown this much care and compassion before. Dean smiles softly, starting to enjoy the company of Castiel, starting to imagine their future together. He sucks idly on Castiel’s thumb, trying to ignore the hardness pressing into his thigh. He starts to think about their Kingdoms and what a powerful Kingdom like Shurley’s would mean for his relatively small one. It would mean power and influence. It would mean protection. And, dear Lords, did they need protection. From every other Kingdom surrounding them thinking they could try to take over. And his father tried to expand their Kingdom through warfare, Dean had never known a life where battle and battle strategy wasn’t the most important thing. But he had always known that that’s not what he wanted when his Alpha came to power. Dean wanted growth for his Kingdom, no matter how small the Kingdom was and he could see, looking into Castiel’s eyes, that he was the perfect Alpha for the job.
Sam frowns, “how many different-?”
“Is there somewhere to bathe? A pool or freshwater?” Gabriel asks.
King John ever so minutely squeezes Dean’s hand, if he hadn’t had been looking for it, he would have missed it. As if trying to say that he welcomes Castiel. Before stilling once more, his breathing becomes quieter and quieter until his chest stops moving altogether. Dean watches as his father dies, before dropping his head onto the blanket and sobbing.
Dean nods and starts to direct Castiel to his bed chambers.
“Oh is it? I’ve found that your guards don’t question a four foot dragon wandering the halls. To be truthful I don’t think they can tell us all apart.”
“Cas is in his after-mating stage, he’s sleeping off the effects of yesterday. He’ll be like this for as long as the mating period lasted for.” The King explains.
Dean just nods, sighing softly and resting against Castiel’s shoulder. All too soon, it seems, there was a knock at the door, and an aide stepped into the room.
“Oh it’s wonderful. Are you joining me?” Gabriel calls.
“Fine. I’m going to check on dinner, make sure the staff know to set a place for Prince Winchester.” Gabriel huffs, leaving the room before Dean could call him back.
Dean wakes the next morning, in his bed with the familiar weight of Cas in his chest. He smiles down at Cas and strokes his head softly.
“There we go.” The dragon grabs a chair and moves it so he can sit beside Sam.
“There’s a room divider, I’m sure you don’t want to undress in front of me.” Castiel hums, pointing to a white and gold room divider, folded up in the corner of the room.
“We will give you anything you wish for.” The King promises.
They play and laugh for ages, until they both climb ashore laughing and panting heavily. Sam collapses on his back as Gabriel cuddles into his side.
Dean kisses Castiel’s neck one last time before standing up and offering a hand to the Alpha.
Sam smiles, “it’s nice to meet you Prince Gabriel.”
“Someone’s worn out. It must be from all that travelling and sex. Sleep little Omega, sleep and everything will be alright.” Cas whispers as he uses his free hand to pull the blankets up around them.
In the library, Sam leans on one elbow as he reads through books about dragons. He rubs his eyes and leans back, trying to work out what was true and what is fake in the conflicting information.
Dean shakes his head. “Everyone will see us. If you’re with me, you’re with me forever. You’ll be my Alpha, we’ll bond and-” Dean chokes back another sob.
Before Sam could reiterate, the human roars beside him, and turns to smile. “Oh you mean a name you can pronounce?”
He doesn’t know how long it is before he feels two arms wrap around his shoulders, gently guiding him to stand up. He fights to keep hold of his father’s hand, not wanting to leave him, not wanting to let him go. Though, eventually, he does and turns to collapse into the waiting arms. He allows himself to be guided out of the Royal Bed Chambers and into the adjacent room and sits him on the bed. Dean sobs into Castiel’s chest, clinging onto his shirt.
“You look so pretty, Dean. Come here, let me have a closer look.”
“Of course. You’re welcome to stay as long as you wish.”
“But there’s- wait you’re a dragon.”
“Good, though I’m still trying to learn my way around the Castle.”
Dean looks down at his feet as he walks, hating to just be labelled as an Omega. “My father respects me for who I am, Your Highness.” He whispers.
With that Gabriel stands and shifts into his large dragon form, he licks Sam’s cheek before taking off back to the castle. Sam sits up and sighs, hoping that Gabriel could stay, he’d like to have him around, especially if it meant more time spent in the water. He stands and dresses before carrying Gabriel’s clothes back to the castle.
“Would you like to stay in the guest room tonight?” Dean asks, he doesn’t know why but there is a yearning for Castiel to sleep with him. Not wanting to be alone. Not tonight. Not ever again.
“No. I still need you closer. Come, sit down.” Castiel chuckles, gently pulling Dean onto his lap. “Hmm, I know it’s your choice, but I will never tire from waking up, and seeing such a beautiful face on the pillow beside me.”
Dean nods and pushes away from the table, running a hand through his pristine hair, messing it up. He couldn’t care less for posture and politics and politeness right now. He just needs to get home. Castiel follows him out of the hall, bowing quickly to his father, and places a hand on Dean’s back.
Dean thinks.
The pair of Alpha wore matching black suits, with rich, dark green embroidery around the neck and down their chests. A heavy, black cape fastens around their neck, with a gold, velvet inlay and green stitching. All of it giving off an imaginary of power and richness that anyone in the land knew they had earnt.
Prince Gabriel and Castiel hold out their arms to Dean, who delicately holds onto both as they lead him up the many stairs to his suite.
The following hours pass in a blur of naps and worry, the endless amount of trees, passing by the carriage window. As the moon begins to shine, they finally arrive at the Shurley Kingdom. Tired, Dean climbs out of the carriage, the last thing he wants to do is to be sociable, but he has to be. For his Kingdom. He straightens his cloak and rolls his bare shoulders back before stepping forward to greet King Shurley, waiting for him. Dean bows low and takes the King’s hand, kissing his knuckles.
They both stood tall, hand on sword hilt, but as Dean stood, he realises he’s taller than them both, and his heart sinks, knowing no Alpha wanted an Omega taller than them.
Dean nods and smiles softly.
Cas moans and looks down at Dean, he grabs the Omega’s shoulders and pulls him up into a hard, passionate kiss.
He drops Castiel’s thumb and nuzzles into his neck, “you’re the first Alpha whose not just wanted me for sex.” He whispers.
He looks up at Castiel, before diverting his eyes back down to the ground.
“You know you don’t have to call me Prince Castiel. I actually prefer Cas. Especially if you call me it.” Cas says softly.
“Thank you kindly. Shall we get down to business?”
Dean frowns. “I’m sorry for what they did. I can start working on making Winchester a safe place for dragons, so the other Kingdoms can see you’re not a threat. In return-”
“You’re not like Cas.”
“And dad did want to integrate dragons more. But… I have duties at home.”
“Sorry about Gabe. He doesn’t mean to be rude, just enjoys teasing and laughing.” Castiel says softly, drawing Dean out of his thoughts.
“No one has ever taken my all.” Cas groans, as Dean’s tight hole squeezes around him. “How does it feel?”
Dean moans softly, showing Cas how he’s such a good Omega and what he’s missing out on.
“The boys will show you to your room, where you can unwind and change before the evening meal.” King Shurley turns on his heels and heads into the Palace, his long, black cloak swishing out behind him.
Dinner passes slowly, Dean having to speak politics with King Shurley. The food is delicious, but the only calming feature is the arm draped around the back of his chair the entire time. Just as they were finishing their main course, an aide stepped into the room, bowing to the King and spoke quietly to him. Dean watches silently, wondering what is happening. Finally, the King turns to him and speaks, in a tone that seems far too kind for the Alpha King.
“We haven’t been able to wake him for a while now. Forgive us, Prince Dean. But maybe, if you speak to him, he will hear you. He will wake for you.” The nurse offers softly.
“Dean, you don’t have to. I’ll always be here for you to sit on. I don’t want to lose such a good, deep hole.”
Dean blinks, trying to fight the sleep that was approaching, but it is too hard, and soon he is snoring into Cas’ neck.
Castiel rubs Dean’s back softly, “it’s alright. I can’t imagine what it feels like to just be seen as a glorified toy, going from Kingdom to Kingdom. But you’re not just a toy. You’re Dean. You’re beautiful and soft and I know you care for your Kingdom. Care for it, more than you care for yourself.”
until he remembered the previous day’s events.
Dean was about to close, his employee—Krissy—waiting at the till to leave. Dean just finished skyping with his brother, wishing the jerk a happy new year. He could tell Sam was disappointed in him for not returning home for another Christmas, just like he hadn’t for the past decade. Dean had gotten past the point of caring however, and just let his brother have his bitterness.
Dean grins, “Just a moment, dear!”
In fact, he kept thinking it over and over. At first he thought it was purely innocent until he finished another equation and he finally took note of his thoughts. It was then that it all came crashing down on him like a brick wall and he dropped his pencil in shock.
“Look, he wants to make you happy, just like how you want to make
“Yes… I had a memory… last night, while I was sleeping. It was only small. But I remember Impala now, and I briefly remember the prince. So I guess whatever Missouri did to me worked.”
“Don’t worry, I’m not bothered by you asking,” Cas says, “it’s not exactly private information, I’m sure your parents and Adam know the full story. It’s been a few years, I’ve had plenty of time to grieve.”
“The amulet that you are wearing --”
Dean frowns. “Charlie?”
“Why?”
Claire nodded slowly.
“Whether you told me then or now doesn’t change a thing,” he says, “for I wouldn’t love you any less. You are mine Castiel. For now and for always.”
He holds onto the amulet.
It was a split second decision that changed their fate almost as instantaneously.
Behind the sword is a large oak tree, with a sturdy trunk and big, leafy branches. Beneath the tree, an old man sits with his head rolled to the side as he soundly sleeps. Dean guesses who he is, considering the legend of the place. He isn’t exactly like Dean pictured him, with a grey beard and a balding head. He’s older than Dean pictured, but Dean figures that’s because he, himself, is the only knight he knows.
He fires the arrow.
“How about we just fight instead?”
“I suppose that is a more practical solution,” he turned to look at Dean, who was eyeing him curiously, “do you agree? Give the horses five minutes to rest and then proceed up to the fortress?”
was the solid, cold object he could feel. Cas looked down at where Dean’s hand was and he almost swore, the ghost had tears in his eyes.
“Nope, I don’t want to hear a word outta you. Shut up and eat your sandwich.”
“With pleasure, Your Highness.”
He signed.
It had been half an hour since the store closed and Dean was sweeping, not concentrating in the slightest on what he was doing. It was only when the store bell rang that he snapped out of his thoughts and let out a large sigh.
Deep down, Dean knows that Charlie is right. He rarely fights with Cas and they aren’t exactly fights. He remembers the screaming matches he’d get into with his exes, the way his blood pumped angrily through him and how he could practically see nothing but red. Plus, he couldn’t forget the many times he ended up on Charlie’s couch. Those fights were what ultimately ended all his past relationships and that gave him the trust issues that he still carries into his current one. He worries that one bad fight will lead to Cas packing his bags.
The words tumbled out of Castiel’s mouth in a blur, fast-paced words of regret, fear and sadness, laced into incomprehensible sentences. Dean continued to breath harshly, staring up at Castiel, the man beginning to lose the life that once shone brightly inside of him. As Castiel brushed a matted strand of hair away from Dean’s forehead, he felt himself look towards
“Anna, I am surprised to see you here.” Castiel said to her, as she walked over to them.
They had lunch in the dining hall of the village, surrounded by eager faeries who excitedly asked them questions. Most of the fae in the Aether were forbidden to leave the region until the age of twenty five. So, seeing two visitors from the outside world was exciting for them. Castiel was happy to answer their questions between bites of his broth, letting Dean silently eat a couple of bowls and not be included in the interrogation.
Reminding about his selection, Claire had a quick look—deciding that she was going to try the chocolate eclairs. As Claire sat down, Dean got her order ready quickly—walking over to her with the plate of eclairs and a bonus vanilla milkshake. Claire looked up at him in confusion.
meeting one, they are a fascinating sight. Their wings are all different colours and glitter even when there is no light. Dean almost wants to reach over and touch one of them, but Charlie warns him that doing that would just aggravate them.
“Cas,” Dean said with a laugh, “calm down, of course I want you here and
Dean’s arms around him felt like a blanket of safety. It was as if Dean’s very touch was magic, the fear and unease washing off Cas like water on stone. Everything about Dean reminded him of home, reminded him of the place he belonged. He felt himself relaxing, melting into Dean like soft butter.
At one point, they can’t help but watch as Michael and Adam return to the dance floor. Michael is suave with his moves, moving Adam around the dancefloor in a graceful but jovial manner. Adam is laughing, his face flushed and his eyes bright. In all honesty, Dean doesn’t think he’s ever seen his little brother this happy.
The outside air was still warm, despite it being close to midnight. The two boys stumbled down to the pool, sitting beside it and dipping their feet in. Dean opened the container and the two of them noiselessly ate them, satisfied, their stomachs no longer—mostly—empty.
“Don’t mind them,” she said, “it is customary when Dean returns home that he goes and trains with his father. John likes to make sure his skills are still intact, such as his strength and stamina.”
It was then Castiel’s turn to smile.
Claire signed.
When the GPS told her that Dean’s house was on her right, she came to an immediate stop. The house in question didn’t have a white picket fence, nor a porch. Instead it was a just a small two story home, with a small well-kept garden and a bright white front door. Claire could just imagine a young Dean playing out in that front garden and it was nice to put a setting to most of the stories.
It’s just… it’s
Dean scowled, causing the both of them to burst into laughter, Jess also joining in.
He turned to Dean.
Cas laughs. “I’m sure she won’t mind.”
Ah, yes, of course. The dreaded question.
Dean whistled low. “Wow dude… that’s impressive.”
“Follow me.” He said, beginning to walk away. He turned back to see Claire pop the last of her cookie in her mouth before grabbing her bag. Dean heard the thumping of her combat boots as she followed behind him. As soon as they entered the kitchen, Dean was chucking a spare apron and hat at the confused teenager.
Dean has no idea who this man is, so he just gives a slight incline of his head. However, it seems that the man recognises him.
“If I were to go on an adventure, one that involved leaving this place for a while. Would you come with me?” He asks, turning his head slightly to try and gauge Dean’s reaction.
“Dean is very nice,” he told the knight.
he can’t help think,
The week before his twenty-first birthday, Castiel travelled with Dean to Mount Lebanon.
“What?” He asked Cas.
Cas huffed, a scowl on his face.
he is about to face, is not going to be kind. He knows, deep down he
And with that, Dean flashed him a smile and kept on walking.
Cas gasps out, his voice sounding as frail as Dean currently feels.
When he got up, he noticed that his friend was not in his bed. Instead, he had pulled his desk chair over to the one window of their dorm and was staring out of it. His sketchbook sat on his lap, something that Dean rarely saw Cas without. Cas hadn’t noticed that Dean was awake yet, or at least up in his bed, too distracted by something else. Dean took that opportunity to stare at the sight before him, at the way the moonlight gleamed against Cas’ dark hair or the way it accented the blue in his eyes and the shape of his nose and lips. Cas was handsome, there was no doubt—but to Dean, he was
