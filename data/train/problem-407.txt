in her arms. Molly gave him several more nods, seemingly unable to move any other part of her body. She grew all the more tense when the dark haired man took a step towards her. John swivelled round upon hearing her take a short sharp breath, noting the lack of space between her and Sherlock. He frowned, attempting to second guess the other man’s intentions. After all, it was just the three of them alone in the wash rooms, and Sherlock was naked and looming over Molly. John grit his teeth and clenched at the newly found razor in his palm, unknowingly causing his hand to bleed. He was about to intervene when the taller man spoke, “May I have them then?”

It was Mycroft's turn to take in a breath, clenching his teeth in frustration. Before anyone had time to comment, Sherlock turned his attention to the only servant in the room, "John, be a dear and pour me another cup?"
Sherlock paused before finally responding, “Even if I knew where to find your sister?”

Sherlock cut him off. “Irene is one of the best, if not the best. Just be grateful that she is allowing you to attend tonight as a
The ride home was an awkward one. Sherlock had repeatedly insisted on inspecting John’s wound despite his constant protests. Eventually he gave up on trying to bat the other man away and resigned to allowing himself to be prodded. Worrying his bottom lip in annoyance, John looked away into the passing crowd before he felt a sharp pain to which he snapped his head back round. “Ow! What the hell are yo-“

John almost flinched from the sudden attention; this whole time feeling like more of a fly on the wall. He managed a nod as he picked up the pot of tea and began to pour. As he did so, Lestrade let out an angry shout, “Bloody bastard!”
"And?" Mycroft raised an eyebrow at him expectedly as he spoke.
“Yes, he’s been rather good. I was expecting less of you, brother, but it would appear I am mistaken. Your servants are rather impressive indeed.” He flashed a smile at John, eliciting an awkward squirm from him in response.

He clenched his teeth when the dark haired man leant his face closer to John’s muscular chest, humming his approval. They stayed like that for a little too long, Sherlock rubbing his chin as if deep in thought. The smaller man realised that the other man’s head was now level with his and considered head butting him out of his reverie when Sherlock suddenly snapped up.

“It was clear to your female counterpart just now that she’s aware of how much you loathe this place, more it’s people above all else. You struggle being made to be around so many of them all the time because you’re used to being alone, more likely abandoned. Despite your general dislike and probable distrust of others, you fear being left with no one around you. Why? Because you weren’t always alone, not until that fateful day where something precious was taken from you. No…”, he stopped to take a breath, his eyes widening in excitement, “No, it was someone, wasn’t it? Oh it’s always more interesting when it’s someone!” He continued his ramble, “But who was that someone. A lover perhaps? Or maybe a family member, possibly a brother. You two were close, inseparable even, apart from when you were forcibly separated, of course.” Sherlock placed the palms of his hands together to delicately rest his chin on top of his fingers. “And now you’re here. You were sold to this House when you were young, barely in your teens. You’ve had years to plan an escape and been given every opportunity to do so, and yet there you stand. Why stay? Because you think you have more chances of finding your brother in the heart of the city in lieu of randomly searching for him on your own, wherever he may be.” Then he squinted, “There’s anger there too. You want revenge, don’t you? Find your brother, find the person who took him, punish the culprit.” Sherlock relaxed into the warm water, “And that’s why you haven’t left yet.”

“Uh yes um sorry.” He delicately took the cup from his teacher’s hands, their fingers brushing slightly. John bowed his head a little and took a sip.

“Sh-Sherlock,” John sounded weak and feeble, “I-I don’t think I can do this.” Then his fears resurfaced and began to bubble away yet again. This time he did turn to face his teacher, but struggled to meet his eyes. He kept his gaze focused on the ground.
“Yes, Si-,” Sherlock shot him a glare. “Ah, I mean, yes, Mr Holmes.” The words felt odd in John’s mouth. He squirmed under the other man’s gaze.

The words cut through John like a razor blade. Balling his fists in both shock and fury, he let out a long breath of air through his nostrils. He knew Sherlock was right, but the anger brewing within him refused to subside. He felt a burning need to land a blow on the smug face of the taller man in front of him. He resigned to digging his fingernails into the palms of his hands instead. Sherlock observed the blonde’s reaction before speaking again.

John tried to protest, but his words came out as an incoherent garble. He feebly attempted to twist out of Sherlock’s grasp, but was firmly held in place under his unforgiving hold. Still the blonde wriggled and writhed against the other man’s body, letting out a gasp as he felt his
“I’ll make the tea tonight.”
The detective's expression dropped a little, but the look was gone the moment it had appeared. This only served to confuse John further, but he brushed the feeling aside. Sherlock almost snapped his response.
Sherlock chuckled. “Irene,” he spoke softly, gently taking one of her hands in his own. “I owe you so much for helping my apprentice here perfect their skills and training. The least I can do is give you this.”

The mixture of scents, the warmth that enveloped his being and his fuzzy head did strange things to his body, not to mention the sweet smile that was spreading across the other man’s full lips alongside a twinkle in his eyes. John thought for a moment he saw something predatory in them, but shook the unnerving feeling off in favour of asking for something to quench his thirst. A cup of tea was immediately shoved right beneath his nose, the smell of ginger near burning his nostrils. The blonde was about to accept it when he hesitated. He tried to still the shake in his hands as he cast a nervous glance to his teacher who was bent forwards on his hands and knees, a little too close for comfort. John swallowed the dry lump that was uncomfortably lodged in his throat. “H-how do I know it’s not drugged?” He tried to keep his tone light, inwardly cursing himself for the nervous stammer. A stab of icy horror pierced his gut when he watched Sherlock’s previously jovial expression morph into something devious and calculating.
, his head was screaming at him, but John's cock had become undoubtedly hard. He'd wanted this for so long. Each day had been utter torture for him, longing for the attention of his flatmate, convincing himself over and over that it was never meant to be. Hundreds, if not thousands of indecent thoughts permeated his mind, day in day out. There were so many things he wanted to do to the man whose body was pressed up against his, but now that it was finally happening, he could only manage a whimper.
John gulped at that. Sherlock continued.

Having failed to get her attention, he grabbed onto her sleeve. “Where is he?” He inquired with urgency, but the
Molly blinked rapidly, faltering for a brief moment. She then shakily handed the garments to the now irritated-looking man.

He was about to look away when the dark haired man spoke again, “Do get up”. John slowly rose to his feet, awkwardly shuffling on the spot, unsure of where to look.

from the wide eyed men in the room. John however didn’t notice – his own eyes were glazed over as broken memories of his sister shot through his mind, accompanied by shouts and screams of fear and protest. Despite this, his body continued to dance, flowing through the well-practised moves from muscle memory alone. All of John’s senses appeared to be dead as his mind succumbed to its onslaught of pain and terror from his many reimagining’s of his sister's kidnapping. The only thing that seemed to keep him grounded was the sweet melancholic tunes of Sherlock’s

Whilst he was busy gazing into her eyes with as much sincerity as he could muster, John was kneeling beside the two of them, squirming uncomfortably from their intimacy.
He snapped his eyes wide open, remembering his dream from a few hours before. He reached his hands upwards, fisting them into his short blonde hair. He’d been experiencing these nightmares ever since he was a boy, but he could never truly recall what had happened to him and his sister. It was just nightmare after nightmare of the same thing: forever wanting to save her, but always losing her in the end. John clenched his teeth and screwed his eyes shut. Gripping his hair tighter and letting out a small shudder, he silently sobbed on the roof of the House. If only he knew what had happened to Harry…

"Regardless, I am infiltrating a gay club in Soho tonight. Lestrade says my target should be there also. I doubt I'll have any difficulty in persuading him into giving me the information I require". He straightened out his sleeves as he spoke.
The dark haired man teased his cock and entrance for what felt like hours and John savoured every second of it, not wanting to climax and thus break the spell. As his mind began to drift and ponder how long he could keep this up for, Sherlock's head suddenly jolted downwards to the base of his dick, hitting the back of his throat. The blonde's shout of surprise soon turned into a groan as his flatmate began to bob his head up and down, taking every inch of his member into his mouth. He could feel Sherlock's finger press deeper and deeper into him with each stroke of his cock. The unusual feeling of being penetrated made John want to squirm, but he felt physically and mentally drained, allowing himself to be probed by his flatmate.
“And who’s this pretty little blossom?” She stalked over to the blonde who was unsure of where to look. He felt as if he was prey being sized up by his predator.

before crossing the space between them, forcing John back into the counter again. It pressed uncomfortably against the small of his back as the dark haired man trapped him there with his hands on either side of him. He spoke again, only this time his lips were pressed against John's ear, "Or perhaps I should tear them off you instead". And with that, he took the back his head in one of his hands, gently tugging at his blonde hair so as to expose his neck. Before John had enough time to react, Sherlock placed his tongue at the space just above his collarbone and licked upwards to the edge of his jawline.

“P-please?” He winced.
“Wait! Could I um ah…”, John blushed, “Could I…hold onto you? Please? Just until I find my balance…”
Clearly his thoughts had distracted him as the other man was now marching over.
and then Sherlock’s hands were fisted in his hair, yanking him forwards. He opened his mouth in a lame attempt to try to take the dark haired man in, but the suddenness of the movement caused his cock to deflect off of the side of John's parted lips, spreading pre-cum across his cheek. John whimpered as Sherlock growled, pulling his face away from his crotch. Realigning him by the strands of blonde hair on his head, he pulled him forward again, only it was much slower this time, if not painfully slower.
John woke from his nightmare with a jolt, his forehead damp with sweat. Blinking several times, he slowly began to register the dull ache throbbing away in his head. Groaning ruefully, he rolled over onto his stomach to press his face into the plump pillow underneath him. Forgetting whose bed he was in, he took in a generous gulp of air as he buried his nose into the soft material, unintentionally breathing in the now overpowering smell of Sherlock. The scent a shiver down his spine and a twitch to his dick. John frowned into the pillow, pulling up his hands to grasp at it in a death grip. He had begun to chew at his bottom lip in confused contemplation at his body’s reaction when he heard a faint, but distinct whispering coming from the porch. Then the smell of tobacco hit him.
Sherlock only just ducked away from the second punch when the smaller man's roared, "Where is she?!" He continued to aim his dazed fury at other man, who in turn dodged every hit aimed at him, occasionally deflecting the onslaught of fists, elbows and knees that came his way.

. Although his initial grogginess would cloud his mind, his lips would slowly curve upwards into a soft smile. He enjoyed his routine of rolling out of his bed to brew them a pot to enjoy on the porch together. He reckoned the other man rather appreciated their peaceful companionship also.
The look on John's face is priceless. He's stood frozen in the doorway of the living room, wearing one of his typical ugly jumpers and clutching onto two freshly made cups of tea.

And before John had time enough to process his thoughts, he had thrown a punch aimed for Sherlock’s face. However, to his dismay, the dark haired man caught his fist in his hand, using the other to twist John’s arm behind his back, forcing him to the floor with a yelp. The smaller man winced when he felt the other man’s face press beside that of his own. “Another time then.” He said softly into John’s ear. He then let go of the blonde who was now crumpled in a heap on the floor. Sherlock stood, straightened his
John gasped as he threw his eyes open, his body trembling in his own sweat. He just about registered the cold flannel on his forehead. Sherlock was knelt beside him, a sympathetic smile on his face. His voice was hushed as he spoke. "Sorry if I woke you. I thought perhaps the flannel might help to counter the side effects of the drug I gave yo-" and then John punched him square in the jaw.
Having heard the front door slam shut moments before, followed by hurried footsteps up the staircase and the click of Sherlock's bedroom door close, John took it upon himself to make them both a cuppa each.

A thick silence enveloped the room as the blonde struggled to recall his surroundings.

Both John and Molly jumped and spun around. There stood in the doorway beside them was Mother’s assistant, Lestrade. He was wearing his finest emerald green

. He shooed away the thought as soon as it had entered his mind, before stealing another glance at Sherlock. The embarrassment that coursed through his veins was so overwhelming; he had to forcibly will himself into moving from the doorway of the living room. Placing the two cups of tea down on the coffee table in front of the sofa, he almost collapsed into it as he sat down, letting out a loud sigh. It was then that the detective swivelled round, as if to reveal his new outfit.

entrance to the yard slid open. Everyone present fell deadly silent as Anthea stepped forwards, their guest following closely behind. All eyes fell on the mysterious figure as she moved aside for him to enter. Several servants blinked incredulously, some raising their eyebrows in surprise, others frowning in confusion. Their guest had the look of a vagabond; his
The moment however did not last long. "On your knees." The command felt misplaced and John crooked his head upwards, as if to check whether he had heard him right. Sherlock furrowed his brow at the look, "Do I have to ask you again?"
That morning was the busiest the House had ever been. Every one of Mother’s servants was running around manically, dusting and scrubbing and tidying. The entire House was under strict orders to have the place in top condition for the impending visit from their guest. John had been sweeping for the past four hours without so much as a minute to stop and breath. His hands ached, the wood of the broom creating blisters on his fingers. Stealing a quick glance around him, he briefly stopped so as to quickly flex his hands. Just as he did so, he felt something hard hit the back of his head. He let out a small yelp, spinning round to throw a glare at whoever had just assaulted him with a scrubbing brush. Molly was knelt on the floor a couple of metres away from him, next to a bucket of soapy water. She’d been scrubbing the floors for as long as he’d been sweeping, but stopped to scold him. With her hands on her hips, she pouted, “Mother will catch you standing around like that, if you’re not careful. You’ll be beaten senseless!”
Sherlock hesitated before responding. "Yes", he finally confirmed.
Sholto let out a tired sigh, rubbing the side of his face in exasperation. John giggled at this, causing the taller man to blush yet again. “I better go…”, he mumbled, reluctance dripping from every inch of him. “But I’ll see you soon?”
, with feet dancing hurriedly, but effortlessly, in an attempt to outwit the other. However, both managed to keep up with the other, failing to land a single blow on their opponent. Then they came to a grinding halt as their swords connected perpendicular between them both, their faces coming forwards so their noses almost touched. Sherlock's smug look remained with John's frustration still burning. "Self-taught?"

"I need to blend in", he offered calmly, turning his face towards the mirror at the opposite end of the room to readjust the lapels of his black leather biker jacket. With his body half turned away from where John was still gawping, his eyes inadvertently flicked downwards to take in the way those leather trousers rather nicely framed Sherlock's behind.

As soon as Irene had delicately slid her hand off of the blonde’s shoulder, Sherlock had placed a firm grip on the opposite. “Well we best be heading back then. My apprentice has a rather busy schedule ahead of them tomorrow.” He gave the man in question a quick squeeze, but John didn’t know what it meant. Before he could follow that thought any further, the dark haired man had removed his hand to turn to bow to Irene. “Thank you so much for having us.”
“Everyone, outside, now!” Lestrade was running around the House, ushering everyone outside into the front yard. They all quickly aligned themselves into two lines on either side of the path, ready for inspection. Just as the last servant ran out of the House and joined the end of a line, eliciting a quick smack round the back of the head from Lestrade, the
Realisation suddenly dawned on John:
“Christ”, he puffed, rolling a shoulder back with a click. Unbeknown to him, his opponent had been staring at him the whole time. An unreadable expression sat on his face, his eyes burning with more intensity than usual. When the blonde glanced back down to face the taller man, Sherlock quickly turned to head back inside.

John let out a sigh of relief before grabbing what he needed to prepare the bath.
Their shared gaze was only broken when Sherlock closed the door behind him as he stepped into the room. John took this as an opportunity to look at himself in the mirror. Despite the pull he felt towards his teacher, he felt equally as determined not to let it show.
John blinked several times before placing his head in his hands, letting out the air he didn't know he'd been holding in. "Fuck", he whispered. The two cups of tea were now lukewarm. John strode towards the cabinet at the other end of the room and pulled out a bottle of whiskey.

John hastened to shush her, nodding his head to the room he had just left. Molly’s eyes widened as she slammed her lips firmly shut. Without a word, John pointed at the room next door, to which Molly nodded in response as they both crept over to quietly slide in, out of sight. As soon as he had closed the

He just about managed to stifle a squeak, but his voice was shaky. "Sherlock, what-", he was cut off by the body behind him pressing him forwards into the kitchen counter, causing the shorter man to throw his arms forward so as to prevent his face from connecting with the cupboard in front. One of the leather hands was removed from his side to push at the middle of his shoulders, leaving him pressed up against and bent over the counter. He was about to protest when he felt the press of a bulge against his arse cheeks. A loud gasp was forced from him as his face flushed a rosy shade of pink.

Stuck to the screen was a bright yellow post-it note with his flatmate's handwriting scrawled across it. John cursed under his breath at Sherlock's blatant disregard for his property. Plucking the post-it off the screen, he wished the detective would stop using his things, but his thoughts froze as he began to read the note Sherlock had left him:

He hadn't even noticed the other man appear from his room whilst John was making the tea. He'd nipped out into the hallway with the intention of gently knocking on Sherlock’s bedroom door, hoping to offer a mug as a means of placating his flatmate. Having noticed through the crack of the open door that he was no longer in his room, John made his way to the living room, where he was now struggling to find any air to fill his lungs.
He pondered. She was right in pointing out how little he knew of
“Perhaps,” Sherlock purred, “the drugs are in your system already.” His teacher’s icy blue eyes darted to the wound on the blonde’s arm, which John followed, blinking at the bandages in confusion. Furrowing his brow, he nervously darted out his tongue to wet his lips. A hot prickling sensation slowly began to creep up his spine – he could sense he was missing something very important, but was unable to pinpoint the reason for the growing dread that had begun to seep into his bones. Flicking his gaze back to Sherlock, he forcibly had to prevent himself from flinching at the sight: the man in question was now a mere inch away from his face and staring with such intensity, John felt as if his skin would burn from the scrutiny. That was when the apprentice realised that the look in his eyes wasn’t one of curiosity, but something else he was struggling to decipher. Suddenly, realisation came crashing down upon him:
“Sherlock will do nicely”, he turned away to head for the bath. “The razor, if you will.”

Mycroft threw Sherlock one of his typical insincere smiles as his brother softly made his way over to sit opposite.

Sherlock looked drastically different to before: his face was clean and fresh looking from his shave, his angular features now much easier to see and thus admire. He was wearing the purple
John was vaguely aware a few moments later that Irene had now joined him on stage in an attempt to both thank and settle the awe struck crowd. But for the blonde, everything blended together into a sensory overload of a blur. One thing he was acutely aware of however was when his teacher rose abruptly from his chair, eyes fixed on something in the audience. He wanted to call out his name or at the very least, follow his line of sight into the crowd. Who was he looking at? What had he seen? But the blonde was already being dragged off stage by the same group of beautifully dressed

Sherlock's mouth felt dry to that of John's, but this only served to excite the blonde more. Feeling brave, he arched his body into Sherlock whilst cautiously reaching up to feed his shaking fingers through his hair. It felt thick with dried sweat, probably from his expedition at the club a few hours before. The shorter man tugged his head a little further forward in an attempt to deepen their kiss. This was welcomed enthusiastically, with Sherlock's tongue now forcing its way into his mouth, exploring fervently. A loud yet muffled moan escaped from John and before he knew it, Sherlock had roughly grabbed him by the waist, lifting him up and sitting him on the kitchen counter. Yanking down his soaked underwear, he tossed it behind him, causing them to create a noisy splat when they hit the floor. Under other circumstances, John would've laughed. This however was a very different set of circumstances indeed. He blushed hard and averted his eyes. The dark haired man flashed him a toothy grin, "Blushing suits you. I should make you wet yourself more often".

However, thanks to the blonde’s training, his body responded before his brain did and he ducked to avoid receiving a blow to the head. Pushing himself upwards from his crouched position, he shot forwards with the goal of landing a fist into the thief’s stomach. It would seem however that his opponent was an equal match, as they blocked and deflected the jab, shoving John to the side. The figure cut through the crowd once more to disappear down an empty side street. The blonde huffed in frustration and quickly followed suit.

Neither one of the brothers broke eye contact with the other, ignoring the freshly poured tea in favour of sitting for a moment longer in complete silence. John wanted to squirm from the awkward intensity. Even Anthea had stopped writing. Mycroft finally spoke again.

Those eyes were alight with pure unabashed lust.
“To visit an old friend of mine.” Sherlock called back in response without so much as turning to reply or stopping to address John properly. The smaller of the two sighed in exasperation as he did he level best not to fall over in the middle of the street.

It suddenly dawned on him that he had originally come downstairs to use the bathroom and that his bladder was now feeling uncomfortably full. "Don't-", John managed, before the hand was shoved into his boxers, grabbing onto John's limp member. As if snapped out of a trance, he suddenly thrashed out of Sherlock's grip, twisting away and throwing back an elbow. The dark haired man dodged the blow intended to connect with his sternum, but he wasn't fast enough to avoid it from hitting him in the side of the ribs. However he did not falter nor hesitate to land a punch into John's stomach, growling as he did so and consequently winding him in the process. John's eyes widened as he clutched at his gut, more from shock than pain. He didn't notice Sherlock take a couple of slow steps back.

John pondered for a moment, as if gathering all the information that had just been hurled at him. "So what happens when I've got him distracted?"
John held himself for another moment longer before allowing himself to collapse. The cool stone floor against his skin made for a useful distraction from the awful stinging the bamboo had caused. He gasped the air back into his lungs before forcing himself to breathe more calmly through his nose. Shakily pushing himself off of the ground, he grunted as he stood, taking a couple of steps towards the stick he was mercilessly struck with moments before. Bending down to pick it up, he hissed as his back ached at the movement. Grabbing the stick off the harsh cold floor, he hobbled away to the wash rooms to clean the blood off the bamboo.
That last thought was enough to shake John out of his reverie. He was suddenly painfully aware that his face was sporting a warm shade of crimson and that his trousers were feeling a lot tighter than usual.

“First time?” John gave Sherlock a quick sharp nod in response, squeezing his eyes shut. Sherlock hummed thoughtfully to himself as he continued to carefully press into the smaller man. John drew in a breath, terror and arousal coursing through him all the same. It took him by complete surprise when he felt a sudden wetness envelope the head of his cock. He cracked one of his eyes open and was met with the image of his flatmate having taken his cock into his mouth. At first, he was merely teased by his tongue lapping at his tender head, but it was enough to send a warm fuzzy light-headed feeling throughout his entire being. A low long moan was produced from deep within him as Sherlock gently sucked on his tip whilst simultaneously pushing his finger deeper inside. He wanted to writhe under his touch, but due to the position his body had been made to endure, he held himself as still as possible. All he could do was blush, whine and leak into Sherlock's mouth.
John tensed, bracing himself for whatever might happen next. A thick bead of sweat rolled off of his forehead and down the side of his temple. He just about managed to grit his teeth and keep his eyes firmly shut. He waited. And waited. And waited. And...

Sherlock had insisted that he move from the servant’s quarters to be next door to the dark haired man, not that John had any say in the matter. Nevertheless, John couldn’t say he missed being holed up in the small dark space he had grown accustomed to for so long. His new room was large, bright and airy, with various potted plants dotted about alongside beautiful paintings hanging from the walls. He even had furniture and a futon bed. The only thing he disliked was the uncomfortable pillow, but it was yet another item on the list of things Sherlock said he would get used to.

Taking a couple of slow deep breaths, he reminded himself of his surroundings in an attempt to remain calm. He nearly jumped when he heard the sound of the bedroom door slide open, wincing at the flickering light that now flooded the room. John blinked again and let out a small sigh upon recognising the figure holding the lamp: it was Molly.
John couldn’t stop himself from shooting a threatening look at Sherlock when he entered the room, but realised the other man had placed a damp white flannel over his eyes. He had helped himself back into the bath, his arms draped over either side of the wooden structure with his body slumped back in relaxation. For a moment, John felt almost invisible so he nearly jumped when the dark haired man addressed him without moving, “By the mirror, please.”

John and Molly caught each other’s eyes as they sneaked a quick glance at one another. Neither of them said a word for a short moment, causing Lestrade to sigh loudly in annoyance, “Well I guess you’re both to be punished then, eh?” He started to turn away when John stood forward.

John frowned in confusion, his eyes darting to every corner of the street. He took a few steps forward to peek around the corners of the buildings that split the path in two, but still the men were nowhere to be seen.
The thick silence descended upon the room once more. John shuffled his feet in response. He decided to break the silence this time.

A hint of doubt began to seep its way into John’s mind.
Something was wrong. John didn’t feel quite right. The room began to spin slightly and his vision was a little blurred. He frowned at the now empty cup, throwing the same look at Sherlock, but the minor movement of turning his head nearly sent him tumbling backwards. His teacher was there to catch him before he crumpled into a messy heap on the floor. “It’s okay, I’ve got you.” He spoke softly into John’s ear.

John realised the other man's eyes were now focused on the riding crop that had been left abandoned on top of the desk. He blushed as his confusion grew. He was about to question Lestrade further when Sherlock poked his head back into the room. "Ready when you are, George."

John nodded. He gulped at the same time.
“Oh John…”
His head was throbbing when he awoke and everything was still fuzzy. There was whispering outside the room in the garden. Two people were hurriedly exchanging urgent words. The smell of tobacco reached his nostrils.
John’s breathing stilled as he strained his hearing, listening out for any other sound to confirm his suspicion that he was not alone. The thick silence and blinding darkness of the night enveloped his senses as he bit his bottom lip in concentration. For the briefest of moments, he began to think he was imagining things until he caught the unmistakable whisper of a sword being drawn from its
John frowned, "How about you go fuck yourself instead?"
"Wider", Sherlock murmured. John followed orders obediently as the other man languidly inserted his cock into his mouth, taking pleasure in the way the shorter man's damp tongue ran along the underside of his shaft. He didn't hesitate to push further still, his tip touching the back of John's throat, causing him to choke. "Relax", purred Sherlock, pushing the back of John's head into him so his lips were at the base of his dick. John was about to wriggle away when his hands met the leather of his flatmate's trousers. Suddenly the need to breathe was of far less importance as he revelled in the softness of the lambs skin under his fingertips. It was then that the smell of leather hit John's nostrils, alongside that of Sherlock's scent and the combination of the two drove him wild. Wanting to take more of the detective in, his hands reached his backside and pushed into him. Sherlock hissed and regretfully began to withdraw himself. The doctor gasped and then coughed as the entrance to his windpipe was unblocked, thin trails of saliva mixed with pre-cum dripping from his mouth. As he began to inhale, the detective pushed his head forward again to repeat the same action as before. John moaned gratefully around his flatmate's cock as it made its way into him. He gripped onto Sherlock's leather-clad arse cheeks in anticipation as the taller man thrust into his mouth four or five more times before ejaculating down his throat. John winced as Sherlock came, his pained expression growing as the detective pulled him by his hair, angling his head so as to make eye contact with one another again. "Swallow", he panted, hunched over John. But he had already begun to do so, his eyelids fluttering nervously. Sherlock let out a long sigh and relaxed his grip, slowly moving away from the smaller man who now felt somewhat abandoned by the sudden distance between them. Quirking an eyebrow, he pointed downwards, "Now kiss my boots."

He considered bringing the other man some tea, but hastily changed his mind in favour of curling up to go back to sleep. He told himself that those final moments of last night never happened.
The blonde was starting to grow weary of the drone of Sherlock’s voice. They had been practising his routine for hours, his wrists growing sore from the constant twists of his
Molly had brought him earlier, which served to bring out the light blue colour of his piercing eyes. The only dishevelled characteristic that remained was his loose dark curls. He looked almost regal.
“Oof!” There was a loud crash as John’s ramen bowl was knocked from the table, hitting the floor and smashing into tiny pieces. The hooded figure had collided with full force into the two of them, nearly knocking them both off their stools.
His mind raced as he ran.

The thin light material of John's navy coloured boxers made for a stark contrast to the thick leather that enveloped Sherlock's crotch. It took a few seconds for the doctor to realise how exposed and vulnerable he felt, but he dare not move. Frozen like a rabbit caught in the headlights of an oncoming car, he remained perfectly still. All that could be heard was his shallow breathing. His breath hitched when he felt a leather hand begin to snake its way towards the front of his boxers.
Sherlock let out a loud

John’s heart was pounding in his chest as he stared into the crowd, but all he could see were the contorted shadows of the many attendees to his debut. The blonde subconsciously fiddled with his sleeve in nervous anticipation – if only the lights weren’t so bright on the stage then maybe he could actually see properly.
"What is it?"

"And the time before that", John croaked. He was grateful for Molly's sympathy, but uncomfortable with the attention. He'd learnt to keep his head down to stay out of trouble, preferring to avoid people than seek them out. He shifted awkwardly, glancing up at the door. "Do you reckon anyone else heard?"
Just then, a brief flicker of light danced across the wall. When it disappeared, it was accompanied by a soft exhale. John supposed that the other man was back on the porch again smoking his

propped up against a nearby wall. It would have to do. Heading for the only weapon he could find, he slid up to them, grabbing them so as to swivel and jab his opponent in the gut. They gasped and coughed loudly as they stumbled back, clutching at their chest. John couldn’t help the fleeting feeling of victory bounce around inside him for having successfully winded his attacker. But his fear was almost immediately renewed upon hearing what sounded like a growl emanate from the figure in front of him. And then they were locked in battle once more with the blonde still having to duck away from the onslaught of swipes and strikes; he knew their blade was sharp enough to cut through the bamboo of his
“Well, my dear Watson, your back must be quite tender by now, no?”
"You thought it was suspicious that I know so much." Sherlock finished for him. "You're looking for someone to blame for your sister's disappearance and it would be convenient if the person responsible were me."

The blonde desperately wanted to catch his eye before his performance was about to begin, but his teacher was seemingly focused on producing the introductory melody to John’s dance. The performer in question clenched his fists, took in a deep breath and closed his eyes. Willing away the flush spreading across his cheeks and the sweat on his brow, an almost inaudible whisper cut its way through the growing anxiety in his head:
The smaller man let out a small splutter of a noise at the question. He felt like his raised eyebrows were almost touching the ceiling. He must have looked pale because an expression of concern suddenly appeared on Sherlock's face.
He shuddered.

Sherlock couldn’t prevent the chortle that escaped from his lips, his eyes crinkling in amusement as he broke their staring match to run a hot wet hand through his damp curls. The smaller of the two however remained perfectly still, his own eyes unmoving. Of course he knew that Sherlock was aware of his attempt to play dumb, but he refused to give the other man’s curiosity the satisfaction. Before John could begin to enjoy his brief moment of victory, Sherlock retorted:

“J-just go”, she stammered, placing a hand over her face. Humiliation flooded her very being and it showed, clear as day. She was very easily intimidated, unlike John. He gave her another concerned look before glancing down at the clean razor in his hand. He desperately wanted to comfort his friend, but was wary of the consequences of prioritising other servants over their superiors. Still, he faltered.
The dark haired man fondly traced one of his thumbs over the blonde’s cheek in a sweet caress. That pull John was experiencing was growing stronger and stronger; he wanted to be as close to the other man as physically possible, but he remained put. Both of them appeared to be lost in each other, enjoying a new level of intimacy they had never explored together before. The smaller of the two nervously darted out his tongue to wet his lips whilst subconsciously flicking his eyes downwards to admire the beautifully angular curves of Sherlock’s mouth. When he realigned with gaze with the other man’s eyes, he just about caught him glancing down at John’s own mouth also. An unspoken realisation was close to descending upon the room when the door was thrown open with a loud bang causing them both to jump away from each other. Whatever spell they were under had been abruptly broken.

The other man paused before responding, taking time to examine the smaller man's face. Finally he gave his response. "Human trafficker. Well connected. Very dangerous." He began to close the gap between them. "He ventures to the city every now and then for business." He stopped immediately in front of John, peering down at him from his nose. "And for pleasure also."

This time, John woke with a start. He gasped as he shot upwards from the bed, a couple of beads of sweat appearing on his brow. Registering a dull ache in his arm, he glanced down to notice that his wound had been neatly wrapped in a bandage. Then the smell of ginger hit his nostrils.
“Hm?” The man in question turned his head to glance at John from over his shoulder.
The proposition was met with a thick silence. The blonde was now grateful that the dark served to hide his blush of embarrassment. He was about to retract his suggestion and bid the other man good night when he responded. “Yes alright.”
Sherlock turned his attention to John, “So, that razor then?”

John's grimace then turned upwards into a smirk as he shot out a leg from where he was crouched, spinning it out in front of him in the hopes of catching the dark haired man off guard. To his dismay, Sherlock had seen the movement before John had enough time to fully execute the move, jumping backwards out of his reach.

The blonde just about dodged the swing of the blade, nearly cutting off the tip of his nose. Snapping himself out of his reverie, his strengthened his resolve. Darting forwards, he jabbed his opponent in their upper thighs, hitting their pressure points dead on, causing them to collapse backwards from the momentary loss of sensation in their legs. John took the opportunity to violently stamp on their knee, crushing the vulnerable knee cap as a result. Their attacker let out a loud pained howl as he felt the fragile bones underneath his foot snap with an audible crack. He was about to strike a deadly hit in their throat with the intention of at least fracturing their spine when he heard shouting in the distance. Suddenly, several of the surrounding

Screwing his eyes shut, he balled his fists as the many women around him continued to swirl in a fast-paced flurry, their onslaught of never-ending poking and prodding raging on. John could feel something deep within him bubbling inside, growing more and more out of control. Any moment now he was about to burst when suddenly a sharp twang of a

It’s more than that and you know it.” And with that he turned, “Come now, let’s get you freshened up and presentable for a change. I fear you might stink out the entire city!” Mother Mycroft began to saunter back the way he came, with his brother Sherlock following behind. Anthea was quick to follow, with Molly and the other servant behind her, struggling to carry Sherlock’s many belongings. Molly took the opportunity to steal a look at all the servants’ faces, scanning for John’s own, but he was nowhere to be seen. When they all reached the door at the opposite end of the entrance to the courtyard, Mycroft caught Anthea’s eyes and gave her a small nod. She turned and ushered Molly and the second servant away, opened the

John was falling again, only this time there was no sound. He felt as though his body was stuck in an unnervingly silent freefall, descending deeper and deeper into a dark abyss. And he felt hot. Too hot. He watched in horror as his robes began to burn away into tiny embers above him until there was nothing left. His skin was next and he thought he could feel a lick of flame curl at the small of his back. He tried to shout, but no sound passed his lips. Then his naked tormented body abruptly made contact with the ground or what he assumed was the bottom of the dark pit. But as he tried to lift his weary bones, something held him down. That was when he realised he had landed on a sea of hands, all hungrily attempting to grab onto his limbs. John tried to yank himself away, but it was no use. He was being held down in a vast array of harsh grips. Then the hands began to explore, stroking him all over, from light caresses through his sweat slick hair to more intimate parts of him. He felt himself being probed and fondled, causing his cock to begin to swell and engorge, resulting in a small groan to slip from his lips. His eyes flew open upon hearing a familiar voice.
He barely had enough time to process what the other man meant by that comment, when he removed his now saliva covered fingers from John’s face, pressing against the blonde's entrance. His body instinctively flinched away. “Lube...!”, he gasped as one of Sherlock’s fingers traced the outside of his hole. He threw a pleading look at the detective and was met with an expression of indecision, as if Sherlock wanted to make yet another smug comment, but also wanted to cradle John softly in his arms. He removed his hand from his entrance to briefly fumble in the back pocket of his leather trousers. He soon produced a small unmarked bottle of clear liquid, popping it open with his nimble fingers and expertly emptying a sizeable globule into the palm of his hand. John would’ve remarked on Sherlock’s ability to do all this one handed, but he was distracted by the other hand that was teasingly working the head of his cock. His mind was abruptly brought back into the room with the sound of the bottle hitting the floorboards, as Sherlock flippantly tossed it out of his hand. He then returned it to John’s entrance, pressing his lube slick palm into him. “It’s cold…”, murmured John. The glare Sherlock shot at him made him realise that he had said this out loud. He firmly pressed his lips closed only to throw them wide open as he felt a fingertip push into him.

Shakily, he edged himself off the kitchen counter, Sherlock's hands guiding him as his feet touched the floor. Wobbling slightly, he eventually regained his balance and straightened out his spine. Before his body was given the chance to fully appreciate no longer being forced into an uncomfortable position, he felt a hand press downwards with a gentle force on his good shoulder, reminding him of the task ahead. He locked eyes with Sherlock and they held each other's gaze as he wordlessly lowered himself onto his knees.

The vague nature of the other man's words began to get on John's nerves. Letting out a shout of anger, he threw out a leg intended to connected with Sherlock's side. But he had acted out in rage, miscalculating his stance as the other man easily caught his leg. Pulling him forwards with twist, John fell with a yelp, throwing out his hands in a vain attempt to soften his fall as his head connected with the ground. He groaned, reaching out to grab his
John blinked rapidly. “With all due respect, Sir, I think you might be lost.” Clutching onto the wooden ladle in his hands, he bravely took a step forwards. To anyone else, it would’ve looked as if he was preparing to defend the bath from the apparent intruder.

as he spoke, only this time he held up two fingers instead of one. John somehow knew that both of them were for him.
A nervous chuckle escaped from John’s lips. “Yes, I suppose so.”

His teacher threw him a confused look. "You'd rather be left immobilised on the floor?" It sounded like a genuine question as opposed to a snide remark. The blonde bit his lip in frustration and numbly shook his head. "Yes, that would be rather unwise, I should think." Sherlock crossed over to his room, kneeling softly by his bed and carefully placed the limp man down as gently as he could.

It was still dark enough for the moon to be out in full force. John glanced up to admire its beauty, revelling in how brightly it shone in the star-filled sky. He stared in wonder and slowly closed his eyes, taking comfort in the feeling of his problems being momentarily washed away. He forgot about the House, about Molly, Mother, this random visitor, his chores, his past, his sister Harr-

He gave him a quick sharp nod and turned to leave the room. “Oh and John?”

It was as if the woman had detected his awkwardness, her sharp eyes darting from Sherlock’s to focus on the smaller man instead. John blushed.
“I told you, I’m fine.” But his words went unheard. Sherlock snapped his head round to face Lestrade.

It didn’t take long before the culprit was back in John’s sights. The figure was violently pushing themselves through the crowd, eliciting surprised shouts and angry protests from the many innocent bystanders. Fortunately for John, this meant he was neither slowed down by the hordes of people in the street, nor did he have to try and carve a path for himself through them all, unlike his assailant.
John flinched then relaxed somewhat, “I see you’ve been introduced to Lestrade then, Sir.”
“You can tell a lot about someone from a cup of tea.” Sherlock replied coolly. He twirled his almost empty cup in his hand, watching as the last dregs swirled around and around.

to retrieve the stolen bag of coins. Sherlock was about to lean forwards to retrieve what was his when John stepped forward. “Wait! He’s armed.” The dark haired man stopped to observe his apprentice, making a point of staring at the wound he was clutching. John huffed at the unnecessary expression of worry that tinged Sherlock’s features. “I’m fine.” The blonde mumbled, as he approached the assailant. “Keep your hands up where we can see them.” The figure nodded, but avoided John’s eyes. The blonde approached with caution, crouching beside the culprit to roughly pull apart their robe and hastily grab the purse. At this proximity, John was able to catch a glimpse of the thief. He just about saw the face underneath the hood and he could’ve sworn he’d seen this man before…
“John!” He shouted at him from afar, his voice quieter, but panicked when he arrived by his side. “Are you alright?” The blonde was about to reassure him when his teacher cut in. “You’re hurt.” He eyed John’s wounded leg with such scrutiny that the apprentice almost felt ashamed for having failed to avoid the injury in the first place.

Then his attacker shot forwards with unbelievable speed, their sword drawn behind them with the intention of swooping forwards in a lethal blow. John swore as he rolled away from the assault. Again he was pursued in near darkness by fast paced swooshes of a deadly sharp blade. The blonde dodged and dived away from their attacks, but was unable to land a single blow. He mentally kicked himself for not having some kind of weapon on his persons when he caught sight of both his and Sherlock’s
John couldn’t help the frustration from tinging his voice this time, “Then with all due respect, Sherlock, I should like to request that I am dismissed.”
It was then that Sherlock crossed over to the desk to grab a soft black leather cap, placing it firmly over his dark curls, while at the same time, removing a pair of fingerless studded black leather gloves from his jacket pocket. As he delicately placed them on each hand, John couldn't help his eyes from widening at the sight of the complete look.
"So are you coming to the station or not?" He demanded irritably.

There was a moment of silence as they held each other's gaze. In that moment, John began to admire the way in which the other man's distinct features quite nicely framed his eyes and those lips. These thoughts were being mixed together in Sherlock's scent that heavily lingered on his bed sheets. John tried to grip the sheets, blaming his overloaded senses on the delirious feeling caused by the drug. He blinked heavily in discomfort. One minute, Sherlock was at the other end of the room, the next he was right beside him, delicately stroking the blonde's damp hair.

He decided his voice would hopefully do the trick instead. “What is it, Sherlock?”

Anthea raised an eyebrow; it’s not every day one sees a strange scruffy looking man riding a horse through the middle of the city. Nevertheless, she stepped out of the doorway to bow their guest welcome. As the man’s horse came to a still outside the entrance, two servants darted out to take hold of the reigns. One of those servants was Molly. She politely took a hold of the man’s horse as he hopped off his saddle. Molly couldn’t stop herself from gawping at him and nearly leapt in surprise when he spoke:

Here's a slightly longer chapter than usual to make up for the lack of updates last week. Enjoy!
"Have you done this before?", breathed the detective, his hands were hurriedly undoing the buttons of his trousers. John slowly shook his head, watching Sherlock's hands attentively. His cock sprang forwards as he undid the last button, nearly touching the end of John's nose. He froze for a moment; realisation dawning on him that he had no idea how to fellate another man. A sudden twist presented itself in his gut as his mind raced,
“Your training starts tomorrow.” John looked up and was met with a stern look in Sherlock’s eyes. Fluttering his eyelashes nervously, he nodded his assent. The other man continued, “I expect you to be awake at dawn and presentable shortly after.” He set the cup down on the table and casually flopped backwards onto his bed.

Thankfully the thought was forced out of his mind when the other man came to an abrupt halt. John had to tighten his grip on Sherlock’s arm to prevent himself from falling forwards.
John almost jumped at the sound of Sherlock’s voice. He span around in an attempt to pinpoint the location of the other man, but it was too dark to see. That was until he both heard and saw him light a match, the dark haired man’s face framed in the brightness of the flame. Using it to smoke his

The doctor's fury returned. "Fuck you", only his words were barely audible, as the detective was slowly leaning his face closer to that of John's. It was then that Sherlock softly planted a tender kiss on his lips.
“I won’t get caught”. Molly blinked rapidly, confusion flooding her face. She let out an exasperated sigh and resigned to letting John go. Before she turned to pick up her lamp to go back to her own room, she jabbed John in the arm.

“Yes yes!” Sherlock flung his arms upwards in annoyance, causing some of the contents of the bath to spill over onto the floor. He stood up, climbed out and headed for the mirror. John lamented for the man’s apparent lack of decency, averting his eyes to stare at the ceiling. A blush spread across his face as he twiddled his thumbs behind his back, determined to distract himself. Unbeknown to him, Mycroft had been observing his behaviour the entire time.
John was upright in his bed, his heart thrumming in his chest. He panted as his panic slowly began to subside. Then he noticed a shadow framed in moonlight and the familiar smell of tobacco. He turned his head to meet the figure stood in the doorway of the open

John thought. Sherlock then indicated to the lower half of the blonde’s body, “What about the rest of you then?”
John shuffled on his knees. He wasn’t used to someone’s behaviour being so
He shot upwards with a blubbering shout of surprise. “Morning.” Sherlock chirped, eliciting a glare from a very disgruntled looking John. The taller man tossed the bucket aside causing it to create a loud bang as it connected with the floor. The previous look of amusement had been hastily replaced with that of disappointment, “It’s almost noon.”

John looked up, somewhat dazed. He scrunched his eyebrows in confusion when he noticed Sherlock wasn't looking at his face, but at the lower half of his body. He followed his line of sight and, to his horror, realised he had wet himself. The adrenaline rush from their scuffle and the gut punch must've forced it out of him without him realising. The smaller man could feel his face burn in embarrassment - he felt utterly mortified.
Despite finding some comfort in the closeness of the other man, John glanced over at his bed in the room beside his teacher's. Sherlock answered his question before he had time to voice it. "I've requested that your room be cleaned." He slid the connecting

against his shoulder, he continued with an air of disinterest. "And nothing is the answer to your question. I had rather hoped to avoid my brother's pleas for help, but I ended up relenting eventually." He sighed. "All this trafficking malarkey is bad for business.

“May I?” He indicated to where John was sitting. Despite his confusion, the smaller of the two nodded, breaking his gaze to focus on the horizon again. Sherlock cautiously made his way over to the blonde haired man, careful to balance himself so as not to fall off the roof. He sat himself beside him, staring with burning intensity. A bead of sweat escaped from John’s brow: he disliked the unwanted examination. He could almost feel Sherlock’s breath when he spoke. “You have questions.”
“I said,” Sherlock began, his tone as gentle as before, “Did you brew this yourself?”
“My my, we weren’t expecting you to arrive so soo-“, the smile quickly dropped. “Goodness gracious, look at the state of you!”
"Problem?" Probed Mycroft.

“Curious…”, he murmured to himself.
“W-Watson. John Watson, Sir”, he stammered, his blush growing as Sherlock continued to undress himself.
There was a moment of intense silence. It was broken by the sounds of them both erupting into a fit of giggles.

“Thank you…”, mumbled John.
It was unlike John to play the hero or chase after villains; in fact it was very much outside of his character. He was more accustomed to hiding himself away, preferring to avoid trouble rather than be at its core. However this was different. This person had done his partner wrong.

“Yes please.” And with that, he turned to shout at his boisterous friends who laughed in response as they began their dissent into the night. Sholto briefly turned to steal another look at John who sweetly smiled and waved at the other man as he disappeared down the street. The apprentice let out a small happy sigh, nearly jumping when he felt a firm hand clasp onto one of his shoulders.
The blonde eventually caught up with him, wobbling as he made his way over to the other man’s side. “Sherlock, I can barely walk in these.” He gestured to his

John nearly leapt from the sudden attention, as a dark shade of crimson bloomed across his cheeks. He forcibly removed himself from where he was kneeling, his face a little too close to Sherlock’s crotch. He stumbled slightly as he stood. “Y-yes, Sherlock. I’ll go get that for you now.” He turned, shooting past Molly without giving her so much as a glance and approached a pile of ornate wooden boxes at the opposite end of the room. Throwing one of the many lids open, he shakily fumbled through to find their guest a razor. He had to will himself from jumping again when he heard the other man speak.
"Oh am I not coming with you?" The question sounded a lot sillier out loud than it did in his head, causing John to squirm uncomfortably when Sherlock's eyes flew back from the tea to focus on him.

They walked arm-in-arm for a while, in total silence; the only audible sounds being the constant hum of the city buzzing around them and the click clack of their shoes against stone.

The dark haired man blinked when he turned to look over his shoulder at the red faced blonde although this time it was a look of rage, not embarrassment. He spoke plainly, “I’m making a deal.”
The other man visibly turned to look at the smaller man causing him to squirm. He might not be able to see Sherlock’s eyes in the dark, but he could certainly feel them. “I was already awake.”

gently push his chin upwards. Irene was angling his face to so as to inspect him. John tried to gulp as quietly as possible when he saw the sparkle in her eyes. He let out the breath he didn’t know he’d been holding in when she removed her fan, throwing it open to flutter it. Sherlock smiled fondly at her as she did so.

behind them, which were now rapidly making their way towards John. Despite a valiant attempt to swerve out of their way, one of the blades managed to slice open the top of one of his arms. He hissed, wincing in pain as he clutched at the wound. Regardless, he did not break speed nor stumble from the impact. The figure ahead took a brief moment to peek over their shoulder – John just about caught the look of panic in their eyes. They sharply turned around a corner only to be knocked backwards with a sudden clang. The blonde stopped dead in his tracks, blinking at the now semi-conscious body lying in the dirt. Out from around the street corner came Sherlock. John couldn’t prevent the wide grin from spreading across his features. He puffed his response, “Nice shot.”
His words were met with a sharp look the blonde wasn't quite able to decipher. "Any attempt to bring harm upon this person would most definitely end very badly for you." There was a pregnant pause. Finally Sherlock continued, "I think it wise that you learn how to defend yourself, but I advise against initiating anything, if you can help it." What was left of the space between them was made even smaller. John wanted to back away, but stubbornly stood his ground. "Is that understood?"

"No..."
For a brief moment that barely even lasted a second, all John saw was Sherlock; those unashamed eyes of desire burning right through him. But before the blonde had time enough to react, he was thrown back into the mass of grabbing hands, which now became more feverish in their explorations. John hissed and clenched his teeth as their hold on him grew painfully tight with other hands beginning to claw at him with deep scratches. The golden strands on his head were suddenly yanked back in a sharply uncomfortable grip, leaving his neck exposed and vulnerable. The hands between his thighs grew more desperate with fingers thrusting harder and faster, as his member was pumped mercilessly without hesitation. John balled his own hands into fists as he screwed his eyes shut. Despite the insurmountable terror that coursed through his veins, he couldn’t deny the crest of an orgasm rapidly descending upon him. Arching his back as much as he could, he let out a rumbling moan as the blissful sensation of his climax washed over him. Then everything went white.

Then suddenly, they were outside in the garden. John stopped briefly to catch his breath. Feeling dishevelled and exhausted, he combed a hand through his sweat slick hair, flexing his now sore knuckle and wincing as he did so. He glanced up at the other man who stood a few metres away, absentmindedly rubbing his chin. "Nice shot, but what are your skills with a sword?" John frowned at him, noticing the two

“Ah, finally you’re awake.” Sherlock was crouched near the end of the bed, midway through brewing a pot of tea. “I’ve decided that keeping my distance whilst you’re asleep is wise. Wouldn’t want to fracture those knuckles on my jaw again now, would we?”

“John is quite the character, don’t you think?”
His words seemed to have stung his companion as he briefly caught a glimpse of hurt that flashed across Sherlock’s face. However, as was always the case with his teacher, the expression was gone before he could fully register it. “Very well.” The dark haired man turned to face forwards; both his tone and facial expression were kept painfully neutral. For some reason unbeknown to him, this only served to irritate John further.
John froze, his back still facing the other man. He tried not to clench his fists in annoyance as he turned round to face him.
