He stared towards his armchair, horror clearly written upon his face. He realised what happened. There was only one teabag which was left uninspected. It was sitting in his cup, having provided Mycroft his deduction and Sherlock his tea. He opened the teabag; take care as to not tear any note present inside. In the middle, wrapped in thin sheet of plastic, was John's next note. Sherlock heaved a small sigh of relief he did not know he was holding.
intense now. Two ropes, four couples who have already found each other. The odds are not in your favour, fellas! I would hurry if I were you!”
After a few cake-related jokes, we set down the events in order (We would be celebrating his birthday all day). I still had to find details like what cake Sherlock would like. I didn't tell Molly but I had a secret agenda. I was going to tell him I loved him. I couldn't wait forever. Make or break.
There was something wrong. Something very wrong with Sherlock's voice. He sounded vulnerable, for the first time, he sounded human, when I didn't need him to!
He ran through the corridors, surprised at the darkness. How was he supposed to create darkness now? He opened the doors of the lab, his brain warning him that something unexpected was going to happen.
No ring. I wriggle my fingers, trying to feel the cold metal, but no, the ring was gone. Gone. I violently struggle to free myself from the ropes and yelling
A/N: There are two types of bomb fuzes. An impact fuze detonates a bomb when the projectile strikes its target, and a time fuze acts after a controlled delay.
He gave me thousands of chances to tell him that I loved him. The coward I was, I never did tell him. The society, my parents..how stupid it all seems now. I love you, Sherlock Holmes, I love you with all my heart. You've brought a broken shell of a man back to life. I was a crumpled mess, a mess no one wanted. You've resuscitated me. And, of course, I still believe in you. Always have, always will. I love you, Sherlock William Scott Holmes. Will you do me the honor of being my husband after death?"
“Congratulations, Tony and Hannah! You go to Round twooooo” Tom announced, in midst of the celebratory phrases the band were yelling in the background.
I walked out the door and something made me stop right dead in my tracks. Even in the drenching rain, I spotted a big graffitied "3" on the wall opposite to Ella's office. My eyes bulge out, my hand shivers and I fall. I don't know what's real or not anymore.
My mind is whirring with all the things that had happened the past twenty-four hours. In twenty-four hours, we turned from detective and blogger to fraud and criminal. That wasn't the worst part. I knew Moriarty wouldn't rest until he destroyed Sherlock, until he burns the heart out of Sherlock. And he has. He had destroyed everything what Sherlock most held dear, his work. And now, it is only a matter of time till he tries to kill…no, I would never, never ever let that happen. We wait, for Moriarty's next move.
I try falling asleep but I can't. A tiny, hopeful voice inside me asks me to wait. Maybe Sherlock was busy with the thieves? He did say he loved us (although in a very albeit manner). I decide to wait until Sherlock returns. I would decide then. No need to get so depressed. There would be time for that later.
"I...I think it was good. Very good. Excellent in fact." I took a gulp of water, not knowing what to do.
They were taken to a much picturesque room which on closer inspection turned to be made of movable cardboard walls. John knew he was going to be filmed today but couldn't help feeling self-conscious looking at all the cameras. He then focused his attention towards the six people who were obviously waiting for them. They were posing as impatient people but the overall effect was...well,
“Well, now that we have your attention...” Tom dragged on, with a smirk. He seemed to be enjoying every moment of the suffocating tension in the room. If looks could kill, Tom would have been killed fourteen times.
"Come on now. Wear your wig" Sherlock huffed, throwing a many legged spider on his face, which John later realised was the wig.
to be memorised, to be understood. Like it was the most natural thing in the world for John to know all about Sherlock. He felt a slight desperation to win, to show Sherlock that he noticed too. Noticed his loneliness behind the "I don't have friends!", noticed the heart he refused to acknowledge. He wanted to show Sherlock that he
My face is completely devoid of emotion. I can't talk. I wonder if I should pretend that I didn't hear her.
I hit a dead-end. No other possibility occurs to me. A fear that Molly was right starts creeping in.
I see him. John. Alone at the table. He was early. For one moment, my façade of calm disappears. I am scared, very scared. For the first time, I wonder:
"I'm sorry?" Mr. Sagarson said, clearly confused. He did not understand the one word argument the couple were presently having. Or what triggered it. All he knew was that Mr. Holmes turned to that doctor and it just broke out.
"Mrs. Hudson!" the man looked up, a genuine smile lighting up his face. He hugged her before she could say something. His arms felt strong and secure.
John, meanwhile, was left cursing internally as he felt William's fingers applying a lot of things on his face. He felt something watery first, then something cool, and later something waxy. The textures kept changing but what held John's attention was William's smooth teasing strokes of the brush on his skin. Up, down, sideways...every stroke felt intense. Sometimes, William's fingers would hold his face one way or the other and John was left to control his heartbeat and to keep reminding himself to breathe slowly.
The case was better than John imagined it would be. Frankly, the thief (who had been dubbed Mr. S) had gained John's respect when he stole the diamond. Bypassing Mycroft's security was no piece of cake. Pretending to be the jeweler? Amazing. All of Mycroft's guards were looking outside but not inside.
"Oh, Sherlock. How nice to see you happy again" Mrs. Hudson said, smiling too. His happiness was always contagious.
, okay? I am not asking you to marry me or anything – I am willing to wait. Wait for you to trust again. Wait for you to hope that I won't leave. Because, really, Sherlock, all we have is hope. Hope
A question I cannot answer, John. I am torn between losing my mind, the very substance of who I am and becoming insane or losing…all of you. (Not Mycroft, though) –SH
John: (draft) I don't blame you. You warned me right at the start. Married to your work. My mistake, really.
They were led into another room along with the other contestants. John was left at the entrance (he assumed) and Sherlock was taken further along the room. Tom’s voice came in through the speakers of the room.
John seemed a little preoccupied. Well, I could always find out later. Right now, the bomb is the priority. The most important thing to be dealt with.
My worst fear? That was actually very easy. The hope that fills me dares me to take a leap forward, to show Sherlock what he really meant to me.
However, Sherlock got up. It was enough that he had to be best man. He did not have to listen to the love of his life talking about his fiancée.
"You see, there's only one way in which I can help..." Sherlock began, only to be cut off by John again.
John stiffened up immediately. He slowly turned to face Sherlock. The distance was painfully close, or rather painfully far. John was about to say something when:
"I can't, John" she says, and runs out of my room. However, I could still hear her sobbing outside my room. It all felt unimportant. Was I really mad? Was yesterday a hallucination? Was it my mind's way of recreating my hopes, recreating my dreams, recreating all that could have been? For the first time, I'm glad they've tied me down.
Sherlock: (draft) For what it's worth, I really and truly loved you. And I usually regret loving at the end, but I don't. You were the best person I could have ever hoped to be friends with. I've loved you and maybe, just maybe, I regret it now. Just a little.
He eagerly rifled through the tea bags for John's next note. There was none. He had even opened all the teabags (more like tore them in a combination of disbelief and precision)
"Molly" I say. She turns, her eyes fearful. "It has all been done before. Remember how Adler faked her death?" I know I'm grasping at straw but I don't care. The other alternative cannot be true.
John: (draft) You...you..you love me. Sherlock Holmes loves me. The fire, the gunshot...you love me.
"Don't tell me you don't love a surprise" John's voice sounded behind him. Sherlock turned so fast that his neck cricked. John looked merely amused. And a little bit happy.
Mycroft was never adept with emotions. Not to be confused with ignorant, however. Mycroft understood emotions all too well. He knew enough to manipulate people into doing his bidding. He knew what emotions could make a person do. What he didn't know however, was to deal with such emotions when it was his younger brother feeling these things. Relationships were always tricky, especially when the other party is married. Mycroft dare not gamble with such risky odds. So Mycroft did what he could, despite his better judgment. He continued tapping Sherlock's and John's phones. The results were, well, unexpected.
A slight smile. Clink of cutlery while we ate. This man was confusing and yet. I felt like I knew him all my life.
This hit me. I know John thinks of me as an unemotional stone man, but that's not me. I have difficulty expressing feelings. I envy John so much for that. He could charm a whole room without difficulty while I have problems charming even a single person (ok maybe two, because you know, Molly). I never could charm people for a long time. People only like me when I pretend to be someone else. The only people who's liked me, even after knowing me, is John, Mrs. Hudson, Molly, and Lestrade. And, Moriarty was right. That was why I loved them.
John), he had no idea what to do. Should he pursue this and watch it going to ruins and lose his only friend?
A girl who looked about twenty took William to a neighbouring mirror and asked him to close his eyes. She carefully scrutinised his face and then frowned. John, who was sitting beside William, could see her confusion. How could she make him
"Exactly, Jo-Hamish! I'm trying to make friends with the crew to get some dirt. Nothing so far. Shall we go and take a look at his rooms?"
I go to my mind palace. I go down the stairs where Redbeard's waiting for me. Not now, boy. I walk through the endless passage of doors with Redbeard. I go to the courtroom. This is the room I used to make major decisions. Or to contemplate about something.
I was a broken man, an adrenaline-junkie, a man who cared about none and with none who cared about me. Life with Sherlock…it didn't normalize my life but rather made it better than I could ever hope for. Every day was new, bold, exciting. Nothing was ever dull. Like I told Mycroft, I was never bored. Truly, he's the best thing that could have ever happened to me.
"I'm William and you are Hamish" Sherlock said, readying himself for another explosion. It did not come. Clearly, John was too tired to argue.
After the fire in the kitchen, I went out to buy Sherlock's gift for his birthday. There was a month left but I wanted to be ready. Some of the things had to be bought now. I find the place I was looking for.
The second anniversary of the Fall was approaching. I was reminded of my promise that I would wait in many subtle ways. For example, there was one time I got someone else's newspaper. And the headline? "Not dead" (Well, the story turned out to be about some Egyptian tombs or something). Another time, one of my patients had a breakdown in my office saying how a guy promised that he would wait for her but never did. It felt like the Universe liked to watch me suffer with indecision. And the worst was when I went to buy Mary a ring. I decided I would propose to her on the day of the Fall so that I would fulfill my promise. I finally decided upon one (Looking at the rings made me very depressed so I went with the one which had diamonds and could be bought with my meager salary) I paid the bill, put the ring in my pocket and was walking towards the exit. There, (I could have sworn they weren't there before) in a flashing array of lights, were a set of rings. Upon closer inspection, all of them turned out to be the same ring. The ring I hallucinated. Needless to say, I blacked out.
I was shot in the shoulder in Afghanistan and thus deported. I was given some money, but what use was money to a broken man? A man who understood that life was without purpose and the other seven billion are
My stomach does tiny flip-flops whenever someone texts my name. Mainly Sherlock. Ok, forget I said that.
It was the day of my discharge. Also, the day of Sherlock's….funeral. I did not want to go. Going would mean that Sherlock was dead. That it was over. That what happened that night was a hallucination. Some small part of me wanted to kill myself, but a bigger part wanted me to wait. Wait for three more years. Three years after which I could kill myself. I smile, for the first time in days. In three years, either he was going to join me or I was going to join him. I attend the funeral in this maniac mindset.
I smile. I feel a little bit like Sherlock's John, pissed at his inappropriate deductions. I feel a little angry too, at him for leaving me in this state
John started to hyperventilate. Looking at the time fuze must have made him realize the full implications of the bomb. He started breathing heavily.
Attention. The sad truth was he paid the same amount of attention towards everyone, towards everything. Nothing sadder than unrequited love
Sherlock merely nodded, going into a trance-like state, picturing himself in the murder scene. The first scene: three people, cosily playing cards, having fun. The windows are closed (it was winter- John had been surprisingly good with the details. It was a thirty page book). So, there must have been a fireplace or an electric heater keeping them warm. They may have a hot beverage – cocoa? Mark leaves, claiming he had to go back to his flat. They all say goodbye and Mark leaves. The door is closed and the windows are secured. No sign of footprints near the windows.
"Molly" I said in a low voice, "I know you loved Sherlock too. I'm sorry. But, I'm telling you, he's alive"
This feeling however, soon left, only to be replaced by sadness. Grief overshadowed me and even Redbeard could not console me this time.
Friends who would die for me. Friends who would go along with me through my battles. That is my only lesson to you, Hamish. Have lots of friends but make sure you know who the real ones are. This will save you a lot of pain.
He smiles, clearly relieved as to how I was taking it. I smile back, but there are a thousand emotions in the back of my head. I would see Sherlock again. I would hear him talk again. It was the best gift I could have gotten this birthday. For the first time in months, I feel a little alive again.
Well, we stopped the flame before it could spread. Since you haven't heard me and ran off Sherlock, I'll tell you here: The kitchen is off limits for fire-related experiments!
"I've read it John. The Reichenbach Fall, you called it?" he says, in his low baritone. My heart skips a beat and he could see that on the monitor. Here I was in a hospital, feeling like rubbish and the man I loved is going to tell me he could never love me that way.
Such was the state of my mind when I was lying on the bed next to Mary. I look at her, sleeping peacefully. Her tranquil face soothed me and I found myself relaxing slowly and looking into the matter rationally.
First clue is to find the first clue. To the thing that has puzzled me. Sounded like a loop. Nectar for others, poison for me.
I know he's saying something and my mind barely registers what he's saying but I am somewhere else. A thousand voices – each voicing a different thought, a different emotion. I felt conflicted – as if there were multiple parts of me, each having their own personality and each part wanting to me to either kiss him or punch him. Is this what insanity felt like?
Sherlock woke up in the morning with the sun shining bright on his face. He snuggled into his rug, trying to shield his eyes from the sun.
"We've got past round two and no further. We've only been married for a year, though. We are working on it." Mr. Sagarson said, looking slightly embarassed.
I control myself from talking to John. It had been two years since I was this close. Part of me hoped John would see me and thus see through my disguise. But no, he is too busy looking at the menu. Food. Seriously, John?
I wait for an hour but I still don't get a reply. All my hope diffuses out slowly. Of course, Sherlock didn't love me. Just because he knows my favorite color? Or that he pays attention to me? News-flash! He does that to everything in his surroundings. He probably pays the same attention to his skull. There was no reason for me to feel special. None at all. Who was I, a mere man in the millions of people, to be anything but ordinary to Sherlock? I was addicted to the level of attention he gave me. He was everything to me and I mean nothing to him. I am merely a bundle of flesh and clothes which can talk. A goldfish.
I wonder, as to what to ask Sherlock next. I decided against asking him how he survived the fall…Sherlock would always divert the topic. He avoided talking about the Fall as much as I did.
"It was merely deactivating it, John. Not exactly quantum mechanics" he whispered back, now scanning the entire room.
"What do you think?" John asks, casually. Internally, his heart was racing to see what Sherlock would say.
They've already recorded it. They are trying to video tape and release it as a single. More publicity"
He soon found the box of tea bags beneath the experimental apparatus in the cupboard. It took him quite some time to get the box. This, he realised, was John's way (other way - the first was yelling) of telling him how hard it was to make tea in the apartment.
I go out and buy a bottle of champagne. I take my time, planning to be exactly on the time his reservation was made. I can't not be happy. The love of my life was going to propose to me. It is all fine.
"Get me more information about the exes" Sherlock told Lestrade, already furtively typing on his phone, only to realise there was no Internet connection.
"It was something pure. And, you ruined it, a mere thirty minutes later. Are you happy now?" I yelled at him. I felt like a fool. The song had meant a lot to me and it was clear that he didn't care about the song. It made me angry. The music deserved some respect; maybe not from the audience but at least the player!
"John" she starts in a soothing voice. I completely detest the voice. It was the same tone in which Ella talked to me. I don't reply. Frankly, I was too weak after I yelled at her.
John: (draft) Do you know the worst part? Some part of me was happy. Happy that I was going to die with you. I hate you so much Sherlock Holmes.
On the matter of love. Firstly, we do not care as to who you love. Never be scared to be who you are (I know what you prefer, and I am not disappointed) And, Hamish, do not believe, even for a single second, fairy tales are restricted to books. If you wish so, you could make your own fairytale. I know that you will be cynical, no doubt due to you uncle's training. But, let me give you an example. My life with John has been a fairy tale. True, it's unbelievable, especially since we live he life of the common couple. Yes, we fight about who gets the milk. Yes, your father had to buy two refrigerators. We bicker a lot. We are old people now, who merely drink tea and research about bees. All of this will have given you the impression that we are the most common, dull, routine couple there is. But, there is more to that, Hamish. Did you know your father killed a person for me on the very day I met him? Did you know that I asked him help in hundreds of cases where he could have been killed but he never faltered? Actually, he was once under gunpoint and wrapped up in semtex – enough to completely demolish an apartment. I was so sure he would leave me after that. After all, which crazy person would be willing to stay? I think that's the question Hamish, are you willing to stay after you know how crappy the other person's life is? You don't know how broken he was after the Fall. You don't know what I had to do to save John. I was ready to die for him. It all comes down to that, Hamish, what are you willing to give up for your person? This are the questions I want you to ask yourself before you propose.
The whole world turns upside down. This is what he was. Best friend. Was John that cruel to make him his best man? Surely the agony because of John marrying her was not enough? Was Sherlock to be punished by actually having to arrange a marriage he didn't want to happen? Sherlock pauses, trying desperately to not let his expression show. He forced his face to remain neutral while trying to calm the tumult of emotions threatening to tear up the fragile wall he had created. He had spent years practicing to control his emotions. He had succeeded.
Today was special, though. Officially, he was a wanted thief in three countries from today. He had a sum of five thousand pounds on his head, dead or alive. According to the newspapers, he was called Iron J because he left metal J's every time he stole something. This was the bait Mycroft planted to catch Mr. S. Mycroft was ready, the nets were in place. Today was the beginning of the end.
John Hamish Watson. It was all for him. All the things I had done the past two years. They were to ensure he was safe. I was an idiot to let my emotions to take over me at the wrong moment. Months of planning could have been ruined. Proposing to John was one of the best moments of my life, but it was the wrong time. I and Mycroft spent months to plan the perfect fake suicide. The entire thing was staged so that John would believe that I was dead. And, I, the idiot I was, went back to John the same night. Well, I had to. His entry on Reichenbach Fall made me forget everything.
I sat on the bench he was sitting on earlier, looking all around me. I wondered if I would ever see him again. I sat there for a long time, watching the light, the flowers, the Tower – I truly felt what could only be described in one word.
"This report contains conversations between William Sherlock Scott Holmes and other people, which include Mycroft Holmes and John Hamish Watson during the time period codenamed
This was something I truly did not know about John. What would be his worst fear? Getting shot again? Dying early?
As expected, the couples beside him groaned. The man with whom John talked to earlier, looked at him with utter disbelief as John got up. He slowly made way through the disappointed crowd, trying to focus on not stamping anybody's foot. After an eternity, he reached the stage, the lights blinding him. John swore, were they going to deprive him of his five senses today? He climbed onto the stage, shaking everyone's hands, still blinded to see who it was he gave his hand to.
"Use your brain, Lestrade. There are so many ways. One: They could have stolen it from the staff. Two: They are a tech genius. Three: The couple let them in. I could go on all day" Sherlock, now, going through the official file since he had no other option.
I go to Marylebone Road twenty minutes before whatever John was going to do there. I make my way into the restaurant. My mind was telling me that John made a reservation knowing that I would be back.
He took a deep breath, climbing on to the window sill. Mycroft had arranged a rope to be placed so that he could reach the top of the roof. He caught hold of the rope, adrenaline racing in his blood. John had never felt more alive. He climbed out of the window, trying to not look below him. Every nerve in his body was tingling with electricity, his blood was hot with anticipation. If he slipped, it would be a miracle if someone could identify his face. He reached the top, and John let out a huge sigh of relief. Safe and sound.
"Love? Of course he does not. He may have a crush on you but that will fade away. Everything fades away, Sherlock. Especially human emotions."
"So, what do you think?" he asked bluntly. He did not mince words, this one. And on some deep level, I already knew this about him.
Not trusting himself to speak, John merely shrugged. Diana smiled at them both again, this time with much more enthusiasm.
I looked at the empty room. John wasn't home yet. I talk to my skull (friend. Well, when I say friend….)
John: (draft) It started with the butterflies but you could have warned me that it would end in pain.
I add trivia, to not let him know that John was going to propose to Mary. Sherlock was good at deducing what people don't say.
Sherlock: (draft) I never told you this, but I didn't need to get high when you were with me. I was high on you. But now...
Mary had joined as a replacement nurse for my existing nurse. She surprised me by asking me out. One great thing about Mary was that she understood. She understood that I loved Sherlock (Of course, she thought I loved him platonically). She understood that she will never be my entire world. She was okay with being only a part of my world. She had traumas of her own, she once said. She understood that she was never supposed to talk about Sherlock and I understood that I shouldn't ask about her past. She observed spectacularly. She knew what things would set me off. She understood my one week off a year rule. Meeting Mary has been one of the best things that could have ever happened to me. She taught me a new philosophy:
I decided that moving on from Sherlock meant taking that walk down memory lane. I summon up my courage to go into our flat.
They both shook hands and went through the details of the competiton. Apparently, there were three rounds. They sounded pretty ridiculous to be frank. The first round was to test the couple's understanding. They would be blind-folded and would have to find each other. They were not allowed to speak. The first five couples who did so would reach the second round. All other rounds were equally corny.
Yes, dear. I wish you took him with you. I think he's feeling lonely. You shouldn't leave him like that, you know – Mrs.H
Sherlock: (draft) I'm falling in love with you all over again. And there's nothing I can do about it.
I drop my phone. It falls down, slowly, but I'm not paying attention. Did I really mean that much to John? Hope pushes me. I had to do this before I lost courage.
“You never were a good liar, Watson!” admonished his inner conscience. John calmly pressed Shift+Delete. Sherlock Holmes was not the only person who had a mind palace after all.
"Sherlock. Human emotion can never be rationalized. It's a blind leap where you hope you don't fall. A gamble with the most extraordinary odds. A decision which has no logical reasoning. Be careful, brother mine….." and Mycroft fades away along with the courtroom. I decide to let John know that I loved him, but not make it too obvious. I could not ruin our friendship.
It's the least John deserved after all I put him through. He loved her? I will silently accept it. I will not make him choose after he has already chosen. I wouldn't risk his friendship for anything in the world.
"No. No. No. No no no. Please Molly, tell me he's alive. Please tell me he'll be back after three years. Please, Molly. Please, I'm begging you" I plead with her with tears in my eyes.
John hurried to the museum, his heart racing with the pump of adrenaline. It had been so long since John felt this way. Mr. S successfully stole a jade hairpin worth nine million pounds from the Victoria and Albert Museum. Today was a holiday for the museum. How did he get past the security outside?
He went into the hospital, trying to figure out who it was he was going to meet. As far as he could make out (by the vehicles in the parking spot), John and Molly were there. No one else was there though (why was he expecting multiple people again?).
Tea was ready. Mrs. Hudson slowly poured it into a cup. She mixed some of her "herbal soothers" in them. Sherlock would need them today. She takes the tray and frowns. She was unsure as to how Sherlock was feeling right now. She listens to the waltz music coming from Sherlock's flat.
"John, I'm so sorry. I really am. I know you..we are going through a lot of things which we do not understand" she took a deep breath and continued,
"…I am the most unpleasant, rude, ignorant and all-round obnoxious arsehole that anyone could have the misfortune to meet…" Sherlock went on.
I arrive at Marylebone Road an hour before I was supposed to meet Mary. I was that nervous. All my nerves were tingling with anticipation. Sadly, it was not due to the fact that I was proposing. No matter how hard I try to convince myself, I knew the state of my anticipation was due to the end of two years. End of waiting. It was Sherlock's time to keep up his promise. Ninety nine percent of me was telling me (in a voice very much like Sherlock's) that I was stupid. But, there was that one percent that was feeling justified in keeping my end of the promise, no matter how ludicrous. I sat, contemplating as to how to propose. Clever as she was, she must have already figured out that I was going to propose to her.
Sherlock looked at his presents, overwhelmed by the love of his friends. He turned to thank John once again. Only problem, John wasn't there. He went to his bedroom, clutching Mycroft's present with him.
"And, John? I am the most unpleasant, rude, ignorant and all-round obnoxious arsehole that anyone could have the misfortune to meet. But, you've changed that John. Changed me. You've taught me to hope. Hope that I will be loved by someone for pure and unselfish reasons. Hope that I'll always have someone by me when I need them the most. You've made me the man I am today. You've saved me so many times and in so many ways that you'll never even comprehend. It's been one hell of a ride John, of mystery, murder and mayhem. And I look forward to doing that after the next three years"
"He plays the violin sometimes. Varies with his moods. You can only imagine the screeching and the wailing when he's angry" John shuddered, remembering the last time when he did not have a case for two days.
I've always loved stories of treasure hunts and texting when it comes to Sherlock. Figured if I like them so much, I should write them.
Sherlock seemed to be completely okay with the fact that John was engaged to Mary and intended to marry her
He ran through the corridors, surprised at the darkness. How was he supposed to create darkness now? He opened the doors of the lab, his brain warning him that something unexpected was going to happen.
John's happiness was worth it. His entire face lit up. Sherlock smiled a genuine smile for the first time in weeks. John's happiness was worth it.
"Well, it's the safest way. I played with the idea of being the make-up artist but I don't think you have the connections. Anyway, this is more efficient."
. He snorted loudly which surprised everyone. He put on an expression of someone whose ego had just been injured.
I tell my client that I had to go. He nods, after all, he does have twelve guards of his own. I walk out of the bank, being careful as not to let the thieves see me. I see a black car waiting for me. I hop in. Slyvia (Anthea's real name) greets me. She has had a crush on Mycroft from a really long time. I wonder how Mycroft could have been so blind. Was I blind to certain things too?' SHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHS
with excitement. The woman literally was jumping and down her seat, clutching the paper that denoted their number. John braced himself for their groans.
It was quite the symmetric look, two guys (Matt and Peter on the left), the two girls (Diana and Alexa on the table) and the other two guys (Harry and Sam on the right near the wall). However, John was sure that no one was thinking
They all give him their gifts and soon left. It was only John and Sherlock now. John suggested going back to 221 B. Sherlock acquiesced.
I was beginning to feel a little anxious – it had been three days since the texts had arrived. My despair at his ignorance to my almost-professed love vanished in the face of him facing danger. I ached to join him in whatever mad chase he was in right now. Despite what Sherlock believed, I helped him in catching criminals, no longer because of the adrenaline – I did it to make sure Sherlock would be safe. Not that Sherlock would know that, the unobservant git.
Tom, once again skipping back to the centre of the room, looked at everyone expectantly. His eyes were sparkling and there was a jump to his step. How was this guy
in his and went to meet Diana, the female lead of the band. If either had any discomfort in said handholding, it wasn't expressed.
tomorrow, there is only one thing I want to teach you. Most of my life was pretty meaningless. I woke up, I worked, I went home and I slept. I was just another face in the crowd, another statistic. No one really paid attention to me. And even when they did, it was
No one answered. Everyone was looking at each other with hope and worry. Ruby (our previous make-up artist), came to blindfold us. She put the fold on Sherlock and then slowly put on John’s.
Christmas found Mycroft, John and Agent Delta in Mycroft's office, discussing last minute tactics and going through THE PLAN. Needless to say, no one was in a festive mood.
Sherlock increased his pace, clearly not happy with how things were. John was a little worried too, he wanted to win so
Please note that these conversations have been arranged in chronological order and the details have been omitted for the sake of brevity.
Surprisingly, the thing which I thought would burn a hole in my pocket turned out to be very cheap. Cheapest of all my gifts, in fact. (I always liked getting multiple gifts when I was a kid and figured Sherlock did too)
The British Government, on the other hand, had other important issues on his plate. It was in the state of mood, Mycroft received a call from Lestrade.
Mrs. Hudson knew better to ask him what he was talking about. Sherlock needed his space. He would tell her in his own time.
I was about to sleep when I received a text. Funnily enough, my text made the same noise Sherlock's did when he met Irene. Wait, there was the noise again. But, it sounds more male. Not the same noise, then. I opened my phone. I received two texts from Sherlock. Huh. I wonder when Irene got hold of my phone. I hope it's not a plea, no, wait, order for help. I really had no strength to run after criminals today.
I know I shouldn't be, but I am insanely happy about his compliment even at such a time. A time when my entire life could end. John is completely changing me and I did not know if I was ready for that. It all depends on how things go with the bomb.
Sherlock felt many emotions – initially blindness, then confusion, later surprise and a little happiness, and finally he settled on
The client came in and after a few preliminary deductions (or in other words, showing off), Sherlock sat in his arm-chair and folded his palms.
"There is a bomb in one of the carriages. We need to find out where!" he said, pulling my hand along with him. I did not resist. I was too preoccupied with the movement of his lips and his hand in mine. I force myself to snap into reality, realizing that hundreds of people's lives were hanging in the balance. I take out my phone.
The entire room was filled with a deafening din of noises whilst Sherlock pulled the rope. A bucket of water fell from above, drenching them head to toe. John immediately removed his blindfold, giggling after he realised what happened. William seemed to have done the same, because John found himself staring at William’s eyes. A light drizzle still continued, but neither of them moved away, instead they focused on smiling at each other. This was normal, this was two friends enjoying a joke. This was just like the million other times John and Sherlock shared a joke, just the two of them. This was familiar territory, this was
"Look, Sherlock. This is the most important day of my life and I want to be up there with two people whom I love and care about the most."
I flinch. I never liked birthdays. When I was a kid, I always looked forward to birthday. But after a year or two, I got irritated. People never bought you what you truly wanted. The day was full of fake cheery people who wished you a happy birthday. Mycroft was the only one who knew I wanted. Not because he pays attention to me, because he gives attention to everything. I stopped celebrating birthdays as soon as I realized no one ever pays attention to what I really like.
Everyone was too busy staring at the box to notice Sherlock quietly re-activating the app, his fingers typing nimbly under the coat. A quick vibration reminded John of what was to come. He nodded at Sherlock, who in turn, nodded hesitantly back. John furrowed his eyebrows in thought – did Sherlock look
There was suddenly silence for which John was very grateful. He blinked again, his vision slowly becoming normal. He then realised the cause for silence.
"This is where we part, Doctor." he said, a small sad smile on his face. He started walking away with his violin, clearly going home.
There was thunderous applause at the end. These girls who seemed to be resonate alongside of me now suddenly seemed foreign. Was this addition only pleasurable to the French?
Ok, really didn't expect you'd type this much. You do have a favorite! And, purple is my favourite too! – JW
"Ruby, do you mind if I do his cheeks? I would love some contouring tips" William said, in that cute voice puppy-eyed look John only knew too well. Not surprisingly, she agreed.
I begin yelling, my mind racing with the possibility of death. I am scared for my life and Sherlock's.
"Here again, Sherlock?" Mycroft's voice reverberates across the empty hall. As much as I detested him, he was the epitome of decision-making. He was also a great teacher. I stand opposite to him, silent.
Sometimes, when I'm not busy working and fortunately (or maybe unfortunately) Sherlock has no case and we are not running after a criminal in the alleys of London or he's not about to set fire to the kitchen, I sit and wonder, what exactly we all look for in a life partner. Looks? Well, maybe. Kindness? Definitely. I was always more of a action based guy, so I am looking for someone who needs an adrenaline fix. But, at the end of the day, I think, we all want partners who show attention to us. We want someone who wants to know what has happened in our life. We all need a good listener, a good observer. We need someone who understands if we are tired or not based upon the sound of our footsteps. It feels nice, to be the receiver of such attention. That we mean the world to at least one person. The one person worth living for (no, I'm not suicidal). Deep down, we are all attention seekers, waiting for people who want to listen to your story. Ok, wait, I think Sherlock has set the kitchen on fire, the sprinklers are on.
I go down to make myself a cup of tea. I see his wallet on the sofa. What luck! I eagerly open it to see his license. It must have been his license when he was a teenager. I couldn't stop a small giggle that came out when I saw his picture.
Oh, okay then. I'll use this opportunity to get to know you. It's only fair, considering how much you know about me – JW
I was bored. Utterly, completely, entirely, wholly, fully, absolutely, totally bored. So bored that I spent time thinking about the synonyms of utterly. I wish John hadn't taken his gun back (I know where he keeps it – he hid it in my room, under the mattress of my bed. I have to admit, he can be creative sometimes). However, he's warned me he'll move out if I shoot the walls again. I know better. Bullets bother John, especially after his shoulder wound in Afghanistan. The only reason he could shoot that cabbie was because of me. Once a soldier, always a soldier I suppose. And that confrontation with Moriarty at the pool didn't help matters, either. Hmm..Moriarty, death suits him. I've killed the spider, but his webs still remain, no matter how much I cut them. Something big was coming, I knew it. Moriarty's dead, but his endgame was going to begin.
There was a high pitched scream and a couple went to the stage, resembling Sherlock when he first hears about a good case, that is, giggly and jumpy. John couldn't see anything.
Sherlock: (draft) I guess love is irrational after all. Magnussen was right. You'd do anything for her and...I'd do anything for you.
"So, John", he says kneeling in front of me, "Would you do me the honor of marrying me after three years?". His beautiful eyes burn with love. He looked a mess, bloodied cloak and blood matted to his hair. But, he never looked more beautiful to me.
"John" she says and her voice breaks down. She tries talking but can't. She steadies herself and replies,
Got on with his life? Got on? Got on…..oh! How blind, how foolish, how stupid I had been. I fall down and lay crumpled on the pavement with my head in my hands. How incredibly idiotic of me! I should have been able to deduce this right at the restaurant.
The file was precisely that, until Mycroft found Sherlock's texts neatly printed in a book as an account of the clean-up he did. What he didn't anticipate, however, was a nice little subsection reserved for Sherlock's and John's conversation. Mycroft knew for a fact that Sherlock and John never communicated those two years. Curious, he read the report with interest.
I made a fake-prescription to buy hypnotic drugs that would numb my mind. There was no way I could live through even a single day feeling like this. I started drinking too (Not as much as Harry though). To me, everyday was numb. Dull. Nothing happened to me anymore. Wake up. Go to the hospital. Do required work. No social interaction of any kind. Come home. Drink a bit. Sleep. Repeat. I live like a robot. Greg tried to talking me into going to pubs but honestly, I had no patience for that sort of thing. How boring it all seems now. Molly visits at least twice a week, checking as to how I felt. I would say I'm fine, she would act like she believed me. It felt nice, however, to know that she truly cared for me. I must do something for her before these three years end. Mrs. Hudson would call once a week. I never had the courage to take the call. That is my life now, the life of a robot. The life of the man I was before I met Sherlock. A life with no purpose. A life without meaning. Mere existence. Plowing my way through time, waiting for three more years.
After 0987,0034,0001,0689,1230, it was the turn of Mr. Sagarson. He walked towards the laptop and typed:
"Hamish. Right. The crowds were pretty anti-LGBT back there. You okay, Hamish? You looked quite angry..."
, a Cheshire grin on his face. "We just wrapped up our shoot for a song cover. Something tells me you weren't sorry to witness it. Anywaaaaaay...Are you all excited? Nervous?"
Both of them sneaked out, determined not to let anyone see them. They soon found the manager's room. He was apparently in because they could hear him talk on the phone. Sherlock frowned and beckoned John so that they could leave.
Sherlock relaxed, and instead put on an expression John was very familiar with. He became consulting detective Sherlock from model William.
The living room of 221 B, Baker Street was filled with text noises for the next two minutes. A very confused night-gown clad Sherlock Holmes checked his phone, not knowing what the ruckus was about.
someone – there would be no moving on. At least not in the mere twenty years he had left. Caring was not an advantage, not when he knew he would be left broken hearted. So, Mycroft and Sherlock chose the only path remaining – a marriage to their work. It worked spectacularly well. However, now with John...Sherlock locked away this particular thought process. He read the clue again, the location
"No, no, no. I prefer to think of it as a new chapter" Sherlock said, trying his best to sound indifferent. Optimistic, even. Mycroft did not need to know what Sherlock was going through right now.
It creeps up on him, the driving need to protect his friends. Nearly swamps him the first time one of his comrades rushes to his aid when he falls. He rallies and they stand, back to back until the horns sound victory and retreat. The sense of panic doesn’t fade when they leave the field, he tries to drown it in the celebration that follows. The certainty that no matter what he does these men will die, balanced against the knowledge that his actions could delay that certainty.
John stoops and pulls up his own pants and trousers. “You’ve actually ruined my trousers.” Murray had managed to rip the button hole as well as snapping the button off.
He feels almost human again after the run and the shower that followed, goes willingly back into his cage to await dinner, his mind forcibly ignoring what happens after dinner.
“Can you see any of the…” John lifts his chin and turns his head, stretching his neck. He’d chosen the button up with the highest collar he could find, hoping to cover the flexible metal band at his throat since it seemed unlikely he’d be allowed to remove it.
He thinks about pushing Sherlock over the kitchen table and taking him without preamble. Thinks that Sherlock would let him after the blow job on the couch. Sherlock had practically begged for it... he would let John do whatever he wanted.
about me. Name’s Greg. I’m Mycroft’s familiar.” There’s a hint of dry humour in his voice and John turns his head to take a proper look at him.
John throws his free arm over his mouth to try and stifle his moans; his heart feels like it might explode in his chest, beating hard and fast. “Gods, I’m so close… fuck… so good…
Greg’s face gets a bit red and he looks down at his cup. “Well not all the time I’ve known him, but more than he’s not.”
John’s tongue slips between his lips, runs along the seam between Murray’s fingers. He tastes like smoke and dirt, metal, sweat and just a hint of whiskey; Murray slides two fingers into John’s mouth and John sucks them, swirling his tongue over the pads and callouses, greedy for the taste of Murray’s skin.
And then you'd fuck his mouth, your hands wrapped around his skull, holding him still while you fucked him until your legs trembled and you wanted to come down his throat.
“They have families?” John had fought a war against them, never once had anyone said anything about families of Dominii.
“Screen on.” Mrs. Hudson nods at the solid wall behind him, now flickering with the header page of the BBC news site. “It’s voice controlled, I’m sure you can sort it out.”
You could pull back, ask him if it was alright. "Like that?" He'd nod or grunt or just push his face back down on your cock.
“They don’t spring fully formed from eggs, or whatever they told you in the war. They don’t reproduce the same way we do. But yeah, they have families.” For some reason that makes Greg blush even more. “Most of the families have familiars, like me. People who have, for whatever reason, chosen to become involved with a Dominus. Sometimes… sometimes we are bred for it, sometimes we choose it ourselves.” He levels a look at John. “I fell in love with Mycroft, before the Dominii announced themselves. I’ve been his familiar for 13 years now.”
John cries out, the sharp pain of the Dominus’ teeth in the still healing skin of his shoulder sending shock waves down his arm.
Greg is here to explain, but he's also aware that John is not in the same position he is. Which probably makes him not nice either.
The Dominus slows his strokes, pulling gently on John’s cock and fucking slow and smooth into John’s arse. John flails ineffectively against the chains until he manages to wrap his hands around the chains at his wrists and gain some purchase against the suspension sling.
Sherlock doesn’t say anything about John having been away, despite John lugging his duffel up the stairs right under Sherlock’s nose. But he also doesn’t show any adverse side effects from John’s memory wipe. He just picks up a conversation John knows nothing about, makes frustrated noises about having to go back over the more important bits. John falls into his chair with a sigh, hiding any traces of a smile under his ‘Yes Sherlock, I’m listening face.’ Getting back up to speed only takes an hour or so, and then John pretends to poke at his blog and Sherlock eventually takes up the violin.
“You have cardio scheduled every day, workout and cardio every other day, they rotate morning and afternoon. I wouldn’t know really, I just follow the schedule in the mornings. He also wants you weaned off refined sugars and carbs.”
Time moves only in increments measured by Murray’s breath in John’s ear, the slow softening of Murray’s cock in John’s arse, and perhaps the slight brightening of the sky outside the dirty windows. John feels himself coming back together, the slight trickle of come down his thigh turning into something that he’d rather clean up than allow to continue. He shrugs his shoulders under Murray’s weight. “Oi, where’s my breakfast?”
John leans forward and presses his advantage. “I thought Donovan’s head was going to explode when you opened that secret door. Honestly, who even has secret doors anymore?”
“I do, Dominus.” His cock twitches, remembering Murray holding him down, fingers stuffed in his mouth to keep John quiet, taking him quick and raw in their foxhole.
John closes his eyes, ducks his chin down. He wants to say no, wants to deny the way his bones ache with need. His knees collapse under his weight and he hits the floor hard, curling down until his forehead is pressed against the floor. “Yes, Dominus.” His voice feels small, caught in the back of his throat, his lips rasping over the pile of the Persian rug.
Sherlock manages to make the simple statement of John’s name the most erotic thing John has heard in lifetimes. It helps of course that Sherlock looks ruined, his suit jacket hopelessly wrinkled and pushed down his shoulders, pinning his hands behind him. His shirt, admittedly one of John’s favourites (which is the only thing that stopped John from simply ripping the buttons off), a glorious dark contrast to the bright pink flush and sheen of sweat over Sherlock’s torso.
John swallows hard and nods, looking down at the bowl in his hand and remembering he is supposed to be eating.
The first thrust is almost gentle, testing John, pushing deep until he bumps against the back of John’s throat. John swallows hard, fighting his gag reflex, feeling his face redden. Murray’s hands come up to cup John’s head, pulling him down until John’s forgotten to try to breathe.
John wakes up, all at once and panicking, a sudden gasp for air and a flinch before he curls back on himself. The clothing he’d chosen for himself yesterday wound tight and binding around his throat. His fingers are numb when he works at the top button of the shirt, trying to give himself space to breathe without moving more than he absolutely has to. The pressure eases from around his throat and he curls deeper into his cot.
“Wait, they haven’t been around that long! They just got here… they only just… started the war.” John feels like his brain is cotton.
“Get up.” Sharp like the crack of a whip and John is standing again almost as quickly as he had collapsed.
He tried, wherever possible to remain emotionally distant from the causes of war. To remind himself that it was generally one group of humans demanding territory or religious agreement from another group of humans. He didn’t think that he was particularly above it, just that it shouldn’t in the long run make any difference to him. despite his ulterior motive of resetting his life, he allowed himself some level of camaraderie with his fellow soldiers.
He looks down at himself, only now realizing his attempt to exercise is obvious in every wrinkle of his robe. “Sorry.”
The Dominus slides his hand down and cups the head of John’s cock, his hand loose, just giving John something to push into and bump against. John wants to scream, might
John’s eyes roll slightly back in his head when the Dominus adjusts the collar of his shirt, the backs of the Dominus’ knuckles pressing against his throat for an instant.
John consciously stops breathing, holding his breath as long as he can before hauling in a long sharp gasp through the small space Murray’s hand allows. If he’s not breathing he’s not moaning… and that’s fucking fantastic, because when he’s not moaning Murray fucks him harder than ever. He’s raw from last night, and it fucking
She reaches out to take the dishes from him. “That’s a good boy. If you need anything in the mean time, don’t shout. The house system will let me know.”
John uses his free hand to make sure the button is actually sewn on before pulling his fingers out and spreading his legs further for Murray. “Use the rest of that on your cock, or you’re fetching my rations for me… actually I think you
He turns away from the mirror and climbs onto his bed, crawling up to the headboard and planting his hands on the metal frame, holding tight until his knuckles turn white. His tentacles don’t need his conscious control to roam over his body, to wrap around his wrists and the headboard until he doesn’t have to hold on anymore, until his head can drop between his shoulders and seeking tendrils can find his lips and push inside.
John puts the plate down on the coffee table, next to a bowl of apples that make his mouth water. Toast first, if he keeps that down he can ask about fruit. The first bite is crunchy and scrapes against the inside of his mouth.
“Yes, Dominus.” John watches the Dominus move around the room, gathering items and putting them in the pockets of his overcoat. His movements are quick and sharp, nothing like the predator John’s been confronted with the last two times he’s been in this room. Still dangerous… but not… hungry. “Dominus, if I may, what am I supposed to do?”
It shouldn’t shock Sherlock as much as it does when she kills him, shouldn’t surprise her as much as it does when Sherlock shows John what she is. The three of them could have been perfect together.
The Dominus is so quiet, and John panics for a moment, thinking perhaps he is disappointing, that he isn’t doing enough, that the Dominus is looking down on him with a sneer and anger in his eyes.
John drops the bag and moves to defend himself, breaking the hold Murray has on his shoulders and pushing back, sliding his foot between Murray’s and hooking around Murray’s ankle to try and pull him down. Murray shifts his balance and pushes forward against John, shoving them both through the doorway. John manages to land a solid left, but then he’s caught and pressed into the door. His left arm twisted up behind him and his nose and mouth full of the smell of old wood and varnish.
Maybe it is the wine, but Sherlock blushes, just a hint of red in his cheeks, and spilling down his neck.
“Yeah… fucking suck them.” Murray curls his fingers and shoves them into John’s mouth. “Fuck… dirty fucking whore. I should share you… put you on your knees and make you suck Gregson’s cock while I fuck you.”
He scrubs his hands over his face, rubbing at his temples and his hairline. He’s going to stay, he’ll stay and watch Sherlock grow old. Do everything in his power to make sure Sherlock dies, old and wrinkled and peaceful. He’ll watch it all happen, there is nothing else he can do now.
The Dominus looks him over and nods, then spins on his heel and stalks across his sitting room, picking up an overcoat from the back of his chair. “There’s shoes and a jacket, but no hats.” The Dominus scowls, as though the idea of head wear offends him. “Can I trust you with a scarf?”
but I did...” Sherlock is impatient, needing to see John. He wants to stand, pull the paper from John’s hands and demand the answers. Demand to
“You’d like that, maybe I should keep you for myself then. You’d be a good boy, just for me, wouldn’t you Watson?”
John leans over, meeting Sherlock’s eyes for the first time since this began, eyes fully dark green, roiling emerald fire where once there had been a gentle gaze. “That’s still forgetting about
Nothing has changed... well… Sherlock has forgotten that… or at least he is willing to go along with their comfortable fiction.
John falls into his ownbed that night with a sigh of contentment and a sense of bone deep happiness. He can do this. He can be the flatmate of Sherlock Holmes, the blogger and the crack shot, the friend and the medic that stitches him up. That can be enough.
John hums as Sherlock’s come fills his mouth, Sherlock’s cock twitching, body spasming as John holds him down, bracing his arms against Sherlock’s thighs to pin him on the sofa.
The Dominus’ pale hands move to unbutton his suit jacket. “Come in.” The Dominus turns on his heel, leaving John to rise and follow of his own volition.
Murray arrives before the first grey light of dawn has a chance to brighten the window of John’s borrowed classroom. John lets him in and relocks the door before dropping his trousers and kicking them in Murray’s direction. “Did you find lube, too?”
Murray drops John’s left leg and reaches down, pinching John’s nipple through the thin cotton of his t-shirt, enough pain that everything lights up and John comes, upper body contracting around the point of contact.
He’d given up trying to actually keep Sherlock out of his room because every lock he installed seemed only challenge to Sherlock.
Which leaves John staring at the way Murray’s hands move when he talks and wondering what they would feel like wrapped around his neck, around the back of his head, pushing John down onto his cock, holding John’s head still while Murray fucks into his mouth.
“No, they’ve been here the entire time. Mostly they are human. And it is debatable that they ‘started’ the war. Anyway, pharmacology owes most of its advances to Dominii trying to make synthetic neurochemicals to solve the whole ‘blood sucking vampire’ problem. It works mostly, but there is something missing, and if they are on synths for too long they get… well they get mean. Sherlock has been on synths for most of the time I’ve known him.”
When John comes it starts in his toes, follows through the pressure in his thighs, tacky against the leather chair and the fine wool of the Dominus’ trousers. The tips of his fingers dig, uncontrolled into the Dominus’ shirt, clutching and pulling close, even as his mouth stutters apologies. “
“No… oh no. I have work to do. This place doesn’t keep itself tidy. Try not to worry, he’s… it isn’t as bad as all that.”
“Yeah, you do. But it is like being addicted to the addiction, not the drug.” He closes his eyes. “It is the best thing… I’ve ever felt. I can’t describe it.” He takes another long swig of his coffee.
So he calls Mrs. Hudson, because he is a coward… or maybe just to be sure he’ll be welcomed back. And she confirms that
The Dominus holds the door open and gestures broadly for John to enter. The room is very nearly the opposite of what John expected. Books strewn on every surface, dark woods and leather and the faint smell of cigarette smoke.
are always two sizes too large.” Sherlock wonders how these women can hope to have any claim on John at all, when they can’t even make an
Sherlock sags into the sofa, boneless and relaxed. John catches the side of his head and lowers him gently onto the pillow, manhandles him slowly out of his trousers and pants and lifts his legs onto the couch, trying to arrange his limbs in something like a comfortable sleeping position.
“John.” Sherlock clears his throat and sets down his wine glass. “It… normally this sort of thing is beneath me… but I’ve been informed that it can be…” He fidgets with his unused desert spoon. “It has been a year, nearly… I’m told… since our first case… and of course it’s base sentiment.” It really shouldn’t be possible to pause so much and still speak as quickly as Sherlock does, as though the words are causing him pain and he wants to get them out, or maybe keep them in. “Mrs. Hudson has suggested that we celebrate.”
The cock that slips between his lips isn’t fully hard, John suck on it reflexively, habit pulling his lips down over his teeth. The temptation is there, in the dark to imagine that this… this isn’t what is happening. That he’s back in burned out buildings with his unit, fighting a war he will eventually lose. Easier still because he’s never actually seen the Dominus naked, can’t picture the pale skin under the Dominus’ clothing.
John lets the babble of the news wash over him, carrying him through until lunch, with only a tiny corner of his mind paying attention to the time display in the corner of the screen. As promised Mrs. Hudson arrives with another bowl, this time containing salad, with an excellent vinaigrette.
“Use one of the ones off the pockets, you’re never going to find it in this mess.” John drops back down onto his doss bag, propping himself against the wall to watch Murray work. “Hurry up or we’ll miss breakfast.” John wants to make sure Murray has time to fix John’s trousers and get in a proper fuck before the ration packs get handed out just after sunrise.
John dry swallows the pill, then downs the rest of the tea to clear his mouth. “See you at lunch then?”
John nods at her and turns his attention to the bowl. He hasn’t seen fresh fruit in longer than he cares to think about, he tries to savour it but ends up bolting it, pausing only long enough to sip tea to ease the food down. He pushes the last bit of banana onto his spoon, trying to tell himself that if he asked for another bowl she would bring him one, that he doesn’t need to worry about when or where or how his next meal will appear.
“What… have Lestrade round for another drugs bust?” John smiles as he says it, feeling around the edges of the conversation they are
John stares at his hands for a moment, remembering how Sherlock had felt in his grip, and then he raises his left hand to his mouth and licks between his first two fingers. The scent and taste of Sherlock is faint but its there, and before John knows what he is doing he’s sucking hard on his fingers and trying to get himself out of this clothes with his right hand.
John remembers his own mug and sips at it, eyes closing in pleasure as the caffeine hits his blood stream. “Mmm. This is good.”
, the things I want though, Sherlock... they aren’t... I can’t just take them.” John’s feet shift, the first bodily motion he’s made so far, an abortive attempt to bolt perhaps. “I’m a third generation descendant of... well the Ancient Ones. With most people it is easy to blend in, they actively aren’t looking for anything different about me. They decide not to believe in monsters, and ignore anything that... disagrees with that.”
But then there is Mary, perfect beautiful Mary. The lies she tells and the mystery of her. She’s just exactly like John, and she
John would like to blame the whiskey, the way the fire light danced over Murray’s features and or the complete lack of anything like a shag in the last three weeks. The truth of it though is that Murray has the sort of casual sexuality that John finds irresistible. Murray knows that he looks absolutely, painfully, gorgeous in his kit, knows that he doesn’t have to wiggle his hips and throw glances over his shoulder to have half the unit salivating over him. Just quietly goes about his day.
John’s head slips to the side as Murray crushes him into the corner, pushing deep and hard until he has to gather John up and pull him back across the floor and into Murray’s lap. John groans and Murray slaps his hand hard over John’s mouth. The edge of Murray’s pinkie finger presses against John’s nostrils.
He’s already turned the corner when he hears the door to the dining hall bang shut again. Doesn’t really even think about it, just finds an open door and toes it open. They’d cleared the building, but there was no point barging into a room and waking someone up.
The fingers in his arse close, but twist and thrust faster than before. John groans at each brush over his prostate. The moment when his body tips over from pain into pleasure is palatable, his head drops between his shoulders.
“I believe the term is situational homosexual. You aren’t actually making any effort to maintain a relationship with your... women. You merely want to be seen to be making the effort. If I believed in any of that drivel the argument could be made that we are soul mates. Perfect for each other in every regard. The gentials are secondary to that, surely?”
He tilts his head and lets her clip the chain onto his collar, the tiny lock snapping into place. He pulls away from the wall before he can stop himself and is brought up short by the tight feeling around his neck. He slides his knees closer to the wall and closes his eyes, willing himself calm even as his fists clench inside the robe. He can do this, he’d known what it would mean when he’d signed on. They’d explained it to him. It might be either a quick, pleasant death, or it could be years and years of… well years of being used as a food source on a regular basis.
She had walked all the way from Camberwell in spite of the wind and rain; her cheeks were flushed and her eyes bright from the exercise. She entered our lodgings with cheerful familiarity, for she had called upon us frequently since the resolution of her case. Seeing our client, however, she stopped short with a courteous apology for her intrusion; Mrs. Jennings, who had at first frowned at the interruption, appeared mollified. The news Miss Morstan had to communicate was as delightful as its bearer: my assistant had informed her that my two afternoon patients had cancelled their appointments: I might therefore spend the rest of the day at my leisure. I thanked her warmly for her trouble, and promised to call upon her as soon as I was able. With a nod to Holmes and a smile at me, she withdrew from the room.
less important to me than the knowledge that I loved this man, and that he loved me. That was the one clear answer, whatever else we had feigned or fallen into or simply tried on for a while. Of course, I might not have been quite so philosophical, had I not continued to hope.
John takes a few deep breaths. Talking about Sholto with Sherlock is having an odd effect on him. It’s awkward as hell, but also somehow…liberating. Maybe Sherlock is right: maybe normal friends would have had this conversation years ago.
None of this, in itself, is worthy of remark: it is not unheard of for a woman of wealth and connections to marry a poorer man. However, I also ascertained – and here you must forgive my indelicacy - that you did not care for him. You will recall that I asked you about your wedding. It was plain to me from your manner of speaking that the memory was a source of aggravation rather than pleasure to you. I also noted, as it is my profession to note, that your… preferences in a partner… lay in another direction.”
“I hardly know.” He rose to his feet, and walked restlessly towards the window. “At this hour yesterday, you were planning to leave me for Mary Morstan. You had known
“I’m sure that it’s merely a question of practice,” I said, compelled to reassure him. He answered only with a shrug, so I laid down my book and moved to join him upon the sofa. “What have you attempted? Show me.”
“That is undoubtedly true,” Holmes acknowledged. “However, I believe that there is more to this than meets the eye. If you truly wish for me to help you and, by extension, Miss Warrens, you will need to confide in me. Both Watson and I give our solemn promise that nothing you say will ever leave this room.”
“I do have some experience in this area,” I persisted, warming to the theme. “My knowledge of women extends over many nations…”
“Okay,” John agrees, hoarsely. “But can you just… can you kiss me again before we start?” And Sherlock obliges, kissing him keenly and deeply, keeping their lower bodies apart until John is half hard and pressing instinctively towards him.
“That was incredible,” John says at last, struggling to find adequate words through the haze. “I mean… I should be embarrassed, really. I haven’t come that quickly since I was a teenager. But no one has ever…
Sherlock huffs, but makes no reply. John carefully extracts a fragment of metal from his thumb pad and douses the cut with saline. “This one will need stitches too, I’m afraid.”
We spent several minutes rehearsing variations upon his opening gambit, then identified some topics of conversation appropriate for a plumber and a housemaid upon their first meeting. Holmes consented, with only token reluctance, to run some dialogue, and now it was my turn to be self-conscious: I have never claimed to be able to act, and had no wish to make a fool of myself by attempting to imitate the tone or manners of a girl. The best I could do was to infuse more animation than usual into my voice, and remind myself of the very good cause that this was all in aid of.
“No, indeed,” I replied, startled. “I will spend the day here, and assist you with the case, if you have no objection.”
“You clearly have some ethical concerns,” Sherlock says slowly, “but the main issue here is that you’re not interested in the idea of sex with a hypothetical male partner, however attractive he might hypothetically be.”
At first I scarcely dared to breathe, lest he should recollect where he was and move away. Desire, hope and doubt had assailed me in such rapid succession that I felt raw, and half inclined to resent the man for being so damnably enigmatic! Yet, far though it was from the kind of intimacy I had briefly envisaged, the domesticity of our arrangement touched a deeper chord. It reminded me of evenings I had spent with Mary, who used to lie with me just so upon our sofa. Holmes had once walked in and surprised us thus; I wondered, now, whether he had chosen his position with the circumstance in mind. Hesitantly, I slipped my fingers back into his hair; immediately, his eyes flickered upwards to meet mine, and he smiled. I returned the smile, my heart lightening.
“The truth is, madam, that my friend is an arrogant fellow,” I remarked in a cheerful tone. “He is accustomed to seeing ladies, and indeed gentlemen, fall at his feet if he so much as bats an eyelid in their direction. Your immunity to his charms was a perplexing mystery and a blow to his ego. When he observed your very natural response to the beautiful young lady who called upon us a few minutes later, I am sure it was a tremendous relief to him in every respect.”
and a bottle of good wine. We had not waited above five minutes, however, when a small, wiry gentleman entered the room, peering about him expectantly with dark, beady eyes. Holmes gave a start of recognition: the gentleman was Mr. Turpin, a private detective with whom he had been obliged to collaborate on a recent case of forgery, and whom he had charitably described as a “bungling fool.” Holmes immediately raised the menu to conceal his face: a wise precaution, as it turned out, for Turpin was soon headed in our direction. I assumed that he, too, would seat himself in one of the alcoves, but to my surprise he approached Jennings instead, drawing up a chair at his table. This, then, was the mysterious ‘T.’ whom Jennings had come to meet! This, the well-kept mistress! I could not help but smile at the incongruity.
Instinctively, I shook the hand he offered, then cast my eye over his disguise. A plumber had been called to our lodgings the day before, to repair a leaking faucet, and Holmes had recreated every detail of his appearance, from the spanner in his shirt pocket to the water stains upon his boots. He even wore a well-trimmed goatee beard. In terms of authenticity, the ensemble was flawless. Given the task in hand, however, I thought that it left something to be desired. The real plumber, upon whom it was modelled, had been a phlegmatic, dull sort of chap, with no advantage of face or figure.
My throat constricted at this admission, although I was certain that any regret, except as far as it pertained to the case, was on my side alone.
“It’s comfortable. Thank you,” Sherlock says, his voice pitched low. And then, without further hesitation, they both lean in until their lips touch.
I could not repress an admiring smile at this speech, although my friend had delivered it in a weary monotone, with little of his usual flair. Our client, on the other hand, appeared nonplussed, although she readily confirmed his supposition.
We lay panting, cheek to cheek, tight in each other’s arms. I ran my fingers through his sweat-damp hair, and pressed my lips to his temple.
I had not led a sheltered life. I had served in the army, and witnessed many things that I did not speak of on my return to London society. Inversion, however, was a matter to which I had given but cursory thought. I had considered it to be the result of a misdirected animal passion: man humping man as one goat might ride upon another, for no reason other than propinquity. The notion that genuine attraction, or, indeed, feelings of a more tender nature, might lie behind the act, was wholly new to me. Once it had taken root in my mind, it ceased to shock and began to intrigue me.
John speeds up a little, keeping as much contact between them as he can and willing Sherlock not to panic. He’s slick with sweat now as well as lube, but the angle is perfect. Sherlock’s breath stutters, and a moment later John feels the force of his orgasm everywhere they touch. He’s hardly even aware of his own physical pleasure: it's subsumed by his overwhelming desire to draw the moment out forever, and to feel every inch of Sherlock’s trembling body against his. Even once Sherlock relaxes completely, sinking into the mattress with an exhausted sigh, John can’t bring himself to let him go. But he pulls back slightly to look at him: Sherlock’s pale face is flushed and his hair is in disarray, his lips swollen and parted. His eyes focus on John with an expression of awe and confusion, and a vulnerability that makes John’s chest ache.
The next morning, I confess that I rose several hours later than was my custom. On leaving the restaurant, I had succeeded in catching up with Holmes before many minutes had elapsed, and we had followed Jennings as far as Chancery Lane. Although I was unsure of the purpose of our expedition, I had the greatest faith in Holmes’ sagacity, and was more than content to wait, pressed close beside him in the dark space between two gas lamps, while Jennings entered his office (with Turpin’s brown folder tucked under his arm) and exited (without the folder) a short while later. Holmes had then picked the lock and searched the building while I stood guard outside. When he emerged, his coat was bulging with what appeared to be an entire shelf’s worth of stolen files. I immediately relieved him of the heavier items, despite the fact that he refused to enlighten me as to their content, and we roamed the street until we could find a hansom cab to take us home.
“We do indeed,” Holmes replied, with an amused glance at me. “But I fear that it will not be to your liking. You asked us to prove that your husband is unfaithful to you. Our investigation last night revealed evidence of a rather different nature.”
“Can this truly surprise you, after all the cases that we have worked together?” Holmes asked me, with affectionate exasperation. “A blackmailer, especially one so obviously fond of high living, is extremely unlikely to confine himself to one victim. Fortunately, Mr. Jennings has only recently branched out: we would otherwise have had great difficulty in transporting the requisite evidence last night.”
A moment later our client’s husband, Mr. Christopher Jennings, emerged from the house. He was a little shorter than Holmes, but must have doubled him in weight; the ample coat that he wore was tight about his midriff. Like his wife, he was fashionably dressed and almost excessively well groomed, the curl of his moustache clearly the product of intensive labour. Passing onto the street, he glanced about him, straightened his cuffs, then set off in the direction of Oxford Street.
Sweaty, sticky and exhausted as he is, John kisses Sherlock so hard that neither of them can breathe.
“I have told you that I am never precipitate in my actions,” he continued, still addressing the ground. “I needed to be certain.”
He raised an eyebrow, and leaned back in his chair. “Very well,” he replied, after a moment’s consideration. “In that case, it is an offer that I cannot refuse. We shall begin this evening, when you return from your rounds.”
He paused, holding his breath, as I curled my hand against the nape of his neck. This time, I rubbed light, tentative circles against his bare skin. “Agatha insists…?”
“Why ever not? I’ve been told that it’s perfectly normal for close friends to discuss their sexual experiences, man-to-man.”
Holmes put down his glass and regarded me pensively. “Now we come to the point, Watson. Neither of them is happy, and only one mistaken.”
His fingers brushed mine as he handed me the trinket; while I pretended to examine it, he leaned in closer, his hand resting lightly upon my arm. “It complements that beautiful dress of yours,” he murmured, his lips against my ear.
I hoped that he would elaborate, but in this, as so often, I was disappointed. He merely smiled and took up his violin, commencing an energetic sonata that forestalled any further questioning on my part. “We shall need our wits about us tonight, my dear Watson. We are treading upon delicate ground.”
If you liked the UST at breakfast, all credit to my beta Emma Ockham for suggesting the scene. A huge THANK YOU to her, and to everyone who has left comments and kudos. Your encouragement keeps me writing.
The truth was that I had, myself, experienced physical appreciation towards other men. I had had close male friends for whom I would have laid down my life in an instant. For a former commander I had felt an admiration that bordered upon infatuation. Yet any indication that such feelings might take me beyond the realm of friendship, or any desire on my part to express them through sexual acts, I had dismissed as a momentary lapse in judgement. It only now occurred to me that this attraction had been equally poignant, and not substantially different in nature, to that which I had ever felt towards women.
It was not, however, the aftereffects of our jaunt around London, nor the lateness of our return to Baker Street, that led to my tardiness the next morning. Rather, I had had some considerable difficulty in sleeping. The case was foremost in my mind and, in the silence of my bedchamber, my thoughts returned to Mrs. Jennings and her lover with unsettling persistence.
So some other bloke was going as his boyfriend, then. Of course I had questions. Mostly: Who? And also: What would he be doing with Sherlock at the nightclub? (to catch the blackmailer, I mean). How convincing would their cover need to be? I didn’t like the idea of Sherlock having to do anything that made him uncomfortable.
“I’m glad you think so.” His tone was dry, but he tugged at his shirt with uncharacteristic self-consciousness. I smiled in encouragement, but he turned away to peer out of the window at the darkening street.
“The last time I walked out with her, we spent a full hour debating whether the esteemed Lady Alicia Malcom really is having an affair with her footman.”
“I am not referring to sexual intimacy,” he added quickly, divining my thoughts. “However, something more than the polite offer of my arm is required. Agatha is more forward with me, and will become suspicious if I do not reciprocate.”
You’ll think I’m a bit of a shit for doing that. You might be right, though there are some things I can’t tell you – extenuating circumstances, as it were. Let’s just say that Mary and I were both different people, when we fell in love. I’ll still be part of her life, and still be a father to our baby girl, but I told her I needed Sherlock more. She cried a bit, but said she’d been expecting this to happen since the day Sherlock got shot. That was kind of a turning point for me as well.
After dinner, Holmes took up his Stradivarius, and I settled into my armchair with rising anticipation. When he can be persuaded to play, rather than sawing over the bridge and fingerboard like a recalcitrant schoolboy, I would not trade my seat for the prime place in any concert hall in London. As he swept his bow experimentally across the open strings, I allowed myself, more fully than ever, to appreciate the lean grace of his body: its lines and curves – so different from a woman’s - and the delicate precision of his movements. His music, however, soon drew me in, and then even desire was forgotten. Holmes played Bach as if he were alone upon a cathedral spire; he played Mendelssohn as though a hundred-piece orchestra were at his back, lending thunder to his crescendos and carving rough contours above which his melody could soar. There was no artifice in his performance, and he held nothing back. I did not realise how I was staring at him until the last notes had died away and he had dropped his gaze to his instrument, apparently disconcerted by my silence.
“They were inconclusive,” he answered, jaw clenched, and then all at once his stormy eyes were full upon mine. “If you must know, I received the impression that you were less strongly attracted to Miss Morstan than you were to
Sherlock’s lips twitch upwards. “It’s fortunate, then, that I’m practically ambidextrous.” And he raises his uninjured left hand and trails the tips his fingers gently down John’s cheek.
“So I suggest,” Sherlock continues, undeterred, “that to start with you have sex with a man you know and like. Preferably someone who’s interested in conducting his own experiment in parallel to yours, so there’s no question of anyone being
I am certain that he heard me, but he did not react at all; his posture was rigid and forbidding, his eyes still fixed on the flames. With a touch of desperation, I continued: “Yesterday, when you were observing Mrs. Jennings and Miss Morstan, you also looked at me: why?”
“Their intimacy will always be overshadowed by threats,” I conceded. “But your intervention has given them some agency and a great deal of hope. For
As my vision cleared, I saw that his face was strained; his eyes were tight shut, his hand still moving between us. I pulled his arm away and replaced his fingers with my own, cherishing the firmness of his prick within my hand, and the strange new intimacy of the touch. I stroked him slowly; his breathing hitched and his body trembled. “I love you,” I murmured, tightening my grip and moving slightly faster. “Did I ever tell you that?”
“I intend to introduce myself to Agatha – that is, the housemaid – as she returns from Hampstead market tomorrow morning,” he said. “From what I have observed of her interactions thus far, I believe that self-assurance bordering on arrogance is the quality most appealing to her in a suitor.”
suggests that a profession of eternal devotion and, perhaps, one chaste kiss upon the lips, would be fitting in such a moment.”
“What else would it be?” His tone implied that the question was both ludicrous and mildly offensive. “I must remove Lady Blackwell’s letters from Milverton’s house. A flirtation with his housemaid is the safest plan that I can conceive to obtain information on the layout of Appledore, and the habits of its occupants.”
be like, potentially, with a man he loved, was a revelation to me. And I thought about all the times we’d been on the brink of that – him and me. We weren’t a couple, so we’d never been all over each other like that, but still: after cases sometimes, when we’d sprinted halfway across London, we’d stand close together as we caught our breath, and smile at each other exactly like that in the flashing blue lights, as if we were the only two people in the world.
“I told you this morning that something unusual about Mrs. Jennings had caught my attention. Had you forgotten?”
He shrugged. “As I said, the case was simple enough. And, for the rest, I merely obeyed my own sense of justice. On reflection, I found that I was more willing to condone infidelity and indecency than blackmail. I am glad that you agree.”
“No, wait!” John exclaims. “Let’s get this straight. Um… unintended irony, there.” He takes a few deep breaths. “We’ve only been sleeping together for what, half an hour?”
Now, I know I’m a bit past my prime, and I’m married and a father and all that, but really I don’t feel much different from the “confirmed bachelor” John Watson who spent his free time running round London with Sherlock Holmes, catching criminals. And back then, almost everyone who knew us (and quite a few who didn’t) assumed that we were at it like rabbits. So I didn’t understand why he thought I couldn’t pass for his boyfriend for one evening, and I made the mistake of asking him to explain.
“That is not true!” I exclaimed, deeply stung. “Can you really believe that I would hold you so cheaply, or risk our friendship upon a whim?”
I’d never seen him act that well either. Sherlock, who goes stiff as a board if you do so much as hug him, was practically melting against Victor! It was so much more convincing than with Janine. And Victor was giving back as good as he got. I was close to intervening at one point - he was getting quite possessive! He had his hands in all sorts of places. But it was impossible not to see how good they looked together. It wasn’t all for show, on either side. You could tell they had a history.
“Very well,” he said, rising to his feet in indication that this strange interrogation had concluded. “I shall be happy to look into this affair. Call here at the same hour tomorrow, if you please, for a report of our progress."
Holmes and I stood together at the window for several minutes after our client and her lover had disappeared from sight. The street below us was crowded in spite of the gloom: hansoms splashed through the mud, the breath of the horses mingling with the fog, and cloaked and shivering pedestrians darted like shadows beneath the gas lamps. Our warm, bright lodgings were as if a world apart, existing for us alone. The very walls were steeped with our history: the soft contentment of quiet evenings spent together, the thrill of our shared adventures, the glow and spark of a fast-forged friendship.
Surprised, Sherlock reaches over and passes him the bottles from the bedside table. John warms the lube in his hands then spreads it generously over both of them. His cock is already tingling again, just at the thought of what he’s about to do.
“I consider sentiment to be a defect which detracts from the ability to reason,” he responded, coolly. “My distaste has, thus far, extended to all forms of romantic entanglement.”
He cleared his throat, and returned his gaze to the text. “I am gathering information on how to court a woman.”
“I heard no nightmares,” he continued, ignoring my feeble assertion. “Nor were you in pain, for your movements are free enough. Nor do I believe that toting cumbersome paperwork around Holborn yesterday evening inflamed your passions to the point of disturbing your sleep.”
“From the moment we met, I have wanted more from you,” he said hesitantly, after a pause. “I cannot understand it; you are an anomaly in my life. I have wanted you to be more than a fellow lodger, more than a colleague and, now, more than a friend. And I want to be more to
Mrs. Jennings nodded. “My family would certainly have broken all ties with me,” she said, wiping her eyes with her handkerchief. “My mother has always suspected that there is something unusual in my attractions. She made it very clear to me how relieved she was that I had taken a husband, even one so far beneath me in station. I tried to make the best of it; I thought that through marriage, Christopher and I could both obtain something that we needed. But he became tyrannical: dropping hints of all he knew to my disadvantage, extorting ever increasing sums of money, and finally forbidding me to visit my dear Joanna. It was she who persuaded me to consult you, risk though it was, in the hope that we might gain some leverage to counter his.”
When I was intimate with women, their response to me, and the pleasure that I could bring them, interested me more than my own completion. With Holmes, whose every word and gesture had long been my obsession, the fascination was acute. I took his balls in my hand and gently rubbed and squeezed him, pressing hot kisses to his prick. His hips jerked uncontrollably and he moaned my name. Steadying him with my free hand, I took his length into my mouth and watched, mesmerised, as the tension shifted throughout his body: his face slackening, stomach clenching, hips straining towards me. A few experimental twists of my tongue had him writhing beneath me. He was close to the edge: too close for me to tease him, so I hollowed my cheeks and slipped my other hand downwards to press against his perineum. With a startled cry, he climaxed into my mouth, leaving me choking and spluttering like the novice that I was.
me like you just did.” He takes Sherlock’s hand and kisses it, tasting his own come on Sherlock’s fingers. A fierce, indefinable emotion is churning in his chest. “There’s no limit to what you can do.”
A warm wave of pleasure rocks his groin, and he comes hard. Sherlock shifts closer to him and strokes him through it, then runs his hand slowly back up to rest on John’s collar bone. They lie in silence for a while, both breathing heavily.
“Agatha is an incurable romantic, not unlike you.” His grimace was half-hearted at best. “She believes it is a case of sentiment run wild.”
Looking back upon that evening, I can still recall the sense of surreality that pervaded the lesson from that point. Holmes-as-Escott proved to be a witty, resourceful conversationalist, and a smooth-tongued flatterer, as he honed his skills upon me. With practice, his performance became more polished, but what rendered it compelling, to my eyes at least, were those tantalising slips into awkwardness or idiosyncrasy, which made him appear most like himself. In such moments, I could almost imagine how it would be if Holmes himself were this attentive, this admiring, this open with me. I knew that it was nothing but role play on both sides, yet the insidious charm of it drew me in, in spite of myself.
Mrs. Jennings gave an exclamation of concern and hurried to the window. “Oh, indeed! I told her that I would return within twenty minutes. How I must have worried her!” She hastily gathered up her cloak and hat. “You will excuse me, gentlemen? We will discuss the alternatives that you have presented to me, and return tomorrow to consult with you further.”
Never let it be supposed that Sherlock Holmes, when committed to a case, will leave a single stone unturned in his efforts to resolve it. Over the following days we barely saw each other, for he spent almost every free hour in Hampstead. Whenever we did coincide in our lodgings, however, we continued to touch.
. If I could first become habituated to flirtatious touches, I might better be able to initiate such myself.”
“I’m aware of that John,” Sherlock replies, seriously. “But I do think that framing this encounter as an experiment will help to manage expectations. Both you and… your test subject are aware that there are three possible outcomes. If you both dislike the sex, nothing changes. If one of you enjoys it and the other does not, that’s unfortunate, but it’s a possibility that you’re both prepared for. No surprises, minimal embarrassment, no recriminations. And thirdly, you might both enjoy it. In that case…” Sherlock hesitates for a moment, “… in that case you might consider entering into a sexual relationship. And/or a romantic one.”
He turned at last to face me, and looked so much his usual self – sharp and self-contained, if somewhat agitated – that I could scarcely believe what had just occurred. My racing heart stumbled with the momentary dread that I had, once again, been carried away by our play acting. Yet, there was something in his voice that convinced me the situation was as complicated for him as it had become for me. I straightened my shoulders, and attempted a smile.
“Right,” John says finally. He looks back down at their joined hands. “It’s not like I haven’t thought about that, once or twice,” he admits, his heart pounding against his ribs. “But – you probably already know this - there’s an emotional side to sex. When two people sleep together, things tend to change between them. And a lot of the time it turns out badly.”
“I have seen these symptoms before,” came the languid reply. “Oscillation upon the pavement always means that romantic sentiment is in play. She would like advice, but is not sure if the matter is too sensitive for communication. We shall likely be treated to a tale in the same style, replete with false beginnings, blushing disavowals and delicate euphemisms. But as she has now summoned the courage to announce her presence, I suppose we must receive her.”
“Ah, Watson,” Holmes sighed. “In so many matters you are my moral compass, but in this I must risk offending your sensibilities. It is a subject which I
The room temperature seems to have risen several degrees. John feels distinctly hot under the collar. He suddenly becomes aware of how close together they are sitting: when he looks up, Sherlock’s face is only inches away. He looks quickly back down at Sherlock’s injured hand, which he is cradling in his, and the heat creeps into his cheeks.
Returning to character, I took the arm he offered, and we walked the few paces up and down the room together.
“No, no, that’s fine. Sorry.” John clears his throat, licks his lips. “Fine. It’s just… ambitious, for one evening,” - and now he can’t carry on another second without making sure that the ‘hypothetical male partner’ is off the table - “...especially if my test subject has injured his hand.”
“Only one: Joanna Warrens, my maid of honour.” Mrs. Jennings pursed her lips, then added, with some asperity, “I assume that there is a purpose to these questions?”
The case of Mrs. Sabrina Jennings did not, at first, appear to be anything out of the ordinary. From the window of 221B Baker Street, where I had just taken luncheon with my friend and fellow-lodger Sherlock Holmes, I perceived a fashionably dressed young lady lingering indecisively on the pavement outside our door. She took a step forward, paused, turned away, and then returned with a resolute air, only to still her hand the moment she touched our bell pull. My curiosity was aroused, but when I described the scene to Holmes he did not take the trouble to rise from his chair, or even to open his eyes.
“I am aware of it,” I remarked, stiffly. “But I would not expect to encounter the affliction in a respectable woman.”
I met Victor by chance when he dropped by to discuss the case with Sherlock. I’d been visiting Sherlock a lot that week for one reason or another, and so I happened to be at 221b when he came. It seems that he and Sherlock got together in their fourth year after Sherlock was bitten by Victor’s pet snake (while trying to extract its venom, no less). I can’t believe Sherlock never told me this! They “had some good times together” (Victor’s words, not Sherlock’s), split amicably and have been in touch on and off ever since. They seemed to be on very good terms.
He was standing by the window, head bent and brow furrowed as he assembled some scientific apparatus of his own devising. I had watched him thus countless times before, admiring his ingenuity and the focused enthusiasm with which he worked. Now, however, I noticed also what a striking figure he cut. My eyes lingered on his high cheekbones and slender waist, and followed the deft movements of his fingers over the glassware. My mouth was dry, my own fingers twitched, and the newspaper lay forgotten in my lap.
The afternoon sun had long since been smothered by a greying mist, and the room was chilly, although I had scarcely noticed it until that moment. I scraped together the coals in the fireplace, then took several pages from Turpin’s report and tore them vindictively into strips before setting the whole lot ablaze. I believe that all three of us felt the warmer and the brighter for it: we smiled at each other like mischievous children as the flames rose and the sparks crackled against the chimneypiece.
“I would advise you not to go home in the meantime,” Holmes cautioned. “I endeavoured to conceal the absence of these files with empty covers and blank paper from an adjacent office, but your husband may already have noticed that they are gone.”
“I cannot allow you to look into these,” he warned our client. “The reports concern others who are in an equally unfortunate situation to yourself. However, there is sufficient material here for me to ensure, with the help of a contact of ours at Scotland Yard, your husband’s conviction for blackmail and extortion. He is but a petty criminal: he would spend two years in prison, and would afterwards no doubt exact his revenge upon you and yours. The alternative is that you use the threat of conviction as the leverage that you have spoken of: an incentive for him to cease his interference in your affairs and, if so much can be achieved, his interference in the affairs of others. In this, too, I will engage to assist you as far as I am able. I place the decision in your hands.”
Sherlock’s experiments are often noisy, messy or otherwise unpleasant, but to be fair he generally has them under control. This evening proves an exception: a loud crack, followed by a yelp of pain, brings John running downstairs to the kitchen, where he finds his flatmate surveying the smoking ruins of his attempt to accelerate the ageing of stainless steel. The cheese grater has shattered, and several pieces of it are now embedded in Sherlock’s hand. “Stupid!” is Sherlock’s only comment, with an expression of profound self-disgust, and then, holding out his bleeding hand: “John, would you mind?”
“Well, what are you aiming for?” I persisted. “Should it be romantic? Passionate? Forceful? Sensuous? Seductive?”
A final THANK YOU to my beta Emma Ockham for all her help and patience with this chapter. Thank you also to RosiePaw, JonDoe, Hope_Austen, GlamPixie, emmybm15 and inthewind101 for their encouraging comments, and to everyone else who has read and kudoed this story. I’m thrilled that you enjoyed it!
Had I not registered the almost imperceptible frown that creased his forehead, I would have dismissed the matter as a joke. As it was, I set down my medical bag and seated myself - hat, coat and all - in the armchair opposite him.
? All his experience gleaned from short-term relationships with women seems irrelevant when faced with this man who’s become the undisputed centre of his universe. The second possible outcome of their experiment is suddenly foremost in his mind. He desires Sherlock – can’t believe he ever doubted that – but what if Sherlock doesn’t, or can’t, desire him?
Jennings leafed rapidly through the contents. “I see little of interest here. You did not attempt to discover what occurred
John bites his lip. “Maybe it’s not necessary, but it is kind of the best bit...” Unable to resist, he traces his fingers gently down Sherlock’s side. “Look, this is an experiment, right? And it’s just you and me. If I do something that feels good, you could try just letting go and seeing where it takes you. And if you don’t want to, that’s fine too. I’ll stop whenever you tell me to.”
Then they lie down, and Sherlock starts to touch John, one-handed, everywhere except for his groin. His touch is exploratory; he varies between the tips of his fingers and the palm of his hand, his tongue, lips and teeth, changing the pressure and the pace. It’s odd, and not entirely erotic, but rather intense. Unused to lying back passively, John rests his hand on Sherlock’s arm, feeling the muscles flex as Sherlock moves over him. He looks into his eyes - narrowed with concentration as Sherlock tests his reactions - and feels a slow, prickling arousal at being the focus of that fierce intelligence and attention.
John lies back down so that they’re face to face. “You saw how out of control I was when you touched me,” he says slowly. “There’s not really a right or a wrong way to respond to… you know. Sex. But if you try to think your way through it, you might not enjoy it so much.”
I don’t know how much Sherlock deduced about the other patrons at the club that night, but I certainly didn’t pay them much attention. And I probably blew Sherlock’s cover while I was at it, too, because to be honest I just couldn’t take my eyes off him.
He regarded me curiously. “Yesterday evening, when I first mentioned the possibility of homosexual attraction, your response was one of disbelief and distaste.”
“Yes, but this is beyond the call of duty,” Sherlock insists. “You’ve already spent nine hours at the clinic today, with no time to take a break. You’ve treated coughs and colds, hemorrhoids, angina, two vomiting babies and an obnoxious child with a red lollipop. You
For the record: I’ve only put on four pounds since my marriage! And the bags under my eyes are no bigger than they were before. And lipstick on my cheek, baby vomit in my hair and an “assortment of minor injuries from domestic D.I.Y. projects” can all be washed off or covered up! But Sherlock was having none of it. He seemed rather amused that I was arguing with him: “You really are a fascinating case study in the power of reverse psychology, John. Suppose I’d
It was more of a battle than a kiss. Holmes plainly had no idea what he was doing, nor desire to stop and learn. I struggled for a better angle, digging my fingers into his shoulder blades as he clutched at my shirt. “
motive that I am concerned with. Did you not observe anything extraordinary in her behaviour just now?”
“It would do little good for us to stand around and discuss the theory,” I persisted, with more confidence than I felt, dropping my arms to my sides, palms open. “Come, my dear fellow, we have agreed to this. You must practice: go ahead. Pretend that I am she.”
" I have related the substance of the following events, so I will not repeat them in their entirety here. To return briefly, however, to the subject of evasions in my narrative: I believed, when I wrote the tale, that my style of writing was sober and restrained, yet rereading it never fails to set my blood racing. I cannot help but wonder, in complete accord with Holmes, how my readers can fail to
I can’t even remember what I said to him then! My heart was pounding so hard that I felt dizzy. It’s all a bit of a blur. I think it was something mundane, along the lines of “have you eaten?” or “can I move back in?” And he didn’t answer: just sat there, staring at me. So I took a few steps towards him, and he stood up and came towards me and…
He stared down at me, pupils blown wide, for a full two seconds before he understood my question, then he pulled me once more to my feet, running restless hands over my sides, as though he were physically unable to stop touching me.
“I assure you that ‘the affliction’, as you term it, is not confined to the male population, the lower classes, or indeed to any other faction of society,” Holmes answered, sharply. “Is that your only thought on the matter?”
Only the partner of Sherlock Holmes could be required, within five brief minutes, to descend from the heights of passion to the seeking out of rubber-soled tennis shoes and the fabrication of black silk masks. Upon reflection it seems strange, even to me, but such is the life that we share. We had no time to lose, for the evening was already advanced and the storm abating. Sooner than I would have thought possible, we were seated in a cab bound for Hampstead.
Jennings had watched Turpin’s approach with an eager, almost covetous, expression on his face. “You have the evidence?” he asked, in lieu of a greeting.
He compressed his lips into a tight line. “Even if I could, Watson, I believe I lack the ability to express affection in such a way.”
Holmes and I both started in surprise, seasoned campaigners though we were. The very walls seemed to shake, and the gas lamps guttered, sending the shadows reeling. We gazed at each other for a moment, wide-eyed, then he chuckled, and pushed himself up onto one elbow. More slowly I followed suit, my gaze lingering on his tousled hair, swollen lips, and crumpled plumber’s outfit. I could not help but smile. His lips twitched in response, but his eyes were already drawn to the window, and his expression hardened with a new resolve.
“That was remarkable,” I said at last, my voice regrettably unsteady. “You have a talent for observation.”
We remained upon the sofa for the best part of an hour, during which time the newspaper was thoroughly dissected by Holmes, and shuffled about distractedly by me. He then moved to his workspace, to resume an experiment on the adhesive properties of beeswax. Interpreting his silence as an invitation, I seated myself at his elbow, to write up some notes on a recent case. I made a point of consulting him frequently as I did so, passing him my pages with a deliberate brush of our fingers and, to my delight, he began to respond in kind, leaning in so that his shoulder nudged mine as he mixed and measured. Our progress was tentative – perhaps strangely so, given the beginning we had made – but by the time our dinner was served at a quarter past six, we were sitting with our ankles entwined beneath the table, and his hand upon my knee.
“I shall be glad to do so,” she declared, “for the fewer words we must squander on this sorry affair, the better for us all. I believe that my husband is unfaithful to me, and I wish for proof.”
“Very well.” There was now a distinct trace of mockery in Jennings’ voice. “I must bow to your superior comprehension of the feminine psyche. You have convinced me that a restless yearning for female companionship is
This request, I was certain, would be the last straw for Holmes, who in general despises surveillance work unless it affords ample scope for deduction as well as observation. I believe he was on the point of refusing the case when a diversion occurred: the young lady whom I was courting, Miss Mary Morstan, entered the room.
John scowls and leans back against the sink. He’s trapped. There’s no way to evade Sherlock’s scrutiny until he’s finished treating his hand. And telling Sherlock that this is none of his business will be about as effective as shoring up a sandcastle against the incoming tide. He tries it anyway: “Look, I’d rather not talk about this, okay?”
,” I remarked, eying the weighty tomes he had discarded upon the table. “But Holmes, such tales are hardly… Would not real-life experience be a better guide?”
“Milverton’s butler,” he clarified, with a smile. “I have also won the heart of Milverton’s cook and several of the footmen. When the ill effects of a broken water pipe are exacerbated by a rainstorm, and the kitchens ankle deep in sludge, a skilled workman such as Escott is more welcome than a bevy of sentimental swains.”
John nods dazedly, and picks up the tweezers again. Now, his hands are not so steady. He is achingly aware of every part of his body that’s touching Sherlock’s: his ankle, his knee, his hand… Unable to help himself, he runs his fingers up Sherlock’s wrist to his pulse point. Topping 100 beats per minute. Jumping at his touch…
We did not move again beyond small gestures, such as a caress of the shoulder in passing, or an arm about the waist as we sat close together upon the sofa. Holmes initiated the contact as often as I. At times it was awkward; at others, I caught my breath at how natural it felt to interact with him in this way. We did not discuss it. In truth, I preferred not to question what might happen once the case was resolved and my “instruction” no longer required.
A thrill passed through me at this unexpected opening; my heart leapt against my ribs. “Not at all,” I said quickly, holding his gaze, “for it is perfectly true.”
All at once, the silence between us was too intense: it magnified every rustle of our clothing, and every thud of my heart. I ran my hand experimentally down his arm from shoulder to wrist; he remained silent and motionless throughout. Were it not for the rapid twitch and leap of his carotid pulse, he might have passed for a monument to stony indifference.
“Oh, for God’s sake, John!” Sherlock huffs, grabbing John’s hand and placing in unceremoniously on his half-hard cock. “You’ll never know unless you try.”
, in a way I hadn’t seen him look for a very long time. It always melts my heart a bit when he drops his mask and shows some human feeling. Just seeing what he
Mrs. Jennings made an indeterminate sound, halfway between a laugh and a sob, and buried her face in her hands. It took several moments for her to regain her composure; when she looked up, however, her colour had returned, and there was the trace of a smile about her lips. “I see that I can conceal nothing,” she said. “Forgive me for not confiding in you from the beginning: you will surely understand my reasons. This is a matter about which I have only ever dared to speak to one other soul, before you. Yes, I love a woman. Your acceptance of the fact is a most wonderful relief.”
His smile turned wry. “Whom indeed? I fear that I may shock you. We never talk of such matters. But you must, surely, be aware of the phenomenon of homosexual attraction?”
“Screw scientific rigour,” John agrees, giddy and ecstatic and completely unable to stop smiling. “Only with you. And…um… that includes the part about the relationship, if that’s what you want.”
“Then I do not very well see what is to be done,” I mused. “The husband is the wronged party, after all. He will surely persist in gathering evidence until he has created a scandal.”
The sight was so incongruous that I burst out laughing. He looked up, startled, but did not appear in the least embarrassed by his occupation.
from the table. He divided the pages between us in the usual way: sports and politics for me, the front page and agony columns for himself. Then he settled back down upon the sofa to read it, with his feet against the armrest, and his head resting in my lap.
“I suppose you could say I had a crush on him,” he says, his eyes firmly fixed on the tweezers. “When I found out he was interested in me I was flattered. And I thought perhaps… But then when we tried, when it came down to it, it just felt wrong and I couldn’t really…I wasn’t… “. His bravado failing abruptly, he makes a vague downward gesture and leaves Sherlock to fill in the blanks. “So anyway, I learned my lesson. End of story.”
Dr. Watson was, I believe, distracted at the time, but I paid close attention to your husband’s transaction with Turpin yesterday evening. He paid him a mere two pounds. This, for seven days and seven nights of work! Turpin generally charges three times the amount. Such a discount could only ever be offered to a favoured client, from whom he has received, or hopes to receive, a great deal of extra business.”
(Although he also thinks that about the reproductive cycle of blowflies, so I shouldn’t get too carried away about that one…).
“It’s completely different,” I choked, fighting back the longing that this simple touch engendered. Holmes was no enticing stranger, but rather the most important person in my life. He was romantically inexperienced, he despised sentiment, and our ‘flirtation’ was a mere charade! Yet, despite all this, I could no longer deny that I desired precisely those intimacies with him that I had sought with my previous lovers. “I mean to say, it is not different at all.”
“You will gain nothing by boring yourself and the girl half to death,” I countered, half-laughing at his vehemence. “Every remark should invite her interest, or signal your own. If she mentions the cold, you could offer her your jacket. Or imply that, in her presence, you feel agreeably warm. Selecting the appropriate degree of subtlety is an art in itself.”
“Not…directly…” he gasped, and I felt a childish satisfaction at having once more rendered him inarticulate. “You… merely said that I… ah!” I bent my head and touched my lips to the salty tip of his prick, and he flung his arm across his face.
I leaned against the mantel and closed my eyes. “In my younger days, I did. I had quite a reputation for it.”
That friendship now demanded perfect openness between us. Any attempt to conceal my sentiments from Holmes would be futile and, worse still, craven. Had I felt half as much for any woman, I would not have hesitated to declare myself. But yet, how dauntingly strange it would be, to thus address my closest friend! I had no experience with this; no notion of the words or the actions required. I had no reason to hope that I could ever be more to him than I was now.
“Do you often resort to such tricks in order to attract women?” he asked companionably, as though unaware of my discomfort. “I had not observed you to behave in such a manner before.”
“It was, in the end, a very simple affair,” Holmes replied. “The difficulty will lie in exploiting what we have learned to bring about a satisfactory resolution. You will first wish to consult with Miss Warrens, who has, I believe, been waiting for you on the street corner this past half hour.”
ask me to kiss her,” he muttered in the direction of his boots. “I did not realise until this morning that I could extract the information I needed in any other way.”
“Come,” he said, “I shall endeavour to earn your confidence. Your brief visit yesterday provided me with information that piqued my interest in your case. Firstly, it was evident that the wealth of your family exceeds that of your husband’s. Your maiden name matches the letter ‘H.’ engraved in the heirlooms you are wearing; it is also a name that I have frequently encountered in the society section of the London newspapers. As regards your husband, I have a professional knowledge of his law firm, and am aware that it was on the verge of bankruptcy five years ago, before it was saved by an injection of funds, corresponding to the date of your marriage.
I bit my lip, and clasped my hands tightly behind my back, as a thrill of anticipation coiled in my chest. I waited.
“You will not constantly be comparing me with Miss Morstan?” he asked, cutting through the blissful haze.
“Relax your face,” I instructed him, taking a moment to compose my own. “Now smile at me – just so – and let the smile fade, except in your eyes.”
“Stop that,” I said, without thinking, catching his wrist and pressing a kiss to his racing pulse. “Let me.”
It all started when a friend of ours from Scotland Yard mentioned (over a beer) that Sherlock was going undercover at some high-end nightclub. Apparently several of the patrons had been targeted by a blackmailer. Not something Sherlock would normally be interested in (although I think it’s safe to say he’s not fond of blackmailers!), but quite a lot of money was involved. And possibly the P.A. to a minor official in the British government. I’m sure Sherlock had his reasons for taking the case.
Sherlock assured me that my concern was unnecessary: he’d be working with an old acquaintance from university. A bloke called Victor. Maybe it was the name, but my mind instantly conjured up a picture of some Oxbridge Adonis – single, early thirties, athletic, as tall as Sherlock perhaps, with dark, shoulder-length hair. As it turned out, that wasn’t far off the mark.
“He was your commanding officer. You admired him very much…” Sherlock begins, his sing-song inflection indicating that he’s prompting John to continue the tale.
Sherlock fixes him with the unblinking, analytical gaze he generally directs at tobacco ash. John does his best to meet that gaze defiantly, because this is absolutely
“But I was oblivious to their interest,” I countered, shaking my head. “Such interactions lack in substance. I find them ultimately unsatisfying. If I cannot have again what I had with Mary, I would rather do without.”
Sherlock’s eyes widen. “John, of course I’m serious! I’ve wanted to marry you since the day I saw you proposing to someone else - though I realise that’s not good and I probably shouldn’t say it. I know sex is important to you, so I had to see if that side of things could work between us, hence this whole “experiment” - which, incidentally, has been something of a paradigm shift. But this isn’t about sex for me, and it certainly isn’t about idle curiosity. You said…
“That’s what I was going to say!” Sherlock sounds almost indignant, although his smile tells a different story. “You know I can’t say it back to you now. Rhetorically it would have no impact whatsoever.”
John looks down at him, trying to calm his own racing thoughts. He feels shocked himself, and guilty and slightly hurt. But then he remembers Sherlock’s involuntary groan and the twitch of his body, and has a glimmer of understanding. “When I touched you, it made you react in a way you didn’t expect – is that it?”
“That was my motivation for taking your case,” Holmes replied. “I surmised as much during the course of your first visit, and was convinced that I could be of service to you, although perhaps not in the manner that you had supposed. Your scheme was conceived out of desperation, and was very unlikely to succeed. Even if your husband had been unfaithful, you could scarcely threaten him with exposure on that account, given that his evidence against you was of far longer standing.”
“That is a pity,” I remarked. “Applied to one’s own concerns, such powers must be infinitely more valuable. Many would-be lovers would give their right arm for the ability to gauge the state of another person’s affections.”
“Don’t worry: Victor went home,” he said (just slightly bitterly?) as I walked in, but then his eyes flicked over my face and down to my bare ring finger, and he went very still.
I had always been aware that Holmes cut a fine figure. Given our situation as fellow lodgers, however, and his professed distaste for sentiment of any kind, I had taken pains to suppress the excess of my admiration, for I had no wish to torment myself, or to risk our friendship, by nursing an attraction that I knew he would disdain. This approach had worked well enough thus far; obliged now, however, to evaluate the effect of his appearance upon a potential conquest, my eyes lingered on those features that the adjustments to his costume now accentuated: his pale throat, his elegant wrists, and the muscular curve of his hips. Heat prickled beneath my collar, and I cleared my throat.
There is something in his tone that unsettles John. In fact, Sherlock has deliberately steered the whole conversation into awkward territory. Not for the first time, John wishes he had the foggiest what the man is driving at. “I… don’t have a problem with people being gay, Sherlock,” he says, cautiously.
Yet, even the potent mix of post-coital and post-case euphoria could not protect us indefinitely against the cold. At length we began the long trudge home, and a silence fell between us that was not precisely uncomfortable, but unsatisfying nonetheless. There were matters that we had failed to discuss. The conclusion of the case could just as easily signify the end of a chapter as a new beginning. I could find no easy way to broach the subject; it is extraordinary how men can leap fearlessly into mortal danger, yet cower at the prospect of a heart-to-heart.
“This is not your usual choice of reading material,” I remarked, when no explanation seemed forthcoming.
“Yeah. What’s with the flattery? I’m not going to give up and send you to hospital, if that’s what you’re worried about.”
My hands were on his belt buckle before I recollected his inexperience. “Should I…. I’m sorry. Is this too much?”
“Sofa,” he gasped, and we stumbled backwards, fumbling at each other’s belts and buttons. He fell hard onto the cushions and I fell with him, my trousers around my knees.
“And so on, and so forth,” he muttered, dismissing a legion of unspoken inanities with an impatient sweep of his hand. “For heaven’s sake, Watson, let us pass over the obligatory small talk, or we shall exhaust my stock of patience before I’ve begun!”
“No!” Sherlock pants, seeming to recover himself. “No, that was good. Don’t stop.” He lies down again and grabs John’s hand, but John resists.
“When enjoying the touch of one’s beloved, some distraction of thought is only proper,” I retorted, keeping my tone light.
, as you put it. For instance: someone who has previously been uninterested in sex but would consider attempting it with you.”
“Her motives are just as underhand as mine,” Holmes continued, quickly. “She hopes to prompt my rival into a declaration, and believes that the sight of me kissing her will arouse in him the requisite jealousy and possessiveness.”
John gives a startled laugh, and tries to shake off his uncharacteristic uncertainty. This is only Sherlock, after all, and whatever pedestal you place him on, he refuses to stay there for more than a minute. “I’m getting there,” he promises. “Just give me a moment.”
“God, yes!” John exclaims with a thrill of triumph, and stands up quickly, pulling Sherlock with him.
So that’s it, then. One of the longest blog entries I’ve ever written (Ella will be proud). I’m not sure if I’ll actually post it, though. It’ll need a better title. “The Besotted Blogger” was Sherlock’s suggestion (the prick!) after he read that last part. But he was smiling as he said it. Radiantly. :-)
With a look of surprise, he complied, refastening the cuffs about his elbows. At my further suggestion, he undid his top button, tucked his shirttails into his belt and, following a brief dispute on the relative merits of authenticity and aesthetic appeal, exchanged his ample trousers for a more snugly fitting pair. As a final touch, we arranged his hair so that one dark curl fell artlessly across his forehead. I then stood back to inspect our handiwork, with what I hoped would pass for disinterested approval.
John looks up incredulously, but Sherlock appears to be perfectly serious. Disconcerted, John returns his attention to Sherlock’s hand, holding it steady as he positions the needle. He places the stitches quickly and neatly, but is increasingly aware of Sherlock’s gaze fixed on him as he works. The silence seems a little intense now, and he breaks it without thinking: “I’ll take these out in a week or so. Don’t try to do it yourself. And if you see any signs of infection in the meantime, you need to let me know. Redness, swelling…”
“I have a few things on my mind,” I began awkwardly, after a moment. “Holmes, what is your true opinion of my relationship with Miss Morstan?”
We had embraced before, notably on the day of my ill-fated marriage, but we had never done so alone in the intimacy of our apartment, with no other claim upon our attention than the patter of rain against the window panes, and the soft chime of the mantel clock. Pulling him closer, and feeling him relax against me, soothed tensions that had plagued me for longer than I could remember. It was like stepping in from the winter cold to a warm fire and a glass of mulled wine.
When I finally emerged from my chambers, I thought it wisest to suppress the insights of the night until I had leisure to consider them further. Anxious that no change in my manner should betray me to Holmes, I occupied myself with my toast and marmalade for rather longer than my appetite required, and retreated behind a newspaper as soon as breakfast was over. The human imagination, however, has a perverse will of its own. My thoughts strayed irresistibly towards Holmes, and, before many minutes had elapsed, my eyes were likewise drawn in his direction.
“I fear the contrary,” he returned gallantly, before inclining his face towards mine and murmuring: “Your cravat has been straightened since this morning. You did not do it yourself: the knot is tighter than you prefer. This was the work of your first admirer. Your second was more circumspect: in her ploy to approach you, she pretended to examine your watch. The nervous perspiration from her index finger left a smudge upon the glass - here.”
He laughed. “Never fear. Even I am not such a perfectionist. I believe that we can safely rely upon the incompetence of our friends at Scotland Yard.”
that I choose, whatever the outcome of this conversation,” I murmured, raising his hand to my lips. “Say something, Holmes,
Holmes gestured for me to wait, then darted into the restaurant himself. A minute later, he was beckoning to me from the window: he had succeeded in procuring us a table in an alcove not six feet away from the place where Mr. Jennings was now seated. Careful not to glance in that direction, I hastened to join my friend, who was smiling in evident satisfaction at his skillful management of the affair.
A gust of wind rattled at the windows, and lightning flickered through the charged air. Taking a deep breath, I placed my hands upon his shoulders.
“Concentrate, John.” Sherlock sounds amused but also… turned on? John has never heard that particular tone of voice from him before. He makes a valiant effort, focuses his wandering attention, and tends to the remaining cuts as thoroughly and gently as he’s able. After the longest ten minutes of his life, he positions the gauze and applies two bandages, wrapping them slowly around Sherlock’s fingers until most of his hand is encased.
of it, despite their years of intimacy - makes his heart beat faster. Then Sherlock cards his fingers through John’s hair, and John responds in kind by opening his mouth and slipping his tongue between Sherlock’s lips, smiling at his gasp of surprise. He runs his hands experimentally down Sherlock’s back, caressing him through his shirt as their tongues press together, and feels the familiar tug of lust in his stomach and groin, stronger and headier than he’s felt it in years. This is working… it’s more than working… and please God let Sherlock be feeling this too!
“The experiment will need to cover a range of activities,” Sherlock says, quickly and tonelessly. “I’ve attempted to sort them in ascending order of intimacy, although I’m aware that this is subject to debate. First: close physical proximity; second: kissing and caressing; third: hand jobs; fourth: frottage; fifth: blow jobs; sixth: anal intercourse.”
“You should know my methods by now,” Holmes chided, his cut-glass accent softening to a pleasant southern county drawl. “Allow me to introduce William Escott, the co-founder of a thriving plumbing business in Highgate.”
Pleasant though it was, her short visit would not be worth recording, were it not for the rather extraordinary change that it produced in Holmes. He sat up straighter in his chair, and stilled the restless motion of his fingers against the armrest. His gaze became intense and searching, focused first upon Mrs. Jennings and then, briefly and disconcertingly, upon me.
He exhaled sharply and closed his eyes. An instant later, however, all traces of reluctance vanished from his face. He squared his shoulders, sank his hands into his pockets and assumed an air of jaunty confidence. A few paces away from me he stooped, as if to pick something up from the ground. When he straightened, a small pearl bracelet was dangling from his fingers.
John gapes at him. “No, I didn’t! We only…” He breaks off, narrowing his eyes. “Oh. You utter prick! You just said that so I’d contradict you.”
I did not trust my voice to make an immediate reply. Instead, I closed the curtains and moved towards my armchair. Holmes followed, and we seated ourselves at opposite sides of the fireplace. We had sat together in this way countless times before. The familiarity of the scene went some small way towards steadying my nerves.
“I take your point, dear boy, but what other options do I have? Practical instruction is hard to come by. I suppose that I could recruit a streetwalker for the purpose.”
“I do not wish to make you uncomfortable,” he murmured, his thumb caressing my wrist. “This must be very different from your interactions with women.”
He makes a surprisingly good job of it considering that he can use only one hand. John moves help him, but his eagerness – or Sherlock’s proximity – makes him clumsy at undoing the buttons bottom-up and backwards. Finally Sherlock bats his hands away – “Do your own!” – and they both start laughing.
I’ve got nothing against Victor (why should I?), but I wasn’t sure we could trust him. And I doubted he’d be much use to Sherlock in a fight or with a gun. So I suggested that maybe I should go along too, as back-up. Sherlock pointed out that this would defeat the object: it would be no use him blending into the crowd if I were there too, busy “skulking about in a jumper and scowling at Victor”. He also pointed out that a blackmailer who was trying to take compromising photos of the nightclub patrons without anyone noticing would hardly resort to fist fights or firearms. But I just had to make sure that Sherlock would be okay, so I offered to put product in my hair (don’t you dare laugh!), wear the sharpest get-up Sherlock could find for me, and sit unobtrusively at the bar keeping an eye on things. Surprisingly, Sherlock agreed to this.
He seized my hips and arched up against me, and we both groaned at the aching pleasure of the contact. His head dropped back and I buried my face into the crook of his neck, kissing him, tasting his skin, desperate to be closer. I wanted him so badly that words failed me; even actions barely sufficed. I rocked my hips against his; he answered my rhythm, and then the world stood still: there was nothing but the strain and tremble of my muscles, and the piercing sweetness where our bodies touched. He slipped a hand between us, aligning my erection to his, and the pleasure spiralled wildly: blinding, so intense that I could scarcely breathe until it broke over me like a flood wave, and I stifled a cry against his shoulder.
Returning home from my professional rounds one morning, I was surprised to find Holmes sprawled in his armchair, reading a novel. My surprise was all the greater when I saw the book’s cover: it featured a pirate, balanced precariously upon the bow of a ship, one arm around the waist of a singularly buxom young lady, whose expression of vacant adoration strained credulity, given her immediate danger of tumbling backwards into the waves. Holmes was evidently several chapters into the tale, and was reading with avid attention. Four more books of a similar ilk were stacked at his feet.
you raise yourself above the commonplace,” Holmes remarked, ungraciously. “Countless others have consulted me on the same question, but most of
We had come to the point without any great effort, after all. I touched his hand. “Certain of what?”
“So, you plan to share your first kiss with a woman you care nothing about, under the watchful eye of a hated rival, with the aim of inciting jealousy and extracting information to facilitate a burglary?”
The dam cracked at the sound of his voice, speaking my name. I stepped forward, heart bursting, and pressed my lips to his. He gasped, but did not pull away, and after a moment he shifted against me, angling his face to mine and returning my kiss. His lips were tender, his touch almost reverent; the intensity was such that my eyes drifted shut, even as my other senses saturated with his nearness. I stood as though dazed, inhaling his breath, cupping his cheek in my hand and feeling his rough, warm skin beneath my fingertips. I leaned against him, and relaxed into his arms as they tightened around me. This was completion; this was bliss as I had never known it. Until that morning I had not even considered it possible.
The air seemed to vanish from my lungs. This was different – formidably different - from sitting back and allowing him to practise his skills upon me. He was watching me closely, his expression guarded. Before I could second guess myself, I shifted towards him, and angled my knees so that they brushed against his.
We regarded each other in silence for a long while. Try as I might, I could not decipher his expression, but there was a hint of wistful reproach that made me instantly regret my hasty words. I also received the unaccountable impression that I had disappointed, or even wounded him. The very possibility cut me to the quick. Before I could attempt a reply, however, he dropped his gaze and added, with a shrug: “Our client has appealed to us for help. I cannot disregard her inclinations in my efforts to assist her.”
He shrugged, and tossed the book carelessly onto the table. “I’m skeptical myself about the wisdom of sporting an eye-patch during courtship, but I’m certain that I can employ a seaman’s accents and vocabulary to excellent effect.”
“Agatha did not prove to be a very reliable friend,” I remarked, after a moment’s pause. “She told you that Milverton would be sleeping at this hour.”
I was seized by the sudden urge to laugh, although it was more from surprise and embarrassment than mirth. Despite my invitation, I had not expected him to take so direct an approach. The scene was contrived, no doubt a product of his foray into romantic literature, yet it was disconcertingly effective: my pulse had quickened, and my skin tingled with awareness of his proximity. It was fortunate that his expression was less skilfully executed. He was attempting an admiring gaze, but, upon his stern features, the result was more suggestive of constipation.
“I… any of that.” His breaths were coming faster; he raised his hands distractedly to my arms before dropping them to his sides.
. We’ve danced around this question for too long, but now it is addressed and there is no concealment between us. If you want us to remain friends, I will not consider our friendship lacking. But if you want anything more, then I… I am offering.”
He looked up with a quizzical frown and, in part to cover my utter inability to finish my sentence, I crossed the room and took him into my arms.
It was a considerable relief to me when the doorbell sounded shortly after two, announcing Mrs. Jennings. I rose to my feet, but Holmes was faster: he opened the door for her, then ushered me towards the most comfortable armchair. “I fear that Dr. Watson is still feeling the effects of last night’s adventures,” he said, addressing our client. “After following your husband from the house as agreed, we did not return here until the early hours of this morning.”
He reached beneath his desk and drew out another pile of folders, neatly labelled and dated like the first.
“Excuse me, miss,” he said, reverting to that low, lilting accent peculiar to ‘Escott’. “Does this belong to you?”
“I am grateful to you both for your efforts,” Mrs. Jennings assured us perfunctorily, before adding, in unconscious imitation of her husband, “you have the evidence?”
He did not look up, but my breath caught in my throat at the sight of his smile. “None whatsoever,” he answered.
Holmes and I waited, with all the patience of bloodhounds straining at the leash, until he was a good distance ahead of us, then commenced our pursuit of him through the chilly streets of Mayfair, sometimes ducking into doorways to avoid his sight, sometimes strolling casually among our fellow pedestrians, to all appearances just two among a thousand fine gentlemen on their way to the theatre or opera house. At last, our quarry approached a certain highly priced dining establishment in Great Portland Street, consulted a gold-plated pocket watch, and walked inside.
“I confess that, since you did not explain it at the time, it made no lasting impression upon my mind.”
My final prescription signed, I made my way homeward with a flutter of anticipation beneath my sternum. It was something of a let-down, upon entering our lodgings, to find the fire lit but the sitting room empty.
I must here confess that Holmes’ expression of withering contempt at this latter speech obliged me to cover my face with my handkerchief for several minutes to smother my laughter. Holmes watched me cough and splutter, a smile tugging at his own lips. “It is not so very amusing, Watson,” he admonished. “You would not be so well entertained if you were dependent on Turpin to ‘throw light’ upon your own affairs!
