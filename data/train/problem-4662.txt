And he's using his phone while walking into the center operating space (felicity's circular space area).
He notices fog has formed on the monitor's screen from his breath because of his close proximity to it. He wipes the screen with his sleeve, and returns to look at it, his eyes widen comically, and if there was any remnants of food in his mouth they have definitely been dropped to the floor.
"you said you're feeling arousal?" - Which is probably the last thing Dean ever thought would come out of Cas' mouth. He tries not to look like a fish out of water.
"Well i was gonna say very advanced, but yeah"- Sam spends a few seconds longer gawking and geeking around the weapons until he realizes it and stands while coughing , then looks at diggle.
"Well he IS my brother. So.. "
Sam has been so happy for the wedding, in fact he's been throwing himself into helping with all the decorations and festival shit ever since he was informed of it.
The Winchesters are invited to the Queen's party.
"An article on the internet..? "
Or as sam notes in his own mind, Cas turned wild. So yeah maybe he is not as innocent as he lets on.
Could this really be what it sounds like? Did Cas have his sexual awakening infront of dean? Scratch that. Because of Dean? It seems so.
"Yes, you did propose." - Dean teases.
"Sam Winchester." - He extends his hand.
Dean didn't know what came over him. He actually... that actually came out of his mouth.
Sam is just out of the kitchen and going to isolate himself in his room as he sees his brother trail after cas like a lost puppy.
Cas is still relaxed and by now is accustomed to being criticized on his word use.
"Why are u looking at me in this dark manner? Is it its dimly colored aspect? I warned sam about this color, color of death and tragedy. But he insisted that, and i quote "black is the new beige" "  -Cas continues in a slightly annoyed tone.
"Stupid angel."
Sam watched them trade words back and forth.. dancing around the "forbidden subject" : their mutual attraction towards one another.
"What do you mean usually..? You actually went out of your angelic way, and allowed yourself a slice?"
"You said you're feeling arousal?"
"What changed now?"
He just braces himself and tries to hold all his eyerolls in. The
Later that day, they get invited to the Queen's party at Oliver's apartment, labelled friends and family.
Cas is wriggling his butt. He doesnt know how to do this , trying not to put his full weight on Dean's "fragile mortal human" body. But dean has had enough, as he impatiently tugs at cas' loosened tie and brings him down crashing their lips and bodies together.
But Cas insisted, the son of a bitch always demands more than dean's pay grade.
"You still don't get it, do you?"
"The best way to court a stubborn egoistic man, is applying these safe choking practices, it extracts the fragility out of the ego and.."
He could also feel nervous in Dean's presence. He didn't know why he felt like that, he didn't completely understand it.
hand, it's my anchor. In a way, it got me through. I knew guns were my thing, long ago, but i never really had a fascination with all these types", he says as he gestures to the table, "until i met oliver." - Diggle stops to nod at Sam that yes he can touch the collection.
I realise the title of the work sounds a lot more emotional than the contents of this chapter but it's true. A lot of angst and fluff and feels will follow in the upcoming chapters.
They stare into each other's eyes, Dean's hand still caressing the outline of every structure on Cas' face, as he stares deeply getting lost in every inch that is Cas.
And the situation turned wild.
"Cas." - Dean says again when Cas keeps trying to pull the tie tighter around Dean's neck. He rests his hand above Cas' to remove it from its place around his neck.
"Please just listen to me-"
Cas kisses him softly, gently wrapping his arms around Dean's waist.
as dean would put it.
Dean stares at him dumbfounded.
Spoiler Alert : Cas and Dean maybe try the choking thing in a little extension of the next chapter, lots of feelings ensue.❤
(See the end of the chapter for
He raised his head and was surprised he met the one very same angel right infront of him.
Dean looks at him unbelievably, raising his eyebrows "The orgy kind." - he decides to say, willing himself to just evaporate into thin air.
"I don't understand this..." - He speaks as his eyes go back and forth between his and Dean's similar conditions.
In a flash they're gone.
Dean still refused to meet his eyes.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Well.. " they start together. Sam insists john goes first.
Cas keeps his eyes on Dean waiting for more explanation.
"Well you're refusing to share your knowledge on this matter with me.
Honestly Sam can't pinpoint the exact moment that became a real thing, but he's glad it has for all the times Dean almost got away with doing dumb shit and Cas' firm voice had saved the day.
"Yeah whatever, still you cheated." - Cas says back, the word
Cas of course notices the movement.
Cas bursts out laughing. Dean  always seems to bring joy into Cas' existence in ways he never imagined he would experience.
Dean visibly relaxes but then tenses again for other reasons, as he moves his hand to grab the gun from his jacket.
"Me."
"Is that Cas' tie you're wearing? " - Sam finally says.
_________
"So what about you? Any favorite piece you work best with? " - John starts again to kill the silence.
In the next chapter, we will know exactly what was going on outside. Meaning, the POV will be shifted to Cas and Dean again.
Dean's expression is not very clear . But then suddenly Cas gets up and off of the table, dean props himself on his elbows half laying down.
e grits this last sentence through his teeth while he slams his hands on both sides of the table dean is sitting on.
Dean blushes deeply it runs along his shoulders and he can feel the blush creep onto his chest. While Cas standing there wearing that jacket isn't helping the fire he feels in his body.
John has his arms crossed against his chest.
"Shouldn't you be worrying about why are you in this situation? I mean... I'm.. I know who I am. I can be overly sexual relying on these things to relieve myself from my constantly stressful lifestyle..I'm a man with so many fetishes. Some of them weirder than others.." - Dean explains as he looks at his hands, the walls, anywhere but Cas' piercing eyes, that are looking right at him.
"I'm losing my shit here." - Dean finally speaks trying to calm his voice.
Cas isn't annoyed with Dean because he didn't say it back. He knows it's hard for him to talk about his feelings.
Even then, in the silence of the impala, he could read dean, he could
Cas' eyes were piercing through him and he never felt more vulnerable.
Sam nods and scratches his nose.
Dean then moves his arm around Cas' back, pushing him down till cas squishes dean entirely.
Dean was so scared, of everything in that moment. But he decided to run with it. And not fight it. He wasn't even sure if he coould actually fight it if he wanted to. Was cas using it to control him?
Emotions are good. But for Dean, not so much, yeah he'd start feeling tingley and that lightness that comes when Cas is staring at him with the most appreciative stare, almost admiring, that goes straight to his heart, with no detoursof guilt whatsoever. Reminding him that he can still
Sam runs quicker so he doesnt have to hear more sinfulness come out of the angel's mouth, he bumps into someone,  nearly spills her drink.
Sam thought he was having the time of his life. But he completely lost it when cas strikes with his last question. Sam has to give it to him, this is the most awkward question Cas had ever asked. And considering it's Cas, that's pretty wild.
Dean huffs, goes around to grab a bottle of whisky and perches himself on top of the table taking a long swig from the liquor.
"No, it is not a danger situation." - Cas says.
Diggle smiles at him from where he is standing and continues.
Dean's eyes widen and his dick reacts immediately where Cas feels it between them.
Cas moves towards him and starts stroking his hair , and caressing his cheek.
But then Cas just stood there and kept looking at dean
Sam doesn't understand it since Cas is supposed to be an angel that doesn't relate to human traditions and cultures, but seems like his time on earth has changed him in more ways than one.
"Yeah.. uh that.." - Dean says as he chugs a relatively huge gulp of the beer he almost forgot he's carrying.
Sam took the opportunity and went quickly to the kitchen and grabbed himself a beer and whatever plate of leftovers he could reach from the fridge and ran back through the bunker to reach the library before they say anything out of earshot.
He feels admired, appreciated even. He knows for sure angels are dicks so it's not just about Cas being an angel, that it's like his duty to make people feel, whatever the hell Dean was feeling or whatever bullshit. This is personal.
Even sitting among the other pieces, all black, and some looking even more similar by design, John still saw each piece differently - "Realised soon enough that calling a gun
"Dean" - it was not urgent even a bit, it was pateint but there. Demanding something. What was Cas demanding.
"He trusted me to cover his back, I'm not trained by the league of assassins,  nor the bratva, but i promised myself to make myself useful as much as humanly possible,  in my field at least." - John stops to grab a gun closer to the other end of the table.
"First of all, that's not a proper use for the word. It's not called cheating."
Cas looks thoroughly at Dean his expression changing to frustration and slight anger.
But he still can't believe it that's why.
Dean obviously looks more surprised than sam.
"Oh god, I'm so sorry"
"Are u sure you don't want this? "
He could feel Cas' hand spread out on his cheek, engulfing the right side of his face, his thumb collecting the wetness left under Dean's eye.
"Don't pity the broken"- Dean said trying his most convincing sarcastic voice, his voice broke at the last word.
"It's true sam. I believe you should know that He's not even here."- Cas says , his voice more collected but loud enough.
"I am not controlling you, Dean"
I hope you enjoyed, :).
Poor dean is probably having an internal crisis right now.
"Well, fuck"
At this moment, Cas was lost in Dean's eyes, green with a hint of extreme care and empathy, for those he loves. He could feel Dean unintentionally speaking through that stare, more than he ever held in conversation.
Dean knew the moment Cas' hand left his jaw, the angel would flutter his wings away- away from Dean.
But emotions for Dean, also mean he'll have to deal with the first time he killed a monster. His heart sank back then, but his dad said it's the right thing so he forced himself not to feel anything while killing, bury the feelings so deep they don't interfere with his performance, maybe he can make his father proud.
"What's the reason?"- Cas' voice said again.
Which dean usually responds to by, very unsmoothly, extracting himself from the situation.
He felt Cas' knuckles brush his cheekbones, under his eyes, and that gentle gesture made his tears fall. Fall on the angel's hand. That hand that stilled when it felt the cold of the single tear that fell.
He thought it would just be a shocked face he'd capture on that camera that will turn to anger and come find him and "i swear to god sammy you're dead".
Now that he has experienced some human experiences, he still doesn't understand most of the things he feels or the urges that come upon him. But they're there. So he can't stare at dean as freely. There's something that makes him nervous and flustered.
The angel breaks the silence.
For the passed 2 months he's been used as a battle ground for the two men -well man and angel- and it's not that he doesn't like helping them decide on things, but it's getting tiring having to listen to them argue in front of him where his efforts to help them are totally ignored in favor for more of their active bickering.
It's not the angel attraction he's been closeting. It's his attraction to males. Sam always knew Dean wasn't strictly into girls, but never in a million years had he thought Dean would ever actually act on these types of feelings voluntarily other than the uncontrolled blush and stuttering he sometimes exhibits around certain guys when they hit on him.
Sam sighed after picking up a few books, opened one in his right hand as he started surfing the internet on his laptop with his left hand for any common conditions, or places these men went to in common.
Emotions mean remembering things from his past, that he doesn't wanna remember, like the look of disapproval his dad gave him constantly. Like when his brother left, talking trash about their lives, never once thinking how would that make Dean feel. Dean, who sacrificed everything so that his little brother could live the best life there can be in their situation.
He then starts to look inside the jacket to feel its texture experimenting it.
His doubts about castiel not being as pure and innocent as he shows started that one time when Dean told Cas :
"Dean i can sense your sexual instincts are intensified more than usual, i can um.. even see that." - Cas starts off with his usual informative tone but it falls flat on awkward at the end as his eyes linger on Dean's crotch thoughtfully.
Sam couldn't believe what's happening.
"what do you think this is?" - Dean says as he waves a hand infront of his jeans, trying to look as professional as possible.
"I think they went on a private date. They go back to his place, he cooks her one of his most famous dishes"- John smiles at the thought of his friends -  " i hope they spend a relaxing night together. It was due, they deserve some calm after this hectic week." - Diggle continues, as they are now outside where Sam is worriedly seeking the presence of the impala, maybe it would have some answers to where Dean is.
"So... where have they been all this time? The car is still here. I don't know what to think about that. There's nothing Dean could possibly do in any universe without his ca... "
Victims also showed several distinct forms of reactions to grief specific to how each person reacts. And in one case the person was strong enough to handle the trauma, they lasted 36 hours. But in all cases : Cause of death : mental incapabality to handle the trauma as its intensity increased with time.
Dean turns to him : "Uh yeah, i guess" - Dean looks down at the tie half undone around his neck, dangling down his bare chest.
Cas gives Sam the middle finger during the kiss, raising his hand  higher than is normally needed, like this is only the second time he's done it. Probably is.
Cas senses the motion in Dean's jeans and shifts a bit on top of him which makes Dean growl low in his throat at the friction.
But he's always been a curious person.
Dean's legs hang down from the opposite part of the table as if it's a normal sitting position. But that doesn't forbid Cas from climbing to the top of the table- well dean, top of dean- stradling his hips.
It made him feel like he related to someone else somehow. Be it in another universe, still kinda comforting.
"..Me.."
"What's the reason? I mean- why the suddenness of it. Is it the jacket? Maybe it reminds you of someone." - Cas says as a conclusion as if he found out the reason behind it all.
"Oh. I just wanted to ask you if you've seen Dean anywhere? Or if you know where he is? I guessed he and Cas would have went out with felicity and oliver, i thought you could tell me where they are..? "- Sam was now admiring the bow amd basket of arrows his hand moving instinctively to touch it.
But Cas' arms are holding his vessel up, trying to give Dean space to breathe.
Cas didn't have time to register Dean's body leaving the embrace as Dean crashed his lips into his in a way that still knocks the air out of Cas' lungs and yet breathes a new taste of life into him.
"Just because i know what you're thinking, does not mean i am invading your telepathic privacy Dean"
And as Cas does so,  he had to break the kiss, and yeah Cas can be a slut at heart in Sam's percpective.
"Why would i want to
"So yeah, did they tell you where they were going?" - Sam asks.
Cas looks at Dean for a second then down to where Dean is gesturing, his eyes widen as it dawns on him, his cheeks get a very faint pink color.
He lifted Dean's chin up, hand sliding to his jaw.
"We don't need angel juice to uh 'help ourselves out of it'. I certainly never needed that in my whole life."- Dean smirks and clicks tongue - "Good times." - He says as he recalls a few memories and takes a sip from his bottle.
No matter how intimidating John might look on the outside, once you start a conversation with him, you see how soft he is on the inside while he radiates deep love and care for those he considers family. And Sam saw just that in the man beside him.
Dean was paralyzed, he just sat there and stared at the angel's face half an inch away from his.
At some point later, sam comes out of a room in the arrow bunker (maybe nerd room) after finishing with whatever nerd things he was busy with or just maybe having taken a shower or whatever.
He totally forgot about that.
Castiel pauses to explain, "There are no hex bags around, and I'm certain this jacket isn't cursed, I don't understand what's happening to us." - He concludes.
His mind couldn't control itself anymore, not with the very close distance that Cas has left between them. And it's not like he could back away, the table prevents him from any backward movement eh might attempt. He'd then have to climb down the table or tell cas to give him his personal space.
He moves around the house quietly but quicky, gun in hand, scanning every corner.
"What do you mean not a danger-"- Dean starts to get up angry and on alert but Cas forces him down, still  caressing his hair again.
, his head and the upper part of his shoulders are not supported by any surface except Cas' arm as he forges Dean's body with his own and kisses dean senseless.
Sam watches as Dean swings his bottle in the direction of Castiel.
- he found himself thinking about his mom.
"No." - Cas replies in monotone.
At first, before he knew the Winchesters, before he became involved with humans, he used to stare down at Dean as long as he wanted even with the most intense stares-one would think they were devoid of any emotion, but they were rather focused on understanding this human.
By far, this is the best idea he had ever had. He smirked and covered his mouth as he laughed quietly and watched Dean squirm to his core and use his hand to rub his whole face, which Sam knows is a thing he does when he's extremely frustrated.
"Dean, if i may be honest here, all cockblockers are annoying. I would never even try that again, not even in a hundred millennia." - Cas confesses to Dean in his most annoyed voice.
chamber. It's a very complicated place , a place where he feels not only a form of desire but the emotional need to feel and do things, and no nuh uh, he is not walking down that road again. Especially not with the only family he has besides Sam -that is still alive,
And fuck personal space, Dean just wants to feel Cas hard weight on all of him- every inch of dean just needs to be held down by cas.
low in the way his mouth is moving and sam can only hear snake hisses.
He felt like he was falling from the other side of the table but Cas was supporting him. Arm strong enough to wrap around his back climbing to his neck preventing him from falling.
"Someone who loves pie that's who."- Dean says fully turning to Cas, and totally ignoring Sam's involvement.
Dean thought Cas probably feels guilty for something now, he thinks he did something wrong. And is demanding to know what happened. Demanding something Dean can't give.
"I just... know you"- Cas said and it came out very intimately heavy out of the angel's mouth.
"Well i don't know what's happening with you,
And sam swears sometimes he doubts if Cas does these things on purpose to see how Dean would react- It's priceless by the way.
"What is it? Are you also genitally uncomfortable?" - Cas says as he shifts a bit on his feet, clearly feeling how uncomfortable his pants are.
But will he have the patience to stay? And will dean have the wisdom to keep him close?
Cas and Dean encounter Sam in the kitchen of Ollie's house as they enter it, hand in hand, dean not even caring as he keeps kissing Cas everywhere he can reach.
"I apologize, I don't intend to.. pry on your private matters." - He says apologetically.
"SAMMYYYY!!" - Sam startles as he hears the call from outside. He smirks and prepares to run when the raging fireball comes for him.
"And I AM your husband. So.."- Cas counters back, imitating Dean's voice and attitude.
, but i know exactly what's happening with me." - Dean says with a slight smirk.
Suddenly Sam becomes very self aware of his hands, very tempted to cross them as well , but he doesn't wanna come off as creepy, so he ends up raising them in hesitation towards his chest then brushing his hair down and bringing them down to rest at his sides, one of them trying to find a place in his tiny front jeans pocket.(Only half of 2 fingers do, he keeps it that way).
"Something like that" - diggle smiles mischievously.
He feels himself blush and feel uncomfortable and about to puke as he thinks about it.
"So .. "
than it is sam, please try to have everything as ordinary as any human joining festivity usually is."
"Oh."
Cas feels rather than hears Dean mumble things against his skin. He's pretty sure they run a long the lines of  "let me serve pie at the wedding.. " then he starts biting Cas' clothed shoulder playfully.
"What grown up-? Oh you mean sam?? No that's not grown up.. it's just sammy." - Dean tries to flip the cards.
He jumps off the table nonetheless, getting alert.
But his mind has shut down all its quarters, except for that one chamber that is usually forced shut.
"No. Dean, you can't- This doesn't make any sense. Sam look. He wants to serve this at the wedding. Nobody serves pie at their wedding. Tell HIM sam!" - Cas gets a bit agitated but is composed for the most part.
Bobby nodded.  “I could put a call into a friend of mine.”
“Yeah, and grovel,” Dean added, edging them out of the office and toward the front door, Don following them.
“Probably.”
“Yeah.  Probably.”  Dean moved over a step, buttoning his dress shirt.  “So, you gonna be at the party tonight?”
“I’ll straighten this out!” Gabe held a placating hand up, scurrying out of his throne.  “I got this!”
And then a big thing became the breaking point.  It was rare Zachariah got physical when he was drunk, but Gabe had changed his dad’s computer password, locking him out.  In a drunken rage, he threw a book, hitting Gabe in the head.
“Oh yeah?  You still in touch with any of my exes?  Cause I sure am not!”
Sam frowned.  “What?”
Castiel looked up at his brother with a warm grin.  “Do you promise?”
“I like watching you.”
Sully stepped forward, hands lifting to hug Dean, who stepped back, cocked his head, and held a hand up with a lopsided grin.  “Whoa there, Mork from Ork.”
***************************************
He managed to duck everyone until lunch.  Not only was Kevin there, Gabe and Sam skipped a class to see him.
Her eyes tracked slowly over to Castiel’s with a look he had seen too many times in his life.  She was fading.
“Who knows how to make a casserole?” Gabe asked.
Gabe nodded.  “It was.  And you’re welcome.”
“What?” He croaked, falling the rest of the way to the floor.
Dean sat back, studying his boyfriend.  He looked excited.  Energized.  “What happened?  Why did that happen?  The call?  How did she know it was you?”
“You’re doing better, Cas.  Not so...uptight.  Tell ya what.  Next time you want to practice, you make the first move.”
Castiel pulled him through the door, through the kitchen, and down the hall to their room.  He sat the guitar in the corner.
“Water ruins lubrication,” Dean murmured along the back of his neck.  “Doesn’t stop me from sucking your dick.”
Cas gasped, spreading his knees to take more, feeling every swing and slap of his cock against his own abdomen and cried out as he came.  Shock and a wave of an erotic high flooded him as Dean hauled him back against him, stroking his cock and sucking onto the neglected side of his neck.
Castiel swallowed.  “Why did you break up?”
“Nice knee-capper you got there, Wayne,” Bobby grinned.  Mine’ll blow your whole friggin’ spine out.”
“Hey, Scooby gang,” Dean called, coming down the steps.
“Wait,” Dean stammered, laying back again as Cas continued to wipe him, then took both cloths back to the bathroom.  Dean lay there flat on his back again, staring at the damn ceiling.  “What the hell just happened?” He mumbled.
Castiel logged into the same computer and finished the few notes he needed to write for the day, then called the other RN in the facility to have her check them.  By the time he was finished, the doctor was long gone.  He went into Mrs. Golden’s room to check on her himself.
“It’s no problem, Sam.”
“Sparkle says Sonny is acting like a grown-up,” Maddie said with a note of sadness in her report.
Castiel followed Wayne around Sunset Fields.  It was not the nicest nursing home he had been in, but it was small, and the residents seemed happy enough.
Cas gave both men a doubtful look.
“Have a seat gentlemen, dinner will be ready soon!” She chimed, disappearing into what must be the kitchen door.
“Talk about freaky diabolical suspicious suspects,” Dean said tersely.
Gabe, master of tricks and joking around, froze.  He was completely caught off guard.  “Say what, now?”
“Yeah.”
Gabe glowered at his brother for turning this situation even more awkward, to which Cas glowered back for whatever reason.
Cas threw his phone out the kitchen door where it collided into the hall wall with a clattering shatter.
Dean’s tongue swept harder, sucking stronger.
Cas switched gears, opening up and gripping the bed to take all Dean could give him.  “Fill me up, Dean.  Mark me.”
“Where are they?” Castiel asked.
“You...do that,” Dean stammered as the back door opened.
“Ya know,” Dean went on quietly, “me and you were raised to fight.  Yell.  Tear each other down.  Cas and Gabe were raised differently.  They might not have yelled, but they tore each other apart and got left.  Same shit at a different volume.  All I know is, you deserve to be happy.  And I won’t let you second guess yourself and mess things up for yourself.”
“Ooo, I’m Fred,” Dean grinned.
Castiel looked mildly worried at that.
Gabe smirked.  “Let’s be sure to let him know the jig is up.”
“If I get busted for my backyard,” Bobby said, “I need you all to finish this.  There is something wrong with Charming Acres.  If I get cut short in all this, I need ta know you’ll see it through.  And keep Fred safe.”
“Four martinis coming right up!” Cindy whisked the bowl away, her dress flaring out and swishing just as jauntily as her ponytail.
“You people are fucking nuts,” Dean yelled, jerking harder on the rope as Ed approached Sam while Madge approached him, wielding a knife of her own.
“So, the coroner was in on it,” Sam clarified.
Castiel grinned, looking to his outstretched finger.  “Look at what?” He chuckled, already knowing the answer.
“That’s what we think,” Rufus said.  “Problem is, we can’t poke the beast too much.  Not with Bobby bein’ the one to call in the feds.  And the backyard.”
“I know!  But I do, ya know?  He’s been around for years.  I know about him.  His picture hangs in my bunk when I’m at sea!”
Sam chuckled deep and low, getting up to lean over him, plying his lazy tongue with a thorough kiss.  His hand reached between them, feeling his hardening cock in his boxers.
“Yeah, sure!” Sam nodded, walking out with him.  “Thanks for the...dessert.  That was really nice of you.”
“I give it two years tops.  One of them is going to kill the other one.  They are both controlling and competitive.”
Dean grinned, lacing their fingers together, pinning Cas’ hands just above his head.  He kissed him harder, hungrier.
Sam felt this on a totally new level, he never felt in a conversation before. He admired those qualities.
Cas kept massaging his head, calming him and at some point he felt like he was being petted.
He is surprised to feel Cas' hand on his cheek.
But then those eyes suddenly clouded with guilt and Dean casted his face downwards.
So he'd been forcing himself to endure it for no other reason than shock. Sam would believe if you'd told him there's been a vampire nest living under his bed and feeding off of him for the passed year, than believe that Dean actually acted on his feelings towards Cas.
"Fuck you!" - Dean shouts as he dives back in to meet Cas' lips.
And honestly, sam gets it. But seems like dean never will.
The laughter dies down, and sam waits on the guy to continue on his own, to not be forceful and invasive. After all , this is like the second time he had talked to the guy and maybe the first they talked alone. He doesn't wanna be seen as an asshole.
Dean gulped in his throat, trying to fight away the emotions surfacing. Emotions also mean, his mom. Mary winchester, he met her when she was young he dreamed of having her in his life. And just when that happens, she leaves him. The only light he had in his life was his mother, living or dead. Now that she saw him, he wasn't enough for her, of course she wouldn't like what she saw, who wants a murderer for a son.
The camera was set in a corner that captures only Dean's place so Cas' voice was the only thing telling Sam that cas is still there.
Sam at this point has an excited disbelieving huge grin, his eyes trained on dean.
But this has taken a whole different turn, he is torn between clapping dean on the shoulder, hugging him or emptying his stomach content in the toilet.
Sam heard a low voice say, it startled him and he looked around till his eyes landed on the reciever screen of the camera he set up just outside the bunker.
Cas then tightened his hold on Dean's shoulder, recalling the first time he grabbed him that left that mark in the first place.
Dean is layed down on the table. And becuase this is not a bed,
Apparently, 4 cases of brutal death, murder according to the marks left on the temples of all victims' right side of the head. But this isn't the strangest thing believe it or not, the victims' cause of death was "unusual extreme emotional trauma" accompanied with intense continuous crying for 24 hours straight, no break, which causes death due to incapability of the body to handle the trauma.
He stands clutching the table on alert. But nothing comes. A few minutes pass. But nothing happens. This is very unusual, Did something happen to Dean? Did something attack him?
He could feel Cas' head follow the movement of his hand,
Sam looks teasingly at john, only to find a face more stern than his bitch face number #32 that he gave dean when he opened his laptop one day and found all those porn videos playing with no end. He had to close 45 tabs, and install 3 types of antivirus apps afterwards. And his laptop still gltiches occasionally ever since.
"Hey, What were you saying earlier..?" - john then asks after a while. Now they're walking around the bunker, Sam silently and not so subtly appreciating the superhero suits.
That's when his hand moves to Cas' jaw, Cas breaks their heated makeout and stares at dean trying to understand him.
"Oh my god!"- Sam almost trips over because of the shock.
however, are a no guarantee.
He closes his eyes , his head bowed down as rubs at his temple then rubbing his eyes as if to will them the power to open and face reality.
But these other ones they're having now, well not that much. Their position is awful, the angle isn't right for the angel.
He went to his room to get dressed, then he went to the library and started digging through the stacks of old books trying to find a matching creature for the 4 psychotic cases that happened in Oregon.
"Well, fuck!" - Dean loses it.
And maybe just maybe, at the wedding Cas pretended he didn't see him sneak in the pie from the backdoor, and replace the cake with it.
But now he remembers he was really trying his best to stay focused on not showing or accepting his absolute fascination and respect for the righteous man- for
He needed to feel Cas against him. But it felt like there are worlds between their bodies even with Cas literally crawled on top of him, he tried to push himself up, Cas down. Nothing worked.
"Okay let's get this straight. I'm not egoistic and i don't like choking during pleasure."
Sam is lowkey bullied by destiel here😂,  but all in good faith i swear🤚🏼
Dean swats his hands away keeping it in place and pulls him in again grinning the whole time.
"Oh"- sam says as he forces himself to take his hand back. - "it's just the technology embedded in the arrow heads is very... " - his hands are hovering just above the head of an electric arrow, the closest he can get without physically touching it, turning his hand around all its edges like he's actually feeling it.
is stupid and childish,  to think i shoot best with it, or it brings good luck or whatever. Man, that's for kids.  I make every gun useful. All i need is my hand." - he finishes by putting the gun back and dragging his hand along five guns aligned in a row.
He's in the kitchen sitting at the table with his mug of green tea and a book he's been enjoying for the passed 3 days. That's where they crowd him, as they start at it again.
He looks again back up, "Is that really what you wanted to say all this time Sammy? You had that look and you were staring,  i thought i had something on my face," -then he turns to cas-  " Dammit Cas, i told you i felt smth on my face since we were in that  goddamn restaurant,  and no it isn't freckles.."
Sam suddenly feels things got too intimate for him to keep watching but he still watches anyways eyes moving impossibly closer to the screen as if that will help him hear better.
"I don't know man, they call 'em metas over there. Argus was looking into some cases a while back, i got a look at it accidentally,  but that's all about i can take. Vampires, werewolves,  sharkman, whatever, that's not the type of trouble i think about at night."
and i thought Barry Allen was crazy."
"Quit getting into my head."
Cas said nothing, his hand descended from Dean's head to his neck , to his shoulder and rested on his own handprint on Dean's skin.
Either way Dean feels it, he'll fail Cas. One thing after the other, from the smallest things to the-
Dean rolls his eyes at the angel "Yeah..
He cast his gaze downwards breaking the extremely intense eye contact where his greens met the blues of the unearthly being who was making his emotions stir.
"Uh, yeah. I did. I am."- Dean said and Sam could see the nervousness in the posture of his mouth.
Dean wanted to fucking die.
Now luckily this thing isn't only shooting, it's recording so he'll watch the whole thing from the beginning later, he promised himself.
Sam moves to stand beside Diggle, both facing the circular center of the bunker, backs to the wall behind them.
" he whispers softly as he closes the space between them again.
Dean is slammed on the hood out of nowhere,  by one particular angel : Cas.
All the bodies were dehydrated because of tears and sweat over production and even vomiting liquids out of the body, all because of deep grief. And they had bloodshot eyes, literally not figuratively.
A few moments pass, both Dean and Cas still frozen in their places. Dean is drumming his fingers against  his bottle staring frequently at Cas, while Cas in turn looks at him thoughtfully.
The kiss is almost bruising as Cas would describe it. But it always leaves him stunned and his hands clutching at Dean without his permission.
how is dean supposed to answer that without actually having to man up and face his not so innocent feelings towards cas.
Meanwhile on the monitor:
"Oww gross!" - Sam nearly shouts.
"We are not alone."- Cas explains quickly.
"I mean..I'm.. ik who i am.. i can be overly sexual relying on these things to relieve myself from my constantly stressful lifestyle.. I'm a man with so many fetishes. Some of them weirder than others.. but why you.. an angel of the lord yourself.. are having this.. now? Hmm?"
dean.
"Okay. My apologies. " - Cas says as he loosens the knot to a respectable distance from Dean's Adam's apple. And he goes on to remove it all the way.
Castiel opened his eyes seeing Dean under him, mouth open and eyes closed, his lashes spread softly across his cheeks.
They were all in eleventh grade this year.  Except Dean, Benny and Charlie, who were graduating in a few weeks.  Dean had a job already at his uncle’s garage and planned to stay to help his mom with the bills.  Charlie was starting college locally, and who knew what Benny would do.  Castiel hoped he would move.
“Nope.  I’m out.  I’m showering and going straight to bed.”
“Olivia,” Sam said, beer poised in front of his lips.
“With a guy.”
Dean chuckled.  “Damn near.  She had me down to...”
********************************************************
“Oh, you’re so damaged,” Gabe muttered, getting a glare from the mayor.
“That’s the Whittaker’s car,” Dean answered easily.
“How’s it goin’, Drexel?”
“And Ms. Dowling,” Cas grinned.
“Dean.”  Sam pointed across the room to another table.  This one held no plants.  It was covered with a black velvet cloth, a pile of jewelry on one side, cleaning tools and display boxes on the other.
Marion shook her head sadly.  “He’s trying to expand his kingdom.  It’s all about gaining treasure, with leprechauns.”
“I don’t want you to be here.”  Castiel tried not to scan the room as much as he was.  There was a shirt with blood on it.  He hated it here.  He always had.  “So...am I getting in bed with you?  Or am I dragging you out of here?”
He sat behind Dean with Sam next to him and Gabe on the other side.  They had waited a long time for this beach trip.  And the three of them got to miss two days of school for it.  A long weekend at the beach was more than any of them had since they were kids.
“Ah, Samuel,” Cas nodded.  “He was an asshole too, from what Sam tells me.”
“Yeah,” Dean admitted, sighing.
Wayne stopped just outside Goldy’s room.  “Shame about Gary.”
He pulled Castiel up to his feet and kissed him.  His mouth fought to pry its way into Castiel’s.  Unsure and knowing he was lousy at this, Castiel opened his mouth, tilting his head.  Luc’s hands smoothed down his back and cupped his ass with a moan.
“Do I need to notify her granddaughter of any changes?” Castiel asked, watching the doctor suspiciously as he stood from the chair and headed out of the square of space framed by a counter which nurses could see over to talk to residents or other staff.
“Too damn many.  The four that got me all worked up.  Now two more since Donna got to town.”
“We do what other people do,” Cindy stated matter of fact.  “We shop.  Work.  Clean.”
Dean turned to him with a grin.  “I might charge you.”
“Then you tell them you aren’t.  Come on, Cas.  What are we working on tonight?” Dean was asking.  Really asking.
“Good.”  They were staring.  Eye to eye.  Dean knew a lot.  But he didn’t know everything.  He didn’t know Castiel had been crushing on him for years.  And what the hell would he do if he found out?  At the same time, he wondered how Dean couldn’t know.  He tried to be subtle.  He tried not to stare, but damn.  Dean was...
“Goodness me!” She declared, tucking the earbuds away as she passed him brusquely to answer the door.  “Well!  What a pleasant surprise!”
Castiel’s face burned.  “I just...”
Castiel turned around, looking at Dean.
He ran his finger over the curve of his pec, collecting semen until he brought it to his own mouth, tasting him.  Dean’s brow lifted, watching him.  Rather than speak, Cas leaned down and swept his tongue across one nipple, suckling it with a swirling tongue.  Dean’s hand fisted softly in his hair as his hips rocked and he made a crooning sound.  With a naughty little giggle, he let the pearled nub of his nipple go and licked his lips.  Dean sighed in relief as his body settled back to limp and heavy.
“And miss all this?” Dean spouted.  “Nah.  We’re partiers.”
“I don’t know,” Cas grinned adorably.  “She’ll probably love you too.  Freaking...gorgeous Winchesters.  Making the rest of us schmoes look so average.”
“It was a tough case to crack.  But I finally weeded out the shapeshifters.”
“Wayne’s going inside,” Gabe reported.
“Uh, sure,” Sam nodded.  “Gabe?”
Chip looked scandalized.  “Why, Dr. Mahoney has been a good and faithful doctor in Charming Acres for years!”  His eyes narrowed at Cas.  “You, on the other hand, just floated into town and began waving insane theories around without anything to back up these allegations!”  He shook his head as if Cas were something to pity.
“It’s a show.  Animal Kingdom?” Sam shook his head, waving Dean off.  “What the hell happened to our back up?”
“He sure did!” Ed grinned, eyes twinkling.  “We like it here!”
“Hello, ladies!” Gabe called.
“You trust me?”
“Yes!  The hedge with the lovely pink flowers in Nellie’s back yard,” Madge smiled sweetly.
They both lay there, wide-eyed as they came down.
Gabe smirked in agreement.
Castiel was feeling closer and closer to hyperventilating.  Why had this subject even come up?  Damnit, Gabriel!  But still, he had to hear every word and see every reaction in the room.
Cas smiled, still panting slightly from his run.  “I know some priests.  You need one in particular?”
“Well, now we know they come out at night to play,” Dean grinned.
“So, I knock on the Carrigan’s door.  That’ll distract nosy Nellie while you muttonheads sneak in the back door.  Got it?”
Dean chuckled, probably at his ridiculous enthusiasm.  “And dinner?”
“Okay,” Fletcher said softly, still fidgeting with the cuff of Sam’s suit jacket.  “You’re dressed up fancy.”
Luc raised an eyebrow.  “I think maybe you’re just shy.”  His shoulders hunched up and his eyebrows both raised with his impish grin.  “Maybe we can just...play.”
“We’re going to talk to Don Stark,” Dean said quickly, backing out of the kitchen, Sam leaving with him.
**********************************************
Sam went inside, closing the door.  “You two are terrible.”
“Well, Sam’s freakin’ thrilled.  You know he wants you to move here, right?”
“Right?!”  Gabe got up, pushing his chair in.
Madge glared at him as she walked out of the living room to answer the door.
Dean shook his head.
Dean shook his head.  “Friggin’ suburbs, man!”
“Look who’s here,” Bobby said, patting Fred’s shoulder gently.
“I heard about Gary,” she said quietly.
“Huh,” Dean listened carefully.  “Sounds like he’s the money source.”
“Got it,” Dean grinned.
“Did she just fucking growl?” Gabe asked, about a hair’s breadth from climbing Sam like a tree.
Dean turned, sitting up.  He looked at the closed door.  “Where’s Sam?”
Castiel’s hands froze on the beach blanket he was folding.  Sam knew.  Shit.  Shitshitshit.
Chuck went along easily enough.  Tucked into the couch with a blanket and pillow, Gabe flopped onto the other couch.  “I’ll stay with ‘im.”
“What?  I freak out about shit too!”  He took a deep breath, calming himself down.  He did not need to bother Sammy with all the drama shit that floated around in his head.
Castiel sighed with relief.  “I gotta go, but...I’ll see ya later.”
Camille swallowed, eyes back to their normal size again.  “When I touched Fletcher, I had a vision.”
Sam shrugged.  “I don’t know.  He’s never gotten that serious about anyone.  I thought he and Aaron were fairly serious, but apparently not.”
“Sam,” Dean whined.
The laughter had drained into a thrill Castiel had never quite felt before.  “Damn.”
Castiel knew he wore a look of shock.  Dean met his eyes with a rather steely glare.  Castiel sighed.  This had Gabriel written all over it.
“Then Fred started losin’ his memory.  So, I came back.”
“Thanks for letting me...talk to you about this.  It all still sorta freaks me out.”  He huffed a nervous laugh.  Dean nodded his head, glancing at him, then back to what he was doing.  Dean had to think he was the slowest idiot to ever try dating.  He knew he was blushing profusely.  Why could he never stop blushing.  He better leave before he made an even bigger fool of himself.
He regretted the invention of t-shirts, wishing their bare skin was touching, but he was incredibly happy to have this.  He hugged Cas’ arms to him, kissing his forearm.  His grin widened with absolute glee when Cas left a chain of soft, little kisses on the back of his neck and just under his ear.
“Already done.  A new tox screen is being done and if it’s nightshade, the doctor said the treatment for it is easy enough.  They should both be right as rain in a day or so.”
Gabe:  Here, get a job!  You appear to have waaaaay too much time on your hands.
“I figured you could keep it for your guest bedroom or Cas or I will take it with us,” Dean went on.
“And that’s BETWEEN the holidays,” Rufus clarified.
“Oh shit,” Dean panted, two feet on the floor again.
“Never gonna marry that loopy nephew of yours,” she added.
Dean’s mouth landed on the back of his shoulder as his arms wrapped around his chest, fingers and palms sliding up his pecs only to claw back down, catching both nipples as he slid, making Cas bite his lip and groan.
Dean snorted with an incredulous look of disgust.
“Yeah?” Sam answered.
Dean glanced at him, then back to the ceiling, his body, which had begun to stiffen, relaxed again.  “Or sweetie, or any of those....things.”
“It’s a big Charming Acres welcome picnic for you and Sam!”
“And then,” Sam prompted.
“To Dean and Cas!” Gabe announced.  “Live long and prosper!  I can’t believe you’re such copy cats!”
“Fix it?” Sam repeated, stunned.
Gabe sat up with an eager gleam in his eyes.  “Tell ya what, bro, if you haven’t gone out with anyone by June 15th, I’m setting you up on a date!”
“Really?” Sam asked, heading toward him.
Dean grinned harder, looking down at him, their feet stopping automatically.  Rather than words, Dean leaned in and kissed him.
“And someone needs to get Maggie’s side of the story,” Cas added.  “I don’t know if I buy the scorned spouse bit.  It seems rather...extreme.”
“I’ll be in touch, Mr. Novak,” Wayne said.
“What are ya lookin’ for anyway?” Bobby asked.
“That man,” Goldy muttered, her head lolling to the side.  Just as Cas got her upright, an aide came rushing in to help him get her into bed.
“Just listen, Dean and I will do the questioning,” Sam said.
Hooooly shit.  Dean stared around the neighborhood as he shut Baby’s door with a semi-quiet thunk.  Sam wasn’t lying.  Idyllic was one way to put it.  Creepy was more like it.  Charming Acres was small.  One main drag with tons of little shops and required places to make a town a town.  But everything looked like it was from the 1950s, including all the people walking around smiling and going about (apparently) very cheerful tasks.  An older lady across the street beamed at him with a smile and a friendly wave.
*********************************************************
The kitchen had red walls with white cabinets, white appliances, and white tile counters.  In the center stood a butcher block table covered in an assortment of trays, platters, and bowls.  One was covered in tiny pecan pies, sugar cookies decorated like angels and ornaments lay on another.  A huge bowl of red and white wrapped muffins sat in the middle, with several candles scattered amongst them.  Christmas decorations hung, sat, and dangled from every wall space, counter, toaster, and knob.  Soft Christmas music played from further in the house.  They could see into the dining room, where a formal table was decorated with a two-foot-tall gingerbread house, ornately decorated.
Buddy yawned, turned over, and shoved Cas’ foot over an inch to stretch out a bit more.
Castiel lowered Dean’s shorts, taking his thick, heavy cock in his hand, smoothing lube over it.
“You leaving?” Sam asked.
They stood there quietly.
Whoa.
“Whoa,” Dean looked at him in shock.  “Were you...are you?”
A) The sheriff knew Bobby and it didn’t seem to be the same way Donna knew him.  And now that he thought about it, why did Donna hang around Bobby so much?
“Mm,” Luc almost growled as he backed up.  “I gotta say, I like the look of you takin’ care of my baby.  Does somethin’ for me.”
“Columbo solved all his cases, if I remember correctly.”
“There are no friendships here,” Cas bit back.  “You will be compensated for your sign and your lawn.  As for your business, that’s your problem.”  He stepped between Gabe and Sam, coming toe to toe with Balthazar.  “And don’t ever touch me again.  You have no idea what I’m capable of.  A very PUBLIC sexual harassment case would be very messy.  Mr. Rochè.”
Dean pulled his thumb away, adding more lube and quickly supplying two fingers.  Cas pumped back onto them, seeking the feel of Dean’s cock, even through his jeans, but Dean was stubbornly denying him.  “I gotta stretch you good,” Dean murmured, spreading his fingers.  “Cause I’m gonna fuck you hard.”
“You wanna switch with me, so you can sleep with Charlie?” Jo asked.
“It’s no big deal.  I’m just going to hang out.  It might turn out to be nothing.”  His nerves were fortified by the fact that Dean was staring at him hard.  Good.
“I don’t think I’ve ever been this relaxed in my entire life,” Cas said aloud, staring up at a wide smattering of stars that he knew had names and made pictures, but all he could see was how pretty it was.
“Ten four,” came Dean’s gritty, sleep voice.
“Let me see!” Came Bobby’s voice.
For the first time in his life, Castiel saw beyond the walls of their school.  Beyond the blocks of south side.  Beyond the tight group of friends he ate lunch with.  He was taking control of his life.
“He’s also the mayor,” Melanie added.
Dean, looking as relieved as he was to be away from their host, nodded and followed him up the stairs eagerly.
“Oh yeah?” Cas asked, quiet and with a really interested grin.
“And I’ll be where?” Gabe asked, knowing he wasn’t quite the boy scout/ranger these guys were, but he was definitely stealthier than Cas.
Sam, Gabe, the Carrigans, and the Harringtons started heading their way.
He told me he loves me.
G) People kept referring to them as Bobby’s ‘crew’.  Was that weird?  It felt weird.
Only time would tell.
“It was nice to meet you,” he said, looking back to check on Gabe.  He winced when he saw Gabe surrounded by the Whittakers, Carrigans, and Frielings.  “I better get back there.  I left Gabe...”
Neither he or Sam said anything, not wanting to get Fletcher upset, who seemed quite happy with everything so far, but they both seemed to have picked up some oddities at the bar.
“You would definitely appreciate if we got a room,” came Cas’ voice from their room.
“No!!” Fletcher laughed, pulling away.
Bobby paused in his steps, looking up to the porch.  “Hey there.”
Dean let off the gas some more.  Oh yeah, Cas knew about their dad.  Sweet.
He didn’t give a shit.
“Kinda grouchy, I’d say,” the sheriff (the FREAKING sheriff) said, her real grin returning.  Gabe glanced to Cas for help, raising his eyebrow in the universal signal for come-fucking-help-me.
“Thank you!”
“No.”
Gabe stared at a poster in the waiting room of the police station.  It was a Rockwell print of a cop and a little boy sitting on stools at a soda shop.  It could be at Harrington’s.  Quaintness shouldn’t make him feel so violent, but there he was, hands clenching into fists.  Bobby was pacing again, phone lodged between his shoulder and ear, explaining to Rufus in hushed whispers all they figured out so far today.
Chip chuckled, seconded by Wayne as Madge, Ed, Cindy, and Justin smiled at a job well done.
“Hello boys.”
“Guess she’s slumming it for the summer,” Gabe huffed a laugh.  “Besides, it’s nothing serious.  Have you ever seen her dad?”
Castiel smirked.  “Yeah, I’m trying to be ‘responsible’.”
“So,” Cas offered quietly, “I think we should offer her a place to stay here.”
Dean huffed a laugh.  “Bring ‘im to my house.  We can take him downstairs.”
It was enough to make Castiel grin.  He knew Luc wasn’t all bad.  It was just that usually bad was all you got.  “What’s his name?”
“Good.”  His smile melted as his eyebrows lowered into a full fledge frown.  “You two stink.”
“Hunter?” Gabe said, hearing Nellie knock again.
“I’m sorry I got in a fight,” Sam explained, “but if you sat through classes with that idiot, day after day, listening to his constant teasing...” Sam shook his head, looking near to tears.
“Your neighbor went back on his deal,” Wayne said tightly, Mahoney throwing him a ‘shut up’ glare.
“Got time to stay for a cup of coffee?” Sam asked.
“Well, you had lots of folks stop by to check on you today.  Anna from the photo shop, Alfie, the guy from the market, Missouri, both florists.  They all wanted to let you know they were rooting for ya.”
Other than paying a little more attention than usual, Dean gave nothing away.  Castiel had no idea where he stood on the thought of bisexuality.  Or being a gay man, for that matter.  Not that it really mattered.  He didn’t need Dean’s approval.  Dean was straight as a board.
“This shit is gold!” Gabe laughed, hearing Nellie rant inside her house, most assuredly about Rufus.  “Hunter got The Nose ALL fired up!”
“Mmm,” she frowned.  “And?”
Cas whacked Sam’s shoulder.
“Oh!” Cindy laughed.
Luc laughed.  “I was trying to sell some girls underwear to Uriel.”
He rubbed his eyes with the palms of his hands, groaning loudly to the empty room.  He was tired of hiding it.
“Well...$50.  Unless they make a raucous.  Then charge them double!”
Jack began to cry.
“I need to talk to you.”  The man looked slightly pale and nervous.
Dean even snuck in a quick kiss at one of the gas stations they stopped at.  The moms seemed none the wiser.  Gabe and Sam were too absorbed with each other to notice the nirvana on Castiel’s face.  He had spied them holding hands in the back seat.  He had to grin at how sweet they both were.
What seemed like half an hour later, Luc came back to the family room.  There were several others sitting on the other sofa, but no one had said a word to him.
“This place is pretty awesome, wherever the hell we are,” Dean chuckled.
The basement door opened, and Dean’s eyes flicked to the top of the doorway.  He let go, jostling Cas slightly with his elbow.
Dean bit his bottom lip, drying his hands.  He turned to watch his brother.  “Cas and I are eating at the Dowling House.”
“Hm,” came the rumble that Castiel had so very much learned to love.
“Yeah!” Dean panted.
“You shut up,” Bobby snarled, his gun still trained on Wayne, who seemed to have forgotten he was even holding a gun.
And Cas knew.
Gabe swallowed his bite.  “Yeah.  Wayne Whittaker says, and I quote, aliens did it.”
Sam turned, catching sight of the Carrigans in their car, leaving Lily Dale Lane.
“That’s because the one with no imaginary friend has ghosts and monsters,” Dean added, as if that made perfect sense.
“Are you ready?” Cas asked, ignoring everyone but Dean.
“I was going to ask you out for some milkshakes at Harrington’s.  But if you’d rather have nachos -”
***************************************************************
Dean reached to his back pocket, pulling out a small bottle of Jonnie Walker.  “Bobby told me I might need to persuade you.”
“I’m always right,” Rufus sighed under his breath.
“That’s right,” Gabe said, pointing with his fork.  “Nosy Nellie.  She’s always snooping around the neighborhood, acting like she’s getting the mail or watering her flowers.”
Doug opened the back door, shoving Dean in the backseat.  “You fight those fairies!”
Sully shook his head.  “No.  Cindy’s sister died and they got custody of him three years ago.  Awesome kid!  Quiet, but seems pretty happy most of the time.”
Dean shook his head in disgust, ending the call.  Castiel took the phone out of Dean’s hand, blocking the number.  “Unbelievable.”
“Yeah, but...it just looked different.”
Another cop came to the waiting room, looking around.  “You here for...” the cop checked her clipboard, “Mr. Winchester?”
The medics assured them Fletcher was only sleeping.  Waking and groggy, Fletcher reached out for them, the pair assuring him he would be fine and that they would meet him at the hospital.
“I...uh...I knew her mother.  Years ago.  Back when I was a hunter.  Before I became a priest.”  Murphy frowned down at his hands.  “Actually, she was the reason I became a priest.”
“Or just total bullshit,” Dean shrugged.
Chapter 9:  From Affirmations to Final Words
Gabe chuckled, wiping Sam’s face off with his blanket.  “We don’t have a shower curtain up yet, Samshine.”
“Ed is settling in to watch a movie in the living room and Madge is on the couch.  They might be a while.”
Cas glowered harder.
Jo laughed, sitting back with her beer.  “He’s harmless.”
Sam couldn’t see Fletcher’s face, but he could feel him immediately tense at Ed and Madge’s approach.  “He’s awesome!” Sam interjected.
Mmm.  Tough.  Tell him how adorably macho he was?  Or play coy?  Tell him how devastatingly gorgeous he was?  Quit pushing his luck and just shut up and go to sleep?
If he could just make himself do it.
Gabe grinned harder.  “You and me, little brother.”
“So, you were sayin’?” Sheriff Hanscum went on.
“Did your meeting go well?” Dean asked.  All he knew was Cas texted him saying he had a meeting after work.  He also noted Cas had changed clothes, now in jeans and a Henley.
Rufus chuckled like he was watching a comedic skit.
Castiel jumped, snagging the frisbee from the air.
Sam shrugged.
Castiel got out, inhaling the fresh air that blew from the woods toward town.  Luc sat on the hood of his car, looking back at Castiel.  He came around the hood, sitting next to him.
“Damnit.”
“Nope,” Dean quipped.
“A resident.  A friend that Bobby visits daily.”
“If you had hung around,” Sam interrupted, “you woulda seen what Gabe and I saw.  PJ Berman is the guy Deb was sneaking off to see the other night.”
“Looks empty!” Sam grinned.
****************************
Donna quirked a questioning look at both of them, but they turned and walked toward the car.
“Yeah, we got well water.  Pissed them right off when we didn’t join into the city system too.  I make it a point to not pay Don Stark or Chip Harrington a cent more than I have to.  There ain’t a damn thing wrong with our water.”
Castiel pulled the blanket up higher and pulled Dean into him for more warmth.  They had been lying on the hood of Dean’s car for half an hour, staring up at the night sky, talking softly about nothing at all.  Frost clung to everything and they would have to go into the motel soon.  The southern heat was nice down south, but they were in the mid-west now, due to arrive in Sioux Falls tomorrow.  Dean had loved New Orleans.  He seemed destined to reign as King of Bourbon Street.  One restaurant owner took such a liking to him that Cas had to assert his dominant streak in a more public venue than normal.  Luckily, Dean ate it up and they’d had insanely hot sex in the alley out back.  Take that, Benny Lafitte and your jambalaya and Cajun accent.  The memory of Dean against that brick wall in the warm night, liquor on the very breeze, made his toes curl.
**********************************
Luc gave him a long look.  Like he wanted to hear that but didn’t quite believe it either.  They talked for over an hour before a snuffling cry got their attention.
Dean pinned him with a downright naughty grin, making Castiel blush.  “I’m sure there’s plenty you still don’t know.”
“I’m sorry I scared Fletcher.  That vision was...sharp,” Camille said, staring off toward the floor.
Oh, he was gonna hear about this all night.  Sam cleared his throat, giving his husband a warning grin.  “We were in the city, so...guess that makes us city folk.” Sam huffed an uncomfortable laugh.
Gabe took Fletcher to Garth’s under pretenses of them visiting their friend who had a huge collection of sock puppets Fletcher wanted to see.  The door was barely shut before Sam and Cas were grabbing for the kitchen door to the backyard.
“Hey, it’s a party!” Dean added, Sam elbowing him to shut up.
“I think my brother has a crush on your brother,” Dean said quietly.
Sam shook his head.  “Sick of the couch already?  Or it just wasn’t big enough to hold you both?”
And then he was asleep.  Gone from the world of the waking.
“Bitch, that’s mine!” Sam laughed.
“It’s your turn to answer,” Gabe groaned.
“You and Gabe got a good thing goin’ here.”  He gave his little brother an encouraging slug on the shoulder.  “So, how you plannin’ on slaving me today?”
“Or Fletcher’s bedroom,” Dean said.  When both Sam and Cas turned to him with questioning looks, he shrugged.  “They kept Harry Potter under the stairs.  Why not?”
“Well, I think you’re pretty hot,” Gabe grinned, laughing when Sam whacked him.  “Those big brown eyes!” Gabe swooned, “and those locks of luscious hair!”
“And all the cops here are dirty?” Sam asked, fishing for more.
He considered himself very lucky that Dean was such a romantic.  And so adventurous.  He picked up three blankets, their pillows, stuff to clean up with, and lube, heading back to the running room.
“No idea.  The house numbers here make no sense at all.  The Carrigan’s are 3.8.  The Whittaker’s is 6.9.  Then this house,” Sam pointed to the one the woman had come from the other night, “is 11.16.”
Cas turned around abruptly, staring at Bobby in shock.  “Not in any universe.”
“That’s true,” Sam sighed.  “They’re all over the place, but I keep hitting dead ends.”
“And the fair,” Sam added.
Cas rapped his knuckles on Marion’s door, pushing it open.  “Marion, it’s Cas and Sam.”
“I think we got a problem.”
“I was so worried,” Castiel whispered.
Dean glared at Luc one last time and backed out, heading back out to the old highway.
Well...they’d have to work up to that.
“Gabriel,” Cas sighed.  “Did you vandalize Balthazar’s sign?”
“I am,” Castiel grinned at him.  Pops of color lit the sky, lighting Dean’s face in the dark evening.  “With you anyway.”
From the corner of his eye, Cas saw Sam snooping through mail laying on a table in the foyer.  Cas cleared his throat nervously.  Was Sam searching the house?  He gave Don a grin as Don began to talk about some of the properties and investments around Charming Acres.  He caught a flash of Sam going up the steps and tugged at the collar of his suit that he still wore from his interview.  This was terribly risky.
“Mind if I take a stab at it?” Dean asked.
“Dude.  Details.”
“Claire,” Dean grinned, hugging the young hunter.
“Kid seems nice, but I could tell by Sam’s spider-senses that something was off immediately.  And he’s no stranger to imaginary friends.  I don’t know.  Some psycho-babble probably explained to me but I blanked it all out.”
Castiel felt a sting of jealousy.  Dean might not be so willing to...flirt, tutor, whatever they were calling it, if a new girlfriend was in the picture.  He felt like Dean had been keeping a secret from him.  But that wasn’t exactly true.  What he and Dean did from time to time was the real secret.
“That’s what I’m wondering,” Gabe added.  “I assume you guys were Scooby ganging today?”
The three left the house silently, crossed the side yard and went into Sam’s house, stopping abruptly in the kitchen where Gabe still sat at the table, looking up from his phone as they came in.
“Something happened with Wayne and Mahoney,” Gabe explained.  “Marion heard them yelling at Cas and she called the cops, thinking they would help him, but they ended up arresting him.”
“Hello, Inias.  The ballroom is all set for you.”
Castiel knew exactly what had happened.  He pressed his lips together at the ridiculously guilty look on Sam’s face and the nervous look on Mary’s.
Next, they passed an empty store with a vacancy sign.  Dean stopped, stepping closer to the window.  Castiel joined him, peering into the dusty store.
This was good.
“So, friend?” Sam clarified “or...”
“Damn.”
“It could happen,” Bobby sighed.  “I mean, you could have ended up with Balthazar.”
“Lotta psychic people here?” Dean asked.
They moved as quietly as possible, only sounding like a small herd of rhinos as they snapped fallen twigs and bickered.
“Fuck,” Dean moaned, pumping hard and fast.  “So mine, mine, mine,” Dean moaned.
“Okay,” Garth nodded, blinking rapidly to try to keep up.
“Why do people do this shit?” Dean laughed at a video of a pair of kids sliding down a roof and almost into a pool below.
He let go of Cas’ hand and turned onto his side, away from him.
He went back inside and made his way upstairs to the guest room slow and quiet.  If Cas was waiting on him, he was going to have to step up his game.  Words and jokes were how he usually got laid.  Some flirty grins or even just not turning down an advance.
“Yeah,” Sam admitted, not near as entertained.  “And the kid’s imaginary friend.”
“You mean Dr. Mahoney’s special brew?” She asked innocently.
Castiel smirked.  “Nice try.  But no.”
“Can I help you?” Cas asked with a rigid stance.  As amused as Dean could be at Cas’ glowering, he knew very well he could also be a force to be reckoned with.
“Oh, yeah,” Dean grinned.  “Crowley has contracts on everyone.”

Cas lunged into him with a heated determination to show ready he was.
“Dean!”  His hands immediately became nervous, suddenly not knowing how to operate proficiently.
“Eat me,” Dean snipped, clinking bottles with him anyway.
“Almost!” The game host yelled.  “Just five more dollars for five more tries!”
Cas put a leg on the bed and Dean pulled him back into his chest.  “Uh-uh.  No bed for you.  I’m claiming this ass.”  Dean slid his hands down Cas’ hips to squeeze his ass cheeks.
