Castiel sighs, it sounds like he's just relaxed after a long day into a hot bath or slain a battlefield of demons. And Dean's bursting full and then fuller, a liquid warmth pulsing into him and it burns and aches and... Dean orgasms in a shivery mass, wings limp, body insensate. He's pretty sure he'd be on his knees if Castiel didn't have him pinned to the wall, immovable behind him.
"Hi...Mrs. Winchester." Could he sound anymore like he was being held at gunpoint and wanted to be anywhere else? Dean mentally groans, worried he's not going to sell a bit of this bullshit. At least his family will definitely buy them breaking up though!
"I would prefer this be a painless transaction. I will service you regularly as your kind is wont to need - if this could somehow be...civil."
A peal of laughter, deep and unfamiliar rings out along with Sam's chuckling and his mother's low whispers. It steals his attention from Jess and Dean stands quickly shooting a glare into the living room.
"Then, then you don't have to pretend tonight. I just want to have fun with you tonight." Dean leans forward into Cas' space and allows his brain to shut down for a minute. He wants to wrap his arms around Cas and be close to him so he does. He wraps his arms around Cas’ neck and pushes into his space, against his body. He revels in the compact heat and how they fit together, just about perfect if he tucks his head in. When the tension leeches out of Cas and his hands rest lightly on his hips, Dean smiles into his cheek. "Come on Cas..."
He's going to ruin it.
He couldn't wait to claw up that little body.
"...Dean."
"Good night Dean."
"Are you fucking serious?" Dean feels like his eyebrows are in his fucking hair he's in that much disbelief. There's obviously the big win here which is - apparently his husband can be ready for him to ride on command which - best news ever. But... "You guys don't get to have enjoyment? Pleasure?"
He's just stream of consciousness yammering to find something Cas responds to, talking about work and the upcoming LARPing events with Charlie, to Christmas at his mom's - and he teases Cas' gift which, that gets a reaction from him finally, a lightening of his eyes and the tiniest curl of his lips before Dean says firmly that he obviously will find out what he's getting tomorrow because he's not spilling.
Then Cas had decided he wanted to drink the bar. He'd had a flurry of cocktails; mojitos, margaritas, sweet shots... and then found Dean on the dance floor.
Lauren had been sweet and cute in a girl-next-door, 'I want to save the world' way - but the moment she had talked about the environmental impact of Baby, she was gone.
He does look good. The nerdy factor is killing Dean - but he does look good. Must have his contacts in today too because that myopic squint is all wide-eyed blue today. It's so weird to see Cas with his hair behaving though. Dean can't quite decide if he likes it or not.
"Good morn...ning?" Cas sits up straight quickly from the frankly obscene slouch he'd been in and Dean squeaks as he presses himself against the counter, willing his erection away with all his willpower. "Uhh..."
Dean's had thoughts about how weird Cas is. Weird in a good way! Like how he seems so straight-laced, but has a wickedly dry sense of
the bad guy!
"Maybe you shouldn't judge a book by its cover Sammy." Dean clips out, hopping up onto the kitchen island stool and watching his brother prepping something with too many vegetables in a casserole dish. "Besides, he's...super nervous. Almost had a freak out in the driveway."
So for the next few days Dean took advantage of his missing Bondmate to seal some deals on Earth and just cause some petty minor havoc.
It ends up that his mom is the only one without a beer and Sam joins them in the living room with the photo albums while Dean glowers in the kitchen with Jess. He can hear his mother telling Cas about the pictures as she goes through the album.
He gets on his knees pulling jeans and briefs down with him and fucking moans as Cas comes free. He hadn't seen while Cas was rutting him against his bedroom door and now he can and he's thick. Not overly long but mouth-wateringly thick and Dean wants that.
by the way... You know it has nothing to do with you being gay..." Cas snorts loudly and jumps on that.
"Dinner's ready when you are." Dean scowls at the gentle smile on her face and snatches his beer back from Cas. He's annoyed as he stomps back downstairs behind his mom and he can feel Cas right at his back like a shadow. He isn't expecting it as they're walking back toward the kitchen, the hand that trails down his lower back like a brand and makes him shiver right to his toes.
"I can take a little pain. It's spicy." He says it to mollify Cas because he doesn't think he can take an apology from an angel and it sounded like one was coming. "I really enjoyed your fingers. You should do more of that." When he bends his leg and reaches behind, Castiel steps forward, all attention. "See..." He goes for two just to show him and Dean grunts, bites his lip as he forces them in and then moans once he gets past his opening. He sighs when his fingers are in as far as he can go at this angle and opens his eyes to look up at Castiel. "I can take it."
"We're sleeping in my room. I don't know if you are sleep-on-the-floor pissed but I'm not. So it's up to you." Cas follows wordlessly and doesn't even look at him after they enter.
Evidently Cas could hold his liquor. He had done a line of five straight tequila shots like they were water and, with that, started the night sitting much too close to Dean in the booth. At some point the groping of his thigh had started, and Dean had continued to drink, chat, and ignore it.
"Huh? Yeah, of course." Dean smiles as honestly as he can, content to be here with his family. Nothing else mattered. "Just, long day. You know. Uhh, are we doing the usual room split?" He knows without asking they are but there's something in him that hopes. Maybe he can get away with sleeping on the couch downstairs if he pretends to crash out watching tv.
The bee themed slippers get a crack of a smile from him before he remembers he has to look Cas in the eye and ask him a huge…no, a
." And it's there, then it's gone, closed behind Cas' bedroom door.
Dean manifests his wings wordlessly, quivers while staring into Cas' blue, blue damned eyes and forces himself - it's not his denomination, he doesn't identify as it, forces himself to submit, spreading his wings wide, fragile inner lining skyward.
Comments loved, kudos welcome!
Dean gapes, borderline offended as Sam huffs a laugh behind him and his mom and Jess eat it up with smiles and laughter. Cas smiles then, pulling his eyes away to look at his mom.
He sinks down slowly into the wet spot on the bed, trembling and gasping.
"Sure, sure. Now, tell me what kind of shitstorm you put me in."
"I got you Cas. Fuck." It's just a minute, but it feels like the longest minute of his life watching his clumsy ass hands trying to get Cas out of his fucking jeans. He can feel Cas shaking against him and wonders what he's feeling as Dean kisses him, slick and breathless one more time before going to the floor.
Dean makes grabby hands and Castiel hands his cup over, feeling as if he adopted a stray child. Dean is a slurper, he soon shows as he blows and quickly slurps and swallows hot coffee.
“I only bought a half one. Come on… I’ll eat most of it - you just have one bite. One!” Sam is following him around with a food container that Dean would usually expect to hold pie or cake.
"You're supposed to be my friend, for one thing! You don't get to treat me like shit and ignore me for days and then expect me to come here and pretend like everything's fucking fine...!" Shit. Fucking hell. He doesn't
Thrown into the wall face first this time. Hard enough to stun and he's still blinking, dazed when his arms are yanked down behind him, held in one steel-viced grip. "Fucking asshoo-
"Dude, let's go out for drinks. Find the closest bar and get a little wasted. We don't have to get to the house until like one, two-ish." He declares it loudly, upbeat before pulling Cas' feet from where they were tucked under him. "It'll be fun."
Enjoy.
of his attitude. I - honestly, at this point, don't know why he bothered coming..." Dean crosses his arms and stares moodily. Sam frowns at him before sighing heavily, stepping forward to clasp Dean's shoulder.
On screen, Castiel is holding a fork in his hand like a weapon and poking at the mound before him. Dean unplugs his headphones so they can both hear the catastrophe about to occur. Dean’s going to miss watching this hot dude eat strange things because there’s no way that shit isn’t toxic and deadly.
"I'm not the one who can't even look me in the eye. Every time today I tried to even engage you to try to smooth over what could maybe pass as a small tiff, you've looked at me like I've mortally offended you - so don't give me any shit about ruining the holiday for you." Cas spits back,  low and angry, and Dean gapes at him, temper flaring fast and high.
"They would...uhh, love to meet you next Sunday if...you can make it?" Dean flinches as Castiel takes another deep breath, hissing it out slowly like he's meditating.
He switches to his munchies food and that’s when Dean very politely exits to his bedroom with the laptop, giving Sam the finger as he makes a face at him.
“What the…” The guy is caught as off guard as Castiel and he stiffens in the chair, shooting upright. “Whoa cat… cat? Benny has a - cat?” He raises one hand defensively into the air, leaning back like he’s trying to disappear into the chair and Castiel can’t stand it anymore.
"He's...not what I expected?" Sam almost whispers it, giving Dean a confused look. He's surprised he feels offended on Cas' behalf and gives his brother his most withering look.
"Come out and have fun with me." If his demand sounds like wheedling, it's only to combat the exhaustion he can hear in Cas' voice. He almost sighs the question and Dean hates the...the defeat in his tone. "We'll have fun I promise...please?"
"Cas, we're leaving!"  Dean shouts unnecessarily and seeing as he was only a few feet away, Cas gives him an unimpressed look.
Cas tilts his head and looks at Dean so bluntly he almost wants to hide. "Are you really this - " He squints disbelievingly while Dean shuffles on his feet.
He feels when Cas sidles up next to him and half turns to include him in the mix. "Ah, yeah. So, Cas…umm…this is my brother Sam and his girlfriend Jessica. Guys, this is Castiel. You already met my mom."
"Oh." He's staring at the side of Dean's face while he pants and writhes himself breathless, drunk on pleasure. And then he doesn't have to urge him anymore. There's almost a monotony to the rhythm of Castiel's thrusts but the predictability helps drive Dean mad, especially when he gets to the point of whimpering, desperate for just a bit faster, harder, something!
“Benny!? What-what... the fuck man…” Castiel crept up to the bedroom door and opened it quietly, sticking his head out. Down the corridor he could see a rather tall, well-built guy standing in the middle of his tiny living room, looking around like he was lost. Sandy haired? Dark blonde maybe… chiseled features and in profile a generous mouth.
Cas is a friend. Just a friend.
Dean retches dramatically, body shaking with it. “Fuck no!”
"You don't see why we might need some distance Dean?" Cas' voice is getting softer, lower as all the animosity leeches out of him and it's like they're linked, how it flows out of him too.
When he looks back Cas is still sleeping but has tilted slightly like he's seeking the missing warmth behind him. The softened pout of his lips is suddenly the most distracting thing in the room and Dean can't deal with this right now.
“I found this strangely mesmerizing ‘food’,” The vlogger uses air quotes unironically, his handsome face impassive. “at a New Age vegetarian deli on 6th and South. I was assured by the clerk it wouldn’t kill me but I’ve written a few words for my barrister should I perish after this video.”
“Okay so my brother’s more of a burger kind of guy but I got him to agree to one bite for science.” Dean grimaces and makes a face before he remembers the internet is watching and hitches the fake smile back on. “We were watching the video that Castiel made and honestly it was amazing…”
"Okay Dean. This one time, once." He barely holds himself back from hugging, squeezing Cas' knee instead. "I guess I'll have to look at my one silver lining. Eye candy boyfriend for a day."
He knows he fails from how Sam's eyebrows immediately jack up into his hair when Dean sits himself silently at the table and thumps down his beer bottle. He can only imagine how he looks from the smile Jess is trying to contain and Sam's continued staring.
“So what? Casual sex is safer? Better?” Gravel-rumble voice fires back and Dean realizes as he hits the last step that they’re in the lobby, walls lined with people’s post boxes and the lobby is a length of less than ten feet out the front doors and into the wide world without this guy’s company.
Dean feels cold the rest of the night. He thinks about lost possibilities that he doesn't really have the right to mourn because it's not real anyway, none of it is.
“It looks like he’s about to.”
“Castiel.” Finally his hand is taken and shook. Bed-head sex voice has a name and boy!
“You’re disgusting.” His brother stands pushing the chair away from the table and swinging it back to its original spot.
"We had a fight Sam! He didn't even want to come here today! And like I said I didn't do shit to him!" His voice is rising and Dean bites back more angry retorts as he thinks about Cas bringing a guy into their house last night but somehow ...
"It was working so well." He strangles out. "I mean, indefinitely they would never have tried to set me up again. I think my mom wants to adopt you, and Sam just loves to torment me about how I'm supposedly whipped." Dean lets it all out in a flood. "So, why would I break up with you? They'd just feel sorry for me and wonder how I'm surviving still living with you and either try to get us back together or... Christ knows. So... yeah. I figured not breaking up made more sense."
"Let's go Dean." The pretense is good, from holding hands walking to the door from the car up until they're inside. His mom had hugged Cas as soon as she got him in the door which softened his expression immediately, Dean's hug like an affectionate afterthought as she took Cas into the kitchen with her. Dean doesn't even mind as it allows him to drift into the living room with Sam and Jess, who are already wrapped up in each other on the couch watching tv.
to Cas' back and a little too happy in his pants. He cusses under his breath and deals with shutting off the phone first.
"I swear on Sammy - okay Cas? We get through Christmas... we hang out with Sam and Jess for Old Years' and we can "break up" sometime before my birthday so it's not weird. You won't have to do this shit for me anymore... but I just, you know doing this means a lot Cas. I'm so glad I met you."
So he'd been dry humped while dancing, told dirty things in the back of their Uber home that had given him blue balls and then had to live with the guy for the past two days.
, bit more of this." Fuck. His toes are fucking curling and there's no way Cas' eyes boring into him while he fingers himself open should be this hot. Enough of that. He turns his face into the bed and immediately has to blow away feathers. He goes cross eyed glaring at the one stuck to the side of his face and - Castiel's hand carefully plucks the feather off his skin before the angel settles himself next to him on the bed.
"Hey." Cas is sitting on their L-couch right in the junction. He has one leg tucked under himself, looking cozy in a college hoodie and shorts with fuzzy house slippers on as he watches a Food Network show.
The topic doesn't even come back up until Saturday afternoon when Cas is sprawled across the long side of the couch with Dean sitting on the other end, scrolling through his phone.
Heard it said while he laid his head across a lap of two firm thighs and was petted. Fingers spooling through his hair until he's unspun, open and content.
Yeah, hot.
Dean pads out in sweats and yawns out a 'morning' before shuffling past him for the coffee pot. Castiel has his head buried in a folder scattered across their kitchen island, cradling a coffee cup in two hands like it's his firstborn kid. When he looks up at Dean, he gets a tick of an eyebrow and a brief once over before Cas grunts at him and returns to working.
Cas was trying to prove a point, basically to get Dean to say chicken.
Cas is smiling at him, eyes all soft and he feels a foot rubbing his calve under the table.
"Yeah?" That's the fucking hottest thing. Cas spread on the ground underneath him,
"I'm sorry to derail this discussion. Mary," Cas gives a charming hint of a smile and leans into his mother's space. "I'm ready for the embarrassing photo album while Dean drowns himself in beer with his brother and Jessica."
"Ah, kind of a he. He's...a he." Where's he going with this? Where is he going with this! The shock only buys him a minute, Sam recovering before his mother because while they both also know he's bi, Sam is the only one who's actually seen him with a guy before.
"People and atmosphere Cas. Come on..." He almost says 'you can meet someone' before he swallows it back. The only sex he's had in the last two months has been Cas and he's surprisingly fine with that. He hasn't been fine with Cas bringing random dudes in their house though, so while the guy was entitled, Dean didn't have to put the idea in his head.
They weren’t even high!
"I do understand the merits of that saying about watching someone go but I prefer the view if you'd stayed. Positively eye-catching."
The fucking romantic.
When he hears something - or someone, thump violently into his front door.
Dean can get sex anywhere, anytime he wants... but he wants it from his damned angel and he's not going to fucking beg for it. Cas will ask and he will take and that is how this thing is going to happen.
"Imagine getting to the bottom of the stairs to mom and Jess standing awkwardly looking at your door. And when I asked one of them to call you about breakfast, getting a blush from my girlfriend that you sounded
"Oh, Dean. He's lovely. You could have told us about him before we went setting you up with Robin and Liz." She says it softly with a hand on his arm. Dean hides his surprise and looks quizzically at Jess. "I really hope it wasn't because he's a guy..."
"We're not ruining Thanksgiving for your family Dean. We're going to go in there and be sickeningly coupled. We'll put on a good show, maybe get caught in flagrante delicto, somewhere in your mother's home. Then you're never going to ask this of me again."
He can't get off of him but the angle Cas is pressed in at and Dean's size kink are more than enough. He comes after teasing his rim with pulling out and then slamming back onto Cas with a thrilled cry. His wings flare with his climax and Dean shrieks his ecstasy, blissed out. Finishes shuddering, bent into a defensive curl on top of the angel he just came all over.
“I’m such a spaz, totally forgot…” Dean is rambling and using every excuse as he grabs his shirt, keys, jumps and wriggles into last night’s jeans from… (Kelly? Carrie? Shelly!) Shelly’s floor.
He flushes so fast it feels like he's feverish and Dean knows he's gaping unattractively. Did Cas just really...
"I tried for you. Of course I'd try for you Dean." Cas gaze meeting his is resolute, a promise and it's amazing to have this devotion already in such a new friend. They're so close Dean can see the dilation of Cas' pupils, hear the hitch in his breath when Dean's eyes flicker down to his mouth. "But we should have known this wouldn't work..."
True form Seraphim were entities of pure Grace, warriors made of Holy energy, wings and claws and many fanged-heads. Like he was now, the Seraph was in a vessel. Modeled after one of those meat bag creatures God had made but not right, because he looked too perfect, skin too smooth, eyes too blue, perfectly emotionless. That glorious mix of Seraph and human that appealed to his kind. Not so powerful to burn him to ashes but sturdy enough to give a good fuck and take a little punishment in return.
"I thought..." Cas ruffles his already disarrayed hair and Dean sits back into the couch and resists the urge to smooth it for him. "I thought, when we had talked at Thanksgiving that you understood this wasn't working? I don't want to keep pretending to be your boyfriend Dean."
" Dean was not above begging, feels rewarded when Cas takes his hand off immediately and spits into it before using his tongue to spread it around and precipitously taste Dean. The first stroke he gives him back is gorgeous, he chokes out a 'fuck yes' and his cock weeps a load of precum that makes Cas raise a dark eyebrow at him.
Dean just wants his family off his back. For his mom to stop worrying and Sam and Jess, though they mean well, to stop setting him up on dates. So he asks his roommate Cas to do him a solid and pretend to be his boyfriend for one family dinner. That turns into weekend get-togethers. And then Thanksgiving and Christmas. It's New Years before Dean realizes he's in much too deep and they need to break-up. So they plan a scene for a proposal gone bad - what could possibly go wrong?
Cas must see the moment it clicks for Dean by his flush because he nods slowly. "Yes Dean. Consequences. So I'm going to suggest either you let your family down real easy this weekend and say, that we've had some irreconcilable differences, ...or…," The pause is indelicate, leaving Dean's imagination to run wild for a moment with just the extent of what they might have to do to keep his family convinced he's happy in his relationship with his boyfriend. "...We go for some Academy Award level dedication for Thanksgiving. And the decision is completely up to you."
"How'd that exam go? Sam said you were nose to the grindstone last weekend." The blonde pediatric resident chimes out a laugh as Dean lets her go.
"You're stealing my sun." Dean pushes with his arm, Cas looks at him stoically and refuses to budge. "You're being a dick."
. He stops too close, just inside the wide V of Cas' knees and doesn't speak until he's caught the heat of Cas' gaze.
very fucking much.
"I mean, were you
"Mom likes us to get there early to be part of the whole thing, so do you want to drive over Wednesday evening or go early Thursday morning?" Dean juts his chin forward as he speaks, defiant. Cas is frozen for a moment in their kitchen doorway before he slowly walks in past Dean and commandeers his work nook for his satchel, takes off his glasses, and then slowly turns to face Dean.
"Sammy. Oh, and there's your much better looking half. Hey Jess." He doesn't know why or how this gorgeous woman is settling for Sam, but he’s damned lucky to have her. Dean releases Cas and steps past his mother to give Jess a hug when she comes to meet him in the hallway. He hugs her tight, with a little spin.
“I like it too.” Dean ends up digging for his wallet, digging into a back pocket of his jeans with difficulty. “So - not that you have to necessarily subscribe to my thinking but,” He pulls out one of his business cards and hands it over jauntily between two fingers. “If there’s a Saturday you feel you might want to grab a drink or watch a movie… with a guaranteed happy ending, you can call me.” He can’t help the wink, dies inside a tiny bit in embarrassment but Castiel takes the card almost automatically, eyes glued to it.
He didn't worry when Dean had gasped at him and then startled himself to wakefulness, or even the next night when Dean didn't sleep.
The bar night they had planned had been a success. Charlie had been joined by her girlfriend Gilda, Jo with Victor, Benny, Dean and Cas. It should have been just a nice night of friends drinking and dancing, and maybe some funny pictures and hilarious stories.
He starts to remember.
" Something rolls through him and Castiel snarls, wings spreading high and wide.
"Uhh...it's kind of new, obviously and uhh...we, we're, feeling this out still so... I just went on the dates to humour you guys but, yeah. Already have someone." Dean stammers and churns out as he goes, hoping when he's done that he makes some sort of credible sense. His mom blinks, obviously still caught off guard while Sam leans forward interested, eager.
This is proven true when, after chugging half the beer and exhaling loudly, he finds Jess sneaking looks at them from the other side of Sam, who's not even hiding that he's staring at Dean.
“Sam, your views on the asparagus salad were truly thought-provoking and I do suppose that finding new ways of enjoying everyday foods do make inventiveness necessary. Dean, I hope you’ve recovered from your allergy. Swelling of the oesophagus and anaphylactic shock is quite dangerous. It would truly be a shame if someone so handsome with such talent for swallowing was lost to us.” The heavy pause is enough to make Dean swoon.
"I overdid it. You look like you're just going to hang out at a casual bar." Dean shrugs, puts his cup in the sink and decides to hurry them out before Cas freaks and bails on him.
“Fuuuck… I swear to God…” The guy takes one step toward the left, a staggered sway that makes Castiel’s eyes narrow. He prowls down the corridor, freezes as the guy huffs loudly and then almost dramatically throws himself into Castiel’s easy chair.
"Bitch." Dean pushes out of his chair and leaves the other half of his beer. "I'm tired of your face."
Comments loved, kudos welcome!
It had been so good though, being comfortable together without it being weird. Dean knew it would get weird if he had to ask Cas to play his boyfriend again for Thanksgiving.
“Bet you’re wicked smart. Doing a Masters at twenty-six. I’m turning twenty-four this year…” Dean’s voice goes quiet, trails off. “I’m just a mechanic though. I didn’t even go to college but I was interested in engineering...just stuff didn’t work out…” Castiel looks over his shoulder and Dean looks saddened, his eyes heavy. “My little brother though - as soon as I finished high school I started working ‘cause Sammy’s like… a genius. And I wanted him to be able to go off to school and not have to worry…”
(See the end of the chapter for
The guy pauses, and Dean slows as he catches up before the guy moves again. Second floor landing, one more flight and they would part ways, Dean thinks as they move, him two stairs behind the dude.
"Thank you." Castiel's voice is wicked dry as he says that. "You don't have to. I suppose it pales to...sex."
(See the end of the chapter for
"It's cool. My pleasure to help. Literally." When Dean winks it gets him that wicked head tilt and a wrinkle of skin between those bright blue eyes. He laughs and settles himself half on his side, across the bed.
His brother is completely confused and he uses that opportunity to get out of the kitchen, hopefully without his state being seen and he almost hurts himself trying to get upstairs after Cas.
Hello, it's Tuesday!
, to afterward try to invite Dean back to his place like he had expectations because he'd paid. The indignation Dean had felt had carried all the way home until when he told Cas about the entire awful thing, Cas had said ever so dryly that Dean should have told Jared about his 'no service tip, no service' rule.
Cas watches him finish off three more pastry preps and leave them to rise before he puts on coffee and works on breakfast. The entire time, Cas is silently attentive and Dean's in an increasing state of arousal that's just short of indecent, but can't really be hidden in the clothing he's wearing.
"The fuck!"
that." Sam looks disturbed and amused in halves. His mom finally interjects, waving Sam away while Jess wipes tears. Jess seems to soothe Sam's mental turmoil quite quickly despite his brother's dramatics.
Cas' exhale and wide blue eyes when they part, is worth it. The confusion when Dean sinks back down and kisses him again is a prize. Dean's selfish so he keeps taking... little bits of Castiel's innocence. The grunt and low hiss he gets for sinking teeth and then sucking a hickey into Castiel's neck is coupled with the warning of swelling fullness inside him.
Comments welcomed, kudos loved <3
Cas' small smile is like the sun breaking out through clouds and Dean feels his heart flip over in the worst way.
Geez, now he’s got a weird chubby.
He finds the Seraph he's Bound to hot in a 'fire and brimstone' kind of way, probably 'cause of the stone-faced look he's giving right now of total 'no fucks given'. He chaffs under the Binding, angel's Grace and Holy Light in a physical collar tying around his neck and he wonders will it burn all the time... so uncomfortable. Almost worth it only 'cause he knows what's coming soon.
." He tightens his arms around his angel's neck and smiles into his skin, kissing softly before Cas releases again, gasping out loud, hands scrabbling at Dean's wings.  Being filled to overflowing might be a new kink with his angel, Dean ponders as the slightest shift makes them squish stickily. "...please."
Dean waits a moment before looking back at Cas, who has abandoned his tv show in favor of tilting his head to look up at Dean. He's quiet for a few moments more before he speaks softer, private. "I just want to make sure it won't ruin...
"Please don't hate me, but you have to come for Thanksgiving." He blurts out in the moment, into the braindead void.
"I can't... I can't manage you Dean." Castiel spreads his arms, smiles suddenly and opens eyes the color of the sea. "You are responsible for the unplanned deaths of two humans who are apparently very important and my response to my superior was 'so what?'"
Dean's emotional stuntedness catches up with him.
"Dean...? Are the pillows...displeasing?" Hell, he's adorable.
Between bad tv and food prep for the next day, and the turkey down along with the other meats that needed to thaw, it's getting pretty late and Dean's thinking an early start for what he'll bake tomorrow is a good idea, so he's wanting to sleep soon.
"Look I'm sorry about how I was behaving after you brought to my attention we'd have to...be more physical. And Saturday was a
(See the end of the chapter for
"The building of sensation, the repetition of it to the area your hand is currently around, in conjunction with the pressure and heat..." Cas pauses, seems to struggle with his explanation. "The feeling of knotting is bewildering but after is... nice. Very nice." Dean's shocked at the smallest upturn of the corners of the angel's lips and how his eyes go soft. "It's like home, out of this...thing. Maybe like sunning." He blinks down at Dean, absently brushing his fingers over Dean's collar. "Do you sun?"
"Sammy and Mom were going to set me up on another date, Cas! And I remembered what you said about telling them to just give me space but - I know my family! They weren't going to settle for me just saying I was good so, I panicked. I'm sorry. I'm really, really..." Dean swallows, his tongue feeling thick in his mouth. "The...the thing is...?"
He finds his old tape deck radio still in his room and puts on some music low while he sits on the floor with his drink. It's gone too fast and he's aghast to think of heading downstairs again.
"Jesus...
"You said you would do this. You
"...broken you." He's honestly surprised as he wasn't trying to do shit to Cas. Well, that was kind of a lie. He'd wanted to see if he could break his willpower... "You didn't give in."
He would have enjoyed his "hard"-won freedom even more he supposed, with Castiel there to torment just a little. But now it's eight days later and Dean's itching like a junkie for a fix and his hubby is still conspicuously absent. It's actually grounds for him to contact the damned angels himself and expose his inattentive minder... but he,
At least he's safe then.
"Oh my God. You'll do it?" Cas rakes a hand through his bed-head hair, disorganizing it even more, before fisting a clump of it while looking at Dean.
That being a gelatinous mound of white, filled with multicolored speckles, of God only knew what. When he had started Castiel’s video he had looked at the monstrosity in front of the vlogger and promptly barfed in his mouth.
"Okay. I stand corrected. He can handle you." The goddamned eyebrow waggle is too much and Dean bites out a 'shut your freaking cakehole' at a hiss. "Wow Dean..."
Oh God… oh God! Dean watches with a kind of sick horror as the fork goes into the spread of plush pink lips. Usually about now he’d be pausing to watch how this guy sucks his food off the tines of the fork (every single time, like God he had a gorgeous mouth on him) but now Dean’s just disgusted.
The face. He can't see the face, it's fuzzy, faint, details slipping through his fingers except for 'impassive', 'grumpy', 'coy'. They don't fit together but they
He got fucked unconscious? Long enough for the angel to unlock?
“I like it.” He turns away to check on the coffee pot which is finally starting to drip, a nice slow stream of lovely coffee, the scent of cacao filling the air.
Dean is taken aback by the request, and it is a request that comes almost politely from the stone-faced angel, standing dominantly before him. But civility - this Castiel was...
(See the end of the chapter for
The fastest flash of betrayal. The hands on his hips flex, tighten. Relax again.
By the time they set up Sam’s sick of him and Dean’s a nervous wreck trying to get out of frame, because this was a bad idea. What were the chances Castiel would care about two guys giving a video response to his food review? Why were they doing this?
"Good morning. There's coffee." Cas intones roughly, the sex god look engaged as he laser focused in on him. "Dean can get you some."
It doesn't take long to put together a plan that's brilliant, refined and sure to get them out of this once next weekend passes.
(See the end of the chapter for
Until Dean goes to watch the bi-weekly review and sees there’s a response to their video response. And it’s private.
He blurts it out because he knows what comes next. Another name and another try but Dean's going to take the slightest pinch of Cas' advice.
Jesus, what did his mother show Cas?
"Are you satisfied? Man, you're here raised like a fucking flag pole." Dean kinda, sort of, really wants to sit on him. Except he feels like an overcooked noodle and even his hands are still shaking.
close."
Dean narrows his eyes at his brother and is about to say something not nice when Cas comes into the hallway. He pauses in the door frame before walking toward them, what little friendliness that had been on his face from Jess and his mom wearing off, leaving a brittle smile.
"Hey man." The nudge to his foot a while later from one of Sam's giant feet makes him look away from letting his mind rot on some trashy reality show. "Are you okay?"
Like now,  for instance, as he's watching tv while sitting in the nook so he can stretch his legs on the short side, while Cas lays on the other and tucks his feet under Dean. It's somehow gotten really goddamn comfortable.
Well. He's just scared off his brand new husband.
"I know you aren't capable of possessiveness, so did I manage to get the one prude angel?" He voices as he's pulled around behind this Castiel like a plaything, down one corridor then another. It gets old real fast so Dean digs in his heels and barely phases the Seraph beyond a sharp look over his shoulder. Then he's literally, legs out from under him, being dragged. "Oh for - fuck! Okay fuck! Goddamn -"
But Cas just laughs again, softer until Dean's standing there embarrassed and red, with his whole family looking at him. He knows they're doing that intense eye contact thing again, but he can't stop it.
in the past thirty-six hours! I don't know but you're not inspiring the atmosphere for a loving couple - just saying."
His brother raises his eyebrow at him as he comes in, causing Dean to bristle defensively. "What?"
"It's not like even if a human found me they can see my wings Cas." He quirks an eyebrow at his husband and instead pats the ground next to him. "Come on."
"See you soon, Cas!" Jess shouts after them and Dean flips her the bird once he's in the car and his mom has gone back inside. He can hear her giggling with Sam in the doorway before he starts the car to leave.
"Oh my God." He expels it under his breath and then just mentally says 'fuck it'. "Sammy, finish breakfast." He looks at Cas before he moves from behind the counter and sees the instant they click together, something slots into place.
Cas glares at him as he snorts again, swallowing laughter. "You're an asshole."
He sleeps somehow. Dean doesn't know when he falls asleep but he wakes to his phone alarm, nestled on his side
"Would you...
“I’m… I’m just going to come get my cat off you.” He puts the book down on the side table next to the love seat and walks up next to the man who looks up at him - and oh, his eyes are green with a burst of hazel and he was gorgeous, Good Lord - and slowly, a heavy, syrupy sort of atmosphere descends as Castiel leans over to pick up Padawan and then retreat slowly.
, him.
"Behave." Dean glares, narrowed eyed. Then leans into the angel's space slow and licks up the side of his face as sloppily wet as he can. "You are..."
Only thing is, when he's awake his life is all killing monsters, running from the law and protecting his kid brother. So what in his dreams is he so damned happy about?
"If you're sure." Cas mutters under his breath after a second before moving his head back to watching Cupcake Wars. Under the retort, there's a warning note in Cas' tone that Dean can't quite figure out. He hopes doesn't matter.
didn't
He and Sam chat too, but every time he hears his name, he jolts, Dean can't help it and tunes into the conversation again to make sure Cas is keeping the script rolling smoothly. Sam notices, becoming more and more amused.
"I know I'm asking a lot of you Cas," Dean's voice breaks a little and he musters his will to get through this. "If it's that you're honestly not cool with pretending to be my boyfriend anymore - I don't want to put you any deeper in a shit situation..." Like having to deal with your roommate maybe being a little too into you.
"They want to know why I haven't been with you." Yeah, why haven't you been with me Cas? Dean ponders his husband, petulantly. So what if the first time Cas hadn't known what he was doing? The second had been immeasurably better and that was going off a first that had been excellent to begin with in Dean's opinion... so why wasn't Castiel doing his duty? "How do I..."
Cas had come home on a half day, that Dean had gotten completely off from the office because of Christmas break and since then had been morose, a sad frown on his face that was tearing Dean up.
"I mean, you kind of are?" He can feel the tension between them here, Cas looking from the house to the yard and his Mom's flowers, to the garage, to the neighbors, taking everything in and rapidly over-processing.
"Hey." When he drops the glass down and looks again, Cas is right there, watchful, soft eyes and open expression on his face as he gazes at Dean.
"Yeah. 'Good morning' Dean. You forgot that earlier on your way out." Jess giggles out a soft 'Sam' but his brother isn't being silenced. "And telling me to finish breakfast when I don't even know what you were planning on
Not the sterling commendation he'd expected... Dean flicks the head of Cas' cock spitefully and it twitches but Cas doesn't even let out a sound. "What about knotting me then? How did that feel?"
“Bon appetit.” The brunette’s head tilts a second before he digs his fork into one of the depressions in the ‘flower’ mound and pulls. A chunk comes off, pulled by the fork and falls onto the serving platter he has under it with a sick splat.
Dean's nose wrinkled. He wasn't even tied to someone in the top twenty? Mildly insulting considering he was eleventh in line to the throne of Hell. If he cared enough to clear some chaff he could be eighth even - but Sammy was seventh and he would not harm his brother.
It’s only a few minutes later when his skin starts to itch that Dean wonders about what was in the damned salad.
“I’m sorry… I’m not laughing at you. Plus, that you don’t do morning afters with people is good to know… means your neighbors don’t have to deal with you shuttling… guys and girls out of here huh?”
“I have no idea who you are - or who you’re looking for for that matter but I think you have the wrong apartment!” Castiel shouts it almost hysterically and jabs 'Patterns Of Culture' forward. “Push the cat off and get out.”
Castiel is stuck like a deer in headlights looking at a veritable stranger pouring his heart out. If this is what bartenders went through, Castiel was now of the opinion they should be paid hourly like therapists. He turns back to the coffee pot, hiding his face.
(See the end of the chapter for
now that he's not facing the wrong way, or on a lap with his head unable to look up.
"You'll have fun, I swear." Dean says quickly, desperate for Cas to believe him. He feels like he's done something wrong - he isn't blind, he knows Cas isn't happy. He's just been assuming Cas will go along with the lie until Christmas and then just now tacked New Years' on there.
"I'm not judging. Just practice makes perfect and I can give you some pointers." Dean writhes, stretches his body slow and then clenches down with his muscles. There's a grunt, a sudden struggle of arms and wings and then sudden, sharp white-out pain - but he's so wet it just, pops out. And he's free.
"Oh!" Dean gapes as his mother lights up and Jess and Sam laugh out.
A brief flash of panic overtakes him and he looks around his bedroom for something to use as a weapon in case this person is angry - they sound loud and argumentative about this ‘Benny’ they are seeking - obviously not him, but he did not want to be caught in any crossfire if he stuck his head out to let whoever know he had the wrong apartment.
“-yeah, so I’m really sorry but you know, my kid brother’s daughter’s birthday is today too so I gotta go but I have your number. I’ll totally call you.” Dean gives his best winning grin as he finally hops into his other boot and the blonde frowns at him, reading through his bullshit.
some random dude last night." It comes out bitter and spiteful and makes Cas look like he got slapped in the face. Dean on the other hand is appalled he has shown he gives a solitary shit and he moves on quickly.
"There is nothing to tell." He clears his throat once, almost dramatic. "I realized I was remiss in my duty to you so I returned to...see, if you had need of me."
Well shit, who is he to say no to that?
He wakes with a shudder, breath caught in his throat and arousal trickling away, like a veil pulled off his body.
Castiel sits down next to him. This isn't their dimension so they're both looking human right now. Dean's sprawled in jeans, boots and a plaid button-down and Cas is for some reason in a suit with a trench coat. When Cas joins him lying back in the dirt, it's a testament to how much they're avoiding sex. How much Cas is anyway.
Something was missing. He wasn't being picky deciding on the first date that things wouldn't work... he just knew.
sort of touching." Dean looks away from  Cas' sudden, tiny smirk, smiling. "Ew, jerk."
"What are friends for?"
“No, wrong… door? Building? I don’t even know.” Why does he feel wrong-footed?! This guy had just broken into his apartment drunk! “Please, just push Pada off your lap and… you know, leave.”
This is just one reason why Dean actually likes the guy. He's not a goddamned morning person like Sam was. There's like a good twenty minutes of blessed silence and coffee consumption before Castiel speaks.
" The exclamation is high and clear as Cas reaches down his pants and fucking grabs him, the motion of thumb over his weeping crown and the first pump almost simultaneous.
So when Cas came home that evening,  Dean was waiting at their kitchen island.
." He hates himself for the way his voice cracks on the last word just cause the damned angel shifted on his feet. He blinks, tilting his head like he doesn't understand. "
"Fine." He blinks, opening his mouth to ask what is fine, when he's fucking impaled. The first stretch is just on the wrong side of the pleasure/pain fence, sparking discomfort like an itch and then glorious burn as he's thrust into, one long smooth action until the angel is pressed against his back and Dean is gasping, face against stone, wings spread, desperate for some kind of relief.
Cas actually snorts into his coffee before covering his mouth from bubbling laughter. Dean can feel a look of betrayal growing on his face.
"Dude why didn't you tell us? Jess and I sent you on dates. Just last week!" Sam sounds both happy and confused and Dean plays it off as best he can with a self-conscious laugh.
He doesn't need to add it would make it more enjoyable for him too, figures the bastard can do his basic assumptions for that. He's not expecting the way Castiel tenses and then he's squeaking as a fresh wave of that liquid rush from the angel fills him. His whole body shudders in reaction and he hears another quiet huff from the angel that sounds almost pained. There's a squelch as he shifts and then the uncomfortable sensation of leakage, trickling escape that makes Dean gape into the bed.
Cas just keeps fucking watching, looking more and more awake before Dean even brings him his first cup of coffee. When he does bring Cas his cup, he's so goddamn swollen it's practically at Cas' eye-level and he doesn't
“My name is Castiel. Dean? I’ll make you coffee if you want but you can’t sleep here.” He offers as a bribe, hoping the random awkwardness of the gesture might drive him away. Instead, bright green eyes pop open and the guy gives him what can only be called puppy-eyes.
'Cept it was an erogenous zone, that had sent the spark flaring through his blood that woke him up.
"I am Castiel. We are leaving. Now." Dean frowned, a little perplexed because the last Binding he'd heard of had been consummated publicly. Here he was looking forward to Raphael's sour face having to watch another of his underlings mate a demon and instead he's getting dragged out of the ritual chamber by this deceptively weak looking vessel.
His soft, ragged exhale sounds like a shout in the silence as Cas lets go and rolls over, burrowing into the comforter.
you." His hand hesitates before coming to Dean's neck, two fingers pushing between skin and his Heavenly collar, pulling him down.
“Hi internet. I’m Sam, this is my brother Dean.” He gives a sickly smile when Sammy nudges him and waves like a fucking nerd. “We’re giving the asparagus molded salad a try! I’m really into trying new ways to eat vegetables...I usually do shakes and I’m really curious about this because it seems to me like an interesting medium…”
Dean almost creeps down the stairs and steels himself to head down the hallway into the kitchen. He can hear Sam and see Jess at the table with Cas...and fuck, his mom's there too.
All he has to do is tilt, strain his eyes and he's got a profile of a strong jawline, a cute little butt-chin, gently pursed lips, the edge of one eye (blue!) - and then
"It's, umm, Cas? Castiel. My uhh, new roommate." And Dean gives him mom and Sam such a weak grin that he wonders how they don't call bullshit right away.
"It doesn't matter. I'm
Whatever angry retort was about to fly from Cas stalls and he inhales a deep breath after a moment, speaking with forced calm. "I didn't mean..." His voice trails off and that gets Dean's attention. Cas is looking at the comforter fisted in his hands as he continues to speak. "I
He just gets a long-suffering look before Cas levels a serious, pensive look on him. "We have alcohol here. You bought three different types of eggnog too. Don't you think that's enough?"
He's unwinding, letting it go and congratulating himself on how he and Cas have sold this story and he can probably keep up the fiction indefinitely as they live together. Dean is unsuspecting as dessert comes, his mom's apple pie and laughing at something Sam's said when Cas' hand lands pretty high on his thigh and squeezes.
So continuing the Meet Cute prompts, 'Dean is at the park working out while his dog is in the run when Castiel’s dog ends up in his shirt and Castiel has to help get him out' (Lily) + 'Castiel wants to meet the artist behind the beautiful craftsmanship of the bench in the dog park gazebo… turns out it’s Dean!' (KhajitTink)
When Dean wakes he can remember that face.
"FUCK!" Hips off the bed and he's coming so hard he sees fucking galaxies. His own cry sounds echo-y, distant to the feel of hot, wet strips of cum on his stomach and chest. "Shit!" It's a pitchy, distressed shriek because he's sensitive everywhere, feels like one big nerve ending with his fingers still stuck in the clamp of his ass muscles and Castiel fucking rubbing his oil gland. Dean whines when he lets go and it feels like his orgasm finally ends.
he's thick. He squeezes firmly and then a little harder looking up at Cas but all he gets is an eyebrow. "Is this thing on?"
“Do you have to go right now?’ The big blue eyes look hurt as Shelly ties her flimsy negligee robe and gestures at what she’s doing in the kitchenette of her apartment. “I was making us breakfast?”
Cas' eyes are shuttered in his neutral expression and Dean nods wordlessly. Cas inhales, hitches on a polite little smile, and breathes out. It's creepy how with his exhale, all the coldness seems to go out of his eyes.
"I will, reforge, you Dean." Cas' arms under his thighs and he's bending him forward as he comes in close. "You will not be unchanged by this."
"Fucking hell."
Fuck. It's nice.
"Cas - man, shit. We did. We
Castiel talks about the type of weed he tried this week before he started his food review, Sky OG, and the effect it’s having on him. Dean imagines he’s usually a very put together and proper dude and honestly, apart from an increasing talkativeness and a more fervent energy than he usually has, Castiel seems mostly unaffected.
Castiel damn near spills his coffee on himself sputtering as he stares at the guy fishing for his personal information. Expression still peeled Dean waits as Castiel finally has a taste.
Good morning, post is coming out today instead of tomorrow due to a life-engagement but the following chapter will be as usual, two weeks on from tomorrow - unless it's ready early enough for *next* Tuesday.
"...I burn water so Dean is the one who cooks. He's quite good at it. But then again, I've been told I'm not picky by my own brother. So maybe my standards are just really low." He pulls out a chair at the kitchen table that's facing where Sam and Dean are talking, so when Dean swivels to check on him he's met with a deadpan stare. "Really low."
"So for you this is more sensation than pleasure?" Cas tilts his head for a moment like he's considering before nodding slowly.
He should invest in a baseball bat for his bedroom, Castiel thinks with a dash of wry amusement as the best thing he has in here, ends up being his rather heavy textbook. It’s that or the golden lava lamp at his bedside and he’s rather fond of that, with the tiny bee decals he has stuck on it.
The feeling of feathers over the delicate inner lining of his wing on Cas' side makes Dean shiver.
Who is looking back at him with the most perfectly blank expression he's ever seen. It lasts another ten seconds until he inhales, closing his eyes and breathes out slowly.
"Cas..." Dean pants it, lust heavy in his gut with his cock in Cas' hand - but despite how aroused he is, the long strokes begin to chafe. "Please!"
The white feathers of the angel's wings ruffle before settling, domed over Dean's. Thankfully he doesn't try to move and Dean can swallow the sob that almost escaped and try to breathe himself into relaxing. He's stretched so fucking full it would be amazing if he were even just a little wetter.
My wonderful beta for this one is evie2268 - thank you! <3
He's hauled up, insult to injury that the Seraph's vessel isn't even as tall as him, both arms clasped and shaken once for good measure.
-----
"Asshole!"
"I'm going to assume this isn't a hide the body type issue. Not unless you already changed your clothes and avoided bringing any evidence home. In which case, kudos."
Other dude was standing in the doorway, almost blocking it with his body and an arm as earnest-looking tanned dude started to stutter out his plea.
What better way to control the chaotic Demons of Hell than to Bind them to the emotionless, incorruptible Angels? The most dangerous are bound to Seraphim, the warriors below the Archangels, powerful enough to control their Charges. The tether can go both ways though - so Dean decides to make his Angel feel it.
(Shifted awkwardly, gasped a few times, excused himself to the bathroom to will away an erection...yeah. Ignored it.)
"It's - I'm..., Dean." The hand that clamps around his arm is no bigger than his own but he feels it down to his bones. "Ow, ow, fuck ow!"
"How do you what?" He's curious, turns his head to look at Cas' profile that seems shadowed, darkened now even in the bright sunlight.
"...I just wanted to walk on my own without feeling like a sack." He looks down and away, brings his own wings down submissively and goes quiet. The ploy seems to work because when the hand comes back to his arm, he isn't pulled again until he gains his feet. He manages to stay quiet only minutes, frustrated with walking in silence. "Where are we going?"
He snorts a sound, waving feathers away from them both.
He flinches away from Cas like a scalded cat and whirls on his mom.
How are they supposed to pretend to be together? Dean can't even look at Cas, and Cas is avoiding him.
"You're so good angel. Cas." Dean rocks hard, grinding himself down onto the cock inside him and then Castiel groans. Selfish, he takes that too and is kissing Cas, slow and deep when his knot catches and he floods him. Swallows his sigh and delights in how his wings shiver and fluff.
It was all that plus some serious unresolved sexual tension between Dean and Cas according to, basically, everyone.
“Hey! Don’t touch him!” He’s still brandishing the tome two-handed - it would be quite a clocking he gave the guy if he hit him but he was too far away - and he tries to look threatening standing in pajama pants and a ratty T-shirt. The guy sitting in his chair is staring at him wide-eyed and Castiel has to focus his attention away from the blinking, confused green eyes checking him over.
The next hour is a pleasant, happy blur. A bunch of other twenty and thirty-somethings are crammed into this bar too, enjoying Christmas Eve before the hectic rush of tomorrow. Dean enjoys his fair set of attention and preens under it but doesn't leave Cas. It's easy to get any attention off Cas too when he's facing him, and they're huddled together conspiratorial, with Dean's legs tangled with his on his bar stool.
"Hey there's meat too. Not just the casserole, so there's no need to hide in there." Jess' voice draws him out and he tries to regulate his breathing and act normal as he walks in.
It's bad enough that things are tense without Sam drawing attention to it.
Cas slows once they're through the door and then starts to give resistance, planting his heels as Dean stalks the length of the bathroom for an empty stall. Only two are in use actually but he goes to the end for the disabled and sends an apology out to the universe because he's about to be 'that' asshole - but this is an emergency.
He swallows the sound that comes with the discomforting twitch of arousal and buries the last twenty seconds mentally, buries it in the deepest grave he can find.
"Come on Cas." And it's easy to drag him from the cab, pulling with two hands clinging to Castiel's before he turns on his heel with a smile as something warm floods his chest at how Cas looks at their hands.
Though was Pada the hostage or the guy stuck under him still seemingly trying to not touch said cat. He was wiggling forward in the chair, trying to urge the cat off by moving but all Pada did was shift his body and look back into the man’s face with a demanding reprimand.
"You're a little shit." But he's still smiling as he walks up to Cas and snatches his drink petulantly. Cas smiles indulgently.
He'll stop this on New Year, Dean swore to himself.
"...I hurt you." Castiel had been watching him, eagle-eyed the entire time and when he shows and  wriggles his slick coated fingers, says that.
Dean doesn't sleep every night, a side effect of his job Castiel assumes. Quite apart from terror at the reality of monsters in their world, Dean takes on the mantle of being a hero, of being responsible for the rest of ignorant humanity and
ignoring you. I felt we needed some... distance."
Dean doesn’t even hear the soft grunt he makes but then Sam turns to look at him with a suspicious squint before he gives him bitchface number #17 ‘ewwdeanwtf’.
“If someone sleeps over with me then I’m in a relationship. Therefore it’s not a ‘morning after’”. Dean stares after Castiel does his one-handed air quote and then goes into peels of laughter. “What?!” He’s embarrassed and offended and anxious he’s being laughed at until Dean swallows his  mirth, expression effervescent.
"It's very you." Dean squints, not quite sure what that means. "Classic."
Jesus Christ he hadn’t locked his door!
“Don’t judge me! He’s hot - when he isn’t eating things that make me wanna barf.” Dean pulls his laptop back in close to him defensively and plugs his headphones back in. He’s missed everything since the first forkful went into those sinful lips but this is the part he really likes to watch anyway.
Dean watches from the kitchen table with a moue of disgust. Ugh, it wasn’t even that it was vegetable. There was some weird lemony aftertaste and Dean smacks his lips, rubbing his tongue on the roof of his mouth. His mouth tasted weird.
"Of course! Oh, you've got to come back when you can. We usually try to get together every Sunday if you're not doing anything when Dean's coming. It's a good chance to get a home-cooked meal." Dean sees when Cas' smile turns brittle and feels terrible.
“I like my coffee black with a little sugar.” Dean enunciates it carefully, pointedly, while Castiel nods and wonders if the alcohol had a resurgence because he does not get the joke. However, he preps two cups - his with a splash of milk - and takes them back into the living area.
"Fuck, don't! Lucifer! Again." Dean babbles. This was torture. This one was a torturer!
Cas."
"So first time huh?" The one wing he can see on the side his head is turned is suddenly ruffled, fluffed feathers and Dean smirks.
"Stop being, so difficult!" There's the slightest edge of annoyance in Castiel's voice like Dean has finally gotten under his skin. He gets him on his stomach so they can both spread their wings across the bed and then Castiel settles with a disgruntled huff.
"Do not!" Probably a bad thing to smite face him during sex because all it does is make Dean hotter. He bucks his hips up, hurtling from excited to frenzied instantly.
"A private room was delegated to us." Okay so yes, a prude. He barely resists rolling his eyes but makes a sound of non-committal boredom. "It is not much further."
"O-Of course. Uhh." He loves his mother more than he can say as she stands up. Cas releases him to go help. He's still shell-shocked when Sam fucking smirks at him.
Benny's had been a bust from the start before they even made it to dinner because when Dean went to pick her up he found out she had a kid - too much, too fast, not his thing right now.
In the morning, bright and early at seven, Castiel messages the number left in his book.
Dean." He's hauled up, both of them dressed again in a blink and Cas gestures around them. "We just set off an unnatural event that is going to be felt for miles around by humans. I would not be surprised if 'corrections' angels were to come soon so let us not be here."
"What are you showing him!" All three of them turn to look at him and he ignores Sam's smug face and his mother's slightly guilty smile in favor of Cas' grin.
They just stand there staring at each other for a few moments while Cas calms down. When he releases a long sigh out, Dean lets go of his upper arms and squeezes his shoulder instead.
"You did great. It's sold. Let's never darken this doorway again." Dean reverses as Cas settles in to be a grump with his phone and puts on Led for the drive home.
And even though his body doesn't bother to follow through, he can't get back to sleep.
"Yeah Cas." He says it before he even lays hands on him, says it again when Cas hesitates at the waist of his sweats and murmurs 'is this okay', because of course it is. It's awesome.
"Uhh... don't think so." He goes frowny again and Dean casts out. "But it sounds nice? I could, try it?"
The atmosphere is intense. Dean feels like he's putting on a burlesque show or a strip tease and Cas is eating it up. It should not have Dean feeling like he could pound nails with his dick.
You can tell a lot about a person by how they treat wait staff okay?
So Dean spills the story he told his mom and Sam. About how there had been a connection when they'd met about the apartment and Dean had described Cas in only the most flattering way - how professional and prepared he'd been, how he'd been honest and straightforward, how Cas had opened himself up to examination and inquiry as if he was the one offering a place to stay.
"Dean." And Cas sounds happy, pleased, relieved as he sweeps him into a kiss with a hand clasped on his bare throat. Without stopping. Just hips thrusting and lips taking and Dean breaks a little in return.
He doesn't tell Sam because there's nothing to tell. Is he supposed to complain 'cause he feels good when he wakes up now? That he's actually sleeping through the night?
Comments loved, kudos welcome!
A fucking romantic this one. Dean smirks and flops onto the feather covered bed in indolent repose. He ticks one eyebrow up and gives his best 'come-hither' look.
Dean squeaks out a moan and then is gaping wide-eyed at Jess across the table from him, as he goes an embarrassing shade of red.
“Oh!” And Dean looks shocked, shocked and pleased as Castiel drinks another sip of coffee, blushing and self-satisfied. “Right. Well, I feel very awake now.” With a nervous cough, Dean stands, a pink tinge to his cheeks. “Umm…”
“Goodbye Dean.” The dry tone and irritated but reluctantly amused expression has Dean opening the door for the guy and Castiel brushes past with one last look before going on his way as Dean steps out behind him.
Cas groans, fumbles his pajama bottoms enough down his thighs to get his cock free and slots himself between Dean's thighs and rocks, harsh quick thrusts that jostle Dean into the door. He's still flying himself and he helps Cas with groaned encouragement against the shell of his ear. Dean urges Cas on until he whines into the skin at his throat and grates out his name and dampens Dean's sweats again.
"If I can. It's been lovely to meet you all though. We should go. Unfortunately, I have an early day tomorrow. Come on, Dean." He's the one scrambling after Cas like a puppy and he snatches a long hug from his mom, glaring at Sam and Jess as he leaves.
Plus his brother’s right here.
He's licking his lips when he pulls away from Cas' mouth. The angel looks dazed, fucked out, wild hair and wide blue eyes. Dean smirks at him and rolls his hips again.
"We haven't broken up?" The story, the plan, because technically Dean was supposed to have broken up with Cas but...
Dean sees
“I’m sorry man. That’s rough if you liked him… and now you still have to work with him.” The cynical chuckle that gets makes Dean wince, the coldness gives him an idea of what Mr. Workmate was going to be subjected to. “You can think what you want about casual sex but the way I do it, I don’t go breaking people’s hearts. I don’t doubt that guy at least had an idea you liked him.”
Shelly had been someone he just met at a bar and went home with. If this guy didn’t do pick ups that meant he had ended up in bed with someone he probably liked and just been dropped like a sack of potatoes after being used.
“... wouldn’t mind going out with you again - umm, if you want to call me -” Whoever deep-voiced guy is down the hall with his coat rolled up in his hand and his tie hanging crooked off him, he’s dead out of luck. The guy shoots him down quickly and closes the door and Dean gets back to his own self-extraction.
"Fuck me. Come
"Dean," Cas' voice is all deep warning that he blows through, stepping in and physically pulling Cas like a stubborn sack into the larger stall with him before closing the door and engaging the lock behind him. "Dean."
Dean is working out when he suddenly finds himself with a dog in his shirt. How that leads to a date only Chuck knows.
It takes Cas maybe three seconds, before his eyes narrow and he sits up, suddenly much too close to Dean.
There's one knock and a not-so-delicate cough from behind the door that makes them both freeze. "Your brother wants to know if the batter in the fridge was for French toast." Jess inquires with almost inhuman politeness, voice full of choked laughter. He can hear her snickers fade as she walks away.
He darts forward, faster than he seems despite being all muscled body, wings, claws and fanged grin. Castiel takes the hit of his weight like a champ and they go down in a tangle of thrashing wings, flailing arms and grunts. Surprise gets him enough of an advantage to swipe raking lines across the vessel's left pectoral, pleased with the red of shredded flesh and tissue even if it hardly bleeds. One arm is already trapped and it's his hesitation to go for the face, he likes the face the Seraph has, that costs him the mobility of his arms.
So what if fighting got him a little hot under the holy collar? He didn't expect prude angel to know. But he does. Angel's aren't the only ones with oil production glands and the free hand on stone-face is freaking squeezing his gland until he squeals - he'll deny it!, and the release is a relief, right up until his sopping hand is between Dean's cheeks, two firm fingers at his hole.
"I feel fucking fake." Cas walks around the car and stands before him, deadpan. Dean smiles weakly.
He looks at Dean’s hand, brows drawing together cutely as he looks confused. When he looks up he tilts his head at Dean who just arches an eyebrow and waits.
coming home. The idea of Cas, out with someone else, already hurts more than it should.
. They had to do that again.
But then it's after one am on Wednesday and people are stumbling into the house, too many feet to be just Cas. Dean reaches under his pillow for the knife he keeps there (long story), and sits up as they come down the hallway, but then he hears Cas' voice, ragged and hoarse and low as sin.
"Ahhh...fuck!" Good, good, good! Got his sweet spot by accident and he's rolling his hips into it now. Dean squeezes his eyes shut and fingerfucks himself a little harder, hoping to graze that spot again just right because he thinks he can fucking pop off from just that.  He's not expecting the restraining hand on his shoulder that almost breaks his rhythm, shifts the trajectory of his fingers - just fucking right!- or the lots-less-painful-but-still-quite-intense squeeze of Castiel's fingers at the nub of his right wing gland.
Dean gulps, before beginning to work his hips up against his fingers. It should be perfunctionary...but instead it feels like he's getting off. He adds another finger and can feel himself leaking onto his own pelvis and if he twists a bit more he can probably hump the bed, come with Cas watching him...
"I want to finish Cas."
Dean gestures at himself dramatically and when Sam only squints, points at his face. Where he’s feeling hot-skinned and itchy and he doesn’t need to see to know he’s starting to get hives.
“Ha, ha. No. Fuck you Sammy.”
"Damn angel." He swallows around how slurred he sounds and shifts his hips teasingly. Then he realizes Cas isn't even in him. "Wait, what... the Hell?"
The first kiss is hot, hungry and Dean moans into it, his hands fumbling now because Cas is drinking his concentration out through his mouth in increasingly forceful kisses.
The good thing about being Bound - okay, the other good thing apart from the sex - since you had your own personal angel to track you, the Heavenly Host on a whole tended to not mind you so closely.
He wouldn't have planned it that way at all - if only to spare himself discomfort - but the thing is, it worked. Sam sent him texts about Cas all week to torment him, and his mom had asked what Cas' favourite food was for the following weekend. Despite his utter mortification, Castiel's smooth plays had worked.
"What?" His voice still sounds remarkably even, inflection-less in the question and Dean looks over his shoulder, glaring heatedly, pupils blown.
"I'll face them first. You should... go clean up." It comes out a low rasp as Cas' eyes work over him again. He wants to laugh and say 'you do love me' - ends up in Cas' orbit again and if he's allowed... he presses a kiss to Cas’ reddened mouth that's less hungry and more grateful.
?" His voice goes flatter, a warning if Dean's ever heard one, and Dean barrels through it.
Another inhale and whimpery moan. Dean blinks languidly, smiles slow for Cas straddled on top of him.
"Dude!" Sam screeches as his mother gets up and pulls Cas with her by the hand, and Cas gives Dean a smug look over his shoulder before going off with his mother.
That splutters him into full blown laughter before he darts forward and stops Cas' retreat to change. "No! Cas it's..." He pulls on his arm. "No. You...you're fine. You clean up...great." His laughter trails away and he looks his roommate over as Cas glowers suspiciously.
"You guys need to stop trying to find dates for me." That part had been fine. "I'm already seeing someone." That part was not.
They become locked in some staring battle of wills and Dean is who breaks, eyes downcast as he blushes.
"Hold your tongue!" Oh. He is dropped unceremoniously in the middle of the corridor and treated to a look to level cities while dark blue eyes lit with righteousness promise him damnation if he so much as squeaks. He feels Castiel like atmosphere, heavy on him with the pressure of his Grace, the one pair of wings on this vessel spread wide and high.
He sits back down on the bar stool and feels like he lost something.
"Uhh, yeah." A note creeps into Sam's voice and he stares harder at the table. Castiel is just as silent, almost somber beside him and Jess, bless her heart cuts the tension and starts passing around the serving dishes.
He does not deserve that trust, Dean thinks as heat floods his body, twitching his cock to life. "Come on."
He could tell Mom and Sam he lied and have them feel even more worried about him and determined to get him hooked up with someone. He could only imagine that conversation. There was no way to avoid it because it wasn't like he could claim he and his 'boyfriend' broke up a fucking week after they were 'official'. Shit...
He walks past Castiel and puts his cup down on the side table, next to his Anthro book. Somehow a stub of a pencil fits into the pocket of his snug fitting jeans because he pulls one out and proceeds to scribble something on the first page.
good and then Dean whines again because the fucker almost pulls out.
Dean is gaping, jaw hanging as he leans forward into the laptop screen. If he fucking eats that…
They feel so right, that day Dean wakes excited enough that Sam can tell he's in a good mood. However it only lasts as long as straining his mind to remember more,
Cas is rocking peach fuzz after not having shaved for a couple of days - it somehow works on him, and scruffy and half asleep he's kind of adorable.
"It's all charm and personality up here. The riff-raff don't have fun like us!" He flexes his claws but keeps his stance loose, un-threatening. "What rank are you in the Seraphs then?"
He's in their shared space, thumping on the pillows of the rather nice over-sized bed, when suddenly Castiel is there, back stone-faced and squinty.
Also Castiel is apparently coming again because there's wet splashing on his ass and the back of his thighs.
“Uh - it’s… my textbook for Anthropology.” Castiel is standing awkwardly now, posture relaxed and huge book weighty in a one handed grip. He was now casually chatting to the B&E when he should be calling the police, because this guy still looked too comfortable in his chair holding his cat hostage.
"Dean!" His mother admonishes with an appalled expression.
“That is unappetizing looking.” His brother says, completely serious.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Yeah Cas. I get you were trying to prove we're going to have to do a bit more to convince my family and I don't think we need to do half of what you did at the bar so we're good." Dean spits it out, defensive. "I can do this."
"I have a question for you Dean. How exactly do you plan to pull off being a month into a relationship with a man you live with?" The question lingers for a moment. "Because if we managed to sell that we weren't physically involved before..."
right.
." Cas looks blown and Dean smiles, a tremulous, untethered expression of pleasure, fingers grasping Cas' skull, fisting his hair. It's good, it's good, it's so fucking good, Jesus Cas just....! He's babbling in breathless cries, gasping Cas' air in their nearness, light-headed and ecstatic and spiralling higher and higher until he snaps beautifully.
"Hey Dean." He can't help the wide grin that breaks over his face when Sam looks out of the kitchen down the hall.
"Dude," Dean says it, aggravated and baffled. "How exactly am I supposed to have a good time with my family with you acting like a goddamn asshole?" Cas looks over his shoulder, narrowing his eyes and leveling a cold stare at him, but Dean is officially done.
He finally does what he's been putting off and starts researching monsters that are involved with dreams.
He gets a head tilt, eerie. The blue eyes squint before the Seraph answers. "I am sixteenth among my brethren. Twenty-third in the Heavenly host."
was the timebomb but now...
and gasps back a Breath of Life, thrashing suddenly back into being.
He realizes what it is when he wakes the next morning and Cas is already gone, the coffee pot still unused on the counter. When Cas doesn't come home after work, he's up until eleven o'clock before he figures he
"Ouuhh-ha! Uhhh..." Dean shudders, eyes squeezed closed because that was - fuck that was good. Good burn, stretch, right fucking there, just like that. He whines a little when the angel strokes all the way in and his body clenches on his fingers. Well shit.
"Your face is classic." Dean grumbles and is rewarded with Cas' tiny smile. "Dude I don't know why you even bothered with the gel if you were just gonna fuck it up again. Hold this."
Comments loved, kudos welcome!
The noise that comes out of him is just tortured and Cas watches him squirm and turn red, sipping his coffee. Dean's about to do something embarrassing and irrevocable, like adjust his hard on and let Cas see and say some other smart-assed comment Dean could return with more innuendo and see where it went... and goddamn Sam walks in.
"What?" Dean snaps. He's annoyed and embarrassed beyond belief, and Castiel was going to rue the day...
He wouldn't even be awake in the middle of the night if... if that delicate hand, hadn't traced a finger tip along the curve of his ear. So light it was almost intangible.
"Nothing. Man, I'm just…nervous too, I guess? I want you to like Cas?" Dean swallows and gives Sam what feels like a half panicked look. "I dunno...shit."
And he proceeds to shut his eyes!
"You still want to do this?" Cas says flatly, his frown so fierce it wrinkles between his brows.
He’s missed a few seconds of what Castiel said and uses the touchpad to drag the tracker back a bit.
"Aww Dean." There's an affectionate mockery in his tone that makes him flush uncomfortably, up to his neck. "Baby bath photo - Mary said you kept your flower bather as a binkie." There's laughter in his tone and Dean feels the blush creeping higher.
"You told your family you were dating your roommate and now they want to meet me next Sunday." Cas nods once definitively and levels his morning smite face at Dean. "Is that right?"
do?" He gives an unamused snort and leans against the balustrade of the stairs. "I didn't do anything to him!"
"They, my superiors, Raphael... have decreed you be unbound, from me." Castiel whispers it, grave, flat-toned."Gabriel only has one Bound to him. He can handle another as an Archangel." Dean meanwhile is flabbergasted, disbelieving. So he had one tiny indiscretion and they're 'removing' him from Cas? "I failed my duty."
It was just that... something felt different. The kitchen incident in particular, as he had taken to calling it in his head, had been some hormonal outlier. Dean assumed it was leftover, pent up need from what had only been a frantic handie that had spilled over. They had returned home and one thing had led to another... It had felt unavoidable even in the moment, overcharged with Cas in his face, blue eyes darkened, asking again if he wanted this - like he would ever say no!
The past two weeks have actually been, more than tolerable, Dean admits as he rolls out of bed and pulls on pants. Apart from a clash of music taste and Cas' absolute lack of knowledge of anything pop culture, the company isn't half bad.
come to one of their LARPing sessions, just to hear Dean have to answer to 'Handmaiden'. He likes what they've got going, this easy companionship that doesn't
It wasn't that he didn't want to have sex with Cas because, Jesus if Thanksgiving weekend had done anything for him it had opened up a universe of possibility with Cas firmly at the center.
Cas gets out and shuts the door of the Impala with more force than necessary making Dean glare across the car.
Chapter One
“...you know what? Sure. Enjoy your niece's birthday party.” Sadness turns to disappointed irritation in an instant and Dean winces as the door is slammed in his face.
"None of my business what you do by the way but pretty sure you've spoken more to whoever the hell he was than you have to
"What did
Probably definitely, Dean agrees silently. He's kind of angry on Cas' behalf, sad for him. "Well, it may not be the same but I guess you can feel, pleasure at making me satisfied?" He gives Cas a hesitant smile and gets a small one in return. "I like this a lot." Dean squeezes tight around the base of his cock and thumbs at Cas' head again. "You in me."
"I can hear you thinking something at me Dean, but I'm not actually a mind reader."
'Roommate. New roommate.' It was just Novak, getting himself 'breakfast' before heading out probably. Dean flops onto his back again, attaining sleep again probably a lost cause as he thinks about joining Castiel for coffee.
"I may be back late tonight." Sometimes he's still caught off guard when that voice comes out of that package. Cas looks like he should be a reclusive nerd, slight and messy-haired and with squinted vision when he wasn't wearing his contacts or glasses that made Dean suspect he was short sighted. However apart from being slightly taciturn, Cas was alright. The dude sounds though like he gargles rocks and smokes a pack a day, in a damned good way. He brushes off the jolt at Cas' pronouncement with that voice and waves a hand negligibly, taking his coffee with him to his home office nook. It's just a corner of their open space living room though so Cas can still hear him when he calls out.
"You..." Dean swallows. "You'd do it?" Cas' face is artfully blank as he answers.
Now, he's here half naked in his house with a guy he met two weeks ago - who he happens to know from Charlie is gay. Charlie had felt that was something Dean should know in case it made him uncomfortable, which it didn't. He had appreciated the heads-up though it wasn't needed - Cas himself had said it like it was nothing to him during their first meeting to feel each other out. But back on track, he's here half naked in his house with a guy he met two weeks ago and even from the first time they'd stumbled into each other in the hallway the first morning, Dean in a towel and Cas in boxers, he hadn't felt like meat.
"Everything works out, though. I'm a bit of a neat freak, so I take care of most of the cleaning and laundry. Dean does the cooking and makes sure I don't burn the place down. He also avoids me in the morning, so that's excellent too." That sounded believably nice and Dean's kind of happy when his mom looks like she's enjoying Cas' company as they keep talking. He turns back to Sam and lets the conversation filter in the background as they talk about Cas' job and what he does in his free time.

The admission should make him feel better but only looses the hurt that had been curled up heavy in his chest.
A deep baritone, gravelly-low that speaks to him but Dean can never remember what it says.
It's a twisting reach for his own wing gland and while the spark of pleasure pain from Castiel's grope there had been enlightening, he couldn't make himself squeeze that hard. He massages, rolling his shoulder into it and sighs at the oily release that drips onto his fingers. Going like that gets him a lot more and he's almost relaxed, loose-muscled by the time his fingers are coated enough.
It's instantaneous, the crack of thunder that rolls over them and into the distance as Castiel's wings manifest, all six, high in their position of dominance. For the first time in his life, Dean feels his wings get slick wet from his weeping oil glands. He feels punched breathless when Cas leans down to him, eyes beginning to glow.
"It's just my mom and Sam. S'not like a holiday so..." He swivels Cas bodily and hustles him down the hallway to the front door. "You look great. It's all fine."
, before Sam and his mother had even considered a change of topic. The lies he'd told,
“Dude… we can make a reply video to that guy you watch.” Sam wheedles and Dean hates that he pauses then.
He's breathing a bit hard as he steps into Cas' space and anticipation and lust are fucking blinding because he's got hands on Cas' buckle, ripping through button and zipper before he even thinks to tilt his head up and get Cas' mouth.
He has no idea how it's going to impact their ability to be roommates and best friends but at the very least this development would add some pretty awesome perks to their fake boyfriends arrangement - after all, sex could cover 'boyfriends' or friends with benefits.
The hour in the car is torture. He plays music and keeps his eyes on the road as Cas buries himself in a book. They've exchanged one word in over twenty-four hours and Dean doesn't think his one greeting counts as an exchange.
“No sleep-overs? You? Lies.” Dean’s eyes shine over his cup and Castiel is red-cheeked as he finally sits on the love seat next to a dozing Padawan.
It should only take a half hour tops to set up Sam’s cellphone to record the container in front of the two chairs they’ve pushed together plus change clothes to clean up a bit to look nice on the internet… but Dean dawdles, changes his shirt three times, decides to put some mousse in his hair.
Onward to the story!
“You from K.U? I honestly can’t place your age… but an Anthropology Bachelor's dude?” Dean’s head lolls and he stares, piercing right across the distance between them. Castiel fidgets, makes himself move pulling out cups - might as well have one too! - and getting sugar and milk as he speaks.
Cas was kind of a gentleman about it even, shorter maybe two inches he had flicked his gaze down Dean's body only as far as his chest and complimented his tattoo before easing his way around him in the hallway. Dean's ego isn't inflated, he knows people find him attractive. But that common decency to not objectify him from the get-go had been appreciated to a degree he couldn't explain.
This, Dean had wanted this, he thinks, sitting on a bar stool with Cas next to him, leaned into his space smelling cologne and just Cas, as blue eyes darken and his smile widens slowly. He's barely tipsy cause he'd been nursing his two whiskeys before, he's sure, but when he says something that gets a soft laugh - the bare hint of a chuckle, but he can see teeth and Cas' head is tilted back, eyes shut... something in Dean's chest explodes.
His roommate very obediently holds his beer while Dean tries to fix his hair into some state of general public normalcy. Every attempt to get it to lie flat again fails so in the end, Dean just tries to get it into some artistic flips. He's really not aware of how close they are until Cas speaks and he can feel his breath on his face.
He's putty, desperate already, so he barely croaks a weak protest when suddenly the angel huffs into his neck, heating the skin around his Binding collar and a foreboding swelling start just past the rim of his anus. "Oh...my...GUHHH!" There's the tiniest of stutters in Castiel's movements, a soft hitched breath and then a shuffle of their bodies that pushes Dean, unforgiving, into the wall. "Huh!"
The guy’s brows furrow, his lips pursing and Dean’s magnetized, his eyes get drawn there too and Dean’s marking all these new things about this guy that are attractive, reeled in. He’s got a cleft in his chin Dean would worship with his teeth.
"Pressure. Heat." Castiel squints down at him curiously. "It is not much different from a very firm hand except the texture and complete compression. Slightly warmer."
What better way to control the chaotic Demons of Hell than to Bind them to the emotionless, uncorruptible Angels? The most dangerous are bound to Seraphim, the warriors below the Archangels, powerful enough to control their Charges. The tether can go both ways though - so Dean decides to make his Angel feel it.
"Well? What's his name? How'd you meet?" Dean looks into Sammy's hazel eyes that are full of joy for him and feels like an asshole. He hunches his shoulders and looks down at the table, knowing he's digging himself into a hole and now is the time to escape...
Just the embarrassment of remembering his thigh being squeezed or the hand on his lower back could make Dean flush enough that, for the next two weeks as he made excuses for Cas dodging family get-togethers, they still bought that he and Cas were a thing. But it was the week before Thanksgiving now, and his mother was adamant that Cas make an appearance.
Comments welcomed and kudos loved! <3
"Yeah I do." The troubled expression that lands before Castiel seems to steel himself shouldn't make him feel bad. "Look... I can prep myself first if you want to just get to the..."
"Here." He clears his throat after putting the cup down and appreciates Cas' eyes staying resolutely
Cas whispers it out, ragged in a husky breath and Dean breathes out a 'yeah' in reply.
He's aware of Cas looking at him several times, and every time he tries to smile weakly. Cas is the one now keeping the story afloat because Dean is freaking the fuck out.
He chews furiously, trying to get to swallowing quickly, but it is like jello and he twists his face into misery before just going for it, tilting his head back and taking it down. Dean makes a face at Sam’s phone, where their stream is going out and sticks his tongue out.
(Cas has a time-stamp mini-story for his issues with Dean that may be needed to spell out that Uber seduction...that will be posted eventually XD)
"You're ruining it."
Dean flushes and looks away, feeling exposed in the moment. This is his reality now. He and Cas are attracted to each other. He just had sex with his best friend in his mother's house on Thanksgiving.
