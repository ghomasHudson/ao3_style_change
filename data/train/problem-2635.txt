“You still have no idea what I want, do you?” Castiel muses, moving a hand to wrap around the back of Dean’s neck. When Dean tries to pull back this time Castiel doesn’t let him; the gentle touch turns into steel, holding Dean in place as he starts to panic, pulling him further down until the head of Castiel’s cock pops back into Dean’s throat. He can’t breathe like this, he’s choking and Cas won’t budge even as Dean starts pushing and pummeling at him.
, he finally begs again. All Castiel does is snap his fingers and Dean is gone, sparking pleasure and throbbing relief echoing through his body as he spills and grinds into Sam. He’s vaguely aware of having slumped forward across Sam, and then of being moved; a burning hand on his shoulder, dick sliding free as Castiel pulls him upright and then leaves him to fall over on the grass, body still vibrating.
There’s a greenhouse nearby, fairly large and flush with living plants, long-leaf tropical shrubs and trees and flowers, orchids and blooming cacti, soft mosses and dangling vines. It’s beautiful, and humid, and devoid of weapons. It takes the better part of an hour to move Sam from the lawn where they arrived into the building; Sam stumbles and jumps at everything, leaning into Dean for support and nearly toppling them both, then trying to run away. Every instinct Dean has is telling him to pray to Cas and beg for help, because somehow his brain hasn’t quite caught on yet that they aren’t friends anymore and God, Sam needs help so badly. But this time Cas won’t come when Dean calls.
You do not get to say no.” The grip on his hair tightens painfully, and Dean can’t make a sound. “You do not get to rebel. You do not get to put
Only Castiel’s breathing betrays him. His hands are still on the armrests of the throne, his face is still impassive and unreadable, but Dean can hear the difference. He’s spent weeks listening, after all. One hand glides up to cover Castiel’s cock, and Dean starts squeezing and stroking, encouraging Castiel to full hardness. A low groan meets his efforts, and Castiel slides forward slightly in his seat. Bingo.
Sam is suffering and they’re alone. There’s no sign of Castiel. No food is left for them, no comfort; Dean spends his days watching Sam and finding plants that they can stomach from the gardens to fend off the hunger that still exists here, and his nights awake waiting for the screaming to start again, for Sam to wander off and need to be pulled back to safety. For all that they can’t die here, they’re not going to survive like this.
“How very like you,” Castiel finally looks at Dean, and Dean flinches away from the storm there. “You betray me, try to manipulate me out of fear while professing you care, and as soon as Sam is hurt you abandon all pretense of caring for me, your Lord and
Night spreads over the sky like ink in a well, and Dean shivers and shakes. He’s lost feeling in his legs and his hands have gone numb with cold. At some point he passes out, coming too with his face pressed into the gravel and light seeping in from the east. He takes the time to ease the feeling back into his limbs, to drink greedily from a nearby pond and relieve himself, and then he comes back before the doors and kneels again. The sun slowly washes over the building, pooling down onto the stone where he waits.
Castiel hushing Sam again, then, “Spread your legs for me, Sam.” Skin slick and wet and a pleased groan. Dean drops his head to the ground — he can still taste Cas on his tongue and nausea finally floods over him. God, what has he done.
. Dean grabs the shard again, it’s the only weapon he has, and charges forward to attack the angel violating his brother.
The sun is almost fully set, shadows chasing after the shape of the world. Castiel brushes the hair away from Sam’s eyes, crouching next to him with a small smile. He lays a hand on Sam’s shoulder, as if to be comforting, and Dean watches the clothes fade from Sam’s body; he’s left bare on the stone with Cas rubbing his back in small circles.
“Do you know what you have to do?” Castiel bites at the join of Dean’s neck and shoulder, and Dean shivers and humps forward into Cas’ hand instinctively.
The door creaks open and a chill seeps out. No light shines inside, and every instinct Dean has is screaming that this is a terrible idea and he should go back.
“Cas.” It’s a whisper, a plea as Dean sucks on his fingers to wet them and starts probing at Sam’s ass. “Make it stop, Cas, please.”
It’s obvious where Dean needs to go. Logical, in a horrifying fashion. If the pets are outside in the garden, the master must be in the house.
“Not now, Dean,” Castiel says absently. Sam looks at Dean in horror and twists away, only for Castiel to slam him back against the wall by the throat, closing the non-extant gap between them to pin him in place. He moves lazily once Sam stills, riding against Sam’s thigh. Dean is going to kill him. “Relax, Sam. I know you can be good for me.”
. Dean moves cautiously, heart in his mouth at the danger if Castiel objects to what he’s about to do. He leans forward and hesitantly places his hands on the tops of Castiel’s knees, sliding his thumbs up along the inside of Cas’ thighs; there’s a small inhale of breath, which Dean takes as a good sign.
The crushed stones make his bones ache, and the sun is relentless as it beats down on him, but Dean holds fast. That first day, Castiel told him what he wanted. Love faith and obedience. He told Sam to be good and let Castiel take what he wanted — be obedient. So Dean waits on his knees and begs silently for the chance to try and be good again.
— before turning to Sam. All he does is look, and Sam takes a shaky step backward, head jerking back and forth and eyes not focusing on anything and then he starts
A month ago Dean would have sworn they could fix this. Cas had been stubborn about his choices, so sure as he burned every bridge that he was doing the right thing, but he’d kept reaching out to the brothers. And now… it’s like Sam and the demon blood all over again. Something in the power Cas took in has changed him, but how do you get someone to understand that their head isn’t right? And how do you kill a God when they control everything? Everything they have in this garden is there because Castiel gave it to them, everything that’s missing is because he took it. Every weapon, every opportunity. Even the fact that they’re together instead of separated… it’s all by design.
“Didn’t mean to stab me in the back?” There’s fury underneath that coolness and Dean is on thin ice.
. “I haven’t touched him, Dean. I didn’t have to, not with you to push him out of safety.” Sam whimpers in counterpoint, and Cas tilts his head in detached curiosity. “Honestly I’m surprised he was able to make it here.”
” The words are Enochian, soft and stumbling like Sam learned them a long time ago. Dean leans his head against Sam’s and furiously blinks back tears of his own.
“You’ll find I am a merciful God, Dean. All I require from you — all I have ever required — is your love and faith and obedience.” Castiel snaps his fingers and Sam goes limp. “Don’t think disobedience, or
“What?” He doesn’t even look up from where he’s slouched against the wall, staring down at his hands.
“I told you to wait.” Rage deeper than the ocean stares back at Dean, the blank mask cracked and gone. “I know you understand how to follow orders. I’ve broken you to it before and I will do it again,
is a replacement for love, boy?” Castiel pulls Dean back far enough that he can look up and meet Cas’ gaze, so just the head of Cas’ cock lies hot and throbbing on his tongue. He doesn’t know the answer, he doesn’t
It takes time for Sam to come to. Longer until he recognizes who Dean is, and Dean is pretty sure he’ll never get over the look on Sam’s face when he first wakes up. His first panicked word was “Lucifer”, so that’s a fantastic sign.
“Cas please, he didn’t mean to.” There’s panic in Dean’s voice but he can’t really help it. Castiel is just watching like it doesn’t matter.
Castiel lets him go and sits back down on his throne. He’s still rumpled, skin sweat slick and with his dick hanging out; achingly human and entirely not. There’s something in his eyes that makes Dean shudder and look away, a deeper hunger that Dean doesn’t want to think about. “Go.”
A soft noise breaks the silence, something Dean can’t identify but it fills him with a quiet dread. He rounds the final corner; Castiel has returned, it seems. Dean doesn’t want to process what he’s seeing — he steps forward ready to swing, moving in a frozen rage, and goes flying backward into a pile of pottery and cacti. The breath leaves his body and reality sets in, one cut and scrape and detail at a time.
He’s pounding into Sam now, curled over his brother’s body and thrust thrust thrust, grind deep and beg to come.
“You did well.” Castiel is gentle in this, and Dean hates himself for finding comfort in the soft stroking motion. “It’s your decision if this happens again. Have you learned your lesson, Dean?”
Castiel huffs, a bitter chuckle. “So ready to sell your soul again, for him.” Dean can’t help but flinch at that barb, but he straightens and meets Cas’ gaze because yeah, actually. It’s
Sam is quiet, come morning. Doesn’t want to talk about it, or about the odd way he’s behaving. He accepts Dean’s summary of the previous day’s events way too fucking calmly. “Cas is God now” gets a frown and a nod, the lack of wildlife in their surroundings gets a “I’m not hungry anyways” (how enthusiastic is Dean allowed to get over four depressing words? It’s been a shitty
Castiel’s hand dips lower, stroking across Sam’s stomach, thumb running along the v of Sam’s adonis belt. Dean struggles upright, pushing to hands and knees when his legs still won’t support him. If he has to watch Castiel… the thought dies, taking the last shred of anger with it. Tears threaten his eyes, mercifully blurring what’s happening in front of him, but nothing blocks out the sounds.
“I left him a dream to live in, when I took down the wall. One last buffer between sanity,” Cas nods at Sam, “and this.”
Broken clay tears roughly through Dean’s palm and he sketches the ward to banish an angel on the stone floor. “I said,” he slams his bloody hand against it and the world whites out, “let him
All he can do is nod and bite back a noiseless sob when Castiel takes his hand away. Steps back and watches, clothed in nothing but fading color, hard and dripping and waiting in perfect stillness as Dean drives himself to the edge of infinity.
Castiel makes a noise of disgust and lets Dean go. And then he’s gone, filling the air with the sound of wings.
, Dean pleads silently as he maneuvers Sam over to the bench. Sam fights every inch of the way, fights to stay on his feet when Dean shoves him facedown, fights to get back up once Dean has him lying on the stone. Dean half-stands half-kneels over him, one knee wedged between Sam’s legs as he twists Sam’s arm until he cries and stops struggling. Dean flattens one hand against Sam’s back to hold him in place and starts pulling at his jeans with the other until they’re mid-thigh.
“What?” Dean stares at him in horror, filled to the brim with memories of what can be done to someone when death isn’t an option. Or when it isn’t allowed to be the end, when breath is forced back into a broken body. Hell has no end of horrors and it’s impossible for Dean not to hear the threat, not to imagine what’s going to happen to them both.
He looks up slowly and brings his hands to rest on his thighs. Castiel is a statue in front of him but that’s nothing new. He can do this.
Hands in his hair pulling him up just enough and air rushes in, sweet and bright and euphoric. Dean manages a few breaths before Castiel starts moving him again, fucking into the tight muscle at the back of Dean’s throat. It burns and Dean whimpers voicelessly. “You would do anything for your brother, out of love. You come to me on your knees with resentment in your heart, because you love him too much to see him suffer. You think
He’s never thought of his love as kind or beautiful, to be offered openly or without care. It’s a dark and violent thing, like the life he leads it’s best kept to the shadows where it can go unseen and unremarked on. Because there’s no line Dean won’t cross. He’ll rip the living heart out of whatever threatens his family, walk along a knife and die at the end of a gun if it keeps them safe.
Sun-warmed grass underfoot, soft breeze against his skin as he walks across the lawn. Dean has never felt so naked in his life. He can still taste Castiel, feel the places Cas was touching him — there’s a warmth circling around his cock where Cas’ fingers were and the sensation is keeping his erection from fading.
Castiel sighs, kisses Sam one more time, and lets him go. Sam slides down to his knees as Castiel turns and stalks over to where Dean is hanging; hair standing on end like a current lives under his skin, blue eyes blank and not even a crack in the stone of his expression, the only thing human about Castiel is the rumpled and half undone state of his clothing, and Dean remembers he should be terrified. The adrenaline racing through his veins screams at him to run and he can barely flinch against the weight of Castiel’s will as the deity closes in on him. Dean glares his defiance, certain as Castiel brings his hand up that this is the end and just as certain that he’s going to find a way to make Cas pay. He’s not expecting for Cas to kiss him, hand fisting in Dean’s hair. It’s angry and forceful, full of teeth and hunger and domination.
“On your knees, you pathetic little ant. You do not stand before me.” Dean holds his hands up and sinks to his knees. “Better. Maybe you can be taught.”
Dean swallows hard and walks across the room to stand and then, as gracefully as he can manage, kneel in front of his former friend. He keeps his eyes low, focusing on the base of the throne and Castiel’s shoes. Black on white. The silence is deafening, broken only by the sound of his own breathing and a faint ringing noise that might be panic or might be angels. Dean can’t tell.
Castiel is still standing there when the light fades, holding Sam against the wall and thrusting against him. It’s like he didn’t even
Dean’s anger flickers and fades in the face of his desperation. All his plans of killing Castiel and exacting revenge crumble to dust as slowly he understands. There’s no way out. No one’s coming to save them. There’s no way to fight their way free. Only one choice is left, really.
they can do. Some kind of way out of here. There’s less hope and more desperation in Dean’s spirit but he’s not broken yet. Not by a long shot. He’s broken out of Heaven and Hell, faced down demons and demigods and archangels and Death himself (the part where he was terrified of Death and didn’t actually win most of these encounters is, of course, not something he thinks about here.) Step one to fixing this is exploring their new prison.
Dean hangs his head and pushes in, one finger and then two. Sam starts sobbing softly, filled with winces and whimpers when Dean moves a little too fast but his body relaxes, letting Dean in easily. He stretches and applies more spit to his fingers and twists and the setting sun flashes in his eyes. Can’t put this off.
The silence is overwhelming but not unending. God if only it were. Dean makes small noises as he goes about his days here, one after another turning into weeks — the shuffling of socked feet on dirt, the brush of clothes against plants, the clanking of pottery on stone when he fetches water.
Gold light is fading to amber when Dean finds him in one of the lovers groves, sitting on a lonely stone bench and watching the sun setting. He’s surrounded by roses in shades of orange and white and slashes of scarlet that are too close to blood for Dean to stomach. It’s a peaceful scene.
“You’re going to take this,” Castiel’s fingers squeeze in a ring around Dean’s erection, “And you’re going to go find Sam.” Horror starts eating away at the haze and Dean jerks back. Castiel doesn’t let go, hand squeezing tight enough to make Dean sob. “You offered a substitute for love to
Dean is covered in filth and sweat, he’s exhausted and sick and his body is still aching for release, cock jutting out obscenely towards his brother. The temptation is there, as he watches Sam, to just walk away. Say no one last time, tell Castiel to fuck himself. The impulse flutters and dies — if Dean could walk away from Sam, he wouldn’t be here.
“Good boy.” Castiel cups his hand along Dean’s cheek and eases Dean back, until his cock slips out to lie against his thigh. His thumb traces over Dean’s lips. “On your feet, Dean.”
Sam shudders when he pulls out, pressing his face against the stone. Hiding. Dean can hear small noises, words choked off by fear, but he doesn’t want to know what Sam’s begging him for now. The only comfort Dean can offer is to get this over and done. More spit in his hand and Dean wraps his hand around his still-aching dick. He has to take a moment to breathe, overwhelmed by sensation and as he slicks himself up, the dying embers of anger. He’s going to get off on this. Castiel hasn’t left him any wiggle room there.
The temperature drops when Dean hits the greenhouse entrance, which makes him stumble. A layer of mist hides the plants and cacti more than a few steps beyond the door and muffles all sound, even Dean’s footsteps. A lifetime of experience hunting is screaming that something powerful is angry, but Sam is somewhere deeper in.
. He pushes ever so slightly and Castiel spreads his legs wider, wide enough that Dean can shuffle closer and rest his head against one thigh, nuzzling as he does. Like a fucking pet.
He’s such an idiot. His head is a mix of static and adrenaline, awake and distant all at once. The sun is out, he had sex with Cas, and now he has to rape his brother. Dean doesn’t really have a plan when he walks into the greenhouse. How do you plan raping someone? But Sam isn’t in the greenhouse. Dean searches the building twice, but he’s just not here.
Dean chokes out another “thank you, Castiel” before the angel-turned-deity vanishes, leaving the brothers alone.
This time Cas might actually want Sam to suffer. Penance for sins committed, or maybe just because Dean managed to piss Cas off.
It’s… a garden. Manicured lawns, flowerbeds, artistically shaped trees, quiet ponds filled with lotus blooms, babbling fountains and brooks. It’s beautiful, and too-perfect. No weeds, no plants out of place, no cranky gardener yelling for Dean to get off of the lawn, no mosquitos, no birds. No squirrels. There is nothing alive and nothing out of place and Dean grows more and more uneasy the further he explores.
“You are going to fuck your brother, Dean.” Castiel speaks and somewhere those words are etched in stone. “You’re going to give him the same paltry offering you
“Look at you,” Castiel says softly, pleased. Dean’s still humping against Sam, trying to hold still enough that he doesn’t lose Cas. “Do you want to come, Dean?”
It goes on. Until at last the light of Sam’s soul cuts out, and Dean is left in the dark. Castiel makes a pleased sound and the rest (skin on skin, wet and filthy fucking and Dean can’t…) comes to its own end. He does not hear Castiel approaching, too focused on the sound of Sam’s breathing, the quiet hitching noises of stifled sobs. The hand in his hair is a shock, and he flinches but he can’t make himself look up.
“Sorry,” Sam mumbles. His eyes aren’t focusing and he doesn’t seem to notice the tears still falling down his face. “I’ll be good.”
Castiel finally moves, fingers weaving through Dean’s hair as he gives another moan and closes his eyes. He’s gentle, more holding onto Dean as he moves than any attempt to change the pattern, but his hands still tug gently with each bob. It sends a pleasant tingle from scalp to toe, and Dean flushes when he realizes he’s responding — the taste of precome on his tongue, the warm heavy weight of Cas in his mouth, the familiar position of being on his knees in front of a partner — the sights and tastes and sounds of arousal build on one another, and warmth pools in his groin.
“I have no family,” Castiel tells Dean flatly, and then Sam stabs Cas in the back (irony, thy name is Winchester) and things go blindingly bright. Dean shields his face from the glow; when he can see again, things are quite different. Fresh cut grass and sunshine flood his senses, the garden he’s suddenly found himself in bright and too-alive after the eclipse-dark basement. Castiel looks at him for a second, unreadably cold and in this instant utterly inhuman — he never was, and never will be, but the mask is gone and what’s left is
“In that tiny duplex you're splitting with Charlie and Jo? Pshh, yeah, right. Don't take this the wrong way man, but it’s barely big enough for the two of you and that extra room is s’posed to be your office till you get settled. Besides, I ain’t too keen on sharing a place with you and your girl. There are some things I never wanna hear
Dean blinks again. Familiar eyes stare back at him. Heart taking up residence in his throat, he bites back a sob. His vision blurs, tunnels a little.
“Is this-this okay?” Dean asks in a broken voice, one hand buried in Castiel’s hair and the other arm wrapped around his shoulders, holding him close.
Heart pounding in his chest, he fights the temptation to touch himself through the delicate material because Cas hasn’t told him to yet and he wants to be
Then Dean shoves Castiel against the wall beside the stairs, a loud grunt escaping him from the sheer force of it, and those concerns disappear into the furthest reaches of his mind. Because what could be more important? He has Dean here, finally, before him in all his gorgeous, flushed and freckled glory. And it’s with that stunning reminder that he uses the strength he’s gained through years of running through his emotional frustration (and the recent months when exercise had taken on a distinctly different feeling and purpose. Admittedly, some of it frustration of another type) to flip their positions, pinning Dean with his body, tightly pressed from thigh to chest. Their lips meet, hot and just as desperate as they were in the car.
Dean grabs Castiel’s arm and loops it over his waist. A smile spreads across his face as he settles in, cheek nuzzling the fine hairs of Dean’s chest. Tangled together from head to toe, Dean links their fingers and hums, pleased, the vibration rumbling through their hands. Castiel feels the comforting rise and fall of his breath, listens to the steady thrum beating beneath his ear with warmth in his heart and possibility in his mind.
He rolls his eyes. Replies to Ellen with “Wouldn’t miss it 😘,” then sends a smug selfie to Sam (bird-flipping included, for good measure) which makes him snort because he can already picture in his mind the look that will cause. Bitchface number thirteen, most likely—the one that says,
He gulps it down in one shot, grimacing slightly as the strong agave flavor hits his tongue. Castiel follows, setting his glass on the nearby counter and stepping forward, devouring the empty space. Thirst not yet quenched, he takes the other glass from Dean and places it next to his.
muffled into the rumpled navy duvet between each frantic half-breath. So he does; stinging hands meet reddening flesh, once, twice, thrice more, alternating sides and massaging the tight muscles with his fingers after each swat. He stretches them apart, thumbs dipped into the cleft between, mesmerized by the sight of his cock sinking inside Dean’s shaking body over and over again. The digits slide further, grazing the pink, puffy border where they’re joined and Dean keens, bucks
“Alright, alright. ‘Nuff of that,” Dean says. “No chick-flick moments.” He rubs the back of his neck, fighting against the blush he can feel burning there.
, when Cas is here in front of him, touching him, distracting him from his own mind. Over the phone like this, he feels awkward and exposed. Logically, it should be the reverse, but then again no one's ever accused Dean of being logical.
A long moment passes. He gulps a weak, unsteady lungful of air and finally speaks, voice raspy in his throat from thirst and disuse. “I—what? Oh… yes, I guess I did. Sorry.”
Dean nearly spits his drink across the counter as he erupts with laughter. “Pretty much. Glad he didn’t scare you off. He’s weird, but a good guy, and smarter than he looks. Basically a genius, if you can believe it. Even went to M.I.T.”
, he likes the way it sounds. The way it brings a flame to life in his chest although that feeling has only ever been a dangerous one. It sounds like potential. Like
. It would be sleazy to masturbate in someone else’s bed, though the temptation is definitely there because he’s still a bit remiss to be awake at this hour or even considering getting out of bed. Were his blood pressure not through the roof, and were he not so damn hard, he’d probably shrug it off, roll over, and go back to sleep.
They break apart to find Sam standing in the doorway, arms crossed, eyes drifting everywhere in refusal to land on them. “Really, guys?”
Over the past few months, Rufus has been giving Cas more responsibility in overseeing the store, so it doesn’t come as much of a surprise when he starts asking him to close up on occasion. It’s a point of pride for Cas, that he’s earned that sort of trust (especially from a grumpy old bastard like Rufus), and Dean can respect that.
Feeling like a bucket of ice has been dumped over his head, he opens the door and steps over the threshold, muttering, “Don’t wait up,” as he closes it behind him.
It takes a while to pry Dean’s arms apart, but he manages to maneuver his pillow into his former spot. Dean latches onto it immediately, burying his face into it, and mumbles happily.
“Dean, maybe we should talk about this,” he says, but it comes out sounding more like a question than a request because the part of him asking is also terrified the answer won't be what he longs to hear.
Dean laughs boisterously, head thrown back, exposing his glorious throat. He has the sudden urge to trace it with his tongue.
He swallows hard and looks that way. Charlie is doing some kind of charades, and Jo has taken Dean’s chair to watch. She’s leaning over the arm of it, whispering something in Cas’ ear that makes him grin as they attempt to guess whatever it is Charlie is wildly gesticulating. Dean feels his own lips curl against his will, but that old familiar doubt remains.
Anyway, his sexuality is simply not something he advertises in and of itself. He just is who he is. Sammy knows he swings both ways, as do the rest of his family and friends. No one’s given him grief about it, at least not since high school, and that’s saying something here in the Midwest.
to build that sort of trust with anyone. But with Castiel... Fuck, everything is different with Cas.
There's obvious pride in the way it has been so carefully maintained. Everything looks original aside from the reupholstered red vinyl seats, including the jukebox on the far side of the room rotating through old records. Framed pictures of varying sizes line the walls, some black and white, some color, depicting what he guesses are locals throughout the restaurant's lifespan, and they make his heart glow, touching him in a way nothing has in a long time, if ever. It may be just a diner, a passing stop for those traveling through on their way from point A to point B, but to the locals, it’s a part of the soul of Eden. It's comfort, familiarity, love.
Curious, he heads over, boots crunching across the sunbaked gravel. Cas turns upon hearing him approach, a flicker of nervousness crossing his face.
Castiel can hardly stand it; he wheezes, whacks the back of a hand stupidly at Dean’s chest, and laughs until his lungs burn and hot tears streak down his cheeks.
Cas looks up, surprised. “I… okay.” The faint dusting of color along his cheekbones really brings out his eyes. “I’d like that.”
It’s almost like deja-vu walking into the diner again, even with the sun’s rays now reflecting across the checkered floor, polished to a gleaming shine. But the anxiety from the night before is replaced by a feeling of comfort because already, this place holds a pleasant memory for Castiel. Today, he takes more time appreciating it, noting all the things he’d been too distracted to see before.
They’re carnal, the sounds they make; sweet and filthy. The rough, wet slap of skin echoes through the room above words half-mumbled and unintelligible grunts. He doesn’t know what crosses his mind, what comes over him that spurs it but the hand clutching a narrow hip bone rises, falls with an abrupt, resounding thwack against plump flesh.
“Feel like I’m gonna puke, but yeah.” Castiel’s head cocks in question. Dean chuckles and shakes his head. “I fuckin’ hate heights, man.”
Dean’s family and friends all treat him like one of their own, and the only person who casts him a sideways glance is Pamela, who Dean informs him is the town “psychic”. It rattles him a bit, what she might intuit to give him those stares, but he ignores the feeling and steers clear of her as best he can just in case.
Another hour in and he’s half-tempted to let his jeans join it where it’s draped and dripping over the back of a kitchen chair. He perches at the island, its surface a welcoming coolness against his bare forearms, and guzzles the neck of a cold beer.
Grinning foolishly at the memory of that day, he looks from the computer in his lap to the snoring man beside him. Bathed in the soft morning light and gentleness of sleep, Dean looks so peaceful, the lines of his face smoothed away and the small curve of his mouth giving him a youthful glow too often marred by whatever in his past troubles him in the light of day. Things he hides behind that mask, the one Castiel wishes all the time he could rip away—not to deprive Dean of its safety but to spare Dean the need for it.
Truth be told, he expected the same fight from the rest of the family, too. Yet Ellen grudgingly accepted after he assured her it was what he wanted, that he was excited about the opportunity and it had nothing to do with wanting to leave
So he mixes the flour and salt in a bowl. Cuts the butter and shortening in with a fork, all the while singing under his breath an all-too-familiar song that always,
Cas is a long line of soothing heat pressed firmly to Dean’s back, and he hums into the embrace despite the chasm within him that grows every single time they do this.
It’s been a long damn week, and he's ready to kick back and do jack squat tonight. Already got a plan laid out in his mind, in fact; he’s gonna clock out, pick up some beer, say goodnight to Cas, go home, shower, order a pizza, and watch Doctor Sexy reruns until his brain stops working.
“Hold this,” he orders, pushing one of Dean’s legs up and guiding the other man’s hand. Dean obeys admirably, hooking his hands under both thighs and presenting himself. Castiel holds his breath, just for a moment, needing it to clear his head, then lies on his belly and gets comfortable.
“Here,” Cas says, guiding him to sit beside Sam. Then he lights the candle and looks expectantly at Dean. “I believe it is customary to make a wish?”
That night, Dean stares at the ceiling above his bed, Benny’s words echoing through his mind as he watches the shadows cast by the fan flicker through the scant moonlight illuminating the room.
That’s not to say he doesn’t have family or friends, people who care about him. He has his brothers (well, one of them, anyway). He has Claire. He has Balthazar, Rowena, and Hannah.
Castiel shrugs and follows his lead, giving Meg his order and settling back against the booth. Thankfully, she says nothing about the deflection, and their meals arrive before long.
The longer he works Cas into a mumbling, groaning mess the more relaxed he feels, to the point where he’s almost drunk on it. His mind becomes hazy, body light with the thrill of it all, months of longing bleeding into each
He flips the signal to make the final turn onto their destination street, determined to ignore his best friend. She throws her arms up with a dramatic, long-suffering sigh, but lets it go and changes the subject. Only half-listening to her suggestions for his upcoming twenty-fifth, his mind wanders.
Cas leans in, eyes drifting shut, and presses his forehead to Dean’s. “Me too,” Cas confesses, his voice breathy and uneven. “From that first day, Dean. You were—
—when suddenly there’s nothing but air beneath Dean’s feet and his hands, which still have a stern grip on Castiel’s shirt, bring them down together.
Now full and satisfied, Dean leans back in the booth and nurses his beer, content to let it be his last before he starts on water since he’s gotta drive later. Fingertips tapping against the pint glass to the rhythm of “Fool in the Rain”, he smiles and nods, laughs when his friends do, and tries to keep up with the conversation, yet his mind drifts time and again.
The impatient banging resumes. Annoyed and grumbling, he pads across the shag carpet on bare feet, still rubbing his dripping hair with the towel. Castiel cracks open the door to find green eyes staring at him. He squints back.
“Uh, when?” Dean tries to wrack his brain but can’t make heads or tails of anything right now, still stuck on his slutty slip of the tongue from a few minutes ago.
Thumbing the bottle, he twirls it a little on the bed beside him. Runs his fingers down its side to catch the condensation, then grips it fully and takes another long pull. It’s only by chance that he catches movement in his periphery as he drinks. Dean’s holding his beer over his lap now with both hands, arms stiff, even as he stares straight ahead at the movie. Castiel frowns.
With Cas, he’s not a brother (and unwitting father), not a hunter, or, as it was once-upon-a-time, Michael’s favorite meat suit. He doesn’t have to be the leader here, doesn’t have to make the hard decisions. Or on some nights, any decisions at all. He’s just—
More and more lately, he catches himself side-eyeing the empty passenger side. Used to be Sammy there, once upon a time, all gangly limbs and big hazel eyes. Used to be just the two of them out here on the open road, middle of the night, nothing better to do than cruise through beautiful countryside, waiting out whatever job Dad was on. Hoping he’d come back in one piece and maybe, just maybe, it’d be the last time. (It never was.)
Once inside, he shuffles down the aisle toward the hot drinks and quickly pours himself the largest available cup of Columbian Roast, glancing around to make sure no one’s watching before he adds a liberal dose of sugar and cream. Drinking it black is fine and dandy when he has to, but (and he’ll never admit this aloud) it tastes better this way. He opts for pumpkin spice today since they put it out early in the season.
“Gabriel calls me Cassie, or Casanova when he's being particularly facetious. It’s pointless to argue with him.”
“Dean—” he starts, but the man’s already navigating back through the kitchen. It’s discomfiting. Itches beneath his skin. He’s unaccustomed to being taken care of like this, and conflicted because he can’t decide if he’s being infantilized or Dean is genuinely attempting to console him, make him happy. The latter he has far more difficulty believing, though Dean’s never given him any indication that he finds Castiel incompetent or childish.
“Seriously?” Dean raises a brow. “What’s a ‘long time’?” Cas looks at him, gaze sharp and a little defensive, and Dean puts his hands up. “Hey, not judging.”
himself at Castiel and suddenly he's got a lapful of squirming, eager six-foot mechanic to contend with. It's nothing like their first “kiss”, if that could really even be counted. Just a thoughtless peck on the cheek, maybe innocuous to Dean though it left Castiel’s skin burning for the remainder of that day as he replayed it over and over in his mind.
, he thinks during the silence that follows. Now his tipsy ass has gone and sullied the mood. Dumping all his baggage out there like that and he barely met the guy—if this were by chance a first date and he was in Cas’ shoes? Shit, he’d be running for the hills right about now.
Tonight is one such night—the culmination of a hot-as-balls Saturday in early June—and although Dean’s already home for the day, freshly showered and sprawled on the couch in his flannel hot-dog pants, his mind won't turn off and his stomach won't turn on. He hasn't even touched the beer sitting on his coffee-table, condensation pooling around the edges of one of the cork coasters he got in a five-pack at Walmart when he first moved in.
of his realigning vertebrae echoes in the empty space, a leisurely groan following soon behind. Dropping his arms, Castiel yawns and scratches his lower belly, unintentionally grazing his erection and a heady, thrilling pulse of pleasure vibrates through him.
“Yes, I like beer.” Castiel nods politely then glances at Meg. “Do not let him pay for anything. And please add his previous order to my tab,” he says solemnly.
“You hardly touched your breakfast this morning,” Cas says, pointing at him with the end of the hanger.
Dean’s not about to let anything, not even his own self-doubt, ruin this. Not now, not when he feels like he’s been waiting his entire life for this moment, and not just ‘cause they might have sex. Like, yeah, okay that’s definitely part of it. But… shit, it’s so much more than that.
Fuck, how he wishes at this moment that Cas still had wings because hose days of calling for him without the constraints of human travel have long since passed but are still close enough to taste the memories of.
Dean turns to putty beneath him, moaning and grunting as the knots in his muscles loosen, until Cas works some kinda magic right at the base of his spine and those sounds turn to snores.
Damn cat knows she’s not allowed up there but she’s even more stubborn than he is. He shoos her off the bed, rolls onto his back, sits up, and immediately cries out from the head-splitting pain. It feels as though his brain’s gonna explode through his eye sockets, throbbing and tender within his skull. His throat is even more scratchy and sore than that morning and his shirt sticks to his skin, soaked in sweat.
But these sounds? Oh, these are by far his favorite, and he wants nothing more than to memorize each and every one, record them on an album alongside the others to replay in his mind on his darkest days so he’ll know, and believe, that life is worth living, that good things do indeed happen.
By sheer willpower, he forces his mouth into the most charming damn smirk he can manage. The guy’s legs are still slightly bent and his fingers are digging uncomfortably into Dean’s hips, giving him the impression if he lets go he’ll sag to the floor. So he holds on, and those blue gems just stare right back, pupils all big. Dude looks dazed, probably embarrassed. There’s a hint of something else in his gaze, too, but Dean’s too distracted to go analyzing it, busy counting each glistening fleck and all the variations of shades. It’s so tempting to spout the, “did it hurt when you fell from Heaven,” line, considering the circumstances, that his
He stares as the faucet drips onto the porcelain below, and doesn't that just feel like the icing on today’s cake of misery. After a long moment, his gaze drifts to the mirror. The permanent circles beneath his eyes give him a gaunt, near skeletal appearance, they’re so dark, and the eyes themselves are glazed and bloodshot. The thick stubble around his mouth is rough against his palm as he scrubs one hand over his face and turns to make his way to the living room, legs ready to give out beneath him.
Dean’s eyebrows rise. He shakes his head and looks at Cas with a tender smile, biting down the twinge of guilt in his gut. “Don’t worry about it. Like Meg said, we screw with each other. Sometimes we take stuff too far. But you and me? We’re good, I promise.”
“Cool, yeah, I got you. You new in town?" The man squints, eyes scrutinizing but glassy and unfocused. "Never seen you around.”
t-shirt at The Empire Mall, or come in from the garden he's obsessively cultivating to grab a glass of water with dirt under his nails, grass stains on his knees, and this soft, content look on his face.
The plans for the day laid, Dean guides Castiel to the truck and gives him instructions for his part. He’s slightly disgruntled to be stuck in the house scraping wallpaper rather than outside with Dean, but takes the tools and sheet plastic for the floor without complaint. With one last lingering look from the porch, he sighs and sets to work.
Binging it together before bed quickly becomes one of Dean’s favorite parts of the day, second only to witnessing Castiel’s beautiful, sleep-smooth face in the dim glow of morning before the other man’s irritable ass wakes and stumbles out of bed with the blunt demand for caffeine.
Dean walks back to the garage in a daze. Goes right into Bobby’s office, tells him he doesn’t feel well.
“Shurley?” he mumbles, more to himself than to Cas. The name sounds mildly familiar, but through the fog of the evening’s events, he can’t seem to place why.
Castiel’s lips purse. He decides not to deign that with another reply and instead downs the rest of his coffee in one go. As he’s preparing to rise for more, Dean snatches the cup.
Dean turns, shoving the phone into his pocket, and jolts when he finds Castiel standing directly behind him. “Jesus, Cas! We need to get you a damn bell.”
“Michael…” He drops the phone from his ear, holds the receiver close to his lips, and growls, tone low enough to scrape pavement,
He grabs his beer and takes a long swig, eager to reclaim the guy’s attention but needing the buzz to calm his nerves. “So uh, you staying somewhere in town?”
Bobby’s expression is fond. He shakes his head, bright shafts of sunlight dancing across the brim of his ball cap and into Dean’s eyes. When did it become day? How long has he been driving? Time is distorted here, minutes blending into hours, days, weeks. Like a distant mirage, flickering and blurring at the edges of his vision.
He gives Cas a slow, sleepy grin. “Never gotten any complaints.” Cas’ eyes narrow and head angles to the right, mouth forming a small circle. Dean can almost hear the whoosh of his joke flying right over the guy’s head. Letting his head drop to his forearms he mutters, “Forget it,” under his breath.
His brother says it’s creepy that Dean talks to (and anthropomorphizes) his car, but Sammy eats gross shit like kale and quinoa and listens to Celine Dion, so that renders his opinion moot in Dean’s book.
Dean scoffs, about to respond when he spots Castiel standing by the stairs and waves him over. “Hey! C’mere.”
Wiping a forearm across his sweat and dust-layered brow, Cas stares down at the floor with a face that says he’s not new to being scolded and clearly hates it. Dean flaps a dismissive hand in the air, waving away any potential argument Cas has left.
?” Benny drawls in a husky, syrup-thick cadence. Castiel guesses New Orleans; strange to find in small-town South Dakota. He wonders how exactly Benny and Dean became acquainted, but quickly shoves the thought from his mind. Now is not the time.
A full spread of snacks decorates the countertop surrounding the sink; chips and chopped vegetables with homemade dips, sliced fruit, salad mix, a charcuterie board full of meats and cheeses, trays of Dean’s famous sliders, and several varieties of fresh-baked tarts (or as Dean calls them, “mini pies”). The old fridge is stocked with beer, and on the counter directly beside it, they’d set out an assortment of liquor and mixers, from rum and Coke to vodka and orange juice, to whiskey and Sprite, and everything between that they could think of, along with a huge stack of red solo cups. Castiel still isn’t sure they have enough, but Dean insisted repeatedly that people are bringing more food.
“Dude, no. It’s not like that.” Castiel inches closer, watching Dean listen to the muffled voice on the other end of the line as he removes the nozzle from the filler neck and refits it into place beside the pump. “Fine. Don’t make it weird, though,” Dean says shortly, pinching the bridge of his nose between forefinger and thumb. He shakes his head. “Yeah, yeah. See ya. Bitch.”
Rubbing the crust from his eyes, he fumbles for his phone with his unoccupied hand. He squints at it, blinking to clear away the haze from his eyes and groans when he finds it’s only four in the morning.
—not a different man, no, the same one he's always cherished. His feelings have not changed but rather grown exponentially, he
The moment he steps out into the street, a giant raindrop splatters directly onto the center of his forehead. Within seconds, it’s pouring.
“It’s been a while.” Cas’ gaze falls, as does his hand from Dean’s shoulder. He shifts from foot to foot.
“Hey, hey,” Dean soothes, one hand gripping Castiel’s nape and the other cupping his face. The pad of a thumb brushes his cheekbone. “You okay?”
He eagerly anticipates the bed dipping and shifting when Cas settles in beside him at night, even if it’s accompanied by a pang of longing to cross the distance between them. Dean loves watching the adorable wrinkle of Cas’ nose as he squints at the TV, over-scrutinizing the plot of whichever episode of Dr. Sexy they’re on, regardless of how many times they’ve both seen it.
“Don’t worry Sam,” Jack assures from where he’s scooted up to rest his forearms on the back of the seat between them. Bitchface in 3-2-1... “I’ll heal him.”
Maybe it’s the beer, maybe he’s just an idiot, but before he can stop himself he asks, “What about now?”
She gives him a look that says “how dare you” before jumping down to the floor, sulking irritably toward her food dish.
A couple of days before Valentine’s, Dean’s surreptitiously stirring his coffee when Cas ninjas up beside him, plopping a small cardboard box onto the countertop. Dean almost spills it, slapping the lid over the cup before Cas can see exactly how light the brew within is.
Dean asks, “So what’s your story,” idly twirling his glass, staring at the grooves in the wood beneath it so he doesn't seem overeager.
It's like a weight lifts from his shoulders then, and for the first time in a long time, Castiel falls asleep smiling. Believing,
A wicked idea flits through his mind. There’s something he has hidden which Cas has yet to see, and although he’s a little scared of his reaction, this has put him in an experimental mood. Castiel is doing something new for him once again, bridging the physical distance between them to satisfy his needs, and he wants to return the favor. Wants to
); that’s what Dean’s good at. He knows what he wants, what he hurriedly prepared himself for barely what, twenty minutes ago? Time is an illusion at this point.
Anxious, he looks at Dean across the table. He expects a disgruntled scowl to reveal his feelings toward her insinuation, and is shocked to find no hint of that on the man's face. Rather, he’s grinning broadly at Meg, as smug as Castiel has ever seen him. Dean’s eyes seek out Castiel’s and he braces himself, waiting for the other shoe to drop.
“Thank you,” Cas breathes, still flushed and now awkward. “And thank you for testing the others for me. I wanted this one to be perfect.”
Swinging his legs to the floor, Dean sits at the edge of the mattress with his feet firmly planted on the wood below, reaching up with cautious hands to Cas’ hips. He pulls Cas between his spread knees and asks, “This okay?”
He bites his lip, choking back a needy whimper. Cas must take Dean’s stupefied silence as stubbornness though, thank God, because with a quick glance from Dean’s eyes to his mouth and harsh, unusually shaky exhale, Cas grumbles, “Fine,” and stalks back toward the freezer aisle with his arms full.
Dean pulls away, one hand settling upon Cas’ shoulder, the other tilting his chin so their eyes meet. He needs Cas not just to hear him, but to
Castiel smiles weakly. “None taken. It’s true he can be difficult to get along with, but he’s not all bad. He brought me in, gave me a job when he didn’t have to.”
It isn’t Sam’s fault Mom died and Dad went off the friggin’ deep end. Isn’t his fault Dean got stuck with so much responsibility so young. Isn’t his fault he got a childhood and Dean never did.
. Silently folding her arms across her chest and tapping her foot, lips drawn into a thin line, Charlie goes full “done with his shit” mode. He gulps thickly, avoiding her gaze while he tries to wrap his tongue and his head around his next words. “I can’t. Cas is… he’s different.”
Muffled though it is around the mouthful which has his cheeks puffed like a squirrel packing it in for winter, it’s a low and sensual sound that goes straight from Castiel’s lips to Dean’s dick and has him struggling to pick his jaw up off the goddamn floor.
Stupefied, Dean stares at the spot Castiel Novak previously occupied, feeling the loss swell and crest like a physical ache beneath his ribs, a reflection of the space Cas had carved deep within his heart and then, unwittingly, abandoned.
Castiel pauses, staring openly, eyebrows raised as he silently wills the man to continue. When he doesn’t, Castiel clears his throat with growing agitation. “Do I need to change rooms?”
He starts at the gravely, unfamiliar voice, blinking up from his wallet into the bluest eyes he’s ever seen. Deep and clear as crystal, hooded with dark lashes, they’re surrounded by an equally unique face. Broad, strong-jawed, with a slightly dimpled chin, straight Patrician nose, and shadow of stubble that seems to pay five o'clock no heed. Around his own age, he guesses—maybe a year or two older. Not classically handsome per se, but definitely attention-grabbing. Paired with
Though to be fair, it fucking sucked and drove him psycho, and yeah… Dean doesn't like thinking about that
Dean's had no one to wake up with, come home to, and take care of since Sammy, and even then, it never felt like
As he navigates his way back outside, he considers his options. Castiel has never renovated a house before (hell, he's never so much as put together a bookshelf), and he hasn’t even looked at the surrounding land or other buildings yet. Between the sums left to him and Gabriel, maybe they can pull it off if they find someone to take on the project. Or, as his brother suggested, they can sell it. Despite his reservations, having seen it, the latter rings slightly hollow, and disappointment seeps through him down to the marrow.
“Yo! What’s up, my man!” he slurs, sounding stoned. Or drunk. Possibly both, judging by his heavy-lidded red eyes and mile-long stare.
Like tonight, when Dean had taken Castiel’s hand beneath the stars, a nervous tremor to his voice, and said, “Since you’re staying here and all… Would you…”
, the look upon Dean’s beautiful face is worth every second of pain and loneliness he’s endured over the last three decades. The crow’s feet around his eyes deepen with a grin that spreads like sunshine’s warmth, casting its radiance over Castiel and flushing him down to his toes.
Nearly two hours outside of Sioux Falls, they pass through Eden. It looks like something out of a magazine, pure Midwestern Americana; one wide main street with several smaller intersecting streets, but no streetlights, only stop signs indicating right-of-way. Beautiful brick and mortar buildings, probably built around the start of the twentieth century, if not earlier, with hand-painted signs hanging out front. A single general store, gas station, hardware store, diner, bakery, bar, church, and various other small businesses. Most of the family homes are situated along the outskirts, as close to suburbs as a town this small could attempt, or scattered into the farmland beyond.
Sorry for the long wait between updates, but life has been... uh. Well, life. Hope it was worth the wait! (Please don't hate me for the cliffhanger lmao)
, and your laugh, it’s the dorkiest goddamn thing.” A low chuckle escapes, slightly strangled with emotion as he’s inundated with memories, nearly overwhelmed. Then, softer, “I wanted to tell you that I kept that sweatshirt, I kept it, and I wear it every night or else I can’t sleep but it doesn’t smell like you anymore and your—Christ, this is such a fucking cliche, but hear me out—the sky has nothing on you man, your eyes are the most beautiful I've ever seen.” Gulping a lungful of damp air, he continues, just above a whisper, “Thing is, Cas, I-I’m crazy about you. Head over fucking heels… Have been since day one.”
, that’s a little strange. But if he doesn’t have a date, that must mean he’s single, right? Dean does a mental fist pump and side-steps an inch closer.
He never did. And Dean fucking loves him for it. Damned if he’ll tell him so with words, he’s never been good at that shit, but he hopes every second of every day the man knows it from Dean’s actions because—
“I’m sorry I fell asleep on ya like that, it wasn’t uh. Planned or anything.” Dean rubs his neck self-consciously. “Probably think I’m a real creep.”
It’s frequented by trade workers, students, and everyone between—and to top it off, Harvelle’s is LGBT-friendly because Ellen “doesn’t tolerate that bigoted bullcrap” (her words). And although she’s got the big, stoic ex-military Vic standing post to bounce the occasional rowdy jackass on busier nights, she’s known for being an ace shot with the 9mm revolver she keeps under the bar so more often than not, nobody’s stupid enough to risk it.
Sam chuckles on the other end of the line and Dean hears him say something, muffled though like he’s covering the receiver with his hand. Probably talking to Jess. Then he says, “What about you? I need your help with something.”
Perhaps it’s the leftover surge of dopamine from his recent orgasm which has yet to subside, or the lingering morning drowse the shower failed to erase. Whatever the cause, he lets his eyes rake hungrily over him. Lets every inch sear itself into his memory (saving those details for future fantasies. Who wouldn’t?) and doesn’t look away when Dean straightens and turns, catching his gaze. The attention colors Dean’s cheeks and, after an awkwardly interminable staring match, filled with either nervous tension or another sort of tension entirely, it’s strangely difficult to determine, Dean settles on offering Castiel a sly smile while sauntering toward the stove.
“That’s bull,” Jo says, snorting. “You sing all the time. When you’re drunk, or in the car, or the shower, or—”
But that doesn’t prevent the ache in his chest from expanding each year, that piece of him that’s always wanted a family and home of his own, a place in the world. A life he can share with someone who accepts him, who understands, who won’t use him up and toss him aside when they’re through and won’t let him do the same. Someone who loves him, flaws and all, who he can love in return. Someone who will
Dean’s responding grin is possibly the most beautiful thing he’s ever seen, and with it, the pressure dissipates. Dean pats his hand once and sits back. “Besides, you’re not a damn robot, man. Don’t feel bad for taking a break. Matter of fact, you know what you need?”
Thankfully, he brought it up to Jo separately during one of her shifts at the Roadhouse. Because the first thing out of her mouth, if said in front of Ellen and Bobby, would have made Dean spontaneously combust on the spot from the sheer magnitude of his humiliation.
A curse almost slips free but Dean reigns it in, not wanting to embarrass Cas any more than he already has. Besides, it’s not like Dean’s been getting any. Over the last few years casual, meaningless sex with strangers had gradually lost its appeal and those encounters grew fewer and farther between. He’d almost stopped making the effort to pick people up altogether, only going for it if someone hit on him first and he happened to be in the mood.
“I’ve only been here a little over a week and already feel myself slipping into old habits. Guess it just brought up some… uncomfortable memories.” He glances away from Dean’s painfully sympathetic eyes and clears his throat. “It’s not important.”
He casts an eye sideways at Cas, sitting beside him with a soft smile awash in an iridescent glow that makes his heart flutter in his chest. “Nah, I’m good.”
Insects trill beyond the walls of his room, strange to ears accustomed to the daily rumble and quake of the nearby subway, honking cars, and the creaking, rattling pipes as the neighbor on the floor above runs their shower. This foreign sound is mollifying, peaceful, and sweet, lulling him through that opaque place between wakefulness and sleep. Woven among the muted noises, a voice whispers his name, repeating like the hook of a favorite song. A memory and remnant of his dream, it makes the urge to stay in this place, bide his time, that much stronger. More enticing.
Dean heads over to the shop sink and quickly washes his hands. Not quite good enough to get all the grease from under his nails, but it’ll have to do because he doesn’t want to make him wait. Still wiping them dry on his thighs, Dean walks out from the open bay and sees Cas standing in the parking lot, his back to Dean, beside a gold Lincoln Continental Mark V. Late 70’s, Dean guesses, and not bad, but the color does it no favors whatsoever and it’s the absolute last thing he ever expected to see Cas driving.
handsome. He’s a keeper,” she says, pointedly tossing a wink Dean’s way. He flushes. She releases Cas’ hand and innocently pulls a pad of paper and pen out of her apron.
he yelps as the pain reverberates through him, a million tiny nerves blaring warning signals at once, shooting from his crown down his spine and making his toes curl. His fingers tighten when Cas groans his approval, nails scraping against sensitive skin.
It’s beyond awkward though, and more than once as he wiggles the denim down his legs the phone threatens to slip from where it’s wedged and crash to the floor, but he manages to drop both the jeans and his boxers before Cas speaks again.
, it brings tears to Castiel’s eyes and takes every ounce of his unraveling control to hold them at bay.
“Doesn’t look like the roof needs replacing, just some patches here and there,” Dean says. “Siding needs a little work but I don’t see any major damage. Good scrub down and fresh coat of paint ought to do it. We could knock all that out in a couple days.”
His pulse pounds in his ears as Dean yanks the key from the ignition and with a resigned sigh says, “Look, I’m sorry. I was outta line.”
He can see it in his eyes and the smug little purse of his lips. His brother says nothing, however. Simply shrugs and brushes past him, heading for the library.
look (which works fucking wonders if the matching smolder in Cas’ eyes as he climbs up to follow is any indication).
Sure, Cas is a tall, fit guy and it’s a decent area. But… something about him being in the store for hours like that, after dark and all alone, ties Dean’s stomach in knots. Maybe Sam’s true crime obsession is rubbing off on him.
Castiel breathes a sigh of relief and smiles, grateful for the save. "Isn't it early for alcohol?" he says.
He eyes the smoky brunette as she saunters up to him, thumbs in her belt loops, and smirks. “Pamela.”
Cas’ shoulders relax and he smiles softly back. “Good.” He scoots his plate forward, clearing a space to lean on one elbow, twisting the rest of his body to face Dean. Cas runs a hand through his hair, pushing it from his forehead, and says abruptly, “I'd like to take you up on your offer, if you are still amenable.”
When his fingers finally wrap around his straining erection, he imagines that rough voice dipping another octave, rumbling his name, drawing a heady moan from his own lips. He braces the other hand on the shower wall, widens his stance, and lets his head hang between steamed-pink shoulders as he strokes. Long, steady pulls from base to tip and down again.
Castiel responds with a wordless hum, hands fisting in the flannel at Dean’s back, the other man’s arms tightening around his neck and shoulders. He relaxes, leaning on the counter, and melts into the comforting embrace. Pulling the other man flush against him, bowed legs spread on either side of his, he smiles and buries his face into the crook of Dean’s neck and shoulder. Dean’s body is a warm, solid line against Castiel’s own, and with barely two inches separating them in height, they fit together like pieces of the same puzzle. Truthfully, he can’t remember the last time someone held him the way Dean does. It’s completely platonic but no less intimate, soothing, and Castiel wishes they could remain like this forever.
“Alright, cut it with the puppy eyes, dude.” She sighs, but her expression quickly turns devious. Never a good sign. “You owe me big time, though. Next tournament, you’re coming with.”
“Here.” Dean places a fresh, steaming cup before him. “I’ve got my work truck out front already. Sam and Benny are stopping by in a couple hours, we’re gonna check out the roof and siding today before we start on anything major inside.”
It’s unfair for anyone to look so gorgeous and refreshed at this hour, particularly after a night of pizza and liquor. Clean-shaven, hair perfectly teased, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed. Not to mention the rest of him… Dean looks good in everything, but the faded, timeworn Led Zeppelin t-shirt stretched tightly across his chest beneath an open burgundy button-up might be his favorite look yet.
Unfortunately, life ain’t that simple, so he’s settled for the next best thing; taking affection where he can get it and keeping his mind numb and hands busy when it’s gone.
“Yes.” Castiel resists the urge to roll his eyes and fishes out his wallet. He wants to get to his room and put some food in his stomach before he passes out, not waste time on small talk with this strange little man. He hasn’t eaten since arriving at the airport that morning and still needs to stop at the store for a box and some litter for Claire. “How much?”
It’s always been difficult to talk openly about what he wants, to share those vulnerable parts of himself. To top it off, he’s never had the
Figuring the time’s now or never to shoot his shot, he juts out his hand. “Name’s Dean. Dean Winchester.”
“Castiel Shurley. I’ve heard so much about you, Sam.” It’s a little weird, in that he doesn’t smile with his mouth but somehow does with his eyes.
The wave of nausea curling in his gut like a snake readying itself to strike right now proves otherwise.
Instead, he had a strict, stoic governess to rule over his and his brothers’ every move. {Naomi, he remembers. She’d once told him he “came off the line with a crack in his chassis”. Didn’t know what that meant at the time, but it burrowed deep and stayed with him regardless. To this day, he hates her for it.) Posture eternally stiff, the bun in her hair pulled tight against her crown, eyes like steel. There were daily schedules set that he nearly always violated because he woke each morning, pouted sleepily through bland, unsatisfying breakfasts, and dragged his feet to the car for school. And worst of all, a distant, mysterious father he only saw on holidays or during company parties he dragged the boys to for appearance's sake (where even the slightest hint of bad behavior was later severely punished), and rarely in the late, late evenings when Castiel was supposed to be asleep.
“Screw Boston, and screw Michael,” Gabe snapped. “He may be our brother but he’s also the world's biggest bag of dicks, and Dad? He’s gone. You don’t owe anyone a damn thing.” Castiel’s throat closed around a pained whimper. Then, softly, “I’m just tired of seeing you miserable.”
He remembers the way those long fingers groped at his hips, just below the belt, like it was all he could do to keep standing. Dean wonders what they’d feel like under the clothes, on his skin, running down his back or up his thighs. He swallows hard, trying to chase the thoughts away.
“It’s not your fault,” Castiel says lowly, shaking his head. “After he fell ill and was hospitalized, Michael took over the company and our father’s finances. I have a feeling he is the one who stopped paying for its upkeep.”
Castiel groans, deep and low, head flung back on the seat. “You feel that?” He tugs Dean’s hips against his own to prove his point. “More than anything. We… we don’t have to stop, but...”
“Enough of the literal bullshit, you know what I mean!” Dean growls, and Castiel’s heart skips a beat, fingers curling into his palms.
At length, Dean releases the air he’s been holding, low and quiet beneath the hum of the fan as Cas’ weight settles on the other side of the bed followed by a tired sigh. Dean waits, stock still, though he longs to curl into the other man’s warmth. It feels as though something’s broken between them and he doesn’t know how to repair it, or if he can.
Drinks and plates in hand, Castiel and Dean work their way into the living room and find Sam with a group beside the fireplace.
“Shit, shit, shit,” Cas curses. Dean spins around to see Cas cupping his hands under the spout in a vain attempt to stem the flow of syrupy, icy blue mush. It’s no use, though, running like a river through his fingers, down his forearms, splashing all over the floor. Dean darts forward, wobbling and sliding around like a toddler on skates in the sludge. But just when he thinks he’s regained his balance, his foot slips from under him and he careens right into Cas, sending them both toppling to the floor.
Unexpectedly, Cas chuckles. An unabashed sound that reveals he’s never gotten this off his chest before, that rather than bringing the mood down it’s a
Stepping inside the Gas-N-Sip, he scans the store and spots the hot new guy (whose name tag, Dean found once he wasn’t too dumbstruck to notice it, reads simply,
“Ya know what, fine. Do what you want,” he eventually mutters, frowning at the space between his knees.
“Dean—hold on.” He catches the other man’s wrists in a tight grip and pulls them away. Dean whines and rocks against Castiel again, eliciting a sharp hiss as a bolt of pleasure shoots through him. “Inside. Let’s-let’s go inside.”
“Not that we were close before that, mind you. Well, Gabe and I were, but he’d moved out to Los Angeles by then. He sent me money when he could, but I didn't want to rely on him like that. It’s been so many years since…”
. Eyes falling closed, he suckles at the tip, letting his hand catch his saliva as it dribbles down the shaft to smooth each stroke. It’s messy, flawless, and his own lust brims, tightens in his groin. He’s aching for touch, release, but all he cares about right now is
Castiel shrugs to the empty room. Dean is at work, Claire in her favorite spot in the window chattering at birds, and he’d chosen to keep busy by finishing the walls on the second floor. “It hardly seemed worth flying to Boston for two weeks just to come back.”
As with his ‘67 Impala’s original tape deck, Dean’s a sucker for the old digital piece of junk he picked up at Goodwill eight years ago, yet days like this make him reconsider using his phone’s generic bell preset instead.
He pauses, taking a breath, like he wants to say something but isn’t sure how, and Dean hopes it’s what he thinks, that all his doubts have been misguided products of his own shitty opinion of himself and not a reflection of whatever Cas actually feels. His heartbeat drowns out the fireworks, anticipation tingling across his skin like the wind. Then Cas turns toward him fully, bringing them mere inches apart.
He watches the shift of movement as Dean crosses his ankles, weaves one arm behind his head, and slumps into a more comfortable position. Imagines himself yanking the bottle away, tossing it across the room, mess be damned. Straddling Dean’s lap, grinding against him, licking into his delicious pink mouth. Running his fingers through Dean’s short hair, getting close enough to finally determine if it’s truly brown or a dark, dirty blond. Maybe tugging it a little, just to see if Dean likes it. To hear what noises he’ll make.
His back is arched, bare feet and palms planted on the mat he’s laid out, perfect ass in the air, neatly framed between the glass-plated French doors.
The air grows heavy between them, crackling with electricity as Cas’ eyes slip from incredulous fury to calculating, sharp as steel. Dean doesn’t take the hint at first, blinded by the intoxicating rush of adrenaline pumping through his veins. Just keeps on running his mouth with shit like, “quit leaving laundry on the floor, clean out the fucking sink after you shave, and could you make the damn bed for once!”
Cas looks at him like he’s just asked the stupidest question and for a moment Dean’s actually kinda worried he’s gonna say no. Instead Cas drops to his elbows, bringing their faces so close the heat of his breath feathers across Dean’s lips. He arches up, but Cas doesn’t meet him halfway.
He fumbles with the condom, rolls it over his straining dick, and groans from the touch. Takes a deep, steadying breath. Dean glances over his shoulder, lips forming a pout for some reason as he takes in the scene, but then he smacks Castiel in the thigh.
preparing. In fact, he had very intentionally not thought about it at all. In hindsight, that probably wasn’t the best idea.
Paper plates, napkins, and utensils sit at one end, toppings and other fixings lining the back of the table. Mustard, ketchup, mayo, bar-b-que sauce, a jar of relish, sliced onions and tomatoes, dill pickles, a head of iceberg lettuce, a tupperware container full of cooked bacon, and packages of sliced sharp cheddar. Dean’s mouth waters just thinking about the meal he’s been looking forward to all week.
He breathes a sigh of relief when instead of grilling Cas, she asks, “What can I get you boys?” She glances at Dean. “The usual?”
This ain’t Dean’s first rodeo, he knows he’s attracted to Cas. Like, ridiculously fucking attracted. Maybe it’s the hot five-o'clock shadow on his sharp, square jaw. Maybe it’s the sex hair. Maybe it’s the crystalline blue of his eyes, so piercing in their intensity it’s like he can see into Dean’s soul (he's already waxing poetic about the guy, for cryin' out loud). Whatever the cause, he’s definitely filing that moan, and the attached imagery, away for later.
“Is there anything I should look out for?” Cas sounds kinda panicked still, and it makes Dean feel bad but also a little warm inside because… shit, the guy is really worried about him. “What if he gets worse?”
“Thank you.” Castiel hastily snatches his cards and room key before the man can ask any more questions. He backs away from the desk, slings the duffel bag over his shoulder, and picks up Claire and his suitcase. With hands full, he has to nudge the door open with his ass and awkwardly squeeze through while the man watches, scratching his head.
They’re both well on their way to that white picket fence, two and a half kids and a dog, apple pie life and Dean couldn’t be more proud.
“I know you will, my love,” Cas says, pausing for breath. His angel is waiting for something, purposefully dangling Dean over the edge of that sweet, agonizing precipice. He crests upon the endless waves of pleasure, mind growing hazy with arousal as every synapse fires like ricocheting shotgun shrapnel, muscles growing sore and stiff from the position though his body feels almost weightless and just as he’s about to give in and
Dean knows he can trust her with this. Just as much as he’d trust Sam, if not more so, because there are some things siblings
The other man looks up, eyes hooded and dark with lust, and sweeps the back of his fingers softly across Dean’s cheek. “I’ve got you,” he whispers huskily.
That was the first time Dean had ever stolen, and wouldn’t be the last. Wouldn’t be the last of many illegal activities he did to put food in their bellies, clothes on their backs, or keep a roof over their heads, and though those days are far behind him the lesson stuck.
He’d been waiting, hoping desperately to see Cas all this time, and now that he has, he’s let him slip through his fingers yet again.
the relieved groan that slips out is gonna have a VIP spot in his spank bank for the foreseeable future.
At some point last night, the man entangled their limbs even further than when they fell asleep. The leg Castiel’s laying on is trapped, pinned against the mattress by Dean’s bare thigh, and somehow his arm has wiggled its way under Castiel’s body to join the other across his chest. He can feel a rough, unshaved cheek between his shoulder blades and the gentle puffs of Dean’s breath on his slick skin. About to burst, he tries to squirm free. Dean clings even tighter, letting out a frustrated growl. He sounds like an angry bear.
His shoulders heave with a weary sigh as he drags a hand over his eyes and mouth. “Look, Cas. I get you probably want that stuff so you don’t feel like a burden or whatever, but you’re not. I’ve made mine and Sammy's breakfasts and packed our lunches since I could reach the stove, and I was a tall kid. Whenever Ellen worked nights, I made dinner for Sam, Bobby, Jo, and me. It’s no trouble at all doing the same for you. I like doing it. I
. Dean’s teeth scrape over the plump flesh of Cas’ lower lip, nipping and teasing, coaxing a whimper that he swallows readily.
On the ride back, the scents of native cottonwood, oak, and wildflowers drift on the wind into the open window through which Cas gazes. Sunlight dances across his tanned skin, emphasizes the brown highlights in his dark hair. His eyes flutter closed, lashes fanned against his cheeks, expression peaceful, content. Dean spots his hand lying on the bucket seat between them, and it takes everything Dean has not to lace their fingers together.
when he finally bottoms out, pelvis flush against Dean’s supple ass, he freezes, gnawing the soft inner flesh of his cheek, eyes squeezed shut to keep his composure. Dean is so tight around him, inner walls slick and hot and pulsing,
To my betas this chapter: my friend Sav, of course, who never turns down a chance to read my smut and has been my number one cheerleader for nearly a year now. And
Castiel watches the moment of his surrender, the relaxation of his taut musculature, the serenity that overtakes his expression, and it is
“Nobody’s sayin’ you have to marry the guy. Bump uglies, get your knob slobbed, take a trip to pound town, have some fun for once!”
Then Cas’ chin tips forward as if he sensed Dean watching and, holding his gaze, the hand clutching at Dean’s shoulder for purchase drifts up to caress his jaw. Cas shifts, thumbing across the bulge in Dean’s cheek and, looking at him like he hung the fucking moon, purrs, “
He stifles a cough behind his fist at the realization that Dean’s repeated his name several times without an answer. “My apologies.”
“Fuck!” The lube soothes the mild burn as the taut muscle stretches and gives, and it doesn't take long before he’s pliant and aching for the second one. “I’m… shit. I’m ready for more.”
Benny nods solemnly. “He’s right. What do you have to lose? You miss your chance, you’ll regret it.”
From day one, Cas made it perfectly clear that no matter what, Dean still has the final say, total control, yet submitting to Cas provides Dean with a sense of freedom unlike any other.
It’s never gentle, dusky swaths of coral dawn winking through a slim gap in the curtains to caress his skin, the sweet susurrus of another’s steady breathing on his pillows. It’s never curled fingers tenderly massaging his scalp, sheltering arms slung around drowsy bodies, an aura of calm and safe and
They’d agreed upon a warm palette Castiel found online of five complementary colors in three shades each, though they didn’t purchase all of them because as Dean said, “why the hell would we need fifteen damn colors? Just pick your favorites.” So he selected ivory as their primary wall color throughout the house, the six varying shades of blue and green to alternate on accent walls, and one dovetail grey for the baseboards and crown moulding.
“First of all? Fuck you, Bradbury, because now that earworm from hell is gonna torture me the rest of the day,” he says, playful tone taking the bite out of his words. “Second, isn’t that still pretty presumptuous?”
The color’s been sucked out of the world; the previously joyful, vibrant hues of summer diminished beneath a filter of his ennui and far less appealing than the view from under the blanket he loathes leaving every morning.
around Cas. The guy doesn’t judge him or prod him with questions he can’t answer. Cas just… understands, sometimes without words involved at all, and he can’t remember the last time someone made him smile so much or laugh so hard. It’s all so new and good and
A shuffle of movement gives away Castiel’s air quotes and Dean snorts, fondly shaking his head. “What about the—”
Dean makes his way across the parking lot, boots trudging through last night’s already-grey, muddy slush. He buries his hands in his jacket pockets, lamenting his failure to grab gloves on the way out of the apartment. It’s not winter yet, but for as frigid as November in Lawrence gets, it might as well be, so the minute he steps into the welcoming warmth of the convenience store he’s rubbing them together, attempting to blow some feeling back into his fingertips. At least he’s got work gloves waiting in his locker with his coveralls—pretty sure functional hands are a primary job requirement in his field.
“Yes,” Cas groans, husky and deep. “Yes, just like that. You’re beautiful. So beautiful, and all mine.”
Yet now, Dean is here to drag him out of it, even if he doesn’t realize he’s doing so. With a gentle touch on the small of his back, or a firm hand on his shoulder, a playful hip-check as they work side-by-side, or a few moments respite on the back patio sharing the refreshing cold lemonade Dean brings him, he’s pulled back to the present each time. They wipe the dirt from windows, open them, and let sunlight and fresh air fill the formerly dark, musty spaces to clear away the remnants of those strangers’ pasts. Little by little, he starts to see the potential again. The home it might one day be. And little by little, he wonders if it really could be
He inhales sharply, realizing only now he'd been holding his breath, and utters the first stupid thing to cross his mind.
He taps his knuckles on the counter to get her attention and holds up two fingers. “And uh, two beers, Meg. On me.”
,” he says derisively, “yeah, I know. Mikey said ya hung up before he could tell you the rest, though.”
, he thinks, but that fails to explain why the air feels so thick, anticipation a dense, humid fog hovering in the few inches between them and, pinned by that piercing gaze, goosebumps prickle along his damp, naked skin. He shivers, watching as Cas’ lower lip drags between his teeth. Dean longs,
“Over here all by your lonesome, I see.” Her eyes rake him up and down in a way that never fails to make him feel both turned on and a little slimy.
They open all the windows and turn on every stand-alone and ceiling fan in the house to circulate the draft, but it’s like sitting in Baby with the vents blowing hot air at his face while he waits for it to cool. (Yeah, he needs install HVAC in the house like,
“Relax, man. I’m kidding.” Dean looks away, raising his cup to his lips. After a long, slow sip, he says something under his breath that sounds like, “Unless...” but it's too soft, slipping off through the air even as Castiel strains to hear.
Years of involuntary conditioning find Castiel stirring just minutes shy of his alarm, and as always, the tranquility of those few cherished minutes begs him to linger. So he waits, willing his eyes to remain closed. Breathing, listening, the edges of his consciousness grasping at residual tendrils of a dream he’s already forgetting.
They all laugh. Andy says, “Jody’s known all of us since we were kids. Long as we aren’t making trouble for anyone or doing like, hard stuff, she leaves us alone. People here aren’t as uptight as you’d think, city slicker.”
,’” she recites, slurring her words and fluttering her eyelashes to emphasize her point about his state of mind at the time. “‘Bluest eyes to ever blue, and oh my god, that
Stepping forward to cross the distance between them, Cas calls his name, drawing Dean’s attention back to the kitchen and his waiting angel. Now mere inches apart, he feels the heat from his face expand to the rest of his body the way it always does when Cas is close.
“My sweet boy. Now take the fore and middle fingers of your other hand and tease your lips. Imagine my fingers there, prodding for entry. Slide them slowly inside. Lick them, Dean. Get them nice and wet.” Spit dribbles down his chin, trailing through his five-o-clock shadow and he moans, lapping at his thick fingers, sloppy and sinful, already so impatient for more. “Take those fingers and trace them over your jaw. Down the length of your neck. Across your collarbone.”
This is his brother; his former lifeline, once upon a time. The man he'd looked to for answers to all the world's questions, the man who in all honesty held a larger presence, was more of a father to him, than their own. Castiel has spent far too long excusing Michael's behavior, his treatment of him, of Gabriel, of everyone else on this goddamn planet as scum beneath his boot. As though they’re ants to be toyed with and crushed at his leisure, for his pleasure,
Castiel shakes his head, a tiny, surprised smile playing at his lips. “It seems this town is full of strange, albeit interesting, people.” He peers at Dean. That smile tugs a fraction wider, an unspoken insinuation in his eyes.
“Such a good boy for me,” Cas tells him, and goddamn if that doesn’t do all kinds of things to his insides, telling Dean whatever Cas wants, he will do. He’ll get on his knees, he’ll fucking grovel because Cas is perfect, always so sweet to him, Dean loves him so much and he’s practically vibrating with how badly he wants to taste and smell and touch and—
“You keep telling yourself that.” Castiel can picture his brother’s familiar smirk and eye roll just by the tone of his voice. “Come on, think of this like a-a mini-vacation! You need it, baby brother.” Gabriel sighs. “We all do.”
Then Cas crumples, shoulders shaking, both giggling like schoolgirls until neither of them can breathe and they’re both panting, tears streaking down flushed faces. Dean pushes at Cas’ chest, words on the tip of his tongue though he can’t yet speak and the sight that greets him tugs at something beneath his ribs.
“Okay, so scratch that off as paranoia. As for Dean-o, what about that whole shower thing? You said he checked you out.”
“Me too. It’s been a while, I mean. Not that long but…” He sighs, rubbing at his neck. Cas has been nothing but honest with him so far, he might as well return the favor. He owes the guy that much, for all he’s done for him. “Haven’t wanted anyone else since I met you.”
“Man, you know how Dad was with his secrets. Anyway, I’ll be flying in for the funeral, but then I have to come back to finish filming for another month. I checked it out online, though, and it’s right up your alley! You love... uh, nature,” Gabriel says, the last sentence dripping with dismay at the very idea of enjoying anything not involving scantily clad models and lush beach chalets.
That backfires quickly, though, when Dean realizes where he is and the memory of the other night hits him like a ton of bricks.
Within moments the shower sputters off and he hears the curtain rattle to the side. He expects the guy to holler through the door. What Dean does not expect, whatsoever, is for Cas to immediately fling it open, giving Dean a full gust of hot, aromatic steam right to the face.
Cas shoots a scowl over his shoulder, retorting, “I could get in trouble for letting you in after closing,” as he secures the door.
“Seriously?” Dean throws his hands up. “She’s trying to get into your pants, man! Has been since day one!”
She snickers, replying, “Yeah, don’t I know it,” as she turns away and flaps a hand over her shoulder.
Standing straight, he takes a step back and sees his body has filled out as well. Even his biceps have grown. Between eating home-cooked meals, consistently peaceful sleep, regular exercise, and frequent sunshine, he’s possibly the fittest, and healthiest, he’s ever been.
Focusing on that sweet spot just below the crown as he fists his cock, twisting his wrist on the upstrokes, the pressure builds and builds low in his groin, winding tight—oh,
It seems every trip they’ve made to the house so far, the list has grown, but he reassures Cas repeatedly that they’re simple enough fixes so long as they have the materials. They drift around each other in amiable contentment, slowly working over each room, detailing and planning out the remaining work to be done between light conversation and Dean’s occasional wisecracks.
and right when he's angling to get a view of Castiel's ass, the man slides smoothly into the seat across from him. Dean's head snaps back and he straightens, cheeks burning. Luckily Cas' eyes, blithely unaware of Dean’s gawking, drift around the room as he rolls his shirt cuffs up his forearms.
“What should I do?” Castiel whined. He hated that he still needed that, that direct orders relieved the burden of decision-making from his shoulders.
The introductions fly quickly from there. Bobby and Ellen are the next to show, with Jo and Charlie right behind. They greet Castiel with tight hugs and genuine smiles that fill his heart with warmth and calm his nerves a bit more. Meg arrives with Krissy, the waitress Castiel had seen that first night at the diner, and twins Max and Alicia who run a thrift shop in town which Dean calls a “New-Agey tourist trap”. There’s a man named Rufus, who arrives alone and merely grunts at the both of them before wandering in to locate Bobby. A sweet, bubbly, gangly man (a dentist, he's told) named Garth and his wife. Ash, from the motel, brings two other men Castiel has yet to meet who quickly help themselves to drinks and food.
The diner sits on the corner of an intersection a few buildings down from Eden Lodge with more pickup trucks parked out front and around the side than he’s ever seen in one place. He crosses the street and pauses, admiring the one car that stands out among the rest. A sleek black classic Chevrolet, shining like a beacon under the streetlamp at the corner of the sidewalk. He hums appreciatively as he strides past, giving it one last glance over his shoulder. Castiel doesn’t even own a vehicle, but he can appreciate a thing of beauty when he sees it, and her owner clearly takes great pains to care for her.
Dean has never watched the clock tick by with such rapt attention or yearned so desperately to rush home after work.
He hears a distant thud beyond the bathroom door but can’t bring himself to care because he's close,
His answering eye-roll earns him a punch to the shoulder. He assumes a pained expression and mouths, “Ow,” to which she smirks.
close and with that knowledge, he inhales deeply, rubbing his cheek against Dean’s thigh. The ghosting of lips and tongue follow that first touch, a silent plea to his lover to
and, blood thrumming hotly through his veins, he tosses the stirrer into the plastic recycling bin behind Cas.
Dean snickers, eyes chasing Castiel’s fingers as they crook around the words. He stabs at the eggs on his plate and takes another bite, talking and grinning simultaneously around the mouthful. “Just the important ones.”
Castiel rises and steps outside, digging his phone out of his jeans. He ends up spending twenty minutes on hold with the power company while Dean removes the entire A/C unit, leaving a giant rectangular gap beneath the window. He ducks his head in the door to warn Dean to keep an eye out for Claire so she doesn’t run, though he doubts she will. Dean is on the floor with his sleeves rolled up, wearing thick plastic glasses and work gloves, but gives him a thumbs up, so he closes the door and spends another half-hour arranging for the electricity to get turned on at the house.
He reaches for Cas’ head. Urges him closer, and he gets the memo, thank fuck. Cas smiles against Dean’s skin, then his lips fold around the sensitive flesh and
But, as Sammy frequently reminds him, he also drinks too much, eats terribly, and doesn’t work out as often as he should. Perhaps that's why a small nagging part of his brain eats away at him now, wondering how Cas feels about a little extra softness around the middle, if he finds Dean attractive or is simply being polite, if this invitation means what he hopes it means—
Charlie quirks her brow at him. She knows him well enough that she’s not offended, but she still doesn’t deserve that. And really, this is his fault, not hers. He hadn’t exactly been keeping her up on the up and up. The little time he’s spent at work this past week, he’s been distractedly daydreaming and staring at his phone, waiting for new alerts to come in. People were bound to notice, and he shouldn’t be surprised that one of the first is his closest and oldest friend.
He lubes up the dildo and, holding the panties once again to the side, presses the slippery-smooth head to his rim. Pushes it in slowly though he wants so damn badly to go faster, letting out a moan of Cas’ name as it pops through the tight ring of muscle and he begins to pump his hips down against it.
Dean has earned a reputation in Eden for reliability and altruism and it’s one of the things he’s most proud of aside from his brother. It wasn’t easy, and he struggled for a long time, building the shop from the ground up (literally).
Normally Bobby would give him shit, ask him something along the lines of “Ain’t gonna up-chuck on someone’s engine, are ya?” Not this time. Bobby takes one look at Dean’s face and says, “Take a few days. You need anything, call.”
The bar sits to the right of the entrance, giving Ellen an unobstructed view of the entry, emergency exit, and every table (because wherever drunk people are, there’s always a chance shit might get weird). Harvelle’s Roadhouse isn’t the fanciest place, with rough wood floors, threadbare billiards tables, and fuck all for decor besides some neon beer lights and dartboards. It smells of sawdust, peanut shells, and liquor above the faint hint of Pinesol, the music is never too soft or too loud, and it's right up his alley. It’s comfortable, clean as a small town Roadhouse can be expected to be, and it’s Ellen’s, so Dean loves it like a second home.
The following morning, Dean wakes to the stunning view of Cas’ nude, well-muscled back positioned as close to the opposite edge of the bed as is humanly possible without falling clear off it, and can’t quite make his mind up whether he’s more grateful or disappointed they’ve managed to avoid repeating Sunday’s “incident”.
“Well, we’re not,” he snaps, loud enough that a quick glance in Cas’ direction shows he heard the outburst.
His thumb strokes at the hinge of Dean’s jaw in what he hopes is a tender, comforting gesture, though whether for Dean or himself he isn’t sure. But he says, “It’s alright, Dean,” tone assured, watching forest-green eyes shimmer with emotion. “I’m not going anywhere.”
“Okay.” He sighs and reaches for a towel. “I’ll see if Zeke can meet us out there. Gimme about… half an hour to head your way.”
Dean bursts into laughter. Like, crazed person, body shaking, can’t get any air into his lungs fucking laughter because really?
“I’m sorry, that was extremely inappropriate. I don’t wish to make you uncomfortable. Let’s um, please just forget this entire conversation.”
After a few minutes alone picking through veggies gives him a chance to calm down somewhat, Cas rejoins him, his glower having thankfully lost some of its heat.
It's one thing for him to self-deprecate, and quite another for someone else to mock his reputation. Blue-Eyes glances between them, confused, but his lips twitch like he’s holding back a smile and suddenly Dean
They decide to make a trip to the local grocer in town after since it’s the only day Dean has free until the weekend. He’s excited for Friday’s party, hopeful that everyone likes Cas as much as he does, that they make him feel at home, though focusing on why that matters to him gradually brings down his mood.
“Sure thing, buddy.” The older man chortles amiably, then hooks a thumb in Claire's direction. “Glad you’re back, think this one here was about ready to claw my eyes out.”
“I mean”—she counts off each point with her fingers—“you moved in with the guy. You mention him every time we’re on the phone. I’ve seen you texting at work with this goofy smile on your face—which, woah, that’s
Dean sucks in a breath, body trembling as Castiel pries his cheeks apart with one hand and circles his thumb around his tight, pink rim. He teases slowly, gently, slipping just the tip in then sliding out and circling again, massaging the muscle into pliancy.
“Dean?” Cas says. He nudges Dean’s thigh with his knee below the counter, which does not help the situation one bit. “You okay?”
“Yes 'n' no.” Dean tips his drink back, its delicious warmth sliding over his tongue. “I was born in Lawrence, Kansas. But—“ He pauses, unsure how much he wants to reveal about himself. He’s not typically the sharing type, but he’s whiskey-happy and there’s just something about Cas that makes him easy to talk to, like Dean can trust him. That alone is weird as fuck, just different enough to worm right into his gut and compel him to listen. “My mom died when I was four,” he blurts.
If he’s honest, though, he’s nervous and a little jealous, and those aren’t common feelings for him, so Meg pushing his buttons when she damn well knows Dean’s interested soured his mood and he snapped. And now, he feels lower than the scum at the bottom of a pond because he did it
Frustrated and full of pent up energy with maybe an hour to spare before Cas finishes today’s episode of “Let’s Torture Dean Winchester”, Dean runs upstairs and into his bathroom. Might as well make the most of what little privacy he can get these days, right?
He’s half-heartedly contemplating the merits of pan crust versus rising when someone calls out, but it’s distant, muffled like there’s a thick, fuzzy wall between him and the rest of the universe. Dean blinks. The sound gets louder, clearer. Then there’s a hand on his shoulder, a strangely soothing and familiar weight, and it’s pulling him, turning him bodily around.
. Now, however, Castiel grips the kitchen island in an absolute panic because in less than an hour, their first actual guests will arrive. Some of whom he’s met, but most he hasn’t. A consistent mantra of “what ifs” keeps running through his mind, ratcheting his heart rate into a near-painful staccato rhythm.
His friend hefts him to his feet with a strained grunt and maybe Castiel is laughing, or crying, it's hard to... hard to think. His body is very heavy, his head fuzzy, and the room's lights are too bright, stinging against his eyelids. After a lot of fumbling, Dean manages to peel off the layers of sweaty, filthy clothing down to his briefs. Castiel shivers and clings. Dean lugs him to the bed, shoves a tall glass of water in his face, and plants his feet in front of Castiel with arms crossed over his chest and a pensive frown until he drinks the whole thing. Water drips down his chin, some landing on his naked thighs. He doesn't care enough to wipe it away.
“Everyone screws up sometimes. That’s just part of being human.” At his pleading look, her arms fall to her sides. “Okay, fine.”
,” Dean mutters. “He's badass.” Knocking his shot back, Dean grimaces mildly from the sting. “Anyway, I don't, uh—I don't have any regular glasses.”
he has for Cas, though, it’s telling him he wants a lot more than just a one-time lay, and the last thing he wants to do is ruin their budding friendship by coming on too strong too fast. At the last minute, he pulls on a t-shirt.
Finally, the moment comes when his breath has been too long held in his chest, lungs near to bursting, and he breaks away with a harsh gasp, sucking in lungful after desperate lungful as Dean begins marking a trail down his neck. He mutters Castiel's name between each greedy press of lips, seeking
before. This thing between them, whatever it is (lovers, partners, boyfriends?), is still kinda new although it’d hung thick in the air between them for
“Comin’ right up,” Meg says with way the hell too much innuendo in her tone. She sashays over to the cooler and quickly returns with two beers, pops the caps off, and sets them down before putting in the rest of their order. Dean doesn’t miss the way Castiel’s eyes follow her curiously, even if they don’t linger.
Cas thrusts shallowly at first, his hand still tentative in Dean’s hair but when he draws the other man forward Cas gets with the program, tightens his grip, and increases the pace and depth. He’s still careful, mindful of Dean, pausing every few thrusts to allow him a breath despite his clearly fraying control.
, and the rest of the patrons gradually return to normal volume as conversations resume. Meg hands them both clean rags, eyes still glued to Dean’s companion. She flashes a sultry smirk.
“Nothing.” Dean waves a hand, the other coming up to stroke his sharp jaw. “Have you seen it?” he says, stopping in front of Castiel.
It’s really hard for Dean not to snap right now, the biggest reason being that… well, okay, he’s actually hard, and there’s no way in hell he can move without that being obvious as fuck. Instead, he says, a little sheepish, “Thought you and Jack were watching a movie.”
Castiel takes a final pull from his beer, setting the empty bottle back on the nightstand as he swings his legs over the bed and stands. Stretching languidly, he twists his arms first over his head, then again behind his back, listening to the cracks and pops of his neck and spine before shaking his limbs loose again with a relieved groan. He glances over his shoulder just as Dean looks away, busying himself with pouring a finger of Jim Beam into two cups. Dean hands him his, in a Batman coffee mug of all things.
“I—fuck.” He swallows hard. “I wanted to ask you if-if you’d maybe try with me.” The grip on his knee tightens and his legs fall open a little more against his will like a damn invitation. “I mean, I’m no good at this, man. I don’t know what I’m doin’, and it scares the hell outta me, but… I guess maybe I’m willing to give it a shot if you are, ya know?”
He grabs a couple kolaches on his way back to the front of the store, head down, the hand not carrying everything fishing for the wallet crammed into the pocket his phone doesn’t currently occupy. And he’s in luck—there’s no line—so the second it’s yanked free he dumps the food and cup on the counter and flips it open to remove a bill.
The skin beneath Dean’s freckles flushes prettily from his admission. Castiel’s stomach flutters and heart swells. Leaning up on an elbow, Castiel arches down to capture his lips in a soft kiss, pours the words lying on the tip of his tongue into the warm, sweet cavern of Dean’s mouth, hoping that delicate touch alone can express all he feels.
“Before Sam interrupted you.” Restless, Castiel tugs a bit too hard on the skin at the corner of his thumbnail. A drop of blood swells to the surface and he wipes it on his pants, finally risking a glance at Dean. His cheeks are beautifully dark in the scant silver light.
“Cas, c’mon.” He emphasizes his haste with a thrust against Cas’ body and bites his lower lip from the little bit of friction it gives. But all the infuriating asshole does is lean toward his other nipple, lavishing it with the same attention until Dean’s positively writhing.
, he thinks grumpily. “It’s not a cure-all, but it may shorten the duration of his symptoms since you caught it within forty-eight hours. He may also take acetaminophen or ibuprofen for the pain and fever. Make sure he gets lots of fluids in the meantime.”
He settles on the bed against the pillows as Dean sets up a movie on his modest flatscreen. Something about cowboys and tuberculosis, which intrigues Castiel not in the least but Dean was both incredulous that he had never seen it and adamant that it’s a classic and, therefore, required. They binge on pizza until full and content, and as he sucks the last bit of sauce and oil from his fingers he sags, sighing and heavy-limbed, into the memory foam. He realizes now that he’s sated and moderately tipsy it's going to be that much more difficult to refuse Dean’s prior offer. He’s already on the bed, after all, and the couch is… so very far away.
“What’s going on?” Dean moves cautiously toward him, laying a gentle palm on his shoulder from behind. Castiel sags into the touch with a forlorn sigh.
“Mrrrraoow,” Claire croons, interrupting his moment of groggy introspection as she slinks up his torso to settle below his chin. He cracks one lid open, squinting up into her narrow, sky-blue eyes, visible by the light of the muted TV he’d fallen asleep to the night before. A paw soon follows, swatting tentatively at his nose.
When he’s at the register. Or stocking shelves. Or refilling the slushy machine. Or sweeping. Or putting fresh hot dogs on the roller-grill.
Dean chortles, interrupting what he can already tell is about to turn into a lengthy diatribe on the benefits of kale or some such bullshit. He twists to pat Jack’s hand where it lays near his own shoulder. “That’s why you’re the best, kiddo.”
It takes him a moment to figure out what Cas is asking for. He shouldn’t say yes, because letting this continue is only making things worse, harder. But he wants—no,
He turns to see Dean standing behind them at the opposite end of the deck and feels his heart expand against his will. In fairness, his will isn’t all that strong at the moment. The weed has done a number on his inhibitions already, and not caring feels kinda fantastic.
“I didn’t”—his eyes dart away, looking at everything except Castiel—“You know. Mean for that to happen.”
Try as he might for the next hour, he can’t for the life of him pay attention to the movie plot. He's far too lost in his head and Dean’s presence to care about the increasingly blurry picture a few feet away. Thankfully, Dean is plenty happy to ramble commentary throughout as they trade laughs and drink themselves into a pleasantly fuzzy stupor. Much different from the last time he’d been
“Ever since I was a kid, yeah. Missouri gave me my first real job actually, as a busboy. She knew my parents before they, um…” he trails off for a second. “They passed away. House fire.”
“Hello, Gabriel.” Cas listens for a minute, rolling his eyes. “Yeah, I’m here now. It'll need a lot of work first—what?” He pauses as his brother speaks, barely audible over the music. Dean thinks he hears the word “drunk” and ducks his head to hide a grin. “I'm an adult and perfectly capable of taking care of myself, thanks. Alright, fine. Yes, I'll call you tomorrow.
“How about you pick out the movie for tonight and I’ll tell you. I think they’re gonna need some uh—alone time.”
When she releases him, he rests his hip on the bathroom counter and picks up his coffee. “I know. I’m okay though." He takes another hearty gulp and sighs. "Just got my hopes up, I guess. I don’t know.”
. He shouldn’t think it, knows he shouldn’t. Half asleep and hardly coherent, murmuring in that lethargic, dulcet voice, Dean couldn’t have known what he was doing. But that doesn’t stop the throbbing between his legs, the hum of desire flooding his veins, doesn’t mollify his appetite in the least.
This was one of the first rooms they’d cleaned, previously covered in layers of dust, grime, dead bugs and scattered rat droppings. Thankfully, the old musty smell has faded and the scents of freshly-brewed Columbian roast and fried applewood bacon permeate the air instead. Still unnoticed, he observes from the other side of the counter. Dean is as infuriatingly sexy as ever, bending over in jeans that make Castiel bite his lip.
“Yeah. I suppose my greatest regret is that I hardly knew him. He was rarely home when I was young, and we were never close. Soon as my brothers and I turned thirteen, he sent us to boarding school. It felt as though he controlled every aspect of my life. Still does, sometimes, even now that he’s gone...”
don’t want or need to hear from each other. (Sexual conquests and people you fantasize about being pretty fucking high on the list. Quick mentions and congratulations are fine but for the love of all things holy, spare the details.)
Once the food is done and everyone has served themselves a plate, they sit in their chairs, forming a crescent along the shore to look out upon the water as more clouds slowly creep across the skyline. The weather is still fair, and though the wind bites more as the sun sinks below the horizon and the first fireworks begin to burst in brilliant rainbow hues against the starry backdrop beyond, it’s not enough to call it cold yet.
“Oh,” Dean says, trying not to sound too disappointed. Might as well twist the knife in a little deeper. Maybe throw on a little salt, too, because apparently, Dean’s a masochist. “Anything exciting?”
She does an exaggerated hair flip. “Yes, I am.” Then her face turns serious. “I can’t make guarantees for everyone else, though. And you’re gonna have to talk to him, eventually. Tell him how you feel. You know that, right?”
but he’s too far gone. He drapes himself across Dean’s sweaty back, mouths at the knobs of his spine, kisses and sucks every inch of skin within his reach. “C’mon baby, just like that,
Dean’s eyes are glossy and unseeing, dreamlike. It takes a moment before he’s able to focus on Castiel, to compose himself enough to slur, “Help me up? Can’t…” he trails off with an exhausted little laugh.
“You're doing wonderfully, Dean,” Cas praises. His heart's already thundering beneath his ribs in rhythm to the relentless pulses against his prostate, blood rushing in his ears, but the praise? That’s on another level. It does things to him not even touch can, and Cas knows it. Sweat trickles from his brow and, tossing his head skyward, he flicks it away from his closed eyes. “Now slick those fingers up again and move on to the left nipple. Make it hard and sore for me.”
“All part of the job, Mr. Shurley. Take this”—he hears the sound of paper tearing—“to the pharmacy in town. It closes early on weekends, so you’ll want to go right away. Seventy-five milligrams twice a day for five days.”
Castiel flops onto his back, feeling winded and confused. Here he'd been worrying about making any moves on Dean, and turns out Dean is the first to get handsy. Judging by Dean’s reaction it was unintentional, probably just coming out of a pleasant sex dream. He could have been anyone...
Saturday morning, Dean picks Cas up at Eden Lodge as he checks out. It’s the first day they’ll officially be under one roof, and Dean prepared by spending way too long in front of the stupid mirror despite knowing he’s just gonna get dirtied up again in a few hours.
In the conversation that follows, they both vow to compromise. Cas agrees to take his coffee mugs to the kitchen instead of leaving them strewn about in various rooms of the house and stop leaving his laundry in a pile on the floor of his still-unoccupied room because, “dude, there’s a basket for a reason.” Dean agrees to loosen the fuck up, stop nitpicking, and trust that even if Cas hasn’t done something
The new scenes dedicated to Castiel’s memory are fleeting and precious, innocently chaste, and yet that much more agonizing for it. Dean’s never seen what lies beneath the clothing, never heard the man gasp in pleasure or whine with need, but he doesn’t need to to get his engine revved.
Before Dean can say or do any number of the things running through his mind, Cas brushes past him and heads toward the stairs like he didn’t just almost make Dean’s heart stop.
(Cas noticed the medical drama-slash-soap opera in Dean’s Netflix queue Sunday night, and, to Dean’s immense joy and amusement, is also a fan.)
happened before. Like, not once, man. Then today, the two of you are practically having eye-sex in the middle of the grocery store.” She shrugs, letting her arm drop. “I kinda assumed that you two were together already and you were just waiting to like, make it Facebook official.”
Several minutes pass before Cas whispers, so gentle he almost misses it, “Dean?” The temptation is there to keep up the facade, pretend he’s sleeping, but curiosity wins out.
Dean just smirks and shrugs at his brother, mouthing, “so sue me”, which has been a running joke of his ever since Sammy started law school. Totally worth the bitchface it earns him, every time (and so is Cas’ firm, perfect ass in those jeans).
“Oh come on, kiddo. You know you’ve never been able to put one over on me.” She taps her temple and winks. Fucking psychics. He’s sure it’s just a bunch of mumbo jumbo, but if he’s honest, yeah, she’s eerily perceptive and it has always creeped him the hell out.
, drops to his knees, and moans as he takes Dean into his mouth. Canting his hips and fucking his hand, he sinks into that delicious, wet heat with a barely bitten-off moan and anything Cas wants, he'll give.
he wants. (His old principal said he had a “problem with authority” and Dean told him exactly where he could stick said authority. It didn’t go over well.)
He swallows the lump in his throat. It feels so weird saying this shit aloud. “The, uh—the vibrating plug and that big blue dildo. The one with the flared base.”
“I’m guessing you come here often?” Cas sets his cup on the counter and wipes a hand over his mouth. For the first time, Dean notices how long and beautiful his fingers are, heat flaring low in his belly at the thought of being touched by them, of those hands on his skin.
Cas just hums in reply before stepping into the room next door, the one he’d claimed and housed Claire in earlier. Dean hovers at the threshold while Cas rummages through his suitcase. He glances up, catching Dean still fidgeting stupidly, and smiles softly this time. “Thank you, Dean. I’ll be down shortly.”
After a brief internal debate, Castiel flicks off the lamp, crawls into the empty space beside him, covers them both, and lies down facing the sleeping man. The barest hint of moonlight filters in through one of the windows, casting over Dean’s peaceful profile and his heart clenches almost painfully and the sight.
Another time he feels something squeezing his upper arm painfully tight and grumbles into consciousnesses, pulling feebly away from whatever has its grip on him. But something pins his wrist to the bed and he hears Cas’ voice, sorta far off and dreamlike, soothing, telling him everything is alright until he calms and slips away again.
It takes a few blinks for Dean to remember where he is, why he’s there, what happened the night prior. He knows he drank and must have fallen asleep before the movie ended. He feels the scratch of denim on his legs and cotton on his torso, so he’s dressed. But he’s hard as a damn rock, his head’s resting on someone’s shoulder, there are fingers in his hair, eyes squinting at him mere inches away, the hand on his hip is real and his own is touching—
“Oh.” Cas shifts on his feet, shoulder bumping Dean’s, and his gaze darts briefly skyward as a red mortar shell explodes, casting a pretty shade over his cheeks. When he looks back, their eyes lock. “If my partner did, too… then yes.”
Bobby notices them come in and pats Cas on the shoulder. Cas’ eyes brighten immediately upon seeing Dean which gives him a warm, funny feeling in the pit of his stomach.
When he finally emerges, Dean’s nowhere to be seen. He examines the truck out front, parked in the grass beside Baby, but it’s empty. Shielding his eyes against the sun, he scans the property.
“Chill out,” she soothes. “I’m not saying you should vulcanize his whoopee stick right off the bat. Just get to know him as a friend. So you can figure out his deal, ya know?”
When the credits finally roll, Dean’s slumped over in the bed, head lolled onto Castiel's shoulder, chest slowly falling and rising with the heaviness of sleep. Even if he had the wherewithal or stamina to carry all six-some-odd feet of him downstairs to the couch, a situation which he still had positively not agreed to, Castiel’s motivation now is severely lacking.
After finding and feeding Claire, Castiel finally makes it to the kitchen and sees Dean perusing the old refrigerator for what limited ingredients they’d had the foresight to stock.
After leaving the lobby, Castiel had headed back to his room, planning to jump in the shower right away. Unfortunately, he made the mistake of sitting on the bed, and almost immediately, Claire nestled in his lap.
Within minutes of broaching the subject, Castiel is pouting indignantly, arms crossed, and Dean’s wavering between amused and frustrated at Cas’ insistence that he can sleep anywhere and it doesn’t matter. “Dude, you are
Of the three Shurley brothers, Michael has always been the smoothest; charismatic, handsome, aloof, arrogant, and perpetually dressed to the nines, he never once failed to get any woman who caught his eye. Gabriel, on the other hand… his unique brand of charm lies in humor, wit, and though he initially comes across as little more than a “sleazy sugar-addicted porn director” (as Balthazar had once aptly put it), the moment anyone sees the heart of gold beneath that snarky, overconfident veneer, they’re done for.
Meg just laughs, sweeping her loosely curled brown hair over one shoulder. “And what’s your name, handsome? Not often we get visitors in these parts.”
Cas squints, head cocked. “Yes?” he says, a little uncertain, as though he thinks Dean could ever truly forget him.
His entire body freezes, a sudden flare of sobriety crashing into his brain with the force of a sledgehammer.
Cooking has always been soothing for him, much like his work. Doing things with his hands lets him tune everything else out, and it’s that much easier when he’s doing it for others. Easier than thinking about the man smiling at one of Charlie’s corny jokes a couple yards away. Easier than sitting across a table from him every morning, Cas’ eyes sallow as he frowns at the coffee held in a death grip between both hands. Easier than watching the guy settled cross-legged in the garden, a gloved hand smearing a streak of dirt across his forehead as he wipes the sweat away. Easier than lying in bed beside Cas night after night knowing he can’t touch in the way he longs to.
“The electricity is getting turned on today. This room is paid for up to the end of the week, but I planned to stay there for a while after if it’s livable. For all I know, there could be asbestos everywhere or a cracked foundation. I didn’t check the plumbing or anything else.”
He's walking back down the hall to his room when his phone buzzes in his back pocket. Nudging the door open with a shoulder, he thumbs the screen of his phone as he lifts it to his ear.
“Boston,” he replies, smiling sheepishly. He takes another hit, staring down at the rolled paper between his forefinger and thumb as he flicks the ashes onto the step below his feet to reveal the cherry-red flare where it's lit. “You know, I haven’t done this since college. I’m surprised the local law enforcement is so blasé about it.”
Dean scrubs a hand over the late-evening growth covering his chin and shrugs. “He trained us like soldiers, wanted us to join the 'family business’. But we were just kids
He’d find Shurley senior sitting in his favorite wingback chair in his study, a glass of bourbon in one hand and framed picture of Castiel’s mother in the other. Not once did he make his presence known, though in all likelihood, the man sensed him there. No, on those nights, he’d watch and wait until his heart could no longer take it. Then slip away on quiet, socked feet, curl up in his dark, lonely bed, and cry for a woman he never knew and a father just beyond his reach. His only saving grace back then was Gabriel, who’d sneak in like he could sense Castiel’s pain without words. The elder boy would wrap his arms around him and card fingers through his hair until, sniffling into his pillow, he’d finally drift off to a blessedly dreamless sleep.
The door opens into an 18-foot-tall foyer with two rooms on either side. A dining room and office, based on what furniture remains, all covered in semi-opaque plastic sheets, and stairs by the office lead to the second floor, open to the foyer below. It’s dark inside, but enough light filters in through the many windows to reveal a thick layer of dirt and dust covering every surface and cobwebs hanging from the ceiling.
There’s no fighting it, no denying it anymore. Dean’s in love with his roommate, his best friend. This confounding, infuriating, nerdy little dude who came into his life like a whirlwind and made a permanent mark on his heart, and if this is the closest he’ll ever get to having him,
Sam leans against the counter, ankles crossed. “I’m sure it is, man. I’m surprised Dean hasn’t dug into it yet.”
Yet more often than not, at the end of a long-ass day, all he really wants is to retreat from the world, turn his phone off, hide in his room, and enjoy some me-time. Eat greasy food, have a beer or two, listen to music, watch movies and porn, masturbate. The usual.
With that, Cas rolls toward him, body fitting perfectly along his side. He winds one arm beneath his neck to wrap around his shoulder, Cas’ head coming to rest upon Dean’s chest. Despite the sweat cooling in the air on his skin’s surface, Cas is almost feverishly hot.
Dean can’t tell what’s worse; his own sudden, frustrating, and fucking inexplicable lack of game, or that Cas remains as unfazed and seemingly disinterested as that first morning. Weeks have passed, and they’ve still barely said a few polite sentences to each other.
And to my readers: each and every comment, kudos, and bookmark is a bright spot in my life that gets me through to the next chapter. Thank you!
“I’ve known the Winchester boys a long time, and Dean’s always been stubborn as a mule. Who knows how long he would have let this illness slide without asking for help. I can tell you care a great deal for him.”
The elevator had broken three months prior, and the landlord still hadn’t seen fit to fix it. Nor had he fixed the leak in Castiel’s bathroom sink, or the off-kilter dishwasher that threatens to pop from its fixtures when he pulls the upper rack all the way out.
That nagging part of Dean that always wants to fix things, to make shit right (mixed with the pent up longing for a place of his own) brimmed with the possibilities. With the right touch, it could be a home again. Could be
Who’s to say how long they make out like that, pressed up against the island. There’s no urgency in it, no desire to take anything further, just the two of them enjoying the comfort that comes with each touch—each shared breath—and it’s
Dean’s brow creases. “Yeah?” He watches as the handsome brunet raises his glass and takes another drink, eyes never leaving Dean’s once.
The first time Cas said it, that sullied part of Dean, that bit of his soul that never quite healed from those old scars, rebelled against it. Recoiled. He’d shaken it off, the embarrassment and humiliation of it wriggling and slithering uncomfortably just beneath his skin. Shame, disgust, self-loathing.
Satisfied, Dean then turns and flops onto his belly, bouncing the both of them and knocking over a small pile of jeans. That earns him a withering (but still adorable) glare from Cas, and he apologizes silently with a shrug.
He exhales with a miserable groan, pulls out his fingers, and takes a deep breath in an attempt to sound normal. With his clean hand, he answers the call without looking at the screen, puts it on speaker, and barks, “What!”
What happens instead is the last thing Dean expects. Warm and firm, Cas’ hand lands on Dean’s and squeezes gently. There’s no pity in his eyes, nothing to cause Dean to bristle, shut down, pull away. Just empathy, acceptance, validation.
Castiel makes a quiet, contented noise in his throat, appreciative of the contact. But his sweat is cooling upon his skin, sticky, and his cock has gone limp. With a sigh, he strips the condom and ties it off, throwing it somewhere over the side of the bed. Hopefully it lands in the little trash can there.
His back is to Dean, and even in the faint light, he can see Cas is curled in a tight ball. Cas trembles beneath his fingertips, skin covered in a thin sheen of cold sweat as he sobs and whimpers. He pulls, trying to turn him over, but he won’t budge. Shifting a few inches forward, he leans over Cas to see his face. He’s still asleep.
“I won’t say anything. I’m your friend, Dean. Last thing I want is to see you get hurt. I’ll talk to Jo when I get home and make sure she doesn't say anything at the party.”
Because Cas doesn’t shout. Doesn’t even clench a fist, which is somehow more terrifying than if Cas hit him outright. Instead, midway through Dean’s diatribe, Cas gets eerily quiet. Calm and still on the outside but tense and bristling within, akin to the darkening sky before a thunderstorm, face ruddy and pink from the hellish temperature.
He watches her leave, pondering. Maybe Cas’ weird stares weren’t just his imagination. It makes him feel a tiny bit better if it means he didn’t make a complete ass out of himself, because after finding out about the dude’s girlfriend he thought he’d been barking up the wrong tree the whole time. Could be Cas is like him and plays for both teams, so taken or not, he liked the attention.
When Cas releases his hand, Dean leans back, stretches his legs out, and drapes his arm over the back of the booth, trying (and likely failing) to keep the dopey grin from spreading across his face. He hopes he isn’t reading too much into this but frequent eye contact, physical touches, asking him questions about his life—gotta be good signs, right?
Playing in the once-flourishing garden out back with said grandparents watching from the porch as they sipped sweet tea under the shade, gentle grins upon foreign faces he’s only ever seen in yellowed, aging photographs. Getting grass stains on his knees from wrestling in the yard, jumping out of the hayloft in the barn onto fresh bales below despite all Father’s warnings not to. Chasing Gabriel through the house’s halls, stifling giggles when Michael barreled past their hiding spots unaware. Whispering secrets in each others’ ears as they curled together beneath a blanket fort at night with no one the wiser. Waking inside said fort to the smell of blueberry pancakes. A kind-voiced mother in the kitchen greeting them, hair haloed in morning sunlight from the window, with sweet smiles and loving touches when they finally stumbled downstairs bleary-eyed, stomachs grumbling insistently.
