“Roger that Cap”, Tony replied as he glided with ease toward the many appendages of the giant spider only to dodge just at the last second a sudden tide of rancid green spray.
Tony froze, he stood in paralyzed shock, looking down at himself he noticed blood was slowly trailing it’s way down his hands and dripping onto the ground beneath him where he’d pulled impossible hard at the restraints, but he felt no pain.
Once again the whip was brought down on his back and Tony bit his lip hard so not to scream, he could at least try to hold it together, try to stay strong as long as possible. He  knew he could take a beating- he has had good training for dealing with situations such as this,  especially after Afghanistan, but everyone has their limits, Tony just hoped the other Avengers get to him before he reaches his.
Steve let out an audible sound of relief when the video transmission showed Tony, he was still tied up, still in the same room- but he was
“Captain Rogers, I am extremely sorry to disturb you- especially so late at night, but I may be in need of your assistance”, Jarvis stated without pause.
Not one to want to show his feelings, he had quickly pulled himself together and covered up any evidence of hurt by loudly announcing that he'd won the contest and celebrating by grabbing the nearest bottle of gin. Waking up the next morning after passing out drunk with the rest of the team in the common room, he had still keenly felt the disappointment from the previous night and in a bid to be as far away from the cause of it as possible he made some excuse or other and slipped away to hide from the rest of the world... and to drink his sorrows way.
Hope... the most addictive and powerful force can be a cruel mistress, it’s that feeling of hope, even the slightest and most unlikely chances of it that can keep you sane, keep you going, but it can also keep you from the truth and keep you from accepting the inevitable. The second the rising water reached Tony’s chin was the second he accepted his inevitable, this was it, this was how he was going to die.
“Get lost Rogers, just leave me alone”, Tony slurred angrily as he tried and failed to pull an offending shard of glass from his arm. Steve didn't quite know why, but the use of his second name coming so harshly from Tony's mouth felt like a punch to the stomach.
Tony had faith in his creations and knew that Jarvis would keep him updated on any damage to his armour and any potential risk to himself. He made the split decision that bringing down the spider now in the emptied streets would be a lot safer compared to attempting the same in the part of town still full with civilians. From Jarvis' scans he located what seemed to be a weak spot just below the spider's spewing mouth.
From behind him Tony heard the sound of a very heavy duty door unlocking as four masked men entered and surrounded him, well, at least he knew where the exit was now.
“The knife has been removed, he lost a lot of blood and required a hefty blood transfusion, many of the wounds needed stitching and they've set his fractured ribs as best as possible,- there will be a lot of pain, and we have no idea what state of mind he’ll be in until he wakes up. He's being kept under for now though to allow for the remainder of the drugs to leave his system.” Bruce continued. He looked absolutely worn out,- they all did, but the relief of hearing that Tony had survived was enough to keep them going.
and he believes he's just watched him die, powerless to help, powerless to stop it. This was wrong, this was so horribly,
All of a sudden a ripple of agony coursed through his entire back and Tony was ripped with force from his brutal dream.....
“My pleasure, Captain,” he replied smoothly, and Steve couldn’t help but smile affectionately in response.
“How could I not have known Nat? How could I have been so blind when so many others could see it?! You knew, all along you knew he had feelings for me, that he.... that....” Steve struggled to even say the words, did he even have the right to after this?! He felt so much that he’d somehow failed Tony, that if they hadn’t had that stupid argument all those days ago that Tony wouldn’t have left the tower, wouldn’t have gone out unprotected – this was Steve’s fault, it was his fault and he didn’t deserve Tony’s love....
let this be real, please say this is real, I couldn't.... I..... I couldn't cope if........” Tony choked out between heaving sobs as he held on tight in Steve's hold,............ “I
you after this?!!” Steve nearly shouted, completely exasperated- he truly didn't know where all this anger had come from, but the shock of seeing Tony badly hurt from an incident that could have been avoided didn't sit well with him.
Steve just couldn't hold back anymore as he plunged straight back in for another hot and messy kiss, and when Tony once again deepened his seat in Steve's lap, he too ground back hard in response – only to be rewarded by such a filthy sound from Tony's lips that Steve thought he might finish there and then before they could even start.
He'd calculated the risks and knew he’d done the right thing during that battle, so why did Steve insist on treating him like a child? He didn't know how much more of this he could take, he'd let Steve into his heart and he hadn’t even noticed how deeply rooted he was.
As per usual, whilst they tucked in- Tony started telling Steve about what he's been working on, what he's hoping to add and  change to his armour, about new upgrades, improvements for the teams weapons and gear and Steve felt so happy in that moment, Tony looked so relaxed, so animated and enthusiastic and Steve was just so thankful for every day that he was.
Steve shuddered and groaned as he gently shivered on his side, letting out a gentle muffled cry of obvious distress. Tony looked, he looked and he saw the precious life literally flowing from the man in front of him and his eyes filled with tears.
And as if something had just snapped in Tony's mind, the inventor abruptly stood, walked round the table separating them and placed himself right on Steve's lap with his knees straddled either side of Steve’s legs and dived in for a fully open mouthed kiss.
“Looks like it shoots some sort of substance, could be acid so keep a good distance guys”, Tony called to the team.
inflicted only had Tony wishing even more for the bliss of unconsciousness, he knew deep down that it was a cowardly thing to wish for, but he couldn't bring himself to care.
“We’re working on it Captain,” Fury’s stressed voice sounded from the speakers. Steve could see that Tony was in deep distress, he was panting- struggling to take in the oxygen his body needed in panic mode as he struggled to no avail against his bonds. Steve watched as the level of water slowly crept upwards that Tony began to become more frantic, and when the water reached to just above his shoulders tears began freely flowing from his eyes.
Tony tried to get to his feet, he struggled through the biting pain coursing through his body and used the rope securing him from above and holding back a cry, he pulled himself into an almost standing position; he still felt ridiculously weak and still slightly spaced out from the drugs, lack of food and the brutal treatment he'd endured, but this was it, this was the moment he’d been waiting,-
It’s an hour later, and Steve is feeling much more put-out than he thought he would. Now, he knew not to expect Pepper to greet him with the same warm smile she used to when he and Tony were dating, but this reaction is more than he ever expected from a woman usually so calm and professional. It’s Happy who eventually calms her down, and that’s after he asks Steve to leave the room and wait in the hospital corridor. He is eventually granted access to the room again, though Pepper is still clearly displeased with his presence.
To say that the day is stressful is an understatement. Tony wakes to a small parcel on his coffee table, wrapped in plain brown paper and tied together with string, and he barely makes it to the bathroom before he’s throwing up into the toilet bowl. All that comes out is liquid; Tony can’t remember the last time he had a decent meal. The feeling of nausea accompanies him throughout the remainder of his busy day and he barely manages to hold down his coffee. This is Steve’s attempt at reconciling, he knows, his attempt at regaining Tony’s trust and earning his forgiveness, but so far all it has served to do is make Tony feel even worse on an already stressful day. Steve wouldn’t understand, he tended not to when Tony seemed upset by something he considered trivial. Before, when Steve gave him gifts, Tony would smile and blush and delight in the feeling of being loved – now it’s different. Tony knows that this is a gift of apology, not one of love, and he hates it. He hates that Steve has to apologise, and that Tony can’t simply forgive and be done with it.
Tony snorts and enters the elevator, waving goodbye to the bots as the doors shut and it brings him all the way up to his penthouse floor. The chatter has already ceased by the time the elevator reaches his floor, and the sight of everyone frozen in place while staring at the doors is what greets him once he steps out. Tony forces himself to look confused as he walks further into the living area and tilts his head to the side.
“I believe you’ve done enough today, Steve, thank you. But if you don’t mind, Happy needs some rest and having too many people in the apartment will make him restless,” Pepper states, leaving no room for argument as she motions for him to follow her. “I’ll show you out.”
“Bruce is not finding out about this,” snaps Tony through clenched teeth, chest heaving. “I don’t need his sympathy, or his charity. Are there bandages on the common floor?”
With a loud sigh, Tony walks into the kitchen and grabs one of Clint’s doughnuts from the fridge. “So,” he says, voice muffled as he speaks around the food in his mouth. “That leaves-”
Tony huffs out a breath and steps back into the centre of the ring. He swings quickly and carelessly and Natasha blocks it easily, as he expected her to, and then Tony sweeps her legs from underneath her while she’s focusing on throwing her own punch. Natasha looks up at him with a startling grin and hops up onto her feet in one swift movement, growing more powerful and delivering faster blows the more Tony is able to cause her to stumble or catch her by surprise.
Tony remains silent after that, and Steve takes it as his queue to leave. As he walks towards the exit, a small amount of hope flares in his chest and causes a smile to appear on his lips when Steve realises that
It’s weird for him, seeing Pepper in her more casual clothes for the first time in months. She looks as gorgeous as ever, though, in her denim skinny jeans, white blouse, and black blazer paired with black strappy heels. Tony sees the baby blue Michael Kors bag slung over her shoulder and recognises it as one he bought her, maybe a year or so ago.
“You have helped more than you know,” says Steve with a shake of his head. He walks towards the door but turns to smile briefly at the man laying in the hospital bed before he opens it. “Get well soon, Happy.”
Bucky remains impassive and seats himself on the opposite couch. “You should go to sleep, Stark. You’ve had a rough day.”
He’s also too emotional for Steve to return a week later with Bucky alongside him. Thankfully, they happen to show up while Tony is on the common floor in the living room squished between Bruce and Natasha, watching The Phantom of The Opera and complaining about how creepy it is. Tony manages not to throw the popcorn bowl he is holding and flee from the room when he sees who has just entered. Natasha, on the other hand, stands and crosses her arms over her chest. Tony doesn’t understand how she still looks intimidating in her pyjamas, which have animated pugs on them, but she somehow manages it and Tony envies her for it. Bruce sits up more on the couch but doesn’t make a move to stand, and instead grips Tony’s hand under the blanket to give it a reassuring squeeze.
Tony groans and rests his forehead on the cool countertop, closing his eyes momentarily as the blanket falls even further over his head. “I’m hungover,” he whines. “Shut up and let me be.”
Steve nods. “I know... and that’s why I’m not. I’ll investigate it, sure, and I’ll conveniently leave data around for him to pick up, but he won’t know that I’m even involved. As far as Tony knows, I disapprove of the whole Spymaster theory based on lack of evidence, which is why I need your help. Aside from needing your expertise, I need you to cover for me if Tony confronts you about it.”
Steve remains standing in the doorway of the bathroom, shuffling awkwardly from foot to foot. “Did you get my gift?”
Tony ignores his former teammates in favour of flexing his fingers experimentally to try and remember the feel of them in the suit. It feels just like he remembers, and possibly even better. Tony’s pulse jumps from a mix of nerves and exhilaration as the chest plate of his armour fits onto his chest and over the arc reactor firmly. Finally, the helmet flies into Tony’s hands and he stares at in contemplation before he slowly slips it on over his head. Around him, the suit comes to life after so long out of use.
Tony walks towards the corner of the room where three black punching bags dangle from the ceiling in a straight line and stares at one of the heavy bags for a moment before punching it with all his might. He then swings for another punch, and another, and another, and resolutely ignores the screaming pain in his bones as he continues to lash out on the bag which, thanks to his upgrades, has barely taken any damage minus the blood smeared all over it. Tony only pauses in his assault of the bag to wipe some of the blood from his knuckles off on his t-shirt. He’s not sure how long he is in the gym trying to take all of his problems out on an inanimate object, but it’s long enough that his once clean grey t-shirt is now drenched in blood and sweat and, hell, probably some tears. Tony only ceases punching when the pain in his hands becomes too unbearable, and when he looks down at them he finds them caked in blood and bent in awkward ways. It hurts too much to straighten his fingers out from the tight fists his right hand is curled in but, unlike the right hand, his left hand is unable to even form a fist. Tony heaves a heavy sigh and holds both hands close to his chest.
Even the great Captain America starts being nice to him, and Tony still thinks it’s a bit fucked up how he had to
“But how-” Steve begins to ask, hoping that he will finally understand how he can begin to make things right again. Pepper cuts him off abruptly.
“Why aren’t you in bed?” asks Tony in a sleep-rough tone that makes Steve’s stomach flip. He smiles at the reflection in the bathroom mirror, where he can just about catch sight of Tony’s shirtless upper half and a tuft of his unruly bedhead.
Pepper releases Tony and stands back, smiling as Tony laughs at Clint. “No, it just works like a really fast pill. Practically all of my aches are gone, and I think my bones are fully healed. That’s why I spent so long in the workshop; I wanted to check for any side effects before I told anyone.”
“FRIDAY,” says Bruce quietly as he clicks a button on his new smart watch that Tony made for him. “Can you bring up the footage from, uh, two months ago? The last time I was with Tony in his workshop.”
FRIDAY agrees and Tony quickly dresses into a random shirt and jeans and barely gets time to tug a pair of socks onto his feet before he hears the elevator arrive. He emerges from his bedroom warily and sees Barnes already sitting on the couch. Tony feels a sense of déjà vu and his mind supplies him with the blurry image of Bucky sitting on the couch across from Tony, talking about Tony’s
“Alright, alright,” mutters Tony, throwing his hands up into the air. He rummages around for the spare pair of clothes that he usually keeps in the workshop, and grins triumphantly when he finds them and slips them on. “I’ll go up to them. God, when did you become such a nagging mother?”
Bruce’s eyes widen as he finally realises what Tony is talking about. He seems torn between denying that he said anything and making an excuse for himself. After a few seconds, Bruce appears to decide on the latter. “I was trying to be there for you. You need help and you were never going to get it yourself.”
“Anything to make you feel included, Cap,” mutters Tony with a roll of his eyes. Steve pats Dum-E’s claw gently and barely manages to hold in a sigh.
Tony and Nat continue to converse between themselves with occasional interruptions from Bruce while he works, but Natasha cuts her rant about Clint constantly begging for a dog short and her ears perk up. Tony hears Bruce putting his work down and walking slowly across the room until he comes close enough to be seen on camera again. Tony is confused and worried up until he hears the muffled voice of Barnes yelling for Bruce. The door bursts open just as Natasha minimises the video chat on the computer screen - Bucky being unable to see Tony but Tony being able to see and hear everything. He holds his breath and tries not to make a sound.
“I have been informed that Captain America has been doing some research, sticking his nose in where it does not belong. He also visited the two people that you
Tony’s suit jacket lay folded up beside him, along with his tie, and his shirt sleeves have been rolled up so he can feel the light breeze on his skin. With a sigh, Tony kicks his legs out and looks down at the streets below him. He’s tempted. Oh, so very tempted, but his promise to Bruce is still fresh in his mind and Tony doesn’t want to disappoint Bruce more than he already has. It doesn’t stop him from thinking about it, though. A noise comes from the living room and he looks back over his shoulder in alarm to see Clint jumping down from the vent, the panel laying discarded on the floor. Once he spots Tony outside a smile lifts his lips, but it isn’t a particularly happy one.
“There’s still some in the pot,” says Bruce in lieu of a greeting, nodding towards his cup of coffee that Tony now notices has an animated picture of a cat in a lab coat on it.
, looks rather ordinary compared to the chaotic, technologically advanced mess that is the rest of Avengers Tower. At first glance one would assume that Tony was too busy to bother re-furbishing the gym and therefore paid it no mind, but the gym has just as much Stark Tech as any other room in the Tower and was built to be able to withstand even the wildest of incidents (read: Thor and Steve trying out their Mj
Clint shrugs his shoulders innocently. “It wasn’t intentional. The Widow’s Bite affected the direction of the arrow. The TV was just in the wrong place.”
An hour later sees Tony cursing Natasha and the entire universe because of her ‘light exercise’. He lay in the middle of the boxing ring, wheezing and spluttering while Natasha calmly sips at her bottle of water and watches Tony with a small yet genuine smile. She waits for Tony to hoist himself up using the rope of the ring before she sets her bottle down and raises her fists. Tony rolls his eyes yet raises his also and they begin sparring again, Tony managing to block a few punches until a very powerful blow knocks him in the stomach and he stumbles backwards, suddenly feeling woozy.
The elevator doors open and, after exchanging dubious looks, Natasha walks silently onto the floor and blends in with the shadows by the far wall as Tony takes a more direct route and walks into the middle of his floor. Out of the corner of his eye, he sees Nat walking down the corridor cautiously to clear the area. Talk continues to walk further into his penthouse and, just as he reaches the living room, his step falters. The double glass doors leading to the landing pad are blown wide open and, as Tony creeps closer, he can see that something has been written on the ground with red paint.
“And what if next time you don’t? What if you decide to get back into old habits but when I find you, it’s too late? How am I meant to deal with that? How are any of us meant to cope after that? Don’t forget that there are people that still give a shit about you, even if you don’t.”
, Tony thinks as he listens to it crackle. He thinks he can hear sirens and lots of yelling in the background and his chest tightens with worry. Tony swallows thickly and ignores the way that his body stiffens, palms beginning to sweat as his hands clench into fists.
Eventually, she pulls away with mascara smeared around her eyes but otherwise seems perfect. Tony, though not in love with Pepper anymore, still thinks she looks beautiful. He rubs her arms comfortingly and steers her towards a rather uncomfortable chair pushed against the wall with little resistance.
I’m already a doctor,” says Tony around a shit-eating grin, and he walks further into the open space of the living room and plonks down beside Happy on their sofa. With a look over his shoulder, Tony can see straight into the kitchen through the large arch-shaped opening and he catches the roll of Pepper’s eyes. “But I don’t mind being the nurse as long as I get the outfit.”
Steve wakes up with a lazy smile on his face, turning over onto his side to wrap his arms around his sleeping boyfriend only to find the space empty. He frowns and, with his eyes still closed, gropes around the cool bedding before he finally gives in and peels his eyes open. Worry sets in as Steve sits up in his bed, wondering where Tony could possibly be gone, until reality bites him in the ass. Hard. The super soldier sighs softly and lay back down in his bed.
For those curious, Ptichye Moloko (in English: Bird's Milk) cakes are famous Russian soufflé cakes and is also a popular candy.
Natasha raises an unimpressed eyebrow at him. “He wasn’t that hard to miss, Steve. Don’t blame me for your lack of observational skills.”
The doors slide open and Tony stumbles into the car park. Rhodey manages to steady him, though he nearly falls out of his wheelchair in the process. Natasha unlocks the black SUV and carefully guides Tony into the backseat while Rhodey takes the passenger’s seat. She straps Tony in, mindful of his hands, and allows her eyes to linger on the dazed expression on her friends’ face before she sighs and closes the car door. As she folds Rhodey’s wheelchair up to place in the boot of the vehicle she casts Steve a glance over her shoulder and raises her eyebrow.
A brief flash of hurt appears on Steve’s face before he flees from the room. Bucky makes an attempt to give chase, but Natasha grabs him by the flesh arm and shakes her head. He could easily break free from her grasp if he so wished, but Bucky realises that it’s probably best if Steve cools down for a bit. He’ll find him later.
“Don’t be an idiot, Tony,” says Bruce, voice gentle despite his hands clenching and unclenching into fists. “What are you going to do? Fly around Manhattan looking for him? Give him the perfect opportunity for an air strike? We don’t know the first thing about him, Tony. You’re being foolish.”
“Nicely done, Tony,” she praises, and he releases her wrists and falls down onto the mat beside her with a smile.
’ This only solidifies Tony’s theory. He will kill Spymaster for Happy, and for Pepper, and for himself. He sees both sides, and chooses the one he thinks will end more positively for him and the people he cares about. He needs to do this. It’s the best option.
“Sounds awfully like FRIDAY’s askin’ you out on a date, Stevie,” Bucky snickers. Steve whacks him on the arm.
With that, he disappears into the elevator. Tony rubs a hand over his face and hopes it wasn't all a dream.
If Sam notices the awkward tension, he doesn’t mention it and instead launches back into the story. By the end of his tale, Clint is laughing into his fist and Wanda is giggling, and Tony’s smile is small but genuine, which is a rarity these days. It fades away quickly, though, and he’s almost certain that he hears Natasha sigh from across the room.
Sorry for the lack of updates recently! I've been having some personal issues lately, but let's hope that I manage to write another chapter for Friday. Apologies for how terrible this is but I did my best.
Pepper gives his shoulder an encouraging squeeze and then turns swiftly on her heel to walk back to Happy’s private room. Steve stays standing in the corridor for another long moment, watching as she disappears through the door, and then he eventually continues his journey to the fire escape stairwell and through the back exit to avoid being seen.
and Pepper seems to deflate like a balloon, giving him a sad look. Tony swallows and looks away from her. “He sounded just like Howard. I spent 21 years dealing with him, so there’s no way that I’m going into business with another abusive bastard just like him.”
“All I want is for you to be able to defend yourself if the suit is inaccessible. Is that too much to ask?” Natasha continues without waiting for a reply. “You could do it before, and you can do it again. With a bit of practice you’ll be back to being a skilled fighter in no time.”
Natasha nods and barrels on, turning her gaze on Bruce next. “And Bruce, what did Tony do when the two of you hardly knew each other on that SHIELD helicarrier?”
Tony is relieved to find that, upon scanning everyone’s faces, they all seem to believe him and look rather impressed. It isn’t such a far-fetched lie, either, considering the amount of time Tony usually spends in his workshop without coming out for food or sleep. The only one that looks slightly doubtful is, surprisingly, Steve. Tony ignores the look of uncertainty on the blonde’s face and clears his throat.
“It’s your lucky day, Tony,” she says as they enter the elevator. “We’re only going to the gym to do some light exercises. Maybe next week we’ll head down to the training room and get an
“That’s always been the thing,” says the smaller man. He chuckles dryly and scrubs a hand over his face, which catches on his goatee. “You would fight and die for me within reason, but I would kill for you without hesitation. That’s why I’m doing this, don’t you see? I’m killing myself slowly, just like you wanted two months ago.”
“You’re asking about what happened because you’re looking out for Tony and making sure he doesn’t run himself into the ground; yes or no?”
“Every time I think I’ve made my mind up about you, you surprise me,” he tells Tony, who laughs coldly.
have the morning to themselves, they usually always spent it catching up on precious sleep or lazy morning handjobs. A part of Steve always wished for a quieter, domestic life with Tony so that they could enjoy mornings in bed together and actually eat home-cooked meals instead of a constant string of take-out but, hey, they were still happy so that’s all Steve cared about.
“And lastly, Steve. When you and Tony first met you two really did not like each other but, eventually, the both of you really started to get along. Tony encouraged you to start drawing again, to get your own apartment despite you being here constantly anyway, and he helped you adapt to the future. He would cancel important board meetings and press conferences just to be with you if you were having a bad day, and he would sit and listen to you talk about the past and your guilt over letting James fall and about Peggy, all without hesitation.”
“No, thank you,” she replies, shaking her head so that her ponytail flicks from side to side. “The doctors have some tests to do later which should take a while, so I’ll be heading home then.”
The line goes dead. Tony releases a long breath and runs a shaking hand over his face. “FRIDAY, get the jet ready. I’m going back to Manhattan,” he orders, voice wavering as he turns off the lights before exiting the home and locking the front door. From that moment on is a blur to Tony. He doesn’t remember getting into the expensive rental car and speeding the entire way to the airport hangar, nor does he remember how many red lights he runs past in his anxious state, nor does he remember the 5 hour flight back to Manhattan. The moment the jet touches down back home, Tony is hurrying to unlock his Audi and speeds away from the airport and down the busy streets to reach the hospital.
Tony grunts noncommittally and pulls Steve back a step so that they’re really pressed together and Tony’s face is now more or less in his armpit, meeting Steve’s eyes in the reflection of the mirror from where he can see out from under Steve’s sweater-clad arm.
It seems like their sparring match will never end, given how stubborn and skilled they both are, and Tony is honestly just astounded that he hasn’t started panting yet. Eventually, Natasha is the one who calls for a time out, and that is only because Tony threw her too hard against the mats and she dislocated her shoulder. Tony watches as she pops the shoulder back into place with practiced ease and he suppresses a grimace at the sound, which has Natasha smirking at him.
“Barnes, I’m doing you a favour here, so you can be an ass later when your arm doesn’t hurt, alright?” snaps Tony. Surprisingly, Barnes nods and takes a seat on a stool, looking at the screen expectantly.
“What happened, Tones?” murmurs Rhodey. He sounds hurt and upset and Tony attempts to curl in on himself, hissing in pain when Natasha digs her nails into his shoulders to prevent the action.
“You too, Pepper,” he says. Rhodey turns to look at Tony and raises his eyebrows at him. “You look like shit. C’mon, you’re coming back to the Tower with me so you can shower and get something to eat. Pepper, you need us to get you anything?”
Before Tony can reply, the air vent is kicked in and Clint drops onto the ground and draws his bow, reading to fire at the first sign of an attack. When all he sees is Tony and Rhodey, he raises an eyebrow and slowly lowers his weapon in confusion.
For a moment, Tony stares at Bruce like he’s the dumbest man he’s ever met. Bruce isn’t offended, and he merely waits until Tony says what he wants to say. It comes out after another long moment of silence. “Has it not occurred to you,” he whispers quietly. “That maybe I don’t want to get better?”
“So you could, what, bring me to a therapist and I’d magically get better? Give me more pills? I’d rather drink myself to death,” sneers Tony.
Tony never mentioned it again; he never got the chance to. All of the memories of their previous arguments that Tony used to hide away until he was feeling really bad about himself seem so foolish to him now. His smile feels brittle and unpleasant upon his face.
Tony wakes up weeks later in a hospital room with a sleeping Rhodey in the bed beside him and barely has time to think
“Agent Romanoff is accompanying Dr. Banner to a robotics conference in Queens. They will be leaving early tomorrow morning and will not be returning to the Tower until the next day.” Tony opens his mouth to speak again, but FRIDAY cuts across him. “Mr. Wilson will be visiting family and won’t return until late tomorrow evening, and Agent Barton is accompanying Ms. Maximoff to a date with the Vision.”
“How did you just decide to walk away even though you knew you loved him? I know I still don’t fully understand all these emotions, but I can’t imagine ever willingly letting go of someone that you love. Did it not hurt?”
Pepper breathes a large sigh of relief and her shoulders slump the tiniest amount. Tony squeezes her hand gently and she squeezes back with a small smile.
“Think with your head, not your heart.” Pepper places a hand on Steve’s shoulder and he glances up to meet her eyes, which have softened considerably. “You’ll be surprised how much falls into place once you do.”
Steve hesitates for a moment before releasing a sigh. “Yes, I knew. I’m sorry I never told you, Tony, but I didn’t want to hurt you. You meant too much to me, and I didn’t want to lose you over something so sm-" Steve cuts himself off abruptly, eyes as wide as saucers. He clears his throat and tries again. "I mean, over something like this.”
Tony stands from his workbench and stretches his arms over his head. “Have we figured out how Spymaster gained access to the Tower yet? Or how he managed to disable your audio and visual feed connected to the penthouse?”
report is that the Extremis seems to have settled into your bloodstream without further trouble. Would you like me to regularly conduct scans to assure your health?”
Natasha squeezes his shoulder again comfortingly and she gives him an encouraging smile before turning her gaze upon Sam, Wanda, and Bucky who are standing side-by-side in the kitchen. “Tony barely knew Sam and even fought against him, but that didn’t matter when he found out that the community centre would be demolished and never rebuilt. Tony funded it’s refurnishing, and continues to fund it to this day so that Sam can continue his support groups there because he knows that it’s Sam’s way of coping as well as his way of helping others.” Sam looks away from Natasha’s eyes and twiddles his thumbs awkwardly.
“What can we do for you, Steve?” asks Happy with an awkward smile, hoping to diffuse the awkward tension in the room.
. Happy’s in a bad way, they’re about to take him away in an ambulance and I’m going with him, but I had to call and tell you.” Pepper’s voice is frantic and full of worry, and she sounds like she’s trying very hard not to cry. What she says next leaves Tony feeling vulnerable and scared and downright
Tony wakes the next morning with yet another excruciating pain in his skull. He groans softly and wraps the blanket around himself like a hooded cloak when he stands on unsteady legs. Ignoring the photographs on the table, Tony makes his way into the kitchen to scavenge for something to eat, only to discover that his cupboards and the fridge are empty. He groans again.
It takes less than five minutes for all of them to reach the kitchen, and when they do they look on in pity and mild horror. Bruce, Natasha, and Rhodey are the only three who dare to approach the mess of an engineer. Natasha has to hold Tony’s shoulders back to make sure that he doesn’t make any sudden movements and looks on in sympathy as Bruce announces that Tony definitely requires medical attention, and Rhodey pulls his wheelchair up next to Tony’s seat and allows his best friend to rest his head on his shoulder.
“I know,” Tony cuts in. Steve’ entire being screams painfully awkward right now, and Tony sighs. “Well, Cap, I guess you’re off duty and free to go. Barnes is probably wandering around the Tower like a lost puppy without you.”
“You know,” says Tony later. He and Bruce are working side by side in Bruce’s special lab in the Tower just like old times, except for the unusual silence that has fallen amongst the two scientists. Whenever they worked together in the past Bruce merely listened to the other man’s incessant babbling and made interested sounds when appropriate. He never thought that he’d miss the constant stream of conversation, but now he craves it more than anything. “This isn’t just about Steve. He’s only one problem amongst the dozen others.”
Things grow worse over the period of two months. It takes a while but Tony eventually develops a small level of trust with some of the others. He realises that Sam is actually a really nice and sincere guy, and Clint, well, Tony has always had a secret soft spot for the archer. Wanda is still incredibly stand-offish around Tony and vice versa, but they get by with small talk and awkward half-smiles. They don’t see much of Scott, but when they do he and Tony are capable of a little joking around and enough conversation to prevent it from getting awkward. He outright avoids Steve and Bucky at every opportunity, and Tony avoids all human contact from people that aren’t Pepper, Rhodey, Bruce, and Natasha.
“Nat, put me on full screen,” he orders. Natasha complies instantly, though she shoots him a wary look before turning back around to look at Bucky, who stares at the camera in surprise.
Rhodey shows up the next morning in his wheelchair, takes one look at Tony, and promptly rolls over his best friend’s foot. Tony wakes with a startled yelp, which amuses Pepper and coaxes a smile out of her. She releases Happy’s hand to walk around the bed and hugs the Colonel tightly. He hugs her back with a warm smile.
“Sorry, boss, no can do. Ms. Potts is still on vacation, and one representative from Stark Industries must be present at every meeting of great importance to the company. And no, sir, these meetings cannot be postponed as they already have been on numerous occasions. Perhaps another Avenger can keep watch until your duties are done?”
Tony hears the faint rustling of a newspaper and turns his head to see Bruce draining the last of his coffee and setting the newspaper down. He smiles encouragingly at Tony. “I have some work to do for the morning, but feel free to join me later and we can work on that project some more. I have a few new ideas that could really speed things along.”
Tony doesn’t want to chance running into Steve or Bucky or anyone on his way out. He slips a zip-up hoodie on over his pyjama top and an old pair on converse onto his feet and takes the elevator down to the underground car park, adjusting the strap of his bag on his shoulder anxiously. He hasn’t been away from the Tower for quite a while, and even at that it hasn’t been for more than a few days, so Tony feels rather nervous about returning to his Malibu house. He knows, realistically, that things will be fine without him, especially now that Bruce has returned to keep an eye on things, but that doesn’t help make him feel any better.
“Okay, yes, I’ll do it,” Steve splutters. He feels too surprised to do much of anything else, and he’s positive that it shows on his face. “If- If you’re sure no one else can, then of course I’ll do it.”
Barnes finally seems to realise that his presence is unwanted and makes a quick escape, only hesitating in the slightest as he passes Tony. The elevator doors open for him and as soon as they shut again, Tony’s knees buckle from beneath him. Shaking hands come up to cover the glowing reactor protruding from his chest as he heaves and sobs. He can still feel the metal arm wrenching and twisting in a desperate attempt to end Tony’s life, can still feel the immense pain in his chest caused by the pressure placed on it, and can still see Barnes’ features twisted into a snarl as he tries to kill Tony in the worst way possible. It never fails to remind him of Obadiah, and that just ends up setting off a whole new wave of anxiety and anger. Tony isn’t sure when the panic attack subsides and when the sobbing begins because they both feel the same, and isn’t that realisation just a kick in the teeth?
Upon walking back into the living room, he discovers that no one has left and rolls his eyes. Rhodey glares hatefully at the bottle gripped in Tony’s hand.
“Have a safe journey, sir,” she says. “Agent Barton is inquiring where you are heading to, boss, shall I give him the message?”
“Great.” Tony nods a little to himself and quietly exits his bedroom. He rides the elevator down five floors and continues to tread lightly as he heads towards his destination, which is the specially modified Avengers gym. Tony isn’t sure what possessed him to come here of all places, since it’s usually the Captain’s happy place in the Tower whenever he needs to burn off some steam, but Tony doesn’t think an engineering binge is what he needs right now and therefore the gym seems like the next best place. Besides, he likes the quiet.
“So, we’ve figured out that whatever you’ve done to yourself is working pretty well in terms of self defence,” she says as they head towards the exit.
Days later, Tony is wearing a crisp grey suit with a white shirt and a sky blue tie that had been loosened the second the board meeting concluded, and is walking down the corridor trying to ignore Pepper’s voice, which is steadily growing louder and louder as they near the elevator and the distance between them and the lobby grows. The doors to the elevator open without Tony having to say a word and he continues to stay silent the entire ride up to the common floor in hopes that by the time they reach their destination Pepper will have calmed down. She doesn’t.
“Mr Stark, it’s a pleasure to have you with us,- well I can see that my colleagues have provided you with our finest lodgings,” a cold and self-important voice sounded from behind him, “It’s nice to see you settling in so well.”
Steve called his name again and gestured to the food on the counter - raising his eyebrows in invitation when Tony finally looked up.
he stated, and was now looking Steve straight in the eyes for the first time since he’d found Tony down here.
Tony continued to breathe in, long and deep as he slowly calmed down from his panic. He was staring back into Steve's eyes, and before Steve had realised it- he’d leaned forward, still with Tony's face cupped in his hands to bring his lips to Tony's in the sweetest of kisses. Time stopped, and the edges of his world all zeroed down to the man in front of him as Tony kissed him back. It seemed as though it was all the physical confirmation that Tony needed because as he raised his hands to grab hold the front of Steve's shirt and pull him closer in a tight grip.
Steve chocked out his name in a sudden sob of relief, Tony was curled up on his side facing away from Steve, and hadn't responded to the call of his name. Steve consciously decided to approach him carefully, the last time Steve had seen Tony he'd been drugged and could still be disorientated, and the last time Tony had seen Steve, well... he thought he'd watched him die. Though the closer Steve got to Tony, all restraint in his approach was lost and he darted to Tony's side in the blink of an eye once he'd noticed the hilt of a knife lodge in the inventors thigh.
Tony smiled sweetly as he was pulled down and went with no resistance and Steve's heart just swelled at that. He reached over and grabbed a near by napkin to swiftly clean them both off before the mess they'd created became too uncomfortable, and Steve definitely didn't want that since he felt so content- he didn't want to move.
Steve followed Natasha running as quick as their legs would carry them down to one of the main conference room,- Clint and Bruce were already gathered around the large Oak table looking as though they'd both ran a marathon to get there. The large screen covering a vast area of the left side wall was currently on, screen split in two with one half showing an unusually concerned looking Nick Fury, and the other half was just pitch black.
“Of course Jarvis, what is it, what's happened?” Steve said already swinging his legs out of the bed.
Steve took in the look on Tony's face, he was very pale and slightly clammy, he was starting straight back at Steve and he realised just how close he was to the man below him, still with his face carefully cupped between his hands. Tony’s eyes seemed to dart between Steve’s and his breathing seemed shallow and quick. He was so worried that Tony may have been seriously injured that the relief in finding out he was not was almost all consuming. They were so close and the inches between them only compelled him closer...
He was sat with Clint and Natasha in a small waiting room whilst Bruce had gone with the doctors to assist with the surgery since he knew more about Tony's arc reactor than anyone else, barring Tony himself, and could be useful if there were any complications with regards to that.
Tony hadn't realised he'd actually closed his eyes so he thought he'd make the effort and see what had their Captain in such a worry.
Crawling, things were crawling all over him, was it bugs,- ants?! Tiny little ants, no wait- they were metal, little metal ants... And they were biting, God damn it they were biting him all over and it
He looked over his team occupying the rest of the jet, Clint was busying himself with flying, Bruce was checking over their medical equipment,- he’d said it’d be best to prepare for any eventuality since they didn’t know what may happen to them or Tony in the next few hours.
He thought back to the last conversation he’d had with Tony and God it filled him with self loathing, he’d literally told Tony he didn't trust him, but that's so completely far from the truth and it made him feel sick to the stomach. He can't let that be the last thing he says to Tony, he can't let him die thinking he doesn’t trust him, doesn’t respect him,- doesn’t love him.
“Stark, fall back and we’ll assess how best to bring this thing down safely”, Steve ordered, eyeing how close Stark was to the Spider’s gaping jaws.
Bruce left the room swiftly stating that he needed some air, and Clint too left promptly not saying anything verbally, but Steve could see he was physically taut as a bowstring.
He then heard a sudden hiss and intake of breath from behind one of the counters, Steve carefully headed in that direction.
Steve Rogers loves you, he loves you and there's no hiding it, no denying it, it’s written all over his face, his body language- his actions, and believe me I've had my best team researching into this, and I've seen it first hand- with my very own eyes that day you you fell after my robot creation knocked you from the sky after you
Steve could fully imagine Tony, stubborn as always, depriving himself of the life giving water he needed by refusing to give into the mind games his captors were obviously playing. It is a well known technique for slowly bending and manipulating someone to your will, to start off with offering and providing what their prisoner needs in exchange for receiving small things in return- such as saying please, or giving unimportant information. This then creates a false sense of security and before too long, they can find themselves spilling their darkest secrets in order to get what they need and what their captors promise to give.
Searing pain suddenly flared up in his chest as a result of his struggles against the restraining hands, they were trying to hold him down, keep him captive and he just couldn't let them hurt him more, it was too much! He could just about make out the sound of sometime calling for him to be put under again and his thrashing attempts at getting away from what he knew was to come were to not avail as he felt the now familiar jab of a needle and he slowly succumbed to the darkness once again.
Breathing through the pain Tony held back unbidden tears, he looked around the room, to try and prepare himself for what was to come. He noticed that both the table and camera were gone from the room, however he noticed a smaller camera mounted high on the wall opposite him, red light blinking as if mocking him.
The argument with Tony had been nothing more uncommon to the previous ones they’d had at the beginning when the team had first moved into Stark tower, the pair of them seemed to butt heads from the very get go.
“Tony! What on earth happened, what did you do?!” he nearly shrieked whilst quickly crouching down to assess the damage. Tony was clearly inebriated and Steve could only presume he’d drank most of that whiskey before lodging what looked like half a bottle of glass into his arm.
Steve to see him- to see the emotions and feelings he held, but whatever Steve had or hadn't seen- he drew his eyes away, he
“I assume Dr Banner has informed you of the current situation- we've settled Mr Stark down and although we can't tell precisely when he'll come round, he will most likely be under for a while. There is a rest room with a shower stall adjacent to this room and we’ve set out fresh towels and clothing for you all. We've brought in some chairs but if you need to reset there are family rooms just down the hall from here, we’ll bring you all something to eat and drink in a while but please don't hesitate to ask any of us if there's anything you need,” the nurse said kindly before making to exit.
All was going to plan in evacuating the civilians closest to the attack and the ants appeared relatively easy to destroy, all seemed to be going a little too easy. As if on right on cue, a grotesque bone chilling screech sounded through the city as what appeared to be an enormous robotic spider ungracefully clambered between the city buildings.
Within the blink of an eye – his captor lunged and brutally gripped Tony's face in an unbreakable vice like grip as he bared his teeth in apparent anger.
Tony's mental state also improved drastically over the past few weeks. Almost every time he’d awoken in the hospital it was to the sound of his own screams, - some were the echo of fear and pain, and some were cries for Steve, for Steve not to die and not to leave him,- and Steve’s heart broke just a little more each time this happened, and each time he would hold Tony close and calm him down by speaking softly and promising Tony that he was alright, that they were both ok.
Because of this , Bruce was to wait on the jet and keep it out of sight until they were ready to depart- they didn’t want the Hulk to go crashing in and giving away their position. Clint was to enter the building via the vents from the roof, Natasha from the buildings rear entrance and Steve from the front. There didn’t appear to be any patrols probably since it was horribly cold outside so entering the building shouldn’t be too much of a problem. They were then to work through the building in search of Tony and to alert the others if they found the room he was being kept in.
Let him go, please- I'm begging you, don't hurt him, you have me- you don't need him...” Tony begged with no other option but to pray that he could somehow appeal to his captors mercy, Steve was the most important person in his
quick he’s hurt- he’s been stabbed in the leg- knife’s still in there,” Steve shouted breathlessly and stepped back to allow Banner, who was quickly approaching with his med kit to administer first aid.
In getting to know Tony, Steve could tell that the man was an expert in hiding and covering up what he was really feeling, but he’d slowly learned to distinguish Tony’s fake smile- all teeth and a sharp glint- from the genuine warm smile that all too infrequently lit up his face.
Tony sucked in a sharp breath as he tasted the metallic tang of blood fill his mouth only for his captor to do the same again, only twice as hard, and continued to hit Tony with no restraint, and no compassion.
Ok, so things are going to get a lot worse before they get better..... But I do promise a happy ending..... eventually  :)
Steve hurried out of his room and ran quickly to the nearest elevator to take him down the Tony. The ride down felt like an eternity as he stood there not knowing what to expect, he hadn’t seen Tony for around 7 days and had the feeling that the inventor had been hiding himself away and avoiding everyone.  On many occasions within that last  week Steve had asked Jarvis how Tony was, or to invite him to join them for lunch, or even if he wanted to join them for a movie,  however each time Jarvis responded with
Steve broke out in a sudden cold sweat, the undertone of worry lacing Natasha's voice was never a good sign, she was an even greater expert than Tony at hiding her emotions, so to hear her sound so concerned filled Steve with unimaginable dread.
Suddenly, there was a strong pair of hands cupping either side of his face and it sounded like someone was asking him a question, it sounded like Steve, though he sounded far away, and why did he sound so worried?
“Got your favourite, think I've ordered enough for ten, but I'm sure we can manage it between us,” Steve said with amusement and no doubt in his mind as he went and sat on the large sofa by where he'd placed the food. Tony hummed in approval on inspection of the bags and placed himself opposite Steve on a higher swivel chair.
“We’ll get him back Steve,” she said in determination, voice full of compassion, “He's strong, he can make it through this, we will find him.”
Steve ran on first as fast as he could and as gently as possible, he laid Tony down across the longest stretch of seating to the side of the jet. “BRUCE!
Both Steve and Natasha moved to one side to allow the medical staff better access to check Tony over as they both attempted to calm their rapid breathing.
Steve noticed the way Fury looked at Natasha, and how they both shared a real look of concern, “What did you hear?” Steve asked tuning to Natasha, completely impatient to know.
“Our guest looks a little cold boys, lets show him a bit of hospitality,” he heard the sound of his captor say whilst walking away towards the door, “See if he enjoys it.” The door to the room clanged shut and leaving Tony standing alone in apprehension of what was to come.
“Jarvis said you were hurt and he thought you might have needed some hel...” “No”, Tony quickly interrupted, “why
Before he even realised- Tony was heaving in panicked and racking sobs to the point of almost hyperventilating. He screamed for Steve at the top of his lungs as tears freely feel, but Steve didn't move. His captor had won, he'd taken the most precious thing on this earth from Tony, he’d destroyed Steve,- he’d destroyed Tony and he didn't know how he could keep going after this.
“Fury, we need a track on this signal!” Steve demanded with no restraint, he subconsciously took a step toward the screen, he so desperately wanted to do something- anything, he would switch places with him in a heart beat if it were only possible-
But Tony didn't scream, or didn't struggle this time, he just stared through bleary and red rimmed eyes at Steve before slowly sitting half up right and drawing in one single harsh and shuddering breath.
“ Steve, we need to prep- full battle gear, med kits, comms – the lot, they obviously don’t expect us to actually find them any time soon since they went to so much trouble in covering their transmission signal so hopefully we’ll have the element of surprise, but we have to be ready,” Natasha said with confidence, the strength in her voice transferring to Steve as he shook his head and pulled himself up off the floor.
The unexpected shock and pain had him lurching forward with a cry. What the hell?! The last thing Tony could remember was resting on the ground eating the food and drink they had brought in for him, and then .... Oh, the unnatural speed in which he’d become heavy eyed and sleepy, ... so, he’d been drugged, again.
“No, no- Tony don’t try to move, you're badly hurt, Tony- look at me – we’re getting you out of here, I promise, just stay awake for me, can you do that?” Steve asked as calmly as he could keep his voice. Steve noticed with dismay that his pupils were blown, so his captors had obviously drugged him
Steve knew this was bad, they could do anything with this fake Steve and Tony would have no idea it wasn't him,- then he heard the captor's reply to Tony's begging and God he hoped in vain that the man would take pity, have mercy- anything!
“Tony?” Steve called softly, not wanting to startle him, “It’s only me, Jarvis asked if I could come down and check on you”. Steve rounded the corner only to find Tony splayed none too gracefully on the floor surrounded by what looked like the shattered remains of a couple of really expensive looking bottles of whiskey, and damn it of the foolish man wasn’t stupidly pulling out some rather nasty looking pieces from his forearm!
Whilst all his confusion and thoughts jumbled without control in his head- Tony nearly missed the moment his captor retreated from the room calling for someone to 'put him out’, and with little he could do but squirm and swear- he was jabbed in the neck with a needle full of fuck knows what and sent face first hurtling to the ground as his straining arms were released from above his head.
Steve could hear Clint mumble in despair from somewhere to his left. The man was masked and appeared to be holding some kind of baton in one hand, and a worryingly long, sharp knife in the other.
No, no this can't be, this can't be it, it just didn't seem real, it couldn't be happening! He was going to lose him before he even had the chance to
Natasha shook her head and spoke in quiet anger, “It’s a recording, and a damn good one, I just hope they're not going where I think they’re going with this...” Natasha replied but before Steve could even ask what she meant- their attention was drawn back to the screen.
Somehow, one of the flailing legs of the spider collided with the back of his armour which sent him hurtling head first with a sickening smack into the ground below...
it was so clinical, too white, too bare and it smelt of antiseptic, anything remotely resembling hospitals and Tony hated it. Every time in the past that Tony had either woken up in hospital, or got forced to go there he had discharged himself as swiftly as possible, even against the recommendations of the doctors and nurses. Steve just hoped he wouldn't try to leave this time, especially after what he's been through.
“You really love him, don't you...?” and it was said so softly, so out of the blue and so much as if it was a statement rather than a question that all Steve could do was look into her eyes as his filled with painful unshed tears and let out a shuddering breath.
“Well, I can't deny that your Captain is a good fighter,” his captor stated breathlessly, “but he’s obviously not good enough, at least not good enough after we shoot him full with our special tranq darts. So predictable isn't he?! Mr Captain America, how obvious it was that he would come to
Steve called as he nudged his way into Tony’s workshop, arms ladened with bags full of the inventors favourite takeout. “Thank you, Jarvis,” he said as the AI swung the door open for Steve in aid of his obvious struggles to handle both the door and the bags of food simultaneously.
I didn't die Tony, I'm here- I'm right here- I promise, believe me!” Steve begged as he grabbed on to Tony's hand and held on tight. “Tony, I'm so,
Tony though back to that night about a month ago when he'd challenged Steve to that stupid staring contest, he'd been watching Steve that whole night, watched the way he his eyes lit up when he smiled, the way he grabs his chest when he truly laughs and how shy he can become when talking about himself- and my
He drew his eyes back up from where they'd wandered to meet Tony's, and the inventor was just standing there, evil little smirk creeping to his lips,- like he new! But Steve drew in a breath and pulled himself together.
And the second they heard it through the speaker, Steve’s heart gave a lurch in full terror for Tony,- he heard his voice,
Tony came to view in the centre of the screen, the first time they had seen him since he was taken- and Christ.. what had they
The elevator doors slid open and Steve came face to face with the glass panelling separating Tony from the rest of the world.
Blood slowly trickled it’s way down Tony’s back and he winced in discomfort with every movement he made.
Wow, and here I was hoping this story would be at least 10k words :') think I got carried away! Thank you so much for all the kudos and extremely lovely comments I've received- it's way more than I'd expected and I'm ridiculously happy by it!
“Why are you here Steve?” Tony asked with a strange tone lacing his voice, something that Steve couldn’t quite pin point. He was still staring over Steve’s shoulder not quite meeting his eyes.
“Not so cock sure now are you, - well fear not, we’ll be taking good care of you while you're with us,” the owner of the voice said, still out of Tony's field of vision.
It was a long time before Tony began to stir again, Bruce, Nat and Clint had all stayed and sat with Tony, but had left in turn to also tend to their own needs. But Steve still hadn’t budged an inch from where he sat by Tony.
Natasha was sat quietly at the other end of the jet, unsurprisingly watching Steve but showing little of what she thought on her face. Steve didn’t even bother to hide his worry and stress from her this time, she was an expert at reading body language so she could probably read through any of his bullshit at any rate.
And with that thought he suddenly remembered his captor saying that he would have an 'audience', that someone would be watching, and Tony couldn’t be sure, but he just had the gut feeling that it was his friends, his team that would be said audience. And although he couldn’t see them through looking at the camera- couldn’t actually see Steve, but if they were on the other end, if they were watching- he suddenly didn’t feel so alone, didn’t feel so scared.
The others will come for him, he was sure that if he didn't escape before too long- at least the others should get to him soon, he just had to believe.
Steve Felt like he was going to be sick, but he sucked in fast and deep breaths and was vaguely aware of Natasha rubbing soothing circles on his back as he came round from the full on shock.
“Oh believe me, if I had the time I’d gladly use some of my finer skills to give you just a taste of what I’m truly capable of, but lowlife scum like you don’t deserve my time, I'm taking Tony and you’d better pray he doesn’t later seek to finish what I’m going to start right now...”  Steve spoke quickly dodging the gun the captor drew out and knocking it swiftly to the ground and out of reach with one sleek hit from his shield.
He then received a boot to the stomach and in being completely unprepared for the hit his natural reaction to double over in pain only resulted in his arms wrenching against his restraints.
Too often in the last 26 hours had Steve's brain unhelpfully supplied images of Tony fully submerged in that water, drowning and with no hope of escape,- but it hadn’t happened!
“Make sure you smile for the camera Tony, your audience is going to enjoy their next instalment,” his captor said whilst bringing down the whip a final time on Tony’s already abused and bleeding back.
Tony looked pretty worse for wear though, he was no longer standing – but half curled in on himself on the ground, he looked half unconscious but there were definite signs of life. From the angle of the high up camera this freed was coming from Steve could see that Tony visibly shaking and could almost hear his harsh and uneven breathing.
“Keep us updated Fury,” Natasha spoke taking lead when it was obvious Steve wouldn't, couldn't- at that moment, and the whole screen was once again plunged into darkness.
And for the very first time since the transmission came through they heard Tony speak, and it almost shattered Steve’s composure completely.
It was almost 24 hours before Tony began to stir. Steve was still sat by his side- lost in his own thoughts when he heard a quiet groan come from Tony. Steve's eyes immediately shot up to his face where he saw Tony’s eyes rapidly moving left to right underneath his closed eye lids.
- this was just his captor messing with his head, another attempt to break him, to grind him down to fuck with his mind...
Once Tony was at the point where we was sure he would pass out, the beating stopped. He looked up through unshed tears into unfeeling eyes.
“Hey shell-head, tough as nails you are,- knew you'd make it through,” she spoke with a world of affection while gently placing a soft kiss on Tony's temple, “we’re here for you, Tony,- we’ll be right here,” she promised with certainty whilst gently taking his hand into her own, she looked over to Steve and he instantly felt strength from her presence.
Once the bottle was drained and without any warning at all Tony was abruptly released from his restraint- the rope tethering his arms above him slackened and he slammed into the ground with a horrific smack.
If at least one person has enjoyed reading this half as much as I've enjoyed writing it- then I've achieved my goal :)  <3
“Are you sure Tony?” Steve panted between breaths, he knew Tony had recovered vastly since everything that had happened, and he knew Tony was capable of knowing his own mind and limits, but it couldn't hurt just to check and be sure.
Feeling so useless with little to do but wait for any intel to act upon Steve had been pacing the common room for the last half hour, having just got back from S.H.I.E.L.D head quarters he was both restless and agitated at the lack of news and development of the situation. It was extremely strange, Tony had been taken three days ago and there had been no signs of him, no ransom, no threats, no demands for his safe return... No nothing!
Final chapter, this one's a treat for the boys since I've put them through such a tough time- warning for some smut in this one, if that's not your kind of thing then the previous chapter can also serve as a final I guess :)
Unsurprisingly, Tony didn't even seem to remember anything of that night when morning broke the following day, and with Tony eloquently proclaiming a headache that could feel a tree and a mouth as dry as a nun’s vagina he rather quickly left the common room they'd all fallen asleep in and retreated to his workshop. That was the last he’d seen of Tony for the next 7 days.
Steve's breathing slowed and his heaving gasps evening out, and the blood didn't stop following as he suddenly stilled and the rise and fall of his chest almost stopped.
Clint hollered across the room, but Steve was too incapacitated to add to the sudden flurry of sound in the conference room as Bruce let out a groan which sounded more like it came from the Hulk and Natasha let out a long string of what he imagined was some very strong colourful words in Russian.
Then, Steve's world was turned upside down as the captor sunk his knife in a fatal blow to the side of the fake Steve on the screen, and Tony's screams of pure anguish flooded the room like fire.
Two more days passed with no contact from the captors and no advances in S.H.I.E.L.D’s efforts to locate them, and with little else to do, Steve was slowly losing his mind. That was until the end of the second day after that first transmission was sent that his phone buzzed in his pocket- and answering it to the voice of Natasha Steve was once again bracing himself for the worst-
“Hey! As cosy as this all is – this is not how I’d really planned to spend my evening, I was aiming for a little more booze and a lot less dank, no offence, I
“We don't know that he isn't alright, chances are they cut the feed because they also stopped the water, it would make no sense to kill him now, they would have nothing then- nothing to bargain with for what they want,” and even as clearly logical as they sounded, Steve still found it hard to take any comfort from at all,- they didn't even
Tony circle round the spider and took the opportunity to blast it from the front the second he was in range, however the moment the blasts hit- the create spewed a massive tide of the green substance straight towards him. Only his quick reactions saved him from being covered head to toe in God knows what that stuff was, unfortunately, in dodging one problem so quickly it sent him spiralling  into another.
His captor trudged in, sporting many fresh and bleeding wounds and was half steering, half dragging Captain America by the scruff of his uniform.
“What happened Tony?” he asked again grabbing the inventors arm and steadying it flat on his own lap, Tony didn’t seem like he would stop Steve from helping- though he didn’t quite look sober enough to try.
Mercifully, the radiating heart from above was switched off- and within minutes of his captor leaving the room, one of the other men brought in a tray of food, and another beautifully full looking bottle of water. Tony eyed the man place it within arms reach of him before he too retreated from the room- door depressingly locking behind him.
In the passing weeks Steve was pretty sure Tony had actually been drinking less and it was even possible that he hadn’t touched a drop since he had not once seen Tony with a tumbler or bottle in hand.
Kind hands were gently placed on top his shoulders and with great effort he lifted his head to be met with the sorrowful but strong eyes of Natasha.
He entered the conference room at full speed and once again the rest of the team were there, and again the screen displayed Fury on one side, and Tony on the other.
As soon as Tony was given the all clear he was out of the medical ward and making his way back to his tower at lightning speed, and with the help of Steve and the rest of the Avengers, this was managed with as little fuss and difficulty as possible.
For more than a minute not one of the Avengers in the room could speak a word for disbelief of what they'd been made to witness, Steve felt as someone placed a gentle hand on his arm and he jumped slightly not realising how far his mind had slipped into  shock and despair. He looked beside him only to be met with the kind and worried eyes of Natasha.
Steve distantly heard Clint running past him and over to the pilot seat, and could feel Nathan come to stand beside him once she’d boarded. But he couldn't take his eye off Tony, how he lay there- so still... so quiet, it just wasn’t right,- he was so used to seeing Tony- always moving, hands always busy, never stopping for breath with how he would talk and describe new inventions, new projects, upgrades- anything and everything, but now.... He was so still, his eyes fully closed and his head lay loosely against the seating. Steve noticed how pale he looked, he was littered with cuts and bruises and had a constant pained look in his expression- even in unconsciousness.
want to know huh!?” his captor spat, “because you and your Avengers have made my life a living misery, too many of my plans ruined by you so called heroes, - too many times I have
The confusion and pain in Tony's eyes had the rest of the Avengers breathe in with shock. Tony looked dazed, his red rimmed and glazed eyes showed just how much he must have been suffering from the past days. His lips looked dry and painfully chapped as if he hasn't had a drop of water in days, Steve had heard about how Tony had survived the scorching hot desert in Afghanistan, how he was dangerously dehydrated when he was eventually found,- and to be going through this all again, it was barbaric and only increased the sense of urgency in the room for finding him.
Tony had no idea how long he’d been out this time, but he could feel the edges of the waking world pulling him closer, his mind felt fuzzy and he could still feel the effects of the drugs which had been used on him. Suddenly, he remembered a dream he thought he'd had, he’d dreamt he’d seen Steve, that Steve and the rest of his team had found him, had rescued him and taken him home. In the dream he'd opened his eyes- if only to satisfy his imagination and to put an end to the painfully worried rambling he could hear coming from Steve, his head had hurt and his heart couldn’t take the imaginary Steve calling him
After attaching an IV line to Tony's arm Bruce turned and closing his eyes he messaged the bridge of his nose, Steve knew that mannerism - Bruce was definitely stressed and worried.
“OH GOD NAT, OH GOD NO!!!” Steve couldn't hold in the utter panic when Tony’s captor dragged someone into the room, he was dressed in an uncanny replica of his Captain America suit, was practically the same  height and build as Steve and with his whole head covered with a hood, well it was no surprise that with the state Tony was in that he thought it was Steve.
Steve looked down at the now bloodied and beat up face of the man, he was just barely conscious and groaning at his injuries. Steve didn't feel that he'd had enough, but Clint was right, he had to get to Tony. Just before Steve could leave though, the captor began to laugh as he spat a mouth full of blood to his side, “That right, go get your boy,” he said with a nasty smile blooming over his reddened teeth, “go see the little gift I left him just before you came...” and with that, Clint landed the final blow to his head knocking the bastard out.
Words seemed to fail him all at once and Steve could do nothing but stare into Tony's eyes, the urge to lift his hand mere inches above from where it was still placed around Tony's shaking arm to wipe away a stray tear now tracking its way down Tony’s face was almost overwhelming. But all at once Tony appeared to pull himself from his inner turmoil and swiped at his tears in anger.
“Finally, the truth- you just don't trust me do you Steve?! Well fine, whatever -you know what I think I'll just slip away, my head is splitting in two and I need to run some diagnostics on my suit so no time like the present...” Tony rattled off without sparing a second to breathe and before Steve could do much as utter a sound, Tony was gone.
“oh god no....” Steve hadn't even realised that his knees had buckled, hadn't realised that he'd planted himself on the floor, heaving in gasps of air that never seemed to quench his need for oxygen, hadn't realised Natasha was holding him, taking softly to him, didn't realise that he was crying so freely- it all seemed like an out of body experience, something that wasn't really happening, not to him- or to Tony.
In knowing he needed to keep his strength up as much as possible to give both himself and the other Avengers time to get him away from this place he made the decision to go for it, and gently pulling the tray towards himself he cautiously examined the food. It didn't look of smell suspicious so with lack of a better choice, he consumed the food and water with all the gusto of a half starved man.
“Are you sure you'll be alight Tony?” Steve said with concern whilst watching Tony all to quickly pull away from him and on unsteady legs make his way towards the elevator.
Tony watched as his captor pulled out a rather ominous and worryingly full syringe from his jacket pocket. His eyes widened and he couldn't help the groan that escaped his lips as the offending needle was plunged and emptied into his neck.
“That's the only noise I want to hear from you while you're here, no words- just pain,” his captor  whispered sweetly into Tony's ear- far too close for comfort.
He groaned at the upsetting memory, eyes filling with tears which made their escape from under his closed lids, and he yelped in pain as he tried to shift and curl up on his side,- but as he did, he felt hands on him....
He just prayed that Tony made it through the surgery, and then after that?.... They would just have to take it one day at a time.
Then he heard it again... gun fire, yes... straining his ears to the door he could definitely hear the sound of shooting- oh God please let this be it,
Well that just says it all doesn’t it! Had Steve said this to him months ago Tony would probably have had an endless list of things to come back at him with, but as it was, Steve’s apparent and obvious lack of trust- after all this time really did hurt, and Tony found that he just didn't have the heart to fight back after that.
Steve couldn’t move, he couldn’t breathe – couldn’t comprehend what he’d just seen, how was Tony ever to move on from this, how was he going to cope?!
“...... Hold him down, hold him still- he could seriously hurt himself of we don't....” Steve heard one nurse say.
“I love you darling.... so much....” Steve whispered to Tony as he began to comb his fingers gently through the inventors hair and placed a soft kiss on his temple.
Tony wasn’t stupid, he knew he should be extremely cautious of anything these people were giving him, but Jesus Christ he was still so damn thirsty- and having had no food for over three days now the pros of consuming what was in front of him were starting to fully out weigh the cons.
“I love you too,” Tony replied, holding on to Steve as he gently drifted off to sleep, and Steve couldn't think of any other place he’d rather be than right here at this very moment.
There is but a hand full of people who’s opinions he actually gives a damn about, and even fewer who can actually make him feel so hurt by them as Steve just did. He’d always been so guarded in letting anyone truly get close to him, the ones you let into your heart are the only ones who can break it, and Tony has had enough of that for one life time. But somehow, Steve has managed to become one of those people.
Before he could pull himself together, the man in front of him grabbed him roughly by the sides of the head steadying his thrashing.
Bruce checked over at Tony one more time before leaving the room with the nurse, most likely to go over Tony's recovery plan. Clint took first dibs on the shower leaving Natasha to glare at his swiftly retreating back and take the seat opposite Steve and right by Tony.
“You make it sound so easy,” murmurs the super soldier. He may be taller than Pepper, but the woman can certainly make him feel as small as he used to be back in the 40’s just by looking into his eyes.
Steve cannot keep the smile out of his voice when he leans in close to Tony’s ear and murmurs, “I love you, Tony Stark.”
Natasha sets the electric mixer down and looks over her shoulder at Bruce, who is looking at Tony in surprise and dusting his hands off on his apron.
Steve can feel Bucky’s intense stare as he gazes straight ahead with his lips parted in surprise. It takes a moment, but Steve manages to clear his throat and mutter a half-assed excuse to Bucky under his breath as he practically flees from their floor. Ignoring his friend’s bewildered expression, Steve waits for the elevator doors to shut behind him before he orders: “Take me to wherever Tony is.”
“Down, boy,” Tony mocks, and Steve lowers his shield with a sigh. The door shuts behind him with a click and Happy’s head jerks up from where he drifted off on the couch. “So, nurse, how’s the patient?”
Tony doesn’t bother trying to decipher the Russian term and instead lay back against the couch with a loud sigh. He’s so fucked.
“I realise now that I’ve made a mistake, and I regret not doing anything more to help,” says Bruce. He runs a hand through his unkempt hair and sighs. “I stumbled upon Tony popping some of his pills, and I have been trying to help him ever since, but clearly it wasn’t enough. That’s why I’m telling you now. He needs help.”
Tony is shaking his head before Steve even finishes his sentence. “Don’t get Bruce. No Bruce. Get Nat – yeah, Tasha, get her – wait, no, I’m drinking her vodka. Don’t get her.”
“I’ll be there as quick as I can, Pep,” he promises, hurrying from the living room and up the stairs to reach his bedroom. He can hear the muffled voices of the paramedics on the other end of the line as he quickly throws everything into his duffel bag and shoves his keys into the pocket of his jeans. “Don’t worry, okay? We’ll figure this out when I get there. Do you need anything?”
do you mean by that, exactly?” asks Rhodey sharply, strong arms crossed over his chest as he stares at the archer. Being in a wheelchair doesn’t stop Rhodey from being his usual intimidating self, it seems.
the bad guy when I say I don’t trust you anymore. Did you even care to remember that I loved about Aunt Peg too? I was at the goddamn funeral, Steve, but you were too busy making eyes at a pretty blonde to remember that the man you claim to ‘love’ would be there, too.”
Steve looks down at the floor and chews on his bottom lip. Without looking up, because apparently Steve can stare the baddest of the bad in the eyes without flinching but can’t for the life of him make simple eye contact with Tony, the super soldier nods his head. “Okay,” he murmurs lowly. “I’ll try... I promise.”
“That’s because it is, Steve. Try it, and if I’m wrong then you can be the first person to tell me so.”
Bucky is silent for a moment. He stands abruptly, and it’s enough to make Tony flinch and revert back to his previous anxious state.
Bruce stares at him with large, concerned eyes. “Of course you deserve a break, Tony, but not a permanent one. That isn’t the answer and you know it. It’s the alcohol talking, okay? It’s getting to your head. I know you’re tired – I am, too – and I’ve been where you are now and
“I said that it’s fine, Rogers. Leave it alone. I’m not your concern anymore.” Steve’s breath catches in the back of his throat at the reminder, which seems as if it only fuels Tony’s annoyance. “Don’t do that- that look. Whatever you’re hoping for between us isn’t going to happen. We’re not even friends. You’re Captain America, you’re the boss, and that’s all you are to me anymore. It’d be best for everyone if you remembered that.”
Tony uses his own key to open the door to the apartment and spots Steve, still wearing the apron but firmly holding his shield in hand, in a protective stance in front of Pepper. Tony shares an amused look with her over Steve’s broad shoulder.
Eventually, Natasha begins using her legs more to kick and swipe and sometimes even using it to block a punch, which Tony finds incredibly intimidating. At one point, Natasha has him in a headlock and, when elbowing her in the gut doesn’t work, Tony hooks his leg around one of hers and sends them both backwards until Natasha’s back hits the ground. She grunts but otherwise shows no signs of being affected by the movement. Tony rolls to the side and then puts as much force as he can muster into the sharp jab that her ribs receive from his elbow and Natasha’s grip finally slackens enough that Tony is able to break free and flip himself around to pin her to the ground. She attempts to break free from his hold but it proves fruitful, and her head falls back against the mat of the ring in defeat.
Pepper scoffs and returns to the kitchen, which is when Tony notices the steaming apple pie on the counter. “Please, Tony, you know I’d be the doctor. You can be the nurse.”
Tony swallows to try and rid himself of the sudden dryness in his throat and remains silent. Pepper sighs and looks away from Tony.
He receives a few eye rolls and grunts in response, but no objections, so Tony considers it a win as they all file past him to enter the elevator. Natasha is the last to squirm her way into the cramped elevator, and she smirks over her shoulder at the engineer.
"I'm scared, okay?!" yells Tony, slamming the wrench down onto the work bench with a dry sob. He seems just as startled, if not more, than Steve feels at the sudden admission and it stuns them both into a suffocating silence. Finally, Tony turns to look at him with sad eyes and a trembling lower lip, and he whispers, "I'm terrified, Steve.”
“Steven Grant Rogers!” exclaims Tony with an over-exaggerated gasp. “What have I done to you? You have turned into a filthy, filthy old man.”
“I didn’t think it mattered,” Tony responds hoarsely. “It's not something I just go around talking about. My dad was an asshole and my mom, well, she’s no one’s business. It’s just another sob story, and I don’t want anyone’s pity. Plus, I figured Barnes deserves a fresh start and all that other bullshit.”
Barnes blinks rapidly and picks nervously at the fabric of his jeans. He clears his throat while Tony looks around awkwardly, and then they smile uncertainly at each other and nod briefly. Barnes gets up to leave, walks towards the waiting elevator while Tony lounges back with a sigh, eyes closed.
, Tony!” exclaims Bruce, flinging his arms out as he stares at his friend incredulously. “Drinking won’t help you get better, but the right treatment can. Treatment brings hope.”
“Should you be drinking that much with your pills?” asks Bruce, ignoring the unnecessary apology. The engineer sucks in a sharp breath and turns to another workbench to begin tinkering with an indistinguishable jumble of metal and wires in a vain attempt to avoid their inevitable conversation. “Tony, I really think-”
I adore reading everyone's comments and hearing your feedback so, please, keep it coming. I am also open to suggestions if anyone has a scenario they think would go well in this fic or that they would like to see.
At the time Tony didn’t understand why Steve was so bull-headed about it. He presumed that it was Steve being stubborn for the sake of it and thought that with enough pestering his boyfriend may crack. It wasn’t until much later on, nearing the end of their relationship, that Steve finally revealed why he was so against the idea.
FRIDAY takes a moment to respond. “Surveillance shows that he is in the communal floor kitchen with the other Avengers Initiative members, with the exception of Colonel Rhodes as he has a hospital appointment.”
before sobs wrack through his entire body, which is sensitive and bruised and littered with deep cuts and he thinks he may have a broken collarbone but he cannot stop crying and it isn’t until a nurse runs in, followed by an anxious looking Pepper, and injects him with a syringe that he ends up asleep once more.
Editing this chapter was a bitch because I only decided today that I didn't like the original and wanted to change it all, which resulted in me busting my ass off trying to complete it in temperatures too hot for Ireland. Seriously, I am not made to handle the heat.
“Tony,” murmurs the Captain quietly, taking advantage of Tony’s shocked silence while he can. “I know you don’t want me to intervene but
“FRIDAY,” he says around a weary sigh. “Scan me. I want to keep regular check on the Extremis in my body. If it had a bad reaction to the reactor before, chances are that it will act up again. I can’t afford to let that happen, not while Spymaster is around. Speaking of our local pain in the ass, where are we at on exposing his identity?”
And then, when I finally scream myself awake, the first thing I see is you, too. You’re everywhere I turn; watching me with sad eyes and acting like
long time. Someone seems to hear his prayers and, as Natasha is a step away from the elevator’s threshold, the doors close.
, there's a new chapter, only to click onto that lovely ’Next Chapter‘ button and find that it's just me throwing pitiful excuses at you.
Rhodey sighs and shakes his head. “Luckily, Pepper wasn’t hurt, she’s just shaken up. Happy... isn’t doing as good, but the doctors are hopeful,” he assures them all and ignores Tony’s scoff. Natasha catches his eye and subtly raises an eyebrow, to which he shrugs and attempts to convey
