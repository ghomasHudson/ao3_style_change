Yours,
John took a deep breath. " I can't just sit by and do nothing when you're suffering so much." He slowly reached his hand and put it slightly on Sherlock's shoulder.
Sherlock flinched, frightened as he got awakened from his Mind Palace. " Where?"
⚠️IMPORTANT⚠️
The ex-soldier shrugged his shoulders. " Sure... But if you have some work, I don't want to bother you..." His words fade away slightly.
He made a few steps closer, successfully ignoring the nasty smell of vomit.
There was an apology on the tip of Sherlock's tongue, but he knew the doctor had no use for it, so he just nodded and watched him enter the house through the back door.
. It had been two years, and it felt like it'd been yesterday; it was a wound that had never closed and sometimes he thought it never would. Trust Mycroft to waltz in and twist the knife that bit more, as if John needed a reminder.
"Today we celebrate!" he said joyfully, and then he gave Sherlock's mutilated feet a couple of pats that would have looked much like camaraderie in any other situation. It just made the detective hiss and pull his feet towards himself.
"Well, we're not married yet." The man countered, hiding his smile behind the water glass as he took a sip.
She had calmed down a bit after her call, and by this time she had already lowered her gun.
Sherlock was no longer allowed to waive food while he was on a case; he didn't even bother trying anymore.
When they parted, they both had little private smiles on their faces and John shyly moved his hand so that it brushed against Sherlock's free one, their fingers interlacing ever so slightly. He brushed his thumb against the other's own and then let his head drop onto the other man's shoulder. Sherlock welcomed the proximity and rested his head on top of John's, nuzzling ever so slightly as he committed his scent to memory once again; John had always smelt like home.
"So, you and Johh, huh?"
John squeezed his hand softly.
to. I understand you want to help, but… Sherlock, even I don't want to see it. This… it could be very… " he trailed off.
Sherlock lifted his head and looked at him "Can I touch you?"
Sure, she had been lurking in the background with all the other we-all-chipped-in gift-givers, but there was still no love lost between her and Sherlock. There was a lot between her and John, none of which was remotely pleasant.
. Now that they'd turned the body around they could see it was a man.
"Wow" came the low exclamation when John saw the first body, it was a subdued type of approval, but it was approval nonetheless.
He ignored the part of him that did attach meaning to it, the part of him that felt violated, that felt humiliated, that felt as though this type of violence might be even worse than the purely physical one. To be tortured and beaten when captured was expected, it was a tale of bravery he could boast about later if he wanted to- but this? This was something he would never speak of again, these weren't the proud wounds of a warrior; this was shame.
The explanation that followed was as ridiculous and absurd as any of Sherlock's deductions, and he believed every word of it. Part of him was still guarded, was still fighting, was still shouting that he'd checked his pulse, that he needed to see Sherlock with his own eyes-
"I'm okay." he assured "It's just a Pavlovian response."
John nodded and his breathing seemed to grow very loud to his own ears. He watched almost transfixed as Sherlock got off him and sat on the floor by the couch, his feet tucked beneath him.
The doctor bit back the
"I'm glad you didn't, I've only got one of him"
The doctor smiled at his grumpy morning mood and continued making them a proper English breakfast. Ah, homemade food! How he had missed it.
"I love you" John murmured into his shoulder, and it was the softest of confessions, even as it was not news to either of them.
The man was not patient. He pulled the blanket off him and grabbed him by the hair "Turn!" he ordered again, very clearly, his face an inch away from Sherlock's.
"Sherlock, do you want me to make you some tea? Get you some water?" John asked when his flatmate woke up for what seemed like the hundredth time.
"Why do you harbor this delusional notion that I have any control over Sherlock Holmes?" the man demanded, and his voice was still level, but very, very serious. "I didn't have control over him when he became a drug addict at eighteen and I don't have control over him now. He was going to track down Moriarty's network with or without my help, and I could either join him or wait at home for the body bag. So I did. What. I. Could." He enunciated each word, and every inch he had on John was now clearly delineated as he towered over the shorter man.
And then Sherlock was off, walking down the main corridor while murmuring under his breath, just to walk back up again. And then he disappeared off towards the kitchen, not offering a word of explanation.
"Shut up, John, you're rambling." Sherlock snapped, but there was no bite to it. He closed his eyes as well, just for a moment, before letting out a breath and looking down at his hands. "I had. Since the pool – I knew then." He explained "What I felt. I knew then that it wasn't just- that it was more than just friendship, for me."
"A snuff film company. They're selling videos of these girls, everything from the rape to the murders – it's all recorded."
And then the pounding on the door resumed and the detective yelled out in frustration, before jumping off the bed, pulling his pajamas and dressing gown on before slamming the door to their bedroom open. "Someone had better be dying!" he shouted towards the living room, to John's amusement.
Sherlock was the one to take it in his gloved hand. And despite his usual knack for figuring out gifts, he couldn't venture a guess as to what he was holding.
They were walking in quick strides, making their way across the floor and out the door of the Yard, hoping they would still catch the two men. And just as they left the station they spotted John and Sherlock on the other side of the street, waiting for a cab.
At once, John got up from his seat, journal forgotten, and put his hand carefully behind his friend's back, trying to prop him up.
"I don't care. I'll do it." John said quickly, because he'd sooner turn into a beggar on the streets than turn his back on Sherlock Holmes and if that wasn't the most absolute of truths, his name was not John Watson.
But Sherlock was like a dog with a bone and they all knew it; he wasn't going to stop until he found what he was looking for.
"I just- you know. You know I'm not good at this." He was looking anywhere but at Sherlock's face because he was a bloody coward. "I was miserable and I- my therapist tried to tell me- tried to get me to say it. I- the things I would have said to you and I- I couldn't, I-" He spared the detective a quick glance and surely enough, the man's piercing blue eyes were still staring straight at him. "What I'm trying to say is- before, I wanted to- I should have said it, I just-"
"Well, I must be on my way; I believe we're done here?" he asked, and he wasn't trying to be unkind.
Sherlock frowned. "What?"
"You think this is funny, don't you?" He asked, and he was riling himself up pretty quick, so he just turned around and went towards his own chair, but didn't sit down. "Should have saved yourself the trip" he said, and it was a dismissal if ever Sherlock had heard one.
He texted the elder Holmes, not caring if he was being obvious to Sherlock aside from the precautions he was already taking by hiding in the loo.
The man almost went for the next finger, but then Sherlock was shifting and positioning himself like they would have done; his nostrils flaring in anger, his eyes shut in denial. His arse hurt a lot, it never stopped hurting these days, and when the man entered him expertly he couldn't help the groan that escaped him.
Oh for god's sake! Sherlock gripped his phone, exasperated and responded.
John was thrown at the non-sequitur, but just nodded, frowning slightly. He did as asked, and then the detective cautiously walked towards the bed and took a seat with a good amount of effort.
When he came out, he was sure to linger for at least another handful of minutes before running a hand through his hair like he was just realizing something.
John smiled indulgently and bumped their shoulders together. "Ok, you bloody genius. Go prove everybody wrong."
"Anyway, he's some retired office worker. Nine to five, no wife or kids, record's clean as can be – not even a parking ticket." Lestrade shrugged. "He doesn't live here, either. Owns the property, but he rents a place in London."
Four men held a screaming, naked girl down as a fifth man walked into view of the camera and knelt by her legs.
"John-" and that was all the warning he got, because then Sherlock was convulsing against him, coming all over his naked skin and the mattress. He had only lasted a couple of minutes, which was more than John could say for his own first time over twenty years ago.
"Alright, I won't punch Donovan in the face."
He kissed his lover lovingly, but also opened his mouth against him, knowing by now that hungry kisses turned the other man on. And then he started working on his cock expertly, his fist moving up and down with a constant rhythm. He hadn't touched another man since his army days, but he could still apply what he knew he liked on himself.
"You don't know that, because I don't know that, because
Like the first time Sherlock had ever touched him, the detective took his time. He looked at first, then brought his fingers up to stroke him a couple of times before finally leaning down and licking experimentally at the head.
It grew into something he knew he wasn't going to be able to control, he could feel it coming and he had to run. He couldn't do this to Sherlock, he couldn't shift the attention onto him when it was his friend who was hurting, who had been-
"If you're about done, we have a wedding to attend."
Immediately, he dialed his lover, all urgency returning to him. "John?" he called out as soon as the call connected. "I found her."
Sometimes he could spend hours looking at the photos until he worked himself into sleep again. But tonight, there was stirring coming from the couch on his left and his hands froze on the pictures when he saw John sitting up and rubbing sleep out of his eyes.
"The last body, Elizabeth Carr, was definitely here. There are traces of her blood in the grass."
"You can, always, anything. But only if you want to."
Mycroft made a show of walking around the room before he sat in one of the wooden chairs, his umbrella resting against the table.
"Listen, Sherlock, ahm. We just, ah, you know that we were monitoring the live streams?" he started, and the younger man stiffened immediately.
The detective looked suspiciously between his brother and John – who was still eating like he had nothing to do with this.
The doctor kissed his damp curls and slowly removed his fingers from inside him, not bothering to clean them as he applied more lube onto them and wrapped a hand around himself. He didn't need to stroke his cock any further or get himself any harder, but he wanted to make sure he'd be slick enough to enter his lover smoothly.
When Sherlock woke up, John would kiss him good morning, they'd smile and laugh and tease each other as they used to. But then, Sherlock would also move on his bed and give John quiet looks of invitation. They spent one full afternoon side by side in the small hospital bed, Sherlock doing his puzzles while John read a book. They ended up taking a nap, John's head on his shoulder and the detective's arm wrapped loosely around him.
The video was blessedly paused in the commotion, ceasing the screams, at least.
"Why do you want to be alone with her, Freak?" Donovan demanded, her face twisting in disgust as she crossed her arms over her chest. "Finally showing your true colors, are you?"
There was silence as Sherlock seemed to contemplate what he'd said, or as he thought about something else altogether. Finally, the detective laced his fingers together over his lap and looked at him.
Their old kitchen table had literally fallen to pieces after one of Sherlock's experiments exploded. John spent days brooding over the table, while Sherlock had spent days brooding over his lost chemistry set.
One of the men from the video was lying motionless on the ground, blood flowing from a wound Sherlock couldn't see. And the girl- the girl was naked, cuffed at her feet and aiming a gun at him.
He asked himself how gay men could possibly enjoy something so painful. But then, he reckoned the average gay man was not getting fucked up to seven times a day by different people.
After a while, the head of curls move and Sherlock looks up at him "If we go home, I'll just be awake there instead of here. There's no point."
The hospital – private facility? – was an enormous estate just outside London. It sat surrounded by carefully manicured gardens, beyond which lay vast stretches of green fields as far as the eye could see. John felt as though he had been transported to the early 1800s; surely the building was that old, if not older.
In the night, John slept on his couch and there were lingering glances across the room and a lot of tossing and turning, but neither of them brought it up.
The floor disappeared from under John's feet.
John crossed his arms over his chest.
"Yes, love?"
His doctor didn't enthusiastically agree like he had been expecting. In fact, he was oddly quiet.
Sherlock's misplaced anger deflated a bit, but his resigned frustration was still there.
Ostentatiously, Sherlock turned his head to the left and stared at the wet pavement from the window, obstinately avoiding Mycroft's gaze. " Are you mocking me or you're just trying to say something?" He snapped and wrapped his arms around himself to keep at least the rest of his dignity.
Although their lips separated, they rested in the close position, snuggling to each other. Their limbs were tangled, you would have a problem to recognise where does the body of the first began and where it ended.
"Stop telling me that you're fine! Because I'm not swallowing it!" John ruffled his hair in frustration, slowly rising his voice. " How could you be fine? You've been captured! They tortured you, for God's sake! "
John slowly opened his eyes, confused, he really didn't expect he would be woken up at two o'clock in the morning. " Wha- what?" he mumbled, sleepy.
Sherlock chuckled unhappily, this was it... Why would John ever care about him? Why would he waste his time with annoying, insufferable and rude git who did nothing but showed off with his intelligence? With a man who could be easily replaced - like so many times before...
" Fine... I'm sorry, Sherlock, but I'm calling Mycroft... You have to be examined, and since you won't let me, you will be checked by a professional..."
" You know, for a genius, you're extraordinarily stupid... Sherlock, I've never said those praises just because you solved crimes... You and your deductions are still brilliant, you just need a break, physical and mental... I almost lost you two times and I'm not letting you ruin yourself again because of some stupid case!"
He wasn't as quick to understand as Sherlock was. "What?" He asked and took out his keys.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes when he realised that his brother was lying. " Yo-you're ly-lying... I-I-I h-h-have t-to see hi-him..."
The blonde didn't wait for anything, grabbed Sherlock's shoulders and smashed his scarred back against the wall several times.
He was shut down with a pair of soft lips which pressed towards his. Sherlock made the first step, but he was distant and prepared to pull away. But John wrapped his left arm around his waist and the second one ruffled Sherlock's messy black hair. Sherlock felt a little better, his heart was overflowing with joy that John feels the same way as he.
But today he didn't share his joy, he sat in his armchair, his back hunched, turned on the detective. He was sunk in the comfortable chair, but he felt everything but comfort.
Without his friend John felt like nothing, things returned to its old way, maybe even worse than before.
A few minutes later he was back, with a glass of water, flask of ibuprofen and wet towel. He found his friend sitting on the bed in the same position he left him in, trembling from head to toes. His face was flushed and sweaty and the untidy nest of black curls stuck out of his head in all possible directions.
Sherlock began to add more pressure, not much but enough to decrease the bloating.
He has almost released another groan when something warm and wet caressed his mouth, and encircled the whole edge of his cupid-shaped lips, leaving the damp trace which threatened them, causing them to swell a bit as the blood rushed inside them.
" Sherlock?!"
How surprised they were when they spotted him, sitting on the pavement in the cold weather of January for God knows how long, in dirty, ripped clothes, with a thick rope around his soft arms and flabby ballooning tummy!
They just sat there, beside each other, absolutely unaware of the time passing by them...
" I... I don't know if I want you to see me like that... So weak and vulnerable, what would you think? You're a soldier, it's nothing compared to you. It's... It's nothing, really..." Sherlock stuttered nervously as he crumpled the hem of his white shirt, which was always quite tight on him, like a second skin. It was so baggy on him right now, he had to drop off his weight.
The rhythm of the detective's runaway heart started to return into its natural rate as he finally began to calm down and finally got his runaway breath in the control.
Oh...
" John, I -" The detective didn't know what to say, he wanted to help...
Sherlock pulled out. " Do-don't y-you mind?" He asked carefully.
" Sorry..." Brothers apologized in unison.
All he could register was a painful throbbing in his lower belly and hot tears welling in his eyes and rolling down his round cheeks.
A wrinkle of worry appeared between Sherlock's eyebrows, it was two in the afternoon, John should be back by now!
But who would want to hurt him? John Watson was the kindest, bravest and most loyal man he has ever met, he tried to get on with everybody.
John chuckled. God, that man could be a blighter. Sometimes he wondered how he managed to maintain his patience without punching his friend in his nose.
"Pollen, John..." Sherlock said with his deep baritone, as it was the most obvious thing in the world. John hated that tone, he always felt so stupid...
Greg gave him a sad smile, it wasn't difficult to tell what was the detective thinking about. " It's okay, Sherlock... Everyone needs a good hug sometimes... Even High-Functioning Sociopaths..." He said, took out a pack of paper tissues from the pocket of his jacket and handed it to his sniffing friend.
Sherlock hesitated for the while before nodding. With his trembling thin fingers he began to unbutton his shirt, his breathing went faster with nervous." It won't be easy on the eyes." he warned him as the white fabric slipped down from his shoulders and he turned around.
To: JOHN
John stroked Sherlock's tightened chin to help him relax a bit. " And now, speaking about your little problem, don't worry about it."
The woman sneered and put her hand in her handbag. " You'll change your mind as soon as you see what you're risking, trust me..." She took out her phone and shoved it under Sherlock's nose.
As he continued caress John, he noticed that his tanned skin was tightened and his belly felt bit bloated, it had to be from that stupid experiment. The wave of self-anger swelled inside him again.
" I wanted to play the hide and seek. We didn't know it there and I got lost. Mycroft ran home and told our parents what happened. They were looking for me the whole night. I was terrified - that night came a huge storm and gale, the trees were falling down around me, I was so scared!
The detective closed his eyes, his long lashes brushed against his high cheekbones. " It doesn't look nice..." He warned him and with a heavy heart, he exhaled and unbend his muscles, letting his tummy puff out. He winced when his skin jiggled, feeling a pure repulsion towards himself.
His fingers curled around the soft woollen material and Sherlock almost sighed in relief. But as soon as he perceived that this "stolen", baggy sweater was the only thing he had after his first and only best friend, his throat tightened.
" You look quite good... " Sherlock stated.
She burst into cruel laughter. " You know very well that you can't beat me, that's beyond you! So give it back! "
It had no effect though, if anything, it made the detective's nightmare even worse.
He could see every pore on Sherlock's face, he could count every dark long lash which rested on his high cheekbones, he could observe every wrinkle on his pink lips...
And then there was a loud crack of thunder, still really close. It surprised John a bit, he has completely forgotten about the weather outside. Sherlock's reaction, on the other hand, was scary. He almost jumped out of his skin and yelped as he pressed his palms on his ears - he almost slapped John in the face in doing so. He squeezed his eyes shut, and whimpered, trembling all over his body.
Sherlock felt his face curl with shock when he realised what was John saying. " Y-you me-mean t-to ki-ki... kill yo-yourself?"
Sherlock eyed him with an almost child-like curiosity, silent. He looked at him for a good minute without saying anything, and John almost had to get up and leave because of how uncomfortable the whole situation was making him.
Two fingers in, more lube, three fingers in, and Sherlock even found himself rocking onto the intrusion. That John would often remove his fingers to let them play with his rim and stroke his cock helped greatly.
It wasn't always terrific though. Sometimes the weather was too chilly for John to want to risk going outside. Sometimes Sherlock would sleep the whole day away. Sometimes it was just- hard.
After a while, she sat down, gun still in hand, but almost forgotten. She pulled her knees up to her chest and rested her head on them.
And so, like he had fantasized a million times before, John moved up on the bed and put his leg over Sherlock's side to sit on his lap. They were both breathing erratically, eyes fixed on each other, pupils dilated and mouths open.
A beat.
He sighed tiredly and rubbed his eyes before looking back at the mangled body of the young woman on the floor.
Sometimes he'd look at John and he'd frown like he was trying to deduce him and he'd ask softly, "John?" again and again, as often as he asked about being home.
The nurses also tried to get him to eat something, as it would do wonders for his recovery if he could get some of his weight back. But when they first tried offering him food, he shook his head very emphatically and wouldn't hear of it.
Sherlock
Hands now clawed at the welts on his back as a strangled noise of release echoed in the room. He felt a hot, sticky substance being shot inside of him and he started going through all the possible STDs he could have just been infected with when he remembered that it didn't matter- corpses needn't worry about diseases.
It didn't seem credible to him, he knew the man well - Sherlock dealt with stress with much more creative methods - shooting the wall or playing wild compositions on his beloved violin were ones of his favourite...
I screamed, but no one heard me..." Sherlock covered his face in his hands and his body shifted during those memories.
The loud thud and devastated sob echoed through the room.
Staggering a bit when his unstable legs struggled to carry him, he headed to his room first, hoping to find some clothes that would fit him at least a bit... He knew that there was very little of clothing he possessed that he could squeeze into, but he was tired of waiting for his brother to send him something, he couldn't stand the restrictive feeling anymore!
His hands gripped the blue silk fabric of his dark blue dressing gown and he clenched it in his fists so tightly his knuckles went white.
Beep.
The detective opened the cupboard with stored toilet paper, tubes of toothpaste and wet wipes.
They just laid there, the tall detective kept rubbing the soldier's stomach until it was in its normal state. When he glided his fingers cross John's torso now, the skin was becoming pliable under his touch. Sherlock didn't mind, vica versa in fact. The small pudge on doctor's middle felt strangely comforting and warming.
" Sherlock?!"
" Stay... Please..." Sherlock mumbled, words slurred together with the exhaustion, but the doctor understood what his friend was saying.
"NOOO!" Came the scream from the sofa.
" So... Tell me again what are we doing here?" Asked Sherlock as he was sitting on the big boulder, even though he was absolutely aware of where they were and with WHO...
So not the date then - the detective almost sighed in relief. But what was wrong with his friend? " You must be just a bit tired... I'll buy you some coffee, okay?" He suggested, hoping John will join him.
But that scream was entirely different, somewhat desperate. John tossed his legs out of his bed and jerked on the bedside table to find his cell phone. Two o'clock in the morning! He moaned quietly, put on his favourite beige sweater and warm socks and went downstairs, where the cries came from.
Watching the black pop sparkle in the glass made him remember his childhood.
" Please, I'm dying from boredom! I need action, adrenaline pulsing in my veins! I can't just sit here, my brain rots from doing nothing!"
John blinked, confused. He didn't understand not even one word. " Excuse me?"
His breath was erratic and unsteady from the distress he went through in the nightmare and tears rolled down his cheeks.
Today 10:28 PM
Sherlock fixed his heterochromic eyes into John's. Tears flowed down his fallen cheeks. John held his breath, he had never seen Sherlock cry in his life, and he was terrified, in fact. Immediately he wished to take his words back, he felt so bad. "Sherlock, I'm so sorry... I didn't mean to scream, I'm just so worried. "
Bowing his head down, he took a sad look at the overhanging belly he had developed under the strict uncompromising supervision of his tormentor.
The famous duo was sitting in the small blue A-shaped tent for two, preparing themselves for sleeping. The thick darkness outside seemed like it could swallow their shelter, the night was so different from nights in the London, quiet, peaceful, dark...
John sighed and let his thoughts run freely in his head. After a few moments of associations, they stopped at the topic they always did. At Sherlock, of course...
The clock showed something around four in the afternoon, and John was still in the clinic which meant that he still had time to do a few repeats of crunches. Not that it would help but at least he didn't feel bad for doing nothing.
" I think you'll want to... It seems that John might be in danger!" Greg Lestrade said, getting down to the business, there was no need to beat about the bush.
John left the loos and put on his smile as he headed towards the table couple was sitting at. But his grin faded away from his lips when he found out that there was no one. The chair was tucked to the table, unfinished cup of coffee stood at Susan's empty place, the spoon beside the saucer.
Beep.
The doctor did his best to get control over his face and opened his mouth to say something, but before he had time to utter a word, the detective continued.
To a certain extent, it was because of his vanity and pride, but he knew it could be a good weapon against him. And he knew plenty of of people who would enjoy to see him in pain... But Greg wasn't like that, was he?
Slapping her hand away, he glared daggers at her, fed up with her self-confident tone. He had to tell him! John had to know that he's in danger, for God's sake! He couldn't risk his wellbeing, he would never forgive himself if something had happened to his best friend.
" You only have goosebumps and you're shivering... No, you absolutely aren't cold..." John sneered. He had to admit that detective looked quite comical and... adorable? It was too short for him, sleeves ended somewhere in the middle of his forearms. Jumper was baggy on him, he seemed so tiny.
He took a concerned look at his friend and he wasn't happy with what he saw. Sherlock's face was white as a sheet and deep purple bags sat under his tired eyes like a large bruises. It was evident that the detective hadn't slept well lately...
" Great... Now, since we cleared this up, can you set the table? The dinner will be in twenty minutes..." Then John took a look at detective's head and disapprovingly clicked his tongue. " And then we have to do something about your hair, you look like an unkempt poodle..." He chuckled and he could swear that he saw detective's lips twitch a bit, but the gesture didn't reach his eyes.
She had to wait for him to go back to sleep to continue, because he wouldn't let her near him. Fortunately, it did not take very long and she was finished a half hour later, leaving to allow Dr. Watson back in.
"What's this about?" he asked Lestrade once the man came out of his office to greet the two of them.
And then they were giggling and kissing each other again. It was nice, this was. They were used to it by now; they had made out maybe hundreds of times in the past few months. And while John had been careful about letting Sherlock be the one to initiate it at first, he knew he was allowed – welcomed – any time now.
Sherlock, still with his eyes closed, just nodded very softly and then he was back asleep.
"The mission was a success, the information found on the base was the last piece of our puzzle and we're officially closing the file on Moriarty." He tapped at the table, having sat down again. "Your name has also been cleared back in London, and you will be welcomed back into your previous position should you wish to do so."
"So how was it?"
He tapped his foot against the wooden boards of the floor. And then he did it again. And one more time.
Lestrade was still out of breath from his jog up the stairs, but he smiled "Alright, good."
He tried to hide his teary, enormous grin with a kiss, but John very pointedly stopped him.
John huffed. "Unbelievable."
They were both lying on their sides, facing each other, and John could see every minute expression the other man made. So it was a sight of the gods when his fingers finally trailed past Sherlock's waistband to trace the outline of his now completely hard cock. The detective honestly shuddered.
I hope you liked this little story!
Sherlock spared him another glance before returning to his work; the gloves finally coming off since they were alone in the room.
When he was done, he had the taste of his lover down his throat and a positively Cheshire cat grin on his face.
The months went by, and when September turned to October and Fall started chilling the air, Sherlock felt he was ready to take on a case. A real case.
He thought for a moment and then shook his head, but he was smiling- he was trying to be funny, see?
He heard the long, drawn out frustrated sigh coming from the policeman before the man finally acquiesced. "Fine. Now please come?"
The DI started almost comically, stopping in his tracks as to not run the doctor over. "John!" he said as he exhaled.
"Baker Street. We're at the flat" John supplied immediately, nudging Sherlock to look the other way so he could see the familiar numbers on the dark door.
Sherlock's head snapped up, but he schooled his expression into one of disinterest and looked down at his laptop as though resuming his scanning. "Lestrade" he said truthfully "Some boring case even a third grader could figure out." Ok, so maybe not entirely truthfully.
Mycroft pursed his lips for a moment and nodded "What you are doing now- that you're here with him, that is enough."
Then he left his plate where it was and came over to kneel in front of Sherlock. "Sherlock, when you died- it- it just destroyed me. But the thought of you being in pain and not being able to stop it is so much worse. So there it is. There's your invincibility, again." He placed a hand on top of the one the detective was using to hold the box. "I didn't want to reassure you with empty words, because you're right- in our line of work, who knows what's going to happen? I don't think it'll be Moriarty's men or anything like that, but you're right that it could be something else, someone else. And now, no matter what happens, you'll always have a way out."
He had his team ready to go in five, and Sherlock was leading them in like he couldn't sit still for a second.
John could tell when he started slipping into something darker, restless, and so – Mycroft be damned – he softly grasped Sherlock's right hand in both of his, gently cradling it and calling Sherlock's attention back to the real world.
He went to their room, changed into proper trousers and a jumper before going to Sherlock and brushing their hands together softly. It was strange how they'd developed this Thing with their hands – It was a Thing now. John guessed it had a lot to do with how Sherlock's hands were a vivid reminder of what the man had survived and of the weeks John had sat by his side holding them.
"I figured as much" Mycroft said, seemingly a response to his unspoken words. And then a tablet was being thrust into John's hands. "It's a live feed."
"The hair" he gestured vaguely towards her, his bare hands in plain sight. "It's different."
"You do it". He knew it was absurd, but undressing someone felt like a violent act in his head. He wanted to see John do it himself.
To be honest, he was ridiculously thankful for the chance to go outside and actually
"Say that again!" he ordered.
As far as John was concerned, things couldn't get better.
He wasn't even one of the bigger ones, nor was he one of the brutal ones. Still, the tears inside Sherlock were made fresh, and when the second man came in a few hours later, the detective was beyond himself with fear.
John's huff was affectionate and he got up, folding his paper and placing it on the coffee table. "Alright, fine. I was going today anyway, might as well do it now." He said, in defeat.
She grinned and let him go, biting her lip softly as he went.
There were another three officers in the room aside from himself and Donavan. It was enough people that the small place felt crowded, especially when they were all standing around the computer screen. Sherlock was the one invited to seat in front of it, however.
Originally, Greg had the full intention of chasing after them, but what he saw made both he and Sally stop in their tracks.
The detective felt himself grow a tiny bit harder.
All of the men were shot on sight, non-fatal as per orders. It took them all of thirty seconds to subdue the entire base, currently manned by eight people. It was only Mycroft and two other agents, but they were efficient, better armed and had the element of surprise. They had been planning this for months.
"I can't stop thinking about it." He said, finally.
Mrs. Hudson's grand entry was not as subdued. The woman shrieked, passed out, yelled at both of them and then passive aggressively offered to make them dinner that night.
John, who had moved to the floor and accidentally fallen asleep, jolted upright. When he looked up to see Sherlock standing, the last of his sleepiness drained out of him.
And then he stared at the finished product, blinked twice, and then proceeded to push John onto their bed and undo the entire work by opening his trousers and devouring him down like a man starving.
The flowers were gorgeous, the food was delicious, and the cousins too many to name. John's sister was sober and present, and Mike Stamford – their bloody cupid – could make it. Even Amanda had showed up, as promised, and she seemed to strike it up really well with Molly.
Sherlock was still frowning at him like he couldn't believe John was a real person, because he couldn't be so lucky. No one could be this lucky.
"John, I… I don't know what to say"
"It's a neurotoxin pill." Mycroft supplied without prompting. "Nanotechnology developed for MI6; the prototype was put to test six months ago, this is the finished version. It detaches through voice command and kills in two minutes, fifteen seconds. Painlessly." He added that last part as added measure "I suggest humming and Morse code; just in case you find yourself without a tongue."
Try as he might – and granted, he wasn't trying very hard – Sherlock could not stop himself from imagining John locked in the bathroom, his hand fisted around his cock and two fingers deep within himself as he came, Sherlock's name on his lips.
As far as first sexual encounters went, Sherlock was certain things could have gone much worse. Even if John couldn't see it as such, the detective actually felt better after the whole thing.
Sherlock could practically see it when he made the connection, from the telltale intake of breath he tried to hide, to the minute widening of his eyes, to slight tremor in his hands. He looked away before John could look up at him.
A hint of a smile tugged at Sherlock's lips and he felt his heart skip a beat- he hadn't really expected this. Well, he hadn't really known what to expect, but.
"John, what the hell are you-"
"Sherlock- maybe this was just a detour. Maybe they killed her outside somewhere?" he offered a bit tiredly. Honestly he was getting dizzy just watching the taller man move.
John took off his sweater – he wasn't sure whether it had been soiled too. Wearing only his shirt and boxers, he joined his partner on the bed.
The man nearest the door seemed to understand and he started gesturing and giving orders to the others. Sherlock had no idea what he said, but one of them left the room, only to come back with a chair.
He stopped counting after a few rounds. He was sure he was bleeding, and it was confirmed when he tasted one of the men after he'd been in his arse; it made him gag and throw up a second time. The proceedings went late into the night, with everyone taking a turn or two. He was exhausted.
Now that he was waking up to show signs of awareness, he could be spoken to and somewhat reasoned with.
"Sherlock?! Oh my bloody- Is it true?!" the officer barged in and he was clearly shaken, even as he was grinning like mad. "You bastard!" he laughed, unbelieving. He almost threw himself at the other detective, but something about Sherlock's thinner frame and shorter hair kept him from doing it.
"He didn't actually jump-" this time it was Sally who spoke up, rolling her eyes again.
. And it was right. He'd found the room, he'd done his job; the police could take it over from here. But even as he decided to leave the crime scene that looked so much like his own, his mind was already running a hundred deductions per minute.
"Fine. Yes. I was talking to Mycroft, you're a genius of deduction, thank you very much" He mocked lightly, but he just sounded tired.
He sat up with John's help as it was still very uncomfortable for him to do so, and the doctor also re-arranged the pillows on the bed after he'd set it almost upright.
The detective still felt himself pulsing inside his trousers, but he couldn't bring himself to cross that line. If anything, he was afraid he'd react negatively and spoil this moment for the both of them. No, let them bask in this successful encounter; he didn't want John to end up feeling guilty again.
It came back soiled with the men's semen and a hint of blood, but he wasn't sure whether the blood belonged to the healing marks on his back or not. He cleaned his hair and his face, and then put the dirty trousers back on. He had nothing else to wear and despised the idea of being naked at the moment.
"Alright, let me just put my coat back on, then." John said – he had his back turned to him still.
Heterochromic eyes sparkled despite the darkness of the tent. " Really?" John's heart jumped when he heard a hint of hope. " But... I thought you weren't gay?"
'Sherlock!' John though and jumped from his armchair as if he had just sat on the wasp. Finally!
His frowning face sparkled with sweat which made his black curls stick to his forehead like a glue and his eyes were squeezed shut so tightly it created wrinkles around his eyes and nose. The sleeping detective pressed his lips together in such a tight line they seemed almost white, the corners of his lips twitched up and down in discomfort.
The movement caught his attention so he turned his head towards the exit and spotted Susan's short figure at the door, preparing to leave.
Beep.
Sherlock folded his arms on his chest. " Anything else you want to get off your chest?"
Mrs Hudson's weeping grew louder, which made the doctor run down the stairs, nearly tumbling from the staircase.
Despite everything being said above, he couldn't force himself to tear off his eyes from him.
Soldier's body tensed at this word, he knew what harm the PTSD could do. " What happened? "
" Me? What are you talking about? I'm such a hothead and you know that. I'm sorry that I'm grumpy and I kick off at you sometimes... But don't be afraid, you're not going to lose me. Even the most stupid thing that will ever leave your insulting mouth will never make me to leave. You won't be able to get rid of me so easily... " John grinned as he threw up his arms around Sherlock's slender torso and tilted his head on a side.
The detective fixed his eyes at him, thinking about what he told him. Mary had to be that woman he wanted to propose. What could she find out?
But John didn't want to let Sherlock get his way, not today. Fortunately, he has lived with Sherlock Holmes long enough to be familiar with Sherlock's convincing techniques, he already knew what to expect from him.
John's hands wandered across Sherlock's abdomen, giving some places a light press, some spots just a caress. He told him to take deep breaths, asked if he doesn't feel any sting in the area of the ribcage and just to be sure he palpated his ribs that hid under the thick layer of the fat.
His breathing quivered and hitched in his chest, making his hefty tummy jump against Greg's stomach like a water balloon, and weepy sniffs echoed through the living room into the whole flat.
"Sleeping pills, they're boring... And I'm going to be tired all day tomorrow... They will make me slow, I won't be able to observe, just like all of you... " Sherlock muttered with frustration. 'Sleeping pills. He would never ever put something like this into his mouth...'
It seems that our boys are finally understanding their feelings for each other! And of course I had to mention Mrs Hudson, because she loves Sherlock and she really cares about him. Do you like Mrs H? :)
Sherlock's breath hitched, the feeling of John's warm palms pressed on his sides felt so comfortable, it didn't warm him up just from the outside, but even from inside. His heart pounded at least two times faster than normal, something strong swelled in his chest and filled his insides with the warmth of being wanted and cared about.
A very unusual sound, really uncharacteristic for the self-proclaimed High-functioning Sociopath, reached John's ears and cut the stream of his memories. It sounded like a...
The doctor didn't hear a word. He kept staring on the thing in his hands. Oh God did Sherlock..." Oh Sherlock, is it your work? Did you knit this on your own?"
John couldn't help himself but think how paternal Greg looked right now, he would never have thought how much the DI cared about their Consulting Detective. " I know..." He nodded and they both paused in their thoughts.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock couldn't help but smile at the sight of his little boyfriend in a baggy top he had made. He stroked John's cute round cheek and let his own hand slip down. " John... I... I'm a horrible, ridiculous and incredibly selfish and annoying person. But I'll change for you, I swear. I know I'm a work in the progress but I'm trying..."
That's why John insisted on staying at Baker Street, he didn't feel like letting Sherlock alone under these circumstances, and the detective didn't complain - after all, he was so glad to be near John again! However, things got tense between them when John started to go back to work and on dates with Mary.
John blushed too when he realised what was Sherlock saying. " No... I'm grateful to you. You saved my life. I already said it at your... grave." He choked at this word, he hated it. " But I'll do that again. You are the best man and the most human being... I was so alone, after Afghanistan and your fall, and I owe you so much." He whispered.
He said in a pleading voice, the detective was giving him worries - the doctor knew that he won't sleep well if he doesn't make sure that Sherlock has no internal problems.
He threw the jumper on his bed, rose up on his feet with some effort and started to look for something he could wear. Taking his loosest pyjama bottoms from underneath his pillow and a pair of black underpants from the chest of drawers, he walked out of his bedroom and made his way to the bathroom.
John's body twisted in the effort, hot tears flowed down his round cheeks. " How does it seem?!" He snapped in a hoarse voice. It was a miracle he managed to say it between gags which shook his short frame.
In a shock and surprise, the detective turned around and both cups fell out of his hand, shattering on the kitchen tiles.
The door cracked silently as they slowly opened. Tall thin figure silently crept up through John's room, heading to the bed.
Sherlock was mute for a long time and then he blurted out. " It wasn't on purpose! I never meant to damage your beloved beautiful jumper!"
He nodded slowly and John couldn't help but smile. Except for a sharper exchange of views it wasn't as bad as he expected it to be. After all, he managed to make Sherlock leave his room, eat a bit and stay with him the whole evening. That was a good start.
" Who? Your flatmate?"
From the scars on Sherlock's back, he could tell that the detective has gone through the hell, the power which carved these scratches in his skin must have been brutal. He hoped that one day Sherlock would tell him why he told him nothing about the plan, why he let him grieve and how he came to these injuries.
" John, you came..." It was rising from the back of the living room, right beside the couch. It sounded surprised and a bit desperate, none of the baritone he was used to.
" He seems a bit mad..."
Sherlock rose up from the ground and turned around to face the bearded policeman, with an expression of absolute indifference. Anderson wasn't worth it...
" Hello, Anderson. You're a bit late, don't you think?" He said in the most sarcastic voice he was able to produce.
Feel free to tell me anything, I'm curious about your feelings and opinions! Thank you for reading!
The Detective Inspector sighed and made a few careful steps towards the man as if he was approaching the wild animal. " Sherlock, I've already told you that I don't just do what your brother tells me. I'm here because I'm worried about you...
I hope that there aren't too many grammar or autocorrect mistakes, if there are, I'm sorry :).
" Look, it's absolutely understandable that this happened to you. It's the part of PTSD, everybody has different symptoms..." He tried to soothe him a bit.
It was something around 11 o'clock in the evening when keys rattled in the lock of the entrance door and announced someone's entrance.
" John, that's the reason why I haven't tell you. It's not your fault, you don't have to feel guilty. It simply happened... " Sherlock tried to convince him, John didn't have a right to blame himself for it.
" So when I wrecked it..."
Together they headed through the corridor leading to Sherlock's room. With some effort, John took the handle and opened the door, kicking them open to let themselves in.
As it seemed, he won't be given the answer - Sherlock continued to shake like an aspen in the wind and closed his eyes shut as he tried to sent the anxiety away. " John..." He whined when he failed.
Her cruel laughter stung in his ears and took away the rest of the self-esteem he had left. How come he didn't see that?! He was the only Consulting Detective in the world, he could tell everything about
Bending down in front of the bed, the ex-soldier put his hand on Sherlock's shoulder, the anger forgotten.
Boys had spent a nice evening with a little walk around the surrounding area, admiring the peaceful landscape of Oxfordshire, but it took a bit longer than they expected. When they arrived at the place with their tents, the sun had already gone down.
John didn't wait for anything, grabbed Sherlock's trembling fleshy shoulders and shook with him gently.
Sherlock folded his doughy arms over his chest. " I'm clean if that's what you're asking about... Well, if that's all, you can go home now. And tell my brother that he doesn't have to worry..." He said, his voice seemingly neutral as if he was trying to prove him that there's nothing wrong with him.
The raven-haired genius opened his mouth to say that the pleasure was just one-sided, but before he managed to say a word, something hard smashed his head and he fell into a darkness of unconsciousness.
" But Jawn... I want to go with you!" Sherlock whined theatrically and spread out his arms in indignation. Why John didn't want him? He needed him, he was the key to this whole situation, he knew things they didn't!
He had no idea what he had ever done to deserve such a great and kind human being as John Watson was. The good doctor somehow managed to stay even though Sherlock still 'sulked' in his room, refusing to poke out his head from his shelter.
" Hey, just look at me... Breathe." John whispered, his voice filled with concern. He was so worried about him. " What happened? Just talk to me, please..."
" Sorry, I didn't mean to..." John's cheeks blushed and he felt like a teenager who had just been caught snogging with a girl...
" Sorry... What did you eat, John?" He asked, wondering what could disagree with John's stomach.
John, come back - SH
Sherlock sneered, but deep inside his heart was overflowing with joy. " As you say, Captain Watson..." He said as he laid down on his side beside his flatmate. He frowned when he spotted that John was curled in himself again, his face crumpled in unpleasantness. The raven-haired man simply couldn't stand the look in his face.
Despite that, the sight of his (former) flatmate raised the corners of John's lips in a smile.
When the clothing was taken off, John couldn't resist an urge to look at the man's bare chest.
He knew that the detective was home now, safe and alive, but worries gnawed his mind. Something was definitely wrong, he could feel it in his bones that something very bad has happened to his friend. But what? John didn't want to force Sherlock to talk about it when the man didn't want to, but he couldn't let him suffer.
" Jo-Jo-... John! I-I wa-was go-gone for two y-years!"
A sob found a way out of Sherlock's throat and suddenly he couldn't stop the wave of emotion which he tried to suppress for too long.
The doctor didn't wait for anything and immediately stripped his cuddly stripped jumper. Before the detective had a chance to look at him with a questioning face, he pulled the collar over his head and helped him into the warm clothing.
" Yes, it is! You're scaring me, Sherlock! I don't recognise you anymore!"
" 'kay... We will talk tomorrow..." The doctor breathed and finally closed his tired oceanic eyes. Then he remembered something. " Oh, one more thing... You're forbidden to approach the kitchen less than ten steps..."
" Shush... Don't talk like that, don't upset yourself even more... He really cares about you we all do... We're not leaving you alone in this mess..." He promised and gave both Sherlock's shoulders a light squeeze, meaning every word he said.
Why would he hide from him? Was it because of Sherlock's new bulk?
He opened and closed his mouth a couple of times, trying to find the best words for this. It couldn't sound patronizing, but he couldn't let it go, either.
He knew it when he heard the screams in the other room. He knew it when the captured MI6 agent started sobbing, apologizing, sounding exhausted, and all the secrets had come spilling out. They made sure Sherlock could hear it as the man doomed them both.
"Not like that"
Mycroft was pointedly not looking at either of them.
The glare he received in return was answer enough so he just snorted and picked up the paper. "Alright then, suit yourself."
"left?" Sherlock asked one afternoon, while he was putting a picture of the Eiffel tower together. "How's Mrs. Hudson? Lestrade?" it was the first time since asking about Mycroft and the mission, that the detective attempted a proper conversation again.
"Look, I- I'm not going to lie and say that I don't- that I don't wonder about what happened, but I'm not-" John continued "If you want to tell me, I'm here and I'm gonna listen, but if you- if you don't want to talk about it, I get it."
Greg walked further into the flat and ignored both John's questions and Sherlock's antagonism. "You were right. It was in the dirt samples we got from under her nails." He said, sounding victorious. He always got like this when a lead turned out to be true. "We tracked him down; the mud on his boot matches."
He smiled. "Right"
But the doctor just nodded. "Yes, I understood."
"I want you." Sherlock said simply.
long that he knew he wasn't going to last.
"He's perfectly fine. It was just an expected side effect of one of his antibiotics. He might continue to get nauseous, in which case you can call a nurse in again." She said in a very relaxed voice, like nothing was the matter.
She lifted her hand toward it, almost as if she had forgotten about it. "Yeah, I got it cut. Needed a change, you know?"
With his eyes stinging with tears from the pain of his now broken ring finger, Sherlock had a strange, vulnerable inner-dialogue where some part of him asked himself for forgiveness, because he was tired of fighting and he couldn't bring himself to do it anymore.
I hope you enjoy!
"It'll get so, so much better."
The door to his cell opened hours into it, the smell of cigarette smoke being let in and he almost asked for one, himself. He saw four of his captors file in, all chatting animatedly in Serbian. He didn't catch much of what they were saying, but thought they were discussing something trivial, like a game on the telly.
He still enjoyed the fact that he was clothed whereas John was not; it gave him a sense of control. He also felt much more relaxed now that the other man had already had an orgasm. It felt as though, if he were to stop things half way, it wouldn't be so frustrating for his lover. That knowledge took some of the pressure off of him and made him feel like he was free to be honest without hurting John's feelings.
Sherlock nodded minutely "I just- don't think my brain cells are working anymore" he finally said.
He was left trembling as the young man walked away, and the overwhelming smell of alcohol made it impossible for him to sleep.
He added that last part for good measure.
"Is it good?" he asked, and it was a mix between
. The older Holmes simply looked away in acceptance, relief.
Sherlock's mouth twitched at that, and his eyes visibly softened despite his efforts to keep a poker face. "Well, you've already got us out of the flat, might as well."
"Ok, what? What are we talking about?" John, of course, had gotten up from his chair and was now standing behind his lover with a very deep frown on his face.
John had to look away, he felt guilty enough that he had disappeared on Mrs. Hudson and refused to see Lestrade after Sherlock's death. He hadn't spoken to them in years. It was simply too hard to face them, to set foot in Baker Street or the Yard.
There was silence in the room for the next few minutes as John looked at the pictures again, and again and again. His eyes glued to them because he couldn't look anywhere else. His eyes were watering and his throat was closing and he didn't want to break down in front of Sherlock and just make it all worse.
"No, no, he did much more than sodding jump off a bloody roof, you have no fucking idea-"
But he learned to let it go- Sherlock had been tortured and starved, and that was that. Finding out exactly what the torture had entailed would only serve to soothe John's curiosity. It wasn't going to undo the damage and it wasn't going to help the detective.
They stay in silence for a little while, but eventually John's fingers still and he speaks again "Maybe we should wrap up for tonight"
He was made to do some very simple physio from his bed, mainly someone would ask him to push against their hand with his feet, or hold them up off the bed without letting them fall. It did, eventually, lead to him being ok'ed to try and walk for the first time.
He almost jumped in anticipation at getting a text. Only three people ever texted him: one was currently doing the dishes a few meters away and the other two usually only texted about cases.
"So… he going to let us watch it by ourselves, then?" John prompted after a while.
Sherlock was grinning into the kiss and it was perfect. They stumbled their way inside the flat, leaving their coats behind on the hook, but never quite untangling from each other.
"That was
The only break in his routine was when he got his meal of the day. Usually it was stale bread and a congealed sort of soup, which he now had to eat handless since they never freed them after the first man had tied them. There was also the rare occasion when he would be pulled out of his cell by two or three men, shoved into a separate room and hosed down with freezing water to lessen his foul smell.
He was about to breath in to say some biting goodbye, but Anderson was faster.
With this decision, he turned to the kitchen unit and put the kettle on. Perhaps the nice hot cup of tea could cheer him up...
He only left his bedroom when he needed a shower or use the toilet, grateful for a spare door to the bathroom right next to his bed.
The red-faced policeman made his way towards Sherlock, who took a step back. " Shut up, you disgusting - !" He shouted in Sherlock's face, but they had no chance to find out what name Anderson wanted to call him. Because in that very time, the detective lost his control, clenched his right hand into a fist and punched him right in his nose.
Turning around, he took a look at the kitchen, finally seeing it properly.
Sherlock sighed in relief when his hungry stomach calmed down again and he ran his hand through his black well-cultivated hair, glad that at least his dark curls were spared the damage. Quite the opposite in fact, the quality of them got maybe even better with the new diet he was forced to follow during his time in Appledore.
Susan blinked in confusion. " Sorry, what?" She asked.
John blinked in a confusion and then his face fell. " Well... Oh, sorry, if you want me to go, I'll - " His voice trailed off and his shoulders tensed visibly.
" I must have deleted that..." Sherlock shrugged his shoulders disinterestedly and rubbed the back of his head, thin fingers brushing the black soft curls of his raven hair.
The soldier stroked Sherlock's wet hair. " Sherlock, it's not pathetic, it makes you human... You're not a machine, you're made of flesh and bones... And furthermore, I'm sure that something has happened in the past, am I right? That's why you're scared." He suggested, knowing that experiences from the past couple affect human psyche easily.
" I-I-I'm a-al... a-alive, Jo-John... " Sherlock said, his chin was even more cramping than before. He closed his eyes and hunched his back as he waited for the stream of insults and curses.
John chortled and shook his head. Did Sherlock really believe that? " And that's why you think that I'm fearless? I'm not, do you have any idea how terrified I was when I was in Afghanistan? Or with that horrible bomb-vest attached to me?" His arms covered with goosebumps at the thought of standing at the pool, with green parka decorated with explosives.
The doctor leaned forward so he could hear him better. " Yes? What is it?" He whispered and tilted his head to the left.
As it seemed, he really thought so. Greg knew that the Consulting Detective never had many friends, but he really didn't expect him to think so little about himself and the people around him. What had they done to him?
Have a nice night without nightmares,
" I just needed some time to process everything, Sherlock! Because when the man, who died in front of my very eyes suddenly appears in London as if nothing has happened is really bit not good! Do you have any idea how horrible those two years have been for me?! What I went through?! How miserable I felt? I guess you don't!" He growled through gritted teeth. Just saying these words sent him back to times when he felt like an utter mess, to days filled with much bigger loneliness and shock than he had ever witnessed - and he thought he was in bad state when he returned from Afghanistan.
The first time Sherlock spoke, John wasn't in the room.
"The Yard's paying for our cab" Sherlock informed him as a way of accepting the terms, and then proceeded to hang up the phone.
"Things- I- well. I've-" broken down entirely without you, I let myself go and I couldn't find a way out, the world lost its color and life lost its meaning and there were some days I couldn't get myself out of bed "been working. I ahm, got a job at another surgery and, ahm, yeah."
He'd never had any intention to watch it at Baker Street – it'd have felt sacrilegious – but asking for that first and then working his way up to what he actually wanted seemed like a safe bet.
They hadn't, ever. It had been well over a year since their return to Baker Street, and their physical relationship had progressed tremendously well. Sherlock became more and more adventurous about touching and exploring John's body. He had been much slower in allowing John to return the favor, however.
John eyed him a couple of times and then traced his fingers across the table, looking very much like he was trying to properly phrase something.
Slowly, he made his way to his armchair and sat down, looking around a bit thoughtfully before settling on "I didn't- I wasn't trying to talk about you behind your back." He said, finally looking his friend in the face.
"I told you I'm not taking any cases right now, Mycroft; I've already got one. Tell him, John."
"So we, ah, we overheard what you told Amanda."
In an uncharacteristic move, Sherlock arched ever so slightly so that he pointedly brushed against his lover's erection.
"Just going to clean you up, ok?" she said.
"Hmm?"
John nodded at that "Yeah, that was a surprise for me too." He admitted. "It feels like nothing else."
"I want to get married" the detective reiterated. "I want to get married to you. I've never wanted anything more than I want this right now."
"Please. I- I just-" he tried to bargain with another unmoved captor, but then he got onto his knees and voluntarily moved closer to the man, even before he was ordered. "I'll use my mouth, please, let me-" his hands were shaking, still free from his stunt yesterday, and he reached for the guy's trousers with urgency. The man almost moved to stop him, but once he realized what Sherlock was doing he allowed it.
He was growing weak and everything felt cold around him, why didn't he have a coat? He should be wearing a coat in the winter. He'd stare at his hand and was horrified to see he was missing fingers- what had he done? His wrist looked thinner and thinner every time he did that. Was he dying? Was he sick? Why were his fingers falling off?
The chorus of sniffles echoing in the church almost drew the attention away from Sherlock's own teary, reddened eyes. He was glad that, aside from John, really only Lestrade was seeing the state he was in.
"You've got ten minutes" Lestrade said to Sherlock. "Come on, Sally, not now. Let him do his thing" he told his co-worker, ushering her away from the scene.
John closed his eyes and bit down on his bottom lip, his hands fisting in the couch cushions. And then Sherlock's mouth was engulfing him in tight, wet heat and he went to heaven.
He waited exactly three minutes after John had left the flat and then he jumped out of his seat and snatched his phone from the coffee table.
"Will you let me show you something? I'm just going to take my gloves off." He moved his hands very, very slowly. "I'm not going to do anything else, will you let me do that?"
Sherlock huffed in disdain, like John had just won himself a place near Anderson in the consulting detective's scale of regard. He dropped the shoe onto the table and turned to look at his lover with undivided attention.
They did, actually. Sherlock had found the marks on the girl's body to be too precise, almost window dressing, like someone was putting her on display. The autopsy revealed what he'd already guessed: she had been kept and raped for extended periods of time. This wasn't a group of drunken men disposing of a body after they realized their mistake; they were dealing criminals smart enough to pull off long-term captivity.
He'd said it to try to lighten the mood, but Sherlock froze in his arms.
John eyed him with a mix of curiosity and reluctance. Sherlock could already see his friend forming a litany of objections, so he said it again with more resolve "John, I want to go home. I want to go back to Baker Street."
Before he could think much about it, he raised a hand and ran his fingers across the locks; it's something he'd always wanted to do. Sherlock looked at him questioningly, but just smiled. And then he leaned over ever so slightly, the detective meeting him halfway in a kiss that tasted like eggs and butter.
Two more men came during that day, at different times, they used him as the others had done and walked away in much the same way. No one untied his very well secured hands and no one bothered to pull his trousers back up. He was just left to slump to his side and try to catch his breath.
A gun went off once. Immediate, precise, splatter on the wall, no screaming.
"Yes" Sherlock half moaned, half gasped, curling his toes and arching even more. God, his nerves were lighting up like a bonfire inside him. "Faster, John" he tried to say, his voice coming out much lower and husky than his usual baritone.
Sherlock nodded.
He nodded.
During the first week, Sherlock didn't even shift; he was still hooked up to the respirator and being kept under heavy sedation. John became intimately acquainted with the room's couch and had created a nest of sorts for himself there. Some days Mycroft would come by and they would eat dinner or have tea, then the man would disappear to speak with the doctors – he didn't volunteer any information about the extent or nature of Sherlock's injuries, and John didn't ask. He knew Mycroft wasn't going to tell him, and he was afraid to examine the reason too closely.
"So you
Sherlock obliges, placing his head on John's lap and facing away from the paused screen. He curls in on himself and sighs heavily when he feels John's fingers in his hair.
"That was… pretty bloody good" John assured him, realizing that all this time Sherlock had been holding back from thrusting into him. "Do that again"
"Yes, yes it's me. You're home. You're safe."
John threw an arm over his face, not believing what had just happened. That might have been the best orgasm he had ever had and that was saying something coming from Three Continents Watson. He continued to pet Sherlock's hair even after the man had completely let him go; he couldn't bear to lose to contact
He was dead.
Clearing his throat a bit, he let his hand slowly travel down his own body and his fingers ghost ever so lightly over his clothed erection.
Sleep, open your mouth, sleep, open your mouth, sleep, open your mouth. As far as he was concerned, that's how life had always been.
Their position and the staggering amount of cloth around them weren't terribly conducive to the task, but John had put men back together in the desert with whisky, rags and a prayer – he could make this work.
"Sherlock, will you- what are you trying to get at?" it was four in the morning and John wasn't sure his brain was working properly anymore.
"Did you need anything or…?" he prompted, his heart was still racing and he had no idea why. There was literally no news Mycroft could give him that'd be worse than the one he'd gotten two years ago.
He also felt as his lover started to tremble in his arms, but he quickly realized Sherlock had let go of him to wrap his hand around his own cock and pump himself furiously in a rhythm to match John's own thrusts.
you planning to make an honest man out of me, Sherlock Holmes?" John prodded, as he moved on the bed so he was sat right next to his fiancé.
"My mother insisted on that one." Sherlock told her, because he could deduce the picture she was looking at by the shades of red reflecting onto her face.
This wasn't so bad, he decided after a minute. It hurt, and it burned, but losing his fingers had hurt much more; even the whipping to his back- that had been the worst. This was- it was just- he didn't need to attach a separate meaning to it simply because it was sexual. So what if it was? Pain was pain was pain. And as far as pain went, this didn't rate that high on the scale. He was fine. This was fine.
Defeated, the doctor in charge had him transition to a nasal feeding tube, which was now strapped onto his face.
Greg took pity on the young investigator and told him to get back to it. Then he crossed his arms, and tilted his head at Sherlock, as though to say 'Well?'
(See the end of the chapter for
"I just- need a minute" he said and his voice was so breathless that he wondered if Sherlock even heard him.
He put the metal box down on the table and brought his hands up to cradle his lover's face before kissing him. It wasn't a chaste kiss, either; it was hungry and opened mouthed and full of tongue.
"Don't be cocky, you git." The doctor retorted, but it was just as light hearted.
Promptly, his lover walked over and lay down, slightly propped up on his pillow.
"It's not anything I haven't said before, I don't know why-" she started, but the DI cut her off.
His friend frowned "Did Mycroft bring them?"
He actually grew to understand Sherlock much more during these episodes of intense curiosity. He finally understood what it was like to
"Exactly" the DI replied and he looked equals parts elated that they finally had the lead they wanted all along and weighed down by the darker turn the case had just taken.
After the current two men finished with him, he was dragged onto his feet and out of the room down a path he knew well. He was shoved unceremoniously into the shower room and the cold, unforgiving water was thrown on him. Only when the men had let him go so they could spray him, did Sherlock realize he couldn't stand on his own anymore, his legs were too weak.
It wasn't that he had suddenly become afraid of crowds, or people. But something about being out in the open made him feel like a target. He was weak and wounded and slow and if any friend of the twenty one Serbian deceased wanted to track him down and have their revenge, it'd only be too easy and-
He moved onto the next picture with the same hungry eyes, and he glanced back to Sherlock only for a second. "Mycroft's been busy, hasn't he?" but as he cycled through the pictures, his expression started to shift into something more guarded and his grip on the photographs tightened.
"Jam" Sherlock said, matter-of-factly.
It was just little huffs at first, but then his eyes opened half way and the coughs grew more violent. The way he moved made it clear he was attempting to sit up, to lift his torso, but he wasn't strong enough for that.
That night, both of them slept remarkably well.
"We're going home." John's voice was steady and kind. But he also managed to sound very much in command, even if his legs were half covered in vomit.
John shifted back a bit so he could see his lover's face properly. Then he ran his hand comfortingly over Sherlock's even as he frowned in confusion "Paranoid about what?"
"Alright, come here. I got you, ok? You're alright." he kept saying as he wiped his friend's mouth and neck gently. "There we go, that's better now."
The proud sergeant stepped forward and away from the car, looking down at her feet before finally being able to face the detective.
He was dead
When they pulled apart, John rocked their hips together very pointedly. His legs on either side of Sherlock's body giving him complete control of the situation. "Yes?"
The silent gaze was held for such a long time that his brother was the one to smack his lips together pointedly as he swayed back and forth. "Well, then. I have a car waiting for me. Anthea will get in touch and you can sort it out with her when you'll want to go have it installed." He said, tapping his umbrella once on the floor.
His hand was forced one night when he woke up from one of his nightmares. Well, it wasn't forced so much as politely nudged. He could have ignored it, but in the end he didn't.
"I does the others, if you want" he offered, stepping away to give Sherlock a chance to redeem himself.
"John" he breathed out, and it was a request. He could actually feel himself pulsing, needing, ready.
Both the John and DI heard a snort coming from their favorite consulting detective as the man walked ahead echoing "No signs" as he went.
But the detective shook his head. "But I want to, John.
He didn't exactly connect the moans with a negative thing – when they moaned like that, it meant they were done and they were leaving – but it was something that he had only ever heard in that context. So it was very hard not to be reminded of the hundreds of times he'd heard that same sound before.
to take my clothes off?" the shorter man continued.
Their eyes locked for a moment, both of them holding the gaze for a bit longer than necessary. And then John leaned in and kissed Sherlock's lips, tasting the coffee on his tongue. It was quick, but it was filled with affection.
"Sherlock, Sherlock, Sherlock, stop!! Stop, stop, I'm gonna come-"John warned desperately, his hand squeezing the detective's as he felt his orgasm building.
This dissociating had happened to him before, back in Serbia. He'd check out of reality, because he didn't want to be there for what was happening. His mind was very used to hiding itself away and--
He didn't even see where they got it, but suddenly Leader had a piece of wood that looked like the broken leg of a chair and only beat Sherlock with it once before he nudged him onto his back with it.
There was a beat of silence and then Sherlock shifted a bit "Where is he?"
"I want to." Sherlock said; it wasn't a tense, determined voice. It was a light, simple statement of fact.
John let out a startled laugh.
It was nothing personal. They weren't trying to actively hurt him or torture him anymore; he was simply an unexpected spoil of war. The men would walk in, do their business and walk out, relieving their biological drive like one would walk into the loo to take a piss before getting back to work.
Sherlock was still staring at the little device in his hand and something inexplicable was expanding in his chest like a balloon. He had never loved John as much as he did at that moment. He wouldn't have thought a human being capable of holding so much love inside themselves.
The DI looked back towards his co-workers, down to the floor, and then to John and Sherlock again.
It sure as hell didn't feel like it.
He could also now feel that his arse was very much sticky; Sherlock had come right with him.
"I never knock" the man replied, frowning a bit.
"Yeah. That- yeah" he murmured, trying to keep the façade of conversation.
Still, the three fingers of his right hand were free, even if the rest of his hand was covered in bandages, and he trusted that they were steady enough to hold a spoon. The trembling had nothing to do with physical injuries and everything to do with nerves.
John had to laugh at that, burying his face momentarily in his partner's neck. "Well, I'm glad you do." He said, kissing whatever part of him was closer.
"I can't breathe" he told her at the threshold, unable to step into the bathroom. "I- I can't breathe- I can't- I- I'm going to die-"
"Yes" he answered, licking his lips.
Sherlock moved around a bit, taking in some of the details he hadn't seen at first and cataloguing them for later. He needed to take his gloves off so he could examine the crime scene properly, but he couldn't show his hands when he was surrounded by people.
None of his assailant's friends seemed very happy with what the man had done. Sherlock heard him being admonished loudly as well as pushed aside roughly. The guy had apparently been too drunk to realize what he was doing.
"Pictures" he said truthfully, as John took a seat on his armchair.
Sometimes their routine was broken by a visitor, Mycroft or Lestrade or, one time, Mr. and Mrs. Holmes. That was one for the history books, John will say, and Sherlock had even introduced him as his partner. They were both invited over for Christmas, even if at the time it had still been five months away.
He shook his head. There was no reason to be angry with Mycroft, and he knew this. The man had done nothing wrong- in fact, if anything, he was the only person in the world who felt John's pain as keenly as he did. The truth was: John simply didn't wish to be reminded.
Then John was rejoining him on the bed and
That really didn't answer much of his question, but then he supposed John wouldn't know. John didn't know about his mission, about Moriarty, about anything- John thought he was dead- how was John even here? He frowned.
He nodded at all the information and still kept looking at the pictures in his hands. He was almost sad to see The Kid among the bodies.
Sherlock, who had been silent all the way from the car, just hummed as he put his fingers together under his chin. "And what
It had hardly been his plan to get captured in Serbia, but in the end it worked out as it allowed him to access the group's computer and contact Mycroft through secure channels. And by secure channels he meant that someone was now on route, possibly by foot, to personally deliver a handwritten note across the border. He couldn't know how long it would take for them to get his encrypted coordinates to his brother, but it had been ten days, now. If he was feeling rather optimistic, he estimated a month.
Sherlock was frowning as much as John was, and Lestrade faltered at their expressions.
He wanted to see John's face the whole time. He wanted to see any micro expression the doctor would make so he could be sure he wasn't hurting him.
Sherlock listened for the pattern and then he narrowed his eyes at John. "You texted Mycroft." He accused pointedly.
John twitched inside him at the request, and the thought of coming inside Sherlock made him start moving again almost immediately. He closed his eyes and let himself go, picking up speed and focusing entirely on the sensations.
Sherlock squeezed his eyes shut for a moment before answering, still facing the back wall and not John. "It's not like I planned-"
"John?" he asked one day, and the doctor looked up from his crosswords.
It made John incredibly happy to see him recovering like this- recovering his will, his weight and appetite; and even his curls as his hair had grown back just enough that you could tell it wasn't straight.
Finally, Sherlock looked away and stared out the window instead. "I didn't."
"Can I see?"
This is, indeed, the end of it. And I didn't mean for the ending to be a cliffhanger? It's more of an idea of what's going to happen in the sequel (aka, the equivalent of Did you miss me? hah).
"I can't bring it over to Baker Street, it's evidence! Ask for anything else, come on" Lestrade pleaded, feeling like he was walking on thin ice.
She was face up, arm visibly twisted and skin littered with bruises. There were several scars on her legs, but almost no trace of blood anywhere. The body had been in the river for quite some time before being fished out – it looked blue and swollen.
It was obvious to the detective that his lover had just gone on a mental tangent, but he couldn't tell what it was just from looking. The silence held for so long that he was about to open his mouth again, but John finally nodded and leaned over to kiss Sherlock on the forehead.
The blatant movement obviously didn't go unnoticed and Sherlock dropped his head onto the cushion as though in defeat, a sigh that could have been a huff leaving him.
There was a gasp from the detective, but it was clearly not a bad one, so John grew more encouraged. He kept running the tips of his fingers up and down his lover's skin, past his entrance to his perineum to the base of his balls and then back. He never breached him, just felt around, exploring, as his lover arched into his touch.
"I do not know what will become of my brother once he regains conscience, which is why I'm requesting your help with this issue. I believe a familiar face ought to… facilitate matters." He looked away and took a sip of his nearly untouched scotch. "I will of course, compensate you for your time away-"
"…hold him now-" he heard the young boy tell his friend and there was some shifting around behind him. He heard the zipper of trousers again and braced himself for the pain- it didn't hurt any less the second time around. His body jerked away in reflex, but the strong arms holding him down didn't budge.
He nodded slowly, but he realized how tense his posture was and how tightly he was squeezing his hands shut.
The next moment the detective was sitting up so fast his head almost collided with John's jaw. He stared at the doctor wide eyed for a couple of seconds and then he jumped onto his feet.
John was still looking guilty and pained when he turned back to look at him, but Sherlock promptly crossed the room and took the man's face between his hands. "John. I am fine." He said very pointedly before kissing him briefly.
-While I looked up and researched medical healing times etc I was more concerned with making them fit my ideas than being accurate. So it's not perfect.
"Hey, what are you doing up? You alright?" he asked again, and he was now standing just a foot away from the bed.
He could see John positively biting down on his urge to volunteer to help him with the food, but he appreciated the sentiment nonetheless.
When he opened his eyes, he saw Sherlock's face flushed and his mouth half open. With his heavy-lidded eyes, the detective looked like he was in total bliss. The sight went straight to John's cock and he twitched; this was amazing.
The feeding tube wouldn't come off for another couple of weeks, still. Sherlock's intake of food was consistent, but he didn't manage even a fraction of the calories he needed at the moment. He had been in the hospital for six weeks, now, and he no longer looked like a skeleton even if he was still much too thin for his frame.
"Why didn't you tell me you went with Greg? I could have come with" John asked when he had returned, and he sounded just a bit hurt.
"One should consider knocking before invading other people's homes, Lestrade." He said with a low, growling voice while piercing the policeman with his narrowed eyes.
John let it go and gave the whole thing up as a lost cause. He started finding things to do around the flat, instead. He taught himself how to cook – he was actually rather good at it now – he grew plants under the smiley face graffiti and he jogged every afternoon while Sherlock had tea with Mrs. Hudson. Well, she sat there having tea and talking while he pretended to ignore her and continued doing whatever he'd been doing before she came in.
Now Donovan really did throw her hands up in the air in surrender. "Oh great. Did you hear that, boss? Our double gang-rape homicide wasn't committed by rapists." She said, equal parts frustration and sarcasm. "It's like he wants us to waste our time."
Needless to say, by the time Mycroft came to collect them, they were both barely done with getting ready.
His right hand found the door knob and he gripped it hard with his three fingers, but when he tried to twist it, it didn't move at all. It was a one way door.
The younger man was pulsing, unbelievably hard under him as they rocked against each other fully clothed.
"Wake up, little rat" one of them said, nudging him with his foot.
A noncommittal hum was all the response he got.
"Not much" he answered simply; he knew Sherlock wasn't asking about Moriarty. "I told him that you were away in Serbia, and why. Anything he may know about your time there he has extrapolated from seeing your current physical state. I did not give him access to your medical files."
." The consulting detective pointed out matter-of-factly.
When he pulled one of the large stacks of cardboard boxes away from the back of the room, he noticed that the wooden cabinet behind it wasn't actually mounted to the wall. He pushed it away.
"And of course, you know that." John shook his head, but smiled nonetheless.
"I know"
." Mycroft interrupted, because no matter what the doctor would have said, he had done that and more. If it could be accomplished by human hands, Mycroft had done it to make sure his brother came home and if he could be sure of nothing else, he was sure of that.
Not only was there a bottle of lube in John's hand, but it was one that had clearly seen quite a lot of use.
"You obey, or I chop your dick off" his captor told him very matter-of-factly. "We no need it" and then he let go, Sherlock's entire body slumping in relief, even as his lower body still pulsed in pain from the grip.
"Give me the keys!" she demanded, ignoring him. "Give them to me or I'll shoot you!!"
He had been allowed to interrogate their suspect, but there was only so much he could do with a freshly showered, custodial-uniformed culprit. He was going to go through the man's actual possessions, clothes and flat later.
There was something about this bed, about lying with his back up against the wall and John next to him; it felt unbelievably safe. He reached out and pulled the doctor closer to him so that the shorter man was essentially being used as a blanket. Then he pressed his nose to John's hair, inhaling the scent and enjoying the man's arms wrapping around his body.
He admitted to having disposed of the bodies, but refused to talk about his accomplices or about where they had kept the women.
"Yes, yes. We'll meet you there" Sherlock replied. And it was hard to make his usual dismissive hand gestures with his hands stuck inside his dressing gown, but he did it anyway.
He spent the whole night dripping wet, shaking in the unforgiving cold as he had neither his blanket nor his trousers anymore. He wondered what John was doing right now, half a world away. He was probably sitting in his chair by the fire and having a hot cuppa as he read the paper or wrote on his blog.
Don't cry. Don't cry. Don't cry. John chanted in his own head, but he felt the tear fall before he could do anything about it. "I didn't" it was only two words, but they managed to come out broken nonetheless.
What they eventually reached, with their slow pace, was a beautiful terrace. It was much larger than the balcony in their room, and it faced the actual gardens, giving it a breathtaking view.
At Sherlock's skeptical expression, he carried on "Look, Sherlock, I- I lost you. I lost you once and I- when I first saw you when you came back, when I saw you here- this is it. This is it for me. I'm just- I don't want a relationship anymore" he said very seriously, before amending quickly "with other people! I don't want a relationship outside this. You and I. If we're going to be friends, we're going to be friends. If we're going to be more, we're going to be more. Whatever it is, this is it."
"Sherlock, they're- they're dead. They're all dead. Moriarty's dead, he-" John started, but the detective shook his head emphatically.
The background picture was of a sandy-haired man smiling at the camera. He had a green jumper over a button-up shirt and one hand sticking out as though he had taken the picture himself.
At night, one of the younger men walked in with a container that held a liquid in it.
"Good?" he asked, then. And it was also him making sure his lover was ok.
Made to wait outside, John slid helplessly onto the floor. He hid his face in his arms and pulled at his hair in frustration. His medical degree had never felt more useless.
In fact, the doctor in him understood much more from the words 'internal damage' than he had at first.
He glanced towards the door, beyond which lay the man who stuck with him through it all, through thick and thin and death and back. Then he looked back at her hopeful, frightened face and smiled.
"Not just that, John. We've seen idiots make worse mistakes before." He pointed to the windows in the still of the screen "There were no shadows from the train. The lightbulb didn't swing and there was no sound, so I dismissed it. But
The doctor's eyes widened in surprised and he pulled back even more, as though trying to look at the younger man properly.
"They would just slow down my thinking process" Sherlock said, bringing John out of his memory.
"Sherlock," she called out, her voice uncharacteristically tentative.
There was no singing from Sherlock's part. At first he tried to deduce his way out of it, even as he was beaten and whipped and drowned. He knew that no matter what they did to him, he could not allow himself to break. There were people back home he was trying to protect and he wasn't going to leave this place without dismantling the very last of Moriarty's web.
"You want me to make you some tea? Might help?" he wanted to reach out and run his hand through Sherlock's buzz cut, but his hands stayed firm at his side. Despite their mutual feelings, there was something between them still, a line they had not crossed, and he couldn't bring himself to do it.
"No. No, you're not. You're not." The doctor agreed, immediately, matter-of-factly. "You, Sherlock Holmes, are the strongest, bravest, most brilliant man I have ever met."
"I… need your help" the younger man said, finally; he looked honestly tired.
Sighing very loudly and rolling his eyes in exasperation, Sherlock plopped down onto John's chair and gestured vaguely with his left hand before remembering his missing fingers and hiding them in the pockets of his dressing gown. Lestrade, unsurprisingly, hadn't noticed. "It's the case, John. The same one with the water samples we looked over yesterday."
Then Sherlock found the shower enclosure, stepped inside and closed the glass door. He turned on the water and soon the bathroom was filled with the comforting dripping sound. The hot water flowed down his body, the pleasantly warm stream loosening his flexed muscles.
Then he realised something. What if John doesn't want to live with me anymore? What if he came to take his things and move out? It would be more possible...
" Moriarty had his snipers on you, Lestrade and Mrs Hudson... I just couldn't let you die... " Admitted Sherlock, took a shaking breath and continued. " When I jumped out of the Barts Hospital, I was sent on... some kind of mission. My task was breaking Moriarty's web in the world, so he won't be able to hurt anyone... Everything went quite well... Until Serbia... "
" I chased him to the Regent's Park... I almost had him and then..." His narrow face with his marvellous cheekbones lost all of its fair colour, his piercing blue-green eyes widened, blinking rapidly as if he was trying to drive away tears.
In a shock and surprise, the detective turned around and both cups fell out of his hands, shattering on the kitchen tiles.
His friend was... gorgeous. The rays of the morning sun shone on his dark, almost black hair and painted brown highlights into his soft, messy curls. John smiled, he always wondered how Sherlock's hair would be like when he wakes up...
" Fine..." John mumbled uncertainly and slid into his khaki green sleeping bag. He owned it for so long, he has stopped counting years it belonged to him. It had outlived even Afghanistan. Those weren't good memories, but somehow he still could not get rid of it.
To : JOHN
The ginger man gave Sherlock's knee a gentle slap and pulled his hand away.
The stream of his memories got cut by the hushed groan which belonged to his best friend, echoing from the bathroom to the living room and kitchen. Sherlock decided to leave the glass of black pop on the table, he'll give it to John later.
And he did. Mycroft looked up from the peg he was knocking on the ground. " Are you jealous, brother dear?" He returned a mocking smile to his cheeky sibling and continued to hammer the peg with a stone.
To : JOHN
Right above the double bed was hanged a big Periodic Table of Elements. John couldn't help but rolled his eyes, but soon he understood it wasn't a good idea... His head began to spin again and he took a big gulp of the drink again.
Then he put the car in gear and they made their way to Baker Street.
The black-haired man just sat on the chair and glared daggers on his vegetable salad, this was the exact thing he wanted to avoid. Eating itself didn't sound appealing to him, but eating in front of John? Maybe he should have stayed in his room, what was he thinking?
" Well, I'll be in the living room if you need me..." The tall man said and headed to the door.
He gritted his teeth. " A-at le-least I-I-I di-didn't g-ge-get m-mad! A-a-and b-by t-the way, th-that st-stupid ga-game as y-you s-say, sa-saved your bl-bloody li-life!" His voice didn't sound as dangerous as he wanted.
Have a nice day and stay safe and healthy!
John shot her with a grateful smile. " Thank you, Mrs H, you're heaven-sent! Don't worry, I'll take care of him..." He swore and got a better grip on his friend.
The kitchen looked alike - at that time it was a pigsty room, it was rather a laboratory than a room for preparing a food. When John came in, he couldn't believe his eyes. Tiles were swept and mopped, the trash was emptied. There were no test tubes and flasks filled with chemicals on their kitchen table or any dirty dishes in the sink. Kitchen unit used to be smudged, now it was shining with clearness. John took a sharp breath and rushed to the fridge, took the handle and opened it sharply. The disappointment almost knocked him down.
The doctor looked around the room. It looked empty, there was no one in the black armchair at the fireplace, nor at his messy desk. Where was that ridiculous man? He was nowhere to be seen, and John felt the uncomfortable sting of guilt in his stomach. He should have come back earlier, it was obvious that the detective needed him.
John's nerves couldn't handle this anymore. It has been a long busy week and he was so looking forward to calm down and just be in the presence of people he cared about. His plan didn't contain standing here and listening to the endless fights between those two stubborn men!
" That's good... Cause I feel the same way, I think..." John's cute round face turned scarlet right after he declared the way he felt about his crazy flatmate. The blood rushed into his soft cheeks and to very tips of his ears. God, he couldn't believe that he had said it out loud...
" With pleasure..." Sherlock smiled and then he was silenced with John's lips. At first, he was quite stiff, but he gave in after a while and began to return sweet little kisses John was giving him. His lips were absolutely perfect, well not just a lips...
JOHN! - SH
" It's fine, there's nothing to be ashamed for..."
Yours
Sherlock raised his head in shock when he heard his name. He looked at the man on the doorstep. John Watson used to be vital, strong and full of happiness and sassy humour. He was short, but well-built, with a softer tummy but firm muscles on his arms and legs.
John gasped for the air, eyes widen in a horror. Sherlock's back was a mess! There wasn't even one little spot left uninjured!
Sherlock's heart dropped. He immediately replaced uncomfortable face with one without interest. " You mean this? Um... It's nothing, just a rag. I wiped the dust with-"
One unread message
John didn't look convinced, there was no way he could have missed the sound of hunger coming from Sherlock's belly. " Are you sure? I think your stomach says otherwise..."
" Why did you c-come?" The detective asked when he finally sat in the car and Mycroft fastened the seat belt across him.
" Hello, Brother Mine... To what do I owe you this pleasure? What brings you to call me in those night hours?" Responded his elder brother and although he sounded sarcastic, he was worried. This could mean only one thing.
He's been under a lot of pressure and stress, there are dark circles under his eyes, he's sleep deprived from the fear of nightmares about the battlefield, I dare say.
" Don't you mind?" Sherlock whispered, pointing towards his hand on John's warm body. John didn't seem to mind very much, but the small soldier never stopped surprising him.
Then John's fingers focused on the button of Sherlock's trousers, undoing them and grasping the waistband to pull them down. In doing so, his hands brushed across Sherlock's sensitive tummy which immediately tried to flex to hide itself in the torso.
He looked still unnaturally pale and exhausted. There were dark bags under his eyes and in the right one the small blood vessel has broken by the effort of the throwing up.
John was the closest person he ever had, except for his family, and he wasn't going to give up on him, even if it meant he would have to sacrifice himself.
Brown was a kind-hearted older man with graying hair, friendly, tanned face and thick glasses, but even despite his good-natured personality, he had to tell him the truth. The honest, unpleasant truth and Sherlock had to face it.
But even though they were enjoying themselves, the younger Holmes had found himself peeking at Greg and Mycroft, the way they sat beside each other, the way Greg held him... His brother became a completely different person whenever near the Detective Inspector, he seemed more relaxed, happier. He always thought he was the more emotional one of the two, he had never expected the Ice Man to find a partner. As it seemed, Mycroft was better in everything. What a git...
He shoved his shaking hands into pockets of his sweatpants and tried to calm down.
" Yeah, but I'm not, only a clothing was burnt... " Sherlock whispered and lowered his sight.
His nose wrinkled in discontent with himself when he looked at the doughy, stretch-marked side covered by blue bruises, and he better pressed the package of frozen peas against his hip.
Sherlock didn't seem very convinced but nodded. John has never lied to him, why would he say these things if they weren't true? Perhaps he was just being polite and nice.
" You don't understand, John... I'm nothing without my Work!" The detective exclaimed as he opened his eyes and wrapped his arms around himself, digging his nails into his elbows.
Sherlock's tongue itched to remark that it COULDN'T GET worse than it already was, but he swallowed it.
" Yeah - milk..." John replied, unaware of what surprise was waiting for him.
Oh God! Sherlock Holmes was kissing him... And he was bloody amazing!
" I'm flattered... I made the straight Three-Continent-Watson gay..." Said the detective, feeling like himself again. Although, John recognised the relief and joy in the teasing sentence.
The skin under John's squared chin wobbled as his throat tried to get rid of the sour unpleasant taste which reminded him of meals he had eaten today. His hands, glued on his lips, prevented him from making the mess in the on the floor.
