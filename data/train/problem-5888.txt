“I am sure your intention was never to harm Captain Rogers' feelings, Sir,” JARVIS tries. Which is cute, really, but completely unnecessary at this point.
For a moment or two, everyone stands and listens to the silence, the lack of invisible instruments in the air, and stares at the flushed faces of their team mates.
” Clint forces the words out, feeling his heart break all over again and fuck, fuck everything, this is exactly why he doesn't
“Yes, good plan. Better plan,” Tony says and pats Steve on the shoulder once, too brief for any warmth to bleed through to his chilled hand. He absolutely does not focus on that brief contact, because Tony Stark is many things, but pathetic isn't one of them. “I knew you weren't all body and no brain, Capsicle,” he snarks instead. Steve doesn't answer.
Tony sighs and leans his head back against the concrete wall; closes his eyes. “Yeah. It's good to know that the only guy who doesn't hate my guts, I created by myself.”
All this time, Tony's reveled in pushing Steve's buttons for the fun of it; for his own, petty enjoyment of seeing Steve's cheeks flare up or hear him stutter – and he's never even realized that it's killing Steve. Tony's
Loki tilts his head. “To watch you die, of course,” he says lightly. “All but the one I choose to keep by my side.” And he puts a hand on Clint's shoulder, who looks like only his agent training keeps him from flinching away from the touch.
.” Clint does a couple of sad, little dance steps, and a couple of invisible back-up singers – and Natasha – start 'ooo'ing as the second refrain comes on.
“No, you-” Loki fights, but he's no match for the Hulk, who grabs the chain – and a hank of Loki's hair with it – and yanks it clean off. Loki yelps as the chain breaks with the force, sending the piece of jewelry falling to the floor by Thor's feet. This is the first time Clint sees it; a dark blue amulet, big and emitting a dull, aquamarine glow where it lies.
“Fury's going to be apoplectic when he sees JARVIS, you do realize that?” Steve asks, but there's no chastising in his voice. Just amusement and a warm, certain kind of fondness that Tony has only started getting used to. It seems to be Steve's 'Tony-voice', a voice that only comes out when Steve talks to – and sometimes about – his new boyfriend.
, the mood of the song changing from sad to angry too quickly for Tony to fully realize until Steve pushes at him – not hard enough to hurt, but hard enough that Tony stumbles back onto the couch, knocking over the coffee cup as he does, hearing it tumble to the floor and spill its remains onto the cream-colored carpet.
” And he smirks humorlessly, hands spread, like he's found the solution already. Some of the team nod along.
” Tony sings, shrugging, wishing he could walk over to the podium to lean against it and let it keep him up, because he doesn't think he'll be able to stand for much longer. Steve flinches and Tony's so grateful he can't see Clint's expression right now. Clint must hate him for wanting what Clint fears most in this world.
, Clint. It's been months. You're not getting better; you're getting worse. Whatever coping mechanisms you're using right now, they aren't doing the trick. And I'm sick of you pushing me away. I'm supposed to have your back.” There's sadness in her eyes too, beside the fury, and Clint swallows.
JARVIS looks down at his new body. It's sleek, slimmer and less menacing than the Iron Man suits – mostly because this thing doesn't need to house a human. JARVIS is still the house, still omnipresent like the God Tony never believed in, but now he's here too. Within reach.
Hulk blinks at that – like no one's ever called him 'mister' before. Clint doesn't suppose anyone has. The bushy, big eyebrows frown in what looks like suspicious surprise. “NEEDED HULK.”
Chapter warnings: Whilst nothing explicitly sexual happens here, it is heavily implied and there are obvious consent issues. If you want to be spoilered, see the end notes.
They walk out into the hallway, and Steve opens the door to let him out, giving Tony a small, tired smile.
to hear it.” He steps back, amusement coloring his movements, and Tony can feel – see – the team around him again.
Clint doesn't say anything. He just straightens up in his full height, stares at his former handler, and lets the song take him over. It's almost a relief.
Of course, there was that whole thing between Cap and him, but that wasn't annoying as much as it was... sexually frustrating? Tony had stayed up many nights discussing this dilemma with his right hand; namely, what to do with the naturally-bottle-blonde, honka-dory 80-something-year old superhero he had such a massive, crumpling crush on.
Hulk finally kicks the demi-god halfway across the room, where he ends up in a miserable little heap. The former doctor Banner now turns to Phil, who's holding himself up by leaning against the podium, white as a sheet. “AGENT HURT BANNER.”
“I have somewhat of a preposition for you, Agent Barton,” Loki says and pulls his hands out of his pockets to stare down at them; not in a bashful way, more like he's imagining curling them around Clint's neck and squeezing.
“Son of a,” the Director says, and then five senior agents run over to him to provide back-up, standing on each side of Fury to offer twitchy jazz hands and wide, panicked smiles.
Luckily, Tony kept talking. “If you weren’t all dressed up already, I’ve got a couple of ideas to chill you out, but I don’t want to crumple your uniform.” He smirked and glared mischievously at Steve.
Before the parade had started, when he got the message with Tony’s location, Steve talked with one of the stewards’ supervisors, explaining his plan and asking if it was possible to get one of the regular stops in that specific position. The guy was super enthusiastic and he said he was going to do his best to make everything happen.
First of all, he needed to join the group who would be part of the parade. That wasn’t a problem. Everyone from his department knew about his love life and luckily, they were all supportive. Some of them, like Sam, became Steve’s friends, and they knew and loved Tony. The second step was a little bit more complicated, but he knew that this was not not an official police parade, so a little
“I didn’t prepare any speech. I don’t even know for how long I am allowed to stay here. But it is time to do it, I love you and I don’t want anyone else in my life but you. Anthony Edward Stark, do you want to marry me?” Steve opened the box, where a simple band with a stripe of yellow gold in the middle and two thin stripes of red gold on the sides was shining.
Even so, just before senior year, Tony thought he would lose Steve. When Steve came back from summer camp at least six inches taller than Tony and his shoulders became as broad as a swimmer’s Tony was terrified that any idiot at the school could take Steve away from him now that Steve looked like a Greek god.
“You heard me throw up my entire body weight,” Tony slightly cringed, pulling his knees to his chest. Bruce always knew how to dote on him. If not, he’d probably end up dead on the roadside if it wasn’t for him.
Next to the desk she was seated in, her friend, Clint Barton, had his book bag open. Clumsily stuffed inside of it was a bag full of homemade mint chip cookies, the concoctions a disorienting mix of brown and green with flecks of black from how burnt they were.
Inside the building, Steve stopped close to an area where a group of four was working together. Tony proceeded to do the same, eyes darting to the group. Lucky for him, Darcy was amongst them.
There was a short silence between them. Everyone wondering if Tony was actually going to go through with this.
Coulson’s voice was in a somewhat reproachful tone. He wasn’t on board with Tony’s facetious, sarcastic tone.
“And why the hell does that matter?” Fury said, practically snarling at him, “This was something important,
“I’ll try them,” Tony said, making a beckoning gesture with his hand for Clint to hand the bag towards him.
“Steve, Tony will be joining us for the rest of the year. And since your old partner abruptly left last week, we’ve decided to partner you up with him,” Coulson began, “For the week, you’ll be responsible for showing him around the construction site and assisting him since he needs to get on board with the rest of us. Is that okay with you?”
It was a pain in the ass, but he knew it would be worth it all in the end if he got accepted into UC Berkeley.
“I’ve seen the way you act around MJ. You become more jittery than usual and you’re always bringing her up whenever we talk about things that have nothing to do with her.”
“Yeah, even managed to roll a few for me,” Natasha winked. She handed one of the joints to Tony before doing the same to Clint.
“Thanks. I was adding the finishing touches to the repulsor and the whole thing went on a little bit longer than I wanted it to. I would’ve pulled an all-nighter if I didn’t pass out on my ass and wake up five minutes before this class started.”
“Don’t take it lightly. I don’t usually say stuff like this to most people.” He regained his composure in typical “Tony Stark” fashion.
“Cheers,” Tony said, extending his own blunt towards Clint’s and Natasha’s whose were also extended.
“Okay, so they look kind of bad, but that was because of the green food coloring. It only makes sense since it’s mint flavored.”
He came from a well to do family and had a good enough relationship with his parents. His father was a little impatient with his troublesome antics at school, but he let him off easy. It helped that his job kept him out of the house and often out of the country, so he didn’t have enough time to pay much attention to Tony’s little school infractions such as “showing attitude to the teacher”. His mother just full on spoiled him. That was the consequence of being a rich only child.
“What do you mean?” Tony said, wiping his palms across his lap. He was uncharacteristically nervous, yet impatient at the same time. When was he going to get to the point? He had a class to get to.
Wait, what if he “accidently” tripped over the rougher edges of the ground and got a horrible injury from that? He wouldn’t have to do this, for a while at least!
“Yeah, yeah, I figured,” He replied, before facing the other, a sloppy grin emerging on his features, “Thor, that’s a unique name. I’m surprised I haven’t seen you that often at school. Do I have your number? I think I should get your number.”
“Nick– Mr. Fury, I didn’t even–” Tony stumbled. He was completely befuddled. He had no idea principal Fury lived in his neighborhood! He knew the principal was well off, but not
Tony could see Steve in the process of zipping his backpack closed before glancing up at Coulson. Yep, he looked really confused. They must not have told him about this whole situation beforehand, especially since Tony was suddenly thrust into this project.
“You’re not getting expelled,” The principal said, folding his hands together, “Instead, you’re going spend every other Saturday in detention, 8:00 to 1:00, for the rest of the year.”
“Just ride it out. Before you know it, we’ll be graduating and spending the entire summer together. Just the four of us,” Natasha reassured, “And it’s not like your entire time is taken up by all of this.”
“You’re not the only person from this school who lives in Whitestone,” Fury spoke, the burgeoning anger slowly enveloping his voice.
“Maybe you wouldn’t need to ask if you’d make it a habit to come on time. Plus, I’d much rather prefer if you asked me.”
While Tony was reaching in to grab a cookie that wasn’t burned beyond repair, Natasha was rummaging through her backpack. Clint would cautiously peek out through the bleachers, making sure there weren’t any teachers in the near vicinity of the field.
“You sure?” Tony asked, “I mean, you don’t have to. I can just order a cleaning service. My parents won’t be home until 7:00.”
“It looks like it’s about to swallow you whole,” She giggled, exaggerating the appearance of the over-sized outfit on Tony’s fame, “So, what brings you here?”
Tony grinned to himself, getting ready for the inevitable discussion on who would be the one to drive the others to his lavish house on the night of a party he was going to throw.
The construction site looked like…well…a construction site. It was isolated behind the school, a quarter of a mile from the building to be exact. The field was vast, the soil neatly paved and the rougher edges away from the building that was being worked on. Tractors, excavators were neatly dispersed throughout as the volunteers were getting ready to continue on with their assignment for the day.
She was annoyed, alright. Well, she was always like this, except to a select few people. Gamora had a standoffish character and Tony always made it his mission to crack through that shell. Much to his dismay, Tony tried asking her out last year, only to have a splash of strawberry milk thrown at him by her sister, Nebula.
“Well, shit,” Tony sniffed himself, “You have super soldier senses or something, Captain America? I didn’t know you could smell me from all the way here.”
“Oh my god, this is classic,” Clint said, within laughing fits. He was seated and leaning over on the trunk, unable to keep it together.
“Thank goodness,” Clint added, earning a few snickers among the group. Tony slightly shoved him in jest.
He immediately hopped off his bed and ran to the bathroom. He pushed open the toilet bowl and hurled straight into it, coughing as he trembled from the sudden impact on his body.
“Okay, I’ll see you guys later,” The guidance counselor awkwardly said, after he didn’t see a change in their body language, “Make sure Tony gets a uniform!”
Natasha “Nat” Romanov was never one to be easily impressed. Her absolute disgust was very much evident on her face, her red lips twisted into a frown and eyebrows drawn together.
They were the star students, always coming to class obnoxiously early, sucking up to the teachers, and seen as model pupils of the senior class. They always acted as if they were one step ahead or even superior to the more rebellious students like Tony, Clint, and Natasha. They participated in many school clubs, played sports, had decent enough grades, and were just all-round liked by everybody. If Tony counted, Sam Wilson probably had more than six extracurriculars racked up on his school resume, just for this year alone.
She pulled out a lighter from her pocket and lit her own joint first before proceeding to light up Tony’s and Clint’s.
It was probably a huge deal for Peter to hear those words come out of Tony’s mouth. Tony felt an usually warm pang in his stomach, he didn’t throw around compliments like that cause he often became flustered from people’s reactions, however well he hid it.
Speaking of activities, he was quick to realize that many, if not most, of the school had heard about his “streaking” incident by now, being that information like that gets around quick. Much to Tony’s displeasure, there was also the abject humiliation which came along with the ordeal, especially being sober. But knowing himself, Tony would try his hardest to take it in stride if anyone brought it up.
“Take a seat,” Coulson said. Before Tony could proceed to do that, he stopped him, “Wait, I’ll need your phone.”
His four hour shift at the dealership miraculously became eight after his coworker fell ill. Why was his work was so short-staffed in the first place? He had schoolwork to get to, mountains and mountains of it. He opened the door to his apartment before flipping on the light switch. Another day, another empty house. His mother was working at the hospital for the rest of the night so he’d have the apartment to himself.
Tony forced his eyes open and sat up. He nearly doubled over from the sudden nauseous feeling in his stomach.
Steve’s attention diverted towards them, suddenly interested in the conversation, not that he would ever admit that.
“Change that to the whole city,” Tony replied, seeing Rhodey’s incredulous expression, “Word gets out fast when Howard Stark’s son is throwing a weekend party.”
Steve had shown Tony around the area, describing the general layout of the construction site, introducing Tony to some of the construction workers who aided the students, and showing the broad assortments of tools that were held in the supply closet. Much to Steve’s surprise, Tony wasn’t as flippant or even talkative. It was a stark contrast to how he was before Quentin told him off, maybe his words might gotten to him. Quentin was an asshole and Steve could barely stand him on a good day, but he was glad Tony was brought down a few notches.
After Coulson recapped the whole project to Tony, they were the last to head out of the classroom, Coulson locking the doors.
False optimism. That was not something Tony ever did. He didn’t want to unload all sorts of negativity towards Peter, though. That would make things awkward for the freshman.
His massive array of projects, inventions, quick-learning, and his excellent grades without having to apply himself into his schoolwork unlike most of his classmates, substantiated that fact. He was guaranteed to get accepted into MIT, his dream college – not only because of his family connections but his perfect ACT scores, his engineering prowess, and his high marks.
“Okay, I’m next,” Natasha said, “Tony. I dare you to do a run around the neighborhood and sing ‘Hit Me With Your Best Shot’ at the top of your lungs.”
“Just don’t injure yourself again on another one of your projects,” Bruce plainly said, eyeing his textbook. Tony often took his engineering escapades or projects rather seriously to a point where he nearly sliced his finger open with a heavy duty saw from not sleeping for a whole two days.
“Wow, the Screw Guns really do a number on my fingers,” She said, clenching and unclenching her hand. She grimaced, the soreness of her fingers not going away.
Tony immediately dismissed that thought. He wasn’t going to resort to that. His desperation didn’t go that far. Either way, Fury would find something else for him to do, probably something insanely boring.
“Bruce, you too? You haven’t even seen them yet,” Clint rolled his eyes, “Hey, I’ll make sure you guys try some after–”
Tony walked again at a normal speed after he was slightly ahead of Steve. He turned around, walking backwards instead to face the other.
“I know this is something you’re not thrilled about,” Coulson said after a short silence. He watched Tony sit over top of one of the desks, his way of getting comfortable.
Steve’s eyes darted to Tony’s footwear, a pair of red leopard print Chain Reaction sneakers, “There’s extra pairs of work boots you can try on for today. Coulson will order some new ones for you once you tell him your foot size. Same goes with the rest of the uniform.”
“I swear to god I’m going to hurl those across the field if you shove them in my face again,” Natasha said, roughly pushing Clint’s bag of cookies away.
The teacher rolled her eyes at Tony Stark’s fake, saccharine tone. She motioned for him to take a seat.
Peter said, genuinely taken aback by Tony’s sudden change of subject. He knew just who it was Tony was talking about, but he was too bashful to dive into the subject. Tony obviously couldn’t see it, but he could sense Peter’s cheeks heating up. The easily flustered nature of his was easy to predict miles away.
“Chapter 12 and 13. And we didn’t have any new homework, all we had to do was finish the study guide,” She interrupted him, her annoyed expression not going away, “I swear, this is the last time.”
The two made sure to stay a close, but safe enough distance from the others as they drilled in the walls that were aligned by the construction workers with power tools. Tony sat down, cross legged, while Steve remained standing.
After a few last words, Steve hung up. He looked down at his phone in silence, caught up in his own thoughts. He didn’t like lying to his mother, but having her constantly concern herself with his problems 24/7 wasn’t any better. She had much more important things to worry about; she didn’t need to worry about Steve slowly unraveling over the mountains of work he had ahead of him.
The loud sound of a car honk interrupted Steve mid-sentence. He unknowingly came to a stop and glanced up, seeing a 2006 red mustang convertible make a stop parallel to the curb, yards away from him. He saw a redhead at the wheel, her wavy hair reaching her shoulders. He quickly realized that was Natasha Romanov, a feisty and intimidating senior who he shared a couple of classes with, including gym. Next to her in the passenger’s seat was Clint Barton. He was your typical class clown with a crude sense of humor. He furrowed his brow, seeing the two loudly talk to each other, probably in the middle of an argument. Tony Stark’s presence, even when he was not physically there, still haunted him, in the form of his…lackeys? Just his night.
He saw Principal Fury, signature eyepatch and all, sitting at his pristine mahogany desk, as usual. But on the other side, his father, Howard, and mother, Maria, were sitting in separate chairs, probably in the middle of a long conversation with the principal before Tony knocked. This was something new, absolutely new. He had never seen them physically here. He had only ever made phone calls whenever he needed his father to vouch for him.
Tony saw a middle-aged man approach him. He recognized that to be one of the guidance counselors, Phil Coulson. He had an approachable, amicable air about him, yet he was stern when the time called for it.
He could see Bruce Banner come out from a Starbucks within the outdoor shopping center he currently stopped in, the dark-haired male not seeing him in his periphery. Bruce hopped into the backseat area of the car. To Steve, he was the most bearable out of Tony’s friend group. The kid usually kept to himself and was the opposite of insufferable.
When Steve gave him one more glance to possibly tell him to buzz off, the dark-haired boy gave him a wink before heading back to his friends.
“Just follow me,” He finally said, beginning to take quick steps. His irritation was not going away anytime soon. Tony narrowed his eyes, trying to burn a hole through Steve’s back before beginning to tail him.
Hopefully, nobody stole anything. That would be bad. Especially after he made sure to lock away any valuables and rooms that were off limits.
The building they were working on became closer in view with everyone working on it, construction workers helping the volunteers making sure they were doing things safe. Tony continued to follow Steve, making sure to stay on the bulldozed area.
“Is he really going through the whole neighborhood?” Jane asked, from the front passenger seat. She was a little more composed than the others. While she and Thor sat in the front seats, the others were seated in the trunk of the vehicle, all huddled up together.
Tony saw Natasha and Clint amongst them. Beside Natasha, sat an overexcited and bubbly brunette with a beanie and glasses. That was junior Darcy Lewis. Tony adored Darcy. On Natasha’s other side sat Virginia “Pepper” Potts, one of Tony’s exes…who he was still very friendly with. There was also another good friend of his, James Rhodes…or Rhodey, a nickname coined by his truly. They’ve known each other for a while, closely keeping in touch even though they went to different schools. Rhodey was often the voice of reason if Bruce wasn’t there to drill it into him. Pepper and Natasha were conversing with each other while Darcy was attempting to roast marshmallows on the crackling fire.
Third step, but not less important, was choosing the ring. Rhodey got the job to keep Tony away from Steve and home for a day. It didn’t take that much to coax him: Coney Island and cotton candy, exactly like when they were twelve.
Steve, once in a while, took the phone to make a video or snap a picture, the joyful vibe was helping distract himself from his anxiety, even if the small box in his pocket was there reminding what was going to happen in a couple of hours.
The Parade went on, loud and playful, on West Village narrow streets, towards the end of the route. That was the NYU area, so the number of young people and smartphones making videos and taking pictures was significantly growing.
Then Tony freed him from the hug and passed his hand over his face, in a vain attempt to dry his cheeks.
After barely ten minutes, his phone vibrated in his pocket. Steve took his iPhone from his slacks, and as he figured, it was a text from Tony.
That evening they celebrated all together at the Village and the next day their faces were everywhere on social media and YouTube, as expected.
“Sure, babe, I’m going to get ready, so I can leave too. Make me proud.” Tony hugged him and let him go.
Tony didn’t take it well at all. He was scared as hell to know his boyfriend was dealing with criminals of any kind, especially in a city like New York. He cried and begged Steve to change his mind and go back to his original plan, but Steve was too adamant; he just wanted to help people. Being useful for the community was important and he thought being a cop would be the option way for him.
“I’ll see you after class, by the way,” She said monotonously, clearly more than used to this whole type of situation at this point. Tony just grunted in affirmation.
He had applied to vast array of colleges since summer began, including his dream school, UC Berkley. Next was the vigorous work of applying to as much scholarships as he could possibly apply to. They weren’t all going to give him acceptance letters, if any, and financial aid alone could only help so much. Tacking on as many extra-curricular activities he enjoyed, keeping a good GPA, and volunteer work was the next step among many on his application journey.
Tony could hear the dispersed laughter from the others once he was done parading himself. Fuck, he was freezing. That was when he speedily made his way towards the truck, jumping onto the trunk bed. His harsh landing on the truck’s bedliner didn’t help his initial discomfort.
Tony did an obnoxious wolf whistle, the weed in his system knocking out all inhibition. That immediately caught their attention.
If it wasn’t clear by now, Steve Rogers had a low opinion of Tony. He thought the kid was obnoxious, loud, entitled, and even arrogant at times. Being the son of a businessman and scientist with a multimillion-dollar net worth clearly did him no favors in that regard. People like him thought they were gods gift to the world because they were raised to believe so. People like Tony did not care about the consequences of their troublesome antics because their parents would scoff them off and everything for them would go back to normal. Steve was
Steve heard an obnoxious car screeching sound. His eyes quickly darted back to the road and noticed that Natasha’s car just drove off.
“I guess everyone’s weekends were great,” Coulson began, “I’ve never seen you guys so talkative before.”
The four had found a relatively hidden location behind the bleachers of the football field. This was where they would sometimes congregate and do...whatever recreational activities that weren’t so school friendly, such as...
Some of the others weren’t in such great shape either. Even the less outgoing Wanda had her fair share of alcohol. Natasha leant towards Clint, her hand lightly gripping his shoulder. They watched as Tony attempted to balance on a thin ledge, his arms outstretched. The dark-haired boy slightly tipped over before completely losing his balance. Before he could completely fall over to the ground, he felt two arms grab him on either side.
Tony sat up as well while Natasha remained lying on the ground, her hand now blocking her face. Bruce was at a far corner, meticulously writing down notes from his calculus textbook. He wrinkled his nose at the foul weed stench, hoping to god he didn’t smell like it.
“Then it wouldn’t hurt to try,” Tony said, “Maybe you guys could go as friends and then continue on from there, maybe start asking her to hang out, just the two of you. If it’s meant to happen, then it will happen.”
“Sit down, Stark,” Fury said, in his deep, intimidating voice. God, was he always so uptight and unsmiling?
Tony followed Steve inside a shed. Inside of it was dimly lit, extra supplies and uniforms lying around.
“When did you guys get here?” Tony asked, utterly confused. For Christ sake, wasn’t his dad supposed to be at the office today? And his mom was supposed to have an early doctor’s appointment. Before anyone could answer, he quickly took in both of their expressions. His mother had her arms crossed, her stare glued to her lap. Her lips were frozen in a downturned slope. His normally vivacious mom never looked like this. His father had a barely restrained anger, his tight expression speaking volumes. He was absolutely still, trying his damned hardest not to lash out at his son.
Peter Parker immediately took a liking to Tony, the moment they met one day in detention. Well, Peter was volunteering to clean up the storage room next door and organize a few things in the room Tony was staying in at the time. He was a nerdy, at times coy, freshman who shared Tony’s interest in engineering and physics. Tony remembered fondly rolling his eyes when Peter once had said, “you’re like an older and much cooler version of me”. He had a protective streak towards the kid even if he did annoy him at times.
He stepped outside, using one of the backdoors to enter the expansive outdoor living space. Next to it was the spacious back lawn. His eyes lit up and he grinned, seeing some of his fellow friends surrounding the giant bonfire he had help set up with them earlier.
“I’m just complimenting you, no ulterior motives,” He replied, he sat up from relaxed position, “I just missed this class last Friday and I wanna know what chapters you guys went over.”
“We’ll be watching them for now and then I’ll show you around the place. After Coulson comes back, he’ll tell us what we do next,” Steve said, crossing his arms.
“I’m not stalking you, if that’s what you’re thinking,” Tony retorted, ignoring the other’s cold tone. He wasn’t going to let himself get intimidated, in any way shape or form, by Steve fucking Rogers. He’d play it cool instead, maybe he could entertain himself at his expense. It was the least he could do, to keep himself from going crazy in this project he was forced to do.
“Fuuuuck,” Tony groaned, repeatedly slamming his head on his locker. He ignored the weird stares he was receiving from passersby. His anger was more important. Right now, he would have been on his way home to coop himself up in his lab, his classic rock playlist blasting on the highest volume while he created updates on the rocket-like thrusters he started on a few weeks ago. Instead, he was going to do, with very much reluctance, manual labor for free.
Before Tony could reach into his backpack and grab his notebook and other supplies, the familiar scratching noise of the outdated-looking front speaker put a stop to the chatter among the students.
“If you really want to know why I’m here, I’ll tell you,” Tony exclaimed, sprinting up to the taller male to catch up, “I mean, I thought you’d already know, it’s common knowledge around the school, by now, at least.”
Clint groaned, letting out a disgusted grimace. His friend always had to make passes at any walking specimen he deemed attractive. If not, he’d make some lewd comment having to do with how attractive they were.
“I’m not letting you pay for anything college related,” Steve said, “If it doesn’t completely work out, I can always take out some loans.”
“Careful, Tony. You can barely walk,” Jane said. She had consumed some of the vodka as well, but she was nowhere near as intoxicated as Tony was.
After what was possibly the most humiliating ordeal Tony has ever dealt with in recent times, he was able to make it to his second period class of the day as each class spanned 45 minutes on Mondays. Before leaving to class and begrudgingly telling his friends about what went down, he had his parents pull him aside in the office. The long-winded lecture he got from his father and the disappointed words his mother threw at him was just…crushing. It preemptively set him in a grouchy mood.
Tony momentarily frowned, but quickly remembered that was probably for the detention he skipped. He could explain himself and call his father, as planned. He was good at that.
Right at 3:59, Tony entered the room, his heavy steps catching just a couple of the students’ attentions. He did a once-over of the people in the room, a lot of them enthusiastically chatting amongst each other as they were clearly acquainted with each other through this volunteering opportunity. The desks were arranged in a circular formation, creating an open, collaborative environment. As expected, he saw Steve Rogers sitting in one of them. He wasn’t aware of Tony’s presence as he was busy speaking to the person who sat next to him.
He did a once-over of the rest of the people who sat amongst the bonfire – Darcy’s best friend Jane Foster, foreign exchange student Thor Odinson, and a Sophomore girl who went by the name Wanda Maxi-something.
He was supposed to meet everyone else at room B4 of the school building before they were to head outside to do the actual project. Tony briskly walked from his locker before continuing on with a sprint. He couldn’t be late.
Tony then reminded himself. He had to make the best of this situation. It wouldn’t be of use for him to be a constant ball of negativity. He would be doing himself a favor if he remained his normally charming, outgoing self.
Steve opened his fridge, eyeing the compartments up and down. He sorted through the sparse amounts of condiments and drinks to check for any discernable leftovers. Unfortunately, there weren’t any. They must have eaten the last of it yesterday. Fuck, he should have bought takeout or something when he was coming home.
Tony quickly glanced towards the front of the classroom, seeing Coulson clap his hands together to get everyone else’s attention. He looked back at Darcy who was itching for an answer. Now, she looked kind of perplexed, rightfully so. Why would Tony Stark willingly volunteer for a long-term school project like this?
Tony kept up his running, sometimes skipping as the harsh, cool air hit him. His singing was off-key, screechy, and loud enough for the others to hear clearly from the vehicle.
Plus, he had his three best friends alongside him. Ever since they met in the sixth grade, Tony, Clint, Natasha, and Bruce were inseparable. They had distinct, sometimes clashing personalities, but they somehow made it work. They were always there for each other whenever each of them went through something such as Tony losing his former butler and family friend, Jarvis; Clint losing his mother; Bruce and his heartbreak with Betty Ross; and Natasha being separated from her two sisters due to her parents’ very messy divorce.
“You’d rather he expel you?” Howard angrily interrupted, “You are so lucky we did this for you, Tony. Most people don’t have it as easy.”
“You’ll be helping a team of other students and construction workers build a daycare center for the school. Don’t worry too much, the volunteers are more than happy to teach you the rounds as you’ll be working closely with some of them too,” Fury answered, Tony could practically sense the condescending sound to his voice, “Oh, and you’ll actually be reporting to your first day of work after school today. They desperately need an extra pair of hands since there’s such a small amount of volunteers working right now. You know Steve Rogers, right?”
“Clint,” Natasha says and grips him by the shoulders; pulls him in, tucks his head underneath her chin so he can feel her heartbeat, and he's maybe crying, he doesn't know, but he's also still singing.
Tony Stark did not pine. He was well-versed in wanting things he couldn't have. He shut up about it; he buried it; he 'dealt' with it.
” Loki continues, and Clint snorts. He's surprised the song lets him, or Loki lets him – it's pretty clear he's well in control of his own song, unlike the 'puny humans.' “
So Tony lived with the Avengers and participated in all the team-building exercises without too much nagging. He played Fury's lapdog and saved the world a few times, with and without back-up. He poked fun at Bruce and taught the Big Guy how to high-five someone without knocking them senseless; he tried (and failed) to pick up Mjølnir; he started a prank war with Clint; he didn't try to ask Natasha out a single time
“Well,” Bruce says when the team is alone in the room – the senior agents having scuttled out after their boss – and sighs. “That's at least one good secret to have been revealed.”
Become my partner in crime?” He grins, a shard of insanity shining through again. Clint doesn't think there is a single part of this song that will be an 'honest' proposal; mostly, it seems like Loki's just doing this because he likes singing. (And maybe because Clint finds it really fucking unnerving.)
“I assume you are referring to the earlier... conversation with Captain Rogers,” JARVIS says. He sounds sympathetic, which doesn't surprise Tony. He's known for a long time that his AI displays some form of emotions, even if he doesn't process them like a human would.
Natasha's eyebrows barely move, but they do draw in a fraction. “Something's wrong. Clint roams the streets or hides; that's how he reacts when he needs space. But he doesn't leave. Not without letting anyone know.”
” Clint sings, and curses the fact that this is yet another secret that Loki's making him spill; the fear he can quash down but not put out entirely, “
“I'm off, big guy, before I have to sing an aria about your luscious hair,” Tony says and pats Thor's shoulder as he leaves the room.
“Apparently the rest of the guys have been knocking on my doghouse door. Anything go down at HQ?” Tony dumps down on a chair on the opposite side of the table.
And an arm sliding around his waist and a second hand on his shoulder, holding him and Tony can't breathe, can't stay upright, can't open his eyes, can't
“Steve is destroying the rest of his punching bags; Thor and Bruce are having angry, loud sex in their room.” Natasha's eyes harden as she stares at a sleek, black Triumph Truxton. “I don't know where Clint is. He left Ph- Coulson's room before the rest of us got there.” It's the slip-up, more than anything else, that really lets Tony know how fucking
” And Steve takes a breath and something settles in his shoulders, relaxes, even as his cheeks heat up further.
Even I must sing and rhyme,” and he does a graceful little hop before spinning around once, easy as nothing.
With a wave of his hand, Loki keeps beat as the instrumental piece concludes. Tony can only be glad that none of them are singing right now, even if he can still feel himself wilting, the music feeding on his energy. For the first time, Tony realizes it was a really bad idea for them to come here. It would just suck if Tony died while fucking
too far. “It's all very showy,” Steve continues. “Singing, dancing; big, orchestrated numbers and people spilling their darkest secrets. Aside from the melodramatic factor, which we both know Loki loves like nothing else-” and he glances over at Tony, who nods in agreement, “it's also mind-control, isn't it? I mean, we don't
,” Thor adds, and they hear Tony over the comm – though somehow, Steve knows that the song didn't let Tony hear his verse. He doesn't know why.
They keep singing those two separate sentences together, Phil's words turning more and more pleading and Clint's only growing harder, until he's panting and quiet and the music's calming down, and Phil whispers “
“Yes, much better. I almost thought-” and then he stops mid-sentence, getting this strange and constipated look, before he closes the door. Tony can't hear any instruments yet, but somehow he just
“Then sure, let him in.” Tony pushes down the flutter of nervous fear and shuffles his feet instead. He's managed to keep JARVIS's body a secret from the rest of the Avengers, even Phil, and if there's somebody Tony could bribe with naughty things to keep from tattling to Fury, it would be Steve, but...
Now, he's tumbling through the vent and landing on his feet on the linoleum floor, less graceful than usual because of the anger coursing through his whole body. He straightens and lets his eyes skim the room, making sure he's alone – well, alone with the dead man lying in the hospital bed only a few feet away, that is.
Tony leaves DUM-E down in the workshop and makes his way to the Avengers' common room, steeling himself for the fact that he's going to have to look Cap in the face. Luckily for, well, everyone, probably, Steve isn't the one sitting in the kitchen, reading a biking magazine. It's Natasha.
“I am waiting for your little friends to show up. I'm certain they have ways to track the amusing object in your pocket.”
Chapter warnings: There are some non-consensual vibes going on here between Clint and his captor, although nothing explicitly sexual.
” He grins, but it's a smile devoid of humor; like the rest of them, Tony's thinking about what other things they could be spilling to each other in a fit of sudden musicality. “
), made with the virgin jokes, with the leers, made with the shit-eating grins and borderline-asshole comments there was nothing borderline about at all.
,” Tony bites out and hugs DUM-E closer. He can't stop thinking about Steve's resigned look as he sang; can't stop thinking about all the countless times Tony's poked fun at him like he does with everyone, really (
!” And it's awful, the falsely cheerful tone to his singing now, especially when it's followed by what can't be anything but a plea: “
“I would have to agree with you, Steven,” he says and hangs his head low. “My brother would find this highly amusing; it is a fine 'prank', as you call it – one that is not so deadly as some of his earlier attempts on Earth, but no less harmful.” His gaze flickers to Bruce, who just puts a hand on the Asgardian's neck and buries it in the long, untamed locks of blond hair that falls down Thor's back.
“I'm pretty certain it wouldn't be,” Bruce says, but he can't quite stop smiling at the mental image of the Other Guy in a white suit and top hat, gargling 'Singin' In the Rain'. A quiet, but insistent rumble in the back of his mind lets him know that the Other Guy doesn't appreciate that thought at all. Bruce chuckles.
All the little things,” Tony sings and feels his cheeks heat up; maybe it's just as well he's about to keel over, now that his team knows he's a fucking closet romantic.
Clint closes his eyes against the music, muttering to himself though he knows Loki's still standing right by, smirking. “
“Thank you very much, Captain,” JARVIS replies and smiles. That seems to reassure Steve of – well, something.
“I sang a glorious ode to Anthony's toaster machine and Bruce's posterior!” Thor says. Bruce hides his face.
“Or that.” Clint picks at the seat of his chair and listens to Phil's calm breathing. He can see Tony stare at him out of the corner of his eye, but knows that the genius isn't really looking. Not at him, anyway. More staring with empty eyes at Clint and wondering where Captain Ameriboy is hiding.
” Steve sings cheerfully, his body doing its own thing and ignoring the part of Steve's brain that must be reeling. Tony would find it hilarious, except this is all really mind-controlly, and Tony doesn't wish that shit on anyone, least of all poster-boy.
” The guitar strums a few last, melancholy tones, and the music dies away. Clint doesn't move; his whole body burns with everything he just spilled to Natasha, just like when Loki asked him – asked
“Of course not, Sir. You make an excellent point.” JARVIS sounds indulgent, maybe even amused, and Tony grins. After a minute of silence: “... thank you, Sir.”
Tony actually blinks at that. “I thought you were all for the singing, big guy. Arias and epic ballads, isn't that your thing?”
, if only in the form of a glare, an eye-roll, or an exasperated sigh. After a while, Tony even introduced the guy to dirty jokes, because this century was full of them and someone should make the guy aware of the dangers out there. Or something.
” Clint sighs and isn't sure if it's part of the routine, or a small part of himself coming through. This feels too goddamn much like the Tesseract all over again – mind control, making him do things he doesn't want to do and say things he
” sings Natasha, eyes bright and possibly the closest to surprised the rest of them have seen her, “
“It wouldn't have helped.” Clint isn't aware that he'd spoken until the sentence is finished. Tony doesn't say anything, just turns his head to look at him. “You don't stop –
The music dies away and Tony can suddenly breathe again; he's still coughing blood, still can't stand or even keep his eyes open any longer, but he gulps down a breath and thinks that maybe both of his lungs aren't goners after all. “Steve,” he whispers, and then he's down for the count.
It doesn't matter. He felt the trigger, hears the starting chord, and his mouth opens. “Love?” he says, hoarsely, and looks over at Steve. Steve looks pale, the muscles in his arms bunching as he tries to move. Words bubble up Tony's throat without his consent.
Phil pulls on a robe; doesn't bother to pull on proper clothes. It's past four in the morning, which is Tony's prime-time for new, ridiculous inventions. He's become better at sleeping after Steve began spending the nights in his apartment, but Phil knows Tony still spends most nights tinkering in his workshop.
” Tony whispers, his tongue burning with the words he's saying. Fuck. This all – fuck. Natasha's eyes widen a micro-fraction.
” and when Tony somehow manages to crack his lids open, Steve's smiling at him, so sad and so certain and so fucking beautiful.
“Barton,” Fury begins, but Clint doesn't give him the opportunity to back-pedal. He walks over to the director, clocks him in the jaw, and then stomps out of the room. It was a telegraph; Clint's shoulder dropped before he landed the punch, giving Fury plenty of time to block it. It fills Steve with a sense of satisfaction that the man didn't – that he understands that a punch in the face is the
“Fury sang and everything. And I met Coulson.” Natasha flips another page; another silent exclamation point.
“But, you know, by all means,” Clint says and does an inviting gesture with his wrist – it doesn't really work the same way when his arms are strapped down. “Go ahead. It'll be fun to see the guys pound on you again. I could use a good laugh right about now.” And if that last part is bitter, so fucking sue him.
Clint has to look at him for a moment before he connects the lines; remembers how calling his best friend Natasha – not even 'Nat' or 'Tasha' – is a privelige. One that she seems to have revoked for the time being.
“Thank you,” Loki says when the number's over, looking over each and every one of them as they gasp for breath. Even Natasha staggers a little, her jaw tight as she tries not to show any weakness.  It almost makes Tony feel guilty to see her unsteady on her feet; like he's peeking through a peep hole into a secret room.
“You believe my hair is luscious?” Thor asks, smiling, but Tony just goes down to his workshop with a bottle of cognac under his arm.
“Ah, the beast,” Loki says, smirking, and waves his hand. As the demi-god turns to the Hulk and Hulk pounds his fists into the concrete below, Clint hears – then sees – Phil dance into his vision, the quiet background music a distinct salsa. Phil dances like he does everything else; with great attention to detail and great concentration. It would be hilarious, except Clint can see the color draining out of Phil's face as he moves, sweat beading on the handler's upper lip and forehead.
” all five of them sing; Tony's voice tinny through the comm but clear all the same. Steve feels inexplicably drained. “
“Right,” Bruce says, looking a little uncomfortable, like he always does when he's reminded that JARVIS has the intelligence to become SkyNet or GLADOS – except he never will, because Tony made him way too awesome for that.
, this he's kept, and he needs – needs to keep keeping this to himself. There are no more secrets Clint has alone, not after Loki, but there is at least one big secret that his team and his best friend don't know. Clint needs it to remain that way.
“I'd go a step further, even,” Tony says and thinks about his friends upstairs. “It almost seems like the more secrets we have, at least in regards to a person or, I don't know, several – the more likely it is that the music starts and makes us spill to that person.”
Tony suspected it had something to do with Howard and all the endless tales of Steve Rogers; how Howard had looked when he'd talked about his past friend. Eyes all bright and shiny, hands gesticulating, smile toothy and genuine; he looked
As soon as the music dies down – as soon as Tony has his body under his own control again – he's up and running. Fucking
“Stay in the background,” she says, nearly snaps. Clint would kill her (no, he wouldn't) if she let Coulson put himself in danger on her watch. “You're not there to fight, sir.”
Tony coughs out a bark of laughter, and immediately winces from the effort to his damaged lung. “Avoiding me, then.”
“You think he's the one behind this?” Fury says, but doesn't sound surprised. Then again, Fury never does.
handed to you that you were barely conscious for most of the battle.” Clint snorts. “So when that doesn't work, your immediate plan is to go against us
” Steve sings, bouncing to his feet, before he sees Bruce's lips purse and Thor's face fall. Only then does he falter and add, still with the music, “
“Coulson's fine,” Clint says gruffly, trying for an authoritative tone and not quite succeeding. He's not holding Phil's hand, as much as he wants to, and he doesn't think he's looking overly bulldog-like where he perches between the two beds. Even so, Tony's a smart guy, and Clint's not taking any chances. He's already sung his feelings to Nat and Phil
“It's just – it's his M.O., isn't it?” Steve asks, though it sounds rhetorical so Tony keeps his mouth shut not to make him upset again. He doesn't like it when Steve's upset. Flustered? Hell yeah, that's hilarious. But not that pinched I-miss-the-forties look he sometimes gets when Tony might take his
, Clint says without being able to open his mouth. He settles for glaring daggers at the demi-god instead.
“Let us hear your song, cretin,” Loki snipes at Hulk, who's looking around, but not actually smashing up the place or Phil yet. Clint doesn't know if that's a good thing – better control – or if it just means that the Hulk's as under Loki's control as everyone else here. “Sing for us.”
Natasha takes the elevator to Rogers' level, but stops in the hallway leading up to the front door of his apartment. She flips out her phone.
And suddenly Clint's right there, by the side of the bed, and they're shouting in each other's faces and Clint knows it's only the magic that's kept nurses and doctors from throwing him the fuck out of this room already. “
When Tony sneaks up in the living room the next morning, he hopes it will be vacant, but of course he's not that lucky. Instead of doubling back down, though, Tony halts when he sees that Bruce and Thor are both up, each sitting by their own end of the kitchen table, not saying a word. They look... forlorn.
material,” Tony says. “I'm Tony Stark, I'm a walking train wreck of issues and future harassment lawsuits. And Steve's...”
anything, though, just stands a few feet from Clint's chair, hands in the pockets of his jeans like he's trying to seem more human than he is.
“Yikes,” Tony says because really, what else is he supposed to say to that? And he really didn't know the two of them were at the L-word phase already, because it's been, what, four months since they started getting together? Tony needs to work on his people-reading skills.
“Steve. He still sang at you. And you know none of us could lie while we were singing – I know I couldn't.”
“Steve, seriously! In front of J?” But Steve is kind of ridiculously strong and even more ridiculously soft and warm and comfortable, so in the end, Tony's heart isn't really in it. He ends up slumping more against Steve's frame instead, and the super soldier makes a happy not-quite-noise in the back of his throat and worms his arms around Tony's waist.
Damn. “Well, love-birds, I'm off,” he says and pushes off the counter, taking his coffee cup with him. It'll give him something to do with his hands. He hates fidgeters and he hates that he turns into one when he's out of his depth. “A piece of advice,” Tony says to the two wistful men still holding the other's hand. “Sex solves a lot. Like, a
“Oh, come on, J. Have some appreciation for the classics!” Tony bounces on the balls of his feet and goes back to nitpicking the finer joints, making sure everything is as it should be. It looks perfect.
“Here, you's... you's gone, you,” Clint slurs and jolts upright, looking around. It only takes him a second to remember the where, the how, the what, the who, and he sighs and slumps back down. “Still here,” he whispers and curls up against Phil's side. “You're still here.”
” He looks around, and Thor and Bruce are both frowning at him, Bruce especially looking sympathetic. Natasha doesn't even turn around, just steers the jet.
“Not for much longer, Agent Barton,” Loki murmurs. “Unless you prefer I take one of your team mates, of course?” His eyes glint.
Bruce huffs a laugh and buttons up his shirt, an old, ugly one in case the Other Guy decides to make an appearance. “ 'Foreboding.' Yes, that word fits nicely.”
“Just -” Steve looks pinched, his mouth a straight, thin line, before he lets out a breath and nods. It looks like it's physically difficult for him to do it, and Tony's confused, but hey, the Captain's an enigma. “Okay. I didn't want to say this with Thor or Bruce in the room, because I know it wouldn't go over very well – but I think Loki's our culprit.”
” Steve sings, wrapping his arms around himself now, looking naked and so terribly vulnerable in the middle of his living room. “
Tony grins back. “So, this went better than I thought.” He doesn't recognize the jinx for what it is until Steve huffs a relieved laugh and nods.
“I've been a bad dad, Dum-Dum,” Tony whispers, and DUM-E whirs in disagreement. His robotic 'fingers' close around Tony's wrist and squeeze, more gently than Tony thought DUM-E could, and he wonders idly if JARVIS has been teaching his kid tricks. Whatever the reason, it helps warm up the ice-cold pit of guilt in his stomach.
“So,” Bruce groans out after a little while, slumped against Thor's side. “I think the singing might come with a side effect.”
“Very well, sir,” JARVIS replies and is too damn polite to point out how Tony's voice is trembling. Tony hears the tell-tale clicks that lets him know that he's alone here now, nobody can get in, none except JARVIS, and that's okay because JARVIS is different.
Steve's eyes are shiny and his face red; Tony turns to face the podium again, Loki avidly watching him. “
“Trouble in paradise?” Tony asks as he enters, because at least people are used to him being an asshole. It will give them some... normalcy, or something, with this whole fucked-up situation.
“After remaining in that most recent position for approximately four point five minutes, Agent Barton left – judging by his speed, I can assume by car.”
“Of course,” Steve says and puts a hand on Clint's shoulder. “You should get some sleep, too, while you're at it – I've had a couple of hours of shut-eye, and you look about ready to pass out.”
He doesn't answer. Can't. Just stays where he is, where they are, just the two of them now. Just the two of them left.
want to find out, it's like this. Tony wants to apologize, but the song won't let him; it glues his lips together, and he gets it. He's not supposed to talk, not now. He's here to
“Sir, Captain Rogers is asking for permission to enter the workshop,” JARVIS says after a while and pulls back. He tilts his head towards the door.
There's a knock on the door, before Steve pokes his blonde head in. His hair's in that disarray that means he hasn't been sleeping in a bed for a good, long while, but it also kind of makes him look like an underwear model.
“I knew he wouldn't be harmed,” Phil says, breathless now, and presses his hand gingerly against his chest. His color's faded even more, to a light gray. “He told your team that bullets couldn't harm him. I knew you would protect him when you took over.”
“Are you sure about that, sir?” Bruce asks, in a carefully guarded voice, and Steve's glad he's not the only suspicious one in their group. “It's not because you have something to hide from us, is it?”
“Yes, and I'm sorry about that,” Phil says and smiles at the creature. “But Loki had him under the curse's control, and we really needed your help, Mister Hulk.”
He roams the streets instead, not caring where his feet lead him, a decision he regrets when he looks up from his own darkened thoughts to see Stark Tower right in front of him. “Goddammit,” he mutters to himself and doesn't go inside. Not yet. Instead he stays on the nearest street corner, where he can still see the Tower but anyone looking out the windows can't see him. He slouches against the window of a closed café, watching the blinking blue-white lights on the espresso machine inside and generally feeling sorry for himself.
He definitely managed to surprise Tony and even more extraordinarily he managed to leave him speechless. That was the best day of his life, or, at least, for the moment because there was a wedding in the near future.
Time was flying by and his agitation was coming back. After a couple of hours he slipped away his phone from his pocket to text Tony again.
“It’s a beautiful summer day and it is Pride, for sure someone will come with way less clothing than me.”
Shortly afterwards, the parade began to move slowly. Loud music started coming from all over the place and even the crowd on the sides became louder and more cheerful.
“You know that ass is mine, as is all the rest. I could be jealous thinking of you in your pants among all those pretty boys,” Steve said in all his seriousness, even if he couldn’t hide a smile.
There were volunteers or other participants going around shooting glitter and confetti. Steve got a small rainbow made by a body crayon on his cheek and he was pretty sure he was going to find glitter for days on his body, even in parts where no one is supposed to have glitter.
shouldn’t cause too many problems. In fact, Chief Fury assured him that the organization would not hinder him, on the contrary, they had all praised the idea. It would make the day a bit more special party to those who would attend the proposal.
But then, there was a memo from NYPD: they would give the opportunity to their officers to attend the next Pride Parade representing the station, and Steve’s began to plot.
As expected, Steve had chosen something very simple: a smooth band in white gold with his name and the sentence “It was worth it” engraved on the inside. He had to hide the small box among his uniforms, the only place where his nosy boyfriend wouldn’t get his hands on it.
“I know it’s important: the uniform, your first time, and all those things you have in that beautiful  mind of yours,” Tony sighed. “But you don’t have to make it bigger than necessary. Relax, have fun, and enjoy your afternoon, possibly without looking too much at other boys,” he laughed.
“C’mon, Steve, it’s just a parade. There’s no reason to be so nervous.” Tony tried to calm him down, smoothing down his uniform tie and shirt. “Just pretend it’s one of your Police parades and not the Pride.”
As the group took Christopher Street, Steve’s heart started pounding heavily in his chest and when he could start seeing the Gay Street rainbow pole. For an instant, he thought his chest was going to explode.
Then Tony disappeared in a big nice rainbow mess, but Steve knew he would find him at the end of the parade waiting for him with open arms and with his new, precious ring on his finger.
The hat that was part of his uniform was just under his nose, laying on the small table next to the mirror. Tony handed it to him, smiling fondly.
Out of the corner of his eye, Steve saw that all smartphones were pointed at him and the lump in his throat seemed impossible to swallow. He inhaled once again and with his free hand took the small box from his jacket.
The thought of proposing in front of the whole city was making him nervous. His throat went dry when Pepper warned him that if anyone filmed the scene with a smartphone, there would be a chance for it to go  viral. It might be embarrassing, but at the same time he thought that the gesture could set an example to all those who were too scared to come out. Steve always had the spirit and the willingness to do the right thing and help the others, even in situations so personal like this one. So, he decided. That was the best way to ask Tony to marry him.
After a couple of minutes that for Steve felt like an eternity and an instant at the same time, he was called to go back to his group to go on with the parade.
But, that last year of school was like turning on the light for both of them. It was the year for (almost) all their first times, and everyone would have bet on them having a life-long relationship, despite their young age.
Steve’s hand, intertwined with Tony’s was shaking. Tony’s face was unreadable, it was like he knew what was happening but he was thinking he was dreaming.
“You, sir, you are not going to come at the parade in your pants, are you?” Steve asked, pulling away and looking at him head to toe.
Volunteer stewards had started to give directions for groups’ positions. Sidewalks were already full of smiling and colorful people who were cheering and shouting their support to the parade attendees.
Steve shrugged. “It’s doing it in front of everyone that’s making me nervous. Maybe I should have chosen a more
Once he was there, Steve hugged and kissed Tony earning screams and cheers from all the people around.
Yeah, Steve was definitely nervous, and that small box hidden in his jacket felt like it was  burning his skin through the fabric.
When Steve recognized Tony among the colorful chaos, and he nodded to the supervisor who orchestrated the stop and Steve took off from his group to approach Tony.
Tony had his mouth hanging open and for a short moment he started looking around him, everyone was staring at him, full of hope. Then, he turned back to Steve and he didn’t have any other choices to say. “Yes, I do.” The reaction from everyone was screams of joy and wild clapping.
Things got a little bit complicated after college, when Steve decided to enroll into the Police Academy, instead of going on with art.
“Steve Grant Rogers. It’s-just-a-parade.” Tony said  reassuringly. He couldn’t bear to see his boyfriend in this state and Steve knew it.
Then Tony pulled Steve’s arm to make him stand and pushed him to crash against himself, kissing him while the other one was trying to put back the box in his pocket. Tony was still peppering his face with kisses and his face was a river of tears of joy.
He approached Tony and kissed him lightly on his lips. “Text me when you arrive at the parade and let me know which point of the route will you be on. I want to say hello.” Steve didn’t want to miss him for any reason.
proposal.” Steve laughed nervously. “Perks of having a partner who very rarely gets surprised.” Thinking of Tony, Steve laughed a little bit more and relaxed; he couldn’t wait to see Tony’s face.
Steve and Tony had known each other for about half of their lives. They went to the same high school and their first encounter was a fist fight. It was back when Steve was still shorter than Tony and he was so skinny that he looked like he was going to break any minute. But Steve was as stubborn as a mule, and Tony was an arrogant brat. They got over the fight, and slowly, they became inseparable. Soon they had an unbreakable bond with one another.
Suddenly, there was silence around them. Everyone started figuring out what was happening and they stopped cheering or talking, and soon there was just the music from the floats as a background noise.
Steve, on the other hand, took two very personal consultants with him to the jeweler: Pepper and Natasha. He wasn’t going to look for something too tacky or excessive, like with gems or anything, but he needed moral support on the choosing. Bucky, his best friend, categorically refused to go with him with the excuse: “If it was for me, one of those candy rings would be enough.” Steve didn’t mention the stink eye Natasha gave Bucky.
“And remember, I will be there cheering for you. Let’s pretend it’s just me and you.” Tony slapped his ass. “You are perfect.”
This started one of the worst fights right before they were to move in together; the flat was ready for them, but Tony ended up getting massively drunk. Pepper and Rhodey, Tony’s best friends, had to step in to sort out the issue. Eventually, Steve and Tony had a mature conversation. Steve tried to be more clear about the reasons why he had chosen to enlist in the police force and to show Tony how much he cared about the career, and Tony finally understood and accepted it.
Tony pulled him one last time to kiss him, with his face between hands as he whispered. “I love you.”
It was a beautiful day. He just didn’t want to sweat too much in his uniform. But seeing his colleagues calmed him down. Sam passed by to say hello and check on him. Of course, Wilson wouldn’t attend the parade, but he wanted to support his friend.
“I'm fine, Dum-Dum,” Tony lies and lets himself slide down onto the floor, reaching forward to rub DUM-E's head, like he would do a pet. Except DUM-E's not a pet, he's – he's Tony's baby, closest he's got to one, and DUM-E whirs closer now, chirp-beeping in contentment at his daddy's attention.
” he sings, smiling even though he feels like screaming in rage, wants to claw at his mouth until it stops spouting all these ridiculous thoughts in front of everyone and his enemy and
“I'm aware, Barton. And I am sorry. I was under strict orders – and in a coma – for most of that time.”
Thor lumbers over to cup Bruce's jaw, leaning down to press their lips together. Chaste, for him. Gentle, like Bruce is as fragile as he looks. “I am sure we shall be fierce warriors still, even whilst carolling.” His eyes twinkle with mirth.
” Tony sings, even his voice trembling with fatigue now, and he keeps messing up his steps, stumbling over his feet, barely keeping upright, and still fucking
“If you wanna smother me with a pillow, Barton, I'm not gonna call for a nurse,” Tony continues, his voice a low mutter now. Against the pallid shade of his face, his reddening cheeks are even more pronounced, and Clint chuckles.
“Good. If you feel a tune coming on, please go offline until it passes,” Tony mutters and uncorks his bottle, taking a few (un)healthy swigs.
Clint watches him, oddly pensive now that the focus isn't on him (and Phil) anymore. “So what's with you longingly staring then?”
Tony's heard a lot of rumors about Natasha – about the Black Widow – and since she moved into his Tower and he's become less twitchy around her, Tony's realized that those rumors are at least 90% true. He's never, until now, known whether she's actually been a prima ballerina or if she just loves Tchaikovsky. Now he does. Well, maybe not the prima ballerina part, but Natasha moves far too gracefully and confidently to be an amateur. Tony's reminded of a ballet Pepper dragged him to a couple of years ago, pre-Afghanistan. Tony was pretty drunk at the time, but he thinks it was Swan Lake, because he remembers two swans and the prince (with the giant package – what? Tony has priorities). Natasha is definitely the Black Swan.
“Please tell me you're immune, JARVIS,” he says as he steps into his inner chamber, last night's song about Steve still echoing in the back of his head. “If you start singing about safety protocols, I just might shoot myself.”
” and he doesn't know if he's talking about Loki or Phil anymore, but in a fucked-up way, he thinks it's about both of them. “
Loki's using his life energy to fuel the magic he'll use to turn Clint back into a mind-controlled assassin. It's a lovely thought.
“HULK NO SING,” Hulk growls and pounds his fist against the floor again for emphasis, the whole place rattling with the force of it. Phil and the team stumble at the mini-earthquake. “HULK HATE SINGING.”
“Not a word. I don't think they actually know what they're doing,” Bruce says, and it doesn't sound like a judgment.
Tony sits up. “Go on.” He's been thinking the same thing, actually; this whole thing stinks of the Asgardian. Loki's still on Earth somewhere, stripped of his powers, undergoing 'rehabilitation' (Fury even used the bunny-ear movements when he said it). But Thor always gets that wounded look whenever any of them hint that Loki might not be as rehabilitated as Thor thinks, and Bruce is morally obligated to take Thor's side these days, so yeah. Probably best to keep this a two-man discussion for now. Maybe they can tell Clint and Natasha later.
“I have,” Loki says, and at least his voice is the same: slippery, eerie, with that same holier-than-thou mocking undertone to it that always makes Clint want to punch the guy in the face.
Tony twirls slowly, not missing Natasha's blank-hard look that he's learning to understand means that she's frantically trying to find a way out of a fucked up situation. Doesn't matter; the music's changing up again, and Tony's gasp-singing and dancing and he just, he can't get enough breath, his chest tight and his limbs so heavy with exertion.
Clint's strapped to a metal chair on a podium on the other end of the room, the warehouse looking like one of those places that turn into random rave parties every other Tuesday; flecks of liquid and oil on the floor, corrugated iron walls, and lone light bulbs hanging from the ceiling by their cords. Clint's face is pinched, and he looks haggard. He seems equal parts worried about his team, annoyed, and impressed by their dancing.
… With no heart.” He swallows, tastes blood and feels a small trickle run down the corner of his mouth. It feels like the Hulk's squeezing his chest, his breath rasping, and he's vaguely surprised that you can sing yourself into a lung collapse by the help of magic, but apparently you can.
Thor seems to take heart at this; he clutches Mjølnir and grins at Bruce, who offers him a small smile in return.
He snorts. “Really, J? You're going there? If you're gonna try to make someone feel better about himself, you should focus your circuits on Cap. I don't deserve any sympathy, you know that.” DUM-E beeps angrily at that, and Tony resumes his stroking.
Bruce's brows draw tighter together, but he lets it go, just nods and flips out his StarkPhone A7 – limited Avenger edition – courtesy of their resident genius.
“I feel...” JARVIS says and trails off, moving his arms and taking a step forward. He waves his fingers absently, no doubt fascinated by the new input, no matter that JARVIS was always Iron Man's co-pilot. “I feel,” JARVIS says decisively, and looks up. “Impeccable work as always, Sir.”
“Coulson's alive?” Natasha asks, and her voice is shaking; with relief or anger, Steve doesn't know. “He's been alive all these months?”
Steve looks up at that abruptly, with a startled look that he almost immediately schools. Tony frowns.
song – coming on before he even enters the room, but he doesn't care. He'd cornered Hill as soon as he'd left, and she'd known better than to try and stuff the cat back in the bag. “Room three-oh-six, Barton,” she'd said, lips pursed. “Don't agitate him. He's still recovering. How did you get it out of Fury?”
there, feeling his heart hammer in his chest, the arc reactor picking up pace by a micro-fraction, fear so pungent in Tony's throat it feels like he's going to throw up.
“Love song,” Clint says and looks sour. “For my bow.” He glares when Tony starts laughing. “What about you, Tasha?”
” He doesn't so much dance as sway right now, his fingers deftly finding the emergency release triggers on his suit, shedding part after protective part, baring his heart as well as his undersuit-clad body.
“So I can't help wondering,” Clint says, going for nonchalant even though he's strapped to a chair that he can't worm his way out of and Loki's giving him the mind-reading look again. “I mean, dancing and singing? Cute and a first, at least for me, so points for originality. But it seems a little lame for you. Or did you just decide to downgrade? Plan A, destroy the human population with an alien army; Plan B, create your own Disney movie?”
Tony takes another deep breath, torn between second-hand guilt for JARVIS (who seems to have existential issues now, poor guy), his own guilt for Cap (because that's not going anywhere any time soon), and good old-fashioned gratitude in the knowledge that his AI loves him as much as he does. Even if JARVIS can't help it, Tony being his creator and all... it still warms him to the bone, that JARVIS wishes he could be here for Tony in a more corporeal fashion.
“My friends!” Loki greets them when they barge inside, a wide grin splitting his face. There's nothing in his tone that suggests he's anything but delighted to see them, which Tony knows is probably the worst reaction they could have hoped for.
“Yeah, we are,” Steve says, and he sounds as relieved as Tony is at the prospect of getting Tony the hell out of here. Which, Tony would be hurt (or pretend to be, at least), but he doesn't really want Cap singing at him either, so the feeling's mutual. “We should probably call Fury at some point, though,” Steve adds. “When we've talked to the whole team.”
The AI nods once at that. Then he walks over to Tony, and slowly – awkwardly – envelops him in a gentle hug.
Which is, of course, when he feels someone sneak up behind him. Clint, still under the song's spell, can't turn around; not until there's a hand holding a piece of cloth over his mouth and nostrils, filling his head with a sickly sweet smell Clint recognizes all too well.
. It feels like he's pulled a two-nighter in the lab again, forgetting to eat until JARVIS points it out and realizing he's about to faint from lack of sustenance.
Hulk stares for a while longer, before grunting and sitting back on his ass. The room reverberates with it. “HULK SMASH GOD,” Hulk announces, and seems a little put out that the fight's over already.
“Believe me, Sir, I am quite used to the display,” JARVIS says, and Tony still doesn't know the entire emotional range in the AI's voice, but 'demure' is there for sure.
at you?” Clint asks, his voice approaching a snarl. “That's – that's low, Natasha.” He knows what she wants him to sing about; his pulling away, his hiding, the fact that he never enters HQ unless he's commanded to – the fact that he still hasn't been to Phil's grave. There's not a lot Clint keeps from Natasha, but
“As long as the Other Guy doesn't start crooning,” Bruce smiles back. “No,” he adds when Thor looks intrigued by that suggestion. “Believe me. None of us want that.”
“Coulson,” Natasha whispers – the first thing she's been allowed to say since this damned song began. Clint doesn't need to acknowledge it: of course it was. Phil's his soft spot; him and Natasha. Loki tried to break Natasha, and when that didn't work, he killed Phil.
And Tony hugs DUM-E close, pathetically grateful that his kid can't sing back at him, at least, and DUM-E clings right back and provides back-up bleeps while Tony's greatest creation sings to him.
, it was nothing, except it wasn't nothing and this is clearly killing Steve, and wow, Tony's actually the worst friend in the history of the world and he didn't even notice.
“Boyfriend material?” Clint tries, though he doesn't quite manage to keep the laughter out of his voice.
“Right,” Clint says and spins an apple on the tip of his finger. “Can I be the first one to call magic curse?”
So Clint sneaks up into his private space – except it's not private anymore, because there's a familiar red-head waiting for him as soon as he enters the room, stepping in front of the door he just walked through so he can't escape.
Loki's face sours and he places a hand on his chest, as if feeling his chest expand with his intake of breath. “You
“And here I thought you were going to serenade me about my shapely ass,” Tony says with a mock pout. “Or how hot
“I must admit,” Loki muses, “that as... valuable as Agent Barton has proven himself to me in the past, it would be interesting to have a more augmented creature as my second in command. Or perhaps a well-tamed, green beast.” His eyes glitter as they travel between Steve and Bruce, completely ignoring the three others. “However, I have found myself growing fond of your little archer,” Loki says, and this time, Clint does actually twitch.
Maybe it was just to see Steve duck his head and purse his lips; see how his cheeks flamed up and his springy steps lost their sharp rhythm, if only for a beat.
,” Tony says, his mind reeling. “Fucking Fury. We should have known the bastard would pull some shit like that to band us together, Jesus Christ.” He drags a hand through his hair. “Where are the rest of the guys?”
“My phone?” Clint blinks. “...Seriously? Wow, you really are dumb enough to try this again, aren't you?”
“Oh, come on. Don't even try that, Barton. The way you stormed off after Fury's aria to go lament by yourself? Kind of hard not to notice.”
Fuck, more magic cubes? Clint wants to thunk his head against a wall, but hey, still strapped to a fucking chair. “That's great, L'Oreal.”
“I am quite content, Sir, thank you,” JARVIS says quietly and keeps hugging him. Tony remembers – as he often does – the song his AI sang to him three months ago, and the wistful wishes expressed in it. Tony's so fucking glad that he spent so much time on JARVIS's new nerve endings, so he can feel properly what a hug is like.
” The rest of his suit falls to the floor and Tony steps out of his armored boots, just as the music changes into double its normal rhythm and he starts tap-dancing in earnest.
“Good evening, Captain Rogers,” JARVIS says and inclines his head by a fraction. It's startling how much he reminds Tony of old Edwin.
“I make a fucking excellent point, JARVIS, don't pretend otherwise.” Tony smiles against DUM-E's cool metal body, grateful that his snark is creeping back in.
Steve and Natasha show up less than a minute later, and the moment Steve looks at Bruce and Thor, he sighs. “We're going to start singing again, aren't we?” he asks. “I can feel it in my bones.”
“Of course not,” Steve says, and hey, there's humor there somewhere, Tony's sure of it. “But you – you didn't know. About my v... That wasn't why you were making all those jokes.”
,” and Clint's officially beginning to feel nauseated now. He keeps singing, and Natasha keeps oo-ing, the two of them moving in perfect synchronism even though he sees how wide her eyes are.
“Care to assist, Mister Stark?” Loki purrs. “Share your unique view of the world? I'm sure we would all
Hulk swivels his head, squints at the wall, and then he's off, bursting right through it and outside. The wall threatens to crumble – and the ceiling with it – but most of the pillars remain intact, and only a massive amount of dust wafts down from the ceiling. It would suck to win the fight only to be crushed to death by rubble.
“I live to serve,” Clint snipes, and regrets the words as soon as he says them. Just a quip, it's just a quip, but
Nobody seems sure what to do with the demi-god's sudden bout of rage - not even the music. Thor blinks and lets Mjølnir slide out of his grasp and thunk to the floor, looking around like he's just woken up from a deep sleep. His cheeks tint.
Everyone stares. Even the music halts. Thor's smile cracks into an almost petulant mask, and he looks over at Bruce for back-up.
“W's errone,” Tony groans in a barely-there voice, and Clint walks over to see the billionaire blink open bloodshot eyes and squint sulkily at him. Even Clint doesn't know how to squint sulkily.
Steve swallows and tries to block Tony's slack-jawed, terrified face from his mind. “Tony needs – he just needs a little space right now. I talked to him earlier, and we reached a tentative conclusion on who might be the cause of this.” Steve tells them the reasons he and Tony discussed – why Loki simply seems the most likely candidate. Clint and Natasha nod in perfect synchronization, something that was eerie and common long before this musical curse, and Bruce's eyes darken but he doesn't interrupt. Not even Thor says anything, and when Steve finishes, the demi-god actually nods.
“Clint,” Loki says, the first time he's said Clint's first name, apart from once in the song. “You are my first choice, but you are far from my only one. Or would you rather see your Captain under my thrall, by my side? Perhaps the Man of Iron, or the lovely Miss Romanoff?”
“I second this,” Thor rumbles, though his eyes brighten a little at the physical contact. And to be honest, Tony
” Tony murmurs – a confession, yeah, but maybe a gift too. Letting Steve know it's cool. He's better off finding someone else to give that big, beautiful heart of his to, because Tony's fucked up and hey, he's dying right now anyway. Everything works out.
“Better get it over with before we find Loki, Captain,” Natasha points out and heads to the front of the airplane. Tony stays on the outside, in his suit, and then they're off.
“I love it when you talk dirty to me, J,” Tony says and blows a kiss at the ceiling, even if his stomach jolts unpleasantly. Truth be told, he'd rather just stay clear of the Captain's path for a while, until he's not in any danger of bursting out with any sappy rom-com announcements. But considering how Cap had exited the room yesterday like his well-formed ass was on fire, Tony knows he's not keen on hanging around with his team right now. Which means that whatever he wants to discuss with Tony must be important.
“Please spare me the naïve sermon on the bonds of family, brother dear,” Loki sneers, his smile still big and sharp as any of Clint's knives. “I did not bring your team here tonight to listen to your incessant, sentimental dribble.”
There's absolutely no need for her to answer that. “I'll send you the coordinates. We leave in ten minutes. Make sure you're not followed or seen.”
On the contrary; within a month, half a year after the Battle of New York, all six of them were living in Stark Tower, just like that. Barton and Romanoff flitted between SHIELD HQ and the tower, Thor vacated in Asgard every now and then, and Bruce still seemed twitchy (although that might be just what he was
“I wish I could still get drunk,” Steve says, skulking to his room and hiding there. Tony doesn't blame the guy. He might just keel over with embarrassment if this happens again.
had to sing 'I love you' before you realised that your sad little crush on him isn't unrequited?” Clint's sniping is harsher than he originally intended.
“Get off me, you wretched-” Loki snarls, and then Hulk's pounding him down into the floor again, growling.
“No, no. Of course not,” Steve says and sounds completely unsurprised, if not disappointed. He stares at Coulson's sleeping form for a while, instead of Tony.
Tony laughs; it's a broken sound. “You're not wrong, J.” DUM-E makes a distressed noise. “Ssh, Daddy's alright. He's just a callous asshole, that's all.”
“I'm uncertain, Sir, but it might be worth investigating. Agent Barton seems to have paced the streets of Manhattan for the majority of the evening, before stopping near Sir's Tower at approximately 8:42.”
He looks down at their two bodies, nearly touching, and sees Phil in his mind; with a coffee cup, courtesy of Clint, with tired eyes and a smile after paper-working through the night. Such a common sight. Clint loved those nights when he'd camp out in Phil's office and listen to him do paperwork, and finally be able to catch some Zs. Feel safe.
Tony grins. “Hacking into SHIELD is always a good start, which is why I told JARVIS earlier to go through every scrap of information he could find and report back to me.” He sips his coffee, letting the rich, dark flavor spread on his tongue and wash away the lack of sleep and the exhaustion. “Makes him happy to have something to fiddle with,” Tony adds.
“Me neither, sir.” This time, she can't quite hide every emotion from her voice. Can't quite keep it bland enough. She's angry that she hadn't realized Clint loved Phil so deeply, and hurt that he hadn't trusted her with the knowledge. Surprised she hadn't seen it coming, and grudgingly proud that Clint had managed to keep such a big secret from the two most important people in his life. She's still not sure where on the scale she will end up, but she knows that if Clint's been compromised, Coulson might be able to shake him out of it. Or she'll hit him hard on the head again.
“I'm still here,” Phil murmurs, and swallows his apologies. Instead he presses his lips to Clint's sweaty temple and breathes in the smell of fear and sleep and fig shampoo. Clint's nightmares are still an every-night occurrence, and Phil is still dead in them more often than not. It will take longer to convince Clint's subconscious, as well as his conscious, that Phil isn't going anywhere.
Clint doesn't say anything, though Tony can see the tick of his jaw and the tightening of his shoulders. He doesn't meet anyone's gaze – least of all Natasha's, whose eyes are blazing.
Tony wants to tell JARVIS that he isn't 'simply' anything, he never was. He's a goddamn work of art and the closest and best friend Tony's got, no matter that he doesn't have corporeal form (
“You're welcome, buddy,” Tony says and closes his eyes against the exhaustion washing over him. “You're goddamn welcome.”
“We should take this on ourselves, then,” Tony says. “I've already had two bouts of singing, and I really don't want a third one, so I say we find out who's doing this.”
He doesn't stay at HQ. Doesn't go back to the Tower either. Natasha's going to be there, and Clint won't put it past her to try and corner him for another shanty, which fuck that. Fuck it. Just – fuck.
“Aye, it is,” Thor says with a nod, “but I do not appreciate being made to expose my innermost doubts in a manner that clearly hurts the one I love.” He glances at Bruce with a dejected look.
Tony seems to be all about the jazz, himself – and tap dancing in the goddamn Iron Man suit, what the fuck? Tony's never tap danced in his life, but he's rocking it now, moving his feet fast enough that if he weren't a genius, he wouldn't be able to count the steps that he's doing. As it is, they make a strange kind of... sense, even if he doesn't know how he's doing it.
“Well,” Loki says, the music dying away as suddenly as it started. “Then I shall find someone else, Agent.” And his mouth curls into the familiar 'I'm about to kill everyone' smile Clint remembers and hates so much. “
“I'm sorry,” she whispers and keeps him close, and since when are they curled up on the floor instead of standing? “I'm so sorry I made you sing, I didn't – I didn't know.”
” JARVIS finishes and falls quiet as the last chords die down. DUM-E bleeps a couple more times before he seems to realize that the song is over. Then he whirs in question at Tony.
“As I thought,” Loki says, almost soft, and shifts his attention to the team. Tony wants to shoot forward and blast the demi-god with his propulsors, but he can't. He just – can't move. There's no music, but it's still there, the curse, tapping into his energy reserve and using it against him, using it to keep Tony still. Looking to his side, Tony recognizes the same frustrated, constipated look on the faces of his team mates.
Phil's eyes flutter shut. “Thank you, Clint.” His hand curls into a loose fist, before opening again. He turns it over, palm up. Clint stares at it like it might hold the answers of the universe.
“Wow. I mean, you always seemed so human, but now...” Steve gestures vaguely at the metal body. “Wow.”
” Loki looks down at that, as if bashful, as if honestly saying he needs Clint to polish his insane plans for universe domination. Yeah, no.
The silence seems infinite and it makes Tony's skin itch. And he's just too fucking tired to stand that itch, so he ends up speaking first. “How did you do it?”
,” Clint says, and that's when Phil speaks – sings – up, the two of them singing together, but not with each other; over each other, like a sung argument.
.” He's inching closer, still dancing with far more grace than Clint would have thought, even though the guy's smooth as glass when he moves anyway. (
“Tony!” Steve barks, shutting Tony up, because hey, whoa. What's with the hostility? Steve sighs and pinches the bridge of his nose. “Can you just – be serious for one moment? I'm trying to actually discuss something here.”
Steve stares at JARVIS again. JARVIS calmly looks back. “He looks... you look amazing, Jarv,” he says after a moment and smiles uncertainly.
“Okay, so should we all run for the hills, then?” Tony asks, scratching at his goatee. “Until we've figured this thing out? Because I, for one, am not too keen on doing musical numbers with you guys. No offense.” Actually, it could be really hilarious to watch his team sing and do little cute tap-dancing numbers, except that would mean that Tony would do them too and it's just not worth it. The hills are
“Director,” Steve says when the team enters, loud enough that most of the people in the hall turns to stare at them. “We need a word with you, sir.”
” And he pulls back; turns around so Tony can't help but focus on the rigid, painfully set look of his shoulders, the way his back moves as he sucks in sharp breaths of air.
Tony smirks. “I know that. If you were, you'd probably hate me too.” DUM-E whirs sadly and nudges his chest with his robot arm. “Thanks for the vote of confidence, Dum-Dum.”
Bruce gives his partner a sad smile and reaches out a hand, tangling their fingers. “We both said some... less than stellar things. We'll just have to work through them.” He lifts the cup with his free hand and sips delicately at his tea. “Preferably not through singing.”
Hulk blinks, still scowling, and pokes Phil in the ribs. Even Phil can't quite keep the low cry of pain to himself when Hulk hits him right where Clint knows the bandage is. “AGENT STILL SHOOT BANNER.”
Clint blinks, thinks of denying everything, but that's as good as admitting it. And he's not ready to do that yet, not with Phil here, not with Phil still so out of reach. Instead he plasters on a smirk. “Says you.”
” Steve sings softly and places his hand on Tony's shoulder; lets the other brush through his hair. “
Steve lets out a long breath, and smiles. He has dimples when he smiles; of course he fucking has. Tony knew, he'd just somehow forgotten, so now he gets to be dazzled by them all over again.
“Off we go, then,” Clint says and hops down from the couch rest he's been perching on. Natasha just nods and follows the archer.
“You've been shut-off as a Soviet Gulag since New York,” Natasha says, unapologetic. “You know I've tried asking nicely, but you avoid me. You avoid everyone.”
The team has scattered. Steve, of course, ran off as soon as their horrible little ensemble number ended, and Natasha and Clint did the same as soon as they got their hands on some of Tony's booze. Bruce disappeared down to his workshop not too long ago, and by now, Thor is the only one left in the living room – and the only one who isn't freaking the hell out at the possibility of having to proclaim his innermost feelings to his team. Then again, Tony muses on, that makes sense. Everyone knows about the demi-god and their house scientist-slash-rage-monster shacking up together – as surprising as it was at first –, and in general, Thor's not the guy to keep a lid on his feelings. He probably doesn't have much to hide.
“So I think I just earned the trophy for most awkward moment this century last night,” the billionaire says and shifts into an almost upright position in his bed. Immediately his face pales from the exertion and his breath labors. Clint wonders if that's how Phil will be, when he wakes up.
Tony turns his head slowly, assessing the room around him. He blinks when he sees Phil, groaning and squirming a little. “Agent? And... Steve?”
“So I was,” Phil Coulson says from somewhere behind Clint, and he can't see him from where he sits, no matter how much he cranes his head. “I guess it didn't take.”
“I'm just saying,” Clint says and lifts his hands in the air, telling Tony he's backing off. It's probably mean to exhaust the fatigued dude more than necessary.
The chords turn contemplative, quiet, and Tony stills, swaying and trying not to fall flat on his face. He quirks a smile at his team mates; at Thor, who looks pained by what his brother's doing to Tony; at Bruce, who looks endlessly sympathetic, his eyes a bright green; at Natasha, stiff as a statue and eyes drilling into his as if she's trying to give him energy through her gaze alone; at Steve, who just looks desperate.
He didn't want skin, didn't want to look as human as possible, so instead he's got a golden, metallic shine that makes him look like an infinitely cooler version of 3CPO. He also has rounded eyes, which makes him look a lot less mean than Iron Man, and they emit a cool, blue light. Like Tony's arc reactor.
“Tony? It's past four again, are you coming to b-” Steve has a Stark tablet in his hands and frowns at it as he walks into the workshop, but the moment he looks up, his steps falter and the words stop coming. He doesn't drop the tablet, but it looks like a near thing. “Wha... is that a new suit?”
Phil Coulson is awake. He doesn't look good; his face is pasty and drawn, there are dark rings beneath his eyes and his hair is cropped short. He's wearing a hospital gown, but it's shifted enough that Clint can see the edge of a bandage above the collar, one Clint knows must extend across most of his chest with a similar patch on the back.
“Yeah, no. I can see that. Being Loki's number one fan isn't something I'd want on my CV.” Tony looks away, towards the small window across from him. It's gray and cloudy outside, and not much of a view, but it gives Clint the space to take a deep breath and ground himself.
And then they all promptly hunch forward, gasping with the effort to breathe, their limbs shaking with the sudden energy loss. Iron Man seems to do just fine, but Steve can hear Tony's heavy breathing over the comm.
Then Tony says: “Okay, who needs to get drunk?” and there's a collective groan of agreement from all around him.
They stare each other down. Or rather, Clint stares Phil down and Phil just takes it, without question or fight. And that takes all the pleasure out of it, really – there's little point of being angry at someone who's already brimming over with guilt. It's like kicking a wounded kitten. “It's Clint, sir. Phil.”
actually crying, crying full-on, even, like he hasn't managed to do after Phil's death at all. He can't. Couldn't. Apparently he can now, with Nat here.
“I don't care,” Tony says and leans back a little more, further into the safety of Steve's arms. “J's family.” He stretches out a hand, and JARVIS tangles their fingers and squeezes.
Tony actually flushes at that, and looks down at his blanket-clad legs. “I knew,” he says, voice flat. “Told you, remember? I made the poor bastard sing about sex at me.” He takes a deep breath. “So believe me – I knew.” He starts fiddling with a loose string on his blanket.
” and they all exchange glances; half earnest ones, in sync with the dramatic music surrounding them, and half exasperated by the text.
” Tony sings, the curse letting him go back to swaying for the moment, pant between the lyrics. He thinks he hears Steve make a choked-off, angry sound, but he's still not looking at the guy. Can't.
“No,” Clint says and stumbles back a few more steps. “No, fuck everything and fuck you. I've sung everything I need to say.” And then he's back up in the vent, crawling away, ignoring Phil's pleas.
How proud he would have been,” and JARVIS's voice drops further at that. Tony sucks in a shaky breath and closes his eyes; feels moisture on his cheeks where his eyelashes rest, and DUM-E squeezes his wrist again.
Phil doesn't fall back asleep. He only listens to Clint's deep, even breathing, thankful that his partner's dreams have quieted. A small, blue light appears on his bedside table, and Phil turns towards it.
“Not talking about my issues,” Tony warns him. His head is starting to feel woolen now, and he knows he's about to pass out again. Fucking energy-stealing demi-gods.
” Loki sings, his words soft but mocking laughter clear in his eyes; twisting words Clint so wishes to hear from a certain not-dead handler. “
