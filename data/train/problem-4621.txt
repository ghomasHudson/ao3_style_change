, but his mouth can’t decide if it should be
“I—” says Cas, and Dean can see it in his eyes: years’ worth of forced composure and dignity, crumbling. “I don’t like being sick,” he says—wet, gruff, pathetic. “I hate being sick.”
No reply. Sam knocks again.
Right as Cas opens his mouth to speak, a figure appears behind him. Dean jumps to his feet, grabbing the machete again.
When he finally hears Cas’s truck pull in, it’s been almost an hour. He has a text typed and ready to send:
“I know,” says Sam.
Sam rolls his eyes. “We can have this talk if you want to, Dean, but I don’t think you really want to.”
“I know,” Dean says quietly. ”Fuckin’ sucks. I’m sorry.” He brings his hand up to rub his thumb over Cas’s temple. “I’m gonna go make you something to eat. Any requests?”
Dean just wants to kill something, he realizes, guilt and craving simmering deep down inside him. He just wants to shoot something, stab it until it’s dead. He wants to be the end of something. He wants—he wants to be in control.
“What’s up, assholes?” she says, obviously trying not to smile, failing.
“I may have also misrepresented how hands-off Jack is being.” Cas immediately looks like he regrets having said it, and Dean feels his lungs constrict.
So there's this spell - it's actually a curse.
“Anything could happen to either of us now, Cas,” says Dean.
“Thank you,” Cas says, and with that Eileen turns on her heel and heads toward the kitchen.
“Gregory is…” He lets one hand wander up to scratch gentle circles in the side of Dean’s hair. “He’s a good friend and a valuable cultural tutor. He also has a rich dating life with which I am uninvolved, though I hear a lot about it.”
Dean laughs, standing. “That’s how they get you.”
She looks towards Castiel, who's still chatting with the maintenance guy.
Dean and Cas both laugh, look at each other.
While they’re waiting for John D to pop back up, Dean ruffles Cas’s hair.
“Hey. No. You listen to me.” He reaches up, touches Cas’s face. Cas is looking at him like he’ll never see him again. “This is not your fault. I—I slipped up, okay? Guess I got cocky. But I always knew I was gonna go out this way. I’m glad it’s like this. You know I always wanted to go out swinging. And out here on the road with you—I can’t think of anything better.”
Castiel had hoped to arrange this meeting in a more neutral setting. Perhaps they could all meet up at some restaurant, where a certain degree of decorum would be mandatory. But his father had encouraged him to bring Dean home, worried that an invitation anywhere else would give Dean the wrong idea, that he was not trusted within the mansion since his little peccadillo (yes, his father called it that).
“Hello there big guy! It’s good to see you again.”
“To talk” – he made sure to add.
“No, sir, of course not! If you are absolutely sure of that, then ...”
“So should I advertise for another mechanic?”
Martinez nodded, a minute smile on his lips, then returned to his duties.
Dean leaves Rockridge behind him in the dust.  He does not look back.  Just like he said, he has a job to do and he can’t get sidetracked, even though he’s finding it difficult to stop thinking about Castiel.  Why did he have to meet him when nothing could come of it?  Life’s a bitch for sure.  It will take time to forget the comfort of Cas’ company, his odd little quirks, those intense blue eyes and yeah, everything else about him.  He sighs.
Ah, crap!
“I’m sorry Dean. I don’t know of any way to break this. It’s not at all common, and I suspect because of that there hasn’t been much research on the subject. And what there is, is all about the positive aspects of it. No one would be looking into how to break it.”
) and swiftly straddled him.
Sammy just blurted out what Dean knew he had been thinking since he first heard of Castiel Novak.
*******
Oookay. Not like Bobby to get so protective. I mean, yeah, he always had his back, but he also knew Dean could manage almost any situation. This dude must be sending really bad vibes to be able to rattle him so.
No, the problems were just regular relationship stuff.  That shit’s hard, and Dean had tried, he really had, but he’d failed.  How much more pressure would there be with an actual soulmate, someone who everyone thought would be a perfect match?  He was just a screw up and it was best not to drag another person down with him.  Seriously, he’d be doing his future soulmate a favour.
He was so engrossed by his novel that he almost shot off the sofa when his cell went off.  He rolled his eyes as he saw the caller ID and considered not answering.  But then he might end up with a giant moose on his doorstep.
“Look, I’ve been reading stuff. And, yeah, I don’t think you did this on purpose, but I’m still pissed as hell.”
Cas could sense the sudden spike of arousal as Dean held his hand out to him. He took the opportunity to pull Dean down for a kiss.
Dean looked as if for the first time he felt sorry for Castiel.
Dean and Cas exchanged a look which clearly conveyed they had talked about it and neither was happy with the conclusions. Cas’ tone was subdued.
Ten minutes later Dean was chowing down on the annoyingly delicious dinner that had been promised. He felt no compunction about moaning out loud, since he was on his own, and since the steak was the most tender and tasty he had ever had. Clearly Crowley had done some checking up on Dean’s tastes, the creepy fucker. Just before he had settled down to eat Dean had explored his rooms, and found a closet filled with the kind of clothes Dean favoured. Sure, there was the odd suit or two, but it mostly consisted of the comfortable and practical wear that Dean wore every day, though of a much higher quality than he could afford.
Cas’ look was almost pained. “Should you not have warned him?”
“Look, truth is I... I’m not good at relationships.  I kinda mess things up and...” – he petered off, letting Castiel fill in the obvious blanks – “and you are so... put together.”
was the tone to go with it.
As they sat in the kitchen finishing their pizza, Dean took a swig of his beer, then leant forward, elbows on the table, fiddling nervously with the bottle.
“Whoa, hang on.  I mean, yeah, I hated all this ‘this is your destiny’ shit.  Made me feel I had no choice. So I took the time off work and was gonna stay all day inside just to give madam fate the finger.”
He retraced his steps and disappeared into the building, rushing down the stairs as he heard the front door open. And there was Cas, with his blinding smile, running towards him.
“Dude, that’s hilarious!  That’s exactly what I was doing!”
“You do realise if you kill me the agency will never stop hunting you?”
“Well, I told Sammy you were having some issues with him, and he got his serious determined look on, and marched off to talk to him. So I’m expecting he appointed himself Gabe’s personal assistant even as we speak.”
“Well, why shouldn’t everyone know what kind of guide Castiel is panting after? And fyi, it’s not a big community, and word travels fast.”
Cas winced, but could not deny that this was essentially the case.
“I’m sure you are right. And if I find nothing, I’ll expand my search. But I think I found what I’m looking for.”
He kept the conversation short and to the point. He had a photo of the number plate and one of the guy himself courtesy of Bobby’s phone. But what worried Dean was that the sentinel had not cared about that. He had obviously been aware of the click of the camera, since Bobby had been less than covert about it, hoping the action would make the man leave. Instead the smug shit had actually turned towards him and offered a perfect shot. Whoever this guy was, he was confident he could not be touched.
He eased the door open, bracing himself for the annoying beeping of the alarm system while trying desperately to remember the code in his present state. No beeping greeted him. He looked at the panel, but nothing seemed to be amiss. Gabriel was the last out, as usual. He must have forgotten to set the alarm.
“My brother thinks you are the second coming. So you can tell me all about that guide refuge you set up. It’ll make Sammy’s day.”
Dean looked sceptical. “I heard of bonded sentinels zoning. So how come that happens?”
“Dude, are you kidding?  Which one of us looks like the spoilt rich city kid running away from daddy?”
Or maybe not.
“I’m so sorry, Dean.”
Oh, yes, this meeting was an excellent idea.
“So you doing a public service, is that it? Maybe the sentinel community needs a solid kick up the ass, but them being crap does not excuse what you are doing either.”
Time for research. He needed to know what the hell was going on with him. He borrowed Bobby’s computer (no way was he using Sammy’s and giving him ideas) and buckled down.
“Jerk.”
*******
“I’m fine, Sammy. It’s all over now” – and then checking with Cas – “It is, isn’t it?”
He watched as Dean’s eyes narrowed and just before the conversation could take an unpleasant turn, he hastily added –
“I don’t understand. He is a sentinel. Doesn’t that mean he’s one of the good guys? Maybe he really didn’t know anything.”
Goon two was not taking any chances. Either the fate of the previous guy had rattled him, or having lost the advantage of the net, he was being careful with Crowley’s precious guide. Dean was ok with that. But just as the man took one step towards him, he stopped in his tracks and brought his hand to his ear piece. He shouted a response after listening for barely a few seconds. Dean couldn’t really hear anything, what with the copter rotors whirring noisily overhead, but the man’s expression was grim. Before Dean could work out what was going on, the man was being winched back. As soon as he was inside the helicopter, it swung sideways towards the large green swathe of the back garden, where a harried looking Crowley was shouting and gesticulating. And just beyond him on the horizon two helicopters were making a bee line for the mansion. As Dean watched with an elated smile on his face, he could just glimpse a line of cars making their way towards the house.
He watched as Crowley climbed into the copter, lifting up as soon as his foot left the ground. One of the helicopters immediately veered off in his direction and followed. The other landed in the garden, dispersing whatever goons were around. Not that they could get very far, considering the flotilla of cars swarming the road out of the mansion.
). He shook his head to rid himself of this extraneous junk, then winced at the pain. He tried to centre himself, as they taught at sentinel academy, before attempting to engage his senses on whatever it was that had gripped his attention.
“What?” Dean’s belligerent attitude didn’t fool him for a second.
As Dean sat up there was a knock on the door, immediately followed by its opening. Rude. One of Crowley’s goons walked in carrying a tray of breakfast food. The smell was enough to make Dean’s stomach rumble. He peeked at the contents, and his eyes feasted on rashers of crispy bacon, two overeasy eggs and hash browns. His mouth was already watering, but there was no way he was risking eating anything else. Crowley had tried drugging him to lower his natural defences, and Dean wouldn’t put it past him to slip him something again, maybe just to make him more manageable prior to their removal.
“You need to keep your strength up if you are going to try to escape.”
Crowley was, after all, a sentinel. If his senses were good enough, he could hunt him down. Though even in that worst case scenario, Dean knew his position would make it difficult for anyone to try and oust him, certainly without risking damage. He hoped instead that they would waste time searching the house and grounds, and since these were generous, it would take some time, even with Crowley’s manpower.
Dean shook his head and chuckled.  Not hysterically, just, you know, a tad unhinged.
Dean had to restrain Cas as he lunged for his brother. Luke looked shocked. Castiel rarely lost his temper, and when he did it tended to result in cold anger. Dean was murmuring in Cas’ ear, and whatever he was saying, it was calming him down. Meanwhile the rest of the family was giving Luke a right telling off, and if the situation hadn’t been so serious Dean would have been enjoying every moment of it. Well, he did enjoy quite a bit of it. Hey, he was only human. By the time everyone calmed down, the man looked like he wished he were anywhere else. And everyone else seemed to feel the same, judging by the glares directed at him.
The dinner went as well as Castiel could have hoped. While Gabriel looked on in amused detachment, Michael and Luke continued to slip double edged remarks into the conversation, but Dean replied with interest, all the while keeping the subtext hidden. It was amusing to see how much meaning Dean could convey with the odd eyebrow lift, or how chilling his normally warm smile could get. Castiel’s parents were clearly not so much in the dark as the oblivious siblings thought, but soon were aware that Dean could hold his own, and if anything by the end of the meal they looked upon Dean with genuine approval.
“Dude, I’m hungry and I didn’t have breakfast.” He cast a long look at Sam, seeing the worry and stress he had been under.
“You are using your prejudice against all sentinels to convince yourself you don’t like this one. But I know you, Dean, if you didn’t you’d have told him to get lost long before now.”
Dean rolled his eyes. Whatever.
A tense silence followed, Crowley’s anger and the other person’s fear an unpleasant cocktail of emotions swirling in Dean’s mind.
“Ooookay, for the purposes of being able to call on you quickly, you know, in like an emergency type situation, can I call you something else for short?”
A solid hand squeezed Castiel’s shoulder, the very height of parental approval. His mother smiled encouragingly, Gabe looked intrigued, Michael bored, and Luke mischievous. Castiel felt only some of his tension ebbing away.
A few days later and Dean was beginning to miss the doctor. Or anything or anyone who could break the monotony of their daily lives. Well, not so much that, but that stressful waiting until they could put the plan into operation. Everyone else was carrying on, with some alterations to their routines, but he and Cas had remained in the Novak residence for the past week, and he was going a bit stir crazy. Cas was much more philosophical about the enforced stay, happy to be near Dean and being a bit clingy. Dean understood, and felt comforted by Cas’ presence. The present crisis had forced the issue between them. Not the best situation in which to declare one’s feelings, but for Dean it had actually made it easier to confess them. Not that it was ever going to be a romantic declaration.
Dean dived into the pie like an invading army battering walls. He shovelled a huge piece into his mouth, barely managing to close it before chewing and was privately chuckling at Castiel’s look of dismay. Before his own took on that look. He rushed to swallow, then gulped down the coffee in an attempt to drown the insipid taste. Instead further disappointment awaited him.
But Dean had always gone with his gut instincts, and everything told him to trust this man. Guide or not, he had never felt like this about any other person he had met. That had to mean something, right?
“We’ll make sure they don’t.”
“How right you are, Sammy.  I forgot to buy popcorn for my Netflix marathon, and I deeply regret it.”
“I must explore you with all my senses in order to imprint on you. Shall we start with sight?”
“Wow, not ominous at all. Seriously, you need to work on that game face of yours.”
Dean gleefully tucked back into his meal, and his sanguine attitude removed any further worries Cas and Sam might have had. Whatever had happened in the mansion, clearly Dean seemed unharmed. Cas was going to get every single detail of his stay out of him, though he suspected that any attempt to offer counselling would be met with a snort.
Dean had listened to the information on his mysterious douchebag visitor and hadn’t even tried to object to the protective details Cas had arranged with both the sentinel community and his own precinct. The FBI had also been alerted and were sending a couple of agents. Dean did insist that some of that manpower be directed at protecting Sammy and Bobby. And by the time they called for a family meeting it was clear to all that this was serious.
“How can you work with Guide Services if you are an unbonded sentinel?”
“I don’t deny for a second that I sell guides to sentinels, and I make no excuses for it. It pays very well. But if you think that the official channels are doing much better, think again.”
Castiel chuckled.  “More so, I believe.  But he’ll probably deflect your brother’s smugness by pointing out that he ‘called it’ way back.”
choose to enter one of the standard professions sentinels are expected to go for. Architects, lawyers, businessmen. You don’t get a bite of the cherry if you do that. You get left with what everyone else doesn’t want. And why should they settle for that?”
He stood up so quickly he almost fell back on his ass, but there was a grip on his arm, a lifeline, and words coming through to him as if from far away.
Dean’s smile is a thing of beauty.  “Would that have worked with you?”
*******
As Dean closed the door with a relieved sigh, the telltale sounds of the coffee maker percolated through his foggy brain to indicate that his brew was finally ready.  Dean poured it in his favourite mug (lovingly marked ‘jerk’ in giant red letters) and cupping it in his hands, sat down to enjoy it and felt like he had really earned it this morning.  Hey, maybe this day wasn’t going to be a complete write off after all.
Dean’s clearly beginning to enjoy his upcoming acting gig.
Before he could reply, Martinez poked his head into the kitchen.
? Who the hell called it that?
They both took a long swig of their bottles.
He ended the call and muted the phone, throwing it on the sofa with a groan.
Caltrops. Damn caltrops. If it wasn’t for Martinez’s skill the car would have veered off the road as it came round the bend. As it was, two punctures put paid to any attempt to follow Dean. They radioed in to the other car only to find out that had also suffered a similar fate.
He dragged his attention back from the tantalising skin of Dean’s cheeks when the man replied.
As he found himself yet again ruminating over this, whilst rummaging through the kitchen cupboards looking for snacks (
“And how do we break this?”
“Yeah, but you don’t think it’s gonna bring up some questions when you show up to the courthouse saying, you know,
“And now he’s… he’s just back? How long?”
Now, Cas is stirring, rolling over, making a quiet humming noise. Deans sits tall in his chair, pretending he’s fully rested and awake, though he doesn’t know why.
Dean can’t quite tell if he’s being sarcastic.
“I’ll be right back, Kristi,” Cas says to the receptionist instead of answering. Then he shrugs. “I develop new mannerisms all the time. I think it’s neat.”
“How,” he says. “What? Cas?”
“Stay,” Cas mumbles, eyes shut. “Warm.”
Behind door number whatever is Janine from accounting, who is maybe a little too excited to meet Dean.
When he turns around, Janine is grinning at him, a ring of red wine obvious around her mouth, and she’s wielding her current glass uncarefully at best. Her witch hat hangs precariously.
“What did I ever fuckin’ do to deserve you.” He shakes his head.
“He fell for you,” Sam says. He laughs without humor. “Again. Fucking incredible.”
He's been out of town, right? What's the signal like on the curse?
“Yeah.” He nods. “Yes. I, uh, went out for a nest on a ranch today. Thought I got ‘em all but I guess there was a straggler.”
,” Cas says, his tone equal parts bitter and entertained. “I understand completely,
and you’ll warm up to it.”
If there's any chance we're gonna get me fixed up, I'm coming.
“So, can I spend the night?” she says. “I can sleep on the—” Dean watches her face as the recognition dawns. “Couch.”
“You’re not just some guy,” Dean protests. “You
“There’s, like,” Sam tells him, “you know. A
“What?”
A few minutes later, they head out—thankfully Sam doesn’t try to take any pictures, though Dean can tell he kind of wants to.
Sam. She bluffing?
Talking about Charlie is like talking about Bobby: Technically she’s alive, but it’s not her. She’s fine—she’s great—but she’s not
“Seriously, Cas,” Sam says. “Anything you need, you let us know. Be careful. Be safe.”
(sighs)
“You want spoilers?” Dean says, standing at the foot of the bed in his towel.
“Yeah, but I don’t feel good about it!” Dean’s mouth is dry again. He wants another beer but he doesn’t want to ask Sam to get him one and he doesn’t want to go in the house and risk Eileen seeing him like this. “I did it because I had to. I mean, don’t get me wrong. I like it. But I want to be hunting, man. I wanna—I wanna be out there killing something, you know? Do you never feel that way?”
They get home late from dinner with Claire, Sam, and Eileen, Cas a little buzzed from all the wine, Dean mostly sober. Claire had been so relieved to see Sam made chicken that she nearly cried, and spent the whole meal stuffing food into her face with her hands like she hadn’t eaten in days. When Dean asked her if Jody hadn’t taught her better than that, she’d said, “Yeah, but none of you did.” They deserved that one.
“I’m proud of you, Dean. I know that was a difficult conversation, and you handled it well.” He doesn’t even blink.
“Well,” says Dean. There’s nothing else to that sentence. The only sound is the clinking of Cas’s fork against his plate. “I’m weighing my options,” he says finally.
“Whatever,” says Dean. “We don’t have to talk about it.”
“New blood,” the tattooed bartender says, sauntering over. “I’m John D. What can I get you boys?”
Claire makes a scrunched-up face. “Health insurance? Who needs that?”
“You’re lucky,” she says. “You could have broken that arm. Or hit your head.”
“Cas,” he mumbles. He suddenly understands that he’s falling asleep, the way it can hit you only after a night of heavy drinking and hooking up. This is one of the only familiar feelings of the night. “Where did you learn to do that? The pizza man?”
“Jesus, you two.” He shakes his head. “Well, I’ll leave you to it.” He pats Cas on the side of the face in a gesture Dean is fully prepared to get upset about, but which honestly looks just this side of fatherly. “You remember what I told you, all right, kid? No shame. Neither of you,” he adds, waggling a finger back-and-forth between Dean and Cas. “And let me know if you ever want to come to the club.”
? I didn’t do shit, Sammy. He came back. He chose to come back.”
“What about the shots?” Cas says, still chuckling. “You’re going to let them sit there?”
“Yes,” Dean says, feigning indignance, more certain than ever that he doesn’t actually get it. It seemed simple at the time, like the best possible plan: empty out the Empty, get Cas dumped back into Heaven—angels back to Heaven, demons back to Hell, monsters back to Purgatory. All gates shut, allegedly. Chuck is dead; Jack’s in charge. Nobody but Chuck ever goes to the Empty again. Sounded ideal.
“Everybody will be so excited to finally meet you,” she says, and immediately after she closes her mouth tightly, like she’s not sure that was the right thing to say. Well, it wasn’t, but Dean’s too far in it now to panic and leave.
Castiel hesitates again, but nods. He shuts the door and sits in Dean's desk chair.
“Hi,” Dean says. He holds up the paper bag. “You ladies know where I can—”
“Dean, this is Isaac.”
She twirls the penny between her fingers.
“Cas,” says Eileen, “how do you feel about the nutritional yeast?”
“I’m not going to let that happen. Dean, I am not going to let that happen. I love you.”
Emily and Safiya cheer as Dean watches Cas totally melt in front of him. He knew it would be kind of a big deal, but—okay, and Cas is kissing him again. A little less chaste. Still work-appropriate, but edging rapidly closer to the boundary.
“Well, I—” Cas seems hesitant to say, almost guilty. “I don’t want to alarm you.”
The hunting is still the big thing, but to Dean is almost starts to seem supplementary, which scares him. Who is he if hunting isn’t the thing that matters most? Who is he if he’s having a good time, and it’s not because he’s killing something or saving someone or preventing the world from ending? He doesn’t want to go home. Then he’s just home. Even if Cas is there. And who’s to say he will be? Maybe once they get off the road, Cas will realize he’s not actually in this—that what he’s looking for isn’t in Dean, is out there somewhere. Or Dean will get weird again and push him away for good.
Dean looks up at him. Tension, meet knife, etc.
“It’s not Heaven.” He looks toward the window. Sees Cas, rumpled and swollen-eyed, sitting up from a deep slump. “Hello, Dean.”
“Things have always been complicated for us, Dean.” Cas is starting to melt, to look more tired than righteous again. “I don’t recall any time when there wasn’t something coming between us.”
“Yeah, well, we do meatless Mondays.”
If you don't mind me asking... Are you and the tissue box guy...
Her face screws up again, like she's about to go for another round of wails. Castiel flinches. Dean squeezes his arm.
, Dean’s not even sure how Cas learned to drive, and at this point he isn’t sure he should ask.
“This is Tom Nowotny from Collins Automotive,” the voice says. “Now am I talkin’ to Dean?”
“Y’all have a good night, now,” says John D, glancing at Cas, back at Dean. “Be safe and be well.”
“That makes two of us,” says Dean. “We’ll figure something out. For now—well, for now maybe you can just borrow some of my clothes.” He winces as he says it, then tries to cover up the wince so Cas doesn’t see. Sharing clothes? Jesus. He stands and walks back towards the coffee maker. Turns halfway and points back at Cas. “But we’re at least gettin’ you your own underwear.”
1) my friend/writing companion and i have been collaborating on a series of playlists related to this verse and, as supplementary listening material for this chapter, we would like to share with you the DJ set for monday night at the best gay bar in oklahoma! https://rb.gy/5hjs8h
Instinctively, his smile widens, but a very slight terror radiates through him. So Cas does talk about him. By name. Everybody in this building knows who he is. He had assumed these girls were trying to flirt with him but maybe—well, maybe it’s something else.
Is this okay?
“Rough first day?” he says, handing a bottle off to Dean.
“Whoa, hey,” says Dean, so aroused he can barely form a sentence. “You wanna—are you sure?”
Very occasionally, over the summer, Cas would wake up gasping and sweating, heart pounding like the dickens, and Dean would tell him
,” he says, obviously proud of his human English idiom usage, “but I told you. There’s nothing to make up. Forgotten and forgiven.”
Cas lifts his head up drowsily, but doesn’t move his arms.
Officer,” says Dean. “What do you say I take you out for a nice dinner tonight to celebrate?”
“Special friend.” Cas pulls away to look Dean in the face. His eyebrows raise just enough to indicate absolutely insane levels of incredulity. “Well, I guess I can’t say you’re wrong. Our friendship has been very special.”
“How reassuring,” he says. “Thanks.”
“You’re so perfect,” Cas says, “so perfect, look at your mouth, look at you.” Sometimes Cas will do this—start babbling during sex, sounding so, so human. It’s different this time.
Back at home, Cas is undressed and curled up in bed before Dean’s even finished grabbing a glass of water.
Think I'm gonna go with Cas.
“No switchin’ rooms at this motel,” he says. “Hope the accommodations are satisfactory.”
“That doesn’t mean evil motherfuckers in Heaven on a technicality should get to put shit in the suggestion box,” Dean says. “Especially when the suggestion box is you. What, y’all aren’t worried about a coup?”
“Are you—” Dean is about to ask if Cas is okay, but that seems like a stupid question, all things considered. He shuts his mouth. “Did they try anything?”
“Contemporary society is like Jenga,” Cas clarifies, “and climate change is one of the sticks. If he zaps away all the ill effects of climate change today but consumption continues at its current rate, any improvements will be lost within the decade. If he eradicates certain corporations or luxuries, modern society comes to a halt, and people get testy. Delicate balance.”
Now Cas is here, keeping him busy. When he’d normally be drinking alone, they’re watching old movies or driving around. Just driving and talking. When he’d normally be drinking on an empty stomach, they’re eating dinner together. He doesn’t feel the lack.
“Man,” Dean says, “drag and Comic-Con. I’ll be a new man after tonight.”
“Seeing as I’ve been to Heaven and not to college, yeah, I know they’re different.” He laughs at his own joke, taking a little extra pleasure when Cas rolls his eyes. “Look, I’m just saying, it seems like the closest normal-person comparison we’ve got. It’s hard to know if I should think about him like a little kid or a teenager.”
human. For so long, he’s just been Cas. But Dean can make him blush now. Dean can make him do a lot of things.
Gotta be heads up to be lucky.
I may have just the thing.
“We are,” Cas says without hesitation.
Another member of the personnel holds up the baggie containing the phone.
And, well, it’s not like Dean can resist. He’s got the costume on and everything. Come on.
Dean experiences a full-body chill. “No way. Uh,” he says, trying desperately to get the ring of
Dean pulls away fully. Steps back.
Dean looks up at him, says the first thing that comes to mind: “I need you.” He watches in Cas’s eyes as Cas totally loses his mind, shoves Dean’s head forward.
Kara.
So then they’re getting dressed—together, for a date, kind of their first, in the house that they already live in together, romantically, which all sort of makes Dean’s head spin if he thinks about it too hard, so he doesn’t—and Dean isn’t totally sure what to wear, keeps picking out shirts and getting nervous and putting them back. It’s not like he has to impress Cas; he knows that. And normally he’d jump at the opportunity to get dressed up. Finding the right thing to wear just feels extra important, especially now that he and Cas are sharing closet space and he sees all Cas’s new clothes next to his, sees how different they are—the person that Cas has decided to try being juxtaposed against the person Dean has been all along. He wants to fit into this life that Cas is crafting.
There are three gentle knocks at the door. Sam looks at Dean.
His phone made it out unscathed?
Dean sobs. It hurts. He sobs again, reaching up an exhausted arm to touch the back of Cas’s head.
“Wrong phrasing,” Dean says, putting up a hand in surrender. “You know I hate living alone in that house, in that
Cas is fretting in front of the bathroom mirror, adjusting his tie over and over, until Dean comes in and fixes it for him.
“What do we do now?”
“He’s human,” Dean says quietly.
“What?” says Cas.
“Hey,” he says, gently grabbing Cas’s chin to make direct eye contact. “You gotta eat, Cas.”
“Jesus,” Dean says in a daze. Cas wipes his mouth again, takes off his jeans but leaves on his underwear. He sits cross-legged at the foot of the bed, facing Dean, leaning back on his hands. He nods thoughtfully.
I'll drive separately, then.
Yeah, tell me about it.
“Why the fuck does that matter now? We made it, right? We’re here?” Dean gestures as if to say,
Dean looks over at Cas, who’s been nodding off in a chair at 2 PM. Cas hasn’t been sleeping much—has been trying to stay up all night to watch over Dean like he used to, even though the human element means he’s now physically incapable of doing so. He’s still got the motel room, technically, but he’s spent about a good five minutes there since Dean arrived at the hospital. Dean keeps telling him it’s okay, he can go rest, sleep in a real bed—besides, keeping a room they’re not using is basically hemorrhaging money for no good reason—but Sam and Cas go out to talk alone sometimes and once, Dean overheard Sam saying that Cas should stay at the hospital if he wants, but it’s important to have a place to rest if he needs, and that Sam could take over Dean duty for a few hours, no worries. That’s what he’d said.
“I could go on,” Dean says. Sam keep staring at him. “Yeah. I’m done.”
“Dance?” Cas pulls back to inspect Dean’s face, his eyes wide and confused.
“Of course I do,” he says, but he says it carefully. “I love hunting. You know that.”
“Good to have hobbies, I guess.”
“Sleeping with a man? A relationship? A relationship with a man?”
All he can think to say is, “I… I sweat too.”
“I miss the trench coat,” Dean says, and halfway through saying it he starts to laugh, which instantly turns into a sob. He buries his face in Cas’s neck, holds him as close as possible.
—that Cas would shush him. Dean wonders vaguely if Jack still watches
“You ready?” he says.
(holds it up)
Over the next few days, they hang around and work on the house—Dean is almost done hanging drywall on the ceiling, thank Christ, just one more room to go—and then it’s interview day.
“No excuse,” he says.
“And how do you know that, huh? Cas is dead, Dean. He’s supposed to be in Heaven. What did you do?”
Around 7 PM, they walk to The Club, just a ten minute walk from the hotel on some sidewalk and a lot of grass. It stands alone, a few yards away from a gas station. Outside, it looks like a ramshackle barn. Inside it also looks like a ramshackle barn, but with a tattooed bartender. A small assortment of grizzled older men sit at the bar, all nursing beers, at least one seat between each of them, and a few younger men sit together in the booths on the other side of the room. There’s a small, empty stage at one end and a pool table at the other. Dean feels at home here. Then he notices there’s a lot of art on the walls—neon beer signs, the anarchist symbol, a moderately-size print of the “if I die of AIDS forget burial” photograph that Dean has seen a couple times before. A pride flag.
“Literally how are these dots getting connected, Columbo?” Dean stands with great effort, trying not to groan like an old man. He doesn’t have much luck.
INT. KITCHEN - MORNING (DAY 3)
Oh, well, that's - that's very flattering. Thank you.
Yeah. Honestly that doesn't bother me.
The crowd goes fucking crazy for some reason.
“Uneventful?” Dean says, turning to look around as he backs out of the parking space. “Come on, you didn’t tell anybody?”
“I love you, Cas,” he says breathlessly. “Always have. Always.”
“I thought you loved the old Gas-N-Sip.” Dean pats him on the back, grinning. The back of Cas’s neck turns just slightly red. “Don’t I recall you saying something about finding meaning there? Dignity?”
The work strikes a bit of fear into Dean’s heart from across the room. It’s not like it’s not a date—and it’s a little late in the game to be worried about that kind of terminology. They did plenty of date-like activities over the summer, and even had sex during or after most of them. But the fancy restaurant kind of dating is a different phenomenon.
“To eat I would have to get up. Which I don’t want to do. Because I feel shitty. Hence no eating.”
Cas has never had a cold. The sickest he’s ever really been is a bad hangover. There’s the angel stuff, of course—when Cas was laid up with grace problems while Dean was off fucking around with Crowley—but that’s different, right? That illness wasn’t combined with the inherent pathetic situation of being a human unaccustomed to regular human happenstance. Nobody can do anything about this.
Nothing. Seems like it breaks upon, you know, combustion, at least. I'll have to call Rowena too and ask if she knows anything.
- and - yeah. You two...
“… My shoulder being hurt?”
He still has to shove it down, the thought of marrying Cas. He needs to take this a day at a time. Right now, it’s fine as it is, and there’s no need to change it. Not like anything would be functionally different if they were married—in fact, it would probably be exactly the same. It’s just the word. Married. Married. Dean Winchester, married. To Cas. He rubs his face again, hard.
Cas brightens, dumps a bag out on the table.
“What?” Naomi? “Naomi?” What?
“Too quickly?” Dean laughs as he turns around, takes Cas’s hands in his own. “Cas, baby, it’s been like twelve years. We’re honeymooning. I think we’ve earned it.”
“You know I don’t think ahead much, Sammy.” Dean scratches his nose. “Why should I, huh? Maybe he’ll just go away again. Maybe—maybe he’ll die. Maybe you’ll die. Hell, maybe I’ll die! And now that the gates to the afterlife are welded shut, maybe that’ll just be it. Or maybe Cas’ll have a grand old time with me on the road, sure, and then in a few months he’ll decide he’s had enough of me. Go off to greener pastures. You know, meet some other folks who aren’t so cruel. I’m not gonna change my life for someone who’s halfway out the door.”
It's not gonna happen, though.
Dean takes his fist out of his mouth.
They haven’t watched an episode of
“He suggested you might take some notes from his performance. He thinks you might be interested in becoming a drag queen. Well—not right now. But if you
“If you
“What about you?” he says, easing back out of his head and into the conversation, trying to wipe Jack from his thoughts again. “What have you been up to?”
“If we’re sharing private and vulnerable information,” Cas says, “there’s something I should tell you.” He pulls back and gets out of bed, heads toward a pile of clothes, not the ones they just took off. Starts digging around. Dean has no fucking clue what Cas is looking for, what he’s about to say. A nervous feeling pools in his stomach. What, is he, like, cheating somehow? Is he gonna pull out some angel coin that says
“We’d love to,” says Cas, “right, Dean?”
“You know,” says Sam thoughtfully, “we could actually put religious service on here—that might explain some of the gaps. Well, it’s one big gap. But you know what I mean. We could have a little bit of work history, then say you were a member of the clergy for a decade or so, and that you broke with the church pretty recently. You wouldn’t even really have to lie. And people would probably feel weird asking you about it.”
“Whoa, sorry,” he says. “I, uh—I don’t know what’s—”
“Gregory has told me a great deal about gay culture,” Cas says, with absolutely no clue as to why it might be weird for a nearly fifty-year-old gay man not to know anything about gay culture. “He’s an excellent resource and a—what did you say about Emily and Safiya? A hoot and a half.”
“You can’t keep waiting until things get bad to tell me how you feel.” Cas looks away, looks around the room. “I’m here now. For as long as you’ll have me. And you can’t expect me to guess what you’re thinking. I thought I had… I thought we had made a mistake. If I don’t know how you feel, how can we move forward?”
“Instead, dickwad, somewhere along the line an unbonded sentinel found out, and came over to check me out.”
“Scenting, Dean. It’s called scenting.”
“This is what’s going to happen.  I will take you as far as the next town of Rockridge, where you will be the sheriff’s guest while I make my escape.”
Castiel noticed the less than steady journey of his beverage, and shot him a concerned look.  Dean was tempted to reply with his trademark wink but his flirtation skills had eloped with his cheeky confidence, leaving him somewhat naked to that piercing stare.  Not to mention that voice.
Castiel’s penetrating look seemed to intensify, which sent all kinds of shivers down Dean’s spine.
“I’m sorry, I’m not doing this right. I guess I’m just anxious. They are not going to disapprove, but my brothers can be a bit....” Words failed.
The little frown was back and he looked even more sombre, clearly expecting some outrage from Dean. Instead relief flooded him.
Dean has been ostentatiously crossing the dates off on his work calendar just to drive the point home, smirking at his colleagues’ exasperated head shakes.  Not that he was remotely fooling Bobby, who was kind enough not to expose his bullcrap to the whole workplace, though the muttered ‘idjit’ did escape his whiskery lips on several occasions.
“Please, no need for that.  In fact” – looking somewhat sheepish – “I should be the one apologising.  I’m not quite sure how to deal with the situation.  You see, obviously I knew today was the day, but I... uhm, this is going to come across badly, I know, but... I was actively hiding out.”
? Before Dean’s brain had caught up, his view was filled with a rapidly expanding net fired in his direction. Dean tried to evade it, but snuggled as he was against one of the chimneys he was trapped against it. As he struggled to escape the mesh without falling off the roof, he could see the goon had landed a few feet away, still safely connected to his abseiling kit and quickly advancing on his position. Shit!
There was a quiet intensity to those last three words. It was obvious what Castiel was saying, and Dean was determined not to give anything away, even though something warm and welcome had unfurled inside his very being. Fuzzy feelings were all well and good (
*******
Well, it hadn’t taken as long as Dean hoped for the shit to hit the fan. He didn’t catch the start of Crowley’s rousing speech, but as the volume increased the last part became loud and clear. Any other time he’d find it amusing, but the stakes were a little too high for comfort. He wiped his sweating palms on his jeans, made sure he was tucked well out of sight, and remained hyper vigilant.
There was a visible release of tension from Martinez’s massive shoulders and his eyes softened when he looked at Dean.
Castiel sighed, rubbing his tired face with both hands. The last case had kept him up at all hours, and he was too tired to have this conversation. But then, he was finding excuses to put it off and maybe now was as good a time as any.
“Hello, Dean.”
“Hardly. But anyone who forks out a substantial amount of money for something, tends to appreciate it a lot more than someone who gets it for nothing. My buyers are rich. They have to be to afford my prices. They are the ones who did
“It’s called teasing me to death, Cas! Can we get down to it already?”
“I know it was just a minor surgical procedure, but in my experience it is best not to eat something so rich immediately after. Perhaps some sweet tea and...”
Castiel tried to ignore the painful disappointment that had suddenly hollowed him out. Dean was upset, and rightly so.
He could picture Sam’s bitch face at the other end, and sure enough,
Oh, this was going swimmingly. If drowning was your end goal. Dean rubbed his forehead, wondering what other spanner he could throw in the works.
“You know” – in a conspiratorial whisper that nonetheless carries all the way to Castiel himself, and is clearly meant to do so – “he told me the most awful stories about his intended.  Now,” – palms splayed out wide in the universal gesture of not judging – “I can’t assert whether any of it was true, but he made me want to believe it, that’s for sure.  And that’s saying something.  I mean, you can imagine, right, how many men have spun me a tale, but I ain’t never heard anything so... heartfelt and believable.  But... I have a job to do and now I’ve done it.  But I’m mighty glad to pass that responsibility onto my colleague when he gets here tomorrow.”
Cas nodded in a this-is-a-perfectly-sensible-strategy way and admitted that “Gabriel warned me of my mother’s plans for today, and kindly offered his flat in order for me to escape them.”
Dean watched with a frown. “What the hell’s the matter? These are delicious!”
“Sure, but who will believe you?  It’s my word against yours, and between you and me, I think I know how to work a room better.” – He grins impishly – “Come on, Cas, give it up.”
“Sentinel Novak, is everything ok?”
“That would be lovely, thank you.  Perhaps also introductions.  My name is Castiel Novak.”
“Yes.  I mean no, I didn’t always want to be one.  I’d like to be a teacher.”
Dean saunters over with a nonchalant sway “Sooo, want to get our story straight for the town’s busybodies?”
Cas watched him narrowly, as if he thought Dean was taking the piss. But Dean was merely excited, and ok, maybe a little bit nervous. Not about the sex part, obviously, but he didn’t really know much about the process. He might have, in moments of intrigued curiosity, have visited a few porn sites devoted to sentinel/guide bonding, and yeah, ok, he was aware that it was hardly research (though he could still remember that one with the really hot sentinel bringing the guide off with the best rimming scene he’d ever seen and wondered if that might be in his immediate future).
Dean followed Ania via the exit through the garage, and they were in the unmarked FBI SUV and driving out through the back of the house in barely a couple of minutes.
Dean had been so angry he hadn’t realised how damned hungry he was. He wasn’t about to try and run away on an empty stomach.
When Cas ended the call, Dean’s evil grin convinced him that the community was going to get that kick up the backside, and about time too.
Castiel’s brows furrow further – “I’m twenty eight.”
“Yeah, well, it still ain’t me. So good luck and all that. I have to get back to work.”
Dean had introduced him to Sam, and spent the next twenty minutes rolling his eyes and fake gagging at Sam’s fangirling, causing what Castiel understood was a par for the course spat between them. If his sentinel senses hadn’t alerted him, he might have been worried at their exchange of expletives. He marvelled at the differences between these siblings and his own. Underneath the bickering it was clear their love was genuine, and he envied their easy familiarity.
“I might, you know, go for coffee with him, or something.”
Bobby followed him and at Dean’s eyebrow raise he said – “I ain’t leaving you with the creepy one.”
He respected the sentiment and understood that his parents wanted to make Dean feel welcome. Of course that also meant his brothers wouldn’t feel so fettered in a more private setting. His parents had stressed how important this dinner would be, and Castiel couldn’t help thinking, gauging their reactions as only a sentinel could, that such admonition had done little more than stoke their mischievous spirits. Michael’s elevated heart beat and slight flushing alone did not bode well for the evening. Well, if they were willing to poke at a wasps’ nest, they had to deal with the stings.
, Dean liked hearing his name from those lips.  And oh hey, now he had a chance to look, he
Castiel’s heart was thudding in his chest. Dean looked so conflicted he could not tell what he was likely to say, and the wait was torture.
Mr Walker confirmed that he was aware of the problem, since the dweller of number 19 (that’s exactly what he called him, as if even mentioning the name was painful to him – I mean, they were talking about Crowley, so yeah) had informed him of the problem at 6.30 am.  He wondered if he was the one who had so enthusiastically woken him up earlier, and decided that he would also forever now term him ‘the dweller of number 19’, like some creature from the pit.  Why was he surrounded by assholes?  I mean, he made a point to avoid the limey bastard, and he still felt that disrupting his sleep at the butt crack of dawn was somehow ok.  Or, hey, maybe that’s why he did it.  Son of a bitch.
One flight up the marble staircase (
Cas wasted no time in informing everyone of the situation. The unknown sentinel had been identified. Mr Crowley was outwardly a very successful businessman, but both the NYPD and the FBI had reason to believe he was involved in a variety of criminal activities, not least of which was guide trafficking. There was no direct evidence, unfortunately, but in the past eight months some of his closest ‘business associates’ had been implicated in an FBI case that ended with the recovery of fifty nine guides held captive in five different isolated locations in the country. Mr Crowley and his cadre of lawyers had simply claimed that he was unaware of the extracurricular activities of his associates, and since there was no proof and none of the accused had involved him, notwithstanding the generous incentives, the law enforcement agencies had nothing to pin on him. And this was not the first time he had slipped through the net.
Cas added.
***********
“What the hell did you do to me?”
There’ll be hell to pay once Cas got here, but Dean was going to start without him.
“I don’t know if anyone has had a chance to tell you, but agent Dziadulewicz is under suspension pending a full investigation.”
The agent shook his hand and smiled. Dean smiled back, then shook Martinez’s hand. Martinez was majorly ripped, and no suit was going to hide that bulk, which pretty much advertised ‘mess at your own risk’. So did his face. Serious and focused, his silence a bit disturbing. Ania was pretty much everything Martinez wasn’t. For a start she was a hot chick. As tall as Dean, with long legs and raven locks, and a smile that could turn most people’s knees to jelly. Dean’s preferences tended to veer towards guys, but he had enjoyed sex with women as well. If Cas hadn’t been in the picture, he would certainly be tapping that. Something must have shown in his face, Martinez’s fake cough jolting him from his musings.
“You ain’t picking him back up?”
There was a lull as that thought sunk in, together with a pleasant loosening of tension inside Dean.
“And if I don’t agree? Would you accept it and let it go?”
Dean skewered him with a glare.
Castiel’s annoyed squint conveys his thoughts perfectly.  Oh, so this is how it’s going to be?  Wouldn’t be the first time someone tried to pass himself off as an agent.
A flutter of red caught his eye and he watched this large maple leaf gently sway its way down a few feet away.  Well, that was a beauty, and Dean stepped over to it, bending down to retrieve it.  And met another hand doing the same.
He loved his family. He really did, in a reserved, non touching, no PDA kind of way. He was simply going to replace the fifty thousand dollars as soon as he got a chance, and keep his mouth shut about the guide until Dean got in touch with him (he tried not to think of the ‘if’). No point giving his family false hope.
They both smiled into their coffees.  Then the full weight of what happened seemed to hit Dean anew.
bad.  He’s pretty sure his life is in no danger, but he needs to puncture Dean’s confidence and convince him to release him.  Dragging a prisoner with him is not practical – it will attract unwanted attention and require explanations, and possibly cause delay to Dean’s escape plans.  And they can hardly avoid all hamlets and towns since they’ll need revictualling.  He has to admit that Dean is handling himself pretty well out here, but he still doesn’t think that would include knowing how to hunt his own food.  He is a city boy, after all.
And what looked to be a drinks cabinet behind the desk. Except Dean knew Mr Novak senior prided himself on not touching the stuff, kept harping on about his youthful looks being due to a sober life and exercise and yada yada yada. Unless he was a total hypocrite (and let’s face it, that would hardly be a shocker) as well as a tedious narcissist, this cabinet looked a little out of place.
Dean smirked.  “Were those his exact words?  Because what he said to me was...”
He didn’t like the confident look on the sentinel as he replied.
“Look, I don’t know what to tell you. The guy’s ... nice” – he cringed at the blandness of that statement, but he was not used to expressing attraction beyond the limits of a good one night stand – “and what he said about Sammy... This would be good for him.”
“Really? What tipped you off? Was it the kidnapping of a five year old child to blackmail her mother?”
He does not expect the laughter.  Dean holds onto his shoulder while his own are shaking.
Dean was only allowed a quick impression of a large mansion, with soft outdoor lights illuminating key features of the grounds and house, including a fountain of frolicking nymphs, before he was quickly bustled inside and escorted to a large lavish living room with patio doors looking out into the gardens.
There’s a twinkle in Dean’s eyes.  Dean’s smile is contagious and before he knows it his own lips are twitching upwards.  He can’t even remember the last time that happened.
And as Dean was about to angrily dispute this he raised his hands in a conciliatory manner.
Castiel’s smile was like the bloody sun, he looked so damn happy. Just that made Dean narrow his eyes and give him the stink eye. If anything that made Castiel beam even more. Wanker.
“What can I help you with, Mister...?”
He extricated himself from the hood of the car he was currently elbows deep in and looked up to Bobby’s worried face. His ‘some-shit-has-hit-the-fan’ face. Dean sighed. He had a bad feeling about this. Which was quickly confirmed when a man detached himself from behind Bobby and smiled at him. In a cat who got the cream way. Shit.
Whatever reaction he expected, it was not the puzzled look on both brothers. Michael’s eyes shot to the newcomer.
“Don’t worry. So long as you don’t object to my giving as good as I get, I’m up for it.”
“You know what I’m talking about, right? I can tell you do.”
“Gabriel has been trying to set me up with you for ages.”
Ok, when Dean had texted him to arrange a meeting he had not envisaged an angry Dean gripping his coat lapels and slamming him into the nearest wall. Not that he minded. He had never been this close to him and the heady rush he was feeling was almost making him light headed. Dean must have noticed something. He let go and brushed the coat clumsily, then stepped back, looking at anything except Castiel. He started pacing, rubbing the back of his neck and looking really awkward.
He eased himself into the atrium, and blessed that pretentious interior design article for giving him such an insight into the layout of the mansion (
Dean rolled his eyes as Crowley picked up a dainty silver hand bell and shook it. Like some fucking Edwardian toff rather than the criminal douchebag he was. Muscled behemoth number two, also known as Mitch, entered and proceeded to usher Dean out of the room and up the double staircase. Dean would appreciate this fine house a lot more if it wasn’t filled with Crowley’s men, and all the surreptitious looks he cast around for possible escape routes just highlighted the tight security of the place.
“Come now, they appreciate quality, as do I. That’s not a crime, is it?”
He gives Dean a couple of minutes to wrap his mind around that one, before he makes his suggestion.  Timing is critical.  He can see the moment when Dean’s worried, confused expression (
“What? Spit it out!”
Dean groaned. Now all he wanted to do was kick that Crowley bastard in the nuts. Cas appeared in the doorway with a coffee that smelled divine and a slice of cherry pie that made Dean’s mouth water. Hell, the doc wasn’t the only one who could read minds.
“I would never force you into anything. If you wish we could try to stay away from each other, see if this spontaneous pre-bonding can fade away with time.”
“We are not going there, so drop it!”
Dean wasted no time in ridding himself of his t-shirt and boxers, slipping in bed and trying to get as much of his skin plastered to Cas as possible. After some fevered fondling Dean came up for air.
Some idiotic part of his brain chose this moment to point out that there was a sentinel in the room, looking mighty fine. The light of the moon illuminated the room, casting tasteful and artistic shadows across Castiel Novak’s features, which someone with more aesthetic proclivities could admire at leisure.
His veneer of professionalism is further disturbed when Dean’s fingers move from his lips and begin to pat him down.  His other hand is also busy checking his left trouser pocket.  The hands reverse position and there’s a “Aha!” as Dean finds Castiel’s credentials in the inner pocket of his coat.  Dean unfolds the document and reads it carefully.  It’s on embossed letterhead confirming Castiel’s identity as a bone fide agent.  Castiel does not like the smile Dean gives him as he folds the letter back into its envelope and slips it into his own inner jacket pocket.
*******
“..... by now? Why isn’t it working?”
“Haven’t had the pleasure.”
one.”
“Figured as much.”
Dean was frustrated to see that Castiel had listened carefully but did not in any way look dejected. In fact he had that look that clearly implied he had answers to Dean’s objections. Well, let’s see how he could argue around that obvious issue.
Cas went straight to Dean, checking he was ok before turning his attention to his wayward siblings. Dean had never seen Cas angry, and he admitted it was fucking hot. He leant back against his baby and prepared to be entertained. He was not disappointed. He surreptitiously adjusted himself a couple of times during the thorough verbal thrashing the brothers were subjected to. It was not all fun, though. He knew that sentinel was trouble, and so did Cas.
Dean nodded to Bobby, who looked between the two of them, and moved back reluctantly out of hearing range, but not out of sight. Dean got a surge of warm fuzzy feelings for his friend’s protectiveness, but tamped them down when he perceived that the sentinel has caught them as well. Freaking emotional peeping tom.
When Castiel spoke again, Dean took a moment to realise he was continuing the conversation.
Sammy was practically bouncing on the spot, looking like he was going to explode if Dean didn’t answer immediately. Well, shit, this was going to be awkward. Dean scratched the back of his neck, realising too late that this was an obvious tell. As soon as his eyes met Sammy’s he knew his brother had noticed.
The problem was that his parents had always considered him the sensible one of the family, and though they had tried to be level headed and just in the handling of their brood, Castiel’s version of whatever trouble had arisen was often the one believed. And not just because he was a sentinel. This had resulted in a far more fair dispensation of family justice, but had hardly endeared him to his brothers. Some sibling resentment still lingered, and he was not as close to them as they were to each other.
“Is that so? You know the houses set up for sentinel and guide abuse. Do you really believe that most of the inmates have been victims of kidnapping, that they were sold off on the black market, that they were force bonded? I hate to shatter your idealistic illusions, but I have access to confidential information on those places, and the background of both victim and perpetrator, which I’m happy to share with you.”
“Geez, it’s like you don’t know me at all. And in my defence I don’t exactly keep my finger on the pulse of sentinel-guide news. You know I avoid all that shit as much as possible.”
“How about we take a break now. Don’t know about you, but I could murder a burger.”
“Interesting that
Dean waved him in and gestured to another chair at the table, but the agent politely declined.
God, he needed a coffee! He got up to get one before remembering that oh, right.
“I’m sorry, Cas. It was a dick move to take it out on you. I’m just kinda freaked here.”
“Fifty years old, smooth as silk. Sure I can’t tempt you?”
*******
“Tell him about mine too while you’re at it!”
He brought the glass to his lips, looking at Dean over the rim to gauge his interest. Dean crossed his arms and refused to give him the satisfaction. Crowley gave a little nonchalant shrug and continued.
He ran out the door and round the corner to the back where he had hidden the Impala behind a cluster of rose bushes, dived inside, revved up the engine and shot out of the Novak estate as fast as his baby could take him. He slowed down once back on public roads and carefully made his way home, heart still pounding from the narrow escape.
“Gabriel is driving me crazy.”
“And how do you propose to make this farce believable?”
“I could give you a list of all the coffee shops that are sentinel friendly. And restaurants. He might want to make it more than coffee. And he should get to know what you are like when you eat. If that doesn’t put him off, nothing will.”
Dean squeezed his hand and smiled.  Yeah, hopefully all the time of their lives.
“We might at last be able to pin something on this bastard. If he wants me, I can be the bait.”
“’cause he doesn’t, dummy. You’ve been had.”
But here is where the problems began. Dean spent most of the time acting as mediator between the agents and the sentinel when frustration would get the better of either. Cas was unhappy with most of their suggestions, which he felt placed Dean too much at risk. But Dean knew he had to put himself out there in order for a trap to work, and Cas’ tendency to insist on more protection was hindering any possible plan.
Cas’ mouth twitched, confirming that no matter the vocabulary Dean had been pretty much spot on.
“I noticed the car leaving. A classic car, very likely 1960s, black or dark blue. As you can imagine, not many of those around, say, a couple of hundred miles from our residence.”
well with his life until he tried to get himself some.  Neither the toaster nor the coffee maker were displaying signs of life.  The light switch was the next obvious route to go, and the lack of brightness in the kitchen seemed to send his mood into a pit of darkness.  No, he was not being a drama queen.  He could not function without coffee first thing in the morning, and what with the ass-a-clock call he was beginning to think this was fate’s way of getting back at him for slighting her.  Bitch.
The man tilted his head in an endearingly bird like motion.  “Yes?  I mean yes.”
He caught the agents’ expressions. Martinez was as stoic as ever, except for – yes, that was definitely the shadow of a smile just teasing his lips – and Ania was smirking, lifting her hands to show eight fingers. Dean snorted, spraying a few crumbs, ridiculously pleased to score eight on their grossness scale. Hey, waiting was boring, and they had devised little games to pass the time. It turns out they had a lot in common and the agent was surprisingly good at this game. He was just glad Cas had never come into the kitchen while they were scoring grossness points off each other. It was not a pretty sight, but it was hilarious.
Crap, of course a sentinel would be in some goodie two shoes profession. But why couldn’t he be a damn firefighter? Unbidden, Dean’s November entry on his calendar appeared with Castiel’s baby blues staring out at him, all smudged soot and grease and sweat. Fuck. He caught Castiel’s nostrils flaring in surprise, then a pleased little smile which he tried to hide by ducking his head. Yeah, fucking peeping tom.
Wow, that voice was making it difficult to walk. Dean nodded, not trusting his own voice, and scampered inelegantly to the en suite bathroom. Everything felt heightened, the colours around him sharper. He was very aware of his own breathing and the prickle of sweat at the back of his neck.
Luke was about to open his mouth but without even turning in his direction his father lifted an admonishing finger –
Dean eventually resurfaced at nearly ten in the morning.  Screw it, this was his kind-of-holiday.  He shuffled to the bathroom and emerged feeling a little more human and ready to (possibly) battle the day.  Toast and coffee would reaffirm his sense that all was well with his life, and all
As Dean managed to wriggle out of the net he could see from the corner of his eye the unconscious guy being winched upwards. Dean quickly eyed the copter and yep, there was another one getting ready to abseil down to replace goon number one. Crap! He just managed to grab the net, wondering if he could use it against him, when goon two’s boots landed with a thud a few feet away. Dean leant his back against the chimney, adjusted his foot hold, held tight onto the net, and prepared to hold off the bastard as long as he could.
“Actually, I am a detective with the NYPD, so the information was gained through perfectly legal channels.”
Dean’s eyes snapped open. Wow, this guide shit was really weird. And fucking intense. He could still feel the phantom touch of Cas’ fingers, his startled eyes looking into his own. And that connection was still there, lingering in the back of his mind. Would this be enough for Cas to find him? He had to believe it. And whatever happened, he had to delay Crowley’s departure. Whatever the power of this link, he wasn’t sure it could survive a long distance separation. And Crowley definitely was counting on that.
Cas and Dean waited until everyone had simmered down a little. Dean was uncharacteristically serious.
And Dean could sense the fury from ... Crowley, it was Crowley.
Dean deflated, his pent up frustration going nowhere. He’d had enough about
A flurry of activity followed. The original ruse involved more safeguards of course, but notwithstanding the unexpected turn of events, they could still proceed as planned. Except there was no signal coming from Dean’s implant. Castiel tried to keep calm as the agents attempted to rectify the situation, checking all the equipment several times before admitting that something was blocking the signal.
“Nothing gets past you, Cas. And all this talk about licking sure ain’t helping.”
The writing is going better than I thought, so here's an extra chapter for this week.  If this continues I might be able to update twice a week.
“Yeah, no, let’s not. How about we go to a decent coffee shop instead.”
He stopped.  What was he doing?  The whole point was to not interact physically with anyone on this day.  He shivered when he realised he had just barely stopped himself from... what?  Confronting fate?  Maybe meeting his soulmate?  Ugh!  Too early in the morning to think this through!  Which would be just the kind of trick fate would throw at him.  You know what?  He had no reason to answer the door.  No one who knocked at that time had any right to expect it.  Fuck ‘em.  He meandered back to his room and climbed gratefully into bed.  The next time he heard knocking, it was on his neighbour’s door.  Good.  He never liked Mrs Murray, and he smiled as he thought of her rude awakening.
“So my father sent you, ha?  Do you have a name to go with those baby blues?”
Castiel feels a
“Come back to bed after, Dean.”
“You have a brother, Sam, am I right? He’s an intelligent young man and you have high hopes for him. How about...”
“Ok, ok, how about this? You guys mentioned earlier putting a chip on me.” And as Cas was about to remind him – “Yeah, I know, that won’t work if they force me to change clothes, but what about those subcute... whatever you call those under the skin jobs? If it’s well hidden they might miss it.”
“Well, what the hell did you mean then?”
Reality flooded back and he almost screamed in frustration as the image of Dean disappeared and the room and its occupants returned. But Dean had left something behind. He could feel it, like a thread linking them, guiding him. Cas knew he could find him now.
Cas had been delighted when Gabe had offered to help. He had a keen mind and it was good to see his interest engaged. But his mischievous nature and his sharp wit had already ruffled quite a few feathers, and Cas found himself spending way too much time having to smooth them.
He looks up and freezes.  Agent Novak is casually leaning against the hitching post, and Dean’s brain does a complicated mix of delight and dread.
But even as that thought went through his mind, he clearly heard Crowley’s voice bidding everyone be still and quiet. The general hubbub died down at once and an eerie silence descended. Dean could hear his own elevated heart beat and tried to breathe slowly and calmly, but that went to shit when he heard Crowley’s clear tones.
“It’s not something you are likely to come across in your research, Sam, but even perfectly healthy bonds can be broken. Unsurprisingly it’s something the community tends to keep quiet about. It’s only recently that there has even been open acknowledgement about instances of abuse, by both sentinels and guides.”
“So what you’re saying is that we’d both be Stepford wives.”
The frown eased and the man smiled a shy little smile.
His shaky voice belied the truth, and when he opened his eyes, there was the man, his overwhelming presence almost too much to take in.  Almost.  Some primal part of his mind (the one that wasn’t currently running around trying to find its metaphorical ass) was definitely appreciating the aesthetic jackpot before him, because
voice.  He tells himself to get a grip and quickly sets everything ready for the both of them.
His head was pounding. He knew he shouldn’t have gone, but it was a special night and, well he didn’t want to disappoint them. Or be worried. So he didn’t feel bad about the pretend phone call and having to rush to a crime scene. He’d tell them tomorrow and they’d huff at him and tell him off, and go on at him about getting himself a guide, and... he could see that whole age old argument rearing its head again, and that just made his own throb with dread.
“No, it’s cool. Curious as to what passes as decent grub for sentinels” – and at Castiel’s warm smile – “in an
His “Hey, Cas” comes out a little strangled.
kinda curiosity. I warned you, don’t get any ideas.”
“Dean, I don’t want to fight about this. I just want you to be happy, and I feel like you are sabotaging yourself here.”
Dean was not the type to back down, even if he was pretty sure Castiel did not mean it as a challenge.
) Not that Castiel was doing much better. Damn the sentinel, he was throwing Dean off his game. As soon as he had clapped eyes on him, his face had lit up with delight and anticipation. Part of Dean was looking forward to wiping that look off his face, but mostly he was aware that expectation was going to be short of reality, and frankly the sooner this happened the better for both of them.
“Soooo” – he drawls, looking cheekily confident, thumbs hooked into his belt loops – “it was a good effort but I finally caught you,
“Yeah, no kidding. You may not know this, but the Guide Sanctuary actually has a sister wing in Seattle for abused sentinels. Our lovely community keeps that part quiet even now. Wouldn’t do for the public image of all American superhuman sentinel shit. It’s their dirty little secret.”
Castiel’s eyes flashed dangerously at his brother’s dismissive attitude of his guide (uhm, ok, not
“Well, yes, zoning is still a concern if a sentinel focuses too much on something. Again, it’s only a problem if their guide is not around.”
He collapsed back down with a huff, the settee echoing it with its own.  Maybe he should just write off the whole day, and burrow back into his bed.
Dean could practically taste the frustrated anger emanating from Crowley.
Castiel initially hoped that charges might be levelled at the sentinel for impersonating a Guide Services officer. Until it turned out that at no stage had he actually done this. What did transpire was that in their eagerness to stick it to Dean and Castiel, the brothers had been stupid enough to disgorge all their information to the charming man who had called them on the phone, whose only real disclosure had been that he was aware of the situation. He had never claimed to act on anyone’s authority and the brothers had not asked for any identification when they met up with him. How quickly news had leaked from Guide Services was somewhat worrying, but Dean doubted that Cas’ brothers had been subtle in their communications and as that little shit Luke said, it
“We had a break in a couple of days ago. No one was home at the time, but I got back earlier than expected. Well, certainly earlier than the thief expected.”
“Right, I take it your little scheme was to embarrass us. Don’t see how, exactly, since it’s not mandatory to register with Guide Services. So what the fuck?”
“Likewise.”
One thing was certain. He needed to talk to Sammy.
), then the third door on the left wing. It wasn’t even locked. Dean shook his head as he entered, a lopsided smirk on his face. A plain room with minimum furniture, nothing to distract the occupant from work. A beautiful old oak desk (
Cas collapsed on the couch with a grunt, throwing his briefcase down next to him. Dean sauntered over with a couple of beers and handed him one.
“I suspect you gave your teachers a lot of... ‘shit’.  Shovels full.” – Dean chuckles into his coffee – “And then charmed your way out of trouble.”
He was sure that was going to stick in any sentinel’s craw, but instead he was startled again by Castiel’s laughter.
“My family is rich. Your brother would want for nothing. He could go to the best university. His life would be everything you ever wanted for him. And yes, I would ask you to move to New York with me, but there’s no reason you couldn’t be a mechanic there if you wanted. You could even open your own business.”
“The power is out in my apartment!  Is it out in yours?”
“Sorry” – Castiel managed at last, sounding incredibly amused and not in the least bit sorry – “sentinel friendly establishments have to cater to the lowest common denominator.”
Castiel was moving before he even registered it. A warm hand cupped Dean’s cheek, surprising him into eye contact.
Castiel’s smile never failed to cause a storm of butterflies in his stomach.
“Dean, you could never be anything but yourself. And I wouldn’t want it any other way.”
Dean stares at him, midway cleaning the pot.  “Dude, you’ve clearly never met Michael Milton.”
At last he spotted a faint light approaching the end of the drive, soon followed by the black bulk of an SUV, the boring, safe trademark car of Mr Novak senior. It slowed down just before taking the right into the dark country road, revealing in its wake the next vehicle, a silver hybrid monstrosity driven by Castiel Novak, chosen purely for its sentinel friendly features and therefore being a butt ugly piece of work. Next came Michael’s red convertible Ferrari, and bringing up the rear was the flashy yellow Lamborghini Aventador that Gabriel drove. There was a surge of admiration for such a beauty, and then a twinge of shame at admiring another car while sitting in the Impala. He guiltily stroked the dashboard and whispered a few endearments to his baby.
“...Ania?”
Dean shook his head in exasperation. The stupid assholes had no idea. Just as he was about to lay into him, possibly physically, Cas’ car arrived on the scene. His silent sentinel ninja car. Both brothers jumped at the sudden arrival, making Dean smirk.
Dean whirled on him, snarling, his hands white knuckled fists.
Luke smirked. “Well, now we know why he’s interested in you.”
have a sweet ride.”
A sombre silence descended which Gabriel broke – “So what happens now?”
He carefully hugged the wall and made his way along more slowly than he liked, wondering if at any moment he was going to hear a shout of discovery, until he came to the lowest edge of the roof, which he now could easily reach. He hefted himself the short distance and scrambled up on all fours. Once he reached the first chimney, he checked to make sure which angle would hide him best from anyone searching for him from below, but still give him a reasonable view of anyone trying to reach him. He settled down and prayed that the delay would be enough.
They fell into each other’s arms, while agents poured in and spread out throughout the mansion.
“Mr Winchester?” – and at Dean’s nod – “just checking your electrics have come back on.”
“And if that doesn’t work, he’ll probably just sit on the little bugger.”
Dean froze while grabbing an extra mug.  “Gabriel’s brother?”
Dean had never experienced such intense body worship and was soon reduced to a puddle of sated overstimulated goo. The connection slowly cementing between them was adding to the swirl of sensations, yet at no stage did he feel overwhelmed, but rather revelled in knowing he was so cherished. It felt like coming home.
Cas’ smile was practically incandescent. And like the sun, it radiated warmth into Dean. He felt Cas’ hands on his, stilling his fidgeting, and they sat like that, comforted and complete in each other’s company.
Serious eyebrow raise from Dean, still not sure he could pronounce that mouthful.
!  But maybe the guy wasn’t quite as calm and collected as he sounded, because he looked, well, kinda like Dean felt.
“There’s two of Castiel’s brothers asking to see you. And some guy I really don’t like the look of tagging along.”
Clearly Dean’s face is reflecting some of his inner struggles.
“What the ever loving fuck?”
“Most of those offenders are law enforcement officers, members of the army, and other such glorious ‘protectors’. And do you know why? Because being so fawned upon by our society, they get first pick of guides. That kind of entitlement breeds contempt, my dear. They don’t have to pay for them, or god forbid, bother to get to know them. They are just there so that they can do their glorious work, and if for some reason they fall short of expectation or might have wishes and opinions of their own, well, jolly bad luck.”
Cas was true to his promise and at no stage did he utter the word ‘copulation’, although ‘fuck’ did slip through breathless lips on several occasions.
He tried not to wonder what was taking so long for the rescue party to get here. Maybe they were still on the way or were planning the best time to make their move. Or maybe Ania had been forced to reveal the presence of the chip. His hand automatically went to the back of his neck, which he realised was ridiculous since there was no way he could tell if the chip was working just by touch. Still, feeling the little bump felt like a promise of rescue, a physical link to his sentinel. He sighed and leaned back in the chair. It was late and this whole day had been exhausting. He levered himself up from the table with some effort, and was too tired to even bother with his usual routine. He just lay on the bed and was out like a light.
Well, of course the good little boy scout had worked out all his arguments in advance. Hell, so had Dean. Although he was finding it hard to rebut him. He definitely thought there would be a lot more arguing back and forth about this, instead it was practically dismissed at once as irrelevant. Dean was sure his next point might make the prim sentinel blanch, at least a little, but before he could wade into it, their order arrived.
