Tony blinked again, but pushed his goggles up into his hair. He rubbed his eyes before he began to pull apart the closest robot.
“Do you have magic, too?! What else don’t I know about you?! Are you in my head, Tony?!’ Steve jerked him again, and Tony adamantly shook his head.
Steve steamrolled on, the words coming up now that he’d started. “I saw you with your little garden of budding scientists. You were so careful to spend the same amount of time teaching each of those kids about your robots. And don’t think I don’t know about the savings bonds you gave each of their families.
Unless one breaks first. But not surprisingly, they’re both very competitive, and neither one wants to be ‘sexiled’ for a week. It’s going to be a long night for them.
Steve’s mouth is insistent against Tony’s as he’s backed against the table he’d been sitting at. He admits that his brain melts just a little, so it takes him a few seconds to get in gear and respond. But just as he’s about to go romcom and slide his arms around Steve, the blond pulls back with a lick of his lips.
It drives Tony mindless, hips driving his cock deeper, harder as Steve begins to shake and lose his the stability of his pace. He angles body slightly and gives Tony a groan that sounds more growl and gravel than pleasure, and he feels Steve's cock jerk and pulses between them, coating their stomachs in a mix of cum and sweat.
Tony huffed once, absently turning a styrofoam cup in his hands. “Don’t worry; we’re still in your ‘home, sweet, home’, medical and all. You told me you stopped going to the SHIELD doctors and why. So when I heard that they’d brought you in and taken you into surgery immediately, I came down to observe.”
“Yes, Missy,” Tony replied, taking the first bite of his cereal. Melissa walked away, the tips of her fingers brushing his ear.
Bucky doesn’t tense; he looks over his shoulder at Steve before he jumps over the edge after Tony. Steve throws himself to the edge of the pad, scrambling back as a silver and red Iron Man suit shoots past the building towards the street far below. It’s slimmer than Tony’s, and Steve knows that Pepper is piloting.
Tony didn’t waste any time. Steve was on the airstrip and Tony knew Steve didn't let the armor case out of his sight. Tony ran as best he could with his still-healing knee, pushing past confused agents and a shouting Hill. He didn't have time to care about their damn rules. The reports had to be lying. There was no way Victor would... He needed to see for himself and to do that, he needed his armor.
“Politics never seemed to be in your wheelhouse, Stark, so you can imagine my disbelief in the rumor mill that you’re planning on running?”
“Great, out of my way,” Steve growled, pushing himself past the others to step through Victor’s portal. He’d think about how he blindly trusted the man’s word about where it would lead him, but for now, he could only think about getting to Tony before PIerce could do any lasting damage.
“I’ll see you around, Mr. Stark,” Steve said, mocking him with a salute before he took the case and sauntered out.
Rogers cleared his throat again, looked like he was almost about to salute, but thought better of it, then turned and left.
“Why do you even own a radio?” Tony growled, dropping into the old recliner Steve kept swearing he was going to replace one day. “Who does that these days?”
“Oh my god, just do it!” Tony nearly shouted, quickly losing focus again. He barely registered Clint knocking the shotgun further out of Tony’s reach, then folding the belt in half before shoving it in Tony’s mouth.
A moot point, Tony knew, but he tended to focus on those. Another video feed overtook the current news station, and he watched as Captain America caught Iron Man by the ankle and threw him into one of the smoking containers remaining on the
“I’d say anytime, but honestly… Don’t get hurt again,” Tony said, feeling as old as his voice sounded tired.
The feed cut back to the studio reporters and Sam laughed. There was a note of incredulity in the sound.
“Who are you?” Tony growled. That voice laughed, a caress that left Tony shivering with sick premonition.
His legs smacked the ground when Crossbones let go and stumbled back, clawing at Ronin’s arms to free himself. His rough voice was a gurgle of breath as he fought, but Ronin was relentless, turning the bow to pull the custom Dacron tight across Crossbones’ throat.
He sees his recent memory banks of Tony and Pepper dissolve from his coding, schematics and strings of data dripping down like melting wax.
Tony hated how it made him feel hollow inside. There were some people who believed in omens concerning cherry blossoms, believed they held a deep, spiritual meaning. He thought they simply signaled how fragile life truly was, and that even if it looked as pretty as that on the surface, there was still nothing but the stain of life on the ground left as proof. He tracked a couple, small and indistinguishable from his position in the building, as they got caught in an eddy of the falling petals. The pink swirled around them and past to flutter off in the grass or into the water.
Tony drags his eyes away from the prosthetic up to Bucky’s bemused face. “I am so sorry,” he says immediately. “Oh god. That’s... I’ve just not seen one in action yet. How embarrassing, right? Anyway, I’m sorry. Please don’t tell Pepper.”
“Aye, General,” Stephanie replied, pushing to her feet. The feeling of it being unfair never crossed her mind. It was her fault, she knew, for being different.
true. I could’ve told you everything you wanted to know, but instead of asking for the truth, you hid behind your own and you tried to… It wasn’t enough that you invaded my personal life, my work, and my home. You would’ve used me like you earned it for aggravated payment.”
“Doctor Doom has not received your messages, sir,” Jarvis informed him through the fight, “and Doctor Banner is insisting only that they’re well. It would be interesting to note that Doctor Banner’s location is no longer Latveria.”
Steve’s expression was shocked, and he was drenched in seawater, pale and frigid as the ocean. He lifted his hand, and it wasn’t the shield he held. The report of the gunshot followed Tony into waking.
Tony had had a sinking feeling Pierce had figured it out a while ago. After all, he knew Tony just about as well as everyone else. Unfortunately, better than some others too. He choked as Crossbones gripped his throat with his other hand, but out of the corner of his eye, he could see a sheath strapped to Crossbones’ thigh. If he could just get his weight to balance properly, he could get a hand up to grab the blade.
He had to stop Ty. Ty had no right to talk about Steve. Ty’s hand slipped over Tony’s hands, fingers tightening. The bones ground together, and Tony’s heart stuttered.
“And what about Pierce?” Tony asked, sliding his soda across the table then back again in a set curving path. “I’m telling you right now that’s-”
Joke's on him. Tony always leaves sloppy drunk, but he's Anthony Goddamn Stark, and no one will ever be able to accuse him of being drunk in public.
“No, I just want to thank you for being willing to try. I know it’s a lot to ask so early,” Steve says quietly, leaning up to catch Tony’s mouth in a slow, lingering kiss.
“If I went and did a crazy thing like cared, then I’d never get anything done. That’s what you heroes are for, isn’t it?” Iron Man drew a hand up to examine the fingers of his gauntlets, feigning nonchalance.
Tony was leaning forward, his hands --those hands that Steve had drawn too many times to count-- gripped the edges of the podium. The crowd was quiet, hanging onto his every word. A woman’s poster sagged forward, covering part of Tony’s name and leaving only half a heart visible. Even the news scroll had stilled, affectionately reading:
It turned out that Pierce was quiet for almost three weeks. All of Iron Man’s contacts hadn’t heard from the Hydra leader or any of his associates. So, Tony spent some of that time actually visiting Pepper to check in on his Malibu operations. The California sun had done wonders for her disposition, or maybe it had just been having a break from his constant avoidance of executive duties before making her C.E.O. Perhaps, it was even the shining diamond on her left ring finger that bore the inscription ‘With every breath, I will love you’ in a line of beautiful curls.
“I’ll take that back,” Tony said, tone steady for all that he felt like he was underwater. “Or are you going to ruin it like everything else?”
“I can’t help you with your sex life either, not where Stark is concerned. He’s older than you, than me. Maybe he needs a little… help to get things going, yeah? Maybe he’s Asexual. I don’t know. Why don’t you just ask? Have
“Yet,” Victor said dryly. Neither of them crossed the room to each other, preferring to keep the leather, wingback chairs between them. “I suppose we should discuss the data then.”
“You’re going to go surprise a group of children who want to be scientists when they grow up with full-fledged AI-operating robotic mechanics,” Steve breathed like the very idea of it was the Eighth Wonder of the World.
Scarlet Witch actually smiled slightly and twisted to look at Hydra Bob at the other end of the table.
“When you had the flu, but your files before that,” he answered, “We’ve suspected you for a long time. Fury just wanted the proof.”
“He’ll be fine,” Tony replied as he swept away the data, “Give him a couple missions with a Strike team, and he’ll find his stride again. They just gotta stop harping on him. I’m sure they’re harping on him.”
Tony blinked at him, flushing a little, before he ducked his head to hide his smile. Ty had always expect Tony to cover everything, and Tony did. He’d just been used to it.
“He wishes he could throw the real suit,” Tony muttered to the floor, blocking out the scroll of text that counted the number of dead passengers from the cruise line already identified. His head was pounding, begging his body for the sweet relief of oblivion even as he struggled to figure out what the magical copycat was even trying to do. “What the fuck are you after?”
“Statement piece?” Pepper asks and now she’s chuckling at him. “Tony, I think it’s a good idea. Mr. Rogers made me that Charmeuse dress for the spring gala.”
"If you wanted to date me yourself, Stark," Steve says, angry and blushing at the same time. "then you should have just asked. I could have done this weeks ago!”
“The degradation of the thorium’s chamber was accelerated due to external forces. According to the data, Jarvis pinpointed DNA not belonging to myself, Dr. Ross, or Dr. Banner. The genetic code has mutated due to radiation, though, so no concrete identifiers.”
He sees approval in his creator's gaze when Tony traces Pepper's skin between the suit's fingers. His other hand is busy with his tongue, and Pepper tips her head back against Jarvis' shoulder, arches further, and moans huskily.
“I don’t think he’d be disappointed in you now, Tony.” Tony felt the fine hairs around his ear tickle softly with Steve’s breath. “I think he’d be amazed at the empire you’ve built from his name. Yeah, I know. Howard was an asshole, but you’re going to carry the Stark name to the stars, Tony, and that’s all Howard could even dream to do.”
“Tony,” Steve called, having not moved from where they’d been standing by the counter. His hands hung at his sides, fingers slightly curled. Tony licked his lips, his own hand on the doorknob. “I’m asking you to trust me.”
“Oh, you’re Italian?” he responds in kind and the man eyes him while using the dirty hem of his sleeve to dab at his temple. Steve has always loved languages and he took right to them as he was learned.
“Weren’t you the one who thought keeping him around was a bad idea? I seem to remember you shoving the number of dead civilians in my face.”
“There’s a fresh suit in your bathroom. Clean up,” she orders. He stands on shaky legs and slides by her like a scolded dog. “Oh, and Tony?”
"Fuck," he swears, and he feels that goddamn smile press against his shoulder through the leather jacket.
Tony sets them up in a warehouse that the asset hasn’t been in before. He’s unsurprised to note that it’s remote, plain, unobtrusive. He’s even less surprised that the heavy form slung over his metal shoulder is the first one to be brought here.
“Don’t thank me,” Tony laughs, maybe a bit hysterically. “We haven’t done it yet. And you might not even enjoy it.”
Tony flung himself off the airstrip into nothing but air and the far away sight of the city below. He counted back from ten, the adrenaline coursing through his system and battling the nausea of the height. By the time he hit four, the welcomed embrace of titanium alloy was locking into place around him. By the count of two, his repulsors fired up and Tony was banking sharply to the right to take flight in the direction given by the report.
Stephanie gave as good as she got and, when the commanders and lieutenants pulled them all apart, the men came out as worse for wear as her. Blood covered her face from a gash that bisected her left eye. She could feel the bruises forming all along her body, but she did her best to keep her chin up and shoulders back as she was dragged before the General.
It didn’t always. So she sharpened her sword herself and kept her shield as polished as she could. She didn’t need to draw anymore attention to herself by going into the armory. It made sense in her head.
“Banging on it wouldn’t cause as much as an issue, Stark,” Bucky drawled and Tony blinked before he flushed and smiled.  Steve nearly choked on his beer as Natasha threw her head back and laughed.
It’s like a dam breaking and Steve’s stomach is covered in his come not even a second later as he sobs from the stimulation. He gets his hand around Tony’s on his cock as soon as the sound is clear and helps Tony stroke the last of his orgasm out of him in desperate waves.
“And you’re about to be,” Sam smirks back and calls over his shoulder. “Steve, your two o’clock is here!”
“Once upon a time, you didn’t care who you hurt along the way to your brand of justice,” Victor said, his words damning even as he spoke civilly, calmly. Tony’s lip curled again, hating the tone, as if Victor were talking about the goddamn weather of all things. His fingers twitched around the curve of the countertop behind him.
them. Also, he’s not fucking here, so it doesn’t matter what Steve likes.” With that declaration, Tony turned his back and strode across the green room. He dejectedly picked through a few of the weird assortment of items some intern had thrown into the room according to Tony’s rider. Honestly, he didn’t even remember putting half of this shit on there.
“And the other pieces of equipment?” Tony wondered, grabbing up a pair of goggles and sliding them over his head and into place.
All in the space of ten minutes, he's finished. He stands at the mail bin, a wide-mouthed cloth-cart that holds all the mail that hadn't left the Tower yet. His package sits on top of the mound, addressed to Wakanda. To T'Challa. His hand is now empty. His other fist, though, clutches the neck of a bottle of whiskey.
“Oh,” Victor sighed, the sigh of a disappointed teacher to a student who just didn’t comprehend, “I came to your company for that reason, yes, but to you, Anthony? That wasn’t the only reason.”
Nightmares of being in a space so open that he felt claustrophobic; the inky darkness closing in and the constant ringing of an unanswered phone.
As Jarvis finished his recital, the din of sirens grew to an overwhelming volume. Sending out a pulse of energy on either side of himself, Tony destroyed the repulsors he’d burnt out with the webbing and then turned towards the police as an officer started demands through a bullhorn.
“Get back over here!” Crossbones growled, far too close for comfort. He grabbed Tony’s ankle and started to drag him back along the tarmac. Tony kicked out at him with his injured leg, struggling to find anything to free himself. It had about as much effect as hitting the man with a fucking feather.
Steve stepped in closer, hands coming out of his pockets as he searched Tony’s face. “May I kiss you goodnight, Tony?”
“What are you apologizing for?” Steve asks and presses his hand soothingly to the back of Tony’s neck. His thumb sweeps up along the tendon in Tony’s neck and, the next thing Tony knows, he’s burrowed against Steve’s chest and his tears are soaking Steve’s shirt.
“Captain Rogers was successfully recovered from a minor expedition involving harp seals three months ago. In an interesting side note, your father’s last expedition to find the Captain ended approximately 150 leagues out from the Captain’s location.”
“Tony, we n-” Steve is cut off by the cocking of a gun behind him. The barrel of it presses to the back of his head, and Tony meets his gaze with a tilt of his head.
Tony smirked and leaned back against the table, the expression pulling at the bruised skin around his eye and mouth as he said; “What, Cap? Did I hit the nail on the head? Do you think my suit is sexy?” He certainly had in the dream, Tony knew, almost salivating every time Iron Man had come close to where he knelt. “Maybe after humping my leg, you can clean it up with your ton-”
He steps up behind her, and she remains still. Her gaze doesn't stray from the wall in front of her.
“I’m here with spare time. There’s no reason why I shouldn’t let him monopolize that time with kindergarten questions.”
"I’ll be the one to protect you from your enemies and your choices," Steve pulls his hand away from Tony’s throat.
The nightmares continued, but Tony learned to be careful about screaming too loudly, of alerting his father. He learned to sleep with one pillow tucked in his arms, so when he inevitably dreamed of falling -
Rogers took a step closer -too close- and said, firm and entreating, “I like seeing people as they really are, without their masks and their armor. I like seeing people be themselves, and this? This is what you really are, Tony. I think that’s easy to see now, most of all, without your fancy business suits and shining glasses. So passionate about what you love that you lose yourself in it, unaware of the world around you and how it revolves.
…/empty/. Empty in the hollow, echoing kind of way. He feels the word like a loose screw rattling around his brain. Breathes in the frigid air around the loss of…
He could feel Steve’s eyes on him, boring into the side of his face as he continued to not look at him. But in that dream, Tony hadn’t been able to tear his gaze away from Steve. He pushed the images away violently and tried to ignore the tempting aroma of coffee.
Pepper is panting, twisting against Jarvis with each expert roll of Tony's hips, and she growls a little 'Oh god, yes' when Jarvis finally moves two of those fingers against her.
“Yeah… That… I don’t get that. Well, I understand it, I guess. He cleaned up the East Coast, set the precedent for the other zones. He united his country.” But even Steve sounded a little skeptical as he recited something he’d most likely read in his ‘modernization’ dump.
A month later, he’s yanking out fistfuls of scraggy brown hair and wondering where the snow went. When did it melt? He thinks it might have been when he was sleeping. When he was reaching for a suddenly-clear image, and his dull-thumping heart supplies…
“If you want,” Tony said, heart pounding. “Because I do, and I might sound a little desperate, and I’m pretty sure I shouldn’t have said that, but you’re really hot and nice and your smile is-I should stop...talking…”
Steadily, Steve’s dripping blood counts down the end of the day; the end of another one in a month of nightmares.
"They’re one and the same, I must isolate you," Steve replies and he sounds like he’s made a decision. Tony’s chokes back a sob and closes his eyes before the blow comes.
“That’s not possible,” Tony said staunchly, one hand smacking Fury’s desk, “Doombots aren’t in production anymore. I know this.” He’d been there, watched Victor shut the lab down himself.
“You might want to rethink those words, Stark,” he warned, cocking the shotgun with one hand. Tony thought he might vomit rather than rethink any words, but just as Crossbones aimed the gun at him, an arrow appeared with alarming silence in Crossbones’ shoulder. It stuck out of his body armor like a garish attachment.
Tony pockets his sunglasses finally and steps right into the man’s space. “Look at her. She’s so gorgeous.”
“Yeah, well some of us don’t like killing children,” Tony said, tone casual, dismissive, but his gaze was sharper than any word he would give when Victor looked back up at him.
“I’m cleaning up the mess you’re in,” Victor answered, “Now, if you don’t mind, there is the small matter of Anthony-”
“The same genetic coding?” Tony spit out, throwing a heavy, sixty-inch pipe wrench across the center of the turbine. It clattered almost maliciously between the slats all the way to the concrete floor, causing such a ruckus that even Jarvis paused.
Tony couldn’t even come up with a defense, trying his best not to just shrink away from Steve and any touch he might inflict. He saw his faceplate crumpled in Steve’s hand.
All evening, Steve catches sight of Tony staring absently into a glass that never seems empty. Whether his friend is drinking too much or only pretending to, Steve doesn’t know. He does know that the absentee expression disappears as soon as someone approaches and Steve tucks the knowledge away to bring up later, when everyone is home and they’re not being watched by society.
“Sir!” Jarvis exclaimed and Tony looked around to see Crossbones finally staggering towards his dropped weaponry.
“Sure,” Rogers replied, smiling the same sort of smile Tony gave the reporters who asked him his opinion on Iron Man. It was ‘real’, accepting without showing its disappointment. “Anything off the menu?”
Steve looked tired; the lines around his eyes were noticeable in the dim lights of Tony’s bedroom. He had a few bruises himself that were healing around his jaw and the bridge of his nose. His breathing seemed okay, though, which made Tony relax a little more. He reached for him, fingertips just barely contacting the denim crease at Steve’s bent knee. Steve smiled easily, shifting the balance of the notepad to take Tony’s hand in his own. He laced their fingers together and Tony was aware of how clammy his own felt.
“Don’t act like you wouldn’t have enjoyed yourself. Why do you think it was so easy to start dating you? Like I couldn’t read every thought playing in that twisted mind of yours the moment we met. You’ve got no ground here, so just open the goddamn case, Tony!”
Time stretched and stretched, Steve’s mind wildly conjuring up images of rubber bands extending until their material was going white under the strain. And then, the immediate sensation was snatched away as coolness hit him in patches across his body. Odd noises filtered through his muffled hearing: squeaks and squeals, numerous voices that ranged from low to high to funny to exasperated.
Now, all Tony wanted to do, was curse and push Ty away. His arms twitched. He wanted to find a shower and scrub his skin off everywhere Ty dared to touch him. He couldn’t force his legs to move.
No, not Tony; it was still Iron Man. There was nothing personal in this act. Wasn’t that the problem?
It hurts, physically, to watch the Captain get ready, Natasha throwing in a helping hand from time to time. The perfect hair. The newer, nicer clothes that fit and defined and beckoned Tony to snap buttons and reveal skin.
“Because I’ve given you everything you could ever need and you spit in my face. All you had to do was stay out of trouble for one weekend. One! One of the biggest goddamn deals of the new age, and you nearly fuck it up by-”
"Yes," Steve moans, the sound catching and hitching in his throat. "Yes, Tony, that's it. Make me come so you can do that. I wanna feel you mark me up, jerk off on me, claim me."
The room was dark, the hands were smooth, the mouth familiar. The music from the party was loud, thumping against the door and the walls, through Tony’s body, pulsing with his heartbeat. It was frantic. His mind was not.
“I’m sure there are plenty of jokes I could make right now,” Steve answered, pushing the cowl of his uniform off his hair as he settled on the other side of the table, “but why don’t we just go with what you can tell me about these compared to the others?”
“Fine.” She stood and smoothed her skirt down before stepping back around the table. “I’ll be back tomorrow to help you get ready.”
“Do you have any idea what you’ve done?” Iron Man seethed at the Captain as he strained to get the suit back to its feet. Tony was barely able to rein in his fury.
"Can't even find it in my-" but what Tony couldn't find, Steve didn't know and wouldn't know as he jerked suddenly as the elevator announced its arrival on his floor. He blinked his eyes open dazedly as the doors slid open.
He'd offered himself up to Tony, tried for low and inviting while Sam had choked on the blood brought up from the metal fist in his gut. Tears streaking down his face, Steve had begged Tony to take him, use him however he'd like, just -
Tony swallows again, feeling the slight tightening of Steve’s hand. He can’t look away from the shield.
“Of course, sir,” Jarvis replied. The data replayed, displaying the National Nuclear Security Administration’s current operational status. The whole point of the Megaports Initiative was to work with their partner countries to systematically enhance their detection capabilities for nuclear and radioactive materials. If the NNSA had put out an alert…
"Of course, I do," Tony says, press persona sliding into play as he sympathizes. "Honestly, you two were meant to be anyway. It's obvious you absolutely adore her. I expect pictures of the baby.
Tony scrambles up onto Steve, moving up to straddle his chest. Steve blinks muzzily up at Tony, both large hands coming up behind Tony to steady him. Tony works his boxers down enough to get them under his balls.
Tony closed his eyes in dread and when Howard jerked his chin up, his eyes flew open to meet Steve’s thoughtful expression.
“I wear my…” Tony murmured under his breath, fingers tapping absently against his slack-covered thigh. “So I can, so I can…”
It takes Steve a moment to realize he’s got Tony’s attention, but he blushes faintly and clears his throat. “He-Hey.” And promptly flushes more at the crack in his voice.
Steve let him pull away from the kiss, but not his hands. His thumbs stroked along Tony’s jawline as he watched his reflection in Tony’s glasses, but Tony knew that this close, Steve could see through the lenses.
He takes the package and barely get a 'thank you' out around the lump in his throat. He flees, walks to an edge of the courtyard where the viewing tables are sat.
Tony blinked, looking up, and up, at Rogers. His mouth quirked. “You mean, to sound like a motorcycle? Did you do that, Captain, when you were running the streets of 1920’s Brooklyn?”
“I don’t want to bruise you, Captain,” Tony said coolly, the voice mechanic, the tone ringing true despite it. “Bruises are personal, intimate. You haven’t even given in yet.”
Because then Steve noticed how Tony seemed softer with him, more affectionate. They moved around each other in the kitchen while they made dinner for Bucky and Nat and Steve was hyper aware of Bucky’s raised brow and quirked mouth at Tony’s seemingly innocent touches. A brush against his arm. A hand at his lower back. A playful nudge of an elbow.
“And, of course, the government immediately re-enlisted him,” Tony said with a resigned sigh. He navigated through the fast lane around a van swaying dangerously out of its lane.
"I’d like to take you to dinner, Tony," he says softly, smiling like he hasn’t just blown Tony’s mind a little.
Tony gets distracted by the kiss, making a light noise of longing in his throat as he presses closer to Steve’s naked body. He’s still damp and warm from his shower, but Tony doesn’t care about his clothes getting wet. He’ll be stripped soon enough too.
"She’s a doll," he hears Steve say about what’s-her-name-Tiff-Janice-bimbo-that-wasn’t-Tony-who’s-lucky-ass-is-getting-a-quiet-dinner-with-Captain-America-and-probably-doesn’t-understand-how-LUCKY-she-is…
“Oh my god, no!” Sam vigorously shook his head and pointed the index finger of his hand holding his glass at Steve. “That is not what I meant. At all. I really don’t wanna hear about your sex life.”
It was about then that Tony realized his feet were planted flat on the table, legs spread to hook around metal bars attached to the corners, and with it, he was unable to find the leverage to rock back against Steve. He strained against the bars, knees pressing tightly to the metal. Steve, in turn, pressed their foreheads together and turned his face to look at one of Tony’s knees.
Tony hid his smile behind his coffee mug as he lifted it to his mouth. True to Steve’s word, his foot was casually displacing the expensive fabric of Tony’s slacks, rucking up the leg to press against Tony’s calf.
There’s a brief flash of embarrassment, but he nods and Steve helps him get up and helps to make sure he doesn’t look a mess.
Victor gave a humming sigh and turned to the bar. “If you’re going to make an accusation, then please do so now, so that we may get it out of the way.”
"What if I hadn't been interested?" Tony catches at Steve's thighs as Steve kneels up. He's struck again by how intensely gorgeous and cut Steve is, every stretch and flex of muscle perfectly sculpted.
And Tony could never resist Steve begging. He licks his lips and gets more of lube on his fingers so he can liberally coat the sound. He’s careful to keep gripping the dry end so he can keep a good hold on it. For Steve’s first time, he’s not going to go too deeply.
Tony is quiet for a moment, searching his memory. It sparks and he groans appreciatively. “That silky, short silver piece?”
“As many as it takes,” Tony countered. Neither of them startled when the lights went red with an emergency alert, but after a moment, Steve scowled.
that with the strands of genetic coding our mystery person is leaving around and the fact that they got a working Iron Man suit without it actually working properly due to the whole ‘no power system’ thing-” there, Tony thumped his chest, suppressed his automatic wince, and carried on, “-that we are definitely dealing with a person of magic!”
“I’m sorry,” Tony said quickly. He shook himself and took a deep breath to let it out after a moment. He brushed Steve’s hair from his forehead. “I’m sorry that you’ve been through this. You should’ve said something sooner.”
“Someone needs to be,” Tony replied, moving away to shrug out of his coat. He threw it over the back of the couch and returned to Steve, rolling up his sleeves. He could do this without freaking out anymore; he was determined to be steady.
“It was. Thank you,” Steve replies, tone grateful and fucked out. He presses a kiss to the top of Tony’s head and Tony closes his eyes. In a moment, he’ll make Steve get up and go to the bathroom to flush himself out, but for now… For now, he’s just going to bask.
“The next few months with fly by,” Steve murmured, nuzzling at Tony’s stomach. “You won’t even miss me.”
“Yeah, um. Totally...down for that. Dinner is great, I love dinner.” He puts his hands back on his face and takes a steadying breath, tries not to sound so pathetically eager. “Mr. Rogers, I’ve changed my mind on my suit style.”
“Be thankful I didn’t take your hand, Tony. Now, stay here and think about what you’ve done.” He placed the bottle on the table across from the machine and swaggered out.
"You came to the bar to get fucked tonight," Tony says against Steve's mouth. The words could almost be accusing if they hadn't just met, accompanied by the wet sound of the hard plastic stretching Steve open over and over.
Steve’s smile was fond. “Yes, so she said. It’s hard to tell her no. I hope you’re not too terribly put out. I know a musician’s schedule is never clear.”
“What makes your pain, your revenge so goddamn special? Why should you be the outlier, the anomaly? It could be anyone, any leader of the rebellion or whatever fanciful notion this Zone keeps throwing at Pierce’s feet.
Steve kept Tony balanced that way with his arm, thrust back into every twist downward and gripped his flank hard enough to bruise. “You weren’t wrong,” Steve panted, “I do like this color on you too.”
Tony groaned and tried to work his tongue around the ribbon, around Steve’s fingertips. Steve hooked his fingers down against Tony’s teeth, twisting a little to watch his cock pump in and out. He braced his other hand on the brick wall by Tony’s head and leaned in to kiss at Tony’s mouth, at the damp and swollen lips, his own fingers as they pulled Tony against the harness.
“Huh,” Fury said thoughtfully, and Candace appeared to deliver their food. She dropped off extra napkins, topped off Tony’s soda and left. “Is that what you young people call it these days?”
“Yes.” Steve smiled, folding his napkin across his lap. “We work together. She’s a mentor...of sorts.”
“Stop trying to make me feel better,” Tony groaned, dropping his head back over the other side of the recliner. A pen dislodged from his hair and landed on the drab carpet.
Steve's hands massage Tony's thighs for a moment before he follows Tony's line of sight. Tony sees him smirk then wrap one of those hands around himself. He strokes his cock for Tony, drawing his hand slowly up from the heavy set of his balls, along the tight stretch of his shaft, to the very red tip of his cock.
“I suppose he has a point,” Steve mused, turning Tony’s face one way then the other, “You might still be useful after all.”
“This is pointless. Look, you keep going in hard, man, he’s going to keep fighting back just as hard. Trust me, I know. And if neither of you give a shit about the people you’re jerking around, then yeah. They’re gonna keep dying. Why don’t you just leave it to the heroes? Ain’t that what Captain America is for? Or is it a bit harder when he’s in the bad guy’s pocket?”
He does, however, see the good Captain America calmly shatter the sliding glass door to gain entry into the lab and stalk his way over to where Tony’s standing there, mouth gaping.
“They’re good,” Tony murmurs, carefully turning a page to look at the next image. “I just need one suit for now, though, don’t worry.”
He calculates the distance from the bar's front door to the nearest alleyway, allowing for twenty seconds either way -- it depends whether or not the man will want introductions first -- to the moment he finds out what the man's smile tastes like. The air is balmy against his face, the sea air salting the breeze. It ruffles Tony's hair, displacing errant locks even further as Tony turns in the direction of his motel; he'd had to move out of the penthouse. Rumiko fills the lavish rooms like a spectre. It's consequently also the direction of the closest alleyway, and because he's a genius, the seconds tick down exactly as a large, guiding hand cups his elbow and all but drags him into the darkened alley.
Tony’s heart swells with adoration and he all but scurries into the bathroom. He makes himself slow down and carefully wash himself up. He uses the special soap he’d purchased just for this to make sure his hands are as clean as he can make them. He’d been careful not to let grease and oil collect under his nails the past few days, so it’s easy enough.
“It would be unwise to draw attention to this discovery, sir,” the AI admonished, and Tony inhaled deeply as he tried to count back from ten to calm down.
“Nothing. Nothing, Jay.” He straightened and rubbed his damp hands over his face. He winced as he pressed into the bruise left by Steve’s hit and began to clean himself up as he had Jarvis check to make sure the path to the lab was clear since it was so early. When Jarvis replied in the positive, Tony finished pulling on his boots and stood.
“You’ve spent fourteen hours working on this turbine, barely pausing long enough to chew your coffee, and I know that it’s far from your longest binge. It probably doesn’t even rate in your top…” He trailed off, a range on the tip of his tongue, but something in Tony’s expression must have changed his choice. “...your top twenty binges.”
He calculated how hard he'd have to hit the Captain to maintain permanent damage to the cuspids. It was a pleasant distraction from the warmth in the guy's greeting. He wasn't sure if Captain Rogers was genuinely interested, or if he was naturally charming. He’d bet the latter.
“And he didn’t…” Steve trailed off as fury rolled across his features. His hand stilled in Tony’s hair. “He didn’t have time to...to…Pepper found you first.”
Tony turned his head on the pillow, feeling like he’d been hit by a semi-truck or two. His entire body was one large ache, but it was centered mostly around his sides and lower back. He got the feeling that if he coughed, his abdomen would scream bloody murder. There was the sound of pencil on paper and he managed to crack his eyes open enough to see Steve’s watery, blurry profile.
toxic. And I’m not going to run away. Not from this, not from you. Ever, Tony. Especially when you’re feeling like this. I want you to feel like I’m your safe zone, okay? No matter what, no matter who, is bothering you or how you’re feeling, I want you to know that I’ll be here. I’ll always listen. Or I’ll just sit with you quietly if you don’t want to talk. Any one of us would do this for you. Tony, we love you.”
He wanted to see if Steve had texted him, but the texts had stopped a week ago, a week after the missed phone calls. He rubbed his chest and started the car, pulling out onto the road.
Tony peers at Steve. “Yes,” he answers simply, then drops Steve’s chin and powers down the room. He leaves Steve hanging there, the silence deafening in his departure.
Iron Man kicked the grenade as the projection on his HUD directed, but he wasn’t counting on Captain America interfering again right away. The Captain slammed his shield down over the grenade, glaring at Iron Man as the explosion rocked them both.
"Oh." And Jarvis can see every angle of the way her lips shape the breathless realization. "That's... Okay then..." And Tony's kissing her again, deeper this time, and she's using the suit to arch against.
A week later, he doesn’t see Natasha roll her eyes and sit Steve down to explain what is going on until Steve’s jaw clenches in understanding and a little anger at Tony’s stupidity.
“The dead zone is now activated. Cordoning both Crossbones and the imposter inside the square will render them inactive.” Jarvis illuminated the square, a mere twenty feet or so away from where Crossbone was pushing himself out of the rubble. The mask he’d been wearing was burnt away, revealing a heavily scarred face with tendrils of smoke wafting up and away into the smoke still in the air.
“I warned you, Stark, that we’d be done with you soon enough. You didn’t think I was lying, did you?” Crossbones dug his heel into the back of Tony’s knee then knelt down with his own knee pressed into Tony’s back. His gloved fingers slipped through Tony’s hair; the strands felt slick against his head and he guessed he had a head wound to top it all off.
Steve was quiet for a moment, gaze tracking the black lines curve over Tony’s skin up towards the music notes he knew where Tony’s neck, had memorized their shapes and placements with fingertips and tongue.
“Feeling a little empty?” Steve wondered and crossed his arms, shifting his position where he leaned against a low table in front of Tony. Tony’s table was just a little lower, wider too, the perfect height for Steve because Steve was. In. Control. The table was pushed against the brick wall, and Tony was connected to it via a heavy metal bolt that attached to another ring in the clasps of the harness. It gave him no leeway to move his head except side to side, but only very little.
“First, we will finish helping these mortal men. Then, we’ll retrieve the Tesseract and go home. You owe them that much. Not to mention the Doctor and myself. I was in the middle of a great hunt and now Lady Sif will have all the brag-”
"Make me come on your cock, Tony," Steve whispers, encourages, demands, as he presses his mouth open and hot against Tony's jaw. "I can see it in your eyes, Tony. You didn't turn me down, so take it. It's yours."
"I said stand down!" Steve spat, "If you think I'm letting you off this base to get to your boyfriend -yeah, I know about that too," he added grimly as Tony felt the shock pass over his expression. Good, let the man think he'd won this.
And he knows for a fact that Pepper is keeping both of their plugs on a low setting. The dials sit right in front of the wine bottle. There’s no relief for either soldier any time soon.
Seven months later, Steve receives a package via T'Challa. T'Challa looks grim and possibly a little sympathetic.
Two days pass, and he finds himself grunting just because he can. His throat hurts with each noise, so he gives up.
“That is definitely not a comforting thought, and the mutated genetics are still unidentified,” Tony spoke at his normal level, knowing Jarvis could hear him without problem, “which means we’re working with a super, where before I’d assumed it was just some beefed up lackey. Any leads at all from the dirt?”
Steve rubbed a thumb over Tony’s skin. “I can’t take off for your whole tour. I can’t just leave my job like that.”
He couldn’t stop Tony’s name spilling from his lips, chapped and red from the gag and Steve’s own teeth, over and over. His name was a plea, a curse, a wish, his touch a benediction. He felt Tony’s body tense beneath him, felt him start to meet each of Steve’s thrusts downward, and felt the first intense throb of Tony’s orgasm against his prostate.
A mage healer tended to Stephanie’s eye as she waited for the General to turn around and acknowledge her. Her hands clasped together in her lap, knuckles white under the scrapes and blood.
“Why does it have to be you?” Steve's voice caught on his last words, leaving Tony wondering if he was only just angry.
“Was it worth it?” Tony asks, lips mashed against Steve’s shoulder. Steve’s arms tighten around him and Tony can feel the satisfied hum rumble between them.
Tony looked over his shoulder and the unknown agent was walking up the ramp of the jet. He inhaled sharply, determined. All he needed was a head start. He whipped around and went up on his toes to grip Steve's face through the cowl and kiss him with everything he had.
Tony ducked around the last of the obstacles and heard Steve call out, but it wasn’t angry this time, only worried.
He drinks it all in, eidetic memory committed to every details despite inebriation, and he gets the feeling that Steve is doing the same. He slides his hand down Steve's chest, palms his stomach before hooking three fingers into Steve's waistband and leading him from the suite's foyer into the large bedroom.
“The one and only,” Tony said, trying to force his mouth back to something normal. Honestly, it was like he’d never seen tall and muscled before. Tony licked his lips and hoped to God he wasn’t
“Exactly!” Tony decreed, clapping Victor on the shoulder hard enough to sway the other man forward a bit. “You know what this means, right?”
“You can’t trust anyone, Stark,” a voice whispered, and it was neither Howard nor Steve, but their mystery magic user, “You’re a good man, trying very hard to be strong in this worthless world. They’ll do nothing but ruin you, even the good Captain.”
The false Iron Man, Steve could say with a bitter certainty, had blindsided him, dodged the ricochet of his shield, and thrown Steve through not one, but two buildings. When the second foundation had settled around him, his world had gone dark.
Steve dragged his gaze up to where Tony’s hand was wrapping around his cock. His eyes darkened as Tony’s fingers swirled around the head, teased at his slit, then spread his precome down his shaft to start stroking himself a bit faster than Steve’s hips were moving.
He burst out of the employee access door and out onto the airstrip. Steve had already been alerted to Tony's seeming bid for freedom, because he was striding across the strip in full uniform as an unknown redheaded agent took the case from him, heading in the opposite direction towards a jet.
Carter reached up to rub her temple. “Considering you’re the one who alerted the brass, I’m sure you do. She’s going to have to find her spine if she wants to survive here.”
“So did Hitler,” Tony said casually, “but it’s all about perspective. They say crime is at an all-time low across the nation, but especially here on the East Coast, but that only means reported crime. They don’t talk about what won’t look good.”
Steve hadn’t thought he was capable of screaming anymore. As Tony falls first and Bucky turns the gun on himself, Steve is still screaming as the cryostasis completes and the ice takes him away from it all.
Tony looked away from Steve and over the table of scraps. Maybe he would have to go to drastic measures then. Maybe he needed to make it easier.
Tony couldn’t move, shuddering and stiff as he peered at Steve through the faceplate. He needed to get away, to protect himself, but he could only watch as Steve ripped the mask away and smiled just as gently.
Tony had fallen in love with him. The words he hadn’t been meant to hear, a private moment just another item on the list he’d stolen from Tony. How would he ever prove that he’d never meant it to get this far if he couldn’t stop taking and taking?
Loki rolled his eyes and snapped his fingers. The cuffs dropped to the floor behind Steve with the loud sound of metal on concrete. That was what finally brought the henchmen running into the room.
“Oh, Tony. Tony. Tony. Tony,” Ty sighed and pushed Tony facedown across the bed. “It’s amusing to me how you think you still have a choice, even after all this time. Don’t worry, you’ll enjoy it. You always did before.”
Steve rips his mouth away, turning his head to watch from the corner of his eye as he pulls Tony's hand free. The plug drops over the side of the bed in the next few seconds, and Tony's cock gives a hard throb in anticipation.
“Oh, ha ha,” Sam replied. He folded his arms on the bar edge after putting the glass back and looked up to the television. “I can’t believe he’s actually doing it. That crazy son-of-a-bitch is the only one who could, and he’s still probably going to show up a week from now in a body bag.”
When the check was presented, Tony automatically reached for his wallet, but Steve beat him to it with a smile and an insistent press of the bill back to the server.
Tony swore viciously and shot off towards the closest connected plane. Panels all along his suit opened and flared, sending out hundreds of projectiles that expanded and thrummed into life. They slammed along the side of the plane as Tony severed the jet bridge and then, all together, they began to push the plane towards the other.
“Four?” Tony’s voiced cracked on the word, rough from a dry throat. He obeyed, though, shifting himself slowly as he took stock of each tight pull of muscle. His left leg was thick beneath the blanket and a shift to the side let Tony know that it was wrapped in a cast.
Crossbones sighed like it was the biggest hassle and pulled forward a large shotgun that had been strapped to his back.
“I’ll be in touch.” Frank gave Iron Man a nod, holding a hand towards the door. “It’s gotten pretty icy out, so I’ll take you to your motel.”
“You will, Anthony,” Maria replied, voice heavy with sorrow. Tony doesn’t trust her. When they brought him market prosthetics, he rejected them all. Howard never visited.
There was no response, so Tony twisted to see if he could get out on the passenger side. He reached for the passenger seat to pull himself across the car. There was too much pain to focus on what might have been broken, but when he coughed again, the back of his hand was covered in red. He grimaced, forcing back another cough and clawed his way out of his trashed car.
“Is it any wonder I get smashed at the damn memorials? They love me like they love the circus. Something spectacular. A trainwreck. Nascar cras-”
“Make sure you eat it all up, Master Anthony,” Melissa said smartly, straightening his hair from where she'd messed it. “You have a busy day ahead of you.”
Tony makes a noise of frustrated disgust and finally opens his faceplate. He’s scowling through a head wound that pours into his eyes. “It seems I made your suit a little too well.”
“But that doesn’t make it right,” Tony rasped. His throat was thick with emotion, with the knowledge that Steve’s eidetic memory meant he was going to relive every abusive moment with his father in perfect detail for as long as the serum made him live.
Steve wrenched himself out of Tony’s distraction, dragging Tony with him by slamming his hands to the table on either side of Tony’s naked hips. His own clothed hips pressed against the edge of the table, against Tony’s ass. He hummed as the visuals dissolved like wisps of smoke in the air, and he tipped his head down to tease Tony with the tip of his tongue. He licked the metal ring against Tony’s mouth and rocked his hardening cock against Tony’s body. He let it settle between Tony's cheeks to rub against his skin with the rough denim he'd chosen to replace his uniform with.
“It was a pleasure meeting you in person finally. I look forward to seeing you again, Captain America.”
Steve shrugged, taking a few moments to chew as he waved his hand. Tony ignored the endearing warmth at the sight and looked around the small café. He wasn’t much of a people watcher, but the café was close to SHIELD and a lot of personnel tended to pass through.
He'd just made the decision to ask Steve this morning, but he sits now on the plush couch in Steve's apartment, feeling a numbness settling into his bones.
It's December now, though, and Tony kind of wants to take Steve home to New York for a real snowy Christmas, not Malibu's beach equivalent. After all, no one needs to know the truth of their three month friendship to go to Times Square.
Shock rippled visibly through the crowd, confusion rising in tides and murmurs as Tony looked gravely from the crowd to directly at the camera. For just a moment, Steve felt Tony was looking solely at him. His gaze was dark and solemn, decisive.
"You have enemies on the inside, Tony," Steve says against Tony’s ear and smiles in the dark as he feels his lover shiver. "I’m protecting you from them."
He’d decided a long time ago that Hitler’s death was too easy for Pierce. He wouldn’t let Pierce evade him that way, deny him the satisfaction of ripping out his heart and even eating it if he wanted.
The realization threatened to drown him, made his spine chill, but the clicking and hissing of Tony’s armor chased it all away, left him tense and quivering in position. He didn’t want to be blindfolded anymore. He wanted to be able to look up, to watch Tony step out of the black armor, watch the red and gold panels gleam and contract beneath the bright laboratory lights.
“I don’t know, Pep,” Tony says, trying not to sound as blissed out as he is. “They’re pretty shameless, not much we can embarrass them with.”
Candace lost her battle with the yawn and turned slightly to hide it behind her arm. “Oh, I’m sorry about that. No, not at all. Jim just finished setting up the bar, so it should be fine. Did you want a water while you wait?”
It’d only been a month and a half since Tony had answered his ad when Bucky moved out, but apparently that was long enough for Tony to settle in, make a home out of something that had once scared him more than he’d admit.
“I mean, yeah, people’ve died, but they die everyday, and you don’t see anyone calling out the so-called heroes when they don’t save everyone. And what about the cops that-” She stopped there and rolled her eyes at herself, “Sorry. It’s just I have to listen to the same news reports over and over, and they can really start to wear a person down with all their negativity.”
Tony steps between Steve’s legs and tilts Steve’s head up, fingers gently framing his jaw. “Did you wash like we talked about,” he asks softly, gaze focused only on Steve’s face, his expression, checking for any sign of doubt or hesitance.
Victor watched Tony in silence for a moment then rolled his eyes again and pushed away from the desk to stand closer to the screen too, to stand closer to Tony. After a minute or two, he frowned and heard Tony hold his breath.
The War Machine goes dark, leaning back as the vital signs fail and the locks are released. Pepper is frozen in shock, dangerously unguarded, and Steve can’t process anything that’s beyond kick-punch-move as he struggles to get to Pepper and Rhodey. But he sees Bucky isn’t coming their way. He’s standing off to the side, seemingly taking his cues from Tony who is still standing a few feet away, watching Pepper break down over Rhodey. Sam’s damaged wings are signalling his position on a rooftop where he’s firing back at the agents closing in on Clint.
“God, that stuff must be strong if it’s got you of all people grimacing.” The seat beside Steve was being filled and the smile came easily to Steve’s face.
He pressed the number for his floor then leaned back, resting his head against the wall and crossing his arms. Watching the numbers climb, he thought about the weight Tony had still carried long after they’d returned to the helicarrier. Through the glass windows of the lab, Tony had looked paranoid and distracted even as he’d gestured wildly between Agent Coulson and the litter of robot pieces they’d hauled back. He’d caught sight of Steve watching eventually and had turned his back, but not before Steve had seen his haunted gaze.
"So you understand, right?" Steve says, looking pained in a way that Tony can't tell if it's genuine or not. "I can't make her do this alone, Tony. I've always loved her, you see, and now that... Now that she's pregnant... Peggy and I-"
Tony stumbles and braces a hand against the bar midway up the glass panels. The door chimes and begins to slide shut. Pepper is very warm and Tony realizes he’s practically trapped her against the bar.
“He’s a teacher,” Tony stated flatly, placing a pick between his teeth as he leaned forward to scribble some notes along the margin of his music sheet.
Steve blinks slowly and uses the tip of his tongue to wet his bottom lip. “I did,” he assures Tony. “I might...have used more of that soap than was really needed, but better safe than sorry, right?”
“I’ll walk with you,” Steve said immediately. He almost saluted Pierce then seemed to make the forceful decision not to. He did nod in acknowledgement and said ‘Sir,” before following Tony out of the café.
The streets of London have never been a favorite of Steve’s. He thinks they’re full of snobby, tilt-nosed hypocrites that will sooner piss on the poor than in the golden chamber pots they stash under their beds. He adjusts the sit of his cloak as he walks in the crisp night air. The blue fabric is nearly black even under the street lamps and he makes a tutting noise low in his throat. He amends that New York is not much better in the way of morality, despite what the well-to-dos there might think.
That brought Tony’s heart back online with a shuddering, angry beat. He bit into his cheek and reminded himself what it would feel like when he put his fist through the man’s poster-like smile.
The tsk through the faceplate might not have been completely audible to anyone else, but the Captain sure heard it. He was already propelling himself forward as Tony lifted a little further in the air.
“Hey,” Steve smiles, a soft expression meant to put them both at ease. “I didn’t think you were coming out.”
…The thought slips away, and he doesn’t even mourn its passing. He closes his eyes and lets it go. Another one takes its place.
There was a soft huff of warm amusement against his ear and then: “I understand how angry it makes you, but I really wish you’d stop breaking the radio. I’ve replaced it twice now.”
“No!” Tony shouted as his younger self lost consciousness. The black pulled him in, left him suspended again, and he felt like he would throw up. He hated magic, loathed its power with a passion because he couldn’t fight it, never could even when he practiced with Victor. He was spinning, dizzy and disoriented.
“Looks like you got a beast for a guard dog, Stark.” There was a sharp curse, and the fence shook as the soldier shoved the elf against the planks. It was hard, in the dark, to distinguish the elf’s dark clothes from his skin, but Stephanie was pretty sure she’d dream of those red eyes for the rest of her life.
“A statement or a claim?” Tony wondered sardonically, raising his brows. He pulled his glasses from his face and tucked them inside his suit jacket before reaching for his sunglasses from the other pocket.
"Get your goddamn heads out of your asses and pay attention to what the fuck I'm saying to you. Like it or not, you two are on the same goddamn team now. You're going to work together and you’re gonna get along because I said so. Do I make myself clear?”
Steve wouldn’t let Tony speed up. He pinned Tony’s hips to the bed and made him take his cock in a steady pace. In and out, he watched himself disappear inside Tony’s body, stretching him open.
General Carter leaned back in her seat. “Insightful. Alright, fine. I won’t tolerate fighting in my camp, Titanborn. Find a way to deal with it, or I will. And I promise, it will not be pretty. Dismissed.”
“There’s no reason why you should allow them to hurt you. You came to my aid without question and yet…” Natasha trailed off and shrugged. She turned to keep walking, lifting her hands to the bulk of her curls. Dark fingers slid through the dark hair to pin it all up at the crown of her head.
“I missed you, Tones,” was pressed into his neck, slurred against his jaw. And Tony felt sick, felt the shudder-sweep of nausea roll through his stomach. He couldn’t lift his hands. They stayed against the door, limp and useless. “Tell me you missed me too. I want to hear you say it.”
“What the fuck is wrong with you?!” he yelled, hauling Tony and the armor up off the ground. “Do you even know how many people you’ve killed? You could’ve… You could’ve killed us!”
“Not full pieces like Steve does, I don’t have the patience. I’m mostly here for the alterations and finishing touches.” Sam stops at a counter that’s midway back in the shop. It has an updated P.O.S. system from Stark Industries and Tony smiles a little when he sees it.
“Just imagine what dessert will be like.” Steve’s smile is addictive and sweet. Tony stares at him and notes his eyes are the color of the fabric he’d liked so much.
“Yeah, that was some dress,” Tony murmurs then shakes himself out of the memory. “Oh, yeah. I’m definitely going. You and Rhodey have gone. It’s about time I meet who’s been putting his hands all over my friends.”
“It's okay, Master Anthony,” he heard Melissa whisper. Or maybe she spoke normally, but his consciousness slipped from him as he felt cool fingers at his brow. “It’ll be over soon.”
Tony watched Ty’s face absently as the demo played, rocking in his seat until the two front legs came off the ground. His expression was blank as he stared at the ceiling, but Tony was used to Ty’s listening face.
“I don’t go to them anymore,” Steve replied, following Tony into the kitchen. When Tony turned to look at him, Steve was gingerly pulling his shirt over his head. Tony had to grip the back of the chair at the table. Steve’s entire left side and across his stomach were mottled in bruises already so dark that Tony could barely see the blood around the puncture wound in Steve’s gut.
“People leave their jobs all the time!” Tony exclaimed, letting go to fall back on the bed. Steve twisted to look at him, sliding the tie free from his button-down and watching as he slid it through his fingers. Tony was staring angrily at the ceiling, bare chest heaving just a little with a frustrated breath. “Women take sabbaticals for babies.”
Tony wouldn’t give Victor the satisfaction of an outward response, though the blood pounded around the wound.
“Can you feel how hard you are anymore?” Steve wondered, “You’ve been hard for so long. I know it began to run together for me. This must feel like torture.”
“You were a mess when I found you,” Steve said, his profile a pensive expression from what Tony could see. He turned from the window and strode over to the table just out of Tony’s reach where a pitcher and a stack of paper cups were placed. He poured a cup and stepped up to the bed just close enough to hand over the cup without making Tony stretch for it. But he came no closer. “Do you remember what happened?”
“No. There’s nothing left to say,” Tony said after a moment. He grabbed a sweatshirt and his cane, leaving the room. He planned to hide in the lab for as long as he could, definitely not thinking about how Steve felt stretched around his dick. It would be a long day indeed.
“No, that’s game night with Ms. Maggie next door, remember?” Tony pointed out. “You promised her a casserole.”
Tony, being the bastard coward that he was, fled with dignity, hearing Steve’s door click shut behind him.
“So it sounds like a motorcycle instead of running silent like the others,” Tony mused as he walked up to it and then around it to midpoint. He reached a hand out to smooth his fingers over the industrial material. “Hey, baby,” he crooned, “Daddy’s come to fix you.”
When movement in the corridor outside of Stark’s room caught his attention, he knew he’d gotten his wish. Poised on the balls of his feet and aided by the point of his bow, his balance was perfect and still. He wanted to lunge forward into the fray, but the distance was too great and their plan required him to start heading into the city. So, he was left to watching Stark wake up swinging, surely alerted by some program of Jarvis’ or his own instincts bringing him out of sleep with a shock of warning.
“I try to be a good soldier,” Stephanie heard herself say, fixated on the nimble movements of Natasha’s hands. “Despite the unit treating me the way they do. Being afraid and attacking me because of it...I do my best, but in a camp full of people, I’ve never felt more alone. I’m not as strong as you think I am.”
It’s not the first time, he’s sure, but it’s the first time that it hits him so plainly between the eyes.
Steve’s fist smashed into Victor’s mouth before he finished, and while it was purely jealousy that fueled the hit, it was satisfying in a primal, possessive way.
“I know, baby,” Steve murmured, smirking. He massaged Tony’s perineum, the beginning curves of his ass cheeks, teased and stroked. He breathed in deeply, let it out on a growling groan. “You’re so flushed… Straining up and so wet for me.”
"I'll like it even more when it's doing its job,” Tony replies, rocking his hips up into the space between them.
Tony killed one of his boots to twist himself around and drive a hand into the Doombot’s jetpack. It reared back, cutting its own momentum and slamming its metal foot into Tony’s armored gut with enough force to send Tony careening through the stone side of a nearby building. The wall crumbled, and he had to blast his way out from under the brick before he got buried.
“Missy!” he called in dual tones, choking and desperate for help, needing to get out of the nightmare. It wasn’t Melissa that came to comfort him, though. The hand in his hair was too large, too strong. It stroked through his damp curls, tightening at the back of his head. He was crying, body struggling against the poison, and there was a soft, low hum before Steve’s easy smile came into view.
The screaming then was not Tony, but civilians. Jarvis was in his ear, staticky and broken, worrying after his health and letting him know that SHIELD was on the scene now to maintain and contain. Which was good, because Tony felt like death inside the suit, pale and wet with fear and sweat. Everything hurt, but nothing more than his head. It pounded at the assault he’d been forced through, and it seemed too much an effort to pick himself up.
Steve swallows, parts his lips and wets them once as he meets Tony's gaze. Tony stiffens, hand moving almost in a blur as little "un un"s break through his held breath.
Clint had died before Tony’s laughter. It had taken the asset two days to fully clean the room, and the whole while, Tony had watched the stages of Steve’s grief and anger closely. He traced the tears with his fingers, let Steve break one with his teeth when he didn’t move his hand away quick enough. Steve continued to struggle, tearing in vain at his own body until he was a bloody, exhausted mess, left to heal overnight.
Steve growled and dropped down to his forearms, trapping Tony’s legs over his elbows, trapping Tony’s hand and cock between their stomachs.
“Mr. Fury is going to be here tonight with Ms. Potts in about an hour,” Steve reminded him quietly, thumbs sweeping over Tony’s temples. “I have to start dinner.”
“Why them?” he whispers, eyes burning from the raw, putrid emotion stripping him down to nothing. “Why them and not us?”
Sam downed his drink and visibly struggled not to come up coughing. Steve watched him patiently, leaning his cheek on his fist.
“What the fuck was that?” he asked the empty room. Chills chased their way down Tony’s arms, and he swung his legs over the side of the bed. His dick was still twitching in his pants like he’d actually been having fucking mind blowing sex with Steve.
“You’re out of your mind,” Tony scoffed. He shifted his weight, leaning more heavily on the cane in his grasp. Dr. Cho’s nanobytes were amazing, but his knee would still take a few more days to return to normal. He made sure to keep the bed between him and Fury, though Fury hadn’t moved from his position by the door since he’d entered, since he’d given Tony his supposed ultimatum.
He watched his own face in the dream, slack for all of Ty’s manhandling. He watched as his other self never even registered the door opening, Pepper’s shouting, and Ty’s rough movements as he dragged Tony off the bed with him.
Steve's cock was leaving damp spots of precum against the hospital sheets, already soaked from Tony's spit leaving him a dripping mess. It became trapped between Steve and Tony's tailored suit, and he rocked up into Tony with abandon, chasing the pleasure and friction.
Tony grit his teeth and compelled his broken body towards the side of the road again, hauling himself to the shotgun. His hands were freezing, his entire body shivering in the cold since his business suit had definitely not been made for crawling around in the dead of winter. So his grip was numb when he fumbled the shotgun up and around.
“Don’t say that! You’re amazing!” Steve immediately defended, grasping Tony’s hand. “Just because your father doesn’t think you are, doesn’t mean anything! You’re brilliant and generous and worth more than every damn cent he took from you.”
Tony watches Steve’s throat move as he swallows, drags his gaze over the restrained flexing of his lover’s body. “You’re so goddamn sexy.”
“That’s… That’s not what I want. I’m not here to change the way everything’s run. I just want to expose the truth,” Tony said fiercely.
“I’d have to hear your platform first,” Steve teased, leaning down to kiss Tony goodbye, “Text me later and tell me how the tour went and if the kids loved your robots as much as I do.”
He tried to blink, but his eyes wouldn’t open. The weight of his body still held him down, and his breathing was beginning to slow. He tried to grasp at his train of thought, Tony and his feelings, but everything was slipping through his fingers until finally…
“Just Steve is fine, Mr. Stark,” Steve smiles, amused, and that’s good for Tony, that Steve doesn’t think he’s irritating already. “Miss Potts said you were interested in a full suit?”
“Well, I would, but I’m telling you that it’s not him. Victor wouldn’t be this needlessly cruel. Whoever is running these fake bots is also running the fake Iron Man, and I bet you… I
Steve fumed quietly for a moment before letting out a harsh exhale through his nose. He glanced at Thor and Loki and drew himself up to his full height.
Tony catches hints of paint on Steve's other hand before both are sliding into Tony's hair and holding his head still for Steve's kiss. It's hard and demanding for all that it's inviting Tony closer, deeper with each slip and sweep of their tongues.
“Our copycat is getting sloppy,” he said, tossing a faceplate one way and some ripped out wires another. He pointed to the empty robot, “He’s not even trying anymore. These certainly run on magic, and Cap, I don’t know if you know this, but not everyone can use magic ‘round these parts.”
“Now, now, Captain. SHIELD holds exclusive contracts with SI, so you can have the pleasure of my… company anytime you’d like.” And didn’t that just garner a delightful shade of pink to dust the Captain’s cheek and nose?
Tony thought of the chasm splitting himself and Steve apart. He felt like he was standing on the edge of it, the wind tearing at his clothes. Between them was his suit and Pierce, and Tony didn’t have the heart to jump, because he was pretty sure there wouldn’t be anyone on the other side to catch him. In the end, he’d have to just step forward, let gravity take him instead. After all, that’s what he’d planned from the beginning.
That was Tony and Pierce’s cue to to exchange past due greetings, but Tony’s heart was currently stopped in his chest as he stared at Steve.
It had thrown him off balance with the abrupt cease of stimulation, long enough that Pepper had knocked on the door to drag him out for his business lunch.
“Yes, I have. Cafeteria’s got tacos today,” Jerry said unhelpfully as he towed a crate of scrap from another project and passed where they stood inside the turbine.
“You got me. Gotta go for the heart-punch, but that’s my point. You’re saving lives too, and you can act like a bad guy all you want, but we both know you’re not. Your revenge isn’t all about revenge. You’re trying to save this city at the same time. Just like we are.”
Steve’s distraction costs him the footing he’d made with Bucky, and he’s thrown two blocks away with the concussive force of the impact. He loses sight of Bucky. Clint loses an eye and two of his fingers, but he’s still standing between Rhodey’s broken suit and Tony as he crawls out of the hole. The arrow that’s notched is covered in blood, and Clint’s aim is steady.
“Look, I ain’t sayin’ yes, but let me mull it over. There’s gotta be an easier way to go about this. I’ll be in touch about it, but you gotta stay away from those shipments of his. You’re only getting more people killed, and I know. You’re all about the ‘needs of the many’ or whatever shit you like to spout, but those people got families that ain’t ever seein’ them anymore, so if we do this, you’re gonna let those shipments go.”
Tony gets a hand on Steve's chest, and he barely has to exert any pressure before Steve is stepping back. Desire is a good look on the man, Tony sees, pupils blown and lips bruised.
“No!” Tony yelled, the sound mechanical as it came from the suit’s mouthpiece. Foregoing trying to wrestle his way out of the Captain’s ironlike grip, Tony simply flung one hand back towards the Captain and fired at first one shoulder then the other. The first was ducked, the second taken directly to the Captain’s shoulder. The Captain’s hold loosened just enough for Iron Man to fire a boot’s repulsor into the Captain’s side to push off of him towards Crossbones.
Tony knew exactly where Pierce was going with that, and he clasped his fingers together as he raised his brows. He hadn’t brought it up to Steve yet, so he wasn’t going to be the one to initiate the conversation there either.
Tony had had years of practice at hiding the revulsion that oozed down his spine at the sound of that voice, more than enough that when he lifted his gaze to watch Steve rise from his seat, he appeared merely bemused at being interrupted. He pulled his napkin from his lap as Steve reached out to take Alexander Pierce’s hand.
“Yeah, maybe that’s one thing you’re right about,” Steve growled. He took the case with him when he left.
So at least Tony was relaxed when the truck rammed into him from behind on the overpass. His car spun on the slick road as the airbag deployed. He felt his thumb break under the impact and then the truck hit again, t-boning him on the driver side. Screeching metal rent the air and his car crashed into the concrete barrier, hitting it at just the right angle to arc up and over the barrier as it flipped.
Another series of alerts pinged around Tony’s HUD as the Captain and the decimated airport disappeared from view. The pings grated on Tony’s nerves until he growled shortly.
He can’t even take off the helmet and he doesn’t know if he wants to. There’s a pit in his stomach that tells him he won’t want to face this.
“I’m quivering in anticipation,” Tony says absently, mostly true actually. He’s been dying to see this ‘miracle tailor’ in action. “Do you tailor, Sam?”
Tony has been so blind, so stupid, allowing himself to believe they could be something when Steve had never intended that. Every word and action perfectly acted to draw Tony in and keep him there, aided by Tony's fear of loss and other neuroses.
A second later, the EMP field launched. For a moment, Tony’s entire world blotted out, losing hearing and vision inside the suit. His heart seized, but only briefly, before his auxiliary power flickered on through the arc reactor. The mechanics in his suit were a bit stiffer in this mode, but it would have to suffice as he shifted clunkily off the deadened bodies of the bots. His joints whined and protested, but he managed to kneel beside the pile, uncaring of the scraping of his suit on the ground.
“Look at you,” Tony says. “You’re so fucking gone on it. You wanna do this again already, don’t you, and we’re not even finished yet. I can feel it inside you, sliding and fucking you. Is it good? Does it feel like when I’m fucking you, baby? When I’m sliding my dick inside you and dragging it slowly out?”
to find a way back into the conversation. But it’s moving too fast and he can’t think of a single thing to contribute. His mind deserts him, leaves his thoughts blank, and the emptiness sends him reeling.
As Steve’s climax burned bright and hot through him in response, he heard Tony whisper brokenly. “You’re so beautiful, Steve. Steve, please… Please…”
Tony panted at the porcelain basin, hands gripping the counter until his knuckles were white. He closed his eyes and tried to calm his breathing.
Steve carefully cupped Tony’s chin up to brush a chaste kiss, and his laugh was warm against Tony’s mouth as they met.
But he was already on the ground, wasn’t he? Then how was he still falling, falling forward, falling through the asphalt and then the world until he was suspended in an endless black. Still on his knees, he blinked frantically, trying to see something, anything that would make sense.
They shouldn’t have been operating, that was easy enough to tell. It had only been the magic moving them along. More of a hollow, empty shell than any of the robots Tony had ever worked on, and he hated it. It left him feeling empty, too, like he’d been the one hollowed out and manipulated.
“It’s a love song,” he answered. “Now, who can tell me about the Manhattan Project from their review last night?”
He thought he spoke, but he couldn’t be sure, and his mind tried to remember why that was a problem. Something about Ty. A warm hand on his shoulder. But the beating was coming back louder, faster. Something in his throat was blocking his shout.
The mage hummed noncommittally and left the General’s tent. There was a beat of silence, and Stephanie shifted on her stool. It creaked and, finally, the General turned around.
“Well, sometimes a man has to make time for the important things,” Steve answered and indicated Tony with an open hand, “I try not to miss a lunch date when my boyfriend’s time is so valuable. I’m sure you know how it is.”
“Ready the course for Latveria,” Tony muttered as Captain America dropped to the ground from the jet hovering safely above the crime scene. He guessed he’d be acting the part a little longer.
Over the next few weeks, Tony cleans up, sells the penthouse and enjoys Steve's sporadic-to-steady company. He tells Steve about Rumiko and the mugging that took her life when Tony wasn't strong enough to stop it.
“I have faith that you’ll take excellent care of me,” Steve said quietly and Tony searched Steve’s face before touching his cheek briefly.
“Jarvis?!” Tony shouted as the two beams of energy connected and shockwaved out with enough unforgiving force to rip apart the GCT terminal. In a corner of his HUD, Tony saw the body count rise, but it was dismissed, shunted to the side under the push forward to slam into Crossbones. He staggered down to a knee as Crossbones flew backwards into a crumbled pile of metal containers.
“You’re a goddamn idiot,” Fury muttered then laughed, rubbing hand over his head and eyeing Tony appraisingly. “Put on the suit. Fight alongside Captain America until I can get you to Pierce without a doubt in anyone’s mind. And I promise I will get you there, and I promise I’ll pull your dumb ass out of the fire before you go up in flames. And maybe, by the end of it, you’ll realize that taking the helmet off will be the best thing for this city.”
“Such a-such a pervert,” Tony teased breathlessly, smacking at Steve’s shoulder before dropping his hand to tiptoe his fingers down his own stomach.
But the world faded out before Steve could respond as, down in the detainment center, Tony jerked awake violently. Wide-eyed and heart racing, he ripped the blanket off the bed and stared in horror at the very obvious wet stain spreading across the SHIELD-issued, blue sweatpants.
He sets the package down and gets the top opened. He bends one flap back and peers inside. The only thing he pulls out is a small slip of scrap paper. It sits tight in his fist as he sits down and stares listlessly at the package.
“Jarvis,” and Tony hated how rough his voice was, how truthful it was in the wake of Steve’s surprise assault. The suit didn’t move for a brief moment, before it disassembled and collected itself inside the case. It shut and locked neatly after itself, waiting for Steve’s possession as he finally moved away from Tony.
Eventually, they released him from the hospital, and Maria was there to take him home. The ride was silent, and he sat close to his own window. His wrist stayed cradled to his stomach as his phantom fingers tapped out the
He hadn’t asked why; it wasn’t his place, but he knows now. That information is fed to the part of him that is still aware that he’s not in control. It threatens to flood him with rage, but nothing comes as he drops the duffel and the body. He watches Steve hit the floor with a blank expression, hears Tony come up to his side.
The next time Tony woke up, the mask was gone and so were the cuffs. He wondered if he’d dreamed the whole experience, but the empty IV stand just on the edge of his view proved that wrong. Beyond that, Steve’s broad back blocked the view from the window. Tony’s throat tightened at the sight and he tried to sit up, feeling far too vulnerable lying down.
The thought was fleeting, gone before Tony was really aware of thinking it, and he followed it to the muffled sound of a low rumble that vibrated Tony’s arm down into sleep.
“Oh, of course,” Rogers said easily, “That was nothing, but I think I damaged the panel you just put on.”
“I don’t go because those doctors are never in a hurry to get me patched up.” He stopped there as Tony’s hands tightened in his hair. Tony was staring ahead at the fridge, not seeing it as he absorbed Steve’s words. Quietly, one of Steve’s palms pressed against Tony’s hip. “I’m gonna be fine, Tony.”
He ripped the blindfold off, wanting to see Tony’s eyes as he crested his release. Tony blinked blearily at him, eyes dazed and unfocused, red-rimmed and wet, and then they crinkled in what Steve could only assume was amusement.
Fury muttered about the disbelief in his life as he turned away to preserve his sanity. “You’ve got two hours, Mr. Stark, and then I’ll have to
Tony forced his shoulders to relax, and he turned in the tight space Steve had left him to face him. He looked up at Steve, saw Steve see the bruising from his hit the day before, saw the wince, and smiled sadly in satisfaction.
“C-Code Tammy!” he nearly shouts, stuttering it at Pepper like a lifeline. His cock is so goddamn hard, he doesn’t think he’s going to be able to ever stand up. He doesn’t think he could jerk off on the table three times and actually lose his erection. He’s so fucking hard, is what he means.
“I hate you, Barton,” Tony decided, trying to at least start to sit up, but he felt like none of the messages he was sending to his limbs were reaching their destinations.
“With all due respect, General,” Stephanie began, hesitated, then continued. “My past is just that. I’d like to keep it that way. I’m here because I believe I can do some good, and if I have to deal with a few bumps along the way…” She shrugged.
I think you can do,” Fury continued, “Despite how you’ve attempted to handle things, you’ve been doing good keeping Hydra from getting their weapons where they want them to be. Granted, we’ve lost a lot along the way too.”
“-turbines one and two were performing normally, but turbine three kept sputtering. No one believed that I could tell the difference, but Fury said to pull it and bring you in. So, we brought the carrier down, and after a hell of lot of noise, there’s now the biggest engine I’ve ever seen in my life in the working bay. ”
And Tony could kiss her for her own humor. Something tells him that she wouldn’t appreciate the gesture at this moment though. He dumps the plug into the sink and lets hot water run over it as he cleans himself up.
There are three days left, but Steve knows it doesn't matter anymore. He can see the end coming a mile away, and he’s powerless to stop it. After all the deaths he’s borne witness to, he doesn’t want to stop it. He blinks blearily at the floor then closes his eyes. There is no need to, no need to sleep. He has no will to fight, so rest is pointless, but his body decides otherwise and drags him into sleep.
Not expecting the strange sensation morphing into pleasure that sent his stomach swooping, he’d actually sobbed into his gag and gotten dizzy where he knelt. He had to force himself not to fuck into the feeling, each thrust earning him an answering thrust of the plug inside of him. The pulses of the e-stim rod were sporadic, turned on only from Tony’s whim, and the pace and duration of it varied. Slow. Fast. Staccato. On and off for almost an hour.
“No, he wasn’t,” Tony replied, tone warning Clint to let it go. He didn’t need reminding as he dropped his hand.
He heard Rogers shift, a small intake of breath just a little sharper than normal. He glanced over at Rogers and raised his brows.
Tony bites his lip and thrusts against the man's grip. There's only a little resistance as the man chuckles, low and knowing.
Someone IS going through his mail. Someone is seeing the post cards and he's not stupid enough to think that they don't also know who's sending them.
“It is currently 6:34a.m., sir, and you’ve been asleep for nearly four and a half hours. Your vital signs are slightly elevated and your toxicity levels are normal.”
“Villains like you make me sick,” he spat. “What was your objective here? What could you possibly want to not even care about the innocent people -the
The announcement threw the crowd into an uproar while Tony looked on grimly. Steve saw Sam down another shot and sit down heavily, scrubbing a hand through his short hair. Steve couldn’t agree more; if Tony was right about Pierce, then revealing the nature of their deaths was nothing short of his own death sentence.
Ronin didn’t visibly react. He just replied with a sardonic, “You look like shit,” that got a pained, tired laugh out of Tony.
Pepper hadn’t noticed and he’d let her continue as if nothing was amiss all the while surreptitiously looking for Steve or Bucky. Certainly he’d know if they’d come down to the lower floors.
Tony didn’t catch the name of the reporter as he clutched the rim of the trash can with shaking, weak hands and vomited violently. Just as he thought it was over, his stomach heaved again, seizing the breath in his throat. His eyes watered, his entire body drenched in sick-sweat, as he struggled to draw in air around his body’s seemingly-automatic convulsions.
“I’m stopping you,” the Captain ground out and Iron Man threw his head forward into the Captain’s, using a palm against his chest to help shoot the Captain away.
“Don’t think so,” Crossbones cut him off, dragging Tony up by the throat until they were upright and Tony’s feet weren’t touching the ground. All the blood rushed downward to his knee and leg until Tony felt dizzy with agony. Instinctively, he grabbed at Crossbones’ arm, trying to free himself from his grip.
“Hey, asshole!” Tony shouted, and was smugly satisfied when it managed to draw even the littlest of Crossbones’ attention, enough that his masked face turned towards Tony. Tony didn’t even waste time on a snappy one-liner, just fired the shotgun at as point-blank range as he could get.
The honey-soft scent of Pepper’s perfume filled his mind and her whispered words were damp with fear and anger.
Coming up on his knee must have been all Iron Man had strength to do, because he didn’t move anymore the closer the Captain got to him. That was fine by Steve. He planted a hand right against the faceplate and slammed Iron Man’s head back into the wall. More of the cement cracked and crumbled to the sidewalk, and Iron Man bent backward as the hydraulics in his suit whined their displeasure.
“I do like Amara’s,” he muttered and was rewarded with a gentle squeeze to the nape of his neck. He rolled his eyes and muttered; “Yeah, fine. Whatever. Just...tell me when.”
“Tell… Steve… I won’t… make dinner,” Tony said then laughed, and laughed until he was throwing up again. It didn’t look like Steve would be making dinner either.
They can, however, peg him for bad decisions, and as previously mentioned, this is a spectacularly bad one. Tony can see the man like a damn beacon in this dimly-lit hellhole; with blonde hair and blue eyes so bright, he can't help but draw notice in the sea of dark clothes and creaking leather.
Tony laughed; he couldn’t help it, and it rankled him a little, but he didn’t let that emotion through. “Catholic boy, huh? I should’ve known. You’ve got a bit of that caged wildness about you.”
“One minute, sir,” Jarvis warned, but Tony wasn’t listening. His vision had blurred and his body had frozen, stuck staring at the wires that were climbing up around his arms. They glowed a faint green, and Tony felt himself leaning forward, falling...
People began streaming out around the damaged vehicles blocking the way, dragging kids and dogs and belongings they didn’t truly need. There was blood and crying and a hell of a lot of screaming, but Tony turned his back on them just as a Doombot barreled into him from the side.
"Doctor Doom hasn't been seen for sometime, then you're detained and suddenly he's popping back up? Get back inside, Stark, before I carry you myself."
“You’re a stubborn jackass, Captain, but fine. I’ll give you one shot to figure this out your way, but I’m telling you right now. The public won’t accept him like this. The second they find out he’s Iron Man, Stark’s name is as good as dead.”
He learned enough over the years that if he played his personality large and loud, no one paid too close attention to the gauntlet that never left his hand. They don’t ask the questions they should, and they never look too closely to the dark circles under Tony’s eyes.
Two smaller explosions brought the rest of the Terminal down to rubble and more of Tony’s repulsors powered down, dropping out of the air. Tony followed them down, suit standing steadily as he shook violently inside it.
“A woman born of giants and you think you’re not worthy to be met?” Natasha laughed, the husky whorl of it warming Stephanie’s gut.
The man's hand is as large and warm as promised, unhesitating as it fists Tony's cock and pumps him to fully hard in a surprisingly short amount of time considering the volume liquor Tony's consumed this evening.
“Leave him alone,” and yeah, Tony knew that voice, struggling further when Crossbones grabbed his other leg as he kicked. Ronin appeared again, astride Crossbones back. The black and yellow mask hid his identity well, but Tony knew that recurve bow like the back of his hand. Seeing it in action was satisfying in a visceral way.
Tony makes it halfway across the living room before he registers what he’s seeing. It’s dark and the moon is only splitting through the blinds unevenly. He could be forgiven, he thinks, that it takes him that long.
“Make fun of my boyfriend for being a huge sap?” he whispered. “For being so ridiculously in love with me that he wants to actually go in a tandem love boat regardless of his image? Never.”
“Run,” he thinks he says, but the world is already falling away, and he hopes that he gets to see Carol again when this is all over. He thinks he could really love that woman for the rest of his life. He thinks of the ring on the dresser in his apartment, hidden there because Carol stays in his room at the Tower. He thinks of his last year at MIT and how he and Tony had promised to marry each other when he was fifty and inevitably still single.
Tony finds himself staring at the pretzels as he listens to Clint make an inside joke with Natasha, hears the rest of the table snicker despite not having all of the details.
Steve laughed and pushed to his feet, slinking into Tony’s space heedless of the other people wandering about the block-wide garage sale. Tony’s breath hitched as Steve nuzzled in against his cheek.
His hand comes around her throat; her pulse jumps against the flesh of his fingers. He knows he is not to do this with the cold metal of his prosthetic. He is meant to feel this, as he felt it years ago. He does. Her blood pumps quickly to flood around the pressure points of his fingers as he squeezes.
Oh, yes. If the Captain had been brunette, Tony would have had him spread out on the table by now. He wondered idly at the sounds Rogers’ baritone could produce while he replayed his answer.
Tony fidgeted a little, letting his gaze sweep over Steve’s gray suit, the clean and crisp lines of the pressed fabric. “No, it’s not, but we all have to eat. I’m finding it not such a hardship.” The smile this time felt normal, felt genuine.
“Oh,” Bucky replies, blinking owlishly at Tony like he’d forgotten Tony was at the table. “Thanks, Stark,” but he’s already turning his attention back to the pale yellow he’s painting Natasha’s toenails.
His mother had gone on trip to Aspen for one of her fundraising benefits, so when the maid had found Maria’s prescription bottle in Tony’s room, she’d gone to Howard.
That earned a brighter smile from Steve, and Tony felt his breath catch a little. Before he could stop himself, he asked; “You’re a History teacher, right? I bet that’s fun.”
“Sir?” he hears his valet question, but Steve is already striding forward. There’s a sheen of red on the man’s temple that has slid into the man’s unkempt hair.Or from it, Steve thinks with a frown of distaste.
Tony dragged his gaze up from the case to Steve’s face, another realization pouring acid through his veins, burning him alive. He watched the pedestal under Steve crack and crumble to dust, his trusting scattered to the winds.
/, and he nearly cries, feels the sobs shaking loose in his shoulders and is forced to curl in on himself.
The next morning when Steve gathers his gym bag, a little scrap of paper sits atop it. Steve recognizes Tony’s scrawl ‘Wesley - Dark Night of the Soul’ and he already knows what song it is when he loads it on his music player for his jog.
“Jesus Christ,” Tony muttered, lifting a hand to rub at his face, “Yes! Yes, I did! And you know what? It was fucking easy. It was like opening a jar! And if you’re not Patrick fucking Star, then it’s a simple fucking gesture. Therefore, I maintain, that it was perfectly valid for me to get in there and take over. Especially since they’d decided imaginary shrapnel had settled near your spinal cord.”
“I’ve always found managing my time rather easy.” Tony smoothed a hand over his knee, pressing out a wrinkle. “I even account for interruptions, so politics could just be another note to add to the harmony, or more like… It’s like a metronome; you just have to learn how to play to the steady, inexorable beat.”
Steve reaches behind himself and takes hold of Tony's cock. He strokes Tony once, twice, more as he gathers the flow of precum before rolling a condom down over him. He spreads the fluid along Tony’s head and shaft then, letting Tony's hips roll into the motion.
Tony let his press smile slide across his face for all that it hurt him physically. “You should’ve left me on the side of the road, Rogers.”
Tony tilted his head and couldn’t stop the smile that started to stretch his mouth. The threat of it bit into his cheek and crinkled his eyes.
Steve freezes, expression abject horror, and Tony turns back around to watch Natasha's body slump to the floor. They both watch Bucky step back once, then once more.
Tony turned to look at Fury, leaning back against the windowsill before saying, “What do you want, Nick?”
“Tony, we have to bring this guy down. Who knows what else he did to us.” Steve rubbed his hands over his face, feeling a weighted frustration bearing down on his shoulders.
“You’ve been doing so well,” Ty continued, fingers mapping Tony’s skin under his shirt. “I’ve been so proud of you. And then you started fucking the teacher, blasting it all over the papers. He’s not really your type, is he? Were you trying to get over me? Did you go Ken-doll to get back at me?”
Tony hesitated then stepped in closer and pressed the button again to say: “It’s me; may I come up?”
“You never cease to amaze me.” Tony laughed softly and checked the watch on his wrist. He was about to continue speaking when another voice announced the shadow that fell over Tony’s left shoulder.
Steve watched Tony convulsively swallow, could feel his body tensing up in approaching orgasm, and he grit his own teeth in response. He rolled his shoulders then leaned back to wrench one of the table’s bars free of the planking. It came free with a cracking splint, and Tony’s freed leg slammed into Steve’s side. It would have winded a lesser man, but Steve pushed past it to free Tony’s other leg.
“That’s what you’re upset about?” Steve scoffed and actually paced away from the bed before stalking back with a finger pointed at Tony. “You dropped a goddamn warehouse on me and you’re upset because I tried to get at least a good fuck out of it?”
“I’d like to say no, Tony, but every time you open your mouth, I just want to shut you up. You don’t know when to stop, do you? This… act that you’re playing, like you’re the victim in this. You’ve killed innocent people. You’ve-”
“Don’t do this, Tony. If you didn’t have a part of you that’d want to cooperate, then why did you even call me? Why me?”
"Safe?" Tony chokes on the word in stunned disbelief. He still can’t turn around, staring at the shine on the rim of the shield. It’s still wet. Tony imagines it’s still warm.
It didn’t matter; she was already charging forward. It was perfectly fine for the cadets to pick on her, take out their fear and hate on her; she could handle it. But she refused to standby and watch them treat someone else that way. She couldn’t. Maybe it was from a deep-seeded desire for someone to stand up for her that pushed her forward.
He watches and listens, knows that Tony’s melody is telling a story. A story that he can’t tell any other way. It makes something ache fiercely in Steve’s chest. As the music swells and Tony’s jaw clenches, visible to Steve even at his distance, the moment suddenly feels too intimate, too personal for Steve to be bearing witness to.
“Oo, I like that last one. Let’s use ‘puffed up’ for today.” Tony sighed, and pushed both hands up under his glasses to rub his eyes. “Alright, fine. Let Victor know I’m on my way.”
Steve’s heart thumped once at the expression that washed over Tony’s face. It was fury and pain, and then it was a mask. A perfect shift that hid him from everyone who didn’t know any better. Steve knew better, and he hated that facade.
Margaret Carter, Tony thinks, the attractive brunette with the killer red lipstick and heart of a good woman. She's like Tony's mother, soft spoken, but firm, and perfectly perfect just like Steve.
Behind him, the fight continued, the dull thud of fists and grunts echoing around them. He didn’t dare lose focus to look over his shoulder to check, but he was pretty sure his savior had the upper hand, and he was pretty sure he recognized the yellow-trimmed costume. The arrows definitely helped.
“Stop! I don’t care!” Tony snapped, gaze flashing angrily up to Pepper. “None of it matters, don’t you get it? He broke my goddamn heart, so what?! I’m more fucking pissed that he stole my goddamn song. I don’t give a good fuck about my heart.”
Pepper stopped on the other side of the coffee table, hands on her hips as she regarded Tony. He could just make out her expression out of top of his peripheral vision, but since it was an unhappy expression, he chose to ignore.
“It just so happens that I think the current conductor can’t handle the score and has outgrown his position.”
Steve doesn't seem to mind in the slightest, dragging his tongue down the trail of Tony's hair leading to his groin.
Rogers shrugged, no blush coming to his face this time. “I never really got the chance; sick too much, you see, but Bucky did. He used to ride around outside my window when I was stuck in bed. Drove me up the damn wall.”
Tony wanted to close his eyes, to picture anything but the man in front of him in his final seconds, but he would never, never give Pierce the satisfaction.
“Hey,” Steve says sharply and he shakes Tony a little. Tony blinks up at him, eyes wide and wet, and Steve brushes his thumbs under Tony’s eyes to gather the moisture and sweep it away. “You are
He squeezed his eyes shut, knocked his forehead against the floor once, then again, then steadied himself. Everything hurt, as it was wont to do during the flu, and he didn’t have the energy to get into his bed, let alone push away memories of the past. Not after the effort he’d exerted to get to the trashcan in the first place. He turned his face towards the television on the wall, peering blearily at the images of the oil tanker exploding. The supertanker that had been scrapped in 2010 shouldn’t have even been in any condition to be in the water, let alone explosion-worthy.
“Probably,” agreed Fury blandly, “but it’s the only option you’ve got left. You say you can’t be in a cell or Pierce --the East Coast Director, mind you-- will have you killed because you know the ‘truth’. Oh, and he apparently killed your parents.”
Tony glances up at him with an emotion in his eyes that the asset can’t decipher. It’s gone after a brief moment, and he does recognize that it was a slip.
“Yes or no, Stark?” Fury asked, dipping a mozzarella stick in his marinara sauce, “I can only help you if you help me.”
He was cut off as Steve swooped in to grip him by the bicep, unintentionally shaking him and spilling the coffee between them.
Stephanie searched Natasha’s face and wet her lips nervously before forcing the words out. “You...You’re very beautiful too.”
“Hey, it’s okay,” Steve said, much more softly then. “It’s okay. The doctor said it’s going to heal without problems. And maybe only minor therapy. You’ll still be able to play.”
Tony blinked, saying with a frown: “Of course I do,” because that was true. Tony trusted Steve. It was Iron Man not trusting Captain America that was the main problem. It was Tony not trusting Captain America.
Steve woke up slowly, a low hum coming from his phone on the nightstand. He flopped a hand around to grab it and pressed the message open.
"It's okay,” Tony says, because it is. He hasn't told Steve who he is yet, or confirmed if Steve already knows. Who is he to judge? They're young and in lust, maybe love. They get drunk a lot, get matching tattoos; two streaks of twisting colors, red and blue, passion and clarity. Steve's goes on his bicep, and Tony's goes on his left hand in the curve of his thumb and forefinger.
“It’s not an act, Tony,” Fury replied, “In fact, I don’t know what’s going on inside that man’s head right now. That’s between you and him. All I care about is you.”
“Would you mind terribly,” Steve begins, searching Tony’s face. They’re on level simply from Tony being on the stool. “If I took you to dinner?”
Tony stop. If he wanted to, but he knew then that he didn't. He craved the end of this, this overwhelming sense of completion that only Tony could give him.
“Dinner?” It finally registered that Rogers had said he’d missed lunch. Without asking, Jarvis supplied the time in his ear; past dinner time. He leaned back against the turbine and eyed Rogers. “No ulterior motive, huh? Just doing your duty as a concerned citizen to feed me? What about the other bay workers in here? Jerry over there hasn’t eaten either.”
Tony walks further into the room and shrugs out of his blazer, handing it off to Steve before leaning over a side table to look at some sketches.
He pushed to his feet and walked over to his suit. His name was on the tip of Steve’s tongue again, but he couldn’t bring himself to open his mouth.
“It’s… It’s not only about the weapons, Nick,” Tony said, tapping a finger on the table in a slow pattern. “They’re taking the activists, the people… He’s selling them off or killing them when they get too loud or too close. I’m doing my best, but.”
,” Steve panted against Tony’s mouth. Tony’s nerve-endings sparked and fired, sending him into a dizzying orgasm that left him gasping and clenching around the last few strokes Steve made.
The next night, Tony slipped into Amara’s with a hat and sunglasses on. He felt like a complete douchebag, but to be fair, he always did when he had to wear sunglasses at night, because that old song always,
“And how long would Beta have stayed up if Captain Shipperke hadn’t heard the turbine?” Tony asked, bracing himself a little as he pushed off the turbine to slide down between its slating.
Steve doesn’t say anything when he comes into the lab. Tony spies him briefly out of the corner of his eye before the innards of the redesigned Mark VI begin to spark. With the music playing throughout Tony’s space, he soon loses himself back in his work, forgetting Steve’s presence.
It has all been in vain. One by one, he has watched his teammates, his friends, die under Bucky's hands. No, not really Bucky. Steve struggles to remember that. He stares as Natasha is carried out of the room, out of sight. He manages to catch sight of Bucky one last time, and the blank expression shakes Steve further to his core, as it always does.
Rogers didn’t say anything back at first, but then, he stepped forward again. This time, there was no mistaking the intent, leaving Tony with the decision too soon.
Pepper makes a low noise of approval, and Jarvis does as he's told, as his creator wants...as he wants.
“You’re right. But it’s not the first time I’ve had a client react,” Steve replies easily. Tony peeks from between his fingers as Steve stands to measure his waist.
Not when Rogers’ blue eyes caused a phantom sensation of fingers in his hair and reminded him of brightly-colored Fruity Pebbles. The strange thing was, just as he went to open his mouth or step back or
“Steve,” Tony repeated, and it sounded a little wet and worried. He shook himself and stepped forward to guide Steve into his seat. “Why don’t you go? Are you even sure this is healing? What do you need me to do?”
In hindsight, Tony should’ve have seen it coming. Nothing ever good happened around Christmas. To be fair, though, he’d just been a kid, plagued with nightmares.
“Stop! That’s not- Could you be serious for one minute?” Steve’s face was bright red, but he was clearly composing himself rather quickly with a hand through his hair.
"Tony, please." The entreaty is strained, desperate. The man behind it is bound and useless, hanging from the adamantium shackles like a particularly gruesome pinata. Blood drips down to join the puddle on the floor. The drug in his veins weighs him down too heavily to burn out quickly. "Not her. Not like this."
“Not everything’s gotta be fancy, Stark,” Fury said, shelling a few peanuts then popping them into his mouth one by one, “Sometimes you gotta remember where the people are. Right here. At the bottom of all our fancy towers and high-tech buildings.”
It was the cast that caused his wounded noise, but Steve was swift to carefully cover it with his hand.
Tony dropped his head as the pick stilled against the strings. His fingers spasmed along the neck of the guitar. “I don’t care what the press says. I don’t care what they think. I don’t-”
“I’m glad you thought about it,” Tony says sincerely. “I want to try all sorts of things with you, Steve. And I want you to feel comfortable to tell me about what you want to try or not. We’re in this together.”
He tastes it in the back of his throat. Sharp and metallic, it lines the edge of the shield leaning ominously beneath the curtains.
“Naw,” Steve drawled, backing away until he turned around to head for the elevator, “I get Siri to read them out loud.”
“Oh, darling. My good boy,” Tony groans, stroking Steve tighter.  The sound slips in again. “I’m not stopping you.”
“I was specifically told to listen to what Iron Man wanted. Deadpool was very firm in that before he got distracted.”
The post cards don't come with any other identifying markings. Just Tony's name and address and, honestly, he's surprised they get to him. He's surprised that anyone going through his mail wouldn't immediately throw them away.
Like a beast summoned at the mere thought, a low buzz heralded a wave of stimulation that sent the muscles in his thighs and stomach jerking. The sensation rippled out to the rest of his limbs, but his restraints kept him locked in place, unable to shake out the jitters. It left him with no way to ease the tension except to give a low, growling whine that stayed trapped behind the gag clenched between his teeth.
“Aww, thanks, buddy. How much time do we have?” In the distance, Tony could make out the ATC tower taking shape. He set his jaw and kicked his repulsors faster.
Steve laughs, teeth bright and expression still wholesome and clean cut even with their lustful activity. "And I want to be buried inside this ass, baby, I really do, but I don't have the patience to open you up right now."
“Missy!” He called again, stumbling out of his chair and towards the counter. His throat burned. “Mis-” He doubled over and vomited. His stomach was screaming, throat on fire, body shaking. Why wasn't Melissa coming to help? He slumped to the floor, vomiting again, the murky colors of his cereal mixing with the bright red of his blood. His vision blurred, the image of his fingers slipping in the mess seared into his brain.
“Just as you said, Doctor. He looks to be a worthy fighter. Come, let me see those bindings. I fear my brother’s been up to his old tricks.”
“Doctor Doom was alerted sixty-four minutes ago. He has since initiated airspace lockdown and has sent exactly three messages in the order of merely informing you of the incident, requesting your presence, and, finally, demanding your presence no later than your first opportunity. As you were with Captain Rogers in SHIELD, the messages were banked.”
“Tony, why?” Steve had to cover his mouth with his hand, hiding the twitching grin as he watched Tony wring his hands absently. His boyfriend looked down, gestured silently then looked hopefully back up to Steve.
Tony doesn’t remember passing out, but it was the sound of tables scraping out of the way, a cool hand on his forehead, and the roaring agony that ripped through his arm that brought him back to consciousness.
“No!” Tony nearly shouted. “No, it’s okay. You can walk me.” Then he pressed his face to his hands and laughed. “It’s too far to walk. Okay, I’m apparently really bad at this.”
Tony grunted through the strain, knowing that his actions were in vain when Jarvis began to tick down the final seconds. As one, he and the projectiles turned, and he slammed his palms together. The suit clanked loudly.
Tony pushed a hand through his hair, feeling suddenly very old and very worn out. The broken nose was throbbing and his bruised eyes felt puffy. He was sure he was a sight, but he’d deliberately not made eye contact with himself in the mirror. He’d stopped doing that years ago.
“Boys will be boys, right?” And that was Obie, and it was Tony’s worst nightmare, “He can’t help it that all the young girls want to get to know him. Look at that face! Even Stone wouldn’t resist that innocent face.”
"Hey, Pep," Tony speaks up, and Jarvis listens to the soft hum Pepper gives in acknowledgement. For a fleeting moment, he thinks of shutting down and blaming it on Doctor Reed. Tony's eyes are still on Jarvis' scrolling databanks, and Jarvis feels horrendously exposed. He suspects that this is what naked feels likes. "Put your hand back on its shoulder."
“You know,” Stephanie said as she let Natasha lead her towards the armory. “My name isn’t actually Titanborn. It’s Ro-”
What wasn’t expected was who was there to greet him. Tony didn’t stop in his tracks or slow down in surprise, but he did narrow his eyes behind his sunglasses.
“It’s clear from the data reports your AI sent of your little jaunt today that Pierce is on to you,” Victor commented, casual and unaffected. He stood at the fireplace, still in most of a suit; the jacket was gone and the vest was opened to court his sides, but the tie was still knotted perfectly and his sleeves were still buttoned at the wrists. The drink in his hand had ice still, but clearly smaller pieces, so he must have been nursing it.
“Get messy, you mean,” Tony replied, stepping out of the ruins of what used to be the southside of a Staples store.
"I'll miss you, Tony," Steve  murmurs, and Tony dares to briefly touch Steve's shoulder. Then, the door is shutting between them, and Tony is taking the stairs down out of the apartment because he doesn't have the focus to dam the well of emotion before Steve's betrayal sinks into his bones and leaves him crying in the stairwell.
“Missy?” Tony called out, unsure. His cereal no longer tasted right, not like the artificial sweeteners his palate enjoyed, but bitter and concentrated. His stomach clenched again. He struggled to push back from the table as his skin became damp.
“You’re both hot,” Ronin said almost fondly, “but seriously. Get Castle, and let’s get this show on the road.”
He couldn't miss the flash of surprise, then realization, then resignation. The phantom weight of a ring disappeared from Steve's hand as Tony rubbed his hand along his pants, and how did he even get out of his room?
They both have sweat slick along their skin. It’s starting to soak their shirts, and Tony enjoys looking at them occasionally. Their bare thighs are tensed, trembling against their seats. Their briefs leave nothing to the imagination with how hard their cocks are straining. Tony knows how close his lovers are to being tipped over the edge. But the cock rings he’d clicked into place on them keeps them from spilling without added stimulation.
Pepper gives Tony an odd look, but does so, and something clicks into place behind Tony's gaze. Jarvis has been found out. His creator is too smart and, after all, Jarvis doesn't fall far from the tree in regards to personality. His parameters are to care for those that Tony does, to provide and protect.
They were nightmares that left him screaming for his parents, that had Maria kissing his brow and murmuring softly, had Howard rolling his eyes and sneering from behind a tumbler of amber liquid.
Tony rolled his head to the side to look at Iron Man. When others could only see the colors of the material and the shape of the suit, he saw the millions of little equations and schematics that went into it, all of the tiny wires and pin-sized pieces. He saw safety and power.
“Of course as I’m sure the whole world knows, when Ma lost my brother, Da never recovered. He drank more, lost his job, gave up trying to find another. He died when I was six, and I’ll never forget the way Ma cried, like he was something worth mourning. ‘Tragedy changes a man’, she said to me as we walked up the grass aisle to his casket.”
“File it,” Tony grunted as he was pile-driven into the ground. He latched onto the Doombot, kept hold of him atop the other struggling metal bodies. “Now, Jay!”
Steve is distracted by his own mutterings concerning the investments his company had wanted to make with a particular piece of art, but he’s not so distracted that he doesn’t notice the lump of a man struggling in the gutter just ahead. He pauses and contemplates the situation as the man tries and fails to get back on his feet.
He's almost frantic with how fast he's throwing them all in and his breathing is stuttered, panicked.
"How did the military manage to churn you out so 'boy-next-door', Captain Rogers?" Tony asked, drawing his hand back to pull his phone from his pocket when it chimed.
“Okay,” Steve agrees, and it’s heavy and throaty and Tony can see the heavy bob of Steve’s cock beginning to fill in anticipation. That’s good. They’ll need that. And as much as Tony wants to linger and stroke Steve’s cock now, he knows he can’t yet.
“Start talking,” Tony said through his teeth. He sat down with a clunk, using the sweat rolling down his forehead to slick his hair back for the hundredth time since he’d begun working. Then, he used his discarded shirt to wipe at his brow.
Tony will swear that whine of the motor in the butt plug is loud in the quiet cafe on level five, and he grips the edge of the table as his foot jerks out to kick the wide base of the table.
“They take their hands, Tony,” Howard murmured, thumb stroking over Tony’s wrist. “That’s their penalty for stealing. You steal, you get caught, you pay the price.”
Stephanie was frozen in surprise as she watched curl after dark curl tumble down the elf’s back. The soldier groaned sickly and fell to his knees.
He shifts on the bed so he can kneel slightly over Steve and takes his cock in hand again. Holding it steady, he teases the slightly curved, smooth end of the rod against Steve’s tip. Steve’s body is locked down tight. Tony can feel the tenseness radiating from Steve’s thighs.
“Of course, sir. I have drawn up the usual flight plan. There are three routes to be avoided this afternoon, and their detours have now been programmed into the Variant. The package has been cordoned off as per proper protocol and is ready for pickup at Terminal B, Gate 49.”
“There’s no need for such dramatics, Iron Man,” a smooth voice said through Iron Man’s speakers, or maybe it was just in Tony’s head. God, he hated magic, “What he is isn’t important. He’s another stepping stone in your quest for revenge.”
“Don’t you like it?” he wondered, resting a calloused, wide palm on Tony’s thigh. He fanned his fingers out, dug the tips in lightly to cause Tony’s skin to turn white, then scored his nails lightly up along the muscle to Tony’s knee. “So open and exposed for me. You’re not hiding anything like this, Tony. Not from me, not anymore.”
The soldier stepped forward, catching Tony beneath the arms to drag him up from the planks. The chains around Tony’s legs clanked as he was pulled up to the edge of the pier. The cinder blocks scraped against the wood, and Tony’s anger gave way to fear to rattle around his lungs. He panted and began thrashing against the man holding him. There was a loud thump and shouting, and then Tony was let go when Steve barreled into the soldier. Tony landed, rocking on the edge of the pier. He caught his breath and jerked forward away from the water, nearly catching Steve’s elbow in the face as Steve snapped the soldier’s neck.
Tony's hearing statics-out for a moment, tuning back in for the grunting, moaning breaths trapped between their mouths, the damp, slick slap of skin on skin, the near-silent creak of expensive bedsprings.
Unfortunately, it worked like a charm and Steve shoved Tony instinctively away. Tony stumbled from the force of it and was already turning on his heel as the mistake dawned on Steve.
“I lost my phone,” Steve interrupted, “It’s probably at the bottom of the Atlantic.” He dropped his hand from the edge of the door. It dragged a little along the wood, a small detail Tony couldn’t help but notice. He bit his bottom lip and fiddled with the cuff of his sleeve.
Long, dexterous fingers work Tony's clasp and zipper open easily, and Tony files the flecks of paint at his nails away for later if he chooses.
Tony sighed heavily like it was the hardest thing in the world and then pulled himself up to trudge upstairs.
“That was quite a fight for something that only lasted a couple minutes,” the General spoke, tone musing for all it’s orderliness. “How is she?”
The man flails, one fist swinging that Steve easily leans away from. He sighs and tuts again. The man’s blue eyes are bleary and he doesn’t think it’s solely from the head wound. A drunkard, no doubt. Possibly tossed from a nearby establishment.
She gave him a thumbs-up and Steve stretched over to put the empty glass on the drink runner. Tony was talking on stage then, his voice clear to the crowds while the reporter softly spoke over him in Russian.
One building crumbles quickly, trapping Ms. Marvel and several agents--Hydra and SHIELD alike-- under the brownstone. The concrete and broken pieces of Iron Man’s suit act as debris and scatter at bullet speed, some of it disintegrating before it goes too far, but Clint is caught in a shower of it, shielding another agent until they can get to safety.
The bartender placed two drinks in front of Steve, greeting Sam briefly with a smile before walking to the next customer. Steve pushed a drink over to Sam just as the crowd went wild again to Tony’s spread arms and press smile.
Tony draws his lip between his teeth and rubs the steel around Steve’s cock again, slow and steady and helping to spread the lube some more. Steve’s cock is a burning brand against his palm and he slowly, slowly begins to push the sound into Steve’s cock.
And wow. How had Tony been able to notice anything else? He blinks up at him and feels his mouth stretch into a mega-watt smile. “Steve, I presume. Head honcho and tailor extraordinaire?”
And that certainly gets their attention. They instantly hem and haw, and Pepper merely arches a brow.
“Are you saying I’m more fashionable like this than in my over-the-top expensive suits?” Tony feigned indignation.
He stops his gingerly pace and half-turns back to her. She’s full-on glaring at him, hands on her hips and Tony’s reminded of a woman’s fury and proverbs. He’s a little scared.
It’s not their fault. They don’t even realize anything is wrong. He’s just being ridiculous, pathetic. He’s an attention-whore, right? That’s what anyone would say. They’d roll their eyes and tell him to get over it.
The music cut out, and he did scowl then. Damn Jarvis for the traitor he was, and damn Steve for thinking he still had a right to make requests of Tony’s AI.
Steve’s gaze swept over Tony’s wine-red shirt, the gray suit, the sunglasses. He lingered there, on Tony’s face, and Tony knew he was ticking off the slight lines in Tony’s expression. He smiled easily, teeth on display as he squeezed Steve’s hand.
“Ms. Potts?” Steve asks, falling back on titles in the face of uncertainty. Pepper marches up to stand by Tony and she’s in scary boardroom mode. Tony shoves his hands in his pockets and rocks on his heels a little. Bucky stands slowly.
“Freaks should be hidden! Maybe when the General finds out you ain’t got your stuff, you’ll get the lash! If your freak back doesn’t break their whips!” Varo crowed, and the rest of the men laughed.
The meeting had run on and on, and the vibrations hadn’t stopped. Tony was pretty sure his mask had been almost perfect, because not once did Pepper kick him under the table. Though, he would have welcomed the distraction.
Before Tony even saw the Doombots, he heard their attacks. The whine of their hydraulics was only tempered by the proceeding explosions. Across the HUD, calculations began running for possible dead zones contingent on the Doombots’ location. A square formed in the upper right of Tony’s vision.
Pepper laughs. “Tony, promise me you’ll behave. This man is expensive and I like him, so don’t waste his time.”
"I don't care," Tony growled, barely slowing down as he watched the agent with the armor. Steve caught him by the bicep, and his grip jerked Tony back a couple steps.
Tony turned around, dropped into a crouch to cover his ears as his dream self screamed. He wondered if he kept screaming or if it was just the music. Or had it been Ty screaming as a few security guys rushed into the room.
Victor, on the other hand, wasn’t quite as successful in hiding his perturbation at Tony’s manners. “That was quite plebian of you, Anthony, but nothing short of what I’d expect after the… day you’ve had. May we please address the matter of your blood? More specifically, do I need to call for my physician?”
When she set the heavy, double-headed axe in Stephanie’s hand, they held each other’s gaze for a long moment. If Stephanie believed in such girlish, childhood fantasies, she’d believe that the moon uncovered precisely at the moment to shine down on them with promise.
The dream burrowed under Tony's skin and left him reeling. He stumbled off the bed, kicking at the blanket as it tried to trip him up, and slammed his way into the tiny, sparse bathroom.
Tony watched a hummingbird flit about the red-colored feeder hanging outside the largest window, digging further into his bowl. He hummed as he chewed, foot swinging gently. Until it began to slow. He looked down at his cereal, the soggy, distorted colors swirling around his milk. His stomach clenched, and he dropped his spoon into the bowl.
“Yeah, and like a goddamn idiot I waited for proof. Now, countless more are dead and he’s as good as.”
“I know,” Steve said, like he understood what Tony was trying to say. “I know, sweetheart. I never thought differently.” He kissed Tony’ s brow. “You’re coming home with me, and I’m going to take care of you until you’re sick of me.” Until Steve could see Tiberius Stone on the news and not want to destroy everything in his path.
Tony turned his head slightly, eyes blinking slowly to catch bleary sight of Steve where he sat beside Tony’s hospital bed. Other than Steve’s voice, the room was quiet. The television wasn’t on, the machines weren’t beeping. It was peaceful. It was relief.
Tony continued to hit his hands against the wall, the only real motion left to him because of his position. He moaned, a long and unbroken sound of need. The muscles flexed in his hips, under Steve’s hands, and he gripped Tony a little tighter, warning.
Tony wasted no time reengaging his thrusters and taking off for the heavily-armed man gunning down the Bayonne security guards. As one of the bodies tumbled down the stone steps, panels on Iron Man’s thighs opened, firing three miniature missiles from each leg that all locked on Crossbones’ location. He pulled himself in tight and shot down after the missiles.
“Hey now,” Tony started, affronted, though he reached out to ruffle Steve’s hair. “I am helping the community. I paid more than I should’ve for this hunk of metal.”
“Awesome, I’m a step ahead of the others then since I fixed your leg.” Ronin flashed him a thumbs up, beginning to slide Crossbones back towards the overpass. Tony figured Ronin would probably make his getaway with Crossbones’ truck.
“I think your album is going to be great, Tony,” Steve was saying. “It sounds swell. I don’t normally listen to soft rock, but I’m definitely going to put some of your songs into rotation. I’ve need new jogging music.”
“You designed something, didn’t you? Some new… anesthetic that knocked me out? That’s why I can’t remember anything, isn’t it?”
Jarvis can pinpoint it all down to the exact millisecond. Pepper's hand slides down over the silver shoulder plate as she takes her heels off, using him for balance. Jarvis thinks 'him', and he buries a string of code that wishes he could feel the slide of her fingers.
"You should have gone back to sleep, baby," Steve murmurs, brushing his nose along the edge of Tony’s ear. Tony jolts and tries to pull away then, but Steve’s other arm slides against his waist. "I’ll be the one to protect you from a will to survive and a voice of reason."
Steve hears him just fine, though. He hears the wealth of unsaid words in the depth of his name, ugly and beautiful all at once. His head is strapped down; he can’t turn it to look more clearly at Tony. Paralyzing terror grips at him as he realizes where they are, what’s going to happen.
Idea from the song "Counting Bodies Like Sheep to the Rhythm of the War Drums" by A Perfect Circle which can be viewed here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giaZnIr-faM
“But the world can be a funny place, can’t it? It didn’t take a genius to peg Howard as an asshole. All it took was a familiar expression. Howard used to get this look in his eye…” Steve’s pencil paused, but he turned the notepad he was working in around and resumed. “My dad used to get that same look before my ma ended up with a busted lip.”
“Stay in the bed for at least tonight. Who knows what I did to you,” Tony said dryly, then he patted Iron Man’s shoulder, said ‘Night Guard Protocol, code Alpha-5-30-86-03,’ then went to leave. Iron Man’s eyes lit up as his joints whirred him into position to be on guard near the door.
Tony slides the rod slowly out to another one of Steve’s fracturing moans. He adds another drizzle of lube from quickly drying pool on Steve’s stomach then slides the rod back inside.
“Get my hands!” Tony gasped, craning his neck to try and spy PIerce around Steve. “Where’s my suit?”
“Take it slow,” Steve said without turning around, without enough inflection for Tony to get a read on his mood. He could probably guess, though, and it started with a ‘p’. “You’ve been sedated for four days.”
Tony’s mouth waters. “Steve,” he says, dazed. Steve’s gaze jerks to his and his hips shift forward like he was already looking for friction. Tony settles a careful hand on Steve’s hip bone. “You’ll have to keep still.”
“Wait, hold the- Oh, thank god, I’m so running late and taking the stairs was so out of the question,” a woman is saying and a man, who’d slipped on with her, mumbles a courtesy reply. Tony wonders if he’s as wide-eyed as Pepper. He doesn’t remember the last time they were this close together.
“You’ve had a bit of a rough go of it, haven’t you? Mother died in childbirth. Father was distant. Is that why you’ve run away to war?”
“Shh,” Steve whispered, “You’re so good for me, doing so well,” and he began to press those two fingers in alongside his cock as he gave shallow, teasing thrusts against Tony’s ass. The hooks were rattling, a constant stream of metallic noise, and Tony was a dam of choking, broken moans. His cock twitched and pulsed and reddened, so wet with precome and spit that it shone even in the dim, red light.
“One step closer, and this EMP goes right between your eyes,” Clint warns. The warning is useless as Bucky tackles him out of nowhere. The sound Clint’s head makes against the pavement echoes sickeningly. His struggling is weaker for it, and Tony is mostly forgotten as their fight drags them around the street. Steve can’t find Sam.
Once he cleared the window, he pushed himself up on his hands. That was when the crunch of gravel got his attention as his hearing returned. It was a split second too late as a boot slammed into his side sending him sprawling past the car against the pavement. He gasped out, blood staining his mouth as he struggled to get off the ground.
Steve blinked at the portal and silver-masked man standing before it. His expression went hard, gaze narrowed, and he widened his stance.
Tony’s throat worked as he tried to speak, to move. He felt the sweat of battle and nerves roll down his neck and drip down his spine. Fear… He could taste fear in the back of his throat.
"It was never about Barnes," Tony continues, and he touches Steve's chin, creates a new path for the blood. It trickles down his wrist. "He'll pay for what he became, just as I will before I'm through. But you, Steve..."
“God, you’re a real comfort, Wilson, you know that?” Steve rolled his eyes and slapped down a wad of Russian currency. “Daruĭte, vsya plyashka. Budʹ laska.”
There’s a moment of silence, and Rhodey watches Tony look around the destruction of their fight. Bucky is pushing to his feet over a prone Clint, tossing an arrow to the ground, too far away now to be an immediate concern. Natasha’s yell is audible even without comms. Rhodey’s stomach churns violently, fear quaking down his spine.
He could easily snap them all, so why hadn't he? When he tried to even focus on the answer, it slipped away, just out of his grasp.
Something like relief broke through Tony, and he flung his right hand towards Steve, grasping and tugging until their foreheads were pressed together.
“That’s the problem, isn’t it? He’s a genius; he’s probably light years ahead of us when it comes to how to wipe our asses. I really don’t think he’d miss Fury being suspicious of him, so…” Steve scratched a hand through the light stubble that had grown along his jaw since the start of his current mission.
“Stop!” Steve growled, his gaze fierce behind the cowl. He was straddling Iron Man now, gloved fingers bending in between the shoulder panels to start prying them apart. The left shoulder plate went first, and Steve threw it behind him. The clatter of it along the pavement went pretty much unnoticed as, with the first opening, he found it much easier to get the rest of the armor off. He stayed below Iron Man’s head, peeling the suit open from the shoulders down, piece by piece as he revealed Tony’s body underneath.
“Tony, I understand why you feel like you couldn’t say anything,” Steve murmurs. “And I’m sorry that we made you feel this way, intentionally or not.”
“I don’t use pa-” Rogers cut off at Tony’s raised brows. He cleared his throat and shifted his weight, falling into a parade rest. And wasn’t that adorable? Tony really needed him to stop. “I don’t have an ulterior motive other than you needing to eat, and I haven’t had dinner yet either.”
Other rumors were worse, bad enough to twist Stephanie’s stomach with the things the cadets and other soldiers dared to say. She never saw the Dunmer though, not really. She’d catch dark skin out of the corner of her eye, but the elf would be nowhere to be seen when she turned.
“You think Alexander Pierce is kidnapping civilians?” Steve said with an astonished huff of amusement, “I may not agree with everything he says, especially about you, but he’s clearly doing everything he can to make the people’s lives easier, to help the country run smoother.”
Natasha eyed her like she could hear the words left unspoken. “You are very strong, Titanborn. You don’t let these
“Why don’t you fix it up and give it to the Boys and Girls Center?” Steve suggested. “Then I’ll let you take me out on the water in one of those ridiculous boats.”
“No,” he said faintly, body going hot and cold at the implication that they’d had the same dream, shared the same experience, that Steve would have heard how desperately in lo- “No. No, you’re the one lying this time. It’s not possible without magic!”
Tony let his legs give out, let himself hang from the press, let his weight pull on the bone and muscles caught between the metal. He hung there, knees barely scraping the floor, staring at the linoleum. He hung there, and he learned.
“I’d promise, but we know it’s the nature of the job,” Steve murmured and Tony felt his lips slide against his neck. He dropped his head forward and heard Steve hum in approval. He pressed his hands to the counter and prepared to gently extricate himself from Steve’s embrace.
From there, it's a blur of stripped clothing and exposed skin. Steve's mouth is greedy; he takes great pleasure in applying it to almost every inch of Tony's body after they finally make it onto the bed. Tony is left twisting and panting as his nipples are teased to almost painful sensitivity, and a hickey is sucked into the edge of his navel. His cock throbs against Steve's bare chest, smearing precum across his hot skin as Tony grinds up for friction.
Jarvis has many more memories of them together now. His suit became slimmer, easier to manage around beds and tighter spaces. They experiment and play and love, and Jarvis feels content.
“I don’t know, General Carter,” Stephanie replied, squaring her shoulders. The muscles ached in protest, but she kept herself straight.
“Oh god. Tony, oh.” Steve is slurring and wrecked and the most gorgeous thing Tony has ever seen. “S’good. S’good.”
“Well, I wouldn’t call them full-fledged,” Tony hemmed, “Especially not Dum-E. He’s got that name for a reason, you know. He’s more like… half-fledged, still working on spelling ‘cat’.”
Tony stilled his tongue, and Steve could tell he wanted to close his mouth, hide from the openness of the ring spreading apart his lips. But when he didn’t continue speaking, he saw Tony slowly start to test the bindings he’d been put in. He jerked his arms and flexed his hands around the metal supports attached to the suspension cuffs.
Pepper is also less than amused, cutting Tony glances over and over like she can see into his soul and find out that he was incredibly aroused and quite possibly leaking coveted supersoldier jizz all over his briefs.
Tony makes sure he won’t lose the sound on the floor then ducks down to lick up Steve’s mess, lube and all, before he turns his head to lap at the head of Steve’s cock. It’s red and angry and drooling the last of his orgasm. Tony eagerly sucks it up and Steve’s hands clench now in Tony’s hair.
“Avengers, power down and detain,” Steve orders through his com. There are varying degrees of responses.
“Of course, sir,” Jarvis answered. He went quiet and Tony turned the radio on, choosing soft classical instead of his rock that he normally would. He wasn’t in a loud sort of mood and Tchaikovsky was doing wonders for his stress level.
“Mr. Stark, the man you’re currently treating to almost second base is Bucky Barnes. He runs the numbers and handles the inventory. Do you, um, mind if we let him get back to that?”
“You can pretend all you want that you’re a cold-hearted, selfish, and uncaring bastard, but I can see through you now,” Steve said with a tone that dared Tony to argue with him, “Reckless, I’ll give you that, and maybe a little too reliant on your tech, but there’s not a damn bone in your body that doesn’t care.”
“You don’t think I’ve thought of that, Captain? You’ve seen it now, though, that suit, that tech, and what it can do. You’ve watched the footage, analyzed the data. We could use him!”
“Rebar…” Tony stepped between Steve’s legs to hold Steve’s head to his chest, fingers brushing through his blond hair. “Rusted rebar… Fucking Christ...”
By the time their dinner plates were scraped clean and removed from the table, Tony was gesturing expansively to describe the importance of the tone on his next album. Steve’s chin was on his fist, watching Tony with rapt attention. Dessert went by in a blur of soft laughter and the impending sense of the evening coming to an end.
“Your methods have been crude.” That statement came from the Scarlet Witch, beautiful and cold, where she perched on the end of the sole piece of furniture in the room. The table was only stable because she wanted it to be, and she’d definitely raised the temperature in the warehouse upon her arrival. She gave Tony chills, but Iron Man was rather fond of her in an ‘aww they grow up so fast’ sort of way.
"Of course," he says smoothly, perfection in hiding the bitter acidity in his tone. He secretly hopes the girl is allergic to peanuts. And he almost doesn’t manage to feel guilty about it.
He curled his hands into fists so even he couldn’t see them shake, and eventually, he was able to block it out and go back to work.
His aim was off, shaky like the rest of him, but the gun didn’t fire. Blood was starting to form on the bowstring and it was clear Ronin was going for the garrote, but Crossbones’ entire body shuddered and his head was engulfed in that same energy it had been the day of the Port attack.
Tony sucked his teeth then strode up to the door. A bell -and Tony has to blink up at it for a few seconds- tinkles as he enters the shop.
“Sir, radiation levels have increased, and the airport is beginning to report electrical glitches. I have activated their fire alarms and evacuation has begun.”
“Ah, of course. Stark, you’re even less accessible than our dear Captain,” Pierce said and made no move to shake Tony’s hand. “Why, I haven’t seen you since the Memorial.”
“You take an awful lot of chances for a villain,” Victor remarked, fingers prodding gently at the jagged wound where the debris had punctured the Variant.
This morning, the asset knows that this is the beginning of the end. He can taste it in the air, see it in the slump of Tony’s shoulders before Tony realizes and tries to hide it. They’re both aware of the one they brought in last night. He hands the asset a set of instructions.
Rogers’ expression twitched minutely, mouth kicking up just slightly. “Mr. Stark, it’s been a while. I wasn’t sure I’d get the pleasure of your company again.”
Steve ducks his head just for a moment then lifts it with a smile that makes Tony’s heart skip a beat. His palms start to get clammy in anticipation.
Tony could feel Steve bristling across the table, but he kept his gaze on Pierce, playing the game with graceful aplomb… Which he figured he earned simply by not placing Steve’s dirty knife in Pierce’s trachea.
“Don’t worry about him,” Victor announced from a few feet away, “I’ll take care of Pierce’s body. You should take your boyfriend to the hospital.”
The shield ricocheted back into the Captain’s hand with scary accuracy, and he jumped, twisting to fling the shield again. It hit almost perfectly, shattering the plate just before Tony’s right foot’s repulsor.
When they walk back out into the dining area, everyone is gone, but Steve doesn’t seem surprised. He takes Tony’s hand and leads him out and into the living room where everyone is piled on the floor among pillows and blankets. They all look over when Steve pulls Tony into the room.
Steve only waved over his shoulder and then was gone. Tony stuck his tongue out at the spot he had been then slid into his driver seat. He stared at the steering wheel for a long time before pressing the start button.
“Tony?” a tentative, soft call of his name that has Tony banging his head on the cabinet in his haste to get back on his feet.
Rogers smiled, another small thing. “You’re right about that, too. You should probably get cleaned up. I don’t know many restaurants that’d let you in looking like that.”
Tony’s jaw clenched for a moment, fear throbbing along the still-sore muscles of his body. “Yes, that’s what happened. He’s dead now.”
“Steve, please,” Rogers said, the second time he’d requested it, but he couldn’t know that Tony didn’t want to give in, didn’t want to give it to him on his terms. He didn’t give Tony the chance to agree or disagree, though, stepping out of the elevator to lead Tony to the large turbine that took up more than a good chunk of the working bay.
“Yeah, I am,” Tony said easily. There was a knock on the door, and the intern let them know the car was ready to take them to the after party.
All three men are staring at Tony, but the one in question finally shakes himself out of it and glances at his left arm.
Tony bit hard into his cheek again. It was either his imagination or Fury’s coat swished particularly angrily as he stalked down the hall and around the corner, muttering as he went. He turned back to the Captain, whose expression had gone narrow and thoughtful while Tony hadn’t been looking. It cleared almost instantly, but a second or two too slow.
“Let’s not waste time,” Tony says, and the asset realizes that Tony has broken himself too. His handler is weak, so it’s only fitting that this be the end. Deep down, as the asset reads over his final mission, that awareness inside of him breathes a sigh of relief. He burns the instructions and enters the room.
Steve’s eyes closed and he sighed, but he didn’t let Tony go. When he looked back at Tony, he tilted his head to the side and asked, in all seriousness: “Do you trust me, Tony?”
“Really. I have a very important dinner date on Friday and I need a suit that will drive my date wild,” Tony states, settling his hands on his hips.
Stephanie bit the inside of her cheek, fingers flexing for a moment before she nodded and fell into step beside the elf.
Tony nodded and coughed again, curling up just a little. Ronin turned his head, looking down the length of Tony’s body. He used the end of his bow to prod Tony’s leg. Tony moaned haltingly, trying to draw the leg out of Ronin’s reach.
Like a shadow, someone landed in the flickering light of the fire from Tony’s car. They circled Crossbones and leapt at him with dual blades. They were fast, dodging in and out of Crossbones’ range and finally knocking the shotgun away. It landed on the side of the road, sliding a bit in the wet grass. Tony turned towards it and began to crawl.
Rumiko hasn't been in the ground four months, body still figuratively warm, but Tony is drunk, and the man's inviting smile already feels like those lips are wrapped around Tony's cock.
Tony catches the scent of tequila and lime on the breath that fans across his cheeks, and he wants to snort at the man's choice in beverages, because margaritas, really? But he's only groaning again as the man shoves his other arm between Tony and the wall to drag Tony's ass back against that cock.
He couldn’t scream anymore, his gauntlets screeching as they slid over his helmet and Victor was laughing as he tumbled to the ground; they were all laughing in overlapping waves.
“It’s fine. Put the gun down before I report you to the Captain!” Then, she turned and adjusted a valve on one of the IV bags hanging beside his bed. He wanted to yell, to object. He couldn’t handle drugs and absolutely loathed not having control of his mind, but he couldn’t do anything as they swept him into unconsciousness again to the too-fast beeping of the tachycardia monitor.
Still, and Tony wasn’t surprised by this, Steve opened his door before Tony could even lift his hand to knock. Neither of them greeted the other as Tony took in the sight of Steve in the doorway. His body was stiff, his hand tight on the door near the top of the frame. Pale except for two splotches of red high in his cheeks, he looked tired and in pain. Tony’s gut clenched.
“Do you really think I haven’t played this game before, fellas?” he’d scoffed, sauntering around the end of the bed to
Her mouth twisted, hands fisting at her sides. It wasn’t her fight and, if she threw herself into to help, she’d probably just make things worse. No one in the fight would certainly thank her for it. And the brass would definitely come down hard on her, Carter’s ‘tough love’ meted out with an unyielding hand.
“You got it all wrong, man. I heard he’s just got something that guy wants. No clue what it is, though. A guy like that don’t exactly need money, ya know?”
Steve breathed slowly out of his nose, finding a little comfort in the voices being in the room next to him. If he could get his legs underneath himself, it should give him enough leverage to force his head away from the magnet. His brows drew down in concentration and slowly, with effort, he dragged his legs up until first one knee, then the other was beneath him. The strain on his neck was rough, but he took a few fortifying breaths, braced his knees, and began to shove his shoulders up from the concrete.
He and his new friend Rhodey got a kick out of playing quarters with it. It wasn’t usually much of topic after a while, though. Until one night, two-thirds of the way into a suitcase of beer, Rhodey rolled his head along the side of the bed to look at Tony.
Tony's stomach lurches with a ripple of confusion at first, but his brain quickly snaps back onto the same page as Steve pushes his legs together then shifts forward to straddle him instead.
He needs to get over it. He needs to grab the mixer and go back out there so his friends could drink more and be happier still.
Tony's only able to grind against the man to get more friction, urging the man on as he watches the tip of his dick flush and dampen with beads of precum visible only because of the flickering streetlight to their left.
Tony’s hand was wet from where it shook, the water in the cup spilling over the rim. Neither of them acknowledged it. The words were on the tip of his tongue, but at the same time, they choked him.
That question floated through Steve’s mind, coming out of nowhere like he’d been trying to answer it since the start. He jerked, inhaling sharply, as Tony fisted a gauntlet-covered hand into his hair and
“Tony, what did you do?” He asked slowly, carefully flexing his hands atop the hospital covers. He wanted to shake the answer out of him, get it faster, know it already. He’d never lost time like that with the doctors before. It was… He was feeling a little claustrophobic at the thought.
He tried not to think about how open and exposed it all made him, kneeling in the center of Tony’s lab. Though, he wasn’t entirely sure how he’d gotten there so quickly from the Louvre Museum. The rod was thick and long enough to extend out a foot from either side of Steve and was secured to bolts in the floor via another set of ropes. The restraints bit into his skin, abrading but not bruising.
Because that’s what Steve still believes. He has to. This shell before him can’t truly be the genius and hero, Tony Stark. This can’t be the man Steve had come to… He doesn’t let the word form. He can’t confirm what Tony already knows about him. He just meets that empty gaze with his own, and the words come on their own, dredged up in defense and morbid curiosity.
Steve smiles to himself, the notes picked out fluently and so easy and much more pleasing to his ears. The piano was always a soft spot as his mother had once tried to teach him. He hadn’t picked it up then, but he knows it would be all too easy now.
“What?! God no! Howard would never. As much as he didn’t love me, he loved my mother. And I’m sure he planned to outlive me just so he had one more thing he could shake his head in disappointment at.”
“Ah, you learn quickly. That’s good. You are Stephanie Titanborn. I am Natasha Stark. I don’t allow many to call me Natasha, but I’ve been waiting to meet you for a long time. I think, I shall let you.”
There’s resistance, but Tony is patient and steady and doesn’t try to shove past. Steve throws his head back, but it’s the only movement he allows himself. His mouth parts, a whine easing up from his throat. His flush is darker and Tony is enthralled. The sound slides further inside and Tony can feel it moving through the shaft of Steve’s cock. He stops just before his fingers would hit the head and takes a breath.
The first thing Tony realized was that he could breathe clearly. There didn’t seem to be anything in his throat.
Tony was lost to a dream. He could tell it was a dream; the edges of his vision were fuzzy, and he was pretty sure that was himself on the bed. He recognized his shoes. And he recognized the slope of Ty’s back. The music was loud even then, some club song that was blasting through the party.
Tony Stark learned his first worldly lessons from the inside of a cereal box. First, anything or anyone can be used as a weapon.
The tension from the belt around his throat connecting to the rope pulled at the plug in Steve’s ass. It lit Steve up, pleasure engulfing him as the plug rubbed against his prostate. He cried out around the gag, hoarse and desperate for relief, almost desperate enough to do as Tony asked. Almost.
He searched Tony’s face, looking for something in Tony’s expression. Whether he found it or not, Tony didn’t know, but Victor did step closer, much closer, into Tony’s space. It trapped his hand between them, pressing a piercing pain into Tony’s side where his fingers were still twisted up in Tony’s shirt.
All of it perched, heavily, on Rogers’ shoulders and uplifted hands. He looked like a titan; Atlas, who bore the burden of the celestial spheres in punishment for opposing the new pantheon, a younger generation of gods given reign over Olympus. The analogy didn’t fit, or it would be Tony holding up the sky while Rogers stood before him; Zeus, crowned and triumphant.
It wasn’t until Bucky and Nat were over for dinner that it even occurred to Steve that there could be something between him and Tony. This new, wondrous friendship he had with the genius was not something easily described and couldn’t be notched perfectly in a slot.
“Exposing Pierce as Hydra and that it’s at the helm of the East Coast? That’ll change everything, Tony. It’ll change across the country, not just here, not just the East Coast. I’m prepared for that, but are you? Truly?”
“I don’t play for the war aspect of it,” replied Steve after clearing his throat, “I do it because everyone else playing is an asshole, so I don’t feel bad kicking their asses. Also, I really like the zombie mode.”
“Heh, that’s what Rhodey said to me back at MIT,” Tony says, deflecting his nervousness with the joke. Steve’s smile curves a bit more and Tony climbs onto the bed. He busies himself with setting the lube down near the pillows and the case by his thigh where he settles in beside Steve’s hip. He’s careful not to touch too many things as he unzips the case.
“What do they do?” Tony asked instead of acknowledging Steve’s last statement. Anger surged through his veins as he anticipated Steve’s answer. “The doctors, what do they do?”
Steve’s head whips against the pillow and his expression screws up, but Tony sees the gathering wetness, the tears falling in the crease of Steve’s eyes, slipping back into his hair. But he hasn’t said to stop yet, so Tony keeps going. Even when Steve’s voice leaves him on a sob.
Tony hefted the radio above his head to throw it at the wall, but a pair of strong hands slid over his shoulders and up to cup his own hands.
It was all carefully piled onto one large tray held in Rogers’ steady hands. He looked sheepish, but determined, as he stepped into the ring of the turbine and cleared his throat to get Tony’s attention.
Steve flinched, and that was something Tony would play over later, puzzled and defeated. He grabbed at the collar of the armor and dragged Tony forward.
It just so happens that SHIELD and its affiliates will no longer have access to it. So go ahead, Nick, blackmail me all you want. Splash my name across the papers, but have fun crawling to Hammer to resupply everything SHIELD touches.”
