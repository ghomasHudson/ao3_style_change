Cas’ grip tightens again, reassuring. “We’ll figure things out.”
Dean snorts to himself, smiling. Gotta give the guy credit; Castiel sure takes his potential layoff in stride.
“Thank you, Dean,” Castiel said, a low rumble that ricocheted its way down Dean’s spine.
Mary’s grin turns mischievous. “Just look for Baby. You’ll know where he is.”
Behind him, Cas snuffles and sighs, seemingly satisfied by burying himself deeper into the warmth Dean left on his half of the bed.
Maybe the reminder of Cas did that. Dean tells himself that’s the reason why.
Dean’s not sure how to read the energy, but it doesn’t feel like Libby and the other kids are being held against their will. He leans on that hunch, adding, “Unless you don’t want to see her, for some reason? We just wanna talk, kid.”
—there must be a house, and if it’s burning down then there’s smoke, and it could lead us—”
“Maybe,” Eileen says. “Though you should check with my resident about that. I probably ask her more questions than your new guy.” She scrutinizes the screen as Dean chuckles, her expression growing tight. “Dean, are you okay? You look a little pale.”
Castiel sighs, his feathers bristling. “As you command.”
“Oh, Dean.” Bart claps him on the back, laughing. “Hate to say it, but I miss being on the same team as you. I sure slept better, knowing I had a hand on the ball for legacy. Who’s going to keep it from going out of bounds now?”
Castiel chooses to believe him too.
Castiel would be leaving him—them. How was Dean supposed to respond to a thing like that? Especially when Cas doesn’t want anything from him—doesn’t even want to be
Amara is what saves them, in a way.
Raph extends a benevolent hand, so Castiel stands with his portfolio, and begins reciting his report.
Dean lingers after five, wordlessly wishing for something—but he leaves once he notices that Castiel’s office is dark, emptied out sometime while Dean wasn’t looking. So he drives home in the rain, calls up Sam as soon as he gets home, to break the news about Inias.
Nat, who knows more than she should, knows enough to say nothing. The fact the taller brother isn’t with him, and the two rugrats inside are biding time keeping him away from something, paints a picture as to what’s coming in his future pretty darn quick.
“What the fuck?” Dean asks.
“Yeah, well, here we are,” Dean grumbles, turning toward the door. “Just include me next time. Things like this really upset the balance of the team.”
Sam locks eyes with Dean, exchanging another shorthand, bewildered look. The whole night has been a waking nightmare, and nothing continues to make sense. “And that’s … bad, right?”
“If I can,” Cas tells the wall.
“What are you making?” Cas asked, rough-voiced and bleary-eyed. “I don’t have a lot of fresh food.”
Castiel’s nerves settle; he matches her grin. “Thank you, Mary.”
Behind them, down halls and in the library, the bunker echoes with conversation and movement, laughter and life filling the world at the corner of Dean’s eyes. Voices he might’ve heard once, before blood had been shed by an archangel’s hand. Curtains are closed against all of them, leaving them a warm but bitter memory.
“Have you eaten?” Castiel asks. “There’s soup in the—”
“Legacy,” Raphael begins, turning to Zach’s side of the conference table, “can you provide us with a breakdown regarding your product updates this month?”
“There has to be some sort of spell that could cause this,” Patience mutters, switching her internet searches onto the deep web. Claire sprawls out on the motel bed beside her, tapping away at her phone, researching as well.
“Hey now, don’t get too hasty,” Dean tells her. “Could be a good way to get paid time off.”
“Holy shit,” Dean says.
Castiel shakes his head, a sharp glance twisted over his shoulder. A quick look confirms that Michael is there behind them, lingering at the cusp of the boardroom, eyes on Castiel. Dean shuts his mouth and follows suit.
Cas’ phone blips. He pulls it from his pocket and cycles through its screens.
Dean smiles without thinking, his heart thudding when he sees Cas give a wry grin in return. Sam must get the memo, because he keeps his mouth shut and his looks between them subtle. Still, Dean’s feeling charitable despite the radio silence. He knocks the lid off the cooler between him and Sam, leaving the implication open for Cas.
Finally the route clears, and Dean finds himself completely turned around, moving toward the north end of the city. He signals onto the frontage road where the spade-shaped sign of the Midwest Vegas Motel proudly advertises its rates on a neon banner. Dean swings around the side of the motel and pulls into the far end of the parking lot. The asphalt is uneven, broken down to gravel. An overgrown strip of grass separates the motel from the Biggerson’s a stone’s throw away.
“C’mon, it’s not that bad. Just a cold.” Dean coughs noisily on command. “See? Inias probably exaggerated.”
After a week spent working under the new BEAU setup, Dean isn’t sure it’s all he hoped it would be.
Outside, he shovels his change back into his wallet, his attention momentarily caught by the squealing kids biking past, rainbow slushies dripping condensation on their handlebars. Claire must've climbed out while the car was refueling, fetched the squeegee, and started scrubbing bug guts off the windshield, but she subsequently answered a phone call part way through, leaving the driver’s side conspicuously dirty.
“Alright.” Dean hooks an arm through Castiel’s and tugs him closer, stuck fast to his side amid the crowd moving around them.
It takes all of fifteen minutes to accomplish, but their schedules have the scrum booked for an entire hour. Dean lets them use the remaining time however they want, easing into their work day by lingering in his office, carrying out an extended chat about their weekends.
“Sounds good, princess.” Dean reversed the Impala and angled his way through a k-turn, edging them back up the dirt road toward the highway.
Dean glances awkwardly over himself. Maybe it was a mistake to come into work already wearing what he’d be dressed in on a weekend. The only consolation he has is that Miriam and Castiel are in the same boat.
“Uh,” Donnie says, misfiring. Deliveries aren’t scheduled on Thursdays. “Excuse me?”
With the plan settled, they pair off in the afternoon to drive out to the farmstead. By Dean’s own machinations he ends up with Cas, the two of them alone in the Impala.
But rather than seem pleased, Castiel’s mouth tightens, becoming brittle. “I see,” he says, the smile he forcibly held ratcheting coolly into place. “Happy birthday, Jack.”
Cas sighs. Papers rustle on his end. “There are no known deaths at the retreat, no haunted grounds. If something is making guests go missing, we haven’t uncovered it yet.”
Dean shuts the lid, feeling queasy. Why would the guy be doing something like that for Dean, especially when they don’t get along?
—to where Dean has been glancing compulsively, just hoping Cas might return. Look to confirm that yes, Cas is gone, and no, Dean will never see him again.
“Fuck,” he growls aloud, to the emptiness of his office.
Dean squints a frown over his shoulder. It doesn’t take much coaxing to get him to lie down again.
exclude someone for the manner in which they were created. Every human is worthy of dignity.”
Ricky claps. “Good man. We’re back in business, m’friend.”
“Yes, it’s possible,” Rowena says carefully, “but to find a source strong enough to cast a spell this powerful
Dean turns back to his inbox and accepts the meeting invitation, leaving the response box empty in his reply.
He frowns down at her, lifting the bag. “What’s this for?”
Cas does little more than offer Garth a chilling glare. He nudges between them and gathers Dean’s arm, pulling him astray from the path back to his cabin. Garth calls after them, “Bring him back before curfew, you homewrecker!” but Cas seems not to care.
Dean chalks it up to the shaky circumstances under which Cas let go of his grace, compounded by the imperfect vial they found for keeping it safe. Cas is human now—disheveled and sweating and accepting painkillers only begrudgingly, scratching away at his borrowed henley and softly snoring in his sleep. No wonder he’d be miserable, adapting to humanity with the lot of them, at the mercy of their sorry life lessons.
For Cas.
Jack takes the front step two at a time, followed closely by his neniven.
Dean nods and sets a course for home, winding them down streets made hazy by the falling snow. The road ahead is muzzy but shining, its pathway warm and bright.
“Have a good one, Doug,” Ricky shouts as he’s leaving, earning a puzzled look from the agent, followed by a tight wave from his free hand.
It scares Dean now, though he knows better. His heart pounds as he comes up beside Cas. “Hey.” He thumps his knuckles into Cas’ chest. “Just because you’re dead to me doesn’t mean you get to die for good.”
Dean hummed, untucking his face from Cas’ pillow. He dug his knees harder into the mattress, bowing his back as he pressed his upper body down. All the better to present himself for his alpha.
“You do you,” Dean replies, his gaze kept away. He shoves the last of his fries into his mouth and wipes his hands against his jeans, shuffling himself out from the booth. “S’cuse me, need to use the little girl’s room.”
Dean stares ahead, his gears grinding. “You had to call to ask if you can send a text?”
“Dean?” Sam lifts his brow, calling his name out like a question. “You coming?”
“Not yet.” The corner of Dean’s mouth curls upward. “But I’m gonna drive out to the coast, see Sam and Eileen for a bit. Been years since we…” He clears his throat. “Anyways. Guess I miss hanging out with the little pain in the ass.”
The short-haired brother looks up from where he’d been leaning against the pump, nodding his recognition. He’s wearing a canvas jacket and work boots, no blood on his jeans today.
The air is gentle and warm, the forest around him alive with dappled sunlight peering through the branches. His head aches, and as he rubs idly at his arms, he finds them overly hot and clammy.
“Yeah,” Dean said, a soft smile forming. “Guess we’ll have to try again.”
“Oh. Well, first of all, the resort has strict definitions on who it considers non-human. Apparently there have been issues of inclusion around psychics and witches, specifically.”
The drive back is tense, whiteknuckled through the torrential downpour of the storm. The radio is turned low, so Dean can better concentrate. Castiel’s head is throbbing with the influx of memories he’s found again.
Castiel passes over his section of pie, their fingertips brushing. Dean can’t help how his pulse rises in response.
Castiel watched Dean’s expression, noting the way he absently licked his lips. It was a moment before Dean caught him staring.
“I do,” Castiel insists. He steps forward, up to the foot of Dean’s bed. “Whatever is happening, we can find a way through it. Together.”
. Except he’s not allowed to call her that.
Dean groaned in response, so close to Castiel that he had already clambered partway into Castiel’s lap, only the annoyance of the steering column keeping them apart.
“No. Actually…” As casually as he can muster, Dean mumbles, “I’m at Cas’ right now.”
(See the end of the chapter for
, plastic rattling loudly across the hardwood floor. Jack jumps back from its path, sneakers squeaking in his haste. It scrapes to a stop half a room away.
“Shut up,” he murmurs to Cas, who is laughing, closed-mouth, around his mouthful of chips.
Softening, Hank mulls the best scrap to give him, the bone with just enough gristle on it that Kurt will stop for a while to chew it over. Hank says calmly, thinking of one night in particular, “Those boys do the kind of work that allows the rest of us to sleep soundly. Now if you don’t know what exactly that means, you ought to consider yourself lucky and leave it at that. Alright?”
“Right, because you can just reschedule your health crises for later,” Eileen says, sarcastic.
Something heavy settles in Dean’s stomach, thrumming like ice in his veins. Could he act like this, if it were Sam in Cas’s shoes? If it were Adam, sitting across from Dean, having caught—having
First day and the guy isn’t even feigning an attempt at social niceties. Dean harrumphs to himself; if Castiel knew even half of what was needed in a good system analyst, he’d be out here asking questions of the team instead of relying on the results of Raph’s misguided questionnaire.
The snippet from Dean is even more troubling:
Dean’s pissed Castiel off again, he must have, but as he watches Castiel struggle, Dean realizes the fight’s coming over something clearly uneasy for Castiel to say.
Cas glances at Dean, nodding his resolve. He takes a deep breath and begins his march toward the house.
“Yes, I’ve reviewed your other additions,” Cas said nonchallantly, and suddenly Dean was thinking back to the night he scrolled through the site’s companion preferences list, lonely and checking off all the sex positions he imagined maybe someday experiencing with Cas.
Castiel nods, and follows readily after that.
Adam looks around the bedroom—not at any of its contents, but as if he is surveying the distant corners of the bunker, searching for something that isn’t there. Hell, maybe Michael lets him use his x-ray vision even when he’s not in charge. Maybe he lets Adam use his wings, or even—
“Yeah,” Dean says, when the silence hangs. “And?”
Battery at half capacity. Couldn’t have been days yet.
“Cas?” Raphael says, standing by the next cubicle he’s assuredly here to visit.
At supper that night, the mess hall is filled with circular tables sitting three couples apiece, elegant stemware and fine gold cutlery delineating each seat. Dean doesn’t bother hunting out his spot on the seating chart, opting instead to pull up a chair beside Cas at his and Sam’s table. The couple they’re with is a new one, a vampire named Nathaniel and his boyfriend, Steve, who have just completed the mandatory five-stupid-things-to-recite with Sam and Cas and are settling in to more casual topics of conversation.
Sam fires back, something like,
Ryan shrugs, the compliment warming her, even if she isn’t really interested in what inspired it. She knows she has some defensive skills, but she’s intentionally let herself grow rusty. She’s just never been interested in facing down monsters herself. “It’s just nice. Finally. Having some options besides fight or die.”
Dean climbed out from the car, the engine left idling. He trudged his way down into the ditch, wondering what had caused a pumpkin patch to incongruously grow here.
He then checks his work email as a distraction to the quiet, and drafts replies to a couple messages in his inbox. He can send them in the morning, when the timestamp won’t incriminate him in his workaholic ways. It’s fine. It’s a way to pass the evening productively. He doesn’t have anyone else to embrace his attention.
Cas groaned again, stirring Dean with the feel of lax fingers carding through his hair. He set his mouth against Dean’s skin, and murmured, “You’re thinking again.”
Dean turns, nodding, though his head continues bobbing without his control. He crocodile-weaves back the way he came, legs burning, sweat pouring down his back. His whole body is trembling by the time he makes it to her.
“Oh yeah?” Dean eyes him, gazing flickering above the steering wheel.
Most surprising of all, to Raphael’s immediate right sits Michael Charleson, their CEO.
Castiel goes back to emailing all his inquiries about their latest scheduled updates. His questions are straightforward and thoughtful, whittled down to a concise core. Dean can tell that he’s spent extra time on every item currently facing legacy, examining each change request with a heightened sense of scrutiny. If there are any future fuckups coming from their team, Castiel certainly won’t be the one responsible for them.
They can’t protect every corner of the bunker, so some strategic decisions get made about what parts of it they can save.
Dean will batten down the hatches and ensure his team weathers the shitstorm coming their way.
Cas rakes his fingers up through the back of Dean’s hair, and Dean trembles, his dry lips pressed even tighter against the warmth of Cas’ skin.
Chuck plants a finger on his lips. “Hmm. No. There’s one last friend I think you ought to face. Y’know. Since we’re reminiscing, so close to the end.” He snaps his fingers, and there appears—
It’s when his runny nose starts sneezing, and his headaches are joined by a wet, racking cough, that things start going sideways. At least, Dean would like to blame feeling like shit for the stupid thing that comes his way.
Dean tucks his mouth in against Cas’ neck as he hugs him, arms coming up strong even as—knees shaking—the rest of his body weakens. He feels like all the life in him is vanishing, dissipating. He’s been hollowed out for days, rung out and twisted until all the tears have fallen free, reduced to a husk waiting for a stiff wind to up and blow him away.
, Dean thinks. It’s perfect. “Get you a man,” he mumbles, leading Castiel to laugh out loud.
He pushes the car into drive.
Dean dumped the glass into the sink, refilled it with cold water from the tap. The kitchen looked like it hadn’t been touched in days; the dishwasher was empty, the counters clean. Either Cas dutifully kept up on his chores even while sick, or he hadn’t been eating recently.
But Dean had already risen to his feet, hands slapped against his thighs. “Don’t worry, I’ll figure it out. A stove’s a stove, right?”
Dean’s gaze trailed back to the television, then purposefully darted away. He then glanced back to Castiel, at which point his gaze would dart offside again. Castiel watched this pattern repeat itself, a rosy finish hitting Dean’s cheeks each time a particularly noisy moan rattled through the television speakers.
After a night spent chugging coffee and hauling ass across the country, spurred on by one
“They’re safe?” Claire says.
“No,” Sam hisses back, although his cheeks blossom into a rosy hue. He pushes back his chair, standing miles above the rest of the seated crowd, and waves over at one side of the room.
“No, it would only... cheapen it.” Castiel’s mouth twitches down. “He would know you were doing it more for me than for him.”
They had exchanged phone numbers, a year ago, during an app outage that had left Dean stranded without a way to book his heat appointment. When he had called into the help desk at the time, Dean was transferred to Cas’ private line almost as soon as he gave his account number; the client services rep had even sounded bubbly, pronouncing, “Oh, hi, Dean!” so brightly it seemed like they were already friends.
. “You know. Because you always wear such fancy suits. No? Alright, I can wear it instead.”
Dean bites back a laugh. Like he’d believe Castiel’s word after something like this.
Dean rounds on Sam outside the mess hall, the two of them sequestered on a private pergola looking out on the open lake. “Dude, what the hell? What’re you doing here?”
“Whoa, whoa.” Dean slashes his hand. “Okay, one: don’t ever say boil. Two: what d’you mean, there’s a new section? The puke perimeter’s just started—”
“Don’t,” Dean mumbled. “Don’t make me forget you’re paid to be here.”
“Okay. See you soon,” Castiel murmurs. His fingertips linger by Dean’s temple, dragging slowly out from his hair.
“Mm,” Dean agrees, slathering the scrub across his nose and chin. “Except we can’t, not without proving everything’s kosher around here.”
Dean merely moans around his forkful, tastebuds bursting like fireworks across his mouth. A private part of him thrills at the pink hue rising on Castiel’s cheeks in response to the noises he’s making, the same part of him that keeps chanting
Dean waits until he can no longer see Cas before finally closing the door.
His cheeks look pink, his tie askew. Dean vaguely wants to tug on the tie to straighten it out. He feels like he ought to be putting in a call to some kind of cryptid society, marking down the rare occasion of Castiel being seen outside his office.
“You’re so strong,” Dean murmurs, awed as Garth drags him to his doom.
Sam takes a deep breath, his body stilling. He puts the demon knife to his own throat.
And Castiel looked so damn
“Cas?” Dean switched his shopping basket to his elbow, pushing his finger into his other ear. “That you?”
Something about this place is so warm, and yet so mournful. He senses loss emanating from the walls around him. From a room above him.
“Hey.” Dean stills Castiel’s hands by enveloping them with his own. “You said this isn’t a fancy event.”
Dean swills a sip. “Yep.”
Dean stills. He steps closer, exiting the orbital path he’s been pacing. “You got shot, Cas. Some idiot you were with figured silver buckshot would take the wolves out quick, whether or not you were in the line of fire.”
“Yeah, my mom lost her hearing when she was young, so I’ve been signing my whole life.”  He explained.  “It’s just second nature now.  Dean didn’t tell me you guys were coming.”
“Hey Guys!”  Amara cheerfully entered the industrial kitchen.  It didn’t seem to have undergone as much updating as the main rooms in the bunker had.  It was still all cold steel and big.  The guys were sitting around the small table, steaming mugs of coffee in front of them.
“Yeah, sure.  But seriously, are you okay?”  Sam’s asked.  “I mean the last couple of days has been a whole lot of ‘new things’ for you.  Are you really good… with everything?”
Jack seemed confused.  “The same way you guys will.  Bad things happen.  It’s a part of life.  Would you want me to take your memories away?  No matter how bad they are, they’re what makes you the people you are.”
, and tosses and turns for most of the night.
“I haven’t been. First one in months. I’ll get over it, Cas. Don’t worry about me.” One of Cas’s hands moves down to rub against his arm, a clear gesture of attempted comfort. Dean wishes he could actually derive relief from it rather than just feel the ever-present pit of fragility churning in his stomach.
Although, he also considers how Cas will be there to bring him round from those bone shaking nightmares, to bear with him while he tediously double and triple checks that they’re safe and secure.
Dean smiles, looking down at his sockless, cold feet bashfully. His cheeks warm a little. “Yeah, well. Don’t forget your tea, by the way.” He points towards the cup and sees Cas’ mirrored smile when he looks back up.
Returning the look, Sam reaches up with his own bottle and clinks them together, the sound still ringing in Dean’s ears as he downs almost half of it in one gulp.
“Yeah, and I’m here.”
He doesn’t let it happen, though—can’t screw this up—just catches his arms with deft hands and stops Cas before he can back away. Dean’s touch keeps them barely half a foot apart, and their noses bump unceremoniously when he leans back in.
Charlie arrives early enough for Dean to still be blinking sleep out of his eyes. She comes blustering into the bunker with an overly excited greeting and a toothy grin. Swaddling party supplies in both arms, she pads down the staircase and dumps everything on the map table gracelessly with a relieved breath.
“I understand why you’re upset, and I’d defend your brother to the ends of the earth. These things aren’t mutually exclusive.”
There’s an eerie calm between them, then. Dean’s expecting a comeback, though unsure of what kind. There’s nothing for a moment, just silence stretching thin until Cas chokes out a laugh drenched in disbelief.
Leaning against the doorframe, Dean watches him contentedly, shitty day getting infinitely better as Cas turns to him with soft eyes. “Hi,” he greets. The dog brushes against Dean’s leg as he walks straight past, following the scent of food.
shouldn’t have to do this. He should be in there himself apologising or grovelling, trying to make it up to Sam by whatever means necessary. Cas’ unwavering, confident explanation of the way his brain works makes an unidentifiable feeling settle over him. Dean’s follow up thought is that he’s so unfathomably
“Don’t, Dean—would you just listen to me?” begs Cas, still in pursuit.
The immediate guilt hits like a freight train, but Charlie seems to blow right past his sharp words.
Dean showers quickly, barely feels the water beating against his skin but comes out feeling a lot less grubby all the same.
Just like that, Dean is stunned into silence. There’s no figuring out how that works. He’s spent the last three months feeling like a dead thing, Cas’ absence a physical, constant weight on his shoulders—but Cas left for
“Dean.”
here. I look around and all I can seem to see are the awful things that’ve happened.” He glances up towards the library, “just over there, Michael slaughtered all of those people. You and I fought. Barely a foot away from where we stand was the last place I ever saw Jack before he left to rebuild heaven.”
He’s surprised to hear Cas reply, voice level. “I understand why you’re upset. Dean...he’s got a lot going on. It piles up in his mind like it would anybody’s. The dam breaking just doesn’t always have the most ideal timing, I suppose.”
“Yeah.” Cas gives Dean’s hand a final squeeze before letting go. “I’ll go get breakfast on. Don't forget, Sam and Eileen are coming over for lunch, too.”
He tells himself that he isn’t solely looking for Cas as he takes a quick scan of the room, elevated above most of the guests on the top step leading into the library.
They kiss and fall into it a little, warm touches pressing against Dean’s chest. He hooks a calf around the back of Cas’, and Dean slots his hands under the back of his shirt amorously before he’s pushed back softly.
She sighs sympathetically, “I just—I know you were a little cut up after—you know.”
there, that he’d never left in the first place. There was just so much unresolved baggage that Dean honestly felt was one-sided. The thought of seeing Cas was just a lot.
“You’re exhausted,” Cas quietly points out with a fond smile, their noses bumping.
“I’m good, I swear,” he promises.
“Awesome,” Dean says dryly, “healthy.” He sits on a stool at the island and swivels round towards Cas.
could make Cas laugh like that—when
Sam’s poring over an ASL dictionary when Dean steps back into the war room. His hands switch between scribbling notes and practising signing, subtly nodding to himself as he checks back and forth between his own written words and the book beside them.
“Cas?”
Dean looks up to see Sam frowning over at him. “Okay. Then what the hell are you still doing here?”
“I wouldn’t dare.” Dean holds his hands up in mock surrender and goes to step back. He hasn’t really moved all that much since things started to get a little hazy, and the shift makes him trip over his own feet a little, bumping into someone.
“Dean,” Cas starts.
slide and settles for an irked grunt and a shrug. “He’s—he says he’s got this whole life up there. Friends, a job, a damn
“I suppose it is.”
Chuckling dryly, Sam doesn't even spare him a glance. “Building’s only like two million years old. You figure it out.”
They park the car and step out. Sam walks into the motel looking at his phone, texting rapidly with a grin. Dean smiles, ignores the pangs of loss and jealousy in his gut and heads for the bar. He orders and the bartender gives him a brazen, flirtatious smirk that he’d read into if not for the incessant ache in his chest that just won’t subside.
He wants Cas to be happy within himself—whether Dean’s involved or not—of course he does. He’s just getting impatient waiting for when he’ll reach a point where he’s happy without Cas.
“Look, Cas—I know I haven’t exactly been there for you since you left,” Dean says.
so we’re not seeing each other until tomorrow. Jody picked her up about a half hour ago. They’re at a hotel. Girls’ night or whatever.”
“Dean,” Cas speaks, tone desperate but barely audible even with their proximity.
“Dean?” she presses.
“It’s actually the Bridal Chorus, but I like where your head’s at,” she pulls away, still gripping Sam by the biceps as she looks up at him, beaming. “I can’t believe you’re getting—”
The thought that Cas would leave without saying goodbye is one he doesn’t even want to entertain. Cas being capable of saying and doing the things he had and then departing without a word—departing at all, really—is implausible to Dean.
Cas moves back, out of Dean’s personal space, but leans next to him.
“Don’t
“Cas—” Dean starts.
It’s deathly quiet for a minute. Dean figures he’s probably talking to Jody or Bobby or something, offloading on whoever they have left that’s closest to family.
could hold his attention by telling a dumb joke or exaggerated story—and then he just feels a little sick. It’s the drink doing a number on him, obviously.
Charlie just looks over at him, face blank, and she’s quieter than she’s been since stepping foot in the bunker. With a muted nod, she steps away, “I’ll go get started on the food.”
“I—uh,” he tries, throat tightening and eyes stinging, “I can’t hear you, kid. I’ll call you later.”
He really does try to keep the inevitable irritated look at bay, but Dean can’t quite help the reaction. Not being able to process sympathy without it transitioning to pity isn’t one of Dean’s best qualities, but he figures he’s set in his ways by now.  “I’m fine, man.”
Dean pays for his drink and answers, pressing the phone to his ear. “Hey, kid.” He hears something to the tune of a greeting drowned out by the bustling bar noises. Claire’s voice is almost inaudible and Dean rolls his eyes before turning to his brother. “Gonna have to take this outside. Can’t hear a damn word,” he mutters. “Claire, one sec. Can’t hear you.”
Maybe at some point in the future, Cas will call and he’ll ask how things are in Kansas and Dean will tell him everything’s great and normal and
“Pretend you’re okay if you aren’t. It’s me, Dean.”
bitter in his mouth.
Following the noise, Dean finds himself inching closer and closer to the war room. It’s Sam speaking, clear as a bell now; Dean halts anxiously and can’t help but listen.
and Dean’s half cut—
Dean laughs dryly, “don’t be so sure. Kinda think we’re one in the same at this point.”
Sam blunders through from behind Dean as Cas descends the steps. They meet at the bottom and Dean can only watch, face still warm from Cas’ gaze, as Sam grips him into a hug.
Timing helpful as ever, his stomach groans and Cas chuckles, stepping away, “and hungry.”
I’d drive you to the ends of the earth and back if you’d let me.
“We’re good. Just grabbing a beer. You all okay?” he asks, aimlessly kicking up a little dirt.
Sam laughs, “nevermind.”
But, his brain is far too comfortable turning just about any overwhelming feeling into anger. At some point along the way, he figures he’s given up trying to break the habit.
Dean ignores the dizzying pounding in his head and forces himself upright, legs swinging off the edge of the bed. He stands and walks to his dresser, pulling out a t-shirt and sweatpants before slipping into them—fresh clothes feeling like a small godsend—and stepping out into the all too bright hallway.
Cas squints at him, “Dean, that isn’t fair.”
—I’m so used to things—people—being taken from us. We’re safe, we’re okay, but it’s like I’m just constantly waiting for the other shoe to drop.”
wants to be assertive—he wants to be confident and bold and assured. He wants to sweep Cas off his feet without hesitation or pause and make him think
, just from standing and talking it out with Cas even though they barely scratched the surface of all the shit between them. It wasn’t bad blood—it could never be—more a small mountain of repressed feelings that no one ever dared to bring up.
“Talk to me,” Cas utters and moves to peck Dean’s back. He feels a stubbly cheek being smoothed over his skin and Dean barely notices himself leaning back into the touch.
Legitimate work is a
The words settle heavily between them. It’s a lot to digest at once. After a decade of nothing but unspoken sentiments and weighted looks, having everything thrown out in the open like this isn’t something Dean’s braced for. He settles for stating the obvious, dumbly.
Dean accepts his fate as he watches him turn back towards the oven and switch off the gas. Cas takes two bowls from the drying rack by the sink and fills them up, placing one in front of Dean before circling the island and taking a seat opposite him.
“I couldn’t sleep. Thought I’d make some tea.” Cas nods over towards a cup brewing on the side, “would you like a cup?”
He shrugs, “not really.”
Cas lets his gaze linger on Dean for a second and then looks away suddenly, almost as though he’s scolding himself for the act of self-indulgence. Stepping past Dean, he treads over to the map table and slings the bag over his shoulder, halting when he gets to the bottom of the staircase.
He remembers Cas—his voice gritty describing Dean’s insufferable stubbornness, his lips slotting desperately between Dean’s, soft and shaking hands skating over bare skin in the black of the room, limbs tangled.
“Hey.” Dean winces at the tremor in his voice, but pushes on. “Sorry.”
Sam’s briefly quiet before a sigh punctures the silence. “I know, I said stuff too. We’ll talk,” he says. “Does he know you’re leaving?”
Already anticipating and steeling himself for Cas’ look of disapproval, Dean looks over at him, and sure enough, there it is. They’re standing a lot closer now, so the disappointment in Cas’ face is practically in high definition.
Cas tugs the door open, about to leave when Dean calls him back. “Cas?”
“I’m gonna give you two a minute,” he says, clearly uncomfortable. Sloping off towards the hallway, he turns to look at Dean before he’s out of sight. “We’ll talk later, yeah?”
Thoughts akin to this have been darting around in his mind all day, just something else to be jolted aside in lieu of more pressing things. Coming face to face with it like this, saying it aloud, admitting it to himself in a grimy alley in a part of Dallas he’s never heard of makes it hit home.
“Dean—” interjects Cas, shaking his head dismissively.
Cas shifts a little, hauling Dean’s attention right back to him. He cracks open a narrow eye and squints at the room’s hue, only made so bright by the sunlight gleaming in through the thin blinds. His eye shuts for a brief second before both are opening. Cas doesn’t bother to look around the room, his eyes falling straight onto Dean.
“What you cooking, anyway?” he asks, dropping Cas’ hand with a squeeze and looking past him at the pan on the flattop. “Smells steaky.”
“One sec, there’s just something I don’t get. If you two slept together, why’d he leave?”
The nod Cas gives in return is ever so slight, barely noticeable if Dean’s eyes weren’t zeroed in on whatever part of him he can see.
After spending his entire life going up and down the country, seeing all the sights and the landmarks and things that would make most people wide eyed with shock and awe, Dean’s over it. He’s bored of the picturesque country roads and the monumental bridges and the skyscrapers that pierce the clouds. He’s seen them all before.
Dean can’t believe that the thought of rolling over isn’t daunting. He thinks about getting to look at Cas through the sleep in his eyes, being able to lean over and plant lazy kisses on his skin, and a giddy feeling bubbles up in his chest because he
It’s not that Dean doesn’t want Cas there. Hell, pretty much all he’s done for the past few months is wish Cas
“And the worst thing is that you did that for me but I don’t even feel grateful because from where I’m standing, I’m facing life without you and it terrifies me.”
Dean’s brain relays his wasted words back to him and he tries not to visibly cringe. He can practically feel the rough brick wall where it’d been pressed against his back through his jacket. Trying not to shudder, he turns to Charlie, eyes steely and affronted.
“No, Cas. I can’t—if you really wanna go back there so bad then just get out of here. Why are you dragging this out? Fuck.” Dragging a hand down his face, he’s anticipating Cas’ reaction to the abrupt tone shift between them.
Determined to get started on remedying it, Dean steps closer still. “Powers or no powers,” he grasps Cas’ forearms tentatively and looks down, “I never stopped needing you here. Not for a damn second.”
The embrace around him loosens, and Dean has to stop himself picturing the dejected look he knows is on Cas’s face. He reaches up to grip Cas’s arm before he can pull away.
Cas will be there to call him brave when he needs to hear it and Dean figures that at some point, in the end, he just might be alright.
A deafening silence falls over them for a few moments.
tell you is that he’s spent the last however many years sacrificing
He looks down and squeezes his eyes shut. “Don’t—you can’t
Cas doesn’t reply, but treads over to the fridge to put the beer back. He turns and levels Dean with a gaze, and Dean almost feels as though he’s being examined.
what they needed to to draw this twelve year long dance to a close—a night together rivalled by no other, a shitty, stuffy goodbye and a promise of civility going forward.
“Yeah, we’re great. Donna drove down to us when everyone was...y’know, put back,” laughs Claire. “Jody’s ordering us a pizza. She might even let me have a celebratory beer or six.” Jody chimes a loud
Cas looks up at him from over Sam’s shoulder, eyes soft, and Dean can hardly breathe—gone all over again, just like that. Back to square one. The feeling of it is so all-encompassing, and Dean quickly realises he never got past square one in the first place.
A little spaced out and too caught up drinking in the sight of Cas’ profile—perfectly pointed nose and sculpted chin—Dean barely feels it when a hand winds around his own and tugs softly. Cas looks back over at him, pushes away from the wall and moves backwards towards the open door. His first step over the threshold is mostly silent but still manages to sound thunderous.
Dean doesn’t tear his gaze away from Cas’—he wouldn’t dare—as he reaches down past a slim hip he hadn’t long ago had a vice grip around, and twists his doorknob. The door swings open with a groan of its own and Cas looks away then. He glances back into the room as far as he can see around the wall.
Whatever song his headphones are blaring, Dean doesn’t really hear it. He’d managed to trudge his way back through to his room without any run-ins with anybody—although, Dean’s not entirely sure he would’ve registered it if he had. There’s a numbness in his limbs that makes him feel heavy, something akin to grief without the forced finality but a loss all the same.
Disbelief had been the prominent one, although he wasn’t sure why. For the few hunters he’d known that had managed to quit the life, marriage wasn’t unheard of. Having it announced to him solo as though they were addressing the masses brought it a lot closer to home, though.
“Awesome,” Dean laughs humorlessly, “that’s—yeah. Awesome.” He runs a hand over his eyes and down his face, exhausted, and Sam’s peering at him when he looks back up. There’s a curious, barely concealed quirk to his expression that Dean can’t quite figure out. “What?”
“Normal,” Cas assures him, as he always seems to be able to. He clutches Dean’s hand tighter. “The things that still trouble you, Dean...how can you expect them not to?”
and he’ll pretend that he’s okay and that he’s moved on. Dean will ask how him about Iowa and Cas will tell him it’s perfect and that he’s met somebody and he’s happy, and Dean will pretend a knife to the gut wouldn’t hurt less.
“You need something?” he asks, sounding a little agitated.
Cas’ expression shifts from forlorn to hopefully desperate in an instant as he says, barely a whisper between them, “my apartment’s big.”
“Seriously, drink up. You think the old ball and chain is gonna let you knock back a few cold ones whenever you want? Game’s changed now, kid.”
We’ve spent the last six months living like the damn Brady Bunch and I can’t even get over shit that happened years ago? Come on, Cas, that’s—”
Charlie huffs, holding her hands up in defeat. “Okay, I won’t, but
He’s barely a step away when a touch wraps around his shoulder and is grappling at his shirt tightly. Dean’s spun back around with a tug, and he’s kind of expecting Cas to punch him in the face or something--God knows he deserves it--so he just tries to ready himself for whatever’s to come.
“What the hell is that supposed to mean?” Anger that’s all too familiar flares up inside Dean, and he hates the way his words even
“It’s a little too obvious how jealous you are. Catch up later when you aren’t seeing double, alright?” Sam claps him on the shoulder again, this time condescendingly, and the dam breaks.
Dean drops down from resting his head on his hand, elbow still having been propped up, and nestles his head into his pillow. Rested, unwavering hands reach out to grip his shirt and pull him closer, and he’s cuddling in against Cas’s side without giving it a thought.
His heart had been in his throat, stomach sinking. Dean still sees the terrified look in Cas’s eyes like the image is forever etched onto the backs of his eyelids, still feels the touch of their skin together where he’d reached over and gripped Cas’s hand, terrified that it could’ve been his last chance. What he still remembers most, though, is clutching Cas close to him when it was all over, embracing him tightly, never wanting to let go, before nosing his way across Cas’s cheek to press their lips together. The relief Dean had felt was immeasurable.
Charlie’s quiet and it’s suspicious, so Dean dares to glance over at her. Her eyebrows are knitting together, and she’s levelling him with a gaze that’s calling him a liar.
Miracle trots over from in the living room and winds himself between Dean’s legs, tail wagging furiously. “Hey, buddy,” he coos, bending to pat the dog’s head and ignoring the twinge at the bottom of his back.
“Dean,” Cas starts and turns their hands over, slotting their fingers together. “You’ve spent your life confronting and defeating things that are beyond most people’s comprehension. You’ve saved the world more times than I can count on one hand, and you’ve actually died on just as many occasions. If you think that doesn’t take a toll on a person, then I don’t know what to tell you.”
Cas’s head is buried below the duvet for the most part, but Dean’s itching to see him, knows it’s what he needs to completely pull him back to earth. It’s in Cas’s warm gaze that he manages to find any semblance of peace, every time without fail.
So, yeah. Not exactly a road trip, but that’s not to say it doesn’t feel good to set off knowing he isn’t seeing these things because someone’s writing about him seeing these things.
He lets a small, earnest smile slip and drops his head. He rubs an anxious hand over the back of his neck. “Uh, no. I’m good. Not much of a tea guy.” To this end, Dean straightens himself up and heads across the room to the fridge. He pulls out a frosty bottle of beer before walking over towards the metal kitchen island and leaning back against it.
“Hm?”
Dean hears the unspoken ‘
Dean swears he can actually feel Cas’ footsteps picking up their pace behind him, swears he can feel the thud of his soles vibrating as they hit the floor behind him, but he doesn’t stop.
Dean’s just getting started mouthing at Cas’ jaw when the telltale sound of a creaky door echoes through the hallways. They part, panting, and glance down towards the noise’s direction before looking back at each other.
Before Claire can say another word, Dean cuts the call and shuts his phone off in record time. He shoves it back into his pocket and leans back against the wall of the building. The brick chafes against his back through his jacket warm and rough and he barely feels it as his eyes fall closed.
“Awesome,” Dean says dryly.
He hears Cas sigh, and his chest feels close to cracking open. “I told him last night that I’d be leaving in the morning. I haven’t said goodbye, though, if that’s what you’re asking.”
“You don’t have to do this, you know,” Cas murmurs, low voice sounding from just behind Dean’s ear.
but the words die out on their painful, false crawl up his throat.
Sweat born of pure fear has soaked the back of his shirt and the crown of his head but he’s home, he’s safe, he’s okay.
“You’ve said it all, Cas. Go get some sleep. You’re up early, right?” He keeps walking as he mocks. He’s on the home straight now, bedroom door in sight.
before it’s left Cas’ mouth. He prepares himself for hearing something about how it isn’t a good idea, and he’s more than a little surprised when Cas says, “but I’m working tomorrow. I have to head off early.”
would probably put a damper on the mood.
He remembers, then.
,” he sputters, “I’m needed there.”
It’s all too much, then. Images flood his mind of this unattainable far off life, perfect domesticity and comfort. He and Cas dancing around each other in a cluttered Iowan apartment, no concerns but each other, once a week food shopping in a cutesy small town grocery store, bickering over which cereal to go for instead of the life or death decisions that they’re so used to, late night dinners at inexpensive diners with good food and the love of his life.
Dean’s always forced himself to be the strong one. Whether he was standing by Cas’s side, or Sam’s, or even Jack’s, he’s willed himself to keep it together for them. They’re out of the woods now, though; Chuck’s dead, he’s safe. There’s no great adversary for him to remain fierce against anymore, but some habits are hard to break.
smell good.”
Dean sucks in a deep breath as he feels a shift behind him. He braces himself to hear an irritated, tired sigh or to be told that yeah, he’s being stupid and worrying over nothing. It doesn’t pan out, though, and Dean hates how surprised he is when Cas sits down next to him on the edge of the bed. He reaches over to take Dean’s hand and caresses the back of it with a soothing brush of his thumb.
Vows are exchanged and the tooth-rotting sweetness of it all takes no prisoners. The guests coo and hum at certain parts and laugh at others. Dean feels himself exhale a little shakily as he watches Jody wipe her eyes.
“Nobody’s perfect. Not even you,” Cas quips, the comment uncharacteristically backhanded.
With everything in him, Dean wishes he could blame this weighted, heady feeling on the fact that
“Of course,” Cas replies, voice harsh as if him leaving without saying anything was preposterous even as an idea. “I just don’t know how.”
. I feel at home with you.”
He pointedly does not look at Cas, can’t bear to see whatever expression he wears as Dean bares what he feels are the deepest parts of himself.
“Yeah.” Dean twists the cap off of the bottle and takes a long swig of water, already feeling a little better—physically, at least. “God, I’m such an asshole.”
Dean’s chest heaves at the admission and it’s suddenly too much. He forces himself upright, wipes his face and cringes at the wetness.
Looking down at their joined hands, Dean feels his breath catch in his throat.
Sam hesitates for a moment as though he’s afraid of his own words before uttering, “I heard you this morning,” in what Dean presumes to be the smallest voice he could’ve mustered.
Dean turns his attention back to Charlie and Kaia pointedly, an effort to distract himself, and tries to tune into their conversation. Unsurprisingly, they’re still talking about Claire.
“Mm.” The hand on the back of Dean’s head pulls him down, and Cas takes his lips again briefly before pulling away. “I had a dream about you, actually. There were less clothes involved, though.”
Sam’s shoving his way through the crowd and heading away from Dean when he looks back. A quiet has fallen over the room, the tinny, muffled playback of party music and uncomfortable mumbling the only things audible.
for you,” Sam gripes. “His beliefs, his family, his way of existing—all of it to fit around you. Don’t think I need to tell you why.”
, man. She doesn’t deserve that.”
Dean’s not sure why it hadn’t occurred to him that Claire wouldn’t know—that she’d ask about Cas with such flippant abandon and optimism that it drags him back down to earth with a bruising thud.
He shakes his head, looking down at his own hands toying with his headphones in his lap. “The opposite. He pretty much said I could move in with him if I wanted to,” he chuckles emptily.
Eventually, Dean starts to doze off. He dreams, not too vividly or lucidly, but hears himself say
Padding his way through to the kitchen takes a little longer than it probably should, having to stop to stabilise himself against the wall a good few times, and he almost jumps out of his skin when he steps up into the room and there’s already somebody skulking in there.
Craving more touch, Dean slings an arm across the thin waist he’s huddled up against and cranes upwards, burrowing his face into the dip between Cas’s shoulder and neck. The all too familiar smell of his skin takes over all Dean knows, and again, he feels like one of the lucky ones.
Cas reaches over and cups Dean’s cheek in his palm. The pressure of Cas’ warm touch against his skin urges him to look back over, meet his eyes and face whatever’s showing through them.
The hangover kicks in hours before it usually does. Dean’s clock blinks the time at him from his bedside table in the pitch black of his room—it’s just after three—and his head throbs dully with the promise that he’s going to feel like shit warmed up for the rest of the day.
A soft huff sounds from Cas’ direction. Dean registers it as a laugh and is about to ask what’s so damn funny about him hurling insults at his brother on the most important day of his life when Cas says, “I always give credit where it’s due, but I don’t think anything could’ve really ruined today for him. I’m not sure anybody but Eileen had his attention. Not really.”
Dean rolls his eyes but puts up no real fight. He walks through to the kitchen and heads for the fridge, pulling out a coke each for Sam and Charlie as well as a bottle for himself. Peering around the room as he moves to go back to the war room, Dean admires how good Charlie has managed to make it look—considering the bunker’s kitchen did leave a lot to be desired in the way of interior design.
trying to make him understand. “Dean!”
“Yeah, yeah.”
He ambles through the house on achy, socked feet, Miracle right on his tail. Cas is standing at the stove, stirring a pan of something.
“For what it’s worth,” his eyes shine, voice quiet, “I think this could be something really good.”
“You talk to Eileen?” Dean asks, setting his beer down on the bar.
The balloons are all blown up by the time Sam’s wandering back into the room, and Dean’s more out of breath than he cares to admit. “Cas is heading over soon. Should be here around two.”
“Why?” Dean challenges, “that asshole didn’t.”
Dean can feel the wall building itself back up, racking up his defenses. He puts space back between them.
Having been dubbed the prep area, the kitchen’s messier than Dean’s ever seen it. His little brother’s wedding is something that Dean knows he should be looking forward to, and while he is, he’s never been the biggest fan of mess
Sam doesn’t take heed and keeps wringing his hands together. “Where the hell is Cas? We’ve got stuff to go over.”
“Are you going to?” asks Sam.
“Sorry,” Dean mumbles, barely pulling away. He’s just shushed and kissed again. He hopes Cas knows he’s apologising for more than the clumsy positioning. Knowing Dean better than most, he probably does.
Dean knows that given all their close calls, he should’ve by now learned the importance of saying what he feels. He should’ve learned to say it, scream it, fucking sing it, but he hasn’t. He’s starting to think he’ll get there, though.
Chest tightening, Dean feels a lot all at once. Guilt, confusion, love. He’s sick to death of being bombarded with emotion—more so the past few days than ever before. Dean yearns for the ability to compartmentalise, to be able to box up every feeling that passes through his mind and study it at length. More than anything, he craves the ability to know how to deal with it all.
“Am I not saying it right? I’m fine. Jesus.”
“Just appreciate the lack of responsibility.” Then he’s nodding towards the table, face impatient. “Now, leave me alone. Kind of a race against the clock here.”
Dean’s chest actually aches with adoration.
“Yeah, yeah,” Dean says simply.
Dean smiles in a feeble attempt to soften the atmosphere. “I was the safe bet after all. Who would’ve thought, huh?” Charlie fixes him with a glare bordering on murderous, and his face falls.
Cas goes on, Dean’s bewilderment clearly not deterring him. “It—the town’s nice. Quaint. You’d like it, I think.”
He wants to be assertive, yet he’s anything but. Dean’s hands tremble as he clasps one around Cas’ forearm, drops the other down to his waist and presses their foreheads together.
Dean laughs, coming to the bottom of the staircase. “Last night on earth, right?”
His words hang heavy in the air between them. Sam glances back as he leaves the room, and they share a look.
Cas unwinds his arms from around Dean, and that unbridled fear returns. He’s sure that it’s finally happened, Cas has gotten sick of him and his woe-is-me defeatist attitude, and his whiny venting monologue was the final straw. Grace all burned out, he’s human now. Cas has realised that the world’s his oyster and the last thing he needs is Dean’s pessimism dragging him down.
“No—I’m glad I can give you something to talk about with your pals. S’not like you can talk about your own problems, right? None to talk about, being so damn perfect ‘n’ all.” Dean laughs, sound void of any actual amusement. Charlie mumbles his name at his side, an attempt to rein him in, but he takes no notice. “Honestly, though. I’m surprised you’re not getting your fill right now. Last day of freedom, Sammy.”
Watching as Cas’ face changes from one of content complacency to something a little more nervous, Dean shifts on his feet anxiously. He worries he’s gone too far; they haven’t spoken in months, after all. It’s unreasonable to expect Cas to just go back to how they were, but he’s realised this all a little too late. Dean goes to retract his words but he’s cut off.
Cas shakes his head in disappointed surrender and steps back. “There’s no getting through to you when you’re like this. There never has been.”
Cas delivers the ceremony with all the confidence and assurance that Dean had expected. He knows it’s exactly what Sam needs, so he lets go of any resentment. Eileen’s smile practically reaches her eyes as Sam signs and translates the words to her, and it’s enough.
His hands are already settling on the wheel when Dean realises what’s missing.
His survival instinct kicks in, tells him to cut the pain’s legs out from beneath it, and his feet are moving towards the war room without his explicit permission. It feels like the sensible part of his brain telling him to get this the hell over with.
“Awesome. Glad you guys are good.”
The slamming of the metal door as Cas steps out of sight reverberates through Dean’s body, setting every nerve alight. An unwelcome rush of bile crawls its way up his throat, but Dean just swallows it down and barely feels the burn.
“Any experience counts,” Castiel grumbles at the counter.
Which is strange. He doesn’t remember much, but he remembers not needing to breathe.
“Cas,” Dean says. “No. Here’s what’s gonna happen: you’re not gonna apologize, and I’m not gonna say it was a mistake.” He licks his lips. “I am sorry, though. I shouldn’t’ve waited so long to tell you. And I shouldn’t have taken it out on you when you didn’t want to stay.”
Dean hauls the phone back up to his ear. “Yeah. But I can’t read it. What’re you trying to send?”
Sam shakes his head. “Nothing.” But his smile says something else.
Sam sighed behind him. “You fucked up.”
Castiel smiles. “Tell me that isn’t what scares you away.”
With his fingertips brushing the coarse hair trailing down to his genitals, he tried envisioning naked bodies entwined in pleasure. He conjured a memory of a Macedonian couple who had been his charges millennium ago, and who had curated a habit of lavishing their attention on multiple partners. The sighs and slapping flesh of those nights still haunted Castiel’s memories, and though they should have served to rouse his own interest … they did not.
The leaves all turn brown. Shrivel up. Die.
Dean rolls his eyes. “Focus, Cas. Tell me ‘bout your research.”
Sighing, Dean slides off the trunk. He sets aside his bottle, wraps his hand around Cas’ cool wrist, feeling out the strength in his palm before slotting their fingers together. “C’mere. We can fix two of the three right now.”
Dean blows out a breath, all dust and exhaust fumes. “You know what? Fine. Keep pretending like you didn’t know and I’ll—”
Castiel spreads his wings, taking flight.
Ricky smiles through the joke, but Doug frowns briefly. “No, you’re right. I should grab one too, maybe, if Garth’s gonna …” He thinks it over a moment longer, then adds with finality, “Yeah, a cow heart too, if you have one.”
A cannulae is fitted beneath his nose, resting light against his skin. He closes his eyes as she reassess him, asking if he’s okay. He nods, then speaks when she asks him to.
When Dean opens his eyes, the first thing he sees is Sam trying desperately not to laugh, and Rowena beside him, failing to do the same. But it is Cas whose eyes bore through him, watching deadly still and silent, staring with an intensity Dean hasn’t seen since he first kissed Anna in front of Cas, in a barn almost a decade ago.
“You’re really good,” Castiel tells him, after Dean manages another ten-point strike. They’re up by only four points, and in danger of going over fifty should Miriam manage to make another bullseye after him.
“Sorry—d’you want to bunk alone?” Sam asked.
“Throat’s scratchy,” Dean tells him. “Kinda expect it after talking to Sammy for so long, though.”
“Could you try to be a little nicer?” Sam says, annoyed, but the schedule in Cas’s hand somehow becomes vastly more interesting than anything Sam could ever say.
Dean seals off entire dormitories with angel sigils and demon traps, Sam following, chanting strengthening spells in his wake. Jack makes trip after trip to the supply room, hauling bags of salt and jugs of holy oil out for them to use, laying them down in strategic lines.
Dean hmmed slowly, glancing over Castiel. Blessedly, he didn’t call Castiel on his obvious fib. He
“Not interested,” Dean growled, annoyed that he had hobbled away from his heat bed for this. Especially since the instant of catching the man’s scent was only worsening his symptoms. Dean tightened his bathrobe over his chest, as if that would mask his current situation, hiding the overwarm skin Dean already had exposed and keeping his impromptu desire at bay.
“Yeah, but—” Dean waves his hand around, grasping. “It’s one thing to say it and another to hear it! Why wouldn’t you bring this to me or the team? Does Inias know? Does Miriam? Just who all knows that this goddamn BEAU project—”
Castiel’s eyes widen, his mouth dropping open, but Dean does not linger to catch any more of his reaction. He pivots on his heel and heads for the back stairwell, leaving Castiel to his elevator ride in peace.
“Got your lamb’s blood,” Ricky says, bending close, scarcely above a murmur. “That femur bone too. It’s a bit nicked-up—rookie did the cut—but should still be good for …” He waves his hand in a slow, small circle, roping up the idea of
“Yeah-huh,” Miriam sing-songs. “Boy’s got an office crush.”
“Alright,” Castiel says slowly, except that Dean isn’t talking to him, and his memory is as solid as Swiss cheese, and it all makes him feel worse still.
“Yes, honey,” Sam says, giving her a peck on the cheek. Cas clears his throat, looking at Rowena, and Dean stares at him, wondering whether Cas’s really bothered by her and Sam’s fake affair.
Castiel’s mouth twists with sympathy, the memory of Dean’s surprise and nerves having haunted him since it became clear Bart never told Dean that Castiel would be attending. It seems both he and Dean get struck by anxiety when it comes to crucial moments. “You can work on it from home. The file is in the cloud.”
“Maybe.” Castiel shifts his footing. “I was working on the priority list for legacy. Bart said I could take it over from you, if that’s alright.”
The screen jostles briefly while Sam redirects the camera. The motion settles, and then Dean’s getting a beaming faceful of his soon-to-be sister-in-law.
Cheeks crinkled up to his eyes, Castiel wipes his mouth on a napkin, then drops it back onto the counter. “I wanted to praise you again for how well you handled the P&I meeting this week. Raphael even mentioned being impressed.”
Amara rolled her eyes and straightened up and took a step toward him.  “Dean, put the gun down.  It won’t hurt me anyway.  We’ll talk.”  She snapped her fingers, and the guys were all squeaky clean, as though they’d never been involved with a messy gang of ghouls.  She snapped again and the table was full of pizza and beer.
“Similar to what?”  Sam finally spoke up.  Apparently, he’d been caught in a fog as well.  He still had his gun aimed at her but lowered it when he realized that Dean and Cas had both secured theirs.
“You have officially lost your damn mind.  And Sam is good with this?”  The voice asked.
“I get it, really.”  Dean chimed in.   “But in this case, if you guys are planning on having a normal life, that could be tough.  All that crap she went through.  How could she possibly have a normal life after that?
Dean reached into the cooler, pulled a couple beers out and threw one to Sam.  “Shut up, bitch”
Cas nodded, but caught Dean’s arm, stopping his escape.  “I know you’re angry, but…”
Just then, Sam and Eileen turned the corner and slid into the other side.  “Carl, this is my brother Sam and Eileen, his girlfriend.”  He waved his hand between the two of them.  “Guys, this is Carl.”  He turned to his friend and rolled his eyes.  “Sam wanted to give you ‘the talk’ before we ride off together.”  Dean picked up the menu and started browsing.
Jack looked to Sam for understanding, then continued.  “When I absorbed Chuck’s power, I wanted to give him Cas back so bad and I wanted to give Castiel his life back.  He died for me.  Even if he triggered the deal to save Dean, the deal, itself was to save me.  I want them to be happy, Sam.  I know Dean is never going to be happy if Cas is in the Empty.  Especially with the way he got there.  I know he blames himself.  I remember how terrified I was of Dean’s blame.  Now he’s projecting all that anger and blame on himself.  To be angry and scared at the same time?  Not doing this?  That will kill him.  He will give up, Sam.  He’ll get sloppy on some low-budget hunt and…”
“What kind of choice is that Jack?”  Dean asked.  “He has to choose between the essence of who he is and what, me?”  He shook his head.  That wasn’t even a choice.  He turned and smiled at Cas.  “At least I know you’re alive.  You better stay that way too.  No more pillow fights with the other angels.  At least you won’t be here.”
Sam ran his fingers through his long hair.  “Yeah, I guess we did.”   It was a damn good thing that he knew Jack was somehow behind this crazy plan otherwise there would be no way in hell he’d be letting his brother do this.  Even if he had to knock him out and lock him in the dungeon until he came to his friggin senses.  “Just be careful and don’t stay dead.”
“I know you’re worried.  I’d be lying if I didn’t say I was too.”  Carl passed Sam a piece of paper.  “I have no idea what this is really about, but he’s way too content with the idea that this can go really bad, if you know what I mean.  But he is adamant about you not being there.”
Dean wasn’t surprised to see the face of his dead father.  Cas had told him one night after a John Wayne movie marathon, how the entity liked to appear as people from the person’s past.
“Is that what you want Dean?  Do you want me to go back to heaven and be a ‘real angel’?”  Cas asked with a tilt of his head.
Cas turned Dean to face him and placed both hands on either of Dean’s shoulders.  “Dean, its fine.  He’s right.  Angels don’t belong on Earth.  You don’t need me anymore.  Jack will make sure that you’re healed and then you can have that freedom, that peace that you’ve always craved without heaven’s interference.”
“Yeah, I get that.  Cas, your Angel, right?”  Carl questioned raising an eyebrow.
Dean took a step forward, almost nose to nose with the entity that looked like his father.  “Bitch, you aint met ‘bothersome’ until you’ve met me.  I will literally tap dance all over your peace and quiet while singing bad karaoke just for shits and giggles.”  He stared at the thing in front of him, refusing to back down.  “Give me Cas.”
“Hey Sammy, we need supplies.”  Dean yelled a few moments later from in front of the refrigerator.  “Got nothing in here but spoiled milk and some sort of nasty, wilted, green stuff.  I’m headed to the store to grab some grub.”
******************
“Jack, Sam and Dean were raised as hunters.  I was an angel for a millennia.  Kelly was just thrust into it all.  She was impregnated by Lucifer, held captive by a prince of hell, chased by angels, and died in excruciating pain.”  Cas may have become human, but he still did not sugar coat things.
“I guess you better spoil me then.  Make sure my mom has lots of Crunch Cookie Crunch… and nougat.  Don’t let her make me like Sam.”  He looked over at Sam and grinned.
Dean took a step forward, moving in front of Cas to protect from what he perceived as danger.  “Yeah well, you’d leave the one and only person who believed in you to rot in the damn empty?  Don’t think for a damn second you’re laying a hand on him.  He’s not staying here.”
Sam took a deep breath and nodded.  He knew Jack was involved in this, but it didn’t seem like Dean did.  “Dean, where did you get the idea to do this?”
“He’s not a hunter, Sam.”  Dean interrupted leaving Carl sitting there with his mouth open, about to spill things Dean didn’t want Sam to know.  Carl just looked down at the table and pursed his lips, outwardly uncomfortable.
Chapter 1
“I’m sorry.  I didn’t think of it that way.  I just assumed.”  Sam threw a log on the fire causing sparks to fly in the air.
After a short stop at a Gas and Sip Sam slides back in the Impala, throwing a beef jerky at Dean’s head.  “Road trip with no monsters at the end.  Who would have thought?”
“Well, that’s where I’ll be counting on Cas to heal me?”  He shrugged.  “I’m not too sure.  That part was a little vague.  Like, maybe my soul will be sent somewhere else, but Cas will get me.”
The entity laughed.  “Really, like I couldn’t just ignore you?  Isn’t that what everyone else has always done.  You never really mattered to anyone.  That’s why its always so easy for everyone to walk away from you.  Your mother, your brother, your father, your precious angel.  All of them left you willingly, Dean.  There is nothing for you here.  Just leave.  You’re not important enough to bother me.”
“Because Eileen gets back Wednesday afternoon, and Sam will be busy.”  He shook his head and rolled his eyes again.  “Dude, stop with the pessimism, it’s all good.”
I hope you like it so far.  I will update as soon as I can.
Sam chuckled.  In that moment. He couldn’t have loved her more.
Eileen pulled him to her and wrapped her arms around him and held him.  “Hey, look at me.”  She lifted his chin up to look her in the eyes.  “It will be ok.  We’ll find him.”
I hope you are enjoying so far.  It will most likely be Monday before I can update again due to my work schedule.
“Hello.”  Four pair of eyes looked up from the table to see Jack standing in the door frame.  “How was your vacation?”
Dean slid a cold one over to him and picked up the cards from the previous hand.
“Everyone has a choice.  You know exactly where Dean will be and when he will be there.  I won’t stop you if you insist on interfering.  I’m simply asking that you let Dean make his own choices.  Let him do this for him.  Don’t take his choice away from him.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“No, I’m just gonna sit on my boyfriend’s lap.”  Dean joked and plopped down on Castiel.  “This is cool with you right?”
“We can bring him back.  He doesn’t deserve to be left there.  Jack can bring him back.”
“I know.”   Sam plopped down in the chair next to Jack.  Yeah, he knew the kid was right, but why couldn’t he help?  What was so wrong with him just being there to lend support?
Sam pulled her down and kissed her on the cheek.  “I don’t want normal and I don’t want to lose my brother in some kamikaze side quest to save Cas.”
“…say in front of an angel…. Yeah yeah, blah blah blah.  I heard you the first hundred times you said it.”
Last time Dean rode up to this barn it was with trepidation of the unknowing entity that pulled him from Hell.   Why did it do it?  What did it want?  This time was different.  He felt a new sense of resolve.  A kind of new type of bravery that he’d never known before.  There wasn’t any fear, just freedom.  The freedom to make his own choices, to be his own person. To finally tell the damn truth.  The only thing he was afraid of was failing.
Dean looked down at his watch.  It was already 9 o’clock.  “Now you finish that burger so we can get this show on the road.”
“No, I found a house for us a few miles out of town.  I showed it to my mom and she loves it.  It has a big backyard and a garden.  And that’s where my favor comes in.”  He suddenly looked a little timid.  “I was hoping that you guys would look in on us.  You guys have such a great family with Jody, Donna, the girls.  I would love to meet Garth someday.  I want my mom to have that too.  And me, I want you guys to be a part of my life.”
Dean opens the jerky and bites a piece off.  “Yeah well, you hallucinated a Grand Canyon trip back when you were doing the trials so I figured we should do it for real now that we can.”
“Dean shrugged.  “I don’t know.  I was just looking through some of the old lore books and I came across one that had instructions on how to get into the empty.”
Sam rubbed the bridge of his nose.  “Good to see you, Jack.”  He leaned against the table; arms crossed.  “So, what do we do about my brother, then?  This is supposed to be over, Jack.  He’s never been able to walk away from Cas before.  How are we supposed tell him that he can’t be saved this time?”
Sam interrupted and directed the conversation back to Amara.  He had a plane to catch in a few hours and even if his brother hated his career choice, he didn’t want to leave his brother in danger.  This woman could be anything.  “Look, no offence, you seem pretty decent, but who the hell are you?  You know our story, what’s yours?”
Patience shrugs from the kitchenette. “Yeah, she does that now.”
She increases the oxygen in his intubation and raises the head of his hospital bed. She encourages him to breathe while she describes what she is about to do. The tape around his mouth gets removed, ripping away with a healthy sprinkling of stubble. The pressure in his throat decreases and then increases, and with a deep breath the intubation is withdrawn, coughed through until his mouth is suctioned clean.
Dean cups a hand to Cas’ neck, as they pull apart. He soothes his thumb over Cas’ cheek, thinking,
Castiel gives a sheepish look. “I may have forgotten, during everything that’s going on.”
Most of the photos take place around the bunker. There are board games out in the library; popcorn and drinks in Dean’s movie room.
When Dean reopened his eyes, he found Castiel watching him carefully, his hands placed firmly atop the table. Long fingers. Wide palms. Strong jaw and sharp blue eyes.
Castiel quietly curses again. “Who do we need to contact?”
“Sleep well?” Sam asks, breath puffing past the last gulp.
Back to the night Dean was born.
He can feel the high flush burning his cheeks, though it only makes Cas look more enamoured. Dean clears his throat, looking elsewhere in hopes of collecting himself. Now that the hard part has come he—he still doesn’t know whether he can do it. Whether he can say what… What he needs to...
They march through the parking lot, tossing their trash as they cross by the Biggerson’s. Claire waits for traffic to clear before jaywalking across the intersection, heading for the family diner. Dean lags behind, an ache building in the back of his head.
Dean feels Cas squeeze his hand tighter, the only thing keeping him from jumping across the table and strangling Garth right now.
Alicia makes her greetings as well, extending her hand to Patience. “Hi, I’m Alicia.”
“Take some time off, Dean. Please.” Sam puts on his best puppy-dog eyes, which are still highly effective even through a low framerate feed.
“Shotgun shuts her pie hole,” Dean warns again, swatting Claire’s hand away from the tuner. “So long as I’m driving you’re not picking the tape.”
“Give ‘em to me.” Dean glances over the keysmash paragraph his nap added to the code, and backs out all changes until he is back at square zero again. “They should be on my plate. I’ll handle them.”
With one arm across Dean’s chest, pinning them together, Cas dropped his other hand down to Dean’s cock, thumb swiping the leaking head and sending Dean to shudder. Dean’s blood surged at the touch, and what little leverage he had now was being used to chase the tunnel Cas made of his fist.
“I know,” Castiel says sadly. His brow touches against Dean’s, leaning in fully when Dean doesn’t push him away. “And I don’t blame you. I’m not good at people. I don’t always know what to do. And I’ve been—distant, but that’s not your fault. It’s mine.”
They disperse before Patience heads in—Sam with his laptop to McDonald’s, Claire with her stolen credit cards to the shampoo aisle. Air conditioning blasts inside the main doors, caressing them like a curtain. Dean grabs a cart and hangs a couple rows back from Patience, his sunglasses on, but Patience merely wanders the aisles with half a dozen school kids in tow, the group of them laughing about whatever comments are being made about items on display.
“And it’s safe to be carrying around like that?” Dean asks.
“And you need us because…?” Dean raises plaintive eyebrows, to which Sam slaps his arm, mouth moued and disapproving.
During these conversations Castiel gives everything of himself to Dean, even more than Dean even asks of him. He talks about his parents’ divorce, his mother’s eventual remarrying. The stepbrothers he inherited and the pressures that came growing up with their judgments and expectations clouding his head. And Dean finds himself opening up in return, talking about his parents’ split for the first time in decades—hell, for the first time with anybody who wasn’t there to witness the whole mess happening in real time.
“Yeah, well.” Dean gestured skyward, exposing his face to the onslaught of the storm. “What else would we expect.”
Huh. Dean shakes his head, feeling foolish for not realizing it sooner. “Guess he’s stuck until Coach puts me on second string.”
“Hey, Dean,” his boss begins over the phone line. “Just letting you know that Raph has decided to move Bart onto another project, effective immediately.”
Castiel has thought it out. He will keep it quick. Offer a few short words of apology and praise that hopefully won’t upset Dean. He won’t reveal to Dean how important it is that he believes him, when Castiel says that he is irreplaceable. That mountain can be climbed another day.
Claire comes in sometime later, when the storm shows no sign of slowing and she’s clearly grown sick of research. She folds a leg beneath her and sits up against Cas’ headboard, gaze fixated on the laptop. A couple minutes pass, and then Claire pops Cas’ headphones out from the jack. The low din of a laugh track floods the room.
.” To the women, he clears his throat loudly and shouts his kindest
"So," Dean repeats, tapping away at his keyboard.
Castiel falls silent, planning out his phrasing. “I’ve never spent a day in my life being out, Dean. I don’t even know what it would be like to just be me.”
It’s well after midnight by time Dean gets discharged and sent out front, waiting in his wheelchair in the parking lot while Castiel brings his rental up to the front door. There’s an awkward shuffle as Dean tries to climb into the car under his own power, all while stumbling and swaying, and Castiel tries to help him out without being completely overbearing.
. He should have never, never let him go, should have never let him leave, time and time again—
“Help me,” Cas breathes, fumbling for the zipper.
“Oh,” Castiel says.
The engine whimpers and groans, but it won’t show them its belly.
Dean swallows thickly. His pulse drums in his ears, clouding out everything else. He tries to think, but his mind is a red wall, thrumming and blank.
Dean shifts them into park at the front of the cabin, turns the key.
“What are my options?”
It shouldn’t have been surprising, all things considered. But it happens gradually. Through meetings in either office. The late night outings, and the conversations thereupon.
“Jesus,” Dean murmurs, eyes tracing over the bold letters proclaiming
“What? That you’d invite a pre-heat omega over to enjoy it?” Dean snorted sourly, slamming the utensil drawer. “What the hell, Cas? I thought we were friends.”
The meal carries them through the tail end of the current episode. When the next begins to play, neither Dean nor Cas raises an argument to stop it. Instead, Castiel settles more deeply onto the couch, his knee jostling rhythmically, legs askew in front of him. Dean feels Cas’ nerves as acutely as his own; the need to reassure him comes just as strong as his desire not to needlessly hash over the details of the discovered production bug.
Inwardly, Hank cusses. Leave it to the rookie reporter to put his nose in One of Them’s business. The power station is one of the town’s worst-kept secrets, but still they somehow manage to keep the worst of the rumors at bay.
Jack is different now; up close, Castiel can sense a change of life within him, the thrum and crackle of divine energy skimming beneath his skin. Jack conducts himself in an oddly composed manner; he slowly circles the throne, indifferent to the room and to Castiel himself.
“What the hell?” Dean spits out.
Even Inias manages to sneak away from his current duties for half an hour, showing up unexpectedly around the time Hannah starts slicing up the cake. He gives Castiel a hardy handshake, beaming in his welcoming, Inias way. He also tries hauling Dean from his office, having missed the fact that Miriam and Hannah’s similar attempts have already failed. Dean waves off their suggestions to join under the guise of having too much work to finish before the weekend.
Castiel sighs. “I’m not angry. I’m disappointed.”
Sam eyes him closer, a look that Dean knows always finds too much. Sam smiles then, nudges Dean with his shoulder. “Know I love you no matter how it turns out, okay?”
“Second kid went missing today. Sister to the first.” Dean clears his throat. “Did Sam give you any names?”
Castiel excuses himself from the chorus, stating, “I wish to gather insight from other sources.” With a flap of his wings, he seeks out those humans who have already subverted the construct of heaven once before.
“Not until I’m happy,” Cas tells him, and Dean can see it now, the absence of mirth to Cas’ would-be expression, the way all the lines of Cas’ face seem to draw down like tears. “The Empty won’t take me until I’m at my happiest.” Quietly, he adds, “And we’re a long way from that.”
The first death knell strikes when Anael approaches his office, her morning cup of coffee clutched in hand. She knocks once, then enters without waiting. Dean has hardly had enough time to set up his laptop before she asks, “So what was that about last night? Who’s in trouble?”
“Bess mentioned that you are one of Garth’s ‘freebies’,” Cas says conversationally, his fist jacking.
Seems Cas knows him well enough, too.
and how he could best fit in with the
Patience shakes her head at Dean, the hoodie sliding away from her mouth. “Don’t do it. I’ve already thrown up twice.”
Questions from the board come out as accusations, the meeting playing out as an interrogation of the legacy team. It’s little more than an excuse for Raphael to berate them—to berate Cas, specifically. As he continues to rake Cas over the coals, it becomes obvious that Dean and the rest of the team aren’t needed here, except maybe to bear witness to the humiliations being doled out.
“Mm.” Castiel hums. His gaze finally fixates on Dean. “Would you want to—grab something? There’s a good Vietnamese place nearby. Unless somebody is waiting for you at home.”
Castiel noted the pink sheen to Dean’s cheekbones, a color he couldn’t place solely on their recent exertion. He smiled. “I would like that too.”
Dean glances between the two sides of the boardroom, gaze flickering between Castiel and their CEO, piecing together what his gut knows to be true.
for the guy who was pity-fucking him?
—has come to ask him questions more routine than whether Ricky can find him elk’s liver before the full moon rises.
Cain makes the first move, kissing the crown of his wife’s head before unabashedly loading up his plate. He doesn’t linger in the kitchen for long, opting instead to exit the back door to eat his lunch elsewhere in peace.
The foyer becomes an open atrium-cum-food court, tables thrumming with groups of parents chatting with their teenage children. Faculty must be floating somewhere around them, because the occasional professor gets abruptly pulled aside by such a family cluster; handshakes and introductions are quickly exchanged, followed by questions shouted over the volume of the room.
“Oh.” Impossibly, Castiel’s expression somehow darkens. “I see.”
Castiel turns to Anael. “Seek an intervention with the human. Who among us can help her?”
“Yeah,” Dean said, his face growing warm. He had tried hard not to think too deeply about it, ever since he made the changes. He scratched at his neck, fumbling for ways he might hide his growing shame.
Sam nods tightly, smiling through gritted teeth.
He fires off a text to Sammy, waits the length it takes to get an answer back. To know he’s safe.
“—does so much, and we were thinking of doing something special, y’know? But since he’s usually the one doing the cooking, I’m not sure what we could get, or what’s good enough to—”
Cas sighs softly, glancing aside, guilty, when Dean adds, “I
Dean picks up a brush and a bucket of paint and gets back to warding, Jack following behind him like a wary dog looking for commands.
Dressed in sweats, swaddled by his bathrobe, Dean opened the door to find Cas standing there with a smile and his cooler of supplies. Dean reflexively smiled at the sight of him in his dampened trench coat, his hair faintly rumpled by the rain. “Heya, Cas.”
Sam huffs sharply. “He’s going to Hell, Dean. Shouldn’t we—”
Dean calls the house, talks to the mom long enough to realize she’s exhausted by her second work shift and not up to humoring further calls from snoopy strangers. He also tries calling the people further out in her family tree, phoning in with excuses to get a bead on whether any relative outside of the state remembers having a niece, a granddaughter, a cousin. No one he talks to knows about Abbie, only Libby. The girl could grow up with no idea that her older sister even exists.
Sighing, Dean shuts his laptop. Tosses his cell phone with it to the far side of the bed.
, and Dean’s prostate is singing desperately with each and every thrust.
Jack doesn’t react the way Dean was hoping. His face shuts down, his shoulders hunching in.
“Can’t believe you’re a gardener now.” Sam scoffed, surveying their little patch of rich green amid the blond, grassy field. “Let me see your fingers. Any green thumbs yet?”
“Except they stole children,” Mary reminds them. “They almost killed you and Dean.”
But the edict doesn’t sit right with Castiel, no matter how many times Bart repeats it. Upper management does not check in with the teams on the day to day level; they don’t see the skills shown by legacy’s members. They don’t see Dean, especially.
“Abbie’s still alive so far,” Sam says. “Maybe this thing’s not looking to kill its targets.”
, earning a mixed chorus of laughter and boos, their cups coming up for a second round of drinks. Another pair of voices—Claire and Donna, Donnie suspects—starts yelling for a speech, and then Sam and Mary are jostling Dean forward to where Jody had stood, and the crowd gets quiet once again.
Drawn frowns. “You can’t just call the number I gave you?”
But then Sam appears over Eileen’s shoulder, looking bothered. It would be a funny sight, how perfectly their expressions match each other, if only they weren’t both frowning because of Dean.
Dean gripped tight his dish, his stomach twisting. “You told them about my history though, right? That I don’t—that I don’t want...”
Castiel sucked and licked in manners he had learned from the Sumerians; he gave Dean coquettish looks through his lashes, mimicking the heated stares he had seen one Mesopotamian lover perform on his partner during similar intimacies.
“Most of the missing persons here don’t follow the same pattern as Abbie or Libby,” Sam begrudgingly admits, tossing aside another file. “There’ve been only two records of abductions by a stranger, and only one of those involved a victim in her teens. Everybody in the Lynn sisters’ age range presumably either ran away or were taken by a family member or friend.”
The weather has cleared by the morning, although the roads are still slick with excess rain. Castiel runs out for coffee from a convenience store two blocks south, dodging puddles. He comes back with a bag of oranges and beef jerky, and two cups steaming on a takeaway tray.
The shirt and jacket are stained with dried blood, when he unfolds them, the trench coat likewise pocked with holes from the buckshot. Castiel has to wait for Dean to fish fresh clothes out from the trunk before he’s able to continue dressing. Dean looks resigned when he passes over the shirt, shoving the flannel at him like it’s contaminated. Castiel sits in the car’s back seat and struggles to make the buttons close.
Dean’s gaze is dipped down, fixated on Castiel’s mouth. Castiel can count every lash on his eyes, every freckle on his cheeks.
Not that Dean could—that he ever
Maybe Castiel thinks he’s above following the proper procedures for the team. Or worse, maybe he has senior approval to change these procedures in the first place.
Dean flips through the two stacks of shirts, darting between the matching phrases:
“You weren’t kidding,” Dean muses, “about a pasta night redux.”
Doug grimaces. “Beef, I guess? He usually makes from scratch.”
It’s not a scythe Dean has seen before. Not the old Death’s sickle, pole bent, iron head crooked, snath wood pale. Not Billie’s blade either, rule-straight and deadly elegant, all black steel. This one is stainless steel, its head an angled blade with a hook barely meant for reaping. Reminiscent of an angel blade, except—
“You guys have wedding photos?” Sam asks, suddenly keen. Dean jabs a warning finger his way.
The hood of the Impala bangs shut. Dean drops his flannel onto the gleaming metal, brassy with the sunset. “You’d do that?” Dean asks, coming closer.
Sam sighs. “Yeah, that’s what I wondered. But he’s okay, Dean. He’s stable.”
Dean licks his lips again before diving in, kissing him. Touching their mouths together slightly off-center, his hand tucked into the crook of Castiel’s neck.
Bart provides a cloud folder filled with hyper-polished PowerPoints that describe the benefits of the BEAU project four times over, all without actually saying anything meaningful about the day-to-day impact the project has on its members. Adler provides an even less helpful reply to Dean’s inquiry, advising him to contact Bart for details—like that wouldn’t be the first instinct Dean has while investigating this fresh shitstorm.
The birds seem quieter. The grass, lifeless. The sky grey.
So much for courage. Even small talk seems impossible now.
The afternoon light faded during his call, the bedroom shifting into evening, shadows painted blue and gray. Dean reviews it all without thinking, head slumped against the pillows, legs sprawled out, loose, on the bed ahead of him. He stretches his arms out to either side, hands smoothing ripples from the blankets. Reaching for something he cannot name.
Sam mustn’t catch his displeasure. “Yes.”
Cas sighs, tucking his arms around himself. “The neniven assumed they were helping. The world has moved on, making their original purpose obsolete. So Aini and the others adapted, and took to caring for neglected teens and runaways. They started with the voluntary, then found more through word of mouth.”
“Come with me,” says Castiel, tilting his head toward his office. They cross the floor quickly, garnering looks from Miriam and Inias. Miriam goes so far as to open her mouth, readying a question, but Dean makes a curt hand motion and doesn’t spare another look her way.
Grinning, Donnie leaves him to do just that.
Dean shrugs. “Well, this is... really good. Thank you for bringing it. Uh—before.”
Within the shelterbelt, the farmyard opens into an expanse of green lawn around the back end of the house, split by the curve of a short gravel lane carrying toward the housefront. A dirt plot fills the backyard between the house and lane, teeming with neat rows of corn, peas, and other bushy plants. On the far side of the yard, trees heavy-laden with fruit outstretch in untidy rows toward the distant field.
The thing John used to teach Dean how to hate.
Dean grins at the sight. “Interesting flashlight you got there.”
“Cas,” Dean blurts, pulse rising with proximity. As much as he wants to—as much as
Beside him, the djinn pulls her arm free from Dean’s elbow, and Dean finds himself at a sudden loss, cold and alone in the shadows of the apple trees.
Jody replies, “If you stack your plaid end-to-end we might have enough for a blanket.”
had been gnawing at him only moments before.
Castiel held the knob firmly in hand as he shut the door, though its squeaky hinge gave away his position regardless. He turned slowly toward the bathroom sink, which had a mirror above and a toilet beside it, and all of which was crowded with the daily detritus of Sam and Dean’s toiletry bags. Along the far wall was a combination shower and tub, a pale yellow curtain hanging at the ready. The floor tiling was tidy, its grout clean. The style spoke of better than the usual Winchester motel fare, which Castiel appreciated, considering what he was about to attempt to do.
When he’s done, Dean drifts through his various social media accounts, playing catch-up to other people’s lives, scrolling without really thinking. Belatedly, he realizes it’s past midnight and he’s overdue for sleep.
By time Castiel blinks his eyes awake, Dean has struggled his way through several cabinets, the doors hanging open in his wake. A lone hand sticks out from the blue comforter swaddled tightly around him, the blanket tucked up around Dean’s neck and swooped over his head.
The note mentioned a slow cooker, so back in the kitchen, Dean hunts out the source of the scent urging on his growling stomach. He lifts the lid to the pot and gets hit in the face with a steamy cloud of air spiced with herbs. But more than that… Dean recognizes the smell of this recipe. He’s been receiving a portion of it in a banged-up thermos several times a week.
Predictably, Sam shakes his head in answer. “Don’t worry about it. Just—give him time. He’s been taking your whole… thing—pretty hard.”
Dean shuts his eyes and forces his unsteady feet forward. Sam’s shouting behind him, Claire’s shouting—they’re all yelling something. Then Dean’s ears pop, and their voices give way to a sustained hollow ringing. Dean tips his head up as he runs, to keep afloat amid the sensation of the field rushing up around him, but the blue sky does no better grounding him against the upside-down feeling pouring sweat down his back.
Knitting his eyebrows together, a little perplexed, Dean nods. “Yeah? I mean—I’m like,
Dean’s not really bugged by Sam’s words until he hears a snicker from somewhere nearby. He looks over towards the sound and sees a few people watching them, lips quirked, and suddenly feels a little self conscious and mocked.
Staring him down, Dean watches as Sam’s face hardens. He feels a touch at his wrist and Charlie’s there, pulling him away from his brother’s glare, shaking her head with crystal clear disappointment in her eyes.
Dean’s in the middle of quietly listening to Charlie quiz Kaia on all things her and Claire when he realises he hasn’t really spoken to Cas since he arrived at the bunker. It’s an intrusive thought that Sober Dean had been able to brush over in his mind, but his inhibitions are lowered now, self control a little withered. Sam had gripped Cas the second he set foot inside and hadn’t really given them a chance to say much—not that Dean would’ve, he suspects.
A light but lingering kiss falls against his temple and Dean turns his head to catch Cas’s eye as he pulls away. The smile tugging at his lips manages to be discreet and blinding all the same.
He’s still getting used to these elements of their new dynamic. Dean’s reluctant to call it a relationship—they’ve had a relationship for years, and it’s been nothing like this. Their relationship has been tumultuous and turbulent, and Dean still remembers times when he couldn’t even look Cas square in the face without wanting to punch him. This thing between them now, though, is nothing like that. Dean feels calmer, level headed and more serene than he ever has. Every time he meets Cas’s eye, it’s like a punch to his own gut in the best possible way.
Dean knows it’s a lot easier said than done. There are layers to what happened with Sam—the way he shifted, the things he said, the fact they had an audience. It would be a lot to unpack, but Sam’s willingness to listen would be a start. Dean’s grateful for Cas’ effort.
Like nothing else, Dean wishes he wasn’t so easy to shut up. He wishes it took more than a profound confession to take him aback. He starts to flounder around what to say when Cas speaks up again.
Dean turns over. Cas’ side of the bed is empty and Dean instantly feels sick.
Eileen’s a little late, but it’s nothing too earth-shattering and Sam manages to just about stay on the rails.
“I think it’s safe to say you’ve had enough.” Cas sounds much less affected by their proximity. His words are harsh but his tone of voice doesn’t give much away. Dean doesn’t think he sounds disappointed, though—just tired. He’s glad—it’d sting something awful to have Cas gone for so long, just to come back and think less of him, no matter how deserving he is of going down in Cas’ estimation.
“I,” he starts, unsure of how to put it without sounding crass. Dean takes a moment to wonder when the hell he started worrying about sounding crass. “
The clothes he throws into his duffle bag might not even be clean but he tosses anything in nonetheless; he’s selectively particular about underwear and toiletries, but the bag’s full before he knows it and he’s heading down to the garage on autopilot.
Sam just looks at him blankly. They never talked about how he left things with Cas. Dean’s unsure of what he actually knows. Not that there’s anything too hefty
“Yes. It’s not often you find somebody who completes you like that.”
“If by okay you mean long, boring and fucking backbreaking, then yeah, it was swell,” Dean huffs. “Trapped my damn hand, too.”
So, they aren’t going to talk about the strange moment they had earlier. Dean can work with that.
Expression pained and confused, Cas looks on at him. “The last thing I want to do is forget about last night.” He shakes his head a little and Dean feels an ache he can’t even begin to describe.
Uninflated balloons and folded banners are strewn across the tables, and Dean still can’t really believe this is happening.
He slaps on a smile, fumbling with a balloon. “I’m awesome. Never better.” Dean hasn’t quite reached the point of fully believing his own bullshit yet, but he’s determined. He’ll get there.
Sam get hitched.
Dean hopes for a second that maybe he doesn’t know anything, didn’t overhear a word, that Sam’s just
Miracle circles at their feet a couple of times, looking up. He soon gets onto the fact that there are no hand outs coming his way and moves to curl up underneath the kitchen island.
“Dude,” he sputters with a nervous laugh, alarmed, “don’t...paraphrase. Saying somebody likes a drink isn’t calling them a drunk.”
He sweeps his tongue into Dean’s mouth, and something else entirely takes him over. Dean uses the leverage of his solid grasp on Cas’ hips to careen him into the wall beside his bedroom door, laughing against plush lips when Cas grunts at the impact of his back hitting the brick.
“Are you defending him?”
He looks up and catches Cas’ eye. They’re so close now, and Dean revels in it.
The chairs set up as neatly as possible in the library shift and squeak as people turn to watch her walk through the arch and over towards Sam. For a second, Dean can just about picture this happening in an actual church. They’d probably be shunned for their clothing choices alone, though, even without the more than questionable lifestyle. Sam’s in a white shirt and jeans alongside Eileen in a simple white cotton dress, a better fit for a warm summer’s day rather than a wedding.
; Cas is still out there—alive,
He’d just put all his years to eating out of greasy spoons and vending machines and actually managing to stay upright down to Chuck, so his sheer surprise is nothing if not sincere.
“God, this is so fucking dumb. You aren’t here. You can’t hear me. What the hell am I doing? I’m so used to just saying this crap and thinking you’re on the other end somewhere listening to it, knowing what I need you to know.”
God, Dean’s such a dick and Cas is always so understanding that his chest throbs.
“Dean.” An unmovable annoyance poised at the end of his bed like some kind of giant taunt, Sam doesn’t budge.
“Yeah?”
Sam perks up a little and he looks up. “There’s pretty much
Dean smirks and frowns, baffled. “You were doing that?”
“No, Cas—what isn’t
“Can I call you?” he asks, voice soft. His head’s turned just barely, and Dean looks up at the side of his face, glorious as any part of him, and aches.
Dean turns and watches him back up, giving him a tight nod, and then Sam’s gone, taking Dean’s escape with him once again. There’s no distraction, no impartial third party, no way of glossing over the fact that he’s going to have to talk to Cas about how he’s leaving. Again.
Dean hears how much the phrasing makes it sound as though Cas is back for good. He reminds himself that before he knows it, Cas will probably up and leave again. Theyll have a couple more days together and then Cas will flee back to whatever kind of life he’s cultivating in a place that’s so strange and unfamiliar, yet still manages to be preferable to a life here.
overcrowding at the bunker. He holds on for dear life to the fact that in a couple of days, this’ll all be over and everything back to normal. Business as usual. Tidy.
Dean isn’t fine. He knows there’ll be other nights where he dreams that his world’s falling apart around him and that there’s nothing he can do. He’ll go on double and triple checking the locks before they turn in every night and making sure his gun’s still strapped firmly to the underside of their bed.
Cas groans, pushing at his shoulder. “You don’t think I’ll take that back? I will. Even after all this time.” His face is set with cool sternness, and Dean sees right through it.
He pushes himself up onto an elbow to peer at the digital clock on Cas’s bedside table. 7:43AM. Not too early. Dean feels a little less guilty.
“Well, yeah. I asked when I went up to Iowa to see him,” Sam explains. “I didn’t even think you’d want to do it. Besides, I think we both know that Cas has a little more...propriety and decorum than you.”
Cas pulls away slightly and turns in Dean’s arms. Hands fit snugly on his waist and Cas presses closer again. “Work okay?”
Dean wakes slowly, turned onto his side. For a brief moment, he forgets. It’s just another day waking up with a mild throbbing in his temples and a dry mouth, legs wrapped in sweaty sheets a few days past needing to be washed.
“Well—yeah. It’s been months, we’re safe, we’re alive. Our lives are actually pretty damn normal—I mean, apart from the fact that you’re an ex-angel and the kid who killed God is asleep in the next room.” A rough laugh huffs its way out of him. “What the hell do I have to be afraid of when so many other people have it worse?”
Dean feels the open line to nowhere close. His chest aches and there’s still so much to be said and it just doesn’t feel like the end.
With nothing but an irritated, wry smile and the wave of a tired hand, Dean gestures towards the door. “And you’re done.”
almost gives Dean actual whiplash. He tries not to dwell on the events served up by his subconscious, though, and doesn’t have to force himself even a little to focus on the now.
He breathes in deep, trying to dull the slam of his heart against the wall of his chest. Not seeing any use in fighting it, he slaps on a forced smile and turns to face Cas. “So—you’re leaving.”
finally realised you’re being crazy, huh?
unreliable plastic bags. “Where's Eileen?” he asks.
,” Dean winces, the ache behind his eyes turning into something wicked.
The air’s colder than he remembers as he steps out into the alley outside the bar. His breath clouds in front of him. “Hey. Sorry. Couldn’t hear you inside.”
Dean’s mind is still whirling when he practically chokes out a quiet, “what?”
“What happened?” asks Sam, as if he can’t put it together himself. Asshole.
Dean feels a sick pang of guilt, words from the night before playing back in his mind, and wonders how he’s ever going to reach a point where he can look Sam in the eye and not feel like shit for ruining his wedding.
Sam’s fidgeting like nothing Dean’s ever seen.
know about their goodbye; it had been made up purely of pregnant pauses, words obviously left unsaid and missed looks of longing—nothing Sam hadn’t lived with for the past decade anyway.
“Will he…” Dean stops. Swallows. He’s back in the orchard, cupping Cas’ dirty cheek in his hands. “Will he know which dream we’re in?”
He doesn’t divulge much, but at least it’s more than what Castiel woke up with today.
Ellen chews her cheek. “You can’t get through life—a
“Victor,” the man replies, shaking it. “Justice studies.”
Castiel shakes his head. “A couple years. It was a private school. Catholic. It didn’t last long.”
At that, Castiel slid the tablet across the table, the screen opened to a white page. Dean turned the tablet around, found his profile’s wants and rules neatly typed into a legal document, the bottom of which already held a digital signature on the alpha’s line of the consent.
“So I’ll cancel my account,” Dean answered, wet against Cas’ neck. “I’ll get my phone right now, if you want me to.”
“Does this Donnie guy cook decent burgers?” the blonde asks, not without an air of suspicion.
“Light a fire hazard in the library—”
“This was more than you expected,” Castiel muttered, shifting away. But Dean wrapped his hands around Castiel’s wrist, holding him until Castiel stilled, returning his weight atop Dean.
Dean looks to Jack across the gap, where the creature standing with him has paired its palms to his, a light, airy peal of laughter coming from it. “Meaning?”
Dean shrugged, all false bravado. Despite his growing blush, he managed to casually say, “Sam’s used all our hot water by now. You don’t mind sharing, do you?”
The muscles in Cas’ jaw shift against Dean’s head, forming a smile that sinks straight into Dean’s skull. “The Empty was grateful for my summoning. They would have never reached Billie without my help.” A low chuckle rumbles in Cas’ chest, echoing through Dean’s where they’re bodily bound together. “They cancelled the deal, gave me Billie’s ring before enacting their revenge.”
Dean chuckles, head shaking. He can’t even begin to guess how embarrassed he ought to be right now.
Bart wraps up his gloating, and wanders off to whatever special projects team is putting up with him these days. Dean looks around the meeting room, but Castiel must have already headed back downstairs.
with most of his colleagues, knowing enough about them that he could answer whether they have kids or what they said they did that weekend. But with Cas, he knows so much more—what kind of books he likes reading, what TV shows he prefers to watch. Where he grew up and who his friends were as a kid, and what kind of aspirations drove him to being the person he is today.
“A high priority, clearly,” Cas grumbles.
Adler calls Dean’s office shortly before lunch time, breaking the news Dean already suspected was coming.
Copper floods his throat and Dean chokes, shouting through the spray a noise that sounds like “
Castiel must have deleted his history with both of them. Which is strange; normally, Castiel likes hoarding every message given or received.
“It did—it does. But, Dean—at the time, the Empty claimed dominion over Jack’s soul. In order to revive him, I needed to—” Cas sighs, at a loss for how to continue.
Castiel hums, a bright sound that sinks into Dean’s skin. “I’ve missed you. And a lot of other things, it seems. Congratulations.”
“What about…?” Dean begins slowly, but Cas doesn’t allow the thought to finish, cupping his hands around Dean’s face and reeling him in for another kiss.
Castiel cannot stand to see Dean crying. He approaches quietly, kneeling down. He sets a hand to the back of Dean’s head and kisses the row of his knuckles.
“I handled it,” Castiel says calmly, sipping from his mug.
How Cas stopping him had made Dean think maybe Cas didn’t feel the same way.
Cas hums, kissing again at Dean’s shoulder. His hands rub soothing circles above Dean’s hips. “Feeling up for the game tonight?”
As he returns to the kitchen, Cain drops a heavy hand on Dean’s shoulder, patting him. Dean feels his body ignite at the spot.
Dean opts to stay in the kitchen and pulls out a chair along the breakfast bar, where the baskets are within arm’s reach and he can keep picking through them, seeking out the note cards in the get-well flowers. The rest are from his old co-workers, scattered between the help desk and QA. One bouquet of red gerberas and purple asters is addressed to Castiel instead of him.
“I don’t like when you call me your brother,” Castiel said quietly.
“I’ve been trying to look into it,” Sam answers, “but the cameras came first.”
Castiel wants to chase him for more answers, but Dean merely pushes him into his room, shutting off the light while muttering a half-hearted “Goodnight”.
Dean melts beneath the ministrations, feeling looser, more relaxed. He murmurs into his cup, “Thanks, Mom.”
Pamela wanders over with a beer in hand, her free hand skirting over table tops until she finds the couch. She flops down on the cushion beside Castiel, landing uncomfortably close. “He’s right,” she says, flattening her hand on Castiel’s chest. “Take right now. You don’t like me touching you like this, do you?”
Fever. Seizures. Chills.
Besides, it didn’t hurt if Dean’s assumptions were off, and Cas was early by a day. It wasn’t like Dean minded his company.
Sam mimed zipping his lips, then collected the green five-gallon pail Dean had purloined for this very purpose. Cas was already miles ahead of them, having dug up the first three potato hills in each row. His coat and suit jacket were off, hung on the handles of a wheelbarrow. His white shirt was lightly powdered earthy brown and pollen green.
“Got a minute?” Dean grins. “Because it’s been one helluva ride.”
, Dean types into the chat box.
Sam’s hellion years isn’t a topic Dean touches upon lightly. Not when he got too close for comfort to losing the kid for good.
Cas, the asshole, just laughs and kisses the sweat on Dean’s brow. “Do I need to administer pupil tests? How well can you track my fingers?”
He imagines Dean and Sam inside the bunker, and by imagining it Castiel can sense them the same way he can sense the birds and crickets and wildgrass thrumming around his mind, the radiant cacophony of
The company only uses contractors when the work they’re given is temporary. Castiel might not be kept on after the project is done.
Twenty-six kids.
Dean swiveled in place, as if he could just turn around and find Cas standing near. “Yeah, it’s me. Are you okay? You sound like crap.”
Nat nods again gruffly. She watches the siblings scramble into their seats, the sister in front this time, and waits for darling to disappear beyond her line of sight before shuffling back inside.
Rebloggable post is
Castiel hums. “I remember my work semester. I was placed in a class of eighth-graders.” His mouth cracks with a smile. “I was so nervous, I came home every day pale and ready to throw up.”
“Apple,” Castiel says, retrieving a massive pie tin and a knife. “And before you get too excited, it’s store-bought.”
“All good,” Alex whispers again. “I’ll check on him again when he’s awake. Can you drink some water while you’re up?”
With a snap of her fingers, the wreckage of the bunker floats around them, righting itself: stone returning atop stone, tiles walls unbreaking, steel straightening in straight-backed lines. Pages of books flutter open, shelves becoming unburned. The bodies of the fallen disappear in a flash.
Dean flips his hand over without needing to be asked, and Cas slips his fingers through Dean’s fingers. His hand is warm in Dean’s. Comforting. Far better than the embers that have warmed Dean until now.
It turns out to be the right choice.
“Good job,” Cain says, as Dean’s coworkers politely clap at his effort. Dean feels his face flush again with the praise. He shakes his head when Castiel gives him a warm grin and a congratulatory pat on the back.
before crumpling it once again.
Except it isn’t empty, not any more.
Dean’s shoulders loosen, embracing the small mercy Sam offers with the gesture. “Thanks, Sam.”
Dean struggles upright, resting his back against the dresser. Sam does one step better and heaves himself up onto a clothes-riddled armchair, his arms hanging akimbo over the sides.
Adrenaline.
“Help yourself.” The woman gestures to the spread, denoting the sandwich trays as salmon, chicken, and egg salad.
Dean doesn’t have it in him to refuse the gesture. “Sure,” he says weakly. Even if it hardly compares to the kindness Castiel has already shown him, he can force himself to take a couple sips as a measure of good faith.
Then Monday comes, and the groove that work has worn into his mind takes over, pulling Dean back onto the same path he’s built himself the past five years.
“Except we merry devs of legacy,” Miriam deadpans. “Last ones left on the abattoir floor.”
When they’ve danced around it enough, Dean draws a hand over his mouth and asks, point-blank, “Who d’you think took the kid?”
“Your profile,” Cas began, tapping at the screen, and Dean’s pulse quickened. “Can I confirm you made an update to your account’s companion preferences, time-stamped in the last month?”
Miriam rolls her eyes. “God. You’re boring too.”
It turns out that Rebecca lives above a boutique shop that she runs downtown, and when Cas goes to meet her she has absolutely nothing useful to say.
Sam, true to his word, stole the first shower, leaving Dean shivering and dripping on the faded maroon carpet. Beige walls and bleached sheets fit their price range, the only colors in the room stemming from the hot pink comforters and chocolate brown headboards adorning each bed. Dean threw his bags atop the table, stripping his clothes as he winced his way over to the kitchenette sink.
it, too, supposed to have the chance to get out a knife or a gun or
“It’s after dinner, Charles,” Victor groans. “Too late for caffeine.”
“What?” Sam asks.
Amara smiles. “Chuck always counted you out too soon, Castiel. But you distracted him enough for me to take over, so. Thank you for continuing to surprise us.”
Whistles are blown, fights are broken up. Dean tries opening his eyes, but between the blood and the pain, he can see nothing but some stars that are rapidly winking out. He tries shaking it off, tries reaching for his stick, but the most Dean can manage is twitching motions of his hands.
“What happened?” Dean wonders, as he closes back in on Cas.
Castiel’s mouth still twists mournfully. “I hate that I’ve taken your evening with this.”
“Holy fuck,” Dean groans, hands scrabbling instinctively for the thick thighs enveloping him, clawing at the meat of them, trying to force Cas into giving him more of his weight. Cas rolls his hips in a way that is decidedly unholy, Dean’s dick digging uncomfortably into the swell of his jeans, before sitting up, enough space given for the two of them to scramble out of the remainder of their respective clothes.
Dean fumbles behind him, forcing Cas to again lay flush, smothering Dean with his weight. “Worth it.”
Castiel laughs. “I could see it,” he says, although Dean doesn’t believe him. He’s just going along with it to make Dean more comfortable.
“Slow cooker, yeah. Your note said as much.” Dean coughs around a mouthful of crackers. “I’ve been awake maybe 20 minutes. I haven’t eaten shit.”
Dean says, “I never heard anything about it until today.”
Back to the barn where they first met.
“No, we talked about that and we both think it would be wrong to erase her memories.  She wants to remember everything.  I’ve just asked that she, and you guys, never tell me.”  Jack answered simply.  Sam nodded in agreement across the table.  Taking someone’s memories, that was the worst possible thing to do to someone.
Sam and Dean walk into the bunker, the eerie silence meets them at the door like a gust of wind.  This had been their home, the place they’d built with their found family.  A family that’s gone now, as though they’d never been there at all.  Suddenly it didn’t feel like a home at all, just a burnt-out shell.  Dean threw his bag down on the table and moved into the kitchen.
“Famous last words, my friend.”
Thank you guys for taking the time to read this.  I hope you found it enjoyable.  I have to admit, it was a little difficult considering everything.  It was, in the end, very therapeutic.  Thanks again and feel free to let me know what you think.
“Are you another douche bag angel?”  Dean turned to Cas.  “Cas, is she another douche bag angel?”
“What I said was that he wouldn’t wake up for me.”  He shrugged.  “Maybe he’ll wake up for Dean.  It’s worth a shot.”
“Yeah, he doesn’t belong there.  After everything, I just can’t let him stay there.”  He shrugged and tried to get back to his burger.
It’s inwardly humiliating how taken aback he is. Dean isn’t sure whether it’s because he’d been completely expecting this to be his responsibility—the one thing he could really do for Sam on one of the most important days of his life—or if the mere mention of Cas is to blame.
Warm air prickles his skin in contrast to the cold November night he’s just stepped in from, and Dean takes a moment to appreciate Cas’ complete disregard for their energy bill.
The sight of Castiel’s eyes boring into him is seared into his brain, though, as well as the sight of him curled up on the floor with his blood pooling and congealing around him as he rotted and bled out.
Dean’s powerless to resist, but he isn’t all that surprised. “Yeah, Cas. You can call me.”
Cas knits his brows together and tilts his head. “It is? Why?”
traditional about this whole thing, but she wanted
He notices how Cas is blushing. Dean doesn’t know whether the flush is from exertion or the scrutiny of his stare, but he knows that he’ll be damned if he doesn’t get to feel the warmth of that burning skin under his hands and mouth because he’s intimidated by a creaking hinge.
Dean still sees him walking away from him in nauseating, anxiety inducing nightmares. He often wakes up with a pathetic lump in his throat, still feels the loss like a fresh, open wound across his chest. Except that it isn’t even really a
His stunned glee had shifted into something else entirely, and Dean had spent the following hour feeling as though he’d been punched in the stomach.
He looks exasperated, “no, Dean. I mean—Cas actually wants to build a life with you and you’re sulking because he doesn’t wanna do it on your terms? Come on, man.”
The reply comes back almost immediately with the name of an apartment building in a part of Iowa Dean’s never heard of, and he gulps.
“Heh. Well, no such luck. God, I can’t believe you. Good talk, Cas. Fuckin’ awesome.”
Dean does count himself a fortunate son of a bitch in the end, though. He feels the warmth of his luck bloom in his chest and his heartbeat picks up when he turns his head and sees those all-familiar tufts of warm brown hair smothering the pillow next to his.
It’s been hours since they took Chuck’s legs out from under him, since they averted certain doom and to Dean, the shit that happened along the way has never felt more worth it.
With a heavy sigh, Sam lets the conversation die.
“Okay.” Cas lets it go. “In any case, I think he’d value your forgiveness.”
He’s scrambling to get away as he feels something starting to crack inside of him—maybe it’s the prospect of actually having to talk about their shit, maybe it’s having to deal with Cas leaving
Cas smiles, and Dean swears there’s a tinge of sadness to it. “You’re not at fault for everything, Dean. I wish above all other things that I could make you see that.”
Before he can stop himself, Dean turns around abruptly and stills. “What?!” he snaps. “What else is there for you to say?”
, three-quarters cut would probably be a little more accurate. He was at least half cut well before anything was in full swing.
There are still eyes on them, people watching like they’re anticipating some sort of blow out, and Dean tries his best not to feel a little cornered. He’s never liked too much attention. Eileen’s friend mumbles an unbothered ‘whatever’ and appears uninterested as he looks away.
Predictably, Dean says nothing, but his heart keeps thudding faster against the wall of his chest because Cas is still following him, not giving up,
“He’ll live. He’s got guts of steel like his dad,” Dean reaches down to ruffle Miracle’s fur, “right, buddy?”
. Now can we talk about something else or do I actually need to kick you out of here?”
“Jack’s up,” Dean smiles, dragging a hand down his face languidly.
A quivering but ultimately calming breath smooths its way out of Dean as he looks on at Cas sleeping, serene and unassuming. Alive. He sees dark eyelashes fanned out over fair skin, admires the way they flutter against the new light. Realising that Cas is stirring awake, Dean can’t help but feel bad.
Dean gives him a once-over; he registers the plain t-shirt he’s wearing, along with a pair of plaid pyjama pants that Cas has probably forgotten once belonged to Dean. Dean feels supremely overdressed in the same half-unbuttoned shirt and jeans he’d fallen asleep in hours before.
to muster up.
“Goodbye.”
Dean’s always been good at finding silver linings, though, and it doesn’t take long for him to start deliberating for the following day on what time it’s generally acceptable to start drinking when you have guests over. Not that it matters all that much; he doesn’t have any responsibilities or a speech to ramble through, so he figures any time in the a.m. should be good.
Mechanical work’s one of the only things he learned from his dad that wasn’t a means to killing something, and the brief opportunity to relish in the normalcy is the reason he’s always loved the craft of it.
without him. All the while, Dean’s been drowning.
Dean’s dealing; he’s pushing forward and carrying on and trying to ignore the sick feeling in the back of his throat because if he doesn’t he’ll go half insane.
“That is...absurd,” Cas decides, scolding.
The stew is really good. It’s nothing that he’ll be admitting anytime soon, but it reminds him: “the health kick’s gonna have to take a backseat tomorrow, obviously.”
. It’s in that moment that the worst thing happens: it dawns on Dean that he’s never told Cas any different, even though half the time, he’s the only damn person he wants anywhere near him.
“Damn it, Cas,” Dean sags forward and whimpers in a way he’d never admit to. “We could’ve had it, you know? All this time I could never figure out if it was just me—if I was seeing shit that wasn’t there. And then you’re just standing there saying all these things and it’s a damn miracle because I actually kind of believe you and then you’re just gone. You’re gone.
He gulps, “grateful that you—that you loved me. Can’t have been easy. Even for the—what was it you said?—most caring dude you know, I can be a dick.” Shakily, Dean smiles and huffs a laugh. “God, I’m laughing right now but I’m gonna regret that shit for the rest of my life, Cas. If we had the time again, if I could go back—” the door swings open around the corner and Dean hears Sam call out his name.
Cas will do an awesome job, he knows that as well as he knows anything. He’ll recite anything that needs reciting without hiccuping over or laughing at the words or the way they sound coming out of his mouth. Everybody will coo and smile and subsequently gush over the beautiful ceremony that went so well because Dean wasn’t involved enough to fuck it up.
Cas starts to ascend towards the bunker’s door, and Dean watches his retreating back. He tells himself that he’s not memorising all he can—the way Cas moves, the dejected slump of his shoulders, the contours and dips of his face when he turns at the top of the stairs. He tells himself that
Furrowing his eyebrows, confused, Dean stutters, What? Cas—”
Cas’ lips press abruptly against Dean’s. He kisses back but there’s no heat there, very little passion or promise. It just feels like a goodbye. As suspected, Cas drops his hand from Dean’s face not long after pulling away. The compulsion to chase his touch grapples at Dean, but he resists the urge somehow. He backs away from their embrace.
In his time knowing Cas, they’ve shared a plethora of moments. Granted, they’ve been of varying natures—solemn, relieved, irate—but the point stands, he’s been through shit with Cas. This morning had been a world away from anything experienced before though, a moment more vulnerable than Dean had imagined to be possible. The idea of it being encroached on makes him see red more than he cares to admit.
Even dressed as the picture of simplicity, Dean watches the side of Sam’s face as he looks at her like she’s the only person in the world. He puts in extra effort not to look at Cas where he stands between them as their hands join.
Dean brings his hands up and presses the heels of them into his eyes in a feeble attempt to scare off the memory. He knows they fade with time—the many other ways he’s seen Cas die in his dreams are far off enough now that if he distracts himself, the mental images tend to leave him be.
He’s not sure what he expects Sam to say next. His brother’s mirthy chuckle surprises him, to say the least. “You and my brother. Can of worms, huh?”
After a half-assed glance around yields no fruit, he turns to Charlie, about to ask and probably subsequently complain, when she pipes up, “hey, where’s Cas? He’s coming, right?”
“Oh, Dean. Hi.” He smiles, relieved. “How are you feeling?”
Cas looks up and shifts his hands to grasp onto Dean’s, gripping tightly. He meets Dean’s eye as he finally glances up, and something in his intense gaze makes Dean feel as though he’s missing the point. He can’t seem to figure out exactly what.
“Hey, Claire’s calling,” he remarks. Sam nods with a small smile.
Dean doesn’t really care to dwell on specifics, though. He’s just seeing red.
Sam finds him sitting at the bar as two beers are set down in front of him, condensation running down the sides of the bottles.
“Dean, what’s going on?”
Cas’ hand wraps into Dean’s hair and he gasps sharply, ducking his head into the crook below Cas’ jaw and breathing hotly. Slender fingers card through the short strands at the back of his head, skating the skin of his neck, and Dean wonders for a fleeting second how he hasn’t died without this.
Castiel watches Dean, now that he is able to do so without upsetting him. He draws his gaze along the crest of Dean’s bowed head. Over his cheek; across his mournful mouth. Down his slumped shoulders, snagging on his folded hands.
“You never gave your preference,” Castiel says. “So I got you both.”
“So—” Dean shakes his head. He can’t stop touching Cas’ arms, can’t stop scrubbing his hands over the fabric of his trench coat. It feels the same—but it’s
Castiel hummed in lieu of a laugh. “Do you want me to leave while you rest?”
“Driving … ?” Donnie guesses, though he’s interrupted by the rapidfire knocking coming from the front entrance. He shuffles in place, torn between the bar and the rattling door, and settles for retreating to the bar for a notepad. “Can I take your number and call you back?”
He revisits the reservoir, observing his past self walk into the water. Observing Dean fish his sodden trench coat from the shoreline, folding it hand over hand, cursing Castiel. He then revisits the next time he died by a reaper’s blade, watching Dean clutching at him, holding his face.
“Dean…”
For their next trial, Castiel summons the entire remaining host to support their second attempt at opening up heaven. Creating something new takes vastly more effort than replicating memories, and so he requires all their strength, their grace, to manifest the nuanced possibilities that this new kingdom hopes to achieve.
“This place suits you,” Dean tells Cas, after, when the final bell warns them the coffee shop is about to close, and they all dress up again for the cold hike back to campus.
It might not be his real birthday, but it’s the best gift Dean’s ever been given. Perfect enough that he doesn’t even startle when the quiet in the kitchen is broken by Jack.
Charlie comes by to thank them, Stevie clutched closely in her arms. Then comes
Dean sighs. “I didn’t… I didn’t want to bring it up again, because it’s done with. I don’t—feel that way. Not anymore.”
Castiel doesn’t seem to notice his internal conflict, thankfully. He turns to his tea mug, thoughtful, as he swirls the doused bag on its string. Dean can see that a cartoon bee has been scribbled onto the side of it, with dots for eyes and a smiley face, peering out beneath a jaunty cowboy hat.
“Honestly?” Sam breathes in, full of purpose. “I think it’s something new.” He leans in, his chair squeaking. “Think about it. An attacker eight feet tall, out in broad daylight. Bending an entire city’s attention away like it’s nothing?” Sam shakes his head. “We’ve been doing this our whole lives and I’ve never read or heard of anything like this.”
Castiel thinks it’s a reasonable question. He knows how long it typically takes Dean to cool off, during the time before his memory loss, but since they’re already fighting his estimates may no longer be accurate. He wants to follow after Dean, to hold him accountable for how he’s been acting, but Sam’s advice keeps Castiel from doing exactly that.
Dean’s ears popped. His eyes slowly adjusted back to the black sky.
“What?” Dean asks. “You just what?”
Dean tolerates the cheek-pinch that comes his way, smiling with his mouth filled with mashed potatoes. Nathaniel sips at his wine glass filled with blood, his lips pursed pointedly in disapproval.
Dean grumbles that a lesson on
“So,” Cas began, one brow raised as he grabbed a second mug. “Which movie are you forcing on me today?”
Dean took them down the service road into the motel parking lot, still searching for something more to say. He wanted to delay the inevitable awkward night barrelling toward them—maybe he could grab them some takeout, or pick up another pack of beer. Cas, however, beat him to the punch.
Hands perched on his hips, Sam sighs, looking out at the lake. “Found it under the mattress when me and Cas tossed our cabin. I’m sharing a bedroom with Cas, by the way,” he adds, mouth garrote-wire thin.
“You sure you don’t want to call him?”
“How?” Sam breathes, glancing around like he might find an answer. But Dean’s gaze is fastened forward, fixated on the dark figure presently looming, back turned, in the war room.
? You think
“Please.” Cas stubbornly avoided Dean’s eye until Sam dropped the key into his open hand, at which point Cas shot Dean a cold glare and climbed out without a further word.
Finally Cas sagged against him. In a thick voice, he dropped a dull question to the tile floor. “Does it get easier. Feeling this…”
Dean finds his arms have moved without his volition, coming to rest on Castiel’s sun-warmed shoulders, forearms curving in a loose hug around his neck. The two of them cling together like that, the weight of Dean’s heartbeat shared where his chest touches Castiel’s.
? If Cas watched that entire kiss and still thinks Dean was into it… Well, maybe there was a reason why it took them over a decade to get together.
“What the…” Dean flips the card over on a flower arrangement and finds a note in Hannah’s handwriting, her loopy cursive proclaiming
It might be for nothing, but there are still some things Dean needs to make right.
Cas would be here in a heartbeat, if only Dean weren’t too cowardly to say what should’ve already been said.
Charlie, looking slantwise at her copy as she accepts the shaky hug Dean gives.
“Mm-hmm.” Castiel digs through his dresser, looking for casual wear that might fit Dean’s narrower hips and taller frame. The pair of gray pyjama pants he finds is a bit ratty, but the dark t-shirt is well-worn and has no holes in it. He drops the folded set onto the foot of the bed, and then returns from the ensuite bathroom with a cool damp cloth in hand. “Change your clothes,” Castiel says, “and then put this on your forehead. It will help.”
“Dean,” Castiel replies, keeping his distance—for them, at least; more than an arm’s reach away.
Castiel runs to the gates of heaven. Glancing around, he hesitates only a moment before stepping through it, exiting into an unremarkable playground somewhere on the Earth. After a moment adjusting to his new bearings, Castiel hones in on the source of the prayer; in a single flap of his wings, he arrives at Dean’s location.
One step forward and he could stomp down on Castiel’s toes.
“Cas, it’s alright.
“Sometime soon? You can come by after you change your clothes.” Castiel’s lips part, a second thought rushing out, impromptu, “But it’s Friday. So if you’d rather go out, or wait until Monday, we can—”
“Our God wills it, so it is possible,” Castiel says, authoritative despite tripping internally on the change in Jack’s name. “We are Heaven, the one realm of endless opportunity. Surely we will find a way.”
Dean never wanted him to go. He never has.
With a quick phone search, Castiel verifies that Dean must be dying, that his persistent refusal to stand upright is a symptom of a terminal disease that is only surfacing now. Typing the rest of Dean’s symptoms into the search bar confirms nothing but his worst fears thrice over. Castiel’s hands start shaking with nerves.
like the book has him entered. And yeah, IT knows. They’re working on it.”
He isn’t heard above the screech of steel on steel.
Castiel looks away from the second storey of the cabin. He turns to where Dean is waiting for him in the dining room.
Dean drops the phone to his shoulder and stares up at the bathroom skylight, his head banging against the wooden vanity behind him. A gift basket of lotions and bath salts sits picked-through beside him; he sniffs a bottle of lavender face scrub before wincing and setting it aside. “Jack squat. The whole day’s been scheduled down to the half-hour with couples-building exercises. I can’t even hold the EMF reader without somebody coming over to play these stupid introduction games.”
Cas switches hands on his scythe, holding up his right hand. Showing a white ring resting on his finger. “There was a power vacuum. I volunteered to fill it.”
“What?” Dean asks, at the same time as Cas, sighing, says, “Don’t start on the candles. It’s a very touchy subject.”
Castiel will approach him instead of waiting for the chance to ambush him. Even if it’s more terrifying, Castiel can take the first step toward making amends.
“I’d rather talk about this in person. If I text you my address, will you come by?”
The door bangs shut behind him. Outside, he finds a small enclosed porch with a swing bench and a couple muskoka chairs, a small round table wobbling on the floorboards between them. Cain leans with his back toward them, arms braced against the porch rails, a chicken sandwich hanging from his hand, half-eaten.
A call comes in late one Thursday evening, hours after Dean has left the office. He’s sprawled out on the couch, watching old reruns of a guilty-pleasure medical drama off a streaming site. It takes him a moment to place the noise of his cell phone. He isn’t expecting a phone call from Sam tonight.
The speakers suddenly screech overhead, and MC Joyce’s voice beams out an announcement about the morning classes, stating they have fifteen minutes to get to their allotted locations. Sam and Cas both pull out matching schedules. Dean frowns over Cas’s shoulder and sees a half-dozen options available for each time slot throughout the day.
“I know.” Cas’ mouth curves warmly. “I just like hearing you laugh.”
“You too,” Castiel murmurs. He leans across the bench seat, catching Dean’s cheek in a kiss.
“Will you be okay here alone?” Castiel asks, scribbling a note for Dean before gathering his laptop bag. But Dean is already back in bed, asleep. Castiel can’t even be sure when Dean drifted off again.
“Please,” Dean panted again, but Cas’ pace remained frustratingly slow. He dragged his fingers through the mess Dean has made of himself, the touch reigniting the fire Dean felt inside.
as Cas’ lips part. He draws back as if uncertain. Dean nudges back in and kisses him again.
“Be careful how loudly you say that,” Anael says airily. “Good luck,” she adds, as she departs for her cubicle, her coffee cup in hand.
He can’t think about that just now.
The sauce simmered, the pan slanted sideways on its burner. Dean unfroze himself and dug a stirring spoon out from a drawer. He scraped it around the pan, fishing out the blotches that had been burned.
The porch door creaks open, a beam of buttery light cutting out from the kitchen. Dean finds Cas approaching through the dark, his grace bottle glowing in the crook of his arm.
The boy rolls down the window instead of opening the door, his expression carrying an air of sibling smugness, and the girl wags her finger at him like he’s just backed out of a deal. Nat’s gaze roves over to the short-haired driver, who shouts something at both of them over the roof of the car, looking like he’s scolding infants for slapping darling’s glass. Whatever he says, it brings the siblings back onside with each other. The boy rolls his eyes, and with an exaggerated flare he climbs out from the passenger side, following his sister’s lead toward the store.
Is the impossible finally happening, and Castiel is actually catching on? For once, Dean doesn’t hesitate to offer a reply.
Dean has spent his time pretending like the empty days aren’t eating through him, that the work and the people around him are enough to fill the Cas-shaped hole bleeding in his chest. Not that he’s ungrateful. He knows he lucked out, just this once, in finding a best friend in Cas. He just wishes his luck had stretched a little further, come in a little stronger. That all those years of tiptoeing around his feelings for Cas had amounted to something in the end.
“Oh. Yes, I’m fine.”
? You’re the one who hasn’t been answering my texts—”
“Over there,” Charlie says, pointing to a strip mall a block down from the campus. This far out from the main gathering, the air is quiet, the snow crisp underfoot.
Dean’s phone buzzes moments after entering his workplace, but he doesn’t check its notifications until he’s situated in his office, laptop plugged in, the VPN up and running, connecting him to his work desktop.
They sound angry about something.
“So your brother is…?” Dean begins.
Dean snorts. “It’s okay, bud. I get it. You got the job and I didn’t, but that doesn’t mean I can’t handle my own shit or that I’m not a damn good employee. Just leave me to do my thing and you do yours, and when the dust has settled you can phase me out to a different team like you clearly seem to want to.”
Interrogative.
He’s in his off-duty wear, decked out in denim and plaid, his position betrayed only by the coiled swagger that comes from having a concealed weapon somewhere on his body. Arrived at the shop on his own, too, no partner in sight. His presence staggers Ricky for a moment, just long enough that he wonders whether this’ll be the time the agent—
Dean waves behind them, back the way they came. “Is it just here? This… whatever it is?”
“It’s good, right?” Sam says. “You’re starting to remember.”
“I mean it,” Castiel says. “If I could do things over…”
A sharp gasp ghosts Dean’s cheek and Cas then crumbles, the breath rushing out of him as he lands heavily atop Dean. Dean snakes a hand between them, and with a few rough tugs he finishes, come splashing beside Cas’ across the belly of his shirt.
“It is his dream,” the djinn replies, cryptic, appearing between one breath and the next beside him.
(See the end of the chapter for
Castiel grips at Dean’s waist; touches at the base of Dean’s throat. He feels Dean’s pulse pounding, the flutter of his skin as his jaw moves, pressing without hesitation until Castiel gasps, overwhelmed by the sensation.
Dean stares down at his phone, the screen coming to life with the press of a button. His fingers twitch for a familiar contact, and without really intending to Dean finds himself checking again for messages from Cas.
Castiel takes up the thin wooden stick he likes to use for drawing, toying with it between both hands. “You asked me to help you escape the Empty. I kept my promise. That’s it.”
The radio silences. The wipers still.
What kind of mixed message garbage was this? Dean answered, with caution, “Okay…”
In the post-haze of incredible sex, Dean was too ratcheted up to bear the quiet. “What’re you thinking about?”
Not that Castiel has been avidly watching. Of course not. But for hours his door has remained shut, the light yet visible through its shuttered blinds, and Castiel cannot wait any longer for him to come out; his stomach rumbles ravenously, anticipating supper, and his back complains of a long day spent sitting at his crowded desk.
“I’ll see you again,” Castiel vows, touching Dean’s face.
Adler thanks him as well, and with it hangs up on the worst news Dean has received in his career.
After a moment of consideration, Castiel says carefully, “I can bring it to Raph. But I’d like to see a work estimate for the phase three items first, both dev and QA. If it looks manageable, it will be easier to sway him and Dumah’s SA to our side.”
“Jesus, Cas—”
Dean looks at him, shrewd. “No cake.”
Dean gets fitted with a rigid brace, gets lifted onto a stretcher.
Finally, he’s had enough of the awkward silence. Smearing at his mouth with the back of his hand, Dean gets up, walks past Cas, and pulls open his door. With his other hand, he gestures broadly for Cas to leave.
a mistake he made?
Jack looks pale and shaken, his arms trembling with exhaustion. But he reaches for angels and demons alike, planting his palms firmly on whatever is closest to him, his victims wailing, gnashing, as he draws the lifeforce from their bodies.
“This job?” Castiel chuckles humorlessly, punching the elevator button for the parkade. “I’m only here because Michael grew tired of the complaints about me at my last job.”
Maggie laughs, and squirts the dregs of her water bottle directly onto her face.
“Um,” Ryan begins, “I’ve made flatbread before, if that counts?”
It’s too gentle on him; Dean has to look away. “It’s—fine. Really. Just think about it. Who’d’ve made the cake—Jack?
.) Eileen is equally encouraging, albeit more understanding of Dean’s travel apprehensions. (
though,” Dean said, moving his hand the way he’d seen Cas do it. “You said they used it as an excuse, but what is it?”
Sam huffs. “Cas released his grace, and Max stored it away for safekeeping. It’s all we can do for now. He’s healing, Dean. It just takes time.”
Dean and Sam beat him back to the motel, heading straight for the girls’ room. The instant they open the door, Dean’s knees start quaking with a tremor that he recognizes, just not in this place. Sam steps ahead, his breath coming quickly. He wipes his brow and nods to Dean, confirming that he’s struck by the same sensation as well.
Dean falls into place beside his brother, watching with Sam for a beat as the others swarm each other in lazy circles. Sam looks like he’s enjoying the sun and the breeze, his sleeves rolled up and his hair pushed back.
, Dean replies back,
Cas idly agreed, “Sure, sure,” and set down two steaming cups on the coffee table. He unfolded the blanket Dean left perched on the armrest and draped it across the both of them. He then settled in beside Dean, snuggling closer than just friends would allow.
“I kinda held you accountable,” Dean continues, pausing. “For Mom. At the time. For what Jack did to her.”
“Oh. Well, stay safe then.” A beat of static hits the air.
“Would you like us to increase the background ambience of calm and forgetfulness? We could do that, if you like. Make your mind wander away from those thoughts that are painful,” says Anael, and if it weren’t for the knowledge of what she is doing by bringing it to attention, Castiel would have pulled her aside for a clipped conversation about boundaries on the subject.
Castiel hates the sorrow in Jack’s voice almost as much as he hates what is happening to Dean, down on earth—Dean’s fear and his sorrow so palpably bright, Castiel feels it like a sunburn singeing his skin.
“Thanks,” Dean says absently, shrugging off the compliment, wiping the sweat from his brow with the back of his hand. He leans back against the wood fence beside Castiel, waiting for their next turn to throw. “Y’know, you’re landing offside because you’re twisting at the hips while you’re throwing.”
Throughout the drive home, Dean’s heart thrums with energy and light, its beats kicking brightly in his chest.
“Son of a bitch,” Dean curses, quietly and repeatedly, as he noses the Impala down a road less used than the 105. Castiel holds onto the seat and the door frame, steadying himself against the ruts jostling them. Raindrops kick like gravel against the roof above his head.
None of it brings him comfort; in fact, it brings the opposite. He doesn’t need to hear any of them talk ever again.
Dean clears his throat, glancing around the room. “I mean no, uh. That won’t work. He’s, uh—he’s not human. It won’t count.”
“Any of them work for you?”
“Is this another concussion test?” When Castiel offers no answer, Dean snaps out, “About three. Why?”
It was exactly what Dean needed, and unfortunately it came exactly when he needed it, too.
“Was Miriam’s update included in the promotion?” Castiel’s voice is tight, octaves higher than it should be. His gravelly tone is unnaturally smoothed out, worry grading it thin.
A lump forms in Castiel’s throat, though he nods through it, putting on his best brave face. “Whatever you want, Dean. You can have it.”
All this effort might still be for nothing. They’re facing down God, after all. Who’s to say Chuck doesn’t just turn them into pink spray the second he grows bored of the fight.
Jealousy throbbed through Castiel, so strong it nearly wrenched them off the road. He regained control long enough to pull them over, slamming the brakes at the first available approach. Fumbling at his seat belt, Castiel clawed himself free and slid across the narrow gap between them, his hand fitting roughly over Dean’s.
A tear leaks out. Dean huffs, shies away. “You wanna give me the kiss of Death?”
A couple muskoka chairs sit empty, since Claire and Kaia decided to double up, but Dean opts to push Cas down into one of them and perch on the armrest beside him, stretching his arm across the backing for balance. The fire is bright, the voices warm, and Cas relaxes the longer Max and Alicia trade increasingly outlandish tales with Claire and Alex, his arm coming up to loosely hang around Dean’s waist.
Soft as the night, Cas says, “Dean, I am so, so sorry. For everything that has happened to our family.”
Hours later, while Claire and Patience are busy summarizing what went missing from their notes, and Sam has reneged on his promise to play buffer and is focusing on the skogsra instead, Dean ends up the only one available to drive Cas out to the perimeter. Dean motions Cas out the door and keeps his mouth shut despite his displeasure at the task, preferring that the girls remain in the dark about the daytime drama currently unfolding. He’s not sure how Claire would take it anyway, knowing that Dean’s miffed the guy who looks like her dad isn’t willing to jump his bones.
Dean slows his chewing as the muscles in his back tense up, ratcheting his spine straighter. He has to remind himself that Castiel talking about work is just the same as any of their fast food outings together. It’s a common subject, and only natural that it would come up.
“So I’m in Hell,” Dean tells Cas that night on his contraband burner. “I’m in Hell, and I’m saying that as someone who has actually been to Hell.”
Claire shrugs. “Won’t know until we find out.” She smacks Cas on the back. “Up to you now, champ.”
Castiel.
His use of finger-quotes makes Castiel laugh softly. “Thank you, Dean. Everyone has promised me you are the go-to guy for the legacy system.”
Dean watches as, one by one, ten hands raise. He crumples up the remains of his breakfast and slowly lifts up his hand. With a pointed look to Cas, Dean sees him raise his hand as well.
Dean hums, leaning in again. “Yeah, s’good.”
as his SA—Dean’s never let himself get so far out of control.
Dean winces. He scuffs a hand through his hair. "Yeah, sorry. But you should know we Winchesters are a hardy lot.” He thumps his chest and grins. “It'll take more than a cold to kill me."
Once inside his apartment, his headache crescendos. Auras shimmer around the clock on his stove top, from the light pollution streaming in from his shuttered windows. His stomach upheaves at his attempts to find food, unwilling to smell even the stale inside of his refrigerator. Dean has no choice but to take another painkiller and swallow a partial sleeve of saltines for supper. He bunkers down in bed, the lights off, and waits for insomnia to crawl in beside the throbbing in his head.
Claire’s eye-roll carries in her voice. “Uh, yeah, that’s what he’s saying.”
“Yeah,” Dean says, though he’s unsure what he’s agreeing to doing. He smiles, flinty and hollow. “Sounds good.”
“And now?” Castiel asks.
Castiel is just a friend. And if Dean thinks hard enough about it, all of his coworkers are friends. There’s nothing special about what Castiel has with him.
“Shut it, Mir.” Inias tetches. “Not all of us spend our weekends drunk attending orgies.”
The pieces of Dean’s heart grind together, crumbling, small. “So this is why you haven’t—why we haven’t…” He squeezes Castiel’s hands, trembling. “This is why you don’t want me. It’s just an office fling.”
?” Dean wheeled around, huffing. “What’s his problem anyway? Is he mad he didn’t get tossed around by some psycho schoolteacher?”
“It’ll be fine,” Ricky tells him, waving idly. “Just stick to that spice ratio, and don’t overcook ‘em.”
Dean scrunches his face up, wincing at the revelation. “Great. Just great.” He walks the front porch steps, takes a position beside where Cas is leaning against the cabin, and looks out at the woods beyond the retreat’s main thoroughfare.
“Kurt,” Hank says baldly. “Son. All you need to know about ‘these Winchesters’ is they’ve earned their peace.” He snaps open a fresh page of his sudoku book, his knuckles running firmly down the crease. “This town knows all they need to know about them. Write this week’s opinion piece on something else.”
Castiel runs his hands over the dashboard, collecting dust beneath his fingers. His nail ticks the flap of the cassette receiver. It stops, seemingly occupied. On a whim, he presses the ‘eject’ key.
“Charlie,” Castiel supplies, looking fondly between Dean and the woman. “She teaches computer science on campus.”
“It’s Patience, she’s texting—hey Max?” Sam swipes away Patience’s messages, then brings the phone to his ear, then stares down at the speakerphone again. “Max, you there?”
Dean catches the small, proud smile Castiel aims down at the conference table.
“I’m sorry,” Dean blurted, ashamed. “I shouldn’t have done that.”
“Maybe,” Dean grits out, though ‘it’ hasn’t been defined. He carries on past her, a tremor building in his thighs. His stomach feels heavy, queasy despite how he hasn’t eaten in hours. Dean shakes out his head, finds his eyes falling out of focus. He tries to concentrate on the motel’s sign but the colors wink out, his vision sparking the reds and blues into shades of gray.
Once he’s satisfied the project structure is coherent in his head, Dean arms up and stalks out of his office, his focus honed blade-sharp on the argument he’s about to spit.
Dean splutters, his face flooding with heat. “Are you kidding? You’ve met Miriam, right?”
Dean has to try. He made this mess, so he ought to clean it up somehow, set things right. But between Cas glaring at him and Cas cuddling up against him, Dean’s uncertain what it is he should say.
Castiel gives a sheepish look. “I may have forgotten, during everything that’s going on.”
Dean needs to get his head down and back in the game.
Worse still, it seemed impossible to determine the nuances of human arousal without firsthand knowledge. Over the centuries of being stationed on earth, Castiel had ample opportunities to observe all forms of fornication. Self-copulation was one of the most frequent methods used, and one that required no further parties than Castiel himself. The mechanics were simple: a hand or tool on genitalia, combined with some form of lubrication, should have been enough.
for Castiel, leaving their options for communication rather slim. So Castiel keeps an eye from afar, trying to keep as much management worries off Dean’s plate. He watches the timesheets being logged, trying to determine how much of Dean’s day is overburdened by too many defects. But Dean’s time entries have been annoyingly spotty, the overtime hours he’s
“Tired,” Cas says, nodding slowly. “Cold. Hungry. The mortal trinity.” He scrubs at his face. “Being human is exhausting.”
Something rustled on the other line. Cas cleared his throat, though the raspiness did not get better. “Dean, what is it? What’s wrong?”
The form of this heaven takes some time to settle. While Ellen is satisfied with summoning a new version of the Roadhouse, Bobby and Pamela’s minds go immediately to their respective homes as their places of comfort. What was one building quickly transforms into three, bunched close like rowhouses before settling out, spreading across a stretch of prairie that could be mistaken for South Dakota as easily as Nebraska.
“Awesome. See you then.” The elevator chimes, and they part ways, waving to each other across the parking garage.
“You’re left-handed?”
Dean looks again to the nightstand, frowning until its glowing bottle comes into focus. “You put his grace in a Coke bottle?”
