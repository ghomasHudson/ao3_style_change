Jarvis, the AI who Pepper had better conversations than with its creator, lowered the music when she entered his workshop. Naturally the prodigy son didn’t notice her arrival, but continued to have his head in the engine of a car.
The plane ride wasn't too long with the Stark tech private jet. Tony slept the whole way there, but the others were just glad they had evidence that he actually slept. Tony of course said nothing about the trip to his dad, not that he would actually care, but everybody appreciated a heads up whenever Tony showed up.
Balancing the tray in her lap she noticed that there was something wrong. She accidently got more than one chocolate cake. She almost got up to call whoever picked the trays up to tell them there was a mix up, when she noticed a piece of paper folded under one of the cakes.
“By the way,” Sam elbowed him. “What you did weeks ago was super cool.” He smiled, he had a very sincere and proud expressions, it reminded Steve of someone. “Tell me your secret, I need to get this buff as well!” Sam laughed, scrunching his eyes.
“Really?” Steve asked, a smile escaping his lips. “Well, then I’m sure you won’t mind another round?” Clint shrugged, though regret started to seep onto his face.
“Just take big breaths and sit down.” Natasha advised Clint and when he looked up from his bent over position, she was long gone.
When Natasha put away the tablet, Clint was looking grumpier than the impatient customer lady. He lent her the letter and when she looked at it, it easily could have been written by a first grader.
“And there’s something even more important!” Sam’s smile turned sheepish. “So as a little special team… we need a name!”
Sam took s big breath and started for the ring when Steve  put a hand on his shoulder to stop him. “If Sam’s too easy let’s see you fight someone your level.” Natasha swooped in and the fake cockiness dropped from Clint’s face. He look mortified as she slid into the ring between the ropes.
Clint stared after her in delight as he watched Natasha try to hide the disgusting chocolate cake behind her back, while keeping up with Agent Maria Hill.
For some reason the traffic jams today were especially bad, Steve made eye contact with a little boy, who was being dragged by his mother, Steve smiled and waved at him. The boy waved back and ducked shyly and cooperated with his mother, walking happily away. Steve giggled and thought about himself, being dragged away to yet another doctors’ appointment.
Pepper asked about using the kitchen after turning Tony down when he offered to get her a pizza as well. The kitchen hadn’t been used since Tony moved here from the Stark mansion in about half a decade. He had no idea if there was any food in the fridge or cupboards for her to make something ‘healthy’ as she said. Or did she bring groceries to make something? That would had meant she wanted to make Tony something healthy and he didn’t want to feel guilty so he ignored the thought.
Rhodey was the last one to exit the car with an eyeroll. There were only a few paparazzi at this event, but they got lucky cause Tony happened to attend. He was giving them his charming side, while the other two stood back and waited.
“Sam. To your room. Now!” she hardened her face and Sam nodded with wide eyes, rushing up the stairs.
Tony leaned in closer to whisper in her ear. "I can tell you everything Howard is talking about a few floors below if you dance with me." he leaned back and wiggled his eyebrows a little. Natasha hoped the guys heard everything.
"You're walking into Stark Tower, the guy who probably has the most enemies on Earth." Fury looked at Sam with a stern gaze. "You always have to be on guard on a mission!"
"We wanted to ease you into the 21st century." Fury added, while Steve kept looking around at the cars, the high tech weapons and the skyscrapers in the distance. "You gonna be okay?"
She had asked Maria if she could accompany Steve to his therapy sometimes, but she hadn’t enough clearance for them to let her. She didn’t even have a real driver license, but she wasn’t so bad to be stopped by authorities.
“Well, then I feel honored.” He said softly, it was a tone she hadn’t heard from him before. His eyes lingered on hers, but then he focused back down at the paper and looked for the pile where it belonged.
Natasha watched him stride off and disappear behind a sliding door. She was good at reading people, that was her job, so when in her life for the first time she was left confused after an interrogation, she felt like... like... This kid from a circus left Natasha Romanoff dumbfounded, this guy who was the simplest to figure out, if you didn't look past it all, but beyond you were left with no clues.
Natasha and Sam had watched the opening speech and now were only wandering around. She told Sam that they should split up and when that reached his mind he made his way to the desserts, keeping his anxiety at bay with food.
“Samuel Wilson, age 17, High School Student.” Jarvis read aloud while Tony poured into his glass of the alcohol. He opened his mouth to ask about what was this weird Shield agent lineup, but he decided against it.
The room he chose to occupy for the night looked like your typical hotel room fancied up with the best view of the city out of the huge windows.  It had two single beds, but Tony had no intention of going to find another room when this did a perfect job at being a room in which he was all alone.
“And we’ll happily help you with that.” Fury squeezed his shoulder, like a proud father. He turned to Clint and Natasha. “This is Agent Romanoff and Agent Barton.” He gestured to them and they both straightened up, Natasha stood up from her chair. They all nodded in acknowledgement.
Steve was speechless, Mrs. Wilson put it nicely to her kids, soldiers equaling heroes, but it was a lot less heroic when Steve started thinking about it. There was nothing magical about it, there were no heroes, just survivors and their dad couldn’t even be one of the lucky ones. Steve swallowed a lump in his throat. He tried to smile at the twins, but failed when he choked on his laugh.
Natasha was reading the news on a tablet while sitting on her bed cross-legged. There were only the usual topics, nothing interesting, but she needed something to occupy herself.
They sat in complete silence, only Clint’s scribbles audible. He was writing slowly, trying to form the letters as neatly as he could.
She wore high heels so he wasn't that much taller and if she saw his shoes right they were a bit elevated as well. It was hard to imagine that this guy made such a bad reputation for himself just in the past few years. She didn't know details, only that he had scandals and was a general troublemaker. His baby face didn't help his case either, but she could see an appeal to him.
“You skipped dinner.” Clint yelled, startling Steve who punched with such force the punching bag went flying.
Although Clint’s words were dripping with sarcasm, Carol’s eyes glinted with mischief and looked around the perimeter. She caught sight of a empty crate and aimed her fist at it. A strike of a ball of light traveled towards the crate and blasted it into pieces milliseconds later.
The man sighed and took Natasha’s hand. She flipped her hand in a swift motion, grabbing onto the man and using her other hand to administer a dose of tranquilizer.
“Cause I wasn’t invited.” Tony shrugged like it was obvious, like the reason didn’t matter. “You said yourself, you had no news from dad. It’s been months! As a responsible son, I should say hi, right?” Pepper sighed of course this was about questioning authority.
She leaned against the counter and kept an eye on the group of business men. She decided to inform the guys about the plan. If they leave the room when the dancing began she'll follow them. She put a finger on her earring.
“These were found not so long ago, these files might be older than me.” She explained, gesturing at the pile. “You just have to sort them by persons working on the projects. That’d be a big help for our later work.”
She moved as lightning, Clint had no time to react, only a prophet could predict those moves. He was easily pinned against a nearby crate with Natasha's arm across his chest keeping him in place. He could study her face from close, but no muscle moved in her face, but her eyes still shot daggers at Clint.
“You could have called.” Tony shrugged, but one of his mischievous little smile was already playing on his lips.
They both shook their heads and waited silently for Tony to elaborate on this spark of idea. “Great, then we’re going!” Tony clapped his hands together.
They sat down in the living room, Mrs. Wilson brought some chocolate and made some tea, while telling Steve about how she needed to do the groceries and the laundry. She had a soothing voice, so Steve didn’t mind, he was also interested in how different people lived now with all the technology.
“I’ll be right there.” Natasha hopped down from the ring and bid goodbye to the guys, tailing Maria wherever she was leading her to.
Natasha could imagine as the gears turning in his head, slowly processing the information thrown at him.  "Yeah..." He huffed out, still looking around with wide eyes. "Yeah... Just... I had a date.." he murmured.
Fury asked them to wait at the door, while he walked inside his office with Captain America. They leaned onto the wall different sides of the door and Natasha tried to read his mind, like she usually did with people when she had nothing else to do. She got tired of the silence and now that they were together outside the quarantine, she might as well try to get to know him a tad better.
Tony draped a hand over her shoulders. "My girlfriend." he answered and Natasha didn't argue, this was a safe way to disguise herself considering the circumstances.
“They’re nice.” Natasha felt a kind of warmth fill her up. “So, you’re part of the team from now I’m guessing?”
The doorbell rang, Mrs. Wilson tensed, she vowed to keep Steve a secret. Panicking, Steve put down the comics on the coffee table. He heard Mrs. Wilson grumble to herself something, but didn’t quite catch it. She opened the door, keeping it from creaking wider to keep Steve hidden.
"Yeah, let's get you some water." she nodded and with a hand on his back she ushered him up the stairs.
Clint Barton was a mission successful, she brought him back to Shield HQ after catching an illegal group who hid in the same circus he was at. With the rest of his colleagues dead or on the run she had no other idea and the pick up group  agreed  to bring the heavily injured teen back as well. She had no idea what he was still doing here though.
Steve wanted to say he hoped so, but Coulson was standing right there and as good of a relationship they had, he still knew Coulson was good at his job. Steve just nodded awkwardly and smiled warmly at the siblings. “Have fun.”
They settled in the living room, Tony sprawled across the couch, reading on his tablet while the TV played in the background. The technology Pepper faced from time to time was at first shocking, because most of Tony’s gadgets hadn’t hit the market, now when she saw a new Stark tech Pepper just pondered how far humanity had come. But of course a tablet seemed minuscule to Jarvis, the first AI technology hidden in Tony Stark’s house which scientists had been trying to achieve for a while now.
“Yes, that’s for the best.” She nodded a Agent Hill and took her leave to go back to the boys, hopefully they were all back where she had left them.
"So no death threats? Just a fun little cocktail party." Sam furrowed his forehead, looking around the room for approval.
Fury strolled in a few minutes later and stole the spot light. "Good morning team. Got up on the wrong side of the bed?" he asked as the screen turned on behind him and the lights dimmed in the room.
The fire had been long put out when the team of four reached their getaway car. Steve was driving them back to Shield Headquarters, Natasha got into the back with Sam and when the car started Clint laughed turning back to search for her gaze.
"In 2019, you've been asleep for more than 70 years."  Natasha walked up beside Fury and faced the captain.
“If you expect me to do something…” she warned without looking up from the cutting board which had vegetables on it that probably popped out from another dimension. Tony got the memo without the sentence even being finished and was about to push himself up when the door open, which made Tony trying to peak at the door in confusion.
Natasha got out of the car and left the boys to change clothes. Steve listened to Clint swear up storms, because he had to change pants as well and why did nobody tell him to already come in jogging pants.
"Sir-" But the guard went silent immediately. Tony looked at him then smiled bright, at least it was somebody he knew.
Tony pulled out his upgraded phone and tapped around, till a picture showed up with the building and three floors were shown pulsating red.
The woman curled her hair and did her makeup accordingly to the 40s fashion. She put on an old blouse and pencil skirt which was laid out for her in a dressing room. While dressing she wondered how did military woman fight in skirts, when it came down to it. She guessed they didn't do much hand to hand combat.
Tony fell back and his head knocked against the wall again, he scratched the bump. Accepting the truth was much harder than he thought. Steve Rogers aka Captain America, the legend alive? In the 21th century?
“No, actually I wondered if I could help you with something.” Natasha asked and the woman was sent deep into her thoughts. Her eyes sparkled up when she found something that needed some organizing.
“Director Fury, tell me something. What do people know of Shield? What is this huge building at the edge of New York?” Steve inquired, tilting his head to the side and narrowing his eyes.
“I heard about Fury’s initiative and thought about introducing a reliable candidate.” She listened, following Agent Hill through a couple of hallways. Natasha figured she was leading her to the training grounds for the newbies underground.
She walked closer to Tony who was helping himself to a drink at the small bar. He walked up to her with two glasses and offered one to her. She took it with a sigh, she was underage, but Tony Stark wouldn't put anything in her drink, she knew that.
She stopped at level 79 and exited the elevator. She looked for the stairs, but every door was locked with a finger print or pass scanner. She connected her watch to the scanner and started running a hacking program, but when it failed she decided to call for Fury, he was probably listening to their coms anyways.
"Nice shot." she told him, changing the topic. "Where'd you learn that?" she asked curiously waiting his answer.
Steve looked at her with support and reassurance while Sam looked ashamed and Clint already started stuffing his face with doritos paying no care to what she just said.
Clint smiled under his nose awkwardly, the easy going expression gone. "I'd say that's not possible for me now." He huffed a laughter and looked her in the eye. "Why aren't you in school?" he asked. "Why are you here?" Putting the emphasis on the 'you' both times. Natasha didn't even flinch at the accusatory voice.
“Her name caught my eye a few months ago and I’ve been keeping a close eye.” Agent Hill handed her a file.
Their sessions were brief, nothing too special, just for Steve to talk about his experience and get comfortable with his situation. He had to arrive and leave without meeting anybody, no contact with strangers. He wasn’t one to question authority, so he enjoyed his restrictions in his own way, happy for the little things.
“Babysitting a super soldier.” Clint interrupted, he was not wrong, but Natasha doubted the captain needed to be reminded of curfew or be put to bed and read a bedtime story.
She walked to the canteen, said nothing to nobody, the only noise following her in the lonely corridors was the tapping of her shoes. She sat down alone to eat or she would had done that a week ago.
The silence was broken when Natasha absentmindedly found a game and decided to try it. She was making a pineapple pizza for an old grumpy lady when Clint sighed heavily and threw his pencil on the desk, slumping back in his chair in defeat.
She caught up with Captain America as he was surrounded by cars, blocking his way to the city. "Calm down, soldier." Nick Fury stood in front of him.
“Hey, tell to the college party’s I’ve been to, this little afternoon tea is nothing!” he explained to Pepper mostly, because Rhodey carried him home enough to know about those.
“I’m surprised you got me out of the closet.” Tony said with a mouth full of pizza. He laid back down on the couch paying no care and putting his legs up on Rhodey’s lap. Pepper liked James they both had an undeniable fondness for Tony that they silently agreed on not to let him know about, his ego was fed well enough.
Natasha lead the way through corridors while Carol talked nonchalantly about aliens and whatnot. She doubted her closer had something normal for the flying girl to wear, so she went straight to Agent Dylon who seemed to always help her whenever she could.
The captain panicked and fled the room through the made up walls, knocking down agents in his way. He started running and Natasha followed him, she got rid of her dress shoes on the way, sprinting as fast as she could to keep up with a super soldier. She couldn't run to her maximum capacity in a pencil skirt so she called on the coms.
"Takeoff denied, I repeat, takeoff denied. Put down the aircraft." Clint panicked as Maria Hill yelled at them through the com. The hangar doors started closing and they already picked up speed, while Natasha tried to slow the plane down as much as she could, because collision was unavoidable at this rate. She turned the plane and crashed one wing, with that blew an engine as well.
He found himself sitting on the floor and leaning against the bed, confused and his brain hurt, logic hurt. “Shield records…” He said again more sloppily.
Clint and Natasha left the room and Clint closed the office’s door after them. They started walking to building B where the sleeping quarters were. Clint had a big, stupid grin on his face.
Clint’s mesmerized face fell to an almost offended one, but he just looked tired of the world by now.  With a groan he left the boxing ring and narrowed his eye at the other guys who were grinning.
"Well, this is a cool place." he shrugged after swallowing the food. She stared at his uniform, at the Shield logo above his heart. This guy did not act or look like he could be an agent. He had a goofy, smiley face and spiky hair.
In hushed voice she checked on Sam from time to time through her earring earpiece. Steve and Clint checked in as well, she was glad she got to come in here, she didn't know if sitting in a car in an alleyway could be any fun. She imagined it to be a lot of awkward silence even with Clint.
“They don’t make these anymore, but the name is still dear to adults and children alike.” Mrs. Wilson explained.
She folded it out and was met with perfectly shaped handwriting. 'Hey, it's been a while. The lady says you're locked up as well. She also said you're still not eating all your food. So, have this shitty cake at least. - Clint'
Nick walked to his chair and sat down, leaning forward on his desk like he was telling them a secret, but he spoke like that no matter what, so that was nothing new for Natasha. He looked the agents up and down, calculating. He decided to lean back in his chair, relaxing. “Years ago,“ he started with his voice raised. “I met a girl just about your age, believe it or not she came from another planet.” He continued the story, while watching the reaction of his audience.
Of course, his nonchalant outside and the elevator stopping at random floors while he kept pushing a button to keep his sanity, made Happy Hogan a tad agitated.
Coulson didn’t mention it to him ever again either and they left Mrs. Wilson in the dark as well. Apparently Steve’s impulses still left him brooding alone. He knew he could trust Mrs. Wilson, but the events still made him feel uneasy. He didn’t know if the Wilson kids had said anything about the matter, but their mom didn’t bring it up.
Steve started speeding up gradually and the two agents had to slack back a little, still at a reasonable pace. After one round Steve was nowhere in their sight running ahead without holding back.
“Captain, you’re too valuable, we want to keep you safe.” Fury explained sincerely, but Steve didn’t let his guard down.
“So, there was a small white dog called, Molly. She knew tricks and she was pretty good.” Natasha silently made notes in her head about the grammar mistakes. “But her friends were better, she trained and tried her best.” She squinted every time a word was less comprehensible.
The captain ran out of the building heading to the city, but marveled at the landscape and stopped, that's when a tranquilizer hit his neck. Natasha looked back at the building to see who could make that shot and saw Clint on the roof with a bow in his hand. The shot was spot on, but the captain pulled it out of his skin easily. He looked a little imbalanced for a second, but with the super soldier healing factor and the lack of liquid actually entering his body, he stayed on his feet.
“How are we sneaking past this guy?” Steve asked nervously, but a hint of excitement in those blue eyes.
“I’ll think about it.” Mrs. Wilson snickered, she looked more comfortable than when they had agents at guard.
They arrived at the Information Branch and headed for the main room. It had the main computer and the smartest people aiding the missions with whatever they can dig up. They usually had a lot of work to do, so they should benefit from some helping hands or at least that was Natasha’s plan.
“The rest will wait outside and will act as backup.” Fury answered. “I think you understand the captain does not have an average appearance to just blend in.”
They stood up as agents rushed the plane, helping them off. "What's happening?" Natasha asked when she was met with a familiar face.
"Don't worry, I've been informed the building is intact, but you should probably leave."  he added and Tony nodded.
Agent Hill waited for her to elaborate, but Natasha didn’t say anymore of her thoughts. “Then I’ll tell Agent Robin to go on with the normal initiation then.” Maria nodded, peeking back at the girl then looking back at Natasha.
Pepper bid him goodbye, after asking if he was sure he didn’t need company. Right now, he only needed Jarvis as his company and the party sandwich he found which was probably out of date.
The family home was endearing and just like Mrs. Wilson had hoped, it really lifted Steve’s spirit. Steve walked up the porch, Maria waiting in the car, observing the perimeter until he entered the house. Steve thought it unnecessary, if nobody actually knew he was actually alive but the director’s decision wasn’t to be questioned.
“Thank you, you really are a hero!” Ashely gave him a hug and then proceeded to hug her retrieved backpack.
“This action benefits the team and makes your work easier, because I can continue to work with Mrs. Wilson.” Steve explained to Fury and the man slowly paced around his desk. Steve was ready for confrontation, just like Natasha had said, he was too important for Shield.
“Hey! Give that back to her!” he looked at the source of the shout and noticed Ashely with older boys around her. He started running straight towards trouble without thinking twice about it. Coulson’s shout after him couldn’t even guilt trip him into stopping.
"Hmm..." Natasha played it off, making Clint's stress levels rise. She noticed the captain getting closer to them. "You're on your own." she mouthed when Steve sat down next to Clint.
“So, what do you do to blow off some steam?” Clint asked. Steve straightened and took a big breath. Clint thought he’d just walk away, but appreciated when he actually tried.
“That’s all I could get to, sir. I’ve used everything form my coding, you’ve given me. I’m not able to get further through the firewall without an update.” Jarvis’ words made sense and he smacked his head against the mattress deliberately.
She feigned calm, she's never failed before and the only thing circulating in her mind was; did Tony Stark tell the truth?
“You remember yesterday I really wanted some gummy worms.” Clint started to ramble. “And in my dream they ate me!!” he exclaimed, he looked quite offended.
The woman shrugged. "I don't know more than you." She parted with a wave and the door locked. Natasha sat down on her bed, she was sick of the monotone days and if not sitting at her desk changes it just slightly, she'll do it.
"What does a business man doing at a science fair?" Natasha asked, she was probably the only who had any idea about the mission. Fury smirked at the nickname.
“Peps!” he exclaimed enthusiastically and walked toward her. His hair was a mess, his face was dirty and he was pretty sweaty as well.
“Yes, probably.” Natasha agreed, walking closer with a hunch to where Clint’s train of thought was heading.
“Stop that.” Happy tried to keep his voice calm, although in the end he sounded like he was scolding a child for taking too much candy.
He turned over the book, he could recognize the aged woman anywhere. She was just as beautiful like when he last saw her. He didn’t know what to feel as the emotions flooded him. The book looked worn and old, so he looked at the release date, 1984.
“But she still wasn’t good enough. She had to say goodbye to her friends. She found a new home.” Natasha finished reading the story and peeked up at Clint who resided to tugging on his sweatpants.
“Oh, come on! Compared to other spoiled rich brats I have a small amount of questionable photos on the internet.” He argued and Pepper just rolled his eyes. Rhodey stalked back to the couch and sat down, when Tony drew back his legs. “Fine! I can live without a beer, mom!” he slumped back into the couch and continued to munch on his pizza.
“Okay, so--” Tony reached for his tablet while trying to chew as fast as he could. “Do you want to cry, laugh or both?” he asked after he swallowed the piece of pizza, searching through a list of movies.
"If Fury keeps us waiting for longer, Sam won't have enough time to get into his tuxedo." Clint teased and swiveled in his chair.
“What do you have planned for the day?” he asked casually walking back to his desk to look at numbers and sketches on the screens.
“Have you eaten?” she asked as a last retort. Tony’s eyes lightened up and he pointed a finger at her like she solved the hardest equation.
“Hey, Mrs. Wilson!” A girl spoke from the doorway.  Steve saw a little of her through the window, trying to see if she was a girl scout or should he worry. The girl left after exchanging words with Mrs. Wilson, but the two smaller figures stayed.
She even got to talk to Helen Cho about her work, the woman had no idea she was a Shield agent so the talk was brief and polite, but Natasha enjoyed it the most.
She failed her mission, getting no information at all. For all she knew Stark could had made world destroying deals and they'd never know. All she could do was play along with Tony Stark, hoping he'll stay true to his words and help her, but here she was with nothing.
Natasha was jogging in place while Clint was coughing up his lungs. Steve ran by them with full speed and Natasha was worried the wind would take Clint’s legs out.
"So, where are we going?" he asked casually, keeping up with her quick strides. She looked at him and furrowed her eyebrows.
"Yes." She nodded and ran to her room, like everybody else. No one went out, nor did anybody came in.
"Let's roll Stark Squad." He exited the vehicle, the unamused looks shared between Pepper and Rhodey unknown to him.
He skimmed through a few of the pages, they made him older, but he still had the same friends. The writers of this really did their research about his relationships. Although on one page he saw ‘Captain America’ flirting with some women, making him look like he was popular and not awkward at all.
"Sue me, but I'm not interested in pop-culture. He wasn't our target, why should I know how he looks like?" she remained calm while answering, trying to shoot down anymore teasing from the blond with her eyes.
Tony stopped at the top of the stairs. "It was nice meeting you, Nat!" he shouted after them with a grin. He saw them join two figures dressed in all black and watched as they disappeared around the corner.
“I need like… the last hour or half an hour.” He instructed his AI assistant and started unscrewing his bottle of whiskey. The video was sped up Tony waited for the moment when his new friend Natasha left the building with that other guy.
Tony heard his father sigh and listened to the steps echoing while he approached. "You could have dropped a message or something, you know."
"What?! Really? She know about this?" he asked, standing from his chair to be at least a little closer to eye level with Fury.
“Not a fast reader?” she asked and he looked up with a menacing look. Natasha raised an eyebrow she didn’t intend it as an insult.
"It's a great cause." He explained, then spread his hands. "I am the brightest kid for the future after all."
“You’re right! I’ll shut up!” he put his hands up in defense and made a motion of zipping his mouth.
Natasha was a few seconds away from leaving him on his own and leaving breakfast only with her coffee. Clint swallowed the piece of bread in his mouth and grinned, his eyes were sparkling. "Check-mate then, cause I ain't leaving either." he stood up with his tray of mostly eaten food. "I'll see you later, agent." He put on his serious tone for the last word and walked off, humming something softly.
“I warned you, just give the bag back and leave the little one alone.” He gestured with a tip of his head toward Ashely and her purple backpack.
"Good try." a voice behind her said. She looked at the intruder immediately. It was the same guy from the bar. He had his hands in his pocket and didn't seem affected by the situation.
Natasha waited as Clint started reading one of the papers or if not reading at least considering the general information on it. He made a comically impressed face. “Yeah, I see why. I couldn’t care less.” He agreed.
"Dude! How can you eat that!" Clint spoke to her for the first time in days, he talked, yes, but never addressed her like that. He stole her food whenever she finished eating without a word, only  a look and when she didn't do anything to stop him, he ate the rest of her portion too. But now he actually addressed her. "That's the most disgusting thing I've ever had!" he explained, she just tilted her head and chewed her bite of cake.
There were lot of people already inside, Tony wasn't famous for being punctual so that was expected. He managed to be fashionably late everywhere he went, by now nobody knew if he was doing it on purpose.
“Would you stand there forever if I wasn’t even here?” Fury asked and neared the captain with a travel cup in his hand.
“There’s no such thing going on.” She wasn’t defensive against the accusation and her voice even had a bit of playful tone to it.
Natasha and Tony jumped apart when they felt the floor shake and heard the explosion. The elevator opened and they were faced with Howard and his men along with Mr. Tudor. Tony smiled at them like nothing happened.
"Good morning." he greeted them politely, Natasha sipped her coffee, while maintaining eye contact with Clint.
“What are you doing here anyway?” Sam asked after his body calmed to a level it could function normally again.
"It slipped my mind." Tony blabbered immediately before Howard could continue his fatherly speech which he was not qualified to do.
But when her door opened it was not Agent Dylon nor her breakfast. It was Nick Fury in full gear towering over her. "Agent Romanoff, I have a mission for you."
"Happy! Hi. We're just going to head in." he pointed in the general direction of the main conference room.
“Agent Hill, the captain is in charge, why don’t you talk to him?” Natasha stood with her hands behind her back.
“I’ve been monitoring the trainees and there are a lot close to your age.” Maria scanned her badge to enter the observing room, from where they could see some of the trainees practicing at the shooting range.
Everybody needed to check in and out, just so the agency knew what they were doing, but with Steve they probably needed special permission.
"I don't know look pretty and mingle." Tony shrugged, then turned to them. "Maybe even dance." He wiggled his eyebrows. "I'll go and say hi to a REALLY good friend of mine." Tony was gone in the sea of people in a blink.
"If that's how you treat her, you don't deserve her!" He hugged the paper close and tried to look as offended as he could.
“Why do you want to sober up? Why don’t you sleep instead?” She asked, then shook her head to forget that thought. “Why are you drunk in the first place?”
“Meh.” Rhodey shrugged, probably not his favorite subject. As far as Pepper knew it wasn’t the military he joined, but some kind of a training that was held by the military. Which he was participating in because his father was someone high ranked. Pepper probably shouldn’t had Tony explaining it with his rambling and no care for anything that was related to his father in any shape or form.
When the door was finally closed, Steve stared back like he could see through it and sense if Maria was gone, but then he heard the engine rumble as the agent drove away. He let himself breathe again, he battled thousands, then why was he nervous from some little lies? He just wanted to experience some normalcy.
“I couldn’t sleep, I thought I’d look around.” She swished her finger around the room. Tony tried to understand how that explains how she was up in the penthouse of Stark Tower, but let it go.
She walked into Tony Stark’s high tech mansion with the best view in Los Angeles, got greeted by an actual AI and braced herself to be deafened, just a day like any other. Her heels clicked as she headed for the basement, saving herself the time searching for him in any other place.
She exchanged a few words with him about the friendlier part of Stark Industries. When she picked up on his micro expressions getting bored she excused herself. The billionaire headed for the group in the corner. What was the point of this event if all the big guys only talked to each other, she wondered.
Natasha felt like after Carol it’s going to be hard to top the standards, if they had any, of the this team of whatever.
“Back at the camp I’d go running.” He answered. “But that machine is not the same.” He pointed at the treadmill.
Tony stopped with a shit eating grin and snapped his fingers as he changed to finger guns. “Have you guys been to an ‘Intellectual Gathering’?” He asked, pumped about his new plan.
“Do you want to watch a movie? I’m pretty sure the theater room’s been cleaned.” Tony explained in-between sips.
"At a loving family." The answer came immediately, probably a lie Clint had told himself during sleepless nights.
Steve gave him a disapproving look and turned toward Sam with an easy smile. Natasha stood up and everybody's attention targeted her. She just started pacing around with nothing better to do, unbothered by the expectant looks.
"Yeah, we should..." he whispered, starting to back away. "But you know you seemed busy with that lock, I should probably leave you alone." he shrugged and Natasha was glad that he will just leave without trouble.
"Agent Romanoff, with me, now!" she ordered and turned around, certain that the girl will follow her. Natasha did just that, keeping her piece of cake in her hand.
“That’s amazing! But…” Sam seemed excited by this mess, it was kind of adorable. “But how?” he furrowed his eyebrows.
“Agent Romanoff, if you aren’t busy.. Can I talk with you for a minute?” Maria Hill stood at the gym door, her expression stern as always and she had her arms crossed as well.
“Come on, I can’t hit a girl!” He tried to gain back his composure looking between Natasha and the two guys, who seemed to be enjoying this a tad too much. She kept her steel expression in place and raised an eyebrow when she finally got Clint’s undivided attention.
“Which one would you like to watch? Floor 32, 33 or 34?” Jarvis asked politely and Tony sat down on the bed with his newly found glass.
"Listen to me, I'm not going to repeat myself. I work alone and only alone." She whispered articulating every word perfectly. She pushed him once more and turned away to grab the bag Clint didn't realise she dropped.
The only information coming up was from ages ago, the information Tony already knew by heart from his Captain America obsessed childhood and his grandfather’s and Peggy’s tales.
“Come on in!” she said cheerfully. She was a really kind looking woman, probably gave the best hugs too. She was a bit plump and wore her hair in a bun with a colorful headband. Her looks presumably helped with her job as well, it was easier to talk to a mother figure, than a stone faced doctor.
“Clint this is Agent Jessie, she’s the head of the Research Department.” Clint nodded at her and Jessie waved.
“But why no other records…” Tony asked himself and crossed his arms, standing up to pace around the room. “Give me something about this mission.” Tony told Jarvis looking out of the windows.
Pepper Potts always got asked about the infamous Tony Stark, ever since she had started working for him, her university friends, her family and if somehow the information got to strangers asked the question as well “What is he really like?” or “How do you bear with him?”.
"It's the main event of the Stark Youth Foundation. It's a kind of a meet up event for talented kids." Fury explained. "So it is strange to see his name on the guest list. We got the impression he might be involved with resources and he's there to meet potential partners rather than play nice with some overrated teenagers."
“Tony you’re underage!” Pepper walked out of the kitchen with her omelette and took a seat in the armchair.
“See, you already proved me wrong.” She said and started reading it. Clint tried his hardest to work like a printer and on top of all he was left handed. There were words crossed out and doodles on the sides.
"I'm not the greatest storyteller, but I hope you're happy with it. Kisses, Clint." He drew a stick figure dog at the end. She let her hands fall to her lap with the letter still in her hold. "This is what you worked on for this long?" she asked playfully.
"But I should be going, you probably don't need somebody with access to everything in this building." he reached the end of the corridor. "I'll be on my way."
He sat on the bed hitting the wall with the back of his head, trying to hack into the deep firewall of Shield. He occasionally stared at the old picture of Captain America to keep him going.
“I’m a fine reader! But have you seen these signatures!! Why can’t we sort these by alphabetical order or something? Why the persons?” the frustration must have built up in him and he just let it out now.
Clint elbowed Steve to look at dogs running by with their owners. “Naat!” Catching her attention as well so he could keep pointing.
“Another person? Can you show me the street view again?” He asked and stood next to the bed occasionally sipping from his drink.
Natasha narrowed her eyes while looking Clint in the eye. Raising a silent question as she raised an eyebrow.
“Mr. Fury.” He took a breath before continuing. “War is something I know. You can always count on me to fight, I’ll happily be your soldier, but I need time to…” he looked around the office. “To adjust.”
The head of security sighed, coughed or even tried an intense staring contest with the back of Tony’s head, but none of it mattered in the end. When Tony reached to push another button Happy swatted his hand away.
“Okay, let’s see what the Shield records have to say about this.” Tony took a sip of his drink, while Jarvis run the programs to break into Shield servers.
He unbuttoned the top buttons on his red shirt first thing after he closed the door. His black jacket landed on one of the beds while he chucked his watch on the other. He did his best to roll up his sleeves although it looked kind of wanky.
When she left the big door the hallway was only occupied by a few random students. The lift was going up though so she looked around to make sure it was safe to follow in the other lift. There were guards at the entrance who could easily see her. To make her life easy, she grabbed her phone from her bag and pretended to call someone.
The footage didn’t just show another person, but two at the corner of the next building. Tony watched as Agent Romanoff and Wilson rushed to the two figures dressed in black, obviously basic Shield attire.
Carol took his hand in a firm grip and they shook on it. “You too, captain.” There was something reminiscent behind Carol’s voice. She looked up at Steve with a lot of respect in her gaze.
“I told you he’s not in the mood.” Clint whispered to Natasha who hung back leaning onto the door frame.
Steve couldn’t help, but smile with him, it was refreshing to be with someone not so emotionally exhausted like most agents. Someone who actually acted his age, Clint was lively, but he had his limits and behind all the sunshine, he had to rest.
Tony felt every beat of his heart as it started to slowly eat away at his whole conscience. He didn’t do anything, therefore there shouldn’t be anything to worry about, his brain concluded without his nerves’ agreement.
Natasha relaxed her muscles and watched him turn on and off several lights or start the air-conditioning in the plane after she sighed. "Barton..." she spoke up.
“Well, I knew you for longer and I thought you’d appreciate another girl on the team.” Maria explained and Natasha hadn’t even thought of being the only female on the team, maybe a fellow girl would be nice to get a taste of normalcy like with Sam.
“What the fuck are you made of, dude?” Sam croaked in between panting and Steve giggled under his breath.
“Okay, let’s not go too fast!” Clint marched up next to Steve. “You can fly, big deal, what else can you do?” He asked crossing his arms in front of his chest.
"Your father wants you up in the penthouse asap." Happy informed him, Tony's face faltered and he rolled his eyes.
“I’m glad.” Fury sat down in his chair and encouraged Steve to take a seat as well. “I’m sorry to hear, you’re finishing your sessions with Mrs. Wilson.” Fury leaned on his desk.
She walked close up to him. "Something bad happened with the elevator and brought me up here and I got a little curious." she talked in a low seductive voice. "We should probably head back to dance." she offered, it was going to be easier to silence this guy if he had his back to her.
“Huh… Even Shield agents have lives beyond that… What about the guy?” He asked Jarvis and the results were displayed on the screen in an instant.
"I was just trying to get the Stark kid off my back and get the information we needed... but I failed. Didn't have enough time to get close enough." Natasha sighed, massaging her temple. She didn't know if she meant getting close to the room or getting close to Tony to get the information, though both were better than nothing, however she trusted her own ears more than a stranger.
He looked around the room full of flower patterns and decorative pillows. There were a lot of family pictures, his gaze gliding over most of them he determined she had three children. He saw a few photos of her husband, but they were not recent ones, Steve made a mental note not to ask, he knew how these things went.
"And just mingle." Fury shrugged casually, to answer the confused looks aimed at him he added. "There will be a lot of influential people attending, we shall get the most out of it."
"Aren't you a little young to be working for the military?" he asked looking her up and down, while taking in his surroundings as well. Natasha's fake smile didn't falter, he was one to speak, as far as she was concerned the captain was taken into Project Rebirth before he hit eighteen.
“Dude, look at this!” he looked for one he had put away already and handed it to Natasha. “Some of these are worse than my handwriting! And that says something.”
“We’re just making sure he feels comfortable, it must be a huge shock to wake up in another century.” Natasha explained.
"Sir, was that an explosion?" she asked, trying to hide her focused mode and act like a scared girl.
They eventually reached the Wilsons’ house. Steve got out of the car and waved goodbye to Maria. He rang the bell once, then when nobody answered he pushed the button again. He wasn’t a technological prodigy, but he was confident in his bell skills.
“I don’t know, I might’ve had a nap a few hours ago.” He rambled and shrugged it off. “But I had a shower!”
They only stopped at the penthouse and she followed him out, he walked around the spacious lounge. She studied all of him, she felt dumb for the first time of her life. She did her homework on Howard, but Tony Stark wasn't on the guest list and she hadn't seen his face that many times to care. But now every single similarity was apparent, the way he talked, the way he expressed himself and the features of his face.
Grabbing Clint’s lower hand, evading whatever he wanted to accomplish, Natasha lowered her body and with a sweep of her leg tripped him over. Clint fell to the ground, a groan escaping him the moment he connected with the floor.
“The fact that that is your biggest accomplishment at a healthy, normal life says a lot about you.” Pepper deadpanned. Tony leaned against his desk, his hip connecting with the glass surface.
With just a gray bathrobe on and his hair sticking up in several directions he headed down to the living room. He tried to sneak around as much as possible, but was met with a “Tony?” soon enough.
Happy looked at the two accompanying him, Tony wasn't sure if he recognized any of them. He stepped back to the registration desk and then gave the three of them a pen and nametags.
Coulson took him to his next session and he hoped he’d meet the twins again, they radiated so much positive energy he could use after being cooped up in the Shield HQ for a week. He got out of the car with a smile which really made him think about how fond he grew of the Wilsons. He was about to enter the fence gate when he heard a yell down the street.
“Or what? Sammy’s gonna fight?!” he mocked laughing with his group of bullies. “Mr. Goody-two-shoes' gonna fight?”
"Sam, I need you to make a distraction at the entrance. Long enough so the elevator leaves this floor." She spoke through her earpiece.
He stumbled upon a file called the ‘Avengers Initiative’. He was intrigued when he saw it was written by Fury and connected to the whole Captain America mess. The initiative to get the young generation training and collecting special individuals to prepare them to save the world.
Tucker had a sweet spot for her, he was one of the agents on the Red Room mission. He was injured in the past year and couldn’t work on the field. She knew he’d be at the gate today.
"Tell me something about your childhood. You know basically everything about me." Clint explained, making the best puppy eyes he could and they were quite effective.
"Let him have it. It at least takes of his mind off that I have high heels on tonight." Pepper nudged him and they snickered.
Steve couldn’t find a reason not to, so he took a seat beside him. Sam decided on watching a cartoon about some colorful world and its hero. He didn’t pay more attention to it though, he didn’t know the story, so he probably wouldn’t understand much.
Natasha had taken a liking to Sam he was determined to become a valuable part of the team, so when she asked him to run one more hour on the treadmill or do one more box routine, he did it with his teeth gritted.
“Sorry to interrupt your little tea party, but if I were you, I’d start heading back, there’ll be someone you’d certainly like to meet.” His voice sounded amused and just a bit playful.
Next day Natasha and Clint accompanied Steve to the Wilsons’ on Sam’s request. Natasha stood in the middle of the cozy living room feeling out of place and there were other feelings circulating in her body that she couldn’t identify.
When Steve knocked on the door, Maria Hill opened the door. Coulson was to Fury’s left and while all of them entered Fury slowly stood up from his chair.
“Not well.” He turned to her at last, his sheepish expression answering her question. “I can read, but you wouldn’t be able to read what I wrote if your life depended on it.” He joked with a tiny sincere smile. They stayed like that looking at each other for who knows how long, but Natasha wished she’d reacted sooner.
“It’s been a crazy night and I want to do this… thing now.” He trailed off, accepting the pill from Pepper who kept her disapproving stare aimed at him.
He found himself looking back at Peggy’s picture, she calmed him down, but also raised questions inside him as well.
Steve got taken to his therapy session by Maria Hill. Shield didn’t want to let him be seen by anybody who could identify him. He was again the big secret, at least he didn’t need to do stupid shows in spandex and pretend everything was fine.
“If you told me I’ll be babysitting Captain fucking America a month ago, I’d told you you’re crazy.” Clint enthused.
“Sam’s a great guy.” Steve tried to smile. Mrs. Wilson snickered while taking a seat in the armchair.
The little team was sitting in a meeting room, by now just silently waiting. Clint was playing with a pen, he's found in the half hour they had been sitting there. Steve seemed to be getting impatient judging by his expression growing more annoyed by the minute. Then there was Sam fidgeting, his leg tapping on the floor and scratching his nails.
Captain America looked torn between past and future, between right and wrong. He had a pained expression, but he didn’t look weak, he looked Fury in the eye with all of his pride.
"Nat, said she had it." Clint shrugged, then thought about it. "Like half an hour ago... But you know, it's gonna be fine." he added after Steve gave him a face which told him that he was only making it worse.
She located Serafin Tudor at the end of the room, near the podium when one of the professors started to give a speech. She looked at Sam who was enjoying himself with other teens his age, so she decided not to panic him.
Clint hesitated, but there was only one way out and that was through Natasha and when he looked at her for help she didn’t look impressed. He sighed and sat down beside Steve. Putting a hand on Steve’s shoulder he smiled awkwardly.
It was already dawning when the screen showed success. He jumped up on the bed, forgetting he was exhausted and his head spinning. He sat back down to have a better view. He skimmed over the words on the discovery of Captain America. His mouth fell open gradually as he read the whole thing.
“It’s whatever okay! Just…” He took a deep sigh and cursed his thoughts. “Just you know mom and stuff.” He felt bad lying about his mother, but it got Pepper to loosen up and drop the questioning.
“Who is she and why do you think she’d make a good candidate?” Natasha kept it professional, they can’t have somebody on this ‘weird’ team just because Maria said so.
He looked around the artificial room with furrowed brows. Natasha stepped closer to the bedside, the captain was sitting up and looked at her, awaiting answers. "Maybe you should have some water." she said and took the opportunity to pour some water into a cup at the bedside table. She held it for the captain, but he didn't take it.
“Your handwriting can’t be that neat, like the notes you’ve sent me.” She explained. “And now it makes sense.” Clint was trying to avoid eye contact, so he decided lightly kicking the floor was the most interesting thing in the world. “Agent Dylon wrote those, you would have wrote more, cause you can’t keep your mouth from rambling, but there wasn’t enough time for her to write your whole day down.” She analyzed him, her voice smooth and kind, a smile tugging on her lips.
Natasha stood up hesitantly, it was her room, she couldn't run and hide anywhere private. The small bathroom attached maybe, but that would be too obvious.
Tony was there, of course and probably had been there for the past few days as well. She had learned he was not at all about the pizazz and the glittery, perfect life when nobody was watching. He was more grease and dirt and even more greasy food.
She was right, but then that meant they already knew about Steve’s other encounters without anybody snitching on him. Maybe they didn’t care? Or as long as he was just Steve and not Captain America to an unimportant person it was fine?
His stomach dropped from the pent house to the basement, though, when they stepped into the living room.  Tony felt lightheaded, while he waited for the men to disperse from his father's company. He looked around the room, head held high as the smart looking guys in suits passed him. They weren't worth his eye contact.
“Yes, sir.” Sam was a little confused and unsure of himself, but still trying to keep eye contact with Fury’s one eye.
"Well, Fury has other plans." Clint spoke up after a moment of shock. He hurried up on the craft after Natasha. She looked back at him from the front of the plane.
"Oh, don't worry about that, that doesn't work here. You need a specific wavelength." he twirled his finger in the air.
"You should probably rest and calm down, you've experienced major trauma." She encouraged him to lie down.
Steve complied, but they didn’t talk about secret agents or that Steve wasn’t from around here. They talked about simple things, things Steve should worry about if he was a normal nineteen year old.
Rhodey looked proper with a tie, which Pepper expertly tied. Tony always made sure to compliment him when he was in a suit, but his best friend hated wearing one. 'It didn't feel right.' Pepper on the other hand seemed to enjoy the blue, sparkly dress she got from Tony. Although Tony wanted to put her into something more revealing, after a few smacks on the head they had a compromise.
“Yeah, I’m hungry.” Tony explained. “I think dad has medicine in one of the drawers. Or he should have…” He mumbled the last part to himself while he turned on the coffee maker in the dead of the night.
They were sitting in the limousine Tony had ordered to pick them up. Rhodey made sure to sit somewhere between the buttons and Tony so the music wasn't blasting their heads off. Pepper sat next to Tony and watched as he played with some stupid game on his phone.
“Hold on a minute, what is happening?” Pepper put up a hand to stop Tony from rambling and making quick decisions.
"I didn't know hotties like you came to these events." he flirted casually, his smirk confidently sitting on his face.
The hangar doors closed fully and Shield agents ran to their rescue. Clint and Natasha banged their heads on the back of their seat, both of them earning a minor concussion. They groaned as they came to their senses, undoing their seatbelts.
“You’re right I’m not in the mood.” Steve sat down on a bench and started unwrapping the bandages on his hands.
"Mr. Stark." Happy approached him. Tony swirled around with a charming smile plastered on his face with that underlying mischief that always emitted from a pleased Tony Stark.
“I’m afraid there isn’t any record of her.” Jarvis answered after running a world wide scan for her face.
“Whaat? Naah it was awesome.” He giggled. “You had a dream?” he asked enthusiastically. Natasha breathed in heavily and turned her gaze away from Clint.
"Tony? I didn't know you're attending." Happy looked somewhat suspicious, but he had first hand experience with Tony's shenanigans, so he didn't blame him.
Weeks went by, he trained, occasionally with Natasha and Clint, but Clint left him every time after a while, whining. He listened to the new music while drawing the New York landscape or the new people in his life or Mrs. Wilson’s plants.
“I see.” She smiled sincerely when the bell rang. “Well, I guess our session is over for the day.” She stood up to get the door. Steve got up as well and took a last glance around the living room, looking at the stairs he wondered about Sam. He noticed a head poking out from the top fencing. Upon being noticed Sam disappeared, but Steve’s heart already ached for a friend he might never get to have.
"You  are not going anywhere after what happened tonight." Tony raised an eyebrow, was his father actually worried about him or he was mishearing things?
Natasha shook her head at his silly behavior, but a small smile played on her lips. They continued sorting through the documents. When all the boxes were gone Clint splayed on the floor. The rest of the work was on other agents now.
“I’ve thought about what I could show you.” Mrs. Wilson told him and disappeared into a room. She walked out with some colorful prints in her hands. “They are a bit old, but I guessed you’d have a laugh.” She handed them to Steve and that’s when he realized they were comics.
Natasha sat down in the lonely armchair while Clint and Steve found their place next to Sam. The coffee table was covered in bowls of chips, gummy bears and a whole lot more diabetes.
Sam noticed them standing at the corner, looking oh-so-shady. He just showed a thumbs up that the guys could also see.
“I thought we could watch some movies together here, it’s kinda weird at the facility, so mom got us some snacks.” Sam had the brightest smile sitting on his face.
“Team, this is Carol.” Fury motioned at the blonde girl about their age. “Carol, this is Natasha, Sam, Steve and Clint.” Fury listed off their names in the order they stood beside him.
He smiled at the potted plants on the porch, they had been painted on most likely by a four year olds’ fingers. His smile dropped when he saw a red and blue circle with a star in the middle. It wasn’t any good of an art and the paint was chipped as well, but he couldn’t unsee the shield.
"Yes, it's going to be fine, don't worry." She spoke low, but her tone was like she was having a casual chat with a friend.
She looked up to consider him. He was looking at her, his hands still covering half of his face as he strained the skin. “I don’t know what to write about, so I wrote a tale. It’s about a dog and its friends.”
“Have I mentioned how much I love you?” Tony made a dramatic face, making grabby hands for his food, but before Rhodey gave him the whole box, he took out a piece himself. Tony showed utter betrayal and mouthed “You traitor!”.  But he was happy to dig into his box when he got a hold of it. Tony groaned at the taste of freshly melted, soft cheese, every time he thought he got to taste a bit of heaven on Earth, because he’ll end up in hell either way.
“Who it may concern knows enough. Others? Look it up on the internet, Cap.” Fury leaned back in his chair to get comfortable. “Shield is one of the best alarm system agency in the country, people give us great ratings.” He smiled as he told Steve.
Nick looked at Clint who didn’t make an effort to move, just watched Natasha enter the office. Fury snapped his fingers in Clint’s face. “Come on, hawk-eye, before we grow soggy.” He commented and Clint shook out of his zoning out. Fury clapped a hand on his back after he closed the door.
“Until I have to leave, but whatever Nick wants, I’m sure it’s important, so I’m happy to be here.” Carol stood up and they walked back outside where the boys still stood around while Fury was nowhere to be seen.
“Jarvis get me a pepperoni pizza with extra cheese from the place that can get it to me the fastest.” He explained and reached for his coffee cup, but was disappointed to find it empty. He hurried past Pepper to the coffee machine and mini fridge. He poured the liquids into the machine after checking if it was empty and asked Jarvis to make his order. Fascinating how Tony Stark was even too lazy to push some buttons.
“Jarvis, I have to sober up, I’ll be back.” Tony scampered up from the floor and rushed into a wall after steadying himself. He tripped into the bathroom and let the shower flow over him.
Steve had therapy on every Friday and usually Maria took him or Coulson at rare occasions. He knew the way by heart now and could had gone by himself, but that wasn’t happening anytime soon. He watched the people pass by the car, the playground, they got a red light at almost every time, was packed with kids running around or playing with their phones. The New York suburbs were awesome, but he couldn’t help but wonder if they were going to let him visit Brooklyn.
“Mom, why didn’t you tell me we had a prince in our living room!” the little girl smiled the brightest Steve had ever seen. Mrs. Wilson sighed wearily, this could only happen to her.
When their hour was up Maria called Mrs. Wilson, because Steve wasn’t allowed a phone and told her she had some work to do, before she could pick Steve up. He didn’t get why Shield refused to give him a phone, it’s not like he knew how half of these things worked. Clint looked happy watching dog videos on his, he showed Steve them at lunch sometimes, he could do that too. But it was too easily traceable even with all of Shield’s firewalls somebody could get through.
“You know, I—“ she was interrupted by the door opening. Natasha turned to Nick Fury immediately straightening herself with her hands behind her hand. He stepped aside and she walked in.
"Aye, aye, captain." Clint saluted and sat down next to her his blood pumped with adrenalin. They both strapped themselves in and got mentally ready.
He heard the bell ring and lifted his head looking toward the door than at Pepper over the kitchen counter.
"By the way, could you tell Fury I haven't seen him at last Thanksgiving dinner," Natasha froze for a moment. "Or the one before that, or.. the one before that. Now that I mention it's been a while since he showed up."
“You’re going up in your rooms and you don’t come out till I say so. Got it?” Mrs. Wilson explained to her children.
Clint narrowed his eyes, sensing a catch. But couldn’t think of one. He grinned and when Natasha tilted her head in confusion, he spat in his palm. “Deal.” He extended his hand and was met with Natasha’s judging gaze.
One of the guards rushed to help him and a professor hurried to him as well. The other guard seemed occupied with the sick boy as well. This was her only chance, the guards won't care about a sick boy for too long. So she made her way up with the lift.
“Samuel!” Mrs. Wilson stepped in through the front door with a few bags. “You said you were sick! Why aren’t you in bed?!” she shouted at her son while pointing at the staircase. Sam turned towards her, panicking, no matter the year an angry mother was always the scariest part of the world.
She could almost imagine her long hair, which could had hidden the bird like logo. She remembered cutting it off, watching the strands fall, like getting rid of thousands of problems. She sighed, she expected the mirror to break, because of her ungrateful thoughts. Her face hardened the moment she remembered that's the exact way she shouldn't had ever thought. Her nails almost cut through her skin on her palm, holding back from punching the mirror, from hating herself.
The team headed to Nick Fury’s office, Steve leading and everybody else in tow. They looked like an unstoppable force surging through the corridors.
With a sigh he stood up and walked around the room. “In that time, helping her opened my eyes to something bigger than humanity.” He crossed his arms and looked Captain America in the eyes when he lifted up his head at last.
“Natasha, this is Sam. Sam, Natasha.” Steve introduced them and they nodded at each other, Sam trying to compose himself.
Natasha sat with Clint at breakfast, he was enjoying some waffles, which made Natasha curious about the chef here, while she was eating some eggs and toast. He almost choked when they saw Captain America enter the room. Everybody looked at him, it was no secret they had the lock down because of him and that face was hard to not recognize.
Coulson and he headed back towards the Wilson house and Steve just realized how far he had run. He could feel eyes on his back, but didn’t sweat it. Sam seemed like a friend he’d like, it was a shame it was a very unlikely friendship with Shield breathing down Steve’s neck.
It'd been days since she was stuck in her room, she got food and water, they told her she could request anything like books or games, they weren't locked up in prison. Her days went mostly like what she did every other normal, no lock down day, just in a tiny room. She was sick of basic exercises and wondered if they could install a punching bag in her room. She didn't know how, but if they weren't going to tell her anything, they might as well solve this problem.
She smoothed down her shirt as she looked in the mirror, she looked like she could fit into those World War 2 movies easily. She put on a fake, kind smile, after all she was supposed to look after Captain America, logic dictated whoever did that in the 40s would be honored. She dropped the smile after she was satisfied and walked out to meet Fury and Maria Hill.
“It’s a meeting, my dad has at Stark Industries yearly for a lot of big brains.” He explained briefly, using his hands as always. “Usually for new, upcoming scientists to meet the big dogs.”
“There!” He pointed at the screen. “Stop there. Who’s the girl?” he asked and Jarvis zoomed on her utterly focused face. On the other side the guy with her looked terrified, his eyes were wide and filled with worry.
Steve Rogers stood up, close at the same height as the director. “This is insane, Mr. Fury.” He said matter-of-factly.
Between letting Sam beat up Clint as his personal punching bag and watching Steve use a phone like a grandpa, she forgot about the unsuccessful mission two weeks ago. She spent most of her free time in the shooting range hitting bullseyes.
“So, are we done?” Natasha stopped by the two boys, keeping her breathing under control, but she was just as sweaty as the rest of them.
“You can’t really karate kick somebody through glass, you know.” Clint commented as they approached the gate. Natasha rolled her eyes.
She stood at the end of the bed and waited until the captain was fully self aware. "Mr. Rogers, it's good to see you’re awake, we were beginning to worry." she said her practiced lines.
He got to know another agent at Shield, his name was Coulson and Maria always teased him about his affection toward Captain America. Although Steve told him several times, he was just a kid from Brooklyn, Coulson wanted to help him with whatever he could. He was really caring, but Steve felt weird after he left him bottles of water after his workout. The young man shouldn’t trouble with that, just because Captain America was his childhood hero. After a week he started to calm down and they had a nice conversation about what the 40s were like.
“Of course.” Steve nodded and strapped himself in. Suddenly he felt homesick for a home that didn’t even exist anymore. He wanted to be 9 again running around the streets of Brooklyn and tripping, just to land flat on his face and be pulled up by Bucky, who would laugh at him. Or help his mother cook in their tiny apartment and then eat that miserable soup he messed up so bad.
"Well, yeah. This music sucks." he downed the rest of his wine and in that little time Natasha decided to make her leave.
“Yes, aliens. Power beyond our imagination.” Fury explained. “When we can’t even keep peace on Earth. Shield was always about protecting and trying to battle the inexplicable.” He waited, then looked at the captain from the corner of his eye. “Like Hydra or aliens.” Gesturing to Clint which made the boy happy all over.
The call from Steve’s phone interrupted the chat. He fumbled with it a little first, still not the most used to technology before he answered the call.
“Yeah, I’m just—“ he stopped, before he said he was kind of forbidden to meet people. “Aren’t you supposed to be in school?” he asked, to change the subject.
Natasha's face softened and she smiled, her mouth barely quirking, but it was there. "You really liked the dog, huh?" she motioned with her head to the letter.
They had already informed her briefly about the situation with the frozen super soldier. It was kind of unbelievable to hear the story, how they'd found him still alive in that plane he went on his supposed last mission.
Fury simply shrugged. “The hell I know. Nobody gets a motherfucking reply that’s for sure.” Fury shook his head, dismissing the topic and getting back to what actually mattered. “Let me do my job, captain, if I have further instructions for you I’ll call for you. Now get back to your day, okay?” Fury made it clear, that there was no place for negotiations.
Agent Coulson ushered her down, keeping a protective hand on her back. He was one of the agents getting her out of that hellhole, she knew him well. "We are on lock down, nobody knows more." he informed her while she looked around at the rushing people. "Are you okay enough to get to your room?" he asked and let go of her, she looked around, but lost Clint in the big chaos.
He looked at the sun creeping into view slowly bringing life onto New York. His father should still be sleeping. He remembered the safe room in his father’s office he wasn’t allowed in, but knew what kind of stuff was hidden behind an iron door.
Fury was looking at the sparsely clouded blue sky, Natasha looked up, but she could see nothing other than funnily shaped clouds. What kind of plane were they waiting for? Who was on that plane Fury wanted them to meet?
"Take off, in one..." Natasha started talking on the coms. "Two.." she flicked a switch. "Three." She started the engines and started to take off. The order came one millisecond too short, when the red lights started blaring.
“Look, Prince Charming is here to save the day!” one of the boys said, getting closer to Steve, having the height, but trying to compensate for the beefiness.
“Okay, but why do you need us there?” She continued to ask, but it was probably already too late to change his mind.
Sam Wilson had his headphones on and was jogging from their street. The park wasn’t the closest so he must had been running for a while now.
Natasha was not briefed about the captain asking these questions. She heard Fury on the com hidden in her earring, but she didn't want to alter her attention, afraid Rogers would pick up on it. "Captain, you shouldn't--"
“So, Natasha?” Carol asked while pulling on some combat boots that fit her. “I’ve heard a little of this team, but not a whole lot. How are you holding up with all the testosterone?” Carol smiled mischievously.
"Hey, Nat." Clint whispered, she was taken aback by the nickname but didn't question it. "I've been thinking, should I apologize?" he asked, his tone showing signs of distress.
Clint was sitting at her desk trying to write that letter to Natasha. “This is stupid.” He’d comment occasionally something along the lines, but he didn’t stop.
“Tony, no offense, but you’re the last person, I’d ask for fashion advice.” Pepper lifted her eyebrows and Tony was speechless with a confused frown. “Have you seen yourself?” Pepper looked him up and down in his sweatpants and oversized t-shirt.
“You heard him give it back.” Steve intervened, Sam was a Wilson kid, well mannered, and he didn’t want him to fight.
A dirty blond mess of a head plopped down in front of her. "I love the food here. One would think it'd be worse than prison food." He spoke with his mouth full and a smile on his face. Natasha watched him as he shovelled the food into his mouth, she wondered if they had fed him well.
“Just one moment, sir.” Jarvis answered and ran some codes which Tony programmed so Jarvis can roam freely in Stark Tower if it ever came down to it and now that it had Jarvis pulled up the videos with ease.
"Oooh, Sam's got a girlfrien--" Clint couldn't finish teasing him when Steve slapped his back and he thought he'll die right there.
“We’re stuck here for who knows how long, I might as well teach you how to write like a normal person.” She explained, for some reason she couldn’t get bored with Clint around.
At dinner he told Natasha about the twins to brighten up the mood, she didn’t seem to care that he broke Shield protocols, probably because he had the same bright eyes talking about his new, little friends, like they had when they noticed him. They made him remember his childhood so he told Clint and Natasha about pre-serum Steve and Clint laughed at how clumsy he had been.
"Yaapp." Rhodey agreed. "Wanna look at the science stuff and guess what they do?" He asked offering his arm.
“No offense…” Clint started, testing the waters. “.. but if I wanted to make someone feel comfortable, I’d ask a grandma to let them pet her cats.” He waited a bit for dramatic effect. “Not an assassin who could actually kill you.” He shrugged dramatically.
“What?” Rhodey asked after seconds of silence and Tony looked up like his friends weren’t there a moment earlier. Tony jumped up and the pizza box was long forgotten as it slid from his lap. He walked around the room, Rhodey knew what that meant he was thinking something through.
Tony nodded shakily and clutched the neck of the bottle of whiskey still lying on the cover. However the results didn’t change, not for the second time or the fourth. Tony threw back his head to get a big gulp of the beverage.
"I get it." Tony turned around with the best shit eating grin he could muster up at that moment. "Don't worry I'll at the other half of the country by tomorrow."
The man wasn't leaving his seat, talking with two others. She looked around and spotted Howard Stark Jr. She put on her best smile and approached the billionaire. He was sipping champagne and leaning onto the bar.
She followed him into the elevator, not listening to the questions of her teammates, which Fury didn't answer. She stood beside him while he grinned and put his finger on the print reader and they moved up.
She was standing at the side with Steve watching Sam now actually fighting with Clint who was happy he could finally punch back. Natasha had to admit she undermined Clint’s ability to fight, though he faced Sam who was new to all this.
Steve felt bittersweet about all this as he read a line from this Bucky character and sighed. This wasn’t his life and that wasn’t his best friend, but everybody thought this was their friendship, Steve wondered if some people even forgot he had been a real person.
“You like to not pick up calls.” Pepper argued his solution with firsthand experience, but that didn’t change his knowing expression.
"What happened, your earpiece cut off for some time." Steve asked, at last somebody took the mission seriously, and keeping Clint from saying anything else.
Pepper listened in on the best friends’ banter, while making herself the best vegetable omelette she could the fastest way she could. Rhodey had been trained for Tony’s snark throughout the years and it showed. He knew the best ways to calm him, to rile him up or give him the silent treatment and for Tony Stark that was the biggest punishment. No reaction from somebody? Nothing? He’d go mad without some kind of validation.
“Chill, Fury won’t tell us shit anyways, so if he doesn’t want to keep us on our toes, all of his talk about danger must not be that imminent.” Clint looked around the room for some validation. “ So what are we watching Sam?” He bumped Sam’s shoulder with his fist.
Natasha couldn’t stop herself and let out a chuckle. Clint looked up from the paper with wide eyes and an expression Natasha couldn’t read at all.
"Should have expected Stark Tower having all kinds of security measures." Natasha bit her lip, she stared out of the car at the dark streets.
Carol got some Shield trainee clothes on which, actually, didn’t look all too bad, the grey sweatpants and the loose t-shirt did look comfortable, so the blonde got what she asked for.
Steve noticed before it could happen and caught the fist intended for his face in an iron grip. The puncher looked the most surprised, but every face made by the group entertained Steve.
The summer holiday was starting in a few weeks and the Wilson kids would be home all day every day. Steve worried how long until he won’t be able to go to their house for his talks with Mrs. Wilson. Coulson didn’t tell on him and his bully conflict, which he was thankful for, the last thing he wanted to do was get them both in trouble.
Clint hadn't seen Natasha for two days when he got called into Nick Fury's office. That man was the scariest, after Natasha, but he was the boss, so naturally Clint was a bit nervous going to meet him. He got no response when he knocked, so he opened the door cautiously.
“I’m just going easy on you.” Clint leaned on the edge and tried to look like he had his life together. Steve shook his head, amused.
He looked at the magazines spread on the coffee table to occupy himself. He read the headlines he could see without moving them around. He saw that some celebrity had a baby, two others broke up and there were multiple articles about healthy lifestyle. Between the unfamiliar names, one did catch his eyes. ‘Stark Industries may have found the answer to our problems’ These titles really didn’t like to elaborate on things, but it still reminded him of the past.
“I guess then you’ll have to watch out when you go to bed at night.” Natasha warned him and pushed the button for her floor in the elevator.
Tony watched the guests leave, leaning against the reception desk and playing with a pen in-between his fingers.
"You just have to play your part and let him be in a comfortable environment before we throw the truth bomb at him." Fury spoke up, not taking off his eyes of the screen.
The bell rang again and this time it was Agent Coulson with an awkward, but polite smile. Steve said goodbye to the Wilson family and let out a breath he didn’t know he was holding when he closed the car door.
They ate together every meal of everyday. Clint talked about his dream of tasting every pizza in New York City, he talked about his new sitcom he started watching and every piece of story that occurred to him. Natasha ate in silence, Clint didn't ask. Days went by and she saw no sign of that hidden piece of him, which slipped most minds. They didn't talk or see each other at all any other time.
"It was a last minute kind of thing." Tony answered nonchalantly. He wandered around the spacious room, inspecting everything from chairs to the New York cityscape outside the window.
Natasha smiled while he reenacted the gummy worm attack.  The irony of them walking among secret agents and Clint acting like a child always got to her, it was something she had never experienced.
“The mission has two other registered names Sam Wilson and Clint Barton. Both new to Shield. The mission was about Mr. Serafin Tudor. Information gathering.” Jarvis read the important points while Tony fiddled with the curtains, but gave up on closing them entirely when he couldn’t do it after the second try.
“I had breakfast with Clint and Natasha as always, then worked out.” He smiled softly, he had this tiny bit of a routine now, he was proud of. He really enjoyed the other two’s company, it made everything easier. They didn’t look at him as Captain America, he was beginning to believe himself that he could be just Steve, at least to them. “Then watched a movie with Clint, he started a list of what I should catch up on. I’m accepting recommendations.” He added, his eyes sparkling with enthusiasm.
“Okay, well, you know the rules. No cheating.” Steve started talking, but the opponents didn’t look at him.At that moment Natasha would had gave everything to see inside Clint’s head. “Let’s start then.”
“Do I get a tip for delivering your pizza?” Rhodey shouted and Tony instantly relaxed just from hearing his voice. His best friend entered the room with an easygoing smile and Tony’s pizza.
“Okay, that’s enough for today.” Steve stated and walked up to the boxing ring to flash a smile a proud smile at Sam. “Nice job!” he clapped a hand on his shoulder as he got closer and left the ring.
They walked a few steps when Steve felt a hand on his arm. He stopped and turned, ignoring Coulson’s stressed sigh. It was the eldest son, Sam, was it? “Thanks, for the help.” He smiled, there was a tad confusion written on his face, which Steve couldn’t quite place.
“Somehow being frozen for decades seems almost nothing now.” Steve answered Sam, his own jaw somewhere on the floor also.
“J-jarvis… That’s.. That’s impossible.” Tony stuttered out, climbing onto the bed while looking at the screen. The name read Steve Rogers and next to that was one word that Tony believed to be true: Deceased, 1945.
"Natalie Rushman. I'm here from Evergreen High." She told him like he cared, he probably didn't even know who the foundation invited.
"We're watching Finding Nemo tonight with the captain." He stood up and started backing out of the room slowly. Natasha looked at him, he was grinning with so much enthusiasm, like nothing happened. "If you want to join, just hit up Steve's room, it's a lot bigger than our little capsules." he gestured to the room. "Good night, Nat." Clint waved.
Happy sighed when he saw Tony's 'name', he clipped it onto his suit proudly and excused them to head for the elevator.
"Fuck, is that the same guy?" Clint asked and from the rustling, she supposed him and Steve were ready to sneak in somehow.
“I do too.” Sam spoke up and Steve felt a kind of understanding between them. “Well, we gotta get to the playground. But maybe we’ll meet again, I’m guessing you’re the Steve, Ashely couldn’t shut up about.” Sam smiled, he was the first person around Steve's age he really met outside of the agency, not counting the bullies.
"This game, on the radio, it's from May 1941, I know cause I was there." The captain explained, Natasha didn't drop the facade, when the captain stepped closer to her. "Where am I and who are you?!" he asked, but Natasha couldn't answer, because Shield agents flooded the room.
Natasha and Clint followed her down a level to a bigger room with boxes upon boxes and walls lined with file cabinets. Agent Jessie walked to the boxes in the back.
“R-right.” He was still baffled when he shook his head. “No?... I mean there are lots of pretty girls, but I assume you meant one I’m interested in.”
She talked to some professors and their prodigy students, they were either stuck up, tense or nerds. She made a big effort to look like she knew what they were talking about when the conversation trailed from simply small talk.
She was so focused on maintaining eye contact before, she covertly checked his nametag. When she read the words she had to take a double take. 'You know who I am'
"Why are you still here?" she asked, it must had come off as rude more than curious, because he stopped rambling. He chewed his food slowly, contemplating his answer while he stared at her with wide eyes.
They took a car, Natasha got the keys for it legally. Steve took the passenger seat and Clint sat in the middle in the back. They still had a security gate to pass to get the hell out of there.
“Hey Jarvis could you look for tonight’s security footage for me?” Tony asked and the hologram screen sprang to life from the watch.
The helmet disappeared from the girl’s head and she grinned at all of them. “Sorry, I’m late.” She told them with a little sigh.
Pepper and Rhodey were familiar with the messy, zombie look Tony sported at home, but that was a mystery for everybody else cause damn, Tony Stark cleaned up well.
Natasha hated waking up, especially to the morning sun creeping through the blinds. She liked the night much more, it was in the darkness when she thrived, she hid in the shadows, calculating, waiting for the right moment to strike. The mornings were always the same before she joined S.H.I.E.L.D, before she was rescued by Shield. Everything was scheduled for her, decided for her and her thoughts weren't even hers.
The voice was gently, almost worried and definitely of a girl. “Pepper?” he asked, his brows furrowed in confusion. “What are you doing here?”
Natasha sat down on one of the boxes and started reading a document from another one. Clint groaned and dropped to the ground starting to look through one of the boxes.
“So you’ve never learned to write?” It was more of a statement than a question, even though her tone was question like.
“We’ll never know.” Natasha shrugged and walked out of the elevator. “Now if you excuse me boys I have a party to get ready for.” She disappeared out of sight when the elevator closed.
“You told me you want me to lead a group of young individuals with great skills.” Fury was not backing down from the stare off and Steve’s stubborn ass would stand behind his decision till the end of the world.
He didn’t get any response, so he stepped back with his hands behind his back, patiently waiting. Then he heard footsteps, he turned his head, the director of Shield was smirking.
The captain stood up from his bed and stepped closer to Natasha. "Where am I really?" he asked suspicion clearly on his mind.
“Okay, so let’s go running!” Clint jumped up enthusiastically. “Tomorrow though! Dinner was magnificent.” Clint said while he rubbed his stomach, cherishing every memory of the roasted chicken.
His gaze glided away from the messy pile and he read the title of the book laying on the table with a pair of glasses on top of it. His heart skipped a beat while he leaned forward. It was like the world ceased to exist as he lifted the book. ‘The Serum’ written by Margaret Carter. His hands were shaking when he caressed the cover with a broken vile.
“Listen, Steve. I haven’t been here longer than you, so I really shouldn’t be the one giving you advice on the matter,” he looked at Natasha, just to make sure she knew he was absolutely referring to her. “But! Fury is Fury. Shield is Shield. We do our best to ignore that!” He said while he was imagining himself as a philosopher pulling off the greatest show. At least he believed he said something relatively good advice, if Steve didn’t.
Occasionally he had movie nights with Clint, they sat in their pajamas in one of their rooms and watched whatever Clint could think of that day. He told Steve he always wanted to watch some of these movies and now Steve was the perfect reason to make those dreams come true. There were a few that left Clint snoring on his shoulder though.
Natasha drank a bit as well, she wasn't a big fan of any alcoholic beverage but she wasn't backing down.
Almost a week passed by and the days blended together, Natasha felt like she'd been stuck in her room for ages now. She looked at her clock, it was around 8 am, so breakfast should be here shortly. She got excited for the letters, she noticed, it was like having an actual friend.
"Really...?" Tony muttered to himself. Pepper and Rhodey wrote their names on and clipped it onto their clothes.
“Actually, I’m starving!” he exclaimed like he just remembered that basic human need existed and turned to the screens on the desk, he was so excited like he just got another brilliant idea for one of his inventions.
“Wait…” Sam murmured. “Holy cow.” He awed, Steve was still speechless, but looked back at him anyway.
Natasha entered the room full of screens, Fury and Hill were looking at a camera showing Captain America in his movie set like room.  He was sleeping peacefully, oblivious to anything that had happened to him and having no idea what he'll have to go through. Fury had told her they kept him sleeping until they established his system was stable.
"It's so dry! Like.. I was so excited the first time I saw it! I was just like, 'Yes! Chocolate cake!' and then I bit down and urghh..." Clint imitated like he was throwing up.
They almost arrived when Pepper was powdering Tony's face so he looked almost like a porcelain doll. On the plane a really nice lady did Tony's makeup so the dark circles were nowhere to be seen. His hair  was perfectly shaped and no hurricane could mess it up. He had a simple black suit on, he didn't want to make that much of an effort, but went with a red, black polka dot shirt.
Natasha didn’t know how to react to that at first. “Occasionally.” She muttered at last. She didn’t hear or see anything to really laugh about in her everyday life. Clint was probably the sole exception.
Clint slumped back in his chair taking a bite of his toast and narrowed his eyes comically. They watched each other in silence, their brain not registering the noises around them.  Natasha's stone hard poker face didn't change, it stayed neutral, unthreatened.
"I can get you a drink, if you'd like?" he offered, but she turned it down with a shake of her head.
The car stopped in front of the famous Stark Tower. Tony looked at his face and hair one last time in the mirror, then pulled a pair of sunglasses out. He flipped it on his nose and smiled with his best press smile.
Natasha got in her pilot seat. She set everything ready for takeoff. She'd learnt it a few months ago, but now it was like second nature for her. She could easily operate any Shield aircraft if she needed to. She might not had been the best pilot at the agency, but she could fly steadily.
“Oh, my!” Tony jumped into a sitting position while reading his tablet. Pepper and Rhodey looked at each other, Tony had mood swings left and right and sudden bursts of energy wasn’t uncommon either, but for the simple minds it was usually time to adjust and figure him out.
“Your name is Steve! You run faster than a fricking race car!” Sam yelled. “That’s insane! You’re Captain America!”
A few seconds later another guy ran by them, he looked their age and wore determination on his face.
"Wh--" he managed in a rough voice. "How--" he was cut by Natasha before he could ask something stupid.
“You didn’t do school?” she inquired, paying attention to every tiny muscle in his face as he just awkwardly smiled and looked straight into her eyes. They walked the corridors side by side in comfortable silence.
“Good afternoon, Steve.” Mrs. Wilson opened the door with a smile, reminding him that he rang the bell. Upon seeing Steve’s shocked face she peeked sideways to catch a glimpse of the source of his discomfort, but only saw the tomato plants.
“Are you a hero as well?” Greg inquired with a lot of sudden interest. “Mom always tells us she interviews heroes!” he explained, looking Steve in his eyes.
"You could go back to school, nobody is keeping you here." she stated coldly, watching his body language closely, trying to read him.
Tony looked up and grinned when he saw his ‘assistant’, deep down she wished he’d bang his head on the hood for her amusement, but he managed to avoid by a hair’s breadth.
So they did that after Natasha sent back a letter. They exchanged notes like they were from the 19th century. She thought Clint would write down all of his thoughts, but he kept the notes brief as well. Agent Dylon always came in with a smile like she knew what they were writing about, but either way she was their messenger pigeon every meal of the day.
“Romanoff!!!” Clint jogged after her. He panted when he caught up. “Geez, you’re hard to find.” He complained.
Natasha felt her lips twitch and looking at the two slices of cake made her warm inside. It was a bummer, they couldn't use any communication devices, even the secret Shield server was inaccessible.
“No way!” Sam straightened in his seat, his brain obviously working fast, adding one and one together, jumping to conclusions, trying to solve the puzzle. “I knew you were familiar… Are you..?” Sam asked and stood up, shock mixing with his expression. “Of course you are! That’s insane!” he tugged on his short hair.
