“No, no, it’s not because I don’t want you there. God, I would love nothing more than to have you there. It’s just… I don’t want to look like I’ve been pining away out here and that I’m so pathetic I needed to bring my best friend with me because I couldn’t get a date.”
Castiel had to stop Jody and Donna from flying out, insisting it wasn't necessary. Jack would travel back in the truck with Gabe, and Castiel and Dean would take the Impala. For once, Dean hadn’t argued about not taking the first shift. Castiel could only imagine how being forced to drive hours on end with a gun to his head had messed with his husband.
What Dean hadn't expected, as he jerked off rapidly, was for Cas to burst through the bedroom door, eyes wild as his gaze fell on Dean's now come covered fist. Cas' gaze had gone from tempestuous to flat in what seemed like seconds, stalking out of the room and heading to the kitchen, if the slamming cabinet doors were anything to go by.
Castiel had envisioned this moment many ways, but right now, all he could think was that he wanted to stay like this, in Dean’s lap, looking into his dark forest eyes.
“Don’t ask stupid questions,” Castiel rumbled, “and keep doing that,” he demanded and Dean chuckled underneath him, hand resuming his stroking.
“Well, thank you. But actually. That, uh…,” Dean rubbed the back of his neck in that way that always signaled nervousness. “That’s for you. I wanted to do something... I don’t know,  to show you, you know, how in this I am.”
Dean found himself dragged into Castiel’s lap, bodies still connected as he straddled Cas, drawn up together chest to chest.
Dean made quick work of changing into his flannel pajama pants and an old Singer’s Salvage tee shirt. Dean looked at himself in the mirror and tried to smile, giving his reflection the finger guns. Dean rolled his eyes at himself; he looked like a jackass.
"Gross," he panted, bent at the waist as Castiel's hand ran up and down Dean's back, soothingly. When he righted himself, however, the world went sideways, and Dean's vision began to go black around the edges, foggy, but he could see Castiel's stormy blue eyes and his name being called frantically.
“I don’t know what you want me to say, Sammy. Maybe he regrets telling me. Maybe he didn’t mean it.”
He cleared his throat, “Ahem, what kind of noises, Sam?” Castiel asked, not even flinching when he felt Dean kick him under the picnic table.
"He's hot, aesthetically speaking, but c'mon Cas. You say that all the time," she whispered as they watched Dean and Gabriel sit down at one of the scarred wooden tables.
“Only a little,” Castiel murmured, before bringing their lips together in a tender kiss. Dean changed the angle, taking it deeper, and Castiel turned to face him better. Cas looped his arm around Dean’s neck, fingers tangling in his dark honey hair. The band played something soft and melancholy as their companions faded into the background, and Castiel could only focus on Dean. The feeling of his calloused fingers cradling Cas’ face, the whisper of his thumbs brushing against Cas’ stubbled cheeks; the roll of his talented tongue rich with the flavor of the hard pear cider they had been drinking.
“Have a good morning, Dean,” Eve said, voice breathy, either from exertion or an attempt to be provocative. Dean suspected the latter, as he was sure Castiel did, as he all but stumbled out of the house, down the porch, at the sight of his bendy neighbor making upside-down eyes at his husband.
Dean chatted with parents as he dished out nachos and batches of fries in between working with the kids, time flying by as the first game slipped into the second.
Dean was still waiting for Castiel by the bar when he returned from the bathroom; only when Castiel stepped back into the ballroom, he saw that Dean wasn’t alone. Moving closer, Cas eyed the voluptuous blonde who was lingering rather closely in his husband’s space.
“Anyway,” Dean continued, gruffly, “We moved back home with Grandpa Henry, and my dad started working with Bobby Singer. He found Baby in a junkyard and fixed her up in his free time. Impressed Bobby so much that he made him in charge of restorations. Things were going well, he was doing better, but he wound up dying of a heart attack when I was sixteen.  Grandpa Henry did the best he could with us, but taking care of Sammy mostly fell to me because he was pushing seventy by then.”
As soon as Castiel told Dean they had the option not to cancel, he was all over it. Castiel suspected that Dean had something planned. He was so adamant about it. If there was any way they could have made it to the airport on time Monday morning, he would have wanted to leave then. But there was no way, not to mention the fact that all of their luggage was at home, with last-minute things still to be packed.
“Uh-oh, Winchester.  Guess it’s that time of year again,” she said with a nod towards the window.  Emmanuel sipped again as he observed. Standing outside the bakery on the crowded boardwalk was a winsome brunette with a gorgeous body and a smile so spectacular, the woman could have been a toothpaste advertisement.  She showed it off brightly as she held a phone to her ear and peered through the window.
“Yes, Krissy, I’m fine. How did your Valentine cookies come out?”  That’s right. It was Valentine’s Day. Or, as Dean liked to call it, Unattached Drifter Christmas.
"When you ordered me into the bathroom and pushed me into the stall, commanding me to get on my knees, I was relieved. I didn’t want to think, I just wanted to feel like I was yours.”
Instead, Castiel turned his focus back to the phone call, pulling into the rest area right off the exit.
Dean breathed deeply, ignoring the sheen of tears that sprang into his eyes.  Emmanuel gently rubbed Dean’s freckled knuckles with his thumb and he began to speak.
“Do you think I put too much cinnamon in here?” Dean’s brows knitted together at the question which gave Emmanuel the advantage of surprise when he yanked Dean forward by the collar of his shirt and proceeded to lick into his delectable mouth.
Castiel glanced at Dean who was now back behind the bar and found his expressive eyes were already lit on him. Cas wished the man was close enough for him to admire their moss-green depths. Dean threw him a soft smile before turning his attention back to his brother. Castiel reached into his trench coat pocket and pulled out his digital camera. He'd gotten in the habit of keeping it on him nowadays. Charlie smiled cheekily at him as he pointed the camera in her direction. Turning back towards Dean, he zoomed in and snapped a picture of him in mid-laugh.
“God, what is wrong with him?” Gabriel and his wife Kali owned a pornography producton company called Casa Erotica, out in Vegas.
“Some of you’ll will have to stand,” Jody said, sweeping her arms toward the two seats in front of her desk. Dean and Castiel sank into the chairs and he was gratified when Dean reached for his hands.
“Me too. Get on your phone and find me the closest diner. I’m pretty sure we’re close to that one with the-”
“Yeah, babe, I’m sorry. I wasn’t thinking. Jim, man, he reconnected with you and Gabe about eight years ago?” Dean cocked his head as he questioned his calculations. “Yeah, ‘bout that long. He’d tried to keep in touch with you guys growing up but his letters kept getting returned-to-sender, so he finally stopped. When he heard through the grapevine how you and Gabriel rebelled against your family, he searched you out.”
Emmanuel flicked the light switch off as he descended the back staircase to the bakery kitchen. He had pilfered clothes from Dean, a
With the stall in traffic, it was nearly eleven when they hit the next toll, entering Indiana, still on the I-90 headed west. Dean's heart leapt in his throat when for a split second, he could have sworn he saw his brother's truck.
"You can make it up to me later," Dean said teasingly, trying to lighten the mood. "If it makes you feel better, it's not just you. This definitely doesn't feel like the usual haunted house creepiness," Dean admitted. "It's more. I feel… I feel like I'm being studied."
“Claire, there is no way your father would have ever cheated on your mom, okay? He loved her too much for that. He still loves her, Claire, whether she is here or not.” Dean reached into his messenger bag and pulled out two bottles of water and handed one over. He twisted off the cap and took a swig.
“C’mon, man. I’m not gonna call the cops, and if you give me my hands, I can do you one better than just describing the dude.”
“Why the hell did you have to drink so many shots with Crowley,” Dean grumbled as Rowena moved forward to open the passenger side of her and Sam’s jeep.
The truth was, they talked about everything, but relationship stuff? Not so much. Hell, back in college, Dean hadn’t even known they were together. Cas had been flustered and awkward whenever Dean brought up his dates or sex, and for a while, Dean had thought his friend was silently judging him because Dean was so open about it all. It took him a bit, but eventually, Dean understood that Castiel wasn’t judgemental. He was just private.
But not right now. Right now Castiel was itching for a fight, to let out his aggression and Dean knew how he could help with that.
Dean cleared his throat and forced his insides to stop quaking. “We will, Cas. We’ll make an appointment right away.”
"Happy to meet you, Charlie. I hope you like classic rock in the kitchen," Dean said with a charming smile that only highlighted the glow surrounding him. His rich baritone was like dark honey, and Castiel wanted to hear it again.
"I'm surprised you're staying at Tricksters," Castiel said after Dean took his shot, just missing the corner pocket with a soft curse.
“Yes. Yes, they do,” When Dean followed him inside with mischief and lust in his eyes, Castiel wondered if he could entice his love into having a late brunch instead.
“That’s fucking gross, dude,” Dean said and Castiel nodded, holding the door of a  liquor store called
“That’s it sweetheart, let it go,” Dean crooned and Castiel’s eyes rolled back as he came with a roar. Rope after rope of hot come, filling Dean up, making the sound of his wet dick sliding in and out of Dean’s ass sound all manner of hot and obscene. Castiel collapsed, and Dean shifted underneath him, cradling Castiel to his chest.
Castiel pulled back and Dean whined. “Shhh,” Castiel soothed with a hand to his knee, before crawling over him to retrieve the lube and a pillow to prop up Dean’s ass.
“That you bought my building to use for low-income housing for single parents? I have my sources,” Dean waggled his brows. Castiel merely stared him down and Dean sighed.
“What a beautiful home! Oh, I would love to live here,” Cas said as he climbed out of the car. The house was a small Cape Style, with a coat of fresh white paint, and boasted navy-trimmed shutters bracketing cheerful window boxes filled with wildflowers.  A cobblestone path led from the front door and curved up and to the left all the way to the entrance of the lighthouse.
. Being with Daphne was easy. She was very amiable, we liked the same things, and could talk about theology for hours. It was… comfortable. I was, for lack of a better word, content. It wasn’t until she pointed out how I always checked to see if I had plans with you before I committed to doing anything with her, that I started getting a clue. I remember, she said:
Sam rolled his eyes. “Not today, Dean. Last week.” Sam’s voice turned somber. “At the bar before the accident.”
“A witness to murder,” Jody said flatly, and Castiel looked at her in shock. “Castiel, Alex isn’t just our foster child. He’s in witness protection. His real name is Jack Kline, and he is the only witness to the mob hit on his mother, ordered by Luke Pellegrino.”
. He had lips that have been kissed, a body —  more thick and muscular than he remembered — that had been touched. He had so many questions and he knew Dean would answer them, but the young man he once was was not as brave as the older, knowing incarnation of himself in the mirror.
The inside of Dean's house was just as charming as the outside, and Castiel was amazed at how immediately at home he felt. From the entryway, the living room spilled out before them in an open floor plan. The hardwood floors were whitewashed, adding to the beach house feel. Unlike the Navy trim on the outside of the house, the inside walls were a light powder blue, reminiscent of the sky on a clear day.
"With the amount of time that he spends time staring at you like a lovesick teenager, I'm pretty sure Cas is fine with you just the way you are," she said with a smirk and rose from her chair. "I'm going to take a walk before I head out. Have a safe trip, guys, and I promise to check on the cats while you're gone."
"Heya, Castiel," Dean drawled. "I've heard a lot about you.” It was plainly said, yet Castiel couldn't help but feel there was more to the words. He narrowed his eyes at Gabriel's for an instant, accusingly, before focusing back on Dean.
"Of course, Dearie," Rowena sighed. "I'm going to have to write this place off as a loss, aren't I" she sounded incredibly sad. Dean heard the words, but now it was through a veil.
“It’s cherry, actually, and you know me, Cassiopeia. I need more than just fruit to get me through the day. “
“Kaia and I escaped. Uncle Dean, he um, he noticed something was off with the guy, right away,” Claire’s voice was shaky, and Castiel reminded himself of his training, forcing himself not to interrupt with questions and let her speak. “We were watching that stupid soap opera Uncle Dean likes and Alex—he… he was in the bathroom,” Claire’s voice broke, and Kaia squeezed her hand.
Castiel took the mirror and used it to look at his reflection. Ink black wings with swirling hints of blue and purple graced his shoulders and back. They seemed to ripple like feathers in a breeze when he moved and Castiel couldn’t believe that such a stunning piece of art made its home on his body. He couldn’t tear his eyes away. What shocked Castiel even more, was that despite his astonishment, the lifelike image felt like it
Castiel smiled, sharply, thinking back for the millionth time, of the night he and Dean first met. “I never touched him, Dean. I merely gave him a chance to choose. He pulled the trigger all on his own.” When given a description of what his life would be where Judge Abbadon was going to send him, Arthur Ketch was grateful for the chance to eat a bullet. “Sometimes the scales need to be balanced.”
“You quit? Oh, please tell me you quit and told that insufferable bag of dicks where to sit and spin,” Dean pleaded excitedly, Sam smacking him on the arm to shut him up. As Castiel was again reminded of the strange day he was having, a bubble of happy laughter erupted as the unconditional support he knew Dean would show washed over him.
“Yeah, cause that bitch told the coach I was smoking weed in the out-of-use bathroom by the science wing!”
“I need a- hang on,” Castiel closed his eyes and focused, blocking out all noise and thoughts aside from connecting with his hunter. His fist clenched and unclenched at his side as he fought down his panic and listened.
It was Friday so Dean would be a little busier than usual. Cas knew that those who planned on relaxing the night away would show up fairly early to claim a spot. The board games would come off of the shelf and couples and groups of friends would order their tea and fruit-infused shisha and while the night away with monopoly or cribbage or clue. Music playing quietly would stay mainly in the classic or alt-rock genre, and the vibe would be completely relaxed.
“I am,” Sam reassured them, face returning to his usual amiable expression. “I just have some last-minute packing to do and a few papers I have to file at the office but I’ll meet you guys back here in the morning?” Sam, who had lived with Dean during most of his years in college, had moved out his last year to live on campus and get the full college experience, taking his half of the rent with him, which was how Dean had wound up with Castiel as a roommate. Sam had posted an ad listing on the community bulletin board at school a few weeks before the new semester started, and by the end of the first day, Cas had answered.
Rage undeterred, Castiel flipped the coffee table instead. It made a satisfying cracking noise as it landed on its side on the hardwood floor. Castiel’s arm swept across the top of the bookshelf, knocking off knickknacks and paperbacks that didn’t look like they’d ever been opened. He didn’t realize he was nearly hyperventilating until his vision went spotty. Castiel lurched towards the window, throwing open the latch, and gulping in the fresh air, like a fish out of water.
“Pretty good. Here, try an arrow,” she said, handing Dean what he had thought was a heart-tipped wand. “The bow broke,” she said with a shrug. The red and white icing had sort of blended together in a very pretty if unintentional pink. Dean took a big bite, impressed with the buttery, flaky texture of the shortbread.
, Cas thought as he pulled back enough to scan the room, pleased when he saw how close they were to the short hall housing the restrooms.
“How come Cas gets to share your phone protector thing?” Sam pouted, and Castiel snickered from behind his mug.
Castiel walked in to find Gabriel nodding, lollipop hanging from his mouth as usual. “Yeah, buddy, I’m thinking a case of Sangria and a big bottle of Patron.”
Emmanuel took a sip of his wine and was surprised when his phone sounded a message had been sent, in his pocket. “Are you sure?” he asked when Dean motioned for him to check it.
“I’m not sitting far away from you,” Castiel said, amusement lacing his voice, and Dean wondered if he had spoken out loud or if Cas was reading his mind. Or maybe, Dean was just really fucking high.  Castiel swiveled himself to face Dean. He was sitting next to him on one of the built-in seats in the back of the van. “I just want you to eat. That stuff is going to hit you hard. You’re supposed to have one maybe two, at most. You know how you get when you have too much,” Castiel said before swapping containers with Dean.
Alistair shrugged his shoulders. "I never laid a hand on her. All I did was make sure she was in the right place at the wrong time. Not that they could prove it. But she had the last laugh, didn't she, Jack? Got herself a nice little nest egg hidden somewhere, and Jack here knows where," Alistair growled, once again pointing the gun at the young man.
Castiel took Dean’s hand in his, a soft smile on his face as they walked to the Impala, gleaming in the sunlight.
The Guardian Angel series followed the life of an angel who had fallen from heaven and the human he’d done it for. The series focuses not only the trials and tribulations of trying to teach a once immortal being how to be mortal and all that came with it, but also what happens when it inspires other angels to do now that they’ve seen a glimpse of free will. Not to mention plenty of hot sex.
“Unfortunately, that is a common trend in haunted houses,” Gabriel said, steepling his fingers. “When you start changing things, it kind of wakes them up. Spirits don’t like it when their familiar surroundings start to become unfamiliar.”
Dean peered at them, and Castiel laughed when he saw the recognition in his eyes. The investigators from the Bigfoot video.
“Go on, get out of here. And Castiel? Try not to knock out any more of Dean’s exes, okay? Save us both the paperwork.”
“Oh, he’s peachy,” Dean snarked and Castiel almost lost it, biting the inside of his cheek. “Turns out he must have filled out a raffle or something because somehow, Sam and his roommate won a housing scholarship from HHI.”
“He used it as an excuse to proposition you, right in front of me,” Castiel challenged and Dean sighed.
“Mm. you smell good,” Dean murmured into his skin, his warm breath making Castiel shiver. “Citrusy.”
"We shared a few classes and got to be friends. We partied a lot, hooked up with girls, all the stupid shit horny guys in their early twenties do. After I graduated, he took off for a few years. Traveled around a bit, crashed with different family members. I didn't see him again until I was twenty-seven, and I'd already bought the bowling alley. We were hanging out one night at Harvelle's. Just done some pretty spectacular karaoke," he said with a half-smile, and Castiel grinned.
, began to breach Dean’s hole, guttural moan ripping from his throat as his cock was gripped in a slick, tight heat.
“Hey, there, Bela,” Dean drawled, making no attempt to disentangle his hand from Cas’, thumb brushing across Castiel’s wedding ring gently.
“You got it, buddy,” Dean said, and Castiel drifted, the soft strums of “Simple Man” streaming from the radio lulling him to sleep.
TV forgotten, Dean surged up, with Castiel's strong legs still wrapped around his waist. They laughed as Dean trip-stumbled down the hall to their bedroom, where he playfully dropped Castiel on the bed. Carrying someone who nearly matched him for weight was not an easy feat, but Castiel was giddy that Dean's desire for him had won out over trembling muscles.
for her. Sam didn’t push his clean-living lifestyle on Eileen, but somehow, he managed to make her feel guilty about it anyway, sometimes.
“No worries, man, I got this. You want a drink? I got beer, wine, milk. Some healthy kale smoothie shit Sam makes me keep in the refrigerator,” Dean offered with a grimace.
Dean closed his eyes, lashes dark crescents against his beautifully freckled skin, and leaned his temple to Emmanuel’s.
Dean’s eyes were open wide, gleaming in the evening twilight and the feeling was heady for Castiel. He angled down for another kiss and was lost in the lushness of Dean’s mouth. Dean fisted his hands in Castiel’s shower-damp hair, gently holding him in place. The kiss was deep, and dark, and languorous; continuing to the point where neither of them could breathe without moaning. When they finally pulled back, Dean laughed softly. Castiel arched a brow in question. Dean feathered his fingers through Cas’ hair.
“Get Comfy, Cas,” Dean said, gesturing to the sleeping bag, and Castiel sat, cross-legged, back against the outside wall of the light room, facing the dark horizon.  Lewis Capaldi crooned in the background, as the only station Dean could get in on top of the lighthouse, was a pop-rock station. Dean pretended to hate it, but Castiel had seen him bobbing his head to Truth Hurts by Lizzo on more than one occasion.
Over the next week, a routine was established. Emmanuel often awoke to an empty apartment. The smell of coffee lingered in the air, a fresh pot warming on the burner and a plate sat in the microwave —- a glossy, sugary cinnamon roll this time. Emmanuel found himself grinning as he poured himself a mug of coffee, dropping into a kitchen chair so he could nibble at the pastry.
“Good. Cause I really didn’t want to deal with all of the people on the T,” Dean admitted, with a laugh, turning his head to catch Cas’ lips with his own. Castiel sank into the kiss, chasing the taste of apple pie and Summer ale from Dean’s lips and tongue. Dean turned in Castiel’s arms and wrapped him up in a tight hug, swaying them in the moonlight shining on their bedroom balcony.
Dean turned in Castiel’s arms and cupped his stubbled cheek. “Hey, no. Don’t do that,” he said softly, sad at the grief in Castiel’s cobalt eyes. “None of this was your fault.”
"I called the resort and let them know we would be arriving a day later, and they were fine with it."
Dean found the disdainful look Castiel sent Balthazar—what the fuck kind of name was that anyway?—unfairly attractive and wished that they were alone so they could enjoy the afternoon together.
"I guess I’m more of a mess than I thought." Castiel said, feeling sheepish about his emotional display, but the look on Dean's face was full of nothing but love.
“Cas, do you not trust me?” Dean, the wounded tone, had Cas’ armor cracking immediately as he stared at Dean in astonishment.
Castiel and Sam followed Dean into the house and to the kitchen. Sam sat on the bench seat, eagerly digging into the burrito in front of him, but Castiel followed Dean over to the sink where he was washing the dishes, and hooked a chin over Dean’s shoulder.
to deal with the onslaught of questions that Castiel knew were coming his way.  So, instead of fighting his boyfriend, he just nodded.
Now cleaned, Castiel sighed as Dean sealed their mouths together again. Dean was in love with how responsive Cas was, hands clutching Dean's shoulders as he devoured the taste of him, desperately. Soft little noises escaped Cas’ throat, pushing past the pressure of their clinging lips, and Dean was absolutely
"You don't have to be sorry, just don't be mad. I didn't want to be all over you tonight when I know you aren't feeling it. Thought I'd take the edge off, so I could be chivalrous and shit," Dean said with a sheepish grin.
And a year later when he came home from work early and found his fiance being fucked by his older brother, it was Dean he ran to. Cas hadn’t even said a word to the shocked gasps and twin pleas for forgiveness. He grabbed his old
For a minute, Sam tried to act like he was too above rumor-spreading but then he gave in and leaned forward across the table.
It was something he hadn’t thought possible, not in the romantic way his best friend had clearly meant, and as Dean had sobbed against the cold wall, it had been for the loss at the chance of something he hadn’t even known was on the table.  Those first few days, it was only the angel’s words that kept him going, and of course, Sam.
blared from hidden speakers as Dean gathered what he needed. He lost himself as he sifted his dry ingredients together, enjoying the rich, bitter scent of the unsweetened cocoa, before drowning out the sound of his music by creaming his eggs, vanilla, and sugar with the hand mixer.
"Dean! Look at me," Cas' tone was commanding, but that didn't seem to matter to whatever it was that had taken hold of him. Dean understood now. He was merely along for the ride. "Dean, are you in there?"
“Thanks. That’s how I feel, too. She’s actually telling her family this week. God, Bobby is going to be pissed at me.”
“I’m sorry it hurts for you to talk about the accident. I know that all of this is hard for you. I’m just trying to piece things together and I think if you tell me about what happened that night, maybe it could help? Michael’s voice... ” Castiel shook his head and Dean huffed out a laugh at the grimace Castiel made when he mentioned him, “Something about it seemed to trigger something," he shrugged. "Maybe hearing about this encounter with my fist will too,” Castiel tried for light and Dean appreciated the effort. “We can wait until after Sam and Gabriel leave.” Castiel conceded and Dean let out a grateful sigh. “We can even save it for last. There are other, interesting things I wanted to talk to you about, too.” Castiel arched his brow and Dean froze for a moment as he remembered Castiel alluding to that earlier. Dean wasn’t sure if Cas’ other topic of discussion would any more comfortable.
Castiel had been looking forward to these two weeks with the Winchester boys, more than any other they’d been on, and not just because of the gorgeous scenery they would be emersed in. No, Castiel was eager to escape reality for sleeping bags and stargazing with his friends because Cas had a plan. Come hell or high water, Castiel and Dean were going to confess their love for each other once and for all. No more hiding behind friendship.
Through the windows, Castiel could see the other officers on duty, one of them, Jody Mills, who was currently on the phone. He could have called Gabriel, though Cas suspected he would never hear the end of it, and he also knew that Dean was more than likely on his way. Castiel’s stomach twisted at the thought, as he worried about how angry Dean was going to be.
The angel-faced accountant cocked his head at him. “Just a minor tranquilizer. It’s not every day I have someone skulking in my warehouse. Sorry about the pallet,” the man said, sounding genuinely apologetic for someone holding Dean hostage.
"That's him, Charlie. He's the one I'm going to marry," Castiel Novak's whiskey-soaked voice was firm with promise as he rested against the table, chalking his cue stick.
“Yeah. I want to see my Mom, Dean,” his voice broke on the words and he felt Gabriel squeeze his shoulder in support.
Now, a week later, it was game night again and Emmanuel smothered a yawn with his hand. He honestly wasn’t sure he’d make it through the whole night.  It had been a busy end of July for Dean. He had three weddings, two beach themed ones to bake cakes for, plus an astronomical order of
"Yeah, but the people watching makes up for it," Dean grinned at him, and Castiel scanned the crowd as they made their way to a high-topped table, sitting side by side in the tall chairs. Castiel tugged at the collar of his shirt, debating on whether or not he should have gone without the vest.
“And every time, at least once a night, I remember our parents danced to this song.  Mom and Becky would hold their red solo cups up high and belt out the chorus Dad and Chuck would dance, just horrifically,” Dean said with an amused smile. “God, we laughed. It got to the point where us kids would all join in till we knew all the words too.”
Again he agonized over how he could have forgotten this? As though he knew Castiel needed it, Dean pulled him into a tight embrace in the middle of the living room, swaying him gently from side to side.
“I love you, Cas,” Dean sighed out, and Cas leaned over and pressed a kiss to the side of Dean’s temple.
It sounded so ordinary and domestic and wonderful and Castiel smiled widely. “I look forward to it,” Castiel said as he rose from the couch and folded the blanket. He placed a hand on Dean’s shoulder and squeezed. “Goodnight, Dean. Sleep well.”
“It’s a lunch sack that’s also a cooler. Oh-” Dean held up a finger, smiling proudly as he fished something else out of the trunk that looked like a giant gray glasses case. “A sidekick. Protects your phone and shit,” Dean said,  “but you're missing the point. Look at the name,” Dean whined, brandishing the case with the huge
The air stirred with a cool breeze as they walked across the overgrown lawn, and Dean wondered if the landscaper had been among the workers who had quit.
“Normally, I wouldn’t want to, but Lily’s been out because May has the flu and Jo is still on maternity leave and I’ve just been working non-stop. You know, when I haven’t been by my coma-ridden brother’s bedside,” Gabriel said with a wink to Castiel. “Too soon?” he asked when Dean glowered at him.
“Son of a bitch,” Dean murmured, then rolled his eyes when his phone buzzed, making him jump. When he saw Cas’ name on the screen, Dean’s heart galloped, and he was almost afraid to read the message. “Man up, dude,” Dean pep talked himself as he thumbed open the message.
“I don’t know, man, everything, I guess. I wish I’d been there for you more. Here you are going through a divorce, and I… I just wish I was there for you more.”
“Yeah, and thanks for dinner, Dean-o,” Gabriel said, giving them both a one-armed hug. “Cassie, don’t push yourself.”
“I’m flattered, Lis, honestly, but as you might have guessed, I’m seeing someone. Lisa, this is my boyfriend, Emmanuel, but he goes by Jimmy,” Emmanuel smiled at her a little sheepishly. He hadn’t really thought beyond his possessive display to a conversation afterward, though if the mirth now lighting in Dean’s eyes meant anything, he certainly had.
“I left the state,” he said, not quite believing it, even as he passed the signs for the New Hampshire State Liquor store. “I actually left the state,” and damn if he wasn't a little choked up about it. Apparently, Emmanuel was too, as he crowded in and peppered Dean’s cheek with kisses as he drove, declaring how proud he was.
“What the hell, man?” Sam yelled from the backseat. “What happened to driver picks the music, shotgun shuts his cakehole?”
Castiel opened his mouth to speak, then closed it again. He tugged at his ear absently, and he appeared to be contemplating.
“Don’t you have work in the morning, there, lawyer boy?” Dean asked teasingly, and Castiel chuckled.
“Cas? Cas, what is it?” the worry in Sam’s voice filtered in as Castiel shifted wide-panicked eyes to him.
"I didn't fuck anyone over, Charlie," Castiel said, annoyed. "It's not my fault if they become attached when I am nothing but honest with them," Castiel said distractedly, as he found himself caught in another stare down with Dean across the room; Castiel fiddled with his tongue ring as Dean and Gabriel rose from their table, and headed towards Castiel and Charlie, eyes locked the whole way.
But in the video that Castiel was now watching with a look of horrified embarrassment on his face, Dean was placing full blame on his boyfriend. Honestly, what was Dean supposed to do besides straddle Cas’ lap in a crowded bar and grind on him? Especially when he’d been sitting sprawled in a chair, eyebrow cocked, cheekily inviting Dean over with his voice like liquid smoke?
"Tipsy enough to have sex with me in the high school library," Dean said with a quick wink. “Anyway," he continued, "then I suppose, yes, Castiel, I get more irritated when men hit on you.”
Castiel leaned against the wall, arms folded, fighting back his fear so he could listen, as Jody answered the phone, putting it on speaker.
Castiel eased himself back into Dean's lap, angling for a kiss. "We'll make new memories," he said, a hairsbreadth from Dean's lips, before claiming his mouth with his own. Dean couldn't help the soft moan he released at the taste of Cas on his tongue as his husband rocked in his lap. Dean tried not let himself get too excited, but
“May I ask, Rowena,” Castiel said, with a quick look at Dean, “ did there happen to be a fire on the estate?”
Then, Castiel did smile, shoulders slumping in relief. “Thank you, Dean.” They both knew he didn’t just mean for the food.
Castiel sat in the red vinyl booth and poured himself a cup of steaming hot coffee from the carafe into one of the plain squat mugs before him. Taking a sip, he found it rich and strong, just the way he liked it. Unlike his tea, Castiel preferred his coffee black and undoctored.
“I didn’t say anything,” Castiel said with a teasing smile, laughing when Dean threw a complimentary robe in his face.
"Seriously, thanks for doing this with me. I know there are a thousand other things you'd rather be doing," Dean said as they walked through the throngs of elves, orcs, and fairies milling about the camp. The Moondoor Faire was a LARPing event that ran from April through the end of October, culminating in a battle for the throne. Charlie had been crowned queen the last three years running, requiring her handmaiden to be present and accounted for in her court .
But it was more than that, too, Dean thought as he carefully stuck the cupcake trays in the blast chiller to cool. It was more than a hard tumble that Jimmy made him yearn for.
“Look, Cas is great. He's perfect, even. But this is all new to him and I'm not real gung-ho on letting myself fall for a guy only to have him decide later that he's changed his mind.” That was the crux of it, no point in beating around the bush.
Emmanuel had felt so recharged, that he sat down to start writing and never actually left the apartment. Dean had run up to check on him and all he could offer was a grunt of acknowledgement as his characters called his attention away from anyone actually living. He seemed to work that way non-stop for the next week; so in the groove that he couldn’t find the time to complete his normal routine of coffee, yoga, then head to the bakery. No, the words wouldn’t allow it; he fell asleep thinking of writing and woke that way and Dean seemed to get that this was how Emmanuel existed when he was in the zone. Dean forced him to take breaks when they were at home, though, bringing him meals, making him eat dinner with him, even if it was just take-out and an hour of vegging out to the Food Network.  He’d end up back in his room by eight, writing until he couldn’t keep his eyes open any longer. Once he'd finally broken out of his self-imposed exile, he was exhausted but pleased that his editor would be off his back for a bit.
“I kissed him on campus in front of a bunch of homophobic Trump supporters, and it led to us confessing our feelings,” Castiel summarized, and Dean smiled at him gratefully.
“If I had thought it would have made a difference, I would have.  I wish I would have. I genuinely didn’t think I stood a chance, and even though I didn’t agree with you, and I was heartbroken, I only ever wanted you to be happy.” Dean said.
Dean couldn’t bring himself to look up when Castiel sat next to him on the bench, fingers clutching the edge so hard that his knuckles gleamed white in the dark.
“Toni. Her name was Toni, and she worked for my family.” The words were hard, and regret sat heavily on Castiel’s arresting face. “Now, I don’t think you had anything to do with that, Dean.” The words were a little comfort, and had Dean exhaling a breath he wasn’t aware of holding. “But I do need you to tell me everything about the man who shot her. Every detail.”
Jimmy liked to tease him about how hard Castiel worked to keep in shape while Dean pretty much lived off of bacon and burgers and only had a tiny bit of pudge around his middle to show for it. The rest of Dean Winchester was strong and firm and so perfect he looked photoshopped.
“I would love to see them,” Castiel said, digging into his own lunch. “I’ve been having more and more memory flashes,” he told Gabriel, taking a swig of his lager.
“I guess I was just wondering why Cas decided to take me to this dance with him?” The question fell out of Dean’s mouth before he could hold it back. “I know for a fact that Hannah likes him,” Dean said, thinking of the Poe-admiring history teacher, “I kind of thought he might ask her.”
house they seemed to be stuck in. At least for the time being. He didn't want to say anything to Castiel, because his future husband was already looking at him with anxious, worried speculation in his expressive blue eyes. Although judging by the guilty way Cas was looking at Dean now, perhaps it was he who should be worried.
“Going by the ring of bruises around her neck, they suggested she was strangled before she was tossed in the water.”
Butterflies winged in his chest, but he smiled, happy for their dance around his heart. He nodded, resolutely, even as emotion grabbed him by the throat.
"I caved. It's the least I could do for his peace of mind. It's not as though I usually stay for the whole thing anyway. They do their walkthrough, I come in and do mine; see if there is actually anything I can help with," Castiel took another hit before passing the joint off to Lily.
Castiel eyed him speculatively but started towards Dean, blade in hand. Dean sucked in a sharp breath when the man came behind him, leaning down. Dean smelled cinnamon and rich coffee as Castiel chuckled in his ear, the sound inducing chills, and he swallowed hard.
mode anymore. Sometimes Dean worried they’d get too comfortable and something terrible would inevitably come and take them down. He was trying to curb that line of thinking.
April’s mother had cornered him around the small card table housing the coffee, wanting to know when she should expect her daughter’s belongings. She had a precise list of things she wanted of April’s. It wasn’t that Castiel cared. April’s mother could have what she wanted. It was only the act of packing itself. Just the very thought left him feeling exhausted. Going through April’s things, he hadn’t even thought about it in the week since her death. Seven days wasn’t nearly as long as it sounded, especially while drifting through a fog.
When Charlie went up to the bar to get them another round of drinks, Sam and Rowena joined their table. Sam was more than a little tipsy himself, and Rowena was shaking her head at him fondly.
“Can’t say I’m disappointed about that,” Dean said, honestly, earning himself a soft smile, one that had Cas’ baby blues crinkling at the corners.
“No, it’s not,” Leo screeched, still holding a hand to his bleeding nose. “This maniac attacked me!”
Dean whined when Cas pulled his lips back, eyes dark and greedy for him, and Castiel smiled wickedly.
“What? You can’t carry the moose out yourself?” Dean teased, kissing Castiel, a quick one this time, before sliding out of the booth. “I’m gonna help the Sammy to the car, blue eyes, be right back.”
“I didn’t speak for a long time after that day. Hours with the police trying to give a half-assed description of a redhead wearing sunglasses and a yellow dress and Castiel screaming my name over and over until he was lost in the crowd.” The summer breeze teased Dean’s hair as he looked up, not meeting Emmanuel’s gaze. “Hours trying to give a minute by minute description about where we’d gone, who we’d spoken to, until my voice was so raw it hurt to whisper. Then I just stopped talking altogether,” Dean said softly, tipping his head back to peer at the stars.
Watching Dean in his gruff, nurturing element with his brother had Castiel grinning dopily, and he was sure his affection was clearly displayed on his face. Castiel had long given up control over his emotions when it came to Dean years ago.  His' bluntness, which could be off-putting to some, only seemed to make Castiel more endearing to Dean, and he didn't bother to hide it.
As he locked eyes with Balthazar. His big brother smiled brightly and gave Castiel a salute before fading away.
“I do security for the LARPing events,” Gabriel said with a shrug. “Free turkey legs and fried dough. It’s a pretty good gig.”
“I said, is Benny the one who got away?” The question seemed reluctantly gritted out, all sandpaper and gravel and Dean couldn’t help but chuckle.
Castiel air quoted, the endearing gesture piercing through Dean's weird fog of apathy. "She was a mother. A mother who was being used by a very dark spirit. It's here, hiding like a coward in this Manor." There was obvious loathing in Castiel's voice when he spoke, and Dean's stomach twisted, offended, which was baffling. It wasn't as though Dean disagreed. Whoever this ghost was, he was a prick, and given the history of the place, most likely, a murderer.
Castiel was sure Claire would have a thing or two to say about that, and wasn’t disappointed when the teenager put up a fight at his suggestion to leave.
“Hi, El, bye El,” Sam said with a laugh, closing the door behind her. “Where is she off to? I thought we were doing brunch?”
Castiel threw his jeans on top of Dean’s in the oversized chair next to the bed and stood naked and unashamed. Dean’s eyes raked over him, and Castiel looked his fill as well, drinking in the gorgeous sight of bowed legs and freckled skin. Cas thought maybe it would feel weird to stand together like this, so vulnerable and bare, but instead if felt so perfectly right. Like this was where they were always meant to be.
“You don’t have to come, you know,” Castiel found himself saying, a little defensively. “To the wedding I mean.”
“Questions? Comments? This is the part where you respond to your best friend who just bared their soul.”
It was true. They had been leaving a private New Year’s Eve party.  They’d taken the T to the Roadhouse but staying past the trains meant taking an Uber back home. It had been an intense night and they had both been eager to be alone and reconnect. Cas was a handsy drunk, much to the Uber driver’s dismay and Dean’s joy.  Their loft was only fifteen minutes away, but the drop in temperature and rapidly falling snow left walking out of the question. Dean shouldn’t have been surprised when the accident happened. The roads were slick with black ice and it had been a horrific night for crashes. The Uber driver had never seen the other car coming.
“Yeah,” Dean said, scratching his dog’s ear and feeling a warm glow as Sam pulled Cas into a big bear hug. “I guess they do.”
“What the fuck!? Cas, baby, you okay?” Dean barrelled in the bathroom door, a panicked look on his face. Castiel nearly shrieked, eyes widening as he stood naked in front of Dean. He fumbled with the towel as he tried to cover himself up, his frantic movements his downfall as Castiel slipped, losing both the towel and his footing. He was both grateful and embarrassed when Dean caught him to his firm chest by the forearms with a solid grip. Castiel’s damp body left wet marks on Dean’s teeshirt as he stood clutched against him.
They hadn’t spoken for a week after that, Castiel leaving Dean’s apartment and not looking back, only to show up the following Saturday. It was nearing midnight, and he’d used his key to get in. Castiel had followed the familiar path of Dean’s work clothes to his bedroom, finding the man sleeping restlessly in his boxers. Cas had stripped down to his own undershirt and briefs and crawled into bed alongside his best friend and enveloped him like an octopus.
“I love how you can twist cowardly into polite and spin into a positive thing, “ Castiel said dryly, and Dean shrugged.
said what he wanted and what he wanted was Cas. It had been the happiest moment of his life, and if it weren’t for what had happened with Jack, Castiel was sure he would have been taken by the empty as soon as he and Dean’s lips collided.  He was in love, and he was
“And what did you do?” Emmanuel asked, envisioning a young Dean with sad, stubborn eyes clutching a comfort toy.
“Perfect,” Castiel purred as Dean scrambled to do as he was told. His back arched when he felt Cas’ hand trail down his spine, shivers wracking his body.
He should hate her. But he hated himself more. Why had he given up? Why didn’t he fight? Fuck all, why couldn’t he
A euphoric feeling of relief overtook Dean's body as Castiel growled from behind him, voice sandpaper rough and unforgiving. He started to shake with tremors, vaguely aware of Gabriel reading Alistair his rights. Dean couldn't help it; he bent over and vomited quite spectacularly.
“Anything in the mail today?” Dean asked, deflecting, and was surprised to feel Castiel tense up beside him. Dean looked over at his friend in concern. “Cas? Everything okay, man?”
The will reading was fairly standard. Gabriel was left all of his grandmother's recipes, and some classic albums (who knew Gabriel was a closet Bing Crosby fan?), Luke was left some of his father's jewelry, and Jack, who had just begun school in Boston, had a college fund set up in his name that would help cover what Luke and his ex Kelly couldn't afford. Becky and Hester and Charlie were both left family heirlooms; necklaces and earrings, and a beautiful tea set that Charlie shed tears over. Most of the art went to Hester, while Lily and Akobel's book collection went to Becky.
Dean allowed his head to drop back on Castiel’s shoulder, turning to nuzzle into the juncture of Cas’ neck and shoulder. Dean took a deep breath, attempting to ground himself in Castiel’s citrusy-scent.
“Alright. I suppose that’s the best we can do until Dean calls to me again,” Castiel replied. “Hang on, Dean,” he gritted out, peering over Sam’s shoulder to read the laptop screen.
“Ah, well. I didn’t see much; it was dark. Honestly, I am not convinced it wasn’t just a bear,” Cas’ voice was steady, and Dean was impressed.
“I know. But it’s only until an apartment becomes available. I can deal with it. I've slept in worse,” Emmanuel said with a shrug that did nothing for the almost pained expression on Dean’s face. He reached a hand out to Dean’s and squeezed. “It’s truly fine, Dean. I can take care of myself. I’m quite fit, you know.”
“Excuse me?” he questioned, and out of the corner of his eye, Castiel could see Dean’s confusion as well, until it melted away into a look of dawning realization. Dean chuckled, scrubbing a hand down his face.
“My mom, she was really pretty, you know?” Claire said quietly, finally lifting her blue eyes to meet Dean’s. “She was gentle and kind, and she loved my dad so much. They were so happy. I thought she was the love of his life.” Dean felt his throat tighten a bit as the emotional tone of Claire’s voice had his heart clenching a little bit. He remembered, and it was true; James and Amelia Novak looked at each other the same way he and Cas did, and the thought of losing that was too heartwrenching for words.
“Oh, sweet boy,” Castiel breathed out and heard Dean gasp softly at the endearment. “I remember everything.”
“Of course I do, Dean,” Castiel said sincerely, “it’s simply for your own safety. How did you find it, anyway?”
“You want to know why am I here instead of singing with the angels? ” Michael abruptly shoved off Sam’s arm, a surprising show of strength that had Castiel’s future brother-in-law stumbling. “Well, then, gather round, children, and let me tell you a story.”
"What if I can't fix it?" Castiel's quiet question had Dean sighing softly. Of course, that was the primary source of Cas' irritation, the idea of not being able to help someone in need. "What if they don't want me to?"
Castiel and April had been married just over a year when Dean had returned from living in New York. Dean remembered how he and Sam and Castiel had been sitting around a table at the back of The Roadhouse, enjoying beer and each other’s company. Castiel hadn’t changed much in the short time Dean had been gone. He still wore the same boxy tan trenchcoat that hid his phenomenal frame, only now, instead of a sweater-vest and jeans, Castiel sported the classic tie and slacks of his English teacher persona (or tax accountant, let’s be real).
“Come on. We have an entire chocolate banana cream pie at home,” Castiel reminded him with a laugh and Dean’s eyes lit up.
Castiel managed to avoid a proper greeting with April, letting Jo say hello and urge his wife to sit down while Castiel collected himself by going to the bar to get another round of drinks.
Emmanuel bit back a grin and plastered on an innocent expression. “I’m sure I don’t know what you’re talking about,” he said, voice a deep rumble as he hid his smile behind his coffee cup.
Castiel put his sandwich down. “Lochness Monster,” he deadpanned. “See?  I can do it too. El Chupacabra.”
Emmanuel held up his hand to stop the torrent of Meg’s words. “I’ll hear about it from Dean when and if he decides to share with me. Until then, it’s his business and probably not something you should be advertising to others, well-intentioned or not.” He didn’t try and mask the disapproval in his tone. When Meg didn’t say anything more, Emmanuel scooped up another bite of parfait, enjoying the crunch of the granola combined with tart cherry.
"I'm not getting in an ambulance," Dean's tone was obstinate, and somehow, it was still the most beautiful thing in the world to Castiel's ears. He was reasonably sure he could listen to Dean wax poetic about the latest Doctor Sexy MD gossip for the next three days and look nothing but besotted.
“Don’t hold, back, come on,” Castiel’s fucked-out words seemed to be all the permission Dean needed as he renewed his grip on Cas’ hips and proceeded to pound up into him, harsh grunts escaping through his gritted teeth.
A ping sounded on the cell phone on the counter, and Dean watched with interest as Castiel picked it up, thumbing the screen open. He couldn't help wondering who was texting Cas so early.
“I imagine we have to make it through the fireworks at least,” Castiel managed, pulling back and putting a hand to his husband’s chest. “That was kind of the point in coming here,” Castiel pointed out drily.
Sam shot Dean a dirty look from the back seat but Cas had no pity because the smell was truly heinous.
Dean could only gape at Cas as the angel stepped in closer, the toe of his shoes bumping Dean’s boots.
“I thought after Castiel knocked him out he’d have taken the hint,” Gabriel said, earning another glare from Dean.
“Even the ones that we can’t see,” Castiel said wistfully, and Dean knew he was thinking of Balthazar. He gave Castiel one more kiss before going to the driver’s side.
Dean stood up from the table and Castiel’s eyes followed him to the double-wide refrigerator and began pulling out ingredients for his next lesson. The bell rang over the loudspeaker and soon the hallway was filled with the sound of pounding feet and adolescent chatter.
Dean braced his arms in the doorway of the office and leaned out, and just watched for a while. He smiled widely when Jesse picked up a small split, happy the little adjustment they'd made to his wrist movement seemed to be helping. Dean heard the buzzer sound in the back office which meant someone was coming in through the front door and he grinned when he saw that it was Charlie. Then his heart tripped and stumbled when he saw that Castiel followed close behind.
“Good. That’s good,” Dean murmured back, reclaiming Emmanuel’s mouth in another kiss, this one much greedier than the first. Emmanuel shifted, maneuvering until Dean was against the counter.  Baking forgotten, he slid his hands up and under Dean’s tee-shirt, sighing happily into his mouth at the feel of his warm, smooth skin.
The driveway was to the right of the house and forked sharply to the left, leading to a large garage, protecting his Baby from all of the elements. Dean loved being able to park her in the driveway and wash and wax the Impala under the bright sunshine. Dean definitely didn't miss the parking garage of the apartment complex.
Castiel barked out a laugh. Charlie’s girlfriend Meg was a nurse and wasn’t able to make her shift coincide with league night which was why Castiel was fortunate to be paired up with her.
want to do,” Gabriel implored. “Come to Angel’s Bend, you can move into my spare room. Work in the cafe until you find a job you really want. It’s gorgeous here, Cassie, you could start taking pictures again.”
“Looks like maybe you had a bigger audience than we thought,” Sam teased as Castiel bent his head towards Dean’s as they studied the picture that Frank and Marv had sent. In the woods, half-obscured by the trees stood a figure, dark and broad-shouldered, too far away to make out a face.
Now it was Dean’s turn to look smug as Castiel floundered for a response as he imagined having to come up with a story that wasn’t:
“Hey, I’m just grateful it’s not on your ass like usual,” Gabriel called after him with a laugh, earning himself a smack upside the head from Sam.
Dean was in love with him, too. Castiel was sure of it. It wasn’t just in the way that he took care of Cas when he was sick; he did the same for Sam. It wasn’t how he drove Castiel back and forth to work when his Continental finally shit the bed because Dean would do that for any of the people he considered family. That kind of generosity was just part of Dean’s personality.
“She just doesn’t want to have to deal with your hungover sasquatch ass in the morning,” Dean smirked.
“Yeah, anyway, the article says there was a Bigfoot sighting right near the campground we’re staying at.”
Since moving in with Gabriel, Castiel had started to carve out a routine for himself. Early mornings had him leaving the apartment above the Cafe and jogging the winding paths of dune grass to the Angel’s Bend Lighthouse, joyfully snapping photo after photo of white-capped waves breaking against the massive boulders outlining the structure. When seen from above, the pattern of jagged rock bending around the black and white beacon made the shadow of Angel’s wings, giving the small oceanside town its name. Although splitting the sale of the house with Daphne left Castiel in a position to not need to go back to work right away, he still did a five hour-shift Monday through Friday at
One of the worst fights had been when Dean had told Castiel he was leaving. Cas had felt abandoned and betrayed. They’d had plans. Dean would take over the auto-shop, and Cas would do the books. Looking back, Castiel should have seen it coming; when things had become serious with Daphne, things had changed. No more movie nights, or taking off for the weekend to go camping.  Dean always called him whipped, and accused him of just going along with whatever Daphne said. He supposed to a degree it was true. Castiel hadn’t believed he could have what he truly wanted in a relationship so he’d agreed to a blind date with Daphne. In her, he found someone who wasn’t necessarily longing for a physically intimate relationship, but an intellectual connection bloomed, and eventually led to deep affection.  Despite how chaste their relationship was, appearance was essential to Daphne, and it wasn’t long before his contact with Dean had been limited to holidays and rare times when they could meet for lunch.
Cas had spent most of the morning at the beach. He’d left Dean’s house early to join Sam and Rowena in Sunrise yoga, something they had tried to no avail to get Dean to participate in. Most recently, during dinner at
“Alright,” Gabriel said, clapping his hands when Dean and Castiel still hadn’t moved. “You two can eyefuck another time.”
Castiel absolutely did not pout when Dean shifted in his lap, and caused Castiel’s mouth to break it’s suction from his lover’s salty skin. Dean placed his beverage over Castiel’s shoulder onto the picnic table next to his, and looped his arms around Castiel’s neck.
It bothered Emmanuel that Dean had noticed she was gone. It bothered him more that his feelings for the man apparently turned him from a sexually confident adult to an insecure teen in his first relationship.
In the meantime, there were a plethora of other reasons Castiel wanted to be alone with Dean; the first one being the cliche way he made Cas’ heart gallop in his chest. Dean, throughout all of this, had made him feel confident in a way he never remembered being before. Dean was his to take care of, his to love unconditionally, because he did love, Dean. It was instinctual, as though his heart had muscle memory. How amazing and terrifying it was it to feel such complete and utter devotion to someone when all you had were photographs and a handful of stories and fractured memories?
“We’ll put out the fire,” Dean said, “You all go on inside. I think Cas wants to sit by the fire a little longer,” he said, reading him correctly.
“I’m two minutes out,” Castiel said grimly, refusing to believe that his husband wouldn’t be anything but fine.
“How did my dad go from someone as sweet and loving as my mom to some chick who looks like a slutty Halloween nurse?”
“Yes, because pushing him off at every college party was my secret way of seducing him,” Dean laughed but Castiel didn’t look amused. He never did where Michael was concerned.
Despite what Castiel said about not changing his mind or their profound bond or whatever, Dean had to be more realistic. If this whole relationship wound up going south for him, Dean wanted to be able to leave owing Cas nothing. He kept these thoughts to himself, of course, because any vague hints of them not working out always upset Castiel, and Dean was trying to do what the man had asked of him, to keep the faith and believe that good things do happen.
Dean blushed and stammered, and Sam guffawed loudly behind him as Emmanuel looked on with quiet amusement.
Castiel came to, with a gasp, jostling Dean, but not waking him. He was glad, not ready to divulge what he'd just been through, not prepared to acknowledge out loud to Dean that a spirit was out to get him,
“How the hell did I get here? “ Dean asked after drinking his fill. “The last thing I remember is being in the manor.”
Dean silently brought his husband a large mug of coffee as the lawyer droned on, squeezing Cas' shoulder as he sat on the other arm of the couch, allowing his man to lean against him. Despite the awkwardness between them, Dean was relieved that Cas was willing to take comfort from him. It was one thing to lose a grandparent, but to lose both within days? Dying of languishment Castiel had once called it, about some story they were reading in class. A fancy term meaning death by a broken heart. Dean couldn't even mock it, and he did not doubt that it would be like that with him and Castiel; despite any fights between them, Dean knew in his heart that neither of them could live without the other.
“Because you and Charlie are going clothes shopping and getting ready at her house. Then, you will come and pick me up, like a proper date,” Castiel said, as though it were self-evident.
Castiel gave a half-hearted shrug as he settled on to the barstool, hanging his trenchcoat on the hooks under the bar’s ledge.
“One more thing, before you take me home. Where is my wedding ring?” Castiel watched as a smile slowly bloomed on Dean’s face, radiant in its brilliance. Dean tugged a chain from around his neck. On it was a bronze amulet of the bull-man, a horned God. Alongside it hung a ring that matched Dean’s exactly — a wide silver band with a flat circle head, that was both understated and unique at the same time. Dean slipped the chain over his head and opened the clasp so he could remove the ring.
Those were the thoughts rolling through his head.  He’d talked about it over skype with his sister Hannah who suggested maybe Dean just didn’t want to ruin their friendship.
Dean unlocked the front door of his apartment and pushed open the door. His stomach growled when the scent of barbecue chicken pizza assaulted Dean’s senses. He didn’t need to peer into the living room to know that he’d find his roommate and best friend, Castiel, curled up on the couch with his bumble-bee blanket and an open box of Papa Formaggio's on the round, pine coffee table.
yeah, I’m going to listen to this. I’m going to believe every word that comes out of his mouth because Cas
Castiel knew what Dean was trying to say. He didn’t think he would last until Castiel opened him up and made him ready.
“Man, I gotta say, that sounds lonely,” Dean said sympathetically and Emmanuel nodded. “Were you an army brat?”
Emmanuel feathered his fingers through Dean’s hair, then gently trailed down his cheekbone and lingered on his scruff.  “You cannot save everyone, my friend.”
, Emmanuel let himself enjoy his evening with Dean. They wound up at Benny’s restaurant, Dean having called ahead and scoring them an outside table overlooking the water. True to his word, Emmanuel bought Dean a white rose from one of the waitstaff moving from table to table, earning himself a lingering kiss over his lobster bisque. The view was spectacular, sun sparkling over the water making it shimmer like diamonds. Then he looked at Dean, eyes bright and soft, playful smile about his pretty mouth, and decided he outshone the glittering water a million times over.
They were taking it slow, per Dean’s unspoken request. Castiel was okay with that, though he couldn’t deny being eager to take the next step, sexually. Not that they hadn’t been intimate. After their clandestine bathroom adventure, there was no putting the genie back in the bottle. Not when Castiel knew what Dean looked like when he came, or the way his hands felt on Cas’ body. No, neither one of them was willing to give that up.
Emmanuel searched Dean’s eyes, hoping to convey understanding with his own. “We’re all a little fucked up sometimes, aren’t we?”
that Dean wasn’t going out with Max—whatever the fuck that had meant—and despite the sparks, Cas hadn’t said anything like that since. Any late-night fantasies of a sudden life-changing New Year’s kiss never happened either as Cas and Jo had gotten trashed playing old school Mario Kart. The only kiss he got was the slobbery one Jo left on his cheek.
“Rowena, please, dear. Ms. Macleod is much too formal,” her voice practically purred, and Castiel heard Charlie and Kevin snicker behind them.
“Hey, Becky?” Charlie interrupted the girl’s monologue, as Dean had apparently lost his inability to think beyond the words
“Our bedrooms faced each other, you know? We used to sneak in and out of each other's rooms at night. The first time it happened we got in trouble, but by the dozenth or so time, our families began leaving the outside lights on. Sometimes Becky would wake up to an extra body for breakfast, sometimes it was my mom’s turn.”
, despite both of their experience.  No words were spoken as strong fingers massaged scalps with cheap 2-in-1 Pert Plus.
"And you underestimate how quickly I will put this bullet in your brain if you don't release my husband."
would come, but this moment, inhaling Dean's spicy sandalwood and leather scent, indulging in languorous afternoon kisses, was perfection.
“—I’m so, so sorry! I haven’t been spying on you, I swear. Well, not really. It’s just, I had no idea you were the same person! Not until after that day at the warehouse, and you were tied up in that chair—”
Castiel said he was an early riser during the week, often going running or doing sunrise yoga before starting his day, and Dean, a well-known bear before he’d had his first, maybe even second, cup of coffee, had given a full-body shudder at the idea of being up so early on purpose. Dean had shared that he was a High School English teacher and his day usually started at six-thirty in which he’d shower and hit the coffee shop down the street from the apartment for a large black dark roast and an apple turnover, which was basically pie you could hold in your hand, and pie, was Dean’s greatest weakness.
“You’re adorable when you squint your eyes at me like that,” Dean said and Castiel rolled them in response. “ Well for one, if it at any time somebody else comes along that sparks your interest, you have to be open to it.”
“You can always stay with us, Sam. Pretty sure Cas and I are gonna be shacking up anyway,” Dean said with a wink at his new boyfriend.
It was fun and messy and kind of therapeutic. He got the appeal. Squishing the mixture between his fingers and rolling it around until it all mixed well together. Emmanuel could picture Dean as a young boy, working out his aggression, made in spicy oatmeal cookie dough.  Emmanuel glanced at Dean and saw that he was getting out a large baking sheet and pre-heating the oven.
Something flashed in Jimmy’s eyes, tenderness, warmth, before the blinds came down again. “I just need some air. See you out there.”
“Oh my God, Dean, did you get married?” The question was shrieked and Dean winced, pulling the phone back from his ear.
Dean flushed, glad he couldn’t be seen. Castiel’s bluntness was both a curse and a blessing. Dean was always an awkward mix of embarrassed and turned on when Castiel made such bold declarations.
Dean’s fingers scrambled for purchase on the railing, leaning forward again when Cas began to pull back out and groaning at the drag of his cock against Dean's walls, before he thrust back into his body. Castiel relished in the moment, peppering Dean's freckled shoulders with kisses, punching in slow to start, then gathering speed.
," the words were barely a whisper, a litany of teary relief falling from Cas' mouth and pressed into Dean's throat.  Dean realized his teeth were chattering, and everyone around him was talking, little bits of conversation filtering in. He wondered where Charlie and Kevin were.
The door burst open with a loud clap, startling Castiel upright on his barstool. To her credit, Ellen didn’t even flinch; just continued to polish her glasses behind the bar, with a quirk to her lips and a roll of her eyes. In fact, as Castiel looked around, he couldn’t help but observe that no one had even seemed to pause at the disturbance. They just continued eating, bobbing their heads to the music playing unobtrusively in the background. Meanwhile, the most attractive man Castiel had arguably ever laid eyes on, stood in the doorway, dressed in chainmail, hand held high holding what looked like a prop sword. The stretchy material of his pants clung to beautifully bowed legs, and Castiel thought he looked as though he’d just left a renaissance fair.
Castiel's mouth kicked up at that, a little barely-there smile light melted Dean's heart every time he saw it.
"Alright, fine, since you won't let me seduce you tonight," Dean huffed out a laugh at the petulance in Castiel's voice, "then tell me more about yourself. What's the stupidest thing you've ever done?"
“Touch yourself,” Castiel ordered, and he groaned when Dean automatically spat in his hand and grabbed his cock. Cas threw his head back as he allowed himself to focus solely on plunging into Dean’s greedy hole. The wet sound of Dean jerking himself only spurned Cas on, and his own moans turned reedy and high pitched in a way that only happened during sex. Dean said it was his favorite sound, and Castiel hoped he was enjoying it now.
“Well, with this lovely weather, it’s unlikely we’ll see anyone aside from Miss Mildred hitting up the place today”. Mildred Baker was a sweet old woman with the heart of a cougar. It took a lot to make Dean Winchester blush but damned if that sassy woman didn’t make him do it.
With only Sam, Rowena, Gabriel, Charlie, and Meg in attendance, they married under the setting sun. Charlie, quite good with a camera herself, filmed the ceremony, and stills from the video were hanging up in their house. Despite Dean’s certainty that Castiel would be itching to pick up a camera, he couldn’t have been more wrong. His new husband had to be within touching distance from him the whole evening; from the ceremony to the small reception in Castiel’s church function room, to their honeymoon, Castiel’s hands and intimate gaze never left his body.
It was late Saturday afternoon when they pulled into the Novak’s driveway in Pontiac, and it was no surprise that his parents were waiting for them out on their Farmer’s porch. Castiel felt a rush of love as his parents stood there, his dad’s arm slung across his mother’s slight shoulders. Anna Novak’s deep red hair was pulled back in a bun, and she wore a yellow summer dress that was embroidered with daisies.
“Did it ever occur to you to try going on a date? Maybe attempting to find someone new? Castiel sure doesn’t seem to have a problem, ” Cole said and Castiel felt a pang in his chest as Dean’s whole body seemed to flinch at the words.  Castiel moved closer, watching as Cole angled his lawn chair towards Dean and the predatory look in Cole’s eyes had realization dawning.
“Fair enough,” Dean murmured silky, before claiming Cas’ lips in another drugging kiss, taking his hands in his calloused ones, pulling Castiel from the room. His heart felt as light as a cloud when Dean tugged him down the hallway and into his bedroom, pushing the angel onto the plush memory foam. They took their time undressing with soft caresses and long looks of love. And when Castiel received Dean into his body,  their eyes locked and reverent on each other until they each crested, breaking like waves on the shore.
Standing up, Dean stretched. Castiel stood in front of him, barely a foot separating the pair, and he couldn’t help but notice that he was only about an inch shorter than Dean’s 6’1 frame.
“Dean? Where are you guys?” Sam let out a shriek when Dean suddenly appeared on the path in front of him.
, did he like the sound of that. He was going home with Dean and he was going to take the gorgeous man apart and slowly put him back together again. It took longer than it should have to reach the apartment; constant stops for slick, wet kisses, aiding in the extra time.
It had been a bitter pill to swallow, but no one listened to him the way Cas did; no one made him feel important enough to look beyond his pretty face, and he wasn’t giving that up just because he was stupid enough to trip in some feelings.
“You don’t need that shit, Cassie. What you need is a fresh start,” Gabriel said, voice muffled by what Castiel was sure was a confection of some kind. His cousin Gabriel was the black sheep of the family-or was, before Castiel’s big gay bombshell. He ran a specialty cafe in Coastal Massachusetts called
“When we saw your sweetheart,” Rowena explained, “Sam asked about the man he was talking to. Your brother offended Castiel by asking him if he had said yes to the drink invitation. He was adamant in his denial. “
," fell from Castiel’s lips as the friction against his trapped cock and the constant pressure on his prostate had him coming hard between them, without warning. The orgasm felt endless as his whole body shook like a leaf in a storm. As Castiel slumped forward, he tugged at Dean’s earlobe with his teeth.
