To Sherlock’s utter surprise, he recognises it immediately: his own face covers the screen – it is the video for
It finally dawned on John that after all they had gone through, Sherlock still feared John would leave him.
love me too.” John knows the game is up, and there’s no backtracking his confession. There’s no way to go other than let this unravel.
The three men stand in silence for a short while. John is jittery but there is something very off about how Mycroft is reacting. He is usually a practical man, eloquent and efficient – but he’s now standing speechless and
He takes the cobblestone walkway to the door, past a van from a home improvement company, its back doors wide open and spilling assorted construction materials. He rings the doorbell, noticing the front door is ajar. He’s about to push the door open when an elderly lady wearing an apron over a floral dress appears in a cloud of spicy perfume and something vaguely related to baking. Behind her, there’s the hustle and bustle of what seems to be some renovation or redecoration work.
Victor’s smile falters ever so slightly but he does take the seat. “It is also a social visit, Sherlock. Although I do admit I had no idea if you would want to see me.”
A man – Mycroft – standing disinterestedly against a wall, scrolls through his mobile and doesn’t raise his eyes to answer: “Yes, wonderful.”
“In a sense, yes. Just about to solve a case. Embezzlement. Something is missing, though.” Sherlock casts a distracted glance at the wall, then focuses back his attention on Ellie. “I did not think you were the type to take random holidays out of season.”
Here, in the evening quiet of his rooms, he can hold a bow rosined to perfection and glide it over four taut strings without thinking about whether or not what comes out of the instrument is the stuff for his next pop hit. And so he does; playing the violin helps him think, and today it’s bits from Tchaikovsky’s Violin Concerto in D major that help his thoughts flow and float idly through and around him. He needs this today, because today is different.
John releases his hold on Sherlock’s wrist to press the small of his back, tugging them closer until they are chest to chest, and they both shudder.
It must have taken John perhaps thirty seconds, tops, to get to Sherlock after he fell from the stage, but to John it felt like forever and a day. He had elbowed and pushed through the crowd until he could get his hands on Sherlock and drag the man out of that hellish mess. At that point, John was beyond caring about appearances and possible murderers – it was clear Sherlock was panicking at the loss of control over the situation. It had all happened in the blink of an eye, from that deviant invading the stage to Sherlock’s fall. Seeing him being submerged in a sea of people prompted John to shake off his panic and go get Sherlock.
John puts down his tea mug. “There are things that are not quantifiable, Sherlock. Not everything can be measured with science.”
They break the kiss for some air. “John,” Sherlock whispers against his lips, “you look quite dashing.” He resumes his petting of John’s hair, seemingly lost in thought. “Some people call this wisdom.”
John throws himself onto the empty seat next to Mycroft and slams the door closed with more violence than necessary. “Whatever the hell you have to say, do it quickly. I am tired, I want to go home, I don’t want to see your face.”
A week passes, then another. There had been a phone call with the results from the CT scan: a five-millimetre distal stone, close to the bladder, had been identified as the culprit, and a referral sent to urology at St Mary’s. There had been fortunately no new crippling pain attacks, but it is obvious Sherlock is not comfortable. From the little John can pull out of him, he understands Sherlock has basically pain every time he urinates, and that most days there is spasmodic pain, although manageable with NSAIDs. John keeps an eye on how much and how often Sherlock takes them, and they develop a habit of not leaving home without painkillers. He places glasses of water and cups of tea near Sherlock and makes sure he drinks them.
Sherlock also gets up albeit a bit more stiffly and shakes his head. “Not necessary, I’ll manage. I think the pain has receded a bit.” He bites his lower lip, suddenly shy and a bit embarrassed. “Thank you, John. It’s… you’ve helped.”
Sherlock halts, clenching a chef’s knife midair. He’s in the manor’s main kitchen, chopping fruit with unnecessary violence before throwing it all into a blender. Mrs Hudson tuts at the mess – there are pieces of apple and banana everywhere – but otherwise keeps quiet while she hustles around the room.
Unfortunately, John interprets the silence as a license to continue talking. “Um. About what we talked earlier…” John rubs an embarrassed hand over his nape.
but this time it was a tiled wall in a dingy ally, not the wallpapered one of Baker Street, it was a cold wall covered in slime and October rain, no smileys or bullet holes, there could not be bullet holes because his gun had disappeared, probably Greg or bloody Mycroft being his usual nosey self, thinking he’d be safer, the bastard,
“Tut tut,” Mycroft continues, “the man cares for you but is terrified. Trust issues, I suppose. Quite interesting, as he seems to be nearly fearless otherwise. But when it comes to you…to the perspective of
Ever since Sherlock returned from the dead, everybody seems to be even more acquiescent of his madness. It did not take long for Lestrade to invite him to crime scenes, as the one they are standing around now, or even to abandon an operation because His Royal Freakiness texted him about some crap, as when they were about to arrest the Waters family. Like a

John looks up from his book in confusion. Sherlock is a whirlwind of scarf and Belstaff and reaching for John to lift him from his armchair. “Uh, is there a case?”
Sherlock hums, sets his cup down and rises from the armchair, taking a slow stroll across the room. He walks past the telly and slides a finger over the slim top. He rubs his fingertips feeling the collected dust, then skims a sideboard and halts his hand over the knob of a drawer. John straightens his spine and holds his breath as Sherlock opens the drawer and removes its only contents: a gun. More specifically, his Sig Sauer, a not quite legal souvenir from his time in Afghanistan; somehow, in the midst of his hurried discharge, the possession of this particular piece had not been noticed.
John slumps exhausted into his blessed soft armchair and observes his friend while he launches himself into some sort of demented medley arranged for strings.
<< Yeah >> Sherlock nods. << Mycroft constantly tells me what to do and continually discredits me, but he is not crazy. John fucks me and then tells me it was a mistake, but he is not crazy. No >> Sherlock whispers with a soft growl. << The 'crazy' is me who wants to be free to express myself. I who fell in love with that idiot! >>.
<< Now let's calm down everyone, ok? >> Greg thunders and although they are still shaken, both boys nod dumbfounded. Greg takes the chair reserved for customers and John brings into the living room the two chairs of the kitchen table . The three Lestrade sit one on the right, the other on the left and the father in the center.
"I'm not dead yet," Sherlock thinks, as he tries to rub the frozen and bare limbs. A painful grasp harps his stomach, causing him to vomit at almost regular intervals.
<< Who am I talking about? >> John repeats, laughing. << I'm talking about the person you held captive in the storage room on the first floor. Of the one who played the violin for you in the second floor room. I'm talking about the owner of what was once a blue scarf >> he says, flapping the shred of fabric under her nose.
<< I felt replaced, Sherlock. From a professional, moreover, against which I certainly cannot compete >>.
John shakes his head, giving up. He sees that Sherlock and William's smiles are similar and a strange squeeze in the heart fills him with emotion.
From the moment John grabbed the Sherlock's phone number reports, just sent by Mycroft, that investigation passed to him ex officio, one might say. John was investigating the disappearance of the consulting detective and now he inherited the case he was working on. Mary Abbott is linked to this case and Sherlock seems to have her at heart, for a reason that is not known and that, at this moment, is not even important.
<< Ok, ok, take him with you >> says Greg, massaging his temples. << I'll wait for you in Cardiff at this address >> he says, giving them a ticket. << Don't wast your time please! Have mercy on me >> Greg adds going out.
<< A friend told me that Daisy couldn't stand Rosaline. In fact, with the excuse of being the master's pupil, she was doing enough >>.
<< Moriarty? The crazy dynamiter who staged that game just for you last month? >> Greg asks Sherlock, who nods slowly. << Sherlock had lost his tracks after almost blowing you up in the pool >> Greg says turning to John. << And now we find him behind a site to lure kids. My God ... your fans are scary, Sherlock >> Greg chuckles nervously. << How do you plan to move? >>.
<< I didn't know that Captain Watson was a quiet person >> Fox replies, looking at John seriously. He absently takes his left hand to grab his right wrist and John quickly understands the reason for the discussion between Sherlock and the punk in the alley. The consultant mentions a gesture of refusal with his head to Fox, which, in response, look at John even more hard.
<< Mr Ford riped off the sheet of paper from Ms Ford's hand, rolled it up and threw it into the fire. Ms Ford screamed and tried to take it >> the woman freezes, her lips tight to draw a white line.
He can't finish the sentence. Something hits Kelly in the head. The woman has only time to make a weak 'ah' before falling to the ground. The child barely has time to move away before that Kelly falls over him. Morgan puts himself between William and the skinny woman, armed with a baseball bat, standing in the doorway.
<< Exactly >> John nods, examining a 'parrot' and the basins from which the stench of disinfectant intensely spreads. << It comes, however, only from two rooms. This and that >> says, pointing to the other closed door. << And, coincidentally, the grooves on the carpet lead to these rooms >> he adds, leaving the bathroom to go to the closed door. John grab the handle, but the door is locked. The wood is very damaged, as if it had suffered violent attacks. John's heart beats strongly at the idea that Sherlock may be in there and, without thinking twice, opens it with a shoulder (which although he used his right side, does not like much to his left shoulder, but they are negligible details, at the moment).
Sherlock, however, does not feel it. He continues to stare at the void. That bastard took advantage of the victim's unwell condition and also his own. This is how it works. He should be there to help those who do not react well to the Aufguss and instead take advantage of them, and then leave them stunned and upset in the locker room.
<< Good boy who finished all the food >> she cheerful chirps, rising from the chair. She takes the tray and goes to the door. << Given the huuuuungher you have, double portions for you tonight >> she chuckles, heading to the door. The woman turns abruptly and her face returns hard and expressionless. << It was to your liking, right? >> asks him and the consultant nods.
<< But it is so, Dad >> she says, holding on to his arms. << She was with him when ... she was not here when ... we were alone George and I and if he had not been here ... >> the sobs have the upper hand, while Greg looks at her terrified by what she has not told him.
<< But I fear that glory will have to be limited to this >> Fox adds, giving Sherlock a sever look. A look very similar to the ones John used to shoot, the doctor notes and his stomach aches again. Sherlock snorts, and they seem to speak again without saying a word.
"Only for this?" his sister's voice mischievously asks. No, obviously it's not just for this. John invited at home the first woman he had wooed in the first weeks spent on Baker Street. John remembers all too well the way she looked at Sherlock. The smiles she gave him and her flirting with Sherlock with impunity, despite his presence.
<< I don't understand the meaning of a porno movie. What do you do with it if you can only watch them? I mean, finding yourself in a similar situation is a thing, but to watch ... what's the use? >>.
"Really immature attitude" spits acid the voice of his father. The one that hurts him, among all the voices that populate his head.
<< Not directly >> he replies, leaving Sherlock speechless. << In the sauna there is a service door that leads to the massage room. To get to the changing rooms you should go from there, exit the corridor and then access the changing rooms >>.
<< Are you planning to cut it out of your life? >> Mycroft asks him directly. Sherlock sighs. He realizes that the time has come to really face what happened and above all what he feels. He walked around it in the days spent segregated in that house and even while he was there to freeze in that pit. Now he can no longer remain in the safe place which is his Mind Palace.
<< And in your logic a quarrel, in this case, follows an attempted violence? >> growls John and does not even know why he is getting angry like that.
“Could be that she will castrate you. In the other way, coul be that she will cut off one of your hands. Or maybe both. For better or for worse, obviously it is at your discretion to choose which option to place them in, little brother! ”.
<< Mary !! >> cries in the face of a nascent panic. He pushing aside the sheets, ready to get out of bed and who cares about the leg in traction, the pain, the reproaches on Mary's part, too.
"For the people, are 'crazy' those that are capable of doing what they do not have the courage to act", Moriarty points out now, reappearing in his thoughts. "You are capable to observe and for this reason you are 'mad'. You use drugs and that's why you're 'crazy'. You don't eat or sleep to keep up with your cases and that's why you're 'crazy'. You like men and that's why you're 'crazy'. You are denying the voices of your brother and Johnny-boy and for this you are 'mad'. "
<< I think it is better that I go >> he says, getting up from the sofa on which they sat down, after a day spent outside the city, with the only positive note of having escaped the bad downpour that hit London.
Lestrade looks at him for a long time. His eyes reduced to two slits, as if he wanted to focus better on the desperate man who took the place of his friend.
<< Yeah >> he sighs, passing his hand over his tired face. << Well, then we just have to start the game, as Sherlock always says >>.
<< In the storage room, downstairs, I found scratches on the inside of the door. There, too, great and meticulous cleaning was done >> John informs him, clenching his fists.
<< To my dolls. I have five of them in my bedroom and they listen to me and make the nightmare go away >>.
<< Mr detective, my dad was kidnap, so I am the landlord no. Do you know? >> William retorts, putting the hands to his hips. This time also John joins Sherlock's spontaneous laughter. Kelly's reproach falls on deaf ears.
<< No. But I'll explain everything when I finish the investigation. I await what I have asked for as soon as possible! >>.
<< A very, very dangerous individual that you and Sherlock had the opportunity to meet a short time ago >> replies the man, articulating the words well.
<< Are you trying to tell me that my death would make you suffer? >> Sherlock chuckles in an attempt to break the embarrassment caused by the words of his brother.
"Now I recognize you!" Moriarty applauds, appearing behind him. “Too bad it's too late, Sherlock. You were wrong again, my friend. "
<< Yeah >> sighs Sherlock, placing his cheek against John’s cheek. << We can't go further >> he whispers.
<< Shall we go? >> asks him, but the puppy stay still on the consultant's outstretched hand. John scratches his head, wondering how to make himself understood. He try to take the leash and shows it to the puppy. He jumps happy out of bed and trots towards him. << Good boy >> John encourages him. He reply barks cheerfully.
"This is what we are" he thinks enraptured by the rapid movement of the larvae. “Minds trapped in a means of transport, destined to become food for necrophagous insects. What's the point of all this? " he asks himself, getting up.
<< No, Alfred! >> the woman shouts to her husband. << Stop continuing to repeat it! I felt it ... adolescence and the most intimate issues and all the other nonsense with which you came out every time I pointed out the thing had nothing to do with it. We should have faced her and asked her the reason for that sudden change and maybe ... maybe >> she shuts up, returning to press her hand against her lips. She closes her eyes in a silent cry. The husband, standing a few steps away from her, breathes heavily. John sees in the small distance the crack that will affect their relationship.
<< He found someone able to stand up to him, finally >> Margaret says hard. Her husband calls her back and she ignores him. William barely turns to his father before turning his amazed gaze to the mother. He has never seen her so determined.
<< If I want it? Oh, Lord, you can't even imagine >> Sherlock says, barely holding back the tears. John lets go of laughter, one of those laden with satisfaction and pure joy. A laugh that has the effect of warming his now lighter belly. John brings his hand to caress the pale cheek of his consulting detective. With the same fluid gesture of Fox he brings Sherlock's amezed face closer to his. But it is not on Sherlock's forehead that he wants to put a kiss. John brushes Sherlock's lips, parted with surprise. He caresses them with his, feeling Sherlock gradually respond to the kiss.
<< ... you miss him >> Sherlock concludes in his place. << If it weren't for him we would still be here pretending to be great friends and excellent colleagues >> he says, bouncing the ball on the floor and then catching it on the fly.
<< Obviously, the invitation is also extended to your adorable dog. It was good that Morgan was with Billy. I want't imagine how it would have ended, otherwise >>.
<< Yes, John. Sherlock glared at me when I asked him the same thing. You should agree on how to educate the dog. Otherwise he will get confused and everything will be more difficult >>.
"Me too" John would like to reply, but he realizes that he would only make a slim figure. He has no idea what the things Mycroft is referring to. It cannot therefore make a comparison. And even if he could, this wouldn't ease his guilt. He acted like an asshole. As a great asshole. And selfish too. And yes, Sherlock didn't deserve it. It may deserve many things, given his character, but not this. No.
<< You are here! >> John exclaims. He strokes the distance from the door to the bed on which Sherlock is sitting and stops a few steps away from him.
<< Yes. To register I had to answer a long series of questions and pass a selection. They said it was for privacy reasons >>.
<< Luckily I'm the one who exaggerated with the words >> retorts the chief commissioner, turning his scornful look to John.
<< What is it, Morgan? >> Sherlock asks and the puppy turns to look at him barking only once. << Search! >> Sherlock orders him and Morgan snaps on the stairs. Sherlock, John and Greg rush after him. Morgan scratches the door of one of the rooms at the end of the corridor. Sherlock opens it and the dog come inside. The consultant follows him, gesturing to John and Greg to stay in the doorway.
<< Cardiac arrest >> the doctor answers. << We could be sure of this after the autopsy, of course, but I can say he died following a cardiac arrest >>.
<< Do you have news from Sky on the portal? >> Sherlock asks. The man brings his hand to his right ear and lets out a curse in Spanish .
John can't be indifferent to this umpteenth sardonic laugh. He grab the cop for the collar of the jacket with such force that he can be lifted off the ground and pushed against a tree. The impact is such that some snowdrifts fall from the branches and dust their jackets.
<< To fatherhood, you say? No. I never cared to sign that irrevocable and indefinite contract >> he says, looking sideways at his man. << You? >>.
<< Of course I understand it. But it does matter to me, Sherlock, I have a reputation to maintain >>.
<< I never asked you if you think like him about it >> he asks him just by glancing at him. Sherlock discovers he can't handle his brother's gaze right now.
That was how Mycroft, Hataway and everyone else had found him. John had barely noticed their presence. Di Mycroft, who had approached him, trying in turn to warm his brother's still cold body with his own coat.
The director moistens his lips and, in an unequivocal gesture of anxiety, passes the handkerchief to wipe his broad forehead.
<< You! Small sack of fleas >> screams, trying to grab Morgan. She turns on herself, the dog hanging on a buttock and intent on not giving up. Sharon grabs the dog by the tail, trying to tear him away, but a hand takes her by the neck and brings her to know very closely the same wall against which the puppy launched earlier.
<< You have been very good, little, really very good >> says, caressing Morgan's nose, dirty with Sharon's blood. The little dog crouches against him and closes his exhausted eyes.
<< Let me ask you the same question in a few hours, when we have delivered that asshole to Lestrade >>.
"Keep going, Sherlock," John tells him. At this time even in the John's tone of annoying voice he hears the worry vibrate.
<< Have you heard, Mycroft? This is the truth >> the father mocks him. Mr Holmes, however, does not find the support of his older son for his laughter. << I'll tell you what the truth is! >> explodes, standing up, this time, before clapping his hands on the precious wood. << The truth is that I should have killed you when I had the chance. I would not find myself now having a son who continues to throw mud on my family's good name and who squanders my money by buying drugs to 'stop his mind too fast'! As if the scandal that you and Trevor have been done four years ago was not enough already, >> he adds, beating another blow that vibrates, also in Sherlock's chest. << From today you will no longer receive anything from me, William, nothing! I think you are perfectly capable of obtaining from you what you need for that scum poison. On the other hand what could I expect from you? You are a whore, just like your mother >>.
<< One in two is already a success >> Sherlock says, placing a kiss on the sweaty forehead of the child. William throws his arms around Sherlock's neck.
The first authentic expression of sadness. An anguished child's pout. The lower lip begins to tremble, but Mary squints hard and when she opens them she is happy again.
<< Because Mr Ford comes back home very late and vents his anger after dinner, John >> Sherlock says, taking the women by surprise. << The fired maid gave many details in the interview that she released. Mr Ford humiliate his wife and his son
Sherlock feels himself exhausted. He has never eaten so much and he is afraid of vomiting everything.
John clenches his fists and tries to stay calm. Mycroft's hand rests on his shoulder and John is amazed at the calming effect that that simple gesture can have on him. Mycroft says nothing. He just squeeze John's shoulder before withdrawing his hand. The phone rings and the inspector does not let him arrive on the second ring. He mutters a few monosyllables before hanging up.
“Of course, John,” his eyes still locked on the small girl. Not so small now, not as small she was last time he saw her, when she was learning her first steps. She’s silent now, holding the plushie by its ears and ignoring her surroundings.
He could despise John for being the cause of the heartbreak (obvious) but it is all a confluence of unfortunate events, in the end. Mycroft hurts too, for him, for the unfairness of it all. The only thing he can do is the usual same – to be there for his brother.
John tries to catch Irene’s attention but the music is too loud and her eyes riveted on the scene. He picks up his phone and watches her answer on the second tone: “Irene, go and find Victor and the MC, tell them to cut the music.” He disconnects, rings Molly and as soon as he hears her answer he shouts, “Get the car!
John closes his eyes and groans. What a mess. He has seen pretty grisly threats to some of the people he has worked for – that being why he’d worked for them in the first place – but the sheer volume of macabre correspondence being thrown at Sherlock is sickening. His alarm bells are ringing – the problem here is more than providing a close eye on the client. He almost feels like this was reason enough to reconsider his decision to walk out of the house and look for another job. He ignores the small voice in his head telling him his reasons to reconsider have less to do with general care for a celebrity than with a pair of sea-coloured eyes reading into his soul. Still…
Sherlock is petrified in his seat. There is probably something socially acceptable he should be replying, but his insides twist and turn, torn between hurt and… and. And whatever he feels for this man that fills him with an undefined warmth. But he cannot be weak. Not now, not when he was recovering, gluing back pieces of his broken self, gaining back his ground and his self-respect, one bee colony, one planted vegetable, one cross-pollinated flower at a time. His heart squeezes with the need to open his arms and accept John’s apology; his carefully constructed new life is telling him to not jeopardize the precarious equilibrium he has found in this corner of England.
Instead, he put on his professional persona and answered Sherlock. “Ah, that particular model is only sixteen pounds. Very sturdy one, rigid but with good give. Easy to clean, too.”
Molly, good, reliable Molly had perfectly understood his anxious order and had driven the limo not to the arranged official pick-up point but rather to the spot just outside one of the less visible emergency exits, one that only her and John knew about. Irene was left behind – she was pissed off at him, but he could live with that.
Something ugly and heavy curls in John’s stomach. He leans over the desk placing his palms flat against the surface in an undeniable threatening pose.
The two men take their chairs in front of the hearth. John mulls a bit about options. “There’s some medication that could help. But, Sherlock, I’m still not comfortable in prescribing it myself, and it would be good to get new lab work before–”
“I still have the gun I shot you with.” She disappears onto the landing and down the stairs. I hear the thud of the door closing.
“Hmm, maybe so.” John smooths a hand up Sherlock’s body and lands it on his face, a thumb swiping gently on his cheekbone. “But I could still sense your brain working a bit extra. What’s on your mind?”
I also want to thank you all so much for the enthusiastic reception to this story so far - I hope you continue to enjoy it!
Sherlock allows himself to relish in the small touch and in the intimacy of the moment. In a minute or so, he will gather the courage to close the gap between them, searching John’s eyes to find out that yes, it is a feeling reciprocated. But for now, he lets the newfound peace blanket them, give them a foundation to work on, fill the silence with warmth and harmony.
John glances down at his feet. He’s dressed in jeans, a checkered shirt and a wool suit jacket, and a pair of brown penny loafers. Although not quite made for jogging, John chose these shoes because they are comfortable and allow him to sprint if necessary.
“Yes. Left side. Cramping like hell. Or throbbing. Whatever.” He swallows heavily, words coming out in a ragged exhale. “Took 400 mg ibuprofen an hour ago, which was as effective as a sugar pill.” He gets up and starts walking around the living-room again.
Inside, the letter rests still on the kitchen table. The contents? Probably a rehash of the endless cycle of hate and regret that marked Sherlock’s last months on Baker Street. Why open it and make real the words that cut through Sherlock’s chest, deeper than Mary’s bullet? At least that pain had been quantifiable, justifiable, understandable.
“Christmas is always a bit hectic, and London is less expensive this time of the year, so… it’s nice to take a few relaxing days off. You should try it, Sherlock.” Ellie smirks, predicting an eye-roll.
John sighs. “Let me put the kettle on. Might as well have some bloody tea if we’re not going back to sleep.”
There could have been multiple ways to finish this conversation. Sherlock, however, chooses the one that, for once, he truly wants, by closing the gap and laying a soft kiss on John’s lips. A kiss that is reciprocated, a kiss filled with promises, with
commemorations. For example, he insists on going out for a slice of cake on my birthday. One would think that after the excesses of Christmastide, cake would be the last thing on one’s mind in early January. But this seems to be of little importance to John, who will always make sure I do not go uncelebrated.
, John. I doubt you are acquainted with the concept.” Sherlock oozes past the two men and into the limo without a word, and Victor follows him.
She drops this bomb in such a nonchalant fashion I briefly think I misheard her. John, in love with someone else? It is true that he is trudging along in a loveless marriage for the sake of ensnaring Mary in a tight trap, one she can finally not escape from — ah. John is unable to carry on the deception, to a level Mary suspects he is having an affair.
Sherlock looks back at him with a frown. “I don’t need to run after Victor Trevor, John. My life is fulfilling as it is now. I have the work and I have–” Sherlock snaps his mouth shut.
Sherlock seems to finally acknowledge John is in the same room and replies with a meek ‘yes’ and a lift of his hips from the bed. John swallows and clears his throat, reaches for Sherlock’s fly and unzips it; the top button is gone, probably lost in the commotion at the Mayan. He tugs the shorts and whatever is left of those ridiculous fishnet tights down Sherlock’s long legs and helps him into the soft pyjamas trousers.
Mycroft’s question is interrupted by the shatter of a windowpane and a splatter of blood from his shoulder.
How many ways can you tell yourself a lie? John – the real John – thinks Sherlock is dead. The radio silence after the last blog post spoke mountains; there was nothing more of interest to tell about their life together, because that had ceased to exist. And so, Sherlock concludes that John has probably moved on, forgotten about him. Maybe Sherlock is just a fond memory, or–
It turns out there is no need for a phone call, as Sherlock receives a letter in the mail that same day. With an appointment for a new CT scan. Three weeks away.
He thinks about the physical letter John sent months ago. Why is he still resisting opening it? He mulls over something John said, or rather let slip, when he was stammering his apologies:
“Molly, I am sorry for overreacting.” He can see the surprise on her face at his apology — does he really do this that seldom? “I do appreciate your support and friendship.”
As John was rewarded with a smile, he leaned in for a kiss. And Sherlock reciprocated and kissed his troubles away, the day’s events dissolving into unimportant past.
Sherlock picks a dumpling, swipes it on the sweet and sour sauce, and shoves the whole thing into his mouth. The scallop dumpling is silky and unctuous against his palate, the delicate shell giving way to an explosion of spices. It pairs exquisitely with the sharp sauce. He then picks a pork rib and closes his eyes in bliss as his teeth sink into the tender texture of the meat, his tongue picking up the sweetness of the black bean sauce.
Sherlock nuzzles his nose on John’s hair. They are spread on Sherlock’s bed, and John is idly dozing on Sherlock’s chest, arms around his waist. Sherlock has one arm around John’s back and is drawing nonsensical patterns with his fingertips along John’s spine and shoulder blades, which elicits contented sighs from his sleepy lover.
“Wat… oh, um, Rosie is staying with Stella and Ted, didn’t want to bring her in case…” He lets the sentence unfinished, the ellipsis completed in Sherlock’s head:
Sherlock is not expecting answers. He lashes out at John because it’s his only possible reaction to this invasion. He flails himself open, his chest emotionally scarred, a brotherhood of blood with the healed physical scars on his back. He is sure this will be the point where John will get up and leave, out into the rainstorm, or shout back, or anything equally violent and emotional, and
“Is the lack of discipline from your clients the reason you don’t stay long with them? Oh, don’t look at me like that, it’s obvious,” Sherlock adds quickly as John widens his eyes and opens his mouth to protest.
“I was reviewing the front gate’s CCTV footage,” Irene replies, “and spotted the same Land Rover driving by several times per day. The number plate was clearly visible.”
is the creaking on some of the seventeen steps leading up to the flat; the smell of heavy draperies, the fire in the hearth staving off the chill of a late February evening; and above all, the presence of Sherlock, perhaps reading in his chair, sitting at his microscope or plucking his violin.
“I’m right here in front of you, Sherlock!” John tries to sound exasperated, but the fact is he is pleased Sherlock is out of his reverie. He loves evenings like these, where they can both get down from the high of solving a tough case with quiet moments and small talk. And so, John’s exasperation ends up sounding much like fondness.
“Brother mine,” Mycroft patiently explains for the umpteenth time, “I am not perishing from this wound. I just need to recover my strength and heal enough to be able to travel. In the meantime, I am well cared for here. You, on the other hand, must prepare for the Grammys.”
John senses this is no time for questions. Instead, he rearranges limbs to the best of his abilities, shuffles so he’s sitting on the cold, hard floor, and hugs Sherlock, lays Sherlock’s head onto his shoulder, and allows him to weep. John rubs one comforting hand between Sherlock’s shoulder blades and the other through his curls. He is lost, unable to do more for his friend until he calms down and explains what caused this state of bereavement.
Yeah, okay, maybe his comment about fucking half of the hotel had been out of place. But Sherlock is so
John allows himself a brief squeeze on Sherlock’s wrist, a reassuring gesture that says ‘I’m here,’ and leaves. He runs into Molly and Bill, both going to their respective rooms before setting up for the night; John will sit on a large lounge chair outside Sherlock’s bedroom door, cushioned with extra pillows and a borrowed duvet as a makeshift bed. Mycroft will sleep downstairs in the living-room; he had insisted the sofa would do just fine (allowing Molly to have the other guest room).
Something has changed, hasn’t it? She can’t quite bring herself to hate Sherlock as she did before he disappeared. Since the moment they collected Moriarty’s body from the rooftop of Barts, a small nugget of something suspiciously feeling like guilt had planted itself inside her. At that point, she was still convinced Sherlock had been a fraud, and his suicide had simply confirmed it — she had supposed he wasn’t quite totally immune to emotions, not having been able to cope with his own guilt.
<< I don't bet with you, you know >> he chuckles and Sherlock follows him. Here they are, as always laughing in the less suitable places and times. They try to restore a demeanor, touched by the grim look of Greg, who would like to be everywhere except there.
Sherlock feels himself wrapped up, dishevels his hair, enters it with each breath, pricking his nostrils and throat with those nauseating essences. The head begins to turn and he tries to stop it by bringing a hand to the temple.
<< Sherlock, you  already put the sticks in the wheels to my intimate relationships. I don't need to take a dog >>.
"Oh," exclaims Moriarty, in amazement. "Did you really say that?" he asks, bringing both hands to the face, theatrically. “Sherlock, but it's not done! It is not done! There is nothing more naive than declaring your love on the wave of orgasm" he says, crossing his arms over his chest.
Sherlock has just finished shortening the jacket sleeves when the doctor returns to the room. The consultant is surprised at the work John has done: a dark hair with very natural red highlights, with a youthful hairstyle.
<< It happened again >> says the consultant, arching just an eyebrow. Greg nods and John feels his stomach close.
<< Yes, John. Lestrade, contact the Milton Keynes district. Alert them of what's going on and send your team over there. I'll join you at girl's house >> Sherlock says, closing the call leaving them with a thousand questions. Sherlock takes the package of sheets of reliefs he made and flies to find a cab.
<< What is the meaning of the drawing? >> Lestrade asks, stopped a few steps from the corps. John recognizes on the detective's face his own attempt at detachment and self-control.
<< Come here, what do you do? >> John laughs, getting up in turn. He grabs Sherlock by the hips and brings him back to the sofa. The consultant shouts and laughs trying to free himself.
Sherlock turns to William, who laughs cheerfully because Morgan licks the residue of milk and biscuits from his face. John see  the heartbroken sigh that Sherlock tries to disguise.
"Maybe I still have hope" Sherlock thinks, looking at that statue of flesh. "Maybe child-Mary will take over and take me to Hataway, as I proposed," he hopes with all his might.
John can understand the reason for his pain. He too has had the opportunity to become attached to the child-Mary in these few days lived among courts, lawyers, asylum and structures to which to ask to host her. Mycroft did not put the sticks in their wheels, but he did not even try to help them, convinced that it was just an absurd madness.
<< I will stay here and I'll do everything I can to help you find Sherlock. If afterwards, however, the balance that he has maintained also thanks to your arrival should completely break, then I will no longer help you, John. I'm sorry to be so severe, but you have no idea the extent of the damage you may have caused. Now I am also seriously worried about his safety, not necessarily put at risk by this storm >>.
<< By sending images ... details, which are immediately placed on the pedopornography market, in the simplest of cases. By making themself available for intimate meetings with people chosen by the Masters, in the worst >>.
<< You are finally awake >> Mycroft says and his lips stretch out to draw a smile. It is strange. If Mycroft smiles at him, it means that he saw him really bad.
<< I have not attacked anyone! >> the chief  blurts, crossing his arms over his chest. Behind him, Greg rolls his eyes and John shakes his head in resignation. << I allowed you, Mr Holmes, to take part of our most important cases and what do you do? Contaminate the crime scene by going through it with your dog! Do you even carry your son with you? >> cries the chief indignantly, pointing William.
<< No, Morgan, don't eat it! >> William shouts, but the dog has no intention of accepting the unsolicited gift.
The man becomes purple and sprints towards her determined to silence her, but Morgan reacts before anyone else, by returning to growl and bark. Although instinct would lead Mr Ford to detach the dog's head with one hand, when he sees the unkind eyes of all those present, he takes a step back.
There was a note of pride in John's soul for having been the architect of Sherlock's state of bliss. There was, however, also a bigger slice of sense of responsibility for that happiness. John would have to bear the weight, do his utmost to maintain it and above all give himself permission to live it in turn. Too many things all together and all fantastic. No, it couldn't really be for him. It would have been an idyll that would have died out, as had happened so many times before. Only this time John didn't even want to try, because the person who was sleeping blissfully over the sofa was not like everyone else. That person wa intelligent, fragile and John did not want to risk destroying everything after some time with some escapade or with the usual wrong joke or questionable behavior. So, he tought that was better to destroy it immediately.
<< Deserves to die! >> she says, assuming the fierce expression of the evil Mary. Sherlock does not appreciate these exclamations, but below it, satisfies him to hear another person recognize that John's had not the best behavior he could have had.
<< Definitely >> retorts Sherlock, to whom the cheeks from laughing so much hurt. << Thank you, Mary. I needed it >> he says, turning his eyes in love with the violin.
John must admit that Sherlock is not entirely wrong. When he was a soldier he never had a problem walking through his dormitory in his underwear. At the time, however, he had a few pounds less and was much more toned and young. Despite annoying him, he realizes that this is exactly what prevents him from showing himself naked in front of Sherlock, that is thin and in great shape.
<< I'll burn your heart >> Moriarty had told Sherlock. John can't help but chuckle thinking that the Napoleon of the crime will not even have to get his hands dirty. John had burn Sherlock's heart.  Him, the blogger without whom the consulting detective would be lost.
<< I can always take back the proposal >> retorts Sherlock angrily. << And anyway, no, if I offer myself it is to shorten the investigation time. I will be away for a couple of weeks at most >>.
<< In fact, you're right, I never listen to you. It is plausible you thought so, because I thought so too. If I didn't do it, it's because ... because I still struggle to stand. And then ... >> Sherlock adds, taking another breath. << You are also right about your reputation. I have told you that what people think about me it is not a problem. yet I am doing everything possible to evoide people to discover what happened to me. Before, I could not stand the idea that people could fool me becouse I not realizing that I was drugged and I was fall into a trap that. Now ... I know that I had continuous drop in pressure I take as a betrayal from my body. I do not know what is happening to me, John >> whispers worried.
Sherlock look at himself tremble, wrapped in the blanket that covers him from head to toe. A cocoon of a discolored pink-gray thrown into a freshly cleaned pit. He solved this case too. He does not believe, however, that he will be able to boast about it, this time.
John frees Sherlock's wrist from his grip and takes two steps backwards, shaking his head. John brings his hands to his mouth and feels them tremble slightly, shaken by this violent anger that still invades his body. They were talking about the case, about Greg and his daughter and he turned the conversation on that damned guitarist.
<< Well, now that we have established who half of your genetic heritage belongs to, can you tell us what brings you here at this hour, facing the risk that your parents will discover that you have skipped school? >>.
<< I can do it like this, maybe you want to teach me a different way? >> says Sherlock tugging the shirt in his trousers. The girls blush.
<< I can't stand rapists. Even less  who allowing them to perpetrate their crime and, above all, who try to make their own profit from it >>
The Napoleon of crime, or rather the version of him who lives in Sherlock's Mind Palace, aske him an uncomfortable question that leaves him speechless.
Hearing Mycroft put into words the justification he gave himself to take courage and give voice to that absurd speech, leaves John speechless. He never thought about the future of a relationship. He always just threw himself headlong, taking what there was. John's relationships ended because women are lefted him, every time. He is not in accord with Mycroft, because he would have written the ending of a possible relationship with Sherlock differently: also this time he would have been left. Sherlock would left him out of boredom, for lack of stimuli, for lack of interest, once he has become an obvious routine. Yes, John is convinced of this, he just cannot put it into words. What would be the use of replying at Mycroft's question, if not to make the figure of the one who wants to play the victim after having wanted at all costs to play the role of the executioner?
The moans, previously suffocated to prevent the dog from barking while keeping the whole neighborhood awake, can now find the right outlet, by bringing a greater dose of pleasure and satisfaction.
John would like to retort, but note how visibly stressed Greg is. It would be a useless quarrel that would not bring anything good to both of them. For this reason he takes a deep breath and decides to put aside pride.
<< No. We only live together >> Sherlock reply, smiling. << I have to go to forensic department and I can't take Morgan with me. How about you keep him with you? He loves to play to bring back sticks and balls >>.
"No? Yet I think you've felt just like that in recent times" Moriarty replies, easily freeing himself from Sherlock's grasp. “How many stupid distractions from chance! How many wasted energies that take you away from the obvious solution you have under your nose! " he says, shaking his head disappointed by him. "Get rid of what happened with that silly homunculus and go back to being the infallible consultant I met," Moriarty shouts in his crazy way.
Sherlock does not listen to him and brings the mouse cursor to the 'x' of the 'Laboratory' folder, but stops just before clicking on it. He blinks on the last of the titles present.
<< Let me put the assholes who tried to push my daughter to suicide into jail and then I'll tell you some anecdote. Maybe you will understand many things and maybe you will stop beating yourself! >> exclaims Greg. <<  Shame on you, Sherlock! >> points the finger against Sherlock. << You don't put a friend aside just because another comes from the past >>.
<< You are totally crazy! All of this wouldn't have happened if you hadn't write your bullshit. Do you really think you can ... >>.
<< What should we have done? >> John interrupts him. << Rest assured, basking in the idea that Sherlock Holmes will surely be trapped in a ski club in the mountains? >>.
<< It's ... it's the same for me, Sherlock >> confesses John in one breath. << I realize that it may not be worth anything, not after what I said. Sounds like an attempt to save myself in extremis, but it's not like that. Look at me, Sherlock >> John says, opening his arms before dropping them at his sides. << I am this. Lame, bruised, fat and idiot. You, on the other hand >>, sigh, << you are brilliant, beautiful and athletic. Saturday night it was as if I had taken something that is not for me. Something I don't deserve. I saw you so happy and I was afraid of being able to send everything to hell, because I have never had an important relationship and, wow, you are important. Then I destroyed everything right away. Maybe it is easier for me to make myself despised, as it is for you to accept teasing and criticism rather than compliments >>.
Sherlock finds himself thinking that, if the risk of all that joviality is to find her on him in too intimate attitudes, he prefere to unleash the ire of Mary's dangerous version. Sherlock already thinks of saying something that makes Mary angry, so as to remove that boeful smile from her face and those caressing attentions from her hands.
<< The police  hypothesized it to be a cemetery or a mass grave or that the corpses are victims of some mad assassin. I only know that everyone speculates here, but nobody moves and I need someone to move, Mr. Holmes >> and Sherlock has moved.
<< I can't wait to let Mommy know. Maybe she will stop saying that your job is of no use to anyone except you >> adds George, slapping Greg on the shoulder.
The tone and the way in which Sherlock gives this news exacerbate the sense of embarrassment of the ex soldier.
"He passed out," Sherlcok says. "The man threw him against the wall," he notes, from the number of kitchen utensils, pots and pans that fell on the floor from the shelves against which the small body hit.
<< Hey, you like pirates: we can calling him Morgan >> John proposes. Sherlock think about the proposal.
That now you accusing him of never being here I find it absurd >> she says, putting on the same expression of contempt that John has seen so many times in the face of Greg.
John feels his viscera squirm and a strong sense of nausea rise up his throat. A part of himself tries to reject the understanding that is reaching him of the words of this woman.
<< I am sure, my dear doctor, that you have the answer to this question within you, a bit like how you had these details of the  jailer of my brother. I don't want to know anything else about what happened between you and Sherlock. If it's true, though, that you let him know you used him, well, then I'm afraid you lost him, John. I wonder why you have to put such an idea into Sherlock's head if this is not true. I wonder why you ordinary human beings have to be so damn idiotic! >> Mycroft snaps, hitting the palm of his left hand with his right fist. John has never seen Mycroft so angry, even in moments of greater discussion with his brother. << Self-esteem problems. Your ex-therapist was bad, but she caught you in this. You have ruined not only your life, but that of another man, whom you also care about, only for your damned self-esteem problems >>. Mycroft sighs and tries to calm himself down. He shakes his head several times. << I'm sorry. Really. He didn't deserve it. He has already gone through so many >>.
<< This put your reputation at risk. It's a trivial criminal investigation, I can do it myself. Enjoy the hotel >> leaves the room by slamming the door.
Sherlock is speechless. He had already considered in his Mind Palace that possibility, also mentioned by Mycroft. Hearing it, however, put into words by John himself is quite another thing.
Would it be so different compared to how lifeless he feels now? His days are filled but aimless. His small achievements remain unshared in the cocoon of his loneliness.
under his breath. Greg points to the ninja-woman: “That is Irene Adler, Sherlock’s current bodyguard.”
John leaves. Sherlock hears the front door clicking shut, a car motor brought to life, tyres on wet gravel. He’s alone again.
“What is the alternative?” John’s reply is tentative, cautious. “We never talk about important things.”
“I just want to breathe. For a few hours. Have a private moment with someone whose company I enjoy.”
“I failed, Molly,” John replies, trying to not let his voice break. “I let my guard down. The one thing I should never do.” He exhales a weary sigh. “I’m not good for him.”
“You are a figment of my imagination, therefore a part of me and thus, technically, you do know I am alive.”
Even if things went spectacularly haywire between them, Sherlock is still in danger. It’s not about the money, it’s not about them. And while Victor is a literal tosser, he’s not the man threatening Sherlock’s life – he’s endangering it with his reckless behaviour, yes, but taking Victor out of the equation will not save Sherlock.
“Christ.” John gulps and takes a shuddering breath, a frown of concentration wrinkling the bridge of his nose. “We never found a bug.”
! We’re the only company that customises all dimensions: length, size, girth, colour. You want it, we got it. If we don’t have it, we’ll make it!”
A short, broad-shouldered man comes out of the front door and breaks into a toothy smile as he spots John coming out of the car.
The man himself arrives fashionably late when the party is in full swing. He steps to the corner where the live band plays and after a few exchanged words, he turns to the microphone stand.
This is in part due to its location, around the corner from Imperial College and a handful of popular museums and attractions in the heart of South Kensington. More importantly,
When I finally find my voice, it is to repeat these same words over and over again back at him, interrupting only to lay kisses on his face, his forehead, his lips. A year ago, I did the same, standing in this very room, when he told me these very words for the first time.
“Good morning, Mary.” I rise myself from my trusty armchair. Fortunate that I had already changed into my day clothes, although my second favourite dressing gown still wraps me as an armour. “What do I owe the pleasure?” I step towards her and place a light kiss on her proffered cheek. She smiles back with the same empty intentions.
And so, it had been an unremarkable evening as evenings go in 221b. The fact that Sherlock had seemed determined in ploughing a trench in the carpet by walking back and forth when John pushed the door open into the flat had mostly been ignored – Sherlock in a strop when no case is on is far from being unusual. A bit less usual had been his immediate disappearance into his bedroom when John tried to say ‘hello’ – seemingly to continue his frantic pacing around the bed or something, judging by the noise coming from behind the closed door.
“Are you coming back to London?” John asks timidly in the wee hours against Sherlock’s long, pale neck, following with a soft kiss on Sherlock’s shoulder, sweat cooling on their skin.
The letter sleeps on the small kitchen table, cold, mocking. A regular size envelope, milky white, ordinary stamp.
John doesn’t turn to reply, marching to his car. “That was as proper a meeting as necessary, Greg. It was nice to see you; maybe we can grab a pint sometime.”
Victor looks guilty. “Um, the door wasn’t exactly forced and I’m the only one with the key. I let the staff do maintenance cleaning but that’s it.” He clears his throat. “Maybe I just forgot to lock it that day.”
at him, and without breaking eye contact, he gestures vaguely towards his brother. “Mycroft.” Mycroft sighs, rolls his eyes, and places a call, asking a ‘Mrs Hudson’ to bring in a glass of orange juice with ice to their guest.
The house buzzes around them with the stream of power returning, as the fridge hums back to life and electronics charge up. The moment between them is awkwardly broken but not lost. They reluctantly release each other and, in noiseless agreement, go separate ways to sleep.
<< There is so much loneliness here when the snow arrives >> Mary whispers, in fact, with a small little voice. She turns her gaze to him and the cheerful smile drives away any sign of sadness. << Fortunately, you are here. You who are calm and behave so well >> adds joyful.
<< Yes >> Greg nods and runs his hand over his bristler beard than usual. << I brought you the photos taken in her house and I have already told the SC to send here the PC and all the notebooks and books in the girl's room. Did you find anything in the material that was brought to you yesterday? >>.
John sniffs the air. It's the first thing Sherlock usually does when they come to a new crime scene. He come in, look around and smell the air. Sherlock is able to list one by one the smells he perceives and give each of them his exact sense of being, like a hound. John finds yet another fantastic gift of the brilliant man with whom he has the honor of living and who now tries to emulate.
<< Who is this? >>. John raises his head to meet Greg's astonished gaze. The detective's eyes go from the frightened puppy to the doctor, trying to understand how the two elements can be connected.
The wind blows strong here in the pit. It is freezing and inclement. Scratches the skin mercilessly, like a beast. It then laughs at its misdeeds, wrapping itself in its coils, before moving on. Sherlock trembles from head to toe. He lies among the rotting corpses covered with frost, which whitens them making them even more bleak.
John encourages Sherlock to continue talking about the case even during the exercises, which helps him do them without complaining. The foot flexes, now, much better and, although the balance is still precarious, the support on both feet seems to have been regained.
<< The man I live with >> Sherlock replies, trying not to be horrified by his ignorance. He realizes too late that he said the wrong thing and in the wrong way.
<< Have a seat here, please >> says the guard, pointing to a door with the same number on his right. The doctor enters this room four by four with gray and bare walls. A square table is placed in the exact center with a very simple chair on each side.
<< How will you do it? They could also come from Lancaster or Morecambe or maybe from both places >>.
<< I take the car keys >> Kelly says, running into the kitchen. William watches Morgan barking at full lungs. The dog moves from the door and runs around the perimeter of the living room, barking at the large windows from which the child sees a shadow.
<< They found out that she is the daughter of a Scotland Yard's inspector >> Sherlock replies with that irritating tone of obvious.
<< It is the second phase >> Sherlock replies, giving the boy the cell phone. << First they lure the kids with the facade as a support site. Then they identify the most fragile ones and invite them to attend seminars >>.
“You said you would never adapt to survive. That you wouldn't have been like me ”Mycroft's voice. Far. Weak as a whisper. However, Sherlock does not believe he is adapting to anything. It's just that he no longer hears anything.
holding the 'parrot' at eye level and the tremor that shakes her body does not promise anything good.
<< You did it big this time. Big big, oooooh yes! >> she exclaims and opens the door of the storage room. Mary grabs Sherlock by the broken leg and throws him inside. << You will stay here to reflect on your sins, ungrateful without god >> she says, kicking the drip that Sherlock promptly grabs and draws to himself a moment before she closes the door, leaving him in the narrow, dusty and dark space of that small room .
<< Where do you think to go with your leg in those conditions >> she attacks him, pointing with a gesture of the head the plaster that wraps Sherlock's leg. << You have it for a good month, listen to me. The roads to Keswick are all blocked and I was unable to take you to the hospital. I had only two choise: leave you there to die from freezing or bring you here. I thought it was better to bring you here >>.
<< Exactly >> sighs the little man. << For this reason I need reliable data and as soon as possible and you, sir, are lightning in discovering things. It took you a few minutes to understand the dynamics of the accident >>.
The thought that those eyes can look at someone else with desire, that those lips can smile sweetly at someone else and those hands touch another's body annoys John. Yes he can't tolerate it
John holds his breath and counts up to ten, always in the hope of not loosing the effect of the shower. In a sense, Sherlock is worried about him, so he appreciates at least the effort.
John runs his hands over his face, worried that the sensation he feels on the skin may correspond to reality. Mycroft continues to peer at him silently. John cannot understand how Mycroft can be so calm after what he told him.
“So sorry to interrupt your evening like this, but I do need your help. We’re having a little meeting with a common friend in a short while.” Moriarty is gleeful, and John fights a new wave of nausea. A common friend? “He isn’t really expecting you — in fact, he waited until you left to book a rendezvous with me. Such a romantic!” Moriarty leans closer, so close John can feel his exhaled venom. “And while I would love to have a little tête-à-tête with him alone, I do think he’ll be
To try to buy time, Sherlock bats his eyelashes to come across more bashful than anxious. “Mr Brook, I hope you don’t think I’m an easy man.”
“Nothing to apologise for,” John whispers back, and means it, asserts it with one last threading of fingers into disarrayed curls. He slides his hands onto Sherlock’s biceps and lifts him gently, attempting to make Sherlock face him. “Can you get up?”
. That had been the answer to Sherlock’s question of who was ‘the lovely lady.’ While it’s glaringly obvious that Mary is staff, Sherlock had suggested she might be Richard’s girlfriend. And as people love to correct you if you’re wrong and, as a consequence, give you more information than needed, Richard’s answer had been a ringing laugh and a ‘no, no, personal assistant. Not my type at all.’
“Yes, quite extraordinary. John Watson,” and he stretches a hand to Sherlock, who shakes it in a daze.
John’s first instinct is to break the door down but then he recalls the keys in his pocket and takes them out, quickly unlocks the door, draws his gun, and slams the door open.
Forgiveness is letting go of the pain that shapes your landscape. A reshaping is in progress. But it will take time.
“Yes!” Sherlock interrupts. When has he ever been a patient man? His other hand reaches for John’s nape and brings their mouths closer. The puppy jumps down on the floor and runs around the room, oblivious to the monumental shift in their lives. “Yes,” Sherlock whispers into John’s mouth, “yes,” he repeats breathlessly, “a thousand times yes. My darling John.”
A pale Sherlock walks past him into the foyer, disrobing his coat and jacket and throwing them on a chair. He stands straight as a rod, his back to Mycroft.
As she broods on these thoughts, Sally notices that the room is now emptier and quieter, only Lestrade, John, Sherlock and herself left; Lestrade is exchanging some joke with John while they both walk towards the door, and Sherlock is inspecting some stain on the carpet with more attention that it probably deserves. She straightens her back, squares her shoulders and is about to follow Lestrade out of the house when she hears Sherlock rumble quietly, but definitely at her:
Yes, Sherlock takes him on midnight expeditions to look at comets, relies on his presence to process his ideas, but he never reaches for John for intimacy.
Molly finds them an Airbnb near the hospital – a spacious flat with the privacy a hotel in the city centre wouldn’t provide. It had taken some convincing to drag Sherlock from his brother’s bedside to get a few hours of shuteye but in the end Sherlock had acquiesced.
The exchange dazes John; his pulse rises in discomfort, and he clears his throat, straightens his back and takes a small step back. “I better get back to work then, if I’m not being fired.”
Sherlock is shaking but answers him with a sharp nod. It seems he cannot escape the destiny written in black Bic Cristal after all, because it has chased him down from London into Sussex, across hilltops and narrow roads, through severe weather and right into his doorstep.
now? Or maybe he sent her away because God forbid someone disturb Sherlock Holmes and his massive intellect.
“That message was not sent from my phone.” He pockets the phone, closes his eyes and takes a deep sigh.
“I’m here,” he proceeds carefully, his voice trembling but clear, “to reiterate the question I asked in the letter.” Before Sherlock protests again, John lifts a shaking palm. “Please, just. Hear me this once and I promise I will leave you alone after. Forever,” he swallows thickly, “if that’s what you wish.”
Sherlock swallows visibly, but then seems to shake himself off from the momentary state of shock he had fallen into. He smooths down his lapels and straightens his spine. “Victor.” Sherlock steps forward an extends a hand. “Nice to see you. You look… well.”
A snort of agreement sounds from the kitchen. “That one, going on a holiday? Only if there’s a triple murder.”
There’s a laptop idling in a corner of the room, and Sherlock makes his way to it, presses the power button to wake it up from hibernation, inserts the drive into a USB port, and waits until an explorer window pops up with the drive’s contents as Windows completes the rather useless process of ‘installing’ the drive. There is only one file, an MP3. Sherlock double clicks it with some trepidation, and as a voice recites something akin to a nursery rhyme, the world dissolves around him.
<< Okay, I understand >> she mind, moving away from him a good two steps. John goes to the door that opens by himself.
<< Silver was not so stupid! >> shouts William. << Nobody couldn't screw him with these stupid tricks! Silver was very good with people that he knew, but he barked like crazy to strangers >>.
Strangely, the music stops when John reaches the landing floor. Sherlock is used to guess who is coming to visit from the sound of footsteps and when he plays the violin he continues tirelessly without even saying 'Hello'. Indeed, without even realizing that John has returned, to be honest.
John takes a while to figure out what he's looking at. The video is a piece of footage taken by the camera placed in front of the changing room. Shows Howard Byron exiting the locker room. He walks with an uncertain step, one hand pressed to his mouth and his gaze lost in front of him.
<< I am not a whore and neither was she, damned killer! >> Sherlock cried out, exploding the anger of his crazy parent. He found himself chased again by him along the corridors of that old and dismal house. He had managed, however, to escape him that time, to find his way out of the snowy countryside. Thus began his exile, his slow fall in the tunnel of actual addiction.
<< Thank you >> the boy says, sketching a smile. << It doesn't concern me directly. It's for my sister >>.
The doctor admire the work of that group of journalists, who are completely out of the rules, but capable of bringing uncomfortable and gruesome truths to the fore. Skilled transformers, capable of disguising themselves by completely changing their physiognomy and physicality to act incognito and carry out their investigations. Now John understands many of the events that have happened in the past few days.
<< Oh yes, it's clear >> says the child taking courage. << It is clear to me that you are one of what my father calls 'careerist asshole' >>. Sherlock laughs at the child's words, while John and Greg grin silently.
<< Oh, yes, it is there >> William run, but stops suddenly. << To get there, however, we must pass between them >> whispers the child, indicating the men of the scientific department.
“I mean,” Sherlock replies carefully, measuring his words, “if you find your job agreeable. If you enjoy it. Or if it is just a means to a paycheck.”
“I forgive you, John,” he adds quietly. “Please stop beating yourself too over this. All the what-ifs in the world will not erase the past.”
is the extremely unhelpful first thought crossing Sherlock’s mind. The answer is obvious. The slide of two tectonic plates causes seismic activity as accrued energy is released in the form of tremors with defined frequencies and intensities. Quakes are unpredictable, both timing and strength. When an earthquake strikes, all you can do is take cover. Which is why John seems to be shrinking, shrinking, and Sherlock fears he will disappear into thin air.
<< They didn't convince him, Greg: they carried him to us and I was an idiot in not insisting that they stop >>.
John squints hard and then slowly relaxes his face. He recalls the exact moment when his eyes landed on Mary Abbott.
Greg weigh every single word and now looks at John with the same compassionate look that is given to the desperate relatives of a kidnapping victim. John would gladly jump to Greg's throat, but, after all, he knows that his detective friend is just trying to make him reason.
John enters 221B Baker Street and climbs the stairs, by dragging the heavy trolley, one step after the other with both hands.
"And I'm at both!" John silences her. The consulting detective, married to his job, has brought home a not bad prey. The idea that they have already given vent to that attraction of which he was an involuntary witness, and that they will continue throughout the night, closes John's stomach.
<< No. I closed myself when I didn't want to be found. I had a secret hiding place in the kitchen >> he replies, thinking back to the door poised on broken hinges.
Bad choice of words. The woman takes his justification as an admission of guilt and begins to shake him and slamming him several times against the mattress.
The detective pales more and more as the story goes on. His eyes become large with amazement and he often shakes his head in disbelief, glancing at his son. When John finishes his piece, Greg brings both hands to cover his face and holds them there for a long moment, breathing slowly.
<< For a long time I asked myself when the moment would come when you would relive the traumas of your childhood and youth. You had to run into an unfortunate and crazy woman to do it >>.
<< Sherlock, I understand the situation but we can't stay behind the boy. We must try to save his parents >>.
<< It could be anything. Byron may have a heart attack, but he may still be caught in the whirlwind of passion just consumed >>.
A snort diverts John from the answer he is about to give. The two men exchange a surprised look and then, on the second puff, they get closer to the consultant.
<< You will end up stealing my job! >> he says, making William's small pale cheeks blush. << If your mom used to keep her student's homeworks there and you saw its on the table before going up to your room and now its are not scattered on the ground... >>.
For the umpteenth time in a few moments John turns his gaze to the watch on his wrist. He's been there making a groove on the carpet for a hour now.
John seems to calm down. He turns to Sherlock and does not help him to see Sherlock’s cheekbone split from his fist and Sherlock’s eyebrow dented from the clash against the wall.
John wonders. The puppy reach Sherlock's side and crouch down. The consultant raises his head and turns to face toward the puppy.
The boy lights up and splashes on his feet followed by Morgan. William hop on the desk chair and turn on the PC. The consultant stands up and observe him, intent on recovering the precious finds.
<< Wake up, Sherlock >> John whispers taking Sherlock's hand in his. << Do you want me to go? It is for that reason that do you insist on staying asleep? I can also do it. Yes, I will do it as soon as your brother returns. Maybe his presence is more pleasing to you than mine, at the moment >> he says realizing himself that he is carrying out a completely senseless reasoning.
Mycroft observes the four men sitting beyond the precious oak wood desk of his study at the Diogenes Club with a skeptical and arrogant smile.
<< I ... I do not understand why they should throw me out for my father's job. It is a self-help portal >>.
<< I only know that she threw you away like I was garbage. I know I could be in a morgue to recognize your lifeless body, right now, rather than here >>.
<< Enough now, John! We have enough evidence to indict him and spend the rest of his days in jail. I will not allow you to further dirty your hands with him >> Sherlock shouts squeezing him with greater force. << Calm down, please. I can't stand the idea of seeing you get into trouble because of me >>.
The receptionist gives him the keys and the brochure with the services offered by the Spa, the menu provided for the day and the times for breakfast, lunch and dinner.They take the lift to the fourth floor, the one reserved for the suites. The 'Blue Ocean' has walls blue and a white ceiling. It is furnished like an ancient ship, with many marine-themed furnishings.
<< Exactly >> she smiles as if he had just shown her a trick. << Why did you call me, Eddy? What happens? >>.
<< It cannot have fallen on impact. Sherlock is methodical, he would never put a suitcase in a place other than a luggage rack >>.
<< Every day >> nods Mary, amused. << Even if I did not understand what was wrong >> adds seriously, bringing a finger to the chin. She thinks about it for a few moments and then shakes her head, smiling amused. << Did your mom love you? >> asks him, touching another hot topic.
<< Do you see that overturned table? >> points to it with his finger. << The student's homework of my mom was there. It was a very high pile of short stories that she corrects every evening. Before I went to bed, yesterday, the homeworks were there and she promised me that she would come up to read me one that she thought was really nice. Mom knows that I like crime stories and when some of her students write them, she always reads to me the most beautiful ones. I always immediately discover the culprit >> William says proudly. Sherlock messes up the child's hair more spontaneously than before.
<< Mr. Holmes can receive you, Dr. Watson! >> pompously announces the valet and John does not have it repeated twice. With quick and nervous steps, John leaves the room, badly moving the valet away and rushes to attack the knob of the door of Mycroft's office.
<< Well, come on, somehow he will have done before getting to know me >> John coughs. Greg looks at him with big eyes and shakes his disconsolate head.
<< I couldn't verify why this gentleman forced me to go to the kitchen >> William says pointing to Greg.
<< Oh, of course you're sorry >> nods the woman, satisfied. << And to make up for it, now you will eat everything, like a good boy. It's not true? >>.
Sherlock wakes up in a sweat and with shortness of breath. A nightmare. He had a terrible and so real nightmare. Lost in the storm. Surrounded by wolves. Cornered and attacked. Wolves's white teeth sank into the flesh of his right leg. He lays his hand on it, happy to feel it whole. The pain, however, persists unchanged. He looks up at the IV and realizes that the morphine is over. With its end pain came.
<< Edward ... >> repeats John, who takes a moment to remember that his friend was working incognito. << He is fine >>.
<< A team of technicians would do better >> Greg whispers, observing the driver's seat belt which seems to have been voluntarily released.
<< You have been good, you have not cut tyourself even once >> says Mary. She leans over to the basin in which she dips a towel, squeezes it and throws it in Sherlock's face. Mary presses it hard on Sherlock's face with her hands, taking his breath away for a long moment before removing it. She dipping it again, wringing it out and starting to rub Sherlock's cheeks, chin, forehead and nose vigorously.
<< Why is he captain if he is a doctor? >> she asks this curious question with a little girl's voice. John exchanges a quick glance with the inspector.
<< How don't you leave anyone? What about Molly? >> asks him. The bright eyes she puts on, every time he talks about Molly, look at him upset.
The doctor and the consultant stand by and watch the door until they hear the door close behind George Lestrade as well.
<< So what it is? >> he challenges him, by raising his voice. Some people, annoyed, ask him for silence.
<< Thanks, John >> Sherlock says, sketching one of his sincere and rare smiles, which, however, he dedicates so often to John.
"And can you also control pee and poo?" Moriarty asks him, amuses. "You will have to do here on the floor and your benefactress will get pissed and freak out and then ...".
<< No, no, no, John. Look >> Sherlock says, placing a photo of the pit under John's nose. << Both cities you mentioned are to the south, while the only way to get here and passing from the north, according to what can be deduced from the shape of the terrain and the network of roads and paths >>.
“I don’t give a toss about grammar at bloody–,” John looks at his wristwatch, “half four in the morning,
Sherlock nods almost imperceptibly and John reaches for him, arms encircling his waist, pressing their bodies together. Lips find each other again, a sensual slick slide delving into increased urgency, the initial hesitancy dissolving in arousal and pressure, teeth, tongues, a hint of stubble giving that extra friction.
He hasn’t completely let go – there’s still the occasional contact from Lestrade, asking his opinion on this or that; a few private clients, too. All issues that can be solved by phone or e-mail. No chases, no break-ins, no snooping around.
The obvious reason is grabbing handfuls of pebbles with chubby toddler fingers and dumping them next to Sherlock’s own piles. John grins at her.
“That— that would be wonderful, Sherlock. Thank you. Yeah, thank you. Rosie is going to love it there, I am sure. Can we, um. Can we come down on Monday, then?
with a slice of something complicated, layers of chocolate and twirls of salted caramel and sprinkles of god knows what, he’d had enough. He had had enough. He was hurt and sad and angry and confused, and what was the point of anything at all? John and Molly babbled something about Rosie and the weather and Sherlock had enough. John had beaten him to a pulp, and at the time Sherlock thought he
Victor smiles warmly at him. “That’s– that’s good. I thought maybe you were still mad at me,” he chuckles, self-deprecating, not quite amused.
They both jump in their seats at the sound of china breaking on the kitchen floor, followed by a muffled ‘Bugger!’ from behind the closed door.
What is troubling Sherlock, and keeps replaying in his head, is John offering his life to save Sherlock’s. The way he did not hesitate in holding Moriarty and telling Sherlock to run.
“So, you’re happy to step out of the limelight and work for him? Instead of pursuing your own career in music, you work as a PA.”
Her voice is too chirpy for Sherlock’s foul mood. “Nothing! Absolutely nothing!” He snatches an innocent Erlenmeyer flask from the bench and is about to hurl it against the nearest wall when Molly cuts in with a steely tone:
. Why did he have to flirt unabashedly with that repulsive Brook guy in front of him? Everything Sherlock did last night had been to provoke John, John is sure of that. He’s being punished for putting a stop to their…
Sally shifts from foot to foot, a sense of discomfort filling her slowly. “Look, it’s none of my business but. He was in a bad shape after you left. And you let him think you were dead for over two years.”
“Stop thinking so loud, John. My voice is fine. I’m a bit sore but I don’t think I’ll need additional medical attention. I have you.” He opens his eyes and looks up at John from between thick, dark lashes. Their position is intimate, John standing in the vee of Sherlock’s spread legs, a hand holding the ice and the other on Sherlock’s shoulder. John fights the impulse to caress those impossibly soft curls. Sherlock must have put up a good fight to be able to fend off someone who surprised him with intent to kill, and fondness fills him for this impossibly beautiful, talented man. He knows he can’t touch Sherlock again – it’s not his place, and it’s clear it will only end badly for all involved. But John cannot help feeling tender and protective of him, and he decides to at least not fight that.
“Yes,” John interrupts, “but I made the mistake involving myself with my client.” He swallows thickly, avoiding Sherlock’s scrutiny under the pretence of searching for the second shoe, which he finds under the bed.
Sherlock loves his private flat. Here, he does not need to don the façade of his public persona with all the interviews and recording and choreographing and more interviews, with the constant barrage of noise from his scurrying minions. He doesn’t know what half of these people do and he doesn’t know the other half
“I… love you too, John, of course. You are my best friend.” Every word is carefully placed, his face attempting a nonchalant expression, eyes flicking nervously between an undefined point on the rug and John’s face.
; Sherlock has to be seen out there!” Victor stabs a finger towards the window to reinforce his opinion. “What’s the point of being a performer if he can’t
“Hello, Sherlock. Just visiting London with the kids and my sister, do some shopping. That sort of thing.” She stretches her hand and Sherlock gives her a firm handshake.
John slides his hand up and down Sherlock’s arm in a hopefully comforting way. To his relief, Sherlock leans into the soothing touch and relaxes minutely. “I do not want to talk about it.”
“He’s… surprisingly okay. Keeping himself busy. There was a lot of paperwork related to the Moran case.” Ellie shifts in her seat and flicks her gaze away from Sherlock’s intense scrutiny. She can’t go into details. Alec Hardy had decided at first not to pursue the mystery of Moran’s sister, but as time went by, it was almost impossible to ignore it. Ellie’s actions had to be thoroughly investigated after Moran’s demise. She shakes away the memory. “But that’s all in the past now. Things have been pretty quiet since then, just the usual amount of petty crime.”
“I don’t,” Sherlock replies, “but this is beautiful.” He looks down at John, eyes shining and happy.
Every word dropped from John’s mouth cuts through his chest and out on the stillness of the room. Sherlock is still looking quizzically at him. “Did I do or say something untoward, John?”
“I am glad we had this little chat.” She smiles falsely, not even trying to look sincere. “Just get it out of your systems and let me have my married life in peace and quiet.” She strides to the door but halts at the threshold and turns back to face me. “And, Sherlock?”
“You are right. One does not do this to their best friend,” his voice is almost steady, but a slight tremor betrays his true state of mind, “yet I would do it all over again to save his life.” He lifts his head fully to look at her. “I would commit suicide for real if that meant he would live. If that makes me a sociopath — so be it.”
John gaped baffled at her for several seconds, her voice still echoing off the sterile surfaces. But then the corner of his mouth twitched upwards and laughter bubbled out of his chest, low chuckles turning into near-hysterical cackles. Molly stared at him in confusion, but John’s mirth was contagious, and she found herself joining in the laughter.
There’s a small study next to Sherlock’s bedroom and they both agree it will be Rosie’s makeshift bedroom; there is, however, no space left for the rather oversized air mattress Sherlock bought. There’s always something.
Oh. No, in fact he had not apologised for this, but what of it? Sherlock knows they were both out of sorts, him high as a kite, John grieving, both being pushed to that place where they became untethered and unhinged.
None of the men seem to acknowledge her as she slips out of the suite, their eyes still locked on each other.
John takes it all in stride and tries to remain focused on the one goal of his job: to protect Sherlock. He ignores how Victor shadows Sherlock’s every move whenever Sherlock is in a strop, how Victor whispers conspiratorially in Sherlock’s ear while glancing contemptuously at John.
“But if you cannot see it, is it really there? And when I say ‘see’, I do not mean only whatever falls within the range of the visible spectrum,” Sherlock clarifies pointedly.
“Not pointless if they get you rid of kidney stones, now is it? Besides, there’s more to an amusement park than rollercoasters.”
For a few moments, time is suspended in 221B Baker Street. Then, Sherlock raises their joined hands to his lips and, as he places a careful kiss on John’s hand, he whispers,
here, and John is powerless to prevent an attack. Not the time to be distracted. The dance floor undulates to the beat of the music; Sherlock reaches out to touch teasing fingers to extended hands on the front row.
“I– it matters, John.” Sherlock pauses, worrying his lower lip between his teeth. “Thank you for telling me.”
“There’s a study about how riding a rollercoaster can help moving a stone.” Sherlock’s other eyebrow shoots up, but John is not deterred. “There’s also a study suggesting frequent, huh, intercourse might help. Get things moving.” He feels himself getting red as a beet.
The drinks are abandoned on the coffee table, together with a torn envelope and a letter that flutters to the floor when a waft of summer evening sweeps through open windows.
“Of course you can, John. Only you can. I…need you.” Sherlock wipes a tear that, despite his effort, tracks down his face. “I know I’ve been difficult. I’ll admit that what happened between us coloured my view of you negatively. But…”
, people can be dense. Victor has tried to charm his way into Sherlock’s bed before, and when firmly put in his place, he had simply transferred his sexual fantasies to the opulent bedding.
He blinks. Blinks again. Breathes a shaky breath. Curses himself again. Takes another steadier breath and looks at John.
Mrs Hudson is momentarily confused but accepts this new information without further questioning. “That’s right, dear, I’m the housekeeper.”
“Who you are matters, Sherlock,” and John puts a tentative hand on Sherlock’s shoulder, giving it a small squeeze.
As John opens his mouth to protest, Victor adds quickly, “Look, John, I know what you are thinking – lots of people in the house at all times of the day. It would have been chaos to try and find out who did this. This room is not in use; we have no idea of precisely when the…
on the bed and a court order later and the result would be a match from the offspring of Mr and Mrs Trevor. Tell me just one thing,” he carries on to not let Victor put a word in, “what is it that gets you off, the frankly horrible decor or imagining Sherlock between the bedsheets? Or is it both?” He wrinkles his nose in mock disgust.
Sherlock narrows his eyes at John and gives him a once-over. He steps slowly forward and offers his hand.
“Hmm.” Sherlock looks up again. “There are enough decor details on this ugly facade for an experienced climber to grab hold and escape to the rooftop.” He points to a reticulated trim just above the window.
He blames the adrenaline lingering from the mysterious Land Rover-escape. Also, the heating in the room is a bit too high to compensate for the draughty old building on a cold December day. Yes, that must be it. Nothing to do with the way those wool trousers smooth over Sherlock’s curves. Definitely not. He runs a finger under his collar, swallows again.
A respite that, as of late, has been enriched by Sherlock’s observations of the goings-on in Watson’s flat.
Christmas comes and goes; Sherlock scoffs the holidays away, locked in his flat while his staff are mostly off celebrating, and John is not feeling festive, so it’s all business as usual. As time counts down to New Year’s, the house swims again in the frenzy of holidays. Yet, the festive cheer is dampened by the visible tension between John and Sherlock; everybody senses the chilliness in their over-polite exchanges but no one dares to comment on it. Sherlock throws himself at his work, choreographing a brand new routine for the Grammy Awards ceremony less than two months away. John goes back and forth with his resolution to stay – he doesn’t really need the money, he chastises himself over his involvement with his client, he knows he’s emotionally invested…and this is the reason why he can’t decide to pack up and leave. Even with the air between them frostier than December mornings, John convinces himself his sense of duty trumps whatever grudges Sherlock may still hold against him.
John chuckles at Sherlock’s limpness, weasels himself from Sherlock’s grasp and disappears out of the bedroom, returning minutes later with a damp flannel. He wipes Sherlock’s torso in reverent slow movements; Sherlock looks up at him, unable to put in words the current of thoughts flowing through his head. John’s ministrations are tender, and Sherlock recognises this tenderness as John’s particular way to touch him: from the way he had clasped his hands with Sherlock’s while dancing at the restaurant, to his grip on Sherlock’s wrists, to this careful cleansing of his body. It is fascinating how this man – a war hero, a soldier, a physician, a bodyguard, all those things that make him a fierce protector – shows such gentle care for Sherlock, relishes undemanding in the afterglow, worships his body not as if he had just used it but rather as if it is something precious.
“Bit of a sweet tooth, heh?” She turns serious. “Do you think Watson will try to shoot me if I come near Holmes?”
“I recommend the chili-spiked latte. The strength of the chili will appeal to your thirst for danger, and the milk will give you that soothing finish. Adequate for an ex-army doctor.”
Taken aback, Sherlock stammers, “There is nothing for you to apologise about, Mycroft. What– what may have transpired between the both of you is none of my business.” And if his heart gives a dark thump of jealousy in his chest, Sherlock is sure to ignore it.
John lost his patience. To hell with this commission, what kind of client was this woman anyway? “You contacted DSMT and asked for a product demo!” he shouted in anger.
John looks over his shoulder with unmistakable fondness. “Yeah, he is.” He pushes the door to the flat open and steps aside in an inviting gesture.
Perhaps it’s the late hour; perhaps it’s the fragility of the moment. Perhaps it’s because it’s dark, and warm and they’re both in their pyjamas, and there is a need for comforting and being comforted. All John knows is it feels natural to wrap his arms around Sherlock’s shoulders, draw Sherlock’s head to his chest, thread fingers through soft, damp curls. Sherlock yields to this reassurance of safety, burrows his face in John’s chest and breathes, the humid exhale penetrating the thin layer of cotton on John’s torso. With a gentleness befitting the night-time, John pulls his friend on his feet, guides him down the hallway to the bedroom and into the bed, covers him with the soft duvet, and sits on the edge of the mattress. They look at each other for a long moment; soon enough, Sherlock’s lashes flutter as he closes his eyes, fatigue finally lulling him to sleep.
. He’s aware there’s something Brook isn’t telling him but Sherlock hopes to gather more intelligence from the mysterious man. Richard has introduced himself as an independent artist from Belfast but Sherlock has never heard his name before – meaning he’s either
“The bug was Mycroft. The fool.” Sherlock softens his last words – he can’t bring himself to loathe his brother. Not like this, not now.
They grin at each other, the space between them filling with warmth, the shared moment helping to tear down any remaining walls. John squeezes Sherlock's waist and feels an answering brush of fingertips against his neck. They dance through the rest of the song, inching closer together, and through another one and another one; surroundings blur away, the music cocooning their newfound closeness.
John looks up. A comet shines shyly among the stars, so more visible here than in London. John smiles at the astronomical phenomenon but also at the fact Sherlock took them all the way out here to see a comet. “I thought you didn’t care about the Solar System.”
Molly drives the limo gently around the manor, close to the direct door to Sherlock’s flat. “Here we are,” she whispers, careful to not break the fragile peace that has settled over them in the final stretch of the trip.
John finds himself alone in the hallway, stunned by Mycroft’s blend of dismissal and…propositioning? He shakes his head and puts distance between him and yet another confusing Holmes.
He can’t blame Sherlock. This is all on John. He should have been more professional, shouldn’t have blurred the lines between being his bodyguard and his friend…his lover. John cringes inwardly as he tries to call all of this a mistake – he can’t bear to brush off the shared intimacy of last night as a blunder, not when he had seen his own desire reflected on Sherlock’s eyes.
John scrubs an invisible mark on the coffee table. How is he supposed to get around this one? Yes, John could have continued with his medical career. Become a GP at some random surgery, diagnosing tonsillitis, ordering blood tests, prescribing antibiotics
Mrs Hudson stares pointedly at him. “The problem with people like you is that you have no imagination.
John’s careful tone almost hurts more than the bullet wound on Sherlock’s chest. After Mary had shot him, after being bed-ridden for weeks in hospital, John had practically moved back in 221B, assuming the role of caregiver. Sherlock hadn’t asked, and John hadn’t offered; it just had happened. Tentative questions about Mary had been received with dismissive, angry answers or sometimes — and even worse — thick, laden silence. And so, Sherlock had stopped asking, and John had continued to help Sherlock change bandages, eat meals, move around the flat.
part that now threatens to give John a splitting headache. His sudden intrusion in Sherlock’s routine had been met with resistance, and then accepted as a
The mix of hurt, fury and happiness in John’s face is utterly confusing and, Sherlock thinks, wonderfully endearing. Probably because he is high as a kite. Likely because John is a marvellous mix of contradictions.
Oookay, not what John was expecting. He tries to form some sort of sensical answer to this, but all that leaves his mouth is “Euurgh…?” John doesn’t know what to do with his hands, but Sherlock solves his conundrum by burying his head in the crook of John’s neck and sliding his arms behind John’s shoulders in a clumsy hug. John feels there is nothing more natural than to encircle Sherlock’s waist.
As the last dregs of my morning tea grit on my tongue, the doorbell sounds. I, of course, ignore it in favour of turning the latest puzzle over in my head — namely, how pollination patterns in the greater London area affect the composition of mud throughout seasonal changes. The hypothesis I have formed is that this pattern is intrinsically connected to the predominant species of honeybee—
“Hmmm, no.” Eyes riveted on the eyepieces, Sherlock adjusts the height of the stage until he’s satisfied.
“It is not too late, little brother,” a tired Mycroft mumbles, his eyes fluttering shut with exhaustion.
Sherlock is fishing for information, and John hesitates. There had been a time when he dated woman after woman, although he can’t remember whether he ever took one to this restaurant; probably not, as he rather prefers to come here alone for a nosh and a pint when he’s in central London. That he thought of this place to bring Sherlock to was a consequence of feeling safe and in control here.
The journey northward is long but uneventful. Somewhere north of Glasgow, where the lowlands slowly turn into highlands, Molly checks with John where she’ll need to turn for their destination. After a good half hour of driving on an impossibly narrow road, Molly rolls the car to a stop in front of a wooden house.
Sherlock wants to protest about her nannying, but his heart is not in it. Molly is generous with her time and patience, and Sherlock says the only thing that is appropriate.  “Yes, that would be very nice, Molly. You are too kind to me.”
“Well, maybe it was for the best she didn’t see this,” John picks a firearm from the box, an antique, brass-coloured, very long-barrelled Colt revolver, “she never really got over the holes on the living-room wall.”
But there was something more behind John’s apparent cool demeanour, something Sherlock read in John’s stormy grey eyes. A contained anger, a simmering temper, something wild and dangerous kept in a cage but ready to be unleashed at a moment’s notice. A disquiet.
Sherlock doesn’t know what to do, so he does the only thing he’s ever done that seemed to help: he slips from his own armchair, kneeling on the floor in front of John, and places a gentle hand on his knee.
Sherlock seems to relent at John’s gentle tone. He pauses and looks up at John, who leads him into his chair, takes his temperature, feels his pulse. “Temp’s normal, pulse is a bit high, but I’ll need you to rest for a few minutes before getting an accurate reading, so sit still.” He sits across from Sherlock and starts questioning him. “Describe the pain for me. Is it dull, throbbing, stabbing? Is it only on the left side?”
“I was considering how to make the most out of our day. We could go to the village, do some shopping for dinner, see some local sights—”
of them. So, at the end of the day, all he wants is to retreat into the privacy of his living quarters and tinker with his violin or sink into his armchair in front of the fireplace and think. Oddly enough, and despite the fact that others rarely come in here, there are two mismatched armchairs by the hearth, facing each other: Sherlock prefers the modern, leather one; the second chair, a wingback upholstered with red damask fabric, gapes empty, as if waiting for the right person to finally sit on it. More often than not, it is Mycroft who ensconces himself in that armchair, looking out of place and sharing opinions Sherlock promptly ignores.
John carries a tray with two steaming mugs and milk to the sofa and gives Greg a reassuring smile. He hadn’t meant to bristle at his former colleague but the memory from being shot in the shoulder and invalided home from Afghanistan still smarts. He had enjoyed the exciting, adrenaline-fuelled life in the military; his medical education, diligently acquired during his years learning the ins and outs of security service at MI5, had landed him a place as an army doctor. He was often close to the action, always ready to intervene at a moment’s notice. It had been in Helmand that John met Major James Sholto after being assigned to his unit all those years ago.
“Please do try and remain calm after hearing what I am about to say,” says Sherlock with obvious effort to remain calm himself. “There is something fastened in the engine and I am very sure it’s…a block of plastic explosive. And that’s where the wiring is coming from.”
They write back and forth for the next few days, each e-mail flowing easier and slipping slowly but steadily into the familiar terrain of light banter. In a silent agreement, they forgo talking about what constitutes forgiveness or what the next steps may be – simply because they are already being taken. These are letters that Sherlock opens without thinking twice about it, and still destiny, time, fate, whatever one may call it, trudges forth. They cannot change the past, but perhaps they help mould the future.
“Likewise, Mary,” John replies, feeling anything but. “Surprised to see you here, I don’t remember your name on the guest list.”
John frowns. “Shouldn’t he know about them? Also, it sounds like you need the police, not a bodyguard.”
John keeps an eye on the proceedings while desperately trying to distract himself enough to not linger on the lyrics of the songs Sherlock chose. Is the man trying to kill him? He uses his work as an excuse to glide from one end of the room to the other, but makes the mistake of locking eyes with Sherlock mid-song.
John seems to accept this answer with a thoughtful nod; he disposes of the flannel, lies down and snuggles up to Sherlock’s limp form, throwing an arm over his chest and hugging him closer. Sherlock turns and drapes himself over John’s right side, tucking his head under John’s chin. John draws nonsensical patterns with his left hand across Sherlock’s back, fingertips brushing up and down his spine, while his right one buries itself in Sherlock’s sweat-damp curls. Sherlock hums a contented purr, their breathing syncing, the heat from John’s surprisingly smooth skin permeating layers and layers of skin and armour in Sherlock’s body.
Sherlock is so taken aback by Molly’s attitude he simply gapes at her and falls heavily on the seat. He accepts a mug with a sheepish ‘thank you’ and takes a sip.
There’s the same constructed apology John presented him weeks ago. There’s regret, and sadness and longing.
John realises he has been quiet for a moment too long, lost in swirling memories. “It’s fine. Just something I don’t like to talk about. Sugar?”
“What am I to do? What was I expecting?” Sherlock raises wet eyes at Mycroft, his breath ragged with unshed tears. “Yes, you were right, satisfied? You were right,” and the last scrapes of energy go into a pathetic attempt to inject venom in his voice.
John opens his mouth to insist on a goodbye but the slight tremble in Sherlock’s voice arrests him. There’s a wet sheen in his eyes that disarms John, and his final goodbye dies on the tip of his tongue.
It’s just words on paper. They can’t change the past, but they don’t determine the future either. That is all up to him instead.
His prayers are answered: the day of the trip (a weekday, to avoid big crowds and long lines) is the first sunny day after a long week of drizzle and greyness, and his spirits are high. Sherlock is less engaged in the whole affair. He shifts uncomfortable in the seat (John had insisted on driving) and looks bored through the window at the passing landscape. At the first sight of the island where the park is built, he scrunches his nose in distaste. Diverse rides shape a profile that rises above the tree line and cuts against the blue sky; the water surrounding the island shimmers with the morning sun. They drive through the car entrance and park the car near the bridge that connects mainland to the isle. As they step out, the air is filled with whooshing sounds of train cars in high speed and distant screams of terror and joy.
The wave of fury Sherlock experienced earlier today tries to wash over him again. Yes, he’s tested the soil because that’s what one does if one is invested in making the most out of one’s cultivation. He needed to know what pH he’s dealing with and whether it requires correction; if there’s enough calcium, phosphorus, nitrogen; if it’s sand or clay, coarse and rocky or fine and dusty. Something in John’s comment grates on Sherlock’s nerves and he is aware he’s overreacting, but good
“I’m. I’m sorry, Molly.” John tried to control himself. He wiped tears with the back of his hand. “I. Wait, let me.” He picked a visiting card from a small pocket in his suitcase and handed it to her. “DSMT: Deus Sex Machina Toys.”
The morning sun is still shining, and a cool wind picks up and robs trees of their last leaves. With the white noise of distant traffic muffled by the high walls, the leaves swirling in the breeze and rustling down to the ground, and a drop of sweat running down his spine, John knows, with terrifying clarity, that he is losing himself.
A pair of sharp, intelligent eyes burrow into John’s, azure on grey, scrutinising and questioning, then relaxing and accepting whatever it is they find there. They share a smile, and with one last squeeze, they release hands and continue to walk in silence. If they walk a bit closer, elbows brushing and the sunny afternoon light wrapping around them, they do not comment on it.
John watches as his words slap Mycroft with an almost physical violence, how they make him flinch despite the polite and impersonal front he attempts to put on.
Sherlock is dimly aware he too is making incoherent sounds, but can’t for the life of him care about it right now, not when he is under John Watson’s spell. Sweat beads on their bodies, and Sherlock loses himself in the sensation of slick and warm skin, John’s movements spreading dampness between their trapped thighs and groins. The duvet they did not care to pull back is smooth and downy against his back; the bedroom is filled with their heavy breaths, the rhythmic creaking of a loose spring in the mattress, the rasp of skin on skin, lewd moans and shuddery
Mycroft gives him an enigmatic smile. “You make it sound like it’s a minor job, John. I keep him out of trouble, or try to at least.” Mycroft looks down at his carefully-manicured nails and delivers the rest of his thoughts with a softer tone, “Sometimes I keep the troubles out of him, so to speak.” He flicks his eyes up to John’s but in this movement, John detects an almost imperceptible pause.
His client. John tenses as he becomes more alert and he turns to see Sherlock sleeping, an almost imperceptible snore on every exhale. His curls are a perfect riot, spread wild on John’s pillow, and he looks so relaxed, sharp features softened by sleep and the morning light. John smiles, memories of Sherlock’s loud gasps in the throes of orgasm contrasting with the present angelical silence.
“I suppose it’s the truth.” Sherlock half turns to glance at his own back in the mirror. “When you’re known for being a certain way, when people convince themselves you are a certain way, you might as well just become it. And enjoy it.” He glances sideways at John. “You’re an expert on famous people; you must agree that most of us are, indeed, arseholes.”
Sherlock continues, relentless. “Oh. Oh! No, that’s not quite it, is it? You’re afraid of starting to care too much for them. Commitment. You think it compromises you.” John suppresses a groan and looks resolutely to the exit of the shop. “Well, John, I can only agree with you.”
“Ah, here we are, almost done, gentlemen.” If Mr Hardy perceives any tension in the air, his chirpy tone doesn’t betray it.
Sherlock tightens his bow with enough ferocity to make his brother guess his intentions of incursions into those postmodernist pieces Mycroft isn’t particularly fond of.
As he gets up and walks to the door, he hears a car door slamming shut. One person only, then. Before they have the chance to rap at his door, Sherlock opens it.
John tries to not show how his heart is breaking over this confession, and against his better judgement – and private will – he asks, “Do you want to try to have that moment back? To fit
A knot had unravelled in Sherlock’s belly when he saw John recoiling from the harpy. Not that it’s his place to control who flirts with John. After all, John had been very clear: a one-night stand, that’s it.
was one of the strangest places he had visited as a sales rep for DSMT. But, despite having been in this business for only a few months, it was not the
“‘I have nothing, you have everything. Soon, you will be nothing, drowning in your bathtub, in your blood,’” John reads out loud. He picks another one, “‘I will have the privilege of your last heartbeat, after I carve it out of your chest.’ Christ. How many of these did he get?”
John is clutching his glass of orange juice. He hasn’t taken a sip – he’s brooding, jaw clenched and fury rising. He knew better than to listen to Greg and be convinced to give this job a shot.
And if that wasn’t typical John Watson. The man knew Sherlock inside out, and it took him one sleepy look at Sherlock’s face to know he was, indeed, planning things in his head, early hour be damned. Sherlock gazed at John, unable to avoid a fond grin spreading on his face.
as he pointed to his injured eye, conscious that there was a kernel of unfairness, given that John had rescued him from Culverton Smith’s murderous intentions, but that had not healed the hurt from the one man he… the one person he ever… from
And he is learning a new sort of contentment here in Sussex. He’s done with chasing thrills, whether from adrenaline rushes or chemically induced. He still needs to fill his days with something to do with his hands and problems to distract him from those darker thoughts that nudge at the edge of his conscience. To the outside onlooker, this change of pace may seem to be unnatural for a man like Sherlock Holmes, but Sherlock knows this is where he was always heading. This, or a premature end to his life, had he succumbed to the consequences of his less well-thought-through thrill-chasing moments. What many may not realise is that he is no less intellectually stimulated now than what he was back in Baker Street. It’s just different. And his isolation was helping him keeping the pace he was comfortable with, without the pressures of outside opinions. A managed serenity through the landscape of pain.
Greg cringes, guilt invading him with the memory of the last press conference he ever convinced Sherlock to attend. Fair point, he has to admit. Sherlock unpacking the deerstalker and being coaxed into wearing it in front of dozens of cameras, a fake smile plastered on his face, looking like he wanted to be a million miles away.
“That’s great, Sherlock! And even if it does not work, you’ll still have had some fun. Nothing lost, right?” John’s imagination starts running loose: they could go on a day trip to Thorpe Park, perhaps even stay a night in the area, take Sherlock to a nice restaurant as a reward…
John walks on, polished oak floorboards creaking softly under his feet, until he finally discerns a rhythmic beat from the building ruckus. He finds the room where the music comes from and steps inside. Here, the air is thick from the mingled sweat and odours of a whirlwind of people that are moving about; at the end of the room, there is a low stage where several dancers move their bodies to the beat, like a scene from
John closes his eyes, but it does not help. Nothing helps. He opens them again, sees the empty armchair in front of him. Resists the urge to touch it.
“Ha, so it is, if I correctly read the fees you take,” Greg jokes, and John is flooded with gratitude at his mate’s deflection.
!” The mob goes wild at this, shouts and whistles filling the air and intensifying when Sherlock steps onto the stage. The lights dim; a spotlight floods Sherlock’s walk.
They eat at one of the park’s restaurants. Sherlock orders fish and chips and John a hamburger and they end up picking bits from each other’s plates while deciding what to go on after lunch. As the day advances, more people flow in, mostly school groups and parents with young children, and while it is not packed, the place starts to feel populated. There’s less stamina for high thrilling rides after food, and the two men take a leisurely stroll around the park, drifting towards quieter areas. They’re never really far away from any ride, and the blend of mechanical sounds with those of merriment is a constant background, but they find a path that runs along the water and slow their pace.
Irene narrows her eyes at Richard. She grabs his arm none too gently but he shakes it off and slides past Sherlock, locking eyes with him.
“I upset you with my…” Sherlock just does a wide movement, encompassing loosely everything on the table and around them.
He who repressed emotions to enhance his intellectual skills but was overwhelmed by his love to one certain army doctor.
“But there is a minimum I am able to accept. He’ll have to come to terms with these conditions too, once I force him to admit he’s in love with you. But you? Take what you need — but no more than that. Shag him, take him on cases, I don’t care. I know you want him. But at the end of the day, he returns to me.”
“Thank you. I’m glad you liked it,” and then, after a moment’s hesitation, “it’s… nice to have some company, for a change.”
Molly parks the limo in front of the house. John crosses the lawn in a hurry to meet her as she gets up from the driver’s seat, clad in her usual uniform.
Silence follows, Mycroft’s reply working through Sherlock’s internal gears, settling itself in Sherlock’s heart chambers. Sentimental, yes, but the problem cannot be rationalised into a scientific method. Sherlock had assumed John was only after a fling, when in fact he had no data to support his theory – a capital mistake. John is, in fact, fearless in all his acts except the ones that put his heart in someone else’s hands.
Inside, the fire crackles in the hearth. It’s one of those quiet evenings, when there is no case to work on, no work the next day at the surgery, nowhere to be other than the comfort of the flat. The food has been eaten, the washing up has been done, and there’s nothing worth watching on the telly.
Sherlock’s eyes close of their own accord at the first touch of John’s lips. Warm, honey-sweet, velvet lips. John’s hand on his cheek is warm and gentle, fingers lightly caressing his jaw; he slides his hand to Sherlock’s nape and tilts his head just so. The kiss turns into more than just a tentative brush of lips, tongues licking, exploring, shy at first, and then increasingly urgent and needy.
He looks up from his plate to see John scraping a last piece of tomato while throwing him a shy glance. It’s positively
“Of course I knew about Victor. Not a difficult deduction what with him being the only person having the keys to the room.” Good
They share a plate of biscuits and drink tea at their kitchen table a few minutes later. Sherlock feels more like himself now. It is time to start gently easing John into his plan.
. Not much information there – a surname of Irish origin, very common in the UK. Might not be his real name, even. But a niggling thought that this is a fact of importance plants itself in his head.
John’s breathing is also fast and his heart is racing. His condition is good, but he had definitely been overdressed for jogging and is now paying the price for it. “Just doing my job,” he replies between two harsh exhales.
John opens the door, taking only the briefest of moments to place the woman in front of him in the correct time and space. “Ellie! Oh wow! What a surprise! Come in, come in!”
A few days pass. Sherlock still complains about intermittent pain, but in general it seems to be gradually disappearing. The urine culture comes back negative for bacteria, and Sherlock manages pain with NSAIDs under John’s watchful eye.
The bleak June day insists on withholding sunshine in favour of an unseasonable chilly drizzle, dulling down the bright colours of Spring.
. Oh, is it evening already? He is back from the surgery, then. But his gait is light, instead of carrying the weariness of a day filled with dullness.
He snatches his mobile from a pocket, but instead of opening some noise-producing app, he finds himself scrolling through his contacts. His heart thumps in his chest, the dull pain from an old bullet wound making itself known.
“I wanted to have a word with you. Won’t take long.” She does not shed her coat but invites herself to John’s armchair. I hate it when she sits on it, as if her claim on his life was not large enough already. But there is a game to play. I sit across from her.
a one-night stand man, no matter what gibberish the tabloids enjoy publishing. He doesn’t do casual sex. The level of intimacy that is shared isn’t something he easily accesses, either by choice or by design. It’s kept for those who catch his interest and, he has to admit, his heart. So John’s dismissal of what they had rankles him to no end.
“It’s not the same department, you won’t see radiology.” John suspects Sherlock is unwilling to cross paths with any personnel who might have been involved in his CT scan. Chances are very low, anyway – different shift, different clinic in the large hospital. “Short cab ride, and as I said, I’ll come with you.”
is often banished from his mind; he doesn’t need to dwell on it lest those dark thoughts take hold. The line shines acutely bright now, is brought to the surface with John’s presence here.
“Those are letters from just last week. Some are print-outs of emails and stuff posted anonymously on social media.” Greg sits on a second armchair.
They finally come. The sobs. It took days but here they are, raising like violent bubbles exploding through his chest. John sinks in his chair, face on his hands, and lets the tears run, unbidden but necessary. He knows he should call Ella, get grief counselling but in the end, it all comes down to the same – the most important person in his life is gone forever and nothing will bring him back.
“Good morning, John.” Sherlock places a gentle kiss on John’s forehead. “It is not possible to listen to one’s thoughts as they do not emit sound waves in the audible range.”
That’s it. There’s limits for everything. Sherlock twirls to escape the man’s grip and pushes his shoulder back, but in the process he loses his own balance, drops the microphone, and staggers back towards the edge of the stage. One step too many, as a foot meets not ground but emptiness and he’s stumbling onto the crowd. The place is so packed that he falls on the softness of human bodies, which eagerly reach for his own and move him along above their heads.
echoed in his thoughts. There’s sage and coriander and basil, fragrant as he smears leaves between calloused fingers, desperately trying to push away the smell of John’s shampoo as he buried his nose in his hair. Sherlock had wanted to taste John’s tears, but he knew better than to try.
There had been the one visit from Mycroft, just over a month ago, when the spring was still early and chilly but the sun warm enough for tea outdoors. For one afternoon the second patio chair had had its use. The brothers had sat in silence, drinking tea with honey and biscuits.
“Not. A. Word. Mycroft.” Sherlock shoves past Mycroft and makes a bee line to the bathroom, shutting the door loudly after him.
Sherlock peels John’s shirt off his torso, making him lift one arm, then another to slide shirtsleeves off; the movement is inelegant due to their positions, and John chuckles. Sherlock smiles; it could have been an embarrassing moment, this juvenile fashion of removing clothes, but instead there’s humour, lightness, tenderness. Sherlock’s never thought sex could be this type of fun, with giggles and playfulness. John’s shirt joins Sherlock’s in a heap on the floor.
John could not hold it any longer. He doubled over laughing. To hell with the lost sales commission; he hadn’t felt this alive in years. Molly tried and failed to look offended, as she furiously pursed her lips to avoid smiling.
down on his groin, and Sherlock makes an inhuman effort to not howl in pleasure. John gently removes Sherlock’s hands from his arse, manoeuvres them to pin Sherlock’s wrists above his head on the soft mattress, and rubs deliberately again and again against Sherlock’s rapidly filling hardness.
“Hmmm,” Sherlock moans in misery, a shake of his head making his inky curls bob softly. John nods in sympathy: Sherlock rarely drinks, and tonight they both went way beyond their limits.
John considers Molly’s words. The constant fear of losing a client is something he has always been able to keep in check. It’s an always present risk, but John has been in the business long enough to not let the fear take over and impact his focus. His mind wanders to his goodbye conversation with James a few months or a lifetime ago; it was fear driving him away then, he can admit that now.
John is baffled. Here he is, his biggest dream literally falling on his lap, and he has no idea what to do with it. “Wh-what do you want to do about it?”
“Don’t worry, the IQ of the screeching masses will go up as soon as you join them,” John quips back.
“He’ll– hold on, that’s probably Bill.” Molly roots through her purse and fishes out a buzzing mobile. She walks a few steps away, answering the call in soft tones. John lets her voice ebb into a distant drone in his awareness, too drained to pay any close attention. Right now, it’s a relief to have someone else take charge.
John clamps his mouth shut and looks away, body swaying towards the exit. Better to focus on his job instead of taking Sherlock’s bait.
At that point, John notices a woman also striding towards him with a stern expression on her face. She moves, catlike, her figure-hugging black clothes making John think of a ninja – one with dark hair meticulously arranged into a bun, distrusting blue eyes and blood-red lips. Greg intercepts her and murmurs a few words John cannot hear over the music, but that has the effect of her halting her march towards him. She casts a contemptuous glare at John and retreats into a corner.
John gives him a wider smile, one full of fondness, the sort that makes his face soft and open, and Sherlock aches to reply him in kind. Instead, he accepts John’s offer to do the washing up while he prepares fresh cups of tea. They retreat to the sitting room, and the oppressive atmosphere lifts and disappears in wisps, much like the thunderstorm outside gives way to a cool evening. They sink into armchairs, tea in hand, and continue to say nothing.
