Sherlock looked down, "That's good to know," he sighed, "To tell you the truth, one gets a bit shaky all alone on one of those midnight chargers," his gaze once again fell upon John.
The minutes that passed after that could not really be measured in any sort of quantifiable method. They rolled on and on, but somehow did not seem to be enough. The pair moved together. Sherlock's hips moved up to meet John's more enthusiastically than perhaps John had expected, and it was perfect. He lined up his body with the lissome form and their sweat combined allowed for fluid motion. Though the room was chilled, the heat of exertion and passion flooded around the bed and they were not at all cold. Sherlock growled and bit at the flesh of John's neck. It produced a feral emotion in the army doctor and his murmur sounded like something heavy being dragged over sharp rocks.
The road that lead to the castle was dark and the ancient, looming trees made the way seem that much more ominous. He drove through the woods, attempting to see where the obscure driveway began, for it was set off of the side of the rural road and his GPS had indeed failed due to lack of signal. After quite some time, and a turn around or two, he finally managed to find the entrance. It was probably once a grand entrance to the property, but brush and trees had taken it over and now it barely fit the little rental car. The wrought iron gates climbed up toward the dark winter sky and John craned his neck to look up to the top as he stood before them. Heavy they were, but opened relatively easily with a loud screech to accompany them as he pulled.
Bledlow itself was small and quaint. The rolling, green hills proved to be a most serene backdrop for his drive and he felt more at ease because of it. Houses became few and far between and if one looked off the side of the road, tall grasses and meandering streams would be there to greet tiring eyes. It was getting to be evening when John arrived in the town and a cold drizzle had begun. He stopped in at the local pub to get a bite to eat, not to mention inquire around if anyone had seen his elusive flatmate. He walked in, shaking the slight dampness from his jacket and hanging it on the iron coat rack. Turning from the door with the intention to walk to the bar and sit, he noticed the whole of the pub staring at him. He shifted uncomfortably, but smiled and nodded.
He awoke to wind and rain. The coarse knots bound him, but the knowledge of who put them there held him all the more tightly. At first he wondered what was going on. Why had he been drugged...this time? What made Sherlock want to keep him there? Then it hit him, Sherlock wanted to stay. There was some strange pull this place had over him and it appeared he was loathe to leave it. That was the odd look and the agitation when he had suggested taking a break and finding information elsewhere. But why would he keep John prisoner?
"Another murder," the whole of the room stopped, a few gasps heard around the crowd, "It's happened before, perhaps not in our time, but we all know that place is cursed."
And then the light footfalls were heard through the silence, many of them. Rain soaked leaves swished behind him and soon he heard the growls. He didn't dare look back. He knew they were gaining on him. A large stick lay ahead and he increased his speed, hoping to reach it in time. He ran faster and faster, paying no heed to the strain and drug-induced fatigue in his muscles. At the last moment, he bent down, slid on one foot, and grabbed the branch. Turning over, he came up swinging, hitting the first attacking wolf in the face. There were three others closing in. His hands shook and he swallowed hard. Gripping the stick firmly, he prepared for the onslaught.
"...the phone that has been going off for the past twenty minutes in increasing texts, a bit too often for business, at least his business. Not very successful..."
"She always makes sure we have something to eat. She always makes sure to scold us when we don't sleep..."
Lestrade snickered and Donovan nodded her head in agreement. Anderson reluctantly agreed and the show was back on track.
Greg Lestrade jumped down off of the stage and grabbed Mrs. Hudson from the front table, pulling her up on stage despite the handkerchief she held to her teary eyes. She was received by John, who hugged her tightly. Lestrade, a mischievous smile on his face, hopped down once more and ran to the back where Mycroft sat. The stoic man's face barely held a look of surprise, though inwardly he was completely off-guard, as Greg grabbed him and gave a firm tug. Out of his seat he went and tripped about as he was dragged up to the stage. He gave a look of repulsion to the cast, but Sherlock glanced over and, with some feigned annoyance, Mycroft's face softened. He stood with them and actually allowed himself to enjoy the festivity.
He moved in and lightly brushed his lips against Sherlock's. It only lasted a moment when he heard Sherlock's whispered reply.
"Ahem," came the clearing of a throat from behind them. Tom walked by clad in his royal blue robe and slippers. The lapels of his pajama shirt peeking out from beneath, "Excuse me. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt. I was just after something for a sweet tooth," he turned back to look at the two, red-faced as they were, "I see you beat me to it."
Sherlock noticed something then out of his peripheral, a vision he thought would not come to pass this holiday season. Out of one of the backstage windows, a flurry of soft, white snow was falling. The wind blew it in swirls around the thin, bare trees. They seemed to celebrate its arrival, despite the cold it brought upon them.
"There was not much to look for. This is where I started, but most of these are normal fiction, non-fiction, reference. I needed personal accounts, details, hidden items that have been forgotten. The signal here is rubbish, so my laptop and phone were of no use. When I found the room, I knew I had a breakthrough. It has afforded me more information than anything, however I still cannot find the cause," he looked down and to the side, as he often did when having to admit something he had no desire to admit, "I'm...afraid that it may become more urgent that I do so."
Sherlock stopped and looked at John, "Easy?" He hissed, "Do you think this is easy?" He launched himself to where John sat, his hands grabbing the chair arms. Their faces inches apart, "I am Sherlock Holmes," he growled, "I solve cases. I find murderers. How do I do it? Why do I do it? Because I am like them," he withdrew forcefully and stalked out of the private library.
"Precisely, but where?" he stalked off in the direction of the hidden room. Once inside, Sherlock stood centered in the chamber, hands at his temples, "He was found not far from this room. His room. This was his space. He was coming from here, coming from hiding it. Secret, hidden. Why? He knew. He knew he was going to die. He would have thought about the old woman, about her curse, about the rose. What did the rose mean to her?" Sherlock rambled.
"Let me in," Sherlock growled in dominance. He ground his hips against John finding the already prominent response. John stifled a moan.
John's chest tightened. Sherlock was here. For one reason or another, he had not solved the case, but he had also failed to contact John for backup. It was strange of him to not answer his phone, but perhaps the service in the area was not good. He checked his phone. Three bars, not bad. It was already six o'clock though and he did not relish driving in the dark, but he'd rather have the peace of mind knowing everything was ok. And the townsfolk were proving to be less than friendly. He had only been there a matter of minutes and he felt he had already out-stayed his welcome.
John spun around and said with a gleam in his eye, "Well, break your leg, or your ankle, or your neck, just don't break anything valuable," with that he dashed out the side door in search of the Main Event.
I had left for the surgery around eight that morning. I didn’t work there regularly anymore, just sort-of filled in. The day had been uneventful. There were a few cases of flu, a twisted ankle, one second degree burn, and two colds. Nothing extraordinary for a mid-September day. The lack of excitement, coupled with the current domestic situation, made me anxious to get home. Normally, Mrs. Hudson was there for back up at the very least. Most often she was the primary caretaker, of both of my children. Today she was visiting a friend, so Sherlock was on his own.
The weight of his confession, great and mournful that it was, pulled him down to rest atop Sherlock's chest as it gave it's final release and stopped all together. He felt it. Deep inside him it felt true and horrific in it's ceasing. The world seemed to stop along with that breath and the silence, that should never have been there, was like a wave crashing around him. It was deafening, matched only by the sound of his own cries to the midday sun. He forgot everything then, clutching Sherlock and holding him tight to his chest. It occurred to him that perhaps, by some strange force, the one that made this nightmare a reality to begin with would transfer his life to the lifeless. If one chest heaved with enough sorrow, perhaps the other would hear and come to its rescue. These were thoughts that normally would not have entered the mind of a military physician in a moment such as this. However, the past few weeks had proven that normal was anything but, and what one sees may only be their truth due to a deplorable lack of visibility on the counterpart. Admitting the reality of this was not done lightly, but John in all his skepticism, saw it. The fantastic was here, not imprisoned in the delicate pages of a book nor on a parchment of whimsical prose.
He checked Sherlock's room first, but the lights were out and there was no answer at the door. He went to his own room on the off-chance Sherlock had sought him out. But no one was there either. He ran back to the front of the lodge. There were still people filing into the entrance and the lobby was brimful. He sighed with frustration; he needed to find Sherlock and soon. John cut through the crowd with urgency. He moved so quickly, he scarcely noticed bumping into the shoulder of none other than the elder Holmes brother, Mycroft.
"Good evening," he said briefly and continued on to the closest seat at the end of the polished wood counter. He sat and attempted to ignore the looks and whisperings of the room. This was, after all, a small town and he was an outsider. He understood, but that did not make it any less awkward.
John turned his head, annoyed at the ill-mannered interruption, and quipped, "I don't believe that is any of your business," he then turned back and addressed the bartender, "I'll have a pint and the fish sandwich with crisps, if you have them."
Sherlock narrowed his eyes at John and took a large pull from his drink. John just smiled with satisfaction.
"We aren't checking in," Sherlock said curtly, "I'm Sherlock Holmes and this is John Watson. We are here for the murders."
"It's a shame about the lodge. With no snow plus the murders," he took a spoonful of soup, "I hope the business picks up for her."
"You're not a beast," John called out, his voice found. But only the iron door hinges responded in their wind-ravaged way and it quieted him, "You're not a beast," he repeated softly.
Later that evening, John lay awake in his bed staring at the ceiling. For some reason, he could not sleep no matter how many times he fluffed his pillow or changed positions. He sighed into the cool air of his room. Then he remembered that Tom had said there were some sandwiches left behind the counter of the restaurant if he became hungry. Perhaps if his stomach had something in it,  it could persuade his mind to allow him to sleep. He got up and put on his robe, his red pajamas in stark contrast to the white of the plush material. Putting on his shoes, he stepped out into the brisk night air and headed toward the main building.
"Mycroft," John said with surprise. He had invited all of the Holmes', but he had not expected this particular one to show, "I'm sorry, I'd love to exchange insults with you, but I'm looking for Sherlock. It's almost time for..."
"Don't you see? All of the murders, the suicides, they are all the same. The cause is the same!" His look had become as intense as ever and the space around him seemed to hum.
"Ok," he moved on, "Let's have a look at what you have found so far, yeah?"  John walked past the stagnant detective into the hallway and pointed to the doors on either side, "Which one is yours?"
John got up and followed him out the double doors and into the parlor. It was surrounded on two sides by picture windows. The embers of the fire reflected warmly in the glass panes. The whole room was dimly lit by a few vintage lamps that accompanied the firelight. The pit itself was surrounded by benches where floral seats were topped with green and red cushions. The entire lodge was reminiscent of the 1950s. It wasn't that it had not been updated, but the style was very much from a different time. It was inviting and peaceful. It seemed to fit, and at the moment, Sherlock seemed to fit with it. A softer intonation had found its way into his voice and mirth lay only partially hidden behind his eyes.
I looked to where her tiny finger was pointing. There, behind the beakers was a box of washable, non-toxic food coloring. Upon further inspection I discovered several paint brushes and sheets of white paper. The table had been covered with newspaper and a cup of water with used brushes sat in the far corner. I looked up from the table and peered around the kitchen. Through my tirade I had neglected to observe the multiple paintings hung on a string with clothes pins to dry. They were brightly colored, though some looked like they were overly mixed, bordering on black. Rosie showed me her hands. They were perfect, delicate, small, and all the colors of the rainbow.
If his breath was hot, then his voice was the heat of the sun on a summer's day in the country. It pulled the other man away. Away from the manor, away from England; somewhere where there was nothing but this. Nothing but the feeling of home and warmth. Where fields stretched on forever and the sky was not a hinderance, but rather a calling. In this world, you could go anywhere; you could be everywhere. And that was unquestionably where Sherlock was in this moment. It was the last moment, and then there was nothing but shallow breathing and a whispering wind outside the frozen windows of the room.
"When it was built," Lestrade recounted, "I don't know, in the 1700s? Anyway, a family of rank owned it; a mother, a father, and their only son, plus their staff lived there. The story goes that the parents died and left the son with only the attendants. Well, being secluded, wealthy, and having a wait staff, he got spoiled, selfish, and all that. Somehow, he gets engaged, but on the eve of their wedding, he goes crazy and kills his fiancé. Not long after, the servants found him dead as well. The story says that some of the staff witnessed him at the door earlier that week speaking to an old beggar woman. Though the night was dark and the sky filled with thunder, he refused the old woman a place to stay. The accounts say his voice was filled with disgust, though that was not uncommon for the self-serving young man. The woman had then offered him a rose in return for lodging; it appeared to be all she had to give. The young lord laughed and threw the rose out into the rain. Then they see this bright light, right? And they could swear they heard another woman speaking, as if she was putting a curse on the man. When the door slammed shut, the force of the wind blew out the surrounding candles. Though dark, the servants saw their Lord as some sort of beast. He covered his face and ran to his room. After that, no one saw him alive again."
Sherlock opened John's laptop, quickly pulling up a news story, "Changed your password again," he said nonchalantly.
"The petals aren't going to fall. We are going to figure something out," he patted at Sherlock's hand with the soft cloth. Outwardly, he was calm and collected. Inside his stomach was consumed with knots.
John rubbed his face in exasperation, "Focus, Sherlock. Why you? The others, if the account is right, would have had no love in their hearts, but you are not that way. I don't care how many times you profess to be a high-functioning sociopath...why would you be affected?"
No response came. John checked his eyes again, pulling the lids back carefully. Those blue-green eyes that were always so clever and calculating were still unfocused. He sighed in frustration, his hand on the side of Sherlock's face. Then the eyes were upon him, focused and raging. He grabbed John's shirt and made as if to bring him down, but instead screamed, shaking and recoiling to the floor. Though his fingers had left the material of the white shirt behind, they still curled and shook. His whole body was racked with a searing pain and he coiled in on himself. It subsided, briefly, and John once again drew near, placing his hand on Sherlock's back.
Discomfort filled the room and I could no longer stand it, “Listen, Sherlock, I’m sorry. I saw the table and the beakers and I just, well, I assumed. You’re always saying that I see, but do not observe,” I shuffled my feet a bit, “I should never have doubted you,” my eyes met his and I knew that he could see the apology in them. And though I am admittedly not the most observant person, I could see the hurt begin to melt away in his.
John sighed, exasperated, "Look, we are not going to get very far like this, and frankly, it's getting a little odd. Now, what information have you collected? Where have you been working?" He squinted at his friend, a thought entering his head, "Are you alright? Been sleeping much?"
Gaston narrowed his eyes at John, but looked back to the young lady at his side. He grinned, took her arm, and lead her back to where he had previously been sitting. As John's eyes followed them, he noticed there were two more young women already sat by the imposing leather chair. He had not noticed them when he had entered. Each looked identical to the woman in red, with shiny blond hair tied back into a pony tail and pouting red lips. These women were dressed in similar dresses, only one was green and one was yellow. Triplets then. They fawned over Gaston and scooted as close as possible to him as he sat. It was a bit odd. John just shook his head at the scene before him and proceeded to tuck in to his food.
"You need rest or you'll end up like the others!" He shot back, his voice raising. He was up and out of his chair before he could stop himself. Lack of sleep and stress of the situation taking hold of his countenance.
Before he could finish, a familiar face came walking in the side door carrying a bag of groceries. A young boy, about fourteen, with wavy ginger hair and pink cheeks followed her with a stack of fire wood in his arms.
Walking into the lobby, he could hear a violin playing softly. Not surprisingly, he found Sherlock standing near the stage playing a Christmas tune in a slow, solemn way. At first, he did not see John come in. The melody continued to flow throughout the room. John sat at the counter quietly and listened. It reminded him of the dream he had dreamt not more than a week before. It was the nostalgic hum of White Christmas. John put his elbow on the smooth countertop and leaned on his hand. His eyes closed and he tried his best to remember a time that the song hadn't meant disaster to him. So many Christmases had been spent alone, unhappy, or away from home, but then there was last year. His first Christmas at 221B Baker Street. He smiled. For reasons unknown, Sherlock became a bit less of an arse at Christmas. Perhaps it was his gift to the world, but John felt it might be that he just really liked the holiday. Perhaps, the sociopath's heart grew three sizes that day, just as the green, ill-tempered Grinch from the popular children's story. John chuckled.
The journey back to the manor was cold and long. John did not relish returning to the aging castle, but it was the closest and safest place at the moment and Sherlock needed medical attention. The sun was over the horizon now and swaths of pink and orange guided their way. John pushed open the heavy door. Sherlock was hanging on firmly to his shoulders as they moved inside. The fire was smoldering in the study and John tended it after a frigid Sherlock was safely placed in the plush arm chair in front of it. He was able to get it relit and the room began to warm slightly. John turned his attention to his friend, regarding him with a doctor's eye. His jacket was ruined. That was the first item to come off. The material was torn to shreds along with the white shirt beneath. A bit of luck that was; the claws ran through the cloth more than they had run through Sherlock. He began to tear the clothing apart to clear the way to the actual wounds. Sherlock sat up and allowed him to pull the jacket and shirt back and down over his thin shoulders. The fragile skin on his chest and arm moved and strained along with him as the clothing was shed. He hissed in discomfort.
The effect did not take hold, "Lies! Why do people lie? They lie to me because they know I know the truth and they hate me for it. And I hate them because they have always hated me. They want me to go away...the freak, the emotionless monster," he spat, now pacing the floor, "I am no better than the criminals I catch, no better than the vermin that roam the streets...a beast!" at this he bent over and pulled a chair up off of the floor. Holding it high above his head, he threw it across the room with a strength John had never seen. It broke into several pieces as it hit the opposite wall and clattered to the floor.
Sherlock turned to me, looking as though he was about to launch into one of his practical ramblings about how a toddler’s motor skills were too underdeveloped to make such a conclusion, but all he said was, “Yes.”
Sherlock rose from the cushion then, walking over to a nearby table & examining the trinkets adorning it with feigned interest. He felt a bit exposed and he did not like it. John, feeling the discomfort walked over to his friend and gently took his arm.
"Things have been going so well. I'm surprised. I was a little skeptical when John first called. Although, we'll see what the freak does tomorrow night. It should be entertaining, if nothing else," Donovan said.
"Why have you come?" His tone was low and warning. He took another step, "You've come to see me, have you? To see if the beast was still alive?" His voice was growing as was his stance. John held out his arm as if to calm the situation, though he feared this may be impossible.
This turned out to be folly. The car sat where John had left it, however the hood was up and the sabotage apparent.
"I was in another part of the house," his eyes darted up and down, and his head lolled from side to side. It was like a cat sizing up a creature of quarry before it, and it struck John as odd.
Except for one thing. For it must be mentioned that fantastical events can lead to moments of unparalleled bliss for those that have the good fortune to discover them. And in this spirit, if one peered into the windows of 221B on any impossible and fantastical evening, one might just glance a couple mid-waltz. Music playing in their warm sitting room, a man and a beast dance and are taken away, back to an empty ballroom in a castle far, far away.
With that, each man stalked off in their own direction. Sherlock toward his bungalow, and John back toward the lodge. Each door slammed in turn, it's finality echoing through the quiet winter countryside.
Gaston shook his head, "They both had cars, they both would have driven back through town. Someone would have recognized them; they don't exactly blend in. No, they're still up there. And if they are still alive, they are a threat."
That was about the best response I could have hoped for, vague though it was. Still, I decided to leave early that day. As I rode in the cab, I felt fairly good about the whole thing. Of course Sherlock was fine with her. He was a right prat sometimes, but he loved her and would not allow any harm to come to her. He had babysat before, though usually with help or only for a short time. I wondered as I stared at the buildings passing by what the two of them had gotten up to. The thought of Sherlock playing with dolls on the floor with a cheerfully babbling little girl brought a rather amused grin to my face. I half hoped that I would walk in on a scene like that. And though I would want to remark in a sarcastic fashion, the warm feeling it would give me would win out. I imagined myself slowly sitting down next to the both of them, creaking knees and all, and taking Rosie in my lap. I’d give her a tight squeeze that she’d only tolerate for a second before pushing me away. She was always so busy and the chance to play with her dolls on the floor would be the priority in her two year old mind.
"It's past eight. And I'm afraid to ask if you have made arrangements for lodging," came the snarky reply.
John reached the large wooden door first and unlocked the iron bolt. What greeted him next was completely unforeseen. A crowd of a dozen or so people stood outside the manor, some at the bottom of the stairs, some littered upon them. Some he recognized from the pub and some he did not. Some wore faces of stone and mortar, and some fear and apprehension. The one thing he could not help but notice was the leader of the group standing before him; red shirt opened at the neck, brown pants sporting a gun holstered and half hidden at his side, his boots shined as if they had never seen a rainy day. He remembered the man well, and the superior and confrontational look he held was no different than the evening they had met in the pub.
John stilled those hands with his own, speaking as evenly and with as much solace as possible, "You don't happen to know where they kept the first aid, do you?"
John gathered his strength and pushed back against the frenetic man. He managed to get him back a few steps before Sherlock responded. He shoved John, causing him to fall backward onto the bed. In an instant, he was on top of him, pinning him down. John fought, but soon settled when he noticed that Sherlock was no longer on the offensive. The rage had subsided and was replaced with something else, something hidden. He lay looking up at the man. Sherlock's curly hair was wild and seemed far longer than before, for it hung forward over his face and neck. He was hunched and breathing hard. His face was intent, but becoming calmer as the seconds passed. It was changing to a look that was rarely seen on the consulting detective's face. It was honest realization and delicious fear. It was the undeniable look of one who would say something, but denies themselves for want of acceptance. Instead, John found that face leaning down toward his own. It brushed against his left cheek and nuzzled the base of his neck. It was confession seen, but not said, And it was here that John found himself wondering why that particular path was always so much easier. His eyes closed, and for a moment he was lost in the sensation, the brutal quarrel all but forgotten. It was then that he came to his own, very private, realization. It was him; it was Sherlock. It was Sherlock, on top of him, putting soft lips to heated skin. His skin, his skin was heated. And it was Sherlock doing it to him. His eyes went wide, his breath hitched, and he could bear the silence no longer.
He sat up, pulling off his jumper and shirt and discarding them on the floor beside the bed, "Sit up," he commanded gently. Sherlock's stunned look was comical as he had obviously not expected the brash movement. His eyes feasted over John's chest and arms, fit as they were. Sherlock moved to rest on one elbow. John reached for him with a trembling hand. The contact was soft, affectionate, if not comforting. His thin chest rose and fell with hastened breath and heartbeats that came pounding more heavily than the iron knocker adorning the entrance to the castle. He came to sit in front of the blond man, who slowly wrapped one leg over the both of his. John straddled him wearing nothing but his blue jeans, settling diffidently down on his lap. He paused, not knowing if the next move should be his. He wanted to say something, but he did not know what that something should be. The intention was clear however, and Sherlock pushed himself up to bring them closer. It was yet another approval and John found himself wanting it. He realized that he wanted this to be ok. Leaning forward, his arms coming to rest beside the ribs of his conquest, John came desperately close to another kiss. But Sherlock would not relent. Leaning back, he teased him, turning his head so that his long curls brushed John's face and he could smell the cologne misted across his neck.
"It's the only logical conclusion to break the curse and our only choice now. Your death is unacceptable. And if you live, perhaps then all this would stop," he hypothesized, "If I give my life to spare yours... I would give my life for yours, John," his voice broke as he sank back down onto the hard stone. All strength was gone now, even the rage had subsided. His breathing was labored and John found that his pulse was slowing. John knelt over him, hands on his shoulders. Sherlock's eyes fluttered and went in and out of focus, as a camera running out of battery. The last petal was falling.
But the song was about at an end and this snapped the former soldier out of his absorption. Mycroft's eyes followed his path as he turned and ran back to the side door of the stage. Just as he reached the curtain, Lestrade came into view on center stage announcing the night's performance. John breathed a sigh of relief. Just then the red velvet curtain flew back and in walked Sherlock with a flourish. The close proximity was unavoidable and they met face to face as the air around them turned to molasses. John swung his arm around Sherlock's neck and pulled him behind the Christmas tree set just beside the curtain. In one smooth move, a passionate kiss was laid upon his lips and the hold upon him tightened lest he attempt to play his fervor false. That, however, would not be the case this night. The game that was afoot was not just that of mystery and play; it was an homage to friendship and an act of love.
"Sherlock!" John grabbed his arm and stepped forward so as to come face to face, "What is going on?"
"No...oh God Sherlock...I can't," he stopped and broke away. The next movement was so quick one might have not seen it happen and thought that John simply appeared between Sherlock's trembling legs. He lined himself up, spitting in his hand and rubbing it on his own cock. He played at the opening, moving the head of his slicked member back and forth over it.
"Sherlock..." John tried, looking back and forth from the painting to his friend, but Sherlock was not listening.
Sherlock stood there. At first he had looked startled, then confused. Now he had turned his attentions to his shoes. He did not look at me. Perhaps it was an admission of guilt, perhaps a mere reaction to the chiding, but he looked somewhat…sad. I could not pay that any mind at the moment, however, what he had done was inexcusable.
Sherlock went to pick it up, but John stayed his hand, "Don't," he grabbed the journal and took it over to the desk. The book was tipped and the rose slid off with ease onto the pile of papers beneath. Two petals fell from it and settled near the edge. He knew it was foolish, but the rules of reality did not seem to pay much heed in this place. He was not taking any chances, the occurrences of late were much too fanciful for his liking. Until he figured it out, no magical blooming rose was being handled by anyone. John sat in the chair and Sherlock moved another over. For the next couple of hours they read.
"I know Sherlock, and we'll find it," he closed the journal, "Let's get some rest and we'll start first thing tomorrow. I'm only asking for a few hours," he entreated.
The drunken pair leaned toward each other to plot, "Let's tell John that we overheard Sherlock on the phone telling someone that he is not going to do the show, that he thinks it's rubbish. We all know he thinks it. Let's have a bit of fun with it!"
“My interests are not solely scientific nor forensic. She is too young for the violin, and I remembered how much I enjoyed painting as a child.”
"Sherlock? Sherlock?!" He shook the other man by the shoulders, "Jesus," he held Sherlock's head, stroking his cheeks, "Wake up, stay with me...Sherlock, please," he gave one cheek a couple of light slaps, "No, no...come on! Wake up!" He fell backwards. A sinking feeling building in the pit of his stomach, "This isn't happening. How can this be real? There has to be a reason, something we missed," A shuddered breath and doctor mode kicked in. He was back over Sherlock, bringing himself face to face. He checked for breathing. It was there, but faint and slowing, "Sherlock, please," he begged, salty tears threatening the corners of his eyes, "Please don't leave," the tears won out and fell freely, marking the dying man's face with shining crystals of despair, "I love you."
In an instant, the heavy door was pulled open the rest of the way and Sherlock appeared looking intense and agitated. The crowd took an instinctual step back, but Gaston's eyes were the only thing that betrayed his particular resolve. Sherlock stepped forward. He was dressed in black trousers and the same navy and silver jacket from the night in the ballroom. A white shirt accompanied it and he would have appeared quite spectacular if not for the disheveled look plaguing his form. The townspeople gasped, for he was much changed.
John struggled with the crude rope above his head. It was tied with knots fit for military inspection and he could not free his hands from it. They were losing a bit of feeling as well and he inched further up on the bed to attempt to regain all dexterity. His hands had been tied together with a single tie to the headboard. His feet had been bound as well, but luckily they were not tied to any part of the bed. If he could get one hand free, that would be all he would need to untie the rest and make his escape. He needed to get out of there as soon as possible. There was certain danger here and Sherlock needed his help. He was sure that the consulting detective was still in the house, but what concerned him was where and in what state. John had awoken with a mild headache, most likely due to whatever concoction was slipped to him earlier. His head was still a trifle fuzzy, but he was focused now and working as fast as he could. His heels dug into the mattress and his fingers ached with strain. Getting out was what mattered; getting to safety was what mattered.
"Homicide is my..." he began, but was abruptly cut off by John's disapproving tut. He sighed and pursed his lips, "Mycroft is coming to Christmas dinner at our parents'," he quickly finished. He fidgeted with the large holiday menu sitting near the wall, pretending to be mildly interested in the image of snow and pine trees on the front.
It must be said that during the opening credits, and as the sweet music began, his hand came to rest upon mine. I looked down and then up. His eyes, blue, and green, and gorgeous, looked back. One rogue curl fell in front of the rest and I felt compelled to brush it aside. Not that it marred his features, you see, but at that very moment, I saw a masterpiece in him.
They walked through the door and into the secret room. It was akin to the room that John was staying in, but larger and at one point in time, more lavishly furnished. This room was twice the size, but was not cared for at all like his own. The draperies were torn and falling, the floor had leaves that had blown in from the terrace, and the upholstery on the chairs was worn and tattered. The room itself was tattered and sad and John felt unhappy upon walking into it. This he did not have time to dwell on however as Sherlock quickly lead him to a chamber adjoining the bedroom.
He knew. He knew I had been thinking about Mary. His voice sounded breathless, as if it were taking all he had to express what was on his mind. Nevertheless, he stood tall. He had not been in the wrong, and he knew it, but he was not one to lord it over me.
"No, the part about the police calling us in being the only clever thing," his mind reeled and he looked out the window as the idea unfurled, "I have a plan."
"Wait, what did you just say?" John cut off the introduction to what could have been a very long rant.
"This is wrong," he said, "I could hurt you. I was going to...hurt you," he sat back once more his palms wringing into his eyes.
"No, I'm not hungry," but he set his violin down and came over to help John find the sandwiches, "I saw him putting them away..." walking behind the dark, glossed-wood bar, he crouched down and opened a paneled door. After a moment, he brought a plate of various sandwiches out of one of the refrigerators under the counter. Some were turkey, some were ham, a few were even liverwurst, and all were crowned with a single green olive. John suddenly realized that he was more hungry than he thought. Maybe the food really would help him sleep.
"Look, it will be easy. I'll call Lestrade and Donovan. We'll create a murder mystery, but we won't tell you who the murderer is. It won't be theatre. In a sense, you'd be solving a case! And helping Mrs. Hudson at the same time," he sat back completely satisfied with his genius plan.
The entryway was grand. A beautiful, wide double staircase spread out before him, its ivory tendrils reaching out to either side. The floor was a creamy off-white marble cut to a pattern by black diamonds. Accompanying it were marble columns that reached high above and John craned his neck once again to see their tops. Tapestries depicting medieval scenes hung from large rods with carved finials. The whole entry was brimming with splendor even in the dim and John was impressed. He walked in and called out into the vast expanse, but only silence answered. He walked forward into the tenebrous room, checking to this side and that for anyone who might be about. There were rooms on either side. Antechambers he suspected, for most doors were closed with no light to speak of, except one. What looked to be firelight came from one of the chambers closest to the staircase. A pale orange light flickered across the marble floor and ornate wooden bannister. John drew closer; he saw no shadow to indicate the presence of another. Nevertheless, he was primed for interaction should the situation arise, sending one hand to brush the handle of his sidearm. Quietly, he ran his other hand along the smooth cherry wood of the door and slowly pushed it open enough to peek his head inside.
"Ah-ha, so you took a case to avoid the festivities, and you saw fit to drag me out to the country a bloody week before Christmas hoping that you 'wouldn't solve the case in time' to be back."
I looked around with over exaggerated awe and appreciation. Then I touched my forehead to hers and gave her a squeeze. And though I felt like a complete arse, I couldn’t help but smile.
John added, "Besides, Sherlock is less likely to say something...unwelcome onstage if you're lying dead on the floor."
"It didn't work then," John said quietly. The fact had been echoing in his mind despite all efforts to ignore it.
His name was Lawrence Hawkes. He had kept the journal from an early age and as the story progressed, his thoughts became more self-centered. After his parents died, he was given anything and everything he had wanted, except for what he wanted most. The servants had done their best, but it was not enough to replace the love of a mother and a father. The pain from his parents death turned him cold to the world, and he wanted nothing to do with it. He had become spoiled, selfish, and unkind. The things provided for him, toys, clothing, horses, they became his focus for they gave him pleasure in a world he felt was devoid of it. They were his world. Human interaction was secondary and he grew apathetic to it. The engagement to the woman who would later become his victim was only at the urging of the mindless faces surrounding him. He accepted it, but admittedly never cared for the young lady.
John drew back from Sherlock, whose cheeks were now a stunning shade of red, "I don't know how I could have doubted you."
"You're stronger than this. Fight it. If anyone can stop this, it's you," warm tears stung behind his eyes, "Baker Street is waiting for us. The work is waiting, Sherlock."
The West Wing was not at all like the marginally well-kept entrance and hallways that he had previously seen. As they walked further and further into it, the tapestries became shabbier. The paintings were slanted and falling off of the walls. Colors seemed faded here and dust layered the surfaces. John almost knocked a statue off of a side table as he passed. Though the candelabras and sconces in the house had been fitted for electricity, they did not provide much more light than their antique counterparts. This part of the house had obviously been more neglected than the rest. Many of the bulbs were missing, the wallpaper peeled hopelessly, and random items had been left in the hallway as improper storage. Finally, through the chaos, they came to a large tapestry hung floor to ceiling on the wall. The picture was of a knight atop his steed looking rather regal. Sherlock pulled it back to reveal a stone wall, much like the rest of the castle in appearance. He then pushed a small, rounded stone that sat neatly in between the larger grey bricks. The sound of pulleys could be heard and a doorway was revealed.
"NO! Don't you talk to me. I am a monster. I treat everyone as mindless peons. Because they're nothing, nothing to me! Because I don't care. I have no love, no soul, only my mind...and what's is that worth?" his voice broke and his brow wrinkled, his eyes grew red at the edges. And then something inside him snapped. It was like witnessing Jekyll and Hyde come to reality. Growling, with curled hair flowing wildly around him, he knocked over chairs and tore the sheets from the bed as he ranted. He jumped up on the now bare mattress. Standing tall with his shoulders back and his legs shoulder-width apart, his stance was war-like and frightening, "You started this," he pontificated to a painting above the headboard, "You were the same. Why?!?"
I stalked over and grabbed her, pulling her up and away from the beaker-strewn table, “What is all of this? I ask you for one thing, Sherlock, one thing,” I paused, the rage boiling inside, “All you had to say was that you had plans, or you needed to work. I could have made other arrangements, I could have…” I sighed, trying to calm myself, but it was no use, “She’s two, Sherlock! You can’t allow a toddler around dangerous experiments, let alone having her assist. For a genius, you are bloody ignorant.”
Molly Hooper ran backstage to congratulate everyone. Her excitement was genuine; she had been so dismayed when she was unable to participate. Now, having seen the excellent job they had done, and the sheer joy on Mrs. Hudson's face, she could hardly contain herself. She gave Sherlock a big hug and kissed him on the cheek. Stepping back, her cheeks flushed and she barely squeaked out an apology before Lestrade came up and embraced her. The consulting detective cocked his head to one side. He always felt awkward when someone hugged him.
"I meant about resolving this. To Hell with the journal. All of these people died from this curse...I can't even believe I'm saying this...and you're next if we don't figure out how to stop it. Jesus, I feel like I'm in some Disney fairytale," John ranted.
"Yes, of course," the boy answered. He was confused, but he got up nonetheless and headed quickly toward the lodge to give the two men privacy. He stopped to look behind as he reached the second stair of the porch, holding on to the pillar as his gait slowed to a crawl. He knew it was not his business, but he was curious as to why John was in such a huff when normally he was very even-tempered. He crept backward toward the door, attempting to be inconspicuous. But John caught him out of the corner of his eye and turned with a look that could have stopped an army. Phil gasped, knowing he was caught, and ran into the lobby, the door flying shut behind him. Satisfied they were alone, John turned back to Sherlock.
“I’ll have you know that I made many a masterpiece in my younger years,” he smiled and the mood lightened.
"What is it?" Came the low whisper. Ominous and curious though it was, it had not been directed at the blond doctor standing beside the bed. Sherlock had moved to the painting and spoke to it closely, running his hand down the canvas, "You were just...like...ME!"
Sherlock surged forward, grabbing him by the shoulders, "There's no time, John," the fervor displayed in his face was intense, unyielding, and completely unexpected.
Sherlock walked briskly through the crisp, brown leaves that littered the ground. Up the stairs he went, into the lobby, and straight to the front desk, John in tow. They set their bags down in an unplanned unison with a noisy thud. A gentleman, tall and thin, whose greying hair was coifed close to his head, stood behind the counter. His demeanor was formal and practiced, as a soldier's might be, but his face was kind. He looked up, smiled, and greeted the two travelers.
"No, it's fine. I'm actually not that cold. It's just very warm in here. I...we thought it would be much colder this time of year. What happened to the snow?" He replied, deflecting her motherly guidance.
The shadows splayed out like vicious spooks upon the walls as curtains of cerulean velvet overlapped the wildly dancing sheers. The enormous French doors that climbed nearly to the ceiling had not been closed properly. And thus, when the wooden door to the room had been slammed without so much as a thought, the doors had flown open, allowing a torrent of chilled air and dry leaves to enter unchecked. The light of the moon had been the only illumination to accompany the few small candle-lit sconces, which promptly blew out with the opening of the balcony doors. The room played in the darkness. Paintings and tapestries that were only half hung and in terrible disrepair knocked against the stone walls. Dust billowed from torn down draperies as they fell from the overturned chairs they rested upon. It muted the space, made the blues, reds, and golds of the decor seem to wash away. A desk sat not far from the heavy, carved wood door that marked the entrance to the chaotic room. It held a ream of papers and a host of pens that had been moved by the initial burst of wind. Now, as air and rain continuously exploded through the curtains, it caught the whole of the stack and sent them flying up into the gale. The bed curtains and coverlet rustled as some of the papers settled upon them, and their newly-conscious occupant.
"Yeah, but even if we don't tell him the story, the freak will still figure it out. No one will want to see that," Donovan replied, "How do we know anyone will show up for this, anyway?"
Donovan stepped in then, overhearing the conversation and coming to understand that the game had not yet been revealed, "Anderson didn't tell you?"
Without uttering a word, Sherlock removed his hand from John's and slid it up to caress his face. The look that appeared was that of confusion, trepidation, but not repulsion, and so he continued. He ran his fingers through John's blond hair. It was a move he had seen in many of John's crap movies. People enjoyed it and it was affectionate. John shifted and cleared his throat, seeing where this might be headed. He was unsure, but he could figure why Sherlock was trying it. There was something between them; there always had been. He was not quite sure what it was, but he knew the silent agreement was that it was to remain unspoken. Though he could not remember agreeing to the stipulation. He loved Sherlock. Random behaviour and insane deductions aside, he would do anything for him. But did that mean he was in love with Sherlock? Wasn't that what the enchantment had required? His heart was beating wildly in his chest and he was doing his best to stay collected, but he felt as he had the night before. He was not sure if what he was thinking was wrong, for him or Sherlock. Though soon it may not matter, either path could prove ruinous.
The sound came from behind him where John lay on the stone entry. He had not noticed in the rush of action that he had knocked his partner to the ground. He glanced back. John was splendid. He was sprawled out upon the grey stones, his blue jeans hugging his legs, his knees bent allowing his muscular thighs to be seen quite well. The white collared shirt hung open to his stomach as the buttons were wrenched off in the altercation. Sherlock was paralyzed at the sight. John's face pleaded with him. It pulled him back from the precipice, reminding him that his life was worth more. That fact sank in even more profoundly because of John's sacrifice. It was worth more because John deemed it so, because he had put Sherlock's life before all else. Because he had held him, touched him, let him know that when it came to saving his life, nothing was too great to ask. Sherlock's face softened at this momentarily before he turned back to his captive and said in a most restrained aggressive cadence.
"Well, that stands to reason," Phil said pragmatically. Sherlock sent him an irritated look, but the boy continued, "I think it's a rather nice thing to do."
His breath puffed out in white clouds between them. Though close, the space was quietly regarded as too great. John leaned his forehead in and gently met Sherlock's.
"Hmmm, strange..." John said offhandedly. He looked at Sherlock, standing stoic and still bundled in his coat and scarf, "Sherlock," he turned and grabbed the lapels of the detective's Belstaff, turning them down and loosening the scarf below, "You look like Nanook of the North..."
Another day went by with no communication. Sherlock would not answer texts nor calls to his phone. Or perhaps he couldn't answer. John did not want to overreact, however this was strange behaviour. He always answered John. As a last resort, he contacted Mycroft. As obnoxious as he was, he could still prove himself useful at times. Indeed, after a short time waiting for a return call, Mycroft let John know that Sherlock was still at the country estate of questionable history, as suspected. Searching the desk, he found the address of the manor. It was in Bledlow; not a terribly long trip. He decided that he would go to find Sherlock. Even if the situation turned out to be nothing, at least he might be able to help solve the case. John called up the nearest car rental and was soon on his way out to the country.
I never thought that anything would go wrong. I had left the flat in good condition. I had even put away all incendiary devices and sharp objects. Actually, I had hidden them to be precise. It’s not that I didn’t trust Sherlock, but this had become standard procedure since I found Rosie with a micropipette in her mouth at less than a year old.
"She got called away to London and she won't be back until Christmas Eve. It actually worked out well, I thought," John replied.
By the following evening, John was becoming slightly anxious. There was still no sign of Sherlock and he had not so much as received a text from him since the day after John had left to visit his sister. And that text was only an undisguised attempt to bait him to come out to the manor. John rang up Lestrade to see if he had heard anything or set Sherlock on another case. He had not heard from Sherlock since the week prior either. He was wondering a bit as well about the lack of communication. Normally, Sherlock would seek him out when he became too bored to be in the same room with himself and needed a distraction. John told Lestrade about the case he had taken recently. John could practically hear the DI's eyes widen, the surprise evident in his voice. He had seen the castle on a reality show a long time ago. It had depicted the location as extremely haunted and detailed it's macabre history.
The page displayed the story of a serial killer on the loose in the country. There had been multiple victims so far, found in outlying locations. Strange letters were attached to their clothing, which looked as though it had been removed, freshly laundered, and returned to the victim posthumously. The letters themselves were strange in that they were in a beautiful script and formally written. Each was addressed to the victim, but did not state any personal facts. They were written as if the murderer were writing a letter of recommendation. The weapon of choice appeared to be an axe, as parts of the bodies were clean-severed and missing. The police reported leads, but it was obvious that they had none. There were no other clues reported and nothing in common between the victims.
‘He’s doing one of his experiments,’ I thought, ‘and he’s allowing my daughter around God knows what kind of solutions. This is all a game to him. If he didn’t want to babysit, he should have damn well told me. Everything is about the work to him. His stupid, stupid work. It comes before everything, eating, sleeping, and apparently my two year old. How dare he. This is low even for him,’ I fumed, ‘She could get hurt, or sick. She could break the glass and cut herself. He’s so immersed that he’s not even looking up. What could be more important than my Rosie? Nothing. Nothing should come before her, before her safety. It’s completely unacceptable.’
"I told you, Lestrade received a call from the station in Weymouth. What they told me was all the information I have, which is most likely more than enough. THEY are out of their league, of course."
Sherlock had responded with, “She wanted it,” a slightly guilty look followed, “It’s not as if it is sharp. I took off the tip.”
I chuckled to myself as the cab pulled up outside 221B Baker Street. But the mirth would only last a moment. I opened the door to the flat and walked toward the voices I heard coming from the kitchen. It was there that I saw them. Sherlock was bent over the table beside Rosie, who stood on an obliging chair. Goggles, that appeared gigantic on her little face, were strapped around her head. The blue rubber band being adjusted for the size, caused two flaps to bounce off of the sides of her head in a way that would have been rather comedic if the situation had been different. But it was not. Beakers with various colors of liquid were spread out over the table. One was in front of the pair. Sherlock held Rosie’s hand as she used an eye dropper to squeeze something yellow into it. He counted sweetly to her and she repeated the numbers back to him. Her eyes sparkled and she smiled brilliantly.
Sherlock's lips tightened and his eyes lowered once more as he paused. John cocked his head to the side and gazed up at him, attempting to garner his attention. Through tousled curls, Sherlock returned the gaze and spoke with a voice that resounded deep in John's chest, "The curse upon this house."
John was now becoming nervous, "Sherlock, you've been here for nearly two weeks," he gently brought his hands up to reciprocate the hold his friend had on him, "A break, just a small break..." he looked into Sherlock's eyes and saw something he had never seen before. He did not know what it was, but it was wholly unfamiliar and strange. All he knew is that he wanted it gone. This case was doing something to his friend, something unhealthy. His face was drawn and unshaven, and his arms shook from within. He would have to up his game if he wanted to talk Sherlock out of his work-induced mania this time.
His dinner arrived then. The barkeep placed the warm plate on the counter where John sat, "Thank you," he said and then turned back to the quick-tempered man in the red shirt, "Well, now you know my business, so you can feel better about walking back to that chair and leaving me to it."
Stopping once again, John looked up, "Look, Sherlock, I don't know what is going on, but you're not yourself. I think we need to find out what is happening, or what happened here in the past..."
Sherlock stood up straight and looked to his friend. His hair, though uncharacteristically long, was managed and pulled back with a blue ribbon. Odd. Though he remained somewhat stooped, his face was shaven and he wore a new set of clothing. This set was obviously from the wardrobe in the secret room as the design and fine threads could only be the handy work of a time long ago. Strange. Why Sherlock was wearing yet another outfit of the former master of the house was unknown to John, but in this instance, he dare not ask. For it was, among all other present matters, a very unimportant point. Nonetheless, it was duly noted.
Sherlock released him then. Sitting back, he allowed John to rise, though he made no indication of removing himself from atop John's legs. Eyes now open, John breathed in deeply, but would not look to his friend.
This time, John remained silent at the approval and answered with his entrance. Nerves all over his body exploded and he shut his eyes to stop the world from spinning. The cry that rang out from his lover resonated in his ears and he thought the silvery sound may never leave them. It was the sound of a warm fire in the sitting room, the sound of a deliberately messy experiment in the kitchen going awry, of tea kettles and phone calls from The Yard. It was the sound that belonged to 221B, a small, unassuming flat in the middle of London where he had found home.
Down came his fingers, slashing like the sharp, penetrating claws of the forest wolves. They ripped the oil-painted face of the fair young man and pulled the frame from its mount. The whole thing came crashing down over the bedside table. Glass shattered and trinkets flew to the corners of the room. The ferocity made John take a step backward, the rain of splintered frame and debris narrowly missing him.
Sherlock looked down at the floor momentarily, "Fine. I will see you when you return then," he turned on his heel and stalked off toward his room.
"You really think that the three of you could come up with a mystery that I could not solve in the first 30 seconds of your 'dinner theatre'. Really. It's going to be a short night," he scoffed.
Sherlock, his eyes averted, stepped over to one of the blood-red roses crowned with snow. He was pensive and disquieted. His next words were brought forth low and full of loathing, "What is it..." he caressed the delicate petals, causing the snowflakes to melt and fall away. His touch was soft at first, "...that I am meant to do?" He gazed at the snickering flower. It hid secrets behind those velvety petals, which would not be given up easily. He regarded it accusingly, "Have I truly learned to love? Has the beast found love within his heart, if I may be so metaphorical? What is it that I am meant to prove to you?" His voice became a growl, his touch firming. The petals were crushed between gripping fingers, "And what happens when all of the petals fall!" With that he twisted the bloom from it's stem, his face mirroring the action. The disgust, the anger, the rage was coming back. He squeezed his hand shut, destroying the rose to keep himself from destroying anything else. His eyes tightly shut, he took a deep breath. The  fury began to subside. As he opened his hand, the petals blew away with a light gust of winter's wind. Only red streaks of blood remained striping his palm and fingers, a single thorn still lodged in the flesh. The rose had taken it's revenge for his disrespect and wrath.
"Well, it sounds like it's all sorted. We better get to work on the show. Sherlock..." Lestrade turned to the consulting detective and said with a degree of satisfaction, "Get out."
John was by his side directly, checking the hand. He carefully pulled the thorn away and covered the damaged palm with a handkerchief.
And then there was the music. John did not recognize the waltz that filled his ears. It was as grand as the ballroom in which he now stood. It beckoned him inside to hear it better, though he did not wish to disturb the dancing form before him. Sherlock waltzed, holding the air as if someone shared the dance with him. His manner was calm now and focused. His eyes closed every so often as if he danced in and out of a dream. It was a far cry from where John had left him. His clothing had changed as well. John could no longer see the white shirt as it was covered by a handsome frockcoat of navy and silver. The embroidered garlands adoring the chest, collar, and cuffs glinted in the light. It hugged his form perfectly, as if it had been specially tailored. Slim and beautiful it moved, he moved. Rhythm, perfection; the melody seemed to follow him instead of the other way around.
John swallowed hard. Where could Sherlock have gone? He must be in the house, for he knew the consulting detective was loathe to leave it. He ran out of the room and into the dimly lit hallway. He decided that he would search the main rooms of the house first. Perhaps he had gone to the kitchen or the study. Those rooms proved to be empty as well. Leaving the kitchen, he faintly heard music coming from an unknown source. He followed his ears, and they lead him to the ballroom. Cautiously and stealthily he approached the door. It was open a bit and he pushed it slowly, peering inside. The scene playing out before him would soon have him transfixed. It was strange, but humorous, and somehow magnificent; something that might grace the pages of a storybook, but did not happen in modern day.
That voice came lovely and deep, and it flowed through John's ear like music on the wind. He cleared his throat and shifted his weight, now pushing himself back against the bedpost without thought. He breathed in and closed his eyes.
A look of concern crossed Sherlock's face briefly, and then he had a thought, something he remembered from long ago.
"No, there shouldn't," Sherlock replied, "These are antique vine roses, hybridized before 1867. They are damasks, which mean they only bloom once per year in one impressive movement in the spring. These flowers are mature and radiant year round and have been for as long as records on this house have been kept. No one has discovered why. The people of the town would tell you it was from the legend of the original proprietor of the castle. When the old woman offered him a rose in exchange for shelter, he laughed and threw it out into the stormy night. The roses have grown strong ever since, or so they say."
Sherlock looked at the sandwiches and then back to John, "I don't understand. I'm not the one eating."
“John, I know I am not your first choice for a sitter,” he took a few steps forward, now meeting me in the kitchen doorway, “but I would never do anything that would put Rosie in danger.”
Sherlock's face was still that of confusion, and it made John smile even more. For a self-proclaimed genius, he could be very dim witted at times.
John stared blankly, "You know that's rubbish," he replied after a moment and leaned back in his chair, "What kind of crap telly are you watching?" He laughed.
He drove up a winding road that seemed unending after his long journey. Finally, he turned a corner and the grand manor was displayed before him. It was positively medieval. He half expected a crash of lightning to cascade down behind it for all its gothic temper. Moonlight shone upon spires that crowned the towers jutting up from the massive dwelling. The trees did not grow close to the house, in fact they seemed to shy away from it. Gardens were visible surrounding the edifice and vines had grown up the dark stone walls, perhaps to keep them company in their loneliness . A throng of red rose bushes framed the entry and spread out like soldiers circling their captive. It was impressive, but with a hint of melancholy, just like the gates he had come through. Once, it must have been the grandest home in the vicinity. Now it was barely kept up, devoid of the care and love a home needs to survive weather and time.
"There is much to discover, John. Sleep would have hindered the work," he spoke slowly, as if to a child. John hated when he did that. It was not as if he had forgotten that the work was paramount to Sherlock. The half-full tea cups lying about the flat and doors of all sorts left ajar were a testament to that.
He didn’t respond. So I waited. I waited for him to say something, anything. Maybe I was channeling my father, but I wanted to know what he had to say for himself. This was no small transgression and I could not even get a sorry out of him. I seethed.
"Selfish? Last night you told me it was the most unselfish thing you've ever seen me do..." he started.
"Gaston, leave him to his meal. Come sit back with us," she coaxed, looking at him from under thick, mascara-laden eyelashes, "We want to hear about your last hunting trip..."
John had not noticed the portrait before. It was a young man; the orphaned owner of the manor. He recognized him from another family portrait he had passed in another part of the house. Seeing the painting now, it struck him in the oddest way. The man was thin and stunning. He was dressed in a blue coat with gold braided embellishments. Long, brown hair hung to his shoulders in twists and waves and green-blue eyes seemed to stare right through him. It remarkably resembled Sherlock and that unsettled John more than anything that had happened up to this point. A sense of dread washed over him.
John laughed, which made Sherlock laugh. He liked that Sherlock was making more attempts at humor. Most of them were with him, but it was good practice for use in the general public.
Sherlock's face at first was unreadable and he walked with such command over to where John stood that he almost seemed to do it in purposeful slow motion. Though John knew that to be ridiculous, even for Sherlock's dramatics. When he reached his friend, his voice came out as slow as his gait, but as deep as the darkness surrounding the castle.
"John has..." Sherlock began, but was stopped by a corrective stare from John, "I have employed certain relations of mine to aid in the dispensing of information to the public. No doubt my face is plastered all over the tele at this very moment," the disdain was only slightly apparent.
The local DI was a stern and serious young man. He took his job too seriously in fact, most likely due to the fast promotion and subsequent stress beyond the experience of his limited amount of decades on this Earth. Still, he was concise and gave the pair all the information they required, handing a copy of the file to the consulting detective. John was grateful for this as he was really hoping to get some semblance of sleep tonight.
The lean, dark muzzled wolf at the front bared his teeth and leapt. John swung as hard as he could, the branch sailing through the air. It did not hit his mark, but the wolf fell to the floor. The woods rang with the sound of a gun fired not fifteen yards from the scene. By the time he turned to look back, a flash of black was moving toward him at a swift rate. Sherlock jumped in front of him, crouched and ready. The gun he had used was discarded and John was horrified to see him advancing on the pack. He scrambled to pick up the gun, but the ground was laden with slick leaves and branches and he could not find the instrument in time. The second wolf charged Sherlock, swiping fiercely with his claws. One found purchase on his chest as another wolf leapt onto his back. Sherlock got a handful of the wolf's fur and threw it forward over his shoulder. It hit a nearby tree with a crack and fell into the mud. The other two wolves paused, but did not back off. Their teeth bared and growls growing louder, they began to once again advance on the men. A deep noise like John had never heard sounded out frighteningly from the man in front of him, who immediately jumped up on the log beside them and crouched. Too startled to think, John raised the gun in his hand and fired at the pack. One, two, three shots, he took out the leader. It fell to the ground with a whimper. Sherlock leapt at the other two, swinging his fist with a savage right hook. It found it's target and the wolf yelped, but not before it's claws hit Sherlock's arm. Trails of red began to show through his sleeve. John ran ahead and shot again. The wolves turned as well, giving up the fight and retreating back into the forest.
Tears welled in his eyes, but he blinked them back, "It's fine," he stiffened, allowing John to continue, "I am...sorry as well. I should not have...detained you."
I then made it clear that there was to be no more experiment paraphernalia about where Rosie could reach. It was bad enough having heads in the fridge and molds on the counter. Scalpels, beakers, forceps, and chemicals was where I drew the line. Now, I am not the most cautious person by nature, but in recent months it had become blindingly apparent that the flat needed baby-proofing. I had gone about placing things out of reach of my plucky and inquisitive toddler. Some of the kitchen, particularly the cupboards, had to be rearranged, much to Sherlock’s dismay. He never said anything much, however. He knew better than that after the scientific utensils talk.
"It is a well known fact that eating before bedtime affects the way in which you sleep. The digestive systems diverts energy in order to process the sustenance being consumed and therefore produces an alternate reaction in the body," he paused, "If I was to choose the ham and cheese on rye, I might dream about a cool morning on the moor with a fresh body. Turkey, I might dream about a night chase through the streets to catch a criminal."
Sherlock did as he was told, reveling in the marvelous submission. He took John into his mouth and made a noise that caused John to pitch forward and grasp the headboard. His knuckles went white as Sherlock licked and sucked him. His hips could not be controlled. They bucked into the warm, wet mouth. It felt amazing. He thrust faster, thoroughly fucking Sherlock's savvy mouth. The man did not seem to mind in the slightest and even brought his hands to firmly grasp his arse, encouraging the act further.
Now having returned back to the flat, John thought about the scene that had taken place the week earlier. He had joked to Sherlock about the case taking a while, but he did not expect him to not have solved it a week later. He finished unpacking his bag, throwing his dirty laundry in the hamper and putting away his various personal items. He went to the kitchen to put the kettle on, still wondering why Sherlock had not returned. Perhaps he had and was just out on new case. He retrieved his phone from his pocket and texted.
John smiled back, but sighed on the inside. It was progress. However, the look of alarm on Sherlock's face had definitely not gone unnoticed. He wasn't sure what had triggered it, but it solidified the realization that a sharp eye may be best for the time being. He closed his eyes, feeling the burning sting of weariness behind them. At this particular moment, a cuppa was a welcome thought, "All right," he stood aside, "Where's the kitchen?"
"Well now, there's the pot and the kettle. Still, it beats living room target practice," John handed Sherlock another gin, "Cheers."
Sherlock nodded, shaking slightly, and allowed the rest of the material to be removed from his torso. He was most definitely not all right, not in the least. The man had just faced down a pack of wolves with his bare hands to defend his best friend and almost lost his life in the process. That best friend whom he had previously drugged and locked up in a dilapidated castle in the middle of nowhere. And all of this while investigating a three thousand year old murderous fairytale curse, which may be taking hold of him entirely. He was shaking, cold, tired, and visibly unsettled. His mind was reeling, beset by the information at hand. He sat on the edge of the seat, his hands fidgeting, the firelight playing upon his pale skin.
"Mrs. Hudson," he replied in his usual detached manner. Inwardly, he held an abundance of affection for the woman, however tedious she could be sometimes.
He had. He had known for quite some time, but he could not bring himself to allow it. His mind would not allow him to think it true. And it was his uncertainty that had nearly cost Sherlock his life. Ashamed and sorrowful, he hung his head. Sherlock had almost died here, in his arms. If he had allowed it, if he had loved him like he wanted to, if he had allowed himself to believe it was all fine. If the night they shared had been one of passion and acceptance, rather than compliance and savage appetites, perhaps it would not have come to this. Why had he not been able to get past his reservations? Why could he not admit to himself that he was in love with him? That they were in love. Why had he not seen that when Sherlock had reached for him from behind the soft ivory sheets of the bed, that it was not a favor he was asking, but permission. Approval.
John's smile meant no nonsense and the man bristled, "You need a lesson in manners..." he went to grab John's shirt, but was stopped by a pretty young lady with white blond hair and full red lips. Her matching red dress was feminine, if a bit low cut, and she curled around the man's arm as she spoke.
John arrived home on a Sunday evening. The door to the flat had been left unlocked, though he knew Sherlock never bothered with mundane details of that nature. He called out to his flatmate expecting at the very least a mumble or mid-conversational quip. According to Sherlock, there were many times John was meant to be at home, as he continuously talked to him throughout the day. The lack of response did not appear to matter, but his presence was what the consulting detective seemed to favor. John had not decided whether that made him feel more appreciated or less. This night, however, there was no response at all. John walked in and set his bag on the floor, hung his coat, and looked around. The flat was by no means tidy, but it did look as if it was undisturbed. An experiment of a sort that John did not fancy becoming acquainted with, was taking up residence on their kitchen table. Sherlock's room was empty, the bed made, clothes hung with precision in his closet. The flat was dead silent.
"It's his journal," Sherlock said. He untied the leather strings with haste and opened the book. A rose lay quietly between the pages, as scarlet and as brilliant as ever. The blooms unfurled themselves slowly as the paper gave way, as if stretching from a long nap, "And here is the rose."
Rosie began to whimper. The corners of her mouth turned down and her bottom lip slid forward slightly, set in a pout. Her eyes wide, she called after him, “Shok, paint. Paint, Shok. Shok…” She looked at me then, “Dada, paint?”
"John, get up," he walked into the flat, disposing of his coat on an obliging chair in one swift move, "It's Christmas."
"Don't touch him," he snarled, walking to the edge of the first step and holding the man over it, "Is this what you wanted to see?" He bellowed to the crowd, his eyes fierce and wild.
"After yesterday, I'm not so sure. We had a pretty good row. I think he was serious. I just don't understand why."
"John," he panted, "John, please. Now John," he begged. His long arm reached where John held his cock prisoner. He stilled the hand and tugged. John removed his fingers from every part of the detective and moved up on the bed with compliance.
John stared right back at Sherlock, "Sometimes I get carried away," his voice was dry and wavering. The cold bit at his sensibilities, but that was not the only cause of the tremble.
"You were meant to have solved the mystery of this house and leave, but here you are, and in worse condition. In the interest of the safety of this town, we have come for you," Gaston announced firmly.
"He refused an old woman over her appearance and the offering of a rose. He was a selfish arse. That much was recorded by the servants," he explained.
It was exactly 47 seconds when Sherlock's reply cut through the stillness, "And you carried me with you, I don't weigh very much."
John stopped walking, "You can't die from a lack of love. Heart break, perhaps, over time. Given the other accounts, this was something that came on suddenly. Lawrence Hawkes was certainly not heartbroken. He was just a bit of an arse."
