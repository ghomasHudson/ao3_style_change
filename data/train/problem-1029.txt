The king would never be content with his lot, it seemed, if he was to be unhappy with or without his power. All that made him happy was John.
“You are safe here, John,” Sherlock murmured to him, “be louder for me.” He began undressing his cherished servant, kissing his way down John’s chest as he went lower, listening to every euphoric, modest, entrancing sound that John made.
Sherlock shyly smiled. “If ever I doubted that I was a god,” he whispered, “I would only need to look at you, when you look at me like that, to be reassured.”
Sherlock shuddered in fear of the bitterness this comment might provoke, but instead, Mycroft was merely charmed.
Sherlock had seemed happy at the fortress, and for a while after, but slowly, his mood had sunk. He was now sullenly brushing his dark, curly hair with a mirror in his hand.
Though it was not particularly chivalrous of him, he could see well Sherlock’s slim breeches, and the servant’s pert little rump, which was usually hidden from John’s view by the servant’s long tunic. At this moment, John could see how Sherlock’s buttocks moved smoothly as one elegant leg rose after the other. His fingers itched to hold that part of Sherlock, to bring his cherished one close to his chest as he cupped Sherlock’s rear and listened to the longing whine that would escape his servant.
“Is this what lovers do together, sir?” he asked, cleaning his king with haste so as not to tease himself with self-centred thoughts of further intimacy than he had been given already.
This earned an interested eyebrow from John, who never looked at Jeeves the same way again; though in every other respect, John seemed fast becoming impatient with this back-and-forth.
Undressing himself completely, Sherlock felt a little self-conscious himself, but it was worth it to hear John whimper with helpless need.
Sherlock didn’t sound bitter about it. He sounded accepting, resigned, and that made it all the worse.
“Oh.” This wasn’t the first John had heard of a man who did not see anyone. “Is it Prince Montgomery?”
William knew that his kingdom expected him to marry. This had not been the first time that a marriageable daughter had been purposefully mentioned in his presence. He also knew that he would have to return that interest someday. His kingdom would fall into chaos if he left no heir. But he had some time to wait until then.
John tried to use this to his advantage, to use the time he had to come up with some way of wording what he wanted that could somehow make it sound acceptable. This proved to be a difficult endeavour, because it was thoroughly unacceptable. It was true that John had once gone on his knees in front of Sherlock, but that was a very different situation; that had in truth been yet another instance when his guiltless servant had catered to the king’s needs, and moreover, King John was not the blushing innocent that his servant was.
Bertie smiled warmly at his PA, and, shyly bowing his head to cover it up a bit, Jeeves smiled back.
A few minutes later, someone sat down next to him. It was not his beloved, and it was not his brother. It was his friend.
Absorbing so much information about his instrument, and playing for the enjoyment of so many people, Sherlock smiled with joy all the time, floating through the festival grounds with a lively spirit.
King John placed the bonnet aside as gently as if it were a piece of treasure. “If only you knew the night I’ve had, Sherlock.” He faced Sherlock again, looking down at the timid servant who now lied on the king’s bed. The king leaned over his servant. “I’ve been kept up with thoughts of you.”
The priest smiled, apparently glad to be the bearer of what could only be good news. “It sounds like the opportunity you have been waiting for. Perhaps, John, God has heard your prayers.”
“Why would you do that?” William released John, only to gently guide him flat onto the bed. Eyes wide, John went easily with the motion.
This compliment was more than John deserved, and as much as he loved being admired by his servant, John could not ethically accept such praise. “I’m not so kind, Sherlock. When everyone was listening to your music, I had the urge to take you way, so I could have your music all to myself. I suppose that’s what I did, by bringing you to this room.”
“Don’t be shy, Sherlock.” All it took was for John’s hand to rest on Sherlock’s ache to make his servant whimper. “That’s it, make music for me.”
He would welcome his husband home in the evening, and he would have the courage to draw the king into the bedroom. He would say all the things he wanted to say but never could as a servant. He would tell his beloved John that he would stay by the glorious man always, and give him strong children, and be an honour to his family.
It can sometimes be difficult to learn what is happening in your life, brother dear, and I simply thought I could stay apprised by hiring an informant. Doctor Watson, unfortunately, refuses payment, and I have no grounds on which to acquire information from him.
“Oh,” the handsome king moaned, rocking himself in Sherlock’s hands, which remained firmly under his master’s control. “Oh, yes. Stay just like that, Sherlock. You’re doing so well.”
He wished that he could use that gift to make a baby so that William would never leave him for someone else.
“You do not need to assist me,” William said, loudly enough to be heard over the filling water, but in a subdued tone.
When you’re prepared to stake the family name that a thing is a cert, it gives pause to see the hopes come crashing down into a pile of little pieces, like a vase against the floor, though in this case, it was less of a loud crash and more of a tense-ish silence, the kind you’d get when the vase and the floor fall short of actually hitting each other, though the vase observed the floor could be said to be stuck-up and manipulative, and the floor noted that the vase might be described as mercurial and impetuous.
With splendid determination and more hums of interest, Sherlock followed John’s movements, learning to move with his master as more and more self-control slipped away from the king.
I nodded in understanding, even if I didn’t quite believe that someone as casual and young as Bertie had a PA.
Fortitude and self-control were not among Sherlock’s strong points. He whimpered with need when John pushed a third finger into him. “I’m ready, John, take me now!”
John was moved by his servant’s innocence. “Only a harsh man would want to keep you like I do. Isn’t it harsh of me, to want to keep you?”
Sherlock gazed at him, seemingly knowing what John was thinking before the words were spoken aloud. “Inquire for better work,” he said at last, “that is all I am proposing.”
“It looks like we’re finally leaving,” King John remarked, watching the last of the merchants finish their preparations. “We will see many places by the time we reach my kingdom. I have to admit that none of it will be new to me, but I suppose you will see many new things.”
warrior, the one who protected him and who would fight for him. It was presumptuous of Sherlock to entertain this thought, but the king had indeed said that he would protect Sherlock.
Such kind praise from the king made Sherlock smile, despite the polite air he was trying to maintain. “Thank you, sir.”
Taking off his belt, King John took out an item from within a pouch. It was the jar of oil that Sherlock had become acquainted with in the caravan. Excitement pooled in Sherlock’s belly when he spotted it.
“Y-Yes, please, I want it so much…” Sherlock heard himself say these greedy words, and then at last was struck by his selfishness. “But you don’t have to, sir, you don’t… Ohh…”
At that moment, John heard a door closing on a caravan nearby; Sherlock must have heard the same noise, as he made the lightest of annoyed groans, and started to lift himself from the bed.
“Actually, I enjoyed it too.” Putting aside my amazement at Bertie’s casual display of wealth for the moment, I acknowledged that it had been nice to be able to talk to someone. “Do you come to this café often?”
The king was tempted to remind Lestrade who ought to be in charge, but he found he didn’t care if it was Lestrade who was in charge, so he did not object.
Every bee had its role to perform. That much was obvious from the single-minded, unquestioning way the bees went about their business. The insects seemed to know their place in life. One bee had one role, surely, and another bee had another. Sherlock was reminded of himself, the meagre servant whose role was to serve his master obediently. He thought also of King John, who had a very different role in life, one that could not accommodate a close attachment to the maid who cleaned his caravan.
First, King John restored Sherlock’s breeches and, for a splendid moment, held him, comforting him. Soon, however, the king was slipping his hand into his trousers, and touching himself. He continued to hold his enthralled servant as he did so.
Sherlock’s fate was to move from one servant position to the next. Employers never wanted him for very long.
“Careless,” Sherlock muttered at himself, “foolish, and careless.” He bent to retrieve the sword, and took to cleaning it once more.
As outrageous as it was, he now shared the bed in his caravan with Sherlock—his darling servant, who had no idea how selfishly the king was acting. John knew very well his own selfishness, though. Regardless of his own feelings, John would someday need to sire an heir. It had always been expected of him. He needed to ensure the stability of his kingdom. How could he provide an heir and still devote himself to Sherlock? He was certain that he could not.
“You don’t need to do anything.” The king gave him an understanding smile. “You aren’t experienced in these matters, are you, Sherlock?”
William was again kind enough to allow John to eat with him, though there was a fleeting aspect to his master’s gaze, when before William had looked where he pleased.
The strange man who had visited John and talked to him so generously in church had always been beautiful. John wished he could light up William’s bed and see his lovely Sherlock, but it was spectacular simply to feel him. John touched the other man’s chest, and moved his hands in small circles, massaging the nobleman’s sides. “Is this good?”
Sherlock smiled a little. “You flatter me. But you are over-working yourself. How long can you carry your family’s debts on your own two shoulders?”
The impact of those words crashed down brutally upon Sherlock. He had been too selfish after all. The ruse that had brought John into his castle, the fabricated need for a servant, kept John from being free with him. Just then, being in this grand dressing room, more fit for a noble family than just one individual, weighed too heavily on Sherlock’s conscience. He grasped John’s hand, and guided his servant into the main bedroom.
I may not be Sherlock Holmes, but while he is out, perhaps I could assist you in whatever matter has brought you here? Mrs…?
I doubt it. He must have been relieved to know that I would not be bothering him with letters any longer.
This was not a field in which he had expertise, though he saw that there were similarities between the works of each individual artist. However, across all the pieces, there was great variety in size and style. John didn’t personally like all the works himself, but he supposed that everybody had different tastes.
Sherlock huffed in annoyance. “Of course. I should have known. This world never could be a simple one.”
“To another body, I suppose.” Abruptly, Sherlock sat upright on the bed. “That’s it! John, you’re a genius!”
He had good reason to be grateful. By all accounts, he could only marry a woman of a royal bloodline. It was a miracle that the gods had not interfered with this secret wedding, or the evening that followed. Perhaps they knew that the relationship would only ever remain a secret.
This was not a brilliant conversation so far. Sherlock took a little of his drink, letting his eyes wander again. This time, there was a point of interest in the tavern. A woman cradling a baby was speaking in a jovial tone to a man who was clearly her husband, judging by his ease and resemblance to the baby.
I piped in, ready with sympathy. “I know what you mean, truly. I’ve got half a mind to toddle up there and take a swing at the keys myself.”
He wasn’t sure if Sherlock loved him in return, or if Sherlock, with his lack of experience in this world, knew what it meant to be in love. In any case, Sherlock wanted to stay with the king, by his side, and that was enough for John.
“I’m sorry, John,” William murmured, giving John terrible hope by offering such gentle pity. “I was afraid I’ve been asking too much of you—that you might appreciate a night alone. I see now that I was wrong.”
Sherlock still looked uncertain, so John placed his hand on his servant’s shoulder. It was a discreet and brief action, but it seemed to help Sherlock somewhat. His shoulders relaxed, and he smiled. “Really, sir?”
“I have heard whispers of some of those rituals. They say that, many ages ago, there was once a great monarch who was intoxicated by love for a beautiful woman. She was sweet and gentle, like you.” One of the king’s fingers drifted around Sherlock’s ear, making him shiver with a spike of desire. “Though she was shy, she enchanted the monarch, so much that he claimed her in a haze of passion on a ritual bed.”
Knowing at least that he had William’s love for now, John slept peacefully, warmed by the protective arms around him.
“You told me that you don’t have an heir. I don’t know exactly how yet, but I will give you a child. I will find a way.” Sherlock closed his eyes, afraid of the judgment he might see in his master’s features. “Even if it means that you must satisfy yourself with me a thousand times, sir,” he murmured, too eagerly.
“Do you intend to make me repeat myself?” The dignified, beautiful man held his arms apart, ready to be divested of his dressing gown. “You will undress me, and then clean me with the sponge.”
At that moment, the king made one final groan, finding his release, against Sherlock, amazing the servant with what a handsome image he made.
His heart pounding, John had to take a deep breath to steady himself. “Yes, Sherlock.” He sat next to Sherlock, and held him close, feeling the fabric of a gown and apron under his hands. “You don’t have to fight it. I’ll take care of you.”
“It’s all right, Sherlock. It was insensitive of me to assume that you could read.” The king turned the tome in his hands around, perhaps more aware than he had been before of his power to understand it. “I can read it to you.”
He stared for a while at one of the drawings, of a strong, dependable father and a gentle, encouraging mother, who were guiding their children through the woods.
He pondered about the mysteries he had been told, but more than anything, his mind was occupied by the inappropriate scenes that it had conjured moments previously. He thought of John, and how he might take him to bed. Of all the ways he could share his love for John, how many would his servant allow?
“I have been given coriander for a fever, so I know that it has that medicinal purpose. Indeed, the woman must have thought herself very ill if she allowed a man’s presence in her lying-in room. But it seems she is well. John, your mood is very telling. You are of a generous disposition, and you would be troubled if she was in a dire state.”
When he reached the convoy, Sherlock saw that many people were equipping their horses and entering their caravans. The servant hardly cared about them, but instead approached the first caravan. King John was indeed already there, attaching the horse to the caravan himself.
When the king did give a final grunt and spilled himself, he also reached around Sherlock, to help his servant finish. Sherlock was quite simply undone. It was a rapturous moment, as rapturous as all of it had been. The occasion was made all the more precious to Sherlock because he could not expect to be allowed such intimacy with the king very many times, not with a man who was superior to him in every way, for whom he could not perform any duty as well as the king deserved.
John’s voice was soothing, as if it carried all the healing power that the priest possessed. Being a servant of some small, local god of healing, John knew much about treating illnesses and helping people feel better. It seemed that all of John’s curative ability was now in his rough voice, his soothing hands, and his generous body, which eased Sherlock’s worries and brought him to a state of bliss.
I’ve taken to sitting in the living room with my companion. As his fingers trace over some missive from Lestrade—one he will not permit me to read, though I maintain it would be good practice as I am still learning—I cannot help but think that I can look at him for hours and he will never know.
“Oh?” Up until then, I’d sported some vague idea that Sherlock might be here to rebuke me, but now the Wooster eyes were opened. “Not a problem,” I said happily. It was always a pleasure to do a bit of good for a pal, or in this case two pals, if I may call Sherlock a pal, and I hope I may. “John’s feelings aren’t so unrequited, then?”
There was something like fear in John’s voice, and it startled Sherlock. He turned his head back to glance at John, though he didn’t move much more than that, not wishing to hinder John in his task.
Fortunately, Sherlock was still smiling. “Thank you, sir. The truth is that I would like to play music. I have thought of it many times, though I never thought I could. Though, once, I was employed by a house in which there was a violin.” The smile became sheepish. “I would… borrow the violin, and play it. I could not buy one, nor could I afford instruction. I simply watched others use it, and then played it when nobody would notice it was missing.”
Touched, John smiled. “The library was nice enough to let me buy the book, and it was easy to keep one of the candles we got from the temple. I purchased the cup from the brewery, and kept one of the apple cider jugs after we finished the drink inside. The chains, well, my friend owed me, so he was happy to let me to take them as a souvenir from the fortress. You know the rest.”
“Good, Sherlock.” Gradually, John picked up his speed, finding a rhythm that would slide him into Sherlock just right.
Indeed, Sherlock was amazed by the many different styles of art present at the festival. He gazed at lifelike statues, studied distinctive pieces of ceramics, and even asked John if they might watch one or two of the dramatic performances being put on by various poets, actors and dancers at the event. John was more than happy to agree to this, and easily acquired excellent spots for the two of them in every audience, being an esteemed king who desired to keep a dependable servant close at hand.
After sliding into him, King John groaned with pleasure, but held motionless, giving Sherlock the chance to adjust. The possessive hands rubbed soothing circles into Sherlock’s skin. “Sherlock?”
With great care, John grasped Sherlock’s ache, causing Sherlock to push instinctively into John’s hand. In no hurry, John stroked Sherlock, making that part of Sherlock heavier and hotter.
“Did I?” John grinned, pleased with himself for putting on a good performance for Sherlock. “I suppose so, though I didn’t get the chance to do much. But Sherlock, I wanted to tell you that you could explore the fortress more, if you want. You don’t have to stay here.”
“Now that I see it on you, I think that gloves of the same shade would match well. I could make you a pair.”
John also saw that there was a smaller, much less imposing bed. Its sheets and pillows were finer than most, but the arrangement did not compare to the first. There was no canopy or curtains to cover it.
Astonished by the rise in the king’s voice, by the passion in the king’s spirit, Sherlock mumbled shyly, “I’m just your maid, sir.”
John was very proud of Sherlock, and he was struck with the urge to pull the servant closer and hold him tight, though he had to consider the presence of the rest of the convoy. They could retreat into the caravan, but they had just spent a long time riding it. Some walking around seemed like a good idea to the king. Perhaps he could hold Sherlock close to him in the forest, where nobody would bother them.
He wandered throughout the library, trying to occupy his mind with other things. Again, he wished that he could read the books, so that he might have some other subject to think about. It would have been a pleasure to read more about chemistry, or some other interesting subject, such as music. Unfortunately, the language of those books was too complicated for him to decipher.
As things were starting to get out of hand between the two men of famed intelligence and personality (to put it one way), I was also becoming weary of our situation, yet I was intrigued by Sherlock’s observation. I had no idea Jeeves had been in the true rank and file. Should’ve seen it in his résumé, I imagine, but then again, I’d more or less hired him as soon as looked at him.
“That’s very nice, Sherlock.” The king gave his praises freely, enjoying how they made Sherlock flush.
“Clean us, Sherlock,” the king said, handing him a rag. It was hard to tell, but he seemed calm. Certainly, this had not been as remarkable an occurrence for him as it had been for his inexperienced maid.
“Then I will not.” Sherlock’s arm indeed remained coated, as it suddenly raised itself and brought John into a warm, secure, familiar-feeling head-to-neck hug.
I have a client coming round this evening. I suppose there would not be any harm in letting you observe the proceedings. You will see that I am self-sufficient, and can relay as much with great sincerity to my brother.
John is a proper friend, there’s no denying that, and I always look forward to seeing him in the café. I’m a great admirer of his blog—I’ve always been a fan of a good mystery, and his pal Sherlock ploughs through them in droves—but it wasn’t just that, you know. John had long been a sympathetic ear while I’d pined, knowingly and unknowingly, for Jeeves, and always he was a treasure when it came to giving me advice for my own blog.
“This is nice,” John said, contented by the simple act of walking with William and admiring the calm scenery with him.
That was fine with the attendant. William had been very kind to John, so it was all right to be ignored today. To let his king enjoy leisure time alone, John turned to leave the room.
But still, Sherlock’s body took an age to relax, and the servant’s mind worked. The king had mentioned that he hadn’t had a child with his wife—was that it? Would a partner be worthy if they provided the king with a child?
“What? No, not at all, sir,” John said sincerely. He presented the large-handled knife innocuously. “Why do you own a knife such as this?”
There was the sword that John had used in the warrior’s tournament, the flint and steel that Sherlock had used to light fires, a book about chemistry that seemed to be instantly familiar to Sherlock by its cover, a candle that had been made from beeswax, a pointed copper cup used to heat ale, an empty jug with a label for apple cider, a set of chains that brought another flush to Sherlock’s cheeks, the violin of course, and finally, a trowel meant for use in a garden.
“Oh, it means the study of how certain materials differ from other materials, and how they interact with each other. Like how you mix different things together when you cook, for example, and why things change when you heat them.”
John was certain that King William had not depended on the aid of a personal servant in some time, judging from the disorderly look of fine shirts and trousers thrown carelessly into the bureau. In the bottom drawer, though, John discovered something interesting.
“I have you.” John placed a pillow under his servant’s rear, and began preparing Sherlock with the oil, as careful as ever with his beloved servant.
“I didn’t mean to eavesdrop on them, sir. But there weren’t any other sounds and… they were loud, and I…”
Sometimes, sitting on his throne in the great hall, giving an audience to whoever it was, John imagined a similar throne next to his, where his consort could sit and rule over the kingdom with him. There had once been a second throne there; it had belonged to the queen, from whom he had long ago separated in all but name. It pained John that the person he had fallen in love with could not be at his side like that. He was comforted by the knowledge that Sherlock was somewhere in the castle, ready to serve the king as soon as he was called upon.
“Are you sure? You seem to admire the books a great deal. Surely you’d like to actually read some of them?”
“Let yourself enjoy it, Sherlock.” The king’s hands drifted away from Sherlock’s rear, to stroke over his thighs and rest soothingly on his servant’s smooth legs, which were secure over John’s shoulders.
John wandered through the castle, assisting with the cleaning of the royal chambers and making sure his clothes had arrived, but he returned to the chapel later that day. He talked to some other servants who were there, happy to demonstrate that he had finally learned the names of some of the regulars of the castle. Yet for the most part he simply enjoyed sitting and feeling the warmth of solace and nostalgia this chapel gave him. A kind man, one with unusual interests and habits, had sat with him in a church much like this one. A man who would openly mock polite aristocrats and take a whiff of a peasant’s shoes.
The sponge moved to the ruler’s shoulder, and gradually, down his left arm. “Why did you call yourself Sherlock, then?” John asked. Now that John knew the truth, it wasn’t hard to see that William Holloway had disguised his name as Sherlock Holmes, but he did not know why the king had done so.
“I shouldn’t touch you, Sherlock. Every time I have done it, I’ve known that. It’s wrong, for plenty of reasons. I can’t show affection for a servant. I will someday need to sire an heir. Believe me, I never meant to be selfish. I truly did want to give you an opportunity to find a new life, and it was fantastic to see someone so fascinated with the world. But I thought too highly of myself. I thought I could keep myself from doing anything wrong. I thought I could resist whatever magic it is that you’ve got.”
The incredible design and craftsmanship of the vehicle left Sherlock in awe. “It is magnificent, sir.”
“No, I’ll be fine.” King John stood up. His eyes drifted to the stars that were beginning to emerge in the sky. “The stars are pretty, aren’t they?”
John had anticipated a nice enough welcome by his people upon his return, though he had evidently underestimated the excitement that would fill the city. As the caravan rolled down city roads, he could hear people cheering for King John and his victory in the tournament that had been held in Sherlock’s town.
“I remembered all the details that told me where he lived, and I found him years later,” William said softly, “praying in a church.”
“I have known much about you for a long time. You regularly smell of medicine, despite not being ill, and as you cannot be much older than myself, you must be the son of an apothecary. In recent weeks you have taken to coming earlier than you had before to your personal services, and you leave at a more precise time, indicating that you have taken a second, night-time job. Judging from the newly formed callouses on those otherwise well-kept surgeon’s hands of yours, it is manual, repetitive labour. No number of candles would allow for tilling fields at night, so you are working for a craftsman or transporting goods.”
Slowly, William nodded. He even allowed John to clean him with the sponge again, and when John’s touch strayed near to the thighs, the nobleman told him he could continue as far as he was willing. This morning must have held some meaning for William if he was still so affected despite last evening. When John started to clean William’s intimate parts, his master shut his eyes tightly.
Footsteps drew near, and a deep voice distracted John completely. “Is God treating you well, John?” A tall man with dark, curly hair and a wool blue scarf sat next to him on the pew. “He owes you that much.”
“Yes?” The priest was interested, unbothered by the king’s monotone. Only Lestrade could question William so thoroughly and not worry about his place in the castle.
“My God, Sherlock,” John whispered. He knew it wasn’t decent to accept such an offer from his beloved servant. But how could he possibly resist? “Do as you like, Sherlock, you can do anything.”
“The castle will provide what you need. Seek out Lestrade, and tell him that it is by my command that you be given new clothes. For whatever reason, he seems to have an eye for selecting clothes, and will help you make an order. Take what time you need. I will be speaking with the treasurers today.”
It was a short walk to the inn, and they did not need to ask for directions, as John knew the way well. When they were inside the inn and back in their room, John encouraged Sherlock to take a seat on the bed. John also sat there.
That’s right. Do you want to report me? I wish you the best of luck, then! It’s the word of a detective inspector against that of a servant.
Happy to be allowed to accompany King William outside the castle, John followed. William led him down the castle stairs and, and together they walked about the courtyard. Some people went out of their way to show deference to their ruler, but William ignored the nobles and merchants for the most part.
Montgomery smirked, and began to search through a chest of drawers, which seemed to have fabric supplies.
“I think he will be.” Really, their case was nothing very different from what King William had admitted in confession in times past. “In any case,” William added with a touch of amusement, “the cross might make a fair inducement.”
“Welcome, John,” Father Lestrade said. “I’m glad I saw you. Your clothes just arrived. I had them sent to King William’s quarters.”
The king led their way into the library, with his dutiful servant obediently following and regarding the shelves of books with veneration as they went. When they reached the lower levels of the structure, King John stopped to ask Sherlock a question. “Is there any book in particular you’d like to read, Sherlock? I can help you find it.”
Sherlock swallowed, nervously. “I’m sorry I wasn’t fit to, well, do everything for you, at the end.”
“As I recall, you were fascinated by the different kinds of dirt around the city. We talked about dirt.”
“I’ve done my research,” Sherlock persisted, with a lowered voice, “and I know exactly who you are. You’ve made quite the cover for yourself, staying quietly in the service of a harmless socialite, but you’re one of the best-connected men in London. You know every butler, maid, and chauffeur who works for anyone of importance, or am I wrong? It all became clear to me when I found out about the Junior Ganymede. Yes, I know all about it.”
Knowing you, this probably relates to a case somehow—not to mention, a gentleman really ought to know, right? You’ll need to learn the box step, first. The best way to teach you is to show it to you… er, well…
The king’s hands came to rest on Sherlock’s hips, keeping him in place. John loved to see and feel his servant writhing in pleasure under him. If John’s mouth had not been busy providing Sherlock with that feeling, the king would have told Sherlock how beautiful he was, and admired how the praise brightened Sherlock’s face.
They are interesting, from a medical point of view. Your eyes appear… normal, for lack of a better word.
John was not meant to rely on another, to need someone so badly. With William, at least, he could tell himself that he was only serving his master, and he could keep some part of his heart from giving in to false hopes. Now, John was faced with a terrible reality, that he needed Sherlock desperately. “I don’t think you’re wrong.”
Sherlock was wondering if the king truly was remembering a story, or perhaps using this tale to say what could not be confessed with ordinary words, but Sherlock could not concentrate long on the question, not when King John was disrobing him with such sureness and impunity.
“Uh, yes? I don’t think we’ve met. I w-would’ve remembered meeting you!” John stammered nervously to the former king.
Just like that, Sherlock was off, with as much enthusiasm as I imagined he had for the most interesting cases.
A lady may have a servant or companion with her. Such an individual would be able to quietly inform said lady of any visual information required to maintain the ruse.
His king had become quiet suddenly, but that was not peculiar. The hour was late, and no doubt King John was becoming very tired. His fatigue must have been compounded by the chore of soothing his meek servant’s pathetic fears with talk.
“No more than you!” Somewhere between the hall and these chairs, Lestrade must have forgotten that William was the priest’s sovereign. “Do you even know of the work Prince Montgomery still does for this land? Sorting through the trade records, accounting for the army’s expenses, all that rot. He plants himself behind his desk and does all the little things that are too boring for you to do.”
That devastated John like a splash of cold water. “Oh, Sherlock. No, that’s not why I want you. You don’t need to give me a baby.”
“No, I’d very much like to do that. I’ve, um,” John murmured, “done it to myself, in the past, sir.”
Moving to the other side of his servant, John again bound Sherlock’s gentle, pale hand to a bedpost. It struck John that Sherlock’s arms were already so slender and delicate, compared to those of the king, that it was almost superfluous to bind them.
“Of course. I should have known that. My master is a strong warrior.” Sherlock sounded pleased, and John was pleased as well to hear Sherlock say so.
In any case, William comprehended the implication of Lestrade had said, though the king could not fathom why Lestrade had wasted his time in Montgomery’s presence. “You were in
William donned his tall boots. “You must have mentioned it. Now come, John, I have need for some fresh air.”
“Um, no.” John was caught between his bittersweet amusement at Sherlock’s request and the dizzying fact that he had just been deemed William’s cherished servant.
John was happy if he seemed like a chivalrous knight to his servant—even if he wouldn’t have described himself precisely that way. He dropped the trowel into his pocket. “That’s good of you to say.”
Sherlock sat in his meeting room, now empty save for himself and several vacant chairs. He had just had a meeting with idiotic advisers. It was a far more tedious process than it should have been to announce one’s upcoming wedding to the public.
“My dear Watson,” Sherlock said in a soft, patient manner, “How can your husband serve you this evening?”
Once everything was in order with the convoy, John led Sherlock out into the city, which was teeming with activity, as there was a great festival going on. The vibrant sounds and noises were a welcome distraction for the king, and seemed to put Sherlock in a much better mood, as John had hoped. There were many people, more than there had been at the tournament. John fancied that his servant, who eyed the crowds in awe, had never before seen so many people in one place.
Overwhelmed, John cried out his joy. He helplessly thrust up and spent himself, spilling all that he had over William’s briefs. It was heaven, and it buoyed his spirit to feel his master’s legs entwine more closely with his own, though a part of him was coherent enough to fear the consequences of being so wanton under his lord’s attention.
John closed his mouth completely over the other man’s need, and William cried out powerfully, his deep voice alive with passion. “John! My John!” He could feel his master’s body tremble, and guided William’s hips so that he could please his lord in a soothing rhythm.
For now, he wanted to appreciate the time they had left in the caravan, sitting side by side and watching the world pass by.
“I wish I was not! John, do you know what I came across today, what miraculous thing was given to me?”
“Absolutely. In fact, I wanted to talk to you about something. Hah, you really do distract me!” John chuckled, and Sherlock smirked a little. “I forgot to tell you that I spoke with my advisors today. They think it’s possible for me to will the throne to an heir of my choosing, and it seems likely that the public will support a tournament.”
With a sigh, Sherlock picked up the bow that King John kept in the caravan. It was a long and elegant piece of wood, though it looked odd when it was unstrung, as it generally was when not in use. Without the tension of the string to bend the material, the object looked more like a wooden staff than a bow.
“Yes, right.” John stood up, cross in hand and message in heart. “Do you think Father Lestrade will be understanding?”
“I’ll start doing so if it means I can help a friend, and I’ll have someone to talk to about the paragon that is Jeeves,” Bertie answered happily. “Speaking of whom, I must be off, as I don’t want to keep him waiting. I’ll see you around, then!”
If he has stopped writing to you, it is not out of lack of interest. It would be because he believes
William coldly turned around and returned to his magnificent bed, falling lazily on his back. “Run a bath for me.”
John breathed in sharply. It was impossible not to notice how the servant’s body responded to the request. John flipped over, lying on his stomach, his wrists crossing behind his back. His head was resting on the bed, turned to the side. “Like this?”
“My John, my dearest.” When William was being so generous, John could barely concentrate on what his master said; all the same, his gentle voice captivated him. “You saved me. You’ve saved me many times, John.”
Once John was wearing only his briefs, Sherlock guided him to his large bed. It was distracting to see that John’s underwear had a noticeable bulge, though John was effecting to ignore it. “My dear John, please lie down for me.”
“Yes! I was afraid of talking to him about it, you know, he’s a good priest and I thought he might look down on us, but he was so understanding. He didn’t even seem surprised, really. Is… Is that all right, sir?” John’s arms began to retreat from around Sherlock.
Sternness abruptly set into Sherlock’s face, and his chin slightly rose. “Do not call me Sherlock. That is not who I am here. You will address me as King William.”
The king led the way to the front of the convoy, to the caravan that sat in front of the others, shining in all its regal glory. The wood was brightly painted in red and gold. It was a beautiful exterior, but that was all Sherlock could tell. The caravan’s door, located where the driver would sit, was closed, and only curtains could be seen through the door’s small window. This was also the case with the larger window on the side of the caravan.
It was soothing, his lord’s closeness. John saw too late that he was dirtying William’s clothes with snot and tears. “I’m sorry…”
Eyeing the tool with curiosity, Sherlock said, “I don’t know. There’s hardly a need for a gardening tool here. Interesting.”
John stepped gingerly to the curtains and peeked outside. Unsurprisingly, His Highness had a beautiful view from his room. John could see the top of the castle walls and the rolling hills beyond. He could also see that the sun was fairly high in the sky, and that the rest of the people in the area were awake, going about their business.
He missed John. The look on that strong face when he stepped out onto another planet would have made everything worthwhile.
he said, waving a hand and turning away from both of them. Out of the corner of his eye he saw Sherlock go suddenly still. The clown's parting speech fell on dead ears as John watched his friend, frozen and suddenly looking terrified, almost betrayed. He caught the final 'farewell' of Kemp's line as he turned to Sherlock, feeling inexplicably guilty at the look on his face.
I turn around so that I'm facing him, his hand still rubbing circles into my arm. I sniff and wipe my eyes pathetically – mostly because John has a soft spot for the helpless, so the more innocent I look the more he'll try to comfort me. "I just… It's –"
"Boring," he pronounced, finishing his toast with a flourish. Julien smiled again and handed over the paper, turning his full attention to the intricate process of politely eating egg and toast. Sherlock rolled his eyes.
The boy smiled gratefully at him, almost ruining the effect by tripping over his hem before the stagehand could come to give him a hand. John turned around, chuckling to himself, and almost walked into a sharply familiar figure in a long black coat.
he murmured, the noise echoing slightly within the confines of his Silencing Charm. But it was John's voice and suddenly Sherlock was so hard it felt as though the seams of his pyjama bottoms would split, made as they were for Sherlock's slim hips. He lifted his hips, feeling the strain in his newly-muscled thighs, and worked the pants off until
The silence held for a few moments as those blue eyes swept over the room. Then the teacher nodded shortly. "Good morning, class."
he hisses, grabbing John's wrist again and gripping it so tightly it feels like an ice-cold pair of handcuffs holding him still. He daren't even breathe.
the playwright if they would play together. "Oh, well," he said. "Perhaps next time. I'd love to watch the two of you rehearse, though, we could still meet up with the three of us."
The woman handed him back his passport and gestured to the final gate. "Yep. I'm the luckiest guy in the world. But don't worry, John, you'll find someone. Plenty of time, and all that."
His flatmate hummed in disappointment. "You said before I left this morning that you might need my help again?"
They're in the study, a largish square room with a desk in the middle, facing the window, but John's eyes are drawn to the huge safe that squats behind it like a child about to pounce. In there, he thinks to himself, are the deepest and dirtiest secrets of Kate Middleton's love life.
Sherlock glanced again at the headboard; there was indeed no trace of the deep purple tape that had been on Montgomery's bed. "That doesn't necessarily mean anything," he said. "Good-quality bondage tape isn't supposed to stick to anything except itself, he could easily have used better stuff than Montgomery. Or used a scarf or tie or rope instead of tape. And not everyone who's into BDSM plays with bondage anyway."
They both look up at the consulting detective, arms folded in a childish gesture of frustration, standing in the middle of the room surrounded by new carnage and pouting. John tries not to laugh, but Sherlock doesn't miss the expression. "Come on, John, we're leaving."
One corner of John's thin lips turned up amusedly. "Tease," he declared wryly. Sherlock shot him a stunning smile that apparently turned flirtatious on him again, because the doctor's own smile betrayed a flash of the idle, sultry heat Sherlock had received the previous night. It was lucky he was still holding onto the back of his chair, because his knees threatened to buckle.
The man recovered remarkably well, drawing in a deep breath and pulling himself yet more upright. "As I told you, Sherlock, this matter is of
With a grunt of disgust, Molly spun on his heel and flapped an arm as if to dismiss the very idea of Orsino. John tried not to be offended.
them in place, hip pressed to groin, feeling the throbbing of each other's heartbeats where they touched.
His hands slipped down Sherlock's belly, toyed with the button on his trousers. For a crazy moment Sherlock thought he would undo it, undo the trousers and touch Sherlock's bare penis, but then the moment passed and John's hand moved down to the head of his cock as it rubbed gently against the now-damp fabric of his pants. "
The detective didn't ask what he was talking about. "I knew you were about to, and I thought it would look better if we both did it. New in amity, and all that." John snorted. "That went surprisingly well," he remarked.
John stopped. "Sorry," he said, allowing the bewilderment to show in his voice as though hinting that his friend's response had been rudely abrupt.
" he called, stepping close enough to stroke a finger down his bare arm. Ben seemed to hesitate, clearly looking at the door through which Titania had just left, before he skipped over to John's side. John placed his hand indulgently back on his shoulder, smiling slightly as the boy leaned into the touch. He held him carefully away for the poetic direction of his next monologue.
Slowly, he loosened his hold on John and attempted to stand on his own feet, swaying slightly. John smiled at him. "This doctor is recommending bedrest," he said firmly, and then frowned. "Can you get rest inside your own head?"
He fell silent as they caught up with the butler, who stood in what John presumed was the study door, watching them with shrewd eyes. Sherlock returned his gaze almost sullenly, clearly communicating that whatever was being discussed was not going to be discussed within his earshot. John smiled slightly. "My Lord's office is through this door," the man said without acknowledging Sherlock's silent reprimand, opening the heavy door to reveal a fastidiously neat study, dimly lit despite the large window backlighting the huge desk.
Luck was not on his side: Angelo, stood behind the high bar polishing mugs, caught his eye the moment he descended the staircase. "Oho!" the big man called, not perturbed by the way John immediately looked away and kept walking. "I
was critical of the plan too, mainly because it wasn't really a plan at all. Somewhere between now and that first murder he had become completely sidetracked by John, and really they hadn't made any progress at all on the actual
John clapped him on the shoulder. "I don't think so - I can't imagine Sherlock enjoying himself in the
"Nicely handled, Master Watson," the detective said dryly, smirking at John as they left the building.
John lifted an eyebrow at him as he stood, already putting his book aside in preparation for getting up and leaving. "Already?" he asked eagerly.
or another one of those myriad insanely unrealistic crime-shows. He insists it's luck. John reckons he actually checks to see when they're on, because as much as he claims not to enjoy them, he certainly gets right behind the characters.
I can put up with it when other people treat me like a trick pony at a circus, because they do it all the time. But John's never done it before, and it smarted a little bit.
"Remember how you got in," Sherlock told him. "I know T'Penya helped you, but I'm guessing she told you to think of your mind as separate from your brain - to think of your mind travelling into mine through your fingers?" John nodded. "Well, now you have to remember that your body is still where you left it, and imagine the version of you that is here reaching out to it, so that it can travel back through your fingers into your head. I'd imagine T'Penya will still be in contact, she'll feel you reaching out and help you if you need it."
What is it with women and this sixth sense they think they have? She kept going on about how he cut his finger a week ago and she'd known something was wrong and run up to the – Sherlock?"
reference and reluctantly turned back to the admittedly striking colour-coded calendar McAuliffe was drawing on the whiteboard. Then he turned back.
The detective grinned anyway. "It's always fun on stage. How far can you push it before it stops being subtext and becomes explicit?" John shrugged in grudging agreement. He enjoyed that himself, although he had discovered that it took a certain kind of co-star to pull it off. "
John couldn't hold back his smile. "It's fantastic," he said, and pressed their lips together once more. Stamford's quiet, mocking applause was undercut by the sound of Kemp's ringing delivery of
you, here. Give me the letter yourself and I can withhold certain bits of information as to how I recovered it. If you don't, I'll have to let the story out."
And yet, Sherlock defined an unhealthily large portion of Julien's life. He had never found anyone quite like Sherlock, no matter how far he had looked; he had given up now, after the resounding proof that the Englishman did not return the sentiment, settled for manipulating look-alikes like Leslie into his house and his bed. At secondary school and university he had become essential somehow; it had felt nice to know that Sherlock would come to him to report the ups and downs of his sexual escapades, to know that even as the tally in his worn lab-book – itself a gift from Julien – approached 150, there was only one whom Sherlock had taken into his confidence, treated as a friend as well as a convenient lover.
out of school like this. I can put your mind at rest, though – if you're looking for the small boy in the purple shirt, he's seducing an acquaintance of mine, not looking for trophies from a murder scene or whatever you thought he might be doing here. And said acquaintance doesn't have the brains to be a murder accomplice."
They released each other, stepping apart, the air between them gaping awkwardly. Sherlock wanted to step forwards and kiss the doctor, but he wasn't quite sure how to.
Sherlock, however, cracked a smile that failed to hide all the triumph and smugness buried beneath his alabaster face. "Reverend Slessinger," he greeted with just a hint of sarcasm.
Julien raised his hands in surrender. "As you wish." He reached for the decanter of Cognac on the edge of his desk, tilting it towards Doctor Watson and receiving a predicted taut shake of the head before pouring himself two fingers and swirling them around the crystal tumbler. "What is, then, your business with me,
John got the feeling that there was another option that Sherlock wanted to offer him, but the inn where he was staying was further out of John's way than John's flat was out of Sherlock's, and Will hadn't released any new part of his play that they might meet and rehearse. John hadn't missed the fact that the detective had somewhat stubbornly persisted in calling it
They finished the rest of the packet of Cauldrons and another cup of tea each before Sherlock finally got up and held his wand at the ready. John smiled fondly at the expression of desperate concentration on his face. The thought briefly crossed John's mind that he'd like to hold him close and kiss him until he calmed down before he pushed it violently away. From the throwaway comments Sherlock had given him throughout their association it sounded as though he was the first friend the younger student had tried to make in a very long time. He couldn't ruin that friendship, especially not so soon after Sherlock had admitted it existed. He watched instead as Sherlock brandished his wand and cried,
when that police officer came in." John laughs, picturing how he must have looked, frozen while facing certain doom. He hopes the officer didn't get enough of a look at him to build any kind of profile. Sherlock casts an arm lazily over John's shoulders, and he suddenly stops worrying about it. "Come on, then, Doctor Watson," the detective drawls, his voice still breathy. "Let's get back to Baker Street."
Sherlock's eyes fell on John in the chair opposite her, head bowed, clearly still asleep. He smiled fondly. "I'll get John," he ventured.
The taller boy rolled his eyes. "From the way you've described him he sounds like Jim. He probably makes more enemies than friends with his
John grabbed his chin, forcefully redirecting his head so that they looked each other squarely in the eyes. "Wipe that smirk off your face," he said sharply.
The taller boy blinked and hurriedly wiped his mouth with the back of his hand; finding it dry, he glared at John, who chuckled. "Well you may laugh, John," he said stiffly, "but one day you'll find someone who captivates you as much as Hannah consumes
John Watson splayed his hands on the desk and leaned forwards menacingly. "I want to purchase an item from your collection."
There was silence while Sherlock tried and failed to find something to defend himself with. The kettle reached the boil noisily and clicked itself off.
do it all his life and still not grow used to it. Sherlock's lips were soft and smooth and warm as they moved against his, his nose pressing into John's cheekbone and blowing warm breaths against his face, and his curls brushing gently against John's forehead.
He leaned in slightly, and John copied him as though the movement was subconscious, involuntary. A smile wormed its way onto Sherlock's mouth; John's eyes followed the movement helplessly as he leaned in further, his own lips parted, expectant. Sherlock could feel the power, the electricity, the intoxicating knowledge that he
Sherlock bowed his head ashamedly, hoping that John would leave it at that, but apparently he had exhausted his supply of luck for the afternoon, because John smelt the remnants of the potion once more and his frown intensified. "Hang on," he said slowly. "Peanut butter – doesn't the Polyjuice potion smell like something that reminds the drinker of the person they're – whose hair did you have access to who eats peanut butter every morning, except for…"
Marchbanks took the towel from him and shook it out, sending more dust spinning through the air, before lightly swiping it over the windowpane and the desk of controls. The Doctor thanked him graciously.
He turned to his laptop and brought up the barman's witness statement and the one from the woman who had seen him leave for reference, unplugging the computer so that he could take it with him when they adjourned to Sherlock's bedroom.
"Lord Trelawney-Hope." He takes the proffered hand reluctantly, shaking it with his own wrist limp. "I trust you slept more soundly last night?"
The detective turned his reassuring smile on her; John raised an eyebrow. Perhaps Sherlock had only directed it at him to practise it. "Miss Devine, my name is Sherlock Holmes, and this is my colleague John Watson. We're here investigating the disappearance of Lady Frances Carfax."
. Sherlock almost asked her what she meant, but the Doctor looked understanding, so he thought about it instead.
To the man in front of him he offered a flirtatious arched eyebrow. "I am fearful that this conversation will have to wait," he said, his voice pitched low. "If you are willing to remain here, we can continue it when I am finished with this urgent matter."
The FO sighed. "It doesn't matter," he lied. It was almost amusing how he always seemed to think he was convincing when he did that.
John can see enough to know that the woman has taken off her hat and glasses, but not enough to see her face. He strains a little bit to see, but it doesn't work; as he leans back in, he bumps against Sherlock hard enough that the detective involuntarily presses a sloppy, open-mouthed kiss to John's neck. The yelp of shock and arousal catches itself only an inch before escaping his lips; it'd be unfortunate if, at this stage in the game, he gave it all away like
The consulting detective flashes a positively disarming grin at his flatmate, then lets out an 'ah!' of triumph as the lock clicks and the door swings open. There is, Sherlock mentions languidly as they creep through the corridor, a door that leads right
"How is it this morning, Captain Sherlock?" Margaret, the maid, placed a plate of toast and a cup of Earl Grey in front of him. He gave her a sickly smile in return. She'd always called him Captain; when he was a child he'd been adamant that, law or not, he was one day going to be a pirate. He couldn't convince her now that he wasn't a child anymore.
help. Since John's blog became popular, too, people – teenaged girls, mostly – have expressed their admiration in the street, often drawing attention to us when we'd rather remain unobserved. I'm special to them, in some strange perverted way. I'm something special to Lestrade, to Angelo, probably even to Mycroft. But I don't think I've
Before anyone could say anything more, Sherlock charged. John, poised on the point of readiness, was barely half a step behind him as he barrelled straight into the door and knocked the smaller man backwards. A woman screamed; distantly, he was aware of Lestrade apologising to Peters for the both of them, but he doubted the man was listening. Sherlock swiped him aside with one throw of his arm and made for the kitchen table, an unusually large coffin taking up its entire space and intruding over a once-velveted armchair.
). However, summaries of these plays can be found pretty much anywhere on the internet. Anywhere that I actually quote the plays, I'm taking the text from The Norton Shakespeare.
Sherlock reached across the small table to pat the woman comfortingly on the back of the hand. "Thank you, Miss Devine," he said softly. "I only have two more questions - would you say that Lady Frances acted any differently before she left? You mentioned that it was unusual for her to go alone."
John grinned; of the very few run-ins he'd had with the Constabulary before he'd met Sherlock, they had almost always arrived too late to make any real difference. "True," he concluded. "How can we pass the time?"
"Excuse me," he said brightly to the balding man behind the counter, a false smile stretched across his face. "I'm here on behalf of Her Majesty's Government. I believe some of the jewellery you were sold this morning is stolen property."
They repeated last night's ritual of donning their coats by the door and then doubling back to Sherlock's bedroom, John slamming him against the inside wall so hard Sherlock's ears rang and taking his mouth again, one hand sliding up his thigh as though lifting the hem of a dress. Sherlock leaned his head against the wall and panted as John's mouth slid wetly down his jaw and fixed on his still-sensitive neck while his hand travelled still further upwards until it rested over his pectoral muscle the way one might cup a woman's breast.
"No, this isn't the Russians' style. Too clumsy. This was a crime of passion; the murder weapon came from this room. They didn't plan on killing him when they turned up. Have you interviewed the neighbours, at least?"
"Like hell he did," John responded. "He's half the size of you. Of course he's going to pick a fight. Leave him alone."
Will Kemp made an obscene gesture and Shakespeare nodded sharply. "Yes, like that, Master Kemp, thank you," he dismissed. He looked around the company, inviting questions. "Is that ok with everyone?" he checked. There was a collective murmur of agreement and nods. "Good. From the top of scene five, and I'll try not to interrupt again."
"He succeeded, that time," I correct, remembering it automatically. His lips had been softer than I would have expected for someone who doesn't take care of them. "I wasn't expecting it and he just kissed me. So I told him I wasn't interested and we came back here and he… he wouldn't listen to me. He just kept telling me that he could tell I wanted him to, and he backed me into a corner."
Something moved in his peripheral vision; reflexively, Sherlock stepped away from it. He looked guiltily around to see if anyone had noticed the movement when he realised that he had jumped at the shadow of the nearest tree. The Doctor gave him a sideways glance, but didn't comment. Sherlock tried to force himself to relax; there was something about this artificial forest and its artificial light that set his teeth on edge.
Sherlock chuckled – a sound that went right down John's spine, low and sultry and warm. "I don't know," he said, shifting so that he was leaning against the panel of hooks behind him. "For a restricted crime-scene, this place seems to be quite the thoroughfare."
Sherlock opened his mouth to reply, but closed it again with a snap and looked over at the group congregating around Will once more. They had apparently not taken John's polite refusal as an answer, and had instead began a low chant of
A sort of wheezing laugh echoed from the Doctor's mouth. "That's really cool," he said brightly. "You really are brilliant. Yeah, that's kind of what's happening. Except you are… well, you're not really supposed to be here."
, the Doctor had called it. It was a lot more cluttered than he had expected, with protrusions and shapes extending strangely for no apparent purpose. Perhaps he didn't know enough about the way it would work. The Doctor leaned against a console, almost missing and stumbling slightly. "It's bigger on the inside," he said, as though people were routinely surprised by this. Sherlock supposed they must be.
Lestrade looks from one to the other, a slightly amused look crawling over his face. "Yes," he says slowly. "Yes, it could be."
Sherlock frowned. "They used a scarf," he replied, lifting his head to glance at the coats and jackets on the floor, "but mine's in the living room – the tape's in the top drawer of the table."
, and when his friend dipped his head to moan and bite at John's neck he was doing it because he was enjoying John's touch, because John was giving him pleasure. The young actor's soft curls tickled at John's chin and his cock was velvety and so
She smiled as she returned the polite greeting, but John was close enough to see that it trembled. "Your reputation precedes you, Master Holmes," she said airily. "I have every confidence you can find the men who did this."
Lestrade smiled sadly. "She wasn't there," he explained. Billy looked up at Sherlock, who avoided his gaze in something that was almost shame. "We'll send someone else later this afternoon, but it's unlikely he's keeping her elsewhere. I've no doubt he was involved with the kidnappings at some stage, but we can't prove it if he's not currently in possession of either of them."
John's face would colour and he would make to leave, stammering some excuse about being caught by surprise and not thinking that Sherlock did this kind of thing. Sherlock would have to cut him off to stop him from leaving. "No – I don't mean
think about that," she admitted. "I couldn't. I didn't mean to kill Montgomery, and then after that it was already done. Do people usually think about that? Getting caught by
Sherlock pointedly avoids looking at him or getting too close to him as they unload their bags from the train; he resumes his staring out the window in the cab and leaves John to attempt to persuade the extraordinarily garrulous cabbie that this isn't really the time to complain about everything from David Cameron to West Ham Football Club to the weather and try to make inane conversation.
The Randall gang had been in the periodicals; John remembered reading about their string of violent robberies. He looked at Sherlock for his reaction to the woman's shockingly rude behaviour to her superior, but the detective's expression hadn't changed. "Then perhaps there is evidence in the scene that may assist us in capturing them," he suggested calmly. "I was asked to come all the way here, Miss Donovan, do not think I am leaving without at least looking at the room. And I would like to speak to Lady Brackenstall."
He allowed his fingers to probe gently at the completely dry, fake-looking bone. "What could do this to a person in three weeks?"
Sherlock removed the crime-scene photographs. "Had he been in recently?" he asked, watching Eliza closely.
Mycroft Holmes cleared his throat. "Who is Lady Brackenstall?" he asked silkily, as though the two of them were trying his patience.
growing up, even more so, if he didn't have that knowledge. "So we shouldn't tell Lestrade either?" he asked, suddenly feeling rather exposed. He'd quite liked the Constable. Was it wrong to trust
It was almost disappointing when the detective made it through the performance without having to improvise any lines: John had been quite looking forward to hearing what he came up with, despite the tiny worry that he would take 'criticising the mechanicals' to new levels of offensive, which seemed to be a talent of his.
Sherlock snorted. "Clearly you overestimate the nobility of the Metropolitan Police," he said scathingly. John made a face. Sherlock, however, sat stiffly for a moment as though struggling with himself before saying, "Do you really think the idea was brilliant?"
A tray banged loudly down onto the bench beside him, splattering bits of rice and sauce across the table. A drop landed on the sleeve of Jim's navy shirt; the Irishman sent a sharp look in the newcomer's direction before wiping at it with a napkin.
, John tries to think of other words in vain – and employs his viciously sharp elbows in an attempt to hoard the cake for himself; within a series of blinks the situation escalates like a snowball rolling down a hill until both men are on the floor, berry compote smeared over their faces and arms, giggling madly and still attempting to incapacitate the other. A small part of John's brain not focussed on Sherlock's long, agile fingers digging into his sides decides that this is what heaven will feel like when one day he gets there.
Sherlock cleared his throat absently, still gaping at the spot where it had vanished. "I did it," he said.
kiss, and Sherlock shied away from it almost without realising it. John allowed him to pull away, stroking at his cheek in comfort. "It's been a long time since someone took care of you, hasn't it?"
Sherlock didn't know what to say, so he clutched tighter instead, rubbing the tip of his nose against the warm chest in front of him.
, and he was fairly certain that other people's friends didn't offer them casual sex. But he'd never done anything by tradition, and, by the sounds of it, neither had Julien de Richelieu. "Good, then. We should –"
"Oh? What's that supposed to mean?" he asked, flipping a smile at the woman across the counter as she scanned his passport.
He tries not to look for Sherlock's reaction to this statement so as to appear nonchalant, but even so he registers that the detective is staring at him. Then Sherlock smiles.
, eventually, but Sherlock was draining his mug of ale dramatically - with his head tipped back and his throat working visibly, distracting John for a moment - and almost slamming it down on the bar. "Come on, John," he said briskly, striding into the foot or so of space between them and Will's group of audience.
Kemp simply stood a moment, looking from one to the other with eyes narrowed knowingly. John felt himself squirm slightly under the accusatory gaze.
And then she's skipping off down the stairs, and I'm left alone staring at the empty doorway and the positively malicious smiley-face on the wall and the message from John on my phone.
The detective paused for a moment, looking almost shy in the face of the playwright's obvious lack of surprise. "I received a note this morning from Mycroft's office," he said after the moment had passed. "Constable Lestrade has returned from Sussex. I thought you may like to hear what he has to say."
I know it isn't healthy. But I can't help it. I want to know that he cares about me more than he wants to spite me by proving that he's right.
Sherlock's head shifted, his nose twitching into John's underarm and breathing in the surely unpleasant scent there. "Yes," he said quietly, his voice vibrating through John's clothes.
"I know what I want," John counters. "And I know a part of him wants it too, but he's convinced himself that he can't have it." He sighs. "I don't know. Sometimes I think I could manage having a relationship with him the way he wants, you know, romantic but not sexual. Then he
after the case is finished that it's actually alarming. He sits up, though, to receive the doctor's gifts without thanks.
is a term for short, quick back-and-forth lines, and this scene is possibly the only Shakespearean exchange to which I would apply it.
James hefted himself up onto the kitchen bench, ignoring John's frown. "Actually, that one's easy. Aunt Hermione invented it."
And then John's hands were in his hair, tugging and pulling and massaging his scalp, and Sherlock slipped a few inches further into the water with a deep groan. "Oh, my God," he moaned, his back arching at the feeling of John's fingers on his temple. "Oh, my God, John, where did you learn how to do this?"
He caught Will's eye as the detective was running circles around Molly in their first scene together; the playwright grinned at him and mimed wiping his chin, as though to indicate that John was drooling over the two young men on the stage. He sobered quickly. Happy as he was for people to know what was happening between himself and Sherlock, they had not discussed it between them. Sherlock often ran in different circles than he did - his brother worked directly for the
The two of them were still on the bed, still tangled up in each other's naked forms, skin now slicked with the particular sheen of cooling sweat. John watched as they kissed languidly, hands roaming with reverential fondness.
John had always laughed a little at how quickly Theseus overturned Hermia's father's determination that she should marry Demetrius and not Lysander. Egeus' insistence on having Lysander's head and Demetrius' heart was essentially the driving force of the play, and yet once it became apparent that Demetrius' heart had - perhaps unnaturally - returned to Helena, one sentence from Theseus denied the lord's cries for justice and ensured a happily ever after for the lovers.
He wouldn't blush, but it might be a near thing; either way, there's barely any doubt that John would venture closer until he was perched at the end of the bed, at which juncture Sherlock would awkwardly pat the space beside him. "Would you stay?" he'd ask, if he was brave enough. And John would, of course he would, but that would be it: the actual conversation of
John almost stopped walking, a further flash of irritation gripping his muscles at the scornful note in the other man's voice. "Don't be thick," he told the detective. "He adores you. His admiration of your work is what got him into theatre in the first place. His getting to rehearse with you is a dream come true."
Sherlock looks at him under the hand raised for a taxi. "That would have been a lie, then, John. I'll almost certainly have to tell Mycroft and her husband about it."
He snatched his wand off the table on the way past, one hand still doggedly hanging onto one of Sherlock's belt loops, and dragged him at the fastest possible speed without breaking into a run down the hallway to his bedroom, where he proceeded to pin the younger boy against the wall and try his very hardest to slip his hand into his sinfully tight trousers, having given up the hook-and-eye as a bad job. Sherlock chuckled into his mouth and slid his own hands under the significantly looser waistband of John's jeans to grab two handfuls of his arse and pull their groins together.
had become a sort of code between them, John's way of calmly letting Sherlock know he was using him, inconveniencing him when he didn't really need him there. Until John had started pointing it out, Sherlock hadn't realised how often he kept John around simply to watch his fond, amazed smile. "No," Sherlock replied hastily. "I want to re-enact it. To get an idea of what he would have been like, what
It had always amused John how the comic relief in Will's writing often made the most poignant points; Kemp had made a mastery out of wordplay in the years they had worked together. John knew for a fact that when each new cue-script was released he would sit with the playwright and explore every possible meaning of each line just so that the double-entendres made it across to the audience. He wasn't sure he quite managed to look impatient and frustrated with the constant diversions while he was so impressed by the fact that nothing that the other boy was saying was straightforward.
The blonde was sitting at the bar, nursing something brightly-coloured and smiling at Henzell as he kept chatting to her while drawing lager from a tap. Sherlock wondered if she had sat down there of her own volition or if Henzell had taken her there on purpose so that he could talk to her and work at the same time.
"Oh, is that today?" Vienna asked disinterestedly. "Well, Tom will drive you there. Do try not to get into any trouble this year, won't you, Sherlock?"
The Sunday market, when they get there, turns out to better resemble a holiday fun-fair. Along with the usual vegetable stalls and people flogging home-made crafts, John spots a bouncy castle and a candyfloss machine, which he naturally drags the detective over to in a buzz of excitement. Sherlock tuts in irritation at his childish behaviour, but John can see the tiny uplift of amusement at the corners of his mouth.
The phone is off before the end of the sentence. "Come on, John, they've noticed something back at the crime-scene."
John waits until he's sure Sherlock is finished, then nods slowly. "Thank you, Sherlock," he says gently. "I didn't know how much I was hurting you, but now that I do, I promise you I'll try to stop, okay? I'm not going anywhere, not if you don't want me to, because I really don't want to."
He smirked slightly as the Doctor still didn't move. "It's a complicated system," the Timelord said dubiously.
he gasped, shrugging his shoulders in order to try and shake her off. She stepped back, looking hurt, but a quick glance at her feet showed that she still only possessed her own shadow. He would have breathed a sigh of relief if he could have breathed at all.
The detective gave him a sceptical look. "What did you expect, a half-collapsed hovel filled with rats? Just because they're orphans doesn't mean they can't maintain the house."
Sherlock grabs John's hand and drags him over the doorstep. "To an extent, my Lady. Your husband has sought my services since last we spoke and I was hoping you might reconsider your reluctance to keep this matter from him given the severity of the situation."
There was a pause for a moment, in which John sipped his tea again and shifted his knee subtly against Sherlock's. "I'm Vince," he introduced.
He wondered whether Sherlock meant he didn't mind being surprised in performance, or didn't mind John kissing him - or maybe the two were the same thing to him, and the kiss had been nothing but a tactical stage action.
Their hips were still rocking together, beyond Sherlock's control now; pleasure was sparkling through his chest with each slide of John's cock against his. "John," he murmured, removing his hands from the doctor's arse and working it between their bodies to wrap around their cocks. "I can't - I need to come, we can -"
Bill laughed and clapped him on the shoulder. "Whatever you say, lover-boy," he replied. "Maybe the army can change your taste, anyway. Lots of muscly, tanned men to ogle around here." He held his ground as John shoved him in mock-offense. "No offense meant, of course – I'm guessing you weren't expecting Timmy back there to last long-distance?"
Sherlock slowly lowered himself back into his chair. "It tells us that there are potentially multiple groups of people involved. If Crocker and Carfax were trying to check in on my progress with the Brackenstall case, then they're unlikely to have instigated it, although they most likely know who did. If Lady Brackenstall knew Lady Carfax's secrets - or even if someone suspected that she did - then I don't doubt Lady Carfax would be highly invested in finding her."
The door to the left of the desk swung open and a young red-headed man stepped neatly into the room. "Mister Fitzherbert," he replied politely. "How can I be of assistance?"
Sherlock stopped as he was about to round the corner, turning back to face them with one eyebrow raised. "Are you coming, John?" he called back, a touch of a smile colouring his lips.
The pleasure of his second orgasm in John's body left him breathless and exhausted, panting and trembling on his bed. As the climax faded, the fact that he hadn't slept the previous night came back to him in full force. He dragged his fingers lazily through the fresh come over his stomach and chest, sighing happily, and before he could stop to think whether it was a good idea, he had dozed off.
Sherlock snorted, although he didn't bother to attempt to deny that he had also been achingly curious. "We should probably get out of here before the police turn up," he mused, looking around at the people picking themselves up off the carpet. "
Sherlock hummed agreement. "It can also be incredibly irritating if other actors get the wrong idea from their lines. Often, that far in, it is too late for simpler men to change their readings."
"That would be me," Sherlock said easily, allowing the visitor a tight smile along with his calculating once-over. "This is my colleague, John Watson. He has been assisting me in the investigation into Lady Brackenstall's disappearance."
It was indeed alien. Sherlock tried not to visibly react to the fact that the thing looked incredibly like a rhinoceros someone had trained to walk on its hind legs and squeezed into a spacesuit and carry on with his deductions. He'd been on a roll. "So," he continued briskly. "Safest bank in the world, I'm assuming that's not a coincidence. Money you could get much easier from somewhere else, and hardly anyone keeps money here anyway. No, there are far more important things in these safe-deposit boxes. What is it, then? The Jewel of the West? The beryl coronet? Some sort of Nazi relic?" the rhino remained impassive. Sherlock narrowed his eyes. "No," he breathed slowly, tilting his head critically. "There must be something else. Something you think I don't know about, something you think
"Now, if I had someone like you so completely at my mercy," the doctor purred, sliding his chest down Sherlock's body. The friction as he slid across Sherlock's groin made him whimper helplessly. "I would start
Angelo beamed at the two of them when they arrived in the bar downstairs; Sherlock tried to look unaffected, but John saw the edges of his mouth twitch upwards anyway. "On your way out, then?" the innkeep asked them, whisking a cloth around the inside of a mug with practiced ease.
"You have to admit it," he says factually a few minutes later. I cringe. I knew he'd do this, and I hate these kinds of conversations. "You never really know what pieces of random, irrelevant information you might need."
Sherlock fixes him with a glare that would make even the most stoic criminal wonder what they'd done wrong. John supresses a smile. "Yes, well done, Inspector. It's tobacco ash. McCarthy smokes
John Watson snorted incredulously. Sherlock had the distinct impression he'd missed something important,
"Then I think we will get on very well," de Richelieu parried, still smiling. Sherlock gave one look back at Julie Simpson before sliding into the seat beside the French boy and dropping his bag to the floor. Julien winced slightly as it hit the ground. Sherlock smiled. This was going to be interesting; de Richelieu was a neat-freak and he, Sherlock, loved chaos.
"Very well," he said instead, affecting an unconcerned air. "When you are ready, Lady Brackenstall."
I vault off the sofa and am accosted by a sudden wave of nausea and lightheadedness; I sit back down abruptly and put my head between my knees. If this goes on much longer I'm going to have to eat under my own steam and admit to myself that John doesn't care about me as much as I thought he did.
to come because that would be embarrassing, because this was only meant to be pretend. He wanted John's lips on his again, wanted their chests rubbing together, wanted John closer and harder and
"Gracechurch Street, by the bridge," the man replied, looking slightly relieved that they were proposing to leave. "I believe her instructor's name was Miracle."
Sherlock led him up a flight of stairs as he gawked at the architecture, eventually emerging into an antechamber where a secretary sat at a desk beside a heavy dark wooden door, his sleeves rolled up to avoid ink blots from where he was painstakingly copying something. John couldn't help noticing that the man was both surprisingly young to be a secretary to someone as important as Mycroft seemed to be and incredibly attractive, with dark hair trained backwards over his head and a light flush across his high cheekbones. Sherlock didn't seem to notice, marching right up to his desk with his usual impersonal stride and drawing a deep breath.
Sherlock looks up at him from where he's curled weakly against his side. "Can't we… I suppose that's quite a lot to ask, to just go back to being flatmates and best friends."
His search for the keys was arrested by John grabbing his lapels and pushing him against the front door, standing on tiptoes in order to press their lips together. Their bodies rocked solidly against each other, and Sherlock momentarily wished that his coat was four sizes bigger so that he could button it closed around the two of them, shielding them from the outside world.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. "I'll make a few calls, John and I will investigate a few other angles so that we can find her more easily," he said briskly, avoiding John's eyes again. Lestrade looked suspiciously from one to the other nonetheless before apparently deciding he didn't want to know and giving up.
There was a considerable amount of seminal fluid in the condom when Sherlock turned it inside-out, but not as much as he would have expected. "He didn't finish," he commented, flicking it deftly right-way-round again and slipping it into the evidence bag Lestrade handed him. "From the amount of pre-ejaculate I'd say she started strangling him when he was close - probably when he lost control of himself. Maybe he did something that reminded her too much of Stephens."
style of address, and loop my arm over his like a Victorian lady, speaking in falsetto. "Of course, Doctor Watson."
Donovan glared at John as though his best friend's manners were his fault, but followed the detective with a huff of irritation. "What, in the three hours since you last saw him?" she asked incredulously.
She didn't try to reinforce how much she'd liked him, how upset she'd been to hear that he was dead. That was the most common mistake people made, pretending to be too upset about the death of someone they'd killed.
"Nice place," he commented airily as John showed him into his own bedroom. His flatmate chuckled again.
Marchbanks led them down a few corridors, then stopped and turned to Hannah. "What's going on that you need access to the forest water supply, Professor?" he asked. Hannah looked at Sherlock uncertainly.
Lestrade raised an eyebrow, surprised to have been spoken to so sweetly. "It's my job," he said roughly, and John thought that he saw a slight red tint to the man's unshaven cheeks. "Glad I could help."
Sherlock frowned. "You'd do that?" he asked. Lestrade wasn't sure why, but he nodded. A slow, shy sort of a smile spread across the emaciated face. "Why?"
Sherlock smirked. "One day, London will have a proper law enforcement authority," he commented idly. "The current system is close to useless. That's why I have so much custom - the Justices hold the title to impress people, not to actually make a difference. And the ones who employ Constables don't pay them enough for them to do anything because they aren't paid themselves. If you want a crime solved, you either have to do it yourself - and those so-called 'vigilantes' are more of a hindrance than anything else - or hire someone like me. And there are no people like me. Only me."
"Both he and Lady Carfax looked like they were begging me to investigate, but wouldn't give me any information themselves," he mused, throwing himself back from the desk and beginning to pace with no further introduction. "Did you see that little smile when I mentioned the jewellery? It's like they're trying to find out how smart I am."
Detective Inspector Gregory Lestrade rolled his eyes at the sound of his wife's shout, grabbed his coat, keys and wallet from the chair in the hallway and banged the front door of the flat closed against the continued shrieks of
It wasn't until he had closed his front door behind him that his anger cooled and he realised what he'd said.
- John had never considered how often he thought of Sherlock as cold, untouchable, like a marble statue placed somewhere to be revered but never reached. It was a fundamentally flawed view; certainly the detective came across as unemotional in the interactions with other people that John had seen, and a few other members of the crew of
Sighing, Sherlock tipped the computer off his lap and stared resignedly at the growing damp patch on the surface of his trousers. He would have to change them before he went back into the living-room.
" The detective looks as though he's trying very hard to stay calm, and John's heart reaches out to him the way his arms can't. "About us, he'll know what happened."
had informed them that Milverton goes to bed without fail at ten-thirty every night and is out like a light. How she knew this, John hadn't bothered to ask.
"Sherlock's been hurt somehow," he told her. "Take Doctor Stamford down to the transporter bay to bring him back here, would you? The Captain said she's taking their report here. Apparently we lost another crew member too."
Sherlock raised a languid eyebrow. "It's better quality than the stuff they actually used. This will only stick to itself, not to your skin.
"Clearly, we're here to see Lestrade," Sherlock drawled unconcernedly, sidestepping her to enter the low building. "New evidence has come to light regarding the Brackenstall affair."
mouth?" he teased. "I've been making less noise than you." To illustrate the point, he ground their hips together once more, quick and brutal this time; sure enough, Sherlock bit off a loud noise, then chuckled, admitting defeat.
Sherlock took a step closer, before seeming to check himself, to consider his options and their implications. He gave John an obvious glance over and then smiled mischievously.
John watched the others nod and wondered if he wanted to disagree. He'd heard of the situation before, assuming that someone was 'bad' and then finding out it wasn't entirely their fault. Bill had said something about it being discovered in the justice system that most violent people had troubled childhoods, or something. "I guess, if someone like Carl comes along and tries to knock me unconscious after dinner one night, I'm not going to stop and ask him if his father hits him, I'm going to turn around and punch
," the Doctor continued, tapping out a distinctively short sequence at the computer. Sherlock almost laughed as the Judoon looked at each other; he didn't think their rhinoceros-like faces could register puzzlement, but their postures were doing a fine job of it.
"I have not seen any scenes that the three of us share," Sherlock said, frowning. "Actually, considering the fervour with which Orsino pursues Olivia, it surprised me. It would be an interesting device if the two did not share the stage until it is too late."
"Well… it doesn't really matter. Do you need a lift back to London? I can help you with that. Always wanted to visit 221B Baker Street."
He comes to sit next to me on the sofa, frowning at me. My heart twinges uncomfortably at the expression on his face: it looks horribly like disappointment. "Sherlock," he says softly.
The Doctor shrugged. "They're called the Judoon, they're more like hired thugs. They call themselves police, but really they work for the highest bidder."
The kitchen table was completely hidden under textbooks and endless scrolls of parchment. John threw himself back into a chair and immediately felt his brain cloud over. "It seems so pointless. Who cares who
Sherlock tried again. "I… I didn't mean those things I said to you. I was just… I didn't know what to do, I was scared, I thought you'd… well, it's what always happens in situations like this, isn't it, the student gets their heart broken? And I'd just had all that stuff with Julien and I… I just didn't want to get hurt."
John shuddered. He could only imagine the horror of stumbling over that body in the dark. When he glanced at Sherlock, however, the detective's mouth was still bent into the tiniest of smiles. "I dared not call out, but I searched the house for Mary, and she wasn't there. Someone else was in that house that night, Master Holmes - it was I who made the room look as though it had been burgled, but I didn't kill Lord Eustace, and I certainly wouldn't have harmed Mary."
a different killer's handiwork. "What do you think, John?" he asked, looking back at the doctor. He had plenty of ideas himself, of course, but it was always helpful to get John's opinion first, and he was slightly hopeful for a repeat of the last time he had asked it, when John had completely surprised all of them with his analysis.
"That coffin," Sherlock continued, throwing on his clothes in a decidedly haphazard manner. "Did you notice anything unusual about it?"
"Not yet," his friend replied, a tiny smile flickering over his face. "I left it with Ed at the Globe, I'll give it to him after
He smiled nonchalantly at the officer - he knew technically he shouldn't have said that himself, but Lestrade didn't even know the woman's name. "You do not have to say anything," the DI interrupted her gruffly, catching her flailing hands and drawing them together behind her back, "however, it may harm your defence if you do not mention when questioned anything you later rely on in court. Anything you do say may be given in evidence."
in here made it even harder to believe that he was really just made up of thoughts in someone else's mind. "Okay," he said. "I'll see you on the other side, I suppose."
The taller boy grinned suddenly. "English." It was his favourite subject, but John often wondered how much attention he was really paying to his grammar and how much was going instead to the body of the young female teachers that populated the subject.
James Potter had patted him reassuringly on the back, but he had barely noticed anything until a small blond boy he had seen on the train plonked onto the bench beside him, put a hand on his shoulder, and asked him if he was all right. John had comforted him then, cheered him up right through his worry until his mother had written to him rather stiffly to say that they did not mind what house he had been sorted into. By the time the crushing fear of disappointing them had faded, he and John had become friends. By the time they had sat their Ordinary Wizarding Levels together at the end of the previous year, Sherlock had fallen completely head over heels in love with him.
He nodded briefly at the bigger boy, then turned and slipped through the doorway beside the sign declaring
made enough of an impact that he did not comment on it. "I need access to the system that controls the water supply to the forest," the Doctor pressed. "We must be able to feed the relevant nutrients to the forest through there and seal it off before any of them escape through the campus."
Sherlock drops one hand and sighs. "I'm sorry," he says, his deep voice trembling. "I'm really sorry, John. I thought I could do it, but… God, I'm sorry."
Sherlock looked at Hannah and Marchbanks. "We're fine, except that the lights have died. They came on at first and then they sort of flickered and went out – but we found a torch, so we can still see to some extent. It'll just take a bit longer to –"
telling. The tell-tale marks of a faded bruise on your left cheekbone, slight discolorations where it's happened before – you've been used as
"We thought maybe it was some kind of machine?" Kirsty cut over Sherlock's admittedly pointless question.
John looked up at his boyfriend of six months, wishing that he could feel in any way sorry about leaving him behind. Timothy was lovely, but he wasn't quite sure how they had managed to last six months. There had never been a huge amount of
"I'm holding you to that promise," she said softly. Sherlock smiled back, aiming for reassuring but feeling slightly derisive - it wasn't as if she could do anything if he didn't. She stepped forwards as if she was going to embrace him, so he stepped back hurriedly. "Right," she said softly. "Yes. Probably shouldn't."
She couldn't have killed Montgomery, and he didn't believe that she would have killed Stephens. Was there an explanation that still
Sherlock smiled at him. "As would I, John," he replied. "Your performance tonight was admirable. I've seen
Captain Adler hummed. "You can take T'Penya," she negotiated. "But you need psi-null crew members as well. And you can't take Doctor Watson," she pre-empted; Sherlock closed his mouth with a frown. He always looked surprised when the Captain seemed to know what he was about to say before he said it: John had tried to explain to him once that it was because Sherlock requested John's assistance on
The dark coat billowed slightly as the man made a dismissive gesture. "An old widow's wedding jewels," he told him. "The usual, although slightly cleverer than your average thief. She only noticed they were missing because her harpiscord was off-key. You're welcome to a share in the reward, clearly you could use the money."
"Perhaps, but that is not what I meant," Julien said, his voice still sparkling with barely-contained mirth. Sherlock blinked.
Once I noticed it, of course, there were other things: I began to read his medical journals and he my forensic texts and slowly the careful arrangement of each on their separate shelves dissolved until his things lay over-top and underneath of mine until it was almost impossible to discern which belonged to whom, all our belongings in a hotchpotch of chaos that, quite naturally, left the things that we needed easily accessible and the things we didn't buried under everything else. Mrs Hudson tutted every time she entered the room and saw the things spilling out onto the floor, coaxing a promise out of John to tidy it up that culminated in a few books being shifted from one pile to the next and left there.
"Yes, that one." They share a knowing smile before Gregson returns, at which juncture Sherlock positively wriggles in delight. "Now. I'd like everyone to know that I have found Neville St Claire." John tries to supress the giggle at his antics and settles for rolling his eyes at Dimmock instead. The DI scowls.
go," were tumbling out of it. He gasped and spluttered. The Doctor didn't move, keeping the screwdriver pointed at the light controls, his eyes fixed on Sherlock's feet.
was infinitely more rewarding. Even the scenes where it was only the two of them with dialogue there were others on the stage, watching and reacting, and the other players not roped into that particular scene were gathered on the fringes of the stage watching them. This was such a departure from the up-and-coming
personal relationships and yet here he was, kissing a stranger he'd met barely half an hour ago and somehow it wasn't an empty kiss but something heavy with meaning, even if John wasn't sure what that meaning was.
John would have been content to lie there for another few hours, perhaps days - but it was after only a few minutes that the detective drew in an especially deep breath and shifted, clutching reflexively tighter to John for the tiniest second.
When I said I'd take ages to update, this isn't really what I meant. I'm sorry. Also, last time I was vague as to where in DW canon this was - I think I'll firmly place it between The Angels Take Manhattan and The Snowmen now. And I've had this planned out for almost a year now and I've always planned to include Jack, Rose and the copy of Ten in various chapters.
John, too, watched the frown lines deepen on the detective's forehead. "I do," he said, turning his frown on the man behind the counter. "You cannot sell it, of course."
. It really wasn't at all awful. He trailed his fingers through it again and brought them back to his lips, painting them with it. He wondered what John's lips
John nodded, picking up their outer layers of clothing from the floor as Sherlock picked up the laptop and started typing. "Right," he said, not nearly as awkward as Sherlock had feared he might be but not entirely comfortable either. "I'll just… go and start dinner, then. Chicken all right with you?"
Not sleeping was a problem that Sherlock had fairly often, though, and so John did not comment when he woke up and found Sherlock still pacing the dormitory in his pyjamas and blue silk dressing-gown but merely patted him on the back in a conciliatory manner on his way to the bathroom. By the time he emerged in his Quidditch reds, their other dormmates having left for breakfast, Sherlock had climbed back into bed and pulled the hangings shut around him.
Intense affection for his beloved compelled Sherlock to pull John close again and kiss him soundly. “Maybe I am an angel,” Sherlock murmured, combing through John’s hair, “or in their service, anyway; sent by God, for only you.”
“I always enjoy your attention, sir,” the servant replied meekly, “but to be held in place for you… I only hope I can refrain from embarrassing myself too much, by being too loud or begging or l-losing control of myself like a complete novice…”
It is more equitable than ‘assistant,’ considering that you not only provide valuable expertise but now have begun to write of our adventures.
Encouraged, Sherlock did so, captivated by the pleasure on John’s half-hidden face. “Don’t be ashamed, John.”
“If your partner doesn’t know what he’s doing. But, if he does… Well, God left a little surprise there.”
It was clear to Sherlock that they should meet in neutral territory. Unfortunately, there was not a single space in the castle that could be used. The war room had only ever been his older brother’s domain, and Montgomery still seemed to govern the treasury. The meeting rooms and offices used by the current monarch were, of course, William’s.
As if it did not matter that Sherlock was still clothed, John respectfully took one of Sherlock’s wrists, and bound the compliant hand to one of the slats of the bed’s large headboard.
Oh, why do I persist in this self-torture? He could not possibly welcome such advances from me. There was that time he touched my face… but that could not mean as my fogged mind interpreted it. I cannot risk the thought.
“Oh, no.” Reluctant but steadfast, John pulled his hand away from Sherlock’s, ignoring the regret he felt when Sherlock frowned with disappointment. More than once, John had feared that Sherlock would offer him charity. “I don’t need your aid, I assure you.”
“Very good, sir,” flinging another artistic “sir” like a drop from a paintbrush. “I will be attending to the jacket that requires mending.”
“Sherlock, love, you’re wonderful.” Rocking steadily, John moaned, and Sherlock was so captivated by that sound that he hardly heard the urgency of his own breaths.
He heard footsteps walking down the hall outside the room. It was probably his employer, who had hired him as one of the many servants who cleaned up for the tournament. Whoever it was probably meant to make sure that Sherlock was doing his work.
“Well, John, there’s more. It might be justified, since his Highness has some strange demands for this position. You’d have to stay in the castle all the time, and do everything he says.”
I have the distinct feeling that I have not been kept informed about developments recently. Or I entered a very strange version of the reality I know when I stepped out of the hansom this morning.
The princesses were beautiful and refined, and it would not have been hard to believe that King John had enjoyed conversing with them. Sherlock was not at all sorry to see them dismissed.
Returning the blade to Sherlock, the king looked at Sherlock expectantly. It occurred to the servant that he hadn’t answered the king’s first question.
“Oh, well, that’s true enough.” What could John say about his new employment? It would be foolish to tell Sherlock what the man already knew. “I’ve been very lucky,” John said.
There was a dull pain in his leg, a memento of the war. John knew that the wound had healed and there remained no actual cause for pain.
“Don’t forgive me just like that, Sherlock. I know it’s wrong, to think like that. Everyone should be able to enjoy your violin. Oh, I’m losing hold of myself with you around. But there’s some music I do mean to keep to myself.” He leaned in closer, and let his hand drift down to Sherlock’s hips. “May I?”
John nodded briskly, and though William had tried to speak lightly, his servant still retained some of the formality associated with receiving a command, retracting his arms back to his sides. Yet John was smiling. “Yes, sir. Absolutely.”
John wished that Sherlock would stay with him for the rest of the day, that their respective roles in society did not keep them apart outside of God’s house. At the first thought of such a wish, however, John was compelled to swallow hard, for if he followed his treacherous, longing thoughts through to their end, God and society both would be appalled, and the former soldier did not need to give either any further cause to reject him.
John wished he could do more to reward Sherlock for bringing him so much joy. If only he could satisfy every longing his servant ever had, so that no one else could ever please Sherlock better.
All that John accomplished was thinking of what Sherlock would look like on his knees, his slender hands holding on to the king’s brawny legs and his face tickled by the coarse hair of John’s crotch. How gorgeous Sherlock would be, were he kneeling before John submissively, at the king’s mercy, ready to serve.
“Good evening, King William,” Lestrade said in an official manner, his hands clasped stiffly in front of his priestly cassock. There was a small wooden cross hanging from his neck.
“Yes, good. Lestrade, consider my previous orders delayed. You will stand here and model the cloak. John, you may return later for your measurements.”
“Do you think you’ll ever travel again, sir?” Sherlock asked, surprising the king when he placed his hand on John’s. It was a gentle movement, but unusually bold for his servant. Or, perhaps, not so unusual anymore.
Despite the sorry implication that Sherlock had been distanced from his brother for so long, John chuckled.
King John had compelled Sherlock’s hands to open, so that they were now rubbing together. Or, rather, the root of Sherlock’s need was kept still, as were his hands, while King John resumed his rhythm. Sherlock cried out as the king moved back and forth into the servant’s hands. Each thrust sent a ripple through Sherlock that made him shudder and moan with a powerful longing.
Leaning on John’s shoulder, Sherlock meekly raised his slender arms up to return the embrace. “My home is anywhere I can be with you, John.”
He wondered what King John was feeling—his dear master, who could not have been fully satisfied by someone as unskilled and mundane as Sherlock. He also wondered if he had experienced all that there was to experience, or if there were other ways the king could take his satisfaction from his servant.
This was about more than the cross, then. It was possible that John told Lestrade about William’s plans, though there were a number of other issues that might be bothering the priest. “Is it a serious matter?” William asked.
The soft, redeeming tones of his master’s voice broke the silence of the carriage. “John. You are sitting far away from me.”
John was so aroused and desperate that he lost his voice. William’s hand rubbed him with long and steady strokes.
Not sure of what he was allowed at this point, John carefully approached. “Of course.” His eyes too guilty to wander, he swiftly helped William undress, and aided his step into the bath clouded with bubbles.
There is no end to surprises in my life, sharing it as I do with a self-proclaimed consulting detective. No end to startling crimes, incredible deductions, and peculiar methods.
Father Lestrade nodded. “He is in a particularly sour mood today, and I don’t want anything to upset him.”
“Your M-Majesty!” was the broken cry that came from somewhere, somewhere that seemed so far away. After a moment Sherlock realized that the noise came from himself. It was an embarrassing sound for the servant, who should have been a suave, elegant lover who gratified the king attentively, yet there was little else he could do but cry out as the king made use of him this way.
I met Sherlock Holmes three years ago, on a cold December afternoon. It was to be the start of a rewarding and enduring friendship—but if you had seen us then, at our first meeting, you would never have known it!
William cried out, overwhelmed by making love to John this way, rubbing his beloved John with each thrust. He was captivated by John’s heat, of the understated strength of his legs.
With John’s help, Sherlock was able to undo the fastening of the king’s trousers. John heard his servant speak, though he was speaking very quietly under his breath. “Maybe this time, I’ll bear your child, God willing.”
“Of course, Sherlock, of course.” John took a deep, shuddering breath, trying to make himself wait, to give Sherlock all the time he needed. “Believe me, I’ll love anything you do.”
“Too much has been illuminated,” he remarked, lowering his voice. “In fact, you could say that the light has given out, and a new kind of darkness has fallen.”
It was new to his servant, however. Suddenly, the fortress excited Sherlock again. “What are those, sir?” he asked John, pointing at the various chains.
Sherlock whispered, “Do you know the demands you could make of me, what I would do without hesitation for you? I am more your servant than you are mine. I have been for a long time John, and I will be long after we are wed.”
In the middle of the secluded room, there was a giant, raised, circular cushion, with a headboard that curved around half of it. The circular bed had a plush blanket and several large pillows.
“No, Sherlock,” John swiftly protested, “that’s not how it is. I care about you, children or no. None of it is your fault.”
“The clasp in the front can be tricky,” one of the men said. It startled William, because it was his brother’s voice, and yet it was speaking in the gentle, unassuming way that William had not heard in a long time. “Try not to snag anything in it.”
With a hopeful spring in his step, Bertie leapt from the sofa, and made his way closer to the hallway (like I said, it’s a big flat). From there, he called out, “Oh, Jeeves, would you join us for half a tick?”
Indeed not. Now, if you would please, make yourself comfortable on Watson’s armchair. That should do nicely.
By the time Sherlock had finished changing for bed, into his sleeping gown and bonnet, his master had changed into a loose shirt and trousers. It brought mixed feelings to Sherlock to see that the king’s chest was mostly covered—the servant was relieved that the handsome sight no longer taunted him, but he missed it sorely—yet the collar of the king’s shirt was a low one, so that Sherlock could still see some of the hair on his chest. Another notable aspect of the shirt was that it had no sleeves.
Sherlock was almost certain that King John possessed a natural aptitude for controlling the horse that could not be taught, but he didn’t see the harm in trying. “Yes, that might help.”
As it turned out, the companies putting on performances enjoyed having an esteemed king in their audience, and they invited John to a number of other shows, where he was given the best seat available, though he was always insistent that he required an additional seat, to be used by the servant he relied upon. Nobody argued this point with the king.
As he had many times before, John led the way to the inn and acquired such a room. It was a place that John had stayed in before, having journeyed through this city a number of times. Looking around at the furnishings and finally settling his gaze on his loyal servant, John decided that the room had never felt more comfortable than it did when Sherlock was there.
“I will do so,” the priest agreed. The change in Montgomery’s mood seemed to be pleasing Father Lestrade very much. “Perhaps, sir, you would like to sew the cloak for him?”
John nodded, and proceeded with sponging the arm, though he was still very careful around the old war wound. As he cleaned the area, though, he noticed the hue of William’s distracted face become a little more flushed. John asked, “You’re sure I’m not hurting you?”
“Am I to understand that the principle to be,” Jeeves noted, “that, in the open and informal atmosphere generated by yourself and Mr. Holmes, I will find myself able to be on closer terms with Mr. Wooster?”
Their convoy was met with a warm welcome in the city. Nobles returned to their great houses, merchants unloaded their wares from faraway places, and there were even some bards who had joined the group at the festival, who now found audiences for their music.
There must have been a bright flush on Sherlock’s face right now, if the warmth he felt in his face was anything to go by.
Nonetheless, most of John hoped that Sherlock would read the letter, and visit him in what was to become his new home.
Sherlock was upon John in an instant, holding John with nothing but water between them, and kissed him more hungrily and deeply than before. Whimpering, John ground against him.
“Shh.” John kissed his cheek again, knowing that Sherlock often needed to be relaxed when they shared physical intimacy together. It was touching to be trusted to reassure his pretty servant, to ease him into the joys they could share.
Sherlock imagined the king fighting for his servant, defeating all suitors who would dare try to take away what was his. The thought was a very appealing one to Sherlock. “What would you do, sir? If there was perhaps a man who tried to steal me away?”
The king gradually began to thrust, to make Sherlock his own in this caravan where they had spent so much time together.
Jeeves stood up from the table, and gave me some obscure expression, like a smile, but more subtle than that.
Yet one day, I came to the dependable café, and there was sitting Sherlock Holmes. He was wearing his dramatic coat and generally looking as intense and impressive as if he’d popped out straight from the telly.
Despite Sherlock’s own annoyance at needing to be taught something so basic, he couldn’t resist one more jab at his amusingly embarrassed brother. “So when you said that Lestrade is the one who—”
Sherlock had acquired a closer seat for that contest, but the king had worn a helmet, so the servant could not make out anything more of the king’s face. Truly, that was a pity. Sherlock would have appreciated having a face to hold in his mind as he cleaned yet another sword. This task would be so much more interesting if he could picture the features of one who had the strength and character to wield this weapon and use it as only the noblest warrior could. He would have liked to know how the king looked when he grunted from the exertion of swinging a sword against his inferior opponent.
“That’s the one.” Though Father Lestrade often journeyed into town to speak with the common folk like a friar would, John knew that the priest was also the castle chaplain, who administered to the spiritual needs of the nobles running their country. “The monarch himself requested you.”
“I know, sir,” John murmured, though he still looked down at the floor. His sweet, beloved John. He deserved all that William could give him, and all that Sherlock felt for him.
Startled, John jumped and turned around quickly. In the dim light, he could make out the silhouette of a man sitting upright on the large bed, pulling aside the curtain. “M’lord?” John managed to say.
Well, why not? This story was a fairy tale. Sherlock could be part of a fairy tale, too. Maybe there really was magic in the world, which he could use to give a baby to King John. Or possibly, there was some secret of science out there, which would help him in that duty. He could pray for a baby, something he had seen some women do. Somehow, he would find a way.
A little out of breath when they pulled apart, Mycroft said, with half-hearted detachment, “I will find you, naturally. Enjoy your wedding,” he said cordially to Sherlock, and then left them.
John listened to the door close soundly behind Sherlock as he exited the chapel. He wished that he could have kept holding onto Sherlock. There were so many expectations on his lord’s shoulders that kept William from being happy.
“But it’s what you want, and besides, if I give you a child, I’ll always be connected to you, in at least that way.”
“You’ll see how big the place is, and you’ll understand. They hardly ever come across each other. Montgomery hardly sees anyone anymore.” The objective tone was threatened by a hint of sadness in the priest’s voice. He recovered somewhat, though, when he spotted something through the small window of the carriage. “Here we are.”
John was uplifted, not only because of the wonderful thing Sherlock had just said to him, but because Sherlock followed John’s lead with so much trust. Whereas the king had broad shoulders and strong arms, his whole body being that of a warrior’s, Sherlock was slender, almost delicate. Sherlock was trusting John completely, and that trust made John feel heady with desire.
“That’s much too generous, sir! I’m very happy with this cloak. But, um, I think Father Lestrade would like to have a pair.”
“Sherlock,” King John continued in that low, ardent tone, “it made me so angry to watch those people flirt with you.”
“Mycroft mentioned that,” Lestrade nodded. “I would be happy to.” It was a good sign that Mycroft had shared this much with the priest, at least.
Sherlock’s employment with the tournament would soon be over, and he would have to find new work, with people who cared not what he could do with his mind or what he felt in his heart, only that he was a poor servant. He would always be one. That was his lot in life.
There were many flowers around the temple, which was surely appreciated by the bees. It was also appreciated by Sherlock, who was seeing varieties of flowers that he had never before laid eyes on.
William listened with rapt attention. With nothing more than those words John possessed all that William was, and the servant did not seem to even be aware of his power.
This surprised John, but he was ecstatic to hear it. He started to feel very warm. “Oh, well, if you’d like that. I’d like that, too.”
“I can’t tell you here, Sherlock.” Truthfully, John was not quite ready to put his unconscionable request into words, if he was truly was going to ask for something so greedy from the innocent maid who was dependent on him. “It’s not urgent. I’ll tell you later.”
“You wouldn’t be able to divulge it to me. And Montgomery made his disapproving view of confessing to a priest very clear to me in the past. He wouldn’t have told you anything.”
“That’s enough.” As if he had not just shared a remarkable moment with his servant, the mercurial nobleman muttered arrogantly, “You have done more than enough.” He stood up from the bed, retying his dressing gown, making his way to the bathroom.
William could scarcely believe his good fortune. John had agreed to his plans, and if Lestrade agreed to assist them, then William could marry his beloved. He could raise the heir of the kingdom with the greatest man he had ever known. He adored the thought of such a life with John.
Did the king think that Sherlock was not adequate for this duty, because of his inexperience? Panic flooded Sherlock’s system. “I-I can do this, sir! Please, continue! I want you to, please!”
“You don’t mind that your friend is marrying another girl?” I asked, before I could let myself think better of it.
“Well, this is silly for me to even admit this, especially now that we do have time together, but I’m not sure I’ll be any good for a god on his wedding night.”
John wanted to do anything that would make King William happy, and he was certain that reuniting him with his brother would do just that, but for now, John wanted to pray. He would pray, and yet he would also imagine that Sherlock was sitting at his side, commenting on his prayer and making him laugh. Besides, with all these sinful thoughts he was entertaining, John believed it would be a miracle if God listened to him at all anyway.
He managed to open his eyes at some point, only because he wished to admire his dear master, and witnessed William touching himself as he satisfied John. It was more than John could bear. His tears were a mixture of passion and love. He cried Sherlock’s name.
“Oh.” Having been caught up in thoughts of Sherlock, John hadn’t considered that. He looked around at the trees and shrubs on the sides of the road, and indeed, they seemed familiar. “I hadn’t even noticed. Right, this forest does lie within my domain. I’ve been through here many times. Funny that I didn’t notice,” John commented, flashing a smile at his servant. “Well, I might be a little distracted, with you on my arm like this.”
“Yes, if that’s all right with you? I don’t want you to be scared. You may sleep with me tonight. My bed is large enough.”
He didn’t need to enter the room after all. Though still uncertain about Montgomery, he knew Mycroft could be trusted with John’s company. Quietly, William stood, and walked away.
It was alarming to see this noble king, a person who was usually calm and composed, so overwrought. “I’m sorry, sir.”
John brightened when he saw the water in the bath. “Oh, you’ll let me wash you again? But you didn’t have to run the bath, sir.”
Understanding hit Sherlock all at once. “Oh my God!” Sherlock cried, making Mycroft drive his hand to his own face in annoyance. “Isn’t that painful?”
Say what you will about Jeeves’s taste in clothes, one must say this much: it is consistent. No coins required flipping, nor had any runners needed to be sent to distant oracles. I knew exactly what to wear to this date to put hope for the species in my man. A quiet brown suit, complete with waistcoat, and a touch of deep red around the neck were altogether my ensemble. I considered garnishing myself with a stiff homburg to really make me sparkle in Jeeves’s eyes, it being an old-fashioned piece that Jeeves adored like a nephew. Though the antique gave me pause, it was an honest hat, and I was prepared to flip it off the stand; however, it occurred to me that pulling out all the stops so early in our courtship left me with little room to dazzle in future. So the homburg was put away for a rainy day.
The need in Sherlock’s core burned so hot within him that it was almost painful. He ought to have assured his master that seeing to his needs was not necessary, but Sherlock could think of nothing other than how badly he wished for the king to touch him.
You could not possibly know that I have been in Afghanistan. Even if… Even if you were capable of sight. You could not perceive such a thing. You must have learned about me beforehand.
Ordinary circumstances would have seen him smirking at the bewildered look on Donovan's face. John always seemed to get annoyed at people's beliefs that Sherlock had no emotions or empathy, but Sherlock had worked rather hard to make them believe that in the first place; it wasn't his fault that John made his emotions a lot more obvious.
Sherlock chuckled. "Of course, John," he replied with a quick press of his lips to John's once more. "I believe Angelo would be delighted to host us again."
"Don't deny it, John, I know you want him," Sherlock said, stilling himself with cold fury to look John heavily in the eye. "I know you think about it, like being the one he looks up to, the one he admires so much. And he'd let you if you tried, but you never will because you think you're nobler than that, while all the while you're driving him insane wondering whether you'll ever make a move. It's not nobility John, it's cowardice."
me," Sherlock backtracked, in a tone of voice that suggested the exact opposite, slowing his steps so that John didn't have to trot to keep up and turning to look at him. "You just don't know enough about this kind of work to make the claims that you were making with Lestrade."
, his brain kept repeating dumbly – pressing his hands into his thighs, applying pressure, trying to minimise the blood loss and hoping the kid would survive until they could get back to St Anthony's, and Bill was shouting at him but everything sounded so far away and he couldn't hear what they were saying as he fumbled with one hand for his medical bag because there had to be
He wanted to find out more about the man, needed more information to pursue the recollections hiding at the edges of his subconscious, like chasing someone's heels around the corners of a labyrinth.
Sherlock sighed as the door swung shut between them, the people around the tables who had been momentarily distracted by the arrest turning back to each other as though nothing had happened. "Something's not quite right," he said softly. "Or rather, a lot of things aren't quite right that could be explained away by themselves, but all together… it could be nothing."
"Do I look like I frequented clubs as a teenager?" he replied sarcastically, trying to lean his head back against John's shoulder but not managing because of the difference in their heights.
He awoke with a start to John's hand on his shoulder, shaking gently, his blue eyes fond. "I'm off to bed now," the doctor said gently. "You should head there, too. You'll get a bad back if you sleep on the sofa too much, it's really not long enough for you."
Sherlock, who hadn't slept at all, glared at him from the living-room table. John said a cheerful 'good morning, Sherlock', ignoring the glare completely until he had ventured out of the kitchen, balancing a stack of toast and two mugs of tea. "Didn't sleep, then?" the doctor asked, placing one of the mugs of tea in front of Sherlock and sitting down opposite him, careful to position the toast halfway between the two of them so that the invitation was clear.
"Tremendously," Sherlock confirmed, holding out John's coffee. "And then I was woken up by a possible lead on my case. Perfect predictors of a good day."
"Well, off you go." She waved a hand tiredly at the door. Sherlock gave Margaret a despairing glance; once upon a time, she had sympathised with the favouritism Vienna showed her eldest son and tried to encourage her to interest herself in Sherlock. She hadn't got very far, but it had been comforting to know someone was trying. Now she just shrugged and looked pointedly at the door. He supposed he must have lost her support when he stopped wanting to be a pirate.
Lestrade rolls his eyes long-sufferingly at John when they burst onto the crime-scene. Sherlock ignores him completely, striding up to a young man who's been handcuffed to the desk-chair. He looks around twenty, dirty-blonde hair falling like dirty straw in front of his eyes. His nose looks like it's been broken at least twice. The detective crouches in front of the boy, his knees cracking uncomfortably, his dark eyebrows bent into a frown.
" the detective challenged, momentarily pausing in his circle before seeming to check himself and carry on.
Sherlock shrugged, an irritated expression crossing his face as though this was a sore point for him. "We found his studio and knocked, but no-one answered us."
He knows the detective wants him. By Sherlock's own descriptors, they're attracted to each other – when he'd licked the compote off his fingers his flatmate's pupils had dilated and his cheeks had flushed, and suddenly he'd been in a terrific hurry to get out of there. But where does he go now?
Sherlock drew in a sharp breath, his hand tightening, speeding up as the words sent a thrill through him. "John," he squeaked, his voice impossibly high: he cleared it before continuing. "John," he repeated at a more dignified pitch, "John – say that again."
John squeezes Sherlock's feet gently. "Well, I do," he says firmly. "Very much. Now get off me, I'm making Bolognese."
There was silence for a moment as Lestrade glared at Sherlock. "I'm sure my brother will compensate you for your services," the detective added after a moment.
Released from Sherlock's stare, John allowed himself to turn to where Ben was standing with the rest of his entourage, arms folded, looking sulky. Sherlock's fairies, too, had retreated to the other side of the stage as though fearful of the argument between their king and queen. Titania's monologue about the boy that was the centre of their argument served as a tiny reprieve from the fury of their argument, which John took advantage of, stepping back a little to watch Sherlock's gestures and listen to the rolling cadence of his voice. Infuriatingly, the detective was actually directing his speech at Ben rather than John, moving from pinning him with the entire focus of his attention to pretending he didn't exist in the space of a few lines. Helpless anger bubbled in John's stomach, paired with a distant sort of admiration that he could feel like this when he knew everything was just pretend.
Sherlock's phone shouts a quick warning and the detective's eyes snap away from him quickly. John breathes out; for some reason, when his friend is looking at him, it's difficult to remember how to do ordinary things like respiration. "John," Sherlock says, making no attempt to locate the source of the trill. "John, phone."
He was able to take his eyes off his opponent for just long enough to see Sherlock throw the lid off the coffin, almost cracking the wood as it hit the floor, and stare into its depths with a strangely blank expression. "Sherlock?" John called back to him, stamping on Peters' foot before it could make an upwards jaunt towards his crotch.
Will's face was perfectly serene, very explicitly having expected this exact reaction. John couldn't help smiling along with him, although he made an effort to wipe the expression from his face whenever his newest friend directed his frustrated glare at him. "Of course they end up together. I told you they would."
he asked, Orsino's interest piqued despite himself. John tried not to look back at Will, remembering every story of his oldest friend's romantic conquests - eagerly listened to despite the horrible knife of jealousy each word drove into his heart. Sherlock raised an eyebrow at him; John patted his knee as he sat on the chair, as though inviting his companion to sit there. Will Kemp sniggered from the stage door, but John ignored him.
," he murmured sultrily into John's ear. John moved his head away from the boy's lips - partly because his voice was uncomfortably loud at such close proximity - and took a deep breath, as though resigning himself to his servant's delight.
One more year, he told himself. Then I can be free of this farce of society and learn how to start living.
it works, I said," Sherlock admonished, but he couldn't keep back the smirk at the expression of pure joy on the other man's face. His opinion really seemed to count for something in this man's mind – this
I shrug. "I'll think of something." Lady Trelawney-Hope stumbles back into the room with the safe-box, a silver key dangling from her fingertips. "Open it, quickly." I shift the contents of the box around a bit – other papers and letters and two USB keys rattle around – and then slip the blue envelope near the bottom of the pile so that it isn't visible from the top. "All right. Now go and put it back – exactly as you found it."
"She is an extraordinary woman," the artist mused. "A real beauty, and distinctly well-bred. She gave the impression of extreme control, as though her every movement was carefully considered before she made it. I have always speculated that such control comes from hiding some dark secret, but that is simply the romantic wish of an artist - there was never any evidence to suggest as such."
? Or was it some kind of revolutionary technology? Either way, his blood hummed at the intrigue. He hadn't felt like this in years and he couldn't help the sudden rush of affection for this
John grinned suddenly. "That's wonderful news," he said brightly. "To freedom," he suggested, lifting his mug in a toast.
He smiles placidly. Mycroft takes a deep breath and lets it out slowly. "I merely wanted to assess the level of your involvement in the situation," he says with an attitude of intense self-control. "I see Detective Inspector Lestrade has already been through. I'm sure the two of you appreciate the severity of the consequences should Scotland Yard get the wrong end of the proverbial stick."
John clutched the little girl tighter, sharing a worried look with the detective. "But that means -"
Ben popped up at the playwright's elbow, scratching thoughtfully at an ivy leaf on his sternum. "Is he sick? That wasn't normal for him."
"Well, yeah," Lestrade says, twisting his hands together. "It was like that when we found it. So we picked it up to straighten it. Come and have a look."
of that kid." John looked where he was pointing; Jim had taken the long way around the swimming pool and as John watched him, he idly flicked a neatly-folded paper dart at the blond boy as he walked past, disappearing into the men's changing rooms under the sign marked, 'DEEP END'. Had the circumstance been anything other than the fact someone's
Perhaps strangely, John's bumbling awkwardness almost made Sherlock want to laugh. "Probably for the best, John," he said, wishing that he would not, wishing that John would turn back and offer to help him out in that flippantly awkward way that he had.
"Yes, I know." Sherlock's long, pale fingers start up a jumpy, staccato beat on the black of his knee. "I get sick of people who read your blog approaching me on the street and asking me,
At his table, Will looked up at John once more to find the two of them staring at him and grinned. John tried not to look sheepish. "I always suspected there was a male lover in Shakespeare's past," the detective told him, sounding like he wanted to be smug about the discovery but a part of him was refusing to play along. John looked at him, surprised at the undertone of the words; Sherlock was still looking at John, a tiny frown buried between his eyebrows even as his lips smiled. "There are so many homoerotic subtexts to his close male friendships, particularly in his early work. That's another reason I've always enjoyed it."
Sherlock realised with a slight thrill. John was attempting to convey through his body language that Sherlock was spoken for, so subtly that it was probably subconscious. He smiled brightly as Tom stepped aside to let them into the bar.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow at him, but he was still smirking. "Only two people were drinking the wine, but they poured the dregs from both of their glasses into the third to make it appear as though all three had been used."
"The latter," Sherlock said briskly. Eliza looked rather stunned, as though she didn't believe women could be murderers. "It's imperative that we find her as soon as possible. Do you still have my phone number?" he asked Tom, who nodded, gesturing towards a business-card booklet visible under the bar.
The detective throws his overnight bag and his coat over the back of his sofa and gets ready to sweep straight into his room and slam the door; John sees this coming and calls out to stop him.
John cleared his throat quietly. Both men turned to look at him with vaguely surprised expressions. "Who
The Doctor started up a quick tap-tap-tap of his fingers on the table. "It's sort of… complicated. Alien-ey stuff. Time travel."
John stood up carefully, holding onto the wall against the aftershocks of the crash: assuming the young Sherlock could neither see nor hear him, he rushed to the room's window and looked out.
John's ears rang. "Sorry, who?" he asked softly. He'd been thinking it slightly since Sherlock had mentioned the boy came from Islington, but he'd thought that it was only because he'd just seen Jim and he'd been thinking about that incident for months from being constantly in Sherlock's presence.
Lestrade raised an eyebrow. "It would need to go to a Justice now, another Constable wouldn't be able to talk him around unless Peters allowed you access himself." He frowned slightly. "Couldn't Mycroft -"
Sherlock winced; telling Fitzherbert how to do his job didn't seem like something the man would react well to. Indeed, his face turned a darker shade of purple, but the suggestion of
John groaned, following him to the recommended piece of furniture and climbing on after him, settling comfortably between Sherlock's legs as he lay down. "This is familiar," Sherlock quipped, running his hands along the planes of John's shoulders and down his arms. "I wanted to touch your skin so badly my stomach hurt."
He looked so wound up that John bit back a chuckle and took a pacifying sip of tea. "I'm not saying you don't need to be able to do it, I'm just saying it's hard, and you shouldn't feel bad about having trouble," he said calmly. "Take a deep breath, first of all, you won't be able to do it if you're panicking about how important it is. Why don't you help me with theory first? You're good at theory, and the Patronus Charm will be easier when you're a bit more comfortable."
," the policeman replied, still sounding amusedly surprised. "John routinely complains about you being up at all hours of the morning. I just assumed you didn't sleep."
Sherlock frowned briefly. "I don't think she is," he admitted, "but I'm sure if we make enough noise she soon will be." John looked as though he wanted to look disapproving, but amusement won out and he laughed lightly. Sherlock grinned into another kiss. He
"I could help," Lestrade said, wondering as it was coming out of his mouth quite what he was signing up to, visions of the young man vomiting on his floor and occupying all of his attention floating to mind. "Once you're through withdrawal it'll be easier."
Sherlock still imagined it happening like that, imagined – to help him fall asleep after the disappointment of coming down from the high to an empty room – that John would climb into bed with him, wrap his arms around him and spoon him with his lips underneath Sherlock's ear to whisper things like
Sherlock scrambled to obey, climbing onto his bed on all fours, turning to throw John a terribly clichéd provocative look over his shoulder. The doctor snorted. "Don't tease," he commanded, delivering a sharp slap to Sherlock's rear that was dulled by the fabric of his trousers. No-one had ever tried to hit Sherlock in a sexual way before and he had never understood the point of pain-play. He wondered suddenly whether John, with his hitherto unexpected knowledge of BDSM techniques, might be able to explain it to him. "On your back," John continued. "Hands above your head. Keep your eyes on me."
Julien's mind whirred. There had to be some way he could turn this situation to his advantage; the Doctor could not even
"Right, good. Well, we were just straightening things out a little when we found… this piece of carpet over here isn't fixed down to anything."
Alone, John staggered back to the bench and sat down again. His own clothing was still awry; he tugged it self-consciously back into order, suddenly feeling slightly sick. Sherlock had taken with him the content thrum of John's orgasm, and now all that was left was the icky feeling of sweat and shock that he –
"I've never cast one, if that's what you mean," John deadpanned. Sherlock's face twisted into a mask of horror before John laughed and he relaxed, looking embarrassed again. "I know a bit. I understand them, I think."
John frowned; that didn't seem particularly wise. If he had to leave the theatre unexpectedly to pursue a case, the worst that could happen was that they would have to cancel the play. If he had to leave a case un-solved to perform in a play, it was possible that people's lives may hang in the balance; in this case, the life of a lady so highly thought-of that the Queen was invested in finding her. He directed the frown towards Sherlock, who gave him a reassuring grin. "Send Constable Lestrade and his assistant to Sussex," the detective suggested. "I expect we'll find more through the maid than we would from the inn, but the Constable can make inquiries there for us, perhaps take a look around her rooms, though I suspect they've tidied them already. Any evidence that might once have been found there will have been cleaned away in preparation for the inn's next guest."
Julien smirked. "Not that you'd know this from experience, because you obviously don't have any," he said gently. "Experience, that is. Sexually." His green eyes flicked up to meet Sherlock's shocked grey ones and his smirk widened in amusement.
John cleans himself up without moving, a bone-deep weariness consuming him. He'll deal with this – and with Sherlock – in the morning.
In a time that should probably win some sort of record, John grabs his own fork out of the drawer and joins in, batting Sherlock's fork out of the way to get to the lone boysenberry on top. Sherlock squeals – yes,
Sherlock – I spent twelve years dating men who looked like you without knowing why. I came back from Afghanistan because I remembered you and I wanted to find you, just to see if you still remembered, and then when I got here I chickened out because how
Sherlock's lips tightened yet further, and his hand dropped back to his side. "Yes," he said shortly. "He certainly seems enthusiastic."
John entered ostentatiously, arms outstretched, seeing Sherlock and their attendants fan out behind him. The two players turned to him with an apprehensive look.
, and stood stock still staring at his friend as though unable to believe his ears, as though his brain had been filled with a rush like a river where nothing made sense anymore and yet a great many things made more sense than they had in a long time.
Sherlock was quiet for a moment, but John could see his chest rising and falling more rapidly as though he was struggling to stay calm.
In the meantime, Sherlock rolled onto his side to look at John, still flat on his back and breathing to the ceiling. He swept his gaze down the doctor's body, smiling at the tan lines so defined at his wrists and neck it almost looked as though he was still wearing a shirt. He had always imagined John's body to be golden brown, but once the tan faded it was actually rather pale. Sherlock put out a hand and rested it, fingers splayed, over John's belly. He knew he was pale, but it was impossible to avoid a slight tan on the hands, and his hands were darker than John's stomach.
Said army doctor exchanged a disbelieving glance with Stamford. "We don't know a thing about each other! I don't know where we're meeting. I don't even know your
The Irish boy smirked again, but this time it was friendlier and more real; John smiled back. "None taken. Dublin's a shithole."
; he had seen that very same look on Mycroft's pinched face the one time they had met in person. He hoped that this wasn't the only representation of him in here, that the shame Mycroft made him feel about their relationship wasn't Sherlock's dominant view of it. It was interesting that the older, full-blooded Vulcan held a position of such power in Sherlock's mind.
Sherlock chuckled and gently eased his hands away from the doctor's neck, allowing John to gradually take his weight back onto his legs. "In all likelihood, yes," he agreed. He sighed as John climbed out from between his legs and sat down on the bed, awkwardly tugging at the damp fabric around his groin. "It's a ridiculous position to attempt to strangle someone from," he commented, not trying to sit up himself, "but I imagine her disgust at his different approach to domination would have made her want to get her hands around his throat as soon as possible."
Sherlock smiled thoughtfully. "Yes, he mentioned that he was playing Malvolio," he said, cupping his mug between long-fingered hands. "From what I've heard, he and Molly will have fun with it. Do you mind if I drink while we read?"
John couldn't suppress an amused smile at the youth's manner and the way his crisp diction had obviously put Sherlock off his stride. The detective snatched the piece of paper from the outstretched delicate hand with an irritated huff; the brunet smiled politely in response. John cleared his throat. "Sorry about him," he excused. The secretary's dark eyes flickered to him, an amused smile playing across his lips. "I'm John."
"Sorry for dragging you along, then," he said. "But look - these people just want to show you how much they enjoyed what we just did."
The younger boy smiled thinly as the rest of the table murmured acquiescence. "We'll pool our resources," Bradley agreed, finally giving up on his own food. "I have instant noodles and we could make some jell-o as dessert."
He forced himself to look up again, to watch himself sit back on his heels over the Vulcan's belly and take one of Sherlock's hands in his own, pressing his lips against the pads of his fingers. No doubt Sherlock had noticed John's fascination with his hands, with the culture surrounding the anatomical sensitivity of Vulcan fingers, because this John that he had imagined was running his lips carefully over Sherlock's fingers, then his tongue, then sliding the index finger between his teeth and hollowing his cheeks while the Science Officer lay stock still and wide-eyed underneath him.
"We tried something new and decided it wasn't for us," John replies, still with a blithely innocent tone of voice that everyone in the room recognises as entirely false. "That isn't Sherlock's fault. It's a little disappointing that it didn't work out, but I'm still glad that we tried."
He nodded, understanding. There had been men like that in the army. "And then she dismissed him, like Mycroft said, and he's kidnapped Carfax to try and get back at her," he finished.
Once again, he wasn't quick enough to hide the flush and the guilty expression, and John sat down on his own bed, gaping at Sherlock, turning inexplicably red. "You used
"I went backstage to talk to the boy afterwards because I didn't recognise him. Turns out he's not actually one of the Admiral's Men. He plays with all kinds of companies, so long as he likes the play and respects the other actors. Sort of… freelances."
Lestrade frowned, looking slightly bewildered. "Jagged or torn," he answered promptly. "Distinctive enough for the innkeep to mention specifically, at any rate."
, somehow, and Sherlock tried to end it as subtly as he could without John noticing that it was making him uneasy. He didn't want to kiss John like that -
John looks at the kitchen clock in surprise; it's eleven-thirty. "Really?" Where could he possibly be going at this time of night? He takes a cup of tea and a plate of left-over something-or-other out to the detective, who is lying on the sofa as though he has lost all strength in his deceptively-supple body. John takes that to mean that progress is being made. Sherlock has a constitution unlike anything he has ever seen before; he operates all in fits and bursts like so many pages of Morse code, all blinding energy and whirling winds when his mind is occupied but so much
For the first eighteen months or so of our co-existence his things stood out in rather sharp contrast to mine; in amidst the reams of old case-notes and treatises to the identification of perfumes and shoe-makers from footprints was the occasional shelf of tidy medical journals, an unassuming photograph of five men in army slacks nestled between the skull and the messy pile of unopened mail.
them like I delete the solar system. His blatant misunderstanding when I told him about the way I delete things was really more amusing than irritating, no matter how much I griped at him about it. I can feel Mrs Hudson bristling with indignation and it's comforting that I know she's on my side, but I'm glad she doesn't say anything. I don't need to hear how badly out of line he was, because I already
A moment passed while the Doctor continued to stare at him, his green eyes unbelievably sad. "All right," he said finally, tugging his hand out of Sherlock's. "Mr Holmes – can I call you Sherlock?"
On the other hand, Sherlock seemed to be the exception to all of the other rules that John had made for himself in the theatre. He lifted the hand steadying Sherlock's back and stroked it through his hair instead, parting their bodies just enough to press their lips gently together.
John grunts in assent. Sherlock nods. "Good. Because I think I'm onto something here. Straker's knife was covered in blood, but the man the police took in had no wounds of any kind on him, and that walking-stick thing wasn't sharp enough to cause the cut on Straker's leg. So how did the cut get there?"
John insisted that he help clean up after they had eaten, which devolved rapidly into a rather childish battle of John splashing him with the dishwater and Sherlock flicking him with the tea-towel in response, and so it was in amiable, slightly giggly quiet that they collapsed on the sofa, John reaching automatically for the television remote and then realising that the coffee table was on the other side of the room. He sighed. "Sherlock, can we…"
The shadows had collected around the outer wall of the castle, swarming and shifting, clearly looking for a way in. John suppressed a shudder and turned back to the Sherlock on the bed, who still hadn't moved.
Sherlock took advantage of John giving him an inch of space to shrug his shirt over his head and wrapped one hand around John's erection, spreading the fluid from his own finish over the head to smooth the way for long, luxurious strokes that made John's knees tremble, the younger man's tongue parting John's lips again.
"You like him," Will commented wryly to John, watching Sherlock bend to talk to Ben, who had come out onto the stage with a wide grin at the sight of his idol.
When he recovered enough to breathe again he slumped down the wall beside Sherlock, who had folded his legs out from underneath him to sit with his back against the wall, panting and delicately wiping the corners of his mouth. John snorted; it seemed so odd, seeing someone so composed handle something so helplessly undignified.
Sherlock shrugged. It was only Chemistry and Plant Biology he would be missing, and he knew all the coursework anyway. This swimming pool incident sounded much more interesting. Sherlock looked at the picture: the boy was immaculately dressed in the formal uniform that Islington High did not insist on but provided for its representatives, not a hair out of place. He didn't look like the kind of boy that would keep his shoes somewhere apart from his clothes. He wanted to go and see, to go and have a look around the swimming pool and the changing room, and the sooner he could go the better. He couldn't afford to wait for the weekend, or the pool staff would have re-opened it and cleaned everything away. "Suit yourself," he said, pushing his chair away from the table. Julien's piercing green eyes followed him out of the room.
"What can I do for you, Sherlock?" he asked brightly, picking up a biro and twirling it between his fingers. "Are you all right?"
Finally, Sherlock's back hits the wall and John steps forward triumphantly, angling his head down to press his lips to his flatmate's and inching closer. "
There lies your way, due west." He made a sweeping gesture towards the main doors to the Globe, out past the audience.
The boy beamed, his dark eyes lighting up. "Yeah," he said brightly. "He said he'd been meaning to ask me before I asked him.
John breezed through the written exam the next morning, smiling at his memories of the charms and spells his new lover had used to help him remember the facts he was regurgitating and sneaking occasional glances at the desk where Sherlock was sitting to help boost the recall. The glances he stopped around three-quarters of the way through the exam when he looked up to find that Sherlock had rolled up his own parchment, evidently finished, and was now chewing on the end of his quill and staring at him in a way that left absolutely no doubt in his head as to what he was thinking about. John flushed and didn't look at Sherlock again until he'd rolled up his own paper and felt free to return the suggestive expression in full force.
Shakespeare grinned. "That was the surprising bit. He's twenty-seven. He still plays women because they're more of a challenge to him."
On the corner of Baker Street, he stops in surprise. Sherlock is standing outside the door to 221, leaning against the wall, looking thoroughly bored as Alice St. Claire, dry-eyed and animated, talks at him. Both sport the air of people who have been in this situation for a very long time; St. Claire has settled into a definite rhythm with her talking, and Sherlock looks as though he's settled into a definite rhythm with playing
to tunnel under this street. So clearly someone's been up to something." He brought back the camera feeds to show the room that was supposed to have the staircase; it was lined with banks of safe-deposit boxes, but Sherlock couldn't see any kind of trapdoor or hidden entrance. It didn't look like there was anything in there at all. Except…
In unison - to John's surprise - he and Sherlock bent to place a kiss on each of Ben's cheeks before leading each other off the stage, followed by their entourage so that Robin Goodfellow was once more alone. The boy waited a beat before opening his hands to the audience for the epilogue.
"No." We stare each other down for a moment, then she reaches for the telephone. I roll my eyes. "Lady Hilda, I'm trying to work
Oddly, the same dynamic could be applied to Orsino's perspective of Cesario's interactions with Olivia: whatever the cause of the jealousy, he couldn't help but be impressed with the speed with which the servant he had become so fond of was wooing his intended, couldn't be sure whether it was jealousy of someone else seducing his lady-love or of a woman winning the affections of the boy he liked so much. And if it
Jim's mouth quirked in an odd kind of smile. "Fine, I suppose. It'll be more interesting when they've sorted out my math classes, but Law and Politics is good. They didn't offer that in Dublin."
finished talking about me behind my back," Sherlock's voice echoed from the sitting room, not without a trace of amusement. John looked at Lestrade and shared a smile.
is taken pretty much straight from the work of Stephen Orgel, who uses the exact same Gertrude example. Also, I doubt that people were really applying Freudian theories to
"Oh," the detective said shortly, snapping his head back to front and pushing his hands into the pockets of his coat. "Perhaps. I did notice that Shakespeare's reaction to having an idea is similar to my own. I thought that may be why I appeal to you as an acquaintance."
It was two days before the man woke up in hospital, but they phoned Lestrade anyway and he went, half-mad with back pain from the sofa he'd been sleeping on in his sister's flat and the stress of trying to work through it. He took the bus because his wife still had the car, and as he approached reception to ask what room the overdose patient had just woken up in because the nurse who phoned hadn't left a name he
"I know," his friend dismissed. "I know the army was something you needed to do that was nothing to do with me, and Anne wasn't anything to do with you. When I think about us back then - it was great, but I don't know where either of us would be now if we'd stayed together. I'm just happy that you've found someone now that you look at the way you used to look at me, who looks at you the way I used to."
" Sherlock continued, lifting his hand to stroke the skin beside John's eye, which he closed to enjoy the contact.
"We just weren't ready for each other," Sherlock said quietly. His grey-green eyes flickered up to John's face for a moment before darting shyly back to the window.
it can't be conquered overnight." He released him to arm's length with a sheepish smile. "I'm still fighting mine too. But what I felt last night, that's stronger than my jealousy, and I know it's stronger than yours, so I know we'll get over it. I always thought emotions were inadvisable because they're irrational and they're never certain, but the way I feel about you is one of the most rational and certain things I've ever encountered. I needed to think about that away from you for a moment, so I -"
A mask descended on his face and he tried to shrug it off – he worked in this makeshift hospital, he knew what they put in those knockout gas concoctions and it wasn't nitrous – but Bill stood up and the man behind him was strong and he supposed if his friend looked
John frowned. "You can talk to me about things that are bothering you outside the play, you know," he told him firmly.
and the nonverbal power struggle that John still wasn't entirely sure was simply their characters - Sherlock's fingers found better purchase against his chest and pushed him roughly away. Still deep into his character, the detective tugged his dress back into place with an affectation of the utmost fury - but as he glared at John, there was something in the depth of his eyes that only looked stunned and lost, like Sherlock himself didn't know how to pull himself back together. A twinge of guilt pulled at John's stomach.
"But…" Sherlock propped himself up onto his elbows as John shifted so that he was straddling him, sitting calmly in his lap. "But you were talking just the other day about how pretty Frankie Spinnet is! I thought you…"
"I don't understand," Hannah continued as they set off back down the Maintenance hallways. "We've had people in there for at least a year now, gardeners and such. If there have always been Vash… whatever they are in there, why did people only start dying last week?"
the detective answered, a definite coy note to his voice now. John did not see the gesture he made, but Will raised an eyebrow in amused surprise.
"He used to," Sherlock corrected. "He was employed to do the Queen's… dirty work. The things Her Majesty wouldn't want to know about. He had a significant hand in the removal of Deveraux after the
Sherlock shoots him a grateful smile. "Well, the killer seems to like his colours. You so perceptively noted with the first murder that everything was red; he dresses them up in one colour, picks a spot that reflects that colour, etcetera. Rather juvenile, but it seems to work for him – there have been three bodies so far, all women. The first one you already know; it was found in a meat-packer's, decked out in red. The second they found in a tulip bed in the botanical gardens –"
Sherlock knelt in front of the doctor and shook him gently. "John," he murmured. "John, time to wake up."
"It's beautiful," John agreed, though he didn't mean the language. Sherlock's voice seemed to flow through him like climbing into a hot bath.
by someone, and John had always been unable to resist being that someone – particularly if he would be the
John chuckled. "You don't dance very often, do you," he commented. He used his own voice rather than the one he had been using against the counter, so Sherlock answered truthfully.
Gradually, the pub hushed as more of its patrons turned to watch Sherlock glare daggers at John, who looked around; the next line was not from either of the characters that he and Sherlock had adopted, and he didn't think Ben knew it, allowing the pause to grow awkwardly as he waited for it.
. Sherlock still doesn’t react. John keeps licking him, grooming him, petting him. He can feel his mood gradually improving.
But this time there will be no escape. Detective Inspector Lestrade has promised that Sherlock can help on cases. Real, genuine, interesting puzzles, something for his brain to gnaw on that isn’t itself. The only condition is that he has to be clean.
Sherlock shrugs. It’s grey and windy; admittedly, leaving the cottage doesn’t hold much appeal. Hopefully it won’t rain later.
Sherlock wants to protest, but it’s true that he’s feeling fuzzy. Whatever unfamiliar presence is haunting the periphery of his mind palace is draining his energy. Sherlock rolls onto his side, facing John.
The wind rattles the windows. Sherlock shuts the door and slips into bed with him. Another flash of lightning lights up John’s face. He’s looking at Sherlock, sleep-rumpled, hair sticking up. The storm didn’t disturb him — he is adept at sleeping through loud noises when he needs to — which means he was woken when Sherlock opened the door.
He herds Sherlock upstairs, packmate, protection. Sherlock’s mind is still dazed, a little tied up with his wolf’s, so he doesn’t know if he’s imagining the feeling of John’s eyes on his naked arse or not.
A phone box starts ringing as he passes it. He ignores it. This is why he’s turned his phone off. Any contact from Sherlock (or his brother, about Sherlock) and he’ll just be even more confused. He can’t afford to mess this up.
Midnight is already a long time after the mid-afternoon chase, but he decides to wait a little longer. It’s not worth getting caught. Besides, his wolf and his body are more than happy to rest up after the earlier exertion.
John stumbles into the flat and Sherlock can immediately see that he’s been in a fight. Pub punch up? No, he’s not actually drunk. And his injuries — that Sherlock can see — aren’t consistent with pub fights. No black eyes. A set of parallel scratches running down his neck. His limp is pronounced. No bruises at all. What fight has he been in, if not a pub brawl? Why is his top on inside out? Why is Sherlock’s wolf insistent on telling him something about John’s scent? He’s anxious, in pain. He’s—
like he’s never wanted anyone before. John's tongue traces along and around Sherlock’s finger. Sherlock’s other hand slips to John’s arse and pulls him closer. His cock presses against John’s belly and he groans, eyes fluttering shut. John relinquishes Sherlock’s finger and goes back to his neck, leaves a mark. Sherlock’s legs tremble. He wants, he needs, he wants to make John feel good too. He bends his knees, just enough to line their cocks up, his hands on John’s arse guide them together. John’s hips push once, twice, sliding their cocks against each other. Sherlock groans John’s name.
“There’s no footage of which vehicle they used,” Lestrade says. “And I think these men would have enough sense to dump it and change vehicles at some point.”
“Slow and steady?” John says. He’s not sure he’ll be able to manage slow and steady though, not with the tight-hot-yes of Sherlock around him.
The town is very small, almost a village, but it does have a small Tesco. John gives Sherlock some of his cash and sends him to the local butcher’s before they close for bacon and eggs. He finds John after, in the Tesco, and eyes the contents of his basket.
Sherlock wraps his arm around John again, running his fingers over his chest as he starts thrusting slowly between his thighs. John arches into his touch, his hand squeezing Sherlock’s thigh when Sherlock brushes a finger over a nipple. Sherlock runs curious fingers along the edges of John’s scar. This friction, this wet slide on his cock feels incredible, he feels like he could lose himself in the sensations, so much stronger than when he’s touching himself. His cock rubs against John’s balls with each thrust.
Sherlock feels a hand on his back and turns, stumbles slightly on four legs he’s not used to, and the wolf mind is in control.
Sometime before the first hour is up he realises the last time John spoke to him was during the chase. Their last communication was when John had grinned at him and shouted, "I'll get him!" then sped off ahead. It had all gone wrong. John hadn't spoken to him since he was injured, he hadn't brokenly said it hurt. He had just winced and started dimming.
You’ll always feel your wolf as a presence in the back of your mind. But if you’ll accept it, it will keep quiet, unless the moon is nearly full, or unless you deliberately call it out. It feels foreign to begin with, but if you take it in, your brain will recognise it as your own and it will be close to unnoticeable.
He walks for a good five minutes, ignoring the car and attracting stares, until a man approaches him and offers to help him into the car. John shrugs him off and gets in the car, making sure to slam the door hard behind him. Mycroft is sitting opposite him, looking as smarmy as ever, in a three-piece pinstripe suit.
His brain comes back online to their harsh panting, the soft whimpers that escape him as John slows his strokes. His arms feel too heavy to move, but he still wraps them around John’s back, and they both lie there, solid and heavy, catching their breath.
John abruptly spins around, every line of his body simultaneously drawing towards and pulling away from Sherlock. Sherlock smirks. This is John’s body saying
Everything packed, they head to King’s Cross. At the ticket window, John buys two tickets up to Scotland, to his father’s home town. The train leaves in an hour. Sherlock frowns as he pays by card. Is he an idiot? This isn’t under the radar.
John drives. As much as he can he avoids the main roads around London, sticking to B-roads, although it’s highly unlikely that anyone will know they’re in this car.
His watch face has been smashed, but he can still make out the time: midnight. That means that he’s been tied up in this basement for almost two hours. John must be looking for him by now. They haven’t been flatmates for long, but John killed a man to protect him within a day of them meeting, so Sherlock is quite sure that he’ll be on his way. Unless he found the pigs’ trotters soaking in hydrochloric acid in the fridge. If that’s the case, he might well be holding a grudge and refusing to look for Sherlock.
John can see that these techniques are getting them nowhere without Sherlock’s genius for connecting the details. Even Mycroft’s power won’t help things progress any quicker. It seems like they’ll just have to wait for the kidnappers to reveal their hand or slip up. Unless…
Sherlock's hips roll slowly and settle into a pace that’s like oozing through honey. It feels gorgeous, just enough to send shivers sparking up John's spine, but not so much that it feels like a frantic, hurried mess. John's fingertips flex with each roll, tighten and press into Sherlock's skin. His own hips work in tandem, muscles flexing as he rocks up to meet Sherlock halfway.
John’s mouth is a joy. He’s melting, can still feel John inside him, limp now, but closer than they’ve ever been. He sighs softly, a very un-Sherlock noise that John somehow draws out of him, and pulls away from the kiss.
He comes to stand with John in the doorway, pulling his dressing gown tighter around himself. “What are we doing today?”
It works for a split second, then Sherlock flicks over again. His human side has control now. John huffs and rolls out from under him.
Mycroft hesitates for the minutest of seconds before replying. Surprised (and he’s so rarely surprised). “Very perceptive of you, Doctor.”
John works his fingers gently through Sherlock’s hair, stroking and soothing. He keeps it up until he feels Sherlock relax minutely, at least ten minutes later. The only sounds in the room are the soft ticking of the clock and their breathing mixing — John’s steady, and Sherlock’s tense and carefully controlled, pain management.
John takes the tube from Sherlock and flips it open. “Well. These fingers may be shorter than yours, but they find exactly what they need to.”
Sherlock's eyes are closed, and he has that little pinch of concentration around them. His mouth is hanging open and gasping for breath, his cheeks are flushed a beautiful shade of pink which is spreading down his neck and chest.
“Did you ever think of going into music?” John asks. “Before you came up with the job of consulting detective, I mean.”
When the doors open and the doctor comes out to talk to them, Sherlock is in there before he can utter a word. The doctor looks scandalised and rushes after him to herd him out, but Lestrade flashes his police badge for Sherlock for the first time ever and procedure is probably broken but he's allowed to stay.
Sherlock ignores him in favour of deducing more passersby. John doesn’t mind. He enjoys watching Sherlock deduce people’s backgrounds and occasionally their life stories. Sherlock’s abilities will never cease to be fascinating to him.
Things are not better. Or they are, but they aren’t. They arrive at Baker Street with the dusk, in the early evening, and go up to the flat to find Mycroft waiting for them, looking as pompous as ever and as if he has every right to be there. Sherlock scowls at him and goes straight through to his bedroom with his things. He hears Mycroft congratulate John on evading him. He hears John saying it was easy. This will come around to the topic of Weres shortly. Maybe his presence will be necessary. Reluctantly he leaves his room.
Sherlock lies on the sofa later, hands steepled, eyes closed, processing. He’s already decided that he likes kissing a lot. He’s decided that he likes wet, naked kissing in the shower even more. As long as it’s with John, that is. He knows a lot of people, but he can’t think of anyone he’d want to do this with except John. And sex with John feels so much better than when he gets off by himself; the pleasure so much more sharp and focused, everything more electric. His fantasies didn’t even come close. He wants more of this every day, multiple times a day, even. Given John’s reputation, Sherlock thinks he’ll be willing.
In short moments they’re lying in bed, snogging. Sherlock’s hands slide over John’s body, John’s cock pushes insistently against Sherlock’s belly. He breaks from John’s lips and kisses down his neck.
Sherlock’s laugh morphs into a groan as John’s hand curls around his cock. God, with pleasuring John he’d barely realised how hard he was. His hands drift, skating down John’s spine and ghosting over the curve of his arse, bumping up rib after rib and trailing along collarbones. He wants to touch everywhere. John’s hand is making it very hard to think.
