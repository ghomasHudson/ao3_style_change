Castiel takes a breath, something he doesn’t have to do anymore but had gotten used to tying his emotions to.
He stands with his hands in his pockets, looking out the window. Everything looks alright. He thinks Samandriel built this one. It was good work. He should let him know the next time he sees him.
“I’m not sure I do either, to be honest with you.” He can hear the twittering of birds from the trees behind them. “But I’m here. And you’re here. So we may as well figure out what to do with ourselves.”
“Yeah,” Dean manages, sounding a little hoarse. “Yeah, you look good, Cas.”
“No. It was nice.” Dean finally looked up to see Cas looking a little amused, eyes wet. “Take the compliment, Dean.”
goes unsaid and it warms Castiel a little bit. “Go ahead and drive, Jack.”
Course he doesn’t freak out. Why would he freak out? Just cause he’d googled every flower Cas ever gave him and almost all of them equated to some lovey dovey touchy feely crap isn’t something to freak out over.
Castiel immediately tosses it in one of the trash cans they pass as they walk along the sidewalk of the city. “Excellent.”
Jack beams. “Ooh, sprinkles!”
“Your strawberry’s melting,” Jack says, already near finished with his.
in his hands. It’s tan, with four pockets, two on each side of the jacket. “Give me the one you’re wearing now.”
Castiel blinks from where he’s standing, hands in pockets, as he watches Charlie play
Dean.”
Charlie curses as she makes a mistake. It’s something Castiel truly admires about humanity: many of them get to paradise and insist on getting some things wrong sometimes because otherwise it’s not fun anymore.
“Did you fall down some stairs?”
Dean shrugs as Charlie starts hollering that she’ll arm wrestle him for it as Kevin loudly says Garth could take her, something Garth seems to think is sweet. “Nah. Seems like they’ll figure it out.”
The world grinds to a halt.
“Physically or emotionally?”
Sam and Eileen each give him a hug, and then he steps into the rip.
“I’m trying,” he says instead. “Sucks.”
“Cas,” he says, steeling himself a little bit. “If this is bumming you out, you don’t have to keep doing it. I don’t want you to-“
Dean looks at Castiel. “We should have come up with a better team name.”
“What gives?” she demands.
Dean gapes and then grins. “I like it when you’re competitive on my side.”
“It’s cause she’s no fun.”
Claire stares at him for another moment and then stands. She rushes to him and he’s half expecting her to hit him when instead she collides with him in a hug. A little startled, he wraps his arms around her.
Castiel thinks about how he once told Sam and Dean that he was always happy to bleed for the Winchesters, and how Jack had considered himself so proud to be one. Years will pass, and some of the big things will change, and some of the big things will stay the same.
sequel trilogy next, he’s already seen
“Yeah?” Dean had been a little wrong footed the first time Jack answered with something like that. But Jack’s been to visit him enough in the past year that he’s able to roll with it better. “Sounds good. Do anything fun?”
to be humanlike, you know,” Meg points out.
“I mean like… eventually.”
“I brought you pie,” Jack tells him as they head through the door. Dean brightens.
“You’re looking at me,” Cas says without looking up from the newspaper.
He smacks her hand away. “You wanna come in or not?”
“No.” Castiel pushes himself off the porch. “Show me.”
“Somewhat.” It hadn’t been nearly as enjoyable doing it on his own when he’d been away from the Bunker, but perhaps that had been because it was an activity he didn’t enjoy doing on his own as much as he had with Dean.
Cause the options are
“I’m thinking about how people… fear it. Because the lightning comes after. But it’s not really about the lightning. The ground becomes softer than it was before, the lakes fill. Flowers bloom. Thunder isn’t about lightning or rain. It’s about change.” He looks over at Jack. “People don’t like change, Jack.”
Dean blows a raspberry but leaves the best fries alone to take simply one of the better ones.
“She says we’re gonna have her over for dinner when I get you back,” Dean says as he cleans up the dishes after Rowena leaves. “She didn’t ask. Never asks. But, well, I like her, you know? Now that the stakes are lower. I like having her for dinner. Even when she’s giving me shit.” He puts the detergent into the dishwasher and closes it up. “I, uh. I got an idea, Cas. It’s not… it’s a rough idea. And I don’t even know if it’ll work. But I’ve been looking over my notebooks, you know, instead of the books I’ve got, just looking at my notes and, well. It’s an idea. No decisions yet. But I think… I think I’m gonna try it. And I’m hopeful that it’ll work.” Dean steps away from the dishwasher. “So, y’know. Get ready.”
"What about your girlfriend?" Charlie asked him. "What's she going to do?"
"Ellen married my boss, Bobby. She kind of adopted Sammy and I when things got hard a few years back." Dean explained. "I spent a bit of time working her bar for her too."
He offered her his hand, watching her flush in surprise as she took it, allowing her hand to rest on top as they shook. He dropped her hand gently and went back to his table where the slime-ball was watching with a condescending grin. Just look at him made Castiels skin crawl. He turned his attention quickly back to their experiment, hoping this lesson would end soon.
"Absolutely!" Dean laughed.
Deans body shook with a quite chuckle. "Good. I know this isn't normal friend behaviour, but I think the soulmate thing gives us some flexibility."
"Definitely."
Dean smiled in relief. "That's not a problem Cas, as long as you tell me if you're uncomfortable okay. Even if it's with Charlie jumping on you, I can call her off if you need me to."
Benny slid his hands into his pockets with a sigh, shifting his weight from foot to foot. "Nothing to bad... I'm just not that good with all the people and drama, it gets a bit much at times. Dean does better with all that. This is just about taking some time to get away from it and clear my head, you know?"
“Yeah. Probably. Where are you?”
“I like it messy.”
“Jesus, Cas,” he manages. “Give a guy some warning.”
Dean turns off the lamp by his bedside and settles in to sleep.
“I wouldn’t blame you.”
“There’s not going to be any-“ Castiel feels the impulse to pull on the reins very quickly. “There’s not going to be any Queer Eyeing, Jack, I just want new clothes.”
It’s easy to speak when you don’t know if anybody’s listening. It’s easy to vent like that. Castiel had suspected, when he’d had the energy to suspect, that Dean did that sometimes, that talking to him was more out of a need to talk than a need to talk to him. He’s going to have to let him know it’s all right if he didn’t mean it. Let him know that he can keep his feelings to himself, find a place on his own, nearby, if Dean wants, and it will be fine.
“Are you sure you haven’t fallen down some stairs?”
“I mean, uh,
“And my dog isn’t fancy.”
Dean blinks.
“So are you dead or dying or something?”
They don’t talk about the flowers again.
“You seem… more okay.” Cas watches Scrapper leave. “I’m glad.”
She swallows, looking down at her lap, grin fading.
Castiel makes a noncommittal noise, more than ready to stand over Jack’s shoulder and glower if that’s what it comes to.
“Are you hungry?”
“I like Meg,” he says when Castiel sits on the swing next to him. “She’s mean but she’s funny.”
“You should… probably ask them about the aunt thing before you refer to them as such.”
He tries for “hello” but only gets to “mm?”
“Kid’s up to something,” Dean says abruptly.
“You can ask me anything you want."
Didn’t you notice that when you two met he wanted to fuck every girl he met and that went away after he knew you for a couple years?”
“No problem.”
“Well, in my experience with the angels I’ve known that have rebelled, it’s probably an even stronger sign you’re doing well.”
“Worry about what?”
“The wall’s not there anymore,” Jack whispers, fascinated. “I just-“ he makes the same motion with his hand. “Like that?”
beat me at bowling.”
“Correlation does not equate causation.”
to chew with your mouth open?”
“Yes.”
“Oooh, they have soft pretzels.” Jack perks up as he and Sam come down the stairs into the alley. “I could go for a soft pretzel. I promise I will not use anything other than my already natural abilities on this game.”
“That’s a good idea.” Castiel rests a hand on his shoulder. “I don’t blame you. I don’t think it’s your fault. And I love you.”
The sun is bright. It’s bright in a way he hasn’t seen in a while and he squeezes his eyes shut. His heart is pounding for the first time in a while. His lungs are going. He can feel the sun on his skin. It’s disorienting. He lets himself adjust slowly and when he feels capable, he opens his eyes again.
and I want to
Dean tosses his dishrag under the bar and glances up. He does a double take that would almost be comical if Castiel’s palms weren’t a little sweaty.
Castiel paces. He thinks. He wonders how best to do this, and in the end, he decides on the simplest option.
“Maybe he will.”
“Yeah.” He closes up the dishwasher and presses the button on it. “I figured.”
“I asked Jack to bring you both back.” Claire tugs the tablecloth around her a little more firmly. “But it was a prayer sort of… couched in me screaming into the woods. So maybe he didn’t hear it.”
“Eileen’ll be along soon.” Castiel takes a bite of his hot dog and grimaces. Sam had wanted them and he thought he would try them but he never liked them very much on Earth and he doesn’t really like them now, either. “Time is different here.”
“Terrific.” She straightens from the pinball machine and turns to Castiel. “So the two of you can do that together instead of me having to do it.”
Sam grins. “Well, we all say things.”
“I don’t know everything.” Castiel stands and offers Jack a hand to help him up. “But hopefully I know enough.”
Castiel bristles. “I’m not
“I’m just saying, whatever grand rejection you’re expecting, you’re not gonna get it. Even if you two never ever
“I’d win cause I would just
Lose his mind. “Figure something else out.” Dean turns to Jack. “What do you think?”
Dean stands in the living room, a little at a loss as Sam heads over to the dining room table.
Castiel slowly walks over the bench properly and sits down heavily on it, eyes unfocused as he listens to Sam’s voice, clear as day.
like John Winchester. As far as Castiel is concerned, John is here mostly on a technicality. But Dean and Sam will arrive one day, and when they see him (
“You could always hang out here, if you want.” Dean glances at him before he seems to make himself keep the gaze on Castiel. “I would like you to hang out here. I’ve, uh. I’ve missed you.”
“I have trouble picturing you eating anything but burgers.”
Dean looks startled, and then grins at him. Castiel feels his lips twitch in an answering smile, and they sit there looking at each other for a second before he looks outside the window.
much.”
“That’s fine.”
Castiel frowns. “Seems unfair.”
“Yes. You and Sam sat here on the bench while Sam heckled Dean.” Jack holds out a strawberry ice cream to Castiel. “I think you enjoyed yourself.”
Castiel blinks, startled. “Dean?”
“Well. I’m glad you ate, at least.” Dean considers. “And I’m glad Jack kept your truck.”
Maybe he didn’t mean it.
and he gave me some shit about how I didn’t understand the art but then he let it go.”
“No.” Cas picks the keys off the little hook on the wall Dean puts them on as Dean grabs his wallet. “I won’t mind at all.”
Cas pulls back and Dean grins at him. Cas smiles a little weakly and leans forwards. His forehead bumps up against Dean’s and Dean just rests it there, sliding his hand to the back of his neck and closing his eyes.
Charlie grins. “Dean said yes immediately and he’s
“The tire changing exercise was helpful.” Cas drops his duffle bag as well. “Especially since I will be continuing to use my truck.”
Dean grins. “No problem.” He puts the black corduroy jacket on a nearby table where it promptly vanishes. “You know what I say, every twelve years it’s time to change what I wear.”
“What, you named your dog with a people name?”
“I wander.” Jack smiles. “I do a lot of work remaking Heaven. It should be a proper Heaven. The kind where you can go anywhere you want. But when I want a break, I wander. And I come to see Sam and Eileen and Dean.”
“It’s Sprite! Tastes like fruit.”
“Yeah. Me, too.” Not
“I wish Sam hadn’t told you that!” Dean calls, and Castiel smiles a very little smile.
“Oh, I, uh, had a couple spots. One was when Sam and Dean and I were in Moondor and it was just… nice, you know? I mean, scary. But the other was, uh. One time when I came to see Dean and Sam, Sam was out on a job and he didn’t get back until late, so it was just Dean and I and we… had a really nice day. We hung out in the Bunker, we made cookies, we, uh, we danced around to
Castiel feels his lips twitch up. “Well. If you insist.”
“I don’t know,” he mumbles. “I do trust you.” It’s true, but he’s still apprehensive.
“I will get a grilled skirt steak with eggs,” he says finally. “And a mimosa.”
“What?”
“I liked the Grand Canyon.” Jack accepts the glass of water that Dean slides his way. “And there is something about the simple grandeur of Antarctica.”
“It’s not your fault. But I know.” They release each other and Mary looks around. “So, tearing down the walls, huh?” She grins at his expression. “Jack stopped by before you did. He had some apologies of his own he wanted to make.”
Sam looks about the same as he did when he last saw him, hands shoved in the pockets of his flannel as he grins at Castiel, a little sheepishly.
trying to Parent Trap us.”
“Yes. I know.” Cas stood and pulled Dean up with him. He was about to groan about how fast he pulled him up when Cas lightly tugged him forwards and kissed him, which is about the only thing that would have made Dean let go of his hand. “It’s only wise to take at least
cleaner than it was when we went here.”
It’s beautiful, Castiel thinks, to see Dean marvel at the everyday realities of heaven. It suddenly occurs to him for the first time that this may be how Dean felt watching him adjust to Earth. He wonders if that would explain the amused softness he thought he’d caught glimpses of every now and again.
“I’m sorry,” he whispers again.
“I… don’t remember any of my time in the Empty.” Castiel rests his hands by his sides, trying not to fidget. Fidgeting is not one of his favorite human habits that he’s picked up. He feels that it’s telling. “None of us do. Jack offered each of us to restore it but I believe we… all thought this was best. And then…” He shrugs. “Then I was working. And I wasn’t quite… okay, but I was working.”
“I had a certain aptitude.” He thinks about pointing out that it doesn’t mean he’d beat Dean because he doesn’t know what
Jack is standing on the opposite side of the road by his truck, watching him.
“I’ll get whatever it is you get.”
“Do you know if he’s okay?”
They sit in silence.
“Do I gotta water this one?”
“Help you what?”
It is… an uncomfortably apt comparison, at its bones. Castiel sits down. “It’s not that easy.”
“Leaning on the table in air hockey would mean that it would come
Sam rolls his eyes. “Yes.”
“Don’t worry about it,” Meg answers.
“I’m thinking about thunder,” Cas answers.
“I called Dean while you were looking for things because I forgot my jacket at his house,” he tells Castiel cheerfully. “I like that look on you! You look-“ Jack waves a hand vaguely. “I dunno, like you’re more… at home… in your skin?”
“I’m keeping your Grace. That’s mine now. You know, I think I’ve earned it.” It raises its hand. “Goodbye, Clarence. And it had better be forever. I was promised.”
“You talking to me or you talking to the dog?”
“Maybe everybody’s got thoughts because one of you needs to take a step.” Sam licks a bit of mustard off his thumb. “Look, I’m not saying Dean isn’t also being an idiot, but he’s not listening to me when I tell him to talk to you, so I have to give you a shot. And by the way,” he adds. “He’s being an idiot for the
“Okay,” he manages. “Cool.”
Charlie gives him the same look Sam had given him when he’d picked Scrapper out last year and said the same thing, sitting on the ground with the puppy and lifting his paws like he was a boxer. “Maybe his business is being called Scraps.”
“Yeah. I’m pretty happy with it.”
Dean and Castiel stare at each other, a pair of deer caught in the headlights.
“I’m sorry that you have to do this. Any of this. But remember that you don’t have to do it alone.”
Dean’s got a room for him.
when he had his vinyl player going. It was… one of the best days of my life.” She shrugs awkwardly, looking down at her chocolate milkshake. “I never really had a family before I met the Winchesters.”
“Yes, soon. But I’ll come back here someday.” Castiel looks around. “We’re rebuilding Heaven but we’re short on angels. Might make us sloppy. I thought it might be good to have someone patrol Heaven for a little while. See if we’d left any bits of the walls up or accidentally left some holes. You have an eye for detail, if I remember correctly.”
It’s dizzying how black the void is. He glances behind him to see the shimmer and notices a thin gold thread extending from it. When he follows it, he sees that thread wrapped around his waist.
Castiel hands the black corduroy jacket over and tugs on the one Dean’s offering.
Dean swallowed. “Okay.”
“Hey, kid,” he says, turning as Jack walks up towards the house, holding a small square box in his hand. “Been a while. You wanna be the one to hang up the birdhouse?”
“Are these poisonous?” He shakes them at her. “I’m gonna remind you that if you kill me that’s gonna put a real damper on brunch dates or whatever it is you do with Sammy.”
Dean hopes the eyeroll translates down the phone. “Yes, Sam, I want to learn how to cook. Did I judge you when you said you wanted to learn how to be like, uh, the, uh, the old woman from that baking show?” He hadn’t, as a matter of fact, and had bought all the cookbooks with her name on it he could find for Christmas and sent it to Sam’s house. “I liked cooking at the Bunker. So I want to learn how to do things other than burgers and steak.”
“What?”
“And you’ve got the windows because you like-“
, Castiel thinks, a thought too painful to dwell on for too long) they will no doubt want him to be polite. So he will be polite.
he signs and she laughs.
Claire swallows and nods. “Thanks,” she whispers.
“We want people to build their own Heavens.” Castiel looks around. “Give them their own space.”
Dean grins as they step off the porch. “I’m gonna have to do the initial call cause otherwise Sam’s gonna get a call from my phone and you’re gonna answer and it’s gonna freak him the fuck out.”
“What are you giving me shit for, then?”
And it’s that easy
Hell, even if it wasn’t too late to back out now, he wouldn’t want to.
Jack smiles. “There’s someone you want to see. You can tear the wall down there. Let me know who it is you want and I’ll… say goodbye for now.”
“Don’t worry about it, kid, just go slower.”
Dean looks curious. “Can you even smite people up here?”
“It’s fine.” Jack slows down a little. “I could straighten the road out from here, if you wanted.”
“Yeah, I know you like them.”
on how it’s a Disney property now
Castiel throws the bone from the one he snuck from Dean in the trash. “Agreed.”
“Hang on.” Dean looks up as he stands in the middle of the room. “Jack! I know you can hear me! Family meeting!”
, we came back to each other. We figured it out. So you’re gonna come back. You’re gonna come back, Cas, so help me god, and we’re gonna figure it out. And I would have said yes. If you’d asked, I would have said yes.”
Sam and Eileen go out to walk the dogs in the woods the next day, Sam bitching about doing Dean’s chores for him, and it means that Dean spends the morning gathering up all his notebooks, including Sam’s notepad from last night, and reads them all as carefully as possible. They all say more or less the same thing.
He rests the bag on the floor when he sees that the comforter isn’t pulled up all the way. He gently tugs it up so it’s resting comfortably over Cas. “Don’t want you to get cold,” he mumbles before he carefully lifts his purchase out of the bag.
“I don’t think you should worry about it,” he says.
“Yes. My father has had a long day.” Jack helps orient the plates close to Castiel. “Thank you for your assistance.” The waiter leaves and Jack smiles at Castiel. “I really like tipping. I figure a lot is better than a little, they seem to have real joy when it’s a lot.”
“I’m gonna sit down and get some food. Do you eat?”
“Yeah,” he says. “Me, too.” He stands up and Castiel follows him in the motion. “I feel like dessert. You got any bright ideas?”
He takes another hit to his chest and Jack flinches, and he knows he feels it, too.
“I’m not
“No.” Dean swallowed, looking up at him, still grinning. “No, I figured I’d be dead by now.”
He wakes up, blearily, to the sound of his phone ringing. He grapples in the sheets for it and peers at it. Sammy
“Lucky things happen.” Jack takes a curve a little fast.
Dean rests the bags down on the floor so he can awkwardly rub the back of his head. “Yeah, well, you know, I just added the closet as soon as we hit the porch, so that’s new, but, uh, I know you like mystery books, even though you figure them out pretty quick, so I thought it’d be good to have those in here. And the table and shelves, you know, you’ve talked before about wanting to learn how to do things with your hands, and I figure whatever you wanted to learn, you’d have a space to do it. And look-“ Dean walks up to the window and gestures outside it. “There’s marigolds in that bed down there, and peonies, chive flowers and some mint, which I thought would be good cause then I could use them to cook with, too, just a whole bunch of flowers, and there’s a chair right by the window near it downstairs, too, so there’s a better view, but from here I figured if you wanted to read a book, you know, you could look down every once in a while and you could see the bees, cause the bees like those. And over here-“ He points at one of the shelves which holds a record player that Castiel had missed on the first look. “I thought you could have that to play your tunes, you know, if you wanted to listen to them while you were reading. I didn’t pick any of the music for you, I know you like your stuff and I’m not the greatest judge of what that is, so.” Dean shoves his hands in his pockets, looking extremely awkward. “I thought it could be good for you to have your own space when you’re around, you know?”
about it, all of it, that I won’t do it and that I want to do it-“ He’s crying harder now. “I can’t save the people I love because it’ll make me into a monster and if I can’t use this power then what’s even the point of
“Thought I’d ask.” She gives an extremely long-suffering look to his beverage. “Orange juice is customary, you know.”
Dean grins at him. “You’d have gotten an answer.”
“You need better fluids.”
He stands on the dock and rolls down his pant legs, socks and shoes appearing on his feet automatically.
“Sam has been very patient with me.”
“Uh-huh.”
“Nope.” Dean takes a couple steps forwards and leans his hands on the bar. “I don’t blame you, Cas.”
Life settles into a routine for Castiel.
This is the kind of peace he’d imagined sometimes back at the Bunker sometimes, he thinks. Sam happy and fulfilled. No one out to kill them. Dean sitting here with his kid, fishing on a clear sunny day. It’s the kind of peace that’s almost perfect, and will be perfect, once he figures it out.
“Is this real?” She shifts a little uncertainly on the chair. “It feels… more real.”
A heavy silence hung in the air. Dean stared with a little determination at his hands, waiting.
“Sure.” Dean tilts his head towards the solid oak door, opened just a crack. “If I give you the grand tour, are you gonna be an asshole and just zap all over the place?”
“Not our fault you’re really just duking it out for second.”
“No. I came to see you cause you’re my friend and I missed you and I wanted you to know about my life.” Castiel finally feels safe to look at Sam, who looks pretty peaceable if still amused. “Bothering you about this is just a perk.”
“Regardless. It means something that you’re trying.”
“What?”
He nods, keeping his eyes on the sky. Castiel thinks it’s easier for him that way. He can’t blame him.
Dean grins down at his lemonade, now empty, simply poking at the ice with his straw. “I told you.”
“Uh-huh, sure, that’s all it was.” Dean pushes himself off the bar. “So what are you gonna do now?”
“Whoa, easy there, kid,” Dean says at the same time Castiel goes “
“I… think he’d like it, anyway.” Dean had been so pleased when they’d found the Bunker that there was a place to put the car, and Castiel thinks it was probably what he’d envisioned a stable home to be like- somewhere where there was a place for your car. “Plenty of space in the garage for tools because even if she won’t need maintenance here it calms him down to do it. Probably a big backyard for people being over. I think… he’d like to have people over.”
you. I
Dean talks to him every single day. Several times a day. And whenever he does, Castiel becomes aware of himself again, aware that he exists, that there is someone out there that cares about him. He listens to every prayer. He listens about Dean’s birdfeeders, about the right couch for the living room, about fishing, about how the town seems to think he’s a little weird but they’re nice, about how he’s gonna bring him back, about how Sam’s bringing him new books and Bobby’s bringing him new books and he keeps taking notes and it’s gonna be fine, and he’s gonna like the cabin, he’s gonna like the lake, he’s gonna like the town, he’s gonna like everything and anything he doesn’t like they’ll fix.
“I’m sorry about the way it ended,” he says quietly.
Jack vanishes and both Dean and Castiel squint at the space where he was.
“You’ve gotten better at saying this stuff,” he says quietly.
have brunch dates.”
“He…” Castiel swallows. “He asks about me?”
Castiel throws his hands up. “Jack-“
“Can’t get out of this conversation
“It’s okay.” Castiel holds him a little tighter. “It’s okay.”
Castiel lets his expression form into a smile now. “I won’t tell.”
“It’s… tempting.”
“I’ve been kicking your ass at everything since we were kids, Sammy.” Dean lines up the roll. “I don’t know why you’d expect now to be any different.”
” She points at him with a fry. “I did my best for you, you know. When Dean first told me about you I suggested you were dreamy based on the way he talked about you and I thought that the fact that I was a lesbian would give him a clue but I didn’t bank on what a dumbass he was.”
did I? I kinda always figured you were humoring me with the original series. But you’d like
Castiel jumps at the shout and turns around from the wall he’s working on, blinking.
But there is a point in the idea that perhaps not having to address it was, as Sam would put it, “a perk”, even if had never occurred to him.
“Not on purpose.” She rolls her eyes at the expression on Castiel’s face. “He comes by to see Charlie and sometimes I’m there.”
“Sam is texting Eileen every single chance he gets,” he says. “Dean has been extensively texting with Charlie and is surreptitiously browsing positions for a mechanic. They’re not okay. But they’re coping better than they were a week ago.”
“You want me to.”
The thing is, Sam is right. And Meg. And Charlie. And Gabriel, who had thought the whole thing was very funny but still pressed the point. And everybody else he’s talked to for the past few months.
Shortly after, Dean hears gentle footsteps padding up towards the table. They’re not as heavy as Sam’s, and they’re muffled slightly, like they’re wearing Cas’s favorite fuzzy socks. The chair next to him is pulled out and they sit together in the quiet.
“It’s very funny that you’re so concerned about this,” Jack says as he closes the door. “I’ve driven before, you know. Why is it so upsetting?”
Meg is standing there, glowering at him, leaning against a cane. Her hair is brown again, and he’s as he remembers her before Crowley had been torturing her, black leather jacket over a purple shirt.
“Scrapper,” Dean says sternly. “Cause he’s a fighter.”
Sam rolls his eyes. “Fine, fuck me for empathizing with you, I guess.”
“She’s pretty great.” Charlie accepts the beer Dean hands her as he sits next to her, spilling a little duck sauce on her plate next to her teriyaki beef. “I like her a lot. We’re gonna move in together.”
“Aw, buck up, Sammy,” Dean tells him. “It’s almost like you’re not happy for us.”
“Yeah. It is.”
marathon. Maybe he’ll go into the garage and work on the Impala while Castiel sits on the porch in one of the chairs and watches the storm come in. Tomorrow can be anything. The day after that and after that and after that will be anything, for the rest of days.
“I’ve been looking and asking.”
Cas looks up at him. “How did you know it was me who gave them to you?”
“No! No, they’re, uh. They’re good. They look good.”
Bobby had mailed him three new books this week and he’s still working through the first one. It’s slow going- Sam had always been the research guy, and he’d had to start learning new languages and new terms and new symbols. But he’s getting better as time goes on, and by now he knows the symbol for “the Empty” in five different languages.
“Hey, Eileen.” Dean gives her a hug. “Good to see you.”
Castiel is proud of him, too. Someday he’s going to tell Dean how proud.
“He’s thinking about opening the Roadhouse back up.” Jack walks up and puts a hand on one of the trees in the park. It changes to the red leaves of fall and he looks at it contemplatively. “Ellen and Jo still don’t want it. Not for a while, anyway. But he likes the idea of being a bartender.”
, and
“S’it really?” He peers at his alarm clock. “Huh.”
Castiel looks back at him. “Never.”
When Castiel lets go of Dean’s shirt and opens his eyes, Dean is a surprising and somewhat endearing shade of pink.
Tracking down the administration had been easy, even with the hoards of students clogging the halls. The receptionist had handed him several sheets outlining his schedule, the school layout and his locker as well as a note for him to hand each of his teachers throughout the day to explain who he was. That seemed unnecessary. He figured it was their way of forcing him to speak with the teachers, instead of simply walking in and sitting down. She asked him politely if he needed her to track down a tour for him, he turned down the offer quickly, he much preferred to find his own way through the school.
"Nobody uses mofo anymore, Kevin."
"Just Sammy."
"The shower sounds like a good idea."
Cas froze as Kevin came out of the bathroom. He wasn't even aware that anyone was awake. Kevin didn't flinch at seeing them tangled together on the bed. Instead, he took a seat on the desk chair at the side of the room, looking at him curiously.
Charlie and Kevin had fallen asleep early, curled up on the mattress on the floor, leaving Cas and Dean to watch the end of 'Game of shadows' on their own.
"I think if you cared for me, you would do everything you could to get rid of that writing!"
Meg laughed into her coffee cup. "Whatever are you referring to Castiel?" She asked, her voice dripping with sarcasm.
"There was a cute guy at the bar earlier, haven't seen him around have you?" Cas responded with a smirk. Turning around to face Dean front on.
"Not like this."
"These guys are from Madison Preparatory Academy, a very bid deal in these competitions, and these guys just knocked them out of the finals."
"Then we're out of options." Cas said holding the coffee out to Dean, who stepped in front of him slowly wrapping his hands around the mug.
"Sorry Ellen." Dean shrunk down slightly. "You already know I'm okay though. Bobby would tell you if I wasn't" he defended.
Cas looked up to find Jo, arms crossed, staring at him silently. "Shit." He said scrubbing a hand over his face. "I'm sorry, Jo. I met some friends in English and I completely forgot."
The morning moved too quickly, as he found himself walking through the halls to English, far too soon. Mr B, their debate instructor, was their English teacher. The moment Dean walked through the door, he directed him to sit at the front of the room with Charlie and Kevin, so they could discuss the debate in class. Charlie beamed at him while Kevin cast a look at the back of the room where Lisa had her arms crossed as she pouted. Yeah this was going to go well.
Dean liked the idea of having something of Cass on him at all times and he liked the idea of Cas wearing something of his even more. He ran the back of his hand along Cass beside him, linking their fingers without comment. "No problem."
"Every-thing okay?" Dean asked carefully.
Cas found his phone afterward, still in the pocket of his jeans, and was pleased to find only two text messages from his brother that morning rather than the continuous missed calls he had gotten yesterday. He shot off a quick reply stating that, yes, he was alive and, yes, he would be at practice later. While he was checking his phone, Dean had gone through and emptied the rest of his pockets, planning to throw their clothes in the machine straight away.
"Can I send a few of these to myself? I didn't think to take photos."
The guy blinked at him slowly, the cocky smirk slipping from his face, as Charles eyed the symbol on his jacket. "You're from Madison Prep! That's why you look familiar!"
Even Bobby was impressed. He had expected that Dean having his untrained soulmate in the shop with him, would cause him to be distracted or take three times longer to get the work done. But Cas had helped to speed things up, providing Dean with a second pair of hands and not hesitating to pitch in. All his questions and Deans explanations were made as they worked, putting a smile on Deans face and getting them through more work than Bobby had anticipated.
"Unfortunately for you, they won't let us on stage if your not dressed appropriately." The Asian boy stated, buttoning up his shirt.
"Oh, screw her." Dean walked away pacing up and down the kitchen. "This isn't right Cas. If there's no one here than you should be at our place."
"Yep. Looks like you're with me again."
"Who taught you to dance?" Cas asked curiously.
"You got something to say, new kid?"
Cas on the other hand walked into the shed to be greeted by his brother yelling 'Walk of Shame' to the group, causing everyone to stop what they were doing and stare at him. He could hear Kevin to the side asking Meg what a walk of shame was as she laughed. Balthazar actually dropped the phone in his hands with a 'Holy Shit!'. Thinking it was best to get his friends comments over with, Cas pulled of the aviators and gave an exaggerated bow to the group. The silence was replaced by roars of laughter and a bombardment of questions.
"She wasn't please that I didn't tell him to fuck off the moment I met him." Dean rolled his eyes. "And this was in front of the entire class mind you. She told me I should have done everything in my power not to meet my soulmate."
First day of the quarter meant that Mr B spent the lesson introducing their new topic. Shakespeare. Something Cas was more than familiar with already. Madison had liked to inject Shakespeare into as much of their curriculum as possible. Out of sheer boredom, Cas and his friends had made it their mission to dig up as much 'off the record' knowledge of the man as they could find. Every gay lover and subtle insult that had been published in his works. As their small defiance against the religious teachings of their school.
"No! That's bullshit!" He announced stalking out of the shed.
Cas shook his head, checking his phone to confirm, the stress creeping back into his features. It looked like his mother was sticking to her usual script. He was the only kid left in the house and he had no doubt that he would be the last kid to find out what was going on. Dean threw an arm around his shoulders, pulling him into his side, to speak softly into his ear.
Cas rubbed the back of his neck as he answered. "We didn't win Gabe. They threw us a complete curveball honestly."
"I'm Castiel." He introduced himself as he buttoned up his shirt again.
"He's a smart kid, but troubled you know. We've tried to help him, but nothing seemed to work. Not until he met Castiel." she couldn't hide the tinge of resentment. "I don't know why, but that boy got Ash out of the pit he had buried himself in and back on his feet. It was more than I could ever do."
“Are you saying I need to get up?” Dean whined softly nuzzling his neck.
"Yeah. Umm... Officially he has been in my care since I was 18."  Dean said, with a sideways glance at him.
"Do me a favour and don't tell anyone about that ok?" he said quietly, running his hands over Deans hips and making his heart race.
"Sounds like he's your soulmate Charlie!" Lisa called, sarcastically.
All three came back with a combination of 'Yes', 'Please' and 'Praise coffee', that had Cas laughing as he stepped carefully over the bodies at the end of his bed and headed for the door.
Cas laughed as she glared at him with her hands on her hips.
"You hang around long enough and you'll find out more about my life than you ever wanted to know."
Cas had expected them to present an argument for soulmate completing each other. The need to find your other half to experience something greater than the ordinary. He hadn't expected this. The smirk on Deans face told him that he knew they wouldn't consider that angle. For the first time on stage, Castiel hesitated. Taking a moment to consider the arguments before him before he started his own. His focus had been on presenting the many cases of people who had taken the words on their skin and changed their lives to try and force the meeting with their soulmate, looking at the reverberating damage these actions had caused to peoples lives. But standing there, seeing the flash of concern across Deans face, had him adjusting his argument.
"Hate to tell you, but you will always be a rich kid to us." He argued as Bobby stopped outside his door, tapping the frame gently to get their attention. "That's just how things work with us lowly public-school kids."
"Well in that case... We stepped out for coffee, but Cass has ducked into the bathroom and may or may not be throwing it back up. I'll know when he comes out."
Cas cupped his face gently in his hand, running his thumb experimentally along the edge of his lower lip before responding. "I'm more grateful that you're my soulmate with each and every day."
"Yes I have jeans. .Does it matter if they're ripped?"
"Hey!" The girl, Charles, pointed at him, gaining his attention. "Do I know you?"
"Cas this is Ellen... Ellen this is Castiel."
"Still do. As you saw, he's a bit protective still."
Dean chuckled, averting his eyes as the heat rushed to his face. "Not right now."
"Pretty much." Dean said looking at his phone as it started buzzing, signaling message after message coming through in quick succession. "Charlie's sending me photos from last night."
Both Dean and Cas watched as he walked away cursing.
"I thought we were done with that?" Dean asked, scooping his up his bag and joining the others at the front of the room, while Lisa and his friends demanded to know what he was doing.
"Me or the food?" Dean smiled.
"Yes!"
"Show him."
With that Balthazar threw his hands in the air and walked off down the street. Cursing his very existence. It always amused him that people always assumed that partying and drugs were somehow connected to making good music. More often than not, that's what made bands fall apart rather than built them up.
"Really? And what do you do to clear your head?" Benny asked.
Cas stared at him in utter confusion, tilting his head to the side slightly, as if it would help him see things clearly. "Dean," he said slowly, "are you jealous?"
"Unfortunately Private schools don't always lose well. Charlie, did you want to give us your highlights of the night."
"Where the hell have you been boy?" She demanded, straightening up with her hands on her hips. "What do I have to do to get a damned phone call?"
"You're welcome to anything in there." Cas answered, dropping across the bed next to Dean. "Have you decided where you're sleeping?"
Cas dropped his hands and looked at Dean as he came to a stand still within reach of Balthazar, fresh coffee cup in hand, as he looked at the group. He had lost the school jacket and now wore the formal shirt untucked with the tie and Cass cufflinks still in place. Cas could see his friends staring at him from the corner of his eyes.
It took Benny some convincing to pull Dean away from the bar and into the Pool Hall on the other side. Benny had even had to ask the question he never thought would leave his mouth, 'Dean, are you his groupie or his boyfriend?', which led to Dean lamenting over the fact that he wasn't either. He did manage to get one game out of him before the music switched to the techno favoured by the DJ, signalling Perditions intermission.
"So, you know him well?" Dean eyed him carefully.
"- have you figured out a way to do both?"
Castiel turned to look at Gabe who was leaning against his car staring straight at them. Probably waiting for Cas to come to his senses and come back. "Brother" he stated turning back to Dean. "For the record, there is no boyfriend. Or girlfriend for that matter.
He wore his heart on his sleeve and his emotions openly across his face. His poker face was non existent. While Cas sat calmly, the picture of an innocent student, Dean struggled to contain his laughter. With every quiet comment that fell from Castiels lips, Deans control broke at little more until he dropped his head on the desk laughing breathlessly.
Dean looked at him shocked.
"They were running a two for one special." Dean heard Cas answer smartly. "Get one soulmate and get a little brother free!"
"Why do I get the feeling I'm being blackmailed here?"
"Are you ready to go Cassy?" Balth asked as he gathered his things.
"I'm not going to pass up the opportunity to get to know him. Just like I'm not going to stop being friends with these guys. And you don't get to decide that for me!" Dean growled, ending the conversation as he turned his back on her again.
Castiel found his eyes drawn to Dean throughout their final set. He was surprised to find that he and his friend remained at the bar chatting away as they watched the band. Stereotypical maybe, but they seemed the type that would be more comfortable at the pool tables where Meg liked to make her fun. But they remained at the bar. Cas wasn't usually one for flirting with strangers in bars, but he was surprised to find how difficult it was to shake of the attraction to this guy. They knew nothing about each other. Yet he was hoping he'd get a chance to change that.
"Yeah. We're good."
"Only minor?" Kevin raised a brow.
"That's an idea. I'm always happy to host new people." Balth agreed. "Cassy?"
Castiel left him there in search of the coffee van he had spotted at the back of the building earlier. Weaving his way through the crowds of different school groups, each surrounded by staff and parents, he made his way out back. He wasn't the only one in search of caffeine. There were five people lined up at the van in front of him and multiple teens from various schools scattered around the parking lot, coffee already in hand. A group leaning against the wall at the side of the lot caught his attention, with group pushing each other playfully and cursing loudly. He assumed they were one of the teams, with their blazers sitting in a pile beside them, though it was hard to be sure. The short red-headed female was the only one wearing a formal shirt and dress pants. The others were in jeans and tee-shirts. One had a button up shirt worn loosely over the top of his band tee, another was wearing a leather jacket over a tight fitting white shirt.
"I have a shed, Cas." Dean explained with a pointed look. "Obviously you live close enough to go to the same school, that means you're close enough to bring your stuff to my place and play there. Bobby won't mind and Sam will love having you around more."
"You have spares?" Dean asked, watching him curiously.
"I think if you two want to lick your wounds, you can keep me out of it!" Cas glared at them before adding to Daniel. "They knocked us out in the semi's, Balth has been sulking about it all week."
Dean sensing the moment was over, headed inside to start cleaning. Ash was still on the counter, not looking too concerned about moving just yet, while Cas stood beside him scrubbing his hands down in the sink.
Dean cursed under his breath, dropping his head on Cass shoulder and wrapping him in an embrace.
He danced his finger lightly over Deans back as he thought about what Kevin had said. Dean shows up with a new piece of jewellery and his girlfriend decides to claim credit behind his back. There had to be issues with some-one who thought that would be a good idea, especially when he knew Dean hadn't spent any time with her last weekend. They had been together the whole time, since the debate Friday night, surely his friends would realise that. His hand stilled as Dean stirred, looking up at him groggily, the smile on his face when he looked at Cas couldn't be faked.
"Got it. Now get in would you!"
"Why?"
"Yes!" Cas answered. "Who are you facing first?"
Benny laughed quietly, looking across the water. "So what's the truth? Are you two together?"
"Why are you telling me this?" Cas asked quietly, trying not to wake Dean up.
Dean crawled over him, hovering his body above Cass and sinking them into a deep kiss. Every time that they talked Dean discovered things about him that both confused and delighted him. He would never have pictured him as a nerd, hell he couldn't picture Cas in school at all. He seemed more like the type to skip class and pick fights with guys twice the size of him just for the hell of it. Not the type to sit in class actually taking notes. It wasn't a bad thing. Dean tried to picture it but all he came up with was Cas laughing maniacally as some-thing explodes in the chem lab. He could picture that without any problems.
It was midnight by the time they dropped Charlie and Kevin home. Dean had fallen silent as they drove and Cas had grown worried by the time Charlie was out of sight, with the car sitting at idle in front of her house.
The Moderator introduced the subject, Universal Healthcare, with Deans side being For and Daniels side being Against. He wondered whether they had chosen sides based on the school’s socio-economic backgrounds. Each side would naturally relate to their own arguments in this one, so it was going to be interesting to watch. Daniels side opened the debate. It was clear within the first few minutes that they were sticking with the 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it argument'. Charlie was keeping to his advice, focusing her attention on the crowd and the panel highlighting the ways in which the health system failed, not only the lower class with inadequate health insurance, but all levels of society by relying on private businesses to decide who gets covered for what.
"If it gets bad, I'll go Cassy. But I'm not there yet." Ash said dragging a chair over from a nearby table and sitting down. "Give me a chance to get on top of it here."
"That's Dean." Benny said simply, taking a pull on his beer to hide his grin.
"That's better than option one..."
Ellen studied him for a moment before placing the books and loose papers into a neat pile and sliding them to the side. "What about Ash."
Dean stared after them, contemplating what Ellen had said. Cas had saved him. Kept him straight when no-one else could. He had never met some-one that Ellen couldn't straighten out and her defeated tone surprised him.
"Dump Hannah, ride your soulmate." Dean read between laughs. "If you don't want him, feel free to send him to me!"
He was going to say, 'any more assholes like you!', but his gaze had fallen on the culprit perched on his desk, at the back of the room, and grinning from ear to ear. The anger drained out of him as he stared at the sparkling eyes of his soulmate in disbelief.
The first rays of sun peaked in softly through the windows as Dean and Castiel ate scrambled eggs on toast with a healthy side of bacon. Cas learnt that Dean was a decent cook, but his skills were limited to a couple of options at each mealtime. Dean learnt that Cas kept busy most days, the last meal he had eaten was a hurried ham and salad sandwich while loading up their equipment for the show at 6pm last night.
"Honestly, I'm not sure I actually slept with her." He added, lounging against the counter and joining in Deans laughter. "It wasn't fucking funny at the time."
He could see Cas shake his head as a smile crept across his face, but he didn't pull away, which pleased him greatly. He supposed that this was what soulmates meant. Some-one who took in all your strange antics and enjoyed them as much as you did. Not asking you to change. Not asking you interfering with your other relationships. Just accepting you, as you are, and staying by your side anyway. He hoped so. He wanted Cas with him in the future, he wanted to know that he could look forward to finding him in his garage, or drinking coffee in his kitchen, or arguing with his friends around a fire. He met the guy two night ago and he couldn't picture going home without him. Which is why they were laying here staring at the ceiling as darkness fell outside, rather than getting up and leaving like he should.
"Didn't I tell you they were good?"
"What about him Meg?" Came the first guy again.
Cas held his hand out in the same manner he had with Faith. "I'm Castiel, it's nice to meet you Jo."
"So are you out celebrating?" Gabe asked curiously.
"Cassy! It's about time." Balth greeted him. "Where have you been?"
"Hey Cas."
"Relax, Dean. It's just a house." Cas said watching him eye the room uncomfortably.
"Alright what are your boys plans for the day? I'm assuming you're wiggling your way out of helping me in the shop?" Bobby asked, watching the boys flirting.
"Just for clarification." Dean said looking him over carefully. "You are okay with me doing what I've been doing right?"
“My turn.” Cas murmured against his mouth.
"You told me you wouldn't break up with me!" She screamed at him.
But now, looking up and down the bar as casually as he could, he wondered if he had been wrong.
"Where did you put it?" Kevin asked, as Cas made his way up behind Dean.
"And you just happened to come across the friend of the guy I'm sleeping with purely by accident?" He asked sarcastically.
"Same thing I do when they're home." Cas stated in confusion. "What else would I do?"
Cas couldn't keep the annoyance and hurt out of his features as dropped his hand, tapping his fingers on the mattress beside him, as he processed the information. Kevin sat silently as he studied him.
Cas wrapped his arms around his waist, pulling him closer, and placing his mouth next to his ear. "That wasn't a no."
"Three police visits to our house inside a month." Cas said taking notice of the cars parked down the drive. Just his luck to be the last one here.
Cas held his hand out for Dean to shake, "Do I look like the type to throw a tantrum?"
"Where are your four siblings?" Dean asked, pushing his plate away. "Where's Gabriel?"
"Well, I thought he was lovely!" Cas said with his voice dripping in sarcasm.
"So how about it Castiel? My place our Balths?" Daniel changed subjects.
They spent the next hour raiding Deans cupboards, trying to find something a bit closer to Cass usual clothes and failing, settling in the end for clean jeans, a black shirt and Deans favourite leather jacket. Cas was glad that he and Dean were so close in size, if you didn't know what Cas looked like normally you wouldn't be able to tell that he was standing there in some-ones else's borrowed, well, everything. Christ even the watch was Deans. After a friendly argument about the fair trade in their relationship at that point, Cas managed to slip the watch Dean had considered too expensive for working on cars, onto his wrist.
"I hope so. He can be a handful at times. Sam's the good one, he keeps his head buried in the books, doesn't give me too much trouble. He riles Dean up at times though."
Cas climbed in slowly, laying down and facing Dean. Dean looked at him curiously when he reached out and placed his hand on his arm.
"Did you say four?" Kevin asked.
"You were supposed to be the sweet innocent nerd, not the bad influence!" Charlie accused when the class filed out at the end of the session, Lisa stomping her way out arm in arm with one of her friends.
Daniel followed that, arguing that the level of cover people received at any economic level, was not a fault of the system, but a fault of employees and employers who failed to understand or negotiate that system correctly, placing emphasis on the fact that the system itself was designed to offer care to all. Kevin followed this bringing up slides of evidence about the number of families that were financially destroyed by trying to pay for lifesaving treatments. As well as the amount of people who were denied by the health insurance agencies despite having policies in place that covered their needs.
"Dean." His soulmate offered, with his eyes following the progress of his fingers.
"They broke up on Monday. Cassy spent half the day with an imprint of her hand on his face." Daniel bit back a laugh and beamed at Cas.
"You gave him your tie?" Balth screwed his face up.
"What the actual fuck Gabriel!" He demanded, not bothering to hide his frustrations.
Dean passed him the phone in exchange for a mug. Cas wandered to the table with his own, claiming a seat and scrolling through the images. All of them were taken after Adams departure, with the group all smiling and laughing at different points. She had taken a few of him and Dean leaning towards each other as they spoke as well as a couple of him and Benny re-joining the group, Benny's arm around his shoulders as they spoke, what caught his attention was the offended look on Deans face as he watched them.
"Of course, I'm worried about him." Cas bit out, showing the first real sign of emotion in hours.
"No. No, it's just that you need to know that I uh..." Deans eyes searched the kitchen as he figured out how to word it. "I... I've never been with a guy before." he admitted, going red.
"That's completely underhanded and you know it!" Cas accused jutting his jaw out.
Cas looked around the room considering the logistics of pulling a mattress from one of the other rooms, meeting Deans eyes as he thought it through. Dean studied him closely, smiling softly as he hummed along to the tune he was strumming.
"At least three kids were drifting off in that class!" Cas defended at Dean snicker. "He has the perfect monotone of a robot."
"Now you have my number and I have yours." Dean said easily as a message popped up from Gabe.
He slipped out to the bathroom, after Dean released him, closing the door behind him. Dean remained where he was, keeping his eyes half open and trained on the bathroom door, as he tried to slow his racing heart. He didn't want Cas taking off on him, and he was terrified that as they got to know each other, Cas would come to realise that he wasn't good enough for him. He was relieved when Cas opened the bathroom door, smirking when he saw Dean watching him make his way back to bed.
The chuckle started with Dean and spread quickly around the circle as the tension eased. Cas was the last one to smile again. It wasn't until Dean pulled him into a one-armed hug that he was able to shake off the stress that had pooled in his stomach at Adam's actions. The quick show of affection had him breathing easier as he pressed his face into Deans neck and the group around them letting out a few whistles and cheers.
"Alright, fine." He submitted, raising his hands in defeat. "Just stay out of it next time."
Cas woke alone in the morning. That would have been a problem if he hadn't smelt the coffee wafting into the room. He rubbed his eyes and got up to raid Deans draws for a pair of boxers. Finding what he was after turned out to be pretty easy. The draws were all neatly arranged in clear piles unlike his own draws that he shoved his clothes in at random never quite having the time to organise them. He threw the boxers on and headed out to find Dean, cracking the cupboard door open on the way just to see if that was neat too. It was.
He narrows his eyes even further. “Anybody else you ask for input about my relation-“ he catches himself. “About me and Dean?”
“We’d take some more knives, if you know a guy.”
“I’m different now. Still me,” he adds hastily, looking a little worried. “Just different. But still me.”
Dean had stared before he could get out “did you just Han Solo me?”
somebody here, it wouldn’t be anybody’s fuckin’ business.
Jack gives him one of his little waves where his hand just goes up and doesn’t move before he turns and starts heading down the road. He doesn’t vanish right off. Dean’s not surprised. Jack likes the walk. Dean watches him go.
“I bet he’s good at fetch.” Jack almost absentmindedly snaps his fingers as Dean raises the Coke to his lips and he’s about to ask him what’s up with that when the beverage passes his lips and he groans, putting the bottle back down.
“Rebuild Heaven. No more walls. No more being trapped. Anyone can go wherever they’d like. I think that’s only right.”
good at this.”
“I’m trying to break all the commandments before I die.”
“Yes.” Castiel feels his lips twitch as he remembers Dean’s vaguely irritable prayer on the subject. “I know.”
“Don’t worry. I’m not gonna get reckless when I’m hunting.” She rolls her eyes at the look Castiel shoots her. “I am less likely to be reckless now than I was before.”
“Well, first of all, you’re not
“Hey.” Dean nudges him with his shoulder. “You in there? What’re you thinking about?”
“Just of… being an old man.”
“That’s the first time you’ve ever-“ he says hoarsely.
Jack points at his hand with his fork. “Your body. It’s real. I made it myself. I thought you’d prefer to look how you always looked.”
Dean can hear the smile in Jack’s voice and is kinda glad he’s busy making the pancakes because how big that kind of smile gets always makes him feel awkward and a little embarrassed. “Thank you, Dean.”
Castiel smiles. “I think you’re the least selfish person I’ve ever met, Jack.”
When Sam and Eileen come back from the walk, they see Dean hunched over the table, staring into nothing as he looks at one of the notebooks.
“Castiel.”
It’s so easy. This conversation, the implications, it’s so much easier than Castiel would have expected, and even if Dean’s so calm he knows it’s the same feeling for him, too, the quiet relief. “That’s not why I did it, you know.”
“I’m glad you’ve found some measure of happiness.”
“So,” he says. “I’ve got a plan.”
“Are the flowers on purpose?” Cas asks, and Dean knows what he’s asking. He takes a deep breath and swallows.
“I’m just saying, if you started saying shit like that just a few years earlier-“
(See the end of the chapter for
And now that we don’t have to worry about monsters anymore-“
“Did you use some god magic on this?” Dean says when they both lay their fish down on the dock.
“It’s complicated.”
Castiel doesn’t know what that means. He hears the hope in Dean’s voice and is glad for it. He thinks about a cabin by a lake, and wonders what it would be like to sit on the edge of the dock and stare out at the water and the trees.
and I kinda thought-“ his words choke off in his throat and he puts down his wooden spoon for a second to brace his hands against the counter.
“I’m not worried,” Castiel says. “I am… contemplative.”
“It was my pleasure.”
“It’s nice here,” Castiel says as Dean hands him a beer. “I like it.”
“With a special knife or something,” Eileen says.
“Don’t be a baby, Dean.” Sam gives him a little wave. “Call us if you need anything.”
He reschools his expression to something that tries to look very innocent. “Nothing.”
It took Dean a few minutes to be able to look at Cas without bursting into fits of laughter all over again. When he could stand without support, he quickly found that Cas had trapped him in the corner of the counter. He wasn't about to complain, a half-naked, tattooed musician, who looked ready to devour him had his thoughts turning to more intimate possibilities.
"Let's go home Cas." Dean walked around the car stopping at the driver’s door.
Deans mind went blank, unable to think of anything but Cas inside him. It took another quiet question from the man before he could remember where he kept those things.
It was while Benny was going into detail about a particularly ignorant line cook at his restaurant that Dean saw him appear at the across from him. His face more animated now as he pleaded with the blonde bartender in front of him. A smile lit up his face as she threw her head back and laughed, gesturing for him to wait while she retrieved something.
one, the other- you got
Jack walks towards him and holds out his arms. Castiel almost collapses into a hug and feels Jack squeeze him tightly, and he wonders exactly how long he’s been gone, and what exactly happened.
“No time limit,” Jack confirms, and then in a softer voice. “Be careful, Dean.”
“Yeah.”
He smiles. “Must have been hungry, huh?”
“Do you… have those in case I come over?”
Dean wants to shake it, demand it give Cas back
” Castiel takes another few steps. “You have that power, I
Castiel thinks about bringing up the fact that you only get hungry up here mostly when you feel at least a little bit like being hungry, but lets it go. “I could eat.”
“I know. I’ll miss you until I see you again.”
“What happened?” Sam asks. They all look a little crestfallen as they see he’s alone.
“You wanna sit on my couch and eat Chinese food while we watch
He’s so Cas’s kid, and Dean guesses it’s gotta count for something that it’s not the kind of thought that slows him down anymore. “Sure, let’s go and see what’s in the kitchen.”
implied in his tone.
“This is very simple,” Jack says, a little loudly. “If it wasn’t simple before, it is now. I have gotten outside confirmation from Charlie and Meg and Sam and Mary and Mom and Gabriel-“
“The recipe called for making your own chicken stock,” Dean says, chopping carrots as he watches the bolognese tutorial. “But that seems a little advanced for where I’m at right now, you know? I mean, maybe not really, but I dunno, small steps. Storebought’ll be fine for now.” He accidentally cuts one of the pieces of carrot wrong. “Fuck.” He tosses one to Scrapper. “Your lucky day, bud.” He picks up his onion and squints at it. “Hey, at least the knife skills come in handy for something other than ganking demons, huh?” He gets to work on the onion. “So I worked my way through the second book, too. Not much there, either. I’m keeping notes, though. I know I can think of something with enough time. Everyone’s keeping their ear to the ground for me.” He dumps the onions and the carrots in the pan with the pancetta. “Hey, we cooked together that one time in the Bunker, you remember? I was making burgers and you wanted to learn how to cook so I, uh, I walked you through it, you’d just gotten out of the shower and you were in sweatpants and I said
Dean gives him a hug. “Course I’m careful. Careful’s my middle name.”
He’s wiping it down, even though it’s almost certainly something he doesn’t need to do. There’s something different about the way he carries himself. He doesn’t look quite so tense, something looser in his shoulders. His brow is unfurrowed.
They’re both quiet again, Castiel struggling to decide if he should say something, until Dean looks at him, his face much calmer than he would have expected, and points his bottle at him.
“Back. And I’m gonna get you back. But… dammit, Cas.” He leans forwards like he’s actually arguing with him, talking to him in person. “You couldn’t have
Dean sighs again. “Okay.”
“I’m not watching you kick our asses some more, Dean, I’m pretty tired of it.”
Sometimes, after a while, Cas’s face is tinged with sadness, and once when Dean can see the forlorn traces in his face as he puts a vase of red carnations on Dean’s little table (a little cleaner than it was before all this started), he decides to bring it up cause Cas shouldn’t be forlorn, ever. He looks all sad and it’s… kinda upsetting.
“How long was it between getting together and getting married?”
Slowly, Jack and Castiel pull down the wall until standing in front of them is the void of space.
“Yes. That sounds nice.”
Dean immediately makes his way out from behind the bar and rapidly walks up to Castiel until he collides with him in an almost forceful hug. Castiel returns it, the relief settling into his skin. He lets himself sink into the hug and pretends that he doesn’t know that despite everyone continuing their conversations, they have several sets of eyes on them.
Eventually Dean settles on a movie playing cheesy period dramas, which is extremely fuckin’ embarrassing, but there’s absolutely nothing on and there’s nobody else here and even if there
Cas’s lips twitch. “Very well.” He returns his attention to the show. “This has significantly fewer cowboy hats than most of the media you consume.”
Dean looks amused. “Yeah, Cas, I bet that’ll go real well for you.” He takes his root beer back. “Gimme that.”
“Yeah.” Dean looks back at the TV, too. “Still good, though.”
a last name.” Cas looked thoughtful. “I think we should tell Sam we did it because it was funny.”
“You have found,” he said, still smiling wide. “A way for me to say
Castiel squeezes his hand.
“That’s good. Put him back on.”
“Well, it’s, it’s

“I’d win this time.”
“And is there a surefire way to get me out?”
like a
“I know. There’s no part of this that’s fair. And don’t. Don’t blame Jack. Jack is… doing his best.”
“This is part of my heaven. I haven’t really… fully tinkered with it. It feels a little silly for me to have a heaven.” He shrugs. “But sometimes I need someplace to go.”
you do, it won’t be hard, I can help you, we can do it together-“
“That’s nice to hear. Thank you.” Jack looks at him. “The angels that are left don’t want to fight anymore, Castiel. I think everybody’s tired of it.”
, but it wasn’t, right? It wasn’t always gonna be us, Chuck said as much, so that makes it… better, doesn’t it? It makes it better cause we did it ourselves. Even when we didn’t know we were working at it together, we were working at it together. And I’m so glad it was you. Of
is not the word he wants to use. It feels too small. But it’s the one he chooses.
Charlie nods slowly.
“Went alright.” Dean dumps his duffle bag on a chair. “Cas and I got married. Taught him how to change a tire.”
“I’m flat out telling you that you’re an idiot.”
She pulls back, wiping at her eyes. “Can’t you ask Jack to bring him back?”
“He is
Cas’s voice jolts Dean up quick and he sits up. “Yup. Absolutely sure.”
Dean takes meticulous notes for about an hour, writing down sentences or passages that look relevant, switching between notebooks sometimes. His notebooks are ordered by subject so if anything in the text shifts, he’s got to be everything in the right place. After that hour he gets up and he heads to bed. He’s gonna need to make breakfast for Charlie tomorrow and he should get to sleep at a reasonable hour this time. He checks one more time to see if Scrapper’s water bowl needs to be refilled and then heads to his room, closing the door behind him.
“Why are you nervous?” Cas squinted at him as he sat on the edge of the bed to pull on his socks. “What’s going on?”
“Dude,” Dean says, entering the common area of the Bunker. “Did you buy me ferns?”
“Yes.”
“Oh.” He tries not to show how off putting that is. “Okay. Hi.”
“Sound.”
Castiel thinks it over.
“Hey, man. I am who I am.”
Jack cheerfully slides his arm through Castiel’s and takes a step, and suddenly they’re in a nice, clean mall with lots of windows and stores, bustling with people.
“I, uh. I could, um, I could help.”
Dean takes one long, shaking breath before he heads out of Cas’s room and closes the door behind him. He changes in his own room into a Zeppelin shirt and sweatpants and then returns to the main hall.
“I am, but, you know, trying new things.” Dean slides her a plate. “Quit your bitching and eat your food.”
same reason you’re being an idiot. So it’s not like he’s dodging you because he never wants to see you again. At this point he’s as worried about giving you space and not wanting to deal with it as you seem to be.”
” Jack shoves his hands in his pockets. “I don’t know anything about the process but I’m just excited to be here.”
is very good, by the way. I appreciate Charlie’s recommendation. I think she’d like being an Aunt Charlie.”
He sighs.
It’s been a busy day. Castiel’s accompanied Dean on trips to the butchers where he dithered over meats, gone with him to the grocery store as he dithered over the right potatoes for potato salad. He’s helped him pick out tablecloths for the long tables the food will go on, he’s put up a fence in the backyard because Dean insists that a fence is right for the barbecue. He’s helped and worked with Dean all day, thinking
“Yes. I would.” Castiel takes a sip of his water. “Does Dean know?”
He shrugs, not wanting to say
“If you think they look-“
“Okay.”
“You don’t have to ask him to-“ Castiel says at the same time Dean goes “whoa, I don’t want to take away from your time with-“
Cas turned them over in his hands. “Oh.”
fast, huh?”
“That’s good.” Castiel leans a hand on the car as he lowers himself down just enough to see through the window. “Are you enjoying yourself?”
Both of you
“That’s true. The nicest place you probably ever ate with Sam and Dean was an upscale Wendy’s.” Charlie grins at him. “You do those air quotes
Dean looks down again, still grinning. “Thanks, man.”
what is-“ he looks back at him and realizes, for the first time, that there is something Different about his son. He holds himself the same as he ever did, smiles just as he always has, but there’s something inside him. Like his skin is faintly glowing. “What’s happened to you?”
They settle into a booth, sitting across from each other in the high-backed section. “Of course there’s a table.”
Dean nods towards the birdhouse on the porch. “Go nuts.” He hefts the bag and puts it in the shed, closing the door as Jack carefully hangs it from the tree over near the window in the dining room. He’s got a set of binoculars set up there so he can see what new kinds are there. Sam’s expressed surprise that he’s become a “freaky bird guy” but, well, he’d really missed the birds when Chuck sent them away.
And okay, so, maybe the flowers are okay. Maybe Dean likes having gifts from Cas. Maybe he likes waking up and seeing them in the morning.

Dean grins, looking back at the sky. “You waited to tell me you loved me until you never had to deal with the repercussions, man, you don’t get to give me shit about avoiding anything

is,” Dean cuts in loudly. “That you get
“Are they… okay?” Jack hesitates and Castiel sighs. “Jack-“
Right.
“You did find a nice little spot, Dean,” she says quietly as they come up on the lake. “I like it here.”
“Why not?”
It had been quite coincidental, ultimately, that he’d run into Jack and Dean in the Impala that first time. And ultimately, a little strange that Jack had asked Dean to meet him at the mall. And really, how many little times has he run into Dean unexpectedly while out with Jack?
Dean opens his mouth, sighs, and drops it. “So what are those?”
“I am thinking about a city, though? I like the idea of skyscrapers.”
He yawns again, trying to pull himself into some semblance of consciousness. “Why’d I have fallen down some stairs?”
“He’s modest.”
traveling safe.
Meg nods slowly, then bumps her knee into his. “Thanks, Clarence.”
So when Cas gives him violets, Dean doesn’t say anything except thank you, even though his stomach flips when he gives him the vase, even though something in his chest constricts every morning when he sees them.
“I could do a dream,” he says. “Who do you need to speak to?”
“Sure. Everyone needs a hobby. Seems like a fun one.” She peers at what he’s doing. “Is that eggs benedict?”
“Hm?”
“I’m.” He clears his throat. “I miss him, too.”
How could he not know when he was dying?
“Of course it does. We’re Team One because we’re number one.”
Just a headsup that I wrote this right after 15x19, when I had much less understanding of what had gone on in the show since I stopped watching it than I do now, so some characters are going to be a little out of joint (Charlie especially I think) but honestly I like this fic the way it is, so I thought I would post it.
She heads back to her table and Dean turns to him. “Cas, you want a burger?”
Meg stares at him, then calmly swaps their plates out and starts eating all his fries, eyes never leaving his.
“No,” Jack says serenely. “No pie.”
They sit in comfortable silence for a minute.
“I promise I’ll be okay.” The room is fading a little bit and he tightens the arm around her shoulders. “Live well, Claire. Live wonderful.”
Castiel blinks, confused, takes a step towards the voice, and finds himself in a diner. The diner is mostly empty (a recent build, he thinks, probably something from Balthazar, who finds them quaint), but there’s a familiar redhead who’s sitting in a booth, who grins when she sees him.
“There’s a table.”
“Twinsies.” Charlie gestures towards the remote. “Fire it up.”
“Son of a bitch,” he mutters before he rolls out of bed to hit the bathroom and then make some waffles.
” Castiel still feels a little stuck on that as he fumbles for his silverware.
He probably likes the idea of all his friends gathered under one roof, where he can look at them and knowing they’re all right. “That sounds nice for him.”
“You’re too old to be eating the way you do.”
Dean feeds and takes out Scrapper while Charlie gets changed into her PJs. Dean had made sure when he bought the cabin that it had three bedrooms. One for him, a guest room, and one for when he figures it out. He stands on the porch, waiting for Scrapper, breathing in the night air. Pine needles and lake water. The weather’s supposed to be nice the next couple days. Maybe he’ll go fishing.
“I thought the whole point of this was to see whether or not Casper could beat Feathers,” Meg says. “If you’re a two man team it defeats that.”
“It’s a nice collection of cookbooks,” Sam observes about the shelf over the kitchen sink that’s been gaining more books over the past few months as he walks into the living room.
Sam and Eileen look at each other. Dean waits to see what they have to say, knowing there’s nothing either of them could tell him that’ll change his mind.
“Yeah?” Sam asks.
“Have a good time in Poughkeepsie,” he says. “Say hey to Stevie for me.”
stuff.”
“I want to appear to someone in a dream. I don’t want to do anything else. That’s it. And if it’s something you’re uncomfortable with, then you don’t have to.”
mellowed in the past year, but he hasn’t mellowed that much. “I wanted you cause you’re you. All this means is that we don’t know who’s gonna die first anymore.”
Castiel doesn’t even have words. Instead he just stumbles forwards as Jack walks towards him at the same time and catches him in a hug, almost too relieved to stand up. He knew Jack was okay, knew it from all Dean’s prayers, but there’s a vast amount of difference between knowing and seeing.
“Goodbye, Claire,” he says quietly, before he leaves the room.
Castiel blinks, and in the act of blinking, recognizes that he has awareness once more.
Jack turns to Dean. “Meg asked me to take a look at one of the walls and see if it’s fully come down, she has some concerns. Will you stay here and help Castiel?”
“Thank you.” Jack looks at Dean. “What do you think?”
He fights to keep the smile off his face.
Well. Cas could call him Scraps.
“We don’t need to do the whole… shebang. We could just wear them. Unless you
Dean.
“Awesome,” he says, and something in Castiel’s chest unclenches, a little bit.
Cas rolls his eyes but holds out his hand. Dean takes it and the two of them haul each other up. Cas doesn’t let go of Dean’s hand. Dean doesn’t pull it away.
“Cool.” Dean claps his hands together. “I’m gonna go talk to it.”
“Thank you for everything you’ve done for my boys.”
“I’m on my own side, baby. It’s the best side there is.” She takes another one of his friends. “Call your boyfriend. I’m tired of him asking about you.”
“Well.” Dean flips a pancake. “Yeah, I guess, you know, I know you like them, so, you know, in case you come by, I thought I’d have them on hand.”
“Promise me you’ll be okay,” she whispers.
But now I maybe… don’t think that anymore. Cause of you. I could’ve killed Chuck, you know? Chuck
“Two days.” Castiel swirls his little cardboard stick in his coffee. “He’s spent the last few days rifling through cookbooks and picking out appropriate foods. He keeps asking my opinion even though I know nothing about barbecues.”
“Kid gets a house, then he gets a dog. He’s gotta copy everything I do.”
“Yes. Me, too.”
“Right.”
Jack comes first. Jack will
“Just a couple of idiots,” Dean says eventually. “Crying on a porch.”
One day, Castiel is building a collection of cabins when he hears a voice, clear as day.
“What are you gonna do if it says no?”
“You’re welcome.” He sits across from her.
Castiel manages to push himself to his feet and surges his energy into taking one step, landing in the park, staggering a little. Jack has a hand gripping the swingset, looking winded, face wet. The park is cloudy with threats of a thunderstorm as he stares at Castiel.
“Usually. I like annoying you. Your wings get all flustered.”
Meg looks at him over her burger that she’s not eating. Castiel suspects that she ordered it even though she didn’t feel like one because she didn’t want it to seem like she was here just to spend time with him. “Do I seem like the kind of girl who goes around asking about people’s feelings before she gives them her opinion?”
“Which is why I’m gonna beat you, and it’s gonna be awesome.”
“It’s more fun playing on a team with Dean.”
“Thank you. I like it.” Jack turns to him. “He’s thinking about opening up the Roadhouse again.”
“I think I’d like that.”
“Were you okay?”
“Still nothing, sort of.” Dean prepares the steak. “I’ve got some ideas, but nothing concrete yet. You still got nothing?”
to be happy? What if they want to kill me?”
“I… I have Jack. And I have been… seeing friends.”
“Still. It counts for something.”
-“ he lowers his fingers. “Whenever I do that, but I’m not. I just know all your faces. And that’s your worrying about Dean face.”
“It’s not fair to ask you.”
“Castiel,” she says, lips tilted up and twisted into that clever smile he remembers from so long ago. “Did you have me sprung from the Empty on a
“I did.” Jack looks extremely satisfied, like he does whenever they come across a section of heaven he built. “I’ve been told teenagers like malls. Come on. There’s a Penney’s in here. It’s where we went when I was first getting my clothes.”
“You want to watch any more TV or are you tired?” Dean asks.
you a ring.”
“I’m going to sock you, Feathers.”
high on the list.”
“You don’t even need to eat.”
Jack pulls back and wipes at his face.
This is the reality:
“So what do you want to do?” Dean asks as they look around, leaning against the dining room table. “We’ve still got Charlie’s magic credit card. We can do whatever you want.”
“First of all,” Dean says. “You have terrible taste in music.”
Cas sighed, jumping up to sit on the counter, studying Dean as he continued to walk off his frustration. "Would it make you feel better if I crash at Balths tomorrow?"
"Shut up!"
"Alright, go play with your soulmate, but I want a photo. If I'm keeping your secret for a while I want to see how handsome this guy is!"
Dean kicked back on the bed smiling to himself. Cas could handle losing his house and looking after his mom but freaked out over having to walk into a public school.
Dean agreed, waving him out the door.
Cas answered as he select a few of the images, focusing on the ones of him, Dean and Benny, but making sure to grab at least on of the other people present as well. It would be nice to be able to refer to them when Dean discussed his friends in the future, he wasn't sure he would be able to keep the names straight without visuals, not that he would admit it.
He heard the rev of the engine as Gabriel drove off in his little red eco car and turned back to Dean, who was watching the cars exit.
"You don't seem overly worried about that?" Dean quirked his eyebrow.
Dean watched transfixed as Castiel picked up his water and backed into the crowd, watching Dean with interest and confusion as he left. Even as he was lost to sight, Dean stared into the crowd trying to place what the hell had just happened to him.
"You think you've got a chance?" Cas smirked.
"Why aren't you upset over it then?" He asked in return.
If he calls, I want to know that I'm in a position to get to him. You understand?"
Dean read over the message a second time. It didn't sound like Cas and he was struggling place why, when the next message came through. A photo of Cas standing in a library, with a few scattered student behind him, all dressed in their private school best. What stood out was the bright red handprint across the side of his face as he gave the camera a curious look. Beneath, came another message.
"Course I have!" He defended hopelessly, knowing that Benny would hear the lie the moments it left his mouth.
"Goodnight, Gabriel."  He called back, the slight shake in his voice would have been embarrassing if he had the energy to care.
The first wolf whistle had him rolling his eyes, clearly this class was rowdier than the science classes had been. The second was followed up with some guy calling for the new kids attention. At this, Cas scratched the back of his head with his middle finger, sending a roll of laughter through the isles behind him and causing the Mr B to look curiously at his innocent expression.
Cas laughed at this, shaking his head.
"Don't let the angry act fool you. Bobby is a sweetheart. His offer was genuine, when he said you're welcome at our place, anytime for any reason. In his mind, you're family now. Sam's too, he told me the other day that he likes his other brother better."
"I don't want you on your own if this is happening Ash. I want to know you're safe."
"Would you be social for an hour! Go find him, have a few drinks. Maybe find someone to enjoy for a while. Live a little Cassy!"
"Nothing serious." Benny stated. He waited for Dean to focus on him. "They only cornered me because they were concerned about Castiel here. They care for him. That's all."
Cas can hear his prayers.
“So we should all bowl together and see what’s what. Sam said he’d do it with me.”
Dean huffs. “Yeah, sure you are.”
easy.”
Castiel lets himself chase the impulse and reaches out to take Dean’s hand. Dean doesn’t jump but instead twines their fingers together. There’s something secure about it. He wishes he’d done it before now.

“Buddy,” he mumbles when he stumbles out in his robe. “You
“Yes, well.” Jack grins at him. “People don’t stop being annoying in heaven.”
“Sounds nice for you.”
“I’ll put my clothes away,” he says hoarsely.
you?” She leans in. “How did it go?”
They sit in peaceable silence before Dean decides to let his brain take a spin on the wheel of impulse decisions and land on one. He turns and very gently presses his lips against Cas’s, who jumps a little bit next to him before going very still.
funny and so
“I’m here against my will,” she answers, not looking up from her magazine. “I take no sides.”
“That’s a really mature stance to take here, Cas.”
Castiel gazes at him and thinks
That’s all he truly ever wanted, anyway.
longer than I would, so that’s kinda worse.”
Her voice softens a little. “I’d have let you know, Dean.”
“Well. Now I know… what the intent behind the words are. So I can. I can wait.”
Castiel blinks, looking up at him in surprise as he adjusts the jacket. Dean flushes, shrugging a little. “I know you, man.”
“You can’t see my wings.”
Charlie gives him a small smile that tells Dean she knows what he’s going to be doing, and she walks up to him to stand on her tiptoes and give him a kiss on the cheek. “Sleep well.”
“They have a little home and they’re going to go back to school. They want real jobs. I’m happy for them. Retirement suits them. Eileen is going to propose to Sam.” He looks over at Castiel sternly. “But I am not supposed to know that.”
“It’s okay. It’s not a resurrection. It has precedence. I’ll never ask for it again.”
Dean flushes and it distracts Castiel for a second. They stare at each other.
“That’s true.” Charlie hands Castiel the cheese fries he’d requested when she’d gone to get them food. “These are nasty, dude, I don’t know why you like them.”
Charlie laughs, looking out her window.
Sam’s Labrador Retriever, the second he jumps out of Sam and Eileen’s car, is extremely enthusiastic.
“Yes. I heard.” Castiel pulls down another chunk of wall and watches as it vanishes into nothing. “I’m doing my best, Mary.” To be polite. He has no interest in doing his best to like John Winchester.
Dean is, as far as Castiel knows, making the rounds in Heaven, visiting friends he’s missed.
“His name is-“ he sighs. “Whatever, point is, no dumbass dog that Sam’s got is gonna be better than Scrapper. He’s a
“Do, uh.” He held out the bag to Cas, who took them with a vaguely baffled expression. “Do you want to wear these?”
Claire nods, still gazing downwards.
Dean shrugs awkwardly again. “No problem.”
“Are… my parents there?”
“He’s a good kid,” he murmurs. “Three of us raised a good kid, Cas.”
“No. I thought we could show up at the cabin. I think it may panic him less for us to simply arrive as opposed to him having to drive out.”
“I like the rain. We could stay in.”

“I don’t think we ever properly met. I’m John.”
“Wow, it sounds like you don’t know him at all.”
He sees Jack smiling out of the corner of his eye.
“I promise.”

Castiel joins Dean out on the front porch with a lemonade after they run their errands, settling comfortably into the wooden chair to the right of Dean. “Here.”
Castiel smiles at him, trying to keep it fond and not so much amused. “I think that’s a very good Queer Eye, Jack.”
Charlie ignores that. “You could also both head into the arcade. I
Cas rolls his eyes. “Lying is a sin, Dean.”
“Penney’s, huh?” He hears a familiar voice say distantly. “Man,
Sam and Eileen spend a good chunk of their three days visiting keeping an eye on him until he tells them to knock it off. Jack hugs him extra tight before he leaves. Sam actually leans back a little when he hugs him when they leave, which is one of Dean’s least favorite things because it requires him to stretch, but he tolerates it and promises the two of them that he’ll call if the Empty decides to let Cas go.
They take a step and they’re on Dean’s front porch, Dean pushing the door open as best he can with the bags in his hands. The two of them head up the staircase and Dean leads Castiel to a little room that they had missed when he gave him the tour, having casually said “there’s just stuff in there, don’t worry about it”. He opens up the door and Castiel steps inside.
“I like the birds,” Dean cuts in, feeling a little needled at the same time he’s feeling a little warmed by Sam’s words.

“I mean, listen, we’re not good at the huggy feely crap. Any of us. And I get that, you know. And I get, I mean, I could’ve said something, you know, I know that. I get it. I get all of it
“Hey, Cas.” She stands up and the two of them walk forwards to meet in a hug.
It can’t be.
“I didn’t ask anybody. People are very keen to tell me.” Jack sticks his hands in his pockets. “I think it’s kind of funny. And sweet. Everyone’s thinking about you.”
“Dean Winchester.” The Empty folds its hands in its lap. “What do you want?”
“Sure.”
Meg takes a bite of pretzel. “Or what, you gonna smite me?”
“Jack,” he chokes.
“There’s a mall?”
and a large window, a white comfortable looking chair positioned by it. There’s a small bookcase up against the wall with copies of mystery novels by authors he loves, and a little table with a small stack of them. There’s shelves waiting to be filled with something, and a little closet in the corner, a dresser right next to it.
She rolls her eyes. “He’s my brother and I love him but he’s a dumbass. Not as big a dumbass as you, evidently, cause you just confessed your undying love-“
Dean’s still in the process of decorating his room. The shiny wood walls have very little on them. But he’s got photos of everybody up there, everyone he’s loved and lost, and sometimes he thinks that’s enough.
, Cas, I’ve known for a
Cas POV!
“I’ve just started walking and looking for restaurants.” Dean’s got his hands shoved in the pockets of his favorite jacket. He doesn’t wear his big leather jacket anymore, even up here. The relationship with his father, Castiel knows, is still thorny and complicated, and he thinks that wearing something of his father’s is probably too much to deal with. His favorite jacket is a good look on him, however, so Castiel certainly isn’t complaining. “Checking out places that are uh, brunchy, you know? I like breakfast, I like lunch, I figure it’s a winning combination.”
Castiel looks out the window. Mixed blessing, he thinks. Leaving his Grace behind is what got him out but perhaps, well. Perhaps things will have changed with Dean over it. He becomes suddenly aware that he’s starving, his stomach growling, and decides just as suddenly to keep his mouth shut over it. He’ll eat something when he finds Dean.
