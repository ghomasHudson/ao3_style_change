With a quick look to Clint, Steve went to reach for his bag containing his shield. But he was too late. Something knocked him over and he fumbled, staggering to the floor of the car. A young man with bleach white hair stopped, saluted him, and then knocked the bag out of his hands. In milliseconds the man disappeared in a blur. Dumbfounded, Steve stood for a moment and tried to parse what the hell just happened. But he never had the time for that because the young woman shot red flames at the train even as Steve looked out the windows again trying to get a glimpse of the young man.
“Yeah, there was a legend of a blue-eyed lion that climbed out of the sea and roamed Europe looking for his home,” Tony whispers, knowing full well it isn’t a legend at all. “Lots of kids loved the story, bought the book, the TV movie. The Disney adaptation. The whole thing. But this – this little guy was mine. My Blu.”
It takes a month, a box of scraps, and a lot of sleepiness nights for Tony to finally miniaturize the arc reactor enough so that it can be placed in his chest. The palladium is a poor choice as a central element to run the damned thing. He’ll need to figure out a better core later, if – no when – he gets out of the damned cave. He’s starting to wonder what the fucking sun feels like.
“I got an address. Natasha found it. Out in Bayonne.” Clint proceeds to tell him. It’s in New Jersey by the docks. It will take him over an hour to get there.
“See to it that you heed my words,” Jarvis says. He gestures to the rooms that will become Steve’s suite. “I’m sure you will find your way around. Dinner is at 7. Do not be late.”
Steve frowned and a worried look that bordered on loss cross his face. “Don’t know what I would do with myself.  You know, Sam once asked me if I wanted to get out of SHIELD, what would I do.” Steve shook his shoulders in a partial shrug. “I didn’t know then. I sure as hell don’t know now. Feel like I’m just embarking on something real though.” He reached out his hand and captured Tony’s wrist. He grazed a touch over Tony’s soul mark. “What is it?”
He’d just finished reciting the lines of code to Tony when he asked, “Jarvis is someone you deeply respect. He’s very protective of you.”
“How would you know, Nat? You didn’t see him. You didn’t hear what he said. You have no idea how strong and how wide the rift is,” he replies and the words tighten his throat so much that he’s reminded of his asthma attacks.
Once he  finished showering, Tony dressed and ventured to the kitchen. Normally when he got up there was usually some sort of breakfast and coffee made by his wait staff, but since it was so early they hadn’t arrived yet. He settled for making his own coffee and pulling out some frozen waffles that he could pop in the toaster. When he finished he had to admit that he was proud of his little feat. He sat down and started to eat just as the staff began appearing. He waved off breakfast but told them to make whatever they wanted – his chef and staff routinely ate their meals at the Tower, all provided by Tony. He even had an allowance for them to eat at home along with a generous salary. Most of his staff had elected to live in the Tower, rent free.
When he finishes kissing each finger, he finds his way to the palm and breathes over it. A low gasp and a flutter of eyelashes, and Tony smiles at him. He knows he’s doing it right. If you’re going to burn in Hell, you better do it for a damned good reason – Fury had once told him that – a different life time ago. This is a good reason; he kisses the palm and then drags his tongue down to the soft and tender skin of the wrist. Tony giggles and succeeds in cupping his hand around Steve’s neck to draw him down and over Tony. They are face to face.
Steve grimaces as he shuffles over to the door and hits a small recessed button that’s haphazardly wired into the wall. He can see the flashes under the door. “Oh.”
It’s an eerie warning and Steve swallows down the fear. She drifts away from his bed. Once she’s gone, Steve flips away the furs and blankets that cover him and tries to stand on wobbly legs. He should have healed by now, but things are different here. The Soul Keeper may curse him and cause him more pain because he’s betrayed the cause. Because he remembers.
“Wha-?” The crack of his voice scrapes at his hearing and he only wants to roll over and go back to sleep. Whatever happened, it’s not good.
“Listen, okay, I’m sorry. I know, I know what this is. You’re a sex worker. I get that – I just – I care about your welfare, okay?” Tony says and why does he have to defend himself for caring, for wanting this man to not suffer. “You don’t have to do this, you could have something more. I’m rich, powerful, I have friends in important places. You know who I am right, I’m To-.”
“You saw what I saw, Steve. SHIELD was – is building Hydra-type weapons. I don’t think you approved of those, did you?” Bruce watched him and, for a moment, he thought the scientist weighed whether or not to trust him.
By the time they get to foot of the rise, the sheets of ice have turned into an icy rushing river. Already it’s over Steve’s ankles. They don’t have a lot of time and he desperately hopes that beyond the ridge they can find shelter away from Ultron’s attacks.
The store clerk stammers for a reply. “Hmm, thank- you-.” As the whole of the prince’s entourage start to leave the store, the clerk finds his voice. “Prince Anthony, surely you’d like to spend some time in the store? Perhaps buying something for your lovely assistant?”
“And the rest of you? You just live here on his-.” Tony can’t continue. It’s too hard to think of these people using Steve.
He hopes she’s not going to play coy but he might not be able to stop it. He presses his lips together in a thin line. “Please.”
“Sir, Captain Rogers is in the kitchen discussing the situation regarding the Secretary of Human Security.”
“Like a mother hen in some ways,” Steve said. Natasha kept her coven in line with a firm hand, but she was never unfair. “She cares a lot. She told me not to get too involved with Tony, you know.”
“What trickery is this?” Hunter snaps his fingers and his companion jerks the whip. It lands on the big cat’s back, searing and sizzling. The lion leaps up, claws out, jaws open wide. He twists against the assault and swipes a giant paw at Hunter.
“I know, Tony. I get it.” Steve’s tone placates but also whispers toward acceptance and loss at the same time. “Now, let me get the dishes cleared and I’ll bring you something else to drink. What would you like?”
Tony wanted to take the pain away so he stood up and walked the length of the table. Though it was for just the two of them it could have easily sat eight people. Tony joined Steven at the end of the table, offered his hand, and they both stood to go to the lounge. “Bring the wine and the glasses.”
“Oh, yeah. The Widow’s Brothel has a stipulation that if at any time he’s pulled away for more than 16 standard hours, then they can recall you to work a shift here.”
First position is easy – it is essentially the presentation position. He’s already in it. He expects the alpha decided to start with this one to ease him into it. He knows that show positions were used for mating blocks and the Stalls way back when. Alpha walks around him assessing his form.
A small child races out of the house the man came from as soon as JARVIS finishes speaking. The boy clings to his father and jabbers on about something.
Steve finished his second burger and then said, “Zola experimented on him, not only in ’43 but after, when government granted Zola to be a working scientist at SHIELD. Of course, he was really just part of the new Hydra growing in SHIELD.” Steve didn’t seem disturbed by the facts he laid out. The strategist and soldier appeared. “It was Zola who did the initial conditioning. I read it in a file that Natasha got from her sources. Hydra inside SHIELD worked right alongside the old Soviet Union.”
“You let someone else knot you.” The words stated so plainly render him. Steve shudders and gulps. He can’t help it. The sob comes out of him, loud and hoarse. Arms curl around his shoulders and pull him into an awkward embrace. “God, Steve.” Tony’s voice scratches through the pain. Steve doesn’t know if the pain is his or Tony’s. “What did you do?” Tony kisses the crown of his head. “Why didn’t you come to me?”
Denying himself the satiation, the experience, grew within him until Steve couldn’t parse the difference. He said he didn’t want this type of love, that he labeled it as deviant and wrong. But he still wanted, he still yearned. Hungry for more, for sustenance had been his life. Why would he change it now? Because he could.
Considering his options, Tony examines the pieces of the armor left to him. The rest is far enough away that he’s not willing to go back for them just yet. The idea of leaving any of his tech for someone else to find rankles him. He doesn’t even know where to go to get the rest of the suit, but there’s someone who does.
“Yeah, by a few days. I want to upload the latest upgrade and then test out the glasses. Might take a few days to verify everything’s in working order.” He misses using his virtual reality glasses and gloves. He misses being able to see, to check out how Steve’s reacting, what his smile looks like. It had only been a month when Tony had to give up his sight for this stupid Gala event. If that idiot reporter would just stop being such a pain in his butt all the time. “So yeah see you very soon.”
Nothing. His own reflection answers him, haggard, old, frail. He backs away from the image, grabbing the clothes. He needs to get out, figure out how to active the serum to stop Ultron’s invasion in his head. If Ultron settles inside of him, then what will happen to his own consciousness? Would they be able to get him out? Would he have any chance of survival? Would his team need to terminate him for the good of the world?
He nods to the doctor who reads it as his exit which Tony is grateful for his perceptiveness. Once the doctor leaves, Tony walks up to the bed and touches Steve’s hand. He doesn’t pick it up, or hold it, he just grazes a finger over the back of his hand. “I used to dream of you. Do you know that? Probably not. When you first came back and then went on your road trip.” He pauses to brush his hand gently over Steve’s. “After I broke up with Pepper, I used to think about you. Maybe it was always you. Maybe that’s why I’ve always been a little broken. It’s in my DNA. My father searched for you, for years and years. I always thought about you. You know.” He laughs a little. “I was the one who told Fury to look for you again. It was a snarky remark. I told him if he didn’t want me for his boy band then he should go and look for Captain America.” Tony hadn’t phrased it so politely then.
Through the haze of pain as he moved in and out of darkness and shadow he felt the wind on his face and smelled the metal of blood. Steve welcomed the numbness but felt the cradle of arms around him even though they were cold and harsh. His body moved through the stages of pain and, for a moment, he opened his eyes and saw only the blue of the sky and the moon in the day light sky. His eyes closed with the heaviness of pain and he wanted to know who held him, but his powerlessness became his definition. Maybe it was Bucky, maybe he’d come back. Yet, the pain enveloped Steve and stole his awareness.
“Shouldn’t happen, I told Natasha I would not come here if there wasn’t a whole house generator just in case.” He drinks the last of his coffee. “I should check the fuse box and make sure it’s set up correctly.”
Tony shifts his gaze to Steve. His eyes are bright with tears. “I know.” There’s something pleading in his voice. It tells Steve not to shatter this moment.
The river mirrors the anger of the storm. It’s churning and ugly. If they are going to Schmidt’s they have to cross it. If they aren’t then they shouldn’t chance it.
“Yeah, yeah. Bruce Banner. I told you about him. He’s the one who did the studies with his class for me. Doctor of something or other? I think it’s biochemistry or bioengineering. I have a conference call with him, today.” Tony beams. “We’re so close, Steve! I know it’s going to work.”
He picked up the phone and scrolled through the site until he got to a section on love and the soul bond. Most soul packs were close, closer than families. His soul pack stayed dispersed and jumbled. Maybe that was part of the problem. Wong was right. Of course the sorcerer was right. Steve had been playing with fire for two long years.
His world shattered after that and now, Bucky’s frozen and Steve’s stuck in Wakanda, beautiful Wakanda with a body in need and no alpha. Steve has no other choice but to offer himself up to the local mating block for an alpha or suffer through a heat alone.
He spends hours looking at old newsreels, trying to deny how similar his Steve looks to the one on the footage. Those are some strong genes, he tells himself – but maybe that’s a byproduct of the serum everyone mysteriously talked about? Whatever that was? He needs to go through his father’s papers on this bullshit.
“You sure?” Natasha didn’t sound convinced, but at the same time he saw that she tiptoed around his feelings – the one thing he just didn’t want to deal with right now. If he made it out of this fiasco, he would deal with those later. Not now.
“Since when did you get so up on the Helsinki findings?” Sam asked as he sat back in the chair next to the desk. Most of Steve’s belongings were packed up again. He needed to get out of DC. It wasn’t the best place for him. The media swarmed around him constantly. The different outlets spent time at his apartment and at Sam’s. Steve was afraid that Sam would follow him and move simply to get away from the hounds.
Bruce frowns. “Aren’t you dating Steve? Maybe he likes the way you look. That might mean something good.”
“I do, I do!” Steve snapped and then closed his eyes. “Sorry.” He opened his eyes and placed his untouched glass on the table as well. Staring down at his hands, hands that had only just healed – miraculously healed – Sam. “If I could place these hands on the whole of my nation, the world, I would. If I knew how to heal it, I would.”
Clint sniffed and crossed his arms over his chest. “I do.” He raised his shoulders. “I have a farm. I think about the future. I can’t do this forever, you know.”
Tony quiets again. They fall asleep until Sarah wakes up for her 2 am feeding. Pulling on his shorts and t-shirt, Steve tells him to stay put and gets up to tend to their daughter, making a pitstop at the bathroom before he leaves the room with a quick kiss for him. Tony dresses and then he follows Steve into the nursery, watches him tenderly pick up their baby daughter with her blonde curls in disarray from sleeping. He changes her and talks gently to her and then goes to the sideboard in the room where they have bottles waiting. Tony set up a system so that the bottles are ready as soon as the baby cries. Steve plucks one out of the rack and settles in the rocker. He spots Tony and smiles.
A pause – a pause that should not happen takes place and JARVIS says, “I am sorry, sir, but I cannot compute. What is the question?”
Steve drops down from his horse, gathers up the reins to all three animals, and ties them to a sorry looking bare tree. He retrieves a skin with water in it, pulling off his hand and pouring it in for the horses to drink.
“I’m not saying he isn’t. We all are faulty beings, but he’s been placed in a situation no one else has in the world. I know he’s hurting,” Bruce said as he went back into the bathroom. He called from the tiled room – the words echoing as he spoke. “You know, he needs this team. We’re his only family. Maybe we should all just do the bond thing and see if it works.”
“Tony, please,” Steve says and, against the cold, the snow, the hell of losing the man he loves, Steve reaches and scoops Tony up in his arms. Somehow he finds the strength to clamber to his feet even in the slippery mess. He straightens and sees that Shield and Tony’s horse aren’t far away. The fire of fear in his chest, Steve carries Tony across the bank toward the horses. The twigs and roots in his way try and trip him, but something like possession of spirits facilitates Steve’s progress.
He doesn’t explain anything more. He only flees from the hospital floor.  Doctors approach him as he beelines it to the elevators, but he only waves them off. Getting on the lift, JARVIS thankfully reads his mind and closes the doors before anyone can follow him. He sinks to the floor. “What the hell was that?” His fantasies never go from hot and bothered to fucking nightmare in one go. That’s not how Tony works. His body quakes and a cold creeps up his spine. His whole body rebels on him, shivering against a cold that’s just not there. Tony blinks several times, trying to focus, trying to get his mind away from what just happened. He loved every minute with Steve in that dream, but not the rest of it. What the fuck just happened? And why did it happen?
Tony blinked a few times as if he could rewind the conversation. “What’s that? Sorry, lot of interference on the line.” He picked up a wrench and rattled it around as if that meant anything at all.
Steve grunts out a no but follows Tony through the mammoth archway to the kitchen which is all kinds of updated and modern. He doesn’t care who says what – the red appliances are beautiful – even if he can barely make out the colors. “Color is the hardest thing to initialize and code.”
“Back to town, most probably. She knows the way, she’ll be fine,” Steve says and climbs back into his saddle. It’s better to have Tony directly behind him anyway. The pack horse only increased the chances of failure.
“Yes, and Wanda tapped into his darkest fears,” Clint added. “It was a defense mechanism, but I’m not so certain that Tony will see it that way. Not with his current state of mind.”
“I did what I had to do. They’re my family.” Clint said and then stood silently – the darkness around them formed a circle, a barrier against the rest of the world. Tears ran down his face. He didn’t sob or make a sound. “I tried to save Nat long ago. I tried my best. I couldn’t. Not when it meant my babies.”
“Damn he was going by Stone for a while. Must have changed it when his father died, but then now he has no shame I suppose. Shit, man, sorry. Stark’s getting married? That’s rough.” Clint shakes his head and tsks a few times.
No. Tony doesn’t want to watch this. From the angle Blu positioned him, Tony can clearly see the lion’s jaws, the massive paws with long talon-like nails. The last thing he wants is to watch himself being devoured. He attempts to move but that’s when the lion decides to strike. He opens his mouth and seizes Tony’s shoulder and chest between his jaws.
The lion in the corner shuffles about on his chain. It sits up and, even in the dim light of the cave, Tony swears the animal gazes at him.
In the shower, Steve had relented. He confessed to the Father Almighty that he was a deviant, that he was a pervert. He was a frail, broken human. He took himself in hand and thought of Tony, only Tony. There had never been another man he thought of like that. He thought of having him on the bed, of entering him, of Tony bending his back and looking over his shoulder so that Steve could kiss him as he pounded into Tony’s ass. He thought of cupping his hand around Tony, around his neck, enough that it secured them together, but also risked the consequences. He thought of how he wanted to spill into Tony, hot and wet. And then he shoved hard into his own hand and orgasmed long and deep until he fell to his knees in the shower. He’d sinned.
“Not that I can tell, sir. Though if the weapons are projectile then I would not read them without activity.”
“There is no need for you to worry about such things,” he says and then Steve feels him stand up, the weight of the bed shifting. He walks away and then returns with more warm clothes to clean Steve. “What would you like for our last time?”
Steve quakes. His hands at his temples shake. He pitches forward, bending nearly in two. “I know. I know.” He’s blinking and sucking in breath like a fish out of water. “I know. I just-.”
It only takes about 3 minutes before Steve’s made it to his feet again and shuffles to the door. The agony in his gut tampers down to a low throb. His face is numb, thanks to the nanotech Tony sprayed on it. Steve slips out into the corridor. It’s all very utilitarian, all concrete and fluorescent tube bulbs that hum lowly. They flicker and give an eerie feel to the whole passageway. There are several arches along the corridor – heading where – Steve doesn’t know. The concrete floor is cold against the soles of his feet. The corridor smells like oil and grease, slightly reminiscent of Tony’s workshop. That’s logical, considering.
When he planned to go to New York, he called Sam to tell him and said he would check in once he got to the city. In an off handed remark, Sam mentioned the idea of talking to the VA about getting a job transfer to New York. Just those few words eased Steve’s concerned.  He packed up a duffle, stuffed the Hydra files in the bottom of it, and then opened his door to leave only to find Clint in civilian clothes standing there, waiting.
“Sorry, I almost forgot them,” Steve said and wondered why he wouldn’t have remembered. Part of his brain only wanted to hide his head in the sand and forget about what he needed to learn about the future. “Just another thing to learn.”
“He was a tool of Hydra. According to this file Zola, under Operation Paperclip, continued what he started with Bucky in ’43. Only it was worse, so much worse. They brainwashed him.” Steve flipped through the papers to show Sam. It was probably the thousandth time that Steve had shown the same four sheets of paper as evidence to Sam of Bucky’s innocence. “You can’t blame a person if their consent is taken away. That’s basic Helsinki.”
She wouldn’t tell Bucky and his dread heightened until he could barely stand it. After that, he’d confronted the Jedi Scholars and begged them to allow him to save Steve. Only Peggy had supported him. Even now this trip, this mission was not sanctioned.
As the helicopter makes its way to the mainland, Steve convinces Tony to rest. His face is drawn, and dark circles bruise his eyes. Steve shares a concerned look with the medics but neither of them comment. Tony doesn’t sleep but he’s not fidgety and full of kinetic energy like he normally is. Steve’s not sure to take it as a good sign or bad.
“Okay, okay,” Tony mutters to the spirit of Pepper that seems to haunt him wherever he goes. He slips his feet to the floor, intakes a breath, and then finds his way over to Steve’s side. “You did good. Thanks.”
Grabbing Steve, Tony dashes for the door but Rumlow sees their furious run to the door and the rifle levels out to target them. Steve stumbles and, for a second, Tony thinks he's been hit. With no choice, Tony yells at him to move it while Nat zigzags through the broken aisles of equipment toward Rumlow. He hasn't a clue what she's up to and doesn't have time to worry about it. As he manhandles Steve to the door, the bullets pellet around them like possessed hail from the sky.
“Not all of them. I made sure they didn’t all die,” the omega says in tone that seeks defiance but falls just short of it.
After, Tony held Steve as he shivered and wept. He couldn’t say why he cried. Was it for joy or fear or loss or love? He didn’t know. But being with Tony kept him safe. They laid on the bed, staring out of the barn window as the day matured when a rapping on the door roused them from their nest.
Tony smashes his fisted hands on the keys, the dissonant sounds echoing in the room and Steve seizes him by the waist, urging him and then Tony’s pounding into Steve’s mouth without reservation. He cries out as he shoves without rhythm. He’s messy and needy and Steve takes it all, encourages him. Tony’s hands rip at his hair and press Steve close until his cock slips down his throat, choking him. A large swallow and Tony falls over the edge. He howls in completion and his hips jerk a few times as they lose the momentum of the moment.
“Less than an hour. Just relax.” He started the vehicle and peeled away from the station. In butt fuck no where they rarely saw vampires. He wasn’t surprised at the reaction. Instead of dwelling on it, Tony called Pepper. It was far too early, he knew that, but he also knew she would answer. It took five rings but she groggily answered the phone.
Once finished, they climb out of the shower and towel off. Slinging towels around their waists they go to the main room to seek out some food. It’s later than Steve assumed and Tony frowns because JARVIS informs him that there are several outstanding messages from Obie waiting for him.
. Here with Tony, in his household, he feels a comfort he’s never experienced before, not even with his best friend, Bucky.
“Fury is going to signal us,” Clint said. “We can’t stay here. They’re bound to come soon to check on the dead camera.” Clint pointed to the corner of the wall. “I was assigned to monitor it and switch it to a dummy recording before your little stunt.”
It only takes a few minutes for Steve to signal the waitress to get the food boxed up. As they walk out of the diner, Tony leans into Steve careless of whether or not people can tell that Steve leads him. He finds his heart settling to it, the idea of Steve as his partner, as part of him seems dangerously natural.
Within the room, Peter sits on the floor with a mechanical device that seems to be popping some kind of miniature lightning into a small flat wooden cart with wheels. To Steve’s astonishment the crackles of lightning charge the cart and cause it to move jerkily around the room.
With seemingly practiced hands, Tony gently touches Steve’s nose. “Cartilage is really out of alignment. It’s snapped. You sure you want me to do this?”
“Or they tried,” Clint replied. “I was to kill her. You know. My job was to go to Russia and eliminate her. She’s a powerful coven mistress and a lot of other covens follow her ideas. I saw another way.”
“No, what I mean is if you were going to tell everyone I’m a hooker why didn’t you just let me wear my own clothes?” Steve stops his frantic packing to glare at Tony.
“Oh,” Steve tried to formulate an adequate response, but nothing came to his brain. Everything went incredibly, horribly blank. He stared at the floor of their cabin, didn’t think to breath, or blink. “Oh.” It was all he could muster.
“Silly, silly boy,” Tony says and climbs onto Steve’s lap. He straddles Steve and runs his fingers through his hair, and he busies himself with kissing every inch. He starts at Steve’s lips, wanders along his jaw up to his eyes and then back to his lips. Kissing Steve frees Tony. He’s been bound by chains, hard and unforgiving for nearly a decade. The experiences he’s had in the love department can only be qualified as quick fucks – except for Pepper. Each and every one night stand he offered so little to, they never wanted to return. Now, as he molds himself to Steve, the tension, the fear, the lack of understanding melts away and he longs to lay himself bare for Steve. All of him.
Steve spins around and studies all of them. “Did you know? Did all of you know all these years?” The rage runs hot in him, burns the back of his throat. “Tony, did you know?”
“When I fought Dormammu I changed the course of time and everything that was in it. History was changed. Soul bonding has been around since the beginning of time, but the battle I fought changed how humanity perceives it. Before it was that couple that married for fifty years and were still in love, and then die within days of each other.”
He was fooling himself if he thought that the Tony in his dreams might be anything like the Tony in reality. The real Tony wouldn’t be understanding, wouldn’t get that it was hard for Steve to accept the idea that he might just be attracted to a man. He would snark and bitch at Steve, belittle him for his narrow mindedness. But where did the Tony in his dreams come from?
Thor hid his disappointments, but then he noticed when responsibilities forced him to cancel a session with the good Captain - he witnessed the glimmer of hope dissipate from Steven’s eyes. He noticed the slight slump of his shoulders. He saw the reflection of himself in the Captain. It hit him, an unraveling, a discovery.
He could have left him trussed up – had even considered it. He’d wanted to bind his hands behind his back and link that to bindings at his ankles. All the while making sure his collar was attached to the bedpost. Yet, Tony hadn’t done that at all. Instead he’d thrown some of the finest quilts to the floor and told the omega to sleep there. Nothing bound him. He was naked to be sure, but he wore Tony’s collar. It glittered in the morning light. Steven is rolled in the quilt, and curled onto one of the blankets. It’s amazing that he can make his body so small. Smiling, he considers Steven. He has to admit, his emotions soften anytime he thinks about his omega and he wonders at that. He shouldn’t be thinking of the omega so much as a friend or as a lover. They are companions to be sure, but they are warriors for a common cause of the Stark Family and his claim to the High Alpha Chair.
“Yeah, maybe he can make heads or tails of it. I know he worked on it with Ross,” Tony said. “You might be onto something.”
Tony leads Steven from the forward section of the Court vessel, Avenger, to the aft section. This is where the upper house, his closest clan members reside. Jamison, his Master of the Fleet. Pep, his First in the house. The aft section has its own bridge and engines. It is also a life pod in case there’s an attack on the main section of the ship. The corridors in the aft section are open, wider, cleaner in design without any piping or wiring. Large windows allow for the hyper-scape to be seen. It flashes blue and red showing what the old theories called the Doppler Effect. That was long before the understanding of hyper-scape and folding of continuum for easy space transit.
“Not anymore, we aren’t,” Pepper said. She gathered up an armful of her intimate apparel and dumped it into the suitcase.
Dropping down onto the bed, Tony stares up at the ceiling. He can’t make out the details, but he hears the conversation he’d had with Steve only a few days before this horrible day.
“Who will inherit your wealth? Who am I to protect?” Steven turns to him and waits. It’s a challenge.
Before Steve finishes rolling his eyes, the timer rings on the fresh bread in the oven. “Oh I almost forgot. The bread and stew!”
“Loki is a master in chemicals and pharmacopeia. He’s learned a great many things from our mother. He learned young, always impressing the adults in our family. He’s been able to convince many that he has a supernatural, almost magical power because of his abilities,” Thor replies, his shoulder slump. “If the knife was laced with one of Loki’s potions-.”
He should have considered the possibilities of what was happening to him. Was it just greed on his part or did the serum in him change him? Make him need more? Or transform his supernaturality to something else?
“Impossible,” Tony says. “He’s not well, from what I’ve heard. The split from his omega did him in. The final straw as they say.”
The words settle in his brain like an elixir, a healing salve. “Tony?” It’ right – that’s his name. He knows this in his bones.
“An omega bonds first. Don’t give me any crap, Rogers. You know it. You have to bond first,” Tony spits back. He’s no longer looking away. His face is close, so close that the glint of his eyes looks like tears. “Why won’t you bond?”
Tony considered Steve as if he was weighing whether or not Steve might belt him one if he got close enough to study the brand. But Steve didn’t move.  He just stood there with his arm stretched out and the horrible reality of a wrist band revealed on his flesh – his skin that shouldn’t tarnish anymore because of the serum. Tony eyed him once more, and then stepped up and looked at the brand. Nothing really happened. They just stood there.
“But he was in the war?” Clint asks. He still has hearing problems due to the cannon explosion near his perch in a tree as he was scouting.
“You know this seems like an awful lot of work for a short thrill ride.” His legs might not bend as far as Steve wants them to, but he tries.
Steve clears his throat and points toward the front bedroom. “If you don’t mind, I’d like to have this one since it has a different view from the others and the living room. It’ll give me good practice with my sketching.”
“Not sure,” Tony says and climbs to his feet. He checks the controls in the cockpit area of the jet. He flicks a few but nothing happens. “I’m not sure. It has to be you. The cold, the frozen water. It doesn’t make any other sense.”
“Yep, if I remember this it means I was awake.” Steve nodded. “I was, to a certain degree. I remember feelings, images, a few words here and there. It didn’t make sense so in my waking hours I really can’t recall it.”
“I wasn’t one of the advocates for the program. When we got him, he was half insane from the ice. Apparently, he was conscious during the ice and the pain – well the pain drove him over the edge. Even Captain America has his limits, and being in the ice for over 65 years broke him. He spent some time under the care of SHIELD.” Fury opened the folder with the information on Steve. “It isn’t pretty. Nothing could help him.”
Steve kisses and nibbles as he finds his way back to Tony’s chest, to his nipples. He lingers over the metal plate, where Tony’s weak heart is protected. He drags his tongue along it and then goes downward again.
“What the hell does that have to do with keeping the town safe from Schmidt’s Red Skull gang?” Bucky looks not only like he’s about to chew on nails but like he’s had one too many hours in the sun. He’s that hot under the collar.
"Now why would I do that?" He gives Steve's arm a subtle shake. "Looks like me and you are going to be fast friends."
“Breaking the centrifuge was a great way to start.” Bruce gripped the arms of the chair. Steve swore his knuckles turned green instead of white. “I can deal with it. I can.”
Tony nods and selects a breast. He then adds his potato which is still warm to the touch, some salad, and a roll. When he looks over to Steve he sees that he has the other breast, thigh, and two legs in his dish and therefore has no other room for food.
“Natasha,” Tony says. He places the paper bag on the counter and goes to make coffee. “You want some?”
Tony knew that Pepper was having an increasingly difficult time shuffling money his way. Prying eyes kept constant oversight on the Stark fortune. Every few months, Pepper needed to switch off shore accounts and change the route in which he received his funds.
Steve jumps, startled, and places his hand on his chest. The prince appears from the corner of the workshop carrying a heavy structural piece that looks like an arm. He dumps it on the table and leans against the bench, crossing his arms.
The glowing man offers Tony a small tin cup that’s dented on the side. He brings it to Tony’s cracked lips. He tastes the water and it’s divine, perfection, and he wants to cry. It hurts too much to have this kindness, someone here to take care of him. “Who?”
“Now, you say you want more? You want me? I’ve been by your side all this time, but damned within the first few weeks you could have stopped paying me and I would still have been there, Tony. I want to be there. For you. It’s all you. I’m amazed, stymied by your brilliance. I’ve learned so much. And I’ve discovered so much more. You make me a better me.”
“Okay, let’s get it organized then,” Steve said, and Tony knocked Steve’s leg with his knee. Steve only smiled at Tony.
They headed toward the room assigned to Steve. “Be careful what you ask for,” Clint muttered and Tony almost barked out a reply but just as he stared the guard in front of Steve’s room shifted into their path.
When he comes back to himself, Steve’s cleaning him up and then he tidies the room. He tucks away the money his previous client gave him and then smiles at Tony.
"My father's company was built on a war machine, and some don't realize it, but there were indentured servants and slaves in those companies even in the North. The North is not so innocent as it believes."
exactly what to do. It’s not magic, it’s not a mystical soul bond, it’s simply what anyone would do for someone they cared about that’s hurting. He climbs to his feet and stands over Steve, offering him a hand up. For a second Steve only stares at him but then he grabs Tony like a lifeline and accepts the help. Tony knows it’s only a first step, but it’s a step. He scoops up the shield for Steve and then in silent agreement they head back to the house.
“Yes, my fair human. A zombie. This has been tried multiple times in the past and the world has been overrun with mindless undead. They may not look for blood, but they care not what they eat as long as it is fresh, and it is raw.” Thor studied his coven leader. “Why would they do this when they know the consequences, I don’t know.”
He shook his head. “Ask me when it’s over.” They stood in one of the old dam control rooms. It stunk of mold and mildew and the only light was a single bulb hanging from a frayed wire from the ceiling. He heard the trickle of water somewhere off in the distance but ignored it. The dam along a reservoir in rural Virginia was the least of his worries. Spread out before them was what was left of their tactical supplies and Steve’s shield.
“You are my alpha.” Steven slipped from under him and then slowly untied Tony’s robe. He settled between his legs and sucked and lapped at Tony’s cock and balls. Tony should have stopped him, should have done something to interrogate him. But he didn’t. He opened his legs and laid his head back enjoying the ministrations.  He should have pursued their discussion, but desire warred with his rational mind.
“You dislocated it, for sure,” Tony says but looks up to the sky. It’s stopped raining – which is a good thing and a bad thing.  “It’s snowing.”
“Lay still,” Tony says and places a hand on Steve’s shoulder. It isn’t hard but it is demanding. Steve knows even though they are not bonded, he should feel a certain submissiveness to an alpha, especially to a prime alpha. Instead, he feels nothing but his own fears. There’s only a blank emptiness where the urge and need reside. It rips a whole in his gut and he tries not to react, but the hollowness is so vacuous and wide. He gasps.
“Well, you’re going home. With me. And you have no choice.” He shouldn’t seem so gleeful about it. Smug, that’s the word for it. He looks positively smug that Steve is going back to the States to be charged – probably with treason. The thought jabs into his chest hard and fast and he loses the ability to breathe. He was Captain America, and now he’s fallen into that of a traitor.
The wickedness assails him. He feels Tony hover closer as if the horror before them, the feelings of hatred, loathing, and the need to inflict pure unadulterated pain – on his maker. The only way to do that according to the AI – destroy everything that Tony loves, that Tony cares for, that Tony wants to keep safe and sacred.
A particularly hateful worry nags at Tony. “Do you think it would have been this way with someone else. I mean you haven’t been with a man?”
“I get it,” Bruce said. The silence dropped over them and all Steve could hear was the little beeps and the whispered awe of the doctors outside the curtain. He couldn’t stand it.
“And yet you did to try and save the universe from Thanos, did you not? Although you did to sneak Loki off Asgard to avenge me. Do not play games with me, Heimdall. You may see the fabric of space-time and the weaving of souls, but you do not fool me.” Frigga glares at him with piercing eyes.
“So, in other words you’ve been in your rebellious phase all your life.” Steve peers over his shoulder and there’s something cocky, almost swaggering about his expression. He’s teasing Tony to say something out of line.
“What else?” Bucky had asked. Only Sam’s hand on his shoulder stopped him from lunging forward and dragging the information out of the bounty hunter. They all knew Natasha to be one of the more respectable hunters in the galaxy but the idea that she stood there and did nothing to help Steve rankled Bucky to his core.
Steve shakes his head as he retrieves towels and robes for them. “Let’s go to the main room and put on the projection.” He offers Tony a towel who takes a second before accepting it and getting out of the bath. “We can have JARVIS project the beach at night.”
They came at night, they came during the day. They came always. They surrounded and overwhelmed. They became every moment of every breath taken. They were life and death and the hell in between.
Tony scowls but follows the doctor’s orders. Steve watches and tries to be dispassionate and disconnected but he fails miserably in the first seconds as Strange removes Tony’s glasses. He hands them back to Steve who has to jump up and take them from the doctor. Tony sits, his body tightly closed, curled over itself. His shoulders hunch forward and he crosses his legs at the ankles.
Steve ignores her and claws his way up the hill, but the gravel shifts and moves like grains of sand down a dune. He needs two hands and that means putting the shield on his back. He grunts and locks the shield in place. The backpack secured against this shoulder as well. He digs into the gravel with his hands and kicks into the side of the hill with the metal toes of his boots. Starting to climb up the hillside, he disregards the badgering sounds of Clint’s begging. It isn’t Clint. He knows that but his heart loops in his chest and his gut twists. Partially up the hill, he hears the familiar whine of the gauntlet charging. His attention snaps to the top of the hill as Tony targets and fires at Laura. She drops like a rock.
“I don’t know,” Steve says and hitches a shoulder. It hurts and he hisses. “I wasn’t supposed to be here, on Earth, when my transformation happened. No one is supposed to transform on Earth.”
“What does that mean?” Tony asks and he tries to quell the frustration – his natural instinct and his response due to his own upbringing and his nature. He succeeds.
He tries to deny the ridiculous scenario when Stane puts a finger on Steve’s lips. “Oh don’t worry, don’t worry at all. Tony told me everything.” His fingers drift lower to cup Steve’s chin while his thumb plays along Steve’s lower lip. “He eased my fears about you, told me you’re from the Widow’s Brothel.” He smiles and bends closer, his breath hot on Steve’s face. “Maybe when this is all over, and I have some time, I can come and visit you too. Might be nice to have you under me, ass in the air, taking it all.” With his other hand, Stane adjusts the crotch of his pants. “You haven’t had a real cock until you have mine. I tip generously.”
Steve must drift off as he rolls ideas around in his head because the next time, he arises he’s starving, and the food is cold. He eats some of the crackers and fruits, leaving the once hot plates alone. He quickly goes to the bathroom, cleans up and then ties the robe on again. He notices that flood in the bathroom is gone and everything is in order. Did people come in while he was sleeping and just clean up? It’s kind of creepy.
“What? No!” Bruce scowled. “Not at all. It’s images and feelings. Not much else. Except I did get something – a little bit of a word transfer when we bonded.”
Curiosity piqued, Tony went to Steve’s side and watched as he spread out pages and pages of a file. Most of the text was in Russian, but along the margins someone scribbled translations.
“Yes, it has, Blu,” Tony whispers. His hands are on Steve’s hands. He loves the feel of his beard, the intensity of his blue blue eyes.
“It goes all the way to your chest if that’s what you’re looking at,” Sam said. “This one is his, isn’t it?” Sam pointed to the lone one – the solitary one.
“Okay. I can’t say I love it. Having Steve here really helps. He can paint what things look like with his words. You can tell he’s an artist,” Tony says.
“I don’t know,” Steve said. He shrugged. He didn’t pick the word; it just bubbled out of his mouth. “I just- I don’t know.”
“I’m not frightened,” Steve said. Tony tried not to frown at that obvious lie. Steve must have read his doubt. He squeezed Tony’s hand. “Okay, maybe I am. But not in the way you think. I’m not frightened of who I am. I’m not frightened of being myself, anymore.” Steve chanced to look at Tony. His eyes glistened with excitement, at the challenge. Though Tony also caught a slight sliver of fear.
Further down, Tony sees that Steven still wears what Tony calls the cock belt. It locks around Steven’s balls, keeping them stretched slightly. On a normal day like today, Tony kept the stretch uncomfortable but livable. On the other hand, Steven’s cock has been held in the flaccid position so that he may relief himself but not get hard. Even now, Tony spots the purple of the head of his cock as it strains against the metal shaft around it keeping it in place. Steven’s bare feet are in the gully around the pole, locked and spread wide. With that position, Tony can easily access his ass and the gully compensates for the height difference.
After the alpha sits on the bed next to him. They haven’t cuddled. Steve’s been whipped, paddled, controlled, but there’s been no warmth to their interactions. Yet, the alpha still looks on him with kind eyes.
Steve gambles then, he fumbles to sit up and fold his one wing. It hurts, but he reaches out and pulls Tony toward him. His mouth is on Tony’s before he can say anything, and he’s tasting and nipping at him. The slide of tongues and the fact that Tony’s hands press Steve closer tells him everything he needs to know. He wants Tony, he wants the bond to grow, to strengthen and be Absolute.
“You don’t want to take the chance of having an omega,” Steven says. “That would be embarrassing.” He doesn’t look at Tony as he states this only walks over to the bed area. It isn’t a place Tony finds that he wants the omega to frequent.
“Ultron doesn’t know everything. Not everything,” Steve says softly, as if stating it will make it true. He decides the best way forward lies in the next step. Sometimes when faced with a war, planning the next battle is all you can do. “How many more rims?”
Erskine pats Steve’s shoulder. “Perhaps, someday, there will be a place for you. Someday there might be a chance for you.” He wanders off muttering to himself.
After they held one another. Tony knew it wasn’t their last day, or their last moments together. They built a foundation. A strong and stable one.
“Check on him, now,” Tony ordered and went to the bathroom. He finished up and then washed his hands and threw water on his face as JARVIS reported back.
Steve narrows his eyes at Tony but says nothing about it in return. He pulls Tony back into the small, wooded area as if it will lend cover to prying artificial intelligence. “I think we stick with the plan. We can’t get out of here, we have to get to the inner Hub to exit.”
Bucky only shares a quiet look with Sam. He’s got that damned bird that follows him around all over the place sitting on his shoulder with a small leather hood over its head. Redwing has been Sam’s companion for years and Scholar Peggy has confessed that the bird is Force sensitive and that’s why Sam bonded to it so well. As he stands watching his friend, the world explodes around them. The ship rocks and lurches as it’s struck again and again. Bucky holds onto the strap as Sam swings and grabs onto Bucky.  Redwing flutters its wings. They don't have any other air support. Clint has to get them in or as close as he can and then fly off to hide in the asteroid belt of the Gavinian Systems.
“You have to stop, Tony,” Pepper had said, her expression destroyed by the many marks on his armor. “You’re going to get yourself killed.”
It disrupts their connection, dislodging Tony from him. He doesn’t seem to care, the prince devours him, pushing away the wires and circuit boards and tec-crystals as he explores Steve’s mouth, his neck, his nipples. Steve becomes the instrument to be played by the prince and he knows he colors, blushes a deep desirous red. Tony searches over his flesh as if looking for anywhere he may have missed and then his spreads Steve wide, pauses only a moment to push the head of his cock against Steve’s entrance and then thrusts in with a thunderous growl.
“If soul packs are possible, we all changed, Captain. Everyone within the time loop changed. The only one who didn’t was me,” Strange said and stood up. “Now I must take my leave. Good luck, and good day.”
speech, Steve might actually puke on him. “I’m not going to give you anything, Clint. Nothing. You betrayed your mate. You betray-.”
He rushed over to her then, grasping her hands and holding them to his chest. “Don’t listen to me. That’s semantics. I love you. Pepper, please. Don’t do this to us.”
The jerk and tug of his attacker had caused Tony to slip against the cracked glass and one of the sharp fragments of glass sliced into him. He screamed. He used his fist to pound Bucky but there was no stopping him. With eyes focused only on Tony, Bucky glared at Tony and with a snarl yelled, "Hurt him, you all hurt him. Stop now!"
“Well not technically. It’s called the vivarium. But us guards we have our own lingo.” He gave them a toothy smile and Tony clenched his jaw. Just what the hell had his father been experimenting with. Tony knew of his fascination with the super soldier serum, and his quest to replicate it. Did he actually do it? Did his collaborations with the Soviets lead to some hybrid animal pumped up full with super soldier serum and blasted with vita rays.
A cold blast hits them and then hail rains down on them, pelleting and bruising. Steve rips the shield off his back and hauls Tony toward him. Arms linked; they race for the cover of the trees. An angry cry fills the air threatening to burst Steve’s eardrums. He stumbles but Tony forces him to stay upright. They make it to the tree line as the Door in the distance completely fades.
“What do you want to do, Steve?” Tony asked. “Do you want to fight the good fight alone or do you want this pack? Because I think we come as a package deal.”
“Well, Mister Rogers, because of the ruse Mister Stark has insisted on continuing for all of these years and has forced many of us to sign documents in order to give him care, I am not allowed to bring him to a local hospital. I need to fly him to New York where he maintains and pays for the clinic where we first met.” He presses down on his too ornate jacket. “You may say I’m a sell out that I signed the non-disclosure and agreed to this ridiculous farce for money. You would only be half right. I use the money to maintain my clinic that offers state of the art care at a fraction of the price of other hospitals and clinics. With the state of health care in this country, it is the least I can do.”
“Christ,” Tony says and drops his fork. He reaches across the table and grasps Steve’s hand. “I’m sorry you had to go through that. After the war there’s a lot to be done-.”
Tony stops her as he starts to yank off all the wires. “The Pentagon will update SHIELD. They have top brass on it right now. In the meantime, I’m going to take my husband home. If you need me, please contact my personal assistant.” Steve gets out of bed, but he’s only in a hospital gown. “Can someone get him some clothes?”
“Yes.” Internally, Steve grapples, desperately trying to gather the pieces of their afternoon as they all slip away.
“Yeah, don’t you think? We could do it now and then you could – you know – go with the rest of the team and get them all selected.” The way Tony stood in the bland apartment, expectant, made the brown seem not so dull and earthy. It also irritated Steve.
“Maybe,” Steve said and longed to see Tony. He needed him, needed to hold him, to know what they’d built hadn’t been destroyed by what had happened. How could Tony ever forgive him for not explaining what Ross and his lackies did to captured vampires on the rooftop of the Triskelion? He’d never confessed that he’d seen it. The horror of it haunted him; his imagination gave him a clear idea of what had happened to Tony. “Why do the Divini hide?”
“I just think it would be healthy for you to get out of here, breathe fresh, planet side air instead of this recycled crap, get a little sun on your face because seriously pal you look a little vampirish.”
“It’s not a big deal Sam. I don’t even know why I said that. I just work with the guy like 24/6. It’s a lot of one on one time, so my drunk brain latched onto it. It’s fine. I’m fine.” He throws his one arm over his eyes. Maybe he doesn’t want to face the world right now.
“Tony? Steve Rogers is here to see you about the offer,” Pepper says. She steps out of the way and allows Steve to enter before she closes the door. Standing behind Steve, Pepper gestures to Tony. He’s never been good with reading ambiguous sign language, especially now.
“There’s no reason to pout about it. I still have the will to live, I’m not like some gazelle that just gives up, you know. And any way lionesses are the ones who hunt, you just lay around and look regal,” Tony says. He’s testing his luck, talking to a lion, but then again, the animal has no idea what the hell Tony’s is saying. “Whatever, you don’t know what the hell I’m saying.”
“That’s just it, you can’t,” Tony muttered, and he glared at Steve. “You’re going to die. All of you are going to die. Just like my mother died.”
“It’s an omega. More difficult than a ship” she says and wrinkles her pert little nose again. If they hadn’t been like brother and sister he might have fallen for her years ago.
Logan shakes his head. “I’m sorry to tell you, bub, but the truth is he’s both. He’s in that reality and this one and it fucks us all up. And it seems like you might be in both too.”
“Extermination,” Natasha said. “It’s an easy way to say they have to do it. You have to understand that some of the families of vamps are happy to have them still alive. They have their loved ones but they’re vampires. It’s okay with them. They don’t want to see their loved ones wiped out. That’s a small minority, but vocal enough that they have to do this subtly.”
He'd wanted to scream and fight but the Scholars of the Jedi order taught him as well as the younglings.
“But he did, didn’t he?” The voice wasn’t his mother’s. He didn’t place it. Disorientation grew but he blinked away the tears as the woman continued, “You were strong – strong to keep fighting for life. And he was there, and he stopped them. Didn’t he? Tony – your mate – stopped them.”
“Yeah don’t worry. Turning into a mindless zombie isn’t on my to do list.” He gave her a quick peck on the cheek. Her warmth and loveliness a fragrant bloom against his cooler cheek. She looked at him in the eye which she rarely did anymore. His preternatural eyes disarmed people. He knew that. It was part of the glamour myth of vampires.
“Holy shit,” Tony murmured, and the nurse only frowned before she walked away. He took in his surroundings. A ward of dying patients. It looked like something out of the movies, from the early part of the last century, the 1930s. The beds were metal framed, the blankets were white and thin. Along with the nurse he just talked to nuns in white walked amongst the beds, taking care of the dying, offering comfort. Some sat down on little white stools next to the beds to say a Rosary along with the patient. Windows, over large, with clean panes, looked out to a courtyard below that Tony couldn’t discriminate the details. A bird, maybe a hawk, flew in the sky close to the windows. It opened its mouth to caw, but Tony never heard its voice.
Tony taps his way out of the suite of rooms. Steve waits a good five minutes to ensure that Tony doesn’t back track for anything. He jumps up and finds his phone in the backpack that someone must have dropped in the corner of the bedroom. He presses the icon for Sam.
“Well then, let’s see it.” That was Hawkeye who still hung back in the room in the shadows as if he didn’t want to be seen or spoken to – Steve could understand the archer had a difficult road ahead of him after Loki’s mind invasion.
“This whole situation,” Steve says and manages to walk over to the workbench without keeling over- he counts it as a win. Thank you, Fury, for all the bruises and the residual pain from the wing wounds.
“Well, it’s Vision,” Steve confirms and rubs at his face hoping the heat of his embarrassment fades quickly and cannot be seen in the low lighting of the corridor. “Tell us.”
“I don’t think he deserves one,” Ross replied but never took his eyes off Pierce. In that moment, Steve caught the subtle changes in his face, how his brows furrowed just slightly, how his hands fisted, how his mouth turned downward. They didn’t like one another. They were enemies thrown together on a common cause. They were competitors.
“That’s big of you,” Tony said and he couldn’t keep the tiny bit of snark out of his response. Thankfully, Bruce ignored it or wasn’t aware enough of Tony’s character to identify when he wasn’t being sincere.
“Sir, I understand you’ve come to inspect 18704.” He offered his hand for Tony to shake but Pepper took it instead.
Tony hears the click of the collar remote being activated before the results are apparent. The lion howls but doesn’t stop his attack. His massive claws out, he slices at the Hunter’s belly. But the shock collar hits him hard and his misses, fumbling chin first to the ground, shaking from the pain. It’s the one moment Tony has to act, and he fires the repulsors, hitting the henchman squarely in the chest. It should have knocked him on his ass – it does, but not before he’s able to snake the whip out for one last strike.
“They have different issues. The trial is really for brain cancer. It’s not for this at all. We were going to modify the virotherapy specifically for Stark,” Wong says. “It was a shot in the million.”
The man bows like he’s talking to royalty and Steve looks around. The strange man leaves the barn and heads into the back room. He announces Steve to Stark and Banner.
“Steve,” Peggy said quietly. Her hand lightly brushed his arm but did not stay. “You can live here peacefully and no one will think anything of it. No one will think poorly of you. You deserve some peace and some safety. But if you decide that it isn’t enough, if you decide that you have fight left in you, then we’re here for you. We’re waiting. We want to change things. We’re not going to settle again. This is the beginning, not the end. This is the start of it.”
Unguarded, Steve showed exposed gratitude to Tony, but more than that it spread out to the bond between them and only them. It fastened them together and began to stitch something different, something unexpected between them.
“Let’s see if they’ll let you in,” Bruce said. He sounded reasonable, but a flush of green over his cheeks stopped Tony.
“Weird. It’s all weird.” Tony crinkles his forehead. His headache blasts like some of the heavy metal music he listens to while working. He pushes the tightness constricting his eye sockets away and asks, “What kind of weird questions?”
“Steve. You never call me, Steve.” It’s wrong to bring up such a petty grievance when their whole plan is hell bent on ripping itself apart. He finds he doesn’t care. He wants to throw that out into the wind and watch it get torn into shreds by Tony.
“I want to, I thought,” Steve started and then blurted it out. “I pretended for so long. Even to myself. I pretended it was because of my size and my illness that I wasn’t attracted. I pretended it was because of the war. I even pretend now. I lie to myself that I can’t find anyone because of shared life experiences. It’s a nice lie that secures me and I don’t have to face the fact.”
“You are not having motherly feelings about me, Stark,” Natasha hissed but never looked back as they made their way through the medbay. Clint snorted. Tony frowned but cleared out his head. He was surprised she read his feelings so concisely.
Steve had barely been conscious when it happened. He fought to remember, to pull up the images of the Helicarrier. The cold look of Bucky standing in front of him came first and it quaked through him like an avalanche. Every moment of the battle came back to him in horrible relief. He hadn’t wanted to fight Bucky. When Bucky finally shot him, Steve knew it was the end – and part of him didn’t care. Part of him died right then and there. When he’d gotten a chance to try and claim Bucky again, bring him back to himself, show him the way, Steve latched onto it. Every move had sent spikes of pain through him, but it was worth it.
“We have to step through at the same time.” Tony puts his hand out and captures Steve’s. “Let’s go.”
“Steve Rogers,” he scoffs. “He said he was a relative or something. I didn’t think Captain America had any children, did you?” At this he looks up at her and she only silently shakes her head. “He came and he helped me. Helped me with this.” Tony taps the arc reactor. “We built it together. The plan was to get out together. But he was stupid and sacrificed himself, for me. Who would do that? Sacrifice themselves for me?”
“I was never good at memorizing them,” Steve had said. “I knew the big dipper and the little dipper but that was it.”
“You keep swearing but all I am seeing is you disappearing and coming back bruised up and bloodied.”
“I mean I literally bit you and we mated without your consent. The kids these days would be all over us because of it,” Tony said. He knew he was just tossing about other subjects to talk about other than the impending meeting with Ross. Tony both wanted to know and hated the idea of finding out what the cretin wanted.
Steve could handle that. “I’m the leader, but you already knew that. Bruce is the Healer of the group. Nat is in the position of Confidant while Sam here is our Companion. Clint has the classic position of Sentinel. Peggy, who is now in London, is our Guide. Tony is Beloved.” Strange quirked a brow at Steve but didn’t comment. “We have three more members. Bucky Barnes is Brother, and the two others-.”
