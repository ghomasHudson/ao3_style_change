Benny laughs, leaning over so his mouth is just inches from Dean’s ear. “We were hoping you might want to come back and celebrate Christmas with us.”
“No,” Cas says, firmly. “But, I did find you puking on Benny’s shoes as we scooped you into the cab fairly amusing.”
Dean would be lying if he said some of the displays weren’t a turn on. But that still doesn’t mean he’s going to hang around.
Dean swallows back his irritated groan. With supreme effort, he manages to produce what he thinks is a generously polite response. “Thanks, but I don’t think that’s a good idea, dude.”
“That is not what we want at all,” Cain snarls. Cas and Benny both fall unnaturally silent, and the smell in the car turns sour enough that Dean has to crack open a window. Even he has enough sense to shut the hell up and not exacerbate the situation after that. He’s pissed off everyone enough for one night.
“He used your abduction as PR for his movie,” Cas continues, slamming a pan down unnecessarily violently on the stove top. “You nearly died and he profited from it.”
Dean nods silently and stands up too. He doesn’t know what to say. This is gonna take a bit of time to get his head around.
“Thankfully, I have developed some immunity to Mr. Carstairs’ home-brew over the past few years. Can I get you anything? Water? Tylenol? A bucket?”
Marv stops mid-word and turns his scathing glare on Dean. “I’m sorry? Did you want something, Winchester?”
“I was going to make hummus,” Cas growls. “In future, I’d appreciate it if you did not touch my things.”
About the only thing he will remember is the stunned expression on Cas’ face when Dean marches up to him, yelling like a madman.
“Not now, Sam. Look, can you call Cas and tell him I’m fine? Tell him to grab some sleep and I’ll see him tonight. They’ll be waiting for me in wardrobe.”
“We’re not joined at the hip, y’know,” Dean snaps. “He has more important things to do than babysit my ass, Sammy.”
Benny slings his arm around Dean’s shoulders and steers him towards a couple of tables that have been pushed together in the corner of the bar. There are a dozen or so people hanging around, definitely too many for Dean to remember all their names after Benny introduces them. He does recognize a few faces; Gordon, Benny’s partner at the gym, Carmen and Stevie, two of the trainers, and a couple of people he’s seen working out regularly. Thankfully they seem like a friendly bunch, helped no-doubt by the fact they’re already a few drinks down and enthusiastically tucking into dishes of chicken wings and nachos.
Pissed, Dean tries to shrug Crowley’s hand off his arm, but Crowley doesn’t budge, holds on tighter instead, drags him closer, so there’s no chance of being overheard. “You were brilliant today, but you’re on edge, darling, twitchy. You have issues coming out of the wazoo. You always have. It’s what makes you such a standout actor; all those nasty emotions pent up inside of you looking for an escape route. Acting is your therapy. Now, don’t get me wrong, normally this works out great for me, and for you. And the movie-going public. That’s how Oscars are won and box office profits are made. But I think you’re balanced right on the edge this time, and I don’t see anyone reaching out to pull you back. You’re going to snap, Dean. And after all this time, after a lifetime of nasty little traumas... it’s not going to be pretty.”
Cas sighs, opens his eyes and glares at him. “I’m trying not to climb on top of you and lick the sweat from your skin. If you could give me a moment to regain my composure it would be appreciated.”
Dean wriggles his butt backwards against Cas’s crotch. Two can play the teasing game. Cas’s hand drops to his hips holding him firmly in place. “I think we should perhaps leave before you torture me any further with all this naked skin and your ass in those leather pants.”
Idris smirks. “Sweetheart, the only department that the Red Hood threatens Batman in is the walking bow-legged department. Let me tell you, that kid walks like he’s been...”
He thinks about bumming a cigarette from one of the smokers hanging around by the door just so he has something to concentrate on other than the thought of Cas hooking up with someone
Dean would be relieved to hear that if Gordon didn’t take his car keys out of his pocket as he said it.
“That’s what I wanted, Sam, and honestly if I’d known I would have to listen to this bullshit I’d never have come despite your whining.”
“Then what’s stopping you from getting back out there and meeting new people? Dating? You’re young-ish, free, and single.”
Caught in his thoughts, Dean startles, jumping in his seat. He glances up to see Castiel Novak smirking back down at him. It figures the next person to arrive would be the one that Dean least wants to spend time alone with.
“Dude,” Dean says, grabbing another bottle of beer. “You’re at a Den. That is essentially an omega supermarket for alphas.”
“No, Dean,” Crowley laughs. “I knew that you were like me. That you’re not interested in doing what society expects even if you’re trying to convince yourself you are. There’s not an alpha out there for you, Dean. Because you don't really want one.”
Dean hums thoughtfully. Lisa and Meg already own a chain of gyms that stretches from one side of the country to the other. As well as having their brand name stamped on protein bars, slimming shakes, and a range of eye-poppingly bright gym wear. There’s surely not much expansion left for them to do.
“Language,” Dean scolds automatically, sitting down on a stool at the kitchen island and attempting to open the bottle with one hand.
Dean ignores her. He isn’t saying any of this for her benefit. “I know you’re mad right now, Sammy, but don’t go throwing her to the wolves too quick. She is your mom. Elle’s grandmother. Our blood. Whether I like it or not. Maybe working with her rather than against her might be an idea. I mean, we don’t even know how Marv found out about her? How he knew she was in town. It doesn’t make a lick of sense. And who sent her the email with your address in the first place, Sam? Someone out there is playing games.”
Cas’s jaw is set to stubborn but when Dean turns on every lash-fluttering, pouty-lipped charm he possesses, he relents with a barely concealed huff. “Fine. But security is sticking by your side all day.”
Cas’s fingers squeeze his shoulder, his eyes radiating calm. “Do you want me to pull you out of here?”
Dean scowls. “Charlie landed that AD gig in Vancouver. You shouldn’t have dragged her back into our shit.”
His stormy exit takes longer and is less dramatic than is satisfying. He needs to open the garage door and the security gates, and Cas dogs him the entire time, but eventually Dean peels away from the house with a squeal of rubber. Leaving behind all his security, the two paps he caught napping in their cars outside his front gate... and Cas.
Dean chokes on his vodka. Cas slaps his back until he stops coughing. “You’re shitting me! You were going to become a priest? What the fuck happened?”
“I’ve had half a bottle of beer, Cas, that’s it. I know you and Sam think I’m drowning my feelings in liquor but I’m not a damn idiot. And I told you, I’m done talking. You want to chat so bad, maybe you should call Sam.” Dean yanks on the helmet, and flips down the visor so Cas’s reply is muffled.
Oblivious to Dean’s mounting irritation, Debbie blithely carries on. “Pastor Uriel’s brother Raphael, he’s an alpha too, is married to the most darling omega. She’s a tiny little thing. They’ve been mated two years now and have three adorable babies. Omegas really are terribly fertile, aren’t they? Even male ones so I hear? I hope you’ll be popping out lots of lovely babies if you’re lucky enough to lure Uriel in with your… charms. You are rather unusual for an omega, aren’t you, bless your soul.”
It’s a few days later when Cas makes his next move. Dean walks into the kitchen to find him standing in front of the refrigerator… buck naked.
Sam doesn’t stay much longer. Not once he figures out that Dean’s done with the topic of conversation. Cas sees him out while Dean finds a dustpan and brush to clear up the mess of glass spread across the floor. He’s cleaning whisky and the last tiny specks of glass up with a paper towel when Cas comes back. He takes the napkin from Dean’s hand and throws it in the trash, before tugging him into a hug. He doesn’t let go until Dean finally relaxes in his arms, his head drooping onto Cas’s shoulder.
“Mm, feisty, I like it,” the woman says, crowding in against Dean. Dean backs away until the wall is behind him and he can’t get any further.
Cas glares at him. “Maybe not, but cracking your head against the edge of the table on the way down certainly did the job.”
Thankfully, the grounds of Fairdale are expansive, at least a few acres, and honestly even Dean can admit they’re beautiful. Dean hasn’t had a chance to explore the whole area yet, but so far he’s found a pond, a vegetable garden and a couple of beehives. Even though the temperature is cool, some brave and hardy flowers still manage to bring a splash of color to the wilder areas of the garden, and they go a tiny way towards lifting Dean’s spirits.
Cas smiles, wolfish, sets down his coffee, grabs Dean’s hand instead and tugs him in the direction of their bathroom. Dean puts up exactly zero resistance. It’s good to slip back to normal. Even if there are still issues hiding just below the surface of their gentle teasing.
Benny chuckles, his spring water eyes sparkling. “I’m sure you could, brother. You look pretty scrappy.”
He’s paging through a book named very imaginatively, “A History of Omega Rights in America” when his date strides into the room.
“Before... before Alastair,” Dean gets out. “I could still pretend that I had a normal life, y’know. I wasn’t constantly looking over my shoulder. And Sam wasn’t so on edge. I always thought that when he was gone, we’d be able to go back to normal. To some kind of normal anyway. But even now that he’s no longer a threat, that we don’t
Which is true. Lisa wants Meg and Dean wants… well, he’s not entirely sure he’s ready to admit what he wants just yet, but he sure as hell isn’t going to listen to anyone badmouth Cas.
Dean blinks up at Cas. That’s a lot of information to make sense of. His mind was stuck on the bad idea thing until Cas mentioned the fucking Alfie thing and he’s only just catching up to the feelings thing when Cas kisses him again.
Dean shifts awkwardly in his seat. He does not want to have this discussion. And definitely not in public.
The more Dean reads, the sicker he feels. He should know all this already, and sure he’s heard horror stories but he thought they were just that… stories. He‘d had no idea how widespread the maltreatment of omegas had been before the advancement of medicine had given them the choice of using blockers and suppressants. The need for an Omega Welfare Service makes far more sense now. Even if, in Dean’s experience, they are a bunch of assholes.
“Well, now, it ain’t just that pretty ass I’m interested in.” Gunner licks his lips, his eyes blatantly focused on Dean’s mouth.
Dean glares up at Benny. He hasn’t seen the security chief since the day he’d arrived. He doubts it’s coincidence that he’s seeing him now.
The ride home in the car is tense. Silent. No one had said a word since they left the studios. Cas is right, it wasn’t the time or place for the conversation. But the car ride also gives Dean time to stew. Time for his thoughts to run wild.
“Indeed,” Cain interrupts, from beside them. “We may have won Dean around with our charm and good looks, but it was my apple pie that really sealed the deal.”
“Of course, Sam,” Cas says, patting Dean consolingly on the butt, before he turns around. “At least this drama has given us an opportunity to spend some time together. It’s far too long since we’ve had a chance to see Elle and Jess.”
Dean holds his palms up in surrender. “Okay. I get it. I mean, I don’t think the movie-going public or Idris will agree but...”
He sits down on the coffee table in front of Cas so their knees are almost brushing, peels off his leather gloves and sets them down beside him.
Lisa kicks off her shoes and sits down at the opposite side of the sofa, curling her legs underneath her. She’s beautiful, Dean thinks mournfully. Twenty years since he first set eyes on her at a rough-as-hell biker bar just outside the college campus and she’s more beautiful than ever. He takes a drink.
Anyway, between them they fixed the house up pretty damn nicely if Dean does say so himself. After all the work he poured into the place, Dean has a huge soft spot for it. If pushed he’ll admit he likes it far more than their main house which he’d always thought was too stuffy and definitely more to Lisa’s tastes than his. The beach house is far more relaxed. Dean, Lisa, and Ben spent some fun family weekends here.
Cas wraps his arms tighter around Dean’s waist, skims his teeth across the back of Dean’s neck. “You smelled beautiful. You smelled like us.”
“Fuck,” Dean says, squinting at his watch to see it’s almost 4 in the morning. Christmas morning. “It’s Christmas.”
Dean’s not some dainty helpless omega but Uriel is a solid guy, and has the advantage of possessing an alpha’s strength. Dean bucks and swings wildly, but his struggles only succeed in infuriating Uriel more. There’s no one on the street to help or hear Dean’s shouts. Uriel hauls Dean down an alleyway to the side door of the church.
Reading his mind perfectly, Cas gently offers a suggestion. “Perhaps a break might be worth considering. I think we could all use a vacation. Some time to relax and recharge.”
Dean blanches. That’s one alpha he never wants to see again. Creepy weirdo. And to make matters worse, mind-numbingly boring too.
Sam scowls right back. “Charlie’s our friend. She cares about you. She wanted to help. Anyway, Charlie looked into it, tracked her down. Cas’s guys helped too.”
Cas chuckles as he kicks off his shoes, stripping out of his jacket and throwing it over the back of a kitchen chair. “You didn’t. It was a fun evening.”
Dean and Gordon both look up to see Cas standing over them. Outwardly, he looks just as calm as he always does, but Dean knows Cas well enough by now to see the tension in his jaw and the bright flare of anger in his eyes.
Dean nods, tilts his head to accept a kiss from Cas, and tries not to feel strangely abandoned when he strides away, purpose in every step and anger in the iron rod of his spine.
Cas slaps the back of Dean’s head, before draping his arm around his shoulders. “No, you’re not. And I don’t like it when you put yourself down like that. You’re the best person I know.”
“Dean,” Cas says, and he’s not laughing, not even a tiny bit as he escorts Dean to his trailer. “I’m angry that you lied to me. I’m angry that you thought you
Dean wakes to the smell of coffee brewing, his head is pounding thanks to the bottle of whisky he consumed, and his back is locked in a spasm thanks to the fact he appears to have spent the night on the kitchen floor.
Cas doesn’t try to argue, trusting Dean to know his own limits. He squeezes Dean’s shoulder again and then steps back. He doesn’t retreat further than he has to, stays right on the stage at Dean’s back. Dean can’t say that he minds.
“Available? I’m not a hooker. I’m not for sale, or rent.” Dean shoots back, unable to hide his rising temper. “Your buddy, Zachariah, ain’t got no right to make promises like that.”
Dean’s search for a new gym has not gone as smoothly as he’d imagined it would. Maybe it’s because, weirdly, nowhere has felt quite as welcoming as a gym his (ex)wife owns. Or maybe it’s because he’s forty-years-old and more in danger of developing love handles than a six-pack. He doesn’t want to work out next to teenagers who don’t even exercise hard enough to sweat and instead spend most of their time posting selfies to Instagram.
“You don’t even know me, Cas,” Dean says, unable to hold Cas’ gaze, his eyes straying down to the alphas lips instead which is probably a mistake because they are very distracting. “You don’t know that I’m any of those things.”
And Cas can be a scary son of a bitch when he wants to be. Even if he tries not to let Dean see it. Behind his boyfriend’s yoga-loving facade lies a steel core. And a possessiveness that Dean laughs at, but secretly finds hot as hell. Part of him does wish that Cas was here right now, glaring at Marv the Moron like he’s secretly planning how to kill him and dispose of the body. But... yeah, if Dean has his way Cas isn’t allowed back on set until after the Joker’s killed Jason Todd, again.
“I’m not finished,” Sam scowls at him, forehead scrunching up like a damn accordion. “I still think you were an ass to Mom.”
Dean cautiously half opens one eye. Cas, looking freshly showered and unfairly hangover-free, is staring down at him with coffee in his hand. Dean knows his hangover is going to be a bad one when the smell of coffee makes his stomach turn.
Sam huffs, but no way is Dean missing a chance to needle him about his hair. And if it helps break some of the godawful tension... job done.
here. Dean always swore he would never be like John Winchester but right at this moment, he’s like a carbon copy of the guy.
Dean inhales deeply, exhales, and stops for a second to take stock of how he’s feeling. Okay, he thinks. He’s actually feeling okay. Maybe even bordering on happy. Possibly even a little excited. Right, time to rein himself back in. Excited and happy aren't emotions that work out well for Dean. This little experiment is bound to come crashing down around him soon.
Cas shoots him a dirty look that Dean doesn’t think he deserves. “This is one of Meg’s favorite movies.”
There are no two ways about it… Cas is hot. Dean always knew this objectively. It’s impossible to miss. And of course, he’s seen Cas half-naked and actually naked enough times over the past few months to confirm that the guy is as toned and fit as Dean always suspected. And packing a particularly impressive package too. Up until now, Dean has always been too focused on the fact that Cas is an annoying asshole to let his toned abs, ridiculously blue eyes, and sex-hair affect him. Or so he tells himself.
“What’s wrong, Dean?” Crowley asks. Dean would say his tone is teasing but that’s too kind for the smug pull at the corner of his lips. “Is this not your scene? I thought you’d visited a club or two in your time.”
Whatever argument Cas had dries on his tongue. He looks at Dean with an expression so tender Dean can barely stand it. Thankfully it only lasts a few seconds before he looks away, and finally, turns the key in the ignition.
But Garth is already on his way out the door. “Two o’clock Dean, don’t be late and don’t forget your smile. No one likes a sour puss.”
The sun lounger groans, Cas pants, and Dean whimpers with every thrust. Cas’s face flushes red, sweat dripping down his hairline onto Dean’s chest.
“You,” Marv yells, storming onto set, his stumpy legs eating up the distance unusually quickly. “This is all your fault!”
Despite his protestations to the contrary, he hasn’t socialized much, or at all, since Lisa kicked his ass to the curb. Unless you count his phone calls with Blanche, or their neighbors plying him with sweet tea and lemonade when he calls round to fix the latest thing they’ve broken.
“Did you tell him what scenes you were shooting today?” Sam shoots back, sounding more like the snotty teenage brat he was a decade ago, rather than the grown man he is now.
Instead of asking him why his parents never sat him down and explained his biology to him, or why his doctor never did, or why Dean never got a damn book out from the library and figured this shit out for himself, Charlie simply nods and gives him the Cliff notes.
It took him a while to make it to the club. He had an address and vague directions from Crowley but he wasn’t that sure what he was looking for, so it was past midnight by the time he eventually stepped through the door.
Sam sounds so fucking forlorn that Dean’s heart almost breaks. This… this right here, is the reason that Dean almost requested another extension when he got his latest invitation to attend the Den. Another year, hell, another six months and Sam will be gone. Graduated, grown up and finding his feet at college. Stanford by the looks of things.
Dean rolls his eyes at Cas’ formality but smiles too. “Truce,” he agrees, shaking Cas’ hand. “As long as you at least attempt to put your dirty dishes in the dishwasher.”
Cain smooths his hand down Dean’s back, keeping him tucked in tight. “As for Zachariah and Ellen, that is not something you should be concerned about.”
He’s not about to tell Dad any of this though, because Dad smells like he’s downed a bottle of Jack. This is not the time to provoke him.
Dean beelines for the sofa when he’s safely inside, collapsing onto his back with a relieved sigh. When he looks up Sam’s staring down at him with a constipated expression on his face. Given all the fiber he eats, Dean doubts his brother-slash-manager-slash-lawyer-slash-big brooding pain in the ass, is actually constipated which can only mean one thing; he’s about to bitch Dean out.
“You’re having breakfast?” Cas quirks an eyebrow. “That’s a minor miracle these days. Just how long have you been awake for?”
“Zachariah,” Cas says, edging just in front of Dean so he’s standing between them. Dean almost shivers with how cold Cas’ voice has turned. He barely sounds like the same alpha. “I see you’re enjoying Ellen’s hospitality once again.”
“That’s not what I said,” Sam snaps, more in frustration than anger. Dean hears him take a deep breath before he continues. “And it’s definitely not what I meant. Look, why don’t you come out here and stay for a while. You know Eileen and I would love to have you.”
“I want details,” she says, undeterred. “I know you. And I know something’s going on. Garth set you up yesterday, did you meet someone?”
Dean hasn’t been allowed near the bedroom yet. Cain was adamant they should eat and talk before Dean’s heat took a proper hold of him. Dean is horny enough that he’d jump into bed straight away, and though Benny and Cas would be happy to do the same, they all know Cain is right. That fact isn’t stopping them from subtly, probably unconsciously, working their way towards him in the kitchen.
Dean can just make out Cas’ hand leaving the guy’s waist and reaching underneath him. Can see the motion of his arm as he jerks the dude off. Can imagine how it feels to have Cas’ strong artist fingers firmly gripping his dick.
to lie to me. And I’m incredibly angry that you let that asshole treat you so badly. Rest assured we
“It’s fine, Sam,” Mary says. And even that is enough to piss off, Dean. “I just wanted to see you boys, Dean. To explain.”
Dean swears under his breath. Sam was supposed to be in meetings all day. He wasn’t supposed to be around to watch this. “It’s called make-up, Sam, and acting.”
“If Ellen lands in trouble, that’s on me,” he argues, dragging himself out of Cain’s hold and taking a step back.
“So,” Dean says, trying to make conversation, seeing as how Cas seems content to hang around. “What are you doing here anyway? You in the market for an omega?”
“He,” Cas says, giving Dean a sideways glance as though he’s not sure how Dean will react. “My date tonight is a he.”
“You got me, Cas.” Dean has to talk around the swelling of emotion in his throat, unused to hearing Cas wear his heart on his sleeve quite as blatantly as this. “You’re not getting rid of me. Not ever.”
It’s not a conversation he envies. But, she’s the one that’s responsible for this mess, she should have the dirty job of explaining it to the kid.
“Whoa, hold on a minute there, Freud,” Dean snaps, creeped out. “I’ve never tried to be Sam’s mother.”
Dean tenses, prepared to punch the alpha in his face, if he so much as lays a finger on him. He doesn’t.
Dean closes his eyes so he can better ignore Sam’s worried expression. He knows this is fucked up. And he knows if —and let’s be honest, with his inability to lie to his boyfriend, that
“You’ll leave now before I lose my patience,” Cas says quietly, the intensity in his eyes, the deep growl of his voice, suddenly making it obvious to anyone with a brain that he’s far more dangerous than the overly-muscled security guard.
“Want you all,” Dean says, unhelpful but honest. “Please.” He bites at his lip, his dick jerking in his hand and a fresh burst of want pulsing through him as he imagines being knotted by any of these alphas. He closes his eyes, fighting every instinct that is telling him to roll back over, to get to his knees, to present himself like a desperate bitch to his alphas.
Standing up, she walks to a cabinet, unlocks it and produces a packet of pain meds, tossing them across the room to Dean. “These should help with the headaches, and make sure to drink plenty of water. Keeping hydrated is important.”
“I wouldn’t have any problems if it wasn’t for Winchester,” Marv rages, stabbing his finger towards Dean. “And the only one getting slapped with assault charges will be this brainless oaf, unless he unhands me right now.”
“It‘s what you said,” Dean points out icily. “You know what, I can’t listen to this bullshit anymore.”
Knowing Cas’s tells, the stutter of his hips, the way his teeth bite into his bottom lip, Dean wraps his hand around his own cock and jerks himself to completion. His spunk splashing white hot across Cas’s belly and his hole tightening around Cas’s dick, which is probably what sets him off in the end.
His mom. Dean doesn’t look at Cas in the front passenger seat. Won’t look at Sam sitting beside him. He stares out of the window. Sees nothing.
Rather than brooding about any feelings he may or may not have towards Cas, Dean does what any normal man would do and pretends they don't exist… apart from late at night when he’s jerking off before he goes to sleep. Instead, he focuses on trying to lose the love handles he’s convinced he’s developing. Thanksgiving didn’t help. He made two pies like he usually does but this year he ate them both himself. Spending Christmas alone too is bound to end up with him comfort-eating his way through a 16” pizza and several family-sized tubs of ice-cream before Boxing Day. If he hits the gym a few times beforehand he’ll not feel quite so guilty.
And after last night, Dean doesn’t think he’ll be able to look any of the three of them in the eye ever again.
“How’s it hanging, dude?“ Ash says, tossing his hair over his shoulder and pulling up a seat beside Dean. “You know, you’re getting a bit on the chubby side there, Winchester, you might want to ease off on the pie.”
Dean huffs and sticks out his tongue at his phone, which if anything neatly backs up Sam’s point. “He’s an asshole and I want him out.”
But, whatever, at the end of the day Dean didn’t get a choice in his designation; he’s an omega, and, like it or not —definitely not— he has to deal with it.
Cas and Sam are still talking to the police when Dean retreats back to the small studio which has been cleared of the photographer and his crew but not the bike. He strips out of his ruined jacket and shirts to let a paramedic clean his wounds and patch him up. He has a couple of eggs on his head but his brain isn’t rattling any worse than normal. The cuts on his arm and belly aren’t deep and should heal well enough. These ones shouldn’t even leave a scar. The paramedic doesn’t make a fuss when Dean declines to go to the hospital. She’s probably relieved she doesn’t have to fight her way out of the building with Dean by her side.
Cas cups Dean’s cheek, his hand as gentle as his softly spoken words. “I’m not going to shout at you. But you are not okay. And pretending that you are is starting to take its toll. I want you to let me take care of you the way you take care of everyone else.”
“You look pretty cute yourself,” Dean points out. The white pantsuit Charlie had eventually settled on after a day-long shopping expedition that Dean had somehow been roped into, is perfect for her. And as close to bridal as she was willing to get.
“Our relationship has always been based on trust and honesty,” Cas says to Meg, through gritted teeth. “We went to a couples retreat six months ago. We meditate together every morning. I… I massaged your damned feet last night. And… and… this is how you tell me you’re sleeping with your business partner?”
“No,” Dean says. “She doesn’t. She didn’t make a mistake. She made a choice. And she didn’t choose me and Sam. She chose herself. Well, as far as I’m concerned, she can live with that.”
“That...” not true, Dean was about to say, but when he thinks about it, it’s pretty much true. “...not the point,” he finishes weakly instead.
“You’re both so handsome,” Mary says. “And so like your father. Although I think maybe you have my eyes, Dean.”
“There is one other thing I do have to apologize for,” Cas continues, edging forward on his chair nervously. “The flat tires on the Impala? That… um… that was me. I swear I didn’t realize how much damage it could do. I thought it would just be a minor inconvenience. I’m sorry.”
“Well, I have met a few non-asshole alphas,” Dean starts to say, when he sees one of said alphas heading across the room straight towards them. His heart beats just a little faster at the sight of Cain, his wild silver hair in stark contrast to his sharp suit and crisp blue shirt. Dean can actually scent him before he reaches them, and his scent is just as delicious as the first time Dean met him.
Abaddon laughs at that. “Oh lover, why do you think Crowley invited you here? You think you’re the first omega he’s tempted away from a Den? Darling, he’s a pro at seducing the innocent. Tell me… are you a virgin? He loves virgins. Loves watching them being corrupted. Ruined.”
“I must say, I’m shocked that Ellen allowed this situation to arise,” Zachariah continues unfazed by Dean’s glower. “All those alphas that have paid money in good faith for a chance to meet an omega and you don’t end up with any of them. Hardly seems fair. Or decent.”
When he opens the door to the conservatory and finds Benny waiting for him, he figures he’s here to give Dean another lecture before the alpha appears.
Benny and Cain are both sprawled out in the bed, but they have been up long enough to open the windows in an effort to air out the room and to change the bedsheets which Dean is grateful for. He wasn’t looking forward to climbing back into that mess. Finding a clean spot in among the damp ruins had become impossible.
Dean’s hands are trembling so hard he can’t hold onto to his coffee. He doesn’t remember setting down his cup but he thinks he must have because he finds himself clutching the faded scar carved across his ribs.
Sam wanted Dean to recover back home in LA, but despite his less than ideal experience in Scotland so far, Dean’s fallen in love with the place. It’s certainly a lot more restful than LA. Even if a decent coffee shop is impossible to find.
It’s the first time since filming started that Dean has felt a glimmer of hope that this movie might be as good as it deserves it to be.
Before the alphas can complain or Dean can make his escape however, Charlie is in front of him, a determined look on her face. “You owe me a dance, Winchester.”
When Dean arrives back at the house, Uriel is already waiting for him in the driveway beside his flashy, but somehow still dull, BMW. He frowns at Dean’s casual appearance, his suit from yesterday having been discarded in favor of jeans, a henley and a flannel shirt. Clothes that Dean feels comfortable in.
“Look,” Dean eventually says, resigned to the fact that Sam won’t let this drop, and wishing he’d cleaned the fake blood from his face before he sat down. Seeing his brother resemble the victim of a serial killer probably isn’t helping Sam’s mood any. “This scene... Cas had nightmares for weeks after he watched us shoot it the first time, okay? Me, tied up, tortured and killed... it’s a little close to the bone. For all of us. You included. There’s no point in all of us having to deal with this crap over and over.”
The carrots, tossed on the chopping board, are given a brief stay of execution while Cas grabs a pan. Somehow he manages to make more noise than Ella did earlier on in the day when she was using the kitchen pans and a wooden spoon as a makeshift drum kit.
Before Sam can reply there’s a sharp knock on his office door. Jess walks in a second later, Elle wriggling in her arms. She shoots Dean an apologetic look. “Sam, your mom’s here. She says she needs to speak to you.”
“Sure,” Dean says, placing his hand on the center of Sam’s chest. Cas’s dislike of Crowley is definitely starting to rub off on Sam whose face is thunderous. “The sooner we’re done, the sooner we can leave.” And boy, does Dean want to leave.
They bought the beach house around eight years ago. Not Dean and Lisa. Dean, Lisa, Meg, and Cas. Of course, Lisa and Meg had floated the idea originally. What a unique opportunity it was. What a bargain it was. But a bargain they could best afford if they shared the property. Because they might be rich, but at that point, they were not beach front property rich.
And at last there are hands brushing across his skin, cupping his face, kisses placed reverently on the back of his neck, the ball of his shoulder, trailed down the knobs of his spine. And then he’s being manhandled, gently pushed and tugged around until he’s straddling a warm body below him. And he’s being kissed so gently it’s almost frustrating except for how it’s somehow perfect.
“No,” she says, handing him the rest of her packet of tissues. “Seriously. I mean there’s obviously the whole scientific schtick about how we evolved and why we’re different. But I think it’s all about balance. And love, obviously.”
“I’m not stupid.” Sam pouts. Just for a second. “My teacher says we’re going to be making Mother’s Day cards this week.”
Dean stands up when a guy enters the room. He’s shorter than Dean, smallish for an alpha, cute in a goofy kind of way and with a nice smile which is definitely something Dean can appreciate.
“The hell are you doing here?” Dean manages to ask. His tongue feels at least twice it’s normal size and, good god, what the fuck has he done to his back?
Dean smirks. “The way I heard it, customers were complaining about your hair finding its way into their food. Ellen was bitching cause you refused to cut it, ‘cause I guess you’re Samson or... I dunno... Sam, or some shit?”
Dean looks at the drink in the guy’s hand, and the way he’s waving it about and wonders just how much he’s imbibed already this evening. “Dude, trust me, you’re not. Now move out of my fucking way before I move you.”
Crowley waves his hands dismissively. “The movie-going public will shed tears as they watch Jason Todd’s Robin die. They’ll hate Batman for not saving his brave side-kick almost as much as they’ll hate the Joker for killing him. The Red Hood is going to end up being the anti-hero that everyone will root for. They’re going to love you, darling. I’ve already drafted something with a couple of the writers, hopefully we’ll have the new script pages for you later today.”
Dean shrugs. It’s certainly been his past experiences. But it’s not what he’s supposed to be looking for now. He’d been hoping for more, for sex that meant something. Maybe he is just deluded. Brainwashed by Ellen and Garth and all the happy smiley omegas back at the Den.
“You’re getting divorced after twenty years of marriage. Your wife cheated on you for twelve of those years. Your kid, who you fucking doted on, is living thousands of miles away and doesn’t need you anymore. You don’t have a job or any life goals, and you’re in a prank war with your roommate. I hate to break it to you, Dean, but even if we don’t talk about all the ways Dad fucked us both up, you’re not fine.”
He ends up spending a week fixing one of Cas’ senior citizens’ roof which leads to another few days spent painting walls and waxing floors. It might not be everyone’s idea of fun but it’s the most useful Dean’s felt in months.
Dean’s more relaxed than he has been for some time as he walks onto set, Sam and Cas trailing just behind him. Marv isn’t around, but that’s not unusual. The AD’s do most of Marv’s ground work. The director prefers to make a dramatic entrance once everyone else is in place.
Dean hates those damn things. The idea and the taste of them. Looking down at his  stomach though, he figures he might have to consider some kind of diet soon. Or maybe just stop drinking. And he definitely needs to find another gym because he’s sure as hell not going to be able to show his face in Lisa’s ever again.
Figuring that he should be safe since Cas’s hands are temporarily free of anything heavy or sharp, Dean slides in behind him, wrapping his arms around Cas’s waist, resting his chin on his boyfriend’s shoulder. “I know. I’m sorry. I’m not excusing that. But it was good business to him, pure and simple. He’s a damn fine director though, Cas, and he respects me more than Marv ever did. I want to finish making this movie. And I want it to be awesome. At this point Crowley’s the best chance for that.”
are, unfortunately, two very different things. Every frustration he’s been holding in suddenly boils over. A red mist descends over his eyes. Reason, common sense, and decorum leave the building. He charges at Cas, shoving him hard in the chest. Cas, who apparently has fucking awesome reflexes, grabs his wrist and before Dean can tell which way is up he finds himself lying flat on his back in the sand with Cas a solid weight on top of him. There’s a moment when they stare into each other’s eyes with the kind of intensity that in Dean’s experience usually leads to sex, but then matters devolve into a very embarrassing brawl that consists mainly of flailing arms and knees finding themselves in painful places.
Dean isn’t even mindless with heat-hunger when Cain finally knots him. Cas hasn’t long untied and Dean’s a leaking mess of come and slick, sweat gathering in places he didn’t even think could sweat and he wants Cain just because he can have him and not because his body is telling him he needs him.
“So, if we aren’t going out in a blaze of glory, do I at least get my happy ending?” Dean asks, shivering when Cas mouths a kiss to his nape.
Dean discreetly rubs at his shin. Charlie has a vicious streak and a good aim. “Sorry, jeez. I just mean, most alphas speak to me like I’m some kind of delicate flower, either that or just a dumb bitch they can talk into bending over. Crowley’s a sarcastic asshole, but he can take as good as he dishes out. He doesn’t expect me to be anything else but myself. He’s fun, in small doses.”
“Maybe not here, sweetheart,” Dean smirks, aiming for casual and flirty but probably missing by a mile. “I’m a little too old these days for fucking on bathroom floors but maybe we can try this wrestling thing out back home.”
“Cas isn’t a weirdo,” Dean says sharply, turning his attention back to Gordon. “He’s my friend. And my ex isn’t a bitch. We just… don’t want the same things anymore.”
Dean can barely see past the tears streaming from his eyes, but he hears Cas curse. “Fuck, sorry, sorry.”
“Hey dude,” Dean says, dropping down on the other side of the sofa. “What’s up with the mopey face?”
“Maybe you should talk to them anyway. You know, usually mated alphas don’t smell great to us omegas.”
“Neither am I,” Cas points out dryly. “And yet you think it perfectly acceptable that I visit a therapist regularly.”
Cas sniffs. “My art studio is here. I teach yoga classes on the beach four days a week. I’m staying.” He walks off without giving Dean a chance to argue.
“Don’t be ridiculous, Dean.” Sam scowls. It’s not actually an answer. “Look, can we just deal with this before you accuse me of anything else?”
Dean shrugs him off. “I can do what the hell I want. I’m not a fucking pet that your buddy picked out for you at the pound.”
The second glass tastes just as disgusting as the first but Dean does feel more of his nerves melt away.
“You don’t think this is all just a tad ridiculous, Dean?” Sam asks. Lisa’s lawyers finally drew up the paperwork for the divorce settlement and Dean is trying to relay the bits he thinks are important to his brother because Sam hasn’t received a copy yet. Dean is standing in the kitchen, his phone on speaker so he can page through the documents scattered across the island while sipping at a very much needed glass of whisky. Sam isn't talking about the settlement right now though. No, what Sam is talking about is the turf war he and Cas are still engaged in.
“It’s a bit chilly to be frolicking about on the beach, boys. You should be tucked up nice and warm at home.”
Dean takes her at her word, even though on a normal day he’d never just dismiss her that easily, grabs his glass, the bottle of whisky and heads to bed to try and grab a couple of hours sleep.
“There's nothing wrong with how my dad brought me up,” Dean says pointedly, his voice dropping low in warning. His family isn’t perfect, but he’s not going to sit and listen to anyone badmouthing them.
“My house was filled with strangers. Strange strangers. Who drank my booze, ate my food, and fell asleep in the bathtub. In my en-suite bathroom! I went for a piss in the middle of the night and almost had a freaking coronary.”
Sam doesn’t sound sure, or look sure, not with the way he’s pacing their shared bedroom as Dean packs his bag.
He shakes off his cast-mates concerns, apologizes to Idris for the water that dripped into his lap and makes a lame joke to the fans about audience participation as everyone settles back down. The rest of the panel passes in a blur, and ends in another movie clip that leaves the fans cheering.
Dean shrugs. The ass of his jeans is damp with wet sand and he’s wearing one sock, the other presumably lost on his run down the beach, so it seems pointless to deny the fact.
Crowley raises an eyebrow when Dean lights one up, but manages to refrain from commenting, even when Dean coughs harshly as the first bite of smoke hits the back of his already rough throat. He does shove the water glass back at Dean insistently.
“My point stands,” Dean says, catching the next cushion before it smacks him in the nose. “Hey, maybe you should watch some of your bee porn rather than this shit.”
Cas sighs as though it’s the biggest effort in the world to climb onto the motorcycle behind Dean, but he does it anyway, gently wrapping his arms around Dean’s bare stomach and pressing a kiss to the side of his neck.
A few hours of listening to Uriel’s sanctimonious bullcrap might just kill Dean. It’s hot as hell inside the church hall although Dean seems to be the only one bothered by it, sweat dripping down his neck, his face no-doubt growing redder by the minute. Everyone else is dressed in their Sunday best even though it’s the middle of the week, obviously doing their utmost to impress Uriel. Because of course, Uriel doesn’t just attend church, he’s the goddamn preacher. And this church is everything Dean hates about religion. It’s not even the usual brand of closed-minded, bible-thumping, give me your money and I’ll get you into heaven, bullshit. It’s worse. These people are believers. And the shit they believe, it’s insane.
“Comic-Con. We’re going to blow them away. Make them forget all about Marv. But I need you there, looking enthusiastic and happy. And healthy. Not like death warmed over.”
“I figured this was your mom’s news to tell. Look, I know this is a shock, but really, nothing is gonna change for you. We both still love you. We’re both still going to be right here if you need us. This isn’t the end of the world.”
It’s possible that Dean even sheds a tear or two during the ceremony. Thankfully Cas wipes them away before anyone else notices. If pushed, Dean can always lay blame on the hundreds of flowers decorating the tiny church. Hay fever really is a bitch.
“Your relationship is an abomination,” Uriel spits at Cas, ignoring Dean completely. “Three alphas living together? Fucking? That’s a mockery of the church, and God’s laws.”
Lisa hangs up abruptly leaving Dean staring angrily at his phone. Did Lisa just cut him off to go bang Meg? Sonofabitch!
Dean rubs the back of his neck. “Straight down to business, Lis? Are you that worried I’m gonna sic an attack dog of a divorce lawyer on you? You’ve got a lot of faith in me, huh?
“I owe a few people a lot of favors. And by that, I mean you’re gonna be making personal appearances at birthday parties and charity balls for the next year, but yeah, I’ve pretty much fixed it. You’ve got a few weeks down time now, then Comic-Con, then three weeks free and clear before you start filming again. I can’t get you out of the John Wick movie after that, or the Disney thing which at least is only voice work, but then you’re a free man for as long as you want.”
Idris slaps Dean on the back before heading off to his own trailer, while Crowley walks with Dean towards his. At the bottom of the steps he holds Dean back for a second, a hand on his arm.
“Or by any decent person,” Zachariah adds, appearing suddenly and walking towards them from the church steps.
keep on walking. Dean should in fact run, not walk, straight up to his room and pretend he’d hadn’t seen Cas pounding someone’s ass over the arm of the sofa.
He’s heading back inside when Benny wanders out the door, eyes lighting up when he spots Dean. “We were wondering where you disappeared to.”
But the Red Hood, he’s different. Ever since he read the comic books when he was a teenager, Dean has had a bit of a crush on Jason Todd. Batman’s doomed boy wonder is conflicted, smart, vulnerable, twisted and has abandonment issues that Dean identifies with more than he will ever admit, even to himself.
He’s outside, jogging down the church stairs when Uriel catches up to him. His hand clamping down on Dean’s shoulder.
He discovers, once he’s in the dining room, that he’s starving. He’s half way through a pile of waffles when Charlie throws herself into a seat opposite him.
The alpha is already waiting, sitting relaxed in a leather armchair, when Dean opens the door and steps in. “Well, aren’t you a pretty one,” is his opening gambit.
That explains the smell then. It’s reassuring to know that even when Dean’s nose is defective he can still sniff out low life. Maybe some Omega Welfare agents are decent people, but the few that Dean has dealt with in the past have all been condescending morons. Looking at Zach, smelling him, Dean figures he’s definitely another one to add to the moron column.
He isn’t letting his guard down just yet, but his first impression is that the place looks more like an upmarket country hotel than a seedy government institute.
There’s obviously something on Meg’s mind this evening though. She’s not made one sarcastic quip about Dean’s table manners, even when one of his clams ended up on his lap, and she keeps shooting Cas anxious sidelong glances. Lisa’s acting weird too, laughing too loudly at Cas’ yoga-class stories and going off on a tangent about the best way to make shrimp risotto. As far as Dean’s aware, she’s never made risotto in her life. He’s never even seen her eat risotto.
“Dean,” Cas starts to say and then curses as Dean tries to push himself to his feet. He makes it, just, but only thanks to Cas and Benny shoring him up at either side. His stomach lurches as the room tilts and sways around him, but after the initial wave of dizziness passes, the urge to hurl thankfully recedes.
When Dean starts blowing up another balloon Cas backs out of the room, his face managing to look both pale and flushed at the same time. “I’ll be in my studio,” he snarls, in the same tone of voice he would use to suggest that Dean should go kill himself.
When he blinks, he sees flashes bathed in red: grinning faces, blood, Uriel, knives, blood, Alastair.
“I’m fine, thank you, Dean.” Cas’s reply is stiff, his expression relentlessly neutral. “Perhaps we could talk in private.”
That stops Dean cold, his temper suddenly overtaking his determination to stay calm. “What happened last night? The meeting with our mother. Remember, I begged you to go with me, but you called off days ago because you were too busy doing something vitally important but incredibly vague that you couldn’t tell me about?”
There is. But Dean’s not planning on sharing that with Charlie. There are three alphas who very much make his knees go weak. But they’re also very much involved with each other. Dean might be an idiot, but he’s not stupid. He knows better than to chase after anyone who’s in a relationship. Even though he’d be lying if he said that the three of them, Benny, Cain, and Cas, are all very much at the forefront of his mind a lot of the time. Especially when he’s spending quality time alone.
Eventually, he works up the energy to limp up to his and Lisa’s bathroom where he downs a handful of Tylenol and some Pepto Bismol he finds in the cabinet. After peeing like a racehorse and splashing cold water on his face he feels not quite human, but not quite so much like he’s dying either. A hot shower would probably help his back muscles but coffee seems like a far more urgent matter.
Sam doesn’t even look mad when he says it, just resigned. He steps aside without another word, watching silently from the doorway as Dean walks away.
“Sure,” Dean replies, leaning back in his chair and crossing his legs with what he hopes is a nonchalant air.
“Dean,” Lisa says, in that patronizingly over-patient voice she uses when she thinks Dean is being unreasonable. “I’m not sure what you want me to do? I can’t make Cas move out? He has as much right to be there as you or I do. Look, why don’t you come back home and we can talk about all this.”
“Sure,” Dean says, he’s met her a couple of times he thinks. Nice woman, as far as he remembers. He has no idea why they’re discussing her now.
“None of us are, brother,” Benny chuckles. “But you look damn sharp if you don’t mind my saying. You obviously take good care of yourself.”
“It’s what my mom always told me when I was little. Humans weren’t designed to be alone. They were meant to have mates. Families. Being an alpha or omega is an evolutionary advantage over everyone else. We can scent out our other half and know immediately if we’re compatible. If there’s a connection.”
“As it’s been less than a day since I discovered my wife has been lying to me for twelve years, surprisingly, no I don’t.”
“Next year,” Dean says, grabbing Cas’s hand, but attention fixed on Sam. “Let’s take some time off next year. We’ve not actually signed on the dotted line for that Netflix series, have we? Maybe we could give that a miss?”
Rather than standing like a creeper at the edge of the dance floor, Dean beats a hasty retreat to the bar, hops up on the lone free stool, and orders himself a double shot of whisky. For luck or Dutch courage. He downs it in one long swallow. It doesn’t help settle the rolling waves of wrongness in his belly at all. Neither does the realization that he’s sitting beside Gordon who’s silently staring daggers at the side of his head.
“Yes, she did,” Dean says. “And I can't pretend that I’m okay with it, but she didn’t do it to hurt me, or you, she did it because she… well, because she fell in love. And love makes us do some dumb shit.”
It’s not Ellen who swoops in to save the day this time, it’s a guy Dean’s never seen before, tall, grey-haired, sharply dressed and smelling downright edible despite Dean’s skewed senses. “Is everything okay here, gentlemen?”
Dean takes a step forward, and places a chaste kiss to Cain’s lips. “I’m doing this. I hope I’ll see you when I get back, but I’ll understand if I don’t.”
“Oh,” Dean says, twisting the cat’s neck in his hand just a touch too viciously. He makes no effort to hide his smirk when it explodes. Cas jumps at least six inches in the air, making what is quite possibly the funniest noise Dean has ever heard. “Your throat singing inspired me to take up a new hobby. I thought I’d try my hand at the art of balloon animal making. What do you think?”
“What the hell, dude?” Dean says, not missing the fury on Cas’s face as he instantly jumps between them, yanking Marv back by the collar of his crumpled suit jacket.
Not that Dean is even thinking along those lines. There is no point in pinning his hopes on this alpha. Because one thing is for sure, if Cas is as rich as Croesus he’s not going to be interested in an omega like Dean.
Crowley lifts an eyebrow. “I hope you aren’t implying I had anything to do with that spectacle back there?”
Cas rolls his eyes at the cheesy line, but can’t hide his own smile as he uses Dean’s chest to push himself to his feet. He holds his hand out for Dean.
Ash and Charlie shake their heads solemnly. Until Ellen leaves the room. Then Ash says, “Man, I totally banged her. Hate sex is hot as hell!”
“Why now?” he blurts out suddenly. Sam and Mary stop mid-conversation and stare at him. It’s a reasonable question though. He’s not taking it back. “Why contact us now? I mean... not to blow my own trumpet or anything but I won an Oscar a few years back, my life, our childhood, has been public fodder for years. My damn face has been splashed across billboards and magazine covers. You couldn’t turn on the television without seeing me a couple years back when... when the shit in Scotland went down. You’re not an idiot, you must have figured out who I was. Where we were. How easy it would be to contact us. So, why wait until now?”
At least that makes Ben laugh, even if it is strained. “Yeah, you two don’t strike me as being the most compatible roommates.” Ben hesitates before he adds. “But you… you’re doing okay, Dad?”
The old guy, Jeb, looks set to argue but when Gunner, who isn’t a small guy, crosses his arms over his chest and glares him down, he staggers out of the bar grumbling under his breath.
“What?” Benny says, taking a step towards him. “No. Nothing like that. Just saw you sitting out here when I was having my usual walk around the property and thought I’d check on you.”
Sam tuts in disapproval. “His wife just dumped him, something which I’d have thought you would have some sympathy for. I know you don’t want to hear it, but he has as much right to be there as you do. You know, the adult approach to all this would be to sit down and discuss the situation like two rational people.”
On the other hand, he really could care less about the daily hate he receives from bigoted assholes. He’s not going to waste a second of his time caring about any idiot feeling butthurt over the fact he’s in love with a dude. Life’s too short for that shit.
His only company, the bread rolls, stare smugly back at him. No, he tells them —silently because he doesn’t want everyone to know that he talks to his food— you can’t seduce me with your crispy golden brown good looks.
And after last night, finding out what a toppy bastard Cas is, well, Dean can safely say his spank bank has taken on a whole new deposit.
Mary shakes her head, her hands clasping anxiously at the purse in her hand. “No, I didn’t, I swear.” At least she doesn’t pretend not to know what Sam is talking about.
Dean knows when he’s beat. He shoots his brother the filthiest of looks though. Sam doesn’t even pretend not to look smug. Asshole.
Dean struggles to come up with a reason that sounds believable. “I don’t know, Ellen. What are people going to think if I mate with three alphas? Maybe I should try harder to… to be normal.”
With his busy schedule he doesn’t find the chance to slip out on his bike often. Especially as the studio banned him from riding it on public roads until he’s finished filming this movie. But fuck them, it’s not his fault they’re doing all these reshoots. And this... this is an emergency. If he doesn’t find some space to sort out his head, he’s going to implode.
“Don’t you worry about that, Sammy.” Dean smirks, wiggling his eyebrows. “Cas knows how to treat me right. In fact, just a second ago he promised me a happy ending. So maybe you should beat it before we—”
Unfortunately, Gordon’s not letting go of the keys without a fight. “You are not my pal,” he growls, jerking his hand back and away from Dean.
“What the fuck ever,” Dean grumbles into his coffee mug. “You’re not planning on staying here though, right?”
Benny, as always, isn’t fooled for a second. “You’re adorable,” he says, against the crook of Dean’s neck, right over his mating mark. One of his mating marks at least. He also has a more discreet one from Cain slightly lower down on the back of his neck, and one decidedly lower down on his left ass cheek. Because, contrary to what his conservative suits and polite manner suggest, Cas is kinky fucker, without a shred of subtlety, who likes to mark his territory.
Dean wishes Cas could read his mind. Could know that what he really means is I’m freaking out and I’m scared you won’t want me now.
Dean can tell that he’s still being careful, but he pushes harder, forces Dean to take more, take him deeper. His thrusts gain speed as well as force and just when Dean thinks he might have to back off, catch his breath, Cas comes, right down his throat.
Unfortunately, Gordon isn’t silent for long. It quickly becomes apparent that Gordon has drunk most of the bottle of Jim Beam that’s sitting on the bar in front of him. Dean’s unsurprised to discover that a wasted Gordon is even less pleasant than normal Gordon.
“Sam,” Cas says, incredibly serious as he attempts to haul himself and an uncooperative Dean into a more vertical position. “I would very much like to marry your brother if you have no objections.”
Out of the corner of his eye, Dean sees Cas’s posture change. There’s not a single muscle relaxed in his body, and he’s already edging out of the darkness of the wings towards the lights of the stage. His intent to jump between Dean and this moron obvious.
Cas shakes his head. “You know she’s a tech genius. And honestly, when we discussed it, we decided we wanted this handled quietly. Unofficially. Just in case. Charlie can hide her tracks.”
“I’ll deal with it,” Sam says. “Yeah, thanks, I’ll call you back, okay.” With the call cut, Sam stands up and paces two lengths of the room before he stops and meets Dean's questioning look. “The press knows about Mom. Pamela’s been inundated with phone-calls asking if it’s true we’re feuding about it. Apparently, they’re gunning for you.”
“Are you listening to me, boy?” Ellen says, but she tuts and attempts to pat down Dean’s hair without waiting for an answer. “I don’t know why I waste my breath. It’s like trying to argue with Mother Nature. Behave in there, Dean Winchester,” she orders, waving her finger at him before leaving him to it.
“And,” ignoring Dean completely, Sam carries on. “I’m still mad that you took off the other night. And I’m damn furious that you didn’t tell me about the panic attack you had a couple days ago.”
Cas is squaring up to Uriel, more focused on eviscerating the preacher than actually listening to Dean. Deciding a more drastic approach is needed, Dean wraps himself around the posturing alpha like a slightly manic koala bear. If Dean wasn’t dizzy with either a minor head injury or his fast approaching heat he’d be mortified at his own public display. As it is, he needs Cas to get his head in the game. “Alpha, I’m going into heat. Take me home. Now.”
“I ain’t arguing that Gordon was out of order here. All I mean is none of the cuts look serious. He’s just scratched up.”
bad feeling. And it’s definitely got nothing to do with the seafood. He’s never heard Lisa say the business isn’t important before. Not once. She’s missed baseball games, school plays, date nights, vacations, and holidays, because of how important the business is.
Dean presumes he’s being sarcastic. Even someone as socially inept as Dean can tell that the atmosphere is tense enough to cut with a blunt knife. Most of the people close by are staring in their direction after Cas’ outburst.
Dean almost flinches at the over effusive greeting. And he very pointedly stands his ground when it looks like Garth is trying to come in for a hug. Dean is an omega but that doesn’t automatically mean he’s into touchy feely crap. Dean Winchester is not a hugger.
He shifts from one pose to the next. All positions Alastair likes. Dean draped over the hay bale, chin in his hands, ass in the air. Leaning back on his elbows, lips open, eyes closed.
“Do you think I could steal Dean away from you?” Cain asks, Charlie. “I believe your beautiful new wives are looking for you anyway.”
“When I told her we don’t have a mom, Dylan said we must have been real horrible to make her leave.”
Except, Cas is very definitely not a girl. He’s almost six feet of firm muscle with a five o’clock shadow that never quite fades, and he kisses like it’s his mission from God.
Dean finds himself laughing again. He never really thought of Cas as being funny before. He’s not even entirely sure Cas is meaning to be funny now.
“You are not going down there.” Cas doesn’t look like he’s joking. They’re staring down at the madness below them from a balcony, obscured from view of the vast majority of people.
“I… ah… I might have been hanging around waiting for you,” Charlie admits, giving him a bashful smile. “I wanted to make sure you weren’t mad at me after last night.”
“We should discuss this at home,” Cas says. When Dean turns to him, he’s staring pointedly at Sam rather than Dean.
Charlie at least looks bashful when she chimes in. “Um, yeah, me too. She might be a bitch but she‘s got a wicked tongue.”
“Yeah? Well, tell that to the tiny numbers on the side of the cans. Who the fuck even eats chickpeas anyway.”
Dean slaps Sam’s back as he pulls away. “Because you have enough to worry about without me getting in the way.”
“But I’m… but they… ” Dean thinks back over all the dates he had, all the alphas he met. “But I didn’t fit with any of them. They didn’t… none of them smelled...” —like you, or Cain, or Cas, Dean stops himself from saying because he’s confused as hell but he’s not stupid enough to admit that— “...right.” He settles on.
Dean might have more chance of fending off Sam’s overprotective brother mode if his voice didn’t sound like he’d been gargling with razor blades. It would also help if didn’t face-plant the second Stuart freed his wrists.
“Exactly,” Dean says. “All you want is… is a bit of fun. And that's… there’s nothing wrong with that. But I… I can’t do fun. Not when I have…” Dean wants to punch himself in the face rather than actually say this, but he owes Cas the truth. “I have… feelings.”
“I didn’t make the situation worse,” Sam snaps. Dean watches, with his eyebrows raised, as his brother take an obvious deep breath and count to three. “Okay, I may have made the situation a little worse. But not deliberately. I was reasonable, he’s an egotistical jackass. Plus, there were witnesses. Half the crew heard him badmouth you.”
That makes sense. If there’s one thing Zachariah respects it would be money. Especially old money which usually comes with a decent amount of power, connections, and sway. Dean’s not sure whether the fact this alpha is loaded makes him more or less attractive. Usually Dean would say less, but the fact that he apparently has the power to make Zachariah disappear is definitely a mark in the plus column.
They watch a movie, eat popcorn, and share a bottle of wine between them. Dean refuses to sit on the sofa, but they don’t mention Alfie or anything about the incident again.
slowly works his way into an upright position while Cas disappears, hopefully, to fetch something that will put Dean out of his misery.
“Dean. Damnit, come on, Winchester, you’re not dying on my dime. That boyfriend of yours would kill me. Dean! Hey, you there? You with me? Try breathing, you moron.”
Cas frowns and leans back in his chair, hands steepled in front of him. “I was trying to protect you. It’s all I’ve ever done. I thought you would understand.”
because he peed the bed and Sam was a whiny baby. One thing school has taught him is that moms don’t just leave their kids. They must have done something wrong. But he’s not going to let Sammy think that. Not ever.
The place is trashed. The sofa slashed. Television smashed. Red paint, Dean hopes, hurled across every surface.
Dean rolls over onto his back, his dick springing up hard and needy between them, and grabs Cas’s wrist when he tries to stand up. “Oh no, bucko, don’t you dare go anywhere. You started this. You finish it.”
Cas smiles at that. And okay, so he and Dean have a few issues to straighten out, but that gummy smile is worth putting up with a lot of crap.
“We’re half of a pair. Alpha and omega. Dark and light. Night and Day. We need to find our match, the right partner to balance us out.”
He only stays there for a couple of minutes, just long enough to remind himself that Cas is his best friend, not his boyfriend. And that it’s better all round if that fact remains unchanged.
“Is that why you were so happy when he wanted to go to college abroad?” Dean asks, bitterly. “You figure dumping me would be easier if he was studying thousands of miles away in the UK?”
“It’s not stupid,” Dean steps in to defend Jason Todd. Otherwise known as a Robin. Otherwise known as the Red Hood. “I love this character so lay off.”
“I’m sure Zachariah will be disappointed to hear that,” Uriel says, his voice growing cold. “He assured me that a second date would be available.”
Dean gives her a smile before he walks away, but it’s tight, doesn’t reach his eyes. Not that kind of smile he usually reserves for her.
“True,” Dean acknowledges. “It would have been hot if they had though. I wouldn’t have minded watching Redford give Newman a happy ending. God, I don’t know which of them I had a bigger crush on when I was a horny teenager. The nights I — “
“No? Where have you been the last few days then, Cas? Who are you having clandestine phone conversations with? Who’s taking up all your time?”
“How are you even standing?” Dean groans, and god it feels like his tongue has grown a layer of fur overnight.
Cas makes the godforsaken noise again, and Dean can safely say that it doesn’t sound any better close up.
Dean’s the first to arrive. Something which should be a surprise to exactly no one, least of all himself. His days aren’t exactly jam-packed with excitement since Ben left home and disappeared off to college in another damn country.
“We want you,” Benny says. “I swear, darlin’. You walk away now and we’d be brokenhearted. All of us. This is real. For life. It’s not a heat fling. Not for us. It’s a lifetime thing.”
Thankfully Charlie manages to steer them around the edges of the dance floor without too much trouble. “Nice wedding, Bradbury,” Dean says, once he’s figured out that following her lead is the easiest path to take.
my kid. Lisa slept with a couple of other guys around the same time she slept with me. She was honest about it though. Said we could do a DNA test if I wanted. But I thought, what’s the point, right? I’m gonna bring the kid up to be mine anyway. That’s all that matters. Right? Right, Cas?”
“Is that a replica?” Dean asks, swallowing hard and reminding himself he’s at comic-con. That this weird crap is perfectly normal. That this isn’t Alastair. “It’s pretty realistic.”
If Dean could speak he’d tell Cas not to apologize. Tell him he likes it rough. Likes to be bossed about. And he really fucking likes it when it’s Cas that’s doing the bossing. Instead, he lets go of his cock, grabs the back of Cas’ thigh, and urges him to do it again.
Cas bundles Dean in the passenger seat before hurrying around to the driver's side, and slamming the door behind him. He grips the steering wheel, rests his head back on the seat and closes his eyes.
“Dad,” Dean persists. “Please, just give it a try for another couple of weeks. I’ve got money saved from last weekend when I helped out at Aiden’s parent's store and I can—”
“You sure are, sugar,” Benny says in his ear. Then cruelly, Cas’ lips leave Dean’s but before Dean can utter a complaint, Benny and Cas are kissing over Dean’s shoulder and it’s so freaking hot he thinks he might explode. The pitiful whine he lets out isn’t intentional.
And then he leaves, quickly, before he changes his mind, because the temptation to stay right there and cling to Cain is very real and very powerful.
Cas releases his hold on his partner’s hair, dropping his hand to slap it against the guy’s ass cheek, at the same time as pounding into him hard enough to scrape the sofa across the floor. At any other time Dean would be worried about the hard-wood flooring. He’s so entranced by the sight of Cas rutting into his partner like a goddamn animal, that it doesn’t even occur to him.
She’s tall, beautiful, and classy. And immediately stares at Dean as though he’s something foul that she’s just peeled off the sole of her Manolo Blahniks.
Once Dean has polished off the last of his waffles, he explains about the dates with all three alphas, about the arrangement they all seem to want. Charlie’s expression slowly morphs from excitement to disapproval. Dean hadn’t expected that.
Dean smacks Cas’ shoulder, and hopes that Cas doesn’t notice his answering smile is forced. There’s absolutely no reason for the stab of jealousy he feels at the thought of Cas hooking up with anyone. Hell, he’s on to a sure thing himself with Benny and Carmen.
Although Dean knows this Ellen chick is speaking sense, he’s still instinctively on the defensive. “I’m sorry there are so many assholes in the world, but seriously none of that crap happened to me. I’m fine.”
He throws himself down on the grass and drops his head into his hands. He hadn’t meant to blow up like that at Missouri, but god, he’s sick of hearing how clueless he is about this whole omega thing. He’s not an idiot. He’s always known he was different. Shit, he’d spent half his school years punching out asshole kids for pointing that out to him. The problem with living in a relatively small town was everyone knew everyone else’s business. And everyone and their fucking aunt knew that Dean Winchester was one of them omega bitches. He’s been hearing it since he was too young to have any idea what it meant. And ever since he figured it out, he’s been busy proving to everyone, and himself, that he’s no-one’s goddamn bitch.
“I’m sure I’ll hear from her one of these days,” Cas says with a shrug and then adds from absolutely nowhere. “Are you sure you aren’t being so hard on your mother because you feel like she’s trying to replace you?”
all the time. I’m sure the man is in love with you,” Cas grumbles, less angry and more petulant now.
The venue for Dean’s fourth date moves from the conservatory to the library. Garth and Ellen seem to think a change of scenery might put Dean at ease. Dean didn’t even know they had a library in the Den. The room is comfortable enough with huge leather sofas amid the bookshelves but libraries have always been more of Sam’s natural habitat than Dean’s.
Dean’s not exactly relaxed when Alastair starts taking pictures but his head is kind of buzzing and it’s enough to follow his orders without complaining.
“God, no,” Dean shudders at the thought. “I prefer to keep my feet firmly on the ground, thank you very much.”
And perhaps if Winchester’s bodyguard hadn’t been quite so enamored of the boy, Alastair would have been the one to find Dean after he escaped. By that point, of course, Castiel Novak was more boyfriend than bodyguard. The ex-soldier had turned out to be a rather irritating fly in Alastair’s ointment. The timing should have been perfect to snatch Dean. He’d been practically alone in a country he didn’t know, his overprotective brother on his honeymoon, for once not glued to his side. The movie he was making was shooting in the wilds of Scotland and Dean was more vulnerable than he’d been since he was a teenager.
Dean might not be radiating enthusiasm but he figures Garth is filled with more than enough positivity for the both of them. “I’m just being myself. Isn’t that what you and Ellen told me to do?”
“It was,” Mary insists, and Dean can’t quite believe her gall. “At the time it was. Dean, I was miserable. In retrospect, I think I was suffering from depression. I spent every day crying and snapping at you and Sam and your Dad. I hated myself for it but it was getting worse. I was a terrible mother. And a terrible wife. I just... I didn’t think I was cut out for it. I felt like I was losing myself, suffocating a bit more each day.”
Benny winks at Dean as he walks away, phone numbers exchanged. “Don’t forget to stretch out those glutes,” he calls back over his shoulder, “wouldn’t want you to strain anything, would we, chere?”
“Not as far as we know,” Dean returns. “Dad certainly never kept in touch with anyone. It was just the three of us. After Mom left.”
The answer to that is at least is a no-brainer. “Maybe because her family are a bunch of ultra-religious right-wing dicks who believe omegas are basically mindless baby-making machines. And, dude, Ruby? You really need to find yourself some decent friends. What happened to Kevin and that cute chick? What was her name again? Jessica?”
Dean swallows before he replies. “Yeah,” he says, and then repeats more firmly. “Yeah, we are. He’s been there for me, y’know, over the last few months, when people I thought were my friends just upped and disappeared. I mean, sure, I’ve wanted to strangle him more times than I can count, but now, well, like it or not, I’m pretty sure he’s my best friend.”
It’s not easy standing up to any authority figure. Not when they’re in control of your life. Sometimes you have no option but to shut up and obey orders if you want to survive.
Dean’s phone lights up with a message to tell him the studio car is there. “Are you coming with?” he asks, pouring more coffee into a to-go mug.
“Dean, you’re already running late,” he complains, glancing at his watch for at least the third time in the last minute.
Cas ignores Dean’s pointed dig completely and returns doggedly to his point. “Why is Sam angry at you?”
“No promises,” she laughs, and gives him a peck on the cheek, then wipes a smear of make-up off his face, before skipping away with a friendly threat to post a video on Instagram of him singing karaoke if he doesn’t call her later.
Yeah, he should have done but by the time that occurred to him, he was too busy having a panic attack in the back of the car. Once he was on set with the crew and usual studio security milling around there didn’t seem any point. He deflects. “You haven’t answered any of my messages in two days, Cas.”
Crowley’s words slow down to a kindergarten teacher crawl, patronizing dick. “This is the Red Hood’s movie, darling. It needs to end with the Red Hood in all his angsty glory.”
Cas holds the glasses while Dean pours the vodka, taking one when Cas offers it. He only remembers how violently he dislikes the taste of vodka when he takes his first sip. The only saving grace is that it’s a decent brand and not the cheap shit that tastes like gasoline.
Dean sees him a couple of times out on the beach, leading his yoga classes. He teaches mixed groups, from hardcore twenty-somethings bending into ridiculously complicated poses to retirees doing exercises a little less painful looking, but still probably more than Dean could manage. Cas obviously makes everything look effortless. The smug asshole.
That was a lot of words to tell Dean his name. Dean loses his train of thought midway through. The alpha has very pink lips. And very nice teeth. And…
Uriel’s grunt of pain is replaced quickly by one of rage, but when he strides towards Dean, fists raised, Cas is quicker, stepping in front of him. And it’s Cas who throws the first punch when Uriel tries to step around him to get to Dean. Uriel reels backwards holding his face. Cas may not be as broad as Uriel, not as bull-like, but he’s filled with righteous fury and apparently packs a mean right hook. Dean can’t help but be impressed.
“And I know that you may already be planning your revenge but I was hoping that perhaps we could call a truce?”
Crowley winks at him, like he knows damn well that Dean has a weakness for playing badass anti-heroes with daddy issues... he has a point.
Charlie and Gilda are now serious. And obviously happy even though Dean knows that Charlie is missing Dorothy terribly.
“You here to yell at me some more?” Dean asks, shoving his hands in his pockets. “Cause I get it. I’m an idiot. I don’t need another lecture.”
In all likelihood Dean’s just blown his only chance at happiness. No way are Benny, Cain or Cas going to want him after this. Just one day after he was soaking up their attentions like the needy omega his dad always warned him against being, and he’s already going off with another alpha.
He expends the last of his energy putting away groceries before collapsing on the living room sofa with his bottle. He doesn’t bother with a glass. He doesn’t need it.
“I didn’t tell you because I had to make sure it was genuine, okay? I had to make sure it was really her. It’s not the first time someone’s faked something like this.”
Frank is one of the executive producers. He’s loaded, cranky, paranoid as hell, and has connections everywhere. He also loves Dean. Thinks he’s kind of pretty. High praise from the old grouch.
“Well, yeah,” Dean says. “You’ve got the bedhead hair and the eyes. You’re a real catch.” And boy, is it getting warm in here or what, Dean thinks, tugging at his shirt collar. He should have stuck to jeans and a tee-shirt, but he’d figured he should make an effort for once. Not to impress Cain or Benny, but y’know, just because.
“And we don’t want word getting back to them that you’re trying to whore omegas out to your psychotic friends, do we?” Dean snaps back.
Ellen laughs at him. “Get out of here,” she says. “And don’t forget to stay hydrated. Heat takes a lot out of you. And be careful of chafing. And remember to eat. Food. Not just…”
“Fuck,” Cas growls and then he’s sliding his dick out of Dean’s mouth, leaving him gasping for breath and panting, and he’s painting Dean’s face with the rest of his load. Coming across his lips and the bridge of his nose.
The muscle in Cas’ jaw ticks. “Dean, I’m not sure it would be right for us to take advantage of you when you aren’t thinking clearly. Spending a heat with one alpha, never mind three, is something you should give a great deal of consideration to.”
Her calm tone of voice isn’t placating Dean in the slightest. In fact, if anything it’s having the opposite effect. “You loved us so you left? That’s bullshit. I mean, what did you think was going to happen? How did you see this panning out for us, huh? I mean did you even think about what would happen to
“God, Cas,” Dean chokes out between heaving breaths and intermittent giggles. “That was a terrible idea. Couldn't you have waited until we made it to a bed?”
“Did Benny send you out here to look for me?” Dean asks. Ellen will have undoubtedly told him about Dean’s plans with Uriel.
Dean finally manages to put an end to Cas’ naked tyranny by cranking up the air-con up to hoodie levels of comfort, thanking his lucky stars that Cas’ dire grasp of household technology means he doesn’t even know where the air-con controls are.
Dean thinks about it seriously for a second. Marriage, the whole white picket fence thing, it’s never felt like it’s in the cards for him. Not with all his emotional hang-ups. But now. With Cas. “Yeah,” Dean says, a soft smile lightening his voice. “Yeah, I would. Right time, right place, right person, I would.”
“Seems like you’ve upset the local residents,” Cain notes, coming to stand beside Dean, close enough that his scent curls around Dean like a comfort blanket. Dean relaxes for the first time in over a day.
“Darling, the studio hired me to salvage this disaster of a movie. This is how we’re going to do it. We’re going to shoot as quickly as possible. I’m going to cut Marv’s horrendous bumbling attempt at storytelling into a slick masterpiece and we’re going to release this movie as quickly as possible before the critics hang us for Marv’s mistakes.”
“What about you?” Cas asks, softly. “Is Sam the only family you have? No grandparents? Aunts and Uncles?”
“Is that even ethical?” Charlie asks. “I mean, they work here. Isn’t that like a teacher/pupil kind of issue?”
“In all honesty,” the madman playing with him leers, “so did I. I guess he’s not the super hero either of you thought he was. Shame. For you, I mean.”
He’s not so sure the alphas will want anything to do with him now that his body is no longer pumping out “fuck me” pheromones. Maybe one taste of just how needy Dean is during a heat, how exhausting he is, will be enough to scare off the three of them. It’s not like they need him anyway. They were perfectly happy without him before. Cas, Benny and Cain in their cozy house, handcrafted bed and steady relationship. There may not be room for Dean in any of it.
Dean can throw a punch, but he knows his chances of making it out of this unscathed now are slim to say the least.
Ellen continues. “We have a doctor with whom you can discuss any concerns you might have about coming off the meds. You’re scheduled for a full medical tomorrow morning anyway.”
?” Dean splutters. “You know how many hours of work I put into this place? The months I spent here fixing it up?”
Dean’s breath catches in his chest. There’s no question about it. He’s in love with this weird ass dude with his stupid blue eyes and crazy hair, and his goddamn ugly grandpa sweater. Jesus, he’s forty years old, unemployed, divorced and not at all sure what he’s going to do with the rest of his life. But, that’s okay. He’s not at the end of his story. He’s barely halfway through. It’s okay to not know all the answers. He has Cas. He’s happy. And that’s enough.
Dean picks at the edge of the label on his beer bottle with his nail, not quite able to meet Gordon’s eyes.
Cas doesn’t try to talk to Dean again. Nothing more serious than, have some water, and I love you and goodnight. Dean’s grateful for it. Even though he knows he can’t avoid the conversation for long. Cas is worried. He’s probably right to be; Dean was a moody asshole even before this bombshell news about his mother’s reappearance.
“Just as well,” Dean says. “I imagine a dude turning up in a suit of armor would cause more of a scene than me punching out some jackass.”
“Ooh,” Charlie says, kicking Dean under the table like she can sense his thoughts. “Dean’s welcome party. How exciting.”
Benny pats Dean’s shoulder lightly as he walks past. Dean can’t help but lean in to his touch, closing his eyes, breathing in deeply, and inhaling Benny’s scent.
“Oh,” Dean says, playing with his eggs. “Cool. Good for you, I guess. And him. He seemed like a nice kid.”
Dean has been desperate to see Cas, missed him like crazy, but now Cas is here, dog-tired and apparently ill tempered, he’s not sure what to say. He doesn’t think he has the energy, emotional or physical, to handle a fight. And for some reason that’s what it seems like Cas wants.
“Jerk,” Sam returns, and yanks Dean into a hug. Dean slaps him on the back and tries to hide a relieved smile. Fighting with Sam is almost as bad as fighting with Cas.
Benny and Cas both grumble, and Dean catches a glimpse of Benny pushing Cas up against the wall in a bruising kiss as Cain ushers him from the kitchen.
Dean hates that Cas sounds so unsure. “Dude, I dropped to my knees and all but begged you to fuck my face. You didn’t do anything wrong.”
“Technically you were right. She’s not my kid.” The dude sounds so miserable that Dean feels like punching himself.
“You belong with us,” Cain adds. “Can’t you feel it, Dean? Truly? When you listen to your senses? Your heart? Your scent combines with ours to make something new, something wonderful. I believe we were destined to be together.”
Over the past six months, the slow pace of living at the beach house has given him a honey-gold tan, and an abundance of freckles that are scattered across his nose and explode down over his shoulders and chest. So what if he doesn’t have a six-pack anymore, he actually thinks he doesn’t look half bad for a guy his age. He could do with a haircut though, he thinks running his hand through his hair. It’s not quite Sam levels of ridiculous but it’s getting kind of floppy and curling around his ears.
“Peachy,” Dean snaps, because he’s not a damsel in distress and he doesn’t need saving. Not even by a handsome alpha who smells mouth-wateringly like freshly baked pie crust. “I was just leaving.”
“Well, got to hand it to her,” Dean says. “She did a good job. You’re probably the most deviant person I know.”
“Yes, Dean,” Cas says, brushing his thumb across Dean’s lips which after all the kissing and… other things, must be swollen red.
Dean’s date doesn’t go well. Uriel is a close friend of Zachariah’s and his personality is just as obnoxious as that dickwad’s. He’s as broad as a barn and the way he looms over Dean is designed to intimidate. His scent reminds Dean of curdled milk and his smile never once reaches his dark eyes.
“Nothing,” Dean says, wrapping his arms around Cas. It’s like hugging a marble statue, he’s so stiff. “Just Crowley being Crowley, you know what he’s like. What the hell happened to you? Are you okay?”
“Oh my god,” Dean moans around the next spoonful. “This is the seriously the best thing I’ve ever had in my mouth.”
Dean has been on them since the early signs that his first heat was about to hit when he was fifteen. He hadn’t wanted the humiliation of going through a heat then. He doesn’t especially want to go through one ever.
“Yeah, well it was a dumb reason. And I was dumb for believing that I could stick it out in a place like this. I’d rather take my chances with heat-sickness than be brain-washed into believing I’m nothing more than my screwed-up biology.”
“While there would be absolutely nothing wrong with Dean visiting a beauty salon, I can assure you that he needs no help to look good. As unbelievable as I’m sure you’ll find it, he really is naturally this pretty.”
“We’re both newly divorced. I don’t think either of us is ready for commitment again,” Cas says gently, his arm not budging from Dean’s shoulders.
Instead of laughing at Dean’s lame flirting, Cas leans in close and whispers in his ear. “Later, I’m going to bend you over and fuck you while you’re wearing just those boots.”
“Darling, I know I’m smooth. And I know you’re not as unimpressed as you’re pretending. I can smell your interest from here.”
“Anything,” Cas says, despite Deans teasing grin. “But I will expect you to spill all your dirty little secrets in return.”
He’s so caught in the thought that he literally jumps when Gordon drops down in the chair Benny just vacated.
“Well, I’m not fucking interested in sleeping with Crowley,” Dean bites out, because he doesn’t like what Cas is close to implying. “I love you, Cas, I would never cheat. You should know that.”
Instead of shooting him the usual scathing glare that she reserves just for him and people wearing Trump caps, Meg smiles. It’s at least eighty percent fake but even that is more than she normally attempts. It’s weird and unsettling, and immediately puts Dean on edge. It’s a feeling that lasts throughout the meal.
If Dean didn’t know better he’d call the expression on Cas’ face a pout. It’s impossible not to find it adorable.
Dean rubs his hand across his face. He knows all this. He just doesn’t know exactly what he’s supposed to do about it. He’s never been a relationship guy; this shit doesn’t come naturally to him. It’s not like he can just flip a switch and suddenly want to become the perfect submissive omega.
“Dean, I know you might not believe this, but what I did, it was for you and Sam as much as myself. I loved you both so much, but I was dying in that house. Slowly, who I was, the woman you boys and your father deserved, was withering away. Leaving wasn’t easy, but at the time I felt like I was out of options. Staying would have killed me.”
“I figured,” Dean says, snide, he’s being an asshole. He knows he is, but he can’t seem to stop himself.
Dean thought talking to Ben on Christmas Day would leave him feeling miserable, but in fact, he’s grinning by the time they say their goodbyes. It hurts less being apart from his son when he knows the kid is having a good time. And that he hasn’t completely forgotten about his old dad. He calls Sammy afterward, tries not to laugh when his brother has to cut the call short because baby Grace Exorcist vomits all over him. Dean’s inordinately glad he’s over the baby stage in his life.
Cas scowls at him as he marches them towards a gold monstrosity of a car, one that Dean recognizes from the shit show back at Crowley’s club. God, was that really only a few nights ago? It feels like years.
If possible, Cas’s muscles tighten even further as he grinds out an unconvincing, “no.” And Dean can practically see the pout on his boyfriend’s face.
“They don’t count,” Dean grumbles more or less under his breath. Ignoring Cas’ scoff, he changes the subject. “So, what do you think this meal is in aid of? Lisa said there was something we needed to talk about but she didn’t say what. Did Meg give you any clue?”
They would probably go on dodging each other for longer but Sam keeps sending Dean photos of Grace being adorable and Dean really needs to show them to someone who’ll appreciate them. He tries sending a couple of pictures to Ben, but the kid is plainly less than impressed by his baby cousin.
“That was a godamn dumb move, Dean. Do you even know the trouble you could have gotten yourself in. Thank god Charlie knew where you’d disappeared to.”
“Oh no,” Ellen says, dragging Dean out of the room by the shirt sleeve. “What y’all need are cold showers and a good night’s sleep. This is a respectable Den not a pay by the hour motel. And if I find any of you sniffing around Dean’s room tonight, I’ll be pulling out my shotgun, is that clear?”
By day five Dean’s heat has passed. He wakes up in the middle of a heavy-limbed puppy pile stinking of sweat and sex. His mouth tastes like something curled up and died in it overnight, and his ass is aching in a way that isn’t entirely pleasant. He definitely feels like he’s been rode hard and put away wet. He also feels weirdly content.
The atmosphere does tend to be strained when the four of them meet up. Meg and Lisa may be best friends, but Dean and Cas don’t have much in common, and Meg has never hidden the fact that she doesn’t think Dean is good enough for Lisa. The few times that Dean has brought that up with his wife, she’s laughed it off as Dean imagining things. Admittedly, Dean might be a touch over-sensitive but he’s not imagining anything. At Dean and Lisa’s 10th Anniversary party, Meg, after having consumed half her body weight in champagne cocktails, flat out told Dean he was just a pretty face with a whole lot of nothing going on between the ears, and that Lisa would never have married him if she hadn’t fallen pregnant.
Dean doesn’t think so. He’s done being a passive participant. Instead of trying to pull away from the alpha, he charges forward, taking her by surprise and unbalancing her. He’s on his feet before she can do anything about it, and this time he’s determined not to let her get close enough to touch him again. But he also doesn’t want to turn his back on her.
“Are you sure?” Cas asks. The MC is asking people to sit back down, appealing for calm. Dean nods. “We’re nearly done,” he says. “I should stay.”
“I didn’t,” Mary says again, obviously desperate for Sam to believe her. “This... this director, he called me, took me out to lunch a few times. He said he’d seen me on stage in England, had heard I was in LA now. I was flattered, and he was charming. A bit odd maybe, but he... he was kinder to me than most people have been in this city. The last time we met, a few days ago, we had a few glasses of wine, and... and he mentioned you, Dean. He said, he said that I reminded him of you in a way, and I didn’t mean to tell him, but I guess it all just kind of spilled out.”
“That’s enough!” The hairs on the back of Dean’s neck stand on end at Cas’ growl. “For someone who professes to care about omega welfare, your outdated perceptions and disrespect are astounding.”
Coffee mug in hand —world’s best Dad mug that Ben gave him on Father’s Day when he was eleven— Dean hobbles out to the balcony, blinking against the morning sunshine.
“Good god, boy, since when did you care so much about normal?” Ellen sighs deeply. “As long as no one is getting hurt, and all of you, and I mean, all of you, are happy, then what’s the problem?”
“Your bitch of an ex fuck you over too? That why you’re rooming with that weirdo?” Gordon nods his head towards where Cas is sitting cross-legged on his chair drinking something bright blue with two umbrellas sticking out of it and laughing as a guy —young, lithe, and definitely Cas’ type— plops a Santa hat on his head, tugging it down over Cas’ unruly hair so it covers his ears.
“Oh?” That’s news to Dean. Jessica and Sam were all over each other the last Dean knew. And the last he saw. He still gets unwanted flashbacks to seeing his baby brother sticking his tongue down that poor girl’s throat. God, seventeen-year-old boys are gross.
Dean can’t say he’s not relieved. Marv’s departure has already improved his day, his week, heck... his year, by at least 50%.
They’re both smiling at Ellen in what they must think is their most charming way. Dean is definitely charmed, but even he can see the way they’re sniffing the air and practically basking in Dean’s scent.
His knees are still trembling when he collapses onto his bed a few minutes later. Kicking off his pants, he wipes his sticky shamed dick with his boxers before pulling his sheet on top of him, rolling over, and falling asleep with his beet-red face buried in his pillow. He half hopes he’ll smother himself so he doesn’t have to face Cas in the morning.
!! You know what’s not easy? Growing up knowing your mom didn’t love you enough to stick around. That’s not easy.”
“Have you seen you and Carmen? Damn right it’s a good idea. Probably the best I’ve had in a long time.”
Dean kisses the top of her head. “I’m just glad you, Dorothy and Gilda worked things out in the end.”
“You know, Dean,” Cas says, watching him with concern crinkling his eyes. “If you would start coming to my classes, it would help your back enormously.”
And fuck him. Dean hasn’t always been the most confident actor in the world, but he’s proud of the work he’s put into playing Jason Todd. He knows it’s not his fault Marv’s movie sucks.
“You think there might be a reason for that?” Benny points out. “Everyone struggles for the first few days. Especially when they come off their meds.”
Charlie kicks him again, right on the same spot. Dean hisses. “Liar,” she says. “Tell me or I’ll tell Ellen you’re having second thoughts about Marvin and desperately want a second date.”
Dad snorts. And okay, Dean still isn’t exactly a straight A student but with a little help from Aiden his student tutor he is passing all of his classes. Even fucking Spanish. It’s kind of annoying actually that Dad and Sam don’t notice when he’s doing well. They’re quick enough to point out when he screws up.
“Good work today, Dean,” he says, cat-got-the-cream pleased smile on his face. “You really yanked it up a gear.”
Dean knows this is a bad idea. But Dad’s been gone for weeks and the landlord is talking about throwing them out, or taking the rent out in trade on Dean’s ass. Maybe if the guy was less detestable Dean would consider that but the dude hasn’t showered since 1984.
Dean figures he should probably try and smooth things over, otherwise he suspects she’s going to get them all thrown out of the bar. Not that he would blame her. Before he can lever himself upright, however, there’s a flurry of activity from above him. Angry shouts and waving arms and too many feet scuffling around him for comfort. Dean can feel the attention of the whole bar zeroed in on them and prays for the floor to open up, swallow him whole, and save him from further humiliation. The floor stubbornly declines to help. “Thanks a lot, asshole,” Dean grumbles slapping his palm down onto the sticky boards underneath him.
Dean nods and takes his and Cas’ plates away to rinse before he loads them in the dishwasher. “Sure. Yes. We absolutely are dropping the subject. So, you want to watch a crappy movie with me?”
“Do you think that’s wrong?” Dean asks, when Cas says nothing. “Do you think I should look for her?”
“Good night, Dean,” he says, gaze drifting briefly down to Dean’s lips, before meeting his gaze again. Then, the asshole smirks, turns, and walks away, leaving Dean a little breathless and a lot confused.
Dean wants one of them to touch him. He wants to feel them all touching him. He doesn’t want to have a conversation about it. And he doesn’t want to choose. He didn’t know that when they talked about omegas going into heat, they meant it so literally. He’s burning up. Sweat dripping down his face, beading across his collar bone. He can taste the salt of it on his lips. Can hear the roar of his blood rushing through his veins.
“So, just because I like the smell of someone means I’m their soul mate? I don’t buy that. And what if I don’t want to be part of a pair? What if I’m perfectly happy staying single?”
“Don’t worry, you won’t catch me,” Dean tosses back flippantly, his mouth too smart and too quick for his own good.
“No, Jerk, I pay my wages. And everyone else’s. And deal with all the boring business shit, as you call it. And set your schedule.”
him. In the end, common sense wins out. He hasn’t smoked since he was a teenager. Now, probably isn’t the best time to restart.

Dean stiffens. The last thing he wants is the cops turning up and making even more of a scene. This whole thing is humiliating enough.
His dad is still recovering from the discovery that Dean has bagged himself three alphas. Dean actually thought, from the worrying color his father’s face turned and the throbbing vein in his temple, that John Winchester was going to have a coronary. Still, in the end, he took the news better than Dean imagined. The three alphas towering over him in his living room, probably had a little to do with that.
“I ain’t a whore,” Dean snarls, feeling a huge burst of satisfaction at seeing Uriel bent double and clutching his face. “Or a bitch.”
“It means that you’ve helicopter-parented that boy so badly he probably doesn’t even know how to make his own bed never mind his own decisions.”
Dean’s five and a half, nearly six, and he knows how to make him and Sammy a pb and j sandwich, and pour just enough milk into the cheerios not to make them too soggy. Daddy works real hard, and says Dean’s a big boy now, too old for bedtime lullabies and coddling. Dean’s stopped asking when Mommy’s coming home because Daddy yells when he does.
