Dean ran in as fast as the bags he was carrying would allow him. He took a moment to unstick his wet shirt from his chest and shake some excess rain from his hair with his free hand. After wiping his shoes on the carpet just inside the door, he headed for the elevator. He stopped short when he saw that Some Dumbass First Name Novak was standing right in front of it with a couple other lawyers Dean knew by face but not by name.
“Yeah, I’m not callin’ you that.”
Cass nodded and Mrs. Black ushered him out of the house, then latched onto his arm and told him to brace himself before Disapparating them both to her house.
Something darkened behind Dean’s eyes. “No,
Castiel watched him leave, feeling deep in his gut that something wasn’t right. He’d succeeded, but at what cost? He walked through heaven, speaking to the angels that would even look at him. He was in the middle of a conversation with Hannah, trying to explain what happened when the alarms began to sound from the Axis Mundi.
“Fuck, fuck - is this really fucking happening right now?” Dean’s words were awed, and Cass’s responding nod only drove Dean deeper into his throat. “Shit- uhh, Cass, jesus that’s -”
“Yeah, y’know… just been a long day. I went to work before I came out here, and it ain’t like it was a short drive.”
other than Sam, when even Dean himself had been told off for it?
He blinked, then glanced at the calendar hung up next to the fridge. Yep, it was definitely Thursday. “Uhh… hey, Lis. Aren’t you gonna be late to your girls… whatever?”
(See the end of the chapter for
When he landed and steadied himself, a grin slowly appeared on his face. Standing not more than two feet away from him was Dean Winchester.
Whatever he
Oh wait, that’s a lie. John Winchester was a grade-A dickbag, and Dean was just the unlucky son of a bitch that got to call him Dad.
It’s all there in the name.”
He was gaining on the two Seekers when they abruptly turned, flying up and to the right of where they’d previously been. Dean did his best to follow, but his Cleansweep was decidedly slower than the brooms the Seekers had. He heard the chaotic buzzing of a nearby bludger just as Finnick and Charlie both reached out their hands. He swung with every ounce of energy he still had in him, and sent the bludger towards Charlie.
Dean’s face turned red and he shook his head quickly. “We uhh… we set aside our differences.”
“I told Samuel this was a bad idea. He should have rescheduled for a night where there weren’t record-breaking storms in the forecast.”
Professor Trinket then called several more students to the front, none of whom produced anything close to what Castiel did. A few managed that strange mist, but nothing with any real shape. Dean kept his eyes on the desk until Professor Trinket called his name.
Not for you.”
“Yeah, right after Wood gives his speech. We might be eighty by the time we get out there to actually play.”
call you to fight for me, Dean. And you will obey me, or it will be you that watches everything you stand for burn to ashes in front of you.” He closed the distance between them and gripped Castiel’s forearm, turning it so his palm was facing up. “And for your defiance leading up to the Games, and your… attitude this morning, I will make sure to send your mother and father a
Dean clicked his tongue. “We’ve got a smart one on our hands.”
His shower was… fulfilling, and he had just finished heating up some dinner his brother Sammy had brought over the night before when the doorknob turned. His stomach twisted as the door opened and Lisa walked in.
He teleported to Heaven, his wings extended wide behind him. As he walked towards the garden, he noticed flashes of white in his periphery - when he turned his head to see the cause, he stopped dead in his tracks. For the first time in years, his wings were white and glowing with holy light. To his surprise, he immediately felt disconnected from them, like they weren’t his at all - but some foreign entities reminding him that for the foreseeable future, everything in his world was going to be wrong. He tucked them away, no longer wanting the reminder that his connection to Dean Winchester was gone.
Castiel was in shock. Had Hufflepuff
Sam was shaking now, and he could feel his face heating up. Sirius stomped hard on his foot, which earned him a glare from Sam, but he forced himself to relax his fists because this was far from over.
he’d like to make that offer to someone and have them say no. To have someone ask him out
Castiel heard Sam and his face momentarily showed
The bowtruckle on Cass’s knee hopped back over to its owner and disappeared into Newt’s robes, and Dean moved his knee just enough to brush against Cass’ without making it obvious.
He snapped his fingers and disappeared before Dean could say a word.
Long walks on the beach and frisky… well, I’m not really all that picky.
That got his attention.
His face flushed. “First of all, quit friggin’ callin’ him that. Second of all, I am. But it’s not exactly a state secret you and I don’t get along, I’m just tryin’ to make this shit as painless as possible.”
not the guilt they deserve. I have never felt less guilty about anything in my entire life. Valiant effort, for sure… and better luck
Dean searched the pitch for Finnick, who was flying well above everyone else, his eyes scanning the area below him.
Cass looked exasperated, and Dean laughed from somewhere deep in his gut. “Relax, Cass. I know we said we’d wait. You aren’t gettin’ your hands on
He blinked. He reread the words three times, because he couldn’t wrap his mind around someone being so blatantly conceited. He straightened in his chair and flipped back to the messages, some strange urge to defend himself overtaking the desire to just delete the message and move on.
a half a dozen times.
maybe, they’d be able to gain some momentum in their otherwise stagnant war against Voldemort and the Death Eaters. Their rebellion had started with kidnapping Crane, and ultimately had culminated in Shurley and McGonagall kicking Crane and Flickerman out of the school. A few days later, Professors Greyback and Crowley followed them. Sam had no idea what was going to happen at this year’s Choosing with both of their usual hosts banned from the castle grounds, but he only had a few more hours to ponder that, as the Choosing was that evening.
“Honestly? That’s highly likely.” Castiel shrugged, opening his eyes and turning his head to Dean. “Big spoon or little spoon?”
“You gonna come tell me I’m wrong?”
Everything came down to this decision. If Flickerman was found guilty of Finnick Odair’s murder, the tide would turn and maybe,
“Sirius, shut the hell up, man, look at them! They’re smiling - they’re freaking smiling, he - Dean won, I think Dean’s okay!”
“You don’t need to call me anything.”
“It was going to be hard enough to wait until June as it was, Dean. Agreeing to be alone with you multiple times a week…” he trailed off and shook his head. “I wasn’t sure I’d be able to do it. As an educator, your education is - and must
Told you guys it'd happen eventually! :)
Dean chuckled. “Yeah, thanks, man. I highly doubt I’ll be takin’ you up on that offer, but I appreciate it anyway.”
Castiel stood and carefully helped Dean straighten his robes. “He gets mad and he
He huffed, looking away from Castiel. “Yeah, trust me, I fuckin’ remember. But it took you, what, like 6 seconds to heal me and get me back on my feet? This wasn’t any different than any of the other hunts we’ve gone on where I get my shit rocked and you patch me up. But we
Dean shook his head. “Nah, he’ll either be back or he won’t. I’m not gonna lose sleep over it either way.”
Castiel drank the potion and shivered as his body morphed into Dean’s. He moved to open the door, and when it swung wide, he found himself face to face with Severus Snape. “Going somewhere?”
It was hard to argue with that logic. Cass was by no means the biggest he’d ever been with, but
Woulda been a little on the nose, but…”
Cass obliged, picking a new patch of skin to taste as Dean let out a moan. Cass broke his cardinal rule and scanned Dean’s mind, searching for any sign of hesitation or resistance. What he found there had his cock rapidly thickening inside his slacks. Dean was already imagining what it would feel like to fuck - or be fucked
The group of students filed into the classroom behind Professor Crane and took their seats. When Castiel sat down at the end of a row, the other students seemed to make a point of avoiding the seat directly next to him. This didn’t bother him, until Lisa Braeden was the one that filled the spot. He pointedly ignored her and opened his book.
He frowned. “What do you mean, by now? It’s only been a few months and this place is friggen huge.”

He boarded quickly and moved to the back, assuming they were all going the same place that he was. He chewed on his lip and tried to make himself invisible without looking like he wasn’t supposed to be there - which was turning out to be harder than he thought.
“Yeah, yeah. Food first, ask questions later, right?” He turned to kiss her properly and then nodded towards his brother. “You good?”
Castiel kept his eyes down but heard Aunt Naomi leave the kitchen.
Dean flinched slightly when he heard Cass, but nodded. “Yeah, me too. This place is gonna suck without you.”
He quickly turned and grabbed his suitcase at the bottom of the stairs before leaving the house.
Lisa cleared her throat and smiled. “Congratulations to the both of you. That’s really exciting news.”
He didn’t answer her, but he didn’t have to. That was the one thing he

time… nevermind.” Cass flicked his thumb over the side of his mouth and then laid down next to Dean. He was impossibly hard, but refused to even suggest Dean do anything about it - it would be a miracle if Dean’s dopamine levels hadn’t already crashed. He did, however, reach a hand out and place it on Dean’s back, sending gentle waves of calming grace through him just in case. He bent the leg closest to Dean so his slacks hid his boner. “Are you alright?”
Dean was happy for Castiel. Or at least, he wanted to be. But the pit in his stomach wasn’t allowing much room for anything but nausea at the moment, and he realized with a jolt that Oliver Wood might

He smirked, rolling on the condom then grabbing the bottle of lube and slicking two of his fingers. He coated Cas’ hole and nudged a single finger in, loving the way the man’s body responded to such a mild intrusion. His skin flushed and his shoulders bowed, and after a moment, Cas rocked back on his finger. Dean let him go, his eyes wide and cock solid at the sight of the man fucking himself on Dean’s thick digit. He added the second finger and worked him open quickly. “You’re beautiful, Castiel. Fuck, I can’t wait to be buried inside of you… you want my cock filling you up? Gotta warn you though, I’m a lot.”
He smiled and rolled with a yawn so he was laying on his back. “The best nap ever.”
That's all for Part 3! Part 4 is the finale and will be posted next Monday in it's entirety.
“I dunno, Cas. Surprise me, just make it far away from here,” Dean said as he pushed himself up off the couch. “The whole place smells like vamp guts.”
Dean put both hands on Castiel’s face and kissed him, pulling back long enough to say, “This,
“I’m not sayin’ you wouldn’t worry about me, Cass. I’m sayin’ that at the end of the day, nobody’s gonna listen to me out there besides the damn kids. We need the professors on our side, here. The second you get the rest of us out of Purgatory, all hell is gonna break loose on Earth. It’s gonna be an all out fucking war, and you know it.” He pushed himself to his feet, turning to face Cass. “I can’t do what needs to be done out there, but I
He pulled his 1967 Chevy Impala into Sam’s driveway and got out, heading inside. He was the last one there and greeted everyone before heading to the kitchen to scrub the grease from his hands. “Smells delicious, what’re we eatin’?”
the guy’s cock felt so good stretching his mouth that he’d break every rule ever created just to feel it do the same thing to his ass.
“It makes an argument for nurture vs nature, but then when one adds in the
Dean knew he’d pushed him far enough tonight, so he quickly grabbed the blankets from their bag, enlarged them and laid them out. He pulled Cass to him and laid them both down, pulling one of the blankets over top of them and holding Cass tight to his chest. “I love you, okay? No matter what happens, that’s not gonna stop.”
summer?” Her smile faded slightly as she added, “I guess you didn’t get my letters.”
Dean let it happen. “No- well, yeah, but no. It was just once, a few summers ago. Some friends and I were playin’ that game, spin-the-bottle? Anyway, it was barely even a kiss, but the kid’s parents told my dad, and…” Dean fell silent for a moment, chewing his lip. “I didn’t even look at another dude after that, until you, last year.”
Dean fought tears as he spoke. “I’m not gonna die, angel. I’m gonna be waitin’ here for you to come back for me. And I know you will, I know you’ll come back.” He pulled back from the hug, knowing this part was almost over. “I’ve thought about this every fucking day for months, and I think I’ve got a plan if you’re ready to hear it.”
come out of the pile of swinging limbs, and he leaned against one of the pillars on the edge of the courtyard, crossing his arms.
The smile that played across Voldemort’s lips warned Castiel that this wasn’t a choice at all, but he was being tested. “You’re the victor, are you not? You survived when no others did. To the victor goes the spoils, Dean. Tell me what you want.”
Prim circled around in front of him and brought her eyes up to meet his. “It’s not, it’s not impossible at all. Caesar Flickerman murdered him and got away with it.”
Castiel kicked his chair out and stood up angrily. “What’s your problem, Dean? What did I ever do to make you
But he didn’t stop, he couldn’t.
It was inadequate and he knew it, so he let their bond convey the things he couldn’t get out in words. Dean nodded and Cas slipped the ring on his finger. “Told you it sounded like you were proposing. You coulda done it on the damn street corner, Cas. I’d have still said yes. I’ll

He kissed her back when her lips met his, and he decided to see exactly how bendy she could get with a stomach full of
Goal after goal, bludger after bludger, Dean watched helplessly as the Hufflepuff chasers took that game dangerously out of reach. The sun was setting behind the stands and Finnick appeared no closer to finding the Snitch. He glanced at the scoreboard.
that signaled someone else coming through the barrier. He grinned widely when he saw it was Cass, and abandoned his cart full of baggage to pull him into a tight hug.
Cass lurched forward, no longer letting Dean set the pace. He buried his nose against Dean’s pelvis, reaching up to play with Dean’s balls and pressing a single finger to the skin behind them. Dean cried out, his cock throbbing and pulsing as he emptied into Cass’s throat. Cass pulled off slowly, sucking hard and licking up every single drop that leaked from Dean.
This was the deep breath before the plunge.
Pink looked like he was going to say no, but his eyes were glued to Dean’s mouth. Dean flashed him a flirty smile and then plucked the straw from his drink, settling it between his teeth. It did the trick, Pink’s pupils dilated and he sucked in a breath. Dean raised his eyebrows and said it again, the very picture of playfulness. “You’re speechless, I get it. Dance with me, we don’t have to talk.”
A few years ago, Dean had still been living in Kansas when Sammy called and told him he bought Dean a present. That was a gross understatement, seeing as how that
“You’re uhh… Novak, right? As in Lafitte and Novak?”
man! You couldn’t have done that there?! We gotta go back, take me back!”
Dean turned quickly, his eyes cloudy but almost hopeful. He cleared his throat. “Yeah, yeah we do.” He started walking towards Cass, his steps no longer forced.
He blushed, utterly and completely grateful that it probably wouldn’t be noticed in the red light.
“Fucking bullshit, how the fuck do you admit to killing someone and still get off?” Cato’s words were harsh and perfectly echoed the anger that Sam was now barely able to contain. They released him when they were safely back on the street and making their way towards Professor Cinna and the PortKey he held to take them back to the school.
Cass smirked, and it was the first time in history that Dean had seen the man do anything other than scowl or frown. He noticed despite himself that it was a
He heard the damn thing power down, and the overhead lights switched to emergency mode, which meant they were now illuminated only by the flashing red alarm lights.
Happiness and hope threatened to split his chest in two. He pulled Dean into a kiss as that last haunting note rang out, and then the Garden plunged into darkness. But Cas didn’t mind… with Dean by his side, he’d never truly be in darkness again.
Sam heard the words come out, but all he could see was Dean. “N-no, Dean, this isn’t funny, okay? Castiel is dead, Rue’s dead, Finnick’s dead, but you - you’re
He pointed his wand at the lock as he spoke the word, but it didn’t budge. His frown deepened, his willow-and-unicorn-hair wand had never failed him like this. He licked his lip, searching his mind for a different spell to choose.
For the second time in as many days, Dean managed to push Castiel away right at the moment he needed him most.
Newt shifted to the seat across from them, looking back and forth between them. “I don’t exactly have a lot of other friends, but I could take an extended bathroom break if the two of you would like to get… reacquainted.”
“Half a dozen!” Sirius cut in. “I haven’t even read it
Castiel nodded and hesitantly hugged her back. “I did, but Mrs. Black I- I need-” he pulled back from her and handed her the star chart from inside his jacket. “I need you to read this and not freak out, okay? I need your help.”
He walked quicker, his mood absolutely in the gutter. He hadn’t been able to think of a single happy memory. He thought he’d found one, but it apparently wasn’t good enough. He’d thought about a time when he was just a kid; before he knew his dad was a hunter. Before his dad found out he’d kissed a boy. Before he’d found out he was a wizard, and the very thing his dad spent his life tracking down and murdering. He’d just been a kid, with a family that loved him and he loved back. No expectations, no pressure to be something or someone that he wasn’t. Or rather, to ignore the something and someone that he
Professor Crane looked between them with an eyebrow raised. “One of you will need to perform the curse on the other one. I don’t think I need to make all of your decisions for you, but if one of you doesn’t take the initiative… I’m sure the rest of the class would enjoy watching your reactions to a
He finally decided to go back to the basics, and used the Four-Point spell to guide him north. He thought that if he was able to find their first real camp again, he might be able to navigate back to Base without having to backtrack too many times. He was getting more of a workout now; without someone to help carry their things, most of it just felt like a burden to him. It didn’t help that now that he was on his own, he looked like an easier target so the monsters were attacking more frequently.
Castiel was quickly pulled from his celebrations when he looked at the time and groaned. He slipped away from the rest of his team and quickly ran back to his dormitory to change into his regular school robes before he took off in a sprint towards Professor Trinket’s office.
He shut the book quickly and tossed it on top of the other failed attempt. He glanced around the room and saw that a couple of people seemed to have gotten it correct already, which made him more determined to do this right.

Do I look the same?
Cass shook his head quickly, trying to convey that he had no clue how this got so out of hand so quickly. “Have you seen Dean?”
Dean closed the distance between them, placing his hands on either side of Cass’s face and resting his forehead against Cass’s. “What I want… is for this to be over, and you and me to run far the fuck away and never go back. Just you and me, maybe throw Sam and Finn and Sirius and Newt a bone and let them visit every once in awhile, but just - just you and me. But that can’t happen until we’re

he tortured an innocent man.”
He avoided his teammates as he walked into the changing room and pulled his robes out of his locker. He ran his thumb over the yellow number 4 that stuck out in bright contrast against the blood red background and thought back to the first time he put these robes on.
“Heya, angel.”
Castiel crossed his arms and didn’t move. “Dean, what’s going on? Why are you- why are you acting so weird? Just tell me.”
Hope sparked in Castiel’s chest for the first time since before Sam Winchester died. He closed the distance between them that was created when Dean pushed him away, and kissed him again. He poured a decade’s worth of longing and love into that single kiss, and something inside of him unraveled when Dean began to kiss him back. It was a slow process, getting Dean to open up and let him in. Cass nipped at Dean’s bottom lip, peppering shallow kisses as his hands found Dean’s face. Dean’s own hands were gripping Castiel’s sides so tightly that he was sure he’d have bruises shaped like calloused fingers if he weren’t an angel of the Lord. No, not an angel of the Lord. He stopped serving God a long time ago. Now, he served only the human in front of him, and it was finally time to prove it.
Carry on.
Castiel’s body tensed as he looked quickly to Dean’s knee. He’d been worked up the entire summer, and now he was back with Dean and it was being interrupted by four other men that Castiel certainly did
See you next Sunday! And I promise, there is a very Destiel point to all of this - it's just something of a slow, agonizing burn. :)
Dean’s shoulders slumped. “Yeah, no fuckin’ thanks to us.” He sat back down on the ground and rubbed his face. “You gonna tell me the truth yet, or you gonna keep lyin’ to me like we don’t have a bond that fuckin’
So Dean had packed his shit and moved to LA, where he’s been ever since. Turns out Cali natives can be dicks though, so he’d found himself in Sam’s office more times than he could count making sure he wasn’t gonna get sued because some dumbass wrecked the car Dean recently rebuilt. He was too good at his job to believe it was anything he ever did.
Wherein Cass starts asking the real questions.
“And hit the wrong damn person when it mattered. I think I broke Finn’s arm.” Dean tossed the quill down, leaning back in his seat and rubbing his face.
Happy Sunday, everyone!
He was pushed back down and Cass thrust back in. “Patience, Dean. I simply wanted to make sure I still had your full attention.”
He clicked the link to the profile and his stomach flipped as he realized it was Patrick, the only person he’d swiped right on with any real interest. He returned to the message center and licked his lip as he considered his reply.
“What - the -
Dean’s eyes landed on an absolutely beautiful man standing alone by the bar and looking as stiff as Dean’s drink. His eyes traveled slowly over his body and he studied the way his muscles moved under that stupid shirt. That stupid, ridiculous pink shirt that somehow had Dean wanting to rip it off with his teeth. He pulled his bottom lip between his teeth and pushed off the wall. “See ya later, Charles!”
“Hey now, one of your favorite songs came off that
How fast your learn the downhill side
Dean moved his hips a little faster and Cas reached down to stroke himself. Dean would’ve done it for him, but the thought of Cas enjoying this enough to touch himself did things to him that it shouldn’t. He suddenly hated the condom dulling his senses and wished he could feel every single centimeter of contact, every bit of friction created when he pulled almost all the way out and slammed back in.
“Yes, and how well did that work out for you last time?” Snape smiled cruelly as they approached the door. “He wasn’t expecting any…
“What?”
Dean made a frustrated noise but started heading back out of the alleyway. The jeans were so tight they accentuated his bow legs, and Cas’ heart nearly burst out of his chest. It was such a silly thing, to have that reaction to crooked legs, but it was so…
“I’m glad you brought zombies into this. Can you share with the class three differences between zombies and Inferi? You know, since you were paying attention.”
Cass wasn’t prepared for a version of Dean that
a first. Usually he needed to jack off while he was doing it, and even then sometimes he didn’t make it to the finish line. Something about that guy was off. Different. The kind of different people ruin their lives over.
under his breath and sat down. In the following moments, Castiel watched Dean’s lips move - but no sound was coming out.
Two more to go, thanks for sticking with me through this 😬🙌🏻
“Okay, I promise I’m almost done. So, once you find a way to keep it open, you come back for me. Get in here and
“Sit down, Cass. You’re not goin’ anywhere.”
Dean shook his head. “All yours…
He nodded and stayed quiet for a long moment. “Yes.”
The sad expression on Hannah’s face told him all he needed to know, and he closed his eyes. He extended his grace out in a last-ditch effort to find the soul that bore his mark, and
of an explosion. Crowley was so pissed!” Newt was rolling his eyes at Sirius’s story, but Peter was laughing hysterically. “Cass kept yelling something about Dean being an “enthusiastic stirrer,” which I thought was a euphemism, but those assholes hadn’t even admitted they had the hots for each other yet. I guess it was some kind of an inside joke, because Dean started laughing so hard he dumped too many ashwinder eggs into it and the whole cauldron burst into flames.” Sirius shook his head, beaming. “I barely got out, and one of the Hufflepuffs that sat in front of them had to be treated for third degree burns by Madame Harvelle.”
Shurley paused to let the students control themselves, but he was laughing and smiling right along with them. Professor Mills was crying in relief next to him, and even the usually stoic Professor McGonagall was applauding.
Voldemort’s eyes were narrowed and he stood swiftly. “I
Here, have a super long, super smutty chapter.
Osiris stood up, folding his hands behind his back as he studied Flickerman intently. “Let us begin. Did you murder Finnick Odair with the Killing Curse?”
It was Newt that grabbed Sam to hold him back. He clamped his hand over Sam’s mouth and forced him back to his seat, although Sam didn’t even remember standing up. Newt’s voice was desperate and quiet as he whispered, “Sam, you can’t. We were never going to be able to speak here, they brought us here to remind us of who we’re dealing with. You
“Hello, Azazel.”
Castiel wanted to agree. Wanted to reach over and kiss Dean until all the memories of the horror he’d been through disappeared, but there was one thing about what he said that made Castiel incapable of doing such a thing. “I can, Dean.”
He put his phone on silent and laid it face down on his bedside table before crawling under the covers and burying his face in his pillow.
The one where progress is won and lost and won again... or... lost and won and lost again, however you want to look at it. The baby steps are taken.
Sam blinked for several long moments, and the excited greetings that had been heard around them quieted. “What? D-Dean, I can see you, you’re you, okay? I- I know losing Cass was hard, it had to be - but… Dean…” he trailed off.
(See the end of the chapter for
as Dumbass’s eyes traveled down and settled somewhere on his chest. He was finally dry from the rain bath he took on the way in, but he still knew he looked good. And judging by the look on that guy’s face, he knew it, too.
just won the Quidditch finals? He lowered his broom to the ground and tossed it to the side, all the other Hufflepuff players landing and celebrating as well. Even Raphael had a smile on his face.
“Always,” Sam nodded back, leaning against the counter. “Are you? Uncle Bobby workin’ you too hard?”
He compelled anyone and everyone they met from the gate to the floor in front of the stage to get them through without issue. Every time they came upon someone new, Dean’s hand fisted around the back of Cas’ dress shirt in anxiousness, but it wasn’t necessary. They had no issues, and soon enough, they were standing just two rows back from the stage.
Sam sipped his beer and then shrugged. “Can’t complain, you know? Finals are a bitch, but I’m getting through them. I just want to graduate.”
Finnick shook his head and fell silent, but his fists were clenched under the table.
“No, not quite. Will you relax? I need you to trust me, we don’t have a lot of time to get where we’re going.”
Or, it wouldn’t have been, if there wasn’t a huge crack of thunder followed by the abrupt stop of the elevator they were in.
Nothing else he could think of even came close to that singular memory, unless he was counting what happened with Castiel on Christmas. But even that memory was tainted and tinged with guilt and regret.
“Bobby?”
“Your turn, Dean,” he said, as his final layer hit the grass below him. His torso was marked with angel blade scars, the evidence of thousands of years worth of wars. Dean’s eyes traveled over him as he shrugged out of his own layers, and then they came back together, bare chests flush as Cass’s mouth found Dean’s neck.
He stopped walking immediately. “That’s impossible.”
“Ya fuckin’ think? First of all, you don’t know jack
Happy Thursday! See you soon :)
Dean frowned at the floor for a long moment. “Y’know what, fuck that guy. Fuck anyone that’s gonna say shit about it, I don’t care. I got a whole damn year to figure out the consequences, and it turns out I’m not really a fan of closets.” He grabbed Cass’s arm, pulling him out of the compartment and into the hallway. He looked around them, noticing some kids scattered throughout the train. He looked at Cass, saying quietly, “Jesus Christ, I’m really gonna do this.”
back to him, but he couldn’t think of a single thing that wouldn’t just prove his point. He let out a sharp breath through his nose and sat down, leaning back against the wall.
again. An exact, perfect replica of the apple on her desk appeared next to it. She turned to face the class again. “However, the duplicates are entirely worthless as they will decay over time, so I wouldn’t be getting any ideas about the trophy room if I were you, Mr. Black.” Her cat-like eyes fell on Sirius, who donned the least-convincing expression of innocence that Dean had ever seen. He snorted, looking back at Professor McGonagall. To her credit, she offered Sirius a tiny smile before releasing them to try the spell on their own.
Dean didn’t address the class or Professor Trinket as he held his wand out in front of him. He was silent for a long time, longer than anyone else had been this far. The silence seemed to stretch on, and the students that had been watching him with interest started to look away. It was beginning to look like Dean wasn’t going to attempt the spell at all, and then he did.
He set his quill down as well, looking over at him. “I mean, you probably did. Bludgers hurt like a son of an assbutt.”
Sam chuckled a little and nodded. “Yeah, uh… Jess and I got engaged a coupla days ago. We wanted you guys to be the first to know, we’re gonna tell mom and dad tomorrow.”
got what he wanted. As his hole expanded to let Cass’ considerable width in, Dean was grateful Cass took the time to prep him so fucking thoroughly.
Sam honestly wondered if he should just lie, because Dean seemed unstable at best, but he didn’t have the time or the energy for it. “It’s kind of a long story, but we… we kidnapped Seneca Crane. We were trying to get him to tell us how to get you and Cass outta Purgatory, but Flickerman caught Sirius and Finnick as they were trying to get Crane back to where they grabbed him from. Flickerman… he, uhh… he killed Finnick. I’m so sorry, man, I know you guys were close.” Sam watched him, bracing himself for some sort of a mental breakdown.
and Cas took the opportunity to pull Dean to him in the same fashion. His arms draped lazily over Dean’s shoulders but he didn’t move, he wasn’t interested in dancing. He simply wanted to make sure he had Dean’s attention.
He stayed at the Black Lake as long as he dared. He came here a lot to be alone, drawing some small level of comfort from the water that barely rippled in the wind. The Black Lake was home to several sea creatures, including a giant squid, and yet… there was rarely a disturbance on the surface. Sam took strength and guidance from that as he stood up and brushed the dirt off of his pants.
Castiel closed his eyes again but only momentarily this time, his heart racing because this whole scenario was so familiar. Dean’s hand on Castiel’s face, Castiel’s heart beating this fast. It was just like Christmas, and he knew it would end the exact same way. He wasn’t sure his heart could take that right now, but he wanted it, too. So badly, he wanted it too. “Then what are we supposed to do, Dean? Tell me what we’re supposed to do because I’m telling you, on Christmas, it felt right. I felt… I felt safe and comfortable and everything felt right.”
Dean laughed. “The hell you don’t. It’s okay though, honestly, it was kinda cute. You drool, too”
I 🖤 you all.
“Then why call me back here? Why the plug, the show?”
You brought me to where Led
Dean watched a couple of guys run up the stairs in the corner and turned to his best friend Charlie. He had to yell in her ear so she’d hear him above the music. “Y’know, if the owners of this joint were bound and determined to name it after a fuckin’ Aerosmith album, they missed the fuckin’ mark by not callin’ it
Castiel was beyond grateful for Mrs. Black’s help, but really all he needed was a ride to Hogwarts. He just needed to get to Hogwarts. “I don’t have much of a choice, Mrs. Black. I’m so sorry I’m putting you in danger but… but if I can pull this off, I’ll be able to rescue Dean and so many other people. There’s still so many people alive in Purgatory, they’ve been alive this entire time with no escape. Bobby Singer? He’s alive.”
Wherein Dean struggles with what he wants.
It was already storming like crazy. Dean was mentally kicking himself for wearing a white shirt during a torrential downpour, but at least he wasn’t a chick.
“Castiel!” Joshua’s grip tightened as he pulled him aside. “What have you done?”
He stopped on a profile of a man with a strong jaw and dress shirt sleeves rolled up to the elbows.
one of them. Inferi, their mission is to kill outright, and they’re incapable of ‘turning’ someone living into an Inferius. Zombies ain’t real picky, they see a human and they go after ‘em. Inferi are usually enchanted to either target specific people or to guard a specific place, and they’d only go after the people that got too close. And last - and this is four, for anybody keepin’ track - zombies can usually be dealt with by trauma to the head. You can bash an Inferius’s brains in all you want, but those fuckers won’t die till you light their asses on fire.” He grinned and winked at Lisa Braeden, who was sitting next to him. “Doesn’t have to be their ass though, any part of the body will do the trick.”
Castiel smiled a little bit and squeezed Dean’s hand. “Angel, huh?”
Castiel shrugged, breathing out. “I wouldn’t know what I was either. Perhaps we could help each other figure it out?”
Dean slid into the driver’s seat of his ‘67 Chevy Impala and leaned his head against the headrest. The day had been long, and it wasn’t nearly over yet. As if a thirteen hour shift at the garage wasn’t enough, now he had to go home and deal with Lisa.
fitting.” Cass’s face was so serious that it took Dean several long, awkward seconds to catch onto the joke.
“Patience, Dean. I’ve been waiting an
Dean didn’t want to let go, so he didn’t. “Yeah, you too. Your summer okay?”
He frowned. “You did, really. So you missed one shot, you protected everyone else the entire game.”
“Yeah, you too, Lis. Night.”
Rationally, he knew he was hungry. He knew he should eat something, chug a bottle of water and scrub himself raw in the shower before finally succumbing to sweet unconsciousness in his bed. But all of those things sounded like they were going to take more energy than he could muster in a hundred lifetimes. His limbs felt like jelly as he climbed the stairs to his shitty apartment and when he closed the door behind him, he didn’t even bother taking off his boots.
Castiel looked around desperately for Dean. This was supposed to be an easy hunt - two, maybe three demons causing a stir in rural Wyoming. A milk run, as Dean would call it. Castiel wasn’t sure when ‘milk run’ became slang for ‘trap,’ but here they were. Surrounded by what seemed to be half the demon population -- and if that was an exaggeration, it made little difference to Cass. He searched for green eyes amid an ocean of black ones, but there was so much chaos around him that he couldn’t see much of anything at all. Panic rose in his chest and he called out for Dean in his mind, but got no response. He swept through the mass of demons, smiting and stabbing almost blindly in his attempt to find Dean Winchester - his best friend, the Righteous Man, and the love of his entire existence.
His words were cut off by Dean pressing the tip of his cock against Cas’ hole and slowly sliding in. The tight ring of muscles contracted just under the head and Dean swore under his breath, placing a hand between Cas’ shoulders and the other on his waist. “Fuck, Pink. You’re so tight, feel so damn good wrapped around my cock like this.” He’d slipped back to the old nickname and he knew it, but that’s all he could see in his mind. The shirt, the lips, the blush of his skin… the pucker of his entrance and the beautiful fucking curves of his cock. Everything about Cas was pink, and Dean would be damned if it didn’t seem like he’d found himself a new favorite color… or at the very least, a new kink. He’d never tell him, though.
Moments later, Dean was turning Cass onto his back, muttering a series of protection and healing spells. Cass knew something was wrong - he could hear Dean’s sing-song voice, but the blood wasn’t stopping. He blindly reached his hand up and found Dean’s arm, gripping it as tightly as he could as he cradled his other arm to his chest. “It’s not - Dean, it’s not working.” Castiel coughed and the motion sent searing, mind-numbing pain shooting through him. He forced his eyes open and saw a puddle of blood surrounding him larger than any he thought he’d ever seen. His eyes fluttered closed again in a sort of muted surprise, and he attempted to squeeze Dean’s arm again but couldn’t quite tell if the desire translated to actual motion.
Dean was obviously thrown off by this. “Cuz you’re into dudes?”
His eyes flicked between Cass’s and he nodded. “I know. But luckily for you, I got enough faith here for both of us. There’s nobody else I’d trust with my life like this, probably not even Sammy.” He pulled Cass into a hug and held on tight.
“Yes, Dean, six seconds that might have gotten us both killed. It was safer to bring you somewhere else, and now that you’re safe, I refuse to take you back.” Cass paused for a moment as reports over angel radio started to trickle in. Dean said something, but it was background noise. “They did it, it’s over. The demons are gone and Bartholomew is currently searching for the reason behind it. It’s over, Dean.”
Castiel let out the deepest breath ever and looked to the ground, his body visibly tensing. “It’s fine.”
“Dean? Are you alright?” Cass slid his hands up Dean’s back and gently rubbed his skin, and Dean nodded against the wood.
His breath caught in his lungs, and he was grateful that he didn’t actually need the air in order to survive or he might’ve died on the spot. It had been too long, he needed Dean. He turned on his heel and locked the already closed door and flipped the sign. When he spun around again, Dean was disappearing into the back. Cass followed swiftly, tugging his jacket off before he even rounded the corner. When he did, he froze, his mouth hanging open and his cock thickening so fast in his jeans he thought it’d keep going until it exploded.
“Yes, part of my mission was to ensure you and Sam stayed alive long enough to avert the apocalypse. Or, I suppose now that I know the truth… it was to keep you alive long enough to begin it. So it is written, so it shall be.”
His eyes flicked to his illuminated phone screen and he hesitated briefly before picking it up.
Do I look the same?
to, he had forced him to repeat the process on 4 other students. 5 times. He had cast an Unforgivable Curse 5 times, and he had hated every one of them.
James raised a hand to his ear, “what? Sorry, didn’t hear you… I don’t speak Troll.” Sirius tackled James and the two began wrestling in the grass. Dean chuckled and hung back to watch. They did this a lot, and Dean wasn’t necessarily worried, but the two did have the tendency to take things too far. He had lost count a long time ago of how many times the three of them had made trips to the Hospital Wing because of these little wrestling matches.
Wherein the idiots still fight but good things happen.
He nearly tossed the note in the trash as one last, final gift to himself.
little dating profile. Chances are, no one will even respond. You don’t even have to reply if they do, but you cannot spend one more Saturday night alone in this apartment hiding from your brother. You’re a grown man. Act like it.”
opportunity to stretch out his legs… and the legs of pretty much every guy that said the word “condom.”
He followed, careful not to make too much contact with Dean just yet - he couldn’t remember how the masses treated homosexuality during this decade, and he was already going to be pushing that boundary later on. It was best to keep himself in check until it was time.
Dean had stopped touching him. Cass’s eyes opened to see him looking honestly offended. He tilted his head. “Did I touch a nerve?”
Even as he said the words, he knew they were a lie. Yeah, he’d had his fair share of guys and girls alike in that back room. But even with the plug action he managed to get from his boot, he couldn’t believe he actually came from suckin’ the guy off. That was
with the guy and even I know he would take silence over Maroon fucking 5. Put on some Zepp or some Metallica or step aside.”
“Shhh, angel, shhh. Please, it’s gonna be - you’re gonna be okay.” Castiel could feel the warm tip of Dean’s wand repeatedly landing on his skin, and the soft, melodic tone of Dean’s voice was comforting to him. He smiled involuntarily at the sound, and then smiled a little wider because he was proud of his muscles for achieving such a rare thing. He would have laughed from the absurdity of it all, but he was slowly fading from consciousness and was now finding it damn near impossible to force his body to do anything at all.
hand controlling your orgasm.”
“Yeah, bet your open to a lot of things, pal.” Dean immediately grimaced, and he couldn’t work out whether he’d actually meant that as an insult, a come-on, or a fiery combination.
students, ones that Voldemort deemed unworthy. Voldemort hated anyone and anything that wasn’t a pureblood wizard. That included half-bloods, muggle-borns, and just about any creature that wasn’t a giant. Even Voldemort knew the tactical advantages behind having a giant on his side. The rest were disposable, and seen as less than human. There was a problem, though, as there so often is when bigotry is involved. And that problem was population. The purebloods were dwindling in numbers, and Voldemort created a solution: the Mudblood Hunger Games. He’d r0und up a mix of students and magical creatures from Hogwarts and give them a chance to prove that they belonged in his new world order. Names would be drawn from The Goblet of Fire, and unless someone volunteered to take your place, you were transported with the rest of the chosen few to Purgatory. Not much is known about what happens in Purgatory, but only one tribute ever makes it out alive. The rest either die in Purgatory, remain trapped, or… by some outlandish theories, are fed to Voldemort’s snake Nagini if they aren’t the first one to find the portal out of there. Dean shuddered at the thought of being fed to a giant snake, which causes Lisa to sit up and squeeze his hand.
, and the deafening roar from the crowd gave Cas a very quick crash course as to why Led Zeppelin was one of the most famous bands to ever take the stage.
go through. Now take the potion.” He pocketed the liquid luck and crossed his arms, hugging himself.
I prefer to base compatibility on something deeper than physical appearance, but if you must know, I’m decently tall and have dark hair.
Castiel jumped and quickly pulled his robes on, smoothing them out as he turned to Dean, his face flushed. “Oh, uh, sorry. I thought you were going to take longer.”
Mrs. Black nodded. “I’m going to Apparate you to just outside of the grounds, where you can take Sirius’s broom up to the Astronomy Tower. It’s just in the shed out back, we’ll grab it and head out immediately. Take your potion now, before we leave the house.”
Dean heard Castiel’s footsteps behind him.
Even Castiel chuckled at that one. “Where’s Finnick? Isn’t he always around somewhere?” Newt pointed out the window. “He’s there, I think he’s saying goodbye to his grandmother.” Newt looked over at Sirius and Sam. “You guys might want to make room.”
He rolled his eyes with a grin, pushing his fist into Dean’s chest as he stretched. “Shut up, I do not.”
Hufflepuff touched their meal and he wondered if it was like that with the other Houses as they made their way back to the common room.
“No shit, but … why…” Dean looked as confused as Cass had ever seen him, pointing back and forth between them.
All Dean could do was nod. “Uh huh.”
Can anyone guess what’s coming next? 😉 😂
“Dude, you don’t know Metallica?”
————————
He took it from her and quickly unfolded it, his eyes hungrily devouring the words.
Prim set up their makeshift beds and Dean went out to check his old snares. A couple of them had caught rabbits that were now too badly decomposed to eat, but the fourth trap he checked had a squirrel in it that was still alive. He quickly culled the squirrel and took it back to the camp, dressing it outside before taking the meat in to cook over the fire.
Dean laughed. “Hell, I figured you’d say Floyd’s.”
(See the end of the chapter for
‘Dean’ hugged him back, shaking his head slightly. “Sam, Sam wait.”
Okay, I'm impatient. Have the rest of part two :)

“It’s not an insult. You’re kind, caring, loyal… young with impeccable music preferences. Selfless and guarded… it’s just rare to see these days.”
“Great, well uh… why don’t you just stay on your half of this death trap and I’ll stay on mine, yeah?”
“Mmmhm. Get some sleep, angel. I’m right here.”
The command was silent, spoken directly into Dean’s mind, but his point was made. Cass opened his mouth wider as Dean thrust in, one hand now gripping Cass’s wing joint as the other used his hair to tilt his head back.
Sirius scoffed. “I bet he did, Chester. See, Winchester’s kind of like you, but he actually
Dean looked genuinely concerned. “Cass, there’s nothin’ wrong with that, okay? I don’t give a shit what my dad says, there’s nothin’ wrong with you just because you’re not into girls. You know that, right?”
Cass bit his lip, wondering if he should let the conversation stall there. In the end, he decided that conversation with Impala was harmless. He wasn’t asking for photos or saying anything inappropriate. He was easy to talk to, and had managed to get him to laugh for the first time in weeks. Maybe they could be friends, or as close to it as you can get without even knowing someone’s real name.
Left.
He huffed, but opened the book anyway. It had words this time, which he supposed was a step in the right direction. Or, word, he should say, because written on every page, over and over again, was the word
not just Castiel. He
Castiel stepped towards him, now half in his robes and half in muggle clothes. He brushed his thumb across Dean’s jaw, nodding with a whisper. “Me too.”
He changed quickly, then grabbed the Cleansweep Seven from the broomshed.
Dean seemed to struggle with himself for a minute, and his words sounded a little less convincing this time around. “It can’t happen, Cass. It just can’t, we can’t.
He spoke between quick, desperate, filthy kisses. “And you’re an arrogant child masquerading as a grown man, we all have our shortcomings.” Cass knew that in order to do what he really wanted, Dean needed to trust him. That obviously wasn’t the case yet and would likely take some time, but Cass was nothing if not a patient man. Until Dean trusted him enough to let his guard down, Cass would do this Dean’s way.
Castiel, for the first time this summer, fell asleep quickly. He was safe, he was happy, and he was going back to Hogwarts, which had quickly become one of his favourite places.
He left the car and round to the trunk, grabbing his suitcase out of it. He waved to Aunt Naomi again as she left, and Castiel realized he was alone again.
“Yeah, I know.” Castiel nodded and then cleared his throat. “Take good care of her, okay? I think she’s particularly…
He didn’t know if he actually said it out loud or if the words died before they could pass his lips, but he focused every bit of waning energy that he had on trying to say them. “I love you, Dean. I love you. I love…” Cass’s body went limp as everything went black.
If any of you made it this far, I love you. Thank you. See you Monday!
Exhaustion tugged at his bones and he truly didn’t know if he’d ever felt so low. Professor Crane hadn’t stopped with Newt. When he realized that Castiel had not only the magical ability to cast such a curse, but also apparently the
“Yeah? You gonna show me how to Transfigure your pants onto the floor?”
It took Cass a minute to answer. “Dean… my reluctance wasn’t because I didn’t want to help you. It was because I was scared.”
Cass closed the distance between them and laid a hand on Dean’s cheek. “You’re clenching your jaw.” A calloused thumb gently rubbed over Dean’s jawline, and all at once it was like the air from a thousand balloons was let out. Dean sort of deflated, but managed to relax his jaw in the process.
Big, big thanks to CeliPuff for the board!
‘Dean’ shook his head again, shifting his eyes around the room. “I’m- I’m not Dean, guys. It’s me, Castiel.”
Castiel hummed and fell silent, and Dean laid awake until he heard Cass’s breathing finally even out. He was still half-hard and completely unsure of his decision to leave things as they were, but he knew he’d feel like shit if he cheated on anyone — even Lisa. It just wasn’t how he was built.
“It was horrendous, thank you for asking. I won’t be seeing him again.”
Castiel nodded slightly as he understood. “If- if you don’t give a shit about what your dad says, why can’t you be happy too? He’s not here, he’s- he’s not at Hogwarts.”
“They won’t come for you.”
“No problem, Dean. You saved my life once. The least I could do was deliver a message.” Prim started walking again, and Dean confirmed with the Four-Point spell that they were still headed in the right direction, and followed her.
She took a moment to compose herself and then straightened her back. “Well then, Castiel. Everything I said to you up until this point remains true, as you are also responsible for saving my son. I will help you however I can. Do you have more Polyjuice Potion?”
that escaped under his breath. “Uhh… uh huh. Yeah. It’s… yeah, Taste. Mmhm. Right here.” He pointed to his phone as the guitar solo started, and to his dismay, Cass started air-guitaring along with it.
But now? Dean’s breath was hitching as Cass’s hands slid under his shirt and yes, those were Dean’s fingers digging into his sides and hooking into his belt loops.
why didn’t you just read my mind or somethin’?”
Cass hummed. “And yet, I fit so well inside of you, Dean. I could stay just like this, buried deep and not even moving. You feel so good.”
Dean wrapped his hand around Castiel’s yellow and black tie, and pulled him even closer. He bit his lip and pulled it back, releasing it a moment before kissing him again. He backed them up until Castiel hit the desk, and then Dean helped him sit up on it, settling between his legs.
Cass rolled his eyes so heavily he’d fear his head would roll right off his shoulders if it weren’t attached so proficiently to his neck.
Dean? I spent like a damn
He pulled his hand back and shook his head. “No, uh, I don’t think they’ll be too upset.”
All Castiel could do was nod and start undoing his belt. Dean waited until Cass’ cock sprang free and he whistled softly, wiggling his ass. “Bet that cock would feel so good inside of me, but unfortunately…” Dean sighed and stood up, pulling his jeans back up but leaving them unbuttoned. “I don’t fuck on the first date.” His tone was flirty and powerful all at the same time, and Cass was putty in Dean’s hand.
He raised his eyebrow but kept his eyes closed. “Don’t tempt me, Winchester. I frankly don’t care that we’re on a train full of wizards and witches and creatures alike.”
“Huh? No, wait… what the hell just happened?”
Hours, hours, and the moments in between
“I will. And I’ll probably save more lives than they did.”
Castiel furrowed his eyebrows. “Where’s Justin? Rue, even? They’ve gotta be around here somewhere. Or Charlie?”
His dad gave him the same look he used to right before things would get bad at home. He straightened up in his seat and leveled a glare right at him, daring him to do something in front of an entire classroom of witnesses.
This is what they’d trained him for. This is why Dean worked two, sometimes three jobs for years. Getting Sammy through law school and giving him enough cash to move permanently to LA so he could get his foot in the door at L&N, which was the law firm Sammy had had his eye on since his sophomore year at Stanford.
Cas nodded, unable to contain his smile. “Yes, and we need to hurry if we want decent seats.”
The one where they meet (again)
Dean began to drift off to sleep but was woken up by the sound of a voice. He groaned, “c’mon, Lis. Said we’d talk about it tomorrow.” The only answer he was met with was quiet snoring. He leaned up and looked over at her, and she was absolutely still asleep. “What the --”
Dean slowed down, leaning forward to bite Cas’ shoulder. “Now, now, Cas. You’ve got me high as a fuckin’ kite here, I’m not finished with you.”
They’d pulled within 70 points by the time Dean saw Finnick speed towards the ground. Charlie Bradbury, the Hufflepuff Seeker, was hot on his trail. Dean took off after them, hoping the bludgers would play nice and he’d be able to distract Charlie if not knock her off her broom entirely.
kill him. He took off at a run, shoving the broomstick back in the shed. He quickly shrugged off his robe and balled it up, hastily throwing it in alongside the brooms. He once again didn’t want to deal with anyone, and he had detention later thanks to him running out on Charms. He hurried back to the castle, changing into a spare pair of regular robes and headed towards Professor Trinket’s office when it was time.
Dean was actively trying not to sob with relief by the time he finished reading. His voice was thick as he spoke. “Thanks, Prim. This… this means a lot to me.” She smiled sadly at him as he pocketed the note. “Seriously, you have no damn idea how bad I needed that right now.”
He braced himself to have an Unforgivable Curse hurled at him, but it didn’t come. Instead, he was told to pick another student. Castiel scanned the room, looking for anyone that didn’t appear terrified. He came up short, as every single face in the room mirrored how he actually felt, despite his unwillingness to let his expression betray that. He chose Newt Scamander, a fellow 6th year Hufflepuff whom Castiel thought might be able to handle whatever was about to be thrown at him.
“You wear more fucking layers than
Osiris seemed oblivious to the struggle that was occurring off to his side. He finally stopped pacing and stood directly in front of Flickerman. “I have weighed your words and deemed them true. You are not guilty in the unfortunate, untimely death of Finnick Odair. All charges are hereby dropped, and you are free to go.” He waved his wand and the chains binding Flickerman disappeared. Osiris abruptly turned and left the room, and the second he was out of sight, Flickerman turned on them.
Sirius and James both turned to look at him at once, each one firing off an insult. James’s came first, with Sirius’ right on it’s heels.
Sam looked at him and sighed. “I can lend it to you if you’ll
Cass frowned, and it was a full body movement that had his shoulders slumping every bit as much as his lips. Like a fucking deflated water balloon.
The nod he received in response was slow at first and then more insistent, like the guy finally made up his mind that Dean was worth dancing with. Dean’s ego kicked in a little, here he was enraptured by this blue-eyed beautiful stranger dressed in pink and the guy barely seemed to register him. Okay, so he was gonna have to work a
“So don’t fail, angel.” He took a step closer to Cass, his voice unsteady. “You can do this, okay? I know you can, and I’ll - I’ll go back to Base if I can’t get through the portal after you. I won’t be alone, I’ll have Bobby and Gabe and the others until
Welcome to part three! If you made it this far, I love you. Grab a blanket, something stiff, and maybe some tissues. This is gonna be a bumpy ride.
So, he was trying something different. For a couple of years, he’d been on his own. He’d been happy like that. All work and a little play here and there, but nothing serious. But as his family kept repeatedly reminding him, he was getting older and was no closer to settling down.
Remus nodded, and tried again. “
I appreciate anyone actually reading this more than you know. Thank you. 🖤
Welcome back to the beginning.
“Don’t say that, Cass. I’m gonna be alive when you come back for me, okay? Once you get to Hogwarts, you figure out a way to get me out and come back for me. Look, I’ve already got my Gryffindor shirt on again, ready to be
The eye roll Cass threw in his direction could have won a fucking Oscar. “We should start with Transfiguration.”
He let out an exasperated sigh. Gabriel wasn’t unlike a kid in a candy store with potentially new information. Or a dog with a bone. Relentless and entirely too excited. “Yes, but I won’t be seeing
The next few minutes were full of broad hands sweeping over heated bodies and soft breaths ghosting over flushed skin. Dean couldn’t believe the way they fit together, even like this, and was determined to find out how well they fit together without clothes. The first time Dean’s fingertips touched bare skin underneath that pink shirt, the man moaned and Dean lost his fucking mind. He pulled Pink tight to him and bit his earlobe, then whispered right in his ear, “Come upstairs with me.”
Even still… it was going to be a long night.
Angels in full battle armor began appearing around him and Cass quickly followed suit. It didn’t take long to work out the fact that Hell was attacking - for the first time in his own memory, demons were trying to break down the gates of Heaven.
So, I know I said I’d keep writing this forever, but Sunday is going to be the last chapter - at least for awhile. It’s already written and I think it’s a solid ending point, BUT if my life becomes less hectic and I think of a decent plot line to keep it going, I left it open enough that it’s possible - so stay subscribed to this one! Either way, I’ve got some ideas for oneshots coming up so you definitely haven’t heard the last of me. See you all Sunday for what is hopefully just the midseason finale 😉
Clutching pages from your teenage dream
Happy Valentines Day! Let me know what you think :)
Awkward, tangible silence. Cass looked a little like he’d been caught in a lie, which Dean all too readily believed.
“You tellin’ me this place doesn’t have backup generators?”
“You really didn’t know my name?”
text to Charlie and collapsed on the couch, hugging a ratty throw pillow to his chest as he curled in on himself and willed his thoughts to shut up long enough that he could go to sleep.
“I’d rather you touched a different nerve, Cass.”
He wrapped his arms protectively around Dean as he focused very clearly on his goal and transported them back in time. His nose was bleeding when they landed, but he was otherwise unhurt. “Dean?”
gotta promise to let me finish before you get all pissy on me.”
happy enough.”
The air was blissfully warm when Dean walked down to the Quidditch Pitch for his final match of the year. They were playing Hufflepuff, and this would be the first time he’d really seen Castiel since their argument after Charms.
It's a bit late but hey, it's still Sunday. Ginger Baker dying this morning threw me for a little bit of a loop and I kinda forgot. Anyway, here it is - and I promise the official meet isn't too far off ;)
“I just didn’t feel like going tonight. I missed you and thought I’d hang out here instead. That’s okay with you, right?”
He carefully sat down on the chair beside hers and took her hand gently.
“Well there ya have it, Cassie! Call him!”
“Not yet, okay. Got it.” Dean moved a little closer, their bodies just barely touching. He waited until Pink looked up at him and slowly ran his tongue across his bottom lip, pulling it in between his teeth and letting his eyes droop a little. “You wanna dance? I gotta admit, I’m curious what that body of yours can do.”
“What makes you think I even care?”
Sam couldn’t stop smiling as they were dismissed, and he met with the other members of Team Free Will in the Entrance Hall.
“Are you sure? I think your mouth is plenty big, why don’t you find out?”
Just as he made his mind up to turn around and skip a lesson for the first time in his life, Professor Crane appeared at the top of the staircase. Castiel attended his lessons last year as well, but he didn’t think he’d ever quite yet used to the unsettling way Seneca Crane trimmed his beard. It looked ridiculous, as far as Castiel was concerned, and it was horribly distracting. It rose like a wave on the middle of his face and yet, the curves of it somehow sharpened his features. That was a trait he usually enjoyed, but with Professor Crane, it was just off-putting. Maybe it wasn’t the beard at all, maybe it was just the man.
Cass’s mouth drew him in completely and Dean risked a glance down, which proved to be a mistake. His cock throbbed at the sight of Cass with his cheeks hollowed out and those insanely bright blue eyes locked on his own face. “Fuck, jesus christ.”
“Wait, how the hell did you even get tickets?”
Mrs. Black reread the words and looked up at Castiel with a startled expression. “Is this true?”
His classes were through for the day, but his office hours were not. Students rarely needed him after class, but he’d made it a personal rule when he began teaching that he would remain in his office and accessible during office hours whether anyone came in or not. He was fidgeting with the trinkets and pens on his desk when his phone buzzed. He rolled his eyes when he saw the Bumble logo, and opened the app with the intention on deleting his profile entirely. It brought up the message center immediately, and Cass paused when he saw it was from impala67. He hadn’t heard from him since before his date with Patrick.
The paper found its way to his pocket anyway, but his eyes fixated on the trash can. It was… full. Curiosity getting the better of him, he pulled out one of the crumpled pages and smoothed it out over the bed.
This is decidedly NSFW.
Finnick nodded. “No, Novak. The
He grabbed his glass of firewhiskey and cleared his throat, trying to get everyone’s attention. “Hey! Hey, guys - alright, alright, quiet down for a minute. I just wanted to umm… take a moment to thank all of you. You guys have been great during all of this, and I… I don’t know how I would have made it through without you all.” He raised his glass and looked at each of them in turn. “But we can’t forget that Dean wasn’t the only one that was affected by this. Rue Marsh, Finnick Odair, and Cass Novak all died because of Voldemort. Each of their sacrifices led to Dean coming home, sure, but the war is just beginning. So here’s to Rue - for always being a ray of sunshine in the dark. To Finnick… for being our voice when we had none. And to Cass - for being our faith when all hope was lost.” He held his glass out, and one by one the others raised theirs as well and then drank deeply. Sam swallowed down the firewhiskey and looked at the ground, sucking his teeth. He looked back up and smiled sadly. “And here’s to Dean, the crazy son of a bitch that beat the system. Here’s... to Dean coming home.”
“Sounds like it’s just the one context to me.” Dean picked up his quill and started writing again.
They fell back into silence, and no matter what Dean tried to do - he just couldn’t get his mind back on track.
He sighed quietly at the woeful inadequacy of it, but the truth was that Castiel was fairly plain. He had no distinguishable marks, no tattoos or piercings, not even a freckle or birthmark to set him apart from the see of dark haired, blue-eyed white men approaching their mid-thirties.
“You’re correct. His story is one of my favorites… I believe Zeppelin’s comes as a close second.”
Have some unexpected smut.
Cass seemed to take forever in that shower, which gave Dean enough time to get through an entire Zepp album and start the beginning of Taste’s debut before he came back out. Dean was laying on his stomach tapping the drum intro to
Flickerman laughed. “If you count ‘dead’ as ‘fine,’ then yes - Finnick Odair is absolutely splendid right about now. I know this… because I had the ultimate pleasure of killing him myself.”
Welcome to Part Two.
“Nah, it’s fine. My mom wasn’t around a whole lot growin’ up and my dad… guess you could say he wasn’t
His face flushed, and he hated it. He spent a moment chewing on his lip to buy time - not because he didn’t know the answer, but because he wanted to piss him off. “Yeah, alright. So they’re both considered ‘living dead,’ yeah? Zombies are usually reanimated by accident, where Inferi are brought back on purpose. Experiments gone wrong versus intentional mayhem, y’know? Zombies wanna eat your brains, turn you into
Voldemort nodded almost approvingly. “Yes, you did. You bested my best - something that has been handled internally, I assure you… there won’t be any such mistakes moving forward. Now, Dean, tell me… what do you want to happen now?”
Cass walked back out to the meeting room, where Walburga Black was indeed waiting for him. She smiled when she saw him. “Dean! Sirius is going to be
The grand finale!
one.”
Cass watched Dean, a thousand memories of blood and tears and war flashing through his mind. “To hell with the consequences, Dean. It’s time I do what I should have done from the very beginning.”
that lasted nearly thirty minutes. Page’s guitar and Plant’s voice screamed and whined in perfect harmony, and suddenly a full half an hour didn’t seem like long enough, even to Cas’ ears.
Castiel cleared his throat and looked to Sirius. “I think I hear James calling you. Dean, you hear it too, right?”
He spun immediately, dropping his chest to the desk and not giving a shit about the things he’d knocked off in the process. He wiggled his ass and spread his legs, looking over his shoulder. “Fuck me, Cass. There are condoms and lube behind you, hurry the fuck up.”
The one where someone actually manages to make Cass smile.
And Castiel was more than happy to oblige.
“Now we’re talking!” James laughed as he sprinted up the stairs two at a time, and Sam raced after him.
amounted to something, at least as far as Sam was concerned. His brother was a hero -- his hero -- and if their parents didn’t understand that, it was their loss. It had been a year to the day now since his brother had volunteered to take his place in the Mudblood Games, and not a day went by where Sam didn’t think about him or acknowledge the fact that Sam was only free because his brother had chosen to put him first. Sure, the Choosing was meant to be Voldemort and a bunch of Death Eaters ‘choosing’ the tributes that would fight to the death for a place in Voldemort’s new world order, but Dean and Castiel changed that. They had chosen family - chosen friends… chosen love. They had made the choices that day, and in the week that followed when they had managed to get nine of the twelve tributes back home before they could even make it to Purgatory.
Castiel grinned and hugged Dean back, letting go of his suitcase. “I missed you.”
Castiel looked absolutely horrified, glaring at Dean. “Dean, what the hell?!”
“I know Metallica, Dean. Your humming skills are sub-par at best, and I was having trouble discerning whether you were trying to hum ‘Wherever I May Roam’ or ‘Nothing Else Matters.’”
“Maybe not, but it’s the best I’ve got right now with the options in front of me. It’s the option that
Dean’s hopes momentarily skyrocketed as the portal stayed intact when Cass vanished. He walked quickly towards it, his heart hammering, but it shrank and disappeared before he could get there. He spun around wildly for a moment, almost expecting to see it pop up somewhere else. But it was gone, and it had taken Cass with it.
She studied him for a moment. “You must be naturally gifted at Occlumency, and thank goodness for that. We won’t be able to Apparate to the school, I have a feeling they’ll be watching you closely. I already put Sirius’s broom in the car, we’ll need to drive there. They won’t be able to trace any non-magical forms of transportation. Once we’re close, I’ll let you out and you can fly to the Astronomy Tower. I updated Professor Cinna, he’ll be waiting for you after the official announcement is made that Dean won. Are you ready?”
Cass hovered over the delete button as indignation and a slight tinge of embarrassment worked their way through his bones. This sort of response had been exactly what he’d feared. He changed his mind at the last second and clicked on the link to impala67’s profile.
A quick check told him that the call button wasn’t doing shit, and after sliding open the escape hatch tile and doing some near acrobatics to boost himself up into the small opening, he’d discovered they’d stopped in the middle of a floor so no amount of trying to pry open doors would do them any good. They were too close to the top to actually try to climb out - if the elevator abruptly started working again, they could get crushed.
“She can and she will,” was Dean’s only response before he pushed himself to his feet and walked forward. His legs bowed out at an odd angle, something Castiel wouldn’t have even noticed if it wasn’t for how obviously Dean was struggling to take steps forward.
The sound coming from Cass could only be described as a giggle. “Could you imagine Syd Barrett and Roger Waters in a western?”
“Yes, we’ve worked closely for several years. I was the one that officially nominated him to become name partner.”
“Did I? Hadn’t noticed…” Cas looked away, the very picture of innocence.
He repeated that phrase in his mind until he finally, mercifully, fell asleep.
Castiel unscrewed the canteen and didn’t move for a long moment, before he brought it to his lips and took a long sip.
Dean glared at him, remembering all the times Sammy had tried to insist his name was Sam, not Sammy or Samuel. What was so special about this overdressed asswagon that meant he could call his brother
Close only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades.
He breathed out rather shakily and closed his eyes. He held his wand out and tried to go back in time to his happiest memory. He remembered the way Dean’s lips felt on his, the way his hand felt on Dean’s chest. He was so relaxed, so content at that time. He breathed out again and did the movement with his wand while saying “
“Did you get his name… his number? Anything?”
Dean was never very good at sitting still, so he fidgeted. Pulled his knees in and then stretched them out again, clicking his toes together like fucking Dorothy.

Dean nearly fell to his knees. He didn’t believe what he was hearing. He
“You mustn't give up on her, Castiel. She would have never given up on you. You know that,” Aunt Naomi scolded him. “Now, go tell her goodbye and meet me in the car.”
“Samuel refused to tell me anything about you. Believe me, I asked.”
Castiel watched Dean go, his heart racing.
Love you all.

A long pause. “Did you just do actual air quotes? On the phone, where no one could see you?”
Cass looked down and noticed fully for the first time just how bowlegged Dean really was. That bowleggedness was already starting to fade, however, and Cass realized the potion must be wearing off a lot sooner than Dean said it would. He quickly ducked around the corner, out of eyesight of Flickerman and the others. He took another quick drink, shaking his head slightly as it washed over him again.
erupted on his skin as Cass went further down. He gripped the desk behind him and bucked his hips forward, which earned him a narrow-eyed stare from the man now squatting fully in front of him. Dean bit his lip and looked toward the ceiling - nobody had a right to have sex hair like that until
He handed Castiel the canteen again and the rolled up star chart. “You need to take it before you walk through the portal, we got no idea what’s waiting for you on the other side.” He kissed Cass one last time, his hands on his face.
Dean was crying, but his voice barely wavered as he continued spell after spell, attempt after attempt to stop the bleeding and heal him, but somewhere deep inside of Cass, he knew it was too late.
A strong hand wrapped around his cock and gripped the base, and Dean felt his looming orgasm heading in the opposite direction. He cried out as Cass shifted, relentlessly pounding into him until Dean’s body felt like a string pulled too tight.
“I was caaalling to find out how your date with Patrick went.”
you, Dean. That sounds a little more than ‘just mad’ to me.” He paused and then flicked his eyes to Dean. “This is what you were talking about on Christmas, isn’t it?”
to you, cuz we don’t exactly have access to Owl Post out where I live. You deserve somebody that’s gonna be able to do all of those things, and not have to worry about what’s gonna happen if they do.”

After helping a few first years who were lost, Castiel eventually got himself through the solid wall that was Platform 9 and ¾.

Cinna chuckled. “I’m sorry I couldn’t make it more clear, but we were under strict instructions not to give you
He nearly hung up again. “No. It’s better left the way it is.”
“Huh? Oh uh, yeah, thanks.” He shifted his eyes to Dean briefly, but kept writing. “You played well too, from what I could see.”
Dean growled, and it might’ve been the hottest sound Castiel had ever heard. “Hey, Baby’s a classic. She wouldn’t hurt a fly.”
Dean nodded, his lip still caught between his teeth. “Yeah, I’m done tryin’ to pretend like I don’t, but I can’t really ask you to do that. It’s not fair to you to have to hide, especially when you’ve got Helm and his goons constantly giving you shit about not bein’ with anyone.”
Ten years after the end of the war, Cass and Dean finally tell their story and begin to recover.

more. He offered Cass an apologetic glance and leaned back against his seat. “How could anyone miss your ego, Finn? I’m pretty sure it reaches clear to the damn moon.”
caught a glimpse of the most perfect ass he’d ever seen as Cass dropped his towel. “Mmm. I suppose we will,” was the last thing Dean heard before Cass closed the bathroom door.
“Yeah, I … I appreciate that. Goodnight, angel. Thanks for hangin’ out with me.”
“Fuck, Cass - I’m -”
She raised her eyebrows. “Dean, the door was locked and you still haven’t given me a stinkin’ key. Although, judging by the state of you two... I’m glad you didn’t.”
He walked slowly towards the door as it opened, and his brother Dean stepped through. He stood there in shock for a moment before dropping the glass he was holding and rushing over to him, hugging him tightly. “Jesus, Dean, you did it, man! Welcome back!”
Are you all still alive? Still with me?
“There should be an entire ward at St. Mungo’s dedicated to whatever’s wrong with you,” Sirius began.
In the lobby of the Hotel Paradise
“Beautiful, Dean. Your body is so responsive, so eager… I think you’re ready.”
so just… knock it off, okay? Come get a drink.”
to tell me. Do you promise?”
Dean walked aimlessly for what felt like hours. It was the middle of the day, he knew that much at least, and Cass had left early that morning. He spent the first part of the day staring blankly a the spot where the portal had disappeared, half thinking that it was going to spring back into existence and offer him a way out, too. But it didn’t, and eventually Dean had realized that there was no longer a reason to stay out in the open like that. He’d packed up what he had left and started walking, but it occurred to him that navigation was going to be a lot more difficult now without Cass or his star chart.
Dean scoffed. “You don’t even know me, Angel.”
“No, but you are extremely on edge. Like I said, you won’t learn anything like that. Take a few sips, a couple of deep breaths, and then we’ll see where we’re at.”
The door opened and a very official-looking wizard escorted them into the courtroom. Sam glanced around quickly and was startled to see that the room was set up more like a Quidditch Pitch than a standard courtroom, with the seats extending upwards like in a stadium. He suddenly felt very small, but had a small, victorious moment when he saw Caesar Flickerman in the center of the room bound in chains and flanked by two Aurors. Sam had never seen an Auror up close, but they were basically the Ministry of Magic’s version of a magical army. They were both tough, hard looking men with various body piercings and long, leather robes. Sam had a brief thought that if Dean found his way out of Purgatory, he’d fit right in amongst the Aurors.
Cass seemed to sense it, because he pulled off and out with heavy breaths. “Turn around, Dean.”
“I assure you, it wasn’t Hell… although there was
“I always do, Castiel. You haven’t a need to worry about her.”
She nodded. “Everyone here saw, most of them just smiled and returned to whatever they were doing before.”
“He was taken to the House of Black, where he will start his life anew. Now, Walburga and Orion Black are good, decent people, and I’m sure they will allow Dean to write and visit and do all of the things that you are all thinking about right now. Just give him some time to settle in - try not to overwhelm the Black family with owls.” Professor Shurley smiled around at all of them. “Now go on - go celebrate. Hug your friends and make some new ones. All lessons will be canceled for tomorrow, and there is no curfew tonight. You may move freely about the castle, we know you’ll be in each other’s common rooms until the early morning hours anyway. I simply ask that you do not overwhelm the House Elves with requests for Firewhiskey.” He winked knowingly, and laughter erupted around the Great Hall.
(See the end of the chapter for
Some of you nailed it. Some of you got real close. Anyway, happy Thursday😊
Castiel watched him, blinking slowly. “If you what, Dean?”
“I like it,” he nodded. “I wish I had a nickname for you.”
Dean flicked his eyes up to Cass, his tongue darting out and pulling his lip between his teeth using the ring. Cass gripped the counter, desperately missing the way Dean’s lips felt around him. “Can I… help you?” Dean’s words were drawn out and sensuous, and Castiel got the impression he was in for a very long ride.
He straightened his robes and slowly moved to the seat Voldemort was gesturing to and sat down.
Dean eyed him. “No on both counts, but I appreciate the offer. I’m serious though, you’ve got a great cock. You’re welcome back here anytime.” Dean winked and then nodded his head toward the door, officially dismissing Castiel.
Cass laid in that bed until his chest stopped hurting. He had no right to be upset, he knew Dean wasn’t going to stay - he knew he’d never see him again - he had no reason to believe they’d have breakfast together and share some emotional farewell before parting. But this was the price he paid for being who he was. This was why he’d been alone for so long, unable to stomach the idea of falling so quickly and so completely for someone else and have it be unrequited. It was a curse, a curse he’d do anything to get rid of.
It was Dean’s 24th birthday when Castiel finally decided enough was enough. He was still no closer to finding out who did this to them and he was nearly coming apart at the seams from being away from Dean. He’d originally planned on waiting until Dean was a little older this time around, but something about the lip piercing, bright purple hair and tattoos covering almost every inch of Dean’s body told him that Dean needed him
A few minutes later, Team Free Will was opening bottles of Firewhiskey and passing around butterbeer in the Room of Requirement. Sam’s cheeks were starting to hurt from the grin that just wouldn’t fade as he looked around at his friends, and the people his brother and Castiel had saved. Sirius Black, Cato Chester, Beetee Latier, Luna Lovegood, Ash Harvelle, Alecto Carrow, Jack Morningstar, and Newt Scamander. These were the people that would be a living testament to everything his brother had accomplished, and everything that Castiel Novak had sacrificed. Lisa Braeden, Charlie Bradbury, Jo Harvelle, Johanna Mason, James Potter, Remus Lupin, Peter Pettigrew and his girlfriend Alyssa Blake were there too, each and every one of them smiling as widely as Sam was.
Dean Winchester studied Platform 9 ¾ with a weary eye. He was ready to go back to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, but he wasn’t entirely eager to leave the safety of his home. Despite the current state of the Wizarding World, Dean and his brother Sam had managed to have a pretty fun summer. Sam was a Gryffindor, just like Dean - but a year younger. Sam was going into his fourth year and Dean was heading into his fifth - which meant things would be different for him now. Ever since the dark wizard Voldemort overthrew whoever the last Minister of Magic was, Hogwarts has been more of a training ground for the older students rather than a place of actual learning. That suited Dean fine on most days, he preferred a hands-on experience to pouring over dusty old books in the library.
“Remember this, Dean. Remember how you feel right now, with
got a thing or two I’d like to
A long, bitter drag of whiskey later, Dean’s brain shorted out. “Oh. Uhh. Yeah. Oh. I’m uhh… no, I’m not.”
Silence filled the air around them, and Castiel finally took a moment to look around. They were on a grassy hillside that descended into a body of gorgeous blue water. Mountains rose up on the other side of the lake, reaching towards the sky not unlike a child would reach for their mother. It was breathtaking.
“Now now, Dean. Wouldn’t want to end up like your friend Finnick, now would you?”
Castiel bit his lip and looked down, speaking quietly. “Is that what you want, Dean?”
Castiel tensed and glares across the table at Voldemort. “That group of kids you took this year is the last, understand me? The ‘fire’ I have in me — I’m going to use it to burn you and everything you stand for to the ground.” He shifted his eyes to the snake. “I don’t know who’s uglier, you, or the snake.” He knew he only had one choice so he nodded slightly. “Give me the fucking mark and let me go.”
She nodded. “Alright, Cass. I’ll see you later.”
Dean was upright for another moment before falling on his ass as his knees gave out. “Where the…
On and on it went, through a version of
Dean was vaguely aware of people starting to stare at them. He cleared his throat, pulling back but staying close. “Oh y’know, it was uhh… it was fine. C’mon, let’s go find an empty compartment before all the friggen first years take ‘em.”
Dean nodded, though it was a movement Castiel couldn’t see with closed eyes. “I get it, angel. I do. But there’s a problem with your plan.”
“Gabriel, yes. I had a…” he swallowed thickly around the words but forced them out in an effort to end the conversation as quickly as possible. “I had a one-night stand. He doesn’t live in town, so that’s all it will be. One night.”
Aunt Naomi swatted at him with a towel and he blocked it with his hand, laughing quietly as he slid off the counter. “How’s uh…
get to spend more time with Dean, just the two of them. He quickly made it into Professor Trinket’s office and noticed that Dean was already in there.
and it was like a switch flipped inside of him.
Dean bristled. “I don’t need to explain myself to you.”
He stood a safe distance from them but close enough that he’d be able to catch the lift before the doors closed. None of them even so much as glanced at Dean, which suited him just fine.

was an entire auto shop. Dean tried to refuse, but the bastard had waited a full week after signing to tell him, which meant they couldn’t back out on the deal.
He wanted to say no, wanted to spit in his face and tell him either that Cass never offered or that Dean had refused anyway, but Cass’s comment about getting his ass beat in the staff room echoed in his head. He wouldn’t put it past his dad to do exactly that. “Yeah, I’m actually headed there now for the first little tutoring sesh, so if you wouldn’t mind…” he gestured towards the door. John visibly relaxed, which made Dean even stiffer. “Why the hell do you even care?”
He frowned but understood, nodding once. “Yes, alright, Dean. I’m going to the Hufflepuff common room, you can uh- you can join me if you’d like.”

Castiel looked a little panicky and really unsure but he nodded and wiped his cheeks with the backs of his hands, keeping his eyes on Dean. “T-tell me what I have to do.”

That word echoed in his head like an audible fucking nightmare. Groupies were loose chicks that were desperate for attention from any rockstar they could come across. Most of them were used up fast and thrown away, only to be heard from again as fuckin’ punch lines at parties. Dean Winchester was not a
on his desk by the time Professor McGonagall announced that they’d done enough for today. He had hoped to get out of there without homework, but was sorely disappointed when she assigned as essay on what possible applications the Doubling Charm could have in real life. He gathered his things and walked with Sirius and James back out to the courtyard. It didn’t take long before the two of them resumed their battle of insults.
“You can still sleep. I’ll sleep too. We’ll just sleep… together,” she grinned, shoving a bite of the leftovers in her mouth.
She frowned at him but took the scroll and unrolled it, her eyes flicking back and forth across the page as she read:
“Castiel.”
You guys get two chapters today because this one was short and I feel bad.
“Right, yes, okay. Well uh, I’m going to go change into my robes, I’ll see you for the feast, okay?”
“What’s the rush, Dean? If this is all you’ll ever let me have, I want to take my time. Fuck you properly.”
“So uhh… you know my brother pretty well then, huh?”
Newt nodded to Castiel, a silent acknowledgment that he knew this wasn’t personal. He stood and made his way down to Professor Crane and Castiel, and stood silently.
Wherein Cass does what Cass does best.

Dean got to his feet, looking angry. “Don’t you have some little animal to tort--”
“So what, you just… sat up in Heaven, laughin’ with your dickbag friends when Azazel killed my mom? When my dad sold his fuckin’ soul to save me after that accident? All of it?”
he got to his feet, screaming and cheering and shouting and crying. Every single other student at Hogwarts, even the Slytherins, were on their feet as well, adding to his elation.
The following moments were filled with tangled tongues and roaming hands, and Cas was content to stay just like that for awhile - it’s not as though they were on any kind of a schedule, time-traveling had a way of alleviating those concerns, but Dean had other plans.
The resulting glare he received from Dean would have chilled his bones if he were capable of feeling temperatures. He mumbled
