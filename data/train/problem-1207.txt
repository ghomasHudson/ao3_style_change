"Pyjamas for you, at least a pair of pants for me, and tea for us both," John said and scraped the back of his hand over his chin, then inspected it with a frown. "Shower first, though?" John lifted his head and met Sherlock's relaxed gaze, "together?"
“Still so many unanswered questions,” John muttered, glancing at the contents of Sherlock’s wallet one more time before setting it next to the envelope containing his pitiful excuse for an explanation. It had been more difficult than he had thought trying to write out everything that had transpired in the last few hours, not to mention who the hell he was and how Sherlock had come to be with him in the first place. What was worse was the fact that he had had to do so without knowing much of anything about Sherlock or how he would handle the information being presented to him at all, but somehow he’d managed to convince himself that this was better than the alternative: leaving the omega to wake in a strange location, in the midst of his heat, without any context whatsoever.
Perhaps he should have. Their first time at Angelo’s had been a wave of sexual tension and barely veiled conversation. Had Sherlock been so wrapped up in seeing what John wanted right then and there that he saw no need to dig deeper into John’s past? Possible. John continually threw out signals that his life before coming back to London had been painful and sorted in ways that left him still having the occasional nightmare.
With a small twist of his body, Sherlock moved so that his lips began to touch John’s neck and gave it a small kiss. John hummed a bit deeper. Good.
“Wait—” Sherlock gasped into John’s lips, sliding his hands down to the doctor’s waist. He slipped his trousers down, pants and all, until John’s cock bobbed free against his stomach.
He swayed, John, still lifeless in his embrace, back to lay down on the bed. John babbled something about Morse code and tattoos, but Sherlock couldn't quite make it out. He'd have to ask John later on.
"And Mary? You said that you would tell me everything about you and her, but honestly, I don't need to know any more than you have already shared. Especially after you told me that you love me." Sherlock inhaled a breath. "Secrets for secrets, though, like we agreed. Anderson was not only my last lover before you, but my first one as well. I lost my virginity to him, and within a month of us about to get engaged, I found out that he had been sleeping with eight people. All of them who I thought were my friends."
"I care about Sherlock a lot," Greg went on, "despite his string of anger-related problems his brother and I have to hush up and his constant need to steal parts off cadavers. But don't try to get out of the other part of this, John. What are you to, Sherlock? The closeness…that kiss…that isn't usually him at all. Hell, he and Anderson were living together and about to get engaged, and they barely held hands."
"Sherlock," John said, chewing on his bottom lip, momentarily forgetting that Sebastian was still in the room, breathing his air, "Did you hear what I said to you yesterday, in hospital? Before you fell asleep?"
Molly stays there, haemorrhaging all the water from her body, until she is tired and spent. Once her breathing has evened and her face is dry, she sits back up, resting her head against the wood behind her. Her muscles ache, and her eyes are red and puffy, sore from lack of moisture, despite the puddle in her scarf they had created. Slowly, she pulls off her rucksack, unzipping the front pocket and pulling out her phone. There’s someone she needs to call.
Tongue seemed to be the worst offender. And while John was still quite proud of his ability, he wanted Sherlock to remember this, wanted him here and present when he made him come in his brother’s interrogation room. So he avoided inserting his tongue into Sherlock’s mouth by holding Sherlock’s lip hostage. He didn’t bite down hard, but it was enough pressure that he knew Sherlock was there, and his.
“He asks enough questions to check off the appropriate boxes, yes. Otherwise, I am graciously left to my own devices.” She replied, shutting the door gently behind her and gesturing into the sitting room. As they entered, her eyes flicked to what was clearly a new mobile phone on the nearby coffee table. Sherlock could only imagine what secrets were inside of it this time.
The first contact is a blast of salty sweetness in all the sides of Sherlock’s mouth as John’s back bows and arse flexes as he seems to will himself not to thrust too deeply. Fingers grip and pull at Sherlock’s curls, and Sherlock moans at the sting of it.
“I...this isn’t about the case. It’s about...just fancied a pint and wanted to have a mate with me to chat. You sound really knackered though, so I’ll just —“
Instead of the dotery and balding man John is expecting, John is now staring at the identical regal face that a few hours ago was  snoring softly into velvety pillows, his bare arse shimmering with John’s handprint.
“Okay then. You and me, against the rest of the world. Starting over.” There’s a moment of comfortable silence, and John counts Sherlock’s breaths, watching the gentle rise and fall of his stomach. There’s a lot of work to do, many difficult conversations to have and boundaries to create, but they’re here. Finally, they are here, and that is enough.
“Yes,” John sighs, then groans as Sherlock hovers over his inner thigh. “But not until after two o’clock. Remember I told you that a new doctor came on staff to deal with the morning crowd on—“
The violin exuded expensive quality and posh aloofness, much like the man who once played it. The dark honey tone with rich auburn hues within the polished wood. The bow alongside it sturdy enough to survive midnight musings from elegant hands. Handspun lullabies to combat John's nightmares of war.
She sat at a desk most days now. The world of policing now regulated to tedious paperwork with the occasional burst of racing around. It was jarring at first like anything new, but eventually she got a rhythm down. Wednesdays were the only day of the week that drove her to the point of tedious insanity. Document Day, as most of the other officers, called it. The day when each of the previous week of reports needed to be reviewed and signed off by her personally. The apologetic faces of her former colleagues floated in to deposit stacks of various sizes on any empty spot on her desk they could find.
Sherlock sighed and pulled the menu out of John’s hands and placed it on the table, right as the server swooped in with fresh wine.
Pinching the bridge of his nose between his thumb and forefinger in a last ditch effort to ward off a rather nasty headache, John let out a heavy sigh before bundling up the mess of blood-stained clothing at his feet and dumping it into the hamper at the end of the hall. He would wash them later, once all of this had blown over and he was able to return to his normal life again.
He had, but not with Skin Tight and Horny. Sherlock cleared his throat before handing the drink to the young man. “You’ll need this more than me with those awful lines. If you’ll excuse me…”
John could almost hear the eye roll from Sherlock. If any of airport security got a good look at the inside of their refrigerator they wouldn’t be so quick to assume anything was off-limits to the storage of body parts.
“I was running along the dock, chasing after Briggs. He jumped onto a nearby boat and I followed. I was halfway across the deck when—”
“But John, you deserve better. I can’t be the person you need. And that’s fine. I’ve accepted that.”
“Oh, I understand completely. Sometimes we have cases that will last for days on end, without a break.” He pauses, realising his mistake too late. “Had. We had cases.”
They dumped their dirty plates in the sink and made their way over to the sofa. John flipped through a few stations before settling on a football match, then yawned. Sherlock sat next to him, already strategising the best way to initiate sex. In general, John never took much to persuade him, but after dinner, a heavy-handed clue was usually required. Sherlock deduced that the sluggishness came with the meal. After waiting until an ad break, Sherlock slid closer to John. He rested his head on John's left shoulder, and John gave a small sigh that usually affirmed that Sherlock could continue.
The DI gives another chuckle, and John realises that he’s not explaining himself well at all. How the hell could he have ever seen this complication happening in a breakup? Leave it to Sherlock to even make being friends this bloody involved.
There was a rotation of days that Sherlock kept special track of; when they went out on what John jokingly deemed proper dates. Most times Angelo’s was the restaurant of choice, but occasionally John suggested little eateries near the surgery or Sherlock would convince John to wear better trousers and head out to a more lavish supper full of rich meats and the finest of wines.
“The other night was a mistake,” John says, and Sherlock’s eyes narrow. He stands, taking a step towards John.
He scans around the room, trying to decide where the infernal noise is coming from. He attempts to isolate the sounds from each other. The shouts are in his mind, but everything else is coming from someplace specific, and painfully close.
"Crazy attracts crazy," John said, neither confirming nor denying Greg's assumption. "I hear he might retire soon, though. Got himself a live-in client who has a taste for danger. So, I don't think you lot will have to worry about him for much longer."
“Thanks...hopefully it ends up being cause for celebration,” John replies, his cheeks feeling very pink once more. “Still haven’t figured out the perfect time to ask. Been carrying it around off and on for the better part of a month.”
“Which I’m not,” Irene interrupted, pointedly. Her face now with a much more discerning expression. “Odd how he thinks you’re so intelligent when the answer was right in front of your face. Shattered into quite a few pieces, as I have been told.”
"Greg, care to shove that second tablet I saw on the table down his throat like the angry kitten he is? Should we wrap it in some cheese for you, Sherlock? Hmm?" John glared down at his lover and sat on top of his thrashing thighs. He might be short, but he had a solid enough build, and his weight was sufficient to keep Sherlock from bucking him off. "Could you stop fighting me for just one minute, Sherlock? Please, Love? I brought you pancakes."
“I want you to stop treating me like I’m going to break! As if, because I love you, I’m not exactly the same person as before!” John bites his lip, and sees Sherlock almost step forward, but stop himself. He looks torn and seems to be trying to figure out what is the most logical thing to do next.
The first few items were exactly what John expected. His laptop nested inside a dark blue laptop sleeve, just where he had left it. A hastily folded suit that John wanted to explain he would iron out at the hotel. Then another suit, a bit better in fit but just as wrinkled. One brown dress shoe and then it’s mate.
Miss Sylvia was none other than Sylvia De Grace, a well-known actress who’d had a five year run as a lead actress for a french television drama. For the past several weeks, she'd been the unhappy recipient of Eugine Darby's obsessive behaviour. At first, he'd come across as a normal fan. He'd show up whenever she made a public appearance, shout his well wishes, and simply let her leave.  But his behaviour had quickly escalated to an obsession, where he believed himself to be in a relationship with Sylvia. Twice now, he’d found his way into her dressing room in an attempt to get close to her.
“Uh, we were just—” John looked over to Sherlock, who rolled his eyes and nodded. Why should he care if they ran off to have coffee? It wasn’t like John needed his permission. “—sure. Which station are you going to?”
When it’s over, John is about six inches long, with the weight very indicative of a common fruit bat. His fur is a lovely golden color and his nose is small and wet. The ears are oversized and the wings about twice the length of his body. However, it’s his eyes that cause Sherlock’s entire body and soul to lurch in a very un-Sherlock direction.
Abort conversation. Different topic, and fast. Before he has the chance to scramble for something else to say, John continues, “Because I miss you...a lot, and it’s nice that you miss me too and—“
“You may find it more difficult to use your talents here,” Irene mentions, her smile widening as she walks over towards a very ornate wet bar. The click of ice hitting a glass sends another odd shiver through Sherlock, and he wraps his coat around himself a little tighter.
"Whatever you say, I'll give it to you. If I'm going too slow or fast, tell me, and I'll adjust accordingly. This is for you; every second of this is for you. I want to watch you melt into a puddle of your own desire, Sherlock."
"Tell me as much as you can about as much as you know about this Morstan woman, and also…what are you
Sherlock’s gaze flitted up to see the sour expression on DI Lestrade’s face. The man looked as if himself committing murder might be a reasonable idea in the right set of circumstances.
He heard John’s high pitched giggle again, the sound ruffling the hair within Sherlock’s pelvic region. He giggled back in return.
Sure enough, John peers over his newspaper to see that not only has Sherlock moved closer, but he is glancing over at him with an intense expression. Much as if John is a new piece of furniture that Sherlock is deciding whether he actually goes with the rest of the decor.
“I don’t want to die.” He spits the words out this time, poorly hiding his frustration. He wants to live, wants to step back into Baker Street, wants to see John at least one more time.
He glances back at John before looking into the mirror again, then bites his bottom lip before giving them a tentative flap.
Eventually, John found a small contusion in the upper area of Sherlock’s inner thigh. It was the all too familiar chemical burn of an inhibitor that had been in use for far too long. These types of situations happened more often with much younger omegas than Sherlock. Usually, it came down to ignorance of the need to regulate their heats or fear of additional medical insertion, but yet again this omega was different.
Perhaps this is the best way to move away from Sherlock. Not date, exactly, but move in a general direction of normalcy. Have fun; be in an existence where fingers and toes are not left in the refrigerator next to Indian takeaway. Something casual. John flashes her his coy half-smile, the one he’d practised in the mirror as a teenager. “And I’d love to go for a drink. There’s a bar down the street that does great cocktails, I can take you there?”
John placed his palm on the back of Sherlock’s neck. His body heat felt hot compared to the chill the table had left on his skin. He pulled Sherlock forward, nuzzling his lips and nose along the side of Sherlock’s face while breathing heavily directly into Sherlock’s ear.
And no one has fallen harder than John. But if he and Sherlock really tried, cut through the bullshit and started being honest with each other, perhaps they could fall together.
“Fancy a fry up?” John suggested. “I’m sure you’re just as famished as me after last night, and earlier this morning too. I should serve you breakfast in bed after what your mouth did to me…”
Days move way too quickly, John can’t stop now. Not when he had come so far and dismantled so much. Obsession might as well be etched in his browlines.
“I assure you that all the body parts are from volunteer cadavers. I have a friend at Barts morgue who facilitates them for experimentation.”
“Sherlock, what is this?” John’s tone is slightly apprehensive, with specklings of genuine curiosity. Sherlock can do a lot with both. Cultivate it into a thrill of adventure and the pursuit of danger.
“All these moments, they have one thing in common.” Irene gestures to the projector, still running through the faded memories. “You didn’t care. John Watson, well, he begged me for life. He had worse odds than you and yet he sat there, pleading with me to let him go back. There have been a couple of times when I thought I’d meet him again, but since he met you, the only time I see him now is when I’m watching you. But you, Sherlock — it’s almost as if you want me to take you.” Irene turns to face him, and Sherlock could swear that her face has become thinner, her already sharp cheekbones straining against paper-thin skin. Her eyes are dark and hungry, pupils blown wide in the dim light of the room.
John lets out a deep breath and closes his eyes. During his therapy sessions, Ella had suggested having a code, a word or phrase that means ‘Talk to me’. Something simple they can use when John is struggling to voice his emotions or Sherlock needs more information about what’s going on in John’s head. It had been strange at; first, the phrase feeling jarring each time they uttered it, but now it had become second nature. It was far less confrontational than their previous technique, when John would continue to bottle up his emotions until they were fit to burst, and Sherlock didn’t know how to ask for the information he needed.
The noise is at an acceptable level for Sherlock’s ears and for that, he is thankful. He wants to make sure he can talk to John about a few things connected with the wedding, and shouting has never been a fun activity if he can avoid it.
was dimly lit but very busy considering it was nearly ten pm, with a tough crowd of people. Mostly bikers with the occasional seedier bloke, but nothing that Lestrade couldn’t handle. Plus, the pints were good and cheap. Once they were by themselves at the table, Greg leaned over to John.
"Good. I was hoping you would see reason. I didn’t enjoy the prospect of getting blood on this tux. Plus, I look rather dashing in it,” John said and smiled a smile that was too full of teeth to be genuine. He didn't lower the gun but nor did he make a move to pull the trigger. "If I ever hear that you have contacted her, hired someone to contact her or even bumped into her while going out for a coffee- You had better watch your back. Because I have a bullet with your name on it."
“Have you got a new cologne?” They spoke at the same time, their words tripping over each other. “Sorry,” John apologised, but Sherlock waved him off, indicating that he should continue.
“Leah,” He says, and she greets him with a quick kiss on the cheek before reaching into her scrub pockets and pulling out a pack of cigarettes and a lighter. They are standing at the back of St Barts, sheltered by a small glass canopy jutting out from the side of the building. It always amuses John when hospitals have smoking shelters. So you can smoke yourself to death whilst trying to heal.
, so it dictates that you went there with the DI like you initially chatted about, and you had a nice time. People don’t usually keep souvenirs connected with unpleasant memories.”
“Lestrade. Since you’re dating, and I’m assuming you’re exclusive, there must be times that he has to cancel a date or...just forgets to take you out. Is that accurate?”
"Don't give him any ideas. I'm still not completely convinced that there isn't a rogue bug in the flat that I missed, and he's listening to everything we're saying." He cupped his hands around his mouth and shouted towards the ceiling. "I'll haunt your kitchen and make sure you never eat another meal in peace again, you fat arse!"
“That's before I knew the exact angle to spread your legs apart to get to your prostate on the first go."
Greg huffs out a laugh. Sherlock paces roughly ten metres away, his coat billowing behind him as the murder victim lies flat on his back on the asphalt. The untamed curls bounce in time with the long strides as the detective moves back and forth as he collects pieces of information for later deductions. John can tell that he’s cursing due to the deeply low grumblings and thinks it best to keep his distance.
All at once, he’s hit with the full force of a realisation. He wants a second chance. A chance to admit how he feels, to live freely, without trying to convince himself he’s something he’s not. To be Sherlock Holmes, not the shadow of Mycroft.
“What’s this?” John asked, his brow furrowed as he picked up the small slips of coloured paper Sherlock had dropped onto his lap.
In hindsight, John wishes he had texted Sherlock that he was coming this evening. He had made a few attempts to send out a quick message, but how the hell do you begin to justify or apologise with just a few sentences? Instead, he scrolls back through the last of Sherlock’s messages. Each text's emotional weight swings wildly, and John feels his chest ache at his returned silence.
The following day is so bright and sunny that Molly can barely stand being indoors, even with what happened the day before. She paces in her kitchen with Amelia and Frieda close on her heels, the gentle sounds of their mews at odds with Molly’s stressed footfalls.
!” Sherlock tugs at his curls again with his free hand, and John desperately wants to yank his hand away.
“I get it now,” John continues. “The reason that you told the taxi driver to stop in Soho and then you left. I knew that you needed space and time alone, but why Soho of all places, I didn’t know. It never connected until now.”
As they break apart there’s a spattering of applause from behind them; the small group of people stood at the end of the road watching them in wonder. It hits John how un-self-conscious he feels, even knowing that they have witnessed such an intimate moment. He feels free, unlimited by the judgements of others, confident in himself and his partnership.
“You know exactly what I’m implying, Dr Watson.” Mycroft stands, adjusting his waistcoat to lie flat against his chest.  “What do you see when you look in the mirror?”
Sherlock shot another round, and the antique vase from his Auntie Helen would never be the same again. Greg pressed the speed dial number for John on his mobile and just hoped that this time John would answer. Did the fucking man have his phone on silent?
“Nope, we’re going all the way. If we stop here, we’ll never get upstairs.” John says, despite Sherlock’s grumbles. John wraps his arms around Sherlock’s waist, hauling him up the stairs. Sherlock leans into the touch, wishing he could stay like this forever. John’s casual touch; both their walls broken down, if only for the night.
“I’m working, John,” Sherlock repeats, barely breaking concentration. John takes a deep breath and counts to ten. Now is not the time. He’ll just use Sherlock’s.
“Have you even told your sister about us? Probably one of the only people who would understand the general hurdles that we are facing.”
She’s right, and John wants to spend the next few hours in continuous apologies because of the amount of Leah’s time he has wasted in such a lacklustre pursuit. As if she can read his thoughts, she places a hand on the small of his back and gives him a gentle rub.
This is what John never thought was possible, but it is. Here and now and wrapped up in a beautiful new shade of acceptance. They’re actually making it as a couple. They fell at the same time, and now together they fly.
was, of course, himself. But he wasn't about to put that out on the internet for everyone to see. No, if FuriousForensic did DM him, he'd simply give the man the number to his burner phone and let him make his assumptions.
“It’s a pile of crap, Sherlock, and you know it. I have less idea what’s going on here than you do. Why are you acting as if I’m made of paper?”
“Did you get dinner?” John asks, peeling off his jacket and draping it over the back of his chair. Sherlock barely looks up from where he’s typing away at the dining room table.
John glares as the taxi driver pulls up to The Honey Pot, but he gets out with me. I give a small smile to a few of the folks waiting in line, and they return subtle nods. I tug gently at John’s arm and he follows me, his tight black t-shirt clearly the source of quite a few whistles and smiles.
It was the broken foundations of their future that Mary wasn't able to continue to rebuild time after time. She craved the sounds of wedding bells and giggles of babies, not the silence that John wore like a testimonial. It was over.
Sherlock mentally runs down the various areas of his mind palace for such a term, but the only visuals that come to mind with the word Belstaff are coats. He has lots of them hanging in numerous places in the flat.
“John, I’m not an idiot. I know we weren’t working before. But, why can’t we just have this? The other night was the first time I’ve felt calm for weeks. The first time I felt like we weren’t circling each other, waiting for the other to attack.” Again, John's mind is reeling with how much sense Sherlock is making right now. Even in nothing but a bedsheet. “You say you need boundaries, yet you don’t actually know what you want. I’m tired of trying to figure out how to act around you, so I don’t care anymore. You either want to be here, or you don’t, come back to me when you’ve figured it out. I’m going to bed.” And with that, Sherlock sweeps out and into his room, letting the door shut loudly behind him.
I’m sitting on the sofa, slowly emerging from my mind palace, when hurried, heavy footsteps rush up the stairs. A door slams above me; John’s bedroom sealing closed for the night.
“Because you are more fascinating than anything else I have come across in the world, John….you're meant to be painted. Your face is a tapestry of what bravery and kindness is when those two forces come together. Your eyes are what stars look like in the still of nightfall. Your hands...are as skillful with a scalpel as with a pistol. Your smiles are thousands of whispers that each tell a story. Oh, John…how could you believe that
“I heard your phone alerts last night,” Harry says quietly, her smile weakening a fraction. “I assume it was Sherlock?”
“No, no...I didn’t say that I wouldn’t. It’s just…” John retorts, his hands waving a little too wildly for Sherlock to not laugh at again. “...I’m grabbing another drink beforehand to...erm...get my throat ready.”
As time passed and John became more settled in 221B, his scent began to change. Slowly at first, almost imperceptibly, before it appeared to change all at once. The cheap shampoo was replaced by another, slightly more expensive product, which smelt of sea salt and cedarwood. The damp completely disappeared, and instead, John’s clothes smelt like honeysuckle from the washing powder they used.
this,” John parrots, the white heat of his words burning his mouth and tongue as he says them. “Like I’m something to be endured...like a chore? Is that it?”
To give himself something to do, he stood up and walked over to the foot of the bed to where John’s charts were located. The paperwork was settled onto a small clipboard, incredibly old fashioned, but still useful for the staff to look over John’s most recent care. With another twist of his gut, Sherlock read what was clearly John’s handwriting:
Eventually, he felt his heart slowing down and the omega scent lingering all around him was pushed into the background of his senses. He didn’t have a clue how long that would last before his more primal urge to dominate and fill and fuck would unravel any higher brain function that he had left. He would be damned if he would lower himself to behaviour like those filthy animals in the street.
“Oh Christ, I’m so bloody full,” he complained to the two overstuffed pillows at the head of his bed. “Drank too much, ate too much, danced too much.”
“Dead, last I heard from every credible source out there. For quite a while too. A shame for such devastating cheekbones.”
Oh, a whim, John opened a new tab and typed 'Scott Bushe' into the search bar. The first thing that popped up was a link to his Facebook profile, which had been turned into a sort of memorial by his family. He scrolled through the comments. Reading people's heartfelt condolences. One man, a Greg Lestrade, commented about how Scott had been one of the finest forensics scientists the met had ever known. There was a scathing reply from one Sherlock Holmes regarding the inaccuracy of that claim.
John moaned, loud, wanting, unashamed of the prize on his lap. Sherlock was gorgeous, smart, cunning, and there was warmth and humanity under the cloak of impassiveness he wore.
"We're both insane. You realise this, right?" John dropped his head and shook it as their mixed laughter rippled across the room. "I thought you'd be pissed about the window, but considering what you did to the rest of the flat…" he trailed off and stood up from the chair, dropping his expensive trousers to the floor as he did.
Before Sherlock could second-guess himself, he dropped his coat to the floor and strode forward, closing the gap between them. Shock gathered in John’s eyes, just for a moment, before Sherlock surged forward, and captured John’s mouth in his. John hesitated for a millisecond, before he moved towards Sherlock in the semi-darkness, fitting their bodies together like puzzle pieces.
Anderson didn't need to be told that John was not here on a social call. The stiffness and resolve of a soldier's quiet demand for information were in every slight muscle twitch of the man seated opposite to him. The small scarlet book pulled from the coat's inner pocket and placed onto the table.
“I’m going to have to check your pelvic area next...to make sure that there isn’t any deeper damage.”
Sherlock leaned over from the couch to see the various designer bags filled to the brim with clothing before slowly standing up and carefully walking over to inspect all the purchases.
Food porn…of sorts? Once John calms down, anyway. Thank you all again for reading my silly little Vamplock fic. I’m awful at responding to comments in a timely fashion but I’m trying to get better at it! Thank you to SherlockWatson_Holmes for their lovely encouragement and my bevy of writing wives who scream at me daily for me to keep writing.
Sherlock steps back, using his body weight to close the door behind him. The latch clicks softly into place, and he leans his head back, closing his eyes and gently counting to ten. He needs to stay calm, so he can figure out what the hell is going on. Best to start off with a simple question first.
Sherlock glances back down at the case files, and John stands there in the now deafening silence. He wasn’t expecting this to be easy at all, but a little bit of communication would do wonders right now. He clears his throat pointedly, but Sherlock continues to shuffle paperwork as if it is the most important thing in the universe. John can tell he’s not even reading it; he memorised the information days ago, he’s just looking for an excuse not to face the situation head-on.
John was so stupid. Sherlock was the kid that pulled things apart just to figure out how they went together again. He’d never been a natural with social skills, that much he admitted, and he worked by analysing behaviour patterns and matching them with meanings. Of course, when faced with someone like John, someone that he cared about, he’d want to discover everything about them.
“...you’d what?” John asks, his hands now on his hips and glaring again. “Is this your way of telling me that you don’t want me here? You want me to move out?”
"Christ-" John sobbed, his lips pressed against Sherlock's collarbone in a half kiss. "Jesus," after that, he was incapable of words, simply riding out the aftershocks of pleasure as they tipped into over-stimulated quakes. "Come for me, you fucking gorgeous thing. Please?" He whimpered, teeth scraping along Sherlock's shoulder.
The purple-haired girl smiles warmly at him when he places the items on the counter. She has a square name tag pinned to her chest:
The question slid uninvited into his mind. Had John made a simple, one-off mistake, or was he hiding their relationship? He knew that John struggled with his sexuality; constantly wrestled with the ingrained biphobia that came from unaccepting parents and a backwards society, but surely it didn’t extend this far? To shoving them both back into the closet as soon as a stranger approached?
“Hmm? Oh, fine I guess? Haven’t really had anything to do with it, really. You know how Mary can be. Already has everything arranged. I just need to show up with a suit and a smile and she’ll be thrilled.”
“This is just what I am now,” John replies, his voice soft and distant, as if on his deathbed. “A collection of twitches and gay wokeness overload.”
John’s thumb rubbed at Sherlock’s knuckles. John did that when about to reveal something hard for him to talk about. Rubbed at the spacebar on his laptop when he was writing a difficult case on his blog. Rubbed at his forehead when going through medical journals to stay up to date with locum work for the surgery.
If he lets his mind wander, he can almost imagine that Sherlock is on the other side, waiting for John to come in. Perhaps this was a mistake. They could get through this, if they tried. He could get used to Sherlock’s abrasive nature during cases, if that’s what it took to be in the detective’s embrace again.
“That was…” John glanced around quickly before bending over to make sure that only Sherlock could hear him. “That was different. Things have changed now...and you know that.”
John nods again, and his stomach tightens at the memory of the text messages. The way Sherlock had said
John raised his eyebrows the smallest of fractions before narrowing then back into the proper place. Mycroft dared not take a step into what was absolutely a sniper's shot.
John kept his hands to himself for the rest of the journey, and Sherlock pushed the question out of his mind, focussing instead on researching Talacre Park and the surrounding area. The overground ran along the back of the park, with only the Prince of Wales Medical Centre buffering the railway and the park itself. A main road ran along the east side of the park, but it was large enough that you couldn’t see the west side from the road. Plenty of residential buildings on all sides — someone must have seen something. It was hardly a secluded place to dump a body; either the killer wanted to be found, or the place had a particular significance.
Irene twists herself so that she is facing a large section of bare wall and points her mobile towards it as if it’s a television remote. Then comes the sound of her dialling a series of numbers into the keypad, whose tones are too familiar to ignore.
John smiled brightly as their glasses clinked together, and Sherlock watched as John’s cheeks went rather pink before giving another small adjustment to his tie. Sherlock’s smile mirrored John’s at how nervous John could be whenever they dined somewhere with even a slightly higher price range. Didn’t John realise that he was worth showing off in places like this?
John stayed the morning after sexual activities with Sherlock. No deduction able to be theorised due to potentiality for rejection. New data obtained, but further research and experimentation required for a more well-rounded conclusion.
The rest of the world melted away and left the two of them, suspended in time. He could almost read John’s thoughts like this, with his face soft and eyes wide open. There was admiration there, something that Sherlock wasn’t sure he’d ever get used to. Most people looked at him like a circus freak, something to be amazed by, but only out of morbid curiosity. But John — John looked at him as if he were the eighth wonder of the world, not only something to be appreciated, but something to be adored.
“This might sound weird, but you smell different. I’ve been trying to put my finger on it all day. Did you buy new cologne?”
Without his medical bag, he knew he was fighting a losing battle with the head wound, so he shifted his focus to the omega’s lower body. Aside from the obvious scrapes and bruises where the omega’s clothing had been torn, a fair amount of swelling was evident around the outer edge of his knee cap.
John wakes slowly the next morning, brought gently from his slumber by the rays of soft sunlight streaming through the window. Instinctively, he reaches out beside him, searching for Sherlock. The bed beside him is empty, and John’s eyes snap open with the realisation that he is alone. A quick feel of the mattress shows that Sherlock’s been gone for a while — the sheet is cold beneath his hand, and when he finally makes his way out of the bedroom, the heavy Belstaff is gone from the rack by the door.
, almost startled and Sherlock lifts his head up to look into John’s face. His frown is an odd contrast to his widened eyes and sex sweaty hair.
“Your deductions are, without a doubt, what turns me one more than anything else,” John continued, and Sherlock appreciated that John kept his voice low so that only he could make out the words clearly. “The first time...after we met...after that
“No, but...it’s not like you to leave things like this unfinished, Johnny. I mean, even if Sherlock’s the first man you’ve dated, it doesn’t change your empathy or your morals. If he’s trying to reach out then you should at least let him tell you what he wants to tell you.”
John stumbles up the stairs, trying and failing to stay quiet, as not to disturb Mrs Hudson downstairs. The floor swims before him as he makes his way across the living room, unceremoniously dumping his jacket on the sofa. His shirt goes with it, crumpled to the floor without care. It isn’t until his hand is on the doorknob that he realises his mistake.
They rack up a list of rules, including, but not limited to — no painting whilst eating, no painting on ‘bad days’ (to be determined by John, and John alone), and one which John can’t believe he had to enforce; no painting in the bathroom. The canvases begin to pile up — at least half of the sitting room is covered in painting’s of John, with a few of Mrs Hudson and Billy mixed in. As hyperfixations go, this is one of Sherlock’s more tolerable ones, but it certainly takes up the most space. John tries not to complain.
“You were at most slightly tipsy,” Sherlock corrects, and he ensures that his grip around John’s waist is tight just in case he decides to make a break for the front door of the shop. John may have shorter legs, but he’s quick when he has a motive to be. “And you’re worrying too much about it, John.”
“Mums the word.” He taps his nose and leans back against the wall, the coldness of the bricks seeping through his jacket. They stay in silence for a few minutes, small clouds of smoke billowing in front of them. The scent of tobacco feels familiar, but he shoves that thought down quickly before he has a chance to dwell on it. Not here. Not now.
A giggle leaves John and Sherlock moans at the way the laugh rumbles through John’s chest and hips. The gentle tightening of their bodies just this side of domestic, and Sherlock is equally enraptured and terrified.
Thankfully, none of them are as brave as John Watson, who is settling in on Sherlock’s right side. A warm and sure hand rubs the middle of Sherlock’s back, careful to avoid the wings as much as possible.
Harry lives alone so John can shout at her without disrupting the peace of a partner. He plans on doing a fair bit of shouting because he decided on the very long and expensive trip back to his sister’s part of town that last night is just as much her fault as his.
Sherlock pauses, his eyes scanning John’s face. John wishes he had a manual for that incredible brain of his. That he could translate every firing neuron; understand exactly what Sherlock needs right now. Eventually, Sherlock blinks, a little more than necessary, and answers: “No.”
“Whatever you and Sherlock had was special,” she continues. “And regardless of what comes next, you should close that door before you open a new one. I’m sad that the new door doesn’t have me on the other side, but I’m happy to stay friends, ok?”
With a quick nod of his head, John clambers onto his chair, feet planted carefully on the seat. The chair wobbles slightly but doesn't fall, and it isn't long before John begins singing in a slightly out of tune, but not unpleasant voice.
Before he can change his mind, he unlocks his phone and dials Lestrade’s number. John doesn’t want to tell him, not yet, but he also doesn’t want to be alone. He’s not sure how strong his resolve is; if he went back to the flat after a couple of drinks, he might well fall back into Sherlock’s bed.
“Oh dear,” Molly moans, already jumping out of her seat on the sofa to survey the damage in the hallway. Her cheeks and chest are warm, and she knows how flushed she must be. Irene covers her mouth to muffle a chuckle.
Sally’s hardened face went soft at John’s words. “I hated him, yes. For a very long time, but after he reached out to me a year ago...after the shock of him appearing at my doorstep and pleading to talk...it changed things.”
It’s raining off and on as they wind through London’s busy streets. The cab driver’s music of choice is classical violin. John tries not to envision Sherlock’s lean silhouette, surrounded by moonlight, as each of the pieces play, but the images are already there and refuse to leave.
A small black bag was tossed onto the desk. Its shiny surface glimmered and Irene’s head turned towards it.
Anderson, of course, took stubbornness to levels meant for daytime soap operas. Phone calls, texts and desperately expensive gifts were an everyday occurrence until he finally moved into his own flat on Baker Street a few months later.
"Two sugars and a splash of milk," Sherlock called back. He flipped the book to page 214 and began to read.
They pull up outside the bar, and John pays the driver before following Leah inside. She picks a table in the corner, secluded from the rest of the room.
"Tell me everything you have so far," Sherlock demanded, his attention still laser focussed on the victim. Finally, there was something he could work with.
She stood up from her chair and walked to the door and opened it. John stood up as well. The intermittent tremor caught Sally’s eye as he headed towards the door, walked through it, and spun around to face Sally once more.
"This one," John said while pointing to a yellow and black crest low on his left side. It was a man riding a horse while holding a spear to a dragon underfoot, "is the Northumberland Fusiliers' crest. I spent most of my time in that regiment; a few mates and I went out and got this done."
He navigates the mess enough to pull two mugs out of the cupboard, and rescues some teabags from the drawer. There are even small tubes of acrylic mixed in with the cutlery. John doesn’t ask.
Sherlock wishes that the wine in the bottom kitchen cabinet was somehow still corked and undrunken. He could use two or three more glasses. John hums in thought.
Maybe it was a threesome?  Perhaps John just got a bit carried away with the fun. Bisexuality now disengaged and in its place, John squeezes a beautiful woman in the middle of the sausage fest. Maybe she had to leave the fun early and left John and the mystery man with the gorgeous backside to sleep off all the alcohol.
If John was here right now, he would be grumbling about them needing better footwear. Sherlock, in his usual dress shoes, slides around a corner, hot on the trail of their latest criminal. Racing around the streets of London dictates proper footwear, but John fails to realise that fashion can never be out of any equation.
Sherlock shows all the warning signs of a patient about to throw up right where they stand. His face is slightly green, and he is swaying slightly from side to side. John watches Sherlock grip onto the side of his office desk to steady himself.
Yet, here he is, still recalling so many wondrous memories of laughter and levity. His fingers twitch at the recollection of how bloody soft Sherlock’s curls feel, no matter what time of the day that John runs his hand through them. How irresistible John’s name sounds in Sherlock’s deep baritone, and how John yearns to not know what each day will bring because he’s hitched his heart onto the whims of a madman.
Before now, he hadn’t fully appreciated how much his life had changed. No Sherlock meant no cases. And sure, that meant he’d finally get some sleep, and perhaps he could hold a full-time job, but no cases meant no running across London in the dead of night, no all-nighters at the yard.
fluttered in the breeze that the DI made as he moved closer to the bed. John’s chest rose and fell in a steady rhythm. His soft snores a stark contrast to the way his limbs twitched as he clung around the long and iconic coat of a dead man.
Sherlock slinked his hands down onto John’s trembling shoulders. “Mine is closer. If you prefer it.”
“Please John…” Sherlock begs, his voice teeters on the edge of a sob. His legs squeeze around John’s waist and John is holding back saying it again. That he loves this man with more heart that should be physically possible. “Take me…”
A singular key was in the left pocket of his trousers, exactly the same make as the other victims. Sherlock leaned down to check the watch on the man's left wrist. Rolex, about five years old. It was still ticking; although the time was off by an hour, therefore the murder must have taken place at least a month ago, before daylight savings time started. A wide smirk split through Sherlock’s face. So far, everything was pointing to this being an earlier victim, which meant the killer would have been sloppier.
That was enough to stop Seb dead in his tracks. Sherlock might as well have slapped him in the face with a fresh piece of roadkill.
“Oh no, you are taking me to dinner. I plan to be truly wined and dined before I show you what that mouth is good for.” With that, John opened the door and slid out, leaving Sherlock to pay. He hovered for a moment, baffled by John’s last statement. One minute John didn’t want anyone to know about their sex life, then he made cavalier innuendos within earshot of their driver. Had Sherlock missed something? Over the years, he had become better accustomed at learning social conventions, but was this another custom he had yet to learn?
“Just about ready?” Sherlock asks as he walks over to the counter. The large rainbow flag he’s decided on is nearly as big as John himself.
Instead of running the shears through John's shirt as Sherlock did with his own, this time, he took small snips southward until John's chest was exposed, the material of the dress shirt ruined beyond repair. The speckling of ash blonde chest hair and darkened nipples were there to behold, and Sherlock did just that. He took time lavishing attention on each of the nipples with sweet little bites before wrapping his hand around the back of John's head and kissing him with the force of a gunshot.
John lifts up onto his toes and presses a kiss onto Sherlock’s mouth, and Sherlock’s eyes slide shut. The warmth of John’s breath and tongue is deep and rich. The gentle bump of their noses as they automatically readjust so that Sherlock's whimper of want vibrates all the way down John’s throat.
"Julia knew as well as anyone else that I didn't do relationships. She said that was fine. She just wanted a good time." John had both his hands wrapped around Sebastian's wrist, which was probably the only thing keeping the blade from cutting deeper into his throat. "So I gave her a good time, and when she caught feelings, set her straight."
It was a perfectly replicated portion of a male pelvic region. The type that was made to fuck with the expert precision and the pride of being a very expensive and detailed sexual aid. The curves of the hips fit perfectly in Harold’s large gloved hands. He held it up for the other three adults in the room to feast their eyes upon.
"How is everything about you so warm?" Sherlock whispered, his voice breaking around the edges. "Radiant…like a beacon of light."
The relief in Greg’s voice is going to be shattered, and for once, it isn’t Sherlock doing it. How very strange indeed.
She gave a weak smile, and Sherlock tried to return it as best he could. He hadn’t meant to upset her. He was genuinely glad; Lestrade and Molly seemed to work together. They’d been dancing around each other for months, neither wanting to make the first move. It had been infuriating to watch — Sherlock wished he could have spelt it out for the both of them, but John informed him that that would have been ‘a bit not good’.
“Back when I told you that I realised I was bisexual,” he says, and his hands wrap around my wrists and give them a gentle squeeze. “I didn’t tell you everything because...I already was a balling mess about it and you already spent most of the night being the friend that I needed.”
"Going to tattoo my name on your arse, so everyone knows who you belong to," John growled as he jumped from table to bed.
But Lestrade was implying something more. Was there some unspoken rule of relationships that Sherlock didn’t understand? In his experience, regular coitus defined relationships. How else were they distinguished from average friendships?
Irene sighs gently and continues her energetic monologue, outlining the plans for tomorrow and instructing Molly what she should bring. As she speaks, Molly feels a stone grow heavier and heavier in her stomach. Although she knows these plans are for her, it feels too much like breaking Irene’s heart to cancel now.
John watched as understanding dawned on Greg's face. He nodded, informing the man that, yes, he'd drawn the correct conclusion.
John pressed the end button with as much force as he could, then chanced a glance at the Heathrow Airport security guard. The man --
A shudder crept up Sherlock's body from the tips of his curling toes inside of his shoes up to the electrical pulses coming off John's tightened fists in his curls. The heady sensation of want
Having Sherlock's eyes on him, watching him take pleasure in himself, was far sexier than it had any right to be. John had wanked while other people watched, and their presence had done little to sway his orgasm. Yet, those intense eyes and that gaze that saw all spread heat over John's body like wildfire. John could almost imagine that Sherlock's gaze had some sort of physical power, could imagine an invisible hand brushing over his skin.
“Sherlock, I don’t give a shit about being woken up to go with you for The Work or even you going off without me; I care that you didn’t leave so much as a note to tell me where you were! I was worried, you could have been dead in a ditch for all I knew.”
John ghosts his way through a couple of drinks, asking just enough questions to keep the conversation going, being evasive enough to avoid answering anything too personal, and laughing in all the right spaces. All the while, his thoughts are occupied by a certain consulting detective.
“This is nice,” John comments as they cross the floor to the bar. “I’ll go get a table, shall I?” He walks up a small set of stairs to the raised seating area in the back of the room. Sherlock watches him leave, intently trying to decipher John’s behaviour, before turning back to the bar in front of him.
Something quaked in the pit of Mycroft's stomach at the level of the incredulity of it all. The stance of the soldier in front of him with arms crossed and chin tilted up. Mycroft was heavily reminded of their first meeting years ago. Back then he had only slightly miscalculated the stubbornness of Dr. John Watson. That was not a mistake he would ever make again.
Of course, John would fuck in a postal code outside of his getaway budget; and with a bloke to boot.
Irene gives a warm and inviting chuckle, and Molly holds it close as if it’s the world’s best woollen blanket. She takes a seat on one of the barstools, absent-mindedly picking at the label on a round of goat's cheese, resting on the table. Irene starts peeling off the foil on top of the champagne bottle and twisting off the metal cork cover.
"The same can be said about me to you. I want you around me as much as possible," Sherlock replied. "Perhaps some light reading would be nice whilst you make the tea? I have a copy of War and Peace on the taller bookshelf."
“Yes.” John interrupts, “Yes you stupid git, of course I’ll marry you.” He rushes forwards, taking Sherlock’s face in his hands and crashing their lips together. The kiss is desperate and deep, both of them pouring their unspoken thoughts into the other. John winds his arms around Sherlock’s shoulders and feels his feet leave the ground as he is gently lifted into Sherlock’s sturdy embrace. Even now, Sherlock has to be a bloody show-off.
love with him…” Lestrade replies, his index finger tapping the table to emphasise the next part. “...as of now...
“I have a very specific set of skills for shoving large items into smaller areas,” she says with a wink. The innuendo floats in the air and lands gently all over the now full kitchen counter. “Now...where should we start? With a few bites of aged bleu cheese or with what that abominable person said to you yesterday?”
“Shit, sorry. Habit.” John had apologised profusely. Sherlock had waved him off, acting as if it were no big deal, but John had carried the weight of the encounter around with him for the rest of the day. Each time he blinked, he could feel Sherlock’s muscles tensing beneath his touch, and it filled him with a wave of nausea. There was a time when Sherlock would have lent into it, encouraging John to run his hands over his back, perhaps massaging the muscles and releasing the tension in Sherlock’s neck. Many a time that had led to something more; heated moments in the kitchen, neither quite making it to the bedroom. John had gotten used to being the giver of pleasure, to think that he was now a source of disgust was more than he could handle.
who had ruined their night, and not John. John had every right to be upset about the entire situation. Sherlock furrowed his brow and shook away the confusion. The spreadsheet would fix all of this in the end.
“You ready?” John chimes happily from the front door. His hand is on the doorknob as he waits for Sherlock to answer. His face is open, and there is a twinkle of excitement in his eyes that Sherlock wants to keep there for far too long to be appropriate.
“I…” John begins, his mouth so dry that he has to wet his lips. “I don’t know what to even…what am I supposed to deem from all of what you just said?”
John could see Greg about to ask what was in the bag, but the officer decided ignorance was bliss and simply nodded. When they got out to the car, John stuffed his coat and his two guns into the bag, then tossed it into the boot. He'd have to rely on his fists tonight or Mycroft's man if Mary decided to break her pattern. Greg gave him a lift to the hospital, and John found himself mildly surprised when he readily agreed to have a non-work related pint with Greg when this was all over.
The woman sighed and gestured for John to turn around and face Harold again. His duffel bag sat innocently on a long wooden table and Harold began to pull on latex gloves. Never a good sign.
“Since not long after the car accident.” John sucks in a breath. That was months ago. “The day that you left, I went...to put it mildly, somewhat mental. I was certain that it was shock at first. Felt like all the classic markers of it, anyway. I needed to talk to you. Convince you that what you thought about the spreadsheet was wrong but, upon reflection and playing back the incident through my mind palace, I could have easily come to the same theory. John...you were
He pulled both his jumper and undershirt off in one solid motion. Then the sound of metal softly clinking filled the room as he ripped off his belt and, shortly after that, his trousers and pants. He left the freshly knitted socks on, only because it made Sherlock smirk. Then, with desire burning a hole through his stomach, he reached for Sherlock's clothes. He did all the work, only needing Sherlock to lift his hips off the sofa long enough for him to yank his trousers and pants down to his knees.
His mind keeps wandering to Baker street, wondering what Sherlock is up to without him. Has he solved the case yet? Perhaps without John’s distraction, the detective could have solved the case and moved onto the next one by now. He hopes Lestrade will update him when they finally catch the guy, but John realises that the DI would have no reason to. John’s not on the case anymore, he’s not even a detective, so he has no rights over information pertaining to an open case.
Another call — John was being persistent today. Sherlock declined it without hesitation before holding the home button and powering down his phone. No more distractions. He could do this. Just one hit, solve the case, then he’d walk away. No falling down the pit, no chasing highs until he couldn’t breathe, just one, solitary fix. For the case.
“What are you doing?” Sherlock called after him, even though it was obvious what was happening. He’d failed. Again.
With that, his hand was around the base of Sherlock's cock, and his lips were ghosting kisses down his shaft from crown to tip. Sherlock was one to manscape, apparently, and the stubble scratched at his cheek and his upper lip. John just nuzzled closer, willingly accepting the fact that he'd have razor burn for an hour or two after he was done. It would be well worth it to see Sherlock once again crumbling under the force of his orgasm.
Yet, when he steps out the hallway, instead of the dozens of doors that lined each side, there are now only four. The lobby is gone and in its place is a large portrait of the front clerk, smiling down at him.
Mycroft sniffs as if the thought displeases him. “My brother likes to pretend he is a robot. Or a sociopath, to put it in his terms. He is, in fact, neither. I am afraid that your self-loathing will hurt him more than you think.”
Each book he read filled him with deep-seated confusion; the more he learnt, the more connected he felt — but at the same time, the more alone he became. He was living in a world that didn’t want him to exist. Still, there was some joy to be found, and the older he got, the more comfortable he felt.
No. John did not care to explain, thank you very much. John instead wanted to erupt into flames on the spot, until there was nothing left but ashes and perhaps a toenail or two. The press would be too enthralled by the tale of the London doctor who’d spontaneously combusted to notice that he unknowingly smuggled his boyfriend’s silicone reproduced privates out of the country.
Sherlock sighed long and low, brain feeling slightly fuzzy and slightly confused as to where the time had suddenly gone. John was staring up at him as if waiting for him to answer a previous question.
Ever since he returned, Sherlock has been finding it more and more difficult to read John. Whereas before, he’d been fairly accurate at predicting John’s reactions, now, he has no idea. He isn’t sure if this is because they’ve spent so much time apart, growing into different people, or whether the arrival of another person into their lives has upset their dynamic. There is still so much Sherlock doesn’t know, and the novelty of not knowing something so important feels wrong in ways that Sherlock wants to point an unlicensed weapon at and shoot at over and over again.
“A script for a stag night? Only you would come up with such a thing.” John gives a chuckle and grabs his jacket from a nearby chair, pulling it on in one swift move. Sherlock expects more questions, but John changes the subject to something more mundane. He isn’t sure how to take the change in direction — has John finally begun to trust him enough not to push further, or does John have no interest in what’s been planned for tonight?
The rest of the day is draining, filled with crying toddlers and overprotective mothers. He suspects his last case, an older gentleman suffering from acute migraines, is worse than he’d initially thought. He decides to fill out the referral paperwork for the neurology department when he gets home. He’s starving, but the forms need completing as soon as possible. The NHS is slow enough as it is without him adding to the delay. Still, he needs to eat something soon, or he’s going to crash. As he’s about to step out of the surgery, he texts Sherlock, asking him to sort dinner out.
from Ellie a couple of hours ago burns white-hot like a brand. Thankfully, it appears that the parade is winding down. John just needs to figure out the best location to get down on one knee. Somewhere a bit out of the way and quieter.
to Sherlock? Don't think I missed that kiss, granted not like you were trying to hide it. I'm sure you've figured out by now that I've run your name through every database known to the force, and other than your military service, you've got nothing. Might as well be a ghost, and it's clear that Sherlock trusts you, but I need to know your angle."
“Wait, we need ground rules —” Sherlock gives an annoyed groan and lifts himself off, his eyes flickering back and forth over John’s face. “No staying the night. That was a mistake last time, it can’t happen again. We’re not together anymore, we can’t fall back into that routine.”
at once. The exhale of relief on the other end of the line helped carry her through the rest of an incredibly depressing morning. Even for the likes of a morgue.
To make up for the cab ride, Sherlock tried to make dinner a magical affair. He googled first dates — reading article after article on how to create an exceptional experience. Most of it was aimed at heterosexual couples, which was less than helpful, but there were small nuggets of useful information. The bits about eye contact and laughing at the other person’s jokes came across as somewhat insipid, but Sherlock still placed the information in sections of his mind palace for easy access later on.
“And don’t come back until you’ve both stopped acting like children. You’re professionals, the pair of you.” He yells into the car before slamming the door.
With yet another shake of his head, John turned to his medical bag, fumbling through it for a moment before producing a small tube of burn cream and a bandage roll, along with a small antiseptic wipe. He tore open the packaging and swiped the area clean with the antiseptic before applying a generous amount of cream over the burn. It was strange to be doing this in the comfort of his own home, but he couldn’t shake the feeling that what he was doing was also highly illegal.
Boyfriend? Girlfriend? Spouse, or friend? Sherlock ran through the possibilities. There was no wedding ring, nor the familiar indentation that one would leave on her finger, so spouse was unlikely. The hand patterns on her neck were statistically too large for a woman, so more likely to be a boyfriend or male friend. He had been wrong before, but it was more time-efficient to follow that line of reasoning.
John is left in shock, standing staring at Sherlock’s empty seat. He was constantly analysing Sherlock’s actions, he’d forgotten to take a look at himself.
"Christ, I love how responsive you are," John had intended for the words to come out strong and sensual, a deep guttural moan that would leave Sherlock writhing. Instead, his voice cracked, and the words came out at a bare whisper. What was it about this man that made him lose all control?
“I’m not interested in what you’re selling,” Sherlock says as he turns on his heel and reaches for the door. “Dream or hallucination or whatever this is, I have a case to finish...now if you’ll excuse me.”
John needed a moment to collect his thoughts, so he bided time by downing half his beer. He'd consumed more alcohol that day than anything else and would certainly have a headache to show for it later, but he needed the liquid courage. Being court martialed was the least of his worries if people found out he was talking this much. First with Sherlock, now Greg? He'd be in for real trouble if word got out.
John gives Sherlock the same confused look as he approaches the table, accompanied by a deep sigh. Were the cylinders not good? Sherlock thought he was being clever, ensuring their alcohol consumption was enough to have a good time, but not so much that they couldn’t remember anything by the end of the night. Besides, Sherlock doesn’t trust himself to be drunk. Especially not around John.
An index finger pushed at John's hole and gently slid in. Sherlock watched as John easily took it and took his middle finger in right after. All the while, Sherlock opened John's thighs even wider, lifting one leg onto his own shoulder and kissing John's thigh and bare ankle. By the time his third finger was pistoning in and out, Sherlock was almost on the verge of screams. John looked delicious spread out underneath him, chest heaving and cock achingly erect.
He hung up the phone for a second time and confirmed that the officer had overheard. John could tell as that same smirk on the man's narrowed lips widened. Granted, perhaps the whole
John’s eyes crinkle in a smile and he kisses the tip of Sherlock’s nose. The intimate sweetness of it throws Sherlock’s mind palace into a state of unexpected disrepair. The thoughts are a jumbled mess that will take him hours to sort out as John pulls him onto his feet and back onto the bed.
There was an itch of impatience at the tip of John’s tongue. He licked his lips to stop himself from saying something that would dismantle this beyond recognition.
The cab ride is silent, both men staring angrily out of the window. John wants to start again, demand that Sherlock open up for once and tell him what he's actually feeling, but he’s painfully aware that the cabbie will be able to hear everything they say. Though, he’s not sure it matters, since half of Scotland Yard knows their business by now. Still, he doesn’t want to walk home.
John was aware on some level that Sherlock was egging him on. He was also aware of just how bloody effective it was. It took every ounce of willpower to keep his eyes open and focused on Sherlock. Had this been any of his past partners, John would have just closed his eyes and fucked himself into oblivion. But this truly was for Sherlock's benefit, and if he happened to get off on it, then all the better.
“Fine, but that means you can’t tell Harry either.” Sherlock challenges, raising an eyebrow. John feels something pull at his chest, and his stomach flips a little. Sherlock knows damn well that he’d never told Harry in the first place.
“So you’d prefer us to stay secretive?” There’s no malice in Sherlock’s voice, more genuine curiosity. It wouldn’t be the first time he’s had to keep a relationship to himself.
John followed Sherlock into the realm of oblivious bliss. He kept his eyes on Sherlock for as long as he could. But when the pleasure demanded he close them, he obeyed. Keeping an image of Sherlock imprinted to the inside of his eyelid, he rode the final waves of pleasure and collapsed, spent, against the sofa. When he finally opened his eyes a few minutes later, he shook his head at the state of them both and laughed.
He doesn’t have long to ponder before John remerges, clutching two plastic pint glasses of water. He wordlessly hands one to Sherlock, gulping back half of his own in the process.
Sherlock peered at his laptop for a fleeting moment before closing it down and texting back a response.
Sherlock doesn’t move at all and John stares at him in return. Sherlock keeps blinking rapidly as if trying to restart his brain and what can John even do to help him?
“Where to next?” John asks, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand. A few small droplets stay clinging to his upper lip, and Sherlock tries not to stare at them, wondering how it would feel to gently kiss them away.
The man grunts, and rolls over. His bare chest and stomach are shimmering with what looks like edible glitter. There are sprinklings of dark brown hair traveling its way from the man’s torso all the way to a slightly thicker section of curls that peek over the bed covers. In spite of himself, John’s eyes roam higher to the rosebud nipples and elongated neck with the moles deliberately placed in just the right spots. However, it’s the regal nose and elegant cheekbones that have John’s short-term memory colliding back with the force of yet another bullet through his left shoulder blade.
. He had three minutes until it was time to move. His current job wasn’t a person or even an animal. Nor was it exactly
John swallows hard as his eyes look up into Sherlock’s face. His heart flutters at how much he has missed that astounding face.
“They’re probably in the same place you left your dignity,” I grunt back, because I can see all the hickeys on Kraig with a K’s neck and it’s making me want to scream into a pillow. “Best to forget your trousers along with John’s number and be on your way, hmm?”
John tilts his head up to watch Sherlock’s body. His artistic hands know just where to touch him to make his skin tingle. John had gone to bed naked more out of exhaustion than comfort, but it makes this morning even more sultry. His nudity is a heavenly contrast to Sherlock in his dressing gown and nightclothes. The smooth sensation of silk brushes his sensitive arousal as Sherlock wraps his hand around John’s erection and takes over the speed.
John shrugs before nuzzling closer to me. “I’m sure they will manage with one less cock in the ring. I have all I want right here.”
It also hits John as to how much taller Sherlock appeared in the news article. Evidently, a long coat has more than atmospheric advantages. It elongates the man’s silhouette and creates a barrier of protection around him. Against what, John isn’t sure he wants to find out. Or maybe he does? It appears that John can’t decide whether he wants to strike those full lips with his fists or his mouth.
"I don't like it, but if Sherlock told you that's what he thinks this is all about, then it's our best bet. He's so rarely wrong about these kinds of things. I'll reach out to The Strand and get them on board. It shouldn't take more than a couple of days. In the meantime, you get Sherlock back to Baker Street and keep him out of as much trouble as you can. Be prepared for him to try to sneak off back to the lab, even with all of your fun times with each other. He's a workaholic through and through. Also, make sure that you find that gun of his before he shoots more holes in walls. Mrs Hudson is still steamed about the last lash out he had because he was
“Missed you,” John slurred so sleepily that Sherlock barely understood the confession. “Flat feels so empty when...not here.”
Irene smirks, then shakes her head. “No...anytime. Just thought you might need a further incentive. Seems like what you want to say is really special, and I am very curious to hear it.”
“I’m sorry, you’ll do what?” Sherlock’s brow crumples, lips twitching in clear confusion.  “Since when have you ever taken on board what I suggest?”
“No,” John replies, and the weight of his decision feels tremendously heavy. “Didn’t want to say something I’ll regret later...or allow him to pull me back into...whatever the hell we were doing.”
Dead end after dead end. Each passing minute made the trail grow colder. The Yard was useless at getting more information out of Pierce, and John’s texts became  pushier and more argumentative throughout the next hour. Just to avoid having to deal with any more awkwardness, Sherlock changed his mind about heading to Baker Street. Instead, he found himself on a very familiar cab ride to the darker side of the city. He needed to clear his mind, and cocaine always found the best way to do just that. Even merely having some in his possession might do the trick, and there were hiding spots at 221B John hadn’t discovered yet. Even with the help of Mrs Hudson.
