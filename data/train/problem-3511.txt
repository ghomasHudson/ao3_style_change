Castiel took a deep breath and sat back on his couch. He pointedly ignored the pill bottle and the envelope on the table and instead looked around inside their flat.
"Cas, this is-" he leaned forward to look even closer at the fine details. "This is amazing. What gave you the idea?"
"Yeah, we can um... we can do that but uh, no rush right? It's just that I've never- and I don't want to-"
The past three weeks had been bliss. Full of cheesy dates and late night Netflix binges and of course, mind blowing sex. Castiel never thought he could feel this happy with someone. Feel this free to be himself.
"No." Dean said halfheartedly, not even really listening. But if whatever he said meant he had to stop, that was a no.
"Jerk." Sam stood up and held out his hand to help Dean stand with a smile. "I believe our lord and lady await."
"I have several tattoos. If you'd like to see them all you could." Dean nodded distractedly as Castiel leaned in to kiss him. Their tongues clashed together and Dean tasted like whiskey and leather mixed with the Sativa they had just smoked. They kissed slowly and deeply for a while as Cas worked to strip Dean of his clothes as well.
"I'm not mad," he huffed. "If you don't want me to go hunting with you just say so. But don't invalidate me and make it seem like I'm helpless as an excuse."
"You're up early." A voice said in the kitchen. Dean quickly set the milk down on the counter but he slipped off when he reached for his gun.
Donna was the first to wrap him in a hug which he happily returned. Donna was always a comforting presence. Almost like a mother. Well, a better one. He went over and cracked a beer with Garth and Garth talked all about Bess and the twins. He tried not to make the tenseness in his body visible when he said the name Cas. But he was just talking about his son, not his Cas.
He wheezed into the jacket, crying so hard he couldn't even breathe. His stomach muscles clenched from the effort it took to cry this hard. He knew he wasn't crying pretty right now, his face was red and splotchy, he felt drool in the corners of his mouth and there was some on the jacket. After a couple minutes he caught his breath and was just crying softly. A few tears landed on the blood mark, making it wet again and smearing a small trail of the blood down the sleeve. This made Dean cry even harder, it felt like he ruined that imprint of Cas now. Before he could do anymore damage, he chucked it across the room. It took a few moments to register the clatter, and when it did, his brows furrowed in confusion.
"Look Farrah Faucet," Dean tried not to laugh at the demons nickname for Sam. "There's a pretty good chance that they don't even exist anymore. All the angels are dead. No angels, no halos. Unless someone has some magical collection out there. But you're pushing your luck."
Dean had a chubby mouthful of waffles and Castiel smiled to himself before clearing his throat. Dean swallowed his bite only to choke on air as soon as he looked up and saw him. Deans eyes were wide and wavering up and down his whole body as he stood by the stairwell. He didn't say anything for so long, Castiel started to blush under his gaze and asked finally:
"You are such an idiot." Dean chuckled. Still they hugged each other in an unspoken bond. That they loved each other no matter what.
That fluttering humor and happiness soon faded into something else though. He didn't know what to call it but it wasn't good. He was about to go on a date, with another man. He brushed those feelings aside though as he got to his feet and pulled on his leather coat.
Castiel had been pretty worked up already from watching Dean so it didn't take long to reduce him to a moaning mess. Dean was unsure in his movements but he tried to imitate what Cas does for him sometimes moving his tongue around and mostly toying with the head of Castiels cock. In a matter of minutes, Castiel pulled Dean off before he right came with Deans name a gasp on his lips like a prayer.
"That was fun. We should play again." Dean simply glared at him but there was to malice. It was just a game and they all knew that.
"The- the one we sang that morning." Dean hoped Cas would get it because he was too drained from everything. Luckily Castiel started singing it. His voice thick and deep like honey, so sweet he wanted to drown it in. The gravel scratch of his voice mixed with the rumble of his words made his chest vibrate as he sung to Dean. Dean closed his eyes allowing himself to be swept away by the sounds of his boyfriends voice.
"Dean, I think you seriously need to consider the possibility of being hate crimed. If you didn't walk out when you did, you do realize that that man could have beaten you up? It's happened to me before, Dean. Homophobes suck yeah, but fighting back doesn't always do good."
"You make a valid point," Dean laughed stepping closer to Castiel and his easel. "What are you-" Dean was about to ask what Castiel was painting when he actually caught a glimpse of it.
Castiels pupils were still blown wide looking at him in amazement. His hand moved from his shoulder to the side of his face and his thumb swiped across his bottom lip before it slightly dived into his mouth. Dean licked the pad of his thumb still tasting Castiel there. The other man moved his thumb out of his mouth and bent down to kiss him in a soft yet passionate gesture. Castiel walked over to a door on the other side of the room that lead to a bathroom. He came out a moment later with a warm washcloth and he gently cleaned Dean off giving him gentle kisses where the rag had been.
Donna smiled before making grabby hands to take the baby. Cas reluctantly let go of her for the first time in an hour, but smiled as everyone got a look at her.
"So, what did you want to talk about?" He asked. Dean gestured his forefinger in a movement meaning 'one second'. He got up and strode over to the fridge, pulling out some beers. He went over to sit in front of Sam once more handing him a beer. He popped the cap of his own and wasted no time in guzzling half of it. Sam raised his eyebrows in question and Dean started.
"No I mean it. You are. Feel free to paint me anytime." He smiled and kissed Cas on the cheek before he stepped into the kitchen. "Coffee?" He asked.
"Please, Cas... I need you. I-" Dean didn't get to finish the sentence before the chains clattered to the ground and he saw the man bundled on the trench coat on the ground.
"I love you, Dean." The angel gasped. Before Dean could even respond, he watched the fireworks of orgasm begin to flush the sculpted face of the angel above him, he lost all semblence of control. Cas moaned his name like a filthy prayer, hiding his face in the crook of Deans neck. Castiels hand and hips stuttered out of control and he felt a warmth splash across his stomach as the angel above him trembled and shook with the bliss of it all. Dean fell soon after that, the feeling of his body erupting felt like white hot tendrils of joy in every fiber of his being. He heard himself yell out Cas's name as the sound echoed off the motel room.
His mouth was like water after being dehydrated. It felt like fire in his bones and bile in his stomach. It was like tears in his eyes and like every part of him that once came from a dead star, was alive again. Time stopped, he let it sweep him away until Cas started to kiss him back. His lips conquered him and he gladly surrendered.  He dissolved into the angel until they became one. He could escape the world and hide in that moment with just the barest brush of their lips and the barely slick touch of their tongues. It was as if Castiels lips were shelter, as if they wanted to know all the places Dean had been hurt, so they could take it all away. And Dean let him.
He didn't know how long Cas stayed on that window ledge, but he woke some time later to Castiel snoring softly in the pillows with sunlight streaming in through the windows. He smiled to himself and pecked a kiss on Cas's forehead before nuzzling back into him and trying to fall back asleep.
"C'est juste en bas de la rue suivante." Castiel answered the man. He had no idea what he said but my god was that hot. Castiel spoke French so perfectly it just rolled off his tongue like honey.
As soon as Dean left Castiel cursed himself for being so fucking stupid. Gabe warned him that this wouldn't end well and if him fucking Dean didn't scare him away, this certainly did. His stomach suddenly felt nauseous at the idea of never seeing Dean again and he had to breathe.
"Happy birthday, honeybee." Cas said. Dean took the four candles out of Samantha's cake, letting her lick the frosting off. They couldn't believe she was already four years old and couldn't believe where all the time went. Dean laughed and put a dollop of frosting on her nose.
Dean is surprised but happy when he comes home to his apartment to find Cas on his laptop sitting on the sofa.
When Dean woke up hours later it was dark out and he almost felt guilty that he had slept most of the day. He quietly padded out of Cas's room to find him perched on the balcony, painting away with a glass of wine in his hand.
They decided to go to a small but nice, new age restaurant just outside of Lebanon. Dean held the door and pulled out the chair for Cas, trying to be a gentleman because despite Sam and Eileens company, this was technically their first date.
"Yeah, you did. So let's just drop it okay? I'm working through this. I don't need the third degree."
As Castiel walked home, he thought to himself about love and all the things that could mean for him. When he made it to his apartment he started a new painting, one with wings and halos and a piercing pair of emerald green eyes.
He had spent all the past five days wasting away his cooking money on Booz and drinking away his pain. He was halfway through a bottle of Jack when there was a rapid fit of knocking at his door. He reluctantly climbed off of the couch to open the door.
None of it was ideal, Castiel, angel of the lord, hunted, rebelled and fell because he loved Dean Winchester. He wasn't supposed to feel anything, and yet he felt so much he died for him time and time again. And Dean Winchester, a hunter, The Righteous Man, The Michael Sword, The Ultimate Killer... in the end the angel he fell for made sure he knew he was none of it. If he was anything in this world now, a father, a husband and more than anything, loved.
There hadn't been much turbulence which made Castiel happy, mainly because Dean would've freaked out. Castiel hummed mindlessly to that Beetles song and Dean slumped his head onto his shoulder. Cas smiled at his boyfriend before the flight attendant came back with two glasses of champagne and a bottle of water.
"Wait!" Jack said capturing the attention of all of them. "We should put it to sleep... for good. That way it can't try to take Castiel back."
"No... but you did." Sam laughed a little. Dean made a face of confusion, mainly embarrassed at what Sam was implying. Then Sam had to make it worse my mocking him. "'Fuck, Cas... Dean, mmm'. Dude, the walls are thin."
"Who?" Cas asked and Dean gestured around the whole room and then to his head in a vague explanation. Dean never really talks about his bipolar, so Cas never knows when he should do something to help since he doesn't know when it's happening.
Eventually Deans eyes got heavy and his lack of sleep caught up with him. He tried to stifle a yawn, but Cas still noticed.
He never managed to find his boxers so he just pulled on his jeans commando before leaving. He took a lingering glance at Castiel before he left and went home. His shame aside, he does feel good about one thing. Castiel said he would go out with Dean.
Sam and Gabriel cast them a suspicious look when they got to the restaurant late. And they gave even more looks when Dean winced as he took his seat. Castiel smiled to himself though, resting a hand on Deans thigh throughout the meal.
Thanksgiving comes without incident. Even though people don't celebrate thanksgiving here in France, it's still a Winchester tradition to eat a ton of pies on the last Thursday of the month. Dean had been pushing through school with the excitement of starting break. Break meant that he could fuck Castiel even more often. For that reason it had been over a week since him and Cas slept together, and just as long since Dean asked him out. Dean was usually smooth when it came to asking out girls, they were easy. But with Castiel it was different. Everything with him was intense in a way it never was before. If he was going to take Castiel out on a date he was going to do it right.
They listened to lots of music and played cat games, idly talking like old times alone the way. They spent hours cooped up in the black, leather interior car during the heat of summer before it became too much. The sun had already started to go down by the time they made it to a motel. The drive to Ada County was supposed to be seventeen hours long, so they already planned on stopping for the night as is. They made it as far as Jacinto Nebraska right as the sun went down beyond the horizon. They pulled up to a Sleep Inn motel just outside of Wyoming where they agreed to spend the night. Cas stayed in the car while Dean went inside to get their room.
The three of them stood behind Death as he spoke the incantation, successfully opening the empty. Sam looked at Dean with a worrisome expression. The three of them looked back and were sucked deep into the abyss. It was the same as Dean remembered. Frightening in all its intent. Sam stayed close to Death while he and Cas started to wander. Sam looked shocked and Dean tried to reassure him with a thin line of a smile. He only hoped that they actually could find the poor boy and make it out safely. They'd had enough sacrifice and deals in there life. After this, Dean just wanted a normal life.
Sam didn't know about the situation with Inias. There's no way he knew, but Dean still flushed as he took a sip. Gabriel took a sip as well but Dean was sure it was for different reason, knowing how much of a freak Gabe is.
"...Because I'm afraid." He sighed again before rubbing a hand over his face. She seemed surprised but still kept quiet.
"You don't? Well," he got even closer. "I would like to know which color, style, fabric you have containing that pretty, gian-"
"I- fuck- I love you. God, I love you." And just like that Castiel was clenching down and coming all at once with a wanton moan that Dean had never heard from him before.
Inias. Dean recognized the name. Gabriel had mentioned Inias the other night when Dean had said Castiel didn't want to date. He didn't say this though of course.
"You know, we should move around a bit. The point is to make a mess." Cas panted. In an instant, Dean flipped them over smearing the rainbow colored paints with the move. It felt a little weird to have drying paint on his shoulder and ass, but Dean just tightened his hold on them. Cas instantaneously wrapped his hand around Deans, intertwining their fingers and completing the fist. Both of them grounded and thrust into the palms of their own hands. Dean lifted up Castiels thighs and wrapped them around his waist as he sat back on his heels. He picked up the pace of his hand, twisting and thumbing at their heads and squeezing down at their bases until Castiel was fisting at the sheets, covered in a sheen of sweat and paint. Dean leaned down and sucked over Castiels collar bone and nipped his way up his Adam's apple to mouth along his jaw.
Deans blanket tossed over the sofa and his poetry books on the coffee table. His beer in the fridge that Cas can't stand. Even to the little bee pillow that Dean got Castiel on a whim at the store. Cas had twice as much food now that his chef boyfriend constantly cooks for him. Little nick nacks here and there that make Castiel consider what it would be like to have Dean here all the time. They already practically spend every night together and one of their places, but to actually live together would be different. Castiel brushed those thoughts off as soon as he heard the shower door open and then practically ran back into his bedroom meeting Dean as soon as he came out of the bathroom.
The two of them cleaned up from their dinner and decided to watch TV on the couch. Dean wasn't to surprised at the fact that Cas was a cuddler. After all, they had been sharing a bed for the past week. Dean wasn't usually a physical affection, kisses and cuddles kind of guy. And he thought he would be weirded out by doing it with Cas, but it just felt right. Castiels head was pillowed on his lap as they watched a documentary about honey bees. Cas was so mesmerized, Dean found it adorable. He couldn't even pay attention to the show anymore. He was just carding his fingers through Cas's shaggy dark brown hair. Occasionally, he traced the backs of his fingers along that scratchy stubble before Cas smiled and swatted his hand away. It all just felt so perfect.
"Ehem," he cleared his throat obnoxiously loud. "Can I get a hug too?" Sam asked looking at Cas with a big smile. Dean rolled his eyes and Cas strode towards Sam indulging him in a hug. It was much briefer and smaller than Deans, but that came as a relief. Eileen came in right behind Sam and Cas hugged her gently too.
"We're gay, Dean. It's only fitting that our painting is gay as well... I am excited to add some bright decor to the apartment."
Cas and Dean packed up for the hunt within an hour while Sam printed off all the reports for them. They waved their goodbyes to Eileen and Sam as they hopped into the Impala and headed to Idaho for their hunt.
"I know, I know Cassie. They still don't agree with our choices but... they're proud of your art. They said they knew you had the talent."
Their time alone went by quickly, unfortunately. Dean and Cas were making out pretty heavily in the library when they heard the bunker door open. Dean wanted to groan he was so disappointed. He loved Sam and Eileen, they weren't the problem. But he was seriously thinking about moving out with Cas. Then they could be alone whenever they wanted. Sam and Eileen came back home and despite his reservations, Dean smiled as he was able to see a little bit of a baby bump forming. All in all, he was looking forward to being an uncle.
"Please..." Death sighed and rolled his eyes before taking them out of his hands and adjusting them. Dean could hear the sounds of Metallica playing from the headphones before Death placed them over his ears and grimaced at the music. Dean took a few steps away trying to forget that he wasn't alone before he started to call out again.
"Sorry, I've been busy I guess." Gabriel shoved his way into the flat, as usual making his way into the kitchen.
The two of them finished their meals simply conversing over simple things before they left the restaurant. Before walking back to Deans car though, Dean walked him around a little bit continuing their conversation. Cas laughed at Deans tacky jokes and crude humor enjoying this date far more than he anticipated. Briefly it crosses his mind that he was walking here with Inias not even a week ago and he feels guilty for leading one, if not both of them on.
So, Sam and Eileen came over to help set up the nursery... Well, Sam helped. Eileen bought all the cute clothes and toys once they found out they were adopting a baby girl.
He finished up quickly and made his way out of the bathroom. He passed by his mess of a room and saw the disarray it was in. Beer bottles littered his nightstand, his bed was a mess, tissues were over filling the garbage can. He mentally kicked himself for being such a crybaby before he started to clean up a bit. He even took the extra liberty of organizing some. Once he was done he decided to strip out of his dirty, foul smelling clothes and change into something more decent. He opened his closet and pulled on a plain black and white Led Zeppelin t-shirt and threw on a blue and green flannel over top. He sat on the side of his bed to tie his boots and when he looked up he felt his heart stutter again.
"Not in detail no... but school is riding my ass and my piece of shit dad keeps sending me letters. I just need a break." He said the last part on a broken chuckle. Castiel finished pouring two glasses of wine before walking out to the living room.
They spend days in Ada just trying to find out what poor bastard was being puppeteered like a marionette. The eventually found out it was a St. Paul's boy named Robin.
"I love you too." He grumbled getting up to get more beer. Everyone started conversing a bit more and as the hours passed, the sun went down a bit. Suddenly Sam tapped a fork to his beer bottle getting everyone's attention as he stood up.
It's late enough in the day and they're both tired enough that they decide to go out to the beach instead tomorrow and spend the night in, watching bad television in bed. Dean even goes so far as to make popcorn in the kettle for the two of them as they laugh and cuddle watching foreign soap operas.
Two weeks after their conversation on the couch, Dean was fully moved out. It wasn't too difficult seeing as how most of Deans clothes and books were at Cas's anyways. Dean had met up with his pharmacist and got back on his medication.
"Ughhn... ah, shit... Dean!" And Dean felt Cas twitch his release inside of him. Dean relished in the feeling of Cas's warm body cloaked over him, both of them panting in pleasure and spent beyond belief. After their breathing regulated, Cas pulled out slowly but quickly, both of them hissing at the movement. Cas collapsed on his back next to Dean, not touching he turned his head to look at Dean after a while.
Damnit, he could already feel tears burning his eyes. He got up and slammed the closet door breathing heavily. He saw his keys on his desk and grabbed them off quickly before storming out of his room. He passed Sam in the library who was talking on the phone.
"I would like that very much, Dean." He answered plainly before pouring them each a mug of coffee. He pulled out two plate from the cupboard as Dean finished up making the omelettes. "Why don't we eat on the balcony? It's lovely out this morning."
"You and Cas?!" He whisper yelled. Dean just looked over his shoulder at Cas who was tugging on his sling and looked back at his brother. He huffed a little laugh before going back to the dishes.
"Now is not the time to make that decision." Castiel panted. This was something that they needed to talk about before it happened so he just continued and rolled it on before slamming home into Dean. They both gasped as Castiels hips hit flush with the backs of Deans thighs. Castiel held still for a minute, if not to let Dean adjust, then to stop himself from coming too soon. Castiel was proud of how quickly Dean adjusted to being like this. How he went from scared to try two fingers and now he's pressing down on Cas's cock to take him deeper in the middle of his living room. As much as Cas would've loved to go slow and listen to ever little whine and whimper Dean makes. As much as he wants to just hold Dean close and fuck him slow and steady listening to his heartbeat pulse and his breath hitch, they are on the clock. Without warning Castiel started moving fast practically slamming Dean forward with each thrust. The sounds of skin slapping filled the room as Dean tried to angle his head for a kiss. Castiels lips and tongue met Deans in a sloppy shaky kiss before Deans head fell beneath his shoulders and moaned. Castiel get that simmering heat building but he was determined to try something.
"Well," Dean cleared his throat. "I just started pastry school here a few months ago  and Sammy here is living with me until December."
"I'm sorry. So I hate to ask you this, but Gabe's taking me out tonight and would it be okay if I brought him here afterwards?"
"Sammy, you are a genius!" Dean smiled. Sam handed him the round framed glasses and Dean put them on. It took a moment for his eyes to adjust, but then he was fine. He looked around at the walls and ceilings and there were no sigils that he could see. He sighed a little bit before he looked down at the feather in his hands. It was literally glowing and there were small silver rings around it like a halo, covered with eyes. It was actually really- wait...
Dean slept deeply that night. He dozed off happy and pleasantly sore from post-coital bliss wrapped in Castiels strong arms. He tried to stay awake tracing the planes of Cas's body, the soft angles and divots of his muscles. He tried to memorize every inch of him before the calm warmth pulled him under into a deep sleep. He crashed with a smile on his face and he woke up with another one. He was up long before Castiel and laid in bed for a long time, just watching Castiel sleep. He carded his fingers through his hair and placed kisses along his shoulders and his tattoos until Cas woke up with a bright gleam. They made out long and slow until Dean had to go to school but the smile never left his face. And every time he said the words in his head his grin got even wider to the point his face hurt.
"You aren't exactly the most subtle." Clair pointed out. Cas smirked taking a swig of Deans beer. Dean glared at Cas and took his beer back.
Dean made them Coq Au Vin for dinner and they ate on the balcony watching the sunset while holding hands under the table. They drank wine and talked about simple things and how Castiel is getting in line to sell another one of his pieces.
"Oh don't be. Sammy always had a stick up his ass, at least this current one seems to have him in better spirits." He chuckled. Castiel couldn't help but laugh too.
"Ugh don't say 'coitus' ever again." Castiel rinsed the sink before going back to find Dean in the bedroom. He stopped in the doorway when he found Dean in one of the pairs of panties though. Dean hadn't worn these yet. They were baby blue lace and if they were the pair Cas thought they were then they were a thong.
Dean rolled his eyes but didn't let up his grip. Pamela was tattooing him and Crowley was tattooing Cas. Crowley was actually British and Pam was German but spoke English. She was in the process of putting the stencil on his chest right over his heart.
True to his word Dean was at his flat in ten minutes. Dean didn't even knock he just came in the already unlocked door.
"Let's go out drinking. It's been a while, no hook ups, just you and me." Gabe suggested. Castiel sighed.
"Yeah. That might be a little hectic. Surely you've noticed your boyfriend can be a pain in the ass."
"Um, I would like to note that you kissed me back even longer." Castiel said taking a bite of bacon. Dean gave him an unamused look, to which Cas just blew a cheesy kiss. Sam and Eileen laughed in sync at the action.
"Fair point. I'll see if maybe I can get him into some lingerie. I feel as though that would make for a lovely painting."
"I won't keep you waiting, mon chéri." Dean got up without another word and stripped down naked, crawling into bed and waiting for Castiel. A sudden looming thought crossed his mind. Tonight has been almost like a date. Granted the circumstances weren't the most conventional, but it was nice.
They took turns passing the pipe back in forth until the bowl was cashed and they were pleasantly clouded. Castiels head was pillowed on Deans chest as he traced circles on his abdomen in thought.
He padded into the living room quietly, and sat down on the couch. He set the drawing down on the table and opened the robe before stroking himself once. He winced as his hand was too dry but he wasn't going to risk waking Castiel up to grab the lube.
"Dean Winchester, would you make me the happiest being in creation, and be my husband?" Castiel had a glistening tear in his eyes and Dean felt his own forming. For the first time in a while, he didn't feel bad for crying, or ashamed. Just utterly happy.
"Well, there is variations of the spell. The last time we only needed a few ingredients, but that rare one is gone, right?"
"Alright. Well um. We met in the summer and kind of just... experimented. We went on dates and things were great until," he sighed, hesitant on even finishing the story. "He told me he was married."
"Yours is probably better, mines a mess what with Sam still moving in for the time being." Castiel nodded with a smile before hailing them a cab. The slid into the backseat together in an oddly arousing silence. Dean knows how one night stands work, but for some reason this felt different. He felt safe with Castiel and he didn't know why. He had only ever slept with one other man, his old friend Lee. So he was slightly nervous about his inexperience, but Castiel already knew he only slept with one man. Dean couldn't help but feel like Castiel was going to be understanding. The cab driver asked something in French and Dean, still being new here, only understood the words location and close.
"It actually looks pretty good." He mumbled into Deans hair. "Plehh," he said spitting. "Paint in my mouth."
Dean woke up the next morning to an empty bed. As he sat up he felt the stiffness leave his body after spending so many nights on a rock hard mattress. He looked up and spotted a note on the nightstand.
Castiel was on a phone call with Gabe when Dean got into his apartment. He smiled at Dean from the balcony before rolling his eyes at Gabes arguing.
Of all the things Dean expected when he opened the box in the late afternoon the next day, it was this. Deans mouth went dry instantly the second he opened the box and felt a twinge of excitement simmer low in his gut.
Castiel was truly something else. The way he touched Dean was as if they had had sex thousands of times as opposed to twice. And although he wouldn't really admit it, he almost enjoyed their small talks and conversations over breakfast getting to know each other almost as much as sex. They hardly knew anything about each other but Dean found himself wanting to know everything about Cas. He wanted to know more about his emancipation and why he wanted to be an artist. He wanted to know about his sexy, sexy tattoos and what they meant. He wanted to know every minuscule detail about the blue eyed man. And although dating wasn't in the cards for either of them, he couldn't help but wonder if it would really be the worst thing.
"So you say something you've never done,  and if another person has done it, they have to take a drink. The goal is to get the other people to finish their drinks before you do." Cas explained.
"Look all I'm saying is that Dean seems like a nice guy. Not to mention he's smokin' like his brother. Would dating him really be the worst thing?"
"Precisely. And if you try to get out," Dean took the scythe out of his hands. "This, will be your fate." Death looked annoyed but Dean couldn't bother to care. He took Cas's hand and headed for the door. He looked it behind them and headed out in the basement. When they past the dungeon, Dean walked quickly past it heading upstairs into the kitchen. Once the finally sat down, Dean very reluctantly let go of Cas's hand, instantly missing the soft warmth of it.
Dean took a shaky sigh. "I didn't want you to be the one who found me..." it was vague no doubt but based on the hitch in Cas's breath, he knew very well.
"You've gotten much more used to this now. I like that you've learned not to be nervous around me." Dean made direct eye contact as he reached up Castiels legs, pulling the hem of his sweat pants down. Dean trailed kisses all the way up Castiels thighs until Cas was floating somewhere outside his own body. By the time Dean actually got his mouth around Castiels cock, Cas's hand flew to Deans hair, gently guiding his movements. Dean groaned when Cas pushed down a little too hard, so Cas did it again.
"Yes. But unfortunately I don't have time to faire l'amour to you. I'm meeting up with Gabe for coffee. He's the one who managed to get in touch with Mr. Roman."
"So talk to me. Tell me these things. If you didn't like it, then we could've gotten you a different prescription. I don't want you to be scared, Dean."
The first words he ever spoke to Dean. And the mind numbing sound and phantom feeling on his shoulder of his last words.
"I'm so sorry, Dean." Cas said and his eyes looked earnest. "I wish you hadn't gone through that." He said stroking the hair off of Deans face.
The two of them went to Le Bouchon again. Benny poured them drinks and Gabe talked on and on about Sam. Castiel laughed at a few of the stories and was genuinely happy that Gabe was in a relationship. Gabe of course pestered him to ask Dean out on an actual date which he brushed off yet again. The two talked for hours enjoying the company of one another. A little after midnight just as Castiel was about to call it a night, someone tapped on his shoulder. He turned around and had to do a double take to believe who he was staring at.
"It's a surprise. But after this surprise, I'm dragging you to go see your father rather you like it or not."
"In a minute." He replied, his voice was rasp and horse and when he sniffled, Cas knew he'd been crying and his heart sank.
He hopped into the Impala and started her up. The second the car turned on Zepp started to play through the speakers. Normally he wouldn't think much of it, but he remembered the first time he showed Cas this specific song and how he laughed with Dean as they headed off to hunt a vamp nest. It stung bitter in his gut and his eyes threatened to tear up again but no. He changed the radio to Black Sabbath and started to blast it as he drove off. If he was going to face his feelings, he refused to cry anymore over Castiel. Even though it would likely happen again.
"Okay babe." He chuckled. He fell asleep soon after that warm and heavy with the weed. Or maybe that was just his heart.
"Merci Monsieur." She said and reached her arms up wrapping Dean in a hug. Dean whispered something he couldn't hear to her and she giggled before running up and hugging Castiels legs. He smiled and nearly stumbled before her mother was calling for her. Dean smiled and waved as she ran back and held Castiels hand once more.
Dean followed Cas out to the kitchen where the pulled up two extra chairs for Kelly and Jack. Dean served up Cas's plate before he got his own, smiling softly as he sat down next to him. Sam and Eileen seemed to be all over each other and more 'lovey dovey' than usual, so Dean could only assume she had told Sam about the pregnancy.
"Probably. But I would rather not think about that right now." He chuckled. His arm wound around Deans waist and pulled him in even closer. Dean felt so warm and sated and content. He just nuzzled into Castiels neck with a yawn.
"That first night we spent together back in September, I was able to paint again. The painting of the skyline that's by the hall tree?"
It felt as if he was still in the dream feeling the sun on his face. His mind muddled and bloodied at the thought of losing it, but he looked back to the barn where it all began, from where he escaped his past and he knew it was worth every minute. Castiel and him had been through lifetimes together, always falling for one another despite what the story was supposed to say. Cas thought he was broken but Dean knew better. He remembered a poem he had read a few years back by Christopher Poindexter.
Cas helped him stand onto shaky feet and held him close as he put the letters spread on the table back into the box. He closed and they headed back inside. Once they were in the bedroom, he helped Dean back out of his jeans so he was in just his boxers and Dean decided to take off his t-shirt as well. In the dim light of the bedroom, Castiel noticed Dean looked a little skinnier. He had always had a soft tummy from always cooking and eating, but he had obviously lost some weight and that worried Cas a bit. He bit his lip and didn't say anything as he lowered him into the bed and tucked him tight. He turned off the lamp and crawled into bed pulling Dean tight against his chest. He stroked his hair trying to soothe his lover more and stop his trembling.
Dean turned away from the conversation a bit. He knows Cas has been with other people. Lots of other people. Hell, he's seen it. But now it makes him jealous in a way he's never felt before. At least he doesn't have to worry about Meg, Cas said she was aesexual. Not to mention, Cas is pretty gay.
"The meds did that though. I like your tummy. It's soft and well loved from good food and cuddles." He smiled and nuzzled closer into Deans side.
"I wasn't gonna let him talk about you like that. If it was just me, fine. But not you. You have dealt with too much homophobic assholes in your life and I'm not having it."
"It's an expression, Cas." Dean muttered before crossing his arms and wishing he didn't exist. Luckily no one said another word about it, Sam probably knew that it would make Dean feel emasculated.
Four years into their marriage and things were still as amazing as ever, just slightly more pointless bickering. Cas was thirty three now and Dean bitched about turning thirty. Castiel managed to talk Dean into getting a cat that they named Salem. A few months into being a pet owner, Dean remembered how much he wanted to have actual children and so he brought it up with Castiel. Cas agreed immediately and they got on a waiting list for adoption.
Dean stalked off to Castiels bathroom that Cas has sort of started considering their bathroom. Dean showers at Cas's all the time even when they don't stay there. And Castiel understands why, he's used Deans shower and it's like an ice bath compared to Cas's. As Dean was showering Castiel looked around and started to look at other thing he had started to consider as theirs.
Castiel lurched forward and wrapped his arms around Dean, burying his face in his neck while he cried softly. Dean held him close stroking his back softly while he cried.
"Of course I love you." Dean replied. No question. With that, Cas hungrily pushed himself against Dean, feeling the intensity of sparks as their lips met again.
"Fairly. There was Michael, he was an artist as well and that is where our problems were. Then there was Meg, the only girl I have ever been with when I was experiencing. And then Inias, my first."
Cas came in and cuddled up behind Dean, kissing the back of his neck softly. Dean sighed happily in the embrace of his angel before dozing off to sleep.
"I'm not a celebrity," just then there was a knock at the door. Cas opened it to find Balthazar and Charlie on the other side.
Getting his shirt off was a bit bigger of a struggle since Dean really didn't want to hurt him, in the end the both decided against putting a sleep shirt on him. Cas leaned back to sit up against the headboard while Dean dug around in his dresser for pajamas. All of his stuff was dirty so he was just going to have to sleep in his briefs for the night. He turned off the lights so the room was only illuminated by the lamp on Deans side of the bed. Once he got into the covers, Cas smiled softly at him before frowning.
Castiel was surprised to hear Dean still there in the morning. The bright sun creeped in through the windows blinding Castiel. He was suddenly very aware of the headache making his vision white and his ears ring as the throbbing sensation in the back of his skull pounded without relent. It didn't take long before his drunken night hit his stomach and he was running to the bathroom.
"Would you like me to explain to your brother the circumstances as to why I said such a word?" Dean shot up and shook his head. "Then stop complaining. I learned all this vocabulary from you anyways."
"I wish I could heal you." Cas whispered. Dean lifted up the small vile of grace still wrapped around neck.
Dean found himself swimming up out of a hot, hazy dream about Cas into bleary half consciousness with arousal tingling through his limp body and coiling in his groin. His lips felt softer for some reason. They felt wrapped in something hot and moist, soft and wet and pulsing. It took Dean a moment to realize it was Cas's mouth, caressing and kissing him slowly but steadily. His fingers were entwined with his, and that let him know he's safe, even before he was awake enough to remember where he's supposed to be.
"Well if you did make me up, you did a pretty shit job." Castiel said. He wasn't expecting to get a smile out of him tonight but it was there. Just a faint kind smile. "Can I ask you something?"
"Mm, but they are conducive for easy access." Dean smirked grabbing Cas's ass through the pleated fabric. Cas leaned in close for a long lingering kiss letting their tongues mangle together for a moment. Once they separated his eyes were dark and observant as they were both panting for air.
"Wow just," he swallowed his mouth insanely dry. "Yeah. Wow... but what about you? I- shit I didn't mean to-"
"Hang on a sec, Eileen." He said into the receiver as Dean walked right past him. "Hey, where are you going?"
"Yes. That," Cas said sitting legs crossed on the floor with her. "Is a dedication page. I wrote the book for you."
The two of them ate in that night on the couch. Dean was restless the entire time sitting there and Cas couldn't blame him.
"Yeah. I'm pretty sure my Dad had it too. But when I would start to feel scared or overwhelmed by it, my Mom would sing The Beetles or something to me."
"No, I'm not." He laughed awkwardly. "My uh... partner is in the car." He shrugged. She made a face of understanding and slight disappointment, but Dean didn't really care. She scanned his face credit card and gave him the room key. Dean thanked her and sauntered back outside to the car. Cas was leaning up against the hood and he looked adorable as ever. He was wearing a pair of Deans old jeans and one of his flannels, a simple blue and green one. His hair was artfully tousled from Dean fluffing it all day. When he saw Dean across the parking lot, his face lit up in a smile and he wondered; not for the first time, how he deserved Cas. Dean walked the rest of the way over and helped him get the duffle bags out of the trunk. They walked to the door the lady had said Room 116 and opened the door.
Silence fell over them and it wasn't awkward, it never was with them. There wasn't any tension aside from the obvious, but it was solemn. Castiel looked like he had been on the verge of tears for a while, but none ever fell and it broke Deans heart. He sure as hell was scared because he was taught he couldn't love boys, but Cas wasn't just some boy. Cas is his Mary. So John can suck it. But finally, Castiel looked up of his own accord, locking eyes with Dean before letting out a shaky sigh.
"Remember I'll always be true. And then while I'm away, I'll write home everyday," they sang together as Castiel walked out onto the balcony. "And I'll send all my loving to you."
"No, Dean. I was drunk and was speaking nonsense. It's just that an old friend came back into my life and asked me out. I was just stressing it had nothing to do with you."
"Well your brother called me and he's hammered so I'm going to go check and make sure he's okay." Dean answered pulling on his boots. Gabriel stared at him a moment before speaking up.
Dean fell asleep feeling both content yet exposed. He had just been the most vulnerable he ever had been with Cas that evening. Opening up about his trauma wasn't something he did with just anyone, and opening up about his bipolar was something he never did. But Castiel had made him feel adored. Special. And he could only hope that things would stay that way.
"Oh man!" She punched him in the shoulder. "I was at the art show in Paris. I loved your angel paintings. And then I saw you in a news article with some blonde guy and- I'm a huge fan. Could I possibly get an autograph?"
"What are you- how are you?" Castiel asked disoriented. Dean didn't answer just held him close. Castiel leaned into his embrace that was more of a side hug. It was a little uncomfortable in the position they were, but neither cared. After a moment, Dean stood and held his hand out. Castiel took Deans hand and stood next to him. Cas stopped and his face furrowed and he felt the nick on his neck.
"Then let me make this official," Cas said with a cheeky grin. "Dean Winchester, will you be my boyfriend?"
"That's the plan," Castiel smiled before reaching into the side table and pulling out a bottle of lube. "Good thing I put this here last time I visited."
"Please," he scoffed. "You guys helped set up our nursery and helped us the whole move. It's the least we could do."
With Thanksgiving approaching, Dean is contemplating inviting Cas over for dinner. He knows he's already going to be cooking for Sam and him, but he thinks it might be fun. Sam was already talking about having Gabe join them anyways. Sam keeps nagging him and urging him to ask Castiel out, but to be honest he thinks it might complicate things. The sex is great- hell best of his life- but relationships complicate everything. Cas is a great guy and if he put his heart on his sleeve, he's afraid the same thing will happen that did last time.
"Nothing to tell." He said turning his attention back to the book. "You want to go to bed, be my guest. But I'm not sleeping until Cas is back here in-" Dean almost said what he was thinking. Cas being back here and in his arms. But he was not going to say that to his brother. Not ready for that talk yet, so he just coughed and finished. "Back here in the bunker."
"Ugh, you guys are so sweet it's gonna spoil dessert." San groaned and walked towards the table. Just as Dean was going to say something, a red headed girl from his class came up to them.
Dean took a sip of wine hissing as the alcohol warmed his throat while Castiel made his way to the couch. Castiel opened his little box and pulled out his stash while Dean watched.
"Mornin', Cas." He smiled as he pecked a quick kiss on Castiels lips. "Want me to make you breakfast?"
"Well from what I've heard, things aren't great back home. And although I'm more than well off enough to fly out to the states, I like having you around. So move in with me."
"Okay." Dean rasped, throat dry. Castiel worked peppering kisses over the insides of his thighs, nipping every now and then like he knows Dean likes. It didn't take long before Dean was plumping especially with Cas's soft lips and faintly murmured praise. Before Dean was expecting it a wet digit was circling Deans entrance. His body twitched and convulsed from the sheer promise of it before Castiels other hand steadied his hip. Cas shushed him before circling again, slowly working Dean up.
"I'm as free as a bird now, and this bird you cannot change," he said the lyrics questioningly. "I changed in the flight of heaven, I get it now. I like it." He beamed.
Dean realized then how hard it is to live in the excitement of women and yet have no desire for them. Now this angel has taken him, and silenced him. Been his light while gods monsters and his exes have been the shadows and confines of darkness. The way Cas touches him and has stilled him breathless, yet he still can't be quiet. With Cas it is to be broken, and torn open, vulnerable. Giving things he's never given before. Being this vulnerable, it almost hurts, but Cas is there healing him. Making him whole again.
"You think I'll look like Sam Heughan?" Dean asked and gestured to the tall muscular Scot on the television.
He knelt down to the ground to pick it up and examine it. It was a beautiful, long, shiny black feather. The end of it looked like it was dipped in an oil slick with an iridescent sheen. When Dean put it into the light it reflected shades of jade green, cerulean blue, and an indigo shade. The feather was soft and felt comforting and it almost took Dean a minute to snap out of his gaze. The feather wasn't that of any bird, it was much too long, almost the size of Deans forearm. Not to mention he'd never seen a bird with a feather color like that. And almost instantaneously he heard Cas's voice in his head. So close it was like he was right next to him.
But Dean bit his lip and followed in suite, stripping his own clothes as they headed to Deans room. They were both clad in nothing but their boxers by the time they got the door shut to the room. Castiel was pressing back against Dean, mouth relentless as it kissed down Deans neck and chest making his eyes roll into his head.
"Nothing. Just hurt my foot." He replied. Once the pain subsided he leaned down to pick up what he stepped on. It was a necklace, a weird one at that. It looked like some kind of demon or tiki but despite its creepy appearance, it felt calming. He knew immediately that it was Deans and quickly pulled out his phone.
Cas didn't respond after a moment and when he turned around, Cas was still sitting up, fidgeting nervously.
Although Castiel didn't really want to, it had been a while since he had been laid and he still didn't want to deny Inias anything. After all he had left in the night for France with so much as a note after he said he loved him. But Castiel is much more aware now that what he felt wasn't love.
"Daddy's very childish isn't he?" Cas whispered to her making her giggle. "Should we go open your presents?"
"But it's not. I don't know where I am anymore. Who I am anymore. Or why I'm even here. I feel so... distant."
Dean woke up early the next morning. Castiel was snoring softly next to him. It was still dark out, long before sunset and he had every intention of nuzzling back in bed with Castiel and falling right back asleep. As he closed his eyes however, the noisy neighbors upstairs were going at it like rabbits and he grimaced as he got out of bed. He stretched on his feet, muscles protesting from the rounds they went last night.
Specifically lingerie. Dean inspected the black garment in his hands. Castiel must've spent good money on this. The fabric was fine silk with lace embroidered on the sides and the back was made of mesh. They weren't just any panties though, based on the fit they were designed for men. And the part that made Dean blush was the little pink bow right above the crotch. Dean gulped as he pulled out his phone and texted Cas: Really?
Later that night when they were curled up in bed sated and giggly, Dean still had fine tremors running through his body as they kept tangled together in the sweaty sheets. A sudden thought occurred to Dean so he turned his face and nosed at Cas's jaw.
"Well I've had to deal with a shit hand in life so I've kind of had to tell myself that. Or as they say such is life and there's nothing you can do about it."
They sat their in the presence of one another for a long time, enjoying the dark peaceful silence. Somehow things were said without either of them speaking. It was just so... perfect.
"Not like you read them anyway." Sam mumbled, teeth still clattering from the cold. Dean rolled his eyes rifling through the rest of the letters, sighing when he saw the one from his pharmacy.
Valentine's Day is fast approaching and there is something that Castiel has been meaning to ask Dean about ever since that time they had sex on Deans couch.
"Well, that's the last of it." Sam said as he left the nursery. Not his nursery, but Dean and Cas's.
"Well now that you're not there to distract me from Mr. Campbells lessons, I would say so." Castiel joked.
"That's not what you said to Dean this morning is it?" He picked one last time. "I'm kidding!" He hollered as Castiel barged into the kitchen. "Jesus what crawled up your ass? Dean?"
"Of course! My girlfriend Dorothee came too. She's as much of a nerd for your art as I am. But aahhhh!" She squealed. "You guys are getting married!"
Their was no chastity to the kiss that broke out. The two conformed to each other with the same chaotic force that had brought them together. Cas let out a small groan when he felt Dean's length pushing stiffly against the jut of his hipbone. His hands came down to wrap around Dean's chiseled back and wander along the curve of his spine. He swooned as Dean's hands wandered down to grasp his ass tightly and rub their hips ever closer. The motion felt desparate, filled with the agony of wanting to merge into the oneness of their souls. Cas bent into the shape of Dean as he pulled every part of their body into a perfect curve. His groin began to ache with the contact as their tongues danced in each other's warm mouths. Cas pushed even further in, the kisses becoming so rough that the two rows of white teeth began to clash against each other. Dean whimpered and threw his neck back to the greedly delight of Cas, who began to nibble and kiss along the stubble on Dean's jawline and the skin he could get to.
"Besides," he said nuzzling in closer. "This is going to work out, rather you like it or not. Because I can't give you up."
"Dean, I need you to spread your legs a little for me, okay?" Dean nodded and complied letting his head fall back into the pillows. A little bit of nervousness was setting in as he heard the cap of lube pop. He tensed slightly before Castiel shushed him. "It's just us, Dean. Okay? Just you and me. Relax. Two fingers, if you don't like it we can go back to before."
"I swear to god Gabriel I will throw your ass out." Castiel said not in the mood for Gabriel's relentless teasing.
"I love you, but you're letting all the steam out. Plus the floors getting wet." Dean smiled and rolled his eyes before shutting the door.
"Hey." Dean blushed. Dean had Cas's white robe wrapped loosely around him, his hair still dripping. His skin was flushed pink from the heat of the shower and glistening like the silk of the robe from the steam. He was a picture of beauty.
Dean felt contented as he fell asleep in Cas's arms after a long yet satisfying day. He couldn't imagine feeling any happier.
"Okay." Castiel didn't look remorseful, just understanding. Dean wanted to ask if he should go on new medication, or if they should at least try to have sex. He wanted to ask if Castiel missed sex, or if he was unhappy with not having any. But he couldn't ask any of it right now. It didn't feel right. He knew deep down the meds had to have been affecting his libido, because even when Cas was naked in front of him he didn't lust they way he used to. Sure he still thought he was the sexiest thing on two legs, but he didn't feel the need to have Castiel with him in that way. Un rushed and unheated and so very unfamiliar. He decided then that maybe if he stopped taking the meds right then and there that things could go back to normal. That he and Castiel could touch each other in that way again.
Despite the fact he practically threw up a brewery, he found himself at a liquor store and ended up at home again drinking the ache away.
"I had my wings done about four years ago now. You like?" Castiel asked. Dean found himself walking forward and his fingers running on their own. Castiel had soft, pasty skin and to find such intricately detailed black wings inked onto his skin was breathtaking. The wings started in between his shoulder blades and fanned out all the way down his shoulders, back even down to his elbows. Each feather was so detailed it truly looked real. Like Castiel was an actual angel. He kissed the side of Castiels neck while his hands still smoothed over the wings. Castiel turned in his arms and started kissing Deans neck. Deans eyes rolled into the back of his head as he let himself be swept away by the sensation.
"So, are you gonna tell us her name or what?" Donna asked crossing her arms. Dean looked back at Cas who was holding her with a question in his eyes. Cas held the baby closer, tucking her under his chin as if to protect her.
"Open the front page, sweetheart." Dean smiled. He knew that Cas had put her on the dedication page and she looked confused to see it.
Dean and Sam broke the devils trap in order to let Cyrus free and find Balthazar's collection. They had been sitting and waiting at the crossroads for over an hour waiting for him to get back.
"I think... I think I need to talk to Sam." Dean said looking at Cas. Dean knew Cas understood what he meant and nodded.
Dean's heart fluttered and his lips parted, the words were on the tip of his tongue but they refused to come. He shifted his hips in hopes that the angel would take that as an answer but Castiel simply shook his head.
"I'm gonna call Gabe, okay? Can I see your phone?" Sam pulled it out of his pocket and handed it to him. Dean smiled and chuckled slightly as the lock screen was a picture of the two of them smiling in bed. He opened the contacts and found Deans in the favorites section before pressing call. It rung three times before he picked up.
Dean and Sam were riding in the Impala spending some brotherly time together while listening to Zeppelin.
"Well I'm not exactly fluent, fluent... but I get the gist of conversations and instructions. However my speaking is terrible." He chuckled.
"Well Sammy, can I buy you a drink?" Gabriel smirked. The taller man blushed and nodded as the two got up and went over to the bar. Dean appeared to be nervous which Castiel felt enduring.
"Well the other day you said I was like your best friend. So are we friends with benefits? Are we fuck buddies? Are we dating? Are we... I dunno, boyfriends?" Dean mumbled shyly.
"No problem." He said as he dug into his own short stack. They two ate their breakfasts in companionable silence savoring each sip of strong black coffee.
"Yeah, you totally did. And then there was Allen, and Captain Kirk, Matt Dillon, Dr. Sexy... plus the sexual tension between you and Cas over the years had almost been unbearable."
They headed down to the basement and Dean tried to suppress the shiver that ran through him of the cold, empty sadness he felt when he walked down there. Once they found the door Dean turned to look at Sam.
Dean drove quickly to the pharmacy to get his fill, and as soon as it was paid for, he took one and headed back to the motel.
"Dean-o can you give us some privacy?" Gabe asked and when Dean turned around Sam was kissing Gabriel's neck.
"He wouldn't want this for you, you know." Dean blinked at Sam. To anyone else, coming from anyone else, it would seem like a heartfelt honest statement. But the way Sam said it, it's like he already knew about the feelings Dean had about Cas. Which is crazy because Dean doesn't even really understand them. Sam tapped the doorframe and walked out, leaving Dean in the dim lit room alone with his thoughts. With Dean alone he couldn't help but wonder.
"Believe me I've noticed." Sam smirked and shot an exaggerated wink. Dean tried to tamper down a laugh. "So, how are you?"
After a whole year of waiting, a young mother named Kelly Kline wasn't ready to raise a child on her own. She liked Castiel instantly when they met and they arranged to adopt the baby once it was born. Lone behold five months later, Dean and Castiel became parents. Dean cried so many times that day, he was sure he'd run out of tears for the rest of his life.
He walked out into the living room to find Inias flipping through a sketchbook. Normally he wouldn't mind someone, especially an old friend like Inias going through his work. But he recognized the sage green cover and bolted to take it out of his hands.
"What? I got something on my face?" He asked. Cas reached his hand out and ghosted his fingers across the bruise on his cheek bone. His thumb the brushed and pulled his lower lip down where he could feel the dried scab of its split.
"Hey, come back to me. You're thinking to hard." Castiel said. Dean turned his head and he was lying on his side, face pressed into the pillows. He looked absolutely beautiful with his rumbled hair. Suddenly they weren't alone and there was another voice.
"Uh here," Dean said handing him a letter from Sam's bank. "Dad hasn't sent any letters in a while."
Cas shook his head on a laugh as the waiter came back with their food. To Dean's surprise, he actually liked the food, but he would never let Sam know. Most of their meal they talked about what they did while the other was gone, leaving out certain details. They talked a little about Baby names and Dean almost cried when Sam suggested if it's a boy to name it after him. The dinner was really nice and even for a moment, it felt like a personal one. A moment or two Cas would just look at him and it'd feel like they were all alone.
"I should've texted," Dean said. His voice sounded like it was coming from outside himself, or maybe he was hearing it from outside himself. The words don't belong to him and could barely be heard over the buzzing in his ears.
"Dean! Wake up! Jesus Chri- Dean!" His younger brother yelled. His head was throbbing and he cracked open an eye only to hiss at the bright light.
The next warehouse was much cleaner and hadn't been abandoned as long, maybe fifteen years max. The place used to be an old lumber mill and based on the constant creeks and groans of the old metal, the two wouldn't have been surprised if the place was haunted. There wasn't any particular supernatural item. Nothing to indicate that Balthazar's collection was in the place, which is part of the reason why they looked harder. When Balthazar was alive he was a pompous ass who would have tricked you into believing one thing, when really it was another. In many ways he was like Gabriel, a trickster. They searched the place high and low but they didn't find anything. Just when they were on their way out of the old building, Deans eye caught something.
"Hey, Cas." Sam said. Dean whipped around to see a very adorable, sleep rumpled Castiel. "We didn't mean to wake you."
"Oh, here," Dean said grabbing the vile of Cas's grace out of his pocket. "I'm so sorry, I completely forgot about it."
"Of course I'm real, baby. Why?... are you hearing things again?" Dean couldn't respond, his mouth was too dry, so he just nodded. Castiel smiled a thin apologetic line and pulled Dean into him, not caring about the still there mess. Dean shivered and sighed before relaxing into his arms.
Dean knew happiness. Happiness was his mom making him PB&J during the summer time, or her singing Hey Jude until he dozed to sleep. Happiness was the feeling he felt when Sam got accepted to his dream school and saw an out of hunting. Happiness was when Cas first said he loved him, despite the sadness that followed. Happiness was both in the having and in the being. His and Cas's first kiss, first time making love, when Cas proposed, their wedding day, the dedications to him in his husbands books. Yes, Dean Winchester thought he knew true happiness.
"We're leaving, I'll call you tomorrow," Castiel said to Gabriel. "Au revoir, Benny." He said as he continued to pull them out to the street.
"More like you got stuck with me. My boyfriend, an incredibly sexy, successful artist, covered in tattoos with a penchant for expensive weed and a knowledge for good literature. And you chose a manic  bisexual with fuck tons of trauma who wants to make food for a living. Yeah, I think I came out on top here."
"Jack... he's rebuilding things. He sent me back." She answered. "I don't know what's going on with him though. He seems... different."
Dean felt a twinge of excitement at the implications. Now he was a little impatient and desperately wished it was nine at night versus four in the afternoon.
"I too have a bit of an announcement," Sam muttered. "Well, more of a question." His younger brother turned to Eileen who was facing him on the bench of one of the tables, face furrowed in confusion. He got down on one knee and everyone gasped.
"Don't bother, I finished it. It gave me the name of one of the ingredients we need, but I have no idea what it is."
Cas sat up and grabbed Deans face pulling him into a tender kiss. It's a little inelegant and Dean knows he tastes too much like alcohol but neither of them seem to care. "I don't want to sleep with anyone else. Just you." Cas whispered.
"Cum for me, Dean." And just like that Dean was moaning and spilling all over Cas's hand and trembling.
The two of them went to the store in silence only speaking when Dean asked where Gabriel was taking Sam. Once the two made it to Monoprix, they went their separate ways to grab what they needed. Sam headed to the produce section to grab his frilly food, while Dean headed towards the back section to get toiletries first. He also picked up some groceries and special ingredients such as almond flour and powdered sugar that he knew he would need for their next pastry section at the school. He met up with Sam near the checkouts and he had a basket filled to the brim with protein packs and vegetables. Sam took one look in Deans cart and bolted off quickly like he had forgotten to get something. Sammy ran back to get whatever he was getting while Dean made his own purchases and had everything loaded back up in the Impala by the time Sam made it back. The two hopped in and drove back home to unload their things. Once everything was settled in again, Sam watched television whilst Dean was reading some of the recipes he had to make for next week. Dean couldn't really focus on all the reading so instead he tried to imagine what Castiel could have in mind for tonight.
They left and went home with their daughter and Cas was hogging her just a bit. He apologized, but Dean got it. He didn't want to let her go either. Sam and Eileen came over and Dean reluctantly let them hold the baby, not that he didn't trust them, but because he loved her so much. He'd only known her for a matter of hours and he knew that he lover her and Cas with the entirety of his being. Not heaven, hell, gods, monsters, angels not demons could take that away from him this time.
This was Cas's. He didn't know how he knew that, he just did. Same as the key, he knew it was from Castiel. This was a feather from his wings and Dean held tight to it. Sam was already back at the Impala, waiting for Dean. Dean pushed open the door to the warehouse and waved his arm, signaling for Sam to come back. Sam opened the Impala door with a confused furrow on his face.
"Cas!" Was the last word on Deans tongue before he felt like he lost the inability to speak. For a moment of post coital bliss- as Cas would call it- his limbs were shaking with his orgasm and he couldn't move. Castiel of course, didn't seem to mind. Dean sat up and tried to pull himself off. Once he flopped back onto the bed next to his boyfriend his thighs were sore and he realized probably cramped as well. He hissed for a moment before closing his eyes and relaxing.
"I have to say the same." Castiel croaked. Dean turned on his side to face Castiel and gave him a chaste kiss before groaning.
"You're lucky I think so, because those are awful table manners." Cas chuckled. Dean smirked at him before he looked in the bag once more. "Wanna fortune cookie?"
"You know what Sam, fuck you! You think I don't know that? Think I don't feel bad that I'm lying to the fucking love of my life?! All because I'm losing my goddamn mind and don't want him to know? I know it's not fair, but living like this isn't fair to me either. I cant be hurting Cas because I can't bring anything more to our relationship. Because I don't know when my next episode will be the one I snap. The one where I finally listen to all those creepy fuckers telling me to end it. End it all just so I know I'm real. And I can't be around Cas when that happens. So, yeah. Fuck you." Dean snapped.
"Thanks." He made some quick toast and a cup of coffee so he wouldn't be sick and could focus on reading today. Sam had his nose buried in a book, and when Dean walked past him, he ruffled the messy mop that Sam called hair.
Unlike the frantic performance that sex descends after a heated night together, much like at the motel, morning sex is deliciously unpretentious, relaxing and slow. And even though they're technically not having sex, it still feels like every nerve in his body is singing. With the dust of sleep still in his eyes, his back arching at the roll of Cas's hips and plush mouth on his neck, he was in bliss. Cas let out a contented and effortless giggle as he continued to toy with Dean, somehow reaching all the right places. The two of them writhed together under the sheets, grins on their faces along with the half hearted kisses and nips.
As he was hurling all the alcohol from last night up he remembered the bin by his bed as an afterthought. But he continued to dry heave into the toilet until he was done. He got to his feet on shaky legs and went to open the medicine cabinet. Barely opening his eyes he grabbed some aspirin and swallowed them dry. He rubbed at his eyes and grimaced down at his now dirty shirt.
"School." Dean lied. Castiel eyed him skeptically the kind of look that goes strait through Dean as if you say I know you before shrugging.
As he went downstairs to his post box he ran into Sam. Sam was covered in snow as he stepped into the building rubbing his hands together.
"How do I get the paper?" He asked trying to pull the little corner of the fortune that stuck out. Dean laughed and held up a finger. He pulled one of his own out of the bag and demonstrated snapping it in half before getting the paper. Cas followed in suite and frowning at his paper.
"Calm down, Dean. Look," he held up a little vile and Dean watched as the grace was extracted from Cas. Dean was in shock watching this happen. But once the vile was full, Death surprisingly, handed it right over to Dean. "Humans can't stay here. This is your ticket out. You're welcome." He scoffed.
"Look I don't have time to go out and find a piece of ass every other night okay? Sex is great but constantly finding a one night stand is... it's grating."
"Once..." he whispered hoarsely. Castiel nodded silently finishing off his drink and looking out at the bar. He leaned in closer to Deans ear.
"Don't do this, Cas." He couldn't get the words out it was all happening so fast. A sound emerged from behind him and Dean saw darkness warp through the wall. This was real, the empty was going to take him away. Castiel walked towards Dean and placed his hand on Deans shoulder. The one touch full of so much warmth in love. The touch that raised him from perdition. He had never felt so much love. As Castiels bright blue eyes, shimmering with tears looked into Deans, he knew he wanted to kiss him. Dean would be damned if he was going to let himself lose the man he loved because he was too scared. Yet he still couldn't move.
"You don't have to tell me how much of a moron I am, I get it." Dean said sitting down on the couch and Castiel followed.
"Sam asked if you were my boyfriend." Dean said randomly. Castiel smirked a little at him with a raised eyebrow.
"Oh cause you did so much heavy lifting." Sam smirked. Eileen signed "fuck you" and everyone laughed.
Dean however has been acting strange. A little jumpier than usual and sometimes he just stares off at nothing or behind Castiel like there's someone there. But strangest of all, when they are in bed together he just closes his eyes tight while they're moving together. Usually Dean watches Cas without abandon when they have sex. Watches every little shift and move and expression, and now it's like he's scared. So one night when they are cuddled up on the couch together, he decided to bring it up.
"I will buy your painting, pay for you to come down to my art show and you can even auction of more of your works there. I'll pay for the hotel, you could even bring your muse. What do you say?"
"I'll get it!" Sam called out. Dean set the pie down on the kitchen table before washing his hands in the sink. Gabriel and Castiel walked into the living room with smiles on their faces and Dean had to do a double take.
"Dean said he doesn't want to try anything new. He says they work for him, and maybe they do. It's just... frustrating."
"Thanks, Cas." He said finally. Castiel walked him to the door and Dean kissed him on the cheek goodbye before he left. Castiel felt a little sad once he was alone again but he needed to brush that feeling off. Fun time was over.
"Alex has work apparently and Jody says Claire and Kaya are going on a date tonight." Sam pursed his lips in a smile. Dean shrugged and and huffed a laugh.
Dean liked this part; getting to know Castiel. There was so much he still wanted to know about him so he figured he could start with a typical question.
"Come on. Let's go get ourselves some ass." Gabe winked taking his whiskey and walking over. Castiel rolled his eyes but followed none the less. He strode across the floor and took a seat close to the green eyed boy.
"I uh... I kind of stopped caring where comfort came from. I don't really like labels but if I had to call myself something I would probably say I'm bisexual."
"Dean, I never have the words to express how you make me feel. In an infinite universe with infinite possibilities, I met you. And although it is enough for me to exist with you in just this moment, I don't want to ever spend another moment without you. So what I'm saying is," Deans heart stopped as Cas got down on one knee in front of all these people. He pulled out a velvet black box and tears stung Deans eyes. "Dean Winchester, will you marry me?"
"Well, you always call me angel, and I actually think that, that's what you are to me. It's a little weird. I've never done biblically accurate angels before, but I thought you would make a perfect candidate."
Dean almost went a little crazy at the realization that his boyfriend was going to be wealthy. Cas was a painter. An artist. Throughout the show Dean waited as Cas had to stop and hand out autographs. His boyfriend was going to be famous. Which led those whispers to ask. Why is he with you? You can't even get a job. You're broken, why would he want you?
"Bedroom." Castiel said and a tingle erupted over Deans whole body, it wasn't a question or a suggestion that they move to the bedroom, it was a command. Normally being with women, Dean was in control, he took charge. Even with Lee, Dean was the one calling the shots. But Dean wasn't intimidated or afraid or even weirded out. He found himself nodding and following Castiel completely at his will and submission. Castiel turned around and pulled his turtleneck over his head exposing his back.
"Alright." Cas looked Gabe Dead in the eyes with a mischievous look before saying: "Never have I ever, been in a porno."
"Oh get your panties untwisted, I'm only teasing." Dean blushed when Cas shot him a look. "So, I'm not pushing. This is already more than I could ask for, but... you think maybe you could come and see me? Before I go?"
"In a sense. These," he said holding up the chains. "They will glow when he gets near." Without thinking Dean pulled on the long chains and dragged Death with him, ignoring the grunts and complainants he got. Once he found he was in a suitable place to try and bring Cas, he looked at the new Death and felt almost embarrassed. There's no way he could say everything he needed to in front of him. So in a desperate effort, he pulled the Walkman out of his jacket and handed it to him. He looked at the cassette and headphones in his hands and raised a skeptical eyebrow.
"There is nothing complicated in the way I love you." He said. And just like that, they were back to kissing. Castiel made work of taking off Deans own flannel and traced his hands up the bare flesh. Castiel touched That Spot on his shoulder and it felt as if the stars were dancing across his skin. Castiel got off of Deans lap and Dean almost groaned his disappointment before he saw Cas walking back towards the bed. Dean could get on board with that, so he stood up and took off his belt following Cas to the bed. The look in the angels eyes had Dean gasping in a breath and then he wrapped him in another kiss. The two of them fumbled for each other's pants, pawing to get them off, desperately  needed each other in this moment.
"Hey, what wrong?" He asked sitting down in front of Dean. Dean met his eyes as tears started to flow down and a piece of Castiels heart shattered. Dean collapsed into Cas's shoulder sobbing brokenly. Castiel instantly wrapped his arms around Dean and kissed his hair. Dean couldn't talk right now, so Cas wouldn't push. He would let Dean cry it out until he could catch his breath again. Castiel tried not to cry at the broken sounds and sobs coming from his lover. He tried to ignore the bitter stinging wetness on his neck and shoulder as Deans eyes flowed a river of so many untold things. Cas merely closed his eyes and stroked Deans hair and shushed him until he was just sniffling and shaking, able to breathe again.
"No I wouldn't have. Especially if I knew you were going to drown yourself in alcohol because of it."
"Not at all. But my muse brings it out of me. He was my first model for the angel painting. The one with the green eyes."
He woke a short time later to a tickling of kisses on his neck. He chuckled as he forced his eyes to open. Dean was smiling, green eyes glowing in the warm morning light. He leaned back down peppering kisses along Castiels neck and clavicle.
"Look, I don't normally do this, so don't question it and don't mention it ever again." He turned and held out his arms. Cas hesitantly leaned in for the hug and felt like his bones were being crushed when John hugged him back, slapping him on the shoulder. "You're a good man, son. Deans lucky to have you." John smiled softly.
Castiel climbed into the bed further all the way up to Dean to kiss him. Kissing Dean never gets tiring. His lips are soft and plump like velvet, they move like a wave on the ocean, pulling and encompassing all things loving. Dean is far more gentle than Cas is. He takes his time kissing. Slow and un rushed. Even now as he is naked in bed kissing Castiel, he's like a riptide on the beach carefully swaying Castiel in before being dragged in by the undertow. The other thing about Deans kisses is you can never tell where they start and where they end. They always remain so gentle when they finally become heated you're not even sure how much time has passed. It's nothing instantaneous. Nothing is fast with him. But the touches he has been giving Castiel these past few months are like nothing else Cas has ever felt. Even now as he slides his tongue into Castiels mouth, intrusive in its own right, it makes him feel treasured. Adored.
"You've also gotten much better at this." Cas gasped. Dean rolled his balls while toying with the head and just as he was about to finish Dean pulled off with an obscene pop.
"Well, I certainly am not opposed to that. There are other things I would like to try as well." Dean gulped and nodded as he kissed Castiels shoulder.
However tonight's date is supposed to be a walking date. They had made plans to walk the streets of Compiègne together. But of course Gabriel had to come over and nag him.
"Wanna close the door?" He asked and he heard Cas clear his throat at the click of the door. This part was a little more awkward than he anticipated. Still they had shared motel rooms before, so it wasn't like changing in front of each other was something wildly new, it just felt different now. Cas turned away as soon as Dean undid the button of his pants. Dean almost want d to protest and say it was okay to look, but he didn't. He threw on a pair of sweatpants and took off his shirt that smelled badly of BO.
"Oh really? What?" He said eyes gleaming. His eyes widened and he smirked when Dean started to take off his suit jacket and worked on his buttons. "Hon, this is a public event."
He sighed to himself before getting a rag and cleaning it up. Once all the glass was thrown in the trash, Sam came and mopped up the milk while Dean sat at the table trying to remember how to breathe. Hell, how to function like a normal human being.
"What are you talking about?" Castiel asked. He was standing in front of the body mirror, deciding which pants he should wear.
"See, that's why I like you. You're good to him. I'll tell ya, Deans had many girlfriends. None of them ever were willing to put up with him. You're good. I hope Dean stays with you when I'm gone. If not imma haunt the stupid son of a bitch for hurting you again."
An hour later, Cas's documentary was over and it went to some Family Guy episodes that Dean found funny. Though into the first episode, he found he couldn't focus on the show with their new position. Cas was practically sitting in his lap cuddling now. His head was pillowed on Deans shoulder and as Dean watched; Cas distracted him by nuzzling his nose into his ear.
"Don't apologize. We can- we can talk about it tomorrow. I just," he sniffled and mumbled into his shoulder. "I just missed you."
Castiels eyes were full of tears and there were gasps and whispers from the audience. Dean felt like he was crying like a baby when he nodded frantically.
"It was under consideration... I could never." Cas smiled and kissed Deans lips softly. The two of them laid back in the grass, staring up at the stars while Cas talked about the creation of them.
A moment later a flight attendant came up to them. She was a pretty blonde gal with brown eyes, he name tag read Joanna.
Tomorrow. I left a little brown box in the bottom of my closet. Tomorrow I want you to put it on and send me a picture.
"Sorry. But we just got rid of god, Lucifer, Michael, super mega hell and Billie. We don't need anyone else on our ass." Death sighed and looked at them with warning. "So you gonna help us or not?" Dean asked.
"I'm the bride?" He looked at both of them and they said: "Yes." At the exact same time. "Says the one wearing a dress!"
"I'd like that." Dean said and before he could retract that glimmering statement of hope, Castiel cursed under his breath.
"Well I should head out," Sam said standing up. "And Dean, just tell him. Tell him what you want out of the relationship." Sam whispered. Dean nodded as Sam headed for the door and walked out. As soon as the door closed Castiel crowded him against the counter. He was almost a little excited before he noticed the difference in his expression.
"I'll be there soon." He smiled. She sauntered down the hall and Sam smiled after her. Dean was truly happy for his brother. Just then Cas came up behind him and placed his hand on Deans lower back.
"Your not mad? Not gonna tell me I'm some fag? Not gonna tell me that being bi isn't a thing? That's it?"
He looked through the box and started to separate them and put them into order. It didn't take long reading the dates on the stamps, but once he finally did he knew he couldn't stall anymore. He opened the first letter.
The next couple of days, Dean took Cas around Lawrence and took him to meet his uncles Rufus, Bobby and his cousin Garth who Castiel was quite fond of. They invited them and Adam over to Johns house on their last night and had a barbecue in the back yard as the sun went down. They drank beers and talked and played beer pong. Castiel even offered if anyone wanted some weed to which, surprisingly, John wanted some as well. However when Adam wanted a hit John told him no sternly and he rolled his eyes before walking back over to Dean. John and Cas played puff puff pass for a while until Cas started to feel pleasantly clouded.
"That was because we weren't together then. We didn't mean that much to each other. Now we do and if you wanted to try it I would like that as well."
"What would you think if I wanted to get a tattoo?" Castiel head spun around and his eyes went wide.
There were eleven young adults in the class, Dean included who were graduating today. Instead of making them wear caps and gowns, they continued to wear their school uniforms as their Master Chef called their names and gave them each a chefs hat and wooden spoon with their names engraved. Castiel couldn't help but take a picture of Dean when he went up. He smiled widely as he shook his teachers hand and took a seat next to Cas. Castiel had never felt more prideful of anyone or anything. He kissed his cheek before waiting for the last of the students.
"I love you." He murmured. Everyone started awwing and Dean blushed, almost forgetting about everything and everyone for a second.
Eventually Castiels libido simmered down and he was back to cuddling Dean on the couch again. He doesn't know when exactly he dozed off but he was woken up by the screeching sound of bag pipes still coming from the television. When he looked down, Deans head was pillowed in his lap and he was drooling slightly with flushed cheeks. Castiel brushed the hair off his forehead, pulling the blanket off the back of the couch over them. He knew he would be still sleeping on the couch, but he didn't want to wake Dean. For the first time in years he cared about someone so much it almost hurt and he fell asleep with butterflies in his stomach thinking about it.
"What? I can't kiss the man I love?" Cas eyed him skeptically but kissed his cheek all the same before grabbing his hand. "C'mon, Sam made dinner."
"Yes, that sounds fine." Cas smiled. Dean thumbed open his phone and made the order for their dinner and in less than an hour, there food was delivered. Dean set up at the small table in the kitchenette, organizing both of their orders. Cas came and sat across from Dean and they ate in a peaceful silence. Castiel started laughing when Dean stuffed a whole egg roll in his mouth.
"Sammy my bipolar has been fine for years. I just stopped wasting money on meds so I could focus on school."
Kissing Inias was different than he remembered. At least this time he tried to participate and Inias seemed to like it just fine, but Castiel couldn't help but compare it to Deans kisses. Deans were always so gentle yet firm. The kind that makes you breathless even before it begins, but with Inias it was just... sad. Like giving someone a goodbye kiss and perhaps it was, after all this time. Still Inias was caught up enough to suggest they go back to Cas's place.
"Because maybe I want to think about you. While I'm gone I can't touch you so I'll have to opt for photos. You truly are beautiful, Dean. I don't tell you that enough."
"Well I don't know what you want from me! It's not like I have any objections to being official with him. But I- I don't think he wants that. He's confusing sometimes."
"God I need you." Dean whispered. Cas moved back and nodded to the bed which Dean easily laid back on. Cas made quick work of stripping his clothes not even bothering to fold them this time.
Castiel paused in his movements for a moment. He didn't know how to respond to that and he was afraid Gabriel was right. He sighed with a shake of his head before pulling his pants on. As he sat on the foot of his bed to pull his boots on, Gabriel sauntered into his closet.
Right behind Castiel was one of the faceless figures. Dean didn't know how it could watch them without eyes, but it was there. Staring and peering. Deans heart lurched into his throat and he clenched his eyes shut.
He laid back in his bed and closed his eyes. For a minute he allowed himself to believe in a happy ending for himself. And every variation of that involved Cas. He was on the brink of sleep when he felt a firm, warm hand on his shoulder. The touch was so familiar and so blindingly beautiful he shot up awake, but no one was there. He had the same dream again that night. Full of tears, happiness, pain, blood, love... and
"When Cas... when the empty first took him... he told me he loved me, Sam." Dean waited for a reaction, but there was none so he continued. "He told me he loved me and I just stood there. I didn't get to say it back. I just didn't think that'd be it. I didn't expect him to leave me," he took a shaky sigh. "And he left thinking I didn't feel the same way... but now he's back and- and I told him. I love him, Sam. And I was to afraid to admit it for years because of what dad beat into me, and everything he taught you. I just- I don't want this to ruin our relationship. Because I love him... and he's worth rebelling for."
"Okay so," Sam started to explain. "At first we deal everyone seven cards. Now whatever card is facing up, you either have to put down a card with the same color, or the same number. If you don't have either, then you pull from the deck. There are draw twos that you can place and make the next person draw, then there are wild cars to where you can make the next person play any color you want. And then there are draw fours..."
"Well, I think Gabriel is going to take your brother home. Do you want to get out of here as well?" Castiel whispered. When Dean turned his face to meet his, those green eyes burned through his soul and it took everything he had not to kiss Dean right then and there.
"I'm not going to object." Castiel laughed. Castiel nuzzled in, head pillowed on Deans chest warm and sated with post orgasmic bliss. Dean was gently stroking his hair with his fingers and was almost asleep before he spoke up.
"Dean, I-" Castiel started. There was a slight panic in his eyes mingled with guilt and it made something twist in Deans stomach. That he thought Dean would feel anything other than the same way he did. Dean tilted his chin up again, making those blue eyes stare strait into him.
"I don't know. I just figured that one, that's how we met. And two that, you just might want more after a while. You once described yourself as an hedonist."
"So have you heard from the family?" Cas asked reluctantly. They still talked to Gabe, but Castiel had a feeling if they knew he was with a man too, they wouldn't talk to him either. Gabe was the messenger, sending word about the family to Castiel whenever he heard anything and it had been a while.
"Don't 'sir' me," he chuckled. "I'm too old for that shit. So, Cas, what are your intentions with my son?"
"You can stay here. Wait for us and stay safe." Sam answered. She nodded hesitantly before Eileen walked over to her.
"I didn't really know who to talk to, since I can't tell Sam. Not yet at least. I figured you were the safest to talk to at the moment."
"The goal is to not have any cars and once you have one left in your hand, you yell UNO! If someone says it before you, you also have to draw four cards."
"Well, if your lover can inspire that kind of work out of you than surely you could make more. I'm talking eighty four thousand euros."
It took a minute for those words to kick in. And then he thought about what he had said to Cas earlier. Fuck he was an idiot.
"I'd threaten to come beat you up, but I think an even worse punishment would be knowing that Castiel would spend even more time thinking he did something wrong. Eventually convincing himself he deserves this, because that's who he is."
"You of all people should know that," Dean fixed Cas with a look that made the angel blush. He sighed at the menu but found something tolerable. "I think I'll do the chicken wrap with the uh, tomato things in it."
"I have hickeys all over my legs." He chuckled. Castiel smiled in sympathy before Dean pointed at him. "Looks like I gave you some as well." Castiel looked down at his body still dressed in the robe seeing no marks. Dean however came up and gently touched spots on his neck before leaning down and kissing each place on his neck.
"Words, Dean." Dean rolled his eyes and Cas only looked more sternly at him. Dean fumbled and reached into his nightstand pulling out a small bottle of lube they'd used a few times. He handed it to Cas, but the angel still looked at him waiting for a response. Damn him and the whole angel consent thing. Dean sucked in a sharp breath and glared harder.
"I'm just happy, Dean." He sniffled and he pulled Dean close wrapping him in a tight warm hug. It felt much more intimate than their other hugs where Castiel gave his all and Dean patted his back. This time, Dean nuzzled into the crook of his neck and breathed him in. Smelling lilac and rosemary. Like clean linens and spring rain. It was intoxicating, and Dean just allowed himself to be swept away by it.
The first thrust caused Dean to gasp out before he started to grind down filthy to take Castiel deeper. Dean likes sex rough and hard and often times fast, but Cas had no intention of that tonight. He ignored every little whine and whimper urging Castiel to go faster. He kept with just a smooth steady roll of his hips losing himself in the sensation that was Dean. Dean sucked on his neck hiding his face there and whimpering when Cas brushed his prostate. Castiel kept going for what felt like hours and might have been. Orgasm snuck up on him like the tide of the ocean, pulling him under in a graceful wave. His hips stuttered as he road out his orgasm and then Dean was clenching and fluttering around him.
Dean simply rolled his eyes as he left his flat. He walked out onto the street and shivered in the cold. He knew it was only a matter of time before it snowed. He got into the Impala and drove to Castiels place in the early, early morning.
He closed his eyes and tried to ignore it. He looked at the expression on Castiels face for a second and it was one of concern. One full of love and he couldn't help but wonder if Castiel, was actually real. He did seem a little bit too perfect.
It's the middle of the night on Sunday when Cas calls him. He jolts out of his sleep to answer his phone.
"We talk to Death. Get in there and save him." Cas answered very seriously. Sam nodded along while Cas and Dean basically planned out the whole route. Just as they were getting ready to head down to the basement, Eileen went up to Sam pulling him into a kiss.
"Do you want me to?" He asked. Dean nodded a little, ducking from his gaze. "Then I'll go with you."
Dean didn't want to say it. "When I'm under a lot of anxiety, like flying, it can make me act up. I don't want you to see me like that."
"You're next." She winked before turned back to everyone else. Dean looked at her in shock then back at Cas who waved and smiled at him, something akin to love and hope in his eyes.
"Yes. Shhh, keep it down. I don't know when I will actually ask Dean... but I would like to have his fathers blessing before he goes."
"You've got this." Sam whispered. Dean shot him a thankful smile before he got up and started walking through the library. At first it appeared to be empty, Dean began to fear they might not find a reaper in there. But then he heard the sound of whistling. The tune family, Oh Death. Dean turned into the row of shelves labeled C and found a reaper down at the end of the isle. He was reading a book before he slapped it closed and placed it back on the shelf, not looking at the hunter.
Castiel had done a light sketch of Dean last night when I was sprawled out in the sheets. That's why he kept looking at him. He was drawing him. The sketch is unmistakably Dean and if it wasn't the colors are a dead giveaway. Dean blushed too at the sight of an almost practically nude portrait of himself, but it was amazing. Castiel truly had a skill and the fact that Cas had used his talents to stay up at night and early morning to draw a sleepy Dean Winchester, was enduring.
"Dean, this time we're not going up against Godstiel or whatever, we're just using Death as a key. We'll make it work this time." Sam bargained.
Dean woke up pillowed on Cas's chest, warm and placating in the middle of the night. His breathing smooth and steady as the angel slept on. Dean didn't want to move, but his mind was racing.
"I wouldn't let you do it if I didn't like it. It's definitely different from topping, much more raw and sensual. But yes, I enjoy it."
Dean hadn't told Cas, but he stopped taking his meds. The whispers were still there but the shadows didn't come back. He felt fine for the most part, but he was more than anything, excited to give Castiel something he hadn't given him in weeks.
"Guess it never came up," Dean said and turned to Meg in hopes to change the subject. "Can I have a hit of that?" He asked and tried to ignore the skeptical look Castiel gave him.
"I want to know why the hell I have been the one getting calls from my baby brother sobbing for the past week. I want to know why the ever loving fuck, you think it's okay to up and leave like that."
"It makes so much sense." Jody said mouth gaping. "I mean, I always thought you were a bit... fruity."
Well, he knew in the moment he felt great. Dean hadn't ever felt that much pleasure in his life and the fact that he got that from Cas made it that much better. But they had known each other so long that now it was... really different.
"Yes. I don't think it's the meds, I mean it could be. But in truth, I don't even know if the meds are working. He still gets scared."
"Morning, Cas." Dean said. His voice sounded like gravel, hoarse from all the noise he made last night.
By the time they were both down to their boxers, they couldn't take their hands off of one another. Years of tension and build up, all the heartbreaks and death, it was just them. Dean couldn't even find himself to think twice about the fact that Cas was a man anymore. Because it just felt so damn right. The crawled on top of the covers together, Cas pressed underneath the weight of Deans body. His eyes were blown and wide, hands still roaming Deans bare skin. Dean trailed pepper like kisses along Castiels jaw and down to his neck. Nipping lightly along the angels pulse to see his reaction. Castiels whole body shuddered with the action, so he laved his tongue over the nip of his sharp teeth and sucked a mark there. He felt almost possessive and happy at the fact that Cas would be wearing a clear mark and reminder of what they had done for the next few days. Although, Dean doubted the angel would forget this, knowing he wouldn't.
His soft pale skin practically glowing in the early morning moonlight. His beautiful feather tattoos shifting as he breathes and twitches in his sleep. He softly tousled hair that feels like silk between Deans fingers. For a moment everything faded into the background and there was just Cas. He walked over to the other side of the bed to place a kiss on his temple before leaving the bedroom. As he was leaning up from the kiss though he bumped Castiels sketch pad off onto the floor. He winced afraid the noise would wake him but he simply rolled over. If the people upstairs weren't going to wake Cas neither was Dean. As an after thought he took Castiels pad with him as he quietly exited the bedroom.
Dean smiled proudly at him from the front of the croud. He looked amazing. He was wearing a long robins egg blue dress. That's right, his boyfriend was wearing a dress. And goddamn, if that wasn't the sexiest thing he'd ever seen. He also wore the trench coat Dean bought him and his hair was fabulously tousled as always. He dressed much fancier at this event than he had at some of the others in the past. But Dean wasn't complaining. Especially as Cas was on stage talking about him.
Dean mellowed to the sound of Cas's voice and felt himself grow heavier as he pillowed his head on Castiels chest. He yawned and tried to keep his eyes open, wanting nothing more than to listen to the whiskey like sound of the angels voice tell him poetry as he laid there. After a moment, Cas said another poem, easily washing away any and all thoughts other than the man embracing him.
"Well I'm gonna be cooking a dinner for me and Sammy and I'm pretty sure Gabe is coming too. If you wanted."
"Deal. Now take a shower you wreak like skunk." Castiel flipped him off as he opened the French door shutters to his bedroom and stepped into his fairly large bathroom. He took a quick shower while he assumed that Gabriel was probably raiding his pantry. Once he got out he tried to dress somewhat nice. He picked out a black turtleneck and paired it with some grid patterned dress pants. He took a look in the mirror and tried to tame his hair but to no avail before he just gave up. He threw on a leather coat and grabbed his keys and wallet before meeting Gabriel in the entryway.
Castiel kissed down Deans face to his chest, pausing to nip and lave over each one of Deans nipples until his back was arching into the touch. Dean likes a lot of teeth and a little roughness which Castiel is more than willing to give to him. Cas smiled as he kissed down Deans soft abdomen. Dean wasn't as firm in the middle as Cas was, Deans abs were far softer than Cas's own but Cas loved it. He nipped down his navel, ignoring his weeping hard cock and tossed both of Deans thighs over his shoulders. This was something he had only done twice, none of those times to Dean, but he wanted to give it a try. Without any preemptive warning, Cas licked the flat of his tongue over Deans hole causing it to flutter.
"Well, back when the murders started. It's been a few months, Cas. If I had to guess I'd say dehydration and or starvation based on his sunken eyes."
Sam's eyes were watery and Eileen was outright crying. She signed yes over and over and Sam smiled as he picked her up. He put the ring on her finger and pulled her into a kiss that had everyone cheering. Dean smiled at his brother and Eileen, extremely happy for them. When he turned to look at Cas, he had both a joyful and considering expression on his face. Everyone got up to congratulate Sam and Eileen, Cas included to where he was left at the table smiling, just with Jody. Dean was looking as Cas hugged Eileen and placed a hand on her stomach with a bright grin when Jody reached over. Deans attention snapped to her as she held his wrist and tilted her head in the direction of Cas.
To this day Dean has a divot on the back of his head from John bashing his skull. That was only the first time John tried to beat those thoughts out of Dean. It only happened two more times after that, but Dean learned his lesson.
Despite Deans complaints, Cas was actually a pretty good driver. What was unexpected, they dropped Sam and Eileen off at the bunker before Cas said there was something he needed to show Dean. Dean still looked curiously when Cas whispered something to Sam before they drove back off. Dean didn't know where exactly they were going, but Cas drove off to the side of the road and made Dean walk into a clearing of trees where the stars were visible through the groves.
Deans smile soon faded as he unlocked the door though. His brother Sam was sitting and crying on the couch cradling a box of tissues.
"Y'know you would be too." Dean blushed slightly and shrugged. Yeah, he wanted kids, but did Cas? And even still, they were both men. They'd have to make some serious money before they could either get a surrogate or adopt. But, yeah, Dean had thought about it. A lot. "Thank you, Dean. I'm gonna go check in on everyone."
"Relax. It's fine. Thank you for breakfast." Dean chuckled a little. Castiel sighed relief before sitting down on the couch and patting next to him for Dean to come sit. Dean sat next to him and for the first time since they met, there was an awkward silence. Castiel drank his coffee glancing nervously at Dean then at his cup until Dean spoke. He explained everything. Why he stopped taking the meds, why he lied about it. He explained the guilt he felt, and still feels about it. About his suicidal thoughts and the voices in his head that told him that the things he loved weren't real. The voices that told him about death. He talked about his mother and how she used to get scared for Dean. About the new medication he started taking and his self examination over the past week and a half to better himself. He talked about how he pushes away everyone he loves because he's afraid of hurting them worse somehow. But most importantly he just explained that he was so, so sorry. For everything.
"When us angels were naming the stars we said: this our present tragedy will eventually turn into myth. We were wrong. In the mist of that later telling the bell tolling now will be a symbol, or, at least a sign of something long since lost. This will be another one of those loose changes, the rearrangement of hearts, just fragments of old lives patched together, gathered into a dim constellation, a small consolation. And look," Cas pointed above where he sat up and Dean followed too as Cas moved behind him. "You can almost see the outline there. His fingertips touching his, the faint unison of two bodies breaking into the light."
Dean and Castiel got back from their vacation about two weeks ago and things have gone back to normal for the most part. Only now Cas is always inspired. He paints portraits of Dean mostly, but other things as well. He paints a chapel in Sicily with crows flying above in the grey sky. He paints the Eiffel Tower highlighted with rainbow sheens. He paints a tousled messy bed with legs tangled in the sheets and rain on the window outside. He paints the ocean and a broken sand dollar on the shore. Mostly he's painting things he wants with Dean. In their future, things he wants to do and see with him. And the paintings are some of his best. Dean has always been his muse and he can't believe he ever tried to deny that to himself.
Gabriel was right, Dean seemed like a really great guy. Not to mention he was built like Adonis. The man was a walking sex god, so yeah, he was excellent for tonight.
By now Dean has gotten used to the fact that Cas likes to paint him. Hell, he even posed for Castiel once. But this truly took his breath away. The painting is a headshot from the shoulders up of Dean. But instead of it being a normal portrait there are black wings sprouting from behind and multiple rings and halos that actually look like they are glowing adorned above his head. Dean would almost be freaked out by the large number of green eyes that were staring back at him, but the painting was to beautifully done.
He went about trying to have an overall normal morning. He made breakfast and coffee. He smiled when Eileen walked in sleepily and said that Sam was still sleeping. And then Dean decided he needed to go. He's not exactly sure what brought on his sudden need to leave, but it wasn't an urgent sad like it was the last time. He already had a destination in mind.
Dean was a bit nervous. There was at least two thousand people in the crowd and although most of them were LGBTQ affiliated, he was still nervous. He walked up the steps a shy smile on his face.
"It feels so weird to hear that as an adult?" Dean laughed kissing Cas softly. "It was fine. I got your mail."
Dean wandered into their small kitchenette where Sam handed him a letter. One look at where it was from and he tossed it back on to counter and sauntered towards his room.
"Cas, man you killing me." Dean panted a breathless chuckle as he closed his eyes. In the split moment he looked away from Castiel, his whole cock was suddenly enveloped by a soft, wet, velvety warmth. He let out a shuddering moan and looked to see Castiels perfect lips wrapped around him. Without warning, Castiel started sucking and bobbing like his life depended on it. One hand came up to Deans chest and gently nudged him to lay down. He did just that as he would do whatever Cas wanted him too. The hand returned to his hip and they both started massaging his hip bone all the while Castiels mouth tortured him in the best way possible. He had never been so vocal before but the way Castiels tongue moved around the head of his cock, the way it pressed into the slit, the soft graze of his teeth underneath his shaft was all to much. It was like nothing he'd ever felt before. The hands massaging his hips were strong and placating, working to relax his pelvis. The hands kept his hips still for a while and soon he felt Castiels nose brush his groin and when he looked down Castiels eyes were closed in concentration. He was all the way inside Castiels throat and he was using it to flutter around him. Dean could feel Castiel actually trying to swallow him down and that was all it took. He felt the hot burning coil in his stomach and groin build.
"Yes. Well, him and Pamela. They're good people. If that's something you're interested in, I will certainly talk with them about it."
I quit gambling. I know you probably don't care, and I don't deserve you to either. I just wanted to say I'm sorry for everything I put you and Sammy through. I'm trying to be better for Adam and Kate. And that starts with being better for you too. I hope schools going well, maybe you could come home for Fourth of July? I don't know. But I love ya and miss ya. Talk soon.
