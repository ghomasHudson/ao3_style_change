“You gotta start small,” says Sam. “No vamp nests. Maybe a low-power ghost, something like that.”
Cas shook his head again. “You’re a man of blind faith, Dean. And you call yourself a realist.”
“You hungry? I can make us something.”
“I don’t know, but I don’t like it. What if they’re, like, evolving or something?”
“No you’re not,” Dean says, and Cas chuckles.
him – so that was something.
Dean finally spoke, his voice straining with exhaustion. “Will someone let me out of here?”
“That’s right, you call her your sister. That makes it even weirder.”
“I wanted to believe it wasn’t you. But you looked at me like you hated me. I really thought you were going to…”
Dean finds the closet empty, aside from a few hangers and an electric space heater. He sets up the heater a safe distance from the bed, and turns it on.
The color drained from Dean’s face, but he kept his eyes shut. “Cas, he’s… he’s waking up.” The water crept up around the doorframe, now escaping from the gaps on either side as well as underneath.
Cas squints. “What are you saying?”
Although there wasn't any one thing that was the hardest, one of the hardest things was sleeping. Meditation was common among angels, but even its deepest states allowed for a shred of awareness that sleep could not provide. If one was meditating and sensed danger, the exercise could be broken fairly easily, whereas sleep was an entirely new level of vulnerability. Being unconscious was terrifying for Castiel. For the first few weeks, his mind fought sleep while his body craved it. Eventually, his body would win out for brief periods, and he would jerk awake, panicked, only to then remember that his grace was gone and that sleep would be the norm from then on.
talk to me about them.”
Jack was still eyeing the jar with trepidation. “Is that safe?” He looked up at Cas. “To give her grace, I mean.”
Cas nodded. “It’s been a long day.”
She looks relieved. Did she really think he would try to guilt her into staying? He gets up and hugs her goodbye, asks her to call when she gets there. She hugs Sam, too, then Jack (“Be good,” she says to him, and kisses him on the forehead). She hugs Cas last, and says something to him, too quiet for Dean to hear. Then she grabs her keys and goes up the stairs to the door.
As he hits send, he briefly worries that Sam might be reading Cas’ texts over his shoulder, but the feeling soon dissipates. Sam has known about them for months (and probably had a hunch long before that), and it’s not like Dean forgets, not really. The anxiety is just an automatic response when it comes to him and Cas. There were two years or so of active denial, followed by five years of avoidance. And even once things had categorically changed between them, there were still two additional years of sneaking around. So the desire to conceal, to omit, is instinctual after a near decade of practice. It’s muscle memory.
“Yeah, I feel pretty good, actually. Scrambled or over easy?”
“I’m the one that kissed you, remember?”
To Cas’ surprise, Dean didn’t appear to be finished. “And… if you were to fall again, and, you know, stay that way – stay human, I mean – you would still be the most important person to me, besides Sammy. That wouldn’t go away. So you don’t have to worry about that.”
During Dean’s sleep cycle, however, there were also moments when his breath would hitch and the veins in his neck would pulse, his hands twitching and clenching, anxious sounds escaping his lips. He was easily soothed with a hand stroking his forehead or pressed against his cheek, but Castiel knew that in the past, Dean had suffered through these moments alone. This knowledge broke him, and although he could not blame himself for the years before he knew Dean, there were plenty of nights cataloged in his mind when he had chosen to leave soon after Dean fell asleep. Even worse, there were those nights he spent absent from the Winchester’s life altogether.
“No, Cas, it’s okay. I just…” Dean shifted his position on the bed, turning to face him. “Once we got back here, I started to remember... When Michael had me the first time, before he locked me away completely, I was aware of what was happening. It was like I was running from him inside my own head, but he could control where I ended up. And sometimes I would end up inside bad memories, like hell, or losing Sam, or losing you. He would put me in those hallways, and no matter what door I picked it was something bad. But I just kept going, trying to get out. I think it was too much work for him. So when he possessed me again, he put me somewhere else, where I wouldn’t remember what was happening. I think when we got back to that hallway, when he started to wake up...”
Chuck laughed, hysteria dripping into his voice. “You know,” he said, “You’ve always been so easy to predict. It’s always Dean and his daddy issues ready to sacrifice himself for the world.” His voice slipped mockingly. “But that angel! You wouldn't have jackshit without Castiel and you can trust me on that one. I can never predict his bullshit.”
Chuck spun around in fury. “That fucking ANGEL!” He threw an arm out in front of him, and the entire Impala vanished into thin air.
Mary slipped out from under his arms fluidly, scraping the bacon off the griddle at lightning speed. She found Dean's eyes again, and smiled. “Ahhh, Dean and I both like it a little crispier, anyways. Ain’t that right, hon?”
“I get it.”
John looked at the floor. “How’d” his voice was just above a whisper. “How did you die, Dean?”
Mary looked close to tears. “Dean, baby, that’s not it. You died on a hunt. Accidents happen.”
. Dean. You didn't think that would work, did you?”
Bobby must be right. It made sense.
He had lived for his brother’s safety, for years. It was always about protecting Sammy. That’s why he stayed a loyal guardian in motel rooms, clutching shotgun shells and praying for gas stations without anti-theft cameras. Shit, he’d sold his soul for his brother.
There was any breakfast food he could ask for- scrambled eggs, egg mcmuffins, bacon, and french toast dominated one side of the table, the other piled high with pancakes and syrup and a small bowl of cut strawberries. Dean smiled a little as he sat down. It was diner food, he realized, all his favorites from the road, but homemade.
His head felt clear for the first time in days. Something was racing through his head at a million miles a minute.
And then, those opening notes played again.
, what had he done? He punched the dashboard and his knuckles felt nothing.
He loved family-run inns. He’d harass Dean for hours about the ethics of staying at a Motel 6 when there was a lovely BNB
“Fuckin’ finally!” Ellen shouted dramatically from the bar. “Honestly, I was starting to wonder if y’all were being a bunch of freeloaders.”
Dean stopped spinning. He was only about eight inches from the side of the cliff now. He paused for a moment. He closed his eyes, took a deep breath.
He remembered Cas’s love for mountain overlooks. Again and again on long haul trips to rural destinations, Cas would lean over from the backseat and ask to pull over and look out at the mountains and the trees and the light. Dean would watch the sunset reflect in Cas’s eyes, the golden glow enveloping the angel.
“What’s that?” The voice wasn't Sam’s anymore.
None of the landscapes here were exactly places on real earth, more like an amalgamation of the general Great American Outdoors. Dean imagined the view he got was most like the Rockies. The porch was perched on the slide of a sloping forest. At the bottom, a small creek carved its way through a sweet valley, and above it all stood the shapes of massive mountains, peaks lined with just the right amount of snow.
“For putting you through that.”
Jo was leaning into Dean, her arm around his shoulders. He didn't move her. “You’ve been holding out on us, Bobby!” She half-shouted with a grin. “We’ve been up here what? 10 years? And you’d never told that one.”
So naturally, Heaven was very strange, at first.
No. Heaven was new. Bobby said so. There’s always glitches in new programs. Little errors.
“It was ridiculous! And she's gettin’ closer and closer to lil Dean and she’s gotten him pinned on his hay bale and her eyes are glowin’ she's getting ready for all her lobotomy shit and he looks like he’s ready to piss himself and finally! I take the shot. It’s a perfect hit.”
Dean rolled his eyes. “That sounds mighty like a Kansas song.”
Dean felt tears welling up behind his eyelids. There was no feeling here. There was no gentle touch, no aura of love, no smell of pine and nutmeg. Cas hadn't done this. Cas hadn't been here.
Dean knew this story. “Four. He was four.”
Breakfast was an elaborate affair. Dean had never seen anything like it, not during the four years of his life before Mom died the first time, not during the 14 years when he followed his father after, and certainly not during the years hunting with Sam.
“I know I was a shit father to you, for a long ass time. I told myself I was doing the best I could, given the circumstances. Maybe in the beginning that was true. It stopped being true after a while.”
“You hit me.” Dean interjected. “It was not a perfect shot. It grazed my neck, I still have the scar.”
He slammed his hand into the steering wheel again. “And I can’t. Fucking remember.” He groaned. “I know I said I was a qu-.” He took a breath. “I know what I said but right after, I thought of something and I can’t get it. It’s like there's something blocking my brain from putting a goddamn thought together.”
“No shit, Bobby. Stop looking at me like I’m a child and make your point.” There was a familiar edge in his voice now. He hated hearing it.
The man is on the other side of the street, and Dean can’t afford to lose sight of him. He knows how these things works; if he were to lose him for only a second, he might probably never see him again.
He should have taken more seriously the idea of owning a sentient creature. He had fed him with food scraps sometimes. Now he felt almost ashamed by it.
And then he was kissing him.
“Cas?” he called. But he didn’t have to wait for an answer, for, when he entered the kitchen, a man with raven black hair stood at the counter, his back at him, busy pouring something in a frying pan. At least he was dressed now.
“I’m afraid it’s all real.” Cas’s voice seemed as concerned as Dean’s
"Why, does that make you feel bad? Where has your though exterior gone? Has New York softened you? I thought you didn't care about us after all. After nine years, one is left to wonder.."
He is distracted for a second, wiping his teary eyes with the back of his hand, when someone steps in front of him, and then arms envelopes him, strong and still familiars after years.
I don't work for free after all.
"Dean.. Dean, look at me." he says firmly. If Dean's thoughts are going that way, there is no time for softness. "Do you actually think I'm being held here against my will? I know I could go wherever I want, i just have to ask.  I'm staying here because you're my family, and I love you.
The first time Dean kissed Castiel, the world exploded.
And I should know it. I was there.
"Oh Cas.." It's the only thing Dean chokes out "You're right. I'm sorry I ruined our evening."
He feel a tear running down his neck and realize Cas is crying too, holding onto him for dear life.
This may sound absurd, I know it, but believe me, please.
Pride parade’s day is his favourite day of the year.
“You saved
No no no, this couldn’t be real. He should call the police, what was he waiting for?
Oh, of course, asshole, do you even listen what comes out of your mouth? He chides himself. Do something, damnit, don't leave him waiting!
“I had quite a reaction last night Cas, if you don’t remember. But I had time to think.
“I’d say that’s a great idea, angel. But let’s start with the easy part. I’m Dean.” He extends his hand, and the man takes it eagerly.
"I don't deserve your trust, Dean.
He got up from the bed and, after rummaging in one of his closets he came back, wrapping him in a soft blanket, then sitting again in his previous position.
life, Dean. You saved it that first day, and you keep on doing that every day.
"Well then. Let's go find it and kill the bastard.
“No, I’m here with a couple of friends. They’re here somewhere throwing glitter at the heteros probably” he chuckles, but his smile soon turns mischievous “Why, are you planning of getting rid of me already, angel?”
And then the spell was broken. Dean blinked, watched Cas right in his eyes for a second, and, with his good arm, grapped the angel's shirt and yanked him towards his chest.
"I'll.. thank you?.. Oh my.. Oh my god. You've convinced Dean! Is he really gonna tell Cas? How did you do it? I've been trying for years without results! Scoot over, I want to see too!
Bright blue eyes, soft, full lips, curly dark hair and a pair of fluffy wings hanging on his shoulders.
"You coming later? They're throwing a little party to thank everyone." Dean whispers to the boy standing beside him, who doens't even flinch at the sudden voice.
He was gone from that moment.
When I dared exit my shelter, the room was silent
Like it doesn't mean anything.
Without waiting for an answer, the man dropped the sheet and closed his eyes.
He jumped in a pair of sweatpants and descended the stairs, sniffing a sweet smell in the air.
Dean was silent for a moment, replaying the words Benny had just said in his head.
"Castiel!" He shouts, but he doesn't get any answer.
"You have every right to be skeptic Dean, I shouldn't be here, and, truth is, I don't know why I am here.
then something happened, they changed, and now they're seeing each other just because an accident happened, and they couldn't miss their friend's funeral.
Except that now everything seemed different.
"Well Sam, if you don't mind, i'd like to stick around here for a bit, before i sort things out, and I think you have bedrooms for an army in here, but mainly, I want to see the two lovebirds faces tomorrow morning when they'll decide to join us again."
“Leave? No! No Cas, I would never ask you to leave..
“OH CAN YOU NOW? GET OUT OF MY BED YOU FREAK, HOW DO YOU KNOW MY NAME?”
Dean stood there, completely dumbstruck, mouth wide open, until, a couple of seconds later, his very own cat, Cas, jumped on the bed with a meow.
"I can't imagine how she could have lied to me when she told me."
“Apparently he wasn’t happy of a work I had done for him, and decided to settle the score. You stepped in in the right moment.”
Maybe his mother was right. Maybe Dean really has an angel watching over him.
“Dean please, you need to calm down. I can explain.”
Or, at least, in this moment it feels like it.
He put some flyers around just to make sure he wasn’t stealing someone else’s cat, but when no one contacted him, he secretly breathed a sigh of relief. He had in fact grown quite fond of him during this little time, and he would have been distraught to give him away to his real owners.
"Alright, I got it brother, your life sucks as always, but someting good must have happend during all this time. What about your boyfriend, you still with him?"
And that's the story that led me here, at three in the morning, to sweep the floor off all these glass shards, with a helmet lamp secured upon my head, the only light in the dark like a beacon in the night.
“I’m sorry you had to find out like this. I’m always really careful, and you always sleep like a hibernating bear, I never thought you would wake up. “
Idiot, idiot, idiot. Not this time again.
"Alright! Alright! I got it angel! If I fall asleep here not even one of your japanese massages will make me walk tomorrow."
“You’re confused, I know it. But I can explain. Well, I had hoped this would have happened in another situation, but we’ll have to roll with it now I guess.
Dean nodded, but he already knew the answer.
“Oh, Cas, what the hell is going on here?”
The blush on Cas’s cheeks deepened. He now was deep red.
I know your name because I know you very well.
The resemblance is too big to be considered a coincidence. Does the universe plays matchmaker now?
His grip is firm while they shake hands, but then, instead of letting go, Castiel just turn his wrist and lowers their hands down, intertwining their fingers together with a soft smile gracing his face.
He hugged tightly Dean instead, whispering all his amazement to him, and Dean held him tight as well, nose buried in his soft hair, murmuring sweet nothing and placing light kisses on his head.
He choked on a sob, unable to say anything else.
"You try spending one year with a man that only seem to talk about his angel; how he needs to find that angel, how much he miss that angel, how he would rather die than leave without him. How does it sounds Dean Winchester? Certainly not a walk in a field of flowers for me!"
"Cas, what- what happened? What is this smell?" I asked unable to stop myself, since my stomach was already growling like a bear.
"So you're telling me" he got up from the chair "that you" grabbed the knife from the middle of the table, "made me walk for miles and miles, for an entire year" rounded the table to come near to Dean "when we could have left after a couple of weeks" he lifted the knike, pointing it right to the man's chest "just because you couldn't leave without your oh so platonic "BRO"?"
You should join us sometimes, it's fun."
“Nugget? Black? Robert?”
This time, Castiel seems surprized by the voice.
"Put down that knife! What the fuck is going on here?"
“Yeah baby” Dean laughed at the cat’s sudden burst of affection “I knew you’d like it.
I'm no demon nor shapeshifter Dean, it's just me. Though I hope you won't try to find out if i'm a vampire, cause that would be just awkward."
So long for making plans. Before Jody's call, we were just waiting for Cas to have a movie night together.
The music slowly creeps back into their ears, and their surrounding is perceivable again. Castiel face is still smitten, and they are so near to each other now they could almost hear their fast heartbeats if there were a little more silence.
The man weights the answer for a second
To him, Cas brought all this.
You’re the only family I have, Dean.”
“Yes! Sorry! Since the secret’s out I thought I could at least help you with something.
I’m not a thief, you have to trust me.
“Oh, baby” Dean cradled the man’s face in his hands, wiping away the tears with his thumbs “why has life treated you so badly?”
Dean and Cas had lived together for one year now. And it had been a wonderful year.
Dean can't keep the bitter remark for himself.
Did he make him cry? he doesn't know. He doesn't care. He'll probably never see him again anyway. He could die right now in this place for all he cared.
I never bothered to dress cause I always shift before you wake up, and I need to be naked to do it anyway. And I would have to steal something from your wardrobe to do it.
The cat eyed him expectantly.
All is quiet for some minutes, but Cas can still sense the tensness in Dean's shoulders, and the shuddered breaths he takes, as if opening his mouth to say something, but thinking against it the very same moment.
"Cas?" Dean yelled while going down the stairs
Dean is having a good day.
It's eventually Castiel who breaks the stillness, scooting closer to Dean and placing his head on Dean's shoulder. Immediately, Dean's arm finds its place around the angel's waist and, after a brief hesitation, he turn a little his head to leave a trail of soft kisses on Castiel's forehead. This has become a once-in-a-lifetime occurrency by now. Dean putting aside the mask of emotionless, firm leader, and allowing Cas to see his true self, the one he never dares to show anyone else beside the angel; the caring, passionate man, with a heart crushed under the weight of every awful thing he's been through. and Cas intend to enjoy every moment of it, until life dawn again on their fragile bubble of serenity and they are forced to leave and face another day, fight another battle.
he had said one afternoon while they were lying in bed, almost nonchalantly, like it wasn't a big deal.
"My.. boyfriend? Who?"
If a facial expression could say “are you fucking kidding me?”, the one the cat was giving Dean now was definitely the perfect example.
When Dean woke up the following morning, he was alone in bed. Weird. Cas always waited for him before heading downstairs.
But for now there is only one thought running up and down his head, while walking hand in hand with this beautiful man.
"Dean! Sam! You're here!"
His head would start to spin if he kept on thinking at the absurdity of the situation.
After a brief visit, the vet reassured him; the cat was dehydrated, and he had lost a lot of blood consequently a deep cut below his rear leg, but with some intensive cures, he would be out of danger.
“You know, Castiel? You have no idea how sexy a trenchcoat can be.”
No you dumbass, I'm on earth, alive and kicking." His thick accent emphasizing the sarcasm.
Dean almost choched on the beer he was drinking. "Cas?! What the hell are you talking about buddy? He's not.. he's not my boyfriend! He never was!" he stuttered.
Rage boiled now down Dean’s veins
Yet, he would recognize him anywhere. There is no way to forget the man which face is printed on the back of your eyes, vivid like a mark.
"What kind of idiots are you two? Even a kid can see the heart eyes you make at each other. Do I really need to come back from the dead to stick your head out of your ass?"
Jody had called three days earlier with an emergency: the girls had tracked down a ghoul all the way to Illinois, but, once there, they discovered the ghoul wasn't alone; there were three of them. Catching them off guard, they had captured Claire and Donna, so Jody was left alone with nothing else to do but to call for help. Needless to say, we were out of the bunker the moment she called.
And once out, true to his words, he gripped Cas’ hand and never let it go.
While he speaks, Dean unconciously thightens his arms around Castiel's figure, and his forehead drops on top of soft black curls.
Castiel it is then. Now you’re officially my flatmate.”
It's only when they are both in bed that Castiel hugs him and says "Oh, baby, I'm not going anywhere till the end."
So, he kept on living alone in his big house.
The phone rang a couple of times before Dean could pick it up, busy searching for informations through the lore in the bunker's archives, about this south american pagan god which was currently terrifying a little town in Ohio, slaughtering people as ritual sacrifices.
"Brother, why do you think he keeps coming back? It's not like he's getting paid. Don't you think he keeps coming back to you because he likes being with you?
And Dean now has a boyfriend who wan cook for him anytime.
It's been eight years since he left, and it almost feels like he's seeing a ghost.
Castiel even goes as far as pulling his phone out to do what looks like wanting to exchange numbers, only to hastly change idea and put it back in his pocket.
Slowly, as if trying not to startle him, he raise his hands, placing one on the big handprind he left there so man years ago, and the other on his chest, pushing himself up just enough to watch the man in the eyes.
Rather, what have you done to him? He always sleeps with me. If you’ve hurt him I swear to god I’m going to kill you.”
“Dude!” she screams, slapping him on the arm
"Dean? Cas?"
The vampire's eyes then moved to Sam's left, where Castiel was standing, and with a laugh he exclamed "There he is our little ray of sunshine! What a coincidence, me and your.. friend over here, were just talking about you!
"Oh yeah; I was so lucky I found a phone here on the ground and I thought, why not call someone upstairs, see how they're doing?
wanted to be the one to show Dean just how much love he deserved. And though he never thought he would admit it, there was lust. When his handprint on the hunter’s shoulder had healed, Cas had been more than a little disappointed. His mind often wandered when Dean removed his jacket, eyes fixed on the point where his shoulder met his neck, thinking of another type of mark he would leave on him if he ever got the chance.
“No, I didn’t know that,” Cas says with a small smile.
When they have no plans for the day, Cas likes to keep him in bed as long as possible, and isn’t afraid to tempt Dean with a nip to his earlobe or a slow, lazy grind against his ass. Not that he needs much tempting. Dean can’t help feeling mortified at the needy sounds Cas can pull from him, the sighs and gasps and moans. But in these moments Cas always looks at him with an expression of untempered devotion, and under his hands Dean has learned to let go.
Cas was confused by Dean’s startled expression. “
Jack seemed unconvinced. “What about Michael?” he said, jerking his head toward Dean. “Take some from him.”
“I need a beer,” Dean said. “Or ten beers. Let’s talk in the kitchen.”
“You’d better not use that word in front of Dean,” Sam said.
serious.
Castiel’s bond with Dean gave him access to certain aspects of the hunter’s mind, a side effect he had discovered recently. He knew it was wrong to read Dean’s memories, especially without his knowledge, and only did so to fill in gaps in his own memory. He learned the details of the moments he lost when the Leviathan controlled his vessel, as well as the time he spent with his memory erased, living as Emmanuel. Unfortunately, it was impossible to gain this factual information without also taking in Dean’s emotional responses. Dean had experienced distress when the Leviathans had taken over Castiel’s vessel, but it was nothing compared to the agony he suffered when Castiel did not remember him. It was something Castiel knew he could not put him through again.
, exactly. It’s just that Cas acts so human sometimes.
“If you do find something,” says Cas, “please do not attempt it until we get back.”
“Yes, I’m sure.”
“What, ‘date’?”
“What? No. I don’t know.”
To my surprise, he smirks and shakes his head. “Why?”
“Well, I’ve certainly done a good job of that,” Cas replied, and smiled wider.
Forty minutes later, Rowena arrived, and Sam went up to let her in.
“Alright, Cas,” Dean says. “I’ll adopt your adopted daughter. But nothing’s going to happen to you.”
“You’re… You’re my everything too, Cas. I mean, you and Sammy. So if you had that dream because you thought I’d go looking for something else, it’s not gonna happen. For the first time in a long time, I feel like… I’m not really missing anything. I know I got a lot of shit buried deep down, and I can’t expect anything to fix that. But if there’s anything that could, it’s you.”
“Yes.”
“Yeah, well, I’m sorry if this shatters your worldview, but people aren’t completely defenseless without you, you know.”
“Well, it’s weird that she’s your sister and she’s all in love with you or whatever,” he says. He hopes he’s imagining the slight quiver in his own voice.
Sam remained expressionless. His jaw locked.
“Yes, Nick knew. I think perhaps his death might have involved foul play after all.”
“Of course I do, Cas. You know that.”
Comments are always appreciated! You can find me on tumblr at wingsdestiel.
Cas blinked back his tears and cleared his throat, obviously trying to hold it together. “I’ve never been so… attached to anyone. Before I chose free will, I don’t think I had attachments at all. There were things I was fond of, sure – humanity, for one – but if I had been asked to let go of those things, it wouldn’t have occurred to me to fight for them. Now… I am attached to you, and though it feels right in many ways, it hurts as well. It scares me, Dean, because I have never lost something so important as you, and if I did, I’m not sure I would survive it.”
The drive to Lincoln was filled with pleasant tension, and Dean wasn’t sure if it was from being on a hunt again, or from being in a confined space with Cas for so long. Maybe it was a little of both. Either way, it had Dean’s blood buzzing. Unlike Sam, Cas didn’t protest when Dean turned the music up loud and sang along – he even smiled. There was no judgment in it, just genuine contentment from seeing Dean so relaxed and happy. It was a miracle for both of them.
"That's not what I – Wait. You're fucking with me, aren't you."
Protecting Dean was not a whim. Cas felt as though the very fabric of reality would unravel if anything happened to him. Well, anything
“Ok, but we’re taking the car,” Dean says.
“He said you haven’t gone anywhere for yourself in years.”
“Yeah,” Dean agrees, and looks at his brother sternly. “No spells, no experiments.”
Dean sighed. “Cas, it’s not about you. Sammy’s just a pain in the ass sometimes, you know?”
Dean nods, and a cold sensation washes over him, spreading outward from Cas’ fingertips. His heart rate picks up — he’s not totally used to it, the unnerving feeling of grace surging through every cell in his body. It feels so foreign, so unnatural, and triggers his adrenaline regardless of how much he trusts Cas and how many times he’s experienced it. When the sensation subsides, however, he feels calm and clean.
“Sammy, even if we finish this, there are still a million other creepy sons of bitches out there. Wendigos. Rugarus. Vampires. Are we just supposed to let them walk?”
“Alright. But shouldn’t we be doing something besides just waiting? Don’t you usually speak with the victims’ loved ones?”
“Yes,” she said. “That’s where they would go every weekend. It was their guys’ night or whatever.”
The words stung, and Dean had to focus to drown his anger. “My past has nothing to do with this,” he growled. “Besides, unless I missed the memo on some weirdo angel customs, it’s not like we’re getting married.”
“What’s up?” Dean asks. “You just miss me? Or is Sam boring you to tears?”
Dean broke his insolent glare and looked down, but the indignation remained clear in his expression.
Dean’s breath hitches. He’s the one that started the flirting just now, but it still surprises him how easily Cas can turn it back on him. He used to think of himself as a master of seduction, but Cas can disarm him without even trying. “I mean… if that’s what you want.”
“Based on the fact that nothing seemed out of the ordinary at her apartment, I don’t think we were on high alert yesterday. Perhaps we should have been.”
“Yeah, maybe. I figure it’s close enough, we might as well go check it out.”
“And what do we do once we find it?”
French doors off the bedroom allow for a better view of the lake than the one they had from the car. The water is a deep blue-green, with glints of white and gold from the reflection of the sun, which has begun to dip low in the sky. Dean follows Cas out the doors and onto a deck, where stairs lead down to the wooden dock that stretches about thirty feet onto the water. A light breeze sends a sweep of goosebumps down Dean’s arms, despite the layers he’s wearing. It will probably be dark — and much colder — in less than an hour. Cas stops at the railing and looks out across the lake, his expression serene, and Dean joins him. They stand there silently for a moment, just appreciating the view.
“Well, your mind reading comes in handy,” Dean said. “Maybe you should use it more often.”
Cas took out his angel blade and rolled up his sleeves. He handed the vial to Sam, who, without instruction, held it up against Cas’ forearm as he made a shallow cut. Rowena watched, and said, “That will do,” when the vial was half full. Sam capped it and handed it back to her while Cas waved a hand over the wound, sealing it off. He felt a brief wave of exhaustion pass over him, but did his best to maintain a neutral expression.
“Well,” Sam said, grinning. “Like I said, you have an admirer.”
Sam spends most of his free time in the bunker’s library and archives, helping other hunters via phone and email with research on particularly difficult cases. He’s revamped the Men of Letters index system, and needs only consult a massive spreadsheet to find cross-referenced material for any given question a hunter might have. As an older brother, Dean really wants to be embarrassed by this level of nerdiness, but he’s mostly impressed. Besides, it seems to be fulfilling for Sam in a way that hunting itself never was.
Dean’s heart sank. He never liked it went Cas disappeared, but this was a particularly shitty time for him to bail. He could have at least said where he was going.
This was one of the many places he would often go to be alone. He also frequented an abandoned temple in Cambodia and a mountaintop in Argentina, but today he wanted to stay closer to the bunker in case Dean or Sam called him back. The difference in flying time would be miniscule, just a fraction of a millisecond, but Castiel had an uneasiness turning in his stomach that kept him close to Kansas for the time being.
Dean shook his head and smiled vindictively. “This is stupid. I don’t have to put up with this from you. Get off your high horse and admit that you’re just tired of cleaning up me and Sam’s messes, so you’re punishing us while you do it.”
“You don’t look a day over thirty-five,” Mary says, and pats Cas on the arm.
“Charlie, don’t –”
A smirk flashed across Charlie’s face.
“Oh,” Dean says, but his brows are still furrowed. He turns off the music and sits down on a stool, like he’s bracing himself for bad news.
“Nothing, I guess I just forget that you don’t feel like you’re babysitting me anymore. Sometimes I find it hard to believe that you actually want to be here. That you’re not bored out of your mind.”
“Michael?” Dean said, alarmed. “He’s in the cage.”
Dean grips the wheel a bit harder. “’Course. Anything.”
“Yeah, well,” Dean says. “I’m still not giving you a whole bottle of pain meds.”
“How?”
book – “he didn’t really give you much of a choice. So my point is, you’re allowed to want things for yourself. And when you tell other people they’re allowed to want things, too, that’s not a bad thing. Dean might get grumpy about it, but he’s always grumpy.”
“I’ve done research. I didn’t know how fast our relationship would be moving, but I wanted to be prepared. So I used the internet to further educate myself about human sexuality.”
” Dean sounded like a child who had just lost a board game.
“Okay, you can lie if you want, but I’m going to pretend that you just said yes.” Sam ignored Dean’s look of contempt. “I know it’s complicated, because he’s an angel, but there’s nobody in this world more stubborn than you two, so I’m sure you can work something out.”
“Don’t you have an internal alarm clock or something?”
Claire rolls her eyes. Dean’s always so defensive of his precious angel. Now if only he would admit to himself that there’s something distinctly non-platonic about it.
When dawn began to break, a pale blue bleeding across the sky, Dean stirred in his sleep. Castiel pressed two fingers to Dean’s forehead, and his breathing slowed again. He deserved a little more sleep. He deserved more than he knew.
“I have sigils carved into my ribs!” He gestured at his torso.
Sam groaned.
“I had a nightmare,” I admit, and take a bite of my sandwich. “I didn’t want to wake you up.”
Sam was quiet for a long time. When he spoke again, his voice was low and careful, but Dean recognized anger simmering under the surface.
“I’m in the bunker? With you, and Sam, and Jack? But Michael – ”
“Okay. Did Dean give you the address?”
“Exactly. And let me tell you, it’s not like I lived through all of that by choice, either. I just had to keep going, you know? I had people depending on me. Like you, and Sammy. And the rest of the world, I guess. It’s not like I got through it out of bravery, or strength, or anything like that. I got through it because I had to. And you’d do the same thing.”
“I can try,” he said, but imagining the texture of something solid in his mouth made his stomach lurch. “Charlie, I’m sorry, you really didn’t have to do this.”
“Yep. You?” Dean sat down at the table.
Cas hesitates. “There may be occasional… sleeping… happening.”
. Just
Cas tried and failed to suppress a smile at Dean’s quip. He put his hand on Dean’s, but didn’t thread their fingers together, despite his overwhelming desire to do so. He had to leave, remove himself from the temptation. “I should go,” he said. “I’ll let you get some more rest.”
“That is, of course, if you’d be willing.”
“You’re gonna get better, Sam,” she said.
That was something.
“What – Oh.”
“The internet. Sam showed me Airbnb.”
Still, I served heaven to the best of my ability. There was something almost honorable in my stillness, perhaps a sense of pride for containing the strange and blasphemous urges to which I have always been susceptible; for millennia I wanted nothing more than to wring out the grief from the world, and for millennia I watched with carefully forged stoicism, aware that my compassion exceeded that which was acceptable for my kind. I learned early on in my existence that I was flawed, and when I could not change it, I found ways to hide it.
“Where is he?” Jack said. “Dead?”
“Hey there,” Dean said, trying for a tone that was both businesslike and friendly. “Why are you tailing us?”
“Besides, I think Dean let Kevin go because he reminds him of you. I think he knows you see a younger version of yourself when you look at Kevin, and this is his way of apologizing to you. For not giving you a choice. Even if he still thinks it was the right thing. Even if you both do.”
Dean’s frown intensified as something else seemed to catch his eye. He slowly moved to the other side of the table, apparently terrified of whatever he was approaching. When Sam saw what it was Dean was looking at, he had to bite his tongue to prevent himself from laughing.
“Well, this wouldn’t be the first time a spirit could travel beyond where it’s tied to. Especially if it has some personal connection to the victims, it could probably hitch a ride with them.”
Cas worked mechanically, first carrying Dean down the stairs and through the winding corridors to the dungeon. He half-kicked a chair into the center of the room, and placed Dean down in it. Dean’s shoulders slumped, so Cas leaned him back, letting his head fall forward to his chest. Next, Cas checked that the handcuffs were still secure. He was half waiting for the other shoe to drop, for the handcuffs to melt off Dean’s wrists like butter, giving way to Michael’s disdainful laugh. But still they held.
“Dean.” It was probably intended to be a plea, but it came out more like an accusation.
“Fancy word for flower,” Sam explained before Dean could ask.
Sam smiled sheepishly and put his gun down. “Well, I’m not dead. I’m feeling much better, actually. Almost at 100 percent.”
When they pull onto the highway, it’s like Dean can finally breathe. He never would’ve realized on his own just how much he needed to get away with Cas for a while. The bunker is home (and he’s glad to have it), but it can get a little claustrophobic, and not just because it’s underground. Maybe it’s because he’s so used to constantly being on the move, but waking up in the same room every day feels almost depressing sometimes.
Heaven, human's section of heaven rather, hadn't seemed terrible when Dean had visited there before, but Jack had made some improvements and it was even better now. It was wonderful to see everyone he'd been close with and lost. To have a beer with Bobby, to drive Baby aimlessly, and to just
"Breakfast in bed?" Cas grinned as he hopped onto the bed, "you are the absolute best boyfriend, thank you," he gave Dean a lingering kiss as he took the tray and enthusiastically began eating. Dean had brought in his own plate of food and easily devoured it before Cas had finished his.
“I know,” Sam said, forcing some reassurance into his voice. “It’s just that Dean doesn’t care about intentions as much as he cares about the outcome. Sometimes an apology just doesn’t cut it.”
“And you can’t just un-hex it?”
"No, I just meant you have to learn everything really fast."
“They were?” Dean was surprised to hear someone be so candid. Usually the person he interviewed would have a speech prepared about how normal and nice the victim was, a real Pillar of the Community.
watch it tonight,” Charlie said as she helped Sam clear away the empty beer bottles. On his way out of the room, Sam gave Dean a pat on the shoulder that seemed to be both an apology and a thank you. “G’night, nerds,” Dean called after them.
“Dean, would you sit down, please?” Sam finally said.
“Dude,” Dean says. “We’re literally in the kitchen. You could’ve just walked over to the fridge and – ”
Cas narrows his eyes. “…specifically because you thought she and I might have had feelings for one another.”
“And you’re really okay with that?”
Cas tries to smile in appreciation of Sam’s support, but he’s not sure if he’s successful. He stands there for a moment, staring off into space until Sam shoos him away, saying, “Go, go.”
Dean turned around and smiled, looking genuinely happy to see him. He didn’t seem to question Cas’ arrival. Cas knew this theoretically could be Michael, but his instinct said it was the real Dean. He let go of his weapon and walked to the middle of the clearing.
Despite Sam’s protests, Charlie made him lean on her shoulder and helped to walk him back to bed. Once he was lying down, she brought him a glass of water and started bugging him about food.
“Because when Nick died, his parents tried for months to get the police to keep investigating. They didn’t believe it was an accident. They thought maybe…” She shook her head, like she was shaking away a bad thought. “The police wrapped everything up pretty quick, and never looked back. Why would they suddenly be interested now?”
Cas lowers his voice, even though the garage is on the other side of the bunker. “I don’t know. Originally I wanted to wait a while, but just having the ring is making me impatient.”
Cas shook his head. “Give him a few hours, at least. Sam will take good care of him.”
“She did great. I think she’d make a good hunter.”
“Don’t worry. I’m not gonna make a run for it,” she says while trying to ignore her cramps. They’re always worst in the beginning.
Sam sat down and swallowed hard to kill the cough that was aching to rip through him. Coughing up blood would give Dean an excuse to change the subject. He cleared his throat, ignoring the searing pain in his tonsils. “I’ll make this quick,” he promised. “I know that what Cas did was pretty unforgivable, but you need to put it aside, at least for now. We have a situation on our hands”–
“It’s no big deal,” Dean says. “If she’s miserable, I don’t want her having to drive around.”
Dean seemed genuinely surprised, which Castiel supposed was reasonable. He had rarely seen him cry, and even then, it was never like this. Never like a child, never out of fear and hopelessness. Dean's demeanor changed instantly, shifting towards something Castiel had only caught glimpses of before, and only when he was interacting with his brother. His facial expression softened, and if there had been any trace of annoyance at being woken up again, it was gone now, replaced by empathy and concentration.
“Yes.”
“Alright, well I can be done in a few minutes here, so you could go run us a hot shower if you want, and I’ll catch up.” He quirks his eyebrow in that positively sinful way, and Cas almost takes his suggestion.
The look on Castiel's face was so tender it almost broke Dean's heart, he took the angel's face in his hands and finally kissed Castiel; the one he loved.
"It's a ring," Dean quickly blurted out and avoided looking to the front of the car; he wished he'd gotten an uber.
Dean slowed down and pressed one last kiss to Castiel's lips, "Of course babe, I'm pretty tired too, I was just so excited to see you, you know…"
"None of the nitty gritty stuff, don't worry. Just enough that there is no doubt in my mind that he would ever say no to marrying you," Sam assured him.
The movie ended just as the plane began it's decent. Dean put his shoes back on and sat up a little straighter; he was glad to be almost home. It wasn't that he didn't like his job, even though he preferred to be working on cars, rather than selling them, but he knew his job and did it well. He just hated being away from Cas for so long; he could be a bit needy sometimes, so sue him. His job could be really stressful and Cas grounded him; they were perfect for each other and Dean wanted to give him everything. Every time Dean had to go away he always came back with a gift for Cas; whether it was something bee related to add to his collection (don't even ask) or a new piece of lingerie for them to try out. This time was something very special indeed, and Dean was super excited and nervous to give it to Cas.
," Dean immediately got defensive.
"You're going to propose to me?" Sam asked in disbelief.
Dean eagerly unclipped his belt and jumped out of the car, then he stuck his head back inside, "Thanks for the lift guys, really appreciate it. I'll see you Friday night for family dinner."
"If Dean wasn't in the car, I'd make you pull over right now," Sam told him promisingly, as he leant in to kiss Gabe's cheek.
Pining was something he would never admit to, but yeah, he had pined over Castiel for years. He was jealous of Meg, and more than a little upset that Cas lost his virginity to someone that wasn't Dean. He hid it all though, or at least thought he did, pushed it all down because his own happiness had never been on the table. Not to mention that he had never felt he was allowed to express his interest in men like he did with women, not that Cas was 'technically' a man, but his vessel was, and once Jimmy had vacated, it was all Cas in there.
Years of pining, wanting, waiting transpired in that kiss. Layers of guilt peeled away, and the walls they built to keep each other out crumbled to dust. Every unspoken thing passed between them, finally they were free to be themselves, and be with the other.
"A snow globe?"
"Not that I think there is a wrong way to propose, but you just gotta make sure that the moment is special Dean-o. You know, like when I propose to Sam, it's gonna be big and elaborate, cause that's just who I am, but at the core it's gotta be a special moment for you both. That's just my input anyway…"
"A bee snow globe?"
without the weight of the word on his shoulders. It was pretty great actually, there was just one person missing who should be there with them, who deserved his own little piece of heaven.
One last kiss and then the lights were turned off and the pair quickly fell asleep in each other's arms, finally content now that the other was there.
Gabriel noticed the silence and peeked at Sam a moment before looking back at the road, "What?"
"Castiel, from the moment I met you, I was yours, no one could ever compare to you, nor would I want them to try. You're all I want and need, and every moment with you just makes me fall deeper in love with you. I know that I want to spend the rest of my life with you, you're the best thing to ever happen to me. I hope that you feel the same, and will do me the honour of marrying me…" Dean waited on baited breath, he knew his speech wasn't much, but it was true and it was from the heart.
After the shower, Dean rummaged in the freezer for a microwave meal, which he then heated and sat on the giant couch to eat while he caught up on his favourite show; Doctor Sexy. Cas had teased him more than once about having a crush on Doctor Sexy, so had Sam, but he just loved the easy watching, predictable, shitty drama of it…he swears.
"Shoes?"
"Mhmmm, sure you don't Dean-o. Anyway, lucky for you; we've arrived," Gabriel announced as he pulled up to the kerb in front of a large multistorey building.
Dean heard footsteps suddenly and his hunter instincts kicked in as he looked up, ready for whatever was coming his way.
What felt like hours later, and probably was, Dean awoke to something touching his forehead, he jerked away only to find Cas staring at him lovingly.
"You think we like putting up with you and Cas eye fucking your way through family dinners," Sam retorted.
, you are the most gorgeous thing in the universe."
"You were always there, and I was always blind."
He felt kind of silly unloading his thoughts like this, but it was eating him up inside and beating up old car wrecks just wasn't as therapeutic as it used to be.
"Cas!" his voice was hoarse with sleep, "you're home," he smiled drowsily and wrapped his arms around Castiel's waist, trying to drag him down onto the couch with him.
It was magical, like a Disney movie; fireworks went off in his brain, and time slowed, there was nothing in that moment but Castiel.
Dean gritted his teeth as he blushed again, "It's not a sex toy."
"I-I-I love you too Cas. I'm sorry it took me so long to say it, too long. I know I waited too long, and now you'll never know."
He was just starting to doze off when Cas came back; his hair slightly damp and tussled, and only wearing Dean's Led Zeppelin shirt, "Mmm,
"I didn't deserve everything you did for me, everything you gave up for me, I don't deserve you after the way I've treated you."
take John some time to get used to.
"I failed you, you bared your heart and soul to me and I couldn't even give you the same when it mattered most."
"If I had been honest with you, honest with myself, maybe things wouldn't have gone the way they did."
Dean had been there through so much of Cas' personal growth, his triumphs and his failures, and though they'd fought, and Dean had been an asshole sometimes, they always came back to each other. He always missed Cas while he was gone, even if he was mad at the feathery bastard.
Cas moaned, "Dean…you know how much I want you, but it's two in the morning and I've had a long day, I would really love to just have a shower and fall asleep in your arms right now. Tomorrow I'm all yours, I promise."
"Dean!"
After long moments they pulled apart and Dean smiled a watery grin that matched Castiel's. They stared into each other's eyes and then both tried to speak at once.
He kicked at a small stone and it rolled away.
"How was the flight?" Sam asked as Dean spotted his suitcase come down the conveyor belt.
Dean frowned as he read the message, he was disappointed but he tried to not let it show in his reply, just that he was eager to see his boyfriend when he finished work. Dean hit send on the message then turned his phone off and put it away as he boarded the plane.
Cas stood back up straight and held his hand out for Dean.
"Okay, yeah," Dean stopped trying to pull Cas in and let him go so he could sit up.
Castiel became visibly excited, he put the empty tray aside and closed his eyes, "I'm ready…"
Sam was having none of that, "Is it another porcelain bee? Cas didn't shut up about the last one for like two weeks."
His chest was tight with the emotions he felt.
Gabriel took Dean's suitcase and wheeled it for him, which was oddly nice of him, Dean figured he must be on his best behaviour for Sam. Gabriel liked to be a bit of a joker, doing harmless pranks, and generally being the class clown. Dean got along with him fairly well, but that didn't mean he was immune to pranks.
"Hello Dean," Cas smiled, "shall we go to bed instead of sleeping on the couch?"
"So, what did you buy Cas this time?" Sam asked as they turned out of the airport.
Dean dropped some tension he was carrying and smiled, "I hope so."
The angel was practically jogging towards him, he also had tears in his eyes. Had he been listening?
Another sigh.
Now a bit more awake, Dean bypassed the offered hand and stood up, he curled his hands under Cas' ass and lifted him easily. Castiel's legs wrapped around Dean's waist as he chuckled, his hand clasped behind Dean's neck. Dean wasted no time in claiming Castiel's mouth with his own, they stood there for long moments engulfed in each other, until the need for air was too great.
Castiel blushed and got into bed, "I love you Dean."
"Uh, thanks…hey, how much does Cas tell you guys?" suddenly Dean was concerned that his brother knew way too much.
One moment Castiel was being pulled away from Dean by the Empty, and the next thing he knew he was standing in some kind of forest. This wasn't Earth though; it was Heaven.
"Everything I ever wanted and needed was right there in front of me; it was you."
"How do you reckon dad's going to take it?" Sam queried.
"Cassie is gonna freak, we're gonna be hearing about this for months," Gabe only half complained.
Bobby and John had been friends since they served together as Marines. John had taken over the family business from his father, and Bobby had come to work for him. It was a big shock to everyone when Bobby's wife suddenly passed away. Bobby wasn't really the same after that, until he met Crowley. Everyone could see that Crowley was good for Bobby, and that was all that mattered, even if it
"I would do anything to have you here with me. I don't know what to do. I fucked up."
Dean Winchester was just about to board his flight home, when his phone buzzed in his trouser pocket. He stopped to the side of the gate, letting other passengers board while he fished his phone out and looked at the message. It was from his boyfriend, Cas, telling him that he was really sorry but his co-worker Balthazar had called in sick last minute and so he had to work a double shift. Cas also said that he knew it wasn't because Balthazar was sick but because of this new guy he was seeing; Lu. He added at the end of the message that Dean's brother, Sam, would be picking him up from the airport instead.
“Okay?” Dean found his eyes.
That, he decided, was some self-pitying narcissistic horseshit.
He caught John's eyes. “You never met him. He showed up a little bit after you, uh. Passed.” He nodded in Mary’s direction. “Mom’ll remember him. Anyways one morning he showed up on my car,” he readied for his dad to correct him and hurried his words “Uh, on baby, completely naked and covered in bees.”
Just some TWs: Homophobia and Suicide are discussed in this chapter. If thats an issue, please take care of yourself.

It wasn't until he’d pulled up to the cabin, stars twinkling in the navy twilight sky, that it occurred to him.
“Yeah. Glitched. It started stretching, it looked like something underneath it was pushing upwards or something. It took over the whole road, I couldn't drive forward anymore.”
Dean’s face lit up. Whether or not he could remember drinks with Bobby was no longer of importance, because this was a story. He crossed the room in long strides, picking up the piece of paper where he’d hastily scrawled down the lyrics earlier.
_____________
The sigil. The summoning. The ritual then had been much more complicated, but if what Chuck said was true and he was empty-adjacent, well.
For a while, the thing most akin to god in his life was his own father- commanding and strict and all-knowing. John Winchester could define what was sin and what was sacrifice and demand them both in a single fell swoop. He’d tell Dean to repent and he would. For years, that’s what Dean Winchester was- a loyal soldier, a holy weapon, the one believer in his father’s church.
She walked out the door, John holding it wide open for her, sunlight streaming around the couple.
“Because, Dean, this is heaven. If it senses you aren't happy, it’ll try it’s best to create an environment where you are. This-” he paused, wetting his lips. “This is a wild goose chase.”
But there it was again, the disturbance. A shift in the very being of this place. Castiel felt the hairs on his skin prick up. There was something here. And then, he felt a hand on his arm, a movement wrenching him upwards. Cas panicked for a moment, trying to turn to see what had grabbed him. And then, as his face twisted to make out the face of his captor, there was light, blinding light.
“Forty-one is
Sometimes, it flitted by so quickly he couldn't believe it, other times he felt like he was fighting his way through weighted air. “Eighth” He said it with certainty this time, “time praying to you since I got here.”
Dean found his words. “Where’s Jack?” He demanded.
Castiel’s words rolled over him like the tide. He was his Daddy’s blunt instrument. He was wielded and shaped and
He closed the cabin door behind him as he thought about it.
“All this?”
Instead, the same line played again and again and again.
“How are you so sure?” Dean’s voice cracked a tiny bit as the tail end of that sentence slipped from his lips.
He got to see Charlie again, real Charlie, not other-world-Charlie, and damn had Dean missed her. She was as bubbly and geeky as always, joyously showing Dean the newest LARP set up that involved magical weapons and pegasuses, because this was Heaven, why shouldn't there be winged horses?
And then there was Cas and there was a real capital G God and it all went to shit.
Dean hadn't realised how far away from him everyone had moved, their chairs crowded together tightly. “I’ve survived worse. You know that. Every single one of you has. I just-” He paused. “I couldn't do it anymore. So you’re right dad, I got my hero’s death. Went out in the heat of fucking battle, huh?”
She was good like that, Eileen. Happy to joke around, as long as it put a smile on Sam’s face.
Dean threw a plate. The scratching part of his brain was quiet again.
“You’re right. It’s not a funny story. I almost got you killed.”
It was a strange sight, everyone he’d lost gathered around a warmly lit table, happily drunk and laughing. Well.
Maybe he was making it up but his head already felt clearer.
Dean smiled too, his heart rate starting to go back to a normal human rate.
Mary interjected. “That’s not exactly true, it’s more-”
“FUCK!” he screamed into the air. “FUCK FUCK FUCK!”
And so, when he was running through the halls of the bunker with Dean from Billie, a familiar fear filled him. He knew this could be the one. For either of them, maybe even both. Billie was not forgiving, especially not of the eldest Winchester. So when they ducked into that room, when the door slammed and Billie shrieked in anger, Cas knew what he had to do.
There was more silence.
“Dad, you brought it up at our truly lovely family get together the other day. Say it.” His voice was loaded with venom. It felt good.
He didn't remember adding that one to the mix. A lot of Heaven worked like that- things happened because you wanted them to, not because you set them up to happen. If you fall asleep dreaming of banana bread, you’ll wake up to a loaf on the counter. If you were fixing up a car and needed a wrench you’d forgotten on the other side of the garage, it would suddenly appear right next to your hand.
Dean bit his tongue. He still wasn't used to the lack of physical pain from doing things. He used to rely on that to stop himself from having an outburst- he’d bite his lip until it bled or dig his nails into his palm until they left little crescent shapes.
Bobby nodded. “Yes, Dean, I’m aware of your affinity for classic rock. You make it at least 35% of your personality.”
“You said you loved me!” Dean almost shouted the words. “That's what you said. That was the reason.”
“Dean, let’s think about how things work here for a minute.” Bobby held out his hand, a beer appeared in it moments later. “The physical being of this place is attached to what you want, right? You want a beer, you get a beer. Want to go fishing, the perfect road suddenly opens up.”
Dean spoke up again. “Shit. I should’ve written this down. Look, Cas, I’ve known you for more then ten years. You saved me as our form of first introduction. I couldn't let you go out saving me too.”
Maybe, he wondered dully, that’s why he felt so shitty here. He’d lived a long goddamn life, and forty of those years had been spent, well. The opposite of here.
______________
“Come on,” she said with a smile, her eyes looking directly and unseeingly into his. “There's so much to talk about.”
And so he did what he always did- he dried his tears, got up, walked back over to baby, pushed a cassette player into the deck, and started the long drive home. Come on Eileen started blasting as he pulled out of park.
His heart was catching up with the situation and beating, fast. He knew he was an adult, in size 10 boots and with graying hair, but some part of him still felt like a scared 11 year old, face already slightly downturned, waiting for the punch or the words. His shoulders were tense again, he was ready for the table to be thrown, for John to relentlessly mock his excuse, because even he knew it was weak.
, somehow. He thought he knew what that felt like, that 40 years in hell prepared him for every type of heat but this was different.
He took a moment, trying the breathing again. Like Castiel would want him to do.
It was pristine again. Postcard-like. Dean wasn't sure why he couldn't get that comparison out of his head.
He used to torment Sammy by chasing him around the bunker with this song when he first started seeing Eileen. Claire had taught him about bluetooth speakers, and he had a joy of a time rigging them up all across the bunker. For a whole week, the song would play any time Sammy entered a room. It drove him batshit. Eileen taught Dean how to sign some of the lyrics so she could cash in on the fun too.
“Now I’m ramblin’ and wasting your time. Sorry. Again. Uh.” He paused again, wetting his lips with the tip of his tongue. “I really am. Really fucking sorry. Talk to you later.”
Dean settled back into his seat, trying to dig through his head again. He took a swig of beer while Ellen told a long story involving a rattlesnake and a wendigo.
The tears were not silent anymore. Dean was a mess. Cas was starting to become one too.
Castiel was hovering feet over the ground, wings iridescent and expanded at full length, glowing with silent power. He was facing Chuck-Not-Jack.
Dean had never planned on being happy.
Dean still smiled every time he saw him. He knew it would take a multitude of heavenly sunsets to ever stop being a little surprised when he pulled up to that porch and saw the man sitting there, alive and happy.
Dean always knew Sam trying on the macho persona meant things were bad. He knew Sam practiced ASL night at night for weeks after she kicked it. He wondered if Sammy knew he knew.
wasnt Sam.
“fUCKING HELL! WE ARE HAVING A MOMENT HERE!” Chuck screamed it into the air.
Dean laughed. “No, no I gotta admit I did not.” He took another swig. “I still can't believe this suits them.”
“What?”
it’s a case.”
Everyone seemed so, well,
Dean slapped his upper arm. “Hey! We’re not co-de-fucking-pendent.”
“Hey, it’s a little funny. Everyone was
He sat there for a moment, tangled in his sheets, tee shirt sticking to his side uncomfortably. “Oh shit, right. Uh, over n’ out, signing off, amen, all that.”
“Come on!” John-
Bobby sighed. His eyes looked sympathetic, drawing in pity. Dean hated that look. He’d only seen it in Bobby’s eyes a few times before.
Mary hurried towards the door, the platter of bacon in hand. “You coming?” she asked Dean, but she wasn't really asking and Dean knew it. He smiled weakly. “Yeah.”
His throat was thick. He knew he should stop talking before he said something he’d regret. He’d done enough of that tonight.
Chuck-Not-Jack had used the airtime to catch himself. His eyes glowed.
Dean realized he had not moved this entire time, his hand still hovering numbly over the paring knife. His shoulders were tense, almost up to his ears, he knew that he knew they could see his discomfort, they could see the shock in his eyes, his face, he wasn't hiding it he had to hide it. He moved his arm from the knife quickly and rubbed the back of his neck.
Dean felt like his entire body was being consumed in a wall of mist. “Give in,” Chuck whispered. “Don’t you want it all to be over? Again? No angst, no pain.”
“I don’t,” Dean choked, “I don’t understand why’d you do that for me. I told you, I’ve been thinking. I was so shitty to you near the end.” His face was becoming wet. He threw his hands up in the air. “I told you that you were dead to me I mean-” he took a deep breath, running his fingers through his hair. “I don’t understand how you could see past any of that. I wouldn't have. I couldn't have.” He chuckled humorlessly. “You shouldn't have.”
“Come on!” Chuck laughed. “You really thought you beat me? In a fist fight? Against God?”
“What a view!” She said enthusiastically. Dean nodded, mouth full. She was right, it was a beautiful view.
It took Dean one too-long moment to realize what she was talking about. “Oh! Oh. Yeah.”
Bobby leaned forward. “You don’t see it?”
But seeing her alive gave him this sense of peace. She was okay. It was all okay.
Dean did.
Everyone else here seemed so goddamn content. Everyone was happy, smiling, delighted with their eternal paradise.
know this. Claire and Kaia used to play this song all the time.
He sighed. “I’m wasting your time. I know I am. You’ve got universes to rebuild or whatever. I just. I really need you, man. I’m not right when you aren't around.”
Dean wandered cautiously down the stairs. He doubted this was his father.
Dean sat down at the dining room table in minor shock.
Tears were falling down Cas’s face now. His eyes searched for connection across the table.
Dean tilted his head. He had a choice to make. He grinned, and spun the knife between his fingers. He launched himself at Chuck at full speed, bodychucking Not-Cas to the ground. He slipped him into a quick arm lock as he hit the ground, and dug the blade into Not-Cas’s hand.
Dean knew that feeling, knew it to his core, felt it in his bones.
Cas was sending these songs. These were from Cas.
“What?” Dean demanded. “What was so goddamn important-”
Dean’s head was spinning.
Dean’s eyes widened slightly as the lyrics sunk in. He wasn't sure if he was legally allowed to listen to this in Heaven.
“What you said, it uh. It made me want to change.” Dean leaned forward awkwardly, putting down his coffee and leaning his arms on the table. His face fell into his hands. He looked back up.
And now he had no choice but to take a pause because his throat was thick with emotion. “I’m so fucking sorry, Cas. I- I wish you hadn't done that. Sacrificed yourself, I mean. You can be a really stupid for a celestial.” He let out a breathy chuckle, eyes stinging just slightly.
He threw his head back, a shot of whiskey already appearing in his hand. It tasted like what Cas smelled like.
Bobby said it took a minute to adapt, to get used to the new life. To get those hunter’s impulses driven out of his system. He was paranoid, he knew that, his fight or flight triggered by shadows on the wall. But for some fucking reason he felt like he was holding his breath and he just needed to
He wiped his eyes and started up baby again. He could go back home, he thought dully. Learn some ASL for when Eileen gets here. It would be a nice surprise.
“Two songs you don’t usually think about but know have played. Dean, they just played because you missed the people they remind you of.”
“Yes, this morning. Let me talk Bobby. This morning I woke up and there was a radio playing. I didn't own a radio, and I’ve never owned a copy of the song. It was one of kaia’s favorites she-”
John stood up. “Dean,” he said softly. “I’m proud of you. I love you. You did everything right.”
Time really was getting blurry up here. Bobby was right.
” He growled, voice low and menacing.
He was in Heaven,
Dean looked at the ground again. “It’s just. Sometimes I almost miss the life. Maybe that’s what this is. I had so much to fight against for
What mystery was there to solve here? The verse was vague enough already. There was nothing for him to fight, no battles to be won, no stalking of nightmarish beings or feats of heroism. There was nothing here he could conquer by beating the shit out of it. There was just Heaven trying to adapt for his brokenness.
Ellen swatted him with a rag. “That.” She said sharply. “Is besides the point.”
Jo waved him over. Dean grinned. He’d seen her a few times since he’d came back, but seeing her never failed to make him a little giddy. Not the kind of giddiness a teenager gets when they see their crush or anything. He didn't think of her romantically, not anymore. Maybe once, years ago. Back when he was 20 years younger and had seen seven fewer apocalypses.
Not-Cas looked at him sympathetically.
was in his house-
So I confronted them.”
facing it and I knew it was there and-” His voice caught. “I didn't make the change. I don’t know why.”
and Dean would pretend to resist and half-heartedly protest until he’d pull into the BNB’s little parking lot instead. And Cas would smile, the flaps of his trench coat all messed up and sticking the wrong ways and Sammy would grumble about how Dean never stopped at the BNBs
Bobby looked confused. “He’s a vamp, Dean. They go to purgatory. You know that.”
John guffawed with laughter. Someone knocked over a beer but it evaporated instantly, some sort of heavenly housekeeping service hard at work.
It was as if nothing happened. The bird song resumed.
They sat across each other at the table in the bunker the next morning. Cas had not seen Sam yet- Dean explained he was out picking up Eileen from a hunt in Pasadena. He also explained what happened with Chuck, that Jack had taken his place, and all the resurrections that followed (“except for you,” Dean said hoarsely, “Jack couldn't quite reach you.”)
“Dean!” The hunter found himself cut off by the booming voice of his father, who had just entered the bar. The doors swung wildly behind him.
Dean wiped under his lip and gestured widely around the porch. “You know, all this. Heaven. Eternal domestic bliss. I’d have thought Dad would get bored.”
Dean was a mess. He ran a hand over his stubble self-consciously as his foot started tapping out of anxious habit. This was good, he told himself. This was nice.
“I have fought the good fight,” he read softly, “I have finished the race, I have kept the faith.”
The song felt like Castiel, Dean decided. He debated searching the rest of the house for intruders, grabbing the paring knife from the counter and following every hunter’s instinct that he possessed.
Dean waved him off. “Can it. I’m going somewhere.” He tried to refocus. “I was driving on the way home, and my music was playing, and then it wasn't my music. You remember that British song- come on Eileen?”
An adjustment, Bobby had called it. One minute, Dean was bleeding out with rebar entangled within his ribs, and the next he was standing on a dusty road in an Undisclosed American Somewhere, a place that managed to tie together all the pieces of his old life- the bunker, the roadhouse, Bobby’s safehouse, motels that he didn't know he remembered until he stepped foot in the lobby.
Heaven was fascinating- you could only interact with people you’d known before. Like he could meet up with Ellen and Jo for tea, but no matter how far he traveled he’d never get to meet anyone really cool, like Joan of Arc or John Lennon. They were somewhere else, in some other brand of heaven. Probably a brand of heaven that included actual cities, not just sprawling wilderness.
He pulled baby into a parking space right by the entrance, and gave himself a moment before walking in.
“I- You have no idea what you did to me, Dad.”
“Your only job now,” Bobby told him, “Is to be content. Do all the shit you’ve ever wanted to try.” He elbowed the bowlegged hunter. “I’ve picked up fencing.” Dean scoffed. “Fencing? But that’s so-” He wrinkled his forehead, eyebrows drawing closer together. “Niche?” Bobby interrupted. “I know. That’s the point. You can do anything here, Dean. Whatever makes you happy.”
He’d look content in those moments. Sometimes, Dean imagined that the sunlight would erase anything that was wrong, the years, the bruises, the fear, the dirt, all of it, just for a few blissful minutes.
The drive to the roadhouse was quiet. Dean didn't put on any music. He was a little afraid of what would play.
The sun was starting to slink down under the mountain ridges, golden rays fighting for visibility through the tips of red firs and whitebark pines.
He stopped. “You never got to meet her. You’d have liked her. Smart. Anyways, it was playing, and-” he thrust the lyrics at Bobby. “It was just this part of the song on loop, and as soon as I’d written down all the words,” he spread both his hands wide in the air. “Poof. The radio vanished. Completely gone.”
John grinned, stepping over to her, wrapping her in his army jacket-clad arms. “The burning bacon suggests otherwise.”
Dean’s brow furrowed. “See what?”
“I- I don’t” John was stuttering. Dean had never seen him like this.
Part of him wanted to scream in his father’s face, curse him out and throw shit. Part of him wanted to tell him in graphic detail exactly how much explaining he had to do. He wanted to lean forward, look into his father’s eyes, and tell him exactly how he shaped who Dean was as a dysfunctional wreck of a human being.
Dean bounded up the last stair with extra gusto. Bobby passed him a cold beer as Dean settled down in a chair next to the older hunter. “Well?” Bobby asked.
and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
“Fuck that, I do know why. I didn't want to be around anymore, Cas. It’s not like I exactly wanted to be dead or anything, but. I just. I didn't see a point anymore.”
She rolled her eyes. “Knee pain. You sound so old!” She started walking towards a table in the back, where Bobby already sat with a pint of something amber.
Reflexes took over and he pulled baby into reverse, the fastest he’d ever managed to do it, and he hauled ass back down the road, tossing his burnt hand over the passenger seat to see what was coming up behind him. He could feel the blisters developing on his fingertips already.
He chewed on his inner lip. “But this? It doesn't feel. Right.”
Sure, he understood the concept. He’d seen it on TV, watched Sam and Eileen smile at each other across the table in the bunker, fingers constantly linked. He’d seen people in bars act like magnets as they got closer and closer and closer to each other, whispering in ears and hands making their ways slowly down closer and closer to reproductive organs.
Dean felt a shift from where John was sitting. He briefly debated slipping the steak knife from the table into his hand. He decided against it- he wasn't gonna stab his father and resisting usually made it worse- and he was bracing for impact and he felt the blood pumping in his veins and-
Dean scoffed. “Oh but you can’t fucking say it.” His voice was cold and harsh. The last time he spoke like this, well, he regretted it beyond measure.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I think, technically, I’m called a
“Honestly. You’d think you’d want to make friends with the most powerful celestial being in existence, but
Everyone sat there in silence for a moment.
“Dean,” Cas breathed, and he knew he’d never said anything like he’d said that name. He knew he said it like a man on a ship far at sea, like he was kneeling in prayer, like he was grasping at something, anything.
John Winchester strided over to the two of them, hand finding Dean’s shoulder almost immediately. “You know,” John said confidently, “Ellen and I always thought you two would be a cute couple.”
And not two seconds later, the entire radio disappeared. Gone.
He scoffed. Eternal paradise. What a concept.
He was so angry. Always, angry. Angry at Cas, at Jack, at Sam, at Chuck, at the world.
He opened his eyes. “Dean.” He said. “When Jack was dying-”
Dean pulled back slightly. “No- no Ellen didn't want that.” He tried to interject. “She- she hated you for something, didn't she?” His brain felt foggy again. He was trying to remember what it was that John had done so wrong.
He was
“And then I was too late. So I couldn't stop. I had to find you.” He chuckled dryly. “It took years. Sam and Eileen got married, you know, while I looked. Charlie did too. Everyone else was moving on and creating lives and I couldn't do that without you, Cas.” He laughed again, his throat sore and voice chaotic. “I didn't want a future without you in it. I couldn't comprehend that.”
He fell asleep quickly that night. He dreamt of Miracle and Eileen and Sam. It was beautiful.
He’d known everytime he watched Dean Winchester die, he’d known every time he and Sam searched for a remedy, and he’d known while he felt an all-consuming fear that this death might take.
“You told me that you almost let the banshee get me because I was getting too expensive to keep around. That’s what you fucking said to me. You never told me your fingers froze up.” He chuckled dryly. “Actually, I was wrong. That story is funny. It’s fucking hysterical. I spent 30 goddamn years thinking you wanted me dead because buying me cheerios was too much of a financial burden. The reality? Your fingers were cold.”
Dean tried to gasp for air, searching for reality to cling to, when suddenly-
how it was a
“All of you know it. You’ve been treading around it so fucking catiously, like its a minefield or eggshells or whatever the fuck. Every single one of you knows it. I can see it when you look at me.”
Dean felt his brow furrow before he could remind himself not to react. “What?”
“I’ve been uh, thinking a lot. Since you left.” Dean said, shifting.
Bobby scoffed. “You a lightweight now? We didn't even drink that much yesterday.” He pushed passed Dean and into the cabin. “You drink more after you got home or something?”
He turned back around, fully facing the setting sun, entire body lit up in the golden-orange light. “Well, I’m fucking calling!” He screamed, the sound tearing through his vocal chords.
Hozier lyrics were less complicated to research, which led Dean to his third discovery- that the song directly referenced the bible, specifically Timothy 4:7. Within moments, Dean had a bible in his hands and was flipping through the pages.
Dean scoffed. “I was old.”
“Bingo! So we go out there to check it out, Sam Dean and I, and Sammy’s lil. He was what- seven?”
“Okay so, yesterday, we had drinks, right?” Bobby nodded. Dean’s brain felt foggy again but he pushed through it. “So after drinks I went on a drive, a long one.” Dean decided to skip over the part where he sobbed on a mountainside  while praying to an uninterested angel. “And on the way home I’m listening to music, right?”
“I had a friend, a uh, an angel.”
He scrunched up his forehead. “Hey uh, do you know if Benny ended up here?”
Dean let out a long shaky breath, and ran a hand through his hair. What the fuck what the fuck what the
He shifted awkwardly. “I uh-”
Bobby looked at him all deadpan again before shaking his head and finishing his beer.
Cas wasn't coming.
and she was
was so disgustingly obvious in his voice. He closed his eyes again, resting the back of his head against the cool wall. He tried to imagine a shift in the air, the familiar sound of angel’s wings, the flap of a trenchcoat.
“Cas?” Dean whispered, his voice abandoning the familiar gruff notes.
Chuck was in front of Dean in under a second, his face right in front of his. He smiled. “We get to do it all again.” His breath was hot on his face.
“Not horsehit.”
“I mean,” John started up again, “That’s what you used to say. You wanted a hero's death.”
Dean and Cas spent all morning in bed reacquainting their bodies, it had been the perfect morning so far. Dean had been thinking about what Gabriel had said in the car the previous night, and he realised the he and Cas had never been about the big things, but they enjoyed the small things instead; a stolen kiss, a loving glance, sharing their meals, or simply spending the day in bed together.
"I always knew Dean, there is nothing to forgive."
"Let's just say that the Empty wasn't keen on the idea of being disturbed anymore, so it released you to me. Oh, I'm God now by the way," Jack explained simply.
"Yeah, I've been saving up all year to buy you the perfect ring," Gabriel answered nonchalantly, but there was a little smirk on his face.
"Cas?"
"I was such an idiot."
"Please believe that I felt it, I've always felt it, I wanted to tell you so many times,
"I missed you too Dean, the apartment isn't the same when you're not here," Cas assured him with another kiss.
Then Cas had gone and blown him away by revealing that it was never one sided. It should have been obvious in hindsight, that Castiel loved him, treasured him, and even there and then in the face of Castiel's permanent death, Dean doubted, he put up a wall and hid from the feelings that had always been there. He regretted not telling Cas that he loved him just as much, regretted not holding him tightly, and kissing him like he'd always daydreamed about.
"Hey guys," Dean greeted as he got closer. He hugged his brother briefly and shook Gabriel's hand.
"Eh, about as good as we can hope for from dad I guess," Dean answered, he didn't care what his dad said, he was going to spend the rest of his life with Castiel and that was that.
"I love you Castiel, I'm sorry it took me so long to say it, please forgive me.
He just about drove himself nuts, his thoughts running circles in his mind, until he couldn't take it anymore. He'd prayed to Castiel multiple times, knowing that the angel wouldn't be able to hear him, but he didn't know what else to do.
Sam stared at Gabriel, glanced at Dean, and then back at Gabriel, his eyes wide and mouth gaped.
Cas worked at a coffee shop called 'Coffee at the Crossroads' that at night turned into a bar called 'Cocktails at the Crossroads.' It was owned by a Winchester family friend, Crowley, which is actually how Dean met Cas. On Castiel's first day, Dean had come in for his morning coffee as usual and had been immediately taken with those bright, piercing blue eyes. Dean got Cas' number and they'd been together ever since. Of course John, Dean's father, wasn't entirely pleased that both of his sons were dating men, but there wasn't a lot he could do about it either. Not to mention that his best friend, and trusted employee, had also been dating a man since his wife had passed away ten years ago.
Once Dean's stomach was rumbling they decided it was time to get food. Cas had a quick shower to clean up while Dean got to work on making them bacon and eggs. He set up the bacon, eggs, toast, orange juice, and a single flower (he pinched it from the vase on the dining table) on a tray and brought it back to the bedroom.
"What? How?" a lot had happened apparently.
A single tear slid down his cheek.
"A tie?"
The tears welled up in his eyes.
Castiel responded like a man starved, he wrapped his arms around Dean, caressed the back of his head and kissed him like the world was ending.
"Ughh, gross guys," Dean pulled a face.
Succumbing to his long week away; Dean fell asleep on the couch in the middle of an important episode, which he'll be annoyed about later.
Cas turned, "Jack!" he grinned as he pulled his adopted son into a hug, "why am I here? Shouldn't I be in the Empty?"
Dean got off of the bed and went over to his bag, he pulled out a small black leather box and crawled back onto the bed. Cas held out his hands and Dean opened the box to reveal a stunningly intricate silver ring, he placed the box in Castiel's hands and sat back on his knees.
," Sam responded without skipping a beat, "so, what is it?"
Another deep breath.
They spent the rest of the day in bed too, celebrating, knowing that they had an entire life together to look forward to. Neither of them could've been happier.
"I may as well have gone to hell, because eternity without you is going to be torture."
He had really been looking forward to seeing Cas as he had been away on a business trip for the past week. But it would be fine; Cas would be there in the morning and they would spend the entire day together.
The thoughts of his angel swirled in his mind, Dean's mouth opened in a sigh and he couldn't keep it inside any longer.
Castiel opened his eyes, which immediately went wide, and he looked at Dean stunned.
Dean caught Sam rolling his eyes in the passing street lights, "C'mon Dean, Cas told me that you always bring him back something when you go on business trips. I didn't know you were so
Dean often found himself idly wondering about Castiel. He thought about Cas more often than he didn't until it was just about all he could think about. He thought about all the years he'd known Castiel, everything that they'd been through together; the good, the bad, the ugly and the down-right unmentionable.
"There is much to tell you, but that's not why I brought you here. You need to see something…"
"I always wanted you…I wanted you to stay, I wanted to hold you, to make all of your problems go away, to be the person you needed me to be."
He rubbed his face with his hand and made a noise in his throat.
Jack led him through the trees to a place where a makeshift road opened up to a clearing hardly big enough to fit four cars in. They stopped at the edge of the trees and waited.
