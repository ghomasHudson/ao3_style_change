Tears welled up in Dean`s eyes when his brother didn't respond. What had he done?
But he couldn't think any further, because in the next moment his hand found what he had been looking for all the time. He took the pistol firmly in his hand, cocked the hammer, and pressed it directly against the forehead of the werewolf.
He had seen a pool table in the corner, and on such an occasion, he could hardly say no. After all, they were almost always short of cash. He grabbed his beer and went to the table. A group of young men and women standing there, playing and laughing, and apparently just having a good time. He joined them, spent a round, and in no time had them hooked. After two or three games, he tossed his usual "let's make it more interesting" in the room and put twenty dollars on the table. The men got in, as confident of victory as they were. Dean had purposely acted a bit clumsy at the beginning to bait them.
"I know that you didn't make fun of me," said the latter and sank down on his bed.
"You don't really think he's coming in, do you?" He barked, with a knowing tone in his harsh voice. "I thought you knew him better by now, Castiel. Dean must be over the mountains!"
His thoughts were interrupted when Dean came out of the bathroom and started searching his bag.
Cursing to himself, Bobby ran past him to the door. The Impala was still standing, but that meant nothing. Dean knew his baby was too noticeable and easy to track. He must have taken another car, which he would change at the next opportunity.
The werewolf's claws dug into his arms, chest, and side. Dean felt how it tore open his skin, and blood oozed from them.
Comments and kudos are the essence of an author's life, so please! Tell me what you think of my story :D
He knew that this wasn't a permanent solution, but at the moment he saw no other way out. So he took a deep breath and pressed the shard tighter to his skin. He felt it cut into his arm and the blockage flickered in his head. Blood pooled around the edges of the wound and began to trickle down his arm as he lifted the shard.
Castiel snorted and shook his head. He knew that Dean was not fine, he could see it - in his posture, his demeanor, his facial features; he heard it in his words, his voice, and he felt it in his looks and the tension that did not seem to leave his body. But he was used to all of these things, just like Dean. Castiel's heart hurt when he saw how much suffering and soul pain Dean endured, buried deep in himself, and how he worked more and more into himself.
"Fine," Dean's voice began to ooze with sarcasm. "Then we just wait until the next man disappears and try to guess what kidnapped him. All right."
As soon as his gaze fell on Castiel, Dean felt a sting in his chest. It was a feeling of guilt that had been stuck in him for ages but kept coming back up again. How often did he have to insult and yell at Castiel before he was fed up with him and never came back?
"Damn, every time..." Dean growled as he started the engine.
"I was getting some when you were taking a shower."
Castiel's voice, behind the door, fell silent and Dean bit his lower lip. Of course, Cas had heard his thoughts...didn't he always do when he was thinking about him? Another reason why he didn't think of the angel at certain times.
"We...could ask Cas for help," Sam suddenly interjected.
"And angels are after you too. Clearly, you've really annoyed someone big."
"A witch bag. I think we have our culprit," Sam muttered, his eyes darkened.
"Dean, listen, I..." Sam started, but he was interrupted by his brother.
"Dean, I..."
"That was pretty unreasonable. He just wants to help," said Sam when the familiar rustling of Cas's wings had ceased.
"Don't do that! No!" Shouted Dean when she also scratched at the second sigil.
He had to look for a moment and finally held it out to Dean. That grabbed it, and a second later, Sam let out a scream and went down on his knees. Their fingertips were touching.
"Rowena can fix the wounds and she also has the solution to your problem," he said and slowly walked back to the house.
"Any last words?" She asked, pulling a slender dagger from behind her back.
"Do we have any?" Dean actually replied and switched on the TV, which was opposite the beds.
"I just don't want to stand in front of Sammy so agitated, that's all...Please, just a few minutes."
Meanwhile, Sam had grabbed a book from the back seat and was lost in it. It was a work that described all sorts of monsters and that had often been very useful. From time to time, he read it again so that he could better memorize the knowledge. Sometimes he wondered what it felt like to have no idea that these monsters really existed and to read a book like this just for fun. But this question passed relatively quickly, leaving only a bitter taste in his mouth. Neither he nor Dean would ever have such a life and, somehow, that was a good thing. After all, they helped make the world a little safer...when they weren't busy starting the next apocalypse.
It was noon when they were leaving the cheap motel for the next monster hunt. They didn't know where this was going to take place, but they had to keep moving. Demons were on their heels, and angels probably too. They had been quiet lately, but they couldn't and couldn't trust it. The question of where they would go next was answered when Dean's cell phone rang.
"I'll teach you manners!" Shouted the man and walked up to him.
The whole situation was just too much for Dean. He could control his feelings, had learned from an early age to put them on the back burner, but this curse ruined everything! The need for affection, for touch, was like a tingling sensation under his skin that he couldn't really ignore. It burned like a fire in him that threatened to devour everything. But he would be damned if he hurt the ones he loved because of it. He would rather numb his feelings with alcohol and be in a bad mood all day because of it.
"I don't know if that's such a good idea..." Sam muttered and unconsciously rubbed at his chest.
The brothers looked at each other meaningfully and finally nodded. The moment was like a thought transfer; this hint was at least a trace to work with. Just as Dean wanted to ask about the appearance of Stella, the pub door opened and the group gave a collective groan.
"Not helpful, Sam..."
He stood there for a few more minutes and stared after her, while his mind tried to process what had happened. What if Sam hadn't made fun of him and his touch really hurt? Why did it all have to happen to him, what did it all mean?
They had surrounded the two of them and now drew the circle closer. Dean had no eyes for it, however. Sam was lying next to him, unconscious, maybe even half-dead, and only because of him.
But then he pulled himself up again and pulled the covers out from under his body to snuggle into. Another habit the curse had brought to light - he craved body closeness so much that he tried to recreate it by all means. That was also the reason why, for the second time that evening, he reached for his pillow and the one of the second bed and pressed them against his chest and stomach. He literally snuggled up to them like he would have if a human lay next to him...or a certain angel. With the illusion of a body beside him, Dean fell into a restless sleep.
"I helped a girl who was molested by two guys. They were no big deal - just giant, drunk idiots. I gave her my jacket and offered to bring her home," he raised his voice a little when Sam wanted to interrupt him. "Not because I wanted to do that with her, Sam. She was practically still a child. I really just wanted to bring her home, make sure that other guys like that don't try to bother her. I offered her my arm, and...When she accepted it...she suddenly screamed in pain and backed away. I wanted to explain to her that I didn't do anything...that I couldn't help it, but by then, she was gone. It was like the woman in the brothel."
He turned him onto his back and put two fingers to his neck to see if he could feel his pulse.
I feel so sorry for him T.T But I love to suffer with him /.\
"And?" Sam asked and looked at his brother.
At the same time, the two lamps that had lit the room up to that point exploded. Now they were in the dark. Dean, who had already opened his mouth to respond, closed it again and looked at the floor. Again he felt tears in his eyes. Cas was probably right. After all, he didn't apologize to him very often, and when he did, he didn't ever try to change his behavior. But, the worst part was that Castiel apologized for him or looked for explanations for his behavior. Dean screwed up his eyes and fought back the tears. He felt terrible, wanted nothing more than to hug the angel...especially now that Cas didn't seem to get hurt too much. But Castiel still didn't look at him. He couldn't tell whether Cas was angry with him or not. Hell, he couldn't even tell if he was only here because Sam had asked him or if he still cared about Dean.
"I can help," he just said, but Dean shook his head.
The first thing they did was get a motel room. Then they walked through the city maybe, there were some signs of what exactly made the young men disappear. Demonic omens or something like that, you never knew where a clue would come from. As usual, they drove to the parents and friends of the victims and interviewed them. It took several hours, but no matter who they spoke to, sooner or later, they always got the same statement.
Out of the corner of his eye, he saw her raise her hand in his direction again. Without warning, he pushed her away and fled from the room. He could hear Sam calling his name, but he didn't react just ran out into the courtyard. There he wandered around between the cars, looking for a place where he could hide undisturbed.
In the meantime, Dean stood, admittedly quite frustrated, at the reception desk of the motel and watched the hippie behind it, as he went through the reservations of the different rooms.
"You should know that I don't mind a bit of pain. After all, I'm an angel and can't really be hurt by such curses."
"Well done, you idiot," he snapped at himself. "Now you surelly have managed to stop him from talking to you."
He almost laughed at these thoughts because it was the pure irony that he wasn't allowed to let Castiel near him so the angel wouldn't be hurt and, in return, not to be hurt himself. Sighing, he drank the other half of the beer in his hand and went straight to the next.
"I don't care, man," Dean mimicked his tone. "Whether it's a closet or something like it. I just want my own room. Those idiots have been keeping me up for the fourth night. If I don't get some sleep soon, I'll run amok, and I don't think you want to experience that!"
Castiel nodded and broke away from Sam.
All night long Castiel sat on the bed next to Dean and whispered soothing words. He was tempted to make his dreams easier immediately, but he was afraid of Dean's reaction. He knew that he would feel pain, and he would have accepted it. But Dean? He would probably make his thoughts from before come true, sit in the Impala, and disappear. He had to prevent that in any case, and so he just sat there, whispering his gentle words and hoping that they would keep the nightmares away.
"That all you got?" He gasped and grinned a bloody grin.
"It's okay, Cas. I know that this is possible. You don't have to pamper me."
Finally, Castiel nodded and turned away again to leave. He knew that Dean didn't like to show his weaknesses and so he wanted to give him the opportunity to collect himself. Nevertheless, Castiel had a strange feeling when he left Dean and returned to the house.
"Maybe it isn't on the road today," said Sam and sipped on his beer.
"I mean..."
"A few minutes, nothing more."
"I...I...don't have any clothes here. Just the old...tattered ones," he finally grumbled.
"He was in the StepIn, his favorite bar, after that, I didn't hear from him again..."
"I know that you two are making nasty remarks!" Dean grumbled when he stopped next to Sam and looked at him with dark eyes.
However, Dean could do what he wanted he couldn't remember Stella's words. They were still in his head like a whisper, but as soon as he tried to concentrate on them, they became quieter or disappeared entirely. It was maddening.
It took about twenty minutes before he got back to the motel and stood in front of their room. Just as he was about to unlock, he could hear voices from inside. Sam was talking to someone...had he called Bobby or did Bobby call him? The question dissolved when he heard a rough voice that sent shivers down his spine.
"Of course, he killed my sister after all," she explained, seeming to misinterpret Castiel's tone.
"I'll say hello. Stay close."
"I'll be right after you," he mumbled and smiled at Castiel, who immediately opened his mouth to say something. "I...need a moment, okay? Let me clear my head and then I'll come in, I promise."
"We don't know much. The only thing we can say for sure is that each of them had a drink with Stella before they disappeared. But without being sexist, the Witch doesn't have the power to drag boys somewhere, and they would certainly never have gone with her voluntarily," Phil jumped in again and got affirmative nods from his friends.
He reached for his cell phone and had already dialed the number in when he paused.
"Fuck...I didn't mean to...Sammy...I..."
Castiel's voice interrupted his thoughts and caused a desire to rise in him that he couldn't really fight. The only thing that kept him from jumping at the angel's neck was the spell that was still holding him against the wall and that was a good thing.
I can't wait to write Bobby xD
"Don't...you touch...me..." mumbled Dean into the mattress, and after that, his senses vanished.
"If that's all...I thought I was going to die, Sammy. You really scared me for a moment."
"Bobby said he might have found a solution to the curse, but he didn't want to discuss it on the phone," Castiel said finally. "We should hurry up."
"We can go," sounded Cas's voice suddenly from the back seat and shocked them both.
"No, no, no...," Dean stammered and wanted to grab Sam by the shoulders to shake him - but at the last moment, he remembered the curse and dropped his hands. "Come on, Sammy. Open your eyes...Sam!"
Dean shook his head. He hadn't meant to sound so harsh, but it was better that way. After all, Cas shouldn't find out anything about his feelings. He was an angel, damn it, and Dean was the exact opposite, at least in his own view.
With these words, Dean got out and went to the trunk. He took out one of his silver knives and put it in his pocket. Dean briefly considered taking a pistol with him, but if anyone noticed it, he would be thrown out of the bar in no time. So he left it with the knife. Sam only got out when he gave him another questioning and annoyed look. His brother was still too hesitant for Dean's liking when it came to such things. It was all well and good to have double and triple coverage - but that wasn't always the case. Sometimes you had to plunge into the unknown and make the best of it.
Castiel banished the voice as quickly as it came. After all, it wasn't like Dean had never let him touch him. On the contrary, he was grateful every time Castiel healed him, and he had never felt uncomfortable when the angel put an arm around his shoulders or hugged him completely when they hadn't seen each other for a long time...right? No, he wasn't afraid of him.
"What happened has happened. Don't get upset, you know how people are."
At the same time, Dean startled from his faint-like sleep and stared at Sam, who in turn looked helplessly at Castiel. Dean followed his gaze and paled immediately.
"I asked three times beforehand if she really wanted to because I know how the women in such sheds are often treated. I told her that if she doesn't want to, she just has to tell me and I'm not angry with her or anything. Damn it, I even offered her to pay her anyway, and she just laughed and pushed me on the bed. "
"I...I'm sorry. I don't know what to do" Dean's voice was little more than a whisper and yet Castiel heard the words as clearly as if he were speaking them himself. "This need to touch someone...to be close to someone, even if it's just a hug...I can't stand it anymore. Everyone I want to hug will be in pain and those I could hug I don't want to. It was bad before the curse, but then I was able to suppress the feelings. Now..."
She walked to the wall on which the sigil was painted and scratched at it with her dagger before Dean could say anything. Now his hiding place was no longer protected from Rowena's spells.
There he was, Castiel, in all his strength and glory...was that a concerned look? Castiel worried about him, then it was probably worse than he thought.
"I don't mean it like that..."
"Just leave me alone! Otherwise, I'll call the police!"
Hope you liked the last chapter and here is the next one :)
"Damn, now pull yourself together! You're not a little kid!" Dean growled when suddenly the door flew open and he was thrown against the next wall.
Dean raised his hands soothingly and wanted to explain that he had no idea what she was talking about. But then his jacket flew in his face, and the girl ran down the street.
"If you say so," moaned Dean and wondered at the same moment since when he reacted so submissively to women.
"That's not funny..." he growled and crossed his arms over his chest.
"Fuck you" Dean spat at her to provoke her and it worked.
Castiel winced when he heard her words and would have liked to disappear, but then Sam's hand lay on his arm.
Dean stretched his arm to the side and tried to reach his pistol.
"I...I'm not making fun of you," Sam stuttered, pressing his hand to his chest. "That damn hurt, like I was electrocuted!"
backed away. He dropped his arm and bit his lip, anger, horror, but also worry and doubt were reflected on his features.
"Don't worry, he'll be fine," he heard Sam say. "His body wasn't damaged. He's probably just knocked out, like me before."
Dean rolled around in his bed for hours without really being able to sleep. He felt like his entire body was on fire. Everything hurt him, every muscle...every nerve...everything was tense to the breaking point. With a groan, he straightened up and began pacing up and down the room. Restless, driven.
It was quiet in the car for a while, and Sam could literally see how it was working in Dean's head. He tried to figure out what had happened by going over the situation over and over again. But he didn't seem to notice what Sam assumed from the fact that there was no music playing yet, and Dean's knuckles turned white, so tightly was he clinging to the steering wheel.
After another fifteen minutes, he decided it wasn't really worth it to ponder this fact. So, in the old fashion, he pushed the disturbing thoughts into the background and finished his shower. After he was dried off and dressed, he went back into the room and dropped onto his bed.
In fact, there were two men, leaning loosely against a wall and between them a young woman - almost a girl, as Dean noticed it. He ran up to the three, and it quickly became clear that the woman didn't want anything to do with the two idiots.
Dean knew it was irrational! He wasn't lonely, Sam was always with him and Castiel often enough. This loneliness wasn't because he was really alone. The curse created that feeling, and he hated it. It wasn't like he always felt it anyway, like a gnawing in the back of his mind, but usually, he could suppress it, push it further into the background, and he was okay again. But with this curse, he couldn't do that...Whenever he thought he had pushed it into the background, it came back with a force that took his breath away, and as if that weren't enough, the guilty feelings about Sam were added.
"Damn it, Cas!" He yelled immediately and jumped up. "What are you doing here? Fuck...What if I fell on you!"
"I won't do it again, I promise."
Dean felt into himself and noticed how the need for touch became less - pushed into the background by the slight but permanent pain on his arm. However, it didn't go away and that made Dean reattach and cut the shard. After two minutes, there were six cuts on his arm. Each cut lessened the desire more and it made Dean smile happily...even if he knew that this was absolutely no reason to smile. It didn't take long before, with the force of a hammer blow, he realized what he had just done. What would the others say? He had to treat the wounds before anyone saw them.
"Of course," she smiled and let him get in first. "I don't meet a gentleman like you every day. I have to take advantage of that."
"What...do you want here?" Sam asked, slightly confused when Dean parked in front of a brothel.
"Damn it, yes! You should! But nothing can be done about that!" Bobby burst out and amazed everyone in the room when he pushed Castiel against the chest. "But that's normal for both of you! You just have to wear rose-colored glasses when it comes to the other!"
Here is the next chapter.
"I...I don't understand..." stuttered Dean and kept himself from pressing his head in Castiel's hand with all his might. "How can you...That's impossible..."
"With you and which army, fairy?" The smaller of the two wanted to know and a grin crept over his face as if he were putting on a distorted mask.
Castiel raised an eyebrow and stared at Dean. He waited for him to continue, but he didn't. The angel considered for a moment whether he should say something, or should offer his help one more time, but decided against it. He couldn't help Dean if he didn't allow it and he wouldn't. Dean's facial expression had changed from hurt to closed and Castiel had noticed it immediately. He turned away resignedly.
"I can't ignore it. I've tried. The desire grows stronger and I'm at the mercy of it...I can't..."
As quick as before, the rustling of wings sounded, and Castiel was kneeling next to them. His eyes hung briefly on Dean, then he looked over to Sam.
Dean's painful gasp let them both fall silent and turn to him again. Castiel reached out a hand to his forehead, but Dean dodged it - just with the last of his strength.
As soon as he was awake, his whole body was in tension. More than once Dean had believed his muscles or his skin would tear. But worst of all, he didn't know what to do about it! No matter what he did, the feeling stayed. Just like the need to call Sam or Castiel and tell them where he was. Simply because he wanted them close, wanted to hug them.
"If you had stayed with us, you would know why that is possible," growled Castiel, got up without looking at him and walked to the door.
"Need...just a little...sleep...morrow is better...I'm fine..." he stuttered.
"Your spells don't help you anymore, bitch," he growled.
"I couldn't stop him," Sam replied and got down on his knees next to Castiel. "He just wanted to help you..."
"Getting worse and worse. He took his own room for the last night, just because Cas healed him and I think he started drinking again..." Sam mumbled so as not to draw attention to his words.
He took his time in the shower, at least in terms of their circumstances. He just stood under the water stream for a full thirty minutes and didn't even really notice how it was getting colder.
As soon as Dean was alone, he let out a scream and wrapped his arms around himself. The tears, which he had held back, now took over and ran unstoppably down his cheeks. He allowed it - there was no one left to see him. All the pent-up feelings of the last few days dug their way out of the hole in which Dean had buried them. Doubt, fear, self-loathing, guilt...and loneliness, especially loneliness.
With his hands hanging between his knees, he must have looked like a pile of misery. He could feel the pitty looks of his brother and friend, so he straightened his back a little and looked at the two. Sam looked back worried, and Cas...Cas looked as if he knew what was coming next.
Dean should probably be scared, but he wasn't. On the contrary, he felt something like relief. The curse couldn't be broken without hurting Cas and Sam and he wouldn’t be able to bear it much longer, not to see them...so the vengeful witch came just right. He couldn't end his life, he had tried - sat on the bed for half an hour with the gun to his head and couldn't pull the trigger. But this witch would certainly not show any mercy.
"I know, but still try to focus with the other part of your body, okay?"
"No...I...I have..." stuttered Dean and turned so that Castiel could no longer see his arm.
Her job, if you could call it that, had always been tough. They saw things that others couldn't even imagine. Fought things that others never even dreamed of in their nightmares, and each time they came back to the motel rooms a little more broken. They didn't complain because if they weren't fighting the monsters, who should? Yes, there were other hunters, and they did a good job too - still, there were just too many monsters out there. If when, after all that, it was also claimed that they hurt innocent people...young women! Dean would rather chop off his own hands than do something to an innocent woman, whether she was a prostitute or had any different job.
"I know, I..."
Without even looking at them, he went to the girl and offered her his jacket. She took it with a smile and thanked him.
Dean was uneasy about this fact. With a shudder, he pulled his knife from her chest and turned. Sam got up and picked up the gun again.
"Why are there only freaks running around here today?! What was that supposed to mean?! I'll beat them up so that I have the doll to myself and can hurt it?!" she yelled at him hysterically and backed away as he took a step she closed.
, whispered a voice in his mind,
"I'll follow you. Baby is outside, and you couldn't take me with you either way...you can't touch me."
Dean hated how much his voice was trembling and how hard he had to try not to burst into tears again. God how much he hated that curse and himself for it. How could one be so stupid and believe a witch would save her life rather than destroy the life of her murderer?
Sam stood with his back against a shelf, the pistol out of reach on the floor. In front of him one of the werewolves, who had raised their clawed hand to tear Sam apart.
He could see how Cas's gaze wandered to his arm and indicated a guilty smile.
"Your brother isn't that tough is he?" Growled one of the werewolves.
Stella sank to the floor and stared up at Dean, who returned her gaze mercilessly. He could see the light in her eyes slowly fade. But even as that was happening, he heard how she mutter words. Words he didn't understand...magic words.
"Lovesick fool..." growled Bobby shaking his head.
"Get in," he just growled instead and disappeared inside the house.
"Sounds very promising," said Dean as they parked in front of the pub.
"That stupid idiot is more likely to kill himself than hurt any of us," Bobby growled as he spread a map of the area on his desk. "Which is not wrong in itself...but just shit in this situation!"
"Oh, nonsense. I can't let you walk around here on your own. What if the two idiots wake up again, or there are more of that kind here. I won't bite either, I promise."
The whisper started again, and with every word, Dean believed that he was getting weaker. His arms got so heavy that they just drooped, his mind got slow-moving and sticky, like honey.
"Dean," the angel's rough and calming dark voice tore him out of his panic. "Sam is fine. He has no injuries. His body and mind just couldn't take the pain and has...shut down? Can you say that?"
"Why shouldn't I want to talk to you anymore? I've put your body and mind back together and healed you dozens of times," Castiel made a vague gesture in the direction of Dean's body. "There's nothing I haven't seen and even touched if you want to call it that."
"Dean."
"Dean!" Castiel's voice startled him.
Dean nodded and got out. He really didn't want that. Most of the girls who worked in such a shady facility were treated badly and he knew that very well. Many weren't even there freely. But the urge for release clouded his thoughts so much he just couldn't help it. He just wanted to 'blow off some steam' and then they could go on.
And that left the angel pretty cold. He put two fingers against Dean's forehead and briefly closed his eyes. Dean just waited for a bright light to blind him and the angel to die, because that was exactly what would happen, now that another week had passed...Bobby had warned him. Tears welled up in his eyes, he didn't want to be the reason for Castiel's death!
Stella was a well-built woman; the curves were all in the right place, as Dean immediately noticed. Her long black hair fell over her shoulders like a waterfall, and Dean could have sworn they were moving in a (definitely non-existent) breeze. He unconsciously licked his lips and earned a slap from his brother for it.
A shout from the entrance of the brothel caught his attention. Which poor lunatic had crossed the lines of the house rules? Sam knitted his eyebrows in confusion when he saw who was being led outside by the bouncer, held by the collar of his shirt. Dean tore himself away from the man and threw him a few sharp insults, as Sam suspected based on his gestures and facial expressions. Then he pulled his shirt right and trudged towards the car.
Just a blink of an eye later, Castiel collapsed and remained motionless on the floor. Sam immediately crouched down next to him and shook him.
With that been said, he grabbed the first aid kit and went back into the bathroom.
It was the smaller of the two. He ran up to Dean, took a swing, and was almost simultaneously hit by Dean's fist below the chin. He let out a sound of pain that could be compared to a grunt and fell to one side.
"You apparently tried to hide just from the gaze of a certain witch. Not exactly smart to treat the sigils in such a way that they only prevent a certain person from discovering you."
"Don't talk shit. I know what it sounds like when you scream in pain," growled Dean. "Stop trying to pamper me! I can handle the truth very well."
"Long enough to see Dean's reaction...He's really not doing well with this whole situation."
He knew that Castiel was wrong because he had seen the looks which his brother threw the angel. The glow in his eyes when he talked about him. Dean never said something about it...hell Sam wasn't even sure if Dean himself was aware that he loved Castiel!
"He will probably be tired and have a headache. But otherwise, everything is fine with him."
He gave her a confused look, but then he recognized the dagger in her hand. Fast and almost panicked, he looked at Dean and his eyes darkened when he saw the wounds on his body.
“So, about next week… “, Dean resumed, once he started the car. “Since the weather is still warm, we could do something outside, like a basketball game or something. We can do more art projects inside later in the winter,” he suggested.
If the children seemed to enjoy the games, being cooperative and nice, the pie at the end definitely satisfied them.
“I told them about April - not about the fact that she was a reaper that had tried to kill me, obviously, but about the fact that I had sex with her. So I know that my body is able to procreate, but…I didn’t really want it, and didn’t really enjoy it. I thought that maybe it was because I wasn’t interested in her, and that’s why my coworkers suggested that I try with other people, that I could meet on this dating app”.
Balthazar almost choked on his coffee, really surprised. He stared at Cas with wide eyes.
“Of course I’d love that, Dean,” he answered very softly – more softly than he expected.
Balthazar chuckled. “I’m sorry, April, but don’t get your hopes up for Cas.”
“No, I did it on my own. When I was working at the Gas-n-Sip, one of my coworkers gave me the name of the app. She said it could help me to…”
He stared at Dean, trying to imagine them naked, hugging, and... no. Still not. The image didn't look awful to him, it was something he could consider… in the distant future. But in the immediate future, or right at that moment, no, he couldn't imagine anything like that happening. It was quite disturbing, though, because he would have liked for Dean to put his arm around his shoulders or to hug him, for example. He was sure that he would find warmth and comfort there, in his arms. Romantic attraction? Sensual perhaps? Perhaps he should ask the other members of the LGBT+ association the following Sunday at the next meeting.
“Yes, I am. But don’t worry, I’m sure you’ll find plenty of other ladies to keep you company, I won’t be missed!”
Cas smiled, trying to look cool and appealing. In other circumstances, he would have been happy to feel such a warm welcome from new acquaintances, but here, he just felt a little bit embarrassed. Besides, the fact that all the attention was on him prevented Cas from doing what he really wanted to: see Dean’s reaction when Balthazar announced that Cas was gay. However, he had lost sight of Dean in the crowd. Balthazar’s friends surrounded him, asking whether he played poker, what he was studying, and other details that Cas didn’t think were important when getting to know other students at parties.
“Okay, I think everyone’s here, we can begin. Please, I’d like you all to meet Cas, who’s attending one of our meetings for the first time.”
He walked towards the door. Cas thought the moment was definitely over, and he looked at Dean leaving the room, trying to collect his thoughts about what had just happened, when, suddenly, Dean stopped. He looked back over his shoulder and caught Cas' gaze once more.
He reached out to put the scarf around Cas' neck. He held both sides of the scarf in his hands for a few moments, encircling Cas, standing just inches away from him, in a gesture that Cas perceived as extremely intimate. It was as if time had stopped, and the two of them settled into a comfortable silence, smiling softly in the dark, paying no attention to the commotion outside the car as the students rushed into the arena.
Dean suddenly seemed to remember he was there.
“Do you want to go to the library to start working on our next assignment?” Cas suggested.
Cas noticed Dean's change in tone and attitude, and although it was what he had originally wanted, he was almost disappointed. Even though they embarrassed him, and even though he didn't know how to react and respond to them, he liked Dean's flirty little lines. It was fun, and it was exhilarating in a way. No one had ever acted like that with him before, and he couldn't believe that this could happen to him, that someone would be interested enough, pay enough attention to him, to take the time to tease him and to flirt with him a little bit. Even though that was Dean's natural attitude and he acted that way with everyone, and even though, to Dean, Cas wasn't special, Cas felt special when Dean winked at him. Even though it was his thirtieth wink of the day, all the others addressed to different people, for Cas, it was the first.
Cas hadn't decided yet whether he'd go to the LGBT+ Society meeting. As the week passed, he started to tell himself that maybe he wouldn't go to this week’s meeting, but maybe the next one. However, deep down, he knew that if he put it off once, he'd do it again the next time. Besides, Charlie Bradbury was expecting him this week, not next week. He knew that excuse wasn't valid: Charlie seemed like a nice person and probably wouldn't mind if he came later in the month, or even never at all. He didn't know her, and he surely didn't owe anything to her. No, if he decided to go, it had to be on his own initiative.
Hesitantly, Cas raised his gaze to look at Dean; as always, he was immediately struck with the greenness and depth of Dean’s eyes. He looked comforting. Dean smiled, and Cas shyly imitated him.
“I know but… It’s just that I never celebrated Christmas, and, behind all the God’s symbol, it just seems to be a universal human holiday and tradition, and, as I’m losing my powers, I wanted to do something to be closer to humans, I guess…. But anyway, it doesn’t matter, I didn’t succeed. My first try of cookie burned, and I just spilled the second, and now I don’t have enough ingredients, and I guess it means I’ll just never be enough human… I’m sorry you saw something Christmas related, I’ll just let you cook and then I’ll clean the kitchen and stay in my room. It was a stupid idea, and…”.
“I would definitely trust you, Cas. I definitely do trust you,” Dean affirmed with strength. With the strength that Cas didn’t have. Confidence was radiating out of Dean. Looking at him made Cas feel grounded, and better, and less worried. As if Dean had enough strength for both of them. Dean took  a step in his direction, and they were really close to each other, now, and he kept looking at him, sharing his confidence with him. Time stopped for a moment, and the only thing Cas could think of was Dean, and his eyes. Nothing else mattered, and he wished the moment would never stop. It felt so good, so comfortable, so relaxed. Little by little, he saw something else in Dean’s gaze; behind the calm, the confidence, the strength, there was also a hint of fondness, and Cas felt his heart melt. Dean smiled, very slowly, almost shyly, and Cas imitated him without even thinking about it. They didn’t need to talk; they were just good, here, and Cas felt as if they could stay like that forever.
“Is it okay if I…?”
taste and decide whether I like it or… love it," Cas maliciously blurted out.
“Wow, who are you and what did you do to Dean Winchester?” Charlie had laughed – and everyone had looked at Cas at the same time. He had blushed a little, but fortunately, Dean had quickly brought up another topic, and then Cas wasn’t the center of attention anymore. And now, they were in Dean’s car, talking about the next day.
Dean looked at him, and his eyes were full of something different that Cas never seen in him before. He looked so vulnerable, at that moment, and it completely contrasted with the strong overconfident guy holding the wheel of his collection car five minutes earlier. Dean offered him a weak smile.
“Everything all right here?”
“Yeah,” Dean agreed. “I’m glad you enjoyed the game! And don’t forget that I still need to teach you how to play poker!”
And suddenly, it struck him. He was in love with Dean. Of course, it shouldn’t have been big news. He had known for a while that he had a big crush on him. But he had tried to hold back as much as he could, to stop himself from letting it happen. However, at that moment, he realized he couldn’t hold back anymore; he couldn’t ignore it, he couldn’t lie to himself anymore. He thought he had already been in love before; and maybe he had been. But this time, it was completely different, completely new, because he loved Dean with a strength that was beyond his understanding. And, for the first time, he felt that maybe, maybe Dean shared this feeling. Otherwise, he wouldn’t look at him that way. He wouldn’t be so nice, so gentle, so tender. His voice wouldn’t be so soft. He wouldn’t care about him so much. He couldn’t have made it up! This had to be real, or at least a part of it.
Balthazar only came home a few hours later – long after the pie had been delivered and eaten.
“I heard Benny isn’t there tonight? Maybe I can come home with you?” she said, suggestively. “Wouldn’t it be a good idea, baby?”
Dean frowned. “Well, Charlie is involved in three societies, and I come with her to two of them, so I guess that you met at the third one? So people really find your meetings useful, Charlie?”
“Yeah, I think I figured that out.” Dean smiled gently.
Cas shook his head. No, no, he couldn't start thinking like that, it was dangerous. He was already completely falling for Dean, he didn't need to start imagining things, and having hopes that would inevitably disappoint him in the long run.
“Yes, he’s very beautiful, and I enjoy looking at him. I guess I’d like to be close to him, emotionally speaking. But I do not feel any desire to have sex with him. I can’t even imagine it!”
Cas was conflicted: on one hand, he was enjoying the evening a lot. On the other hand, he kept wondering if something was going to happen after all. He realized he would be disappointed if nothing happened. It was the ideal opportunity, and he was sure that with anyone else, Dean would take advantage of it. So what, he was flirty with everyone, except him? These thoughts were preventing Cas from fully enjoying the evening, and he wished he could fight them.
Cas nodded. “That’s true. That was a good idea.”
Sam's expression softened.
“Yeah, I just need to clear my mind. Don’t wait for me, okay?”.
“Perfect, see you tonight then!”
It was too bad there was nothing he could do about it.
“I’m glad you agreed to come, Cas. I had a great time.”
“Why only half of the university? You know I play for both teams… That doubles my chances of getting lucky every time I go out!”
He jumped and turned around quickly, feeling himself blushing, as if he had been caught doing something wrong. A thin girl with long red hair was looking at him in a very kind way.
A little bit surprised, because he wasn’t expecting Dean to tell him that at all, Cas held his gaze. After a few moments, Dean broke the visual contact, shaking his head, going back to his usual playful expression.
Cas made one step towards Dean and tilted his head :
Cas had not expected that. He was stunned for a few moments, before regaining his composure. “If you like black plain coffee, I guess that you’re not a fan of sweet flavors, so I guess a black tea would be fine for you. I usually drink it with milk and sugar, but you can drink it without that if you prefer.”
Cas smiled. Talking with Dean was so easy! At first, he had been a little bit anxious, not really knowing what to answer, how to answer, but now the conversation was flowing.
Cas froze. Dean? He quickly shook the idea away. There was more than one Dean on this campus; there was no way that the Dean from the Children of Lawrence community program was the Dean he had met yesterday.
“Yes, Dean?”
He didn’t know what he meant what “we’ll fix this”. Was he only talking about the cookie? Fortunately, Cas let it go, and started to leave, taking his coat and his jacket.
Was he really flirting with Cas on a dating app? Maybe the last shot of whiskey he took had been too much, after all.
Dean jumped and almost dropped his beer. He straightened, eyes closed. Just his luck,  the last person he wanted to see was here.
His phone buzzed.
“You’re doing good with the children,” Dean assured. “And you know, for the anxiety… It can actually be good. It means you care, and it means that you’ll do your best. And I’d rather be medically treated by someone who cares than by someone who’s not 100 percent focused on his task.”
"Well, we'd better get moving if we're going to get there before the game starts!"
“At 7. We are going to order pizzas, so feel free to join us if you’re hungry. There won’t be too many of us – maybe a dozen? And I don’t think we’re going to play too late – maybe until 2 am?”
“For sure, he’s not a nice person. He has a high idea of himself, he’s pretty haughty. But he’s not dull, I was actually having a very interesting conversation with him before… before you interrupted us!”
Meg was his lab partner and his only friend – except for Balthazar – in university. He was very polite with all of his classmates, but wasn’t really close to them. Soon, they began to ignore him, only saying “hello” and “goodbye”, but not trying to make small talk with him anymore. Except for Meg, who, for some reason, had been clinging to him since their freshman year first lab. At the beginning, Cas had thought maybe she was interested in him – and Balthazar had teased him a lot about it. But he had made clear to her that he didn’t like girls, and she stayed by his side. Those first months he had been quite annoyed by her – she was so different from him! Witty, overconfident, provocative, and not afraid to be loud and noticed by other students, when Cas was desperately trying to fit in. But now he was used to it. And he liked her. To be fair, classes would be much more boring without her.
“So,” he began, grinning proudly, “what do you think about her?”
He would like to talk about it with Dean again, at some point. But how could he broach the topic? And wouldn’t it be too boring for Dean? Once again, the guy wasn’t his therapist. He probably had other problems – and probably more important problems than Cas!
“Indeed, he’s a very nice guy.”
He had chosen the color of the polo shirt he would wear while he was in the shower to prevent him from going through a new existential crisis. A light blue one that would match with his dark blue jacket and his dark jeans. He checked the time. 1:15. He only needed fifteen minutes to walk to the campus and reach the building where the meeting was taking place, but he didn’t want to risk being late. He drank a glass of water and put his small notebook, a pen, some tissues, the cereal bar, and his wallet in his jacket pocket. He tried to think about what he might have forgotten, but couldn’t think of anything.
“Good idea,” Dean nodded. “Yeah. We can do that.”
“Hello Dean,” Cas answered soberly.
Suddenly, they didn’t seem that incompatible. Suddenly, a wave of hope greater than ever swept over Cas. The feeling was everywhere in his body: it started from his chest and spread to the rest of his body. His legs felt weak, his hands were almost shaking, his head was tingling, his cheeks were reddening.
“My knee”, the kid winced.
“Now you’re the one being mean, Dean!”
Hearing Cas’ name, Dean immediately turned to face them and locked eyes with Cas. Cas held the stare, trying not to blush.
“I’m glad you decided to finally come,” Balthazar told him on their way to the bar. “I actually never thought this day would come!”
It turned out that the first “Doctor Sexy binge-watching night” was the first of many. Cas didn’t expect to like the show; in the beginning, he agreed because it allowed him to spend more time with Dean, and because Dean was so excited about it, and Cas loved seeing him like that, enthusiastic and happy. However, he quickly got caught up in the show, and even though he still pointed out every medical error – which made Dean roll his eyes “that’s not the main point of the show Cas!” – he had to admit that it was pretty addictive, and soon he looked forward to those watch nights not only for Dean, but also to discover what would happen to the characters.
Stevie probably did it on purpose, but they ended their presentation on asexuality.
Dean sat in the other seat, between Benny and him. There was still one seat free, next to Benny, but there was a coat on it – a coat that, once again, seemed familiar to Cas.
The mention of Dean’s name made Cas blush instantly. He cursed himself: he was behaving like a twelve-year old having their first crush!
“Yeah. We’re a good team,” Dean observed, echoing Cas’ thoughts.
Cas blinked, trying to come to his senses. A very worried Dean was kneeling just in front of him, very close to his face. He raised his hand towards Cas’ head, before stopping his gesture, uncertain. Their eyes met, and Cas got a flashback of their first meeting. Apparently, Dean remembered the same thing. He dropped his hand, smiling shyly.
However, that was not the point. If he ever decided to have sex, it would be in the context of a long-term relationship. And he wasn’t in such a relationship with Dean – he was far from it, in fact. And Dean’s entire behavior screamed that he wasn’t looking for one.
“Dean. I’ll be with only one kid when you’ll have to handle nine of them. I’m the one who should be asking you that question!”
After a moment, Dean removed his hand and cleared his throat.
“Which problem?”
He winked at her (so he didn’t only wink at Cas; it was his normal behavior. Good to know). And Meg turned crimson.
Cas swallowed. He mechanically and nervously bit his lips, and he felt Dean's gaze drop slightly, following the movement. The air was very charged, tense, and Cas' brain could no longer function.
“I guess I’ll let you alone for the rest of the week, then… If you need me, I’ll be in my room. I… Have a nice day, Dean.”
“I’m not sure yet. I want to be useful, and to help people. I don’t like to see people suffering, so I like the idea of having the power to heal them. But I know I also tend to be pretty awkward with people, and very anxious in general, so I hope that won’t prevent me from doing the job… I’d have to interact with lots of patients, daily, and I’m not even sure that’s something I can do…”
“Um. Surprising,” Raphael commented.
“Good job, partner!” Meg greeted Cas after they left their lab.
“Okay,” Cas said. “Let’s go to your room, then.”
Cas shook his head.
“I always have felt some… fondness towards you, Dean,” Cas smiled. “A different kind of connection than the one I had with Sam, for example. But I always thought it was because of me rescuing you in hell, that it was linked to some angelic bond that I’d have with you. However, even as a human, how I feel about you is different than with other people. And much, much stronger than when I was an angel. And believe me, Dean, it was - and it still is - very confusing”.
The Kansas Jayhawks ended up winning the game. Charlie and Dean didn’t bring up the topic of the LGBT+ society again, and joked as if nothing had happened – so the argument probably wasn’t serious. And Dean was adorable for the rest of the game, telling Cas fun facts about the players or previous games, enthusiastically cheering the university team, playfully joking with his friends.
Cas tilted his head. “If you’re tired, maybe you shouldn’t drink a beer. A glass of hot milk or some herbal tea would help you to fall asleep more easily, I think.”
They drove in silence, Cas not daring asking Dean where they were going. The hunter finally parked at a Walmart.
“Plus the two of us,” Dean added.
Cas’ eyes widened as Dean talked. It meant that he wasn’t angry or disappointed. He still cared about Cas. He was still worried about him. Maybe he hadn't ruined everything in the end?
Still, buying some Christmas supplies with Cas and baking some cookies with him, without going “full Christmas”, was already a small step. Maybe next Christmas, the situation would be fixed.
, and he'd been through enough changes lately. He still needed some markers, signs that, even though he'd lost his powers, he hadn't completely changed.
Dean's heart was pounding, and he was having trouble keeping a clear head. Fortunately, there was little traffic at this time of night, otherwise he could have quite easily caused an accident. Cas wanted to talk to him, and he didn’t seem angry. He just seemed…Cas. Their small conversation had been enough to change Dean’s plans. He initially had thought he would meet Cas to prepare him for his date with Tom, to warn him against him, maybe… However, now, he was the one who almost had a date with him. Dean smirked. If only Tom knew that!
"Hello, Dean. Your food is in the fridge."
“And you should definitely take advantage of that to show who you are! Don’t wear something that you think people want you to wear, but something you like to wear.”
“Baby’s my car, not me,” Dean growled.
What was he going to wear? He usually wore shirts, but nice shirts, and maybe he would appear snobby if he came wearing an expensive shirt, and people would hate him…This was a volunteer program to help poor families. He shouldn't look too rich, otherwise people would wonder what he was doing there…Poor people hated rich people like his family, and maybe they would think he was there to brag, to show how rich he was and how much better than them he was…And that was it, he was sure that everybody would hate him. Why had he signed up for this program in the first place? It was definitely a stupid idea. The stupidest idea he had ever had, probably. Why did he decide to inflict that on himself when no one had forced him? However, today wasn’t a proper volunteer session with children; it was only a meeting, so was it more formal? No one would come to a formal meeting underdressed. He would look as if he was being disrespectful or didn’t care about the program if he wore clothes that were too casual. In general, it was better to be overdressed than underdressed, wasn’t it? People didn’t know him; it was his first and only chance to make a good impression. The way he would be dressed today would probably determine what the other volunteers would think about him and how his volunteer experience would go for the entire year. The stakes were high. And he only had one hour to decide before he had to leave. What should he do?
He was awakened by noises outside his room. He opened his eyes, blinked, and sat up looking around, trying to get back in touch with reality. He had fallen asleep without closing the curtains, but it was dark. He looked at his phone: it was 8, which meant Baltazar’s friends were already there. His roommate had sent him a text thirty minutes before: “pizzas are coming in 15, if you’re interested!” and then, twenty minutes later “pizzas are here!”. Cas grimaced slightly; he had planned to prepare some dinner around 6, before Baltazar’s friends arrived, and to eat in his room without having to small talk with the guests. He was tired and stressed for the next day and didn’t feel very social that evening. Unfortunately, he realized he was hungry, and would need to leave his room to reach the kitchen to prepare a sandwich or something. He grunted at the idea and grabbed his phone to scroll social media instead.
Dean knew he was wrong, and that he was just showing bad faith. It wasn't Sam's fault that he was freaking out because he had been stupid enough to sign up for a dating app and put in his profile that he was interested in men and came across Cas' profile. His defense mechanism was aggressiveness, it always had been. But there was no point in antagonizing Sam. So, admitting defeat, he lowered his head:
“True. But now I have to be as quick as you to solve yours!”
Cas stopped, turning to Dean.
Cas did it; Dean cupped his face with his hands and, very lightly, pressed his lips against his.
Cas nodded, glad he didn’t have to finish the question himself.
Cas grinned, delighted that Dean had suggested something he would be able to do. Buying some bottles of orange juices was within his capabilities. It wasn’t much, but he would feel useful bringing those.
« Precisely, Cas. That’s the point. What are we ? »
Yeah, it wasn’t the most conventional description for a dating app… But everything in it screamed, “Cas,” and Dean almost smiled. He would need to give Cas a lesson or two about flirting and romantic vocabulary.
“Maybe next time,” he answered.
Cas tilted his head, studying Dean’s backside. He didn’t see what was special about it. Did Meg find it attractive? Why? What was beautiful about Dean was his face, not his butt! He would prefer looking at his face than at his rear!
“You need any help with that?” Dean asked.
Cas went crimson and let out a little noise. “Oh, no, no, I wasn’t…I didn’t mean…Well, I meant…We’re gonna w-work together for the…for the entire year…With, you know, the volunteer project, since we’re in the same…” he stuttered, incredibly embarrassed.
He thought about the party the entire day. By 5:00 he still hadn’t made up his mind about it. He’d never been to such a party before, let alone in a bar. However, these past few weeks, he had gone out of his comfort zone, especially with the volunteering program, but also more generally, opening himself up to Dean for example, and it always benefited him. He knew he was making progress with his anxiety management, and he wanted to keep going in that direction. Besides, he was pretty curious to see Dean’s behavior in that kind of setting. So far, he’d mainly seen Dean with the children. He’d seen him alone, in his car, and at the first poker event with a few friends in a really casual and relaxed atmosphere. But he had heard about Dean’s partygoer reputation, and he wanted to witness it for himself to see if it was true or if people were overreacting. Plus, going to a party at a bar had been on his “student classics to-do list” for a while; so far he hadn’t acted on it because he had never had an opportunity. But at least, that was a good reason to try it tonight; if he didn’t like it, he could always go back home early. He didn’t need to stick with Balthazar.
As Cas was walking to his tutorial the following Monday, his attention was drawn once more to the poster of the Kansas University LBGT+ Society. He read the description again, stopping on “asexual.”
“You’re thinking about an outfit. Show me?”
“It was okay, don’t worry. You warned me before and your friends didn’t stay too long,” he smiled. “You’re allowed to host this kind of event again,” he joked.
“It just happened. I had just come back from my meeting with Tom when I received your message.”
Dean’s gaze darkened, and Cas wondered what had happened during his childhood. Was he from one of these poor families? Dean stopped talking and nervously ran a hand through his hair. He didn’t seem comfortable talking about that, so Cas decided to not push him by asking questions, even though he really wanted to know more about him. Instead, he gently addressed him with a supportive smile.
As always, they gathered in Bobby's living room. Dean stood at the window and stared out, Sam sat on the armchair in the corner and Castiel leaned against the door frame with his arms crossed in front of his chest. Bobby went to his desk and opened a large leather-bound book.
"You don't really think we'd mind, do you?" He wanted to know.
He had to get to his car. He made it with slow steps and fell heavily behind the wheel. The loss of blood clouded his brain and made thinking difficult. Nevertheless, he started the car and drove off.
Immediately the attention was on her, which brought a smile to her lips. Sam looked at her calculatingly for a moment, but then looked down again. Bobby just shook his head...but Castiel's look was pure fire! The blue shone so brightly you could think that lightning would flash through his eyes.
He was trudging through the dark streets when suddenly noises filled the silent air. He could hear two male voices and a woman who seemed to be protesting loudly against them. An almost malicious grin appeared on his lips as he stepped into the alley from which the voices came. If the two of them molested a woman, he would make them regret going out that evening and maybe even get rid of his pent-up anger.
Dean dodged the next blow simply by jumping to the side. At the same time, he reached out himself and thundered his fist into the attacker's temple. He went down with a distorted gasp and just lay there, too. It was always shocking how quickly people could be turned off, in contrast to the monsters he usually fought against.
"Isn't it enough that you passed out last night and that only because you touched me?" Dean yelled on and was absolutely not letting himself put off.
It had been a week since he'd left - a bloody week. He had eaten almost nothing for that time and only drank when he was really thirsty. Besides, he hadn't slept...apart from the twenty to thirty minutes every now and then when his body and mind gave in. His sleep, however, was far from restful. He felt watched, like a hungry animal lurking in a dark corner of his mind, just waiting for him to become distracted. It lashed itself in his dreams and fell upon him like a wolf upon its prey. Each time he woke up with a scream and aimed his weapon in the empty room - firmly convinced there was a monster that wanted to eat him alive.
"It's okay...I'm fine, really."
"So actually it can last forever if it's not broken," said Cas.
Dean nodded but still looked down and went to his bed. Somehow it seemed to him Castiel would always apologize for him and that to himself. Idiot angel.
The smile was forced, and the tone of voice belied his words. Dean felt how anger rose in him, which was directed irrationally against Sam. He didn't understand why his brother had to lie in such a situation. It had hurt, otherwise, he wouldn't have screamed! Dean couldn't bear that he lied just to protect his feelings.
But before he could say anything, Castiel's fingers were already on his brother's forehead. At first, nothing happened, except that the bleeding stopped. Little by little the wounds on Dean's arms closed, and Sam began to doubt his skills of observation. However, he then looked at Castiel's face, which spoke volumes.
"Cas, I...I'm sorry that I..."
Carefully he put his hands on her shoulders and let them slide over her arms to her hips. He pulled Stella closer to him, even if he'd rather push her away. Her lips continued to travel down his neck, sucking and kissing below his ear. Just a moment later, Dean heard a whisper.
Dean snorted and downed the rest of his beer. Just as he was about to get up, he saw how Stella had a small pouch disappear into the jacket pocket of a man walking by.
He raised an eyebrow at his brother and waited for a reaction. Of course, he already knew what would come - they were brothers after all and had known each other long enough to foresee their reactions.
The answer came in the form of a fist that must have been aimed at his cheek but hit his shoulder. Dean stumbled back a few steps but caught himself before he could tip over and straightened up again.
Dean and Sam said goodbye to the others and sat down at a table with a good view of the bar.
"Now that's settled, could we talk about how we want to find Dean?" Asked Bobby in a serious voice.
Warning for slightly self harm in this chapter! It's not to graphic, but still there!
Castiel had no answer the next morning on how to break the curse. Not even two weeks later when they were on their way to see Bobby. He had searched so hard for answers as never before because he saw what the curse was doing in Dean. The last two weeks have been torture for Dean, and for him and Sam who couldn't do anything to help him.
"Dean Winchester, right?" She asked in a sugar-sweet voice that didn't really match her look.
To be on the safe side, he had painted the door of the motel room with a sigil, which would prevent angels from finding the place and one, so Rowena couldn't find him with any spell. He only left the room to get something to eat and drink...and the food ended up almost untouched in the garbage can.
"You just think too much."
"I just mean," she shrugged. "At least it shouldn't be difficult for him to find a girl he likes and who doesn't mind a little pain while doing the thing."
It was in no way different from the one he had shared with Sam. Just as tastelessly decorated, with the same dusty mattresses, ugly bed sheets, and the same disgusting bathroom.
"What would have happened if I would have fallen on you and you don't get out from under me?! What if the pain gets so much that you injure your vessel or worse, destroy it?! What if..."
He fought against the urge to go back inside. Because one thing was certain, in his current state, he wouldn't be able to fight against his feelings. He was going to hurt his family and he couldn't do that.
Dean gave him a withering look and he lowered his gaze, to stare at his feet. They both knew how much Dean hated this woman and how deep his distrust was towards her. Nevertheless, Castiel had contacted her because she was probably the only one who could help them.
"No, not a single one. I have no idea what it could be."
Without thinking about it for long, he threw himself to the foot of the bed where the intruder was sitting and hoped to knock them out before they could react. With horror, he realized that it was Castiel who sat there and looked at him in surprise. At the last second, Dean managed to throw himself to the side and landed on the floor, instead on top of the angel.
So this StepIn was their best clue. With a bit of luck, they would find their monster and be back at the motel before midnight.
In Castiel, however, actually raged a fire that threatened to devour everything of him. He didn't understand why Dean wouldn't let him help. After every damn insult and threat he threw at him again and again, he must hate him! Which meant that Castiel was in no danger of feeling any pain. So why the hell didn't Dean want to be touched? He couldn't be serious! There had to be a way he could help his friend anyway...Dean would die in this bed if he didn't do anything, and he couldn't let that happen. His heart was too attached to the man before him.
She hesitated a moment, but when Dean offered her his arm, she finally nodded and accept it. That said, she tried. As soon as her arm touched his, she let out a sharp scream and jumped back.
Dean got up from the bed and grabbed his jacket. If Sam wanted to make fun of him, he could do it alone. Before Sam could hold him back, Dean was on the other side of the door. He just couldn't get the face of the woman in the brothel out of his head. How she looked at him in shock, as if he had tried to force her to do something she didn't want, and now Sam had to make fun of it, pretending that his touch hurts in reality.
Dean opened his mouth to give a sharp answer, but Sam got ahead of him.
"Maybe she just didn't felt like it. Could be the case," Sam tried to offer an answer to the situation.
"Yes..."
"Save your apology, Dean! You don't mean it seriously!" Castiel roared.
On the way out, Sam tossed Dean the key and finally got into the car on the passenger side.
Nevertheless, they searched the courtyard for Dean, because it is well known that hope died last. Maybe Dean was rational for once and would listen to them. But everyone present knew Dean well enough to know that this was wishful thinking. He was gone and only God knew where he went...although they couldn't even be sure of that.
Both of them couldn't help but grin. Finally, one problem was solved, and they would really get back to the motel before midnight.
, thought Castiel and continued to look at the door.
"So what I've been able to find out, with the little information we have, is this: the curse just gets worse over time, and at some point, you won't care if you hurt others when you touch them. You will accept it without consideration. This curse is apparently designed to kill the people who are most important to the cursed. The pain of the loved ones increases the longer the curse lasts. If they only felt a pinch at the beginning, they will faint after a week or two and after four to five weeks it can cause death..."
There was a laugh and the woman came up to him. Her look radiated a hatred that Dean hadn't seen for a long time.
"Go ahead," said Phil, a guy who looked like a bear but seemed as tame as a lamb - he was something like the leader of this group.
"There are other aspects of the curse that you should know, Dean," Cas jumped in. "Depending on the words Stella used, the longer the curse lasts, the worse it gets. The second possibility is that you will gradually crave more and more touch, regardless of whether you really long for it or not. There will be a desire that can drive you crazy and..."
"Or we're too early." Dean slapped his brother playfully on the shoulder. "I'll earn some money for us."
"Okay! Okay, get out of here!" Sam interrupted him and waved his hand in the direction of the brothel.
"Man, I thought you want to grow webbed feet as long as you were in there," joked Sam, but Dean didn't respond, and that made his brother sigh.
a voice muttered in his head.
Dean looked up when Phil said that one word. Many people didn't know that witches really existed. Very few believed in them anyway...but some could feel such beings despite everything. They called them witches without even knowing it was true. It was a kind of sixth sense that he himself had, at least that's what the others said.
The whole trip, Dean hoped that Sam had seen them leave the bar. One thing was certain, he could use the knife in his pocket, but he didn't think Stella would let it get that far.
Castiel looked at him disapprovingly for a moment, but Dean knew what he had to do to convince the angel. He rubbed the back of his head with one hand and finally shook his head as if he were giving in.
He went deeper and deeper into the hall but kept a close eye on his surroundings. Nevertheless, he didn't see the movement next to him, and neither heard the soft crunch of sand under the soles of a shoe. It only took seconds until Dean hit a blow on the shoulder, and he was thrown against a box. The impact forced the air out of his lungs and left him staring at the ceiling for a moment, totally confused. Then he heard Sam scream and made his body move.
"Werewolf…"
He went up to Castiel with a threateningly outstretched finger, which made the Angel retreat unconsciously. Immediately Cas regretted this gesture and took step towards Dean. But Dean had noticed it and now
She stormed up to him and punched him on the left cheek. Dean felt how he bit his lip and blood collected in his mouth. The next moment she rammed the dagger into his left shoulder. Laughing, she turned it a little and watched as Dean tried doggedly not to scream. He could feel his muscles being cut and the blade scraping across bones. When she pulled it out, he screamed nevertheless.
Dean didn't respond. He just got out and walked around the car. From the trunk, he took his pistol, three magazines - with silver ammunition, of course - and a knife that was also made of silver. He threw the same things to Sam when he appeared next to the car.
“I like peanut butter sandwiches.”
It was very rare that Cas came to bother Balthazar when he was in his room. Both friends had tacitly agreed over the years, that their respective rooms were a place where they could be alone if they needed to be – an unspoken rule that Cas especially liked, being an introvert. However, he knew Balthazar wouldn’t mind talking to him – unlike him, his roommate was a very social person.
There was something about him, about the way he had looked at him, deeply, as if he was trying to read through him to understand the things Cas wasn’t saying. The way he had seemed to be genuinely worried that he had caused Cas to hit his head. The way he had spontaneously reached out to Cas, as if he cared about him and his well-being, even though he didn’t know him. The way he had offered to go and grab him some pizza from the living room. There was something really soft about him. But, on the other hand, he also looked like a confident guy, in control of the situation – or trying to be in the control of the situation anyway – joking with Balthazar, and even flirting with him?
“About things people do with their partners, but…I don’t know, as much as I’d love to feel close to you, to hold you in my arms, to watch you sleep, to hold your hand, to watch movies with you, to talk with you for hours… I just can’t picture myself having sex with you.”
Aaron smiled shyly, looking at the floor. Somehow, Cas could see himself in him. Not in every aspect, but he definitely felt as if he could relate to him. He hadn’t known what to expect before coming, but given the eccentricity of Charlie, and all the clichés, he kind of thought most of the students would be very stereotypical gays and lesbians, boys that were as eccentric as Charlie, wearing colorful clothes and maybe make-up – he had nothing against those boys, of course, but as someone who always tried to stay discreet, to perfectly blend into society, he couldn’t really relate to them. Aaron, on the other hand, seemed really ordinary; he was wearing regular jeans, and a sweatshirt in a neutral tone with a black coat. He seemed to be an introvert, like Cas. He wondered what his story was, but of course, didn’t ask. He would probably progressively learn more about everyone’s stories as the meeting went, he thought.
Dean stared at Cas, dumbfounded.
“8 to 10-year olds seem good to me," he agreed. “And for the time…Not too early on Saturday morning, I assume?”
However, he also knew that he couldn’t keep going like he was, pretending he didn’t care about his asexuality, that he was probably thinking that way because he was too young, or because he never tried or met anyone that was worth it. Now, he knew it wasn’t true: Dean was worth it. If he really had to have sex with someone, he would choose Dean without hesitation. If he was in a relationship with Dean, he could picture sleeping with him, since it was important for Dean. But only in the context of a loving relationship, as an act of love, of intimacy, to feel close to him emotionally and physically. He was a little curious about it as well. It seemed to be such a big deal for other people that he wondered whether it was really
“Per-perfect,” Cas nodded. “Have a nice evening!”
They sat together at the kitchen table and began to eat in comfortable silence. It was something Cas liked about Balthazar: he didn't feel compelled to make small talk with him.
Meg looked surprised. “You don’t?”
“That’s a good idea. And a great way to get the kids on our side from the beginning."
The ex-angel gave him a suspicious look. “Are you listening to me?”
“Guilty as charged," Dean admitted. “Seriously, I’m sorry, Jody."
What;s more, if Cas had texted him, especially so soon after they matched, it meant he wasn’t too angry at Dean about the shaving incident. Dean felt relieved for a minute, until he came to another conclusion: if Cas had sent him a message so soon after Dean swiped right on his profile, it meant Cas probably had been using his phone at that moment… and had probably been on the app. Dean thought about Tom again, and the fact that he wanted to ask Cas on a date, and that he wanted to see Cas, meet him to be his “instructor”, and somehow, that did not seem okay for Dean. He had to go back to the bunker to tell Cas about that. Cas had no idea of how relationships worked. Maybe Tom would expect things from him that Cas wasn’t ready to offer him. Tom seemed to be a nice guy, but Dean didn’t know enough about him to let him date Cas. Cas was still fragile, still getting used to being human. He didn’t need to bother about a new relationship in addition.
“Because I don’t deserve it, obviously!”
Cas’ eyes opened wide. “Really? Why do you think that?”
“Good night,” Lisa answered without even looking at him, too busy embracing Dean.
Cas nodded, slightly disappointed – even though he had no right to be disappointed: he should have asked him quicker – “Yes, thank you again! We…”, he stopped, hesitant. “We should do that again sometime. I enjoy spending time with you.”
Soon enough, Dean texted him and he was there, and Cas almost ran outside to meet him.
“You can look at it later. Listen to the TA!” he whispered to Meg, who ignored him.
Dean frowned. "But no, I mean, Cas, I had planned to spend the evening here with you... It wasn't an obligation...". The features of his face darkened, the shadow of a sudden realization passing through his eyes: "Wait... was it one for you? An obligation?” he asked, a hint of disappointment in his voice (or perhaps it was Cas extrapolating?).
As they walked a few steps down the sidewalk, going away from the bar, Dean's voice, a little more hoarse than usual, called out to Cas one last time.
Cas blushed briefly and cursed himself for his choice of words.
“Guys, sit down, the game’s starting!” said a boy that was sitting next to Charlie. Cas didn’t know him.
Through the tears, Dean finally allowed himself to have a weak smile. He could feel that Cas wouldn’t let him down, that he could have faith in him. So, yes, maybe things were still complicated between them. He acted like a fool, he didn’t respect Cas, he hurted him. But now, he knew he could trust him. He knew that Cas would help him to go through everything. He knew Cas would help him to figure out what they were. And most importantly, he knew they were real, and at this moment, it was all that matters.
“I noticed you acted strangely last week, but I couldn't understand why either. Because I knew it wasn’t because of FIFA.”
Dean glanced at the clock that was on the wall behind Cas.
Even though Cas wasn't looking at Dean, staring fixedly at the menu boards behind the counter, he could feel Dean's eyes on him, which was enough to make him slightly blush. He couldn’t help but take a glance at Dean. The young man had his arms folded and was staring at him, a smile on the corner of his lips as if he was only waiting for the moment when Cas was going to catch him looking and meet his eyes. Cas gave him a questioning look.
And he began to walk, very quickly. Cas scampered behind him, trying to not lose him in the crowd of students that were all walking towards the arena. Suddenly, Dean turned around, noticing that Cas was a little bit behind. He reached out and grabbed his hand, dragging him towards him.
Dean gave him the coat.
And thank you to A., who made me discovering Supernatural, helped me figuring out I was ace when I was questioning, and listened to me talking about "More than one ace to play" even though they don't like fanfiction.
“Hello, Dean," Cas answered, blushing.
Dean grinned. "Oh, you have no idea! I love watching movies, it's one of my passions, that's why I'm letting you choose. I couldn’t choose myself right now, there are so many options and so many genres that I like… I'm sure I'll enjoy whatever you pick! Besides, we started the evening with baking, which was my activity. Now it's your turn to choose something you like! Surprise me!"
“Thanks, I wasn’t really sure. To be honest, I almost texted you to ask you what you’d be wearing, and ask for advice, and then I thought it wasn’t important enough, and…”
“You know, Cas, if you ever want to talk… I’m here.”
Cas was searching his bag to grab the book when the door of the coffee shop opened. Automatically he looked in that direction, and his heart missed a beat. The new customer was Dean. And of course, he was accompanied by a very beautiful girl.
“Tea isn’t boring. There are a lot of varieties, a lot of recipes, you have to be careful when brewing it so that it’s not too strong and that the taste is perfect, you can add milk, mix flavors…”
He stood up, leaving the plate – still half full – in the kitchen. He would deal with it later. Or Balthazar would. His roommate would guess what had happened. It wasn’t the first time. And now that he had a plan, Cas was afraid that diverting from it, even for two minutes to throw the uneaten food away, would trigger a new crisis. He showered quickly, repeating the plan in his head. He pictured the polo shirt he would wear, thought about the kind of cereal bar he would take with him, went through the streets he would have to take to get to the meeting building.
“You don’t understand, Sam. I broke him. I broke Cas. He got scared of me when I caught him cooking earlier! How the hell did we get here? How did I screw up so badly? What is wrong with me?”
. But as if it was nothing important. Cas was still explaining his reasoning, and Dean had no other choice than to listen to him:
“Okay, well, I’ll be in my room. Have a nice evening!”
Preparing for the “non-date” was fun. More fun than Cas expected. He would have thought he’d be paralyzed with anxiety, but the anticipation and the excitement supplanted the worries. He was still worrying and overanalyzing, of course. But it wasn’t as bad as it could have been. Besides, he trusted Dean and he knew things couldn’t completely go wrong. Even if he didn’t know Dean’s friends. If they didn’t like him, well… it was their loss. And if he didn’t like them… at least he would be with Dean. He was going to be with Dean – and to learn basketball rules, he tried to remind himself – not to make new friends, after all. Plus, they would all be watching the game. He wouldn’t have to struggle to make conversation with strangers. He could just say something about the game. He was a little more afraid about the dining part before the game, but the group would probably all talk together and maybe not even notice him.
“Hey there," she said. "Are you here for the Children of Lawrence community program?”
“Wait, what? No, I wasn't angry at Dean because of a video game, Ben!” Cas defended himself, both shocked and amused that the kids elaborated such theories on his behaviours. Really, the kids saw more things than the adults expected. Luckily, they were still innocent enough to think it was only because he was a sore loser.
“Did you need to talk to him? Otherwise you can just give me his case, and I’ll put it in his room.”
He stared at his phone, incredulously, before something even more surprising happened: his phone buzzed, and the words “Hello, Dean” appeared next to Cas’ picture.
As often, overthinking the situation tired him out, and he eventually fell asleep.
“Yes, the funniest, indeed, don’t ever change, Cas! Or should I say, Mr. Serious!”
Oh. Dean let his hand, which was still resting on his knife in his pocket, slide down his body. If he hadn't been sitting down, he would surely have become dizzy. He had expected anything but this. Now he did remember swiping right on the profile of a certain Tom, who was only about ten kilometers away from him. But seriously, what was the probability that, a) Tom had also liked his profile, b) that they were in the same bar, at the same time, two days later, and c) that Tom recognized him immediately?
“Hm. Yes, why not!”
“That’s fine. And anyway, you found out the answers, so you deserve the reward!” Dean announced cheerfully, clapping his hands and leaning down to grab his backpack.
Suddenly he found himself wondering:
He heard Dean’s voice, but because of the noise all around him, he couldn’t get what he was saying.
“Watching some cartoons that I didn’t even recognize – I’m telling you, man, we’re getting old!”
Cas’ heart skipped a beat. Making theories in his head, hoping on his own that maybe Dean could like him back was one thing, but hearing Balthazar, who was neutral about the situation, who knew both of them, and who was quite skeptical about the possibility of a relationship between them, say it out loud was something else. Something that made it more real, somehow.
Balthazar gave him a concerned look. “You okay, Cas?”
“Hey Dean over here!”
“Yeah, that’s what you told me yesterday, all the things we could do together, like holding hands, hugging, watching TV, kissing,“ Dean confirmed. “And asexual? I’m not exactly sure what it means exactly, but it does sound like what you described yesterday, don’t you think?”
“No, no, don’t worry. A new guy in the club, Raphael, is hosting.”
The hunter didn’t even bother to look at him.
Dean was standing in the doorway. His face wasn’t showing any emotion, but Cas didn’t pay much attention. For less than one second, he met Dean’s eyes, but he looked away immediately. He couldn’t go through that. It was a nightmare. So he did the first thing that came to his panicking mind: he ran away. Literally, he began to run, without a word, jostling Dean who was still standing there. He probably looked ridiculous since he wasn’t really an athlete, but he couldn’t care less: he had already been humiliated anyway, and at this point, the only thing that mattered was to get away from Dean as fast as he could.
This time, it was Cas' turn to almost choke on his drink. Dean was doing what, now? Asking about him? But why?
There. How could Cas not fall in love with Dean Winchester, when the boy just addressed his main concerns and suggested a solution to solve the problems without Cas having to even say anything? Dean was so thoughtful and kind and caring! And appeasing. Their eyes met once more, and Cas noticed that Dean looked really happy. Neither of them seemed to want the moment to end, however, after some time Dean broke the contact. He finished his drink and looked at his watch.
But Dean didn’t laugh and answer back playfully as he’d done for the entire afternoon. Instead, he looked at Cas really seriously. “No, really, Cas, I mean it. I noticed that after a few weeks, you’re more comfortable with the children. Less anxious. It’s nice to see you smile and have fun.”
"One less," grinned Dean and turned to the bigger one. "You in for a dance, too?"
Dean, however, fixed him exactly and then the girl's face. The whole situation was clearly uncomfortable and too much for her. However, there was a glimmer of hope in her eyes when she saw him and heard what he said.
"But you are suffering and I can't see it anymore," Castiel replied and there was so much affection in his voice that Dean's chest was filled with a warm feeling.
He loved an angel. He wanted to be with an angel...God, he wanted to do so much with Castiel, and some of it was really not suitable for minors. Was there anything worse than wanting to seduce an angel? Dean was nowhere near what one could call a typical believer. He only believed in beings he saw, against whom he had already fought, and he had fought with angels. It was also true that they were basically pure beings, but they were just as susceptible to worldly vices as humans - which had been confirmed again and again in the past few years. Still, it felt like a crime when his feelings for Castiel get out of hand.
Dean spun around and stared into the face of the werewolf who had run away earlier. So Cas really hadn't caught it.
