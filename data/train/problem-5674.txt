“No, Steve, what exactly do you mean?” He doesn’t sound like he’s joking, and he doesn’t sound angry like Sharon always did when Steve got like this. He just sounds level, and a little confused.
The door reopens again half an hour later and Sharon stalks out, not even glancing over at Steve. “I’m sorry honey, really.” He stands slowly, keeping himself hunched in when Sharon spins on her toes to glare.
When he mutters out “Siberia.” The word tastes like bile and trying to concentrate on Bucky’s guilty face is impossible with the world blurring. He suddenly knows what the nightmare was, but he hasn’t a clue on how to make it better.
“Steve?” Tony knocks on the door, even with no one watching, Steve is ashamed of how badly he startles. “I figured you’d need clothes so I stole some of Rhodey’s things.”
“I know that, I mean you’re not a rebound for me, I- I don’t want you to be a rebound.” He swallows hard, mouth dry. Tony stops, frowning down at the sheets. Steve squeezes his hand harder, afraid that if he lets go this will be it for them.
Recovery is a process, it’s not something that happens over night. It requires hard work, two steps forward and one step back. Recovery is frustrating, it’s terrifying and at times it can seem impossible. However, despite all of the trials and tribulation, you have to remember that two steps forward and one step back is still one step forward. Even on the days you feel like it’s not worth it, you are making progress.
Steve holds up the shirt still clutched in his hand, he didn’t realize it was there until Tony asked. Tony pries the soiled shirt from his grasp and drops it on the floor into a puddle of water and betrayal. “I should have known.” Steve mutters to himself.
Tony’s eyes widen “Shit, Steve I’m sorry, you’re here having the worst day of your life, and here I am, propositioning you.” He shakes his head and thrusts the clothes out. “Here, I’ll leave you alone now, you know where I am if you need anything.”
Tony hops up the steps to where the quinjet, or a smaller version, is waiting. “It’s called a power bottom Steve, god you need to use the internet more.” He sounds exasperated but he’s grinning to much, a real smile, not the pap-grin he usually has, to really be upset.
The bed dips behind him and arms wrap around his chest, Tony’s chin resting on his shoulder. “Don’t be. I’m okay.” He pauses for a second, taking in his partner’s sweaty, shaken complexion. “Are you?”
“Captain Rogers, Agent Carter requires your presence upstairs.” Even FRIDAY sounds pissy in a way an AI shouldn’t. He’s on his feet automatically, wincing at the lights. Natasha makes the same face Tony did in the elevator.
Steve just nods, pressing his knuckles hard into his thighs to stop his hands from shaking. The bed is soft and warm, nothing like the cold snow or the metal arm wrapped around his throat. Tony scoots back, dimming the lights again and reaches out. “C’mon honey, I dunno about you but I could use a few more hours.”
Sometimes control is breakfast, or packing lunch. Sometimes Steve gets a schedule for the week, things neatly planned out for him. Sometimes it’s a too tight grip on his hand if he lingers talking to Natasha or Pepper.
“I’m sorry.” He rasps, it was a nightmare, that’s all. He’s made a mess over a bad dream. Tony reaches up to cup the side of his face, bringing blue eyes up to meet brown.
Even as he steps out he can feel her marks, branding him, keeping him pinned under her like a dragon hoarding its treasure. His muscles and skin and bones feeling weirdly like they don’t really belong to him after all.
“Watch your fucking mouth Stark, you don’t know what you’re talking about. Steve! come on. You’re done here.” She glares daggers over Tony’s shoulder, and Tony jerks his head up, squaring his shoulders.
Tony locks his fingers around Steve’s side, stroking his thumb back and forth, leaving a tingling trail of warmth. “I’ll be okay,” Steve mutters, both to Tony and himself. Tony drops his cheek to Steve’s hair and plants a soft kiss to the top of his head.
“Steve, you’re ridiculous. Whatever happened last night, you can make it up to me, come on.” She’s not pleading, not really. She holds her hand out, beckoning him impatiently. She’s trying to gain her control back, and despite his racing heart, Steve’s hand twitches, instinctively starting to reach out.
Tony glances around, still nothing. “Look, can we get out of here? This place gives me the heebie jeebies.” His voice comes out strong, but Steve frowns, holding a hand out and stepping closer. Tony glances around again, something on the rooftop to his right glints.
Steve doesn’t respond. He just leaves, stalking right past Tony braced against a wall in the hallway, breathing hard and wheezing pitiful whimpers. They just don’t understand.
“Holy mother of shitfucker!” Steve startles off of the couch at the loud cursing. On his feet and ready to fight, he looks down at a rumpled genius with spectacular bags under his eyes.
Steve gets up to open the door for her, which she brushes off. “Of course. I love you.” He leans in to peck her cheek, which she tolerates with a muttered;
“Remember who you’re talking to!” Sharon sharply reprimands. As if he could forget. Looking down for the first time Steve can tell that the too long shirt knotted at her stomach isn’t his. But the shoulders are ill fitted and the sleeves dangle too low to be hers. “That’s what I came to ask you.”
“You couldn’t save me, and you can’t save him.” Bucky calls Steve’s attention away. Tony kneels in the snow, trembling with a blade pressed to his throat. Steve’s blood turns to ice, the air suddenly gone from his lungs.
His lungs give out, when did he get across the room? Back pressed against a wall, Steve crouching in front of him, hands held out placatingly. “Tony, I need you to breathe doll, slow and steady.” Tony pulls his knees to his chest, trying to get his legs under him steady enough to make it to the door.
Steve isn’t willing to give it up. So he forces his eyes closed and accepts as much affection as he can get, not noticing his breathing slowing, his eyes getting heavy, and eventually, falling asleep under the gently traced patterns on his back, Tony’s warm hand trailing through his hair and toying with the strands. He can deal with Sharon and the past and the pain in the morning.
Steve spends the next two hours on the couch sketching, she’s going to want him here when she wakes up and she hates any noises while she’s sleeping, so he draws in silence, barely noticing the way his sketches take on a hazel eyed brunette instead of a blue eyed blonde.
He doesn’t know if he’d even make it to the door, Steve’s big, fast and strong. “please.” He pleads in a shaking, broken voice. His vision blurred enough that Steve nearly disappears.
“On second thought, maybe I’ll just.... put these back.” Steve’s head snaps up at Tony’s strange tone. He freezes at the heated expression his friend wears, roaming eyes nearly black as he stares openly.
Steve fumbles for the phone, shaking swiping and holding it to his ear. He can hear himself gasping into the receiver.
“Okay then. I’ll see you tonight pal, it’s your turn to pick a movie.” Tony claps his shoulder, his hand feels warmer than Sharon’s.
Tony is adorable, sleep rumpled and soft, before the coffee and the hair gel, smiling. “Hey, how’d you sleep?” Tony’s eyes crinkle as he smiles wider.
He yelps and startles away. “I fucking hate when you call me that! You know that. Maybe your other sluts like it, but I don’t.” She hisses through gritted teeth and Steve stumbles away from her words.
“You don’t know her.” Steve doesn’t know if he believes himself when he whimpers the words out. He feels pathetic, he is pathetic. She wants him to be stronger and better and less selfish. Why can’t they see it?
Twenty minutes later there’s two bowls filled too high with ice cream, one bowl cookie dough fudge; the other, dark chocolate cherry. “Rough day?” Tony asks, sneaking a spoonful of Peter’s cookie dough. The younger boy squawks and steals a spoon of cherry in retaliation. It’s painfully domestic and Tony wouldn’t have it any other way.
across his face. He drops to the ground, head smacking against the pavement, the deep red hole in the centre of his forehead pooling blood onto the ground behind him.
Really, Tony isn’t one to keep it under wraps; he would rather be open about it, let everybody know that he’s… something more with Steve. But he doesn’t, because Steve doesn’t want that. Heck, the indication that they don’t really know how to call this thing between them should have been enough that there’s something not really right.
They all but fly out of the building, falling on the ground the moment they’re outside. Peter doesn’t allow himself a moment to recover, instead jumping up again to count if everybody made it out. There’s Vision, holding Wanda in his arms as if to protect her from the flames. Next to them, on the ground, there’s Harry, who is leaning over MJ and Yaël. Peter’s glad he’s making sure they’re fine.
And that morning, Peter and Harry both laughed their asses off when Tony showed them the footage of everything that happened last night, including the heavy, drunken make-out session that happened between the two birds in the Avengers-team.
“You guys have a thing now?” Yaël asked, helping out her friend who was clearly struggling to say he was in a relationship or together with someone out loud. Her heart jumped when he nodded. Yes, this was exactly the bright news she had been waiting for. Impulsively, Yaël giggled and jumped onto her friend’s back, clinging her arms around his neck.
“Bruce shouldn’t tell my kid about my personal issues,” he mutters. Peter punches him in the shoulder.
“I think your God wants humanity to learn how to love. Why would he disapprove whatever kind of love you’re feeling?” Steve’s eyes grew big and turned a bit red. He looked away. When he looked back at her, the redness was gone again.
Without the medications holding him back, Peter feels freer than ever. A girl from a grade higher than him asks him if he wants to dance. He nods and joins her, getting another bottle of beer pushed in the hands. He drinks from it, but doesn’t enjoy the taste at all. It’s bitter, bites at his tongue. But everybody’s doing it, and Peter’s not going back to being the loser of the school!
“At least a year after the surgery! Not permanently!” Tony counters. Steve and Peter roll their eyes. “C’mon, I love being an Avenger!”
Peter nods hesitantly. “Kind of? I mean, we’re not really together, but… almost? I don’t know, it’s a bit weird.”
The first one who speaks is Tony. Tony, who just cries out a loud ‘shit’ and throws his chair across the room to where Venom used to be. Now, there’s only a broken container. Probably, it got tipped over by accident. Or Venom was trying to get the Black Cat’s attention and she freed it to find out what it was. Either way, she fucked them over in so many ways that even Peter finds it difficult to breathe.
“I told you, they don’t record me, they don’t want to risk Tony finding out. The doctors that tested on me and, well, made me this, there’s no record of it in Stark Industries’s database, or that’s what Father said,” Bucky said, crossing his arms over his chest, and letting out a low sigh as he looked down at the bed in front of them. “You’re right though, there’s nothing I can do about that now, and there won’t be anything I can do about it then. I might never know my kids.”
“Oh, well then,” Rhodey took a deep breath in, holding it as he tried to think. “Maybe you should sleep on it and talk to them tomorrow? I’m sure you can come up with everything you need to by then.”
“Pepper told me you wanted it to be like a wedding still,” Stane remarked, tracing his finger over the rim of his glass, scratching at a tiny chip.
“It is your iron, Your Majesty, that’s why it’s the best,” Von Doom smiled, taking every chance he had here to butter up Tony. He wasn’t sure what of his reputation had preceded him, so he was going to have to try extra hard to seem like a better man than he was.
“No, not yet, in due time,” Tony said, pursing his lips as he exhaled sharply through his nose. He’d never been so furious in all his life, he’d never felt so hurt either. This was worse than losing his father, his father had died of natural causes through no fault of either of them. But this, the man he’d loved all his life, the man who had raised him, the man he thought wanted nothing but the best for him…
“There’s a table right there, Janet uses it for whatever she’s modeling,” Tony moved past Steve, going over to the table and sitting on the corner. “We can bring in furniture, people, whatever you want. Animals maybe, though I don’t know how still they are.”
“Sure, why not?” Natasha beamed, determined to stay positive about this, even if it drove Bucky insane. “We’ve done big jobs before, this one’s just a little more complicated. We won’t let you down.”
“I won’t doubt you. You think I’m not scared? I’m terrified, and I’m not the one doing all the work,” Tony said, pulling Bucky closer gently, not wanting to twist him up somehow and have the next contraction really hurt him. “I don’t feel qualified for this. At all. And I’m thirty three, I’m running a company right now, but I’m still scared about being a father.”
“There’s two moving things, that…” Steve said as he leaned in a bit, furrowing his brow as he tried to think of what that could be.
“Steve, I need you,” Bucky begged, wrapping his arms around Steve’s body, pulling him in as Steve pressed kisses down the side of his neck. “I’ve thought about this so much, when you first walked into my room, all I wanted to do was touch you, and for you to touch me.”
“In here is perfect, we’ll get rid of one of the others, they’re mostly just nature anyway,” Tony looked around, trying to think where the picture would get a lot of light and focus. Pointing at an old painting of a bowl of apples next to a vessel of wine, he turned to the others. “What do you think about here?”
“Tony sent you? But downstairs, I saw Namor, I heard the fire, what are you here to do to us?” Steve asked, hurrying over to put himself in between Bucky and this strange man. “Who are you?”
“And this has to be today?” Tony asked with a sigh, putting more dramatic emphasis into that than he needed to.
“Goodbye,” he mouthed, raising his sword over his head, about to bring it down in one motion when Bucky rolled over in his sleep. Pausing for a moment, he didn’t move an inch as he looked down at the man’s closed eyes, waiting for them to open. Convinced once again that he was asleep, Ronin slowly rose his blade, envisioning bringing it down through Bucky’s throat.
“Don’t worry, he’s harmless,” Natasha promised, holding up the dagger, though she knew she didn’t need it.
“Of course…” Steve held Bucky against him, stroking his hair, humming softly as he did his best to comfort him. His own efforts on Bucky were slowly working on him, making his heart slow in his chest. Just the scent of the other man was bringing him to a level of peace that nothing else could.
“I have an even better idea. Why don’t we take this to my bedroom where we’ll have supplies, and do less talking. Unless someone’s talking dirty, and then, by all means, please continue,” Tony said, looking at Steve, wishing he could telepathically give that towel a tug.
“That’s because you’re a good man, Steve,” Sarah said with pride in her voice as she went back to her seat, looking around the opulent room as she clutched her coffee close. “And a good man is what this Kingdom needs.”
“I’m sure, Tony,” Pepper frowned, really not wanting to do this to her boss hours after losing his fiancés. “And he is right about that, we don’t have much money set away. We’ve taken out a loan from Wakanda in the last year.”
“The marriage lottery that our people are going to take place in,” eating some eggs, he pushed the rest around on his plate. “Every eligible household is getting a number, we pick a number, we have a spouse.”
Tony hadn’t expected his tears until he heard his voice crack under the pressure of them, his eyes staring into Bucky’s for what felt like forever, until Bucky slowly let go of his legs with his left hand. Reaching out with his own hand, Tony squeezed Bucky’s tightly, the lump in his throat growing when Bucky squeezed back.
“You’ll attach it to your body with the harness, obviously,” Tony pointed out, smiling softly as he watched Bucky’s stunned expression. “If you use this lever attached to the arm here, your hand will open and close, and it’ll lock like that until you change it. You can lock the elbow too, so if you wanted to hold something in your hand, you can. It’s just an early model, the next one is going to be a lot better, but this should be good for now. You okay, Bucky?”
“Oh?” Stane rose his eyebrows, trying to ignore the happy little voice in his head  cheering on his possible victory.
“What do…what do you mean?” Bucky queried, having almost dropped his glass to the floor as he forgot it was in his hand. “What do you…what’s going to happen? How can…?”
“I think it’s okay now, but I do agree about the towel part,” Bucky chuckled, amused to see that Steve was blushing as well.
Looking at the stylus sitting next to the tablet, Steve thought it over for a moment. It wasn’t that he was completely attached to his job, he liked it, though he didn’t make as much as his wife, Peggy, but the benefits were great and it was a short commute. He had been hoping on a promotion soon, and a raise, so he could look into buying a nice hybrid car for himself. He was also wondering if he could ever pay for a place of his own. It wasn’t that he didn’t love Peggy, but he knew he was a much different person than he was when he married her after college. She deserved someone with a lot more passion for her, and he deserved to be happy.
“Perfect,” Bucky gave Steve a kiss, going to put some loose trousers on, not bothering with a shirt or shoes. It was just the three of them, after all. “Tony, you need a hand?”
“What do you think we’ll even have for supper?” Natasha said to break the tension she was feeling in the room. “I mean, I’m going to assume you two eat like we do.”
“It’s just that King Von Doom has arrived, sir,” the man said hurriedly, trying not to nervously fidget with his hands. He’d been on the business end of much of Stane’s temper, he wasn’t looking forward to more.
“I’m not worried,” Bucky said as he smiled back, his hands on his stomach as the babies moved inside him. “I think they’re on my side right now, so I’ll say I’m pretty sure we’re having one of each.”
“I can’t say I blame you,” Ms. Carr said, not reacting to the voice in her ear signalling delight at Steve as a candidate. “You’re exactly what we’re looking for, Mr. Rogers, the position is yours if you want to take it. I would tell you to take some time to think it over, but time isn’t something we have much of. Bucky has already been alone for a while.”
Tony turned back to the window, nodding a little as he pretended to be interested in the landscaping. “I’m glad you’ll be here, you’re as welcome to be here as he is,” he said finally, taking his phone from his pocket, thinking of what he’d say exactly to explain what his father had done, hoping the police didn’t think he was insane. “I’ll earn your trust.”
“What?” Tony blurted at the same time as Steve, wavering on the road of a second. “No, Bucky, you have nothing to be sorry for. Don’t you dare think that my father being insane is any of your fault. You didn’t ask for anything that happened to you.”
“I…” Strange gestured for Tony to come over to the two chairs sat before the fire. Sitting down in one, Strange waited for Tony before he began. “The world of magic isn’t so simple as good and bad. Things exist more on a spectrum. I am what you’d consider a good wizard, I imagine, but I have cast dark spells for what I thought was a good cause. And the most evil of us could cast spells of healing and life. In my heart, I hope my intentions make me benevolent. Because I know of wizards, ones that operate outside of the council, and frankly, they terrify me. I don’t want to be that.”
“This isn’t easy for me in any way, I’m sorry if I don’t exactly sound kingly right now,” Tony laughed nervously, planting both hands against the pulpit, taking a deep breath. “I know I’ve got this fancy crown, and a cape, and nice clothes, but I would trade it all to be with Steve and Bucky. They are more to me than anything, more than power or wealth or…I didn’t know what love was until I met them and…”
“I do remember you, we had that conversation about Wakanda’s vibranium mines, you were most knowledgeable,” Von Doom lifted the whiskey to his lips to take a sip, feeling it burn all the way down his chest. “How is trade with Wakanda nowadays?”
“You’re right,” Tony said with a sigh, looking over at Pepper and giving her a little nod. “This is my assistant, Pepper. She’ll organize a proper meeting between our people and hopefully we can get a few more cases worth of that stuff.”
“Hm?” Tony looked up, trying to look innocent as he continued to walk over to their new couch to take a seat. He wasn’t about to keep the one that Bucky had been shot on. That was easily replaceable, that had been done immediately.
“Steve, I’ve met someone,” Peggy said, seeing that Steve was faltering, figuring she could make it a lot easier for both of them by being direct. “I haven’t done anything with him, nothing like that, I would never cheat on you, but I like him. A lot. When I’m with you, I feel like I’m with one of my friends, but when I’m with Raj, I feel…I feel like I want to be with him.”
“He doesn’t want everything, I think that would just overwhelm him,” Steve said, rubbing Bucky’s back gently as he reached for his bottle of water on the nightstand. “He wants security, he needs it, and I think that should come from us, at least for now. He trusts me, he knows I’m looking out for his best interests, and I think that he’ll see that you are too.”
Bucky turned his head to the right, looking at Steve sitting with a swaddled baby in his other arm, and it all came back to him fast. He was in the clinic, he’d been put out to have his children, and now he was awake and looking at one of them. “…are they okay?”
“I don’t know. Talking to a stranger alone is a really big step, but you’ve made some of those already,” Steve said, looking at Bucky and taking his hand.
“Anything you like,” Pepper reassured him with a smile. “If you want to keep your hair long, Jarvis can just tidy up the ends a bit. He’s quite good at what he does.”
It wasn’t a big piece of paper, though it was a little thicker than the paper Steve was used to drawing on. On the left was the King’s official seal in red ink, the stamp pressed into it was a coat of arms with a helmet on the banner and the Stark name. Written onto the paper was the name ‘Rogers’ and the number on hundred and thirty in neat, flowing script. It wasn’t embossed in gold or decorated with intricate designs like Steve had been picturing, he’d already been wondering how easy it would be to forge them. He didn’t think anyone would go through all the trouble to make one of these for every number in their family’s name.
“So you don’t want to lose, but you want Bucky to win?” Tony repeated to see if he had that right, crossing his arms over his chest. “What do you want, Bucky?”
“Ha ha,” Bucky said as he crawled into bed, dragging the blanket over top of him, and flopping himself against the pillows. Looking up at the ceiling, he couldn’t wipe the smile off his face. He had two amazing men in his life now, and they both wanted and loved him, and he couldn’t believe how happy he was.
“Please don’t go, please don’t…” Bucky begged, slowly letting go of himself to cling to Steve, burying his face against the man’s shoulder, his tears soaking through the thin material of Steve’s blue t-shirt.
“I have six days until the wedding, a month until the crown is no longer in Tony’s hands, and at that point, it’s every man for himself,” Stane said, frustration in his voice as he pursed his lips. “If we don’t get this done before then, we have no guarantee we can control whoever takes over.”
“You’re not ugly, Buck,” Natasha sighed, hating every time this came up. She hadn’t found the right thing to say to him yet, but she was still working on it. “You don’t know the King, maybe he wouldn’t care.”
“You know what, that’s funny too,” Howard said, watching as the doctor uncovered Bucky’s stomach, putting the ultrasound wand against it to reveal their growing twins on the monitor. “You were so angry with me when I brought him home for you, you called the police on me, but now we’re here and you claim to love him, and the children you wouldn’t have been able to have without my tampering.”
“No, Mom’s good…” Steve shook his head, looking down at his glass of whiskey before taking a small sip. “I have a friend, Sam Wilson, he’s a soldier in the guard, I would…if I have to have some one guard me, I’d want it to be him, please. If that’s possible.”
“Yes,” Bucky said, going in their shared room to wait for one of the others to help him get out of his clothes. He preferred to have Steve or Tony do it rather than Jarvis, it just made more sense to him to let his husbands help.
“I’m sorry, this can’t be comfortable,” Tony laughed softly as their lips separated, unable to resist the urge to nip at Bucky’s bottom lip. “I don’t want to push you or rush you into anything you’re not ready for.”
“And Steve too,” Tony repeated, pressing a kiss to Bucky’s forehead, rubbing the tip of his just under his hairline. “I don’t think you two could be  separated, and that’s good, because I think you two belong together. I just hope I belong with you both too.”
“I’m coming,” Steve bent down and undid his shoes, setting them neatly aside as his grey hoodie joined Tony’s jacket on the chair. Climbing into bed on Bucky’s other side, he lay his head down on the pillows as he reached out to wrap an arm over Bucky and Tony, happy to have a moment where he could be close with them both.
“DON’T!” Tony snapped, standing upright again, looking over at Steve and Bucky, not sure what he could possibly do or say to fix this situation. Walking over to the bed, he knelt in front of Bucky, not speaking for a moment as he watched the young man hug his legs tighter. “Bucky, I’m sorry, I’m not yelling at you, I don’t mean to scare you. I can’t even begin to imagine what you’ve been through, and there aren’t enough apologies in this world for what has happened to you. I’m going to make things better for you.”
“Ugh, don’t even say that. I can’t eat porridge again,” Natasha whined jokingly, though there was some truth to what she was saying. She’d had a taste of a better life, and she didn’t want to give it up. “Maybe we should coach you.”
“I don’t know…I’m…don’t worry about me, I’ll be fine when we’re there,” Bucky mumbled, pulling the blanket Tony had taken from the plane around him tighter. “It’s okay, I just want to look at the trees…”
“At least that much,” Natasha scoffed, eyeing the coffee again. She was pretty sure that she and Bucky had drunk most of it, the two were practically vibrating in their seats, but she still wished they had more. “Bucky, we get to live like this. Well, hopefully you can convince the King to sell some of this stuff for a better cause, but you know what I mean.”
“Oh, I think something’s…” Von Doom looked over his shoulder as the crowd began to get to their feet, slowly standing himself. As the music began to play, he did his best to put on a facial expression that was more neutral and fought the urge to roll his eyes. For the life of him, he didn’t understand what all the fuss was about.
It took a moment for Bucky to take in a ragged breath, coughing a little before he went back to breathing properly, feeling light headed and dizzy in the meantime. “I don’t feel well…” he said weakly, leaning against Steve and closing his eyes.
“Yes, I’m talking to Strange,” Tony mocked her lightly, grinning at the face she made back at him. “I promise, I’ll have him front and center, doing lots of tricks to impress both young and old.”
“How much does it hurt him? Is that really necessary?” Steve asked, looking back at Bucky, feeling terrible for him. Even if he was special, he needed friends, and he didn’t know if just him was going to be enough.
“Yes, they’re here, thank you,” Bucky looked at the flat surface of the box, noticing his name engraved in the dark wood. “I should put this inside where it’s safe, can you hold on for a moment, please?”
“He’s working out very well, I like him a lot,” Bucky said, looking up at Howard for a moment, giving him the closest thing he could manage to a smile. “Thank you, Father.”
“You’re neither of those things, especially not broken,” Steve corrected him, lacing their fingers together and bringing Bucky’s hand up to his lips to press a kiss against it. “Nothing about you needs to be fixed, Bucky.”
Tony opened his mouth, not sure whether he was going to argue or relent, when he heard the basement door close. Putting down his empty glass down, he followed Steve out of the kitchen and into the main room. Immediately, he saw Bucky, wet haired and in his pyjamas, on his hands and knees between the back of the couch and the dining room table, grunting as he stabbed at the floor with a keyhole saw.
“But now he’s gone, you’re stronger than he could ever be. That’s why you’re here and he’s not,” Tony smiled despite the pang of guilt at feeling so relieved that his father was dead. Howard Stark wasn’t his family any more, though, that honour belonged only to Bucky and Steve, and the two babies he couldn’t stop thinking about.
“I would be in a bad mood if someone tried to kill me too,” Clint admitted, finally tucking his mask into a pouch on his waist, crossing his legs at the ankle to show that he was relaxed and not going anywhere.
“You making the decision is what I honestly want. I want you to be happy, whether that means with or without a kid,” Steve said, hoping that Bucky believed him, and that Tony would say the same thing. He didn’t know about Tony, but he’d wanted children himself, though he wasn’t going to have them at the expense of Bucky’s physical or mental health.
“Steve!!” Bucky gasped, relieved as he took the older man’s hand and squeezed it tightly, pulling him closer. “I didn’t think you were going to make it, I didn’t know if I was going to see you again.”
Steve just closed his eyes and took a deep breath, trying to picture two little ones running all over the place, driving them crazy every chance they’d get. He was scared for Bucky, that thought hadn’t left his mind for a second, but there was a glimmer of hope for a perfect future that he couldn’t help wanting to dwell on. His husbands, his children, he needed for all of them to make it safely out of this.
“Relax, he’s not now,” Bucky reassured them, patting Steve’s thigh lightly before giving it a squeeze. “Natasha saved the day. She came running in and the two of them seem to know each other so the attack was called off.”
He didn’t want to get in trouble though, he didn’t want to somehow make this marriage invalid. But at the same time, would anyone know he’d done this? He was pretty sure he could destroy the evidence, but was it worth risking becoming a King alongside Tony and Steve?
“Would you walk away from this contest for me?” Bucky queried, looking right up at him, making eye contact. “Would you walk away from marrying Tony if it meant my forgiveness? Would you sacrifice that for me?”
“You have to get married anyway, you might as well do it before you turn thirty five and lose your crown,” Stane stepped closer to Tony, pulling his hand away from his left eye so he could look down into it. “Do you want to lose the throne? Don’t you want to be King?”
“…are you sure you want me to…?” Bucky gestured to his shirt, reaching over to tug the loose hanging sleeve. “I get that it’s not exactly sexy, I can keep the shirt on to cover it up, it’s not going to upset me if y-“
“I knew you were married,” Bucky said, chewing on his lip for a moment, reaching over for the cards so he could slowly shuffle them.
“…okay,” Bucky said, letting go of himself, reaching out with his left arm to carefully select a card from the deck, holding it up. “Eight.”
“Will they be reasonable still if I hold out for new boots?” Nick queried, trying not to smile as he heard the whispers behind him.
“I’m fine if he’s fine, I have no ill will towards him,” Steve looked down at his hands clasped in front of him, and then back up to Tony. “I’m sure there won’t be any trouble.”
“Hopefully what doesn’t take long?” Tony came in, still dressed in the clothes he was wearing earlier, looking worried. “Bucky, are you alright? Did y-why is there an armed man in here?”
“My only worry is…” Stane took a deep breath in through his mouth, blowing it back out through his nose. “Tony says he loves them.”
“Bucky?” Dr. Marner said as she stepped out of the room, holding the door open behind her. “How are you doing, dear? Are you ready to come back here?”
“Are you kidding me? I’m counting down the days,” Stane laughed as he leaned back in his chair, crossing his legs on top of his desk as he stared into the clear image of Von Doom before him. “He’s been a pain in my ass since I killed my sister and brother in law, but I can’t exactly just chop his head off. I’ve had to bide my time, do this carefully.”
“So should we get married?” Tony asked Steve and Bucky casually before a wide grin broke out on his face. Pulling them both into a hug, he didn’t want to let go of them for anything. He didn’t know how he was going to get through a whole wedding before he could kiss them.
“It’s for you,” Tony said proudly, having put it together himself over the past few days since their first meal together. He realized immediately what the problem might be, that Bucky couldn’t both hold and crank it. “Here, I’ll hold it, you turn the little crank there.”
“Great, Bucky’s great, I think I’m really going to like it here,” Steve said, the weirdness of the situation finally starting to kick in. He’d worked here for years without seeing the man, and now all of a sudden Stark was on a first name basis with him. And what did this have to do with the fact that Tony Stark’s picture was in the room? “We were just getting to know each other.”
“Actually they are, and they’re not a bad idea if you’ve watched toddlers at all,” Steve said, taking out his phone to look up a picture of one to show it to Bucky. “They’re small and determined, so this is a good way to keep them out of traffic or off the rails in the subway.”
“Mhm,” Stane grunted in return, sitting upright and smoothing the front of his rich, burgundy robes, fingers tracing over the colourful embroidery of birds and flowers. It was the nicest, most vibrant garment he owned, and he knew if he didn’t stick to Tony’s dress code, he was going to hear about it later.
“That’s only part of the present, the rest is where we’re going tonight,” Tony was pleased with himself. He didn’t know much about art, but he’d been asking around a lot since he found out that Steve was into it. “Are you ready?”
“I can’t wait,” Tony said as he thought of what he next few days were going to be like between pretending to mourn and whatever else Pepper made him do. Not to mention his uncle giving him advice.
“Just as long as it’s a yes now, I’m hap-ohhh…” Bucky whimpered, Steve’s expert digits exploring deep within him, hitting gold with every twitch. “I just want to do something for you both, I want to make you both feel good. I don’t think I’d feel like a good husband if I didn’t.”
“Exactly,” Tony said as he walked over to it, resting Bucky on the bed, and leaning in to start undressing him. “You’re in good hands, baby.”
“Three, okay, I can do three,” Steve cleared his throat, trying to stay as calm as possible as he set the cards back down. “My dad died when I was really little so I don’t remember anything about him except his facial hair was scratchy, my favourite flavour of ice cream is Neapolitan but I always eat the vanilla, then strawberry, then chocolate, and…I hate whole wheat bread.”
“So can I expect a picture of me? I hate doing sittings, but I actually would for you if you wanted me to,” Tony offered, shrugging a little, not sure if he should offer himself up for that but going for it anyway.
“He didn’t volunteer for this, Tony, we made him for you,” Howard said, excitement in his voice as he was finally getting to reveal the fruits of this long process. “He’s been waiting for you for fourteen years.”
“Goats are important,” Tony nodded, trying not to stare at where Bucky’s arm should be. He hated his curious nature, and he knew it probably would have gotten him punched out by now had he not been in charge.
“Then hide them somewhere, declare them dead,” Clint said in a loud whisper, though he was sure the guards outside wouldn’t hear him if he was shouting in their ears. He had to admit, his own hearing was slipping, he didn’t know how much longer he could work like this.
“…that’s the thing…I do…” Bucky laughed weakly, sniffing as he looked over at the picture of Tony Stark on his wall. “I think he’s handsome…and I don’t know if it’s because I actually feel that way or if they did something else to me. What if they brainwashed me? Or just put thoughts in my head somehow? I don’t…” Bucky looked away from Tony’s picture and back to Steve, shaking his head, his blue eyes brighter than ever through the tears. “I don’t know what is me and what is them.”
“Admin mode, Carr, Rebecca Anne, four eight zeta nine alpha four,” Ms. Carr said, scanning her own pass, and letting her thumbprint and retina to be scanned before reaching into her bag to pull out another badge that was blank save for a small red star. Sliding it into the slot, she turned to Steve.
“I think that’s perfect…” Bucky said, climbing onto the bed on his knees, turning around and reaching for Steve. “Please, Steve?”
Sitting in another cart, still holding his messenger bag against him, Steve was pretty sure he wasn’t getting a cake and gift basket today. He hadn’t realized until he got home and had a long time to think about this that it all seemed really weird. Stark Industries didn’t deal with medical testing, so why would there be a patient here? And what had they done to him, exactly? He remembered Ms. Carr telling him that Bucky would tell him if he wanted to, but he felt awkward at the thought of asking someone what made them special. It didn’t take long for him to decide that he wasn’t going to let his curiosity get the better of him with this job.
“I still can’t believe you broke up. I guess you don’t tell me everything,” Sam teased, picking up a sugar packet, fiddling with it as he waited to put it into his coffee. “I’m happy for you if you’re both good.”
“I’ll do my best…” he promised softly, looking at his mother, and forcing a smile. “I want this life for us, Mom. It’s just hard for me to not want it for him too.”
“…how you always put me in the middle,” Bucky said, a little smile on his lips as he looked down at his hand on his stomach, and the braided gold ring on his finger. “In bed, on the couch, out here, I’m always in the middle, and I know you say you both just like having me close but…I know it’s because you want to surround me with love. You’ve even taught the kids, they tell me they love me constantly, almost as much as you do and…and I want to thank you because I don’t know how I survived without love before.”
“I don’t know, give them separate rooms with an adjoining door,” Rhodey shrugged as he said the first thing that came to mind. “That way you can go back and forth and you can split your time between them evenly. I would just really hope that they’re not the jealous types.”
“I would never leave you,” Steve said, realizing to himself how deeply he meant that once it left his lips. “I swear to you, Bucky, as long as I’m living, I’m going to be with you.”
“Bucky, I’m sorry!” Steve pleaded, just wanting this to be over. His hopes had climbed as his mother spoke to his former friend, but they’d come crashing down with Bucky’s reply. “I am so, so sorry, I can’t say it enough. I will never stop saying it.”
“I have to ask, was it an easy decision?” Bucky looked down at the amber liquid, feeling no desire to drink it at the moment. He was too afraid it would come back up.
“Oh fuck yeah,” Bucky’s voice trembled, mouth parting in a circle as he clenched down on Steve’s fingers deep inside him. Every time Steve brushed against that one spot, it was like lightning going through his veins. It had been so long since someone other than himself had been inside him, he forgot how good it felt.
“If something happens down the road, we’ll support them and love them and let them be who they want,” Steve said in a reassuring tone, petting Bucky’s hair as he watched Tony, concerned about how he’d been acting in the two weeks since they’d returned to their home.
“I’ll be nice and gentle,” Tony grinned as he moved behind Steve, reaching for the glass jar he’d left on the bed, picking it up, and removing the lid. “I guess I should ask if you’re okay with this before I do anything, Steve.”
“It hasn’t worked yet,” Bucky pointed out to her. “I’ve got my foot in the door, but I’m not married. We might still end up back where we started.”
Tony hit the brakes hard, which only made them hit a pothole even harder, straining all of them against their seatbelts. Once they’d come to a rest, Bucky tore off his seatbelt, getting on the backseat on his hands and knees, not caring that he was half on Steve, just needing to get the pressure of his weight off of his back.
“I have all the measurements I need now, you can clean that gel off Bucky’s stomach now,” Dr. Marner said as she took her hand off her mouse, looking at the last image with a little smile. “I’ve saved these images, and I will keep them in the same folder as your emails.”
“Because I secretly love hockey and fries with gravy and cheese on them,” Tony shot back sarcastically, feeling guilty the second he did that. “No one would think to look for me up there, it’s isolated, there’s an airport even though it’s isolated, it works.”
Bucky looked up into Steve’s eyes, not speaking for a second as a smile spread across his face. Leaning up towards Steve, Bucky pressed his lips against the other man’s in a cautious, soft kiss, letting it linger for a few seconds before it broke. “I’m glad you’re here too…” he whispered against Steve’s lips, his cheeks flushed as his heart thundered in his chest. “I don’t know if you wanted me to do that, b-“
“I’m not talking about Pepper. Pepper is an awful choice,” Stane said with as gentle a voice as he could manage. “She’s a very good assistant, she’d be impossible to replace. And you can’t have your wife acting as your servant, that won’t…no, I don’t think it’s a good idea at all.”
“So what would you do if I asked you to kiss me again?” Bucky asked, his voice sweet as he looked over at Tony and batted his lashes.
“Then let me make a suggestion,” Clint flexed his fingers in their tented position as h uncrossed his legs and leaned forward. “We tell everyone I killed them both to keep them safe. If everyone thinks they’re dead, no one will come after them.”
“And how do you propose to pay for it if we don’t have money?” asked Stane, hoping to knock this train of thought from Tony’s head.
“Listen to me, Tony. You don’t always get to make the decisions you want to make, King or not,” Stane insisted, taking on a more authoritarian tone. “Marrying Von Doom is the best thing for this kingdom, and you don’t get to be selfish this time. You want to fix this place? He has money, you can take it to make the repairs you want. You will be able to make proper change.”
“I’m not talking to Bucky about that, or I don’t want to anyway,” Steve clarified, not sure if he was even going to get a chance here. Natasha was a scary woman, he was pretty sure she could rip his heart out without breaking a sweat. “I want to talk to Bucky about the past. Our past.”
“Did anyone…Tony, are you drunk?” Rhodey asked as he took a seat next to him, planting his cane between his feet and lacing his fingers over the handle. “It’s a castle, it’s your castle, I probably saw about twenty people on my way here.”
“Sam, I didn’t even know for a long time, I thought I was just in a rut or something,” Steve admitted, figuring he’d be as honest as he could be, he didn’t like lying to his best friend. “I didn’t realize until I got this job how deep that rut was, and how much I didn’t want to be in it any more. It was like…like the sun finally shone down on me.”
“Excellent then,” Tony smiled at both men, wondering which one he was going to end up with. As far as he was concerned at the moment, they were both good candidates, he’d be happy with either. He couldn’t wait for the fun of getting to know them, spend some one on one time with them, maybe a little more.
“You’re welcome,” Tony said as he lead Bucky up to a door at the end of the hall, slipping his key into the lock and turning it. Opening the heavy door, he picked up a lantern hanging up on the wall, and turned to look at Bucky. “Are you sure you want to go in there? I’m going to bore you.”
“Car accident, unfortunately,” Ms. Carr said casually, not mentioning that he was already dead when his car went into the river. “Mr. Rogers, this may seem forward and inappropriate, but I’m still going to ask you for a list of your sexual partners.”
“Thank you, good sir,” Tony said as he walked up to the pulpit, looking out over the crowd as he allowed a tear to escape his eye and run down his cheek. “S-sorry, I…”
“I don’t know why we couldn’t have a relaxed first meal with them,” Tony grumbled, getting out of his chair before Pepper chose to hit him with the book next. “Wouldn’t they be more at ease if this was nice and casual?”
“It is,” Tony nodded, standing motionless for a moment before turning around to a table next to him. Taking the stopper out of an enormous crystal bottle, he poured three glasses of whiskey, one glass nearly overflowing. Handing out the two lesser filled glasses to his guests, he took the full one for himself.
“What did they tell you would be happening today? You must need new clothes, you can’t go around in a dressing gown,” Sarah couldn’t help the excited little laugh that left her lips. “My son has a dressing gown!”
“That’s…that’s so generous. Thank you,” Steve turned himself in a circle looking at everything in the room. He couldn’t believe how much paint she had, he’d always dreamed of painting something himself. There was no way he could have afforded to before now. “Thank you so much, I can’t say that enough.”
“Years? How long has he been here?” Steve’s eyebrows shot up, looking around the room Bucky was kept in, trying to picture growing up in there. This all seemed much more horrific than he was let on, he was starting to feel like he’d made a big mistake signing onto this. If they got caught keeping Bucky in this basement, what was going to happen to him if he knew about it and said nothing?
“You’re going to the storage room beneath the chapel where your coffins are. Now act old,” Fury gestured for them to disembark after him, holding out a hand to help a hunched over Bucky. Remembering to grab his real arm, Fury got Bucky down in one piece before assisting Steve.
“Bucky! Steve!” said Tony from the bottom of the stairs, running into their circle of light to throw his arms around them both. It was a beautiful, but tearful reunions between the three of them as Bucky and Steve opened their embrace to welcome Tony into it.
When the morning of the funeral came, there was no shortage of mourners funneling their way through the busy corridors to the chapel. Everyone was in their best clothes, though not their usual funeral attire, as Tony had put a message out that he wanted everyone dressed in bright, joyous colours. Despite many people thinking that the King had lost his mind and that it was disrespectful to the dead to dress as such, not one attending party chose to wear black. Even Von Doom had chose to wear a green outfit rather than the dark one he’d packed.
“I’ll tell you what, I’ll send for him, tell him to come for a visit to the Iron Castle,” Stane smiled, his chest puffing out as he watched as Tony actually seemed to listen to him for once. “He can get to know the place, get to know you, it’ll be perfect.”
“What’s going on out here? Can Eddie play with them or are they going to bury him or something?” Tony asked, carrying a very squirmy toddler who wanted to go play with his siblings and the dog.
“That’s very possible. Do you have a bodyguard of choice, Bucky?” Tony set his empty glass down, reaching for more cheese and meat.
“…I need to lie down,” Bucky said, getting to his feet quickly and all but running from the room and upstairs to their bedroom, leaving Tony and Steve blinking in his wake.
“You…you could call it that,” Tony admitted, impressed with Steve’s perception, and preparing his new defense next time someone told him peasants were stupid. “I have to be honest with you here, and I probably shouldn’t be but…I hate being King. I hate all the court nonsense, the gossiping, the power hungry…fuck. It’s terrible, and I might be bringing you into a life you’re going to hate, but I absolutely can’t attach myself to any of those people.”
“And I am your protector, and a very busy man,” Fury said, keeping his gaze unbroken. “Also, you like me.”
Tony closed his eyes, reaching over to his Uncle, his fingers brushing the top of the bowl before he sunk his hand into the mess of tiny paper scraps. There were so many, and they were so delicate, they slipped through his fingers as he tried to grab just one. Drawing his hand back a moment to regroup and try again, he felt something stuck to the side of his index finger. Touching it with his thumb, he realized it was a single piece of paper. Grasping it, he opened his eyes as he drew his hand back, peeling the number off his finger as he looked down at it.
“Who tried to kill us?” Bucky needed to know, he needed to know where all of this was coming from. “Tony, I feel like I’m going out of my mind, is this over? You have to tell me it’s over.”
“If you’re wondering about your things, we spoke to your mother last night, and someone will go collect them today,” Pepper reassured him, figuring the man would want to have his possessions, as few as they may be.
Where Bucky’s arm had been was a relatively clean, but thick scar over the bone of his clavicle. The entire arm itself was gone, every inch of the bone having been torn clean from Bucky’s body. It wasn’t nearly as gory and twisted looking to the others as it was to Bucky, but he was the one who’d had to live with what was done to him. The only person in the world who’d seen what that wizard did to him was Natasha, though he wasn’t hoping to sleep with her. He hoped desperately that this hadn’t soured him for the others.
“Good to know, I’ll bust out the blender,” Tony said, sticking his head in the gym, not spotting Steve. “Okay, Sherlock, where is he now?”
“Blue, not too dark or too light, but…a nice blue,” Steve answered, perking up a bit at the thought of being able to wear his favourite colour. He mostly wore brown or greyish clothing, with a red vest that signified he was a guard.
“What is going on? Where are you taking his things?” Steve said, his voice stern with a ribbon of anger weaved through it, not caring who he was talking to. Bucky was his job, he had to keep him calm and happy, and he wouldn’t be either of those things with his things being taken as Stark loomed over him. “Why wasn’t I informed that something was happening today so I could be here for him?”
“I can’t say no to that…” Steve breathed, taking Bucky’s hand as he crawled onto the bed with him, pulling Bucky against himself as he kissed him hard, pushing him back into the mattress. Running his hands down Bucky’s side, they made their way behind him to grip his ass, squeezing it  as he felt their cocks slipping against each other. “Oh my fucking god, you taste delicious…”
“I don’t think that’s the right word for it,” Bucky hugged his bucket close, still not sure if he was going to need it again.
“Bucky’s going to be fine. He lost a lot of blood, but they put it back in him and closed the wound. They said it should heal and he’ll be okay, he’ll just need to wear a sling for a bit,” Steve said as he rubbed his eyes, yawning for what felt like the fiftieth time. “The babies…they’ve slowed down, they have to monitor them for a bit.”
“Our bed sounds perfect,” Tony said, hoping that this was Bucky’s not so subtle way to get them all naked together. “Need a hand up the stairs?”
“And yet here we are,” Tony ate one last grape before turning back to his coffee. “It doesn’t matter if they’re rich or poor, I’m bringing a stranger into the house either way. You may have researched these people you suggest, but they can hide intentions just as much as anyone else. Probably moreso. I don’t care if this impoverished person’s agenda is to just stay with me to be rich and live in luxury. I can handle not being loved for the right reasons.”
Walking down the long hallway to the chapel, Fury took them right into the grandly decorated room illuminated by the light of the full moon. The seats were all decorated in red fabric and gold ribbons, with white flowers displayed in crystal vases at the end of every row. At the front hanging above the stage was a beautiful arrangement of flowers with red and gold ribbons draping down from them. On the ribbons were Steve, Bucky, and Tony’s names in flawless script, along with tomorrow’s date.
“So let me get this straight, he’s so okay he needs a handler??” Tony said loudly, demanding clarification and the truth from his father.
“FUCK!” Steve cried out, his hips jerking hard as he felt himself finish deep inside Bucky, his vision swimming with spots of colour as he felt the waves of his orgasm slamming against his brain, echoing through his body. When it finally began to wane, he began to go limp, panting hard as he leaned back against Tony.
“It fuels my hatred,” Bucky laughed, trying to make an angry face and failing. “At least it makes me not want to punch that stupid asshole in this perfect face for a few minutes.”
“One thirty! One hundred thirty! That’s us! That’s us, Bucky! Holy shit, get up there!” Natasha shoved the ticket into Bucky’s hand, a huge smile on her face as she gave him a push towards the stage.
“I do…this is just a lot harder than I thought it would be,” Bucky said, finally rolling onto his back so he could look at both of his boyfriends, looking at them quietly. “…I want us to do the ceremony before the babies come. As soon as possible. I know my last name is technically Barnes but I don’t remember my family. I want to be a Stark-Rogers, so if anything happens to me, that’s how I’m remembered.”
“I won’t go out again. I’m sorry I went out this morning, but it had to be done,” Steve rubbed Bucky’s back, scowling as two of Howard’s workers came back into the room to keep packing. Pulling Bucky closer, he whispered into his ear under the guise of a hug, hoping that no one suspected anything. “Trust me.”
“Steve, Bucky, come with me,” Fury said as he held out a hand towards them. “Tony said if I said the words ‘the owl has come for my meat pie’ to you that you’d come along without trouble.”
“I like it,” Bucky said, smiling up at him as he reached out to wrap his arms around Tony’s neck. “I don’t know what I’m going to call you both. Give me some time to think about it.”
“It’s nothing much. It mostly states that if you repeat anything said in this room, you will lose your job, and be sued for breach of contract,” Ms. Carr said, bringing it up on her tablet, turning it so Steve could look it over.
“Oh, you must be Mr. Rogers,” the nurse said, waiting as Bucky removed his heavy hoodie, leaving him in a tank top, to get his blood pressure read.
“Did you pick this place because of me?” Bucky asked from the backseat, realizing that he hadn’t seen another car since they left town, and also that he didn’t mind cars as much when Steve drove.
“And I get to be in the middle,” Bucky said with a smile, his cheeks flushing when he realized how that sounded. Though he couldn’t argue with the sentiment.
“Steve…” Sarah sighed, shaking her head to reach over to get him a napkin, handing it over to him. “Clean yourself up with that. We can’t have the King walking in with you covered in fruit.”
“I think we should move this to bed…” Tony panted when the kiss finally broke, flushed with arousal as he reached down to pull his own shirt up and over his head. “What do you two think?”
“Today, right now, is the only time I can guarantee I’m alive,” Bucky said sincerely and with determination. “So right now is when we need to be married, because…please, I want to be married to you both. I need this so I’ll feel better if I do die.”
“I swear, you two drive me insane,” Bucky shook his head, not even trying to push it any more than that. He knew when he was beaten, and he honestly didn’t mind losing to those two. “You’re lucky I love you both so much.”
“Yeah…” Steve said as he gave Bucky a weak smile, turning with Ms. Carr to leave the room. Bucky’s pale blue eyes haunting him all the way down the corridor as his words echoed in Steve’s mind.
“The cats never seem happy about it,” chuckled Steve, recalling Mrs. Nelson’s tabby latching onto his face as he went down the ladder. “I think things will get busier with everything going on. There’s supposed to be a big celebration when they announce the winning family. I’m sure I’ll be needed for crowd control.”
“I don’t know yet,” Tony shrugged, picking up his coffee again, finding he needed that way more than he needed food. “We’ll find out in a couple weeks, I suppose.”
“And why didn’t he come up here as discussed?” asked Stane, his annoyance evident in his body language and voice. “He was supposed to come up here, and we were going to present him at supper to the King.”
“That is a lot of food…” Steve ran his hands through his hair, loving how clean it felt. They’d had baths before they went to bed last night, and though Steve had complained at the time, he was happy with the job the servant had done in cleaning him up, especially his nails.
“That sounds wonderful,” setting down his glass on the table, Von Doom crossed the room to stand next to Pepper, looking down at the shorter woman. “Speak to Valeria, she’ll let you know everything I require for my stay here. I should like to have her with me when we go to our rooms.”
“Easy, have the funeral ready to go, do a wedding instead,” Natasha said, agreeing with this plan. She figured it was the best way to keep Bucky alive was to say he was dead. “They shouldn’t be targets the same once you’re wed, I don’t think, because your crown is yours then. You’re not in a position to lose it any more unless they kill you, and that would probably be a mess.”
“I still don’t think that sounds like a good habit to get into,” Stane said with a little laugh, looking at Von Doom, and promptly bowing to him. “Your Majesty, may I present myself, you may not remember me. My name is Obidiah Stane, I’m King Anthony’s Uncle.”
“I have Steve…I have Tony…” Dropping his voice down a bit, he licked his lips as he stared up at the painted ceiling above him. It was stupid, but just hearing these things out loud sent a rush through his body, making his cheeks ached as he grinned from ear to ear. “I have them both, and they love me for me, they love me with one arm. They really love me…”
“You’re right, we are,” Steve agreed, taking a sip of whiskey, though he didn’t quite love it as much as Tony or Bucky did. He still had a taste for ale, though he was glad he could get better quality than the swill he used to drink. “We should take that trip to Wakanda that we’ve been tossing around, it would be nice to see a new place and meet new people.”
“I can get down, I don’t want to sit with my back against anything. Can I ride into town just lying on Steve?” Bucky asked, leaning against Steve, breathing hard as the contraction finally left.
“Most likely because you love me so much,” Tony said as he handed it over to Bucky with a smile. “See you can’t say I don’t spoil you with my billions, that bucket is thick plastic and is resistant to breaking. That’s what it said online, anyway, I think it had four stars.”
The three of them smiled, each of them feeling that giddy rush in his chest as they let go just enough to face each other. It was like anticipating that first kiss all over again, sweaty palms, awkward grins, and pounding hearts, but it quickly culminated into something beautiful between them. A moment etched onto their minds within their perfect little home together, one that none of them were ever going to forget.
“And half of her duties are things you should be doing yourself,” Stane fought every urge to push Tony’s feet off the table, more and more annoyed with his smart ass nephew.
“The doors open on both sides for each floor down to the sixth floor, but it only opens on this side on the eighth floor because of your clearance. If someone gets in the elevator with you and requests a floor, it will go straight to their floor and the door on the eighth won’t open until you request your floor again with your badge and scans,” Ms. Carr explained as the elevator descended, turning to exit through the back into a hallway lit only by emergency lighting. Leading Steve down a hallway of offices empty save for stacks of old boxes here and there, she stopped at the fifth room on the left. “Your pass works here as well, even if the scanner looks old, it works just fine.”
“I suppose you’re right,” Tony relaxed a bit, though inside he was absolutely teeming with anger and self hatred. “I don’t know what I’m going to do without them to marry, I’m going to end up losing my crown.”
“You’re so special, you know that?” Tony laughed weakly, holding Bucky close, feeling in that moment that there was going to be an end to the pain and loss he was feeling. “It has nothing to do with what you can do, and everything to do with who you are. You’re amazing, Bucky, I’m sorry how it happened, but I’m so glad to know you.”
Steve was glad that it wasn’t a long trip to the castle, but every foot still seemed like a mile. By the time they got there, his stomach had calmed, having told himself that these people wouldn’t save them from being murdered only to murder them at the castle. He couldn’t wait to talk to Tony, though, he wanted to know if he knew who would have attacked them. Someone definitely knew something they weren’t telling him.
“She’s still in the throne room, Your Majesty, would you like me to go back in and get her?” Pepper offered, standing up straight as she wondered what it was about this man that made her skin crawl. She was in no place to comment, though, she didn’t even want to let Tony know how she felt.
“That doesn’t mean I regret it, though,” Tony said stiffly, looking down at the red pillow he was hugging against his chest. “That doesn’t mean I wouldn’t do the same thing again to protect my family.”
“Fuck…” Bucky moaned around Tony, dropping from his hand to his elbow on the bed so he could stroke what he wasn’t sucking on. He missed this so much, feeling full up, having Steve sinking deep into him as well as having a cock to suck on at the same time. This was new, and he was going to request that it be something the do a lot.
Steve nodded a little, taking a reluctant bite of his omelette as he pretended to be interested in his plate. He knew what he was unloading on Sam, and he knew how it was going to affect him. They’d been best friends since high school, and as much as they’d yet to admit to each other, they were brothers in each others hearts.
“Not this again,” Tony moaned, leaning back in his chair and covering his eyes in an attempt to hide from his uncle and all the protocol and institution he’d dragged into the room with him.
“Please, have a seat,” Ms. Carr said, taking one herself at the head of the table. “Before we begin, we’re going to have to ask you to sign a contract.”
“And I’m not leaving you behind. Never,” Steve insisted, looking up when he realized he heard bootsteps through the house still. The guards were looking for them, the fire was just insurance in case they couldn’t. “Bucky, we have to go now.”
“Honestly? Kind of. I thought there was no way that he could hide something like this from you, I thought you had to know what was going on,” Steve said as he looked at Tony, frowning. “I assumed that your relationship with you dad was like me and my mother, because she was terrible at keeping secrets from me. I knew my Christmas presents pretty much the night she bought them, she’d drop these horrible hints and I’d know what I was getting right away. I know now that I shouldn’t have done that, especially considering all the security I had to go through to get to Bucky’s room. If you’d have known, he’d have just been kept here.”
He couldn’t think of a better way to describe Bucky, he felt like he could breathe again after drowning for years. Even with the threat of being murdered hanging over him, he wouldn’t change taking his job, he wanted to be near Bucky, even if just as his friend.
“Call me a nerd, but I’m hoping for a log cabin style place. I made a small one for a show and tell once,” Steve chuckled sheepishly, though he was glad that his tales of being a dork usually made Bucky laugh.
“…I know I can’t talk you out of this, I know how you are with someone you love and...” Sam took a deep breath, staring to dig into his omelette as well, taking his cue from Steve to start acting like he didn’t hear his best friend was in mortal danger. “I want you to check in with me more than that, Steve. Every other day at least, but I won’t hand over the envelope for two weeks. I just want to know that my friend is alive.”
“Tony…Tony, I fucking love you…” Bucky moaned loudly, not caring if they were overheard by the guards in the hall. As far as he was concerned, they were going to have to get used to that noise from them. He was already so sensitive from Steve fucking him, the second Tony entered him, he felt like each thrust was like a strike of lightning.
“I appreciate that, thank you,” Tony didn’t want to discuss this in front of everyone, having worried that his act wasn’t realistic enough. He still worried that something was going to happen to Steve and Bucky, he still wished he could feel better about that.
“He’s carrying my children, you won’t shoot him either,” Tony said, about to step forward when he watched his father take the safety off the gun, directing it back at Bucky.
“So do you think Namor is going to show up?” Bucky asked, leaning his head back against the chair, loving how soft and plush it was. He felt like he was sinking into a cloud.
“Are there bad wizards? Like from bad places?” Tony said finally, figuring that question was safe enough, and that Strange might inadvertently answer it.
“Its my understanding that they go to jail,” Pepper took her pencil with the same hand she was holding the book in. “I’ve also heard that any meetings about revolutions or anything like that end in death too.”
“I’m not going to win, Mom, there’s a one in a…I don’t know how many, but the odds aren’t good,” Steve said, though he regretted being so negative when he saw his mother’s shoulders fall a bit. Maybe he should just let her have this bit of hope, who was he to crush her dreams? “But…I mean, someone has to win, right? Why can’t it be us?”
“Steve let me practice on him a lot,” Bucky purred as he pulled back again, licking a stripe up the side of his dick, pressing another kiss to it. “He’s the only one I’ve been with though, so you can thank him telling me what felt best.”
“What do you think you’re going to paint?” Tony walked over to Steve as the man began to explore his new studio space.
“Tony, we have to talk…” Steve started, not knowing where they were heading, but knowing they were going to need a doctor nearby.
“He’s the King, he can take as long as he wants,” Steve reminded her, straightening his new royal blue outfit, feeling awkward wearing the white fur lined cape that went with it. He’d never work clothes like this before, he didn’t imagine it would be possible to do anything but stand around in them. Even the black leather shoes pinched his feet. It wasn’t his toes that he was concentrating on, though; the object of his attention was sitting on the other side of the room looking gorgeous in black.
“No, I’m not marrying some snob. It’s bad enough I have to spend my days surrounded by them,” Tony shook his head, not paying close enough attention to his uncle to notice the man tense up. “I want to marry someone nice. Someone that will want to do their own thing so I can do mine here. Maybe they can help Pepper run this place.”
Tony winced a little as he heard Strange swear from behind the stage area, but he hoped that it would work. He didn’t want to see anyone get hurt over this. He was just going to owe Strange big time, hoping he hadn’t bought himself a debt that he couldn’t repay. He would deal with that later, he had this to concentrate on for the moment.
“Maybe whoever wins the lottery can talk to King Anthony and possibly get the taxes lowered,” Steve’s mouth watered as he waited to dig into his food, knowing he’d burn himself if he wasn’t patient.
“Yeah, Bucky’s friend is guarding them, they’re fine. No one’s going to find them there,” Tony grinned widely, able to finally tell his uncle the truth. “So I don’t have to marry Von Doom, or Pepper. I can marry the men I love, and then together, we’re going to fix my history of stupid mistakes.”
“I think that may be a good idea,” Von Doom nodded, looking over at Stane for a moment before giving Tony another smile. “My exhaustion is catching up to me a bit, I think the whiskey is to blame for that.”
“I don’t think anyone in the whole kingdom is going to forget to go to that,” Steve laughed, shaking his head as he pictured in his head what he thought that night was going to look like. “I don’t think anyone’s going to be talking about anything else for a long time after. We don’t get many chances like this, and you can only sit in the pub for so long before you need something else to do. Too bad this doesn’t happen more often.”
“Can you really?” Stane questioned, leaning forward. “Do you want to spend your life with someone who only loves you for your money?”
“I don’t mean to be rude, but…why?” Tony asked, leading Bucky down the corridor towards his workshop. “Is it the arm? Because that would be really stupid. You can’t catch arm loss.”
“Jesus, Bucky,” Tony whimpered as Bucky hit a nerve, bringing the tears even faster. Reaching out to him, he pulled the young man into a hug, crushing him against his chest as he buried his face against Bucky’s shoulder. “I don’t deserve this…I don’t deserve your mercy..”
“We…we ironed things out,” Steve said softly, rubbing Bucky’s back. “I apologized, we kissed, and then we realized that we were going to be separated forever anyway. Until now, that is. Until…” He blinked hard, his eyes misting up as the thought of being with Bucky and Tony forever hit so many emotions at once.
Bucky looked at Steve worriedly for a moment before he nodded slowly, getting out of the car once he couldn’t see anyone else out on the streets. Taking Tony by the hand, still holding his bucket in the other, he walked inside the clinic, trembling all over as his eyes darted around.
“Then talk to me about meaningful things, not how much I like my hay bed,” Bucky laughed quietly, knowing they had to keep relatively silent just in case. “I wish we had something to do up here.”
“And do you Steven Grant Rogers accept these two men into your heart? Do you pledge to give them the best of yourself every single day? Do you swear your loyalty to them through troubles or triumphs?” the priest touched Steve next, his pale old hand giving his arm a squeeze.
“I think Dad would have approved of this,” Tony joined Stane, watching out and readying himself to go out there and choose his intended. “Maybe…right?”
“No, no I didn’t,” Rhodey shook his head, really wondering what had got into his friend. “Was I supposed to watch for him? I was just told to come here after lunch to meet you.”
“That’s good, because I don’t want you to be a monk either,” Steve exhaled, scratching the back of his head as he stood upright. “I think I’d miss you too much, as well as, well…”
“How far along am I? Can you tell what I’m having?” Bucky asked, watching the screen, trying to keep as calm as possible.
“You okay, Buck?” Tony asked as he broke his lips apart from Bucky’s only to start kissing and biting up his neck. “Everything going okay? You like the two of us spoiling you?”
“Why are you still burning this place? What about Namor’s body?” Bucky asked, wanting more for his friend than to just be left in a burning building.
“…so, twins…” Tony sighed softly, taking Bucky’s other hand after fixing his shirt. “My grandmother was a twin, it might be my fault.”
“I can go first, I don’t mind. Tony…” Steve locked eyes with his boyfriend as he took his hand, flashing him a smile as he realized what he wanted to say. “Tony, you are so compassionate, you have so much life and love in you, and being around you makes me feel the same way. So I’m saying you’re contagious, but in the best way possible. Thank you for inviting me into your home and heart, you’re amazing, and I love you to pieces. And Bucky…” Steve turned to him next, unable to keep the corner of his lips from lifting as he squeezed Bucky’s hand. “I think you’re the first person I really loved with all my heart. You’re constantly saying about the things you don’t know or haven’t seen, and I just want to experience it all while holding your hand. I don’t want to let go of you, I feel like all the light would go out in me…” Taking a deep breath, Steve fought back tears as he looked at Bucky, trying his best to calm down. “I love you so much…”
“I’m not the one you work for,” Bucky replied without a pause, turning back to his game, and taking out another zombie.
“I’ll start a fire,” Steve said, going to the wood stove to throw in some paper and kindling with a smaller log, lighting it up so the flames would be ready for the bits of their floor.
“Hopefully it won’t get much worse and Dr. Marner can get them out of you soon,” Steve pulled Bucky over into a hug as Tony got back in the SUV and began to drive towards town. “You should have woken us up, I don’t like the thought of you suffering alone.”
“Then we’ll have do teach you,” Tony replied, putting his other hand on Bucky’s shoulder. “I promise you, I’d never hold something like that against you.”
“I think most of these paintings could feed a block of houses for a year,” Bucky replied, examining some fruit he’d never seen before. It was yellow and sweet, but it was full of little strands that got stuck in his teeth. Still, he couldn’t stop eating it.
Tony stepped off the bottom stair, looking into the clear bedroom at a tall blonde sitting on a bed next to another person with their face buried against their legs. “…so which one? Why are there two of them?”
Steve’s face ached as he couldn’t wipe the grin off of it, his heart skipping in his chest like it hadn’t in years. He’d thought Bucky was the only one for him for so long, he’d never opened up the possibility of being with someone else. But Tony was amazing, he was smart and thoughtful, and he was more complex and wonderful than Steve had dreamed he could be.
“Gods…yeah, we will be,” it still didn’t seem real to Steve, it was like he was waiting for everyone to come out and say that it was all a trick. His life had never been this wonderful, it was a hard thing to accept. “Bucky, does this all seem weird to you?”
Steve frowned, looking down at his food to avoid his mother’s eyes. He didn’t like her suggestion, but it made sense to him. He just didn’t know if Bucky would accept his help or throw it back in his face. Frankly, he felt like he deserved the latter.
“You know very well we were,” Tony’s uncle, Obadiah Stane, said with annoyance in his voice as he walked down the stairs to get a better look at whatever his nephew was up to. “What is that?”
“Wow…” Steve whispered, leaning his head back to see as they walked up the aisle, going around the stage to a door hidden behind it. “It’s beautiful in there. Did you see, Bucky?”
“I know…” Steve waited for the sound of the shower upstairs before he turned to Tony, looking very serious. “Tony, if you can’t stay here, you have to tell us now. You have to tell me now.”
“I don’t want to be scared, though, I want to feel confident. I want to feel like I can do this, my entire life has been leading up to this it feels like,” Bucky said, his voice a low whisper, biting his lip as soon as he said it. “Not that I’m saying this is anything like what I’d thought was going to happen. I just mean there was a lot of pressure to have a good pregnancy and deliver healthy babies, so right now I’m thinking about all the stuff they made me read.”
“If you say so,” Bucky picked up his second piece of bread, taking a bite, looking at his visibly nervous friend. “…what is it? We’re not being kicked out, are we?”
“Yeah, I have some baseball video games,” Bucky nodded over at the bookcase of games in the far corner. “They’re probably a lot more fun to play if you’ve played the real game before. I’m pretty good at the them, but…I don’t know.”
“Just tell us which one you want,” Taking the tablet in her hand, Ms. Carr made a few changes to reflect the raise and motorcycle before turning it back towards Steve with a smile on her face. Though it looked happy enough, Ms. Carr felt more like a spider who had just trapped a fly.
“…alright, a truce then,” Bucky’s voice was gruff, and his irritation evident, but he extended his hand to Sarah. “Also, we won’t sabotage you, you don’t sabotage us. Let’s play fair, I don’t want to make this dirty.”
“So, as my first act as your King, your proper King, I will ask for the woman who would be my new mother, and the other who is like a sister to step forward. And I’d ask them to bring to me what I gave to them this morning,” Tony said, keeping his expression as calm as possible as the heavy doors at the back of the chapel opened. He tried to keep his eyes forward as much as he could, but it was hard to not look over at Stane as Sarah and Natasha stepped forward with Steve and Bucky on their arms.
“You’re right,” Tony pursed his lips, closing his hand around the tickets before pointing at Steve and Bucky. “You and you. My tent. Now.”
“I don’t even know…” Bucky wept brokenly, staring at the doctor and the operating room behind her with fear in his eyes. “I don’t know. I don’t know.”
“Thank you, I appreciate that, I’ll be in touch,” Dr. Marner said before turning the feed off, knowing the three men wanted to celebrate.
“So far he seems competent,” Steve replied, keeping close, knowing that they couldn’t be heard talking. He would try to disguise his voice, but Sam always just laughed at him whenever he tried to do a voice other than his own. Being quiet was probably safer.
Steve turned to the contract, looking over the job description to see if there was anything Ms. Carr had neglected to mention. His eyes stopped when they hit something she hadn’t brought up yet, looking up at her curiously. “What does this mean? This part about his eighteenth birthday?”
“I’m moving you two upstairs today, do you want to share a room or do you want separate rooms? And this can be a temporary as you want it to be, I will get that chip out of you, Bucky,” Tony said, watching as Bucky relaxed a bit with his father gone. “You’re not going to live in a cell for a moment longer. Do…do you trust me?”
“That’s exactly what I was thinking,” Sarah perked up again, already picturing her son in expensive clothes, maybe with a fur lined blue cape to set off his eyes. “You’re such a handsome young man, I bet King Anthony would choose you if he got to know you. He’d see you as I do, I know he would, he’s a smart man.”
“I’m just not interested in anyone I know,” clarified Steve, hoping at least this laid some of his mother’s worries to rest. “I’m just happy to have my job, live with you, and hang out with Sam a few nights a week. I don’t want that to change right now.”
“Come on then, try it on,” Steve said, assisting Tony as they carefully strapped the arm to Bucky’s body, making sure they didn’t do it up too tight or too loose. “How does that feel?”
“We have to go through the roof and we have to do it now,” Steve said urgently, crawling across the floor as quietly and quickly as he could manage, pressing his hands against the inside of the roof, looking desperately for a weak spot in the thatch roof. “Bucky, start looking for a spot we can go through.”
“I don’t know, but I don’t think we can go through the front door,” looking back down through the hole, Steve watched as some burning torches were being brought in. “Oh no…”
“That would make sense,” Steve noted, though he wasn’t very happy about it. “I know it’s going to work, at least. I don’t see me wanting to let go either one of you that entire night.”
“I love you both too,” Bucky said, trying to keep his eyes open as long as he could before he lost his battle and fell back into a deep sleep, aided by the painkillers coursing through his system. He looked like an angel as he slept, his dark eyelashes fanning out above his pale cheeks.
Bucky nodded, tears streaming down his face as he covered it, taking a moment to cry into his hands before he looked at Tony again. Not saying a word, he stepped forward to hug him tightly, clenching his eyes shut as he continued to weep. It wasn’t the same as having his arm back, but it was the closest thing he could ever hope for. It was the most thoughtful gift he could imagine.
“No, he didn’t,” Steve moved down in the bed a bit, lying on his side next to Bucky. “But I don’t think many people would recognize that, I think a lot of people would have found him easy to blame.”
“I think you might be be better off where you are,” Steve said as he took a seat himself, not bothering with the menu either. He didn’t feel very hungry at the moment, but he knew he had to order something. “I haven’t had one of those for a long time, that and a coffee sounds perfect right now.”
“No. All I thought about all night was seeing you two again. I just thought you might want one,” Tony said softly, understanding Steve’s frustration. “We’re going to get him home soon.”
“I don’t know, it looks like they went all out for this, why go cheap at the end of the night?” Bucky shrugged, wondering if he should get them each another beer, and maybe try to grab some more cake. “Just in case, we should pig out now.”
“Gods damn…” Tony closed his eyes and let his head fall back, sweat beading out his brow as he tried to breathe evenly. Nothing was working, however, and he didn’t want to stop the cause of his irregular breathing. Not yet anyway.
“I can’t think of any either, I can just…” Stane trailed off, suddenly thinking for a moment of a name he’d heard in whispers before. “What if I told you I might know of someone in the neighbouring Kingdom that we might be able to convince to work for us?”
“Yeah, Buck?” Steve responded, still rubbing Bucky’s shoulder as he watched his expression, wondering what it was that had Bucky so stumped. He could be slow with decisions, Steve was used to that, but this was the first time he could really see Bucky struggling with something. “Whatever it is, I promise you, I won’t get upset.” He was waiting for another horrible secret to drop, another reason to hate Howard Stark and to want to protect Bucky at all costs. He told himself he would be prepared for what Bucky had on his mind.
Bucky didn’t reply, he only looked Steve up and down once before he looked at Natasha and nodded briefly. Natasha didn’t move for a moment, giving Steve one hell of an “I’ll cut you if you wrong him” look before stepping to the side.
“It’s the first one you showed me,” Steve let out the breath he’d been holding in, delighted with the reaction from both Tony and Bucky, who hadn’t stopped staring at it since he uncovered it. “I wanted to include little things about us in there. Like how Bucky and I first kissed under a pear tree.”
“It’s a lot of work and not a lot of time. If I’m doing this, I have to decide to do it now so I can start everything. I don’t have time to hesitate.”
As Steve and Bucky walked into the room together, Tony felt like his heart was going to leap out of his chest. Just looking at the two of them, he wanted to reach out and pull them both close, beg them not to leave him when he told them what he was about to. He just kept imagining them storming out of the room, slamming the door behind them, leaving him to a life with Victor Von Doom.
“Believe it,” Tony gave them a tight-lipped smile, realizing that they probably had no idea how boring this opulence was. They would soon, they’d probably leave this place to go back to a normal life if they knew what they were getting into.
“What are you talking about? It’s a good thing you did, now we can figure out who is trying to kill him and Steve,” Natasha didn’t look happy about this in the least, clearly worried about her friend.
“No…” Stane gasped, having to catch the volume of his voice at the last moment there lest he give himself away.
“I would have never, ever done that to you,” Tony said, still stroking Bucky’s hair, his thumb moving down to catch some of the tears from his eyes. He knew that Bucky trusted and loved him, but he could still understand that lifelong fear residing in the darkest spots of Bucky’s mind still. “They need their Pops as much as they need their Papa and their Daddy.”
Raising his hand to knock again, Steve bit down on his bottom lip, mentally willing himself to rap his knuckles against it. Squeezing his fist tight, he took a long breath in, wincing as his wrist flexed, causing a singular strike of his index knuckle against the wood surface. It was pathetic, but there was a chance it was at least heard inside.
“That’s never a sentence you want to hear,” Tony said as he sat out back his newly remodelled home with his husbands, a beer in one hand and a handful of almonds in the other. “Peter, you’re supposed to hang off those, not climb on top of them. You too, Gwen, that’s a roof.”
“Night, Tash…” Bucky called out as he took off his shirt and trousers, just letting them fall to the floor on top of his discarded boots. His hair was still in a neat braid from Tony earlier, and he planned on sleeping with it like that.
“Okay, considering how long it takes for me to get dressed up and slap a crown on my head, do you really want me to go do that?” asked Tony, giving Pepper a warm smile and cocking his head, trying his best to look cute. “I can just go there like this, and we can get this started that much sooner. I mean, do we really need me to be dressed up for this?”
One that Peter had planned to meet and do his best to make him fall in love with Steve’s stupid little brother/nephew/whatever. He gets that tensions were high and that Tony was as close to the bright white light as anybody would ever like to see him at ever again, but still! Steve Rogers knew better!
Peter groaned internally, they had literally only gotten to two shops before they’d been outed! Whatever, he’d just go with Ned and pick out something Tony would secretly hate but claim to love for Peter’s sake at a later date.
“Get who?” Peter questioned, shaking his head when Clint showed him the ‘at home spy kit’ he was meddling with.
“Well, funny you should ask…” Steve said, almost giddy. He looked like he was about to pull out a comically large cake and have his boyfriend jump out with confetti, but no, at the table it was just Tony, Steve, and Peter.
“Petey!” Tony said excitedly, if not a little dopey. This time, it did not evade Peter’s notice that Steve retracted his hand from Tony’s and moved a little farther away.
Peter had spent his night on the side bench of his father’s bed, and when morning came the man had the audacity to send Peter to school. “
Steve’s head snapped back up to meet his eye line then, and if Peter hadn’t said the words himself he might’ve thought someone just asked him when he was going to overthrow Napoleon and take back France. Steve opened his mouth, but no words came out. He was saved a second later with Bruce interrupting in a chaotic hurry.
“Not unless I got detention without realizing.” He responded. Tony again looked at him like he’d grown another head.
“I know!! I was shocked too!” Peter said. Feeling more excited about gossiping about his families love life than starting on the arrows he’d promised, Peter began to spin a little while he talked. So Steve hadn’t told Tony either, that meant it was so new that Peter could forgive him for not telling him sooner.
Because he was kind of in a precarious situation. Steve was like a father figure to him, and Tony, well, Tony
Steve, in nothing but a pair of over-washed “AC/DC” pajama pants stumbled into the kitchen and looked at Peter through tired eyes curiously, a question on his lips that his brain had not formulized.
Shopping with his family felt like the body builders of the world had collectively decided to dress at a community college’s lost and found. Everybody assumed that if you wore a cap that hid your hair, and a hoodie that did little to hide shape, then you had effectively got one over on the general public. Even Clint and Natasha, who were internationally recognized spies fell into this unfortunate trap of everyday wear as going ‘incognito’. In reality, the only person Peter could typically go a whole day with in public without getting recognized, was Bruce, and even then they had to stick to the parts of town not known for their STEM students.
Peter’s attention was lost as soon as they reached the part of the line that had dividers between them and was stacked with candy and magazines. Typically, he ignored the headlines because they rarely if ever spouted anything good, but this time he saw a few familiar faces smiling back at him from the cover of US weekly, and his interest was piqued.
kid who is shopping for six super enhanced individuals, Christmas can be a real homemade card as a thanks for saving the world affair. No one ever complained, but Peter always knew.
Genius, billionaire, philanthropist Anthony Edward Stark thought he could stabilize a radioactive element when it was seconds away from bursting, and thus presented the well deserved seat in the ICU he now had.
“What are you working on, kid?” He looked exhausted, but anybody that pointed that out to his face was sure to get some annoyingly faulty tech in the near future.
“I told him not to worry about it. His boyfriend will know it’s fake. Remember when they used to write all those things about you and Rhodey? Or you and Bruce?” And that, Tony actually laughed. It was shaky, and not at all as good humored as what he thought it might be. Whatever, maybe he would still tell Thor about it later. If he asked, Thor would pretend as if he hadn’t known and they could freak out about this in peace. “Do you think he’ll let us meet him? Do you think we’ll like him? What do you think Steve’s ‘type’ is? If he does bring him around, please don’t freak him out---- I’m sure he can ignore the picture but all those joking pet nicknames you call Steve might throw him off, and I want Steve to bring him around!” Peter let his mouth ramble off all the useless thoughts in his head.
Peter turned to look at the clock, and cursed when it said 7:15. No, there was no time. If he missed homeroom again and Mrs. Steinbrenner had to call Tony Stark again, Peter would probably not see the inside of a lab for weeks. He shook his head sadly. “No, it’s grab-n-go for me.” Peter moved closer towards Steve, but reached behind him for the fruit bowl as he picked out a banana that would suffice. Steve yawned loudly, and realizing he had never really heard that from the Captain’s mouth before, Peter turned to look at him and possibly taunt him until he noticed an ugly, prominent bruise just on his collar line.
“Shouldn’t you be in school?” His eyes squinted like he could see the lie on his face, but of this, Peter was totally innocent. School ends at 3, just like it has every day.
Peter smiled at that softly, and made it as far as the hallway door before he thought to ask, “can I go in?” What if his dad was like… undergoing surgery, or surrounded by doctors and not needing his kid to mess with the room.
“Don’t worry, Steve.” Peter sighed sympathetically. He let his hand rest on one of Steve’s massive biceps in a comforting manner. Steve hardly reacted at all to the touch, but seemed to follow peter’s word closely. “Everybody knows the press has really good photoshop.”
“Excuse me?” Tony asked, slightly muffled by the thick mask. Even still, Peter could hear the shock in his every syllable.
“Peter” Tony laughed. He had finally stopped fidgeting and regarded Peter’s very sensible concerns as some kind of cosmic joke. “I can promise you, he’ll love you.”
Even at the table, Steve kept on trying to catch Peter’s eye, but without even trying to hide it, Peter made it clear he was ignoring him until he could have a proper talking to.
Tony lost his grip on his tool and the sound of metal hitting the floor resounded. That was weird, Tony was famously known for his steady engineer hands.
Thor’s eyebrows knitted together as he looked down at the box in hand. “Oh.” He said sadly. “Then I shall get all of them!”
“Floor 90.” JARVIS announced. Peter thanked him, and exited the elevator. Natasha, Thor, Bruce, Rhodey, and Clint were all lounging about in the common area, some talking in hushed voices and others staring out the windows like the answer lay in the horizon. All heads snapped when they heard the elevator, and Thor was first to fill the silence. “Peter!”
But whatever, that’s the kind of adolescence every singer writes about rebelling about. He stumbles to the bathroom to clean up, and then stumbles back out into an eerily quiet kitchen. With two eyes just cracked enough to see the cabinets, he pulls out his cereal and bowl in relative quietness. Most of his family members have rooms with enough distance between them and the kitchen that Peter could stage an elaborate tap dance sequence with an ill-fitting bass drop and only ever wake up JARVIS. But his dad’s room was closer---- and being a man who hated to sit still almost as much as he hated people who called him “Anthony” unironically, Peter elected to ere on the side of caution. Typically, Tony Stark was up and annoying Peter by the break of dawn. He claimed it was because he was, in fact, a morning person (or that he was just a really, really, late owl) but Peter had a sneaky suspicion it had all the more to do with who was awake at the ass crack of dawn. Like clockwork, every weekday morning there Tony was, brewing up something that was so caffeinated it probably surpassed the legal definition of coffee, and asking Peter what his plans were for the day. Even when Peter’s general hatred for all things not past double digits on the clock overtook his otherwise normal personality, Tony Stark was there. It should be noted, that the only person Peter actually believed to be a disgusting “morning person” was Steve, who took his morning jogs next to the paper trucks he was up so early. And Peter didn’t see a trace of him either, so he chocked it all up to the late night movie marathon the group had had last night, and went about his business quietly. Lord knows his dad needs sleep, so he let him have it.
“It’s fine, Steve.” Peter said tiredly. “Just know that I know. Or at the very least will find out.” He put on his best tough guy voice to showcase that he really could talk like the rest of them, but ended up having to exhale the breath he’d been holding for fear of choking.
Peter Parker was a great, wild, many things. He was talkative… almost every teacher he’d ever had said the words “Peter’s great to have in class,
So that’s how Peter found himself in a mall in November, surrounded by the Avengers in varying forms of ‘street clothes’. Well, except his father. His dad claimed that malls were where ‘the black plague really started’ and he was notorious for getting bored of shopping, tweeting their location out in a power move to get the Avengers to just go home. So he stayed back, which was for the best, considering Peter was shopping for his gift first.
“He’s a SHIELD agent too! I thought Steve would date the underside of a public school desk before he ever dated someone from SHIELD, but he says he met them through work, and unless he’s a barista at some café I don’t know about…” Tony merely mmhmm’ed at that. Ugh, of all the people to know last it just had to be Tony! At least Thor would gossip with him, or Clint would go down the conspiracy theory hole but Tony was acting as if this were no giant revelation! Uhhhh hello! Steve hasn’t had a date since the 40’s, this was officially ‘IHOB’ freak out levels! “We were shopping for Christmas presents when Nat brought it up, something about getting him a present…”
“B-bye.” Steve called after him, in a softer and much more serious voice than typical. Jeez, you’d think being the heir to the most kidnappable man in the world would be cause for just a little bit of leeway, but apparently no dice. Whatever, he’d just have to remind himself to google “Captain America” later to see what big bad had gotten a swipe in on Steve.
Yeah, his dad was definitely on pain killers. But sue him, Peter couldn’t help but laugh at his father’s (out of date) use of pop culture, and he just took his seat by the bed, took his father’s hand as a
That sparked a genuine reaction in his father. One eyebrow shot up, and his mouth did that little one side up and the other down which foregoed the need to ask a verbal ‘why?’
When Peter finally hit high school his father let him enter the design part of R&D. Before then, sure he could tinker like the rest of them but he couldn’t do more than screw in a few bolts, or suggest ventilation where ventilation had no previously been noted. He still wasn’t allowed to operate some of the bigger, more dangerous machines but now after school, Peter could race down to the labs and get his hands dirty with Dum-E and his dad.
“I take it that was your breakfast.” Steve said, getting the dust pan from the kitchen and therefore removing any incriminating evidence.
Steve stared at him with that blank look that was becoming annoyingly commonplace. Either he was terrified of Peter’s opinion of the man, or ashamed of Peter because he never carried the conversation past that one day in the mall. But today was meant to be first contact! And unless Peter was boyfriend-blind, then Steve was here solo!
“No, I don’t think so. Thor got mobbed and we had to make a break for it. Although we did pass by a pretty funny magazine that said all this tea about Captain America and Iron Man making out.”
Later, it came time for presents. Peter ended up getting Thor the ‘Bruce Banner’ action figure, both to annoy Bruce and please Thor. Natasha got Clint a coffee mug that said ‘bad bitch’ in the ugliest, bedazzled fashion that peter had ever seen (Clint wiped away a few tears--- both real and fake when he saw it). And finally, from the side of Peter’s view, he saw Steve hand Tony a small, wrapped box. Peter’s own unwrapping halted as he watched the scene unfold, with the small taste of bitterness still fresh on his lips. He wondered if Steve got his boyfriend a gift too. If his boyfriend knew that he’d gotten Tony one. If Tony knew at all.
“----Well what do you want to get him?” Natasha asked. Steve opened his mouth to answer, a look of deep thought on his face that dissipated into surprise when Peter joined the conversation.
.” He said sternly. “Maybe you’ll learn how to rewire the mainframe, while diverting auxiliary power to restart the meltdown at a slower speed.” He said.
Realizing he’d be spotted if he didn’t move, he took the moment that they weren’t liplocked to enter the room. His dad’s face brightened significantly, and for one simple second, Peter forgot that he was mad at him. The man looked absolutely beat, but he’d tried his best to look energized when his son walked in. But Peter couldn’t get that kiss out of his head. Steve Rogers had a boyfriend! One he was serious enough about to mention, and hope to bring about the Avengers and cheating with Tony Stark was no way to go about love.
“fine, fine! All I’m saying is no matter how cool this guy is---- you have to be on my side. Okay? You’re my dad first and Steve’s friend second.” Peter joked. But Tony turned rather serious. He inspected Peter like he was an equation he hadn’t quite solved yet, and with no sarcasm dotting his words said “Of course, Peter. You know you’re first.”
Tony clutched the tags as if it were a precious artifact, perhaps the most precious thing in the universe. He looked down again, as if to confirm it wasn't an illusion and finally got his stunned mouth to say more than his name.
” He cooed, a bit childishly. “Who is she? Or he? Or them? I gotta admit, I don’t actually know your type.” He seemed to be the only one excited about this revelation though, and felt a little out of the loop at that. Peter told Steve about the girl who had smiled at him in the lunch line once in middle school, and about the boy whose hand had brushed over his in chemistry once---- it was kind of disheartening this was the first he was hearing about a ‘good friend’.
Tony hmmm’ed and hmmrupf’ed at a few things here and there. He used the pen he typically kept behind his ear to scratch at a few things, but otherwise seemed impressed and passed it back to Peter in record time.
“yeah, cars move a lot differently when horses no longer pull them.” Tony responded, clearly pleased with his own joke.
He turned back to the hallway, opened the door and continued down to the last door in the corridor to the right. He had extended towards the door handle, when his eyes caught sight of the glass that separated Tony’s room and Peter’s position.
“Clint, we have the world’s best comms at the tower, let’s just go.” Steve rationed. But he knew he was fighting a losing battle almost immediately. Clint pouted, and he just sighed, “fine, let’s just make it quick.”
It had been just about a week since the events of Oscorp. When exams were over and school released for the winter break, peter found it increasingly difficult to dodge a person that he lived with. He’d entertained Clint to as much as he could take, practiced Russian with Nat till he had his заполнить, and even essentially third wheeled a few Thor and Bruce dates. He’d still frequent the lab, but his father and his own work went about relatively quiet. Tony asked if there was anything bothering him, and he simply said no. Tony asked if he was freaked that he had almost died, and Peter said no again. Steve picked up on the difference almost immediately, and not a day went by where Steve didn’t ask ‘you doing alright?’ in that soft, confused voice that Peter no longer trusted.
“A guy from work.” He deadpanned. Natasha looked away after Steve said that, and he half wondered if she was looking for the person now. She however just seemed to be pursuing her lips, with the corners of her mouth upturned like Steve deserved a comedy special or something.
…”. He was stubborn, a trait his family noted as hereditary and Tony noted as “your problem”. And he was also not, even in the vaguest of terms, a morning person. But what person is when school is what the alarm clock beeps for?
Steve ducked his head, and Peter noticed the soft crimson that tainted his otherwise white cheeks, and felt a rush of warmth at the idea that Steve had someone that could get him flustered like that.
“Dad.” Peter scolded, feeling the accompanying power high that followed chastising your own father at the dinner table.
However, tonight, Tony was out of his element. He kept fiddling with everything. The placement of his napkin---which he decided needed to be exactly 3 centimeters to the left. And then .05 to the right. And just slightly down. His phone, which he kept tapping on to see if anything new had exploded in the past 3 seconds since he last looked (it hadn’t), and his fingers which tapped the table incessantly. Steve was introducing his boyfriend tonight. And being two prominent figures in the life of Steve Rogers, Peter could understand the trepidation. There was always the chance that they wouldn’t get along, or they’d say the wrong thing and then Steve would feel the need to separate two great facets of his life.
“Steve…” Tony breathed softly, looking up at Steve with a look Peter had never seen cross his face. I mean sure, it was love. Peter knew that look indefinitely, but love mixed with…
But as the fates would have it, he was scraping off the last bits of bowl into the trash when he heard the soft, almost nonexistent opening and closing of the door. And although it was coming from the only room within ear range, there was no way it was Tony (his father opened doors like he was trying to catch Peter cheating with another father).
Peter argued. Complained. Exaggerated, and even faked a cold, but still, no dice. Tony called Happy and Happy drove a petulant Peter to school like they had reverted to his elementary days. Either out of spite, worry, or a beautiful mixture of the two, Peter hadn’t paid attention to a single thing in class. People approached him, questioned him, nagged him about what happened but much as he had his entire life, he didn’t give much up. He was lost in his own thoughts. Much like New York, he had almost lost his dad that night.
Maggiano’s on third was probably one of the most delicious places on the planet. Okay, not really, but it was the only place that they believed Tony Stark was ‘Guy Fierri as his fake name credit card said. It was one place they could typically sit and have an uninterrupted evening out of the tower, as the restaurant had like three tables total, and was manned entirely by a lovely Italian couple who really only spoke in their native language. Sometimes Peter thinks Tony only likes it here because he gets to flex his Italian in front of company, but peter can do more than keep up.
Steve was only a small part of it actually, but there were big arrows pointing and saying “Captain America!?!?!” which left little up to imagination. The title said “Avengers couple celebrate anniversary” and it had a very charming picture of Thor and Bruce at some gala the year previous, and then in a little box above their heads it said “Another avengers romance??” And showed what appeared to be Tony Stark kissing Steve Rogers. It was in a little café where they were bent over the seats, and the picture was fuzzy with little focus on their faces, but honestly, it was convincing.
Steve laughed, and rubbed his eyes. “Yeah, I guess I got tired out faster than I thought…” He mused, but stopped that thought as if he were biting his tongue mid-sentence. He looked behind him, at Tony’s door like he had only just realized it resided there. A few seconds passed before he said, “What happened?”
“peter!” Tony interrupted again. Again, there was a small, knowing smile dotting his face and that just ticked Peter off a bit more. If Tony could freak out on whether or not Steve’s new boo would love the genius known as Iron Man, then peter could freak out as to whether this guy liked kids or not. Not that Peter was a kid. A teenager, technically, but not everyone respected that title.
Peter hid his smile in his hand, whereas Bruce seemed to get more concrete in his ‘don’t you dare’ decision.
“Looks stable. Good work. Also, take out the part about ‘big brother’ in your essay, that’s 1984 not Fahrenheit.” Tony pushed away from the desk with his roll-y chair and back to whatever tinkering he had been at for the past 34 hours.
Peter nodded at that, but the mention of Steve brought up memories of the mall and his brain to mouth filter seemed to be unavailable at the moment.
Even as Christmas was more than a month away, Peter couldn’t help but stress out a little about presents. I mean, as a kid it’s pretty easy to get the best gift on the market, but as
Peter mumbled ‘yeah, yeah’ into the palm of his hand as he texted Happy, and couldn’t help but feel like Steve Rogers went a little far on that escape plan. If he didn’t want Peter to meet his boyfriend, he could’ve just said so.
Steve’s look of utter adoration quickly turned into an all-consuming laugh, but the sentiment remained. “That is so stupid.” He mirrored that strange look his own dad had now, and they kept eye contact for a plethora of seconds past comfortable. Steve had his head in the crook of his hand, and was looking up at Tony with a soft expression doting his face. Tony was standing, still with his present threaded between his fingers and a focus that seemed to erase any other presence from the room but the super solider. Peter recognized that look. It was the same that Thor had when Bruce said something nerdy without realizing. Or Bucky’s face when Natasha wasn’t looking.
Tony stopped working for a moment, seemed to decide on something, and then he pushed up and out of his chair to face Peter. “Peter,” he said earnestly, clearly about to enter into some kind of monologue. Internally, Peter sighed because no offence, but he really didn’t need a lecture on prying into people’s lives when the Avengers knew about peter’s first kiss before he ever even got home.
What hurt though, was that typically, Steve didn’t indulge in that kind of lie. When Tony went into the wormhole above New York, it was Steve’s voice on the other end of the phone line. When Steve had been under the gravel of a newly collapsed building he had told Peter frankly ‘yeah, I could have died. But I didn’t.' with a sincerity few others could match. But by the way Steve was now filtering through unoriginal excuse to unoriginal excuse it was clear that Peter was very much, still a baby in his eyes.
“I’m gonna use them as a fucked up baby monitor, you know, hide them around, and then speak like God through them so-----“
Quickly, Peter rationed that maybe it was like a European kiss. Like the fraternal kiss on the Berlin Wall, or just like a really weak attempt at CPR. But Peter was smart enough to know a brotherly kiss when he sees one, and it didn’t look like that at all. He and Ned had never kissed like that. Steve and Clint surely didn’t.
