'What? No!' Greg rolled his eyes, shoving John's arm as he laughed. 'It's not medical, but it is biological. It's, well...' Greg took another bite of his curry. 'Sherlock's Felisian.'
It took his eyes a moment to adjust, and he wrinkled his nose, examining the shafts of sunlight that filtered down through the holes in the roof. Once, it would have been filled with wares or shelving, possibly both. Now it was simply a huge, open room, penned in by uncertain walls. The flick of the light-switch did nothing, and John peered into the twilight.
The thing was, although he may have grown up, John could still see hints of the wannabe pirate in Sherlock. It bled through in the thrill of the chase along dark city streets. It was there in the roguish hint of his real grin, not the sneers or shamming smiles he gave the rest of the world. Sherlock only played by the rules that suited him and was more than happy to disregard the rest.
The rueful smile on Mary's lips carried a hint of satisfaction to its curve. 'And if not for that? Would you have ever looked closer at what became of me, or would you have let sleeping dogs lie, Sherlock?'
He should have known, back before all this began, that Sherlock would be a dedicated lover. He saw the secrets of John's existence and brought them to light. Why would he not do the same with his desires? He had set about, from that first day, learning all of John's sensitive spots – the bits of his body that made him gasp or groan or grind – and committing them to memory. His devotion inspired John in turn, and he reduced Sherlock to a quivering, keening creature of need at every opportunity.
'I can't believe you spent all week with me and didn't get ill,' John mused, picking up his mug and taking a sip of his tea. 'I bet if we did an antibody test, you'd have them.'
'The idea is a stretch,' Sherlock conceded, 'but it's not without merit. It's certainly better than anything else we have to go on at the moment.'
Cautiously, Sherlock sauntered over to the little cupboard where Mycroft kept his keys, noting immediately where the spare had been: now notably absent. Given, probably, to his guest, which rather suggested something more serious than a quick fling.
John's breath left him in a rush, and he glared at his flatmate as he trotted up the stairs and shrugged out of his Belstaff. 'Why the bloody hell didn't you answer? I thought something had happened.'
He kept waiting for Sherlock to put Sebastian in his place, to rip his life and the veneer of his success to shreds, but he never did.
It was hard not to be captivated by each glossy frame, and John had to force distance between himself and the subjects of the photographs as he remembered Sherlock's instructions. Slowly, he began to sort them into piles, splitting up the images by location until he had a mere handful: pictures captured outside the usual confines of their lives.
A play mat caught his attention, and he picked it up, chattering to Rosie as he detoured back downstairs to the living room. Once she was settled on the soft fabric, giggling at the hanging felt toys and flashing lights above her, he turned towards the bags he'd brought. John kept one eye on Rosie as he sorted through what they had and came to terms with the things he'd forgotten.
'I've rigged a couple of sound traps to catch out anyone trying to sneak up on us. My room should be all right. It's pretty inaccessible, but if enough people break in, it's also a dead end. There's no way out of it without fighting through whoever is coming at us.' He swallowed, wrinkling his nose. He would need sleep eventually, but the thought of getting his head down in his old bed seemed ill-advised at best.
Addict: still written in the story of his skin. Scars he couldn’t see from fights he couldn’t win left silver smears in his mind’s eye. Capillary in left eye fractionally enlarged – the only outward sign of trauma from an overdose. Skin a touch too pallid, cheekbones too prominent. Too many missed meals over the years. They left their mark as clearly as any needle diving into his skin. The body clung to its accusations for years, and there were days when all he could see was his own, personal crime scene.
All that mattered to him was getting Sherlock out in one piece. The sound of the gunshot, followed by Sherlock's shout of pain, haunted him, and every moment was a battle not to let his mind travel down gruesome, fretful paths of concern.
The tip of Sherlock's tongue darted out to wet his bottom lip, his gaze shifting to the side as if he were considering the option of a kind lie, only to dismiss it a moment later. Instead, he faced John fully, tipping his head to one side. 'May I come in?'
The closest thing he could conjure was the notion of soul-mates: a ridiculous, romanticised idea that he had always believed to be ludicrously saccharine. Yet taken at its face-value, stripped of its romantic trappings, it made the most sense.
By the time London's sprawl filled the horizon, John could bear it no longer, and he pointed to the services sign. 'Pull over. You must need to stretch your legs, and I want my bloody gun.'
When it came down to it, John knew there were a hundred and one ways to intoxicate the human body. People didn’t need cocaine or heroin and the like to get high. Black market drugs were just more efficient and, sometimes at least, easier to predict.
How long would it take their adversaries to realise that their quarry had gone to ground, rather than acting as they had hoped? The splinter group had been patient and careful before, but they were running out of time. Like Mary, they stood in the jaws of a closing trap. The file would offer them an escape and allow them to stand against the old guard, but without it they lost any upper hand and would likely succumb to the fierce retribution of the organisation they had betrayed with their desertion.
'I see.' Mycroft's voice sounded muffled, and John could picture him curling his fingers over his lips in thought – his eyes narrowed as he considered their options. 'I will send some of my people to watch Baker Street. There is no point in you and John being easy targets if we can avoid it.'
Greg shook his head, his jaw slack. John knew how he felt. Logic had done a runner. The red-on-white filled his head with its visceral power. Gore did not usually bother him, but there was something about the bloody spectacle and the bird’s cold, uncaring eyes. They were dinosaurs once, or so people said. Looking at the cockatoo, John could well believe it.
Gently, he clasped his hand over the top of Sherlock’s. It was tempting to cling. John would be lying if he said Sherlock’s behaviour wasn’t shaking him down to his core, but his feelings did not take priority right now. He was here to help Sherlock back from the brink of whatever tricks his mind played on him.
He gripped the sink, swallowing hard as the emptiness of his flat clanged all around him. God, why was he even still here? Why had he stayed when Mary had the good sense to pack up and get out? She’d seen the writing on the wall – had realised she had no place in John’s story, not with Sherlock taking up all the pages. There was nothing left for him within these walls, so why did he stay?
Not anymore. The channel carried nothing but the occasional pleasure cruiser for the tourists and a few vessels moored for use as public attractions, like HMS Belfast.
In music, composers noted essential components in the score. Obbligato. For Sherlock to conduct the chaos of his thoughts into a symphony, he needed this.
'Just let me know if you need anything else,' she pleaded. 'Or if not me, then Inspector Lestrade or Mrs Hudson. We're all here for you, John. You and Rosie, all right?'
He was listening, rather than speaking, but the frown on his face was all John needed to realise the likely caller. Mycroft. It had to be. Sherlock never looked quite so annoyed with anyone else.
‘You made that up!’ John’s cheeks ached with the effort of hiding his grin. Sherlock’s face at his accusation was a priceless sight. The cocktail of outrage and disbelief made him look constipated. In fact, it rather strengthened the resemblance between him and Mycroft.
Liar. The accusation rattled around Sherlock's teeth, but he did not free it. He would let John keep his comfortable fibs. Now, more than ever, he could see that John was unravelling at his seams, all his pieces coming apart despite his best efforts to hold himself together.
‘And you didn’t?’ Sherlock challenged. ‘You take almost as much pleasure in upsetting Mycroft as I do.’
Shaking himself free from his rapt reverie, John bit his lip and shifted around the back of the pillar. The lights had been turned off when the class ended, leaving only the piste bathed in the glow from the spots above. He needed to make use of that to get behind the idiot fighting Sherlock, and he had to do it without being seen. From there, he'd be ideally placed to take the fucker by surprise.
The skim of lube-slick fingers against his hole made him whine, and he cocked his legs further apart, his voice nothing but a useless, cracked litany of Sherlock's name on repeat. He was losing himself in increments, unravelling at his seams as Sherlock's fingers pressed in, smoothing the way before curling upwards.
Yet the picture itself was not what disturbed him. Instead, a figure in the background held his attention, catching his eye as his mind whirled and raced.
It was fragile, still, but changing with every passing hour. John's grief bled between them: a vicious, living thing that rose up to strike anew at unexpected moments. Yet each revelation about Mary seemed to weaken its ferocity, diluting John's misery into monotones of guilt and regret.
John cut in, answering Anderson before Sherlock could say anything scathing. ‘More likely she touched them, then ate something without washing her hands. Maybe she got sap on her when she put them in the vase.’
Something pinged off the fuselage, and John swore: a long, loud string of fearsome invective that crackled over the radio and made a cold sweat prickle along Sherlock's hairline.
Sherlock watched him, his pale eyes seeing far too much. Not for the first time since they became flatmates, John felt like a short book with big letters: easily read. Once, he had wanted to hide from that searching gaze, but these days there was something almost comforting in it.
'Sorry,' he murmured, not knowing quite what he was apologising for. Getting ill in the first place? Being a clingy, feverish wreck, so miserable that Sherlock felt compelled to stay with him, not merely at his bedside but in the actual bed? His pointless grief and his awful dreams? All of it? 'Thank you for staying.'
Hanging up his towel to dry, he made the bed and tidied up Rosie's clutter before scooping his daughter back in to his arms. The scent of baby shampoo filled his nose, and he smiled at her as he squared his shoulders and trotted downstairs.
Flicking on the kettle, he glanced towards the baby monitor. For now, at least, Rosie slept on, oblivious. The water steamed as he poured it over a teabag. Caffeinated. His only compromise to the fact it was just gone 2am was that he wasn't drinking coffee. He needed it though. The heat. The clarity. Something to root him in the moment and brace him as he faced up to the truth of his situation.
An uncomfortable knot sat low in his guts, just under his navel. Every time he thought of Mary, it would clench, becoming leaden and hollow. He kept remembering the gunshot, the jerk of her body, the pain in her eyes...
She didn't think John would do it. Even after everything, she believed he wouldn't have the strength to do what
‘Sebastian is skimming funds. I’ve notified the board, financial services and HMRC. He’ll find himself in very hot water before long.’
'Well, I wouldn't go that far. The army used them a lot on exercise. This many decimal places though, it's precise.' John clawed a hand through his hair. 'Down to about a square foot. Maybe a bit more.'
'It's rather a generic virus, really. Well, type of virus, anyway.' John wrinkled his nose. Covid-19 may be novel to humanity, but there were plenty of others in the coronavirus family that had plagued people for centuries.
'I caused a distraction back in London, something to captivate your observers' attention so you could get away unseen. I'm hoping some of what I found in their base of operations will help unravel this once and for all.'
'I thought that would get your attention,' she chided, soft and friendly, before her expression faltered. 'So, this is in case...' She shifted where she sat, pursing her lips and frowning as if in pain. 'In case the worst happens. If you’re watching, then I'm dead.'
‘Bloody hell, Anderson!’ Lestrade huffed. ‘Three hundred years ago, maybe, but are you telling me something like the QE2 is a boat not a ship just because it’s got no masts?’
'Thanks,' he muttered, wincing against the headache that drummed in his temples. 'I needed that. It's been a long, fucked up day.'
In the end, it didn’t matter. Out there, beyond the graveyard’s edge, the world carried on regardless. It didn’t care that Sherlock Holmes was no longer part of it. Why would it care if the same could be said of him? One less soldier in the world. A good thing, surely?
The dial tone buzzed in his ear as he struggled for breath, snatching in sips of air that barely sustained him. The weight of Sherlock's hand settled on his shoulder: a tether to the real world. Black spots danced at the edge of his vision, and strong palms guided him back into his seat.
The shrill ring of his phone cut through the air. Everyone jumped at the noise, twitching where they sat, and John dug in his pocket, pulling it free with a shaking hand.
The fingers were stuffed, bloody end down, in a vase of water, like the world’s weirdest bouquet. The nails, long or short, ragged or manicured, were all painted different colours. Worse, they were wilting, curled and beckoning like talons.
The glass offered up an image of Sherlock, daubed in watercolour tones of reflection. He stared as the streets crawled by, distracting himself with tracing the lines of the profile he had come to know so well. Only the halt of the car outside Baker Street broke into John’s thoughts, and he grimaced as he realised just how long he'd been lost in idle, fond thought.
Sherlock arched up to meet him, his teeth clenched and his eyes closed, twin flags of colour riding high on his cheekbones. He was no mere recipient to John's attentions, but chased after every caress, hungry for more.
Scrambling in his pocket for his phone, he typed as quick as he could, his fingers fat and clumsy as the knot of panic left him.
'You're dead,' he whispered, shaking his head at the phantasm of the friend who meant so much to him. 'You're dead. I saw you fall.'
'Well enough,' she promised. 'She cracked me over the head. The Detective Inspector's taking me to hospital, but it's not that bad.' A distant grumble from Greg suggested he didn't agree, but Molly carried on regardless. 'She was waiting for me at my place. I just had time to see her face. What was the point?'
The silence from Mary deafened him, amplifying the buzzing in his ears until he heard a single, tight breath. Not, he suspected, because she grieved his loss. Rather, it had not been part of her strategy. Did that throw a spanner in the works of her cunning little plan?
Bracing his shoulders, he bullied himself to sit up straighter. Getting to his feet was unthinkable, but for Donovan’s sake, he could present a strong façade.
Fear clenched icy fingers through the cage of Sherlock's ribs, rattling his bones with every breath, but he refused to succumb. Panic would get him nowhere, and it would certainly not help John.
'Sir. There's a body.' The commander lowered a scope from her eye, and John glanced at it. Infrared, judging from the label. 'Temperature is above ambient but below standard. Whoever it is has been dead an hour or more.'
John blinked, raising his eyebrows in surprise, and Sherlock wished he could call the words back, soften them, change them... something! They had slipped out before he'd had a chance to think twice, and now he felt horribly exposed.
'No. Not bloody likely.' John straightened his shoulders, meeting Sherlock's gaze. 'I want to hear what she's got to say. She's our only lead in all of this, at least until you get that file back from the AGRA USB stick. If she can somehow explain all – all of this –' He waved a hand around meaningfully.'–then I want to be there to hear it.'
'Who else knew about that?' John asked, leaning forward. It seemed deranged that someone would kill her for wanting to leave, but he'd seen enough murder to know how twisted motives could be.
John breathed out, a great shuddering sigh as if he were exhaling a year’s worth of emotion in a single moment. Yet when he answered it was with a tightening grip and a certainty that shook Sherlock to his core.
'And they'll be ruthless.' John freed one hand from beneath the quilt, rubbing it down his face as if he were trying to wipe his mind free of his fears: an impossible task.
'That's who is watching John. Not the older members of Harmattan, who I suspect have grudgingly cut their losses, but the new recruits. They have the resources, but they lack the skill that comes with years of practice. I noticed that almost immediately. When they took a photograph of you before your "demise", your expression was one of superiority and recognition. My assumption was right. They were your allies.
'I don't care,' John muttered, his words brutal with chilling indifference. His eyes narrowed, his shoulders rolling back as he relaxed, falling into that soldiering stance Sherlock knew so well: legs spread, feet planted, and his aim rock-steady.
He hated it, but he could not deny that Sherlock's presence brought him some relief. Not from the turmoil of his emotions, but from the tight, anxious energy that consumed his every waking moment. Despite everything, Sherlock, more than anyone else, made him feel safe.
He placed himself in John’s hands, confident in the knowledge that, whatever hardships the two of them may face, he would always find his sanctuary.
The cockatoo fluffed its feathers, its yellow crest flaring as Sherlock indicated their surroundings. ‘A bird that size usually only sleeps in the cage, and the door is shut and latched, meaning someone – probably our victim – made sure it was secure. One assumes she was still in possession of her eyes at the time, since it’s not something you would prioritise otherwise.’
Perhaps it was no coincidence that John’s wardrobe was more of armoire, the roots of its name seated deeply in the truth of it. To the untrained eye it may be nothing but a place for John to keep his clothes, but Sherlock saw it differently. Those jumpers and jeans, shirts and boots were far more than any kind of fashion statement.
'Check with Molly about procedures, all right? Not sure the morgue's equipped for handing potentially virulent samples.' John grimaced, no doubt working through all the considerations. 'The last thing we need is Bart's to be declared some kind of plague zone because you ran a test you shouldn't.'
'Off,' Sherlock grunted, and it took John a few, lust-addled seconds to realise that Sherlock wasn't talking about John himself, but his clothes. 'Bloody jumper. Get it off.'
'It will be. She'll use you as a way to try and get the file, hoping to exploit that same connection, no doubt. She imagines she'll have more luck with you than me. It is your opportunity to prove her wrong.'
'Where the bloody hell did they get that?' John demanded, looping an arm around Sherlock's back to help support his weight and half-bullying him towards the door. 'And why aren't the air force shooting it down?'
He was right. It would be better, the two of them together at last, and he had the rest of his life – at Sherlock's side and in his arms – to prove it.
'I hope your brother is cooperative, Sherlock,' Mary said, her voice carrying a musing, calm quality as if she had not just pointed a gun at him and pulled the trigger. 'It won't go well for you if he's not.'
'But what's that got to do with me?' John sagged in his seat, cuffing a hand through his hair and leaving it tousled. With a sigh, he answered his own question. 'It's not about me though, is it? You're right; it's about Mary. This Dio person vanished at the same time it all went south with AGRA. Maybe Mary knew who they were and they think she told me?'
Sherlock seemed to share that notion. There had been no hurry in his reply. John had heard from both Greg and Molly that he had been in touch with them, informing them he would no longer be assisting the Yard or making use of the morgue. Sherlock was severing ties where he could.
Now he could watch the telly and drink his tea without sitting bolt upright, and could also fall asleep without moving should the mood take him. A wave of gratitude flooded John's chest, wearing smooth the jagged edges of his temper and leaving him to smile at Sherlock's practical care.
John's heart clenched beneath his ribs, panic fluttering shadows like moth wings at the corner of his vision. It was not himself he was concerned for, but Rosie. Whatever her mother's crimes, she was innocent, and there was no more an effective bargaining chip for John's cooperation than his daughter's continued happiness and survival.
Airily, he headed towards his brother’s office. There was a straight path through there to his front door. Sherlock could make a stately, sweeping exit after his parting shot. Perfect.
No, while he could believe that Mary may have told herself she was acting in John and Rosie's best interests, in the end he doubted she truly believed it. She had been thinking about saving her own skin more than her family's well-being.
What did he want to discover? Would he rather Mary was innocent of their suspicions, and that she truly did lie dead and buried? It would be better for John, he felt. A way for Mary to retain some of her former glory in his eyes. Though perhaps even that was beyond their reach, now.
The umbrella swung up between them, the point hovering a fraction of an inch from Sherlock’s chest: a warning and an obstacle.
'No,' Mycroft admitted. 'We did not have the manpower, but we did park some distance from the airfield's boundaries.'
Now, it was Mary she needed to slough away like a snake's skin. It wasn't safe here, not any more. Part of the problem with selling secrets is that you needed a buyer. There was never any shortage, of course, but they could get demanding when their supply dried up.
‘Yes. It was my great grand-father’s.’ Sherlock caught John’s eye, and there was a hint of smugness in his smirk. ‘Sentiment. Though Mycroft would never admit it.’
The door closed behind her. The latch rattled like a cage door, and John swallowed back the tight, panicked feeling of being trapped in his own life: a prison of his own making. He gave Rosie another smile and busied himself with all the things he should be doing: talking to her and playing with her, watching garish cartoons and trying to do anything but let himself think.
John raised an eyebrow, deliberately not glancing in Sherlock’s direction. He could just say no outright. It’s what his mum would have done. Her word was law, and once a choice was made it stayed that way, but that wasn’t how he did things.
‘Then as standard you would get penicillin, but…’  John reached for the book, thumbing through the pages with renewed interest. ‘There was something in here about something new. Cheaper. And with fewer resistance issues. Yeah, all right. If I judged you to be a patient in otherwise good health with no kidney problems, I’d prescribe Tellaflexin and warn you not to take them while you’re on the Pill.’
No, he couldn't push it. Not yet. As much as he longed to snap and snarl and shout at these – these fucking
'All is in hand,' he said before Sherlock could utter a word. 'The British Government, sadly, cannot always be at your immediate disposal.'
'If this is her, then Harmattan are either unaware of her or are indifferent to her presence, at least at the time these photographs were taken. If she'd been recognised, the photographer would have snapped a clearer picture of her.'
Turning towards the dining table, something caught Sherlock's eye. A stack of mail, dumped hastily. Mostly junk, but in amongst it was a single padded envelope.  White. Non-descript. The kind of thing you could get anywhere.
It was such a quiet request, almost as if Sherlock were afraid of the answer, and John stumbled over his words in his haste to reply.
Greg's fingers curled into scare-quotes. The look he sent John's way still carried a hint of that old suspicion, like John was a puzzle that had landed in Greg's lap – one he could not make head nor tail of.
'The chopper has set down,' the commander whispered, tilting her head pointedly. Sherlock did the same, nodding his agreement. The engine's pitch and ferocity were falling, and he could picture the rotor-blades wilting as they succumbed to the pull of gravity.
'But you tried anyway.' He swallowed, ignoring the way his heart raced at her confident assessment. He had known that his leap from the roof of Bart's would cause John pain; their friendship was unlike any Sherlock had experienced – the bond undeniable. Yet it was one thing to know it in the abstract, and another to hear someone speak as a witness to John's distress.
‘And Mycroft knows as much,’ Sherlock promised. ‘He didn’t need me. He just wanted to watch me dance. Patronising at best.’ He quirked an eyebrow at John. ‘Your challenge gave me the perfect excuse to escape. It was –’ That generous mouth pursed, as it so often did when they entered the arena of sentiment. ‘Good. It was good. Deliberate, too, if I’m not mistaken.’
‘It’s like Cairo.’ Sherlock wet his lips before shaking his head, just once. If anyone else noticed the tremor in his voice, they were not so cruel as to mention it. ‘Except not. A passing similarity, completely unconnected. It was the brother, Lestrade. If you’ll excuse me...’
‘I know many things you don’t.’ Sherlock put just enough disdain into his voice to make Sally glare. ‘However, nothing pertaining to Ms Russell, at least not yet. It’s just another angle to cover. I suspect evidence might be a little thin on the ground.’
'Good divorce lawyers, I suspect. Anyway, point is, you can have new and shiny and boring, or you can have something a bit more like Baker Street. Bath, fireplace, good-sized rooms...'
He had adjusted his way of thinking accordingly, and then over-extrapolated: an understandable reaction given the current situation. At least John was looking at him without censure. In fact, a touch of fondness glinted in his sad eyes, a look that Sherlock had never thought to see again.
Evenings like this were rare, these days. Normally, he and Sherlock had some kind of case going on. John blamed the weather. It was too cold to bother with any kind of crime. Everyone was clenching their teeth and keeping their heads down, waiting for the cold to pass. Even Sherlock seemed content to remain indoors.
John tucked his hands in his pockets, the keys to the flat nestling in the curve of his fingertips like a promise.
That, Sherlock assumed, was why no one had examined the ballistics. It was unnecessary to tie the gun to the scene, since Norbury had been clutching it, still smoking, in her slender hand. Now, he stared at the bloody bullet they had found on the floor: A through-and-through shot that had lost momentum before it had the chance to hit the opposite wall. It matched the weapon, but doubt's weight clouded his brow as he considered the logistics.
Sherlock's breath whispered over his thigh, fast and panting. They knew each other well, and John bit back a grin as he realised Sherlock's restraint was unravelling as quick as John's own. Dark eyed and tousled, he looked wanton – debauched – utterly delicious as he shifted the fingers inside John and watched him come alive with desire.
John smiled, flicking off the lights and turning towards the bedroom. A seam of gold spilled out from under the door. He pushed it open and leaned against the threshold, the better to enjoy the sight that awaited him.
Weaver looked pained, her short dark hair frizzing thanks to the drizzle that fell outside. ‘Nothing’s missing. It’s not insurance fraud, because otherwise the owner would be claiming stuff’s missing.’
The scuff of a kitchen chair made him turn, scowling at Sherlock, who had hobbled over to the table to take a seat, surprisingly stealthy for a man on crutches. Sherlock raised an eyebrow in challenge, propping the foot of his injured leg up on the opposite chair before folding his arms across his chest.
'Bollocks!' John lowered the gun, freeing one hand to jab a finger in Mary's direction. 'If you gave a shit, you would have warned us about what was going on. You would have worked with us. Instead, you faked your death and fucked off.'
'So, it was never about me and Rosie at all,' John rasped, shifting the Sig in his grasp. 'Not really.'
They prescribed rest and painkillers before signing off the paperwork and guiding him to an airy atrium, encouraging him to buy a meal. He could not remember when he last ate, but in truth, he wasn't hungry. His stomach felt like rock, hard and dead. In the end, he forced himself to choke back some soup and bread, more to fill the time and ease the worry as he waited for Sherlock.
Now he stood, bathed in the morning's insipid light with shadows pressed under his eyes and his hair in disarray. Stubble shadowed his jaw, and he tilted his head from side to side, as if attempting to relieve the tension in his neck as he spoke to his brother.
John had yet to rescind his offer of sharing Sherlock's bed, and Sherlock made sure the curtains were drawn before easing himself down to the mattress, taking care not to disturb him. Not that he needed to cling to his concerns. He suspected the number 66 bus could crash through the wall and John would not so much as stir. He was completely oblivious, and Sherlock turned on his side, surveying that face as he allowed his thoughts to wander.
John pulled a face. His cooking was basic squaddy stuff. Sausages and mash. Baked beans on toast. He could cobble together a stew if he had to, and pasta offered no challenge, but it wasn't as if he were plating up gourmet food every night. Not that Sherlock complained. He assumed the mad bugger knew how to cook, but he'd never seen him do it. The fact he was making an effort in the name of John regaining his strength was... Well, it was brilliant, actually.
Something cupped his shoulder. He flinched away, his teeth bared in a snarl before he realised who it was. Not a stranger, as he had half-feared, but Mycroft and several of his men, clad in helmets and bulletproof gear. He shook his head, wondering if he was hallucinating. Mycroft continued to talk, his thin lips moving around words John could only just make out.
Sherlock blinked, a faint frown marring his brow as he dragged himself back to reality. ‘The switch Banksy made to stencilling around the turn of the millennium allowed for wider dissemination of the Banksy movement, and made it possible for others to emulate the style freely. Most of them are the work of copy-cats.’ He gestured to the tv screen. ‘Like that one.’
'You're in Baker Street,' he murmured, resisting the desire to instil any kind of urgency in his voice. It would only make the situation worse. Rousing John was not his aim. He would awaken him if he must, but it would be better for them both if he could ease the twist of his subconscious into safer territory. 'In London. There is nothing here that will hurt you.' His treacherous mind pointed out that the virus racing through John's blood was bringing plenty of harm in its wake, but he shoved the thought to one side. 'You're here, John, with me, and you're perfectly safe.'
The windows were a different matter, and John decided that he would be better off trying to dissuade intruders from getting through them by stacking breakables on the wooden sills. He used plates and cups, rather than anything irreplaceable, uttering a brief apology to Mrs Hudson for the abuse of her crockery. Anyone hoping to break through the glass and clamber in would struggle to do so without sending the pottery crashing to the floor: something he and Sherlock were bound to hear.
Norbury's mask was slipping, even he could see that. The sharp lines of confident indifference drained from her features, but what lay beneath was not the fear he expected. Instead, she seemed determined.
‘Don’t remind me.’ He sighed, fighting off a smile as he nudged Sherlock with his elbow, revelling in the quiet, deep laugh that answered him.
'Stop it,' John hissed, his fingers shifting around the butt of his gun as he took a single step forward. He did not shake his head – he would not wish to take his eyes off Mary, not even for a moment – but Sherlock could make out the subtle tremor of emotional strain racing through his body. He did not dare guess what John was grappling with, yet he could imagine how much worse it would have been if Mary's survival had been a surprise. 'I'm not playing your game. Not anymore.'
'We're not going to give it to her, are we?' John's quiet question seemed to shimmer in the air, carrying hints of sentiment that Sherlock dare not name. 'The file, I mean. Not even to try and lure her out on our terms?'
Now it was too late. All the things they'd never talked about, the stuff he hadn't had a chance to confess – it would all remain unsaid, and he'd have to live with that until his dying day. Maybe, in the end, neither of them had been the person they'd pretended to be.
'Wait.' John laughed, tipping his head back and groaning as Sherlock sucked a mark on his collarbone. 'Wait, let me...' He shoved Sherlock down to the bed none-too-gently and divested himself of both jeans and underwear before stretching out at Sherlock's side, gloriously naked at last.
The last he had seen; John had slipped into the designated warehouse. He had no idea what had happened next. All he knew was that they weren't together.
He was not wrong in that respect. Even now, he listed in the bowl of his armchair, supported by its shape and nothing more. Yet even as he went to get to his feet, Sherlock knew the journey to the bedroom would not be one he could make alone. John's weakness, as painful as it was to witness, chafed against his friend's nature, cutting him to the quick. The fact John had not even the strength to rail against it spoke volumes for the state of his health.
Like a wound splitting open, the despair welled anew, and John bowed his head before the black gravestone. Tears bit at his eyes and tangled in his throat, threatening to choke him. The shadows lengthened, leaning in to wrap him in their black wings, but they could bring him no comfort. Sherlock was beyond reach, and he was never coming back.
'Can we see where it points? Use Google Earth or whatever?' he rasped, clearing his throat and shifting where he sat, wondering if it had been a mistake to barge into Sherlock's room. He hadn't even thought twice about it. Now his surroundings seemed surprisingly intimate, not helped by Sherlock's sleep rumpled body within arm's reach.
'Have you had any luck?' John glanced at him from the corner of his eye, his face tense as he sipped from his mug of tea. 'Found anything else?'
They'd argued over that more than once. John said there were plenty of other places for Sherlock to rest in the flat, ones more comfortable and conducive to slumber, but Sherlock remained unrelenting. He would not sleep on the sofa, or worse, up in John's room. Should he give in to either prospect, he would lie awake, worrying and wondering, only to succumb to the urge to return to John's side within the hour.
'Mycroft said it was quick and thorough, which implies they did not search the place once they knew it was empty. I shall have my homeless network confirm it, but I think we can assume you were correct. The intruders the other night were not searching for something that Mary had left behind: they were looking for you.'
‘All right. Fine. So, we reckon it’s maple syrup cut with something else, but why? Why bother?’ Lestrade demanded. ‘What could they be hoping to achieve?’
‘Maple syrup.’ Sherlock jerked his head to the pallet that had been knocked over. Bottles had smashed, releasing the sweet-scented, sticky stuff all over the warehouse floor. ‘Ostensibly, anyway. Although I have my doubts.’
His t-shirt stuck to his skin, and every moment he prayed he was not wrong – that the helicopter was as empty as it appeared. His nerves hummed with the bite of imagined bullets, and it was only when he felt the wall of the fuselage at his back that he allowed himself to breathe a sigh of relief. No painful retribution had answered their daring, and no one waited to challenge them as John helped him up into the Hind.
'Damn right. Don't even think about scurrying off on your own to try and make this better, Sherlock. If anything, it's more my problem than yours.'
With quick steps, Sherlock strode back through to the kitchen where the files and photographs awaited him. He had printed out images of the pictures he had taken in the hideout, enlarging key details to give him as much information as possible. Translating the Greek documents was a slower endeavour, and one he now gave his full attention. This, at least, was something he could do; a way to be helpful when it felt as if life were rapidly spinning beyond his control.
Yet the courage to speak of it always failed him. How many times had he parted his lips to utter... what? What could he say that would make John understand the strength and breadth of his emotion?
'No.' He threw up his hands, taking an instinctive step back and colliding with the wall as he tried to halt Sherlock's approach. 'I've got a fever. You need to keep away.'
'How long have you been there?' Sherlock asked, his breath locked tight in the cage of his ribs. Mycroft had not been subtle in his statements, and while he had not spoken a word of a lie with regards Sherlock's feeling, neither one of them knew the truth of John's sentiments.
Sherlock reached the kitchen, pulling the laptop towards him and setting to work. 'Also, she can offer us the final confirmation of Mary's actions and remove any lingering doubt.'
'I am afraid there is no easy way to say this. There was a fire at your residence last night: undoubtedly arson. Some of Sherlock's network witnessed the perpetrators but could do nothing to intervene. The blaze caught quickly. There's very little left.'
John looked around, spying the hooks in the corner and moving to retrieve their coats just as she spoke with dismissive finality.
‘I’m going to Molly. If there’s anything odd going on in any of the morgues, she’ll know. If Donovan gets anything useful out of Miss Harris, let me know. I’m not sure if this is a prank or a threat, but she should not sleep here tonight.’
His thoughts shattered into knife-sharp slices, cutting his composure to ribbons as his next breath left him in a stuttering stream. His throat throbbed, locked tight around sobs that clawed at his chest, desperate for release. Tears bit his eyes at his lip wobbled, only to be restrained by the vicious clamp of his teeth. He wouldn’t cry. He wouldn’t because that meant it was real. That meant – that meant –
He had just sorted out her bottle and settled her down in the high chair to drink it when he heard the click of the lock on the front door. Shuffling footsteps scuffed over the hall floor, and John frowned. He'd never known Mycroft's stride to be anything but firm and confident. Uncertainty raced down his spine, and he wet his lips, glancing at Rosie before he turned and peered around the half-open kitchen door.
He would not let it go, Sherlock realised. John could be doggedly persistent at the most inconvenient times. Even if he managed to somehow redirect the conversation – even if life conspired to somehow distract them both – John would come back to it later.
'Thanks, Daphne. I'll call them in.' He pressed the button that would signal for the patient to head for his office, shuffling Sherlock's letter out of sight before turning to his computer. Normally, the relevant file would be queued for him, but the only response to his hopeful key presses was a blank screen. The system hadn't frozen. He could still go back and forward throughout his appointments. It was merely this patient's information that remained stubbornly empty.
A sense of movement behind him – Sherlock shaking his head maybe – caught his attention, and when he spoke, Sherlock's voice was deep and rasping. 'There is no need to apologise. I am the one who's sorry. I should not have left you then, and I will not leave you now.'
'Maybe she had her reasons.' Sherlock placed a tentative hand on John's knee, his breath catching in his throat at the contact, platonic as it was.
Silence fell in the car, interrupted only by the hum of the tyres over the road. John stared out of the window, not seeing anything of the skimming scenery. Even when they joined the motorway, he barely blinked, too lost in his thoughts to care for his surroundings.
Frustration and anxiety were Sherlock's constant companions, and by the fifth day, those two emotions had replaced the bastions of his bones. He felt like a man made of nothing but sentiment, rubbed raw by the relentless waves of concern and the veils of helplessness that cocooned his every moment.
'You're right. About almost everything. I should have known you would figure it out.' She reached up, sweeping the dark beanie off her head and running a hand through her hair. 'When I first realised Harmattan weren't going to let me go easily, I knew I needed a way out. The plan was to never come back. I intended to get their attention away from you with a few key bits of activity in China that would grab their interest.' She leaned to the right, looking past Sherlock to where John still stood, pale and gaunt. 'It's just... before I could faked my death, I received an offer.'
Sherlock sighed, irritable to the point of wretchedness. How had it come to this? How had he reached a point where even the solace of his violin lay beyond his reach?
Tears had been shed: the red rims of John's eyes made their accusations, and his skin seemed to sag from the bones of his face, slack with misery. It had been a long time since Sherlock had seen John look so defeated. The last had been at Sherlock’s own graveside, the cane clenched tight in his hand and his body tense with rejection of his new reality.
Quickly, he wiped her down, smiling as her cries turned to whimpers, which soon became reluctant giggles. She chewed on her fist and waved her other hand about before trying to roll over on the changing mat, clearly bored by his ministrations.
Hard not to. God knew what strings he’d pulled to get Anderson his job back. Greg didn’t know, and nor did Anderson. It had just happened. Sherlock snapped his fingers, and it seemed the world shuffled around to make his wishes into reality.
'This isn't about me.' Sherlock stilled where he sat, holding himself strong and resolute against the sudden sharpness of John's glare. 'What I would do is immaterial, but whatever you decide, our first course of action is clear: we must discover what it is that they seek. Armed with that information, we might have an idea how to proceed.'
Gone were the peaceful depths of John's slumber. The quilt, which had once cocooned him tenderly, now wrapped in manacles of cloth around his legs. Sweat glistened on that wrinkled brow, and a fearful snarl twisted that thin mouth without mercy. One hand flailed, a thrashing, aimless fist, and Sherlock stepped forward, catching John's wrist before he could hurt himself.
At last, Baker Street came into view: its roof distinctive amidst its more contemporary neighbours. The fire escape gleamed its welcome, chiming underfoot as he jumped on it and ducked through the bedroom window.
'Hah, he's probably not noticed I'm gone. He was elbow deep in... something... when I left. Still, yeah, I'm too old to miss out on a good eight hours of sleep, these days.'
John shook his head: an aborted denial as his mind curled in on itself, twisting along blank avenues where recollection had once stood. The room over Sherlock's shoulder looked hazy, as if seen through a cascade of veils. Even the bed beneath him felt less than solid: an irrelevant detail.
‘If I'm right, then the first segment decodes to “Paris bribes. Marcus Harper. Foreign Intelligence. Three Seven Two.’ Sherlock tilted the page he had scribbled on, showing the hectic scrawl of his deciphering efforts.
'96 percent and 102 beats per minute,' he read out, scribbling in his notepad. 'No dramatic change since this morning.'
Rosie sighed as John hid a smirk. It wasn’t that she didn’t believe Sherlock, it was just that she was used to his tricks by now. Only the twist of her lips suggested she might be grudgingly impressed.
Perhaps, he mused, it would be his last gift to John: the information he needed to finally choose his freedom from the burden of their friendship.
'Now who's being bossy?' Sherlock purred, his hot breath ghosting over John's cock in exquisite torment.
'I will recover what I can,' Mycroft promised, 'but the people who set the fire were thorough. No room remained unscathed.'
With quick, efficient movements, he opened Mrs Hudson's kitchen cupboard, pulling out the box where she kept the spare lightbulbs.  There were not as many as he would have liked, but enough to sprinkle their broken glass at the thresholds of all the downstairs doors, including the grim entryway to 221C. Anyone stepping on it would give themselves away as the fragments shattered underfoot, and the splinters would be almost invisible in the dark.
His fingers drummed a restless rhythm on his knee, and he cleared his throat, watching the passing traffic and hurrying pedestrians as they made their way towards the docklands. The congestion set his teeth on edge as the minutes ticked past. Mary hadn't given him long to get there: a deliberate move on her part. It gave him and Sherlock less time to put together any kind of plan. Now, he kept glaring at the clock on the driver's dash as adrenaline bubbled in his belly.
Cold and insipid, Norbury watched the world through hooded eyes. Her hair hung loose, unstyled, and her face sagged with age and exhaustion. John expected to hate the sight of her, yet it was pity that twisted through his chest. She looked like someone's grandmother; hardly villain material. It was difficult to believe that this was the woman who had pulled the trigger and caused Mary's death. She didn't look capable, at least until she smiled: a cynical curve of thin lips that made John narrow his eyes in distrust.
Mary, on the other hand, thrived on it: the secrets and puzzles, twisting things up to look like nonsense only for a seed of sense to be secluded at their core. Worse, she was well-trained and experienced. If anyone could break her code apart, it would be Sherlock, but John did not envy him the task.
'They had a culprit and an eye-witness. There was no need to examine the evidence in any great detail. I suspect no autopsy ever took place. The documents are likely to be forged to align with the story Mary wished to convey.'
'Allow me to tie up the loose ends,' Mycroft urged. 'It will be a few days yet before I can be certain that the splinter group has been neutralised. As such, I suggest that Rosie remains in my care for a short while. That will also give you the opportunity to find your feet again, Doctor Watson.' His gaze flickered to Sherlock, and something unspoken sparked between them. 'You might want to take a moment to consider your future.'
He could hear the smile in her voice as she bade him farewell, disconnecting the call and leaving him free to dial the second number that had sprung to mind with these revelations. There were two key facets to any murder: the body and the scene. Molly could gain access to the reports on the former, but to discover anything more about that night at the aquarium, he would need to talk to Lestrade.
He did not only mean the call with Norbury. He meant this whole bloody mess, from the Greek team watching him to Mary's unexplained presence, codes on memorials and international secrets.
Behind him, John's silence continued, thick and bottomless. He did not shift his weight, and each breath sounded too sharp and short, painful to the ear. There was nothing Sherlock could do to help. Poring over the information they already had would only lead them around in endless circles, trapping them in dire supposition. He needed more data, and his only choice of action was to wait for it to arrive.
Settling his hand on John's shoulder, he ducked his head to catch John's gaze. Blue eyes, murky with emotion, shifted to the side, but a quick squeeze seemed to give John the strength he needed to turn back.
Sherlock's blissful cry curled in his ear as he tightened, his body rigid as he came in shuddering, panting spurts. His mind blanked to white and his body was lost to the surging electricity the flooded every nerve and left them singing. He could feel Sherlock twitching, coming even as John painted his own skin with his release, clumsily teasing himself through the ebbing shivers of his climax.
Sherlock glanced towards the windows of the flat, his eyes flickering back and forth as if he were searching the street beyond for threats. 'Mary plans to hand the file off to a Harmattan splinter group: in doing so she buys protection from the organisation as a whole and receives a sizeable financial settlement. However, should she fail, then she is not the only one in danger.'
'Oh, you want to look at those, do you?' John asked, knowing full well that Rosie couldn't care less about them, but if she would be quiet while he studied them then he would take the opportunity. 'Let's see what we've got, shall we?'
'Call him "lover boy" to his face, I dare you,' John chuckled, clearing up their rubbish and putting it in the bin by the door before following Greg out.
The whisper of their panting breaths filled the air: a susurrus of benediction. John slumped back to the pillow, too spent to even wipe his hand on the bedsheets. He felt as if he had been turned inside out, broken down and built up anew into something better.
For all they that were safe here, it was a tenuous position. He wanted to flee, to grab Rosie and race to the ends of the earth if it meant avoiding this haunted, hunted reality, but the truth was unavoidable.
Not that he minded that strange, old presence. It was still his city. London, Sherlock knew, was more than the buildings that grew from its surface in a forest of concrete, brick and glass. How many times had the city fallen? The blitz and the fire. The floods and the plague. Still it lived on, growing ever bigger on the foundation of its ancient bones.
The day before yesterday, his phone had started acting up. Echoes on the line and mis-coded characters in texts. He couldn't be sure that messages weren't being intercepted. Emails were eminently hackable, and visiting Sherlock in person? No. John had no idea what was going on, but walking into Baker Street would only make it worse, of that he was certain.
'Wouldn't they? "Go to hell, Sherlock." That's what I told you. Maybe in your arrogance you thought it was a hell I hoped you could survive. It wasn't. I wanted you gone once and for all.'
'Did you learn anything new from your network?' he asked. 'Anything we've missed while we've been away?'
Tugging it free, Sherlock blinked, reaching inside for the DVD and staring at the two words scrawled in marker on the metal.
All of them, in all their roles, orbited Sherlock. He was their centre, whether they liked it or not. His personal power may be limited, but without him, there was no game – no point…
The USB stick had offered a wealth of information, but it was a device encrypted in layers. Some of it was easily accessible – things that Mary had wanted them to find. Others were more challenging, shielded away but still easy enough to pick apart.
‘And wrist,’ Sherlock added, shrugging his left shoulder. It would aggravate him no end in a day or two, of that he was certain. For now, though, he had good painkillers and John’s presence: his golden skin and ruby blood. His sapphire eyes and ivory bones. A veritable treasure trove bundled up in the form of his friend.
No matter how often he tidied away her toys, there always seemed to be more, as if they multiplied by themselves. Now, he gathered her into his lap, checking she was warm enough before exploring new objects with her, talking through shapes and colours, smiling as she laughed at him in response. Eventually, however, her delight turned to indifference, and she wriggled from John's grasp, smacking chubby palms against the photographs where John had left them.
John shook his head, trying to cast aside his thoughts of Sherlock and fencing, drugs and a quiet mind. Sometimes, often when he had just begun to believe that Sherlock had no secrets left to share, he'd end up blind-sided by something extraordinary. Something Sherlock, no doubt, considered irrelevant, but that only gave John another, intriguing insight into his friend's life before he'd ever been a part of it. 'Already?' he managed, accepting his phone back as Sherlock sprang to his feet and dashed out of the door, clattering down the stairs and leaving John to follow. 'That was fast.'
Sherlock took in each scene with care. There were not many of probably-Mary after her death: only two, both taken on the same day. The pictures focused on John and Rosie. Mary, on the other hand, was out of range of the camera's piercing gaze.
'John, I – I'm going to –' Sherlock's shaking body said what his lips could not. John moaned in encouragement, picking up the pace of his hand over his cock, conducting the exquisite symphony of his need with firm fingers until, at last, he tipped over the edge.
'I am not the only one who is supposed to be resting,' Sherlock pointed out, casting a meaningful look at the bruise on John's temple.
Water dripped down his neck, collecting under his collar and turning his hair to spikes. His jeans were soaked, the heavy denim dragging at his hips as his socks squelched in his boots. He looked pitiful. John knew that well enough, but he could not bring himself to seek shelter.
Dropping his hands, he smoothed his palms over the hub of his own kneecaps, letting the soft rasp of the expensive fabric soothe him. The light on the DVD player winked out a steady, stand-by beat, mocking him. He scowled at the harmless device, considering its contents.
John nodded, relief bubbling through him. He had not even considered those practicalities, and the thought of burying Mary again... No. No, he wouldn't have done it anyway. That day he had sent the fiction of the woman he loved on her final journey, and that's how it would stay. Maybe Mary Watson had never really existed – a figment she had concocted for her own purposes – but either way, his wife had died a while ago. There was nothing more to be gained from death rites and grave-sides.
Blue lights flashed around the room, lending everything a strange hue. Donovan stood back, observing the scene. She wished she could say that murder shocked her, but she was well past that. Years in the force had inured her to all of it.
John wrinkled his nose in thought, his absent-minded body language almost as endearing as the competent way his gaze swept the body. A moment later, he crouched at her side, checking her airway before peeling back her lip and looking at her gums.
Sherlock tugged at the cuffs of his jacket before walking over to the laptop where it sat on the breakfast bar. John stood behind his shoulder, too tense to take a seat at his side. He shifted his weight as Sherlock went through the tiresome necessities of establishing a connection and entering the authorisations that Mycroft had provided in a hurried email.
'Why don't you invite her upstairs for a cup of tea?' Sherlock suggested, already locating the items John had listed online. 'But before you do, pass me your credit card. It had better be in your name in case the insurance company demands receipts.'
John glanced over his shoulder, peering through the thin seam of the doorway to Sherlock's bedroom. The occasional flap of fabric and shadow moving on the wall suggested he was doing just as he said. In fact, now he thought about, where he'd expected dismissal from Sherlock, the attentiveness came as a pleasant surprise. 'Mrs Hudson's downstairs if it comes to the worst, but I think I'll be okay.'
‘Actually, no. Like most parakeets and parrots, they mainly eat fruit and seeds, but also consume insects and grubs. Offer this an eyeball and it would probably eat it. No, look at that beak.’
Perhaps he was not being fair to Sherlock. After all, he'd gone above and beyond, these past however-many days. Still, asking for more felt too much to John like pushing his luck. So he lay there in bed, staring at the ceiling and feeling sorry for himself.
The glasses chimed as he set them down on the low table before collapsing into the armchair to John's right, still smiling fit to burst. 'I'm glad to hear you two sorted things out. Took you long enough.'
The temptation to ask questions burned across Sherlock's tongue, sharp and biting, but he urged it back. That was what Mary wanted. She was watching them even as they observed her, trying to assess how much they suspected and what they knew for certain. To fill in the silence would offer her the foundations on which to twist this scenario to her advantage, and Sherlock was weary of giving her that opportunity. John deserved better. He deserved the truth, and it was about time Mary gave it to them.
Basic biology was, well, basic. Schools didn't cover more than the obvious ears-tails-teeth bit, and Felisians weren't exactly common. John had seen a few, but Greg? There was a fair chance that Sherlock was the only one he'd ever met outside of a murder investigation.
'Besides, even if it wasn't Ajay, as Mary believes, she wouldn't be here if she still had access to those other files. They have been neutralised. Now, the only way for her to get what she wants is to confront Mycroft – which would be foolish at best – or come after us. She just doesn't know that, yet.'
'But which one's which?' John shrugged, turning around to read some of the information that Mycroft’s people had provided. 'It says here that the memorial is aligned to the cardinal directions: north, south, east and west.'
'We don't need to. Imagine yourself in the splinter group's position. You hear the engine of your sole mode of transport preparing to depart. What would you do?' He turned to face John, their noses almost brushing as he raised an eyebrow.
It would not surprise him if John did not bother with his bed up in his old room. Instead, he suspected that John waited for Sherlock to drift off before returning to his armchair and the sluggish turn of his thoughts. He ate like a man going through the motions, taking no pleasure from whatever food either Sherlock or Mrs Hudson placed in front of him. Even his tea was consumed with mechanical regularity, as if John's life had been whittled down to nothing but a collection of habits.
'Here, use mine.' He offered it up with a flick of his fingers. 'Call Lestrade and Molly; let them know you're safe, but not where you are.' He waited until John accepted the device from his grasp before standing back, giving him the privacy to contact those that cared for him and reassure them of his well-being.
'My team picked up a white transit van leaving the area near where Sherlock was found: a similar vehicle was also spotted in close proximity to Miss Hooper's home early this morning. Two individuals were in it, though both took great care not to show their faces.'
First things first, he needed to take care of himself. He'd keep an eye on Sherlock and worry about him later. He couldn't assuage any of Sherlock's concern if he relapsed. It felt wrong to make himself a priority, but it was the only logical choice. He had to regain normality as soon as possible.
Depression was a strange beast. It affected people in so many ways. Most people thought of those who suffered as unable to get out of bed or perform basic tasks: so lost in their apathy that they couldn’t function. Except it wasn’t always like that. Sometimes it came out as aggression or frustration so sharp it cut like a knife. Often, it could bleed out in acts of violence or self-harming behaviours.
‘Irish, actually.’ Sherlock sipped his coffee, trying not to shudder in the chill. The wind howled, fierce and furious. Even his Belstaff struggled against it. No wonder John and Lestrade looked so miserable. Their cheap clothes must be next to useless. They were ambling back from the pub after a beer. Sherlock had accompanied them since he had nothing better to do. Besides, both of them had seemed in a foul mood at the crime scene earlier. He felt it best to keep an eye on them just in case. ‘Though they carved turnips. They took the tradition to America.’
'A risky move, however you look at it.' Sherlock leaned forward, propping his elbows on his raised knees. 'It makes no sense for Mary to orchestrate all of this only to remain in the city. What she did was a form of escape, so why didn't she run?'
He forgot about everything: the fact that a killer lay a few feet away, unconscious but unrestrained; Lestrade's imminent arrival... There was only Sherlock and the pleasure of those lips beneath his own as he claimed the kiss he had craved for so long.
'I'm sorry,' he whispered, his own hand trembling as he stroked John's back. 'I'm sorry that it ever came to this.'
Sherlock's greeting flowed over his tattered nerves: a soothing tide of familiarity. He did not dare try and peer through the crack in the door to see if his would-be attackers were approaching. He barely had the courage to lift his voice above a breathy whisper as he hissed, 'Someone's in the house.'
'Still nothing from Mycroft?' John checked over the grass with a wary eye before setting Rosie down. He sat near her with much grunting and knee-clicking, keeping watch in case she started to shove soil and leaves in her mouth. It wouldn't hurt her if she did, Sherlock mused, but he recalled from his own childhood that parents tended to get upset about that kind of thing.
'No, they're both fine. No rashes, either, before you ask.' John surveyed Sherlock over the rim of his cup. He should have known that Sherlock's compassion, when it made an appearance, would look something like this: practical, analytical, and devoid of all physical sentiment. He offered John no sympathy, treating his illness as a problem to document and solve above all else.
On Sherlock’s jacket, Rosie chattered happily to herself, and John allowed his eyes to drift shut, lulled by the piece of this moment. Parenting was hard, everyone said so. Still, at least he wasn’t alone.
Blind security cameras hung on their brackets, useless, and the external lights let out a sallow glow, flickering like a failing heartbeat. The place had power, at least, which implied that someone, somewhere, was paying its bills. However, its current occupiers sought to stay beneath the radar, rather than fortifying their derelict bastion. Either they were confident that they could neutralise any intruders, or stalwart in their belief of their own invisibility.
The woman lay where she had fallen, her eyes vacant. There were no signs of injury, nor anything to hint at a struggle. In fact, the room was so barren of evidence that it looked staged.
John's throat pulsed, another sob trying to claw its way out, born not from misery, but the brightest, most desperate kind of relief. Perhaps, from someone else, the words would not mean much: an empty platitude. From Sherlock they sounded as solemn as any wedding vow and were given in utmost seriousness. Had he not proved, time and again over the past week or so, that John was his highest priority?
'No, you just drove a woman with nothing to lose to her breaking point. Just like you do with everyone else, too wrapped up in your own brilliance to see the harm you cause!' John heaved in a breath, the chair scraping over the floor as he surged upright, all trace of his earlier stiffness and pain gone, eradicated by his anger. 'Your actions have consequences, Sherlock! They always have, and now my wife is dead!'
John twitched, turning to stare at Sherlock in surprise and wincing as his pulse thudded hard against his ribs. He'd not noticed his approach, nor the way the quality of the light shifted around him as time crept ever onwards. The news report he had been watching had turned into a half-hearted film review by some obsequious idiot, and John hit the mute button to block out his nasal tones.
'My brother is far from helpless.' Mycroft glanced at his watch before turning his head to survey the skimming motorway through the windscreen. 'If he is able to do so, he will already be formulating ways in which to turn the situation to his advantage.'
At first, John had driven himself half-spare with the same concerns, anxious and angry in equal measure that Sherlock, for all his genius, might not have figured out the code. Now, at least, he had the reassurance he had hoped for. There, hidden within neat handwriting – where odd spaces could be excused as mere quirks – the punctuation spelled out its own story in Morse.
Now, he surveyed the pleasant, messy room with new eyes, taking in all the markers of John's habits in a sweep of his gaze. The high-stress of his job was evident. Clothes, worn but not yet dirty lay over the chair like victims of a shipwreck, arms and legs askew. John threw them non-to-gently when he discarded them: a simple release valve for the pressure of his temper.
'I know, but we won't get any answers until we are on the scene, and we cannot risk Molly's safety by staying away.'
John pressed the green button on the listening device, holding it to his ear and hearing Mary's voice, crystal clear. 'That's a shame,' she replied, apparently unconcerned. 'I hope he is not badly hurt.'
How he could look so unflustered boggled the mind. John felt like his heart was about to burst out from his ribs, bloody with alarm, but Sherlock merely sneered. He had struck a nerve with his jibe at the fencer's skill, that much was clear. Now, he intended to push that advantage.
He plotted his path to avoid them while making the most of the shelter the scattered buildings could offer. He spared each one he passed a brief inspection, ruling them out as potential locations for Sherlock. Mary would be keeping him near her, of that he was sure. She wouldn't trust him not to escape if left to his own devices, and that meant he would be at the centre of Mary's web. These huts were too dilapidated and empty: broken furniture visible through the windows and insecure doorways. They were decoys – little but mere scenery.
He didn’t cry when he finally got home, feeling like a ghost of himself, worn thin and painted in shades of white and grey. Baker Street settled around him, just as they had left it. Dirty plates and coffee cups, experiments that would never get finished now…
'But drafts. Might be a bit damp in the winter, and you'll probably need a flatmate to cover the cost of rent. I definitely couldn't afford it on my own when I first got here. I dunno how much the Yard pay you –'
‘In here.’ The Dean gestured to the doorway, her footsteps halted in respect to the police tape that had been pinned across its threshold. Donovan stood guard. She lifted an eyebrow as they approached. No sneer graced her lips, which made a change, but she did wrinkle her nose. ‘Might want to leave your coat out here, Holmes. You’ll need to kit up for this one. It’s a bit of a mess.’
John swore, flailing around before reaching into his pocket, scowling down at the unrecognised number on the caller display. He shared a quick look with Sherlock, his expression falling into hard, flat lines as he connected the call. He did not utter a greeting, but listened to the voice on the other end, his eyes growing shuttered. Only one person could make John look like that, and Sherlock's stomach curled in anticipation.
It was no gentle rousing, and nor should it be. The body jerked and the chest heaved: the instinct to survive taking over.
'I think you rather surprised her with your demand that she leave. She had not anticipated the ferocity of your reaction nor the strength of your insistence. It genuinely alarmed her.' Sherlock's lips twitched in a smile. 'I suspected she had already swept the flat for bugs when she was here. She answered too freely for someone who feared being overheard by a third party.' Sherlock sat down opposite him and tucked in to the egg-fried rice, wielding his chopsticks with ease.
'Come on, then.' Sherlock stepped forward, stooping to loop John's arm around his shoulder before cradling the line of his waist – more slender than it had been a week ago – in his lopsided embrace. He didn't give John a chance to argue, nor did he allow himself a moment to question whether this was too much, too intimate. Helping one another in the first flush of injury came all too easily, and though illness occupied a different arena, the same requirements lay at the core of the situation.
And then all that turned out to be a lie: a fiction and a fantasy Mary had constructed in the hopes of escaping her past. She'd built a future with John, but had never told him who she was. What she was. If it hadn't been for Sherlock, there was a good chance he'd never have known. Mary wouldn't have volunteered the information, never in a million years. John knew her well enough to believe that.
‘It’s amazing what you hear if you take the time to listen. What you see if you really look.’ Sherlock shrugged, a faint blush colouring his cheeks at John’s obvious look of impressed approval. ‘The network helps. Banksy’s part of the word on the street. It all makes its way back to me eventually.’
