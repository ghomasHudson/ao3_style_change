“Can you hear me?” John folded his right hand over the other in the middle of the table, paying no attention to Sherlock’s mess. Sherlock only nodded in response.
“Delivery for John Holmes?”
Sherlock rolled John's arm over to see the soft inside of his forearm. The tattoos blended together cleanly and ended in sharp edges. "Is there a theme to it?"

“Definitely. Coming back soon I hope?”
The first of many tears rolled down Jane’s cheek. “It was never difficult.” Mrs. Evans gave a short nod in response, and Jane pulled her closer, wrapping her in a tight embrace, one hand firmly rested between the woman’s shoulders and the other running through smoke-scented hair. “Whatever you need… Anything at all…” Jane kissed the mother’s cheek, squeezed her hand once more, and released her. “Just ask.” Mrs. Evans wet eyes shared their thanks, and John guided Jane to the dark wooded pews, the time of the service approaching.
Molly heard the door click shut and the sound of metal hitting wood.
“This way.”
“As I was saying, he told me he had assigned a team to keep an eye on you while you were abroad. I told him I didn’t care, which of course was a lie…”
“Perhaps he can join us for the next Underground.”
John had three seconds of the beautiful smile taking over Sherlock’s mouth before Irene stumbled into him.
“How long?”
“Once or twice, and only in passing. Unfortunately.”

Watson chuckled, more to himself than aloud. “It isn’t good for you to be up and out with your arms so fresh. Last thing we need is a newly agitated set of wounds.”
Jane swiped the bag and headed back to the storage closet. John made his way around the room, glancing over shoulders at the works of art on the tables. He paused next to a girl he remembered from his last visit. She turned up to him, hazel eyes bright and happy.
He hated the distance. John moved forward as he shrugged out of his flannel, balling it and tossing it behind him. He relished the teasing, satisfied smirk on Sherlock’s beautiful mouth. John grabbed the hem of his shirt and pulled it up and over in one fell swoop, dropping it next to his feet. He folded over to unlace his Chucks, face agonizingly close to the ever growing hardness pressing against the thin cotton of Sherlock’s pants. He kicked off his sneakers, unbuttoned his jeans and pressed his cheek against Sherlock’s barely-covered erection. His last step out of his jeans put him flush against Sherlock, and John ran his left hand along Sherlock’s clavicle, kissed the tendons that lined the hollow of Sherlock’s throat, caressed the craters of his collarbones with the damp softness of his tongue. Sherlock’s head fell back against the wood of the door, his warm exhales coating John’s neck as he savored Sherlock’s skin, skeleton, and scent. John slipped his hand round to the small of Sherlock’s back, pulling him closer, and the other hand went to the handle of the door, swinging it open. John crowded him into the small room and shut them inside.
“I don’t need assistance, just tell me how to get to the fucking toilets, John. Christ.”
Jane felt her lips parting, and then clamped her jaw shut. John had forewarned her about his ability to deduce. “Yes, actually.”
Sherlock pulled his head up and cocked it to the side, like a dog that had heard a funny noise. He looked confused. “Because you’re here…?”
“I’m sorry I didn’t know him better, John.”
They were wrapped up under the covers, bundled tightly together. John was giggling profusely at Sherlock attempting to impersonate Anderson. They had consumed three drinks too many. Their bodies were warm and fizzy on the inside.
I am enough.
“You too, huh?”
be a little more uncomfortable. And I didn’t much feel like getting punched in the bollocks before practice even begins.”
“Yes…” Sherlock trailed off.
B opened the door to find Jane bundled up in scarves, coats and a knitted cap. Her cheeks were pink and flushed and she was grinning. The tungsten glow of the outdoor light made her blonde hair orange.
First the top lip, then the bottom, and John couldn’t help but think how well they fit together, all the way down to the shape of their mouths. He felt a tingling sensation on his scalp as his hairs stood on end. The wind blew and the cold hit him hard, practically bare-footed and no longer enveloped in a Sherlock vacuum.
A few minutes passed as she leaned into his chest and he was pressed against the counter. He rubbed her shoulders and pushed her hair from her face. “Jane, may I ask you something?” He felt her pulse flitter at her neck. “Don’t fret, it’s nothing horrible.”
. I am not drunk enough for this.”

Callum appeared in the bedroom door, shirtless and only dressed in pants.
“Why would Molly go see the owner before the show?”
“Shit, John. Shit.”
John chuckled. “No, er, actually, Duke’s right. I’m John. John Watson. Pleased to meet you.”
“Hey,” he murmured, “just talk to me. I just want to talk. I don’t know where you stand or how you’re feeling, and I know the idea of being with someone so soon after everything else that has happened overwhelms you a bit. Nothing to be afraid of.”
“Glad you finally noticed.”
“Whomever else, yes, of course I would get bored. But you are not whomever else. Let’s get you in bed, John. I know you must be exhausted.”
“What do you want to know?”
“I didn’t stay the night.”
He loves that Sherlock speaks twice as fast when he’s excited, the way his eyebrows launch upwards on his face and his voice changes when he is trying to recreate a pompous big brother, the large, sweeping hand gestures as he finally reaches the climax of the story, and his chuckle at the recollection of it all. Sherlock was an artist. Not just in his many incredible gifts, no. But in his very existence. At the core of his being, Sherlock’s life was a work of art. His character, his demeanor, his love and play of language and his careful interactions with everything and everyone that surrounds him. He chooses every day to be a man in search of more from this life, never settling or succumbing to the expectations of those that believe their opinion to be of the utmost importance.
As if in unison with his thoughts, there was a gentle rap on the door. John groaned, huffed a loud, irritated sigh, and slowly pushed his way up and off the couch. His socked feet barely lifted from the floor as he made his way to the foyer. Sherlock smiled at him from the top step of the stairs. He pushed his way through the door and into John’s space, planting a firm kiss square on a pair of thin, smiling lips.

“You moved me to tears without saying a word.”
“Nice to meet all of you. Tonight was lovely.” John offered to Sherlocks’s mates.
, Rhys Rex. You’re repulsive.” It was an awkward stretch of three days between Callum and Rhys when Rhys finally knocked on their apartment door and apologized. A true first. Molly had never had an issue since.
He bit the skin below her navel, eliciting a sharp gasp from her mouth.
“What is so funny?” Sherlock spat.
“I do, but I want you to interpret it however you see fit. You can modify it, shift it around, whatever you’d like.”
a tiny trace or spark of a specified quality or feeling.
“It is beautiful. How long have you spent on it?”
Wind surrounded him on all sides, pulling him in all directions. His body was warm and wet, his mouth cracked and dry. Darkness was better. He looked for it, and eagerly rejoined his familiar friend.
“I danced with Rhys Rex earlier.”
shouldn't I be cold and still?
“Prior obligations?” He could hear the snarl making itself known in his voice.

is this?” John stood gaping at the luxury sports vehicle parked in the lower level of Sherlock’s flat, which, until just now, John had not even known existed. The car was gorgeous, silver in color, perhaps clear-coated aluminium, her back one, long smooth line flowing into a set of haunches, where wide metal wheels sat inside widely stretched tires. It was sexy; it was extravagant; it was absolutely excessive. John aimed his wide eyes at the man loading up his bags in the hatch.
“Hmmm?” The detective was sprawled out on the bed, drowsy and heavy-lidded.
“Good,” she said with a small smile. “I’m sorry that we didn’t really explain the situation. You sort of went in blind.”
John stood at the train station, his arms folded tightly across his chest. Sherlock was being an absolute prick. He was hung over from the night before, and John was exhausted from anxiety and lack of sleep. He breathed deeply and reminded himself to unclench his jaw. His dentist had mentioned he’d crack a molar if he continued on the way he did.
“You must be Jane?” John gave her a substantial once-over. John smiled to himself at the fact that they coordinated in several ways: blue eyes, blonde hair, both about 5’7”, and both wearing white cable knit sweaters.
“Sherlock?”
John was out of his chair and crossing the tiled floor. He wrapped his arms instinctively around her as she shook, sobbing into his chest. He only held her, not saying a word, and waited for her to find herself again. She pressed her forehead into John’s sternum and sighed deeply. Her fingers clutched the wool of his jumper.
“Tomorrow evening. I just need tonight to clean up the edges a bit.”
John was certain November in Afghanistan had never been colder.
He sat in the corner; the floor was dirt and there was one dim light suspended from the ceiling. He blinked his eyes, shocked at the reintroduction of color. He cowered at the condition of his body. John was in nothing but his pants, and his legs were battered and covered in dried blood and earth. His hands were bound and hung limply in his lap. He had been gagged with a cloth through his teeth. The room reeked of death and he tried to fight off thoughts of the inevitable.
John remembered B telling him in the first few months they met.
I'm sorry it's not brilliant; it's moderately uneventful. But it's here. Please! Still love me!
“Well, fuck. I’m afraid you’re just going to have to be offended. I only have orange soda, ginger ale and lemonade.”
“Where are you going?”
Sherlock loved being home. His proper home. He enjoyed the city, but the older he got, the harder he found it to think through the London fog. He thought it aged him, his need for quiet and real darkness at night. He stretched and wriggled his toes, breathing in the earthy scent of dirt and water. The river was high; the rain had been heavy the past week and Sherlock’s usual perch had been swallowed up by white, frothy stream.
“Good thing I’m not here for the praise,” Sherlock quipped. John laughed, then bit his lip at the accidental friction between their hips. He opened his eyes to find Sherlock smirking, smug as
John’s mind flickered to a thought made of pure filth.
Wash. Rinse. Repeat.
“To anyone who is fortunate enough to have never had to meet me before tonight, I’m John Watson. And I apologize in advance for my poor behavior as the night proceeds.” The crowd chuckled and murmured and John’s head was spinning. He glanced around the room and found Sherlock sitting alone at a round table, legs crossed and an amber colored beverage in hand. He was elegant and gorgeous and unattainable. Sherlock gave him the smallest smile and a duck of his head,
“John Watson. Keep that mouth clean in my sanctuary. And yes, it’s an immense amount of work. Now shush, the curtain’s going up soon.”
“Goodnight, John," the baritone voice echoed from the living room up into the stairwell.
“So where is he? Call him up and invite him over.” Rhys waggled his eyebrows and slid down from the counter. John shook his head, a chuckle escaping his mouth in the process.
Sherlock spat into the sink and ducked his hand underneath, sipping the cold water from his cupped palm. He contemplated as he swished the water around his mouth, glad to have the burn of stomach acid gone. Perhaps not completely heterosexual. He rinsed his saliva from the sink and grabbed a washcloth from his bag. He considered the few signs that might speak otherwise. It wasn’t much to go on, but this most recent encounter. Well. He’d only been brushing his teeth. And the act of emptying one’s stomach is far from a typical kink. He remembered the burning of his skin where John had pushed away his unruly curls from his head. The skin of his arms flushed hot at the thought of Watson’s gentle hands tracing the new;y found scars, candid thoughts pouring from his lips as though they had conversations like those every day, and had been for years. Bisexual. John Watson could be bisexual. Sherlock tried to calm the heat rising to his face with the cold, damp cloth. He put his things away, zipped up the duffel and reexamined himself in the mirror. He ran a hand through his disheveled curls, and undid another button on his shirt. He leaned down to pick up his bag and walked out the door. John stood next to it at attention. Sherlock chuckled, and the doctor turned at the sound.
Sherlock. I know it's taking ages to get them properly acquainted, but please have faith! It will all be worth it, I promise!
“Of course.” The captain noted the sultry tone of his own voice. Jane was right. Pining. Damn.
a·vow
John stepped back and used his jumper sleeve to wipe the wet from his face. “Sometimes?” He looked up at Sherlock, swollen and watery-eyed. John hesitated a moment, and decided to continue the sentimental streak. “You are the first person in my life to believe I am something of worth. Thank you.”
Panic swarmed John’s head at the suggestion. It was enough to make a confession of this sort to twenty-two men that looked up to you, admired you, and listened to you. It was something else entirely to describe his new interest to them.
And that was all he needed. Jess brought a second glass, and the boys drown into their routine, like nothing had ever happened. And in the back of John’s mind, he knew nothing had. Nothing was different, not really. Not in Callum’s eyes, or anyone else's. Did he really need anything more?
“Forgive me, but I don't believe you. Not for one second.”
John’s eyes spoke volumes, but mostly sparked with a gentle “thank you.”
Knock them dead. And please, make it an interesting case. SH
“I’m ready for a proper fucking shower, and to skip the mummy wrappings every day, but all things considered, I’m fine.” He knew it wasn’t what the captain had wished for, but Sherlock felt confident that John expected nothing in return. He was asking to ask, and offering help when he could give it.
“Is that… I mean, can you do that? Isn’t he a Detective Inspector?”
He pulled his covers back,
“Oh! My apologies, sir! If I may say so, that last scrum that won you the International Cup was beautiful. Your fullback is phenomenal.”
Sherlock wrapped the blanket tighter around his feet and turned up the volume on the telly.
He grabbed his jacket, gloves, helmet and keys, and locked up the flat.
Then, somehow, they had made it through the door, and Sherlock had pinned him to the wall and was peeling John’s coat from his shoulders. Hot, desperate gasps left their mouths between frantic, tortured kisses. John found the buttons on Sherlock’s shirt and unfastened them, locking onto Sherlock with lust blown eyes. They were climbing the stairs and struggled with the door to their place, laughing in heavy, short breaths. Sherlock took John’s face in his hands and fell still. There they were, after all this time, standing in the open door of
“Jane! You’re the maid of honor! Aren’t you supposed to remember these things?” Molly giggled over her fourth beer. The pasta had not done much in keeping her head clear and focused.
“They are wounds, John, not living things. I can leave my arms bare and show my battle scars to everyone in camp, if that is what you wish.” His voice was bitter.
Molly exited the cab with ease. She was one hell of a woman, and John loved her for Callum. She was a fascinating combination of grace and clumsiness, innocence and fervor. Her silver heels clacked on the sidewalk as she led the way to Marylebone, peering over her right shawl-covered shoulder. The grin plastered across her face warmed John’s heart. It honestly had not mattered either way whether he won the wager and came tonight, but he knew it would please Molly, and that had been more than enough to convince him to follow through. Callum walked next to him, one step for John’s every two. Everett’s green eyes watched his fiancé with untouched adoration. John could tell he was tracing the straps of Molly’s pewter colored dress, resting on her shoulders in particular, before following down to admire her calves. John looked away and gave Callum the privacy. Oddly enough, being with them never made John feel lonely. Katherine didn’t appreciate the pair of them the way John did. She didn’t listen to Molly when she spoke, didn’t look Callum in the eye when he tried to explain a play, or the rules of rugby. She was fun, but she wasn’t a Molly. Sometimes John wondered if anyone would see him settled. He liked being the good time; loved it, in fact. The thought of him planting roots somewhere and being with one person for an extended period of time was a curious one. He mulled it over as he entered through the glass doors of the venue. Marble floors covered the expanse of the interior, silver fixtures and a large, crystal chandelier setting off prisms across the walls and John’s gray suit. It was luxurious in an understated way, and John chuckled at the absolute contradiction of the thought.
John smiled at him, and nodded, silently agreeing. The kettle began to yell and John took it off, pouring the boiling water over the tea. He picked up the glasses and carried them past Sherlock into the sitting room, two coasters already set in place for them. They sat on the sofa, Sherlock folding himself up into a tiny space. John smiled at his navy and red argyle socks peeking out from the hems of his blue jeans. The telly was on, but it was barely a whisper. John scooped up some of his thai basil chicken.
John ghosted off the plane and through customs. He stepped off the last stair of the escalator and headed toward his baggage claim. The crowd slowly began to gather and the luggage was spat out of the center and distributed across the cold metal. His camouflage duffel surfaced. By the time he registered it, another man had already scooped it up. John walked towards the man, bristled. He went to tap him on the shoulder, but paused. The gray, wool trench coat billowed as the brunette turned around, and then John was staring at that face. Metallic gray eyes, so different but exactly the same, brown curls tamed and trimmed, and those absurd, ridiculous cheekbones. Air left him in the form of a gasping sob. In one short step, he was in Sherlock’s chest, breathing in his smell (formaldehyde, something warm and spicy, like nutmeg or cinnamon, and London. God, he smelled of rain and damp and smog and

was on the shelf underneath, and Sherlock pulled it. The spine was worn, the pages broken in and smelling slightly of cedar and John’s cologne. He inhaled and smiled. The front cover had an inscription:
He stayed like that for nearly two hours, listening to Sherlock make love with the horse hair strings of his bow. It grew quiet in the flat and John untangled himself from sheets.
If John showed up to watch his rehearsal, fantastic. If he didn’t… Well.
John shivered all over. “Sherlock?”
“I saw your show. Incredible, what you do. You’re breathtaking. I mean. It’s breathtaking.”
Molly’s brown eyes went as huge as saucers. “Twelve days? You haven’t talked to John in twelve days?”
“Hmmmm?”
Finally, Sherlock gave an involuntary plunge into John’s mouth, and John moaned, taking one hand to Sherlock’s back and applying pressure. “Yes, Sherlock. Please.” Sherlock’s eyes opened to reveal nearly solid black circles. John bit at his lip as Sherlock pressed the head of his cock against his mouth. “Jesus, yes, just like that.” His hips gave a slow rock forward, slipping into the warmth of John’s mouth, and back out again. Sherlock tilted his head up and back and pressed both his palms to the floor. A growl rumbled from his throat as he continued to rock into John’s mouth and pull himself nearly all the way out. John clawed at Sherlock’s back and hummed in delight as Sherlock set a steady rhythm. As his movements became more erratic, John noticed Sherlock sinking his teeth into his bicep to muffle his sounds. He held Sherlock’s hips steady, but only for a moment. “I want to fucking hear you.” He licked tauntingly at Sherlock’s length and released his hips. “Are we clear?” Sherlock’s eyes went wide at the command in John’s voice, and nodded. John took Sherlock into his mouth and pulled Sherlock’s hips forward again. Sherlock shifted one hand from the floor and fisted a handful of John’s hair in it instead. John nodded and gasped. Sherlock was pistoning his hips at a near frantic rhythm, all the muscles in his body tensing. He pulled out of John’s mouth and wrapped his other hand around his cock. He took two deep breaths through his nose. John clawed down his chest and kissed the inside of Sherlock’s wrist. “Yes. Come for me. Please, Sherlock.” Sherlock’s hand gave three swift pulls.
She laughed, head thrown back and throat exposed. “Sherlock, the songs are made up of universal
John straightened up and took a few deep breaths. He smiled. “You’re right, Sherlock. I’m ready for an afternoon cuppa. Does that sound alright?”
“Are you just going to stand back there or?” He would rather have him where he could see him, if he insisted on staying and ruining his perfectly nice night. The sound of sand against boots grew closer and soon Watson was standing right next to Sherlock, less than an arm’s length away. Sherlock turned his head only enough to see John Watson in his peripheral vision. His posture was straight as an arrow; he was stocky and strong and looked different in this light. Sherlock turned to observe John thoroughly. Softer. Handsome, even. His eyes were fearfully expressive, his mouth was an easy tell as well. It was turned up at the right corner in a small smile. His brows were relaxed, eyes wide and alert. He always seemed on. It was three in the damned morning. Most soldiers are savoring every second of sleep before that god awful, spine splitting morning call came at 0430.
This was a holiday from real.
Jane walked slowly back into her classroom, her administrator trailing behind her. They both sipped on their tea. “Thank you, Dr. Phillips, but I don’t think that will be necessary.” They lingered in the middle of her room, the smell of earl grey blending in with traces of bleach.
John woke to a deafening roar. Every window was glowing red. Frantically, he scrambled from his cot, grabbing at his uniform, hastily lacing his boots. The ground reverberated underneath him. He thought it would open up and the flames of hell would swallow him whole. The window panes shattered, and darkness consumed him.
Jane was listening intently, so John, unaware of the words falling out of his mouth, continued.

John finished the last spoonful of his chocolate pudding. The nurse had stirred him awake to eat, now that he was well enough for mostly solid foods. He pushed the tray away and rested back into his pillow. Before he decided to return to his most popular hobby as of late (sleeping), an envelope caught his eye.
“John.”
Sherlock stood in the frame of the stall, staring at him. What the hell
Jane choked on the onion hanging out of her mouth. Then she howled, bent over and clutching her stomach, mirth glistening in the corners of her eyes.
“I had expected you to be a bit more clever.”
John set the mugs on the coffee table, sure to find coasters first. Sherlock’s flat was impeccably clean; it wasn’t that he believed Sherlock to be a mess, but he certainly pictured Sherlock to be comfortable. It was stunning – all white and glass and shelves and boxes, but it felt sterile. The sofa was comfortable, at least, and he was keeping company with one of the most intriguing men in London. That was really all he needed.
“Yesh, I shaid, whatsh the plan fer today?”
Sherlock thumbed the fresh, white gauze idly. “Nor can I, to be perfectly honest.”
he knows something I do not.
“No.”
A tiny word fell from John’s mouth, barely more than a whisper. “Harry.”
“Yes. Quite, thank you.” He placed his right hand on Sherlock’s thigh, his thumb rubbing loving circles through the expensive fabric.
“You live here alone?” Jane seemed surprised, and John didn’t know what to make of that.

Then a silhouette took the stage. It was male; tall, lean, and defined. Confident and swift, he moved like a river. John’s eyebrows rose a bit on his forehead. Irene swept her arms in a grand gesture, and strings began. John could hear the cello in particular. It had always been one of his favorites. He watched Irene, as her jaw clenched and her delicate hands instructed hundreds with an insane ferocity. He moved his eyes back to the stage. The silhouette had become a shadow to the music. Every swell of the strings, he moved after them, tugging at the last tiny traces of each note. He moved out of the darkness and into the burgundy lighting. John felt his breath halt in his chest.
“How was it then?” John asked. Jane sensed a small amount of tension as Callum came further into the room, nursing his Imperial. They had talked and talked about it before the boys arrived. She knew Callum would be fine.
John nodded, enraptured with the scars. “I know.”

John opened his eyes to find Sherlock looking fixedly at him. His hand traced John’s jaw, catching on the rough stubble left from two days without shaving.

“Couldn’t rest any longer. Tired of being pinned up in that tiny cell.”
“You must miss London, Mr. Holmes. I can see it on your face. I’m sorry you’re stuck here.”
I'll bet he's told you a hundred times over.
John woke to hot liquid pouring on his face. He closed his eyes tight and coughed, trying not to inhale. It stopped. John opened his eyes, only to hear the zipping of pants.
“I’m doing quite well, thank you. Congratulations on your win at the International Cup! My father was so excited.”
As a side note, that the marvelous Marcy09 pointed out, the ages of John and Sherlock are 30 and 27, respectively. This puts them at ages 28 and 25 during University moments. Sherlock is working on a doctorate degree (of some sort) in Chemistry, while John is finishing up medical school. He is currently trying to work out where to do his internship.
Sherlock tucked the blankets around John. He lay sleeping in the middle of the bed. Sherlock perched on the window sill, drawing his knees up to his chest. The weather was finally growing warmer, and summer nights would be here in a few short months. A breeze swept in around his ankles. John stirred, and tucked his chin farther into his elbow.
“Oh honestly, John. Context clues. It was a matter of time before one of us asked the other, so of course, I was prepared.”

“Yeah, B. That’d be fantastic. Thank you.” The boys began to settle, on barstools, against the kitchen wall, on the sofa. Rhys pulled himself up on the kitchen counter. They all sipped their beverage and looked on at John with kind eyes.
4. burning, fiery, or hot:
“Hold this?” Sherlock whispered. John reached out and took the bundle of wool fabric. Sherlock began to walk away and John raised his eyebrow, befuddled. And then Sherlock turned round to face him. He was certainly facing only John, as his eyes were boring into his: pale, devious, flirtatious. John licked his lips.
John looked to Molly and grinned. “I’ll take good care of him, Molly. Don’t fret.”
Jane and Molly's dance:
look like a Bernini carving. His hand ran through his wet, inky curls and then across his face, wiping away excess water. John was desperately trying to become as inattentive as possible. Trouble was going to rise if he didn’t, and he knew exactly where it would show up: straight between his legs.
Molly turned to watch the two in the kitchen, smiling as Jane nearly choked on the concoction. John covered his mouth with his hand, trying to stifle a laugh. Jane swiped her sleeve across her pursed lips, and then set the glass down with a clunk.
anything!”
“John, are you alright? What can I get you?”
Sherlock smiled. “All right. Are you… are you actually hungry?”
“May I have you now?” He felt Sherlock rise to a sitting position. John gently opened his eyes, the lights from the vanities creating a halo around Sherlock’s ridiculous hair.
"Yes. Alright, alright!"
“Sherlock,” John murmured. The sweat touched ringlets continued to travel across John’s chest, lips soft and slick on tender skin.
Sherlock watched as John stood at the bar, foot tapping in rhythm with the music, as he waited for his whiskey shot.
“I was just about to take a shower. Alright?” His forehead was wrinkled in concern seeing as Molly raising her voice was a bit of a rarity.
For all that is good in this world.
“I… I dunno. I’m in the back of someone’s van, but I’m pretty sure I’m somewhere in Brixton.”
John pulled away and Molly looked up, waving her hands at her face to encourage stubborn tears to stay in place.
“Now. Please.” John released Sherlock’s length with a suctioned
He undressed quickly and efficiently; nothing about this scenario was sexy or arousing. In fact, it stamped out all physical impulses, even the natural ones. “Lift,” Sherlock demanded, and John, wobbly and unstable, barely raised his arms. Sherlock gave his elbows a stronger push upwards and tugged his jumper up over his head and dropped it in the floor. “Turn around,” the commanding continued. He unbuttoned John’s trousers and pulled everything off and down in one fell swoop. John stood, naked and drunk, in his tiny bathroom. Sherlock resisted the urge to yell, cry, caress and shake. This entire situation was just insane and illogical. “Come on now, John. Me first, then you after.” Sherlock slid into the hot water and cut the tap, then reached out his hands. “Slowly, you’re a bit unsteady,” he muttered. John slipped one foot into the tub, followed by the other. Sherlock gripped John under his arms and helped him ease into a sit position, his back to Sherlock’s chest. “That’s it. Lean back, I’ve got you. Just relax.”
have to be the one to walk to you?”
“I love you, John.” Callum whispered. “You know your happiness is all I want. And if this guy is it, well I’ll be fucking damned to have a sour word to say about it.” John felt the tears sting, and damn did they sting, and shamed himself for ever doubting. Of course Callum had his fucking back. When had he ever
Sherlock smirked and turned back to the room. It was small, but obviously a vast improvement compared to the sand floor and canvas walls of the tent. It was all white, a bit unnerving, and perfectly clean. The facility was brand new, Sherlock knew this, and he was the first patient to stay in room 221, located in wing B. He chuckled at the thought of christening it.
“Is this continent one of the three?” His voice felt small and feeble in his chest. Grogginess washed over him. He was basking in a post-orgasm haze.
“I love you, Molly.” John gave her his curt nod of reassurance before turning to Jane.
“You prick! You think you’re so clever!” John was borderline breathless. The adrenaline was damn near killing him. He thought he could feel the swelling of his veins everywhere in his body. Sherlock had almost died; John shot a man; John was just
As the first wave of ecstasy wracked through John’s body, Sherlock nearly sobbed as his own followed suit. He was enveloped by the sounds spilling from John’s mouth, beautiful murmurs and broken whispers, and pure, unaltered white. Their lips grazed, exchanging an electric pulse that could short-circuit the entirety of London. John stroked the side of Sherlock’s face as they found their way back to a moderate equilibrium. Sherlock was trying to keep his composure; tears were threatening to pour with heartless abandon. He had a strong feeling that John could see straight through him. Sherlock pulled them onto their sides and John gave him a dazzling kiss; it was solid, firm, his tongue soft against the roof of his mouth.
“Man. If having someone else live in this flat would help me get my dishes done that quickly every night, I might have to consider it.” Jane topped off John’s drink, and she grabbed the orange soda from the counter. They headed into the living room where Callum and Molly were working on two beers.
John’s fingers tapped the edge of the rickety card table before leaning back and finishing the last of his god-awful coffee. A small smile pulled at the right edge of his lips; what a foreign thing it had become, to smile.
He couldn’t lie; John had expected the arrival at his flat to tense him up immensely. He was waiting for his muscles to wind tight under his skin, for his hands to tremble, to feel the movement of his blood in every vein, artery and capillary in his body. None of that happened. The door opened and John was passing through it, feeling out of his flesh, watching Sherlock watching him, peeling his jumper over his head, the sleeves dragging slowly across his arms.
Molly stepped inside, followed by Callum and then John saw a blonde – finally, another – trot up the stairs. “Sorry, I just… Hi.” She stood on the top step, a look on her face that John placed somewhere between surprise and curiosity. She gave an awkward half-wave.
“Too modern for me.” Sherlock’s voice echoed out, pulling John from his trance.
The man stepped forward, extended the hand free of a gin and tonic, and his small smile broke into a grin. It immediately set John at ease, reminded him of Egan, and he grabbed the hand in a solid shake.
“You brought me here,” John murmured against Sherlock’s open mouth, planting a small kiss on his lower lip.
An hour and a half later, she heard her phone ring. She hummed along with the score for the Star Trek original series. Jane didn’t answer. Ten minutes later, it rang again. She groaned, loud and annoyed, as she swayed her way into the kitchen, where her phone was buzzing against the counter-tops. She picked it up and placed it to her ear.
Sherlock gave a grind of his hips against John’s backside. John smirked.
“You’re overthinking it, mate.” He felt John tense next to him, turning his shoulders toward the 22 metre area. Callum spoke in a whisper as he turned his back to the pitch and closer to John’s ear. “It’s all fine, John. Truly. Now put this to bed and be with us.” John faced Callum with a look of guilt overtaking his features. He gave one stern nod and exhaled the stale air from his lungs.
After a shower and meager dinner in mess hall, the doctor pulled out paper and a pen. He had developed a bi-weekly ritual. The letter would arrive. He would read it first thing in the morning, mull it over and concoct a response whilst at his post, and then wrote said response in the evening. He had also grown fond of writing his letters with Collective Soul as company. He set the pad of paper and a pen on the bed between his knees, hunching over in a near fetal position as he wrote.
John finally found the proper section of notes in his disaster of a folder. “Okay, so I’m having a hard time with plasmid transmission and transposons.”
"I said don't. touch. me," John growled.
Sherlock’s foot tapped nervously against the floor, frustrated by Irene’s tardiness. Would it kill her to show up for something on time? She knew he had a million—
“Is that so?” John kissed Sherlock’s collarbone through the fabric.
A warm crash hit John then, deep in his chest, spreading to every digit on his extremities; it heated him from his ears to the soles of his feet. Sherlock had signed his name on those terrified letters. In all the time he and John had been friends, Sherlock
“Of course he didn’t, Cap. But the point is that he could have,” B piped up. Jane gave him a teasing swat on his backside and pushed him down the next step.
They kissed away the questions, hesitation, and curiosity, at least for the night. They would have the morning to discuss any and all events the evening had held.
Jane shut her door and toed off her Chucks, her wool socks warm from walking from the Tube. She dropped her satchel next to the red suede sofa and headed straight into the kitchen. As Jane eyed the tea selection in her cabinet, a weird, sick feeling twisted in her stomach. She didn’t actually want to be alone tonight, but she also didn’t want to be around people who knew her too well. She wanted to enjoy company without being made to feel pitied, or being worried over. She dug her cell from her coat pocket and dialed B, hoping he was in for the evening.
“Will you lock it back, please? Since it’s just the two of us.”
The hair on the back of John’s neck rose, quick and fierce. The tone of her voice chilled him to the bone. “Of course, Harry, where are you?”
John thought. Jane twisted her hair up in a knot on the top of her head and leaned back on the sofa.
(of a loud noise) be repeated several times as an echo.
The sun bore down on the back of Captain Watson’s neck.
“Yes, John. Just... just. Like. That. It’s… your… this. Perfect.”
“Hi. Coming in, or should I grab my coat?”
Sherlock folded, gladly, and grasped the lapels of John’s coat.
Sherlock sighed dramatically and dog-earred the page of his book. He let it plop onto his lap. Internally, he wasn’t sure how to feel about the doctor’s attentiveness. On one hand, it fascinated him. It had been ages since he had come across someone who was even moderately observant. Apart from Mycroft, of course. He doesn’t count; he isn’t human. Sherlock chuckled at that thought, allowing his wrists to be examined. The younger Holmes hadn’t fallen much farther from the tree. While he had gained some of his father’s greater traits, the intellect, appearance, and air, he was far more experienced in the realm of humanity than Mycroft was. Of course, it was only because of curiosity that Sherlock knew as much as he did. The captain’s thumb ran gently across three new scars. They were bright pink and puckered, and he imagined them being silky to the touch. The contact caused gooseflesh to rise on his arms.
“Two sugars is correct.” John glanced over his shoulder to see Sherlock leaning on the wall that connected the kitchen to the sitting room, watching him. He was smirking.
We are long overdue for a chapter! I'm sorry for the delay! This one includes LOTS of dialogue, and a lot more John and Sherlock than the ones prior. I hope you enjoy. I have good things mapped out for you.
“Don’t be a cock, of course I’m alright. And you’re an asshole.” John turned on his heels and walked back towards the main road. Sherlock reached his side in half the steps (of course, damn him and his long, lean, gorgeous, edible legs…) and slipped his fingers between John’s.
“’Course. How’s B?”
“I’m off today. I apologize, Molly. I did not intend to waste your time.” Molly pushed the damp hair from his forehead and gave him a small smile.
“Touch yourself,” John commanded in as gentle a tone as possible. While Sherlock seemed modestly surprised at the demand, he was quick to obey, in just as teasing a fashion as he did with unbuttoning his top. Sherlock’s magnificent hands toyed with the tented fabric of his bottoms. Locking eyes briefly with John, Sherlock smirked as he let his head fall back, closed his eyes, and chewed that full bottom lip, right palm pressing hard against the top button and zipper, left thumb hooking a belt loop of his bottoms and pulling down. The lines of his hips were a revelation, and John groaned softly, flexing his hips in order to create some friction, any friction, against his leaking cock.
“You’re right, Sherlock. I’m sorry for being a self-absorbed prat…” Sherlock continued walking without looking to John. “I’m just terrified of leaving again.”
“Ignore all of that. It's just the shock talking.”
Sherlock' brows furrowed together. "Pathetic?" His tone was incredulous.
With a wink and deviant grin, the captain was gone.
“Glad to hear it. Want anything? A cuppa? Hot chocolate? Chai?”
The guards weren't aware that John had become very fond of the dark.
what the fuck do they know
of a hooker, a decent captain… But he was sure this might be the best day of
“Yes, I’d like to place an order for take away, please.”
“Sherlock Holmes.”
Determining this, Sherlock took the last sip of his tea before standing and gathering his things. He wrapped his scarf around his neck and laced up his trainers.
A single violin rang out. Sherlock’s fingers curled as if he were clawing at the floor, trying to dig a hole through the stage. Then his arms spread wide apart before one hand found its way into his own head of hair. Then he was pulling himself over and back, shoulder blades flat against the ground and knees still folded underneath him. John watched in fascination as Sherlock arched his back, rising to his knees and extending one hand tall and strong above him. John couldn’t help watching the muscles as they tensed; every move was so deliberate and full of undeniable intention. Three other violins joined in, harmonizing with the first, and then Sherlock was on his feet, walking, running? Pacing, John decided, from one end of the stage to the next. A quiet “huh” escaped from John’s lips. Sherlock stilled in the center of the stage and the violins dropped to a beautiful whisper. Irene’s eyes were closed, her chin high as her hands moved to and from the center of her chest. Sherlock began to sway slowly side to side, like a pendulum. His left hand began to tick, as if possessed by a twitch or tremor. A cello joined the violin, a deep reverberating sound. Sherlock’s jaw jerked up and to the right, suddenly, frantically, as a look of epiphany bloomed across his face. John admired the perfect “oh” of Sherlock’s lips. And then he lept across the stage, landing silently on his feet and folding to the floor in one, fluid movement. One knee tucked in close to his heaving chest, his other leg extended in a languid fashion. He rolled to his side, unfurling his leg, extending his arms above his head, and John was able to study the entire length of him. He shifted uncomfortably in his chair. One of Sherlock’s hands began to grip at his chest, tugging his white shirt taut across his abdomen, and suddenly John felt very hot. The hand made its way down to his thigh, digging into his flesh. His back arched against the floor, and his chin tilted back; the body language was personified lust. John tugged at his tie and set his binoculars down. Molly peered over at him, a look of concern on her face.
“Alright.” Callum said quietly. “Tell us about him.”
“Don’t worry, I-”
“Hello. Hungry?”
“Sherlock.” John gave a gentle nod, allowing himself to soak in that gorgeous cupid’s bow and a pair of lush lips.
John choked on his soda, his straw grabbing at the opportunity to stab him in the gum. “What? New Scotland Yard? Is that even
“Sherlock? Woo-hoo!” A small, fiery woman poked her head out from the door at the bottom flat.
Sherlock laughed. It started as a deep chuckle and exited in a resonant baritone, bouncing off everything in the room.
John had cringed at some of the horror stories B had told him about some of the other boys from the home. B went out on his own after he came of age. He got a job as a server at a nice restaurant and worked under an angel named Mrs. Hudson. She helped him out by giving him a discounted flat above the restaurant. B saved up, bought himself a bike, joined a gym. He worked over forty hours a week, and focused on training himself for rugby. For the life B had, John knew the kid was incredibly self-aware. B knew he had trouble managing anger and resentment. John figured, like most kids with a shitty home life, B could have taken it out on everyone else, turned to substance abuse, done horrible things and used his past as the excuse to ride until he found himself in a tits up situation he couldn’t bullshit his way out of. In fact, that scenario rang all too familiar. But B had channeled all that fury into athletics, and making himself physically, and mentally, stronger. B was a quiet guy, mild and soft-spoken in most situations. You would never believe him to be a boy who grew up feeling unloved and unworthy of other people’s love. He had turned himself into a man who knew the love he held for himself was enough, and had to be for the time being. John believed him to be one of the bravest men he had ever met.
“I thought that much was obvious.”
“John, I’m sorry I can’t tell you in person, or even over the phone. It was a fortune to get this tiny thing overnighted to you. The funeral is Sunday.” John’s heart sank into the pit of his stomach, dread wrapping its icy tentacles around every vessel in his body. He lifted the slip of paper:
“Isn’t the Enterprise gorgeous?” It was a loaded question.
John quirked his left eyebrow and a smile tugged at the right corner of his mouth. Sherlock’s eyes darkened instantly at John’s expression.
Finally, he turned to face Sherlock, and something flinched inside Sherlock’s chest. As the kettle hovered over the cup, Sherlock noticed that it was getting dangerously full.
John stood behind closed doors, feeling as though he may just black out and hit the floor. His future husband stood on the opposite side of those heavy, oak panels, waiting for him.
“It isn’t fair,” she said in a broken whisper. “How can he be gone? He was here yesterday. Sitting just there.” Dr. Phillips rubbed her back tenderly. “He was such a gentleman. At least for me.” He let her go and took a step back, grabbing the cup of black tea from the Keurig.
“Alright. You’re right. That was fucking horrible.” John was shaking with laughter as he reached for the plates. As he turned around, Jane pointed an enthusiastic finger at his chest.
“If this is the interview that will lead to your lifelong career, then no, John, there is no such thing as too formal.”
Molly dropped to her knees at the edge of the stage, wrapping her arms around Callum’s neck. “Depends. Don’t you think I need more practice?” He leaned forward and kissed where her right hip bone protruded through her clothes. Callum wrapped his arms around her waist and lifted her off the stage.
Sherlock’s knuckles hovered over the solid wood of John’s door.
“Well. We are speaking of Mycroft, and he is easily the most dramatic individual I’ve ever encountered.”
Sherlock ran a hand through his sweat lined curls. What he would give for a proper shower. The hygiene here in Kandahar was shameful; how the soldiers endured it, he had no idea. Although, they were a different class of human altogether – submissive to the orders of those above them. They would never care about having six minutes of lukewarm water and a mutual bar of soap. But Sherlock’s skin broke out in gooseflesh at the thought. As soon as he returned to London, he would take a hot shower for days. He missed Baker Street. Desperately. Never thought he would admit to that. Kandahar was miserable. Dusty, khaki-colored misery.
John's eyes hardened instantly. A venomous laugh left his throat. It was a foreign and unwelcome sound. Sherlock reminded himself to put on a thicker skin. This wasn't about him, and it was not a good time to make it so. He pressed his thumb to the bend of John's elbow, where the last tattoo lay nearly hidden. It simply said "here," comma included. "Tell me about this one, then." It seemed harmless enough.
“It’s going well, John, thanks. It’s mostly just covering the last minute details, finalizing a flower list, making sure all the suits and dresses are coming in on time…”
“Prepared…?”
John sat facing Sherlock, nestled comfortably into the worn, leather sofa of the den. He watched Sherlock’s face as his boyfriend told the story of how he came to inherit the estate rather than his Parliamentary brother, Mycroft. What kind of name was Mycroft, anyhow? Then again… he supposed the name Sherlock wasn’t any less odd.
“Right. Get back to him. Dinner later this week? All of us?”
“I love you, Jane. You know I do.”
“No, John. It is because it is you who has the wounds.”
, he is not allowed!”
John's eyebrows shot up in surprise. "You're a Whovian?"
Anyway! Here's chapter four, likely to be modified/added to later/soon!
“I asked if I can stuff the chicken.”
Sherlock felt a small smile grab the right corner of his mouth and tug. John turned round from the bar, two shots in hand, and smirked at Sherlock. He raised a questioning eyebrow.
Inspiration for "Shezza's
“All good things I hope. Thank you. It's a pleasure to finally meet you, Jane. This is Irene.” Irene waved, since Jane's hand was now full of an awkwardly wet ice bag.
"Card not accepted. Please select-"
assert or confess openly.
Sherlock pulled John’s face to his and kissed him. Kissed each lip, kissed the corners of his mouth, and let their tongues slide together. John was clutching the fabric of his own clothing, draped over this incredible, fascinating, beautiful creature, on his sofa, in his flat, and he’d even slept in John’s bed to boot. “Jesus,” John breathed against Sherlock’s face, feeling the inevitable rush of blood between his thighs. Sherlock sat up straighter on the sofa, pulling John’s hips down onto his, and kissed through the cotton of his shirt.
He gave a small and somewhat apologetic smile. “Alright?”
The man waved a dismissive hand and disappeared inside the glass paneled building.
“John,” B started, “I don’t want to fuck this up.”
“Yes, that’d be lovely. Can we help?”
“To Watson!” the boys yelled in unison.
“Because I didn’t want to go,” she snapped. John mulled over the response. A little defensive, in his opinion.
Holmes rested his head against the window and closed his eyes. “How far?”
John gave a short, small nod of understanding.
“Honestly, John. Relax.” Sherlock ran his hands across the shoulders of the suit, dismissing tiny bits of lint. “You look great.”
John nodded solemnly. “Well, I most certainly am not ready to die. I’ve only just met you. As awful as it sounds, I’d like to make it to second base, as they say, so I suppose I’m willing to wait that bit out.”
“Mmm,” was all John gave to acknowledge her statement. He was confused. Didn’t Sherlock compose the music? Why didn’t he conduct the orchestra?
Sherlock grinned in the dark and began.
Playlist:
Her eyes grew wide on her face and she ducked her chin. Jane tucked a chunk of hair behind her ear.
Don't hate me. And know I do love you, though I've done nothing recently to show it. I'm truly sorry.
He had an inkling that Sherlock responded unreasonably well to praise. While he had never applied it in a sexual scenario like this one, he could recall from previous conversation the way Sherlock’s demeanor shifted when words of a complementary nature came into play. John was also quite aware that Sherlock enjoyed being taken more than he did taking, though he was truly delectable in either case.
“Some of her chai? Yes. I’m assuming you want a cup, then?” John turned away and made for the kitchen as Sherlock stepped into the bedroom to peel off his sweat soaked clothes.
399 days.
“Would you like a lift, then? You might want to bundle up…”
“Congratulations. You’re also a medical student; you’ve had a combined 6 hours of sleep the past two nights, judging by the twitches of your fingers and the state of your eyes. Finals are close for you. How much coffee have you consumed today, just out of curiosity?”
“OH MY GOD.”
John leaned over and pulled the metal chain to the lamp. Sherlock cowered from the light, squinting his eyes. “Sorry,” John mumbled.
” left Watson’s throat in a broken moan. Who the fuck
“Molly. You look lovely.”
“Just what, John? For Christ’s sake, use your words.”
kept secret or done secretively, especially because illicit.
“Enjoying yourself?”
Callum only nodded, eyes glazed over in thought.
“Anything I can assist with?” he asked.
Callum nodded, eyes scanning the crowd. He awkwardly pulled out the binoculars and put them to his eyes. “Wow. These things are wicked. I can literally see the panels on the stage.”
“You can’t know that. No one else has read them, and your opinion is biased.”
Dad was right.
“Sherlock. You are a man of many incredible gifts. You are brilliant, clever, brave, and too fearless for your own good. You are a bully at times, a menacing kisser, the best person to share a bed with. You are calm and composed, but more beautiful than ever when you fall apart. You are loyal, faithful, forgiving and patient. You are a fantastic penpal, a fierce friend, the most human human being I have ever met… and I do not deserve you.”
She gave a dark, bitter chuckle in response. “How long have you been pining over your best mate’s fiancée, John? That’s sick. Does he know? Do all three of you mutually benefit—“
synonyms: proclamation, notification, announcement, revelation, disclosure, broadcasting
He felt Sherlock chuckle underneath him. “Don’t apologize, John. I can be an impossible prick sometimes.”
The man laughed aloud, a rich sound that washed over John’s entire body. “You never know.”
“Thank you, Ginger. He’s a fox, but I think we work. Maybe.”
Sherlock stared at him. "A what?"
The ‘aw’ had not gone away. John melted into him.
“It’s okay. This is my job. We can come back tomorrow, or Wednesday, or next week. We have time.”
Sherlock slipped two fingers between his teeth, whistling loudly with Chachi, admiring the curve of John’s neck against the floor, the easy strength resting in his biceps and deltoid, hoisting his body effortlessly in the air. It wasn’t that Sherlock had believed John to be clumsy or uncoordinated. He knew that wasn’t true. Graceful, however, was not something Sherlock would have previously believed John to be. As Sherlock roved over the flexing of the moon phases banding his upper arm and the movement of the tendons underneath his Union Jack, far more explicit images flooded Sherlock’s mind. Could John lift him by the thighs, pin him to the wall, and fuck him senseless? Would John bark orders when he was on in the bedroom? Would he wash Sherlock’s hair in the shower? Did he trounce around his flat, starkers and gorgeous?
“We don’t have time for a one hundred and ten page novel, Sherlock! Our chat’s at two!”
They came to rest and John stepped away. Finding Sherlock’s wet eyes, he began.
this guy? He wasn’t human; it couldn’t be possible. He was too kind, too bright, far too observant to make Sherlock comfortable, too forgiving, too understanding, too fucking good at his job, too perky, to selfless, too professional, and too valiant. It was infuriating. John Watson was infuriating. Why did he feel so fucking flustered? He snatched the bag of toothpaste, deodorant, floss and the like from the doctor and sauntered to the counter. If you could call it sauntering. Is it still considered sauntering if you’ve just retched your fucking brain out in a hospital loo? He pulled out the toothbrush and paste, ran the faucet, and scrubbed his teeth. He eyed the doctor in the mirror. Watson looked several things at once. Concerned, likely about Sherlock’s condition. Guilty, probably for cutting off the morphine too quickly. Watson couldn’t have known he needed more weaning. Sherlock supposed John understood that he had an addictive personality, but not the extent of it. And mildly debauched. His cheeks were flushed and red, his mouth slightly parted, eyes widened a bit, not in panic, but in… arousal? Sherlock pulled the toothbrush from his mouth, locking John through the mirror. He raised an eyebrow, probing for an explanation. Watson blinked once, twice, then pinched the bridge of his nose and stepped out of the bathroom.
Sherlock brushed past him and walked outside into the sun. John, laughing to himself, followed. He heard the click of a lighter and turned to see Sherlock’s cheeks hollowed as he dragged on his cigarette. The end burned a hot red. John, feeling like a traitor, found this act incredibly attractive. He hated smoking, God, he hated it. Sometimes he would turn girls away, even if they just smelled of it. Holmes had become an exception to the aspiring doctor's rule. Sherlock’s pale fingers moved the filter from his mouth and the smoke left his lips. John soon realized he had been staring, and knew Sherlock would have felt it. He broke the trance and instead took to staring at his feet, trying to regain his composure.
“You stand tall, but not in order to feel bigger than others. You are proud, but humble. You are a man of careful thought, documentation, and emotion. You have endured a life of loss; your eyes speak of it, yes, but the artwork on your arms also lends itself to certain events, or perhaps people, rather than only being aesthetically pleasing. They are vibrant in color, suggesting the memories they document are not meant to be forgotten, but to be remembered and vividly.” Sherlock touched John’s chin with his fingertips, tracing the stubble. When had Sherlock seen his tattoos? “You are accustomed to being alone, but do not necessarily prefer it. Some of it has been done intentionally, your lady friends mostly, but others have been taken from you, likely without warning. Your love for those you care about is one of the fiercest I have ever witnessed: you take nothing and give everything and you do not resent others for it. You declare your love each day to those that are important to you. The men on your team are individuals of fantastic character, sound judgment, and you care for them as though they, too, are your blood.” John felt the tears pooling at his bottom lids, eager to spill over. “You are a man of gold, John Watson, yet believe yourself to be unworthy of so many things.” John watched Sherlock’s eyes glass over. “How can you possibly believe yourself unworthy? You are worthy of everything good. You are whole and right and rich and warm.”
“You should have called me, John. Whatever it was, I could have helped,” Sherlock heard himself whispering. This conversation may disappear into drunkenness forever, but he realized he needed this, even if John wouldn’t be able to recall it. “You idiot. What on earth could have possessed you to do this to yourself?” He started rinsing the suds down John’s back as he put his mind to work, piecing together the small bits of information he had. His hands stopped moving as the realization dawned on him. “Oh.
Sherlock broke out in gooseflesh, tears pricking strongly at the corners of his eyes as John took the shampoo in his hands to Sherlock’s scalp, rubbing his fingers in tiny circles until the lather was running down Sherlock’s back. He pulled John’s chin up and kissed him hard.
“No, I normally just start with a hot cuppa.” He raised John’s favorite mug, a pine green one with a black moose on it.
“Though the pattern of the scarring will be beautiful...” John thumbed the flesh above Sherlock’s right wrist once again, tracing each one. They formed a sort of checkerboard, two long slices running parallel to his veins, three smaller ones crossing over horizontally. Sherlock, for once in his life, couldn’t muster up a quip in response to John’s mildly offensive but somehow incredibly intimate comments. He felt cornered and suddenly wished it had been different: that he wasn’t the man John had deduced he was; that he was a better man. At the moment, all he felt was a bit not good.
John winced. Jane seemed startled by his response. She waved her hand dismissively, and then made a point to look at the man by the door and back to John. Then she winked and walked past him. He took it back. He took it all back. He was going to strangle her alive.
- Overall
I give no words of caution dear
“I run with you because I love this life, Sherlock. If I wanted safe, I never would have started this. You are what I want,
“Course. We’ll have you over.”
Callum smacked John’s ass, and John yanked his head up, snarling. “Fucking shit, Callum. Do you really have to wake me that way?”
He identified the first letter by the photograph. He chuckled, and though it stung like pure misery, he was so glad to feel it. He felt crow’s feet tickle his eyes and the pits of his cheeks ached from a full faced grin. Sherlock had actually sent him a photograph of the skull. AND, he had named it Billy.
“Now, Sherlock, that’s just cruel. Don’t mock me! I really do think he’s attractive!”
“Obviously. I had heard of you through Molly, but only pieced it together with the identification of Callum. I understand now the intensity of your eyes – you recognized me, felt some kind of way about me, dare I say attraction?” John ghosted a kiss across Sherlock’s mouth and smiled. “Yes, then, attraction. You were put off by Irene, unsure of her relationship to me, but dropped your eyes and continued as if nothing had happened. You spoke nothing of it to Callum or Molly, obviously fretting over them discovering, but why? You had previously identified as heterosexual, and indeed carry a reputation of being a very giving and satisfying lover, but only with women. The answer lies there, then. Why are you attracted to a man when you so love women, and if there were the possibility of your being bisexual, wouldn’t you have discovered it, working with a slew of highly attractive, by society’s standards, men? So I’m special then, special indeed, to make John Watson question his sexuality.”
“Mm.” Sherlock hummed in affirmation.
John blinked slowly, allowing sunlight to leak into the back of his head. He inhaled deeply, breathing in cedar, cigarette smoke and warm spice. His stretched out over pale grey sheets. John froze. This was not his bed.
You know your soul will rest
“I can imagine it’s quite a magnificent compliment, indeed.”
John was warmed by the idea, and quite frankly, would love to spend his nights wrapped up in Sherlock’s smell. He was nervous, though, about Sherlock fiddling through his things… but if he hadn’t done it by now, surely he wouldn’t do it once he was back. A bit of panic rose inside him. What if Sherlock had already found that damn ring? What had he been thinking, leaving it here?
“I apologize for my comments earlier. What I said was childish and selfish, and you did not deserve it.” John’s eyes widened as he laughed. Sherlock was taken aback by two things: one, that he apologized. Two, that John Watson was laughing at his apology.
He dug a knife out of the man’s pant pocket and stabbed it into the ground. Slowly, he bent over and rubbed the rope against the blade. He hadn’t the faintest idea how long he had been held. It could have been anywhere from three days to three months; unconsciousness does not help one keep track of time. John felt as if he hadn’t seen the sun in years. The rope fell to the ground and John twisted his hands inside the joints of his wrists. They burned and clicked, like parts of a machine that had been neglected. He stripped the beast on the ground, covered himself and quickly made his way out the door.
John laughed. “Of course you are.”
John felt his breath catch in his chest at the proximity of Sherlock’s waist to his own. Instantly, his cheeks heated. He looked incredible tonight; he wore a pale green button up under a black suit, topped with a deep pine colored tie, now drunkenly loosened. It did amazing things to his earth flecked irises.
John woke to whispers. He opened his eyes to see looming shadows. One stretched a long, distorted limb back and before John could retaliate, he felt metal collide with his skull.
am I enough?
He missed him. He did. Missed his tall, loopy handwriting; a code used to decipher something clever if you were bright and attentive enough to crack it. He missed his hands raking through his hair, the water droplets glistening on his back after the shower, the way the dust particles danced around him at his desk like tiny wisps.
“John?” he called out gently. Normally his intuition was in tune enough to deduce when something horribly wrong had already happened, and at the moment, he couldn’t detect any trace of that familiar pull in his stomach. There was no sound in the flat at all; Sherlock had started to wonder if he was alone when he rounded the corner to the sitting room.
John stood in his socks until the brilliant man turned the corner. He hustled up his steps and slipped inside the warm apartment. Once safely locked into the heat, John sat on the stair, hands in his hair, and laughed.
“Bet you everyone thinks I want to marry you instead. Pretty sure I sobbed like a child when you and Jane took the aisle.”
“I have no idea why you are insisting I come.”
“Of course I did, John. Well. Mycroft helped.” His voice held a bit of childish resentment.
Rhys would stag his way through the entire break, likely bringing home a different girl every night; Jasper said he had a few guitar gigs lined up at the local pubs. Most everyone had plans. Naturally, John had none. He had debated calling Katherine, but knew it would take too much work to salvage the barely-there relationship that had existed anyway, and he didn’t even want that. He was propped up on the sofa, popcorn on one side, whiskey in the other, watching the sixth season of Doctor Who when his mobile chimed.
“Hello, John.” Sherlock pressed a small kiss to John’s temple. “Care to take a bath with me?”
A black cat licks his paw
John was taken aback at the sudden outburst. He stopped still on the sidewalk. How the tides had turned. This conversation was so familiar, but John never imagined he would be on the receiving end of it; that he would be the lack of emotion. He restlessly ran both his hands through his hair and interlocked his fingers behind his neck. He stared at the wet cement, watching tiny snowflakes kiss it and then melt instantly. The ending for them was inevitable, and yet they tenderly touched the ground every time before melting into it. He looked up at Sherlock through furrowed brows. What did he want John to say? Shit, what did John want to say?
He wrapped his arms around Sherlock and rocked himself up, settling on top of the lean, sinuous line of gorgeous anatomy now beneath him. Sherlock’s collarbones were lovely, having more anterior and posterior travel than most. The place where his sternum met the long, bowing line of his ribs was prominent, moving with Sherlock’s deep breaths. John gave a soft open-mouthed kiss to a dusky, raised nipple, tenderly pulling it between his teeth to lap at it with an attentive tongue. The first sound to leave Sherlock’s mouth was a rich, dark moan, his back bowing, pushing his chest closer to John’s. He wrapped a strong arm underneath the bridge constructed by Sherlock’s spine and held him tight.
“Already at it, huh?” Callum sat next to him, slipping on his boots and lacing them snugly.
He looked at John and shook his head. Sherlock’s expression read somewhere between bored and irritated. “No. Graham is aware, but only because he mingles with all sorts as I do. The others aren’t up to date.”
“I wouldn’t recommend the orange soda. I speak from experience. I typically just do it on the rocks, but this blend goes well with ginger ale.”
John bent down to pick up a bundle of envelopes, some faded and others bright white, looking as though they had just been sealed.
John chewed at the inside of his lip in contemplation before shaking his head. “No, I don’t think I’ve anything on. Why?”
Jane waggled her eyebrows at him. John rolled his eyes, then smirked.
“Molly, hi. Yes! I have a proposal for you. You most certainly do not have to agree, but I think you might be interested.”
John burst out in exasperated giggles. Sherlock looked mangled and hurt, clearly shocked by John’s response. “I’m the vacant one?” John managed through the laughter. “Me? I’m dull?”
, but such a prat.”
As the waiter made his way over, a loud swarm of people began to pass in front of the window. Sherlock turned instinctively, observing the group of men. All were freshly bathed, bodies still seeming flushed and rosier than the cold weather typically allowed. Three, nine, twelve… twenty-two. There were twenty-two of them. All were built differently, but athletic in appearance. He ran through the possibilities in his head.
"Yes."
The cabbie parked on Baker Street. Sherlock paid the fare and insisted on getting John’s luggage from the trunk.
but I will not see you there.
There was long, thin scar that ran half the length of Sherlock’s ribcage, the tiny dashes of past stitches barely visible. The new flesh shone a brighter pink against the rest of his fair skin, ivory against the inevitable freckle and sun of John’s arms. He kissed it in length, one small kiss directly beside the next. Sherlock braced one foot against the duvet, bending his leg at the knee, and rocked into the warmth of John’s hip. John gave a breathy exhale against Sherlock’s chest and continued to cradle this exquisite man as his hips oscillated against John. He laced his arm under the crook of Sherlock’s other knee, and sat up, folding his knees underneath him. With his mouth, he traced the muscles of Sherlock’s thigh, working his way across to his knee. Sherlock’s head sunk further into the duvet, turning away from John, the ligaments of his neck arching into beautiful webs. He planted a soft kiss to Sherlock’s kneecap, bony amongst the lean muscle of the rest of his body. Sherlock’s hand wound up to clutch at John’s shoulder, attempting to pull him down. John obeyed, drawing Sherlock’s legs tightly around his waist. Sherlock’s eyes were unrefined, wild in their expression, and both his hands tugged at John’s hair, his neck, the thin skin between his shoulder blades. John hissed at the sensation of nails along his ribs. Sherlock found his mouth like a collision of two momentous objects: hard, unyielding, and unforgiving. John absorbed the crash; he enveloped Sherlock in his arms, and for every bite of a lip, every slip of tongue endeavoring to explore, every rasping breath, John was there to meet him fervently. John pulled Sherlock up, pulled him as close as he could; he wanted his skin to vibrate at their contact.
“Ah. So you’ll be out most of the day then?” John couldn’t help but feel disappointed. He knew Sherlock couldn’t turn down work forever, and Watson didn’t want him to. He was trying to fight the now natural instinct of wanting to keep the detective for himself, all the time.
*Violet Scott [Egan's wife] and Jess Walden are sisters. Casting for Violet Scott is Olivia Munn.
“Quite attractive, you on that bike. Suiting.”
Jane winked and gave a playful turn. She was wearing a teal, striped sweater and khakis. “Well, thank you.”
“Come on, John.” Sherlock was up and out. John tucked his gun into the back of his trousers and followed him into the darkness.
Sherlock’s arm shot into the air, hailing a cabbie. “Home again, home again,” he whispered.
“Brilliant..." John breathed. "Right. Yes. Well, it was a pleasure meeting you, Sherlock Holmes. I’ll let you return to your vent session. Enjoy your evening.” John stepped outside into the hall and made his way for the doors to the building.
John looked at her in disbelief. “Other hobbies? More than owning a dance company, composing music, and dancing?”
“I can’t believe it’s already Christmas Eve.”
“Why did you lie?” He felt anger pooling in the back of his mind, and tried to dismiss it.
“So what did you think of the show, John?”
Kirsten shut the door behind her and Jane plopped down in the seat across from John. He laughed as he watched her booted feet appear in the seat next to his. She relaxed into the chair.
He’d had no doubt in his mind that Sherlock might be a force to be reckoned with. He’d entertained thoughts of sex with him; most of them seemed unrealistic. Sherlock as the aggressor, strong and hard and a fucking oncoming storm. But as the dancing progressed, as John became more and more turned on by being used as a source of friction, a location of pleasure, those ideas became more tangible. Sherlock was a perfect duality: all honesty, generosity, and devotion and then, on the other side, ferocity, confidence, and adventure. The man was equilibrium. While John bit his lip, fingers digging into the flesh and denim of Sherlock’s thighs, he wondered where he would fit in the balance. He closed his eyes, redirecting the lack of sense to enhance all his others, and the smallest moan left his mouth as Sherlock clawed down his chest. Sherlock pushed John away and pulled him back, John’s back to Sherlock’s chest, and all coherencies evaporated at the fantastic hardness now grinding against John’s arse and thigh. Sherlock placed his left arm over John’s shoulder, John’s hand finding his and intertwining the fingers, gripping until the flesh turned mottled and pale, and Sherlock’s right hand dug sharply into John’s right hip. The gesture was claiming, possessive, undeniably territorial.
John sat up straight on the couch. He exhaled the stale air he had been holding in his lungs and felt the prick of tears well in his eyes. He stood slowly, set his mug down on the water-ring ridden coffee table, and walked to where Sherlock was standing in the kitchen. The chemist would not make eye contact with him. He was staring at one of the chipped tiles in the floor. John could see shame in Sherlock’s body language; he knew this man never revealed how he felt to anyone. The blonde pulled the cup from Sherlock’s hand and set it on the counter behind him, and carefully wrapped his arms around tall man’s middle. He felt Sherlock stiffen, but didn’t care. John had never been more wrong. It wasn’t that Sherlock believed him to be inadequate. Holmes was mad because he believed John should have better. John sobbed in Sherlock’s dressing robe. He felt a strong, cold hand wrap around his shoulders and the other pressed John’s head further into his chest. John felt more terrified than ever of the application he just submitted, and hoped there was a glitch in the system, or that someone would deem him unworthy of Queen and Country. They stood there a while, Sherlock holding him tight and John shuddering through fits of sobbing. “I’m so sorry, Sherlock,” he finally managed. “I could never do what you do. I am obviously quite horrible at deducing things of importance.”
“I know, love. I’m just reminding you. New experience warrants a new set of expectations. Or rather, maybe no expectations?”
“Do you own any Bond movies?”
...is this what John endured every time he came to the market?
Katherine started to yell, but John put on the kettle and ignored her. He pulled a single mug from the cabinet and dropped in a bag of chamomile. She stormed from the room, hair debauched and eyeliner smeared from where John had literally fucked her to tears not half an hour before. He gave a smug smile as he admired his handiwork on her neck.
“Irene.”
Sherlock raised an inquiring eyebrow and followed John’s hand into the bowl between them. “Is that so? And here I was, believing you to be a gentleman. Such a shame. You make an awfully large assumption that the feeling is reciprocated.”
John sat quietly for three beats.
John shoved his sheets to the end of the bed with a petulant kick of his legs, stretched, and made his way to his dresser. He dug around until he found a pair of cotton pyjama bottoms, slid them up over his hips, and ventured out into the kitchen. He rounded the corner to find Sherlock standing by the stove, wrapped up in one of his flannel robes. John leaned against the wall and watched him.
a case, but John wasn’t aware of that. And Sherlock did want his identity, for the most part, to remain secret where they were going. He watched John as he tensed, turning over into a defense mode he had not yet encountered. It was both terrifying and undeniably attractive.
A 300 Blackout* was pointing into John’s chest. There were more men than he could count gathered around him, yelling. His Dari was weak. “I don’t understand what you are saying.” The mouth of the gun was shoved harder into his sternum. He whimpered, trying to fight back tears.
Sherlock smirked. “I’m a chemist.”
I hope you enjoy! As always, please, leave me any thoughts or helpful criticism! Ideas are fun, too, as things are still in the process of being developed and planned!
Sherlock smiled. “Best Thai take away on this side of the city.”
Irene gave a weak and wobbling wave, and they went to find Molly and Callum to offer their congratulations and goodbyes.
As always, please leave your gorgeous thoughts! I love picking your brains, and I
“No, John. You were still there, I only had to hunt a bit to find you. Afghanistan changed you; it would change anyone. But you are still the man I knew before you left. You are the same Doctor you always have been, Time War or not.” Watson’s vision blurred instantly. Sherlock kissed John’s temple and ruffled his hair before walking to the cabinet. He retrieved two glasses and filled them with wine. John chuckled.
behind those tired eyes. He wasn’t what she needed. He knew it to be true. He wouldn’t date Jane Jesep. But he most certainly could befriend her.
“Just here, on the left!” Sherlock yelled through the whistling air and the plastic of their helmets. John signaled and parked, swinging out the kickstand and shutting the bike off. He turned to face Sherlock as he unfastened his helmet, and felt his stomach dip at the sight of Sherlock grinning obscenely, ruffling his hair in an attempt to reshape it.
“I really like him, John. I really like him a lot. He’s so kind. And such a gentlemen.”
John’s brow furrowed, his neck reddening considerably.
Sherlock ditched the blanket, prowled across the lot and met John's eyes with insane ferocity. Watson felt as though he were being hunted. Sherlock grabbed John’s face in his hands and kissed him, in the middle of the street, in front of
Sherlock stood against the wall speaking with Wesley. John smiled as he watched Sherlock’s expressions, thankful that Wesley was the one with his back to John. Sherlock lifted his drink to his lips, and in the time he tilted his head back, lifted his eyes to John over the rim of his glass. John quirked an eyebrow,
John glanced up from arranging rice on their plates to find Sherlock studying him. John thought by now the detective would be biting back laughter, but he looked perplexed and curious.
disappointment, all stitched up
“And?”
The blonde captain felt his eyebrows travel higher on his forehead. He always expected B to ask the right questions, but this was very straight-to-the-fucking-point, even for B. He scrubbed his face with his free hand, the scratch of stubble lingering against his palm. “I’m not sure I’m the one to answer that, B. She’s been alone five months.”
“My apologies. I’ll be gentler.” Sherlock stared as John deftly unwrapped the gauze to his wounds. He inspected them carefully. Most of them had started to heal. A few of the deeper slices were having a hard time, even with the stitches. John applied an alcohol doused cotton swab to the irritated areas, Sherlock hissed at that, wiped them dry and applied new ointment. “I know this may not work, but would you be comfortable leaving these exposed today? They need to breathe.”
Sherlock extended a tentative hand, cautiously eying the doctor for signals to stop. John only gave him a wicked smile. Holmes’ long, lithe fingers started at John’s sternum and ran downwards, over his sweat dampened tee shirt, the buttons of his uniform, and resting on the waistband of his bottoms. Watson raked a hand through Sherlock’s untamed curls and gave a sharp tug. The detective’s back arched at the feeling.
He watched as his teammates helped themselves to his glasses, dispersed ice and beer and spoons to stir up the Baileys or the Makers. Calm found him in the midst of their chaos. He pictured Sherlock in the middle of them, fixing a hot toddy or pouring out fifteen year scotch like the classy bastard he was. He would be quiet and polite, a comforting presence. John imagined the handsome brunette tossing him a sideways smirk at Rhys starting with three shots and Egan shaking his head as he nursed two beers all night. John grinned down at the floor, knowing Sherlock would appreciate these men. Not because of their fantastic physical skill, their ability to bust their arses when required, the undefeated title they now carried, but because of who they were to him; to John Watson.
“Watching you dance.” Callum’s voice was low and breathy. Molly felt her own stop dead in her chest. She rose to her knees.
John sat perched on a bar stool at the island in the center of the kitchen, smiling at the sizzling and popping happening on the stove in front of him. Sherlock sucked a spare bit of homemade pesto from his thumb and wiped his fingertips on the dish towel slung over his shoulder. His shirt was two buttons open rather than the normal one, his hair curling a bit more from the steam of the pasta cooking. John rested his chin in his palm and admired Sherlock as he worked.
Aisle five. Razors.
He had read Sherlock’s letter three times over. It was a particularly long one, especially for Sherlock. John had grown accustomed to being the lengthy one of the two, so this was a pleasant surprise. The detective’s words made him feel some kind of way, but John couldn’t find the proper term for it. He swished the coffee around in his mouth before swallowing it. His tongue clicked as he mulled over Sherlock’s word choices.
“Oy, it’s just a paragraph, Sherlock! It’s nothing.”
His legs were pale against the navy and green plaid, the gown significantly shorter on his tall frame. His hair was a wreck, curls on the crown of his head far more unruly than he was accustomed to, and the hair at the back of his head pressed flat and funny from sleep. John grinned as Sherlock toed open the fridge, keeping his eyes on the fried eggs in the skillet. He pulled out chives and onions, located the cutting board, and wiped the blade of a small knife clean. Sherlock reached up above his head and to the left, selected a hand thrown mug, a gift from Jane for Christmas, and poured a hot cup of coffee. Sherlock turned around and extended his arm, handing the drink to John.
. I love that you only eat when you’ve solved a case, that you admit we are a normal couple when we are the farthest thing from it, and that you come to bed with me without questions. I love the coldness of your skin, the curls at the nape of your neck and the sound of your breathing when you sleep. I love that you move around me, allowing me to be your sun, without even realizing it. You are mine, too, Sherlock. You are my sun, too.”
John clenched his jaw. He was trying to seem as indifferent as possible and was failing miserably. So he decided to take the opportunity Sherlock provided as a scapegoat.
“No one knew him, really. Don’t apologize.”
Holmes could admit what he had done in a moment was foolish. His mind had been untreated for months, and one of his infamous black moods had dug nasty, tar colored roots into his heart, spreading and touching everything and everyone that once meant something. He felt nothing and The Work had lost all its allure: it was no longer challenging. MI6 had equated to Scotland Yard, but with nicer suits and classier criminals. It’s all the same process, in the end. It was that realization that led Sherlock to up his intake, increase the ante, take his mind to an entirely new level. He had thought it would make things easier. If he was sharper, he could breeze through it all and then, when the real cases came, he would be ready. Hungry, starving even, for real work. But it had not happened that way at all.
The men yanked open their forest green lockers, tossing in their soaked towels and dirt covered cleats. Watson was making quick business of shedding his practice gear, face red and tufts of hair sticking up where salty sweat and tackle after tackle had caused it to run amuck. John stood in his black shorts, scratching his ankle with his other foot. He laced his fingers together and tugged at the back of his neck. “Damnit, Everett. I love Molly. You know I do. But it’s such short notice.”
The doctor rested Sherlock’s ankles across his right shoulder. John slowly, carefully, lovingly ran his hands along Sherlock’s ribs as he pressed inside. The brunettes eyes widened, and then fluttered closed as his head fell back into the bed, inky hair spreading out over the sheets.
rushes
The trio walked up to them, wiping their foreheads with the back of their hands or their shirts, whichever was more convenient. Sherlock gave a slow, late clap, chin nodding up and down.
Remember that.
“Yes, I nabbed it from your shelf and noticed the inscription. What’s NanoWrimo?”
“Better double up that whiskey shot of yours, Watson. It’s gonna be a rough afternoon for you. I hope you have a date lined up.” Callum plucked a Stout from the plastic band and collapsed onto the gray houndstooth couch. He kicked off his trainers and began to prop his feet onto the coffee table.
“Nope, sure haven’t. And yes. Only you, that’s why it’s been the best.” The ‘s’ carried on. John leaned forward and planted a messy kiss on Sherlock’s mouth. “You are the greatest gift I have ever received. Truly. Did you know that, Sherlock? You’re a present. A beautiful, intriguing, clever, fascinating present. I am smitten with you.” John giggled some more. His eyelids were growing heavy. Sherlock said nothing, he only stroked the side of John’s face as he faded into sleep.
John opened his eyes, and then his heart was in his ears, rattling against the ribs in his chest. “Let me OUT” is what it would say, if it could speak. Sherlock was up on one elbow, hovering over John, his eyes moving over every square inch of him. John was being memorized, recorded, saved into the hard drive of this brilliant, beautiful, mad man. John barely shook his head in awe before deciding. Fuck it.
John’s face instantly went smug. “Mad with want?” His voice was a teasing whisper.
"Well, what?" Sherlock gently pressed. John smiled sheepishly.
What is death? An ending so definite and sure, and yet so fucking impossible to face. The sermon began but Jane heard nothing save for Sam’s laugh.
Sherlock’s ears perked at the tone of his voice. Genuine concern. Pathetic. Was this guy new? Did he not understand standard procedure of reading up? Surely, if he did, he would know his patient is a coked out sociopath: unpleasant, untamed, and unrelenting. The agent looked into the doctor’s eyes, doing his best to destroy him, deduction by deduction. It worked every single time. All he needed was one, tiny character trait to pull, and he could unravel him. He could reduce Captain Watson to a trembling pile of fury and hatred. Now, where to start.
He didn’t respond, physically or verbally. Sherlock continued to watch him, a deep crease forming between his brows. At least three minutes had passed when the kettle finally began to shriek. Even then, John’s reaction was delayed, and it was as if he had been scared straight out of his skin. Almost like he had forgotten the kettle was on at all…
Playlist:
He loved that Sherlock spoke twice as fast when he was excited, the way his eyebrows launched upwards on his face and his voice changed when he tried to recreate a pompous big brother, the large, sweeping hand gestures as he finally reached the climax of the story, and his chuckle at the recollection of it all. Sherlock was an artist. He was in the traditional definition, of course, being involved in many areas of creation. But his very existence called for one to reassess how they approach each oncoming day.  At the core of his being, Sherlock’s life was a work of art. His character, his demeanor, his love and play of language and his careful interactions with everything and everyone that surrounded him opened him up for interpretation by any and all. He chose every day to be a man in search of more, never settling or succumbing to the expectations of those that believe their opinion to be of the utmost importance. He bravely faced each challenge as though he were attempting to find multiple solutions for a rather involved problem -- he experimented with vernacular, with sound, with strings and sweats and stargazing; he believed everything could be seen in a new light and could offer more than its made-purpose intended.
or have I?
xox hamishh
Sherlock immediately responded with a growl. Moving his hand from John’s now wrecked hair, Sherlock rested one on each of John’s battered knees. Sherlock pressed his silk boxers against the cotton on John’s pants, giving a tortuous grind. John’s chin fell back toward the ceiling, his palm finding the back of Sherlock’s neck, tangling in the curls at his nape, then tracing the line of Sherlock’s spine down to the pelvic bone. Watching Sherlock’s hips twist in tight circles tried John’s patience. He knew he was meant to enjoy this, to enjoy being teased, and going by his aching cock, he most certainly was. But cor, he was ready to get on with it.
Jane let her forehead drop to the table as she laughed. John made a note of her silent laugh, preciously bent halfway over and shaking with no sound. Molly was giggling into her hand, eyes squeezed shut and tears running down her cheeks. Callum chuckled, deep and warm in his chest. John looked around, wiping the few leaking tears from his own eyes. This was his family. Molly and Callum: whole, real, beautiful people who sent kindness out into the world with their every breath, and Jane. Whoever the hell she was or would be, John was thrilled to have met her. She was another ray of sunshine, and god knows he could use it. He sighed and began to stack up the dishes.
“We have a schedule, John, and I can’t keep others-“
“It’s nearly May, Sherlock, why in hell are you wearing a wool coat?” Speaking the man's name aloud felt second nature, as if John had done it all his life.
The DJ booth was massive, long and placed straddling a corner of two metal walls. A dark-skinned man with dreads was spinning behind it, one ear free of the huge headphones. His ears were gauged, a tattoo of a Vulcan greeting barely visible against the dark skin of his neck. Yes, this place was going to be just fine. The DJ spun, and the song changed. To his left, John saw three women walk into the center of a ring of people. They all looked to be early to mid-twenties, and they stood in a straight line. One of them, with long blonde curls and a young face, gave a flirtatious wiggle of her fingers to someone in their direction. John glanced around, eager to see the receiver, and chuckled to see Sherlock returning the gesture. Sherlock gave her a two fingered salute.  A brunette next to her, knitted hat pulled over her brown, frizzing waves, shot Sherlock a bird, and smiled, her tongue caught between her teeth. Their center member, dreaded and natural faced, silver hoop in her nose gleaming with each rotation of the lights, took a step forward.
Jane tapped out the last few sentences of an email. She swiped a tear from her right eye. There was a knock at the door; she groaned inwardly, not wanting human interaction on her already brief planning period. Reluctantly, she went to the door, and smiled at Dr. Phillips waving through the tiny window.
John sat in the aisle seat next to Callum, who had passed out within the first half hour of the drive. Music from all the headphones melded together, and John chuckled to himself, scrubbing his face with his hands. The puzzled look on Sherlock’s face could not, for the life of him, be eliminated from the backs of his eyelids. Those ridiculous cheekbones had not been a trick of the lighting. And Irene sat across from him, looking stunning as ever, watching both of them with an expression John just could
Sherlock cautiously approached the hospital bed. He was horribly thin, his eyes dark and so tired. He folded into himself, even whilst standing. The same fingers that addressed his stubborn, interfering hair now reached out, slowly, to touch John’s. They were cold, as always. John knew, even if he pulled from his best memories, he could not recreate that feeling in his head.
John grabbed Sherlock’s bare arm and yanked him to an emptier part of the floor. He stood in front of Sherlock, facing him. The stupidest grin was plastered on his face, he could feel it. His lips were tingling a bit from the whiskey and stout, his body warm and flushed, confidence lingering amongst Cassiopeia and the Little Dipper. He watched as Sherlock roved over his figure, paying particular attention to the ink on his arms. John closed his eyes, tilted his head to the side, and it started with a small tick in his left hand. Once he placed the beat, Sherlock was done for. John bit his lip in anticipation. He found it, gave one tug upwards on his right leg’s denim, making room to move, and stepped forward. He opened his eyes, and Sherlock’s mouth parted in response. John’s left hand pressed flat against Sherlock’s chest, and he rolled his hips forward so they were flush with Sherlock’s. He gave Sherlock hips one, lethal grind before bending back, hand finding the concrete, hips parallel with the floor. Sherlock moved his leg further between John’s knees before folding over to pin him to the floor. Each of Sherlock’s hands bracketed John’s skull, and Sherlock’s hip dipped against John’s thigh. Sherlock rolled up to his knees, then to his feet, and John crawled up Sherlock’s body, hands no longer tentative or shy. The entire warehouse was empty, as far as John was concerned. Sherlock, as always, held his undivided attention. John licked his lips, taking a step forward for Sherlock’s every step back, never more than a few centimeters from his body. They moved in a fantastic, sinuous rhythm. Unlike their first dance, it was less sex-in-clothes and so much more about their synchronicity, their ability to move jointly.
Incredibly short chapter this week, loves. I'm so sorry! I've had a brilliant fic idea dawn on me HARD this week, and I've been having so many thoughts about it that it's been a bit hard to focus on this one. Would you guys still love me if I started the other instead? I promise it will be good. I PROMISE. I've planned so much of it already.
“And I've just caught you a serial killer. More or less.”
He felt a hand on his shoulder, squeezing him tight. “Focus, John. She’s going to be fine.” Sherlock’s voice echoed in the warehouse, replacing the cold wind with warm baritone. He lifted Harry’s arm and found a series of bruises on the soft skin inside her elbow, following the lines of her veins. He looked up at Sherlock with terror in his eyes. And then his best friend was maneuvering behind Harriet, working his arms under her shoulders. “On three, we lift her.”
Sherlock squeezed the place where John’s neck met his shoulder, and the doctor placed his hand over the larger, pale one resting there. Silence nestled in comfortably between them.
*Chachi is a real woman, and she is incredible. I have already linked one of her videos here, but if you want to do a little more research on her, her name is Chachi Gonzales. She's fantastic.
“It’s... it’s fine, I just thought, you know, that you were eager to come home to me and you never mentioned anyone overseas. I didn’t know you were planning to… to… get married, or propose, or whatever, to someone I had not even heard of. And then I had your letters… I was just horribly confused as to why you would write those things to me when you had someone else.”
“Er, if it helps, I’m uh. I’m bisexual?” Wesley offered quietly, and began wringing his hands nervously. “And uh, Sherlock’s gorgeous, mate. Really.” John’s eyes found Wesley’s instantaneously. He had not expected a simultaneous confession. He conveyed his thanks for Wesley’s bravery as best he could.
John shut the refrigerator door and winked at Sherlock. He popped open a ginger ale and joined his lanky counterpart on the couch. “Been doing it since I was a kid, actually. It was a thing Callum and I liked. Sort of weird, maybe, but we did everything together. If one of us wanted to learn how to fish, the other researched the best bait and hook. If one of us needed to figure out how to make eggs without them burning straight to the pan, the other went through various experiments to help sort it out: spray, margarine, butter, low heat, high heat. I was fascinated with break dancing, and so I practiced. Looked into it. Met a few people. I showed Callum one afternoon, in secondary school. We were getting ready for rugby practice.”
Sherlock’s hand cupped the side of John’s face. He was being incredibly affectionate, and while John wasn’t complaining in the slightest, it was still...odd. “Would you like to take a trip with me?”
The passerby of Kandahar were blank faced. The children carried weapons far more fearsome than Watson’s own. He eyed them cautiously. Kids eight years of age propped semi-automatic machine guns over their frail, tiny shoulders. John had no idea when or how things would escalate in this life-sucking city, but he knew when they did, it would not go well. The dust shifted with every footstep. Everything was covered in it; the filthy powder was inescapable. One thing was certain: there was no sign of real life here, only empty shells of humans. John nervously checked the magazine of his gun and tucked it safely in the back of his pants. The weight calmed him; it felt familiar. Familiarity had become a danger to John. It served as a distraction; it was an idea so foreign and far away. He missed the second hand smoke from Sherlock’s careless habit. Missed lending a lighter to those lithe fingers. What John Watson would give to trace the jaw line of the chemist’s face. He would give anything. Anything at all.
Sherlock reached back and dug his mobile out of his coat pocket.
"They wouldn't let me see her. It wasn't until the next day they showed me the body. Her hair had turned scarlet. The back of her skull was just..."
John heard a rap at his door. He opened it wide and Sherlock swept in, coat and all. John glanced out the entrance into the rain-soaked road and saw a black car parked on the curb.
Jane’s eyes got a bit bigger on her face. “Wait. You were there until almost four and you just snogged?”
He was milder, John concluded. Subdued. Of course, John had almost died, and now his father was, in fact, dead. He supposed that being subdued in a situation like this would have been suiting. He stepped farther into the flat. It felt like Sherlock. Cluttered, papers pinned to the wall, the furniture was worn in and looked well loved, the kitchen table was full of beakers and test tubes. Two windows let sunlight dance in long panels across the rug and a desk, revealing precious dust particles, floating along.
The violin found its home in its stand and Sherlock trotted down the short staircase to the auditory seating. He took his place next to John in the third row as he watched the medical student remove his binders and notes and textbooks. John glanced up and nodded at his presence. “You can keep rehearsing, if you want. You know I don’t mind listening.”
“Harry? The fuck are you calling me at three am?”
I am the one that saved you
“Sherlock, this place is perfect for you.”
They danced together in a slow circling waltz. John could hear Sherlock's heart beating away, steady and deep.
Everything led up to this one fixed point. John could feel it: waves crashing inside his head, drowning out all logic and sensibility. This was long past making sense. Sherlock was his best friend, anyone would be an idiot to miss that much. But the letters, the small moments in time that were once disregarded now made perfect sense, the fear of leaving this life, knowing it was the one he had wanted all along, was growing stronger every day. A life with this ridiculous man: all voice, sass and cheekbone. And it was glorious. The past two weeks and three days had been tumultuous and uncharted, but John thought of Sherlock lazily sprawled on the couch, running his hands through John's sandy salt and pepper hair like it was second nature. Holmes had become unflinching at the idea of sentiment.
Understood. Just for tonight, I think. To get it out of my system.
"Always thought if I got sorted, I'd be a Gryffindor."
“I need another soda.”
Jane hopped down from the counter and grinned.
“I certainly will. Here! Shezza, take a photo. He’ll never believe me otherwise.” Graham tossed his mobile to Sherlock, and John felt the heat rise rapidly to his neck. It was one thing, to interact with fans after the matches, or occasionally on the nights the team would go out to celebrate, but he had not expected to meet many here. Certainly not posh, seemingly wealthy ones. Usually it was young women or men, or blokes like Graham’s dad. Or Troy, the bouncer. Graham parked it next to John, wrapping an arm around his shoulders, other hand crossing his chest and pointing at John. His expression said
John slipped the ring over an elegant knuckle and Sherlock pulled John’s hand to his mouth, planting a kiss on the silver band that now rested there. And then they were given permission: Sherlock wrapped an arm around John’s back and pulled him as close as he could, ribcage to ribcage. The silver eyes were staggering and John drown in them, certain it was the best decision he had made in all his life. Fingers were at the nape of his neck, twisting their way into the wild curls, and then their mouths met. The world went white and John smelled cedar, cinnamon and Sherlock.
“Just a few minutes past midnight. How are you feeling?” He approached John and caressed the hollow of his cheek. “Good to hear you talking.”
“I do not have a history of being kind to myself, John. I have had black moods that possess me the greater part of a year, or three. I’ve done irrational things. I was not a great man before I met you.”
Sherlock was torn between chuckling and bristling. It was a loaded statement, and he knew what Watson meant: you’re too good for this life, aren’t you, Mr. Holmes? You aren’t a fighter for others, are you, Mr. Holmes? You couldn’t live this way for years at a time, could you, Mr. Holmes? You’re a selfish, spoiled bastard, aren’t you, Mr. Holmes? Sherlock felt a heat find his cheeks. Well. That was completely unfamiliar. He was embarrassed. God only knows what of.

Sherlock stared at him, face absent of taunt or humor. “Charcoal.”
isn’t silly. Just the fact that I used to fancy myself a writer is. It’s a month long… oh, I dunno, program, or plan, sort of, to help you write a fifty thousand word novel. They give you planning materials, daily suggestions, online forums with other writers. Lots of resources to help. I’ve done it twice. It was a good bit of fun.”
John Watson had turned his chin, had darkened his eyes, pulled out that gorgeous, commanding, confident voice and Sherlock lost every logical thought in his head. It was like they dissolved and all the atoms of the previous ideas collected into one, throbbing
Inspiration for John's Beat Boy
Sherlock was trying to talk himself out of the absurd physical impulses he was experiencing. One was particularly bothersome, as it wouldn’t go away: he desperately wanted to crawl into John’s lap, right there in the back of the cab, and grind against those perfect hips. Sherlock moved his eyes up to John’s face; he was staring out the window, licking his lips.
Those elegant hands left John's upper body and instead traced the length of John's legs. They started on the tops of his feet, following the lines of his shins, caressing the scuffs, knots and scars of his battered knees, lovingly kneading the strong muscle of his thighs until they came to rest at the junction of his hips. Thumbs ghosted across the pale, unseen flesh of John Watson, the men’s mouths stealing the tiny sounds that escaped their lips. Sherlock gave a gentle rock into John’s hips, moaning softly at the friction, his fingers grasping firmer into the skin of John’s back. He pulled John on top of his thighs, wrapping his arms around John’s entirety, pressing their chests together, their hips, their insistent and eager erections, Sherlock’s mouth open on John’s neck. John clutched Sherlock, one arm around his neck, the other cradling the back of Sherlock’s skull, holding him as though he were something divine and unattainable, something that could evaporate into thin air if he didn’t hold him tight enough, close enough, strong enough. John’s eyes were tightly closed, eyebrows pitched up, the pulse point at his neck thrumming rapidly, mouth slack, hips rolling into Sherlock’s. Sherlock sank forward, resting John on his back. He kissed John slowly, first on his lips, savoring that John was nearly too wrecked to engage. He kissed his ear, first the shell, then a line from the tender skin beneath it to the rise of his clavicle. His hands joined his mouth, trailing delicately down John’s sides, following the glistening aftermath of Sherlock’s lips.
“Indeed. Recording your data, John. Fascinating.”
“Yes, one of sorts. Firstly, don’t call me by my name. Tonight, I’m Shezza.”
Captain John H. Watson fell onto his cot, shirtless and sweating. The sun was starting to set, but the Middle Eastern heat would linger until darkness fell. He thumbed the corner of the well-worn postcard mindlessly, and traced the cityscape of London with his finger. It felt like ages since he had last been home. He missed the city, missed the masses of people (or rather, feeling safe amongst a mass of people), missed take away and tea and proper shampoo. He missed the rain. He missed him, too.
He fisted his hair, finally allowing the frustration to seize him. “This is absurd. I can always land my en Rond. Always.”
“No ma’am, I don’t do parents.”
“You’re the only one that thinks so,” Callum quipped. John gave him a playful shove where he sat on the floor next to him.
