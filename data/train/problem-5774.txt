"He's right." Wade nodded. "If his goal is to hurt Mr. Stark, here...then he needs to hurt Peter. They had his suit, they know Peter's strong, they say they've been watching. They know he can kick ass...so they needed to give him a reason not to fight. Maggie is their leverage against him... Peter is their leverage against Tony." Wade nodded. "They can't kill Maggie or Peter will fight. They can't kill Peter until they feel they've made Tony suffer enough. The only problem...is we don't know how much these people are willing to escalate..."
"Okay. I'm going to try to figure out why JARVIS can't find you. Are you going to be safe or do I need to send someone from the A-team?"
"I'm totally respectable." Wade protested, feigning hurt, but he knew it was true. Maggie was a good kid...there were some things that a Anti-Hero Merc couldn't give a good kid. "But...she needs someone stable in her life. A trustable male influence, not someone who's...well, me. If he hurts her in any way I'll kill him though." There were still pieces of Maggie's step-father that no one could find. And Wade didn't care what line Strange crossed. Could be as simple as making her a food she didn't like, he'd beat the shit out of the magical doctor.
She nodded her head. "Even something as stupid as someone getting a papercut...I sort of get that feeling, that visual. It was a lot when I first started adjusting."
He helped her stand and walk to the sink. She looked dizzy, but he left her to wash up and brush her teeth in private. He went to the living room and shut down all the lights, even unplugging the TV, so the small pinprick of light in the bottom corner wasn't on. The Cloak of Levitation floated around...looking concerned as it could. "She doesn't feel well."
"Strange, she just had major surgery. She needs to be in a hospital. With medicine and monitoring and people to help if shit hits the fan. You know that."
"Just her phone. She has a watch, but it wouldn't be trackable. The thing's almost thirty years old, it was her dad's." Wade said.
"I think of it as an undercover mission." Bruce said with a shrug. He, of all of them, seemed the most calm about it. Steve appreciated it.
It took a solid second before the applause started, as if no one wanted to break the moment. The man, likely Maggie's father, let out a loud woot again, so Tony joined him. It had been absolutely beautiful and an homage to the struggles they'd been through. Peter'd lost his family, tried to make it on his own, and eventually found a support system, a family that could lift him when he stumbled.
Strange didn't know what that meant. "Hey, sweetie. This is Christine. She's a friend of mine and one of the best doctors you could ever hope for. You're safe with her. I have to go for a moment, but I'll be back."
"This baby can power an average household for a year cleanly for less than what it costs to feed a family of five for a month. That's what. Though...factor in extras like swimming pools and constant A/C like in desert regions and it's a little less time, but yeah."
"Nice one, kid. You separated us. Good. You really are starting to use your head." Steve grinned at him.
"A block away from his school. In an alleyway. He hasn't moved in four hours. Would you like coordinates?"
Maggie shrugged. "Didn't know him. I met the lady who was sorceress supreme before him. She and I stumbled upon each other. She was there when I used my powers for the first time. I was...maybe six or seven? It blurs. Anyway...after my whole fiasco and Wade got me out. I went to my special school and...somewhere in there she was training Strange...told him about me. When I came back to New York, he found me."
"You call Wong 'Beyoncé.' Don't even get started with me." Maggie said and made the mistake of looking down. Strange was removing a piece of gauze and it was soaked in blood. "Ugh."
Peter swung across the city and found himself at the church. Sitting in the bell tower was nice, somehow. Familiar. He still felt angry, pissed at Tony, but there was a sadness and fear there too. What if he'd done something wrong? What if he'd messed up? What if Tony didn't want him around at all anymore? At least the steeple had a safe place still...just in case.
"I'm glad you're okay too." Peter curled a little closer. "I tried to stay more on the defensive with Stane. I know you didn't want me fighting him alone, but I had to keep him away from you."
Vanessa knocked on the door. She hadn't been here before, but she already felt out of place. That feeling grew when a man in robes opened the door. "Are you Beyoncé?"
Peter dropped into the sewer. He closed his eyes and focused. He didn't feel anything near him. He needed to get through this. Needed to find some place where he'd be safe. The church would be safe. The baddie hadn't seemed to know about that place. He needed to get these chains off too. They were too tight for him to dislocate his joints and slip free. He'd have to find some sort of tool to get them off. Or find a way to hack the electronic locks. Shit. What if there were trackers in them? He needed to get these things off ASAP.
Peter nodded. It was true. Going out angry wasn't safe. He probably had been overreacting. His dad obviously loved him, he'd probably even come down to the lower labs just to make sure he was okay. Yeah, Tony'd been mean, but he'd also broken bones, hit his head, and been dealing with a terrorist running his company, not to mention he'd recently adopted Peter and gotten engaged, the man obviously was under stress. Peter knew that and...maybe he'd just taken it too personally. Peter'd lashed out before and regretted it. Maybe that was all it was. Two people under stress lashing out. "I'm sorry."
He nodded and turned. "Listen...the future isn't set in stone. It changes, it morphs. Don't be afraid of it, Margaret."
Mild violence. Was going to go into more detail...but honestly I didn't have the energy for it. Let's just say Beck lasted a very long time before his end. Yeah, the line from Deadpool "Like to see Captain America do that." inspired the anger in our Steve.
"I'm all about compliance." Peter raised his hands, glad his webshooters weren't showing. If this wasn't about spiderman he didn't want to out his identity. "But I'd really like to know what's up."
Attached was a picture of Peter's suit. Gray and burgundy, as he and Ned had decided. One with a black tie, one with a white tie, one with a grey tie, and one was tie-less, two buttons undone.
"So you mean to tell me, that you knew who Iron Man was and you didn't tell us?" Clint asked. "I'm shocked. No, wait I'm not, because you're banging him."
"Aw, that was nice. But you already look out for me all the time at home. You don't have to follow me around out here." Peter loved JARVIS. He wasn't sure anyone else could claim to have an electronic friend, but JARVIS was a friend to him. Peter didn't like asking JARVIS for too much. The AI was already responsible for so much.
"I'll go get the morons." Strange walked away from her. Peter noticed his hands were trembling. He returned with Wade and Vanessa.
"Your approach doesn't work, Obadiah. You can't just bully him into giving you what you want. The kid won't know the difference, of course, but Stark will. And, I know from my little experiment, that the boy talks to Stark outside of his internship. That means that Stark cares for the kid, for one, and for another, it means that Stark is watching him. So, if we try to force the kid into something, Stark'll notice. But...become friends with him, play the longer game, maybe even make him angry at Stark a little. It doesn't matter. Once the kid trusts me, I'll get what you need out of him. You can have what you want and then I'll get what I want."
"I don't have to talk to dance. I get to keep moving and I don't have to look at people. And the lights are usually bright enough that I can't see most of them anyway." Maggie shrugged. "I don't...really notice the crowd anymore when I dance. It's usually just me and the music."
Dr. Strange froze and lifted his hands. He didn't want to. He wanted to grab her, hold her close. How was she standing? His eyes searched her for injuries. There were cuts and bruises. He could tell some of her hair had been pulled out. There was blood in her hair at her left temple. They must have hit her head and her skull didn't look...right, like the shape was wrong. His mind spun at the possible damage done to her brain. There were dark handprints around her throat. He was furious. He wanted to help, to help her feel better, to make everything right, to keep her safe, to fix everything. And he wanted to destroy whoever had hurt her. "I won't move."
"Well...you were reading bedtime stories and we got to listen so... Honey, you've missed bedtime stories."
"I'm sorry, love. I'm sorry. I've got you, bambino." Tony promised. It was all he could do. He couldn't fix PTSD. Couldn't stop the sadness or anything. He could only be there and hold his kid. "You, me, Steve. Cuddle session. Yeah?"
"Vanessa." Maggie blushed. Her eyes widened further when Peter and Steve both blushed. "Jesus, can you NOT for once? I'm sitting with two enhanced people at the moment."
She let go once she was balanced on her feet. Like her, she knew he had a sore spot about touch...though for very different reasons. He likely felt pain when gripping things. "Any way you could 'woosh' me a toothbrush?"
"More important than protecting the sanctum from intruders. Thanks for the help, Wong." Dr. Strange snorted.
"Why didn't she fight or run away? She was fast, she could have gotten away, right?" Nat asked then frowned. "We can't know though...I mean she wasn't taken from here...they got her somewhere else."
"All of my dreams have come true, Dr. Strange. What if this one does too? Do... I make them happen because I know about them? A self-fulfilling prophecy..."
"Thanks, Nat." Peter grinned at her, then frowned. He looked at Tony and grabbed his phone, sending Tony a text.
"Come on! It's not fair that you can ship me off to a different side of the planet out of the blue during our spars! I bet I could use it! It would totally make things more fair!"
Peter explained the first time he'd seen not-Tony. The argument they'd had. "It really pissed me off...and I told not-you I was at a six and not-you ignored it. It really made me feel...bad, so I went patrolling."
"He's good though, right? Real good in the sack? Because the man's broken my bones. And if I gotta deal with broken bones, someone had better be getting boned real good."
Almost all fluff. Lots of Deadpool 2 references that I had fun with. If you've seen it, you might even laugh a bit. I don't know how to write dancing things, but I've seen some really cool dances in my time. I did some combining of styles, but whatever. Anyways, hope you like it. I'm going to go collapse and try not to let my anxiety drown me. My brain is just super hyperactive at the moment. Kinda hard to focus, actually.
Maggie felt gentle fingers find her ribs and his other hand on her back. With gentle prods and shifts, she felt him pull her. She tensed.
"Don't let go...I don't know what's real anymore. Don't let go of me. Please. Please." She pleaded and her hands gripped at his robe, tightly.
"We'll be here, when you're put under and when you wake up and all the time between." Steve promised.
"I'm...okay." He shrugged. "It's difficult to feel normal there. You and Lizzy treat me normal but... I don't know. I don't like feeling like people want to use me, you know?"
"That's alright. You're about half-way through. So I'll get you on one more round of pain meds. It should last you most the way to healing. As soon as the other two bozos wake up, you're all free to go."
Peter hugged him again. "He's gonna be okay." Peter winced at an awful sound that came from the OR. His nose wrinkled. He hated hospitals.
"I want you to scream. Often enough and loud enough for Itsy Bitsy to know what I'm willing to do to keep him in line. If you're good and do what you're told, it'll only hurt a little bit."
Peter could tell part of that had come from the press conference Nat and Clint had held. They'd been very clear that there would be no discussion about Peter, topped with very thinly veiled threats. They'd made no such threats with Steve and Tony, but they'd made it very clear that the family were to be left alone until they were ready to go speak up.
Maggie knew that look, because people had been giving it to her her whole life. Everyone treated her like an idiot. She didn't know why she was getting it this time though, she hadn't failed a test or anything, right? "Is something else wrong? Did something else go bad? Like infection or sepsis or something?"
"But wait...that means... You were doing all that when you were on the...at the church? But that means." Ned's brow furrowed as if he were doing intense math. "No wonder you looked so small...the amount of calories..."
"'m home." Maggie walked into the kitchen. There were chimichangas in the fridge. She chuckled and dug around them, grabbing ingredients to make herself a quick soup.
Peter froze. Beck? No. There was no way. Beck was too nice. How could he be the nice, friendly mentor and the guy who'd sliced off fingers... Actually...that made sense. "He was in the lab with me, when Not-Tony first showed up. He's had access to me from the start of my internship almost." Peter whispered.
"Yeah." Peter nodded. He was going to avoid his project for a little bit. He didn't feel unsafe, but he wasn't going to put his ideas out there willy-nilly. He felt like he was always being watched now, maybe it was just his nerves, or just the situation in general, but his spidersense was a constant dull hum, just a constant reminder that danger was around him, always. In fact, the only time he felt fine was when he was home or patrolling. That was a little tiresome.
"Fair warning, if you don't want to feel sick, don't watch the kid eat. He can pack it in." Tony shook his head.
"The silver suit isn't the same. It isn't protected against those kinds of things. You can overload the power source if you hit him with lightning. Tell Thor to aim for the chestplate."
"Caught him trying to break into a lab a few miles from here. May have pissed him off." Maggie shrugged, then winced in pain.
"Yeah. I just gotta make sure it's you two." Peter whispered. "I know when it's you now, Dad. But...what if they try it with Papa? I mean...the fight aside, Oscar performance."
"That was me, Miss Wilson." JARVIS said. "I scan every person who enters the building so I can assess for any possible hidden weapons. I have your measurements."
Tony and Steve sat next to each other by Peter's bed. Steve had changed in the bathroom and Strange handed him a beanie when he'd asked for a hat. Maggie didn't look like she'd wake up any time soon, but after what she'd been through, he was going to do everything he could to make sure not to freak her out...but he wasn't going to leave Peter.
"Alright. Thank you for sending along that file and the meds. Never worked on an enhanced before... Um he's on antibiotics. He has a mostly healed bullet wound that got infected. Three missing fingers...partially healed. The bruises and cuts were healing while I worked they'll be gone soon... Dehydration is a problem. And by the looks of it malnutrition." She held up a folder. "I did the charting."
"Oh, just call me Vanessa or Nes, kiddo." She waved him off. "Thanks for helping her out. We all owe you guys one."
Beck looked at the script and frowned. It was alright, but it could use some punching up. He liked the wording...but there was something missing. That gut punch. He wanted Tony to know dread. Horror. Terror.
"I know you don't like this place, kid. How about you head on up to bed, get some rest. I'm okay, promise." Tony smiled and reached out, ruffling his hair again. "Thanks for sticking with me, kid."
"Maggie...I know why you pack light. You always do that. Everywhere you go. Like you're afraid to outstay your welcome, afraid you'll have to go again." Vanessa rolled her eyes. "So, I'm going to help you pack, but we'll make sure you got stuff here too, for when you visit. Okay?"
Dr. Strange wasn't sure that was a typical teenaged girl's point of view, but he went along with it. "Alright. This way, living quarters are this way."
"Sh, hey, it's okay." He soothed. He brushed a shaky hand across he cheek to get rid of the tear there.
Strange caught her and shifted her around, keeping her head propped up and turned so the hurt side wouldn't hit anything. His arms wrapped around her as her head settled against his chest. "Okay?"
His spidersense went off. He swung his hands and felt some sort of metal crush under him. He opened his eyes and looked down. A drone? Crushed in his hands. How hadn't he seen it before? He slammed his eyes shut again. With his eyes closed, he could sense more things coming. Had they been invisible that whole time? Illusions to make him question reality...to torture him? He ran and crawled up the wall. With his eyes closed, he could better focus away from the illusions. There was a window there. He shattered the glass and found bars on the other side. He heard gunshots and felt one hit his shoulder as he bent the bars and dropped. He didn't have his webshooters. He'd have to run.
"Mask has all the capabilities a phone would...and more, because I'll fully admit I'm extra." Tony said. "Don't want a kid running around without having some sort of safety net."
"That's a good mindset, but be cautious. Press can make your life a living hell. Best to maintain at least a semi-neutral place with them." Tony sighed. "Doesn't matter. The facts will come out soon."
Maggie'd sent him a text to send congratulations, along with a picture of Kamar-Taj, just to show that she was safe and sound. Then she'd explained she wasn't going to be allowed to talk for a while. Something about focus. Peter didn't really understand. He'd started going back to dance and he missed seeing her there. Sometimes he even swung through Brooklyn, hoping to keep it safe for her while she was gone...or at least as safe as he could manage.
Peter glanced over and saw her texting 'Dr. Dad'. His contact picture was...weird. Peter would describe the doctor as stern, almost cold (not in a mean way, just sort of distant, above others), borderline stoic, and sarcastic. When he interacted with people, he came across as the boss in every room he entered, sort of how Peter's Dad acted. A sort of confidence that bordered on arrogance. Peter'd only ever seen that stern personality relax around Maggie. But the picture on the phone was of a child-version of Maggie sitting on his shoulders, her tiny hands in his hair. Dr. Strange had a huge, happy grin on his face as he looked up at Maggie like she was his whole world. Younger Maggie was looking down at him too, laughing.
Peter stopped spinning and froze on the spot, staring at Maggie. The lights faded, leaving Peter in the spotlight, dressed in all dark grey. Maggie disappeared from view in the sudden darkness.
Then he saw the floating wizard guy move his hands. Green light filled the air. The fires went out, the buildings put themselves together. Everything shifted back to normal.
All of his things were gone, except for some of the lights. He was glad it was late spring, he wouldn't freeze, but he wished he'd left a pillow. He curled up away from the leaky part of the ceiling and curled into a ball. He needed some rest. He just needed to close his eyes for a little bit, then he could go get help. Maybe Pastor Aaron would help him.
"No. Okay. Well, I spent hours in surgery piecing her skull together like a puzzle and pulling pieces of bone from her brain. And let me tell you, she's worked night and day for over a year to get herself back to normal. She's done it. Me and her, lots of rehab for the past year. But you know what you can't stop? Migraines. And she has horrible ones. Good news is she has a medication that can help them from getting too bad. She should always have that medication on her person. She isn't going to give it to anyone else. She knows better, because she's a teenager who understands she needs to take her own medicine. I've looked it up, schools are allowed to know if a student has medication, but you're not allowed to take them. In fact, you know it's illegal to have possession of medications that aren't yours?"
Peter sighed and shook his hands out. He left his room and looked at his dad with wide eyes. His dad was also wearing gray and burgundy. A silent cue to people that they were on the same team. Steve was wearing a dark blue suit with a burgundy tie. "You're both with me."
Maggie could see the slight smirk Wong shot toward her. "He lives for it." Maggie grinned, knowing Strange absolutely hated her and Wong's games.
She closed her eyes tightly once she regained her breath and dropped to the floor. "I'm sorry. I'm sorry."
"That's different you know?" Peter shrugged as he began to read the lines of code. "It's not like I'm trying to make... I dunno, nanotech or something like that. That's like hardcore engineering. I'm really just making a glorified battery is all."
"Oh, speaking of, I've been struggling with some of the slower ballet moves. My brain keeps shutting down on me. Would you be able to help me? Balance is your thing."
"It's okay, I like stubborn girls." Wade grinned. He stepped up and wrapped his arms around Maggie, pulling her into a hug. "Alright love, come back a bona fide badass, alright?"
Maggie laughed and shook her head. She grabbed her phone and picked her jazz playlist, turned on shuffle, and got to dancing.
Peter rolled his eyes. "Trying to teach Papa some moves. He's sorta getting it." They agreed to surprise Tony for the wedding. So they downplayed any and all progress on Steve's part, just to add to the surprise.
"MAGGIE!" Hands landed on her shoulders and squeezed. "It's not happening. It's just a vision. It's not fact."
She stood and stretched. "We got time for one more run through. Get your head in the game, Parker. Let's get it right this time. If you smack into me one more time, I'll step on your toes in retribution."
Poor kid didn't deserve what was coming. But...Beck supposed he had some time. A little more time to plan it out perfectly.
Maggie was silent for a moment. "That...doesn't feel right. Alright though. I'm glad everything's cool."
"'Pretty sure' doesn't work. We raid this place and he's not there...they'll move him again. We'll lose him." Steve's voice came back.
Peter reached out for her, allowing her to choose to take his hand. She did and he shot a web upward. He swung them both up to the next building. "Okay, so I'm guessing your reach with that staff doesn't work great with this guy."
Peter's eyes widened and tears fell from his eyes. "Maggie?" That had all been real? She'd really been trapped in that hell with him? He'd left her... That was his fault. He'd LEFT her.
There were literal pictures of his speech on his power cell. He'd literally been on the news. Peter rolled his eyes and collected his books so they wouldn't get soaked on the wet ground. God, his stubs hurt. He wondered if that part ever got better. It had been just over a year.
The food smelled amazing. She couldn't help but stop a couple times to smell it. She wasn't really used to home cooked meals. She hadn't had them really since she was little. Occasionally she tried her hand at cooking, but never anything fancy. Take out and frozen meals could only be consumed so often. She didn't realize how hungry she was. She went back to the play.
Sure, there was a doctor down the hall that she could ask, but... maybe research first. She frowned and opened her laptop doing a search. Her eyes widened and she felt...mixed. On the one hand, she'd always thought she was broken somehow. Girls and boys at school and dance had been whispering and giggling about sex since middle school. Girl talked all about things they thought and felt in the locker rooms. Maggie'd just assumed she couldn't have those feelings like her peers. That her abuser had been right, that she was broken because she couldn't feel those things.
He grabbed her by her hair. "You'll change your mind. We're gonna have a lot of fun, Magnolia." He slammed her head against the wall. There was a wet cracking sound. He got up and left.
Strange felt the shift in Maggie's body, the way she was cringing. He shifted them both to the bathroom in a blink. Maggie must have realized that because she collapsed immediately. He barely got her hair out of her face before she threw up. His chest ached for her. He rubbed her back gently with his free hand. "It's okay, get it out, sweetie." This wasn't good. They'd let her have a headache for far too long. She was very good about knowing when these headaches were coming. But once they got this bad...she wouldn't be able to take her medicine without throwing it right back up. He already didn't like her school, at all.
"Yeah. That's always good. You said you and Dr. Dad were doing some reading. What're you reading right now?"
Do you see me putting off plot? That's because I've been trying to write an action scene and my brain just won't compute. Bleh. Anyways! Missed you guys and this story.
"Refusing treatment at the moment. She doesn't seem comfortable. Do you know someone who might ease her mind? Help her relax?" The nurse asked. "She won't even let us look and see what's hurt. I don't know the extent of her injuries...but I don't like the look of her face...or the blood on her clothes. I don't know how much of it is hers."
The people that hurt Peter were about to have a very bad day and Clint wouldn't lose a single ounce of sleep. No one should hurt a kid, let alone two of them...and let alone his adopted nephew.
"No, that's just old-school." Peter said. "Do you know this one?" Gangnam Style was a classic, of course.
"Give me three hours." Nat said, lifting her head suddenly from the table. "I'll get it. And if I don't, I'll just need a couple more minutes than that." She pushed herself back from the table.
Strange nodded. "You have the capacity for so much, Margaret. I promise it won't be all...death and despair."
"Memory loss is normal. Don't try too hard. It's okay. Don't panic. Some things will be blurry. Don't try to force it into focus. It's okay." He gently kept rubbing her cheek. He felt her turn her head slightly toward his hand, so he put a little more pressure in the touch so she could feel his scars, in case she was trying to make sure he was real.
"I don't know how much we're dealing with. Vanessa, anything on the videos or pictures you'd like me to know about?" Strange asked.
Peter's spidersense had been going off dully most of the day. Sort of the same way that it had in the Tower a few weeks earlier. He felt like he was being watched. Even at dance class something was off, because Maggie kept glancing around, trying to help him figure out where the danger was coming from. Between the two of them, they hadn't been able to figure it out. But she hadn't seen where is was coming from either, but in an awkward attempt at comfort, she told Peter that it wasn't an iminent or bad danger, she said it was 'mild' whatever that was. He turned and smiled at Ned. "Yeah, I'm good, dude."
"I'm not sure I can pull off authoritarian. I just...no. Once I do that the knives come out, or claws or...I turn into Hugh Jackman or something. All claws." Wade said. "That's only for bad guys, not you, pipsqueak."
"Not really. I'm dyslexic. My powers exacerbate it too. It's hard to focus on things. Math is easy. All the stuff with reading and writing is hard. My brain focuses more on the blank spaces than processing the letters."
"Oh...my God." Peter whispered. "Uh. Hi." JARVIS was his best boy, always...but holy shit he had his own AI.
"Clint's the only one with medical damage. Nat's bruised up. Thor's...Thor. And thankfully there was no code green, so Banner is good."
"The attack ended moments after you left. It vanished. No sightings of the thing anywhere." Wong answered, his face fell. "You look like shit."
"Still pretending that people give a damn about you, Penis?" Flash called as he walked back from the drinking fountain.
Tony turned and looked at the doctor. "How do you know that? How can you tell from another dimension?"
Tony soaked up what was on the page, because Peter had kept his dance very hush-hush. The song was one Tony had never heard of before, at least he didn't recognize it by name, it was called Ashes and apparently had an intro added to it. But then he saw the description, written by Peter.
Strange lifted an eyebrow, but turned on his TV and found the show. One episode would be all he allowed. She should rest, to heal for one, and two becuase she was a teenager who needed all the sleep possible. He watched the show and found it intriguing. "I'm not so sure about this."
"Hey, um this is Maggie. I keep doing this. But anything weird come up today? I've been getting some weird vibes, again. I don't know why though. Just a weird day training today. Anyway, if you think of anything, let me know. And I hope your presentation goes well. I gotta go, apparently we're going to be doing something reading-wise. Bleh. I guess I'll see you whenever I'm allowed to do things again. Bye."
Peter sighed and lay in his bed and decided to actually listen to Maggie's message. It must've been shortly after they'd all texted. Peter'd shut his phone off so it wouldn't interrupt him. He wanted to listen to it just in case there was something else in it aside from presentation stuff. He opened it and hit play.
"Alfredo and grilled chicken? It's fairly simple. We can even do some garlic toast and salad." Steve looked between the two.
Steve nodded. "I also don't like it when people let it happen. I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt. But this school needs to crack down on some bullies. I don't know Mr. Thompson's family does for this school that allows him to get away with shoving my son or verbally abuse him. But you as members of the education system shouldn't be bought. My kid's wellbeing, shouldn't be tossed away for whatever money Flash's parents may or may not donate."
Maggie couldn't even question what the men were talking about, because Ness squeezed her into a tight embrace. "God, you're gonna suffocate me."
"I'm sorry, I know that's a tough one. But we gotta know what your brain's doing. The eyes tell us a lot." Christine said, patting her shoulder.
"Excuse you!" Maggie elbowed him and rolled her eyes. "Ease off. Ness, can you call him off or something?"
"Great things." Tony agreed. "Karen should talk to JARVIS and give me feedback on how the suit worked, but if you think of anything you need or want, let me know."
"I tried to take his head off. He scared me. Knew who I was and everything. I'd been living with my new name and he just outed me and my past and... Anyway, we eventually talked. He's been helping me train for a while now. Wade usually handles the hand-to-hand stuff, but Strange gets my powers better, he helps with that."
Steve ran faster than he had in his life. He needed to get to Tony, to help him before the Avengers turned the fight against him. The team would think Iron Man was the real threat, not Stane. Steve needed to get there first to try to do something, to...intervene before the rest of the Avengers did.
"You will." Peter promised, nudging her side. He walked her up the stairs and held the door open for her.
"Still not as cool as upstairs though, right?" Not-Tony asked with a smug smile, one that wasn't quite right.
"She was strangled." Christine whispered, working on cutting through Maggie's shirt. "What happened to this girl?"
"Eight on school nights, nine thirty on weekends, and ten on vacations, but I can't start slacking on responsibilities or family time." Peter repeated the lecture that had been drilled into his head. He acted a bit put-out, but he liked it. He'd spent months in foster homes that didn't give a shit if he came home and months living on his own with no family to give a fuck about him. Knowing that he'd have two very pissed off parents at home if he was late, knowing that they cared that he came home for dinner, knowing that they cared that he kept his grades up and did things he cared about...knowing that they'd care if he got hurt while patrolling... That was really nice.
"I'm not judging." Strange held up his hands. He put the book down on the table in front of him and held out his hands.
"See, I studied you. All your powers are defensive. Really, you're kind of useless. I mean...good team player, but on your own...well...you're so vulnerable." He ruffled her hair.
"Run along, kid. Have fun. No more pressure on you. If any press approaches you, get me. I already told them you weren't doing any interviews. If they approach, I'll deal with them personally."
Maggie, her hair pulled up, free of glasses, wearing clothes that were hotrod red and deep blue walked onto the stage. Well, walk sounded entirely graceless. She was gliding, striding on her toes. Unlike the shadows in the backdrop. She didn't walk past the fallen Peter. She stopped and knelt down, extending her hand.
"Well, mostly Stark to suffer." The man in the fish bowl gently picked up a small saw, running a finger down the edge. "We were watching him...trying to determine the best way to hurt him. You see...the thing about Stark, is you put him in a pressure cooker and he comes out stronger. I mean, Obie sent him to get tortured and killed and the man came out a vigilante with a super-powered suit." He sighed. "Physical harm doesn't quite do it for Stark. He has very few people he genuinely cares for and loves, but he loves fiercely. I mean, once you're in, the guy just won't let go. Thus the chair. We thought...maybe torture and kill Rogers, so we had this setup to drive Stark crazy with the image..."
Maggie pulled out her phone, eyesight blurry. She put in her dad's name and started to type out a text to him. Her head was full of stabbing, horrible pain. "Maggie." The teacher held out her hand. "We have rules in this class. Give me your phone. Now."
It had been two months. Most of summer vacation was gone. Peter was slowly getting used to his three new prosthetics. They didn't stick to anything, so he'd had to retrain himself, with Nat's help, on how to land without that added security. They were metal, black with red knuckles. Tony had designed flesh covers that actually made it look like he had his whole hand. Peter didn't like them though, it left him disoriented. He'd wear them in public, but when he wasn't outside or if he was in his suit he flat out refused to wear them. He didn't know why, but they bothered him. They felt faker than the metal, which actually felt pretty real, not quite his, but real enough.
Nat chuckled. "I'll let him know you said that. He'll be flattered." Nat looked around. "Rest up, everyone. We'll finish cleaning up this mess."
"Not really. I'm tired. Things like this happen when I'm tired more than when I'm not. I just heard the wood creek...that's all it took, the rest was just a bad association. I'll be okay."
And he wanted to give Zia Pepper a hug though, because she was being a badass and handling literally EVERYTHING so Dad could be with him. And the Avengers, mostly Clint, Nat, and Bruce were keeping everyone of Steve and Tony's back with half-threats. Happy handled Peter's school, telling them he'd been out due to a rough patch, so his absences were excused and Happy had gotten his assignments from Ned. Peter wasn't sure he'd be able to be in class for finals. He might get to ask for an extension.
"Almost as weird as Doc Ock." Maggie agreed. The cape flew to her and somehow look dejected. "Weird is good. We're all freaks here." She soothed it. The cape wrapped around her happily, as if giving her a hug, then flew back to Strange's shoulders. "I can go with you. I have to get changed, but I'm totally good to go otherwise."
She didn't lift her head, it hurt too much. Then she felt a piece of paper on her desk. She slowly sat up and blinked her eyes. It took her several moments to be able to read it.
"I drink orange juice and I know things. I'm a gangster like that." She snorted and opened her eyes. "Needing a partner?"
Strange let out a chortle, then stooped when Maggie's head shifted. "Okay." Slowly, his head settled down, gently resting on her head and the sofa, closing his eyes.
When food arrived, it took Peter a few minutes to will himself to get up. As he did he looked up, out the window. Hadn't Maggie warned them about that window? He walked forward and pulled the curtain closed before walking to grab food.
"She's okay. I promise. You're going to be fine. You're safe." He soothed, grateful that Christine led him right to an empty bed. He gently set her down and looked up at Christine. "I'm helping on this."
Peter had been gone for six hours, and Beck wanted to kill him with his bare hands. The tracker in the cuffs had been found. The kid, brilliant as he was, had found a way to get them off. He was avoiding cameras. Hiding. He'd caused more trouble than he was worth, frankly. Beck sent all the footage of Peter's capture to Tony. Then he stood up and looked at his crew. "Kid's scared, doesn't know what's real and what isn't. What do you do?" He wanted to bounce ideas off them. They'd been doing this since he'd escaped. They needed to get him quickly, before he had a chance to get ahold of someone he trusted.
Christine didn't know what that was about, she was just glad that the young girl was safe where no one could hurt her.
"Tough shit, Parker, it's at MY house this week. Didn't think that one through, did ya?" Ned laughed.
"Fre'le." She pointed to her cheek. "B-blue eyes. Unassuming. Pleasen'. 'til you meet 'im. He be'ame arrogan'."
Peter tried to tear open the harness. The arms were moving toward him again, shifting directions. He couldn't find a way to get it open.
The trap door opened, but Peter's senses didn't go off, so he knew exactly who was stepping up beside him. "Hey, Valor." Aaron teased as he stepped up to the rail. "Patrolling tonight?"
"We have the best kid." Tony responded. The show started and Tony had to admit that there were a lot of talented kids out there. He had no clue how many of them could make their body move that way. It was stunning. But he wasn't there for any of them. He was sure his son's performance would be the best.
Strange looked at her. His sharp eyes softened. "Margaret, you haven't been out of surgery long. I'm not going to leave you unsupervised. Do you know what can happen if-?"
Maybe that was wishful thinking. Maggie kind of liked that Dr. Strange seemed to care about her. He...kinda...gave her dad-vibes, grumpy as he was at times, but she would NEVER say that to him. "I had a nightmare last night. School is secondary." Maggie said.
"I underestimated him the first time." Maggie rose to her feet, shaking her head. "He stabbed me in the chest last time. I thought I slowed him down, but turns out the arms could keep moving."
"We're going to get you fixed up." Steve wondered if there was a safe place for Peter to hide while the fight continued. "I'm getting you out of here."
He glanced at her head. He couldn't see it well, but he didn't like that. Numbness, the distant gaze, the blood, the aversion to light and noise, and fading consciousness...shit. He turned to Vanessa. "Come with me."
"Come on, pick up." Peter frowned. They were supposed to meet up this weekend. But Maggie wasn't answering her phone. She always answered her phone. And usually if he texted her, she'd call back. She wasn't though. Was she hurt? He frowned. "Karen, can you track a phone for me?"
The cloak of levitation tightened around her, Strange could feel it shifting, trying to comfort her. He lifted his eyes to Vanessa. "Tony mentioned nightmares coming to life?"
"When did you do that?" Tony asked, his voice broken a bit from crying. He hadn't seen it. Just saw the doctor flip through it like a flip book and put it down.
"I think I'm okay." Peter answered. He shoved his hands into his hoodie pockets and wrapped his webshooters around his wrists just in case things got really ugly.
The man who'd been responsible for his torture was above him. And two children stood between him and that enemy. Tony couldn't care less about his own trapped form. He wanted to scream, beg the kids to run, to hide, to save themselves.
Peter paused. Was Beck dead? Had his papa killed him? Why didn't Peter feel...bad? Why was part of him relieved? "Is he...?"
"Maggie!?" Then who was behind him? Peter felt a firm hand on his neck. And it wasn't Maggie behind him, but a tall man.
"Oh, don't you go sighing." Helen huffed. "If anyone here is allowed to be put out, it's me. You, your husband, his team, that all made sense. Now two kids? Seriously. KIDS?"
"It's okay. You nerds are all the same. Put something shiny in front of you and you forget you have to sleep." Happy said. "I'll take you home."
Probably the only way out. She shivered. She didn't really want to kill anyone. She focused on Peter then. Could she get him out? Could he get out on his own? That answer came quickly. He DID get out alone... She frowned. He was going to leave her. She understood though. She'd done the same thing, once, left someone behind to save herself. Of course, she hadn't known that her mother was already dead at that point, but still...she'd left someone to protect herself before. She understood it. And Peter'd have no way to tell if she was real or not, no sure way to know if she was trustworthy or real. She hadn't been screaming for a while. But she knew they were playing audio to him. They beat the shit out of her for not screaming anymore. Peter wouldn't believe she was real, she didn't fault him for that.
Beck didn't dislike Peter. In fact, the kid was brilliant and awkwardly nice to boot. He didn't want to hurt the kid...but hurting him would cut Stark deeply. THAT was something Beck wanted, more than anything.
Peter appreciated her delicacy. Even though they were isolated in their own practice room, she kept the information quiet. "Dad...actually. I'm...they adopted me."
"Let him win? Honey, do you have any idea who you're talking to? He's NEVER gonna win. See you soon, honey."
"But you ARE hurt. They're probably being cautious, in case something goes wrong. And if Strange thought you'd disrupt his life, he would have told them no when they asked him if he could 'babysit'." Peter said.
"Were you seriously going to leave without your favorite workout clothes? Jeez, kid." Vanessa worked like a whirlwind and shoved one more bag into Maggie's hands. "There, that's more reasonable. Now you won't have to do laundry every two days, dummy."
"Very funny, mister." Pepper didn't sound amused. "We could lean on the bruises. It'll help sell the illegalities Stane committed, for those who don't trust the press release and evidence we put out this morning. You being in bad shape is actually okay. As long as you don't feel too bad."
"No, but after all my studying this is the only thing it could be, considering all its other traits. Always fun to see a beast get new abilities."
"Peter and I may be playing video games." Tony chuckled. "I didn't have the dexterity for Smash, so now we're playing board games."
They both darted away as quickly as they could without making the instructor ask them what the hell they were doing. Peter took off for the alley way not far away, webbing his bag to a wall as he got dressed. By the time he was on the building, Maggie was in full Reset blue, mask over her eyes, hair pulled back. The mask was new, and hopefully would help her out if she was ever in a pinch, and had comms now too.
Her lips pressed into a hard line. Dozens of emotions flickered across her face. "Shit. Fucking Tony. 'My heart's bad' my ass." She pressed her comms back on. "Clint. Change of plan. Take out the silver suit. I just got new information."
No. It had been a trick. The silence was just something they used against him, just like the recorded screams.
"Mads Mikkelsen is a treasure, I will not hear you speak ill of him." Maggie pointed at him. "Who goes after a guy who wears tennis shoes with suits? Come on."
"I would just like to point out that I'm not the crazy one. For the first time, I'm the fucking sane one." Tony shook his head.
"That nickname's fair. Yeah, not blue. There was an incident involving a building and two assassins." She huffed and brushed off her sleeves.
"You're paranoid dad has really lost it this time." She teased good naturedly. She ruffled Peter's hair. "Stay safe, kiddo...s. That also includes you, Happy."
"I also got extra. Didn't know if you were enhanced or not. I'm used to feeding super metabolisms though."
"Hey, you did amazing." Maggie promised. "It was perfect. Our best run yet. Those happy tears or sad tears?"
There was nothing working. Dr. Strange frowned. This thing didn't make sense. They couldn't hurt it. When he tried to use the time stone, but when he did, the beast froze, but still wasn't touchable. It made no sense. It was setting the whole city on fire, but was untouchable. It didn't appear stuck between dimensions like other beasts he'd fought, but somehow it was untouchable. How did that happen? What was this thing? It wasn't in any book. Nothing. He asked the others, no one else had seen anything like that. He just wanted this to be over.
"She wouldn't let me touch her. She needs a few things stitched, but she won't let me near her. I think it's the adrenaline. She'll calm down in a few moments and we'll be able to see what she needs. Now, why haven't you taken that arm off?" She nodded to the part of the suit still left on him.
"Cool." Tony ruffled Peter's hair. "JARVIS! Drop the needle. Back in Black, please. And let's take a good look at our new upgrades, huh?"
"No joke." Peter nodded. "Thanks, by the way." Peter gestured to the line they were waiting in. Ned got them both tickets to the newest Star Wars film. Peter promised he'd get the snacks. Well, technically his Dad was getting snacks. Peter didn't want to know how much was in his 'modest bank account' that Tony had set up, but Tony made sure Peter had access to it at all times. The watch Peter had not only had Karen in it, but a panic button, a tracker, and could do touch-free payments. And apparently he had a stock portfolio to make 'passive income' and assets. Apparently Pepper and Tony had put it together, Peter knew there was something about real-estate and precious metals...but Peter had just about passed out at the number when he'd seen it. He'd never be able to use that money.
"I hate my life." Peter groaned. Couldn't anyone have a private dance-off with their friend anymore? No. Not really. Nothing was private anymore. It sort of sucked. She'd just been so down for the past couple weeks. He'd wanted to try to cheer her up. Now they were likely Memes.
Steve smiled and pulled his helmet off and sat in the chair by Peter's bed, hoping he was out of the way enough for the doctor. She didn't even seem to notice him.
Peter's spidersense freaked out. There were explosions and smoke. The building shook below them slightly, but Peter's senses were dialed to eleven. If everyone else on the block didn't feel it, it didn't matter. He could feel it. The smoke was... "That's the Tower."
"Keeping Hong Kong from burning down..." He responded, rubbing his face. "Where's...?" His eyes widened at the noise in the room. "Margaret? What's that?"
Strange took a deep breath of his own. They must've taken out their anger on her when Peter left. Or they'd wanted her to tell them where he went. "Okay. Mrs. Wilson, please go wait outside. Dr. Palmer and I will take care of her, okay?"
"When I'm better...can we work more on non-lethal take-downs and grappling? And...maybe some longer range weapons?"
"Sir is doing very well. They're setting his arm, currently. I am overseeing. If there are any updates, I'll share them." JARVIS responded.
"Dude, getting back into dance must be doing you good. Usually you'd be struggling breathing by now, and you haven't even broken a sweat." Ned observed.
"Yes, yes it is." Vanessa laughed and pulled away. "Now you're getting it." She poked her nose gently. "Knock 'em dead."
Maggie had worked really hard and passed her class. He'd wanted to congratulate her, maybe take her somewhere to celebrate. He was proud of her. She'd worked hard. That was worth rewarding. He knew how much she struggled. He wanted to encourage her. Foster that work ethic.
"Sure, sure." Peter held up his hands, then sighed and settled in a little more. "We're all okay though."
When she made it to their normal room, incense was already burning, the usual stuff. She couldn't put a label on the smell, but it was calming. Instead of the usual cushions, two armchairs were in the room. She sat down and sighed. "The usual?"
"Shit." Tony huffed, then realized someone was behind him. He whirled and held up his hands. Only to find Dr. Strange hovering across from him. Cape flowing behind him.
Peter ignored her hand and wiped his face, pushing himself up. He danced well, but not perfect, pure ballet. Meanwhile, Maggie started her own dance, more pristine, perfect in form. She kept reaching out for Peter, but Peter kept dancing away from her.
Peter piled a plate high and then went to the couch. "Wanna watch a movie so we don't have to endure him boasting about all the victories?" Peter asked Steve.
"And there are things in this building I can't see. It's weird. There's danger in directions I can't discern. That doesn't happen to me." She frowned. "Be very careful. Especially around Mr. Stane."
Maggie was sleeping soundly. She had that look, the same one she'd had when she'd fallen asleep on his shoulder during reading once. She looked at peace. Comfortable. Rested. Her curls were strewn across her pillow. Her breathing was even. No sign of any issues.
"He was here...he had to be. Where did he go?" Tony asked. It didn't look like they'd taken Peter. It looked like he'd fought and gotten away. But...where were the bad guys?
Maggie focused on the future, her breaths slow and even. She might see a way out. But every time she tried to think of a way out, she kept seeing a man, bloodied on the floor.
Maggie opened her mouth, then closed it. "It's hard to explain. It's like a spotlight shines on people. Red means danger. And I can find the source of said danger with a different shade of red. It's kinda like a thread attaches between the two things. Like, if I was about to punch you, you and I'd both look red with a sort of rope tied between us. The colors are different slightly from victim to perp...and the level of danger too...I can see that."
"No." Peter shook his head and climbed down, hiding quickly in the space as his spidersense buzzed vaguely. "I'm not safe." Were they watching? He glanced around. He needed to get out of here.
"I've never slowed something that big before. Something to be said about adrenaline, huh?" Her face pinched in pain and she cupped her head, as if overtaken by dizziness.
Steve nodded and kissed Peter's neck. "Sorry, Pete. I just...didn't want to let that man stick around."
"If someone's trying to find you or your alter ego, that's a give away. You shouldn't leave evidence so close to usual haunts."
Peter hadn't even made it to the floor when the watch started ticking at a normal pace, the green glow faded.
"Please...believe me. He was here. I don't know where he went and I don't know how. But he was HERE." She insisted, pointing to the spot again. "I know a nightmare when I have one. I know when I'm dreaming and when I'm awake."
"They are trouble. But at least they can dance." Vanessa said, then grinned. She forwarded the video to Dr. Strange.
"Mark it down on the calendar, because it's not happening again." Strange insisted before sliding closer. "You alright to talk?"
"Steve, what can I get for you tonight?" The woman called him up once the person ahead of him had their bags of takeout.
Tracy looked disappointed in herself. "Shit, maybe I should sleep more...or drink less caffeine. The stuff makes me crazy. What's your big idea?"
"Hate to break it to you, but you won't be getting your 'assisting the elderly' badge from me. Wait." She grabbed her long, wavy pony tail and pulled her hair in front of her face. "Do you see grays that I can't? I'm too young for that bullshit."
"I thought you said you could get this done, Beck. I thought you said you had it? Was I wrong to trust you? Do you know what I do to people who fail me?"
Strange looked at Peter with wide eyes. "Um...I don't know if Christine is paid enough for this." He frowned.
"She tried. The teacher took her phone. That's why I asked for your number so I could do it." Kate answered.
Steve rubbed his forehead. Peter was missing a pinky at the least. And there was the threat of more being removed from their son. He couldn't find Peter. There was nothing. Nowhere to look. But... Maybe that was the answer. He'd looked everywhere. They ALL had been looking. He hadn't heard from Strange or the Wilson's...but then again, they were probably taking care of Maggie. They'd only gotten a few updates, but if Peter's head were bashed in and he'd been in surgery, Steve wouldn't even think of leaving him, especially after his head had just been put back together. All the Avengers were looking. JARVIS was looking. Everyone was moving. What if looking was the problem?
"That's my bad. Had my settings set to video and Karen...well, she trumps all the other phones in the world." Peter paused. "Sorry, JARVIS, not you. She doesn't trump you, that was my mistake, bro."
"Stupidest thing ever... I was going down the stairs and Fat Mack jumped in front of me and I fell." Peter'd heard lots of stories about her overweight housecat being an adorable menace, but this time it obviously wasn't funny. "It was all funny until I couldn't stand up." She frowned. "I'm not supposed to put weight on it for a while."
Peter almost laughed at it, when, in a parking garage almost out of the city, Happy pulled up next to another car. Peter recognized it as Bruce's. Bruce wasn't there though, instead Pepper greeted them.
"Ugh!" Maggie banged her head against the wall. "I wasn't even in dancing shape! I WASN'T IN POINTE FOR SWAN LAKE!!! NOOOO! That's awful. I'm going to look like a noob." Maggie huffed.
Peter frowned, but nodded. "Yeah, it's just been a rough time for him. I mean, his lab did blow up not too long ago. You know? Can't blame him for being stressed." That was all true, but not the whole truth. Peter knew it was so much more. Tony had to be really stressed and everyone dealt with stress differently, like Aaron had said. "It's okay. It'll be fine."
"You're right." Maggie flew forward. She closed her eyes, took a deep breath and raised her hands slowly. Green light glowed at her gloved fingertips. The building glowed green as she held her right hand up, slowly twisting it counter-clockwise. The cracks and broken pieces of the building leapt back up, slowly going back together. The damage being undone.
"No, I'm not. It's a freakin' mess. I'm a mess. I mean, one of the most popular girls at my school asked me out. She never once looked at me before. Flash is double the asshole he used to be. Everyone just feels so different."
"Because he's a doctor and he cares about you. We know you aren't comfortable with most people, so we called for back-up, just in case." Vanessa frowned. "What's that look on your face for?"
Only problem...Nat was likely already there. And if Nat was there, so was Clint. And Thor...well, he could fly. Steve knew his odds of getting there before everyone turned on Tony was slim to none. But he had to try.
Peter was so happy when he heard repulsors. That was his Dad. He heard voices and fighting and shouts. Then, the door burst open and his dad and papa was there. "DAD!" He screamed. Then he stopped for a moment. He'd been seeing things...was this REALLY his dad?
Peter bent backward under Nat's foot. He considered taking her out right then and there, it wouldn't be difficult, her attack left her other leg wide open, easy to knock her over. But Peter's spidersense went off. He used his webs to grip the wall and slide him across the floor, narrowly missing getting hit by Steve's shield. He jumped to his feet and turned, looking at both his opponents.
"Hey, Itsy-Bitsy." Maggie landed next to him and sat at the edge of the building, holding out a platter. "Gyro platter?"
"It's gonna be fun. Most of the family will be there. Though...Zio Thor and Zio Bruce won't be. And I think Clint is going somewhere else. But it'll be a big thing. Don't know what I'm going to get everyone. That bit's stressful."
Maggie laughed. "I don't think he'd let me. But I'll try. He really likes that trick. Does it when people annoy him. It's kinda funny."
"It's the coldest winter on record. My suit has heaters, I don't think yours does." Her cringed and sat next to her.
Peter let his suit fall away and quickly got changed into some warmer clothes. He took off his prosthetics and headed into the living room.
"They're the same size again and you look like you can see the room." Vanessa said, lightly teasing...but with some seriousness there.
"It couldn't be real though. It...it couldn't be." No. Peter remembered far too well getting the call. Losing her. Going to her funeral. Seeing them bury her next to Ben. No. She couldn't have been real. Why did she seem so real? He whimpered and curled into a ball.
That was the wrong answer. Peter smiled though and pulled his phone from his pocket, dialing Steve's number.
"Mmhm. So much." Maggie felt her eyes water. Even that hurt. Why did everything hurt so much? And she felt weak, her power was nearly gone.
Then Peter heard it. Maggie was screaming. She was screaming, in pain, afraid, because of him. He went still. He couldn't get her hurt. He couldn't.
The spider-boy fell and actually landed on his feet. Strange mentally congratulated him. Most people ended up face first, especially after falling for a good few minutes.
"You have NO idea." Peter led her into the building. Once in the elevator he sighed. "JARVIS, medbay, please."
"Um, I caught a car thief. I got this kid a new ice cream from the truck when he dropped his. I helped a lady home, she was being stalked so I helped stop her stalker too. It was pretty calm. Glad it wasn't too crazy."
"Keep it easy for now. If you don't, you'll only be on light duty for longer and I'll tattle to Steve on you. Seems he's feeling really righteous and protective right now." She nodded to the TV, where the press conference had just ended.
"Where are your sexy AF parents? Especially the brown haired one. Now he's a DILF. Where's he at?" Wade asked with a grin.
Faintly a muffled, metallic voice came back through the mask. "Peachy. Look after Underoos, won't you? He's being an idiot."
Something weird crossed his face, but he schooled it before she knew what it was. "Super healing, isn't a gift you can learn. Though, I may be able to teach you...something like it. If you keep practicing." He looked back down and gently began to clean the area.
"Why wouldn't it be?" Peter laughed before heading to the living room and sitting next to Steve. Without a word, Steve wrapped an arm around him and pulled him against his side. That was nice. Peter relaxed and closed his eyes.
But really, she wasn't normally late. He considered stepping away from the routine to grab his phone out of his bag. Then the doors opened. And Isabelle was on crutches...looking really guilty.
"I never go anywhere without it." Peter said honestly. He carried that thing like it was essential to his survival. "Meet you at the top of the building?"
Peter sighed and finished his read-through. "Yeah, it's fine. I mean, I think you can clear up this section here. I think the complexity might lead to bugs further down the line. Tracy says simplicity is elegant, this part seems to be focusing on too much at once. It'd be like an off switch, you know? This one part bugs out then the whole system would be fried."
"Okay." Peter grinned and headed for the cabin. He glanced back at Tony and Steve. The two were leaning against each other, supportive. Yeah, they'd be okay.
"If you think this is hell, you're wrong. Believe me, this is only the beginning." He leaned forward into her face. "If you don't start behaving, you'll be in pieces when I'm done with you."
"I will, bambi." Tony kissed him again. "We're going to make sure that when we go home, we're all safe when that happens. No more threats hidden in the dark."
"She's sweet, headstrong, kind when she has no reason to be, driven, and clever, she's so clever. Yet...all the opposite things as well. She's a good girl. And yes, I won't pretend like I didn't get to know her because of her powers. The Ancient One was interested in her connection to the time stone. I would be lying if I didn't say I was still curious. And I know I can help her get stronger, better, in control. But she is not just her powers. It's... I want to help her. I want her to be safer out there. I want her to be able to take care of herself. I want to see her succeed. She deserves better than what she's been dealt."
Peter sighed, knowing his dad and papa didn't quite agree with him being out there at his age. He wasn't going to have the argument again. He glanced at the TV.
Peter nodded and finished writing. It wasn't perfect, but it was as good as he knew how to write. "I think I've got it."
Steve looked from the doctor to the girl, to Vanessa, then at Peter and Tony. So much hurt...caused by madmen. Steve watched Strange get up and check over Peter and all the machines hooked up to him one more time. Then he looked over Maggie and her machines. The doctor's hands shook as he fixed her baggy shirt from falling off her shoulder.
"You have the worst injuries of the lot. You first. Peter just needs pain meds and rest, and we all know he's not going to sit still if you aren't doing well."
"Ned's set to stay with us." Peter said. "Um, we're going to be a little late, so don't freak out. I'm gonna want some food." Peter muttered.
"Why would she need to go to the office for her medicine?" Strange asked, voice upset, bordering on angry. His hands though, were still gentle, trying to ease her headache.
Steve saw who was in the bed and sighed. Maggie, pale and still, compared to her normal color and constant movement. Her head was wrapped in a bandage. Bruises littered her body, the most gruesome were at her throat. She looked beaten to hell and back.
She rolled up to point easily and lifted up her left leg. Her right leg shook a little bit for a moment, but she got it under control. She bent her left leg and leaned forward. Her right foot wobbled, bad, but she managed to stay upright arching her arms to keep herself.
"Yeah, go wake up that mega nerd friend of yours and Happy." Tony patted his side. "We'll come up with something."
"No, thanks Peter." He kissed his temple. "See you in a bit. Actually...I'll have JARVIS tell you when he's in a normal room, okay?"
Peter walked into the lab and up to his desk. His prototype had been moved. He could tell. It had only been a centimeter, but it had moved. Someone had taken it. But, Peter wasn't all too upset. He'd messed with the base configuration. Even if someone figured out where he was going with it, they'd be left with a flawed power source that would cut off after two hours. Peter wasn't leaving his work done properly anywhere where someone could find it.
When that door next opened, she'd look like she always did, helpless and weak, but she wasn't, not anymore. She took a deep breath and swallowed against the wave of nausea. She prayed to God that she didn't kill this man, that she only stopped him, knocked him out. She wasn't sure she could deal with it if she killed someone...but she had to get out.
The hand shifted, wrapping in hers. "I know talking might be hard at first. Can you squeeze my hand?"
"It is ridiculous though. Maybe a super-therapist should exist. You know? I used to talk to Professor X. He was helpful. There has to be someone who wouldn't lock us up after some of the things we see." Maggie rubbed her bare hands together. "You know...back in the day, I'd probably get burned at the stake...or stoned if I told anyone what I could do."
"Hello, boys. Could you give me directions to room one-thirty-eight?" Her accent was perfect Queens, like she'd live there her whole life.
Peter laughed. "Sounds fair. I'm gonna take off. See if Queens needs anything. See ya at dance next week?"
When Vanessa walked into the living room with a bag of snacks and Maggie's prescriptions, she met Wade's eyes. "So...are we going to talk about what happened?"
"I would rather not feel the stitches, yes. So...needle good. Load me up on the good drugs. FUCK." The muscles in her leg spasmed uncontrollably at the next stab. Her eyes watered out of her control. The stab and beating she went through wasn't anywhere near this painful. Why was a needle worse than a stab?
"Well...shit." Strange whispered. The bad guy was still out there and still disguised. They hadn't found him when they'd gotten Peter...because he'd left to tie up loose ends. He took a breath. "How's Peter?"
"Sir, will not let you down if he makes it there first." This was directed at Steve and they both knew it. He'd scolded the hell out of Tony when they'd had dinner last time and Tony had been nearly an hour late because he got occupied in the lab. Steve had been a little pissed and maybe a little upset, but Peter was with Tony. And he didn't want them setting a bad example for their son, especially with everything Peter'd been through.
"We can get you food, kiddo." Tony said, then looked up at the doctor. "We can give him food? He's allowed, right?"
The man pulled the needle from her neck, then began to pat down her pockets. He slipped his hand into her back pocket. "There it is." He pulled her phone out. "That's what I needed."
Peter did feel quick relief. Even his small, shaky movements in his hand didn't hurt so much anymore.
"Oh, and there go my odds. Two on five now. And I disarmed you. Fun? Huh?" The woman asked. "Hello, Spiderman, thanks for waiting, would hate to see you bleed out...again."
It was the first official day of summer for Maggie. She was ready for it, early. She opened her door and caught herself in the mirror. Had she worn this outfit before? She couldn't remember. Something...something gave her a vague sense of danger, but she couldn't pinpoint it. "Oh, shit." She turned and went back to her room, putting on the necklace that had just...appeared one day. She really liked it. But she didn't like wearing it in the shower. She hid it under her shirt, the cool weight was comforting somehow, especially today. She didn't know why. She stepped back out and hopped down the hall while putting on her shoes.
"The little red-haired girl? Oh, see, how it works is: when you don't need something anymore...well, you don't need it. If it makes you feel any better, she didn't sell you out, we found you on our own. Her body is probably bobbing past the Brooklyn Navy Yard at this point."
"Sir, Peter has proven that whether or not someone knew he was Spiderman, he would fight smartly. It is out of character for Peter not to fight back." JARVIS commented.
Strange did NOT like that. "'I should see the other guy'? What the hell is wrong with you?" Strange folded his arms over his chest. "She's down two units of blood, minimum. The cut on her side should have been seen to when it happened. She's lucky she hasn't passed out. That's her sheer will keeping her upright. She's barely hanging on and you're going to make a joke?"
"I don't exactly have a good track record with it. Sometimes I think I'm better off with...distance."
Thor didn't think of a broom, obviously, because he jumped up and pulled Peter down. A ceiling tile came down with them, still stuck to Peter's legs. Peter, somehow, managed to right himself and not drop his plate or the pop tarts before he landed on his feet. He instantly backed into a corner, breathing hard.
Peter smiled. "Consider me warned." He nodded. He shifted down to his place, head down. "Karen, hit play, from the top." He called, knowing his phone would listen. Karen was quickly becoming his best girl.
"No, not Maria, because then Peter'd be our kid in SHIELD files. I can't trust them with that information, their security is shit. And I'm not sure Mr. Pirate would be trustable with a teenaged superhero. I don't need him trying to recruit our kid." Tony shook his head.
"Yeah, got hit by some debris trying to get back home. Hurt my ribs pretty bad." Peter answered, trying to keep his identity somewhat hidden. It actually seemed to work.
"What's left to say? These prayers ain't working anymore. Every word shot down in flames." He seemed to be getting a little more steady as if learning to dance, to live on his own. "What's left to do, with these broken pieces on the floor? I'm losing my voice, calling on you."
"I'll just uh...go." Peter took off. God in heaven, Dr. Strange was a scary dude. Peter had no idea how Maggie could stand living with that guy. Peter didn't even know the half of what he was capable of. It was fucking scary.
"And I've never seen you out of gloves before. It's weird." He retorted, grabbing a bagel and sitting at the kitchen bar.
"Vanessa, please. Sorry, I babble when I'm out of my element." She looked around and had a vague feeling that nothing in the room was safe to touch. "I'm here about Maggie."
"Mmhm." Maggie agreed. She wanted to know what happened. She still felt scrambled and she wasn't sure she'd understand or retain what he told her, but he wanted to try.
Dr. Strange gestured down a hall and she walked a step behind him. He never tried to reach out for her, but the cloak occasionally stretched out and brushed her gloved hand in a friendly way. She liked that cloak. "What do you think I can do about it?"
"That's why you call and don't text." Peter realized. "It's cool. My friend MJ really struggled when she was younger. She still has struggles sometimes, but she's super creative. I think that's a thing. A lot of crazy talented people deal with things like that."
Peter narrowed his eyes. He had to get her out. Maybe reach the panic button on his watch. He could do something.
A tear leaked from an eye as they finally shut, unable to stay awake. The last thing she knew was that there was a man hovering over her, her ears were ringing, her body was immobilized, and no one was there to help her.
Dr. Strange seemed convinced. "Give me a moment to wash up, I'll take that IV out. Then I'll woosh you back home." He handed the prescriptions to Vanessa and walked away.
"Good. You should only feel pressure." He said. "I'm going to clean it up a bit, then get it sutured, okay? If you feel any sharpness at all, stop me. And make sure you keep pressure on your side with that arm."
"It's fine. I'm fine. Everything's fine." Peter sang with a laugh. "You do know what fine means, right?"
"Get the fuck off me!" The girl screeched and fought. She nearly threw him off, but he shifted his weight over her center of gravity to keep her down. Her eyes were wide, full of terror and the gloss of tears. She fought harder, to get him off, her breath coming in frightened pants. Clint noticed her cheeks were round. That didn't make sense. A girl as trim as her didn't usually have such a round face. The girl was almost exclusively muscle, yet her face was round.
"Just citizens." Peter sighed. "Unless you're counting Spiderman." Peter snorted. The Daily Bugle hated Spiderman. They were always trying to get pictures of Spiderman, they were always blurry and just plain grainy.
"I think you're adorable, Roo." Tony ruffled his hair. "I ran the tests on that new fabric. You missed out on the Edna Mode test run and everything. Totally passed the stress tests."
Peter laughed. "You do have that going for you." He liked being around her. He actually felt like him. He didn't have to pretend anything. He could be all of him, all the good and the bad and the baggage that it included. There was nothing he had to bury or hide. Well, aside from the massive crush, but that was a give in.
Peter closed his eyes. There were going to be nightmares and horrors, but for this moment, he just wanted to rest in the safety he had with his parents, knowing the monsters were gone.
Maggie pulled back first. "By the way, what kind of asshole squishes a sandwich down flat?" She pointed to the table.
Most teens seemed to have a hard time with the Bard, he couldn't imagine trying to get through it with a learning disability on top of it. "Read it aloud."
"I've got you, I've got you." Steve hugged him awkwardly in the chair, kissing his neck. "We're...gonna find a way to get you out of this." Steve pressed his hand to his ear. "Tony, I've found him."
It was difficult. But she focused on his hand on her arm and took a few deep breaths. The real world came back. "Sorry."
Peter knew he had a fantastic family. He knew it wouldn't be held back forever, but for now, he could focus on trying to recover.
"That...was a bit more understandable." Vanessa said. She looked at Wade who already stood up, grabbing his swords.
"Me?" Peter frowned. "Ugh...just had a rough day a few days ago, still recovering." He didn't want to get into his psychological trauma acting up on him. "It's okay. I'm fine."
"I know, kid. It's okay. We're all going to be okay. I know things were messed up yesterday, but let's try to start over, yeah?" Tony offered.
"I'm still sorry. You're really talented and you should've gotten to show this dance off. Maybe at the next performance, in June? I should be okay then."
"Don't want to do that." He was eyeing paperwork on the desk. "A Jane Doe with head trauma?" He asked.
But there wasn't much speculation about Peter. There were a few articles wishing for the innocent kid's wellbeing, but not much else.
He had to, for a moment at least, so he could get around to help her. "I won't be far at all. Vanessa will be here." Strange looked at Vanessa. "Keep ahold of her. I'll be back." He said the last bit to Christine who was already sterilized and starting to work.
"No. Nuh-uh." Maggie understood him. She understood the hero thing and they both had gone through different shit growing up, but they knew similar things because of it. It was easy to talk to her. She was funny and talented and pretty and a nerd. Like such a nerd. He was pretty sure she knew more about video games than he did. "We're friends and...I don't wanna ruin that."
"Once this...big issue is over and Tony's not locked out of his own company, I think he has big plans."
"Oh..." Peter whispered. He'd never heard her talk about her past so extensively before. But he wasn't going to say he was sorry. He knew first hand that pity didn't really help. "Found family...I like that."
"They hit your head badly... You kept yourself safe with your powers which made our job really simple. It's really good." He soothed, but she could tell he'd been worried about it. His eyes were red. How bad had it been that a neurosurgeon had red eyes? "You're on some pretty big pain killers, Margaret. It's going to make you feel off."
"I'm fine." She grinned. "You were right. Round the clock torture is an idiotic move. They have no way to step it up after that." She glared at him and then kicked Not-Wade, hard...in the balls.
There are some food issues in this, Peter still is dealing with his trauma, as you all know. Sorry about the incoming angst.
"No, sir. Last I can see of Peter, he was at school. Then he left. I can confirm it was him who texted you, but after that I lost him, sir. I'm sorry."
Peter looked at Maggie. She was different than he'd ever seen her. She wore basketball shorts and a tank top. Her hair was pulled up in a mess rather than her usually meticulous bun. And she didn't have gloves on. That alone told him a lot. She did trust this...person. Whoever he was. "He rubbed at the back of his neck. Hi? Sorry about the window...and the near punch."
"Nothing you see is present." He promised in a soothing voice. He knew how jarring it was to see that which wasn't there. He made sure to try to teach her how to feel the difference between her present and all other times. "Remember to breathe. Remember to take stock of what you feel. Keeping grounded will remind you of where you really are."
"I have a choice, still my hands or do spells. One or the other. I can still my hands long enough to help you." He smiled gently. "Which makes you more comfortable? Do you want me to go get a nurse or doctor, or do you want me to do it?"
"My aunt and uncle were weird too at first...when I lost my parents. They never felt like parents to me either, even with rules and boundaries. But Tony and Steve...it felt different. It didn't mean anyone was lesser or bad...it's just that they naturally met the role better." Peter frowned. "You ever tell Strange that he...helps?"
"You're a kid. I'm not going to do what was done to me. You get to look like a kid. You get to stutter and fumble with words. I'll be there to help. I'm not leaving you up there alone. Though, it's adorable that you were practicing your presentation."
"You see my point?" Maggie raised an eyebrow. "You aren't responsible for what he did. I don't blame you for what he did. I'm glad you got out...I just wish your parents would have found you first." She glanced at his hand. "They look real."
"That's good." Tony nodded, a large smile appearing. "Neither of you look particularly stiff in the video."
Peter slid backwards. "You're not Papa. Dad he's not Papa." Peter warned. Then he looked at his Dad. Was it just him or...was the sound a little off? The metallic heartbeat was coming from the wrong spot. Like it was...being played through a speaker, not coming from the man directly. That wasn't his Dad either, was it?
"Yup. Lights are on, power's holding steady. You can let everyone know at the end of your presentation that you ran that building's power supply, okay? It's been off the grid since you set it up. Take deep breaths. Talk slow. Trust me, you will speak a lot faster than you think you are. So breathe and talk slower than you think you should."
"Okay." Maggie followed him, quietly. The cloak of levitation quickly found Maggie and gave her a happy squeeze. "Hi, Cape-y." She giggled lightly. "Hey, hey, be careful."
He could probably see the blood already, but she pointed to the three places. "It hurts to breathe."
Tony cried quietly in relief, in anger, in sadness, in mourning, in joy... It was all of it. He leaned against Steve for support and Steve leaned back against them as the both held onto Peter's arm. Across the bed they could see his left hand. Thumb and forefinger next to three wrapped stubs. The bruises on his face were fading slowly. His chest was wrapped up on his shoulder.
Upon re-reading this I felt a little weird, so explanation time. I initially wrote some training scenes with Maggie and Dr. Strange as part of some foreshadowing and they actually worked really well together character-wise. I just got this father-daughter vibe from them, so I kept writing more to discover that and I liked it so much that it's now a thing. This doesn't mean he's replacing Vanessa and Wade. But earlier in her story she already doesn't view them as parental figures, even calling them 'Wade' and 'Vanessa' rather than mom and dad or even aunt or uncle.
"Does that mean...? My identity is outed, isn't it?" Maggie huffed. She'd cross her arms if she wasn't covering her wound with one.
"Come on, big guy." Peter swung at the last minute above the street. He wondered how this fight started, but, he'd have to wait to ask that. He swung to Maggie's building and stuck to the wall, facing the man. The man launched at him with the help of his metal arms. Peter ducked under the metal arms. The bricks of the building crunched under the arms. "Damn, you've got some anger issues. Ever consider therapy?" An arm yanked out and stabbed at him. Peter ducked and caught the falling bricks with a web. "Hey! There are civvies down there. Not nice. If you won't do therapy take your anger out on me, bro." Peter pulled his knees to his chest before kicking the man, not with his full strength, but hard enough to make the man fall from the building and scramble to catch himself.
"I'm getting real tired of your family showing up here, Captain." She said flatly. "We're about to start working. I think he'll be fine. Broken arm, likely a few stitches are needed, probably a concussion, a few possibly fractured ribs. What the excuse this time? Another 'lab accident?' Because it's looking like this 'accident' was a really big guy hitting him really hard."
"It's not like that." Peter frowned. He did like her, more than a friend. He did think she was cute. But it was...complicated. He knew she had something bad in her past. He didn't want to overstep any of her boundaries. And it didn't seem she liked him like that. He didn't want to ruin their friendship with his feelings. And he certainly didn't want to make her feel uncomfortable. "She doesn't like me like that."
Thor didn't listen. "Why's the baby elephant so upset?" Once Clint had started to call Peter 'baby elephant' the nickname had spread. Though, Thor had to be taught what the phrase 'elephant in the room' meant before he understood it.
"Sharp appendages." Maggie laughed. "No stitches this time." She sighed and stretched. "Wade and Strange will be pleased."
"Okay." Maggie slid out of the seat, Vanessa helped her to her feet with a gentle hand on her forearm.
"SHIT!" Peter ducked and webbed the shield to the wall before ducking under a punch from Nat. The last thing he wanted was to get a taste of those widow bites...again. They weren't pleasant. He used a web to pull him up to the other side of the room, hiding in the obstacle course. He needed to get the two split up. He could take Nat, but not when Steve was there to back her up. Steve would...be another problem, but Peter'd figure that out when he got to it.
The person didn't answer, but seemed able to hear, given his silence. He was waiting to someone else to speak.
"Yes, sir. However, the problem arises that Miss McKay mentioned Peter's name. There are seven other Peter Parker's in New York at Peter's age, and it'd be easy for even Mr. Stane to locate Peter at school."
"Warm hands...soft hands. Ness's hands." Maggie muttered and relaxed a little, eyelids drooping a little. "No drones?"
"It's j-just...the world is so vast and different. Everywhere. It's cool." Maggie looked around, she felt a headache coming on and bit her lip, trying to will it to go away. "How much trouble will I be in for not having a passport?"
"I'm going to start sending pieces to you, Stark. Scraps of your son. That's how it works with you, right? You take what isn't yours and leave behind the scraps? I'm thinking...fingers, hands, arms, feet, legs... Then do we drop the rest in the river or let him starve? That depends, I suppose. Both feel appropriate. Both feel similar to how you stole from me, from us. Be talking soon, Stark. We'll send further gifts directly to you, is that alright?"
Maggie closed her eyes and Strange began to read again. Steve could tell she was asleep seconds later. But Strange, true to his word, finished the chapter.
Maggie took his hand and stood up. "I'm okay...just wrung-out." She paused and frowned. She'd never felt his hands before. She wasn't used to physical contact. She didn't want to be used to it. That didn't mean she didn't need it. Maggie was human (mutant, but who cares about technicalities), after all, and humans needed contact with other people. Touch starvation was real, and she felt it on a daily basis. She, however, wanted it on her terms, not anyone else's. She wore gloves so she always had a choice, a choice of who she touched and when and why. She liked having control over that. Very few people had she ever taken her gloves off around. Wade and Vanessa among the only ones, though Professor X had been safe as well.
Tony saw the pictures and videos and sobbed. Peter looked beaten to hell and back. And he was a little thinner than he had been. The bastards weren't feeding him enough. Peter was covered in tears, whimpering and crying. His heart hurt. They'd only gotten one image of Maggie. It barely proved that she was alive. But it was recent. All the images were. They were still alive. Beaten and looking awful, but alive.
Tony pointed to the holograph. "Pete and I finished this up the last few adjustments over the last week. Look at it. Isn't it gorgeous?"
"Yup! Later. School day's out. I don't need to deal with this shit anymore." Peter waved and headed out with Ned. They chit-chatted until they were out in front of the school. "Oh, Happy's here. See you later?"
"I would not say so." Thor commented. "This Iron Man is our friend Tony. Tony has given us a home and food and weapons. He has created weapons knowing they would be used against him. I'm not so sure this is even, Clint. It seems that Tony has gotten the worse end of this. And he has been fighting a battle on his own for a long time."
Grappling was not Peter's strong suit, but he fought with everything he had until Steve's hand got around his throat.
"Hey, Mags." It sounded like him. But something in her rebelled. He knelt in front of her and gently touched her face.
"Hey, JARVIS." Peter responded happily as he swung into Queens. "What's happenin'?" He asked as he flipped up onto a building. He stuck the landing and damn it felt good to be back.
"You really okay?" Peter asked, sitting next to Maggie. He didn't reach out and touch her. When he had panic attacks it helped to have Steve or Tony hold him...but he could understand why Maggie didn't want to be touched.
"I'm So Happy I Could Die, this has been absolutely wonderful." Maggie pet the cloak a few more times and it flew off, returning to Stephen's shoulders.
"He's missing fingers. He needs treatment, antibiotics, painkillers. Can't have him on a battlefield and running him to the tower...." Strange sighed. "You know what? No. Bye-bye." He waved.
"I know, but I'm okay, promise." Tony said, leaning his head against Peter's. Then he looked over at Steve. "I'd let you join in, but this bed wasn't built for one, let alone three. Peter doesn't really count because he's a tiny fluffball."
Peter knew that those sounded pretty good, as far as he knew. His ears could tell she wasn't anywhere near as raspy as she'd been the night before, and her heart sounded steady. Peter walked across the room slowly. "Good signs?"
Maggie shrugged. "I'd rather not tonight. Thanks though. I'm going to...get some sleep. Is that okay?"
"Now, tell me why. Why does it look that way? What could make someone in danger, but also not have a defined source? Try to explain."
"I don't like doing this in silence. Could you turn on some music?" He asked, his eyes not straying at all from the task.
"See, then you might try to be clever and get out, Spiderman. No. We'll keep her. And keep you motivated."
They knew about May and Ben. About the foster homes. About Dad and Papa. The Tower wasn't safe. School wasn't safe. Dance wasn't safe.
"Who I am doesn't matter. I'm just the face, there's lots of us. You stole something from us. Call it our brain child. You took it. So we came up with a plan to ruin your life. Watched you. Thought about taking Captain Rogers, but then we saw something." He said. "A kid. Your kid. You have a son. Congrats, it's a boy! He's a nice kid, really sweet, genius, really."
"He's...hurt. Quiet. Um...I stepped away. Maggie gave me enough detail to identify the guy behind this."
"Hey, Maggie." Wade said as Vanessa kissed her forehead. "Let me guess, 'I should see the other guy'?"
Strange walked to the fridge and made her a cup of tea. She looked miserable, pale, slightly sweaty. Tears running down her face. Strange sat down on the sofa and put the tea on the coffee table. She lay on the sofa and rested her head in his lap. The Cloak covered her like it was a blanket. Strange didn't say a word, he massaged her head as she cried silently.
"All sounds too good to be true, right?" Tony nodded. "Well, believe me when I say this kid can give me a run for my money." He patted Peter's shoulder, then lowered his hand. "If you need proof. Every electronic in this building has been run by Mr. Parker's tech since midnight. The venue is going to be very happy about the non-existent electric bill. Now, let's go see some more projects."
Peter forced himself up and stood on the edge of the building. "Come to the dark side, Reese, I won't tell. Superhero's promise. Queen's never goes back on its promises. Plus, we have sandwiches. Come to the dark side and we can rid the streets of bike thieves or...I dunno. Something."
"I'm hungry and tired." And falling apart with guilt and shame and shocked out of his skull with images of his family dying or hating him.
Vanessa turned and looked at Strange. That wasn't normal. She...wasn't crying. Why wasn't she crying? It was wrong. It felt so wrong.
Clint's eyebrows pulled together. "What's up with you, Baby Elephant? You end up being collateral? Sorry, kiddo." He flopped onto the bed next to Peter carelessly.
"It's okay. It's not personal or anything. I know you won't hurt me and I know you're not...you know..."
"Hey, dad." Peter said after swallowing a mouthful of food. "Think there's some lasagna in there. It's really good."
"The mask was only for Nat, no one else knows about those." Tony said. "Maybe an LMD? Obie would have access to those. They have a heartbeat..."
"Maybe practice in front of mirrors. You'll be able to see your posture better. It's just a little off."  Peter spoke like nothing at all was weird.
"I'll let it slide." The shirt and pants were seamless. She could probably wear them under most of her normal clothes without them showing through. "Real question here?"
"You got it. We'll step into this Mexican restaurant here." Peter said. He walked up to Ned and held out a hand. "Don't let Dad and Papa freak out too much, we're okay."
Maggie wasn't unused to being alone. But...she wasn't used to being in someone else's home alone. She couldn't do it. Couldn't use his kitchen and ingredients. She pulled on a pair of socks and left the apartment like rooms, then headed to the communal kitchen. It hurt to walk so far, especially without pain meds on board, but she made it. She'd used this kitchen before, on her Saturdays at the sanctum. This one felt less like intruding.
"Hands too shaky. Could you...?" Strange looked at Wong and frowned. The man's smirk was ridiculous. "Could you thread this for me, asshole?"
"You called him?" Maggie asked. "Why?" Strange was busy, a lot. The universe wasn't small, and definitely needed protecting.
As Maggie told a story with her dance. She had a black skirt, top, and gloves on, hell, she looked like she was going to the 9 to 5, almost dressed like a waitress, one who was forced into all black. The only color on her was gold, glittery eyeshadow, a small rebellion in her otherwise drab 'work clothes'. It was amusing to watch her dance, sometimes it was like someone was pulling her strings, moving her like a puppet or doll. But as the song progressed she became less ridged, more rebellious. There was spunk and personality in her every move. And, in the last chorus, with a casual brush of her hand over her shoulder, the black, drab outfit transformed into a blue and gold, glittery dress that proved that she wasn't just what her 9 to 5 made her.
Maggie wanted to jolt away from the wall, ask him to uncuff her. But she pressed closer to the wall. Something wasn't right. This...wasn't right.
Peter rolled his eyes. "Reese's Pieces..." He sighed and shook his head. "You make it really hard to stay frenemies."
"All three of us could." Tracy said. "Make a bit of a game out of it. It'll be good for Peter. He needs to learn some cool stuff. Maybe if he ends up liking coding we can finally keep him to ourselves." She winked. "But I'm totally going to win this game."
"Yay!" She grinned. She flung her arms around him in a happy hug, then pulled back, pulling her gloves off without a second thought. She turned and waved to Peter. "See ya, thanks for the lift."
Ben was dead, again. Bleeding out on the floor. Peter was helpless to do anything, just like the first time. Peter couldn't stay here. He couldn't keep living these awful moments. He looked up and then closed his eyes. When he closed his eyes, he could better tell where the real threats were. He took a deep breath and yanked on the chains. He was still cuffed, but he managed to jump over the metal after it ripped out of the wall. An alarm went off.
"Nat then. We can trust her. Even Clint. They both love Peter and they're trained for this. If anyone comes near Peter, they'd have the Avengers on them in seconds."
"Hey, Dr. Strange. I know you've got something going on, but there's a bit of an emergency. Maggie..." Vanessa sniffled. "Sorry, um. She's been taken. We're trying to find her... She didn't come home and when we tracked her phone...someone took her. Wade's doing all he can. He's pretty good at tracking people down, but having more eyes is better, right?" Her breath shook. "Sorry. Um, hope you can talk soon."
Peter nodded, not exactly sure what he could say to Deadpool, but he headed for the side-door. Knowing his parents would be there, avoiding being spotted. He kicked the door open and skipped down the stairs. At the base, Tony and Steve were waiting with open arms. He launched himself into their hug. "Did you like it?"
"Well, you passed out with the hand saw, so let's mark that one down as the worst thus far. But...my, my, my..."
"It's no more danger than I'd normally be in. Plus, if you add in combat to the energy equation, my prototype wouldn't be enough. Even if he tries the plans I put on file... it wouldn't be enough if he wanted to sustain combat and backup systems safely." Peter said. "He may just try to make something based off of my idea. He may not even need me. And he is an asshole, he might just ask and expect me to do whatever he wants, same as how he treats and uses everyone else."
"And you should note that you leave a trail behind when you do that." Maggie nodded her head toward some webs.
"Hey, bud." Steve pulled him into a hug and he didn't look great. He looked frazzled, worried as he sat outside of the operating room.
"Yup. Still, I don't like your odds." She spun her staff in her hands, casually. "One girl, five baddies. I feel like the odds are ever in my favor."
Her phone rang as she tried to get her breathing under control. She picked it up. It was a video call. "H-hello?"
"Thanks for being ahead of me, JARVIS." Tony sighed. "Dammit, we just got you settled back in too. I wanted things to get more normal not more crazy."
Tracy, as usual, was a chatter box. "Oh, he's Mr. Stark's personal intern. I believe it was Miss Potts' idea." Tracy grinned. "And, you know, Mr. Stane, you should pick his brain for that problem you were asking about. He's the one working on that project I was talking to you about, actually, it's HIS project, entirely his brainchild."
"Why?" The man asked. "Because you pissed me off. This would have been easier, if you would have just stayed put."
Peter would make sure nothing bad happened. He didn't think Strange would hurt her, not one bit. But if he could be an extra set of eyes and ears for her, he would be.
Strange let out a laugh and nodded. "Yeah, probably." He took a breath. "The injured area was about that big." He traced a spot on his own skull. "Your skull was fractured, my guess is repetitive trauma. The last hit is what caused the bone to...well give up. Your powers reacted fast, kept everything still for a while." He blinked away glossiness in his eyes. "They slowed it down enough to keep you functioning. But they did give up and...everything resumed at full force. Thankfully, you were with me at that point. We did surgery very quickly after that. Four hours of it."
Tony frowned. Peter almost always came home in time for dinner, even if he went back out to patrol. He looked at Steve then ground his teeth together. "JARVIS, how's Peter's patrol going?"
Peter nodded and got up. He had some nice clothes. Honestly, he had more nice clothes than he'd ever had before. Tony made sure Peter had nice clothes, but most of Peter's clothes were normal, every-day things that Peter was used to. He walked to his closet and pulled out two suits, a couple of blazers, a few sweaters, a couple of ties, and button-ups.
